[0:00] things he fell down to worship the Angel
[0:03] and the angel said see thou do not for I
[0:06] am of thy fellow servants the prophets
[0:09] you know what he was saying do not miss
[0:11] your visitation for the message is not
[0:14] about me the message is about him it's
[0:17] about him tabernacling inside of you
[0:23] that's the Revelation given to John
[0:26] signified sentence signified by the hand
[0:29] of the end the angel is the messenger
[0:32] are you with me that angel messenger who
[0:34] would give John a tour of the Book of
[0:37] Revelation what is that that's in time
[0:38] ministry
[0:40] are you with me that's the end time
[0:41] ministry it's the time in the hour the
[0:43] seals have been taken off the book it is
[0:45] Christ revealing himself what is he
[0:47] doing just as he walked on the road to
[0:49] Emmaus showing himself in every shadow
[0:51] and type it's the same almighty God
[0:53] walking in the midst of his church he is
[0:56] showing himself in every type showing
[0:58] you and me I am Esther I am Rebecca I am
[1:00] Ruth I am sir all of these things
[1:03] amen right
[1:06] oh my in their record of the word of God
[1:10] and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and
[1:12] all the things that he saw so you
[1:14] realize that Revelation is the need of
[1:16] the hour
[1:19] not just knowledge
[1:22] not theology we need divine revelation
[1:25] because we realize brother Brown would
[1:27] emphasize this in the in the closing
[1:30] messages in 1965 he would talk about
[1:33] Abraham he said out the hell that
[1:35] Abraham did not even have a bible to
[1:37] read from
[1:39] he said he he only had it by Revelation
[1:43] and that's the real thing
[1:45] and I have heard but now I see he says
[1:47] now job being a prophet had access to
[1:49] God's grace he didn't have a Bible
[1:51] because the Bible wasn't wrote them we
[1:53] know it was in the heavens right but but
[1:55] he had access to God by Revelation and
[1:59] by vision and the message of rapture he
[2:01] says Cain and Abel didn't have a bible
[2:03] to read but it was revealed to Abel by
[2:06] faith which is a revelation so you know
[2:09] what that puts it down to you and I it
[2:11] is not how good of a reader that you are
[2:13] it's not our ability to read and
[2:15] pronounce words it is the ability to
[2:18] receive from almighty God it's divine
[2:21] revelation that's dropping down you know
[2:24] what Revelation is brother Brandon said
[2:25] one of the words being preached he said
[2:27] something will start to drop out of
[2:29] another realm and it begins he said to
[2:32] come down come down and he said where
[2:34] you were sitting maybe with a frown or
[2:36] or discourage he said that Revelation
[2:38] falls into your heart he said now your
[2:41] muscles seemed to tighten he said in
[2:43] your frown goes through a smile he said
[2:46] what's happening it is a revelation
[2:48] that's coming down from an unseen realm
[2:51] and it's trapping into your life
[2:54] what is it you are being influenced just
[2:57] as Isaiah was in the temple and he said
[3:01] I saw the Lord lifted up and his train
[3:04] filled the temple
[3:07] don't you realize that's why we need him
[3:10] to come in every service we need to step
[3:13] back and though my problems my needs it
[3:17] seems so great but let me see the Lord
[3:19] high and lifted up
[3:22] [Applause]
[3:24] and his train filling the temple
[3:29] drone guards that are watching over the
[3:32] word
[3:32] [Applause]
[3:35] oh glory be to God in the highest
[3:38] that's why revelation
[3:40] Revelation brother Brown would say it
[3:42] like this Revelation carries us
[3:45] Beyond
[3:47] in the beginning
[3:49] because
[3:51] as he goes on to say so theologians can
[3:53] take
[3:54] the word here and the word here in the
[3:56] beginning he said and they can work with
[3:58] the word but Revelation takes us back
[4:00] into the thoughts
[4:03] and if you get back into the thought oh
[4:05] help me preacher now you're back into
[4:06] the person the Mind who spoke it
[4:11] and if you're back into mind and
[4:13] receiving the thought of him that
[4:14] spoketh then he that spoke it will bring
[4:18] forth what he said and whatever he
[4:21] brings forth will declare the source
[4:23] that it come from
[4:25] oh Hallelujah so now notice so this is
[4:29] why brother Graham could say it like
[4:30] this every word in the Bible is God's
[4:32] thoughts laying in seed form if received
[4:35] into the human being and spoke by the
[4:37] same thought that materialize the Bible
[4:40] it'll bring the thing to pass
[4:43] you realize this is why even why you
[4:45] don't even wait for the end of the
[4:46] service when the word is coming right
[4:48] here the Bible brother man tells us when
[4:49] the Holy Spirit is here to inspire you
[4:51] confess what he is saying
[4:53] and God will bring your body into
[4:55] subjection
[4:57] right you're under that inspiration
[5:00] Hallelujah because what's happening you
[5:03] are receiving it from the same Source by
[5:07] that spoke but that same thought and
[5:09] it's materialize the Bible so what are
[5:11] you saying how many times you heard what
[5:13] brother Brown's saying you know what he
[5:14] said I'm going to pray a prayer and I
[5:15] want you to repeat the words after me
[5:18] I haven't heard that multiple times you
[5:19] know that it's powerful you know what it
[5:22] is God here was it would be the words
[5:24] that would be coming across and you
[5:26] might say well not everybody's going to
[5:28] believe that I am going to stand here
[5:30] and say that everybody that is ordained
[5:32] to believe it is going to believe it
[5:35] stop focusing on the negative and focus
[5:38] on the positive
[5:41] are you hearing me now there are lives
[5:43] that no doubt that took that and it was
[5:46] more than reciting words you know what
[5:48] it was it was those who could not help
[5:51] themselves but God rich in Mercy was
[5:54] coming by their way and God was giving
[5:57] them the words to say that he indeed is
[6:00] the high priest of that confession and
[6:02] they acted upon that don't you
[6:04] understand that's what's happening in
[6:06] these Services it is God speaking to you
[6:10] and I that we might say the same thing
[6:13] that he is saying
[6:15] amen
[6:17] granted Lord Jesus
[6:22] brother Sammy I don't want to be a
[6:23] repeater I do
[6:26] I do I'm not looking for new thoughts I
[6:28] just want to speak his thoughts
[6:33] his thoughts when they're spoke that
[6:35] same inspiration has defeated Devils
[6:38] down through time his thoughts have
[6:40] changed lives down through time
[6:42] are you hearing me it was his thoughts
[6:44] being unfolded about the woman at the
[6:46] well remember she had been oh I love how
[6:48] brother Wayne was led by the spirit of
[6:50] God it just comes to me right now when
[6:52] he made that statement man I felt like
[6:53] running around this parking lot and
[6:55] around this whole thing around my dear
[6:56] thing I just felt like going when he
[6:58] spoke about that woman at the well she
[7:00] had never received another kid never
[7:04] received a thought any higher than being
[7:06] a prostitute but here came the Lord
[7:09] Jesus and what was he doing he was
[7:11] bringing a thought of who she really was
[7:15] you're not a prostitute you're not a
[7:19] daughter of sin but you're a daughter of
[7:22] Abraham
[7:24] what was the word doing giving her a
[7:27] higher thought
[7:33] oh brother Samuel you just really need
[7:34] to pee preach where the people at are
[7:36] you a referee or something
[7:38] maybe I need to ask you what to preach
[7:40] [Music]
[7:42] but you see this is why the word comes
[7:44] what do what did he say to John in
[7:46] Revelations 4 come up hither
[7:50] are you in miss me it takes the word to
[7:54] raise you and I in position
[7:57] it's not interested coming down here let
[7:59] me get you fixed up I want to take you
[8:00] up there but let me get you fixed up no
[8:01] no God says I bring you up here and the
[8:04] whole process is a transformation the
[8:08] problem is we're trying to change people
[8:10] down here
[8:11] you can't change them down here they've
[8:13] got to be affected by another Realm
[8:16] that's what the message is
[8:19] it's not Reformation
[8:21] it's in the fact of the revelation of
[8:25] Jesus Christ that comes from another
[8:27] Realm
[8:31] that's it
[8:35] this is why Jesus could say
[8:37] in a little while
[8:40] the light is with you walk in the light
[8:42] while you've got it walk in it lest
[8:44] Darkness come on you
[8:46] now I'm just going to say
[8:48] this is why
[8:50] when lies begin to drift away
[8:53] start getting cold on God and you drift
[8:55] away I'm not here putting anybody down
[8:57] I'm here to I mean I want to dispel that
[8:59] Darkness
[9:02] you know Darkness itself I I can sit out
[9:04] there
[9:05] setting my living room and down there in
[9:09] the darkness and you know that light
[9:10] starts coming up little by little by
[9:12] little same way in the evening time that
[9:14] Darkness starts coming on little by
[9:15] little before you know you're like wow
[9:16] it's dark
[9:18] when we're Delight go right it just
[9:20] comes on just like that but that's why
[9:22] why is light come that we would walk in
[9:25] it
[9:26] the word walk Enoch walked with God
[9:31] he walked with God to walk means let the
[9:35] word have preeminence let it regulate
[9:38] and direct every facet of our life
[9:43] now notice this lest Darkness come upon
[9:47] you for he that walketh in darkness
[9:49] North and on whether he goes see this is
[9:51] what light does light it comes to let
[9:53] you know the pathway that you're on
[9:55] that's what the light as you're walking
[9:58] in the light what does it do your feet
[10:00] become more established it becomes more
[10:03] sure and as the things are becoming more
[10:05] sure what is it it's Sons and Daughters
[10:07] of God manifesting under the rest of God
[10:10] Who You Are
[10:12] see the light comes to bring rest that's
[10:15] what the preaching of the word does it
[10:17] comes to relieve your struggle and bring
[10:19] rest
[10:22] oh Jesus
[10:23] while you have light
[10:26] believe in the light why you've got to
[10:30] believe in it remember they rejoiced in
[10:31] John's light but they didn't walk in it
[10:35] believe in the light that ye may be
[10:37] Children of the life so you told me to
[10:39] walk in it we're to believe it that we
[10:42] might be Children of the light so the
[10:44] light has come to bring forth children
[10:49] then what would the children be
[10:51] they would be light
[10:53] right if we're Children of the light
[10:56] then our life is like what is light
[10:59] light is the word interpreted
[11:06] are you with me now
[11:08] oh my
[11:09] thing you have notice how Peter would
[11:12] write of this you're being seeing you
[11:14] have purified your souls in obeying the
[11:16] truth of the spirit unto unfeigned love
[11:18] of the Brethren see that you love one
[11:20] another with a pure heart fervently
[11:22] notice the scripture being born again
[11:24] not of corruptable seed but of
[11:27] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[11:30] liveth and abideth forever let me just
[11:33] read this out of the Amplified you have
[11:35] been regenerated which is born again not
[11:38] from a mortal origin
[11:40] but from one that is Immortal by the
[11:44] ever-living and Lasting word of God
[11:46] so we're not our origin is not of this
[11:51] Earth
[11:52] that our new birth is not of an Earthly
[11:55] origin
[11:56] let us make a tabernacle to Moses let us
[11:59] make a thing no our our birth is of a
[12:03] Heavenly origin
[12:05] Jesus said I'm calm in my father's name
[12:10] right he came to bear witness of that
[12:13] life
[12:14] so the life was made manifest which
[12:17] identified the name of the father
[12:20] is that right the Lord Jesus Christ it
[12:23] was God come down in Redemption because
[12:25] what does the son do a son Bears the
[12:29] life of his father
[12:31] right all that the father has all the
[12:33] inheritance all of that the son has that
[12:36] and he came to redeem you and I that now
[12:39] that same life could come back up on you
[12:43] and I
[12:47] now we are joint heirs
[12:52] [Applause]
[12:54] all that God is
[12:56] he poured into Christ
[12:59] all that Christ was he hath poured
[13:02] into the church
[13:04] changing the form
[13:06] but the same God
[13:11] now notice with Moses here can I have
[13:13] just a few more moments
[13:14] I know I ask you for that a lot but
[13:18] God revealed to Moses what to do
[13:21] remember when Moses was down in Egypt
[13:24] and he did not know what to do
[13:26] God had met him at the burning bush he
[13:27] went with that Authority but he didn't
[13:30] know
[13:31] what to do
[13:33] but God already let him know I'm going
[13:34] to execute judgment against all the gods
[13:37] of Egypt
[13:39] and so we understand every plague that
[13:41] was coming around the things that was
[13:43] was spoken in that hour
[13:45] God
[13:47] thought it
[13:48] Moses
[13:50] spoke it
[13:52] and it happened
[13:54] is that right
[13:56] now remember everything
[13:58] in order to execute judgment against
[14:02] every God it was going to take a higher
[14:05] thought
[14:08] are you with me to bring down them gods
[14:11] and to execute judgment against it it
[14:13] would take a greater thought than that
[14:16] of man's thinking because those gods
[14:18] were the products of man's thinking
[14:19] their imagination right that's what they
[14:22] were the product of that but here God's
[14:24] thoughts coming down and coming into a
[14:26] man and that vessel being surrendered
[14:28] what was what was Moses speaking not his
[14:31] own thoughts
[14:32] he was speaking God's thoughts
[14:34] and when he spoke God's thoughts it
[14:37] happened
[14:39] let me just try to bring this down I
[14:41] realize I there's just too much here
[14:43] before me
[14:44] he spoke it and it happened
[14:46] so this is where brother Branham is
[14:48] coming into this place right here
[14:51] and he's talking about how the word
[14:52] brings such joy and it stimulates us
[14:55] he said we get over flooded this out of
[14:57] the forest seal
[14:58] and brother Bram will say
[15:01] now he says you know he goes on to
[15:03] things but I he said I know there's a
[15:05] lot of fanaticism in people carrying on
[15:07] and all those things like that but watch
[15:08] how brother Brown goes through all this
[15:10] brother Brian when I watch how brother
[15:12] Brown goes through all this brother
[15:13] Brown don't just take and just go off on
[15:15] a tangent on things sure there's going
[15:17] to be fanaticism there's fanaticism on
[15:19] either side but I'm not here to preach
[15:22] on fanaticism
[15:23] you know why God will sort it all out
[15:26] are you hearing me you want your
[15:28] brother's birthday what are you saying
[15:29] I'm saying we got too many refs in the
[15:31] house of God
[15:34] got too many refs in the hot you know
[15:36] what trade your referee sued in for a
[15:38] suit and tie and put away the black and
[15:41] white stripes
[15:42] In the Flesh in the spirit just put your
[15:46] wrath away let's say now how can you say
[15:48] that I'll tell you how I can say it
[15:50] because the prophet would preach the
[15:51] message respects then he comes around to
[15:52] question and answers in 59 and he says
[15:54] I've seen people in the flesh but I
[15:56] won't say nothing against it
[15:59] are you hearing me
[16:01] that's why that's why it's dangerous
[16:04] well I'm not glad I said I'm not gonna
[16:05] let God sort it all out
[16:10] I can only be to God I just love that
[16:13] just let God do it
[16:15] let's just let go and let you know we
[16:17] talk about let go and let God have a way
[16:19] I mean it
[16:20] let go and let God have his way remember
[16:23] the Samuel somebody might be in the
[16:24] flesh might be but there's some that
[16:26] ain't
[16:30] glory be to God
[16:36] sorry if that's what you thought you'd
[16:38] come to church for wrong thinking
[16:40] we don't need rest we need participators
[16:45] we don't need head coaches and
[16:46] assistants coaches we just need some
[16:48] participators winning lives to get into
[16:51] the spirit of almighty God
[16:54] now hear me now
[16:55] you may not jump you may not shout you
[16:58] may not run I don't think any less than
[17:01] that I preached in congregations that my
[17:03] I mean they're not you know maybe as
[17:06] loud or whatever more or you know or are
[17:09] expressive in their worship
[17:11] but I felt the pool just the same
[17:13] are you hearing me they ain't no more
[17:15] spiritual they ain't no less spiritual
[17:17] right but Sammy what are you saying I'm
[17:19] saying a mount Transfiguration
[17:22] experience is not a highlighting of our
[17:27] ideas
[17:29] and people if they're going to worship
[17:30] they're going to come according to my
[17:32] idea
[17:33] nope we just want to see Jesus
[17:37] if we really get
[17:41] together
[17:44] oh don't you love him
[17:46] oh brother bam said he's now watch right
[17:48] after this statement on that if an
[17:50] answer and he said now you watch you
[17:51] start bringing the word now that's the
[17:53] thing that actually brings life is the
[17:55] word and that brings the joy of
[17:57] stimulation of new wine and that's what
[18:00] it was on Pentecost when the word was
[18:03] Vindicated now notice it wasn't just if
[18:06] they had they had a sensation there's no
[18:08] doubt about it they maybe they did have
[18:10] a sensation maybe they did feel I I
[18:12] don't know maybe maybe they did but
[18:14] here's what it was that was going on the
[18:16] word was Vindicated to them
[18:19] now the resurrected word had already
[18:22] come and gathered them right the
[18:24] resurrected word had already gathered
[18:27] them and brought them into a little room
[18:29] and began to
[18:31] breathe upon them and said receive ye
[18:34] the Holy Ghost showing that they would
[18:36] be born by the Breath of God
[18:40] and God was identifying this is what's
[18:43] going to come I am going to come and
[18:46] vindicate
[18:47] my word
[18:51] oh my oh and he Vindicated Joel 2 28 he
[18:55] Vindicated act Isaiah 28 19. now notice
[18:58] he says the first thing you know
[19:01] he says what happened
[19:03] they were up there and you know maybe he
[19:05] said somebody said well I believe we
[19:06] waited long enough let's just accept it
[19:08] by Faith remember always go through that
[19:10] right I mean I believe we let's just
[19:12] accept it by faith brother Graham said
[19:13] that's good Baptist Doctrine but it
[19:15] won't it didn't work with them brothers
[19:20] the new God's a god of reality
[19:22] let me just finish this so the first
[19:24] thing you know it had to become a
[19:27] reality
[19:28] they waited on their Ministry for the
[19:30] word to be Vindicated and when you come
[19:32] to seek the Holy Spirit
[19:35] you do the same
[19:38] yes now I want you to pay close
[19:40] attention here on this I know I'm at the
[19:42] end of a message and asking you that but
[19:43] this is really important you you can
[19:45] accept it by faith you can ex you have
[19:48] to accept Christ by faith that's exactly
[19:50] right and you accept the Holy Spirit by
[19:54] faith but then let the Holy Spirit come
[19:59] and give the circumcision as a witness
[20:03] that he has accepted your faith now
[20:06] notice what he said you accept it by
[20:09] faith well you say how do I accept it by
[20:12] faith and then and waiting on the
[20:13] circumcision in other words God to come
[20:15] and vindicate it because by faith it's
[20:19] revealed to you this is my promise
[20:22] the promise of the Holy Ghost belongs to
[20:25] me
[20:26] this is god making known his word to my
[20:30] heart
[20:30] in other words it is by faith that you
[20:33] are accepting it in that
[20:35] you are not someone who is unworthy but
[20:40] he hath made me Worthy
[20:41] so when you're coming to accept the Holy
[20:44] Ghost are you hearing me now you're not
[20:46] coming to accept it as a defeated person
[20:48] you'll never get anywhere you're not
[20:51] accepting it with well I don't know
[20:52] maybe he will give it to you you're not
[20:54] that's not that's God will not come and
[20:56] circumcise on that but when he comes and
[20:58] circumcised is the holy spirit when it's
[21:01] been accepted by faith it directs you
[21:03] into the promise that you say this is my
[21:07] promise
[21:09] and I am coming upon the righteousness
[21:12] of Jesus Christ I'm not coming upon my
[21:15] own merits I'm coming upon his merits I
[21:18] know that I have repented I have been
[21:21] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[21:23] he's dealt with my heart in that way and
[21:26] I believe that the Holy Ghost is for me
[21:32] that's the difference I have to stand
[21:35] here and say this part as it comes
[21:37] that's the difference when brother
[21:39] Branham says and he'll deal with people
[21:41] that's on the prayer line he'll say now
[21:43] and one time he was dealing with just a
[21:45] person they weren't there but around the
[21:47] audience he said no you've been
[21:48] confessing you have the Holy Ghost but
[21:50] he goes into talking what he's dealing
[21:52] within is that they're confessing of it
[21:54] is that it's just as confessing I have
[21:56] the Holy Ghost and they're still living
[21:59] some other life and they're okay with
[22:01] that
[22:02] that's not the same as the word being
[22:06] revealed and you confessing the promise
[22:10] because you are confessing that which
[22:13] you are being drawn to
[22:15] yes sir are you hearing me now
[22:19] that's a big difference right there
[22:22] because there's somebody confessing and
[22:23] see what the word was coming to do was
[22:25] to let them know your confession is not
[22:27] matching up with your testimony
[22:30] right you got to get this fixed right so
[22:32] we're letting them know they got to get
[22:33] the confession right
[22:36] right
[22:37] don't you love the Lord
[22:40] oh how we love you Lord so notice but
[22:42] the ramen says it like this
[22:44] he says and it's a it's a witness he
[22:47] said now God gave Abraham Abraham
[22:49] believed God right but then God gave him
[22:51] a circle a sign of circumcision he said
[22:54] that's the same thing that we must do we
[22:56] must wait on the Holy Spirit till it's
[22:59] done something not necessarily because
[23:01] we spoke in tongues we've danced or got
[23:04] emotional shouted but until we were
[23:06] changed until something actually
[23:10] happened
[23:12] and he makes this statement I don't care
[23:14] what form it comes in just so it happens
[23:18] that's the main thing
[23:22] but then goes on to talk about in that
[23:24] same quote he said I've seen
[23:26] pins stand up
[23:28] and write things
[23:30] among witches that was exactly the truth
[23:34] things being called out that was exactly
[23:36] the truth
[23:38] he said but yet it was all false
[23:43] because all of that this is where Paul
[23:46] could say
[23:48] though I have faith
[23:50] to move all mountains
[23:52] though I understand all Mysteries
[23:58] thank you
[24:00] if I have not
[24:02] charity
[24:04] which is the love of God
[24:06] which is the Holy Ghost
[24:09] and nothing
[24:10] but a tingling
[24:12] symbol
[24:14] your life was not meant to be a life
[24:18] fool
[24:19] of absurd noises
[24:23] it's to have a clear
[24:25] certain distinct
[24:28] sound
[24:30] not a clinging together nautical
[24:34] but a certain
[24:36] sound
[24:38] that comes out of our life
[24:40] a certain sound Jesus Christ is the same
[24:44] yesterday
[24:45] today and forever
[24:48] I am his child
[24:51] his life something
[24:53] he's changed me
[24:55] completely
[24:58] watch this
[24:59] I am closing here I am
[25:01] let me just finish this thought here
[25:06] where the Brahman expresses that
[25:10] so he says he's speaking of all those
[25:12] things I just referred to he said so
[25:13] those things doesn't mean that you have
[25:16] the Holy Spirit
[25:18] but when he the person The Immortal
[25:22] Spirit of Christ becomes your personal
[25:25] savior and changes you and throws your
[25:31] views right straight into Calvary and to
[25:34] this word
[25:35] something
[25:37] has happened
[25:39] see it changes you and throws your view
[25:45] right straight into Calvary to this word
[25:50] something has happened
[25:53] see it changes you and it it and it
[25:57] throws your views so your views are
[25:59] right through Calvary
[26:02] your life is lived through Calvary
[26:06] your life is directed into the word
[26:09] amen the word comes and deals with your
[26:11] life being unto me Lord according to Thy
[26:14] word the word is changing us from Glory
[26:17] unto Glory what is it doing throwing our
[26:19] views into Calvary
[26:22] our ideas about things our thoughts
[26:26] that doesn't fade away just like that
[26:28] well I've been born again and all that
[26:30] Fades away as far as my ideas about
[26:32] certain things you know and I know there
[26:34] are things that the Holy Spirit
[26:37] has dismantled our views through Calvary
[26:42] there's things that we once used to
[26:44] think
[26:45] that if I don't do this or if I do this
[26:47] and we lived Victorious based on whether
[26:50] we did this or we didn't do that and
[26:52] what we want and what does it do the
[26:54] views by channeling everything into
[26:56] Calvary brings us back into the
[26:58] Simplicity of Jesus Christ
[27:01] what does it do it lets you and I
[27:03] realize that the real victory is a life
[27:06] that's in Jesus Christ
[27:09] our lives have been changed I didn't
[27:11] change myself
[27:12] you didn't change you
[27:14] he changed us
[27:15] and our views are in Calvary those are
[27:18] the decisions that we make Even in our
[27:20] life
[27:21] the decisions that we make remember when
[27:23] it says by faith Moses by faith Enoch by
[27:26] faith Noah what was it their views when
[27:28] the Revelation came it changed their
[27:30] views
[27:32] views yeah everything on Earth then they
[27:36] seen how does this fit or how does this
[27:38] place because the view of the Ark is
[27:40] more important than anything here and if
[27:43] I focus on this everything here will
[27:45] fall right in line
[27:46] right
[27:48] this is where Moses if I focus on that
[27:50] everything else will fall right in line
[27:53] see how the enemy wants to try to trick
[27:55] and trap and everything else and act as
[27:57] though that we need to get everything
[27:58] down here on this realm and I need to
[28:00] get this level all straightened out and
[28:02] I've got to no no seek you first
[28:04] the kingdom of God
[28:07] and his righteousness and all
[28:10] these other things
[28:13] will be added unto you
[28:15] showing what you are a temple
[28:19] of the Holy Ghost
[28:22] that God
[28:24] would reveal his thoughts in and through
[28:28] your life
[28:30] and that's here this morning
[28:32] if that's not happened in your life
[28:35] don't just settle with I know the
[28:37] message I agree with the message I
[28:40] believe the message remember believing
[28:43] is not the seal
[28:46] is that right at least I'm preaching
[28:48] scripture Acts 19 this is the heart of
[28:50] the message you see God didn't send a
[28:53] message to bring condemnation he sent it
[28:57] to uncover
[28:59] Satan's traps
[29:01] Satan doesn't care how religious
[29:06] you are
[29:07] as long as you miss that life
[29:11] and I want you to understand you could
[29:13] know every doctrine of a message you
[29:16] could know all types you could know all
[29:18] things you could be gifted as gift it
[29:20] can be but if you miss that life
[29:23] you've missed what the message is all
[29:26] about
[29:28] because the message is get under the
[29:31] blood
[29:32] incredible search just type it in on
[29:34] your app that's the message hi that's
[29:36] the message and watch how brother
[29:37] Brandon takes that all the way through
[29:39] because that is that's the real message
[29:42] well brother Samuel I've received the
[29:43] message that has God confirmed in your
[29:46] life your faith why do I know he's
[29:49] confirm because you've been changed
[29:53] the Bible says sin will not have
[29:57] dominion
[29:58] over you
[30:01] well brother Sammy add just a little bit
[30:03] of this no no no no no no no let's say
[30:05] what the word says
[30:08] he will lead us into all truth
[30:12] let's let's say what the word says
[30:14] let's take a full Deliverance
[30:17] God's word in this hour
[30:19] and you understand that his presence
[30:21] right here right now you understand that
[30:22] he's not come he didn't come even to
[30:25] Peter he didn't even come to argue with
[30:26] Peter when Peter said let us build three
[30:27] times no no even he didn't wasted his he
[30:29] didn't waste any breaths with that he
[30:31] just overshadowed
[30:32] what was it out of that cloud came a
[30:35] voice
[30:36] and that voice said hear you him
[30:39] out of that cloud came The Voice
[30:42] give back to the word
[30:44] get back to the promised land get back
[30:47] into our land of promise
[30:49] that's what the Holy Spirit has come to
[30:51] do
[30:52] and it's the power of the word of God at
[30:55] work in our lives
[30:57] and it thinks our view into Calvary I I
[31:00] just say it in this manner oh God
[31:03] let let every part even though my views
[31:06] I I know that I know what God has done
[31:08] not only changed my nature but he's my
[31:10] he's everything to me
[31:12] he's everything
[31:14] he's the reason of things I can't say
[31:15] every decision that I've ever made no
[31:17] more than you can that every decision
[31:18] has been right on but I know one thing
[31:20] about it if there's decisions that I've
[31:22] made that's led me away from his
[31:25] presence
[31:25] I'm not comfortable
[31:28] and that's where I make I draw the line
[31:30] and there's things that God brings out
[31:32] in our life as we grow what is it it's
[31:34] our view it's on Calvary
[31:36] the Lord
[31:38] I want you
[31:40] I want more of you
[31:42] I want my views
[31:44] to be changed
[31:46] if there's things that I'm doing in a
[31:48] certain way I want them to be changed
[31:49] let me just tell you how important that
[31:51] is because it's God coming down
[31:54] changing your view about you yes
[31:59] it's God doing that
[32:01] and you're realizing that ain't me
[32:04] this way that I've directed this way or
[32:06] thought this way you realize hey wait a
[32:08] minute that's not who I am
[32:11] I'm of another tree
[32:13] I'm of that tree of life what are you
[32:15] doing right then you're letting the word
[32:17] come in preeminence
[32:19] and the word is having power and your
[32:22] life it's healing
[32:24] from the inside
[32:28] oh don't you love me
[32:30] I just say just encouraged every heart
[32:33] even here in this service
[32:37] and I say this even to you I had these
[32:39] things on my heart not knowing Lord do I
[32:41] go this direction do I go this way or do
[32:43] I go into another thought do I but early
[32:46] this morning
[32:47] he came and confirmed that
[32:49] [Applause]
[32:52] there's needs
[32:54] there's needs Reach Out
[32:57] and touch him
[32:59] Reach Out And Touch him
[33:01] let God confirm his word in our lives
[33:06] whatever the need physical healing
[33:07] spiritual healing let God come confirm
[33:10] his word
[33:12] but we want more we need more friends we
[33:15] need more
[33:17] than a letter we must have that life
[33:22] because when it's all said and done
[33:25] that's what's going in the Rapture is
[33:28] character
[33:29] and character is made by the life that's
[33:33] within us
[33:35] and that's what's most important is that
[33:37] it's God's thoughts that it dropped down
[33:41] become word
[33:42] and what has been spoken that we say
[33:45] this has happened we see it in our lives
[33:48] it's manifest
[33:51] what is it it's God
[33:53] it's God
[33:55] amen don't you love him
[33:57] amen oh God I
[34:00] I want I want I want him to be glorified
[34:04] I wanted to be glorified in my home I
[34:07] want him to be glorified
[34:09] and my life as a father
[34:11] as a husband
[34:13] as a pastor
[34:14] as a friend I want him to be glorified
[34:16] in my life not to draw attention to me I
[34:19] don't want that
[34:21] but the greatest privilege
[34:23] is that others might see him
[34:26] and they'll be influenced by him
[34:29] because I'm just I'm just a man you're
[34:31] just a man just a woman we realize that
[34:33] I don't want somebody to be influenced
[34:35] by me that if they start doing something
[34:37] like it ain't about that it's being
[34:39] influenced by him
[34:42] Let It Be influenced by him because
[34:44] that's something that's greater
[34:48] than a natural
[34:50] origin It's Supernatural
[34:54] Hallelujah asparagus
[34:58] Heavenly Father
[35:06] Lord
[35:08] you know Lord each of our needs
[35:13] and Lord even in moments Lord
[35:16] like this Lord I realize as we come to
[35:19] the end of a service
[35:22] God I pray that
[35:24] father for each need that's gathered
[35:27] here Lord
[35:32] Lord
[35:33] you have spoken Lord to our hearts there

[35:41] in our midst Lord to minister
[35:44] to our needs
[35:46] Lord my prayer is oh God
[35:49] for every need Lord that is gathered
[35:51] here Among Us Lord
[35:54] I pray that God that
[35:57] if there's one Lord that has not
[36:01] experienced
[36:03] that change Lord
[36:06] on the inside to where
[36:09] the things of this world
[36:12] have faded away
[36:15] have passed away
[36:18] and the views have become aligned with
[36:22] Calvary throwing our views straight into
[36:24] Calvary
[36:26] oh God
[36:28] granted Lord this morning I pray
[36:30] Heavenly Father May
[36:33] they not go one more moment
[36:36] without Lord
[36:40] submitting their life surrendering it
[36:44] Lord
[36:45] into your hands oh God
[36:48] lord it's more
[36:51] than knowing
[36:52] the word
[36:54] it's to know the author of the word
[36:58] seeing him move seeing him act in our
[37:00] midst it's declaring to us that he's
[37:03] still the same that he keeps every
[37:05] promise and that we ourselves
[37:09] can be a partaker
[37:12] of that same life
[37:16] in our lives
[37:18] Lord I asked this morning that God you
[37:22] would Grant a courage
[37:25] Lord grant o God of your mercies Lord
[37:30] as Lord we would present
[37:32] our bodies Our Lives surrendering into
[37:37] your hand sword
[37:39] that we would no longer be conformed
[37:42] to this world
[37:45] but be transformed
[37:47] by the renewing
[37:49] of our mind
[37:53] Lord we're aware that conforming to this
[37:55] world we think back in the scriptures
[37:57] the Bible said Demas for soot Paul
[38:00] having loved this present world
[38:03] your Prophet would tell us Demas was a
[38:06] Spirit-filled man
[38:10] but it had never went down to the soul
[38:19] and your Prophet goes on to tell us he
[38:21] never went out to nightclubs and bars
[38:23] and things like that
[38:25] he just loved the world system the world
[38:29] way of going about things
[38:32] Lord the world the worldly system way
[38:37] is a way Lord of Deceit
[38:40] it's a way God did
[38:42] robs lies from the personal experience
[38:47] of Jesus Christ
[38:50] in the heart of the person
[38:53] Lord we don't want to be conformed to
[38:56] this world
[38:57] but we want to be transformed by the
[39:01] renewing of our mind
[39:04] Lord even throughout this building here

[39:43] that when your view

[39:50] what is not your view
[39:52] then Lord I want to surrender to that
[39:55] Lord

[41:18] in the name of Jesus Christ
[41:21] amen
[41:25] Hallelujah if you'd like prayer this
[41:27] morning we'd be happy to pray with you
[41:30] Hallelujah

[41:34] believe in God
[41:36] we're not coming with a I hope
[41:39] it might happen
[41:40] but we come with a
[41:43] a faith that this is my promise he bore
[41:46] my shame no matter what what it is
[41:49] he's already paid
[41:51] the price by his stripes
[41:54] we are healed
[41:57] and I'm the Lord that healeth all thine
[42:00] diseases
[42:01] forgiveth all thine iniquities
[42:04] he's the same Lord Jesus
[42:07] walking right here Among Us
[42:09] and he wants to do for you
[42:12] what none other can do
[42:15] I'd say this morning
[42:18] Lord be glorified
[42:20] in your Tabernacle Lord
[42:23] be glorified Lord
[42:28] granted Lord
[42:30] let the word speak let the word have the
[42:32] final say
[42:33] let the word declare itself
[42:37] let him do it
[42:40] Hallelujah
[42:43] whatever the need is this morning
[42:45] God is greater
[42:47] as Isaiah said I saw the Lord high and
[42:49] lifted up and his train filled the
[42:52] temple
[42:53] moments ago when he dropped that as we
[42:56] were speaking
[42:58] let it be maybe you've come times and
[43:01] times before but let it be this moment
[43:04] the reason is I saw the Lord high and
[43:08] lifted up
[43:10] he's high above every sickness
[43:12] he's high above every sin
[43:14] he's above every demon of Oppression and
[43:17] depression
[43:18] he's the Lord of Glory
[43:21] and he cares about you
[43:23] he loves you and he wants to do for you
[43:26] Hallelujah let's just sing worship Him
[43:30] amen
[43:32] [Music]
[43:35] oh keep
[43:38] your mind
[43:42] stayed on me
[43:47] stayed on Me
[43:52] Faith
