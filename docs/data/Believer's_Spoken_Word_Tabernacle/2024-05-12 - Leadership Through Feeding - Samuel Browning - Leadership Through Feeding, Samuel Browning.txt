don't want to leave anything out brother brandham says it a lot better um with it just being Mother's Day and all um the song I've sang before it kind of just reminded me what the Lord did for us he said not long ago a young lady came in from college her mother had washed over a board to send her to college and when she drove into the station she brought a young girl with her she got away from God and away from church the young girl was with her sitting in the train looking out there stood the mother on the outside she was all scarred up and the young girl was with her the other girl coming home from college with her and said look at that old haggy looking woman that was the girl's mother she isn't said isn't that a horrible looking my wouldn't you hate to have to sit at the table with her to eat that was her girlfriend now instead of the girl speaking up she turned her head when she got off the train this old wrinkled woman ran up to her and threw her arms around the girl and kissed her and the girl was so repulsed she got away from her got away from church and God and she was so cold she turned her back to look the other way she said my darling my darling what's what's happened to you and she was so embarrassed because of her girlfriend just then one of the conductors who knowed the story walked up and grabbed the young girl by the shoulders and said look here Mary what do you mean and said Are you ashamed of your mother since you've been away to college so remember you know the story one day the house was burning down your mother was a beautiful woman far more beautiful than you are or ever would be and said you're you were a little crying baby when she was hanging clothes in the backyard and all at once the house caught fire and here come fire engine to put it out and the house was a flame and you were crying up in the upstairs no no one would dare to pierce the Flames that little mother wrapped herself in there she run through those Flames she grabbed you took her clothes from her own body and wrapped your face up and wrapped you all up and put your arms and placed her her own face in the flames and Through the flames she could rescue you said that's why you're pretty today and that's why she's scarred Are you ashamed of those scars amen and that's what Christ has done for us amen I don't I don't want to be ashamed of those scars [Music] Amen in the midst of the garden a decision was made as eve took forbidden fruit and was deceived that day Adam stood there crying with a choice he must make to stay alone in the garden I can almost hear him say [Music] I don't want to live in Paradise [Music] alone for the one I love the most is what makes Paradise a home if I must go away that's a price I will pay I don't want to live in Paradise alone some say that God searched heaven for a one willing to come I don't believe there was a search Jesus said I am the one I love it here in heaven but I really want my bride so he left Heaven splendor on Calvary he cried I don't want to live in Paradise alone for the one I love the most is what makes Paradise a home if I must go away that's a price I will pay I don't want to live in Paradise alone as Jesus looks into the eyes of his waiting bride he says you've waited long enough come stand here by my side cuz I don't want to live in Paradise alone for the one I love the most is what makes Paradise a home if I must go away that's a price I will pay I don't want to live in Paradise [Music] alone if I must go away that's a price I will pay I don't want to live in Paradise alone I don't want to live in Paradise alone [Music] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah amen anytime the Devil comes and tries to tell you God don't love you just think of a song like that amen hallelujah

want to say to all the mothers amen happy Mother's Day May God richly bless you and I think it was a wonderful quote there that uh brother Brian had read and shared and uh I tell you with that that aspect brother Brandon will say that many many times over he won't necessarily use the um percentage of 98% but we get the point and uh just what an effect that is uh upon when we raise our children in the right atmosphere and brother bham as he brings that down to the scriptures we do what God has entrusted us to do and then God takes care of the rest of it it's just like that Moses Moses couldn't bring the pillar of fire down but Moses could follow the pattern that God gave him saying way with Solomon Solomon couldn't bring amen the shakina in the temple but he could follow the pattern and it was up to God to bring and bring that feeling in that life amen so I'm I'm so thankful amen that God is is Mindful and he's merciful to us amen we just want to say thank you to all of our mothers and my goodness it's just a I'm thankful to have my mother here with me uh to me that's a that's a great blessing and a great privilege and um so I my my brother doesn't have her this time that'll that that'll be next year maybe we can barter that out but uh I want to say I just so appreciate my mom and appreciate everything that uh that she does and uh we just also want to uh say um want to welcome uh brother Bob Wright and sister Lucy amen they're in the back there God bless you good to have you amen that's your brother Willie and sister Sabrina God bless you amen good to have you all here with us amen amen good to have each and every one of you amen I know there's uh there's some different ones out and so we want to continue to keep each one in prayer you heard the request about sister Stephanie and I I tried as best as I could on Friday morning uh trying to send around the text to all that were here that uh um had witnessed everything on Thursday and but the Lord is certainly mindful of our sister and uh so she right now she's dealing actually with the virus and they actually think that might have been what it was that kind of uh caused some of that um but I think it's good but everything else is checked out and checked out real good and you know I I couldn't help but when I walked back to my office on Thursday uh after everything we just had prayer and I just uh looking at everything I thought how Satan has fought our sister in that her getting to the house of God and then the Lord is made way I think it was December or January Brother Richard I think that's what it was when everything kind of got put together and uh for her and um everything she had to go back and reclaim her license and all those things and here she is driving and my mind just went to that you know as children you would be concerned for your your mother right your your parent driving because she drives from Norwalk and so uh she's here on Thursdays and Sundays and I just said Lord you know the need here while the enemy has made a way for our sister to be here and and she wants to be here more than anything anytime I've had the text like when I had to send out a text a few times service is cancelled I get back in capital letters from sister Stephanie [Laughter] no and so uh we just want to continue to hold our sister up in pray PR the Lord will just uh touch her and strengthen her as well amen so we want to look here in the word of the Lord and I'm going to uh try uh something here and hopefully it it works if it doesn't I've got a backup plan here on my on my desk there we go there we go so I'd like to read here in our scriptures from Ruth chapter 2 and uh I want to just kind of take it in this way we've been looking at this thought on the um importance of fellowship and feeding and I I still want to stay around that thought and under the value of obedience um but um I'd like to just look here this morning just really to hone in on the part uh even of of the feeding and really looking at that because it's God that's uh ministering to our lives and the there's an outcome that God has for our life and the outcome and desire that God has for our life there is a pull within our life so it's not something that we are unknown of or where it's something that we uh you know do not feel the pull but we feel the pull because there's something within us and it's God that's ministering to that part that he put within us to bring it forth and then to bring it into full maturity and I think that's the exactly the where all of us want to get to we want to be in that place that God has us to be and so here we come into the scripture here in uh Ruth chapter 2 and where that Boaz has has uh this is in the time some of the first scriptures uh and for sake of time I won't read all of them but just concentrate on verse 14 of whereare that Boaz is speaking to her uh he spoke comfortably he spoke friendly unto her he spoke to her heart and here he speaks and and mentions this to her in verse 14 and Boaz said unto her at mil time Come Thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left amen so let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer here this morning amen I'm certain we have needs all throughout the building and in our hearts and we just want to just put it before the Lord so maybe if you have an unspoken request you'd like to make it known to the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we so thank you Lord for this moment Lord that you have given us Lord thank you Father for the beautiful day outside Lord Lord we're so thankful Lord and God we just Lord are looking to you as we thank you Lord most of all for the spiritual day Lord that we're living in Lord and to walk Lord in this glorious light oh God that our lives have been illuminated Lord by your presence Lord father we we truly Lord want to say thank you dear God thank you Lord for your grace that you've sent to us Lord to find us Lord search us out Lord and bring us to yourself Lord we ask that God that even here this morning I just ask a special blessing Lord upon every mother Lord oh God we could just Lord take and spend lord of the times to know of the sacrifices that's went in Lord to everything Lord oh God the raising of their children Lord oh Lord how we thank you Father in this hour oh God there are still Lord real lord mothers Lord Oh Lord we are thankful for that Lord we're thankful God for what you are the one we realize Lord like your Prophet would place it in a way when he spoke about brother Williams in his passing he he didn't just say he was a father he said he was a real father he didn't just say he was a husband he said he was a real husband and Lord I think Lord in this hour there's no one that can really Define what a real man is what a real woman is what a real father is what a real mother is outside of your presence Lord in our lives Lord oh God how we thank you Father we ask that you would now just Lord help us together as a unit to step aside Lord father you see the things Lord and know what you've placed on my heart and even Lord in the order Lord of how that things Lord that you've moved Lord and Lord help me Lord to just get out out of the way Lord these are things Lord sometimes Lord as we look in it Lord I'm asking that you would give us the understanding and the words Lord oh God to express and to speak Lord that would be edifying Lord God to the body of Believers Lord and oh Father when we would be finished here this morning Lord oh God and we would leave from the presence of one another May Lord our hearts oh God just have been made to burn within us Lord and when we leave from here Lord there's a unction Lord in our hearts oh God and Lord a yielding Lord and just Lord a a giving of ourselves more to you Lord that more of you Lord might be evidenced in our life oh God we just Lord love you and we thank you now Lord we just invite you Lord may you be the speaker and the hearer Lord help us to step aside in jesus' name amen amen God bless you as you're being seated I want to speak on this thought on leadership through feeding you recall in many places in the scripture of where when God had set forth and he gave the ministry and then brother Brandon would um pick this up in the church ages and he would speak of how that God has placed men that he that he has sent to take charge and to lead the church and he says it's not man leading man or man ruling over man but he said the way that that leadership is is it is a leadership through feeding on the word of God because we're not cattle there's a few references in the scripture possibly one I'll get to here today but remember we're not we're not herdsmen uh we're Shepherds and there's a great difference because as a Shepherd it's one that's to lead and a path that's already been made ahead and there's things that we are realizing that it's not we're not driving the the flock of God is not to be driven but it's to be led and you recognize that within it all that God himself he's a gentleman remember brother bam said over and over he's a gentleman God does not come with his presence to intimidate he doesn't come with his presence to condemn but God comes by his presence he'll bring conviction but real conviction will always display Calvary because there's always a way back amen and so it always is bringing forth of what that God has desired and and wants to bring out of our life and so we understand that that part of it that within um of the leading and how that God will lead us and he won't make us do anything but God God will always if there's things that we choose in our own self to bypass and maybe make an excuse for this well as as a child of God if you've really uh if you're ordained as a child of God we have to come around to that point and there's got to be an overcoming of that point in our life as it comes from the new birth to every facet in our life every every step is a step of Victory because the Holy Ghost itself is the gift of God but car character is a victory right so it is step by step of the way there's things that God molds and shapes and brings us into situations that we don't ask to be brought into and it's very uncomfortable to our flesh and our spirit but that also is part of our maturing that's part of us growing and the real growing really it deals with us dying more to oursel and Paul himself would Express in his own life that uh I Pro I protest by your rejoicing that I Die daily so there's a there's a constant dying in our life that's a due to to self and the word of God brings us to that and this is a thing that I'm thankful for as I said moments ago that God will bring us around to certain things you know sometimes when we can look at it in our life and I'm sure we can Fellowship on this point and you might be thinking why am I facing this again sometimes it isn't it isn't just why is this again it's God wanting to further purify Our Lives Hallelujah and bringing us to the realization where in maybe in times past we could say it's this person's fault or it's this fault or it's the if I had been raised differently if I and God is trying to show you and I because when we speak of being Sons and Daughters of God we don't ever want to lose sight of that that's the aim that's the objective it's not that we aren't already Sons and Daughters of God but that's the way that the word comes as the target the aiming point for our lives behold now are we the sons of God so we have a clear trajectory or an Aiming point that that it's in other words it's not a Target that is moving around and you know moving over here you know like we had that in years past you wear mask you don't wear mask and you do this and you do it's not a moving Target God's word has always been fixed am it's always been established but now what happens when the spirit of God comes and he vindicates his word God anoints our eyes to see clearly that Mark that we need to be pressing towards in every in every in every one of our Lives because it is an individual Journey amen so then brother bam is talking here and how can I overcome of why that we come to the house of God and he he first he started out with it talking about we don't just come to Fellowship yet Fellowship is a part of it and we've been kind of touching on that a little bit and we'll dive deeper into it after some time but I it's more than just fellowship and coming to sit around that is important it was encouraging when the prophet could see different ones bring their lunches and going to have a meal together after the service that's 1964 the message shalom but he we're here for more than just Fellowship that's a part of it but we're here this is the main person or the main purpose we come here and we are here for one specific purpose this is the house of correction this is the throne this is the Throne of God and judgment Goes Forth from the house of God and here is where we come together Gather in love with one another as only Christians can love that's right but in here we are under a leadership of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is Among Us and he goes on he says we're here to take Reckoning among us to see where our short places are not my brothers not my sisters all right it's got to be personal personal you see if you're looking at somebody God's leading us where he wants us to feed that's it brother because if you look just at somebody else you're not feeding you're not but we're here to see where our short places are right sir our shortcomings and how can we catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now that that's Grace in that statement yes it is where we are to where we ought to be amen it's God helping us bringing us along sometimes we can we can feel like man I think I'm doing pretty good and I don't think we should walk around negative but it's something that you begin to see when we're talking about even that aspect we're seeing the word working in our lives and it isn't so much that you altogether see it out here but you have that on the inside where there are things that at one time there was a struggle oh yes but now it's a release right there's things that God was dealing with you personally but now it's a release because before it can ever come out here and be manifest in our actions it first of all has to come through a surrendered heart that the character is molded so in other words we don't go through things because it's the right thing to do and then say wellow I'm going to trust my character to be molded by that no it's God working in our lives inwardly and what he does inwardly it'll come outwardly is that the scripture Matthew 6 he that he says enter into your closet pray in secret and he that seeth in secret shall reward thee openly it's deeper than even just prayer time yet prayer is the number one point but it's speaking of a relationship where we're living from behind the veil I'm drawing my strength from behind the veil amen amen amen this is why the prophet would speak to you and I in greatest battle of her fought and say God is calling Abraham's seed to separate yes sir from see taste feel smell hear reasoning conscience imagination why because that's not your real Kindred that's it that's your Kindred by the first birth but when the New Birth has come H you've been tied back in to the tree of life it and it's called us to live a separated life that's it that's it am I'm sure we can truly Fellowship on that that's not an easy doing that's a battle every day it's a battle battle on and on and on our reasoning our imagination our conscience our memory our affection y those are Battlegrounds yes it is is that right yes sir because remember when the soul has been sealed that battle has been won been won true let me let me rephrase it the war has been won that's right it's over that's why brother BR says get that battle killed at the beginning at the beginning but then there remember the mind is no man's land that's right right No Man's Land it it it's what you or I choose to fill it with that's it yes sir you hearing me yes sir no man's land our mind is what we choose to fill it with that's right and whatever you fill it with will determine the strength in your life that's it you can fill it with the Affairs and the cares of this life you can fill it with the pleasures and the things of this life you can f listen God gave you your family to care for but God did not give you your family that it would totally feed or consume your life because you can't be you cannot be an a real true influence without the influence of God solely upon your life you walk by reasoning you walk by imagination you walk by memory well I remember when I was young I remember they did this I remember they did that were not to walk by that everything is to be brought subject to the word love that this is why Christ is to dwell the goal preeminently in our life let me just say this that preeminence ises not something that all of a sudden happens just one night at an altar it begins with a new birth but then it grows and the prophet said the more that will surrender the more he will grow that's it that's right and push out push out push out sir when they crossed into isra or into the land the promised land yes sir did God remove all of their obstacles no sir did God remove all the Giants say it now God never removed those things God says I will do it little by little by little it's a growing it's a growing cuz if not it's all we got to do is cross the Jordan and sit down think about it no we must grow we must grow so there's a leadership through feeding let's let's look here just for a few moments here in the in the scriptures in Ephesians chapter 4 and I want to draw from here for a few moments the scripture said wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth and verse 10 he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things so he has satisfied the the debt through Calvary and now on the Resurrection on the Easter morning the presentation there before the father it's accepted now after the journey for the 40 days with the disciples now as he ascends up and here they are to return back to Jerusalem and to be endued with power from on high for what purpose that he might fill all things all things do you realize that the beginning of him filling all things is him beginning with filling his El people preer yes sir because eventually then in the Millennium the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the Earth the land and sea and sky right then in the future home that City will occupy and then all of its outreaches but his beginning of his victory comes in your life personally that's right and this is why the enemy hates you it's not you as a person or me as a person amen but it is that revelation of Christ working in your life and as you're yielding to the Holy Spirit it is a reminder of the enemy every time he's being put out of your life every inch of ground that's being claimed it is a reminder to him that the promise said this Earth has become the Lord's and his Christ it's a promise that Millennial promise it shall be hallelujah amen so this is a victory this is a victory march of one that when they would enter into a triumphal entry they were giving gifts it was dispensing of that gift let me tell you every every person every believer has an access to the measure of Grace that God has it to you and I I'm talking about the most important gift is the gift of the Holy Ghost everyone Paul says the verse before this a measure of Grace why because we can't Merit it cannot we don't earn it brother Brandon says if God ever sends a Revival it will not because of The Obedience of the people it will be because of God's grace that's right you see it's it's taking it it's not what it's not something that we have done that has been the failure down Through the Ages when man wanted to work through reasoning and help God God doesn't need help he doesn't need help bringing his word to pass all he needs is yielded surrender humble vessels he interprets his own word that's it he brings his word to pass yes sir so it's us yielding that's all it is it's us yielding not yielding that's that's feeding yes sir amen watch and he gave some Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers yes sir God gave all all of them and it was with it with a distinct purpose that's right God laid out the apostles for those who would go and to start a church that's right that's right they're one sent from God Amen that's needed needed this is why brother Brown brings the differences even when he'll speak and uh warning before judgment and he'll deal with those different offices and sometimes we might have our you know we can have our pics oh I just love the evangelist but that's a part of it exactly right evangelist has its part let me just say everyone has their part Pastor has their part yes sir but this is why here in this assembly this is my desire not just to have one facet of the ministry come on yes sir not just over and over the same facet no we need we need a balanced diet yes sir are you hearing me yes sir this is why the prophet could say when he deals with teachers and how teaching he says oh that teacher can just set back under that anointing and what teaching does as it's taking it's taking that word it's positioning the church in their position that's it right there now listen every teacher is different yes sir I I've got I've got many friends that are teachers and everyone is different right there's some you know that they might set back a little bit and and when they're going and my just just move right through that and I always thought oh brother Lonnie Jenkins I I just love what what a gift that was there and and I there's other brothers that I know very well right now that what a gift to be able to just set back underneath that anointing and just to just to teach and and lay that in now I understand sometimes sometimes listen friend let me just make a side note sometimes we have mistaken yes sir the anointing yes sir come on the prophet tells us why C and and why people are so tossed about and after he's preached the message prayer line altar call he comes to the end of that service and he says oh he says here was Jesus he sat down and he Ted and wonderful words proceeded from his mouth he said it never was an anointing like he had and he said what that anointing is is supreme power in control that's it is that right yes sir so anointing is the word coming Upon Our Lives Upon Our Hearts yes sir and God knows what we have need of like for example let me just put it my in terms here I am as a father my children have needed braces and other devices some of the rest you can Fellowship me with me on that you know you can say just open your mouth and let me see the Cadillac you know yes sir but you understand I couldn't put the braces on them right but God had there was someone who was specialized for that that's it that's it so I made sure I get him to that place that specialize that's don't misunderstand me I'm not talking about man here now in the spiritual but I'm talking about God God has it reserved in that way he works and he specializes through a multifaceted approach of five ministerial offices then you have pastors the pastors are those who are are are there to watch over the flock and to minister and out of all of those that are there the pastor is the one that is most like and that of like a father that's right cuz he sees all throughout yeah that's right yes sir father sees when Uncle Joe comes to visit and everybody says Glory Uncle Joe's coming woo man Uncle Joe everybody likes Uncle Joe friends that don't bother me I listen I I want our hearts to be edified that those things don't bother me a bit I want us to be edify I want us to be built up yes sir are you hearing me but you know how it is I know how it is in my family my when their Uncle Brian's coming over my goodness man they're they're ready they their buddies coming over well you know God brings in different parts of the ministry and God does it that way he doesn't have to do it that way have to i' I've told you this over and over I Marvel I said Lord why is it times that here that you lead me over here and Lead me here it don't even have to be across the waters but why even down here over here year years ago I said that but I realize he doesn't have to do that no and I'm not going to come in and say something different than what's already been preached if I do I'm off there you go yes sir because the real true reality is God brings in Ministry they will fall right in that same vein maybe a different perspective but what's God letting you know we're feeding prach we're feeding amen and that's without even any communication that's right what are you preaching what are you I don't to discuss those things I love God has that the Evangelist ball of fire comes in they don't have to worry about come in blaze it up tear it up that's right hand it over here you go here you go I you know I'm defining of what the prophet placed this in the message exactly how he said and God has prophets modern-day preachers God does have that God gave a prophet in this hour that's it preacher the prophet of the Hour come on man is that right God so this and let me just say it like this the ministry of this hour of Ephesians 4 in order to be the ministry of Christ for the bride body it must be washed by the Prophet come it must be anointed you say Washed by the Prophet The Prophet receives the word for this day it must wash away all of our reasonings all of our leaving all of our thoughts why because we do not want to reproduce little miniature Mees we're interested in seeing Christ reproduced and the prophet was a faithful unit that had no seed of his own but it was the original seed the original word being delivered to the Church of the Living God and that's why real true Ministry has no seed of their own that's why we've had the Cults that's why we've had the divisions that's why we've had the the isms why is because of a desire to see themsel in the [Applause] people let me make a quote out of Satan the prophet said he said too many desire to see their own image established in the people's hearts instead of establishing the image of Jesus Christ so hard Hallelujah that's the truth that's the truth am Hallelujah the greatest compliment you can be given is not that you go to brother Samuel Browning's Church the greatest compliment you can be given is is you're a Christian you're a Believer come on man amen amen good hallelujah hallelujah why did he do this for the perfecting of the Saints for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry yes sir for the edifying of the body of Christ now that perfecting this is not that Perfection that comes by the blood that's right because only Christ himself can perfect you that's it by his own blood brother Brams asked this question repeatedly regarding this scripture that's right and brother Brown continues as he points back because this perfecting here deals with a complete maturing that's it a complete Furnishing it's true God brings his word it is the word that brings that birth in our life that's right but this is the reason that the ministry is not only to show and to point to where that Perfection is already made a way for you and I to attain but it's for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ praise the Lord you know as a Bible reader anywhere you go in the scripture when Paul even dealt with the gifts and other things when he had correct in the church he brought it back to listen anything that's done it ought to be about edifying the body yes sir that's it that's right it shouldn't be about individual come on preacher it should never be any anything we share should never draw attention to ourselves right that's that's a sign that's something something's wrong right understand hallah when brother bradam gave testimony listen these are these are indiv listen the person uh brother Hoover when he Brother David Hoover was here his grandmother who never she was the nanny that cared for him she never did see the message but there's one thing that she pointed out watch it she said when brother random gave testimony he always gave testimony as one who was a bystander I was there when I saw him do this yes sir that's right yes sir are you hearing me it's in the message why because listen listen friends these are More Than Just Words it's because as a body of Believers God does not want us hanging on to somebody else like a totem pole God wants you to have a relationship with God that's it and you've got a connection with God that's it is that right well I got to go see so and so I got to see what so no God listen friends he's right there with you Hallelujah I hope that don't offend you but listen friends I I don't I I don't want you hanging on me for everything if you feel to call me call me but I I want you tied in so deep in Jesus Christ you've got a confidence that who you are as a son and daughter of God that you can go to him and you've got an open connection and he's there to lead you and guide you I'll pray with you anything you call and say Hey Brother Samuel I'm thinking about this decision well let's pray together so what are you saying well you know it just same way with your children the objective even with my children our children same way it was with yours and would be with yours I don't want them depending on me the rest of their life tell it preacher so there's times seeing where they're at I can't make them get over here that's even where each of them have their own shortcomings that's where prayer comes in yes sir for the needs in their life areas that need to be picked up in their life as well as to help them to minister to them to speak to them am Hallelujah that's the same way as a body yeah that's the same way the same way that's sir prise Lord oh my now notice here in till we all what why until when till when till when till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ think about that so this work of the ministry is to go on until what until we come to the unity not of a faith but the faith yes sir I hope you under with me now yes sir the faith is the Holy Ghost the faith is the love of God the faith is Christ in you come on listen coming to that Unity of faith is not just born again and we're done but coming to a place to where that the faith that that Unity among the body Unity with the word first and then Unity with the body that means more than my feelings my ideas my thoughts Christ and his body means more that's coming to Unity of faith H amen Glory Hallelujah and of the knowledge of the Son of God it's coming to the remember we've been invited to have our character molded is that right that's right brother brah takes that message over and over identification yes sir he'll take his text Philippians 2 let this mind be in you yes sir he'll deal with that character and he's dealing with that mind and he's speaking we are invited to have our character molded that's right don't make us amen have it we're invited I thank God for an invitation yes sir to The Potter's House yes sir and I'm here to tell you he's still working on me yes sir there's areas in my life and in your life where he's had to break down oh yes sir and he's had to say this is molded wrong I need to mold it according to how I want hallelujah oh God help us to have commas and not periods Jesus amen we're we we're we are ordained to be conformed to the image of his dear son that's what we're ordained to amen you love him yes sir notice unto a perfect man this is complete a completion yes sir this is the Perfection not a Perfection to where well I'll never make a mistake again oh no h you know I'll never fail again no no you're looking for the wrong thing thank you Preacher Brother BR would tell us I believe in 1951 Believers F this he said don't ever try to perfect this thing he said you're trying to perfect the wrong thing wrong he said is get this on the inside and he said when you got this on the inside it'll be a constant War until the day that you are set free but greater is he that is in you that's why the new birth is essential it's not an option without the new birth there's no growing into His Image his likeness there's no Rapture are you hearing me but with the new birth brings us into a place now where God is working in our life as we yield and surrender to bring us to full maturity don't you love him Hallelujah unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ what God has allotted for Luther's day is not enough for this day the measure has increased that that's that's good but as the measure has increased so has the grace to perform yes sir what's what God requires God provides the grace when God makes a promise it's God committing himself and when God announces and declares this is the time of the promise God is announcing he is on the scene to perform his word like he did through Mary yes sir that's right yes sir be it unto me according to your word according to Thy word not according to how my mama s it not according to how my daddy not according to how my P not according not according no according to Thy word and thy word is that revealed that word that revealed word of God that Rama of God Jesus hallu are you with me for what what purpose that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro jesus carried about by every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men come on now and craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive see when no more children work with it preacher why this is the purpose that we grow up you see God don't come around and just tell us grow up uhuh yet he does yes sir there's times times where he has to bring us back to milk truths yes sir amen yes sir but you know what he's not ashamed to call you brother sir he's not ashamed he listen let me tell you something God is not one that disciplines his children out of embarrassment no sir come on preacher God don't do that come on God don't look oh they're embarrassing oh this is just this is embarass and and we get a whiping because he's he's embarrassed no that ain't no sir not God you know if we do something and embarrass God it's kind of like when we were little and said we when we get home we we'll talk when we get home you you almost want to say let's find a room right now right now let's do the talking right now so I can enjoy the rest of this cookout picnic you know what I'm talking about don't you I had them many times don't even remember what I ate on some of them picnics see God's not going to let us get by no sir and I'm glad for that aren't you yes I am he'll he'll speak his word and it's up to you and I to take it but if we won't take it he will correct us why lest we be condemned with the world that's it preer thank you Lord God's determined I love that God's determination for you to make it is greater than your own will no doubt you've given up many times God's never given up he already saw you come on as a champion before the foundation of the world that's why the sons of God shouted for Joy they were looking at their victory in the Lamb of God he's my victory he's my Deliverance he's my salvation he's my all allise the Lord keep your eyes on him and you'll see Victory it'll lead you to victory amen than H we may not toss to and fro not not governed by our emotions and how we made up and we responded in the past and we responded this way and respond not governed anymore by those things to realize wait a minute it's a Son of God on the inside the Lord how does that happen by the revealing of the knowledge of the Son of God yes sir God revealing his character that's what the opening of the seals was all about the prophet would tell us in 1962 I believe it's a message all things he said when the seals come open it'll be the revealing of God's Own nature yes Hallelujah because this this is why the prophet could say in the Easter seal in 65 it's the quickening power the opening of these seals is the releasing of the quickening power to the Church of the Living God what is the quickening power it's the latter rain it's the maturing rain it's a harvest rain and he says your attitude towards it will determine if it does you any good or not right I hope you understand what I'm saying here as he's bringing it it's not just a one snapshot deal of well I believe the message the quickening power is at work the prophet said it quickens us from death unto life and keeps on quickening quickening quickening quickening all the way up to the change of the body it's our attitude towards the quickening of the word this is what Ruth's being invited to at M time yes sir remember Bo has Bo hasn't laying threats on her uhuh Bo has not telling Ruth Ruth you better be here oh God when Church time comes you better be here watch it wow she never came in into the land because of that in the first place in the first place and he recognized that when he began speaking to her that's why she said thou has spoken to me friendly and that phrase means to my heart Hallelujah the one who's drawn me where I couldn't understand and gave me the strength to forsake my friends and family let me tell you something what God's given you strength to forsake thus far you'll continue to give you the strength to forsake everything else yes sir what I do just stay in the field keep keep keep feeding keep feeding keep feeding he'll give you the strength that's right but notice speaking the truth in love that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ notice that we might grow up into him in all things I say all things God let everything let let my life be growing in all things you know it be like a weightlifter and all they do is you know they just all they do is concentrate on their on their arms and they got these little chicken legs I never was privileged with chicken legs I never had chicken legs you know I think I was born wearing men's clothing might been shorts but nonetheless but you know what if what if you know we we've all seen them kind of things where guys and they got these little chicken legs and they walking around you know like this God's body is a body that is proportionally balanced this word comes to balance us not inflate us in a certain area and leave another area deficient sir why God's determined he's going to have Eagles sometimes now sometimes sometimes just like people who work out they don't like certain days of the week all right all right they'll do them but they don't like them listen there's things that God draws our attention to it's not real happy uhuh but he draws our attention to it because it's areas where we need to feed and be exercised in and is Will yield then the other parts of our life will benefit from see this is why our lives were not meant listen this is why a real true word birth brings you to your rest is in the word in the word not in a gift not in a certain area of your life it brings it to where on the inside the amen is dwelling there and can say Amen to every word of God it brings us to balance yes sir is that right that's right Hallelujah notice from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth might there's a whole bunch in that scripture but according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so sorry I didn't put that up there I want to I want to look at this right here just a moment but this is what I've been ministering on right here the Lord I don't think we probably even have uh the Las in there but I I I could we could focus on all these things on the side but I don't want to focus so much on these things on the side of the four anointings all this pertains to church age and all your different Church age Messengers but I want you to see that every age had to come under the word for their age had to and God would build them to the measure they were called to am are you with me amen so in here in the beginning of that faith of that part Faith remember brother Brandon when he actually Drew this the one you have in your book statue of a perfect man brother Bram when he drew that right underneath right there brother brandham drew that little that little part he had there and brother Bram actually had written in Born Again Y and so when you recognize that remember brother B will go on this is why you can't preach statue of a perfect man just from that message you got to follow it all you got to take the thread all the way through all the way through up to 65 yes sir yeah brother Bram will tell us over and over he says these these virtues he says if you're trying to do it he said then it's just like a blackbird trying to put peacock feathers in yes sir then he picks that same thing up over and over Blasphemous name then clear in the 1965 things that ought to be you see it's like this the seed that when you were born with that seed that seed came there in you that's right let me tell you what that seed is you know you can take you and I and take an apple how many like apples yes I do too with oats brown sugar but you can take the Apple brother Dave and you can count the seeds in it but only God can take a seed and count the apples than about the trees the leaves all that can come out of one of those seeds only God can do that only God knows what's to be brought forth out of your life and out of my life under his presence we're from Glory under glory god brings forth first shoot second shoot on and on and on all the way up to a fully matured son and daughter of God he knows what lays in us he even knows the tests and trials that we he by his infinite wisdom will have to permit and bring us through in order to mold and shape and reduce more of our own self that more of him might step forth hallelujah it's God working with his children so every every one of these ages they had to come through in their own personal birth and grow to that measure right now when you come here even into the last age that brotherly kindness and how that notice there's the Capstone at the top yes sir we're under a Capstone Ministry but you remember when brother brandham Drew this in uh on the the drawing that he made brother Bam put that little place right underneath there brotherly and holy spirit is that right yes sir and if you recognize that in this hour we we come under the word of this hour we're not out we listen we're not out of the lady oan age the bright age is not a separate Age The Bride age is the coming of the Lord in his fullness the fullness of his spirit in a bride body that's it yes sir is that right yes sir it's where the two the rejoice and be glad for the marriage of the Lamb has come right sir it is the revealing of this word in this hour that leads us into the Capstone that's it that's it right there hallelujah amen we grow up into him in all things about it and if you look at every one of these virtues that are here praise God you don't just sit around the house and say I need more patience no you don't say I need more virtue every one of these I want you to look at them closely every one of them are produced from dying to self yes sir from ding adversity strikes situations come and your patience grows well my patience isn't where son it's not about you comparing yourself man it's it's you and God you and God when brother so and so said my patient weak ignore brother so and so brother so and so's got a problem with Temperance self-control the tongue woo preach brother preach man but we grow in all things I love that is that right brother Brandon would call it regarding Temperance he said and blasphemous names he said oh God crown my soul with self-control yes sir so here we grow that that little place we grow brotherly kindness what are we doing crossing the Jordan into the promised land we all the promises lay that's power is that right yes sir now this whole thing here I I wish I could dwell more on it what what this whole thing it speaks of is it speaks of an individual believer oh God individually you're growing that's true but there's got to be a birth in the beginning sir then our faith grows and virtue grows and and you keep growing that's it this is why listen you're let me just reiterate that you're not comparing yourself to someone else what we should see in one another that should stir up one another it should be Christ Christ Hallelujah don't aim to be like somebody else because you might be mistakenly your focus on their temperament how God has made them and not really seeing the Christ that's there behind their life because God's made you in a certain way as a body that's compacted together where we're all not going to worship the same we're all not going to preach the same we're all we're all different but the one thing that is the continuity is his life in the body I love that this also speaks of the body of Jesus Christ the bride body the people that's been called of the Gentiles out of the Gentiles for his namesake because God remember he said Upon This Rock I will build my church build he's the foundation stone and zerubabel shall bring forth The Headstone with shoutings of Grace Grace unto it and the Church of the Living God God where it's to stand in this hour it comes to a place to where the very Ministry of Jesus Christ is reproduced again reproduced yes sir stay with me now I'm not just talking of Malachi 4 uh because a real fulfillment of Malachi 4 is where that Jesus Christ would be reproduced not just on a platform not just on a t not just in a book but in individual lives to where our lives are servants unto Jesus Christ Philippians 2 let every man they receive this mind let it be in you think it not robbery my God who being in the form of God took on the form of a servant a servant means one who surrenders himself to another's will come on God used the messenger to deliver the message that's right and I'm going to tell you it got through oh this message is to live and it is living let me tell you friends what good would it do if it's just a platform or a church message this message come to live inside and make you and I individual living Tabernacles let me use the prophet's word powerhouses of the glory of [Applause] God we're God's glory fills Hallelujah I want his glory to fill my life areas of my life that is knocking on yes Lord I Surrender Lord let me die to myself that the glory might move into that area that's Sons and Daughters of God that are having a courage to look face to face with the word and say be it unto me Lord hallelujah this is also speaks of that New Jerusalem which the characteristic being lived out in a bride body right now right now what John saw coming down was a dove in the Book of Revelations John the Divine saw a city come on man it had occupants right oh yes sir it was a city as is a bride is prepared and adorned for her husband you see the whole building has been going on down through the ages are you hearing me now down Through the Ages has laid the platform for right now right nowe this how we're not there's not another message to come we're we're this is it it the seventh angel has already sounded and that's where the call is go to the angel whose foot is upon the land and on the sea come on the one that you have saw the one that the seventh angel was revealing the seventh angel said you're not feeding on me you're feeding on the unfailing body we of the son of [Applause] man if all that you see is brother Bram you're not seeing all of it that's it that's it job that was a one first one who come to maturity that's right right that's right but it says there's more to come to maturity not more prophets uhuh no no don't need it not even necessarily more signs and wonders no sir but where we Christ is living in a life daily daily daily Hallelujah that's a Victorious Life am that's what this message come to produce adopted Sons and Daughters of godall speaks of all of this he's he's he's building us he's working in our lives now some of you appreciate this next picture maybe you won't but I remember when my wife and I were there and um brother Bram would take this stay with me now I'm going to try to bring it down brother br will take this I want you to think of this message things that ought to be yes sir and he will take this message and brother Brandon will continually he'll drop this in and then he'll come back and bring it right back around again and he's dealing with I want you to think of this now I want to be very slow and intentional with this brother bram's dealing with first of all that seed on the inside that's crying out for life okay then when that birth is come because there's things needed in order to bring that birth about then that life on the inside of you that's growing I know our flesh grows sometimes our spirit May grow weak but the real thing that's that God is bringing forth is that character on the inside that's it that's it you know we're living in a season of planting right you're going to go to the nursery maybe some of you already have and you're going to go and you're going to pick things out of the Nur a tree a bush or your little patunas and what you're going to do is you're going to take them out of the packet and put them in soil around your home that's called transplanting that's right the prophet said in the future home our character will be transplanted right so it's God bringing it to a place to where he says no longer fit molding is done come home right Hallelujah come home and it's a transplanting of what he himself has been developing through our yielding is that feeding I want you to think how brother Bram says just look at the picture there as I'm going to read these he says an expectant mother on Earth today that Mother's body craves for certain things that's right now I will be honest my wife craved for things through our sons and uh when for Paul She craved buttercream white cake yes that's all right that's all right cuz I love buttercream icing and white cake I probably look like I was the one going to have the baby after so long a time but you know but a mother's baby craves a mother's body begins to Crave she's so connected with that with that life on the inside when she begins to Crave brother br will say it he says what it is there's something lacking in her body where she'd begin to Crave certain things and brother Bram talks about you know in his family he said they were pooring things and he said you know before the baby was born mother would crave something and dad would just scrape up what he could to go get it whatever it was sometimes those those combinations sound kind of funny like for my mom I guess that's the I tell all the family secrets for my mom it was for me it was chocolate milk and Doritos just so happened that I like chocolate milk and I like Doritos but I don't but I know it's not the case for everybody and we were talking about that with some others you know brother the Shane Lily the other night but I want to say it in this way that there what was it it wasn't necessarily my mom's not a junk food eater she don't like that stuff but it was something she was craving that's right and she it was something that would connect and you know call out for remember brother br will de that with deep call to the deep and speak of that but there's a craving and he said they try to get it so that baby I want you to listen will be born as perfectly and happy as possible when there's something needed the mother gives witness to it I want you to catch what he's saying now right now that being connected even having listen that seed before it's quickened that's right there's something in there that's calling out for reality that's right you can try remember brother bam takes us in The Thirst 1965 you can try to satisfy it with worldly fashion try to satisfy with things of this world can try to SAT but it won't satisfy but there is a calling that's going out is that right but it's it's to satisfy there's something to be satisfied there's a craving brother BR says when there's something that's needed for that oncoming child listen this he says now why we have revivals asking a question why do we assemble together and he goes on to talk about with people he says Pentecostal women and he talks about about how they're dressing and and the way that they're doing and he said that's not the real Bible Way and he says these things men wearing shorts and everything and that's an Abomination to God he said but why does the Holy Spirit keep crying out it knows there's something lacking there yes sir see you see it's not the holy spirit it's not God harping on things oh no what it is that life on the inside it's calling out for reality and God is hearing the call of one of his children beneath the darkness beneath all the gun beneath all the mck and the Holy Spirit is speaking to that seed yes sir yes sir when Moses stood there in Egypt God told Moses he said you stand before pharaoh and say let my son go that he might serve me you'll never find those words repeated to Pharaoh's face that's right but that message the whole message the whole message was to let my son go that's why it's not just a book or a take it's a take the whole word of God the whole word of God is let my son go let my daughter go that they may serve [Applause] me Hallelujah he says it shows there's something lacking there we must be in the full stature of Jesus Christ we must be Sons and Daughters of God we must act like God's children amen you love him let's just stop there let's stop there may God continue to give us Grace brother BR talks about the little boy he goes on and things that ought to be I I am closing I just I want to read this point before that little little baby is born it's craving for some kind of vitamin the mother will reach out and say Dad I want a watermelon there's something that can reach out in your life as God deals personally with your heart personally that's right and you reach out and you ask God lord I need this Lord I need the Holy Ghost I need more of you Lord I I need to die in this area of my life I need more of you see it's it's it's it's expressing how would the daddy how would the daddy Brianna go ahead and give me number two how would the daddy know what to get Mama now God knows you and he knows me doesn't he that's right that's why sometimes we can sit right here and you think man it's like some it's like they've been sitting in my living room in my prayer closet right is that right yes sir but you see when you're praying you're being honest with God lord I've got a need and what it is it's God himself that's making you aware of that need that's in your life that's right you could listen to me you couldn't desire it unless he already put the desire there that's right and but God remember he moves as we will yield and ask that's right is that right ask and it shall be given knock and it shall be open so the ways that God will work and I need this and Lord I need this see it becomes personal it's just like right here in the service like this things that where God can be dealing so personally lives that it might be things to where God's working with the heart of a man to be a real man that's right be a real husband be a real father real mother so forth then God working with another life of Lord I needed I I need you to go deeper I want more than just a a knowledge that's it I I want a reality Lord I I I need maybe in your life Lord I I need I need a real sanctification in my life I need a real cleansing Lord maybe in her life they said Lord I I I need more of you I'm seeing too much of Samuel I need more of you Lord give me Grace To Die to myself Lord give me Grace I don't want to I don't want to resist the word I want to yield I want to yield I want to yield and watch how brother brm will say this this last part and he says how much more abler is the Creator to get what we have need of and he said if we know he he's preparing us a body to live like his own glorious body if we want to live there is something in us that calls to live and there is something in us that calls to do right then God watch this then God will call somebody on the platform or the pull pit that will preach the absolute truth why is that man preaching what he's preaching cuz there's a call that's going out to want to be right and God hears the call of his children is that right now watch this if you're a real child of God then you begin to cry out God take it away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me hallu Hallelujah I say thank you Lord thank you Lord when the word's pointing out things in my life Maybe it's something that after I leave the service and maybe a brother has spoke maybe it's even something that God has allowed me to look across on a quote May maybe it's through a message that I've heard and all of a sudden that quote that scripture it it just it moves to such a place and you realize Lord I need help amen circumcise me Lord I want to be cut away from my own thinking Lord I want to be cut away from my own ideas Lord I want to be so cut away from Samuel to where it's nothing but a Son of God brother Samuel do you believe that's possible yeah we're pressing towards that we're pressing towards that sure we're going to have to bear with this the whole time but remember this is not your ruler that's right listen friends remember remember when we speak and we quote the scriptures behold now are we the sons of God stand like men and women that's right when situations arise don't pull back come to previous actions don't pull back to previous behaviors that's a time to as the Bible said quit be ye like men stand up in that moment how do I stand up by humbling ourselves because the Way Up Is Down Lord I Surrender myself I'm not going this is not going to continue on I'm not going to Proclaim in one moment I'm a Son of God and then revert to acting like a son of so and so come on man if I'm a Son of God I'm a son of God if you're a Son of God you're a Son of God if you're a daughter of God you're a daughter of God what are you saying brother Samuel that you have Authority or jurisdiction that's right it's not coming it's here amen it's here I say Lord let us rise let us rise and shine our light has come the light to show up every Avenue throughout our lives yes sir and I say throughout this Brandon you can go ahe and take it off I say throughout every bit of this God's here and he's working Amen to bring lives into Grace Grace is working to bring you into Grace then when you're in Grace then you grow in it that's right you grow in it that's right so all through throughout even the building those streaming so forth God's working and we want to be very very very sure if there's a call within your heart and here God would take a man whether it's myself another brother doesn't matter the vessel that's right it's that you recognize God's speaking there you go and God's speaking according to the needs in your life that's why brother Bram says he said do you recognize the seriousness of coming to the house of God he said don't look at the messenger pay attention to his message it's what God is calling us to and I tell you what I feel that call oh yes Hallelujah you know that call from the other side it won't it won't allow me to get complacent come on preacher it won't allow me to get complacent the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost has come it connects you into your theophany that's right it connects into that word body because it's that call from the other side that's calling you to Perfection that's right that's why brother BR says when you have left the other thing recognize this to be Eagle food then you've heard from your theophany what he it's finally recogniz wait a minute there's a call there you go from the other side let me just say it very simply God dealing with your heart here this morning whatever it is it's a craving on the inside yes let him be the satisfier because only he can only he can you can try to satisfy with so many other things but only he can satisfied let me tell you something and that that that is dealing with the new birth that's even after the New Birth has come nothing else will satisfy it listen you could study to your blue in the face studying and studying and studying will never take the place of dying to yourself never never never it's yielding it's surrendering it's submitting it's humility it's humbling ourselves in God's presence I tell you if if there's something in your heart that's calling out for more of God God speaking to your life I say thank you Lord yes sir circumcise circumcise me Lord maybe it's from worldly Fashions maybe it's worldly desires ask him Lord you know what my heart is my desire is to be free lordu and Lord how you've sent this and let it be known this morning I Want to Be Free Lord circumcising Brother Samuel is that all it takes believing yeah believing if you believe brother bam says as soon as you believe really believe really believe he said there is released to you Faith that's needed to begin to Fly Above those things exactly what he said amen hallelujah you love him why don't we just go to him in prayer and let's just each and every one let's just pray in our own way as we go collectively Before the Throne of God here this morning why don't you just let's just talk to him he's the one to bring forth out of our life as we will surrender Heavenly Father Lord Jesus you know every need Lord father you you're the one who knows being the Eternal one you know the end from the beginning Lord you know Lord all about our lives Lord even when there were or the things that begin to Crave and I think Lord that I remember even when you started in my life were things Lord that even when I was still was coming on from college Lord that first year but there was a desire Lord in my heart that began to rise up I want reality I want reality I don't want this life anymore Lord Jesus perhaps there's one here this morning that maybe they didn't just exactly the same words but maybe Lord in their mind Lord is they've set maybe in service and meetings and other places but father just even right here this morning that they would recognize Lord that it's responding Lord to that craving that Lord is there in their life there's a craving that Lord that they didn't put there I never put that there that desire you put there but Lord I pray that God may they receive Grace Lord to open their hearts and Lord to pour out before you and Lord God to ask of you this is where Lord the feeding they Lord we can't look to feed somewhere else Lord you bring us the word that we are at this moment that Lord that we're to feed on what we have need of It's Always a paradox to me how that Lord even if it was only two people that Lord we would be ministering to but how that you minister to A diversity of needs Lord throughout the building Lord through hearts and lives and Lord there's lives Lord here this morning Lord hearts and lives Lord that we've crossed over lord into the promised land and Lord we we find ourselves Lord God as Sons and Daughters of God Lord God we want to have our eyes set upon the goal Lord that goal Lord is adopted Sons and Daughters of God to be fully adopted Lord not just born but adopted I pray that Heavenly Father you've given us Grace Lord sometimes there's things in our lives that we've had to come right back around I know I have Lord and I've had to repeat certain testings Lord I realized that the repeating of those testings it wasn't because I was special it was because there was too much Samuel too much Samuel you'll never Lord you don't come by and kill us no but I think as it was in Gethsemane you never drugged the lamb the lamb was led and right there at Calvary was really a manifestation of a victory that took place while the Son of God was alone in prayer oh God help us to see that our real Victory I believe Lord sometimes we let Escape out of our hands where the real Victory lays and it's really not it's not even just in just prayer alone or or having what we call prayer time because Lord if we never get beyond the realm of these senses we can come right back out Lord with the same feelings but help us Lord help us realize it's not us so much Lord of trying to press and pry our way in but to realize oh God it's surrendering it's surrendering like your Prophet would tell his little nephew c one was a Catholic he had that book and he had prayed those prayers things didn't happen come to pass and he threw it in fire brother Brandman spoke to him and said what it is he said you're praying wrong he said we should never pray to change God's mind his mind don't need no changing but it's to change our mind Lord I'm sure that's I found that to be the truth Lord hallu yeah it's it's taken years lord it's taken time but to realize Lord God I've witnessed you do it but it's something of how that you bring it Lord to where we can actually see what it is Lord God to where it's our will being surrendered but that's nothing that's foreign to you you so subjected yourself to become one of us taking upon the form of man likeness of sinful flesh great is the mystery of godliness oh Father right there in the garden it was wrestled out your Prophet would use the terms in the church Church ages he was contending with himself Lord that's who we contend with is ourselves we have to wrestle through Lord our own will and we still have it just as Lord there in Gethsemane nevertheless not my will but thine will be done help us Lord I pray help us Lord God throughout this building Lord here this morning Lord my hands are up Lord God I'm asking Lord God for divine strength Lord help us Lord I pray Lord realizing the responsibility even within the ministry realizing responsibility Lord as parents realizing Lord the responsibility Lord when we look where we're standing in this age the final verse of Hebrews 11 is they without us should not be made perfect complete it must come must be that Ministry reproduced I don't believe it's something we're looking for I believe it's right here Lord but it's true it's just like you told us through your Prophet it happens in such a simple way that it's overlooked how many seen a AR Noah building that Ark overlooked it why because your Prophet told us there was other boats being constructed in that hour but only one was God constructed Lord help us help us father help us to grow Lord help us to die to ourselves that more of you might grow within us Lord help us to yield and died to ourselves daily lord it's things as you lead us to feed on your word help us Lord I pray through tests and trials when they come Lord adversities Lord just like those virtues of the Statue of a perfect man is as we go through tests and trials Lord Jesus help us help us Lord may you Lord God I pray bring every life to birth may you continue Lord God I've Got Confidence Lord there would not be one Lord God name on that Lamb's Book of Life that'll miss it Lord that craving that desire that's there Lord and you're continuing to mold and shape Lord God our lives more and more into your image Lord help us help us to get out of the way Lord we don't want to stay Lord as little children in every Lord in this thing and that thing but help us Lord that we might be well balanced Sons and Daughters of God we love you and we thank you Father in Jesus name amen amen you

Saturday we have the fellowship luncheon uh is every everything they're not here I guess I think everything's okay with that uh everything's lined up with that already say it again okay sisters that pick up the pans in the back okay so what whatever the pans what you signed up for um also the email there's an email that went out with some different things on it as well here for the meeting uh remember on Sunday Sunday will be the two services on Sunday and um just thankful to have brother Wendell here with us and uh brother Wendell just uh just a wonderful brother wonderful Ministry uh I I got a chance to listen when he ministered there in Virginia and even though the streaming was all cut up I was broke up and I told Brother Sean he was apologizing for I said don't apologize it was good I could go right through it it was really really good amen what what he ministered amen I thought the whole really the whole meeting the continuity was so so wonderful how the Lord brought that around and um but we just I'm so thankful to have brother wend here with us and God just laid it upon our heart to have him and um so I want you to I want to I want to just say this to you um I want you just to think of that word throughout the week on expectation and um if you think back to the part of that quote I read out of things that are to be when brother brandham he just asked the question where it says why why do we need revivals and brother brandom answer he's posing that question the why that's needed is because there's Cravings in the body and I tell you what I I pray that throughout this right here that our hearts even as we get through this week don't just come to Friday service or this weekend empty-handed that's right but come to it and really just be in prayer throughout the week really be diligent and in prayer let me tell you the atmosphere is not brought by the man who's preaching no sir the atmosphere is not brought by the organ or by the piano the atmosphere is created by hearts that are in one Accord with God it's calling out to God brother Bram tells us he said when you taken a man that's anointed a walk in a congregation that's prayed up and expecting he said it's unlimited what God will do that's right and I'm going to tell you there's needs right here in our own assembly God allows us and puts a burden on our heart to have the meetings I say let's just come under such an expectation let me tell you do you know how you get under expectation I don't mean to keep you but it's a separate thought altoe when they would go to visit Spurgeon where Spurgeon preached and ministered they came there they didn't see anybody sitting up here and Spurgeon when they showed up they said hey where where's where's the Revival at Spurgeon pointed to the Boiler Room 400 people packed in the basement of the church Spurgeon said you want to know the success is through prayer that's Spurgeon called it the power room and that's why I say what what will create that expectation in our hearts just prayer even as you're at work remember you to pray you don't got to close your eyes that's right you can there'll be times of that but just be in prayer Lord just come Lord in these meetings if there's anything that's out of line in your heart or your life just make make it right just say Lord I want you to have your way in this me there's hearts and lives Lord to be touched I want to be drawn closer sir I want to be drawn closer and I tell you we we come within that because there's undoubted there's going to be others coming with other needs yeah hallu but I can tell you this I'm asking God to meet every single need you'll not take one ounce or less than him one bit to meet every single need to fill every heart with the Holy Ghost and refill hearts and lives right amen that's right I say god let's be under expectation let's be in prayer even when you're on the job driving all throughout just be in prayer it takes some time it takes some extra time to get away in prayer and Lord just want to hear from you amen our heavenly father thank you Lord for this moment that you've given us thank you for your word thank you for your presence Lord thank you for ministering to our needs Lord father as we turn Lord even our hearts and we look to shut ter Lord the meetings Lord in this coming weekend we're asking God that you would move in a very special way Lord I think many times when the prophet he would take Services when the congregation was getting ready Lord to have a real meeting and he spoke of the effects of what it was when people begin to really come under expectation and those meetings on the Holy Ghost were ministered and and the prophet came around and said the reason the effect in these Services was because of your Consecration and sincerity and praying up then he would speak in his own life when he would preach that message images of Christ and he said while the Tabernacle is having a Revival I want to have one too said I want more of the Holy Ghost to take over more William Brown Lord God we're asking Lord that you would pour out of your spirit Lord take the man of God Lord take every one of our hearts Lord that even now Lord that father throughout the week daily Lord and just to be a part Lord that God of a surrendered part heart to you Lord that you can move Lord move in these Services Lord move in these meetings Lord we need meetings like this Lord we need meetings like this These are times that like is spoke in the Book of Ruth handfuls of purpose Lord we need moments Lord as you come by to strengthen Lord to encourage to fill with the Holy Ghost Lord to refill lives Lord to encourage Lord to heal the sick to move Lord according to your word Lord among your children Lord I pray that God you'll meet every single need fill every single heart that comes Lord with the Holy Ghost refill Lord Our Lives Lord I pray with your spirit Lord oh God I pray you'll just move in a very special way Lord grant it Lord I pray even as we press through this week Lord knowing the enemy Lord would want to try to set every obstacle before us Lord even right now we join our hearts together to pray for the weather for next Saturday Lord God you see Lord the desire for your children to come together Lord and to Fellowship Lord God with one another I pray heavenly father that you would drive the weather back lord you see the attempts Lord that's been made throughout the months Lord to even secure backup facilities Lord but father you're in control Lord and Lord Jesus we are looking to you Lord that you'll move Lord on behalf of your children Lord in every way we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen why don't you shake hands with one another as you're being dismissed [Music] in my life Lord be glorified be glorified in my life oh be glorified today in my home Lord be glorified be glorified home Lord be glorified today in my life in my life Lord be
