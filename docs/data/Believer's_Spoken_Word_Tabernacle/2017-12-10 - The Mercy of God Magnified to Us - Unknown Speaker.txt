mission offering as they're coming you brother Brian made mention of the announcement weeks in and out by way of email that brother George Smith will be here with us on January 11th and 12th and I know that that's a Thursday in a Friday and that's what the George was was able to work out and there's just some plans that we have for those services that I'll go into some details with you later some things that just have on my heart and I believe would be a great benefit to us as a congregation so if you can upon your calendars pencil that in on January 11th Thursday night then on January the 12th a Friday night as well I believe that God will he always rewards for sacrifice a lot of things that you know in in our lives it's always the the whole walk as a Christian it's a sacrificial walk but it's not something that when it's of a sacrifice you know something's not a sacrifice if there is a resentment in it you know the meaning for the it is complaint it's not a sacrifice but because remember a sacrifice is what has to be offered unto God and when the worshiper would wall wart wouldn't surrender that sacrifice there were certain characteristics that must be met so the worshiper had to do diligence to find a sacrifice that would fit what God had called for him and with his diligence to do that and present what God had called for it showed his thought his concern of God and for his own soul you believe that so when we look at things in our lives we understand that there are many times that we have sacrifices and things to make but let us in all things we want God to receive the glory so let's just bow our heads here father we are just so thankful Lord that you have given us another opportunity another day Lord truly Lord our our desire is to be with you enoyed father in that were still here upon this earth in these earthen vessels then Lord the next best place that we could be outside of being there with you is to be gathered with you with your children with your feet Lord in this place Lord oh god we assembled here Lord as your prophets that let us gather here as we will gather over there let it be a reflection now Lord you see all of the preparations and everything that's been made Lord for this moment Lord for us to be able to come together Lord we are mindful to understand and to know that is all because of the great sacrifice that you made Lord Oh God to recognize that it's not Lord just the sacrifice of Calvary but the sacrifice that was given father with every prophetic utterance that Lord would announce your coming Lord it was sacrifice that was involved more lives that were set aside on to you Lord and moved by the Holy Ghost Oh God may our our hearts our lives every one of us in every part of our lives be so consumed today Lord in that sacrifice father we ask they would give Lord from their hearts Lord I pray that God you'll take and multiply and directed Lord to the need and the desire Lord that it is taken in Lord we pray father we just commit this service Lord all of the needs Lord God that have been mentioned here Lord we lift them up Lord before your throne once again and we want to say Lord that we thank you Lord that indeed you are we have found you to be Lord the high priest that is touched by the feeling of our infirmities Lord we love you Lord Jesus have your way we pray now in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah let's just turn in the word of God here to Ephesians chapter 1 and we want to read a few verses scripture this morning just three four verses of Scripture and we'll let you have your seat in verse 3 of Ephesians 1 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he have made us accepted in the beloved I'd like to speak this morning on a thought the mercy of God magnified to us may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated in the message the believers position in Christ but the Branham is quoting as though someone would say I thought the spiritual blessings only come the fellowship the Holy Spirit only come on pinnacle this is thirty two years later that's the blessing of the Ephesians church the Gentile church blessing us in heavenly places you can only be in heavenly places when you're in Christ Jesus so just to be clear on this heavenly places is not a feeling heavenly places is a place it's a person it's a dwelling place feelings can come and feelings can go and how that we love to feel God's presence but yet the dwelling in heavenly places is not feelings neither is it based upon feelings but it is solid it is sovereignly based upon God Himself bringing to pass what he already has declared he says so if the Holy Spirit baptized them into heavenly places then it baptizes into heavenly places now the same fellowship heavenly places in Christ now quickly gneisses I'll give you my view and then we'll have to go according as he God has chosen us not my desire not your desire it wasn't Paul's desire but he has chosen us in him before the foundation in the world he said did you think of that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy not cause I lived right because he chose me to be that way he done it not I because of every way that we living let me just say it like this even for when you take into account the Pharisees and the religious of that day there was not one finger you could put on their life yet they were sinners is that right not one finger because by the word they're here they were moving but the word itself standing there and discerns what is down within their heart and that's where the word could declare according to their heart you are a sinner and that's where the Prophet could say that when we refuse or one who refuses to walk into the full counsel of God is a sinner it's powerful statement because when God has made known remember - said to be a sinner is to reflect sin and sin is unbelief is that right so to see that it that even with when the Lord Jesus came the word itself never came and paid homage or bowed down to them and in a manner that all they were they were living just so righteously but remember the Lord Jesus himself spoke that he called for that there must be a righteousness that would exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees there's only one righteousness that can exceed and that is the righteousness of God and that righteousness of God is that righteousness that comes on the inside of a person to where they now dwell in God's own righteousness to where the desire to where the nature has been changed and then that's where the word comes up to declare that whosoever is born of God cannot sin for his seed remaineth in him so here brother Branham is is making this clear he's not speaking against living right because the real gospel of Christ calls us to a to to a trueness and to live correctly according how God has ordained for us to live what is speaking of is that there's nothing that could merit what God has already done that what we see taking place now and how God dealing with our life is what was already foreordained before the foundation of the world he says this that's the reason you're holy this afternoon not because you deserve it but because he chose you to be that way he says when before the foundation of the world holy and without blame before him in love how could we do it there had to be a masterpiece do that and that was Christ Jesus listen you don't remember it neither do i but we was before the foundation of the world I'm gonna dwell very heavily beginning with his service upon those those emphasis here you don't remember it neither do i but we was before the foundation of the world this is going to require a greater search than any search engine can produce it's going to require something greater that's able to search it all the way back and find out and that way it might be known who we are it's home I let me just move on here he God gives expression he's brother brems says when God made man let us make man in our own image let us give them plural make men that then plural that's you and me that wasn't just Adam and Eve that's the sons and daughters of God this was the word that was declared give them and God will not it has not taken back his word but he manifested he manifested through lives that are surrendered to his purpose glory be to God make man in our own image spirit man and give them dominion over the fishes of the sea the cattles and so forth Genesis 1 God was saying that he said now back there before the foundation of the world God chose you in Christ Jesus to appear holy at the end time all the way from the foundation of the world now what you think of this as as he has chosen and ordained for me to be holy for you to be holy then it rests it rests solemnly on him to provide what is needed in order to bring this about it's on him he's the one to bring that about in order to bring forth this holiness now let me just not to dwell on this but let me just to do to really set this forth remember this holiness is not a holiness of our own accord this is his holiness his righteousness are you with me and remember one of the very first statements that pasal paul would make in the beginning of the book of Romans and he declared that the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ he was raised from the grave by the spirit of holiness so the Holy Ghost is the spirit of holiness it's the Spirit of God when that has taken place and that new birth that is holy unto the Lord it is separated unto the Lord Himself so it's up to go God to provide away that this can be within our lives now let's understand we're not just we're when we're speaking of this and looking at how that you know when we're taking of the mercy of God we want to look at that greatness of it of what God's mercy what what God would have mercy is is not that things would be allowed to continue God doesn't want us living a life of the fee he don't want you living a life of defeat that's not Calvary was not an emblem of defeat Calvary is the emblem of victory Amen were all the debt that was against us was settled and then on that Easter morning he got up he rose here he showed openly spoiling principalities and blotted out the handwriting that was against us it's showing that power and authority that God would desire and desires to declare in our life as an overcomer so it's the same way with any part of God's Word you when God is as spoken in his word it is God who must come on the scene and bring that word to pass it's gotta be anything anything that you have need of and I have needed in my life even those things that God would be dealing with in your life it takes him to come on the scene but there's got to be a desire a longing for him to come and fulfill that the word itself will start to stir you up and for those things and you say well I haven't received it yet but the word is conditioning you to ask for what God desires to fulfill you see the Spirit of this age is an age of of incentive and give me this and give me that and I don't want this and I believe deserve this and I deserve that we don't deserve nothing I'll tell you right now we don't even deserve a bicycle to come to church on we don't deserve nothing so it takes God coming on the scene to fulfill his word it has to be God coming through that word calling now look at this even when a word itself is preparing to come into full manifestation the God Himself begins to brood upon that word and through that word he's calling a vessel and through that promise he's calling a vessel and st. defying a vessel that the Lord God Himself who is the fulfillment of that promise might step into and manifest that promise in that age because this is the promise you are not safe at by anything else other than the word of Almighty God amen and that word is a word that comes forth pointing back to the atonement of Calvary and we think of this of even how that Moses himself ascended on the Mount when there had been a affair of failure in the camp and Moses said the first place the word is used in the scripture I will go and make an atonement he never backed the sacrifice upon that mountain he never packed blood up there you say what was the atonement the atonement was Christ revealed in the promise of his word and that word was standing there and what God could see in Moses he saw the cross in their standing that's why every promise of the word of God that is made manifest truly will reflect Jesus Christ oh my my my by that promise God does not use anything but his word to call his children by is that right Paul said you-you-you heard the gospel of your salvation it's a word for our day a word that calls us a word that sanctifies us and a word that puts us into service oh my so he comes in that like manner we see that even in Isaiah when God here as Isaiah an ordained vessel but God begins to make known the promise and as he's making known that promise it shows up the sin that's there and Isaiah must confess is that right he had to confess first then cleansing comes behind that then after cleansing then there comes a commissioning three stages so we find that the Prophet goes into this in the message Satan's Eden it says then he said were made one of his attributes from his own body God has attributes in his body like you're an attribute of your father and you notice she was in your grandfather's grandfather's grandfather's but in that say we'll take it down like you and your father now you did not know anything when you were in your father the germ of life comes from the male the male has the blood cell the woman has the egg and therefore the blood cell has the life in it and then when you were in your father you actually know nothing about it but yet science and God's Word proves that you were in your father but you know nothing about it but then the father longed to know you and with the union of connection with mother then you were made known to Father amen so even in great-grandfather's way back his longing to know only thing that great-grandfather can know was not you he could only know that which would be his children his sons and daughters that would be born in that generation but yet inside of there even when that son would come forth then what is it that life that name is continuing on are you with me and then there are children that continue to come forth that are bearing attributes that many times that will be a true it's from generations that's gone by in different things but yet those attributes will come out because it's still associated with the DNA now you are your father's attribute you look like him don't stay with me now don't get down on yourself you've got parts of your body that looks like your father and let me add this you act like him to come on somebody and you act like different things that have been have come about it and different responses to things but when you have been born of the Holy Ghost you have received equipment into a gene that is a prevailing gene a many prevails over all of those things that's the way God was in the beginning every son of God and every daughter of God was in God at the beginning you don't remember it now but you were there he nodes you look at this now he wanted you to become so he could contact you speak with you and love you and shake your hands God wanted to be able to do that all I think about the Prophet over and over he says you don't know who's sitting besides you on that pew he said turn around and look at him he said that's a son and daughter of O Matic god that's sitting right next to you God wanted to have contact with me he want that contact with you he wasn't that have fellowship with you and I let me tell you something fellowship is not a one-way street failure fellowship is a two-way it is coming and bowing they meant God not only wanted to speak but he wants us to speak back hallelujah they meant no wonder Solomon could say o my dove let me see that countenance any hear that sweet voice God wants to hear you and I he wants to have fellowship with you and I oh yes sir don't you want your own boy isn't it a great day when your boy can come home sit down at the table when he comes back from the battlefield or something another scarred-up how you'll fix the dinner you'll kill the fatted calf tor whatever more and prepare for him mister doing is expressing there's a there is such a love that the father is caught up in when there's a return let me say this to you the prodigal son when he returned home prodigal is not a good word prodigal means reckless and careless exactly what it means but I want you to remember that there was an announcement that was given that when that prodigal son was coming home that I want you to prepare the fatted calf I want you to prepare this feast let me tell you something this feast that you and I are enjoying yet this morning has already been prepared with you and I in mind the flower has been expecting our return glory be to God as a matter of fact he said your picture and he's been looking at that picture you say my picture yes because even when he expressed himself from the very beginning you and I were identified within him there we were identified in the believers identified his the promise and what was it he was longing for us to come into expression hallelujah glory be to God it's your own flesh and blood and he was in you you didn't know it in him then but you knew he was there and so God knew that we would be here but then he put us in flesh so we could be contacted in order he could contact he become one of us now watch this now in order he could contact he become one of us when he become Jesus Christ the Son of God himself the fullness of the manifestation of God therefore that was God's purpose to display his attributes in fellowship we see redemption we see that the body purpose tabernacle for redemption within that God was also showing this is the full prototype this is the true right here this is what every son and daughter of God this is not just restoring back what Adam fell from but beyond that cause Adam could fall are you with me Adam could fall but where God brings you and I back to that is no possibility of falling that is the seal of Almighty God that's the seal of the Holy Ghost oh my brother's sister this is the confidence that we have in him confidence in the work that he has done that's why that the seal of God his so important is so necessary within a life and it is the very longing and desire of security and peace and confidence within the heart of the believer fellowship the fellowship he had remember the disciples many times was talking they didn't know who was talking was talking is it the visit the flesh or is it gone behind the hatch right because this is exactly where God God was letting it be known this is where I've come to restore to where I come and Tabernacle behind in the vessel in the flesh of my children to where the fulfillment of John 5:19 the son can do nothing but what he seeth the father doing that doeth the son a fellowship a communion where the word itself here is being disclosed what God would desire within that hour I tell you for God desires more than just coming to church God desires a lot more than just good works you're cheating yourself you're robbing God but not giving all of your life to the Lord you're robbing God of what he has paid the price and made a way of what He desires to do through you but he can only do it as we submit to him it's got to be a word that will call us and listen the word as it calls us it´ll sanctifies to that purpose and put us in to service when I was in my father I knew nothing about it but when I become his son and was born of him I was attribute a part of my father and you're a part of your father and as a children of God we are part of God's attributes that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the earth and that was God's purpose at the beginning that's what God wanted at the beginning now I want to look here and in the word because here what God has already declared our memory cannot declare that our intellects cannot grasp that is that right the mind cannot conceive that not at all so there must be a searching back through there there must be that which would help us and bring us to this realization and once you think of this that when brother Brown would give back that that illustration of that young man who was in slavery being in this land but yet because he knew who he was by knowing who his father was that reality it affected his conduct even though he's here in slavery but that understanding affected him here the Lord Jesus prayed that where I am they may be also you see here's the word made flesh desiring the word is desiring when it comes to bring us into that place of fellowship so the word when it's spoken and it comes is not a word of condemnation it will bring rebuke and it will bring correction but remember rebuke and correction is not condemnation it will lead to condemnation if it's not heeded - but there must be rebuke and correction that would come to do what it would speak against the ideology and the vain imaginations and the idolatry of the hour because in those things the children of God are still walking in bondage and there must be a world that would have Jenner knows idols that would a Jenner those images that would adjourn those things why to break it around because look it's the word it continues on if it's just well you know everything's fine you know you know how it is God understands how sorry we are God understands this I'll tell you what you might be laying too much to God understanding God understands his word come on somebody God understands a real a real dedicated walk God understands and he knows when excuses are made instead of submission God does understand but God don't understand Lord I just can't do this because you know in this hour this is such a hard hour he don't understand that because he lived and walked in his time and he had to be that he was tempted in all points such as we are yet without sin he had to be that you and I can be tempted come on somebody but notice this he never made an exception it was not a compromise but he is there as a faithful high priest to minister on our behalf he understands us but his understanding is not a compromising were you with me the understanding in this hour that God has opened from generation to generation it did not weaken it did not come with some sort of watered-down puny excuse but it came packing the full efficacy of the blood of Jesus Christ that you and I might know that there is a true and perfect and total deliverance absolutely but then I can't help it oh yes you can oh yes you can brother send my generation but listen I'm talking about a different generation not generations and talking about a generation one singular the generation of Jesus Christ are you with me you see don't allow the devil to sell you what God never intended for you to have you ever had somebody try to give you a product you ordered the right one but they send the wrong one to you or they put the wrong wipers on your car whatever more and they say well you know you can go ahead you can just you can just have them you can you know these will be just as good no I want what I pay for if I didn't pay for the cheap plastic ones I don't want the cheap plastic ones I want the ones that are a rubber you with me but you understand what I'm saying hey if you order it's fake and somebody brought you out a hamburger you say well it's be a menu order beef this is beef too but I didn't want beef with cheese and lettuce and onions and tomatoes and whatever more that's for a different day you understand what I'm saying you have a right to die upon the Word of God that God has revealed in this hour you have a right as a partaker of his divine nature to ask him and say Lord let this be real in me I don't understand and when when when people say well I got the Holy Ghost getting the Holy Ghost makes you stop praying it makes you stop seeking for God to make himself war real not at all it's a love affair and all of these Lord prayer more desiring God continue to quicken your work continue to make yourself more real the Holy Ghost is not an act of complacency the Bible said eNOS power for service they man it is God Himself giving the divine energy that his will might be fulfilled let me move on a little bit here in Joel chapter 33 you see job was in a condition in his life he'd been offering the lamb he offered the lamb and full assurance and faith but there was a conversation that we know that have been had and God was bragging on Joe yeah each time you know when you're getting tested and trialed tried God's been bragging on you it was you and I would say Lord yeah I don't need be bragged on right now come on our flesh don't love tests and trials well let's go on Joe had and this everything that had happened to Joe he was tested in all things even to where where what Satan had told God I'll make him curse you to your face even where that influence would come upon his wife and Joe being a prophet and I want to say at this he wasn't just because he was a prophet that he was able to discern that it wasn't she was a foolish woman but she spoke as a foolish woman it was because Jill was a believer and Joe was under that lamb come on somebody we're talking about victory that is for everybody it's victory from the Prophet to the pastor the apostle victory to the janitor victory to the youngest child it is victory that is released in the camp of Almighty God are you with me this isn't just for one enough for the other this is not nickel alien ism where we have one holy man among us and we raise that holy man up and both I could only be like that holy man whole second no sadder weak tear them images down every one of them walk just as you and I walked they have went through the same things that you and I have went through they meant that God has showed through them that you can also as you will submit through me here's job the situation is coming to joven remember job if you notice in the in in in in in the scriptures there in the book of Job the company that job is keeping with begins to turn his view Joe begins to move from being focused on the lamb to being focused on himself he begins to exalt his righteousness my of rightness come on somebody because see that's what this company was all about Bildad in life fast that's what these guys knew they interpreted things going on by what they could see around them they had no insight to the other realm they were earthbound creatures listen to me Joe a prophet of God what if we can say as a type in that day one made and built to live in a heavenly place with Almighty God but yet the wrong company it started to bring this eagle down how are they bringing joke down they were not tearing down his sacrifice they weren't coming at him and crossing Joe to look at himself so job started to actually declare well I've done this and I've done that and I've done this and I've done that I've done this and I've done that and I've done this and I've done that he's looking at himself his eyes what is it it's a word that's moving his eyes from this sacrifice but there must come one who can tell Joe Joe look away Joe look away it's gotta be one who can come who has a vision that's able to break that hole where this Eagle has somehow come down it's got to come a word that's able to lift this evil back into the heavenly Amen he was not built and made to live there and neither are you built and made to live in the world you're not made and built to live under gloom and sorrow and all those things you might be walking there this morning but there is a word that is able to break that blue and that darkness hallelujah here comes Ella who in job 33 verse 1 he says unto job I pray thee hear my speeches and hearken to all my words behold now I have opened my mouth my tongue has spoken in my mouth my word shall be of the uprightness of my heart and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly the Spirit of God hath made me and the breath of the almighty has given me life the inspiration here is one who is standing now talking to Joe watch what he says if thou canst answer me set thy words in order before me stand up behold I am according to thy wish in God's stead I also AM formed out of the claim what's job receiving job's receiving the Ministry of one who is like him one who is made in the likeness of sinful flesh I am clay as thou art because before God can speak directly to job there's got to be a sacrifice go before there's got to be one who can stand in the gap one who can stand in the breach are you with me before God can speak lift to hear there must come this what is it it's reconciling bringing joke back from his doubts how is he being brought back from this by the word of true assurance behold my terror shall not make the afraid o glory neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee in that wonderful that's what he had had been experiencing a heavy hand upon him the heavy hand doesn't let it wasn't let him it wouldn't let oh come into come out of those experiences meaning growling and drilling Truscott it was a heavy hand that was coming on him but verse 8 surely thou has spoken in mine hearing and I've heard the voice of thy word saying watch this I am clean without transgression I am innocent neither is there iniquity in me this is what job started saying why that was the words that he was setting under come on somebody it was a word that was causing him just to look at himself and listen to me now we the word will always direct us to take inventory of our life but the word will never direct us to where we begin to observe our doings above the word it won't that won't happen it causes us to take account of our life been here verse 10 behold he findeth occasions against me he counted me for his enemy he putted my feet in the stocks he markets all my paths behold in this thou art not just I will answer thee that God is greater than man why does thou strive against him why are you striving against him you know and Joe's probably wondering why is this taking so long is that right I have heard but now I see brother bamse he was a prophet he knew there had to be an understanding for this why didn't the understanding come sooner well God also teaches us patience but at the same time God is also letting joke know right here that you were striving against me how am i striving against you by declaring I am free from transgression I am righteous come on somebody God is saying you're striving against me that's my work I'm the one who makes you clean I'm the one who makes you righteous I'm the one who calls you to be upright so after this-here a sacrifice a sacrifice has come a word the godless couldn't come direct there has to be a word that comes and stands in this place and now God after this time with Ellie who a type of Christ now God can speak lip to ear listen to me God draws you and I by the promise of his word the Holy Spirit dealing with the life calling a life and then was he doing he's making the preparation that he might come in and have fellowship with your eye but he doesn't let something else do the preparation he sends his word which is himself that prepares for him to come show 38 verse 1 then the Lord answered job I know this familiar but look at this then the Lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said who is this not dark enough counsel by words without knowledge look at this God answered you God God already he's had this he's Roy he's been waiting to let this go but now's the time to answer him why there's a sacrifice that's went forth and the sacrifice is also dealing perfectly with job to do what bring job into a place to where the word can speak to him to where the word can begin to interpret his life beyond what is seen here Jo 38 verse 1 and we read that verse 2 who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge gird up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee an answer thou me where was that when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding that's too far back for the mind to grasp who laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who that stretched the line upon it whereupon all the foundations there are fastened or who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy and joke continues to go on I won't forsake of time he continues to move on through this place all the way as God continues to make known God calls job's attention to things that killed no no mortal man has ordered these things is that not what Ella who said I will call to your attention that God is greater than man is that right here is God is letting him know even the simplest thing you have no answer who set this forth who set this who stopped us here who did this here he has no answer what's it what's into it he's dismantling he's letting job letting job see that our lives are not interpreted by the things we see but rather the sovereignty of God by faith by discernment listen friends in every part of our life listen when the word of God has come to us the Spirit of God it brings to us discernment to walk with a discernment in our life that discernment of the Holy Spirit that discernment that comes by the word a discerning a word that sharpens the senses he's sharpening he's interpreting here he has to Joe he's interpreting and declaring his oversight of job's life see job's droves looking at what what he sees around him catastrophes and the men that were around him were trying to interpret his life by what was going on God said no you're not a temporal creature you might be here but you're one of my children these things temporal do not hold the mystery of your life I hold the mystery of your life so here God is interpreting to job his life the order of it what's he doing he's heir placing job's faith he's restoring job anybody ever been through a trial you've been to a situation or you can say he has restored my soul he didn't save it again he restored it he lifted it like David would talk about when it was succumbed under all the darkness and the gloom and oh if I could only see only I can only behold God God restores so what does it do here is what how he stores that's all right everything else coming right into position oh my job answers him buy a job you know as he answers the Lord in verse 42 uh-huh look at this testimony in verse 2 before job 42 I know thou canst do everything and that no thought can be withholding from be the word is declaring not only what joel has said but it's declaring his thoughts all right here who is he that hided counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not things too wonderful for me which I knew not here I beseech thee and will speak I will demand of the and declare thou unto me I have heard of thee by the hearing of the year but now my eye wherefore I abhorred myself and repent in dust and ashes see the word it comes straighten him out he's a straightening mop not in a condemnation but what is repentance repentance isn't taking something with you but it's saying what God has said David said I hate that which thou hatest oh but it's you aligning with that and say Lord I stand with you on this we've got a dress or something here our life is a stand with you Lord what are you doing you're declaring yourself a Levite you are drawing your sword and saying I am on the Lord's side this thing that I'm looking at that is idle you will lead me back into bondage but I must stand fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made me free and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage is that right Paul was speaking to children of God in Galatia amen those that had been raised up under the word right think of this here you see all of this and I'm barely getting into my thought but to take this into account that here's to a job without an answer in himself for what was taking place gary was come under this he's looking at this looking at this he's justifying himself if we could say it in this manner listen to me by him doing that you could say deserves to remain that way but God Rich and mercy moves down and realizes he needs he doesn't deserve it he's justified himself but the mercy of God over rights and it is the mercy of God that steps in and breaks that around children's life that same mercy of God that has stepped into your life that same mercy of God that steps into my life that same mercy of God over and over again just look at another example there you have a man upon the earth by the name of Abraham God deals with Abraham and he speaks to Abraham he makes himself known to Abraham through the ages and Abraham comes into a place of where what God has seen in his life Abraham has come to fully identify and here is Abraham God makes himself known that the promise of what I have spoken what I told you in the previous chapter that you thought to be impossible Sarah thy wife shall have the sign and that's who I will establish my covenant with all right so here here is Abraham they received this visitation and Genesis 18 and at the very latter parts of this Abraham sees them coming out and they're looking towards Sodom the Bible says that Abraham goes with them for a little bit toward Sodom God has spoke this look look at this look at this fellowship that is being had here at this tent shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do God's desire to reveal its preparations to his servant and God's desire look it doesn't stop there he reveals the preparations to his children to whom that word is intended for Paul said that dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me for you to fulfill the Word of God so here Abraham area sees he's standing here and God God begins to declare what he knows the caliber listen to me now listen to me in verse 18 he says seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him what's he doing he's prophesying listen to me now they're still here as it was God prophesying of the promise that is to come forth and not just a son but a great and mighty nation that there be a gathering of people God is not speaking to the caliber of a natural man that Abraham is he's speaking to the caliber of the DNA that lays in him the spiritual DNA God knows that DNA because why he chose him that's what God is speaking to is that DNA sometimes this DNA gets in the way are you with me this DNA laughed in the previous chapter but the word kept coming you can't eat an ear of corn just off of a stock you can't eat it just off of a shoot you can't even eat it off of a tassel it's got to come into fruition the way that was spoken now is coming into fruition and it's God who is brooding over Abraham's life to bring forth what was there for I know him oh my that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment and that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him the scripture says in verse 23 abraham drew near what's this he sees there's something remember God has said shall I hide shall I hide look at this fellowship he sees him looking he draws near not further he draws closer you see when God begins to move on draw near just say Lord drawn here but God is making a promise no when God is speaking you draw nigh unto me and I will draw and Abraham drew near and remember how Abraham begins to say without destroy the righteous with the wicked for adventure there 15 he goes on look how Abraham is speaking here in verse 25 shall not the judge of all the earth do right and the Lord said if I find in Sodom 50 righteous within the city then I will spare all the place for their sakes Lott doesn't have a clue he doesn't know judgment is coming he's not aware of that where he is living he's not aware he doesn't lock does not have disfellowship listen to me lock might be a righteous man but he's not an elected son of God are you with me righteous person but he's not living in a place where God is communing and fellowshipping lot is not residing in heavenly places but it's gone Abraham would still be making gods he would still be worshiping idols come on friends you and I would still be worshipping idols of what a Christian is but God who is rich in mercy speaks directly to your life let me say this clearly his purpose is not just to call you to this church his purpose is that you would be delivered and translated into the kingdom of his dear son that you would become alive in Christ not that your mind is alive but that you're alive that serving God is not a duty it is a privilege [Music] have to do this you don't have to do anything when God does a work and you're like he is first above all other things if there's anything else before him there's another god I don't care if it's jobs family whatever it is understand be water the order is him family then god they're right that's the order of overcoming come on friends we're not trying to be well I want to be a good Samaritan I'm by the way boy did it let's let's look at that for a moment has he brought that up what is a good Samaritan is a good Samaritan handing out fruit baskets to the poor no what is a good Samaritan let's look at what the scripture said that when others passed that one by but good Samaritan who I will see a good Samaritan he saw one in need and he knew that there was a place that he could take them to where he could get help and What did he say he said to the innkeeper the prophet brings that to the local assembly to the innkeeper he said take care of this knowledge this and when I return I will give you your reward it's alright when I play in religion we're not playing you know I'm doing doing my part this is not it God doesn't smile on us just because we come to church on Sunday that doesn't smile on us just because we pay our tithes and offering all those things apart now of worship as opening prayer was different but listen there God desires the whole of our life they mend this message did not come to just be something that we agree with he came to release that life within us to break from around our lives that we not by mental conception but by the reality of God's memory of us be released in ours and now are we called the sons of God and not called the son of God that's like you know today you know I just say whole brother Samuel here you know let me just give you an example so everybody can understand this oh you know brother salmon he's wearing a big white hat and wearing a white coat and everything else brother Samuel is chef but because I've got a hat on in akola I'm a chef this is not what called the sons of God means this is not an earthly voice calling us the sons of God this is our father that lets us know you're my children you're my offspring you are my sons you're my daughters it's not because that I am identified with clothing of this hat and this thing it's his life and his life will bring forth in me all right take the spirit of John Dillinger put it in you you act like John Dillinger right some you got people in mind right now you take the spirit of Jesus crying or a spirit of Beethoven you act like Beethoven right you've caused what that's inspiration but when the inspiration comes that inspires you correctly to release you come on somebody there's a lot of inspiration that can come but yet that takes the inspiration that's able to transform you then it's not something that you're walking around and saying I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God the life testify are you oh yes sir we need they need the inspection of the Holy Ghost we need that inspection here is Abraham speaking here I'm closing here he speaks a lot very speaking here the Angels go down to visit Sodom you know that's a you know listen to me that's a mercy of God yes it's a message if they're taking a message to Sodom it's not a rapturing message Billy Graham and Oral Roberts you won't make them ready for the rapture see it doesn't have within it it's not the promise of the hour that's able to call sanctify and put in service you as me but it can call it can call them out but this is where I want you to look at this here how that law is told of the impending judgment Locke is remaining that he's tearing around looking at things and he's looking all around and the scripture says that in verse 16 after he was told arise get out of here verse 16 while he lingered you don't want to be lingering when God deals with your heart that's the mercy of God you want to move right on that and for you to believe and say that's me that is the mercy of God they lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the Lord be merciful unto Him and they brought him forth and set him without the city and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay now in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed and lot said unto them all not so my lord behold now thy servant has found grace in thy sight and thou has magnified thy mercy which thou has showed unto me in saving my life and I cannot escape to the mountain unless some evil take me and I die look at this testimony thy mercy has been magnified unto me become great thy mercy has become great unto me this is large testimony but look at this this is where I wonder what you want want you to see Abraham is one who was separated unto God Abraham is one who was separated unto the Lord for the fulfillment of the promise given unto him and Abraham as we see in the scriptures he begins to intercede according to the understanding of the word for the hour what is it an intercessor of Christ what is it what it is showing that when the word is revealed it is the mercy of God lot could not fully comprehend the mercy of God as far as bringing it forth out of his life like Abraham could are you with me but here is here is Abraham and that word house Abraham stands there to intercede he calls us me to think of what James by the Spirit of God says that the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy aren't you grateful for that that the mercy of God full of mercy but without qaulity without hypocrisy it doesn't take into account any standing here it looks to what the need is what is the need there amen so the revealed Word of God is the mercy of God to that generation the revealed Word of God in this hour is the mercy of God to this generation and if not for that he would smite the earth with a curse is that right so the revealed mercy of God that word holds within it the strength and the power to transform it is the mercy of God that is magnified than to you and I because the heart of God listen to me now the heart of God is Christ and Christ is that prophesied promise that anointed word now come forth and that word must first be declared the word must be spoken look and with that word coming there must come with that word being revealed mercy blood interceding for what for what has been spoken to come forth mercy Mussa come yet can I have just a few more moments in the book of Exodus chapter 34 after the golden calf after everything the atonement is made God tells Moses I want this journey to resume I want you to go on I want you to I don't want the people to just reside here I want to go I want them to go on and he lets Moses know I will send my an angel before thee I want you to catch this God discloses what He desires to reveal to Moses God just doesn't come right up and just reveal it he sets out I will send mine angel and then this is where Moses picks it up and says few verses on down by the way what is his name that's what God wanted him to ask God wanted because God wanted to reveal himself in fellowship he wanted Moses to know this about himself he revealed himself to Moses at the burning bush Moses was a changed man is that right changed by the promise but when you've been changed by the promise the promise keeps unfolding in you he unfolds himself more and more and more that's why you can sing the song Amazing Grace and you can say oh my amazing grace by I can sing it more now this morning than when we first begun it keeps unfolding himself here's the mercy of God is being magnified that word magnified means becoming greater and greater and greater the very first attribute Harry declares his deity and the Lord in verse 34 the Lord God Jehovah merciful merciful compassionate so why would that be needed because Moses needs to see this clearly and more clear and so does the people you understand me the people got to be able to pick their head up and walk on there's got to be a word that can loosen down that they can walk on so God reveals himself he's merciful I love how it says in verse 7 keeping mercy for thousands i'm identified in that verse it doesn't matter what others thought before we're looking at no doubt oh I thought the rapture was gonna take place years before it couldn't you can't take place without me are you with me good take place without me why there was mercy kept from me and that mercy that was kept and reserved for me it's still here with me he kept it for me can you say that for yourself he kept it for me hey man he makes himself known the Lord the Lord God merciful oh my how many times David David over and over mercies Lord that tender mercies Lord speak to me according that tender mercies Lord according to the multitude that Mercy's no wonder the Scriptures could speak in Isaiah 55 to sure mercies of David hallelujah oh my David nearly was God's mercy let it packed him along and it brought him up he that carried him above when Saul wanted to take his life it was the mercy of God it was the mercy of God that would cause him to resist the temptation to smack the Lord's anointed the mercy of God that would hold him daven knew about the tender tender mercies of God not hard and brittle and calloused with the tender notice how caught personifying himself in his word tender mercies of God nehemiah spoke of these things - he spoke of all this whole journey Nehemiah here recounting at the end latter part of Nehemiah he would speak of how that God throughout the course of time he would come and he would deliver the children of Israel and they would return back then he would deliver him again then they would return back and Nehemiah it says it like this verse 27 the I'll delivers them into the hand of their enemies who fix them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto thee thou hurt us them from heaven and according to thy manifold mercies thou gave us them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their enemies saviors yes vessels that were surrendering that Christ Himself who is the deliverer could come down with a word to deliver them amen the manifold mercies of God and let me just leave you with this just been considering look back in your own life and Paul could say and you who were dead in sin and trespasses who were dead and sin and trespasses in times past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince and power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of Wrath even as others next verse but God what God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us he is rich in mercy he meant his mercy had been magnified over a man to bring a deliverance in our lives we we were in a condition as the Prophet said we deserve to be there and remain in that condition but the mercy of God came by I tell you this morning when the Holy Spirit speaks to your heart regarding a promise of God a man with the Holy Ghost it's the mercy of God that you're able to say yes right that's what mine that's mine that promises mine Lord amen when the word of God comes or your healing and man and it's made known to you i am the lord the healer that's the mercy of god hey man what has made known to you I am your provider that's the mercy of God I'm your deliverer I am your shield I am your buckler what is it the mercies of God magnified to be able to lift us up being raised with him to set in heavenly places don't just set under the mercy of God but let it interchange you let it transform you let it change you let him perform his perfect working in your life let the mercy of God have its way let it be magnified let it be that our life reflects the prayer that was prayed o God let this word fall into hearts Lord let this word fall into hearts Lord amen a prayer that was made and why are you preaching this way why are you preaching that way he said because if there is a predestinated seed that is there when this word goes forth and it falls into them it will turn them to a son and daughter of God amen it must be aware that Pastor fellow mercy of God and the mercy of God is magnified to you it's been magnified to me raising us up out of the world where we were walking around we were like zombies we were dead people but the mercy of God came by if it had not been for the mercy of God we would still be buried connection but the mercy of God came by they men the blood of cloth the wisdom of God the revelation of God what is it written it manifests to you his love he takes you by the hand but he ain't dragging you out like he did lot he takes you by the hand and says come on son let's go home come on daughter let's go home it may not be this hand right here but he gets ahold of your heart he begins to deal with your heart the angel of the Lord begins to whisper come home what's he doing he's drawing you by a word a promise back into your position where you be Lord hallelujah it's a word a word that is packed hey man it has within it the full power for what he has done now listen to me now the mercy of God one of these mornings because His mercies are new every morning one of these days the mercy of God is going to be magnified again and it'll move into a greater into a greater statement where these very bodies will be changed from glory unto glory mercy unto mercy the mercy of God tender mercies is magnified to us he's the same yesterday today and forever let me just say to you very clearly the question you have he is your answer the doubts you have he is your assurance the disturbance you have is your peace it's to fool me walk into him you love him [Applause] I said this morning don't live don't live beneath your privileges it's the mercy of God that would come by and let us know I kept that that whole the whole time one scripture just continues to ring in my heart over and over it seemed like it was just shouting out when brother Wayne was here preaching it that scripture just kept shouting out I have made thee to be the head and not the tail it wasn't set out here audibly but the Spirit of God or just just seemed like it just making that so clear when God by His Word has come that word lifts you and I into his victory you're not the tail you've been made to be the head and the head is where the orders come from and the tail follows if thou can believe in thy heart and say unto this mountain be thou moon plucked up and remove to yonder sea it shall be according that's the mercy of God we are living out living out that very prayer of intercession that even the Lord Jesus himself made in John 17 we're living out as every age when that word comes forth there was intercession that went is that right and in this hour in the end time the revelations 8 when that 7 seal was opening that was given to one a censer the golden censer and he took that sensor and poured it into the earth you with me that's sweet incense that full life that full nature Christ fully released revealed among his people I say the presence of God has come down this is his presence the seventh seal was not just a we understand not just a statement it was the person of Christ Himself coming back to dwell in the midst of his people he took a son a man an ace on a man revealed the son of man that the son a man could then move into his bride body amen so it is Christ in you the hope of glory bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she is him the Son of man revealed the mercy of God is
