service worship you come and hear your word dear god we thank you lord for the building that you've provided dear god for us to have a such a service in dear lord we ask god for your blessings on the people tonight dear god lord that they would be encouraged lord god and strengthened by the word we ask it in jesus christ's name and to the glory of god amen i'd like to read from jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 through 11-13 i want to speak again on the subject before i know the plans i have for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you say search for me with all your heart maybe see as i had read to you on sunday in the new and international translation it says for i know the plans i have for you plans to prosper you not harm your plans to give you hope in the future god has plans for each and every one of us god has his plan and it's not our plan that shapes god's plan god has a complete plan that he had before the world was ever formed and it was a great grand plan far beyond what our perspective can can quite grasp he knew the beginning from the end when he started he knew how he was going to finish it and because he was god there was nothing that could prevent him from doing what he had set out to do satan tried to uh offset his plans or upset them when he came down to the garden and tempted eve and uh you know thereby man fell but even that unbelief did not stop god's plan everything works according to god's plan even when satan thinks he's thrown a wrench into something it's still part of god's plan and there's nothing can interrupt it god had a plan for moses to to be the deliverer the man in other words that he would use the instrument that he would use to deliver the children of israel moses tried to interject his plan into it and he ended up with one dead egyptian and the people still bound and the people had no confidence in him but that didn't stop god's plan god didn't have to say hope i got to scratch this plan now i've got to go back to square one i've got to start all over again no it didn't affect god's plan it worked in god's plan because it took moses out of egypt away from all of his training away from all of the unbelievers of the of the egyptians it took him away from the criticism of the p of his own people and got him out alone to where god could come down and just speak and it'd be god and moses speaking to one another so it was it still worked at god's plan when god says something that settles it it's going to happen no matter how ridiculous it may look to man and brother branham said god makes it look ridiculous to man and it always looks ridiculous to the unbeliever someone's saying i'm going to church to be prayed for i i've been diagnosed with cancer i'm going to church to be prayed for to be healed to an unbeliever that would sound ridiculous but to a believer it makes perfect sense because that is god's plan that fits in god's plan god's i am jehovah raphae the lord thy god that healeth all thy diseases it's god's plan to heal people jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he's healed people in the past he's still healing people he hasn't changed and no amount of devils can stop him from from bringing healing to those that need it and will believe faith is only real to god and the believer you try to talk about faith to an unbeliever to a person of the world they don't know what you're talking about faith do you mean like mind over matter no faith is real faith is a substance faith is something you can hold on to and it's not a hope and it's not a last hope god's promises will be fulfilled no matter what the devil tries to do or what how much unbelief is around you all the unbelief they could muster wouldn't stop the sun from coming up all the unbelief that a a person could muster wouldn't stop the stars from shining so how could it stop god it doesn't matter what anyone around you says your faith claims and holds on to the word of god because it's in the plan of god to heal you he'll heal every sick person that'll take his word after now i no doubt you have read in the message about a brother by the name of brother way and i had the opportunity to meet him years ago when i was a young boy him and his wife and heard their testimony firsthand and he was in a service brother branham was preaching and he just fell over dead right in the service laid out in the floor dead his wife was a nurse she went down by him right away said he's gone and god raised him up from the dead right there in that service and here's what brother branham had to say about it he said brother way your god's purpose for your life isn't over yet that's why you're still here with us tonight he had passed in the morning service he was attending the night service he said that's why you're still here with us tonight because god's purpose for you isn't complete yet and he says i'm going to pray that god shows you the plan that he has for your want your life and your wife's life so that you can get into god's plan and do what god has for you to do so death couldn't take him because god still had a purpose there was still a plan that involved him and his wife turn me to romans chapter 8 verse 28 pardon me while you turn and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose before i go on reading let me read you this brother branham said this was concerning brother way again he said i think it was no more than a confirmation of what i had been preaching about and had been witnessing of the kingdom of god and it's something along that line so here god wasn't finished with brother way yet but he but he let death temporarily take him so that he could raise him back from the dead in the service so that he could confirm what brother branham was preaching so you see god's plan is beyond just something very simplistic god works all things they they're working like a clogs to together all things work together for the good of them that love the lord so everything that has ever went on in your life god has allowed and it has been to bring you to the place to where god could use you to bring you to where you are now and it doesn't matter what your age is how young you are or how old you are god's plan was to bring you to this point in time you were ordained to be in this last age in this last time with the end time message at the time when god is calling the very last election and you've got a part to play you might think well i'm not a preacher how could i be playing a part in it you don't have to be a preacher do you know what you have to be what god's made you that's all you got to do be what god's made you and brother branham said be the best at it all things work together for the good of them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate uh i don't understand people that have trouble with predestination because the words in the bible so it isn't like a word that somebody snagged out of the air somewhere and and said well it'll fit with this and this and this uh ideology of the scripture no it's in the bible for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son you see his plan you'll know god's another insight to god's plan read the mystery christ the mystery read the message christ the mystery of god reveal he has a threefold purpose brother branham said to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren who are the many brethren us well he's the firstborn well then i've been reborn too moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called god didn't leave he doesn't leave anything up to chance he had a plan for you and he called you to this end time message to fulfill his plan and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us it doesn't matter who's against you it can't stop god he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecutions or famine or nakedness or pearl or sword that is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor a height nor debt nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord you realize that god even has a that even the unbelievers fit in his plan even the unbelievers have a purpose to serve in this life even the make-believers have a purpose to serve in this life they may be the ones that are going to despise the believer speak evil of the believer pass their name out as evil persecute them pharaoh the bible said god raised him up for his purpose and the bible says that god hardened pharaoh's heart each time that moses came to him that was all in god's plan to fulfill his purpose and to fulfill his plan and his plan was i am going to bring egypt to its niece i i promised i would do this with a mighty hand i'm not going up there and asking his permission i'm going to force him i'm going to do it with the mighty hand well in order for god to have to do with the mighty hand pharaoh's heart had to be hardened and he had to resist he had to be an unbeliever now god didn't create him to be an unbeliever pharaoh came into this world because of the fall he was serving seed but even god can use serpent seed to serve his plan everyone on the face this earth fits into god's plan somehow and he purposes the plan in himself he doesn't ask my permission or or my advice you think ought to do this jerry and he doesn't have to tell you everything that he's doing even about your own life he allows you he allowed job to go through trials that was all part of god's plan because god wanted to reveal something to job so job had to get into a place to where he would be opened up to god to where god could reveal to him the resurrection so god lets you go through things so that he can more reveal himself to you i will boldly say the lord is my helper he reveals to us that he's our helper he reveals to us that he how could he reveal to you that he was your healer if you never had need of healing he said he'd make everything work together for the good of them of the lord so there's nothing that goes on even you may make a you may be going somewhere and make a wrong turn and you think oh i've really messed up i've got to get turned around and get back where i need to go and if you were in a hurry you're like oh why would you do something like this you you talk to yourself i'm sure they say it's okay as long as you don't answer yourself but i i believe i'd give you the testimony of when my mom had last come down to visit us and i took her to the airport and on the way back we just kept getting into more and more traffic and i started taking alternate routes routes to try to get around it to try to get back home quicker and uh end up getting on getting off of one route onto another that was backed up so i turned around and went back on to the original route got back on there got on down got stopped down there and and found out that just before i got there there had been a a major accident up there i thought i made a wrong choice but god didn't want me at that place when that accident was going to happen he's got your hand on he's got his hand on you when you don't even know that it's necessary sometimes god has you do things that after you get it done you think oh man that was a waste of time i'll give you for example i went to college and i studied and what i studied i don't even use what i went there for but i learned how to make good notes i learned how to write resumes and you would be shocked at the amount of resumes that i have wrote for my church members i thought boy i've wasted i've wasted some time here but i went and got what god wanted me to get i just didn't know what it was there was a woman she was a wash woman washed clothes for a living and she had a burden on her heart for the community she couldn't get away from the bird but she was just just a person who did laundry she had a burden for for god and for the work of god so she went with her savings and rented a stable and invited a preacher to come and a preacher came and began to preach and poured his heart out to the community and all that would come out and the only response he got was a little old boy with hair hanging down his back wearing his daddy suspenders he came up to the altar and gave his life to the lord out of all those people out of all that community one young man came up and gave his life to the lord and that young man's name was the white l moody and he won millions of souls to the lord and that wash woman that was just a washed woman that just did laundry it was her purpose in life to get the white elmoody to salvation so be what god has made you and be the best at it god made her a washed woman so that she would save up money to rent a stable to get one young man saved and do you know all the millions of souls that got saved under the white dome moody's ministry she will get credit for it be what you are and be a good one brother adam said fulfill your purpose so others can see you if you're a housewife be a real one if you're a husband be a genuine one if you're a deacon be genuine if you're a preacher be genuine whatever you are but don't try to take somebody else's place and he mentions about usia and how uzi got lifted up and he took the censor and he went to try to do the priest's job god had to bring correction to him brother branham says when god brings correction to you and the word calls you down and you feel rebuked then just repent that's all it is the only thing to do lincoln president abraham lincoln he had no education but he he had a drive to to be president and he didn't let his education stop him i became one of the greatest presidents we've ever had he was a god-fearing man he had something in his heart was it was god had a purpose for him to serve and you think well if god had a purpose for him to serve be president why didn't god make him a real educated man why why didn't god make him be born into a family of politicians because none of that stuff has anything to do with god's plans and purpose god's plan for abraham lincoln's life and god wanted to show there's nothing going to stop it you think the devil voted for abraham lincoln no he did not and the devil was against him his entire presidency so much so that once his purpose had been served the devil sent an agent to take his life so i think every christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it have a purpose in life something you're going to do god has placed you here do something about it if there's a revival there it's there for a purpose let's get something out of it let's do something about it and you've got to be willing to pay you the price whatever it is you know we read the story of samson see what kind of a man samson was and as you read about his life you might wonder why did god even mess with him he looked like such a messed up person he had problem with women why would god even bother with him but god had a purpose for him and even when satan took and cut off his hair and put out his eyes it still wasn't going to stop god from serving his purpose through samson's life but you realize samson had to be willing to give his life so that god's final purpose could be served and samson said let me die with the philistines and he was willing to do whatever it took he was willing to die out you know there is something in every human that wants to preserve their life but he was willing to die out to that in order to fill just one more time the power of god brother branham said are you willing to pay the price to feel god's power one more time i said on sunday you've got to let loose and let god have his way and get yourself out of the way there was um two individual man and his wife that came to be prayed for one of brother rem's meetings they were old they were well stricken in age and they were having problems that come with age brother branham said now this morning your old and gray and stoop shoulder having a lot of aches and pains and things you're not used you didn't used to have but remember you're still serving the same god that brought you on the earth then it must be all in god's purpose to let you get this way but remember in the resurrection you'll not have a gray hair nor wrinkle everything that death has did to you will be forgotten in the resurrection god when he got the picture painted they said there they are now come on deb but you can't take them until i let you do it and when you go into the dust and raise up again you'll come back the same lovely couple that you was at the altar that morning when you got married and remained that way forever so what have we got to be scared about so they come up to be prayed for because they were experiencing things from their age and brother ma'am said god let you get this old for a purpose i'm going to tell you something age doesn't mean anything to god moses didn't really get started until he was 80. well god i'm too old now my my life's gone doesn't matter this is the time i've chose brother ramsey said took egypt 40 years to teach moses and god 40 years to get it out of him satan could not drown noah in the flood until the purpose of god had been finished he couldn't burn up the hebrew children until the purpose of god had been finished you know the bible doesn't tell you shadrach meshach and abednego it doesn't tell you much about what they did it didn't tell you much really about their life but what it tells you about is the purpose of their life and the purpose of their life was to show a king that there was a god and that not even fire could harm his children that the very thing that satan sent along to destroy him all it did was was loose their bonds it burnt the ropes off of them the bindings off of them without sending one hair on their body you think about this uh think about the times you've grilled out perhaps especially on a charcoal grill with real fire and you know you get the thing heated up and you're trying to turn you know your food and and and you know the closer you get to the heat while your hands you get to where you can't hardly stand the heat cinches the hair off your hands especially when you're trying to put the food on the grill sometimes it's easier to place it on with your hands than it is trying to use the utensil especially slippery old chicken and before you can get it all on there you're like well it got too hot for my hands and that's just a charcoal grill but they heated this furnace up many times over they had it so hot that the the men that went down there to throw them in died they perished from the heat but it never touched one hair on the head of me shaq shadrach and bendigo god's purpose was so the king would look down there and see i i see four men down there unbound unbound walking around and unhurt and he said the fourth man is like the son of god [Music] their purpose in life was to reveal the fourth man [Applause] and that's what god focused on in their life he couldn't kill job with boils or troubles until the purpose of god had been finished the lions couldn't eat daniel death and old age couldn't take abraham until the purpose of god had been finished death old age couldn't stop sarah from bringing from having the chosen son what's age mean to god god said i'll just reverse it i'm god i can do what i want to god can do what he wants to in your life what was my purpose i was thinking today when i was studying on this service and i thought my mom brought two pastors into this world my dad trained two pastors that was besides them actually living their life as an example you know you know don't you don't have to worry about well what what is god's purpose for my life because god is going to manifest you will you are in god's plan you'll fall right into place do as the lord lead you hallelujah and i just said that that's besides all the grandchildren that have been produced and the talents that god has given them and the talents that god has worked out through their life and how they edify the body of the lord it all come about because of a couple got together and both dedicated their lives to the service of god and it brought all that about and this is the thing see god knew all that all the time my mom didn't know my dad didn't know mom was too busy trying to stuff a foot long hot dog down inside her little purse because she couldn't eat it all on the first date but god had a plan the whole time and he knew what it was and knew what he was going to produce out of it brother branham says it this way he says god got this one with that one and that one with this one and this one with that one and then produced offspring until he get the right king in the bell the wonder we can say is the word says the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty to the pulling down a strong hope satan's you know satan has been present throughout your life to try to disturb god's plan for your life he tried the attractions of the world with some of you he tried to take your life perhaps from one way or another god said uh-uh i got a plan and this individual fits in my plan in a certain place at a certain time and that's today and tomorrow and the next day until the purpose that you have in serving god's entire plan has has been served then god says now i'm going to reward you i'm going to take you out of this life and take you to a place beyond your imagination brother branham said i used to fear death he said but something happened to me he said i used to fear dying because i thought would i just be a like a floating spirit he said but something happened to me the other day and he said i'll never be the same he said and if you could understand what death is you'd never fear it because it's eternity there's no yesterdays there's no tomorrows everything's all just present tense and god rewards his faithful soldiers by taking them home your work's done now come on up a little higher receive a little bit of the reward that you got coming to you last year labor day i i in my church i'm sure you were all praying for brother roell storyanna then sister soriano messaged me and said brother roell has been promoted now my way of thinking i looked at everything that god was doing through brother rowell and all the work that he did all the labor he put in and all the work that still yet needed to be done so i kept saying ah it ain't god's time to take him yet he's still got a lot of work to do but that was my thing but see in with god he had fulfilled the purpose god had sent him for say but and there's still work to be done yes and there's more people that god has to fulfill that work god has been and you might think well nobody could ever feel brother oil's shoes that ain't god's purpose anyway but there's other people other brothers that fit in god's plan that god has a purpose that they're going to fulfill and they're going to play their part now and you know as god's plan works it also brings identification causes people to show their colors the report i got was that all the ministers and brethren who never relied on brother roell for financial support but relied on him for spiritual support are still supporting the work my brother and i the the brother that's pastor right now brother boy my brother and i got to meet him he uh last time we were over in the philippines he he took me around while my brother was going and preaching in certain locations he was taking me to another location to preach on one sunday morning and we met up later that evening you know covet hasn't took one life that god hadn't intended to take even covet has to bow to god's plan anyone that comes again when someone comes against you friends that's going to work in god's plan for your life you think about the the guide used to take brother branham around hunting and brother branham said he had a cruel heart you remember the story he used that little call of a fawn to draw their mother out brother ram said i couldn't watch i turned my head i knew he was just gonna blow her heart clean through her all of a sudden the rifle went down to the ground he said lead me to this god that you talk about because he saw something real so even that mother deer that stepped out there but hearing that fun cry had a purpose to serve and her purpose to serve was to show that god was real showing it through nature the possum the cave and brother brahman said she waited patiently for her turn brother branham passed her by but a little ugly old possum had a purpose to serve in god's plan that a prophet would pray for and she would be healed and gather up her babies and go on her way all things work together for the good of them to love the lord god uses animals god cares about animals hallelujah brother branham wanted to be a cowboy but that wasn't god's plan for his life he wanted to be a wilderness man but that wasn't god's plan for his life god's plan for his life was to be the prophet to the end time age and to bring the word that has called us into god's plan i wanted to be a soldier but that wasn't god's final plan i said you're not going to be a soldier for this country you're going to be a soldier for me but you know god even took all that and none of it was wasted god used things to mold you into the person that you are today and god didn't place you here to express your political views because everybody has got them in the all state god sent you here to be a christian to be a servant for him oh my god's plan for i know the plans i have for you god's not trying to figure it out it's already said i've seen people searching for what they felt maybe god would call them to do and they were doing it all along what were they looking for you know what more important could god call you to be than a member of the bride of jesus christ to let your life be a light to the world ye are the light of the world hallelujah god's purpose god's plan and you know no matter how many times satan tried to derail god's plan for brother branham's life god was always there it's a matter of you won't you take a drink oh he's the only that the branham family has produced give me that bottle couldn't do it every time satan tried to derail it you see satan saw the the birth satan saw the sign he didn't know god's complete purpose but he knew god had something special for this individual just like he knew god's got a child that's going to be born in egypt and he's got a special purpose for him in this life i don't know who it is so i'm just going to kill them all all the baby boys and you know all those baby boys those hebrew boys that died their purpose in life was to hide moses so that satan couldn't find moses in the time when jesus was to be born and they came to herod and they said where is he born king of the jews herod's jealousy caused him to order the baby boys to be killed and everyone that died died to hide jesus that's hard something to grasp but god even had a plan for them and do you realize the moment they died they became about 20 years old in perfect bodies and they were welcomed home here's your reward ah makes it look ridiculous to man but god has a purpose for everyone there was a little baby girl that i went to pray for in the hospital one time he was six weeks old she'd been abused been had bones that had broke and re-healed her head was swollen from the abuse she had wires hooked up all over just six weeks old i went in and there was a nurse tending to her and i said i don't want to get away she said no pastor it's fine come on up be beside me so i i said can you tell me anything about the condition of this baby he said if she lives she'll never be right she'll she'll be an emblem there was the mother the man she was living with were being questioned about what had went on how this had happened to this child and they found she had been sedated with drugs it was still in her system i prayed and i said lord just take this little baby on home don't let her suffer no more in this life and i left and she passed i was asked to do the funeral and i just kept thinking now brother branham said that death couldn't take you into the purpose for your life had been served i just kept thinking what purpose if this little baby's life had served her mother she knew about this end time method she had been raised by a mother who was a believer she had professed to be a believer at one time herself the drugs that were in the baby were drugs that had been prescribed to the mother and the police when they went while the parent the the mother and this man was being questioned they went in their investigation and went into their apartment and found where the medication had been crushed and cut up with the razor blade to get it and fed in the bottle i said what purpose could she deserve the lord said she gave opportunity for them to do the right thing but they chose to do the wrong thing and it says it would be better that a millstone was tied around your neck and you cast into the scene than to offend one of these little ones woe be the he that bringeth the offend but jesus goes on to say but yet the offense must come hard to grasp some of these things but it just lets you know a little insight to the complexity of god's mind my thoughts are not your thoughts he knows and i may have touched on a cord somewhere maybe you've lost a child loved one you may not know why or what purpose their life served but god had a purpose and they weren't taken until that purpose was served and for serving god's purpose they were rewarded the venom said all babies die go to heaven brother adam said sometimes he'll take one to prevent it from facing things going down the road be raised right wouldn't have the right here or something god knows perhaps the purpose was to get your attention god's got a plan for you amen be what god has made you as the prophet said and be a good one god's called you to be a factory worker be a good one why last seed may be working by you you may be the one that crosses path with this child of god that needs to be called and the god in your life will call them because they have been predestinated highly listening heavenly father lord we bow our heads before you tonight lord i think about the times lord in my life where satan tried to take me away or take my
