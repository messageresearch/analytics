very dark world it's the darkest time there is but that day star has a rose in our hearts Amen to herald the day that's coming amen and I'm glad this is not what we have to look forward to I'm glad that we have that reality that which God has prepared for us to look forward to it really gives us comfort in the midst of tests and trials is to look to that and to know truly when we stand there on the other side in that day as Paul said that trials he said at that time he said the those things he said it's not worthy to be that glory it's not worthy to be compared with those things that where we suffer now it's not even worthy to be compared and I'm sure when we get there that day we'll say the toils of the road there were nothing and yet we feel like we feel the effects we feel the suffering we feel all of that in these bodies but you know sometimes God allows those things he permits nothing can come our way unless he permits it but it's always those are just reminders we're not fully home yet amen in our soul we're already there amen we're living under the effects of that land amen well we just love the Lord tonight and we want to just turn in our Bibles here if we would to second Kings chapter 5 and verse one is where we want to just begin and we'll read a free verse of scripture and then we'll just let you have your seats now naman captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria he was also a mighty man in Valor but he was a leper and the Syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the Land of Israel a little maid and she waited on naimans wife and she said unto her mistress would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is in the Land of Israel and the king of Syria said go to Golan I will send a letter unto the king of Israel and he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment and he brought the letter to the king of Israel saying when this letter has come unto thee behold I have therewith sent naman my servant to thee thou mayst recover him of his leprosy it came to pass when the king of Israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said and my God to kill and to make alive that this man does send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider I pray you see how he seeketh a quarrel against me and it was so when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore hast thou and thought my clothes let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel let's just pause there Amen maybe you have a need you want to make known to the Lord tonight amen lift up lifted hands and more just pass by my way amen god bless you tonight father Lord Jesus as we we come now Lord in this portion of the service Lord we're want to say we're very thankful that Lord you made a way that we would be able to be here tonight we're thankful father Oh God for all that you have done all that you're doing Lord and all that you will do Lord we're thankful tonight Lord Oh God for your mercy and your grace to our lives Lord father how that Lord you you common and we just we Lord love how you come in such simplicity to speak to our hearts Lord just to Lord ministered to our lives you know every need that's here tonight you even know the requests Lord that even is behind those hands Lord we we just ask tonight that you'll just come you would just Lord ministered to each one of those needs Lord may you Lord just come and just touch every heart in a special way tonight Lord father even some Lord that are not able to be here Lord sick in their body Lord we ask God that you would just go to them Lord may I pray Lord even as the word is being ministered here that virtue Lord would just move Lord to them right now Lord as it would move to each and every one of us Lord we just Lord turn our hearts our attention to you and ask that you would just come and just speak to our hearts in a personal way tonight Lord take your word and just deliver to us Lord we pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you you may be seated I wondered if we could let's just resume reading there in verse nine it said so naman came with his horses and with his chariot and he stood at the door of the house of Elijah and Elijah sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in Jordan seven times and I flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean but naman was Roth and went away and said behold I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper are not abdomen far part rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel may I'm not washing them and be cleaned so he turned and went away in a rage notice these words that are descriptive here in in in in this portion he's Roth and he goes away in a rage these are not just things that are just internally but sometimes you and I both know there's some times people can keep we say a gain face they can keep their face everything is just right but inside it this was not the case here and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father no watch this if the Prophet had bid thee to do some great thing wouldest they'll not have done it how much rather then when he said to the wash and be clean then he went down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again likened to the flesh of a little child and he was clean and he returned to the man of God he and all his company and came and stood before him and he said behold now I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel now therefore I pray thee take a blessing of thy and I just in my heart just just really just meditating on these things when I walked off the platform last Thursday the Holy Spirit just met me and just spoke to my heart there with on this this portion of Scripture that we're reading and I just you know just meditating on it and saying Lord what would be the direction we've been dealing with healing there's much ground even to be covered and to me it's been a real when I say a refreshing it's been refreshing there's things that God has continued to open and make so personal when it's come to healing and things that we haven't even got into yet but my heart's desire is that that it would be a blessing and a help to our lives and to our walk because sometimes we can all be honest here and if I could say it like this we can all let our hair down in the sense that there's a lot of things that's very simple but yet if you try to explain it you can't explain it it's just like when we deal with faith healing is the same way you can try to explain it but yet the reality is you finally get to a place and say you know what I just I'm just I just look to the Lord and it just comes to this place of what it is we we are all depending on God there's things that many things that we can look at and I believe that God unfolds things to you and I and has he unfolds it it's not that we would become more knowledgeable as far as in our mind but then when we but the reality when God teaches us things it's to position us and in the positioning of us it's that we might become more ulid we become more aware of the domain that is given to us as the sons and daughters of God this is where brother Branham would take us in the message adoption he said there's a need for preaching preaching reaches out and it takes ahold of the center and brings that center unto God he said but then once he's come then you need the teaching of the word to position us and establish us I'm grateful to God God has done and he worked in both ways in this hour and God has brought to us his word and and truly it takes more than just a man to bring a teaching it takes a whole goes he's the true teacher of the church he's the true evangelist he's the true prophet he's the true apostle it takes the Holy Spirit to work through his gifts to minister to our lives but I want to deal with this thought tonight on healing through humility we were looking at some thoughts last week and looking at things of based on on the authority of the word and sometimes we we hear things and sometimes we we can be within ourselves it can be do I go up and get prayed for and we can find we can find things that where we see in the scripture they shall lay hands on the sick that's still the scriptural order then we then we have this of the Roman centurion and we say well Jesus said I'm not found so great a faith in all of Israel his faith was all that that man's faith was already at a point he did not need his faith to stimulate it anymore it was ready to receive it but there are times that within all of us and they just say it in this manner God's faith never wavers our faith can waver that is why that we need the help of Almighty God we are regarded as sheep and we need the Shepherd and the Bishop of our soul to minister to our lives and to bring to us as brother Brown would say he put gifts in the church to encourage our faith to stimulate our faith he said all of those things are to go together that all the attributes of Jesus Christ could be made manifest in the body of Jesus Christ I'm glad he knows what I have need of and it's something that that as I said that when we look at this with humility it's things that I want to be and I'm sure you do as a as a believer I want to act upon all parts of God's Word because as we were looking at it last week you can never come to a place in the word and say well we're beyond laying on of hands I think it's very clear and if it was and I pray that God make it clear of how that the brother branham was going through that in the scripture and bringing it to you and I that it never was to do away with with a laying on of hands but it's to bring the whole part is that our focus is placed on the Lord Jesus Christ it's not upon any man's hands it's not any monies it's not any man's hands that heals you it's your faith in God and God's the one who does the work and to be honest you know I'm a just God just go ahead and say it you know talking with some of my brethren you know and we were just talking and some of the brother and we were when some of my African friends were here visiting you know and some of the things you know you go through we learn things as we go along in our journey you look back and you you look back over your life and you've learned things and we ought to be growing brother Branham says you know he said we first started out in the meetings he said you know we were like a person swimming we you get done he said but eventually you'd grow he said you get to a spot you can make those strokes and you're not tired we need that wisdom of the Lord and you know I think of how the brothers we were talking about he said we used to pray as though we were the ones saving the people he said we used to pray as though we were the ones healing I'm where we prayed as though we were the ones giving the Holy Ghost he said no we just pray God's the one it's his work and those little things like yet it just you know it resonates in your in your heart because that's truly what it is it's just it's it's it's God doing the work so I want to look at this thought here healing through humility and when we look at this whole part when we look at humility humility is that which God desires and humility will always draw God on the scene and it was humility to accept the will of God his path to accept the healing and the or the leading of the Lord the Scriptures go on let me just go through a few scriptures here the first Peter 5:5 it says you younger submit yourselves unto the elder all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may Sault you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you James 4:6 it says he giveth more grace God resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble we all want grace verse 7 this this verse of scripture so many times this first part is left out and we go right to the latter part but the first part you can't have the latter without the first submit yourselves therefore to God this submission here is is that of where voluntary attitude of where we bring ourselves under the Word of God Lord your word is true you know you and I both know you cannot it's not up to your eye to choose the way or the path or the leading or even how our healing comes it's not the pathway is not in our hands to choose you we see that even I think was very it's clearly laid out before us in the scripture here submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you verse 8 says draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you say how do I do that it's very simple anything that would be between you and God's Word from being fulfilled in your in you in in your life just say Lord forgive me cleanse me brother Brown would say it just this simple in the in the message gyrus healing and irises daughter brother Bram comes to the latter part of that message is getting ready to start into the prayer line he said right now remedy everything within your heart he said maybe you say in your heart brother BAM I've been a little critical of you brother Brown he said but why don't you you said you just say in your heart said Lord forgive me Lord brother branham's my brother I love brother Branham he's a he's used he's used of you just that simple just that simple it doesn't mean to say to you it doesn't take long drawn-out prayers repentance is something confession is something that can be done in a moment's time sometimes even a person can go so long and what it is they're not wrestling with God they're wrestling with themselves but to know that God is present and to realize that the drawn lines are gone if there's anything that comes up at all and I say it just even while the ministering of the word is going going on don't wait till the end relinquish it right then right then in your heart these are some things we'll look at here tonight draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you Psalms 34 verse 17 the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and delivered them out of all their troubles verse 18 the Lord is not into them that are of a broken heart and save it such which be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers him out of them all Psalms 51 17 the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a broken in a contractor and me just be very specific with this and on this what we're speaking of a broken heart and a contrite spirit is not self condemnation humility I think it's a very good statement that has been made humility is not thinking less of yourself it's thinking of yourself less let me repeat it humility is not thinking less of yourself it's thinking less it's not thinking less of yourself it's thinking less about yourself where you're not the one in the forefront you're not the one then it's always everything's about you that's humility so we understand because sometimes these things can get confused and oh I'm a poor Christian I'm a portrait that's not humility that's not humility humility is is where simplicity remember as a son and daughter of God God deals with our heart and quickly in our heart to say Lord it's not just in the times of repentance but it's always having open heart Lord lead me and guide me and direct to me don't let this be about me don't let it be about me o God thou wilt not despise I love that in this scripture isaiah 57:15 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and a humble spirit to revive that word revived there deals with making oh the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contract ones what a paradox in the scripture dwelleth I who is holy dwelleth in a high and holy place but yet notice what humility that he would come to revive the spirit of the humble to revive the heart of the contrite ones that's what real power is humility is real power hallelujah and in this you you realize that here was such a contrast even when the Lord Jesus was here and throughout and even in even in the world anybody that has many times any sort of a reputation or people want to make a reputation or they want to just let you know they know you and I both know we're not ignorant you can tell when people have an air about them almost like they're a little bit better I know a little bit more I know that's not humility humility is even when everything that can be known but is there a heart behind it is there a heart behind it is there a heart that's governed by the wisdom of God in that moment to know what to do this is where we have to continue think God to continue to grow look at this in Isaiah 66 thus saith the Lord the heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool where is the house that you build unto me and where is the place of my rest for all those things hath mine handmaid and all those things have been saith the Lord but to this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembling at my word humility draws the attention of God we've been reading from Exodus 20:5 and I'm not going to read back over that scripture but this is where we've been drawing and the inspiration coming from where God would one of the places that God would make known one of the compound redemptive names one of his compound redemptive names as Jehovah Rapha I am the Lord that healeth II but remember as God revealed that the need was the water is bitter and God showed Moses a tree and he was to cut that tree down and put it into the water there had to be something that he did this is a part of this is where it comes down to it requires humility to the word Moses could have looked and said what in the world but you see look these are things that what we realize when the inspiration is moving you and I can look back at that and say that's a type of Calvary because on the tree person is he hung on a tree he was wounded for my transgressions we can see our lives was filled with bitterness but because he became me that I might become him by grace the bitterness of my life now is made sweet in my soul I deal with bitterness maybe in our flesh and our spirit from all sorts of things that comes up sicknesses but yet that sweetness is what's able to provide for that bitterness we can see that as a type but you see they didn't see that and say well this is a type what I'm doing they didn't see it in that way but you say well then how were they doing it they were - the same inspiration that you and I are under tonight and you and I take courage and take faith within that they were walking under the channel of inspiration in that hour hallelujah David is moved and we these are familiar Scripture you're David cries out bless the Lord O my soul and all that's within me who forgiveth forgetting all all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all that diseases and it's very important I am the Lord that healeth all thy diseases it is him that healeth all our diseases it is him this is why here take of how when brother Branham would draw our attention over and over from the early all the way through and he would he would just let you and I know because he had people that were calling him a divine healer well he's a divine healer brother brands are not a divine healer he said if you preach salvation are you called a savior no we're pointing to a finished work is that right this is why this is why any man that claims to have in his hands that will if I'll have power in my hands to heal you I'll lay my hands on you Miliband said you remember that person is telling you something that's not true because there's no one in the world can heal anybody healing comes only from God Almighty and think of it in John we can go John 5:19 here is the Lord Jesus he even Jesus Christ he didn't even claim to be a healer are you with me he didn't even claim to be here remember when he went in healed he just just did not do that on self-will he said in John 5:19 I can do nothing remember when that was healed on this on the Sabbath day he did not just go over and heal the man how the self will know he was governed by the will of the Father my father worketh an I work as hitherto so it was not a no it was a submitting of his will to the will of God I tell you that's victory right there that's power right there that's restoring what was lost that's restoring what was in God's mind is where I will is surrendered to his will he said I said the son can do nothing in himself he only do that which the father sees him drew hallelujah so I brother branham would ticket pick it up I think in 64 1964 Christ identified the same in all generations that we had the wrong slant regarding prophets he said it was never he said of that a prophet that they themselves did anything it was God using that he said we've even had the wrong slant on the body of Jesus Christ he said it was not the body doing it it was God in Christ Jesus said I can do nothing it's my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works been said of a son of God didn't claim to be a divine healer how much more could a man said no man can do what Christ has already done program was asked a question what's your opinion on medicine brother Bannerman you know in many places still he answered but he comes back around he says look I'm the Lord that he loves all that diseases the Bible can't lie God heals by medicine God heals by love God heals by understanding God heals by care God heals by prayer God heals by miracles the whole thing God heals that's all there is to it he's the healer there's no medicine no medicine you could take will build tissue an antibiotic it only attacks those cells that's there it only attacks that which is there in your system is that right life is the healer that's why you could have a cut and here you die they could put all kinds of penicillin and everything else on that cut it'll never heal why life is the healer the penicillin and nothing else does the healing is the healer now look at this with naman naman here is a situation the sovereignty of God you can't look at this and other situation in the scripture even when it comes to your own life and not see the sovereignty of God that here in this captivity here so literally you ever thought about the young girl who was taken captive and here she is a servant in the house to naimans wife she might be wondering why am I here Here I am taken captive you know Here I am and in a situation I meant but let me just want a message we could preach on that she did not let her condition steal her joy she still knew there is a God in Israel I might be in the land of Syria but God knows right where I'm at she was still a testimony and a witness no matter where she was at and she's the one when she's seen the condition in naman she said would to God that he would go there to the Land of Israel because there is a prophet there that could recover him of his leprosy now somebody could read that or hear that and they could get the wrong thinking but to her she knew exactly what she was saying she knew that he was not the man but she knew God was press and fair in that Ministry of Elisha is that right that's what she was talking about he tried all the doctors think about this he tried no doubt he tried all the doctors how do I get better Neiman had a secret about his life a mighty man of Valor but he had a secret he had leprosy in his life let me just tell you something no matter what the secret is in your life you can look like a fine person and a good person and everything's right but is there a secret in your life is there a secret there of leprosy that needs to be healed God is the healer amen think of it she had such a witness in in her life not think of this there's not one case I'll read the scripture here in a moment there's not one case that this little young lady could point to and say there's been many cases of leprosy healed that was in any case that she could even point to now we're going to read that in the scripture in just a moment there was not one case that she could say you know there was this particular man I know or there was this one in Israel there were no cases of anybody else ever being healed of leprosy but you know what that didn't stop her from having a testimony say the Lord God can recover him of his leprosy because she believed there was no disease crater crater then God you and I if I say like this privileged spoiled I don't know if I would say it but many times God has has has made known so many things before you and I and I know I don't care what else other disease they come up with but many of the things that even the you and I can go through and don't Google it Google is not the prophet of the hour come on somebody oh I'm getting a little ache here I'm getting a little crook here I'm getting a little pain here what could this be wrong thing to look at what do I need to look at if there's anything that's gone wrong you first need to look to the Lord I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from winds come in my head my help cometh from the Lord because the first thing you know you're going on reading that junk and then you'll start talking about it at the dinner table and claiming that stuff and the more you talk about it your body will obey your confession [Applause] that's a little bit spilling over there he packed up many he was going to go by his healing he packed up gold packed up raiment but God was letting gonna let him know you can't purchase healing with your own goods you got to purchase it with a measure of faith that I give you don't have what's needed to purchase and release this healing but God had dealt to every man a measure of faith is that right so all the glory comes back to God oh ma but he made up his mind you know brother bran would say it like this he said he wanted to vine healing the way he had his mind he had made up in his mind this is the way that I'm gonna get it he shows up and here there's the Elijah you know a license you're sitting in here maybe y'all can't see it back there so maybe I'll do it up here here is Elijah maybe he's back there where brother Drake is that and he lashes back in his in the cave there brother Brent said he was reading the Bible reading the scriptures he was just back there and your cell phone was silenced it was turned off then okay nothing gonna distract me from my time with Jesus hello somebody come on now Elijah didn't even get up out of the chair he sent a messenger to go tell naman naman got an attitude you don't know who I am you don't see my ranks you see my rings jeiza come back in hey name it this guy's you know he's a you know he's a right-hand man to the king he's over there Kent did tell him I'm busy right now these are the words of prophets say in Paris I'm too busy right now I'm in a Bible study god help us to have grace for the pastor that way preach brother Samuel I think I will think about this here he sent him in there and here Elijah didn't even go out to him I wonder what people would have said regarding Elijah he's stuck up God forgive me for saying that but that's no you know this and that but you know what God knows what needs to be done he got a pack naming down a little bit Neiman's coming in there and he's trying to approach God as though we're eyeball to eyeball were level to level God said mm-hmm I'd well on the hind holy place I bow down to you grow repeated God and Amon got an attitude he got rough he went into a rage this to me when I look at this here this there is no way when we read here in the scripture let me just read in the scripture and then I'll preach for just a moment Luke 427 this is the testimony of the sovereignty of Almighty God of what took place in this time in the scripture we're reading about and Jesus points out the election and sovereignty of God and many lepers verse 27 were in Israel in the time of alias or in lie Elisha the prophet and none of them was cleansed look at your neighbor and say none of them none of them was cleansed many were in Israel but none of them was cleansed saving naman the Syrian let's be honest you and I looking at that attitude we might have thrown him out on his head you get an attitude you're getting rough you're in a rage but what mercy of God he's a Gentile what mercy of God how many others came to Elijah and they came there brother answered brats thousands of lepers in that day and not one of them were cleansed but here is a man that came up there and he had a thought he's going to come out and he will salute me and he will put his hand on the place and pray for me in the name of the Lord God of Israel he will put his hand on the play you know recover me of my leprosy and God lets me know that I it is not your thoughts that I'm coming to but you have got to think my thoughts hallelujah Oh glory be to God sometimes it's written friends the problem is it isn't the word of God it isn't well glad you haven't healed me yet it's about Lord let my thoughts let your thoughts become my thoughts and you can plan that across the board within anything there's a lot of things that we can fake well it didn't happen this way it's loaded in Scripture Jesus did not come and do what jumps are they ought to do but that didn't remove who John was it did not change are you with me it didn't change but you see all the while even here with name and what mercy of God there's no way in the world that God can heal can heal namin when he's mad and he's upset holding the grudge against somebody come on now help me preach he can't do that you see but God's desire is to heal him or what mercy think of his mercy for you and I you and actively man leavened his wife in my head but God said I've got to change the atmosphere in this person's life let me tell you something God is more determined to heal you than you are he's more determined to save you than you ought to be saved he's more determined to fill you with the Holy Ghost than you're determined if we got what we deserve he'd wipe his hands and walk away he would say you're ungrateful but God knows just like in Genesis 1 where it was dark and void their needs a change of atmosphere so he sends his word to bring healing to our lives to change the atmosphere hallelujah what mercy do we deserve it no no but God who is rich in mercy he has changed the atmosphere hmm many of them came but they weren't healed you're where when you read in the scripture in the Prophet Elias Elijah's ministry many things were done with symbol the ax head we've lost the ant said he said bring me a stick he put it in the water it didn't need the stick he could have said come the stick was a symbol it's active faith my sons are going to be taken captive what movements what must we do go borrow a bunch of vessels though al is coming but you're going to need vessels and you're gonna have to pour you see the Ministry of Elijah how it types the Ministry of Jesus Christ in his body it's the same ministry that was in Elijah in Elijah it is active it is the word being active in our lives remember when the Lord told him brother Branham an angel the Lord spoke to him he told him he said the only thing you have to do he says you're gonna pray for sick people and get them get them to believe you to believe you be sincere with your prayer and no disease would stand before your prayer I'm gonna read this he said now that doesn't mean my prayer has anything to do with it it's the people's faith he's always listening this he's always had an object somewhere for people to look at something he said the brass serpent the water in the Pool of Bethesda John five why was that water why there's no virtue in it it was just something for the people to do to step in Jesus went and spit on some mud and made a little cake and put it in a man's eye he didn't have to do that he didn't have to make put the mud on the man's eyes he could have said receive your sight eyes would have been created we've seen that in this very he didn't have to do that another man's ear split and touched his tongue where he spit and touched his tongue he didn't have to do that it was a symbol he said naman was supposed to dip seven times in the Jordan what he didn't have to do that it was just a symbol that the Prophet give him to do something to do and now watch how he brings this something for you to do God send some of us forth to do certain things he's breaking over into the ministry and when we see that God has proved what he said he was to that person and then God testifies the thing that the person testified of that makes it truth then we believe it and get well so what is it that God requires of us to do is to believe to believe what he has done in this generation and what are you still doing let me just say it very closely you may not you look at the story or the account of John five and looking at the Pool of Bethesda and you're reading it but to realize that itself was speaking of even when you in your heart you know the Spirit of God maybe you know can't even identify it in that term but you know there's something that's caught a hold in me right now there's something there's one who's speaking to me it is not that man who speaking to me and you recognize that God's presence is personal what is that it's the same one who sent the angel to trouble the water it's time to step into that don't try to figure it out is it for me I wonder if he made a mistake no it's in your heart and you know he's talking to you that's a supernatural experience robbed by a supernatural God it is a sin to disbelief it's to act upon that and do what he is asking you to do it's soul it's so real that if you don't you only become more hard once again you know he makes that he makes the same statement he says he told me if I'll get the people to believe when and then he said when I ask you to do something and you don't do it to God that is you don't believe it no matter what I tell you to do now those of you and all of us should be listening to the message that God has sent us in this ayah but you'll hear times on the platform go rejoicing the Lord make you well brother brems said I just can't say when they come up there you're healed there's a time where healing is pronounced their faith has already brought it brother brems said it's a supernatural something he said that God allows me at that time to pronounce that healing because it's already done and then you hear other times go on your way with dosing what they're rejoicing and sometimes you say go on testifying about it they're not as far as of where we're in that it sense it was a miracle right there they're walking off of there and it is based on will you rejoice will you testify of your healing I mean you're saying like this get up of a morning and straighten up your tie and say I'm healed you might be standing crooked in the mirror and you said I'm healed by his stripes I'm healed and all I'm talking about why is it he's the high priest of our confession he's a rock hey friends every one of us know you get around negative people it's a negative atmosphere let's speak the positive truth of God's Word Oh hallelujah you don't name it name and he had that leprosy until he obeyed muddy down there how bad you want heals he might have struggled with you know what he said there's rivers up here it's a lot better God didn't say up there God sent her out here and he he had to be spoken to hey if he'd asked you to do some big thing you'd have done it God's dealing with pride aren't you glad God deals with pride he knows just how to tap down our pride I mean you know you're not gonna get a special crown because you never took a Tylenol only thing you're doing to making yourself miserable now now if you can't take it that's fine but you understand what I'm saying these are not things that when we look at pride you can't choose the way that healing comes but our faith is in God God heals by all those different avenues oh mama brother BAM bringing this around here and this is where I want to bring this down to he deals with how he said you know many times he said people are more or less they're going after the gifts instead of the giver he's talking about many things then this particular message on divine love he's talking about even with healing he said we were left off the key the main key and we've rushed the door and it goes in and he deals with he said now the gift that I've got in my life right now no gram said I'm trying my best with the gift that God has given me to let you see that he loves you love produces faith Galatians 5:16 faith worketh by love love is a trust the scripture said in first John for there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us I think it's fitting in humility that when fear wants to make its approach that we can say Lord let love rise in my heart that perfect love don't ask fear do you think you can leave it cast it out Jesus never said ask Devils to leave he said cast him out glory be to God hallelujah perfect love cast out all fear hallelujah run withdraw and let me just lay these these parts in and he was dealing with this he said the idea isn't for you to touch me you need to touch him and he says the main thing he's telling the people as you're sitting here in this service and these are very important words the main thing is to set with an open heart and say Lord Jesus I believe the next statement very much like that he says if you'll just sit there and say Lord Jesus I love you Jesus Christ draws near no to set with an open heart and belief do you realize friends that is we're setting we're coming we're sitting right here whether words coming forth you realize healing itself can come right as the words coming for our faith can raise to that level we're even that goes beyond our thinking about our own face how many times that brother branham here under the inspiration concert or you didn't know you had that much faith did you but God already healed you it's tremendous but it's to set in a humility and say Lord I love you brother Brown takes this and I'm coming I'm gonna close on this brother branham brings here there's a man by the name of mr. cross and I want you to listen to this thinking about the little woman who was their captive in Syria would to God would to God but naman my lord that he would go to the Prophet that is in Israel he could recover him see she has a revelation of what she's saying naimans approach he's looking just at the man that God knows how to open his sight here's a man by the name of brother Kraus brother Ram speaks of it in a message divine love I've often thought about this many times the Lord is really quick and it to bring this out today this brother had been saved in in in in brother Oral Roberts ministry he's a fair friend a brother branham's friend of Oral Roberts and he will own one of the greatest plow companies or plow making companies in America and he had been saved Ram said he had received the new birth but he said one day he developed a sickness he said now you know you can put your trust in the wrong thing he said if you've got your trust in a man or in your church or in your organization you better take it off right now and put your love to Christ it won't work now he loved the Lord he developed the sickness and he loved the Lord now watch what he says here now and he said well oral brother Oral Roberts orals his representative so I'll just go to oral so he developed a serious trouble in his body and he goes out to dinner with brother Roberts he tells brother Roberts his testimony he said brother Roberts I've got a serious kidney condition brother Roberts said well the Lord will take care of that he walked over and prayed for him he said now don't you feel better yeah he said I I do feel better just after a few hours I was back again he went back to Hall Roberts two or three times again well he said it well he wouldn't do no good and the man gave the testimony brother brems in a meeting and brother branham heard him give this testimony he said what's the matter he said I know what I'll do I'll go down and stand before brother Branham and he will tell me my prophecy just exactly what caused it are you listening so he goes to Shreveport where I was trying night after not to get in the line couldn't get in the line no card he'd get a card but then he never get called to come in the line so I went from there to Mexico that failed him you know he says he goes back and he said to everyone he goes back after this he's tried to get to brother Branham and after this to everyone that he knowed this man brother Krause he gets to everyone he knows that was preaching divine healing and he had them pray and lay hands on him it didn't do no good he would be like here he's come to hold Roberts he comes in - you know - brother Brannon he couldn't get to brother branham get in the line so he goes through you know you don't have this maybe let's say it's on his phone he gets his contact list and the grouping is divine healers or those who pray for the sick and he's going through there he calls this one sends a text to this one hey when's your next meeting gonna be I want to be right there hey I want to be right there I'm gonna go to this meeting hey I'm gonna be right there I'm gonna go to this meeting it would look like by the statement they are God's representative but God is a jealous God he will not share his glory with no one you with me even though God works through that ministry God will share no glory with any flesh it's all God so he went to male brothers the doctors did some tests on him and they told him you've got one chance out of 10,000 of ever coming off the table he said I guess this is it I want you to really hone in right here so he goes home and he prays he said Lord Jesus you knowed my walk beforehand you know my walk now you know that how I've tried to live for you I've done everything I've testified the businessmen across the country I've give my entire life ever since I become a Christian four or five years ago to serve you here it has at the end of the road this is what's very important I love you Lord I've only got one way out now and that's maybe if I could have the operation I'm just trusting you he went back told the doctor he said sign me up for the operation and he went to go to sleep in there preparing him for operation he said well now Lord you know I love you I want you to know that I love you and I have to if I have to down the operating tally on the operating table I left you with all my heart the Rebbe said he went to sleep under the ether the anesthesia praising the Lord because he loved him love had come to its end he loved brother Roberts brother Roberts as a man he loved me I'm a he looked out their brethren brother Valdez and many of the others they were men but then when he found out that all the men had failed he only had one thing to look at that was Christ that's the one now he's on the right track was not all Roberts's representative he was was not brother branham the prophet of the age is represented he was he is was not brother Valdez a representative he indeed was but you see God can see where the focus is that if it was focused upon if I can just get to this man if I can just get to this man it's not the man you need to get to its get to Jesus Christ understand this is the same thing that happens with people if I can just go to this church I'll live a victorious life maybe I need to go to this church I'll live a victorious life correction you need to get in Jesus Christ and then you'll live a victorious life so when he was in the operating room he said Lord if I die I love you with all my heart they say I've got one chance out of 10,000 the best doctors in the world one chance out of 10,000 let's think about this bill joy here he is he's going under that anesthesia good I love you yeah if I die from this operating him he didn't know he was coming out of that operation alive he didn't know that this sounds like the Hebrew children here in Lee sounds like Daniel they didn't know what was going to happen but what he said is I love you I love you with all my heart and when he woke up from that operation the whole room was lit up with the glory of God the doctors were astounded at the glory of the Lord that filled that room Wow because one of his children think of it he dwelleth in a high and holy place pundants ended and was worshipped by one of his children one of his children better that was wounded there in his body but that didn't stop his praise I love you if this is my end I love you I just want you to round Lord I love you and the glory of the Lord filled that room where the branch says see he got normally and well within just a few days he never seen anything take place like that he said but what it was when the lung when divine love had been projected in the right direction what was the Ministry of Malacca for that to turn our hearts get it in the right direction aren't you glad that you can recognize the God of Elijah aren't you glad that you can recognize that that same God he is the same yesterday today and forever aren't you grateful that when you can hear the Ministry of Malachi for that who you see is Jesus Christ why others see just a man but you don't see a man you see Jesus Christ and others look at and say well that's brother Branham that's brother Branham know what you and I we know we don't see that or we don't see brother rather what we see is Jesus Christ it has made this Bible become a new book to you and I why divine love is in the right direction it can be so close it's God's representative it's God's prophet but to recognize naman had a testimony I'm coming before God's prophet but his approach was not in humility but God knows how to work with us to bring us in the right direction aren't you glad about that but the joy he just takes that scope and says it's a little off right here let's tighten this right off aren't you glad for that brother Dave he just tightens it right off and says now you're hitting the target I'm so glad about that there's not one of us here in this building tonight that at some point in time or another haven't been like mainland oh maybe you weren't rolfe or maybe you weren't in a range but there's some times where you've questioned why I thought it was going to be like this I thought it was going to be like this now listen to me take your thoughts and put it in the hands of God if you came and were prayed for and you went out and said how I'll feel no different I thought put your thoughts in the hands of God and you stand upon what God has made known to you if you came and you stood here for prayer or in your seat you said lord I receive it however God dealt with you you stand on that little salmon you don't know my symptoms symptoms are the biggest liar it is the biggest enemy of faith I'm not saying if you get worse like you know for example you might get worse hear you after you're prayed for and then you've got to call an ambulance don't struggle with whether to call an ambulance or not go ahead and get in the ambulance and say thank you Lord for my healing don't be defeated don't let the devil try to defeat you because all healing comes from God I hope it's a big help and I really mean that with all my heart because there's so many different ways that when we come and we approach things within healing but I my heart's desire is lord knows where we're at he knows what we're going through he knows what we will come through but I said god help us to be so zeroed in and help us that this would be it it would just help us that our faith would increase within him wants me to dip in the Jordan seven times I want to do that the dipping in the Jordan of seven times is to do and be in obedience to what God is telling you to do my healing is gonna come that way sometimes the way our healing comes but the Bram talked about a man in greatest battle ever fought the man had a dream he thought it was brother brems said joki and he came in told brother Branham the dream for the Rams had come to find out what he thought was joking was the very answer for his wife's healing sometimes the way that we're thinking about things I think it's safe to say we can say lord help me to think your thoughts there's nothing wrong to have expectations friends then let our expectations be on the Lord it's like Noah I love how brother Ram brings that would Noah Noah got in the Ark and he told his family he said get ready God's just set the door it's gonna rain next day come up no rain so Noah said it's coming tomorrow y'all get ready no rain did that for seven days but Graham said one of his family members reached over to him let me bring this up today and said have you seen that video on YouTube that they have posted about you Prophet Noah here you have built a boat out in the middle of dried ground you didn't even build it where boats are built to be launched and now you have said this daddy this is where brother brems says it in conflict between God and Satan daddy has it all been a mistake oh no son he said the Lord spoke to me and told me to build this Ark it's gonna rain and we're in the place of safety I might have had certain expectations but that don't change who I am and who he is so what are you gonna do falling in love with Jesus come on musicians falling in love with Jesus while I'm waiting falling in love with geez
