[43:12] shall we just turn our scriptures to
[43:15] Hebrews chapter 4
[43:21] and we reinvest 8 to 11 Hebrews chapter
[43:28] 4 yeah the state
[43:44] for if Jesus had given them rest then
[43:48] will he not afterward have spoken of
[43:51] another day
[43:52] Mary Manette therefore arrest to the
[43:55] people of God for he that is entered
[43:58] into his rest he also had seized from
[44:02] his own works as God did from his let us
[44:07] labor therefore to enter into that rest
[44:09] lest hidden man fall after the same
[44:13] example of unbelief Romans chapter 8
[44:20] verse 2 to 4 Romans 8 verse 2 for the
[44:33] law of the spirit of life in Christ
[44:35] Jesus has made me free from the law of
[44:37] sin and death what the law could not do
[44:41] in that it was weak through the flesh
[44:44] God sending his own son in the likeness
[44:47] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[44:51] sin in the flesh now the righteousness
[44:54] of the law might be fulfilled in us who
[44:57] walk not after the flesh but after the
[45:00] spirit may the Lord that is blessing to
[45:03] the reading of his word amen
[45:05] shall we take our seat
[45:16] well I'm happy again to be in the house
[45:19] of God I agree with David he said I was
[45:26] glad when they asked me to go to the
[45:28] house of God because I surely believe
[45:31] that identity realize that in the house
[45:33] of God there is Liberty Alleluia in the
[45:38] house of God there is forgiveness of sin
[45:41] in the house of God is power of gosselin
[45:46] to heal your sickness in the house of
[45:51] God
[45:53] everything is at our disposal amen
[45:58] so this morning we want to talk on a
[46:01] topic change of law it's very unusual
[46:07] but that is what is on my heart changer
[46:11] of law we change the situation's Amen
[46:17] when we are talking about the changer of
[46:20] law then of I believe strongly that we
[46:25] are referring to the one who made the
[46:27] law amen
[46:34] you see many times
[46:38] Mundek law and other men come and change
[46:43] that law is that it you remember that
[46:52] there are so many laws especially in the
[46:55] political arenas a president who you
[47:01] know Institute alone upon a nation and
[47:07] another one will come and take the same
[47:11] law and make it useless
[47:15] you mean what I wanna say what I mean
[47:20] not quite long we heard about something
[47:24] called they say Johnson's amendment bill
[47:26] or something like what has happened to
[47:28] die not here in America but all over the
[47:35] world in where I came from there was a
[47:41] president who built a presidential
[47:46] palace because we didn't have one and
[47:50] when he built it he named the place
[47:54] golden jubilee house
[47:59] golden jubilee house but the other party
[48:05] that opposes this party that built the
[48:10] presidential palace they didn't like it
[48:13] so they came to power and change the
[48:18] name of the palace and call it flat star
[48:23] house fortunately for the party dubbed
[48:29] the presidential palace they have read
[48:31] more an election and they have come back
[48:34] to change the same thing again to the
[48:37] goodness of Nestle order so there is
[48:41] confusion here confusion day so when we
[48:46] are talking about the change of law we
[48:49] are not talking about a man but we are
[48:52] talking about our God that we worship he
[48:56] is only one that make a law and no man
[49:00] can change it if there has to be a
[49:05] change to take him himself to make the
[49:09] change so when we are talking about a
[49:12] change of law we are not talking about
[49:14] any man on earth we are talking about
[49:16] our God hallelujah we know that he is
[49:23] able to change situations God is able to
[49:27] change the atmosphere
[49:31] God is able to change the ration of the
[49:34] wind right now he is able to change the
[49:38] skies hallelujah God for that matter
[49:45] don't need anybody's advice to do
[49:48] whatever he desired to do amen and we
[49:55] know that in a beginning
[49:57] he given laws to his people to live by
[50:01] now when we even talk about law what is
[50:05] the meaning of law law or the law or a
[50:10] law we know that every law goes with
[50:14] punishment because I profess that every
[50:18] law without punishment is vain so when
[50:22] we talk about law we are talking about a
[50:23] written or understood rule that consents
[50:28] behavior from people and pair up there
[50:33] are consequences because law is made for
[50:38] man to live by rate ma when we talk
[50:45] about commandment it has almost the same
[50:47] mean is the act of commanded or
[50:48] exercising authority to somebody press
[50:53] something upon you it's a commandment
[50:56] becomes a law if I have power right now
[51:02] in America and I say nobody should eat
[51:04] ice-cream again if you dare go and eat
[51:09] icecream
[51:10] you'll be in trouble isn't it yes sir
[51:17] if I do that I know that many people
[51:21] cannot stay by it
[51:24] yes because many people here will not
[51:29] miss the ice cream for a day last year
[51:35] my groceries are happy to be in a is it
[51:39] oh my
[51:42] I think Toledo and some of the brothers
[51:44] took me to a place I've forgotten the
[51:48] name of the play but they introduced me
[51:51] to one of the ladies over there say oh
[51:53] these are a brother a missionary from
[51:55] Africa Anna the umma was so happy to see
[51:57] me and I fight it excited you know
[52:00] telling me asking me so many things
[52:02] about Africa and then she turn around
[52:05] and ask me what is what is there what is
[52:08] there oh my he put his something where I
[52:12] forgotten how to put it he said what is
[52:18] is that some like what is they they're
[52:21] horrible things of seeing you know in
[52:24] America since I came well and I said the
[52:29] horrible thing I've seen that women
[52:32] smoke more than me that's what I noticed
[52:35] and then she laughed because she too and
[52:47] as she asked me what is the funniest
[52:50] thing I saw were the funniest thing is
[52:53] that almost every American like ice
[52:55] cream in a so I know that if I easy to
[53:02] allure right now to change that I am
[53:05] bringing a bed into some people and
[53:07] alluvia so brother does just by the way
[53:11] now we know that our God give law to his
[53:16] people to liberate but they were not
[53:20] able to live by that law amen
[53:23] but that law people work on them and
[53:26] killed because they were not justified
[53:29] buried in a but don't knew that it was
[53:34] time to impose that on them
[53:37] he didn't put it to kill them he had his
[53:42] reason of doing that I understand what
[53:46] we are meaning so because they were not
[53:51] justified by that law it became death to
[53:56] them because after the forest did every
[54:00] law there is penalty to reach you
[54:04] understand that you know you remember
[54:07] that in the Bible one time on a Sabbath
[54:11] day there was a man who did it honor
[54:14] that that's how bad the Bible that I
[54:18] shall win he I'm sorry he went on a
[54:20] third to break sticks and people saw him
[54:25] and he told Moses Moses look at what is
[54:28] happening the man didn't honor this a
[54:34] lot Moses said I'll bring him and they
[54:38] put him somewhere I said law Moses stood
[54:40] Allah let me wait and hear from God
[54:44] because before I'll take decision and so
[54:48] by captain David Moses stood I put that
[54:50] kill him because God said we should kill
[54:54] him
[54:54] and they killed a man because he broke
[54:59] the law hallelujah he broke the law now
[55:06] we remember also that the same law was
[55:12] made for righteousness but they could
[55:17] not lead by rate if instrument children
[55:22] were taken to the elders to be stoned to
[55:26] death he will have a child in those days
[55:30] who don't want to respect you who don't
[55:35] want to listen to your advice because
[55:38] the Bible says that we should train up
[55:39] then the way they should go so that when
[55:41] they'll grow they will not depart from
[55:43] it
[55:45] so even have a stubborn child a stiff
[55:48] neck a child the law says that take that
[55:52] child to the others and you do justice
[55:56] to his flesh can we read it quickly in
[56:01] the that is cutting deuteronomy chapter
[56:03] 21 yeah datura me chapter 21 verse 18
[56:25] yeah he says if a man had a stubborn and
[56:30] a rebellious son which will not obey the
[56:33] voice of the Father or the voice of his
[56:37] mother and that when they have just in
[56:41] him will not hear him unto them then
[56:47] shall his father and his mother lay hold
[56:49] on him and bring him out unto the elders
[56:52] of this of his City and on to the gate
[56:56] of his place and they shall say unto the
[57:00] elders of his City this our son is
[57:04] stubborn and rebellious he will not obey
[57:08] our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard
[57:12] and all the men of his City shall stone
[57:16] him with poles that he died so shalt
[57:21] thou put evil away from among you and
[57:24] all Israel shall hear and fear that was
[57:30] a condition of a day under the law today
[57:34] who will be able to do that will you
[57:39] have what it takes to take your son to
[57:45] the police station and tell the police
[57:49] shoot my son because his problem it
[57:53] doesn't want to listen to my advice can
[57:55] you do that today
[57:56] you can you do that yeah I'm certainly I
[58:00] know that you can do that because it is
[58:02] not applicable now MA there is a place
[58:08] also that the Bible say that even
[58:11] bastard children don't enter into
[58:12] cognition
[58:13] for ten generations but today we go
[58:18] about preaching to all the people
[58:21] directing them to Jesus Christ we don't
[58:24] ask them are you a bastard or not do we
[58:28] do that No
[58:32] because there has been a change of law
[58:38] the one that met that law has come to
[58:43] change the law in fact when you read the
[58:47] message
[58:47] I think kress of God Christ is the
[58:50] mission of God revealed there's a play
[58:52] that a prophet made a statement he said
[58:54] God didn't come to change the law but I
[58:56] came to magnify it yes sir
[58:59] God came to magnify the law but a
[59:03] procedure is what we are talking about
[59:07] now any he change it for our good even
[59:16] because the pastor is the pastor would
[59:19] not enter into the congregation of God
[59:22] for pain generations there you are
[59:24] talking about so many hundred of years
[59:29] hallelujah but today we have the golden
[59:34] scripture that is reflecting in a life
[59:38] of all the children of God that for God
[59:41] so loved the world that He gave His only
[59:43] begotten Son that whosoever believeth in
[59:45] him will not perish but have everlasting
[59:49] life amen and amen
[59:53] so because of this condition whereby man
[59:59] could not lead by all the law could not
[1:00:01] make the person righteous
[1:00:05] grace was provided hallelujah grace was
[1:00:11] provided for us for the atonement and
[1:00:15] that was the introduction of the Lamb of
[1:00:19] God to wash our sins away
[1:00:25] so therefore what the law could not do
[1:00:28] that grace has come to do it
[1:00:33] the introduction of grace have come to
[1:00:37] do it all brother and my sister so the
[1:00:43] giver of the law came and change it
[1:00:44] whether you believe in that or not ask
[1:00:49] Roma's is saying here right now
[1:00:54] yes Romans 8 verse 2 again he says for
[1:00:58] the law of the spirit of life in Christ
[1:01:01] Jesus hath made me free from the law of
[1:01:04] sin and death amen because the spirit of
[1:01:12] life was in Christ Jesus and the spirit
[1:01:17] which was in the law was dead that is
[1:01:22] how when you break the law you die amen
[1:01:27] so it means the law couldn't produce
[1:01:29] life to the people but price has come to
[1:01:34] introduce life to us oh praise God for
[1:01:41] what the law could not do in that it was
[1:01:45] weak through the flesh okay it was weak
[1:01:50] the law could not penetrate our flesh in
[1:01:54] fact its profits our our flesh the Lord
[1:01:59] met our flesh we saw stubborn you
[1:02:03] understand it could not penetrate okay
[1:02:07] so it was weak through the flesh God
[1:02:09] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:02:13] sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin
[1:02:16] in the flesh so what the law could not
[1:02:21] do on our flesh the spirit of life which
[1:02:24] is in Christ Jesus has come to do it
[1:02:27] oh my that direction Asst of the law
[1:02:31] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[1:02:35] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:02:39] notice how we are spiritual people
[1:02:41] sitting here in the presence of God this
[1:02:43] morning we are not living on our flesh
[1:02:47] even though we live in this flash we are
[1:02:50] not living on the flesh but we live on
[1:02:52] the Spirit of Christ which has given us
[1:02:55] a new life amen
[1:03:00] are you following carefully let me go
[1:03:07] something from spiritual adoption
[1:03:09] quickly then I'll come back he says
[1:03:12] later this morning and a tango that we
[1:03:16] are in this morning cast our eyes away
[1:03:19] from self-righteousness or something
[1:03:22] that we have done I do not plead for law
[1:03:26] I cannot be judged by the law or because
[1:03:30] I'm lawless no one kept the law there
[1:03:34] cool not keep the law and other can you
[1:03:38] save yourself now that can you heal
[1:03:42] yourself and if the law by your own
[1:03:47] manmad will you wanted to project that
[1:03:50] to the plan then there is only one thing
[1:03:54] required by the law if you fail that is
[1:03:58] justice you understand what would be if
[1:04:04] you want to live by the law then the
[1:04:07] only thing that is required when you
[1:04:09] fail is justice and justice is to be
[1:04:13] condemned and died forever
[1:04:16] it requires total annihilation because
[1:04:22] he that breaks one point of the law is
[1:04:24] guilty of all the law so you must die
[1:04:32] but God as we look at God's law and we
[1:04:36] look at God's justice
[1:04:38] who dares to Jesus who present God's
[1:04:42] love not law not justice but in him was
[1:04:48] met the fulfillment of both law and
[1:04:51] justice he said this is my beloved son
[1:04:57] no more self-made stuff but listen to
[1:05:02] your tutor that is a reason Peter who
[1:05:05] say thou are the Christ the Son of the
[1:05:08] Living God law and justice was met in
[1:05:12] Christ and if God loved to the human
[1:05:16] race
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:19] he ramada there was a time that I said
[1:05:22] how did it come to destroy the law but I
[1:05:25] came to fulfill the law so the professor
[1:05:29] that law and justice was met in Jesus
[1:05:31] Christ hallelujah let's continue now we
[1:05:41] took this test out of Deuteronomy it's a
[1:05:45] Greek word
[1:05:45] I am quoting okay which has a compound
[1:05:49] meaning or it means to loss that's a
[1:05:54] Greek word autonomy and that is just
[1:06:00] what got us to different laws and one of
[1:06:06] them is a law of death and the other one
[1:06:11] is a law of life so this morning I asked
[1:06:15] you a person which of this laws are you
[1:06:19] entitled to the law of that or the law
[1:06:23] of life I certainly know your choice and
[1:06:28] I know you certainly know my choice he
[1:06:32] says to follow him and serve him and
[1:06:35] worship Him as life
[1:06:38] to reject him as death there is two laws
[1:06:43] in God now one of those laws was met
[1:06:47] recognized to the world
[1:06:50] at Messina God gave the law to Moses and
[1:06:54] Israel not that the law can help them
[1:06:58] but the law only pointed out to them
[1:07:01] that they were sinners and that's what
[1:07:05] the Lord does to us that they were
[1:07:09] sinners until data they didn't know what
[1:07:12] sin was to be hot a law there cannot be
[1:07:17] a law without a penalty hello is not a
[1:07:22] law without penalty so therefore the
[1:07:25] transgression of the law
[1:07:27] is sin and the witness of sin is death
[1:07:30] so therefore until God made them a law
[1:07:33] there was no transgression upon to them
[1:07:36] if there is no law here that said you
[1:07:41] can't run over 20 miles an hour then you
[1:07:43] can do that but when there is a law says
[1:07:47] you can't do it
[1:07:48] then there is a law and a penalty behind
[1:07:50] it you know so it took Moses to the
[1:07:58] mountain and gave him the law to his
[1:08:00] people and when you realize that the law
[1:08:06] could not help them he took his own son
[1:08:09] Jesus Christ to another mountain and
[1:08:13] demonstrated life meaning he took their
[1:08:19] law and nail it on the cross are the
[1:08:21] Bible talks about because the law could
[1:08:26] not produce righteousness to us
[1:08:28] so therefore a time came that God has to
[1:08:31] come down and change it hallelujah for
[1:08:36] you and I Oh gracious god amen and amen
[1:08:43] you know you know the mean of Sinai
[1:08:48] ponds
[1:08:51] pause or a 20 thing something that can
[1:08:55] pierce your flesh like when you go to
[1:08:58] the hospital nobody want injection
[1:09:01] because the injection is more or less a
[1:09:04] tone
[1:09:05] she is your flesh nobody liked it and
[1:09:11] that the mean of scenario so the lobby
[1:09:14] kept at all in the life of the people
[1:09:18] they were also they were always
[1:09:20] suffering by the law they were all
[1:09:22] almost dying by the law it could not
[1:09:25] produce righteousness for them but God
[1:09:30] meant boot for his people God did not
[1:09:34] mean evil for his people he meant good
[1:09:37] always for his people so he made a way
[1:09:40] for us to come to him not by our merit
[1:09:45] not by what we have done about what he
[1:09:47] has done for us he made an email
[1:09:51] hallelujah
[1:09:56] let's read quickly galatians chapter
[1:10:00] chapter 2
[1:10:07] yes galatians chapter 2 we already in
[1:10:11] verse 19
[1:10:18] for I through the law I am dead to the
[1:10:22] law that I might live unto God I am
[1:10:26] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:10:30] live yet not i but Christ liveth in me
[1:10:35] and the life which I now live in the
[1:10:39] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:10:42] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:10:48] hallelujah I do not frustrate the grace
[1:10:51] of God for if righteousness come by the
[1:10:55] law then Christ is dead in vain if
[1:11:02] righteousness come by the law then
[1:11:04] Christ is dead in vain
[1:11:08] but righteousness didn't come by the law
[1:11:12] but righteousness and by the death of
[1:11:15] Jesus Christ which was Grace for his
[1:11:17] people
[1:11:22] that is why we cherish all that the Lord
[1:11:26] has done for us
[1:11:28] under the grease but greater not mean
[1:11:33] disgrace grace means acknowledgment of
[1:11:42] what he was supposed to do but you are
[1:11:46] not able to do and someone has done it
[1:11:49] for you that is grace amen
[1:11:54] you have a butt load of so many piece
[1:11:57] you are not able to carry it somebody's
[1:12:01] all my brother my sister let me give her
[1:12:03] half a hand
[1:12:05] okay and he grabbed the tips off from
[1:12:08] your head and put it on his back so will
[1:12:14] you will you just say that okay he would
[1:12:16] have carried mine and load from my head
[1:12:18] they have to carry me also at your back
[1:12:22] it can work that way so grace that don't
[1:12:27] mean this grace
[1:12:30] hallelujah grace means the righteousness
[1:12:33] of God that will be made manifest in
[1:12:35] your life amen and amen
[1:12:40] I with me I am quoting from the message
[1:12:48] called law it's another beautiful type
[1:12:52] of the believer today coming believing
[1:12:56] lay his hands upon Christ and there at
[1:13:00] the altar or in his seat wherever he
[1:13:04] meets Christ lay hands upon him at
[1:13:07] Calvary and realizing that all that
[1:13:11] agony and suffering belongs to you and
[1:13:15] in your soul deep regrets and sorrows
[1:13:17] comes with your hands upon him you are
[1:13:22] changed hallelujah you will never be the
[1:13:27] same it is taking the condemnation away
[1:13:31] from you because you have laid your
[1:13:33] hands upon Jesus Christ
[1:13:36] he under the law being a shadow the man
[1:13:41] went away justified but still with the
[1:13:44] same desire because the animals blood
[1:13:48] could not wash your sins away ok it was
[1:13:53] just a shadow of everything that was
[1:13:56] coming to happen
[1:13:57] so as he lay his hands upon the animal
[1:14:01] and when the animals was being killed
[1:14:05] you know the shake of the animal you
[1:14:08] know it's reflected in the in the in the
[1:14:12] flesh or the body of the sinner so the
[1:14:16] property Cena after it is done like that
[1:14:19] he will go justified at that moment but
[1:14:23] still having that desire of sin upon him
[1:14:28] so he could not be justified even though
[1:14:32] you're Daniel sacrifice but still remain
[1:14:34] a sinner but uncovering when Christ was
[1:14:39] being killed and you and I
[1:14:42] and all the chosen generations when we
[1:14:45] lay our hands upon Jesus Christ our
[1:14:48] guilt went away from us amen amen
[1:14:54] because he's pudding for us we could not
[1:14:59] go by the law so he brought in that
[1:15:03] precious grace and he took our position
[1:15:06] and he we took his position hallelujah
[1:15:11] so we are changed you will never be the
[1:15:17] same brother sister and I stuck in the
[1:15:20] condemnation away from you amen
[1:15:24] yes sir let us say he was caught
[1:15:27] committing adultery on a server it was
[1:15:29] the love could not change that person
[1:15:33] because that Londo Havasu in a gallon
[1:15:39] didn't help what it takes to bring a
[1:15:43] shady life to the sinner but the love
[1:15:47] that has what it takes to bring a change
[1:15:52] upon the sinners life what the love of
[1:15:56] God that was slain from the foundation
[1:15:58] of the world
[1:15:59] Oh
[1:16:03] gracious God have mercy upon your
[1:16:04] children amen and amen
[1:16:07] so Paul SATA how do not frustrate the
[1:16:12] grace of God for if righteousness come
[1:16:14] by the law then Christ is dead in vain
[1:16:19] don't let us frustrated agrees brother
[1:16:23] sister I am serious this morning don't
[1:16:26] let us frustrate the grace because
[1:16:31] frustration is not good in our lives you
[1:16:35] know that frustration I know that
[1:16:40] sometimes when somebody want to
[1:16:41] frustrate reality you are you flora you
[1:16:44] are ready to slap someone
[1:16:46] because somebody's flow stretching you
[1:16:48] so what would you like if you don't love
[1:16:51] to be frustrated why would you like to
[1:16:54] frustrate the grace of God and maybe you
[1:17:01] don't know where sometimes frustrate the
[1:17:04] Spirit of God and I'm going to discuss
[1:17:07] with you
[1:17:10] anything that you need not to be angry
[1:17:16] or annoying
[1:17:17] they were annoying you are frustrating
[1:17:20] the spirit anything little thing then
[1:17:26] you flare up you are ready to box when
[1:17:33] your brother step on you at all you are

[1:18:49] you know that the frustration of the
[1:18:51] spirit or the grace of God you know
[1:18:55] frustrating the spirit because
[1:18:58] brother/sister it has come to a turn
[1:19:00] they'll show up not like that if you are
[1:19:02] not here there is no change can you
[1:19:08] imagine if I decide not to come to check
[1:19:10] today
[1:19:11] my brother decide not to come my sister
[1:19:14] desire not to compare us all of us we
[1:19:18] desire not to come to church
[1:19:20] how old are some well preach amen
[1:19:27] do you think it'd be reasonable for
[1:19:30] brass Amma to come and stand behind a
[1:19:32] pulpit and there is no soul on the
[1:19:35] benches and someone will come and see
[1:19:39] breasts somewhere stunning and the law
[1:19:42] said and Allah said and Allah said who
[1:19:46] is there to say Amen to it so what
[1:19:50] happened we are frustrating the grace of
[1:19:53] God my brother and sister look we should
[1:19:58] not reach the point to think that
[1:20:01] because we are message believers and
[1:20:03] that is all there is something more to
[1:20:07] that
[1:20:10] if we have mustard believers we must
[1:20:12] fulfill the word he said we should also
[1:20:17] set the Assembly of ourselves together I
[1:20:20] want somebody to tell me the meaning of
[1:20:22] the scripture here are mistaken he said
[1:20:26] we should not forsake the assembling of
[1:20:27] ourselves together meaning every meeting
[1:20:33] be we must make sure that we are in
[1:20:35] church will you say Amen here well if
[1:20:40] you don't like what I'm saying just be
[1:20:41] quiet
[1:20:42] but if you love what I'm saying say Amen
[1:20:45] to it because I don't want you to
[1:20:48] prostrate the Holy Spirit it's in you
[1:20:52] you have the Holy Ghost in you but if
[1:20:55] you don't check on you can frustrate it
[1:20:57] well I know I know and let me be sincere
[1:21:01] that I know that sometimes the condition
[1:21:04] of your work some situations in your
[1:21:08] screws I know that will not emit you yes
[1:21:12] I know that but what about those who
[1:21:16] have nothing nothing at all and it was
[1:21:19] just get up in this area or today oh oh
[1:21:25] today I think I'm tired you are tired to
[1:21:32] come to church then you must be equally
[1:21:36] tired to go to the Pizza Hut
[1:21:41] you must be equally tired to go to Bob
[1:21:46] Evans you must be equally tired to go to
[1:21:51] Cracker Barrell or whatever you call it
[1:21:55] yes sir because the soul also must be
[1:21:59] fed which is very important than living
[1:22:02] the flesh one hallelujah Paul say that I
[1:22:07] will not prostrate the grace of God for
[1:22:13] if righteousness come by the law then
[1:22:15] Christ died in vain but I tell God that
[1:22:20] Jesus Christ didn't die in vain he died
[1:22:24] to manifest his power in you and in our
[1:22:29] Oh glory be to his holy name amen and
[1:22:35] amen
[1:22:36] yes sir let me call this from God shows
[1:22:40] in place of worship I with me now he
[1:22:50] says there was also two covenants given
[1:22:56] to the people we are going to speak of
[1:22:58] it this morning we are speaking on it he
[1:23:02] says one of them was given to Adam on
[1:23:05] condition if you do this and don't do
[1:23:10] that
[1:23:11] but Darla was broken Adam and Eve
[1:23:15] brought that in the Garden of Eden then
[1:23:19] God made the second covenant and give
[1:23:22] that to Abraham and the law was
[1:23:26] unconditional it isn't what you have
[1:23:31] done or what you will do he said I've
[1:23:35] already done it
[1:23:39] hallelujah not what you do or not what
[1:23:43] you are going to do not what you ought
[1:23:47] to do but what God had already done for
[1:23:51] us we only acknowledge and appreciate it
[1:23:57] amen and amen Oh hallelujah he said that
[1:24:04] is grace that is the law of life okay
[1:24:10] the first law was the law of death but
[1:24:13] this one is the law of life do not
[1:24:18] forget that is that God did that for
[1:24:20] Agra or Abraham and his feet after him
[1:24:24] that is all
[1:24:26] Abraham seats and the Bible said it amen
[1:24:32] but the law of God was through Christ
[1:24:35] which was a branch royal seat that by
[1:24:38] grace or Israel he saved that is all
[1:24:43] that is in Christ he is saved and that
[1:24:47] is God's second covenant praised be the
[1:24:51] name of our God hallelujah so if it is
[1:24:54] this way then why was somebody think
[1:25:01] that it is his horn weird something that
[1:25:08] is able to do it is greasy that is the
[1:25:14] reason why in the time of Martin Luther
[1:25:17] when the log pick him up
[1:25:19] to speak against the thing that was
[1:25:22] going on in the room and color change
[1:25:24] that that people need to understand that
[1:25:27] you have to pay for your sins they get
[1:25:30] huge sums of money so that they can want
[1:25:34] you to live in sin because after all I
[1:25:36] have paid for my sins perhaps of about 1
[1:25:39] million dollars in my pocket I just give
[1:25:41] to the church a church take it the year
[1:25:47] ahead of me I have the right to do
[1:25:49] whatever I want to do
[1:25:51] was it just travel if you don't have
[1:25:56] money they have to do penance you have
[1:26:00] to touch on your budget to pay for your
[1:26:02] C's is that whatever say so therefore
[1:26:07] God told Martin Luther he said speak to
[1:26:09] the people they just shall live by faith
[1:26:13] and a lot drug damn from that bondage we
[1:26:20] all know what happened during that time
[1:26:22] until he came to a child they wanted to
[1:26:25] kill the man Martin Luther but because
[1:26:29] it was the chosen one at that time God
[1:26:32] protected him from all those allowed and
[1:26:37] today somebody can tell me that you need
[1:26:42] to punish your body before you be
[1:26:46] accepted somebody would tell me they
[1:26:52] need to pay monies before it can be
[1:26:55] accepted no brother no sister hallelujah
[1:27:02] it has already been done
[1:27:06] what the law was to make us do and we
[1:27:11] were not able to do it the Lord has done
[1:27:14] it for us and it's already done we are
[1:27:19] only manifesting what he did brother
[1:27:25] sister remember that we is not to be
[1:27:27] this way we used not to be this way and
[1:27:32] we've been in churches and you call us
[1:27:37] up appreciate but you know that you are
[1:27:40] not able to live a Christian life until
[1:27:43] you came to the knowledge of the truth
[1:27:46] it's one team call yourself a Christian
[1:27:49] and I know nothing
[1:27:50] knowing that knowledge of truth
[1:27:54] you can call yourself a Christian when
[1:27:56] you are not a Christian but above all
[1:28:00] say that and the truth shall make you
[1:28:04] free the truth shall make you free so
[1:28:11] the only thing that'll make you free is
[1:28:13] when you come to the knowledge of the
[1:28:14] truth and what is the truth the prophets
[1:28:19] say that when we are talking about the
[1:28:21] Holy Ghost Holy Ghost horny ghost in the
[1:28:24] revealed Word of God in your day but
[1:28:30] today many people claim to be Holy Ghost
[1:28:32] filled people and they are not able to
[1:28:36] come in terms with a message then tell
[1:28:42] them to act themself what kind of Holy
[1:28:44] Ghost is in them because if it is the
[1:28:48] real Holy Ghost of God that is in you
[1:28:51] you will embrace the message of the hour
[1:28:56] because the message is what opened our
[1:28:59] eyes to the grace of God that we are
[1:29:03] talking about it right now
[1:29:07] praised be the name of our God he says
[1:29:11] now that was the law I'm sorry the law
[1:29:15] of death was the commandment given on
[1:29:18] Mount Sinai we told my dad he was a
[1:29:21] sinner and to transgress God's law he
[1:29:25] died but there is no salvation in the
[1:29:28] law it was only a policeman that will
[1:29:31] put you in jail it had nothing to bring
[1:29:35] you out with but then he get another law
[1:29:38] that was at Mount Calvary and I say amen
[1:29:42] to that
[1:29:43] well sin was recording Jesus Christ and
[1:29:47] then the penalty was paid and not with
[1:29:52] without law
[1:29:54] but by grace you are saved by the grace
[1:29:58] of God through predestination of God's
[1:30:02] foreknowledge of your being so sometimes
[1:30:09] when when I hear I was discussing with
[1:30:11] both Summerall this morning but a very
[1:30:13] good brother
[1:30:14] oh very good but I've met him before and
[1:30:19] he claimed he believed the message of
[1:30:21] this hour
[1:30:22] why doesn't believe that God seeded you
[1:30:25] before the foundation of the world that
[1:30:28] is his problem but if you were not
[1:30:31] seated before the foundation of the
[1:30:34] world when when did that take place in
[1:30:39] our lives
[1:30:40] wait hallelujah the Bible says in
[1:30:46] Timothy he says what is he for the
[1:30:53] foundation of the lost and she and why
[1:30:56] something is says something me sure it
[1:30:58] means that M is fixed that nothing can
[1:31:01] shake it he said the foundation of the
[1:31:04] Wednesday a shield okay how did this in
[1:31:10] you they'll not knows those who is not
[1:31:16] that their Lord is not going to know
[1:31:20] those who were his is it they're not not
[1:31:24] those who were hates who is seated
[1:31:28] before the foundation of the world to be
[1:31:31] in this time sometimes I can go that he
[1:31:36] didn't place me in a time of Martin
[1:31:37] Luther I tell God that I didn't place me
[1:31:41] in the time of Paul you must also can go
[1:31:45] the same way because God knew why he
[1:31:48] placed you in this time
[1:31:51] because you are the people that can
[1:31:54] handle the grace of God their way is
[1:31:56] supposed to be handled
[1:31:58] so God needed you in this very time amen
[1:32:04] and amen hallelujah
[1:32:08] oh my collisions
[1:32:20] I'm reading it again condition three
[1:32:30] then say for as many as are of the works
[1:32:32] of the law are another cache for it is
[1:32:36] written cursed is everyone that
[1:32:37] continued not in the office which are
[1:32:40] written in the book of the law to do
[1:32:41] them but that no man is justified by the
[1:32:44] law listening carefully in the sight of
[1:32:47] God not in a set of men but in the sight
[1:32:50] of God it is evident for the just shall
[1:32:54] live by faith
[1:32:56] so Martin Luther said that I Josh I live
[1:32:59] by faith they just cannot lead by paying
[1:33:02] for his or her sins and the law is not
[1:33:08] of faith but the man that doeth them
[1:33:11] shall live in them
[1:33:14] Christ how do we deem us from the curse
[1:33:18] of the law will you say in a year Christ
[1:33:23] as we deem us from the curse of the law
[1:33:25] being made a curse for us for it is
[1:33:29] written cursed is everyone that hung it
[1:33:32] on the tree that the blessings of
[1:33:35] Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[1:33:37] through Jesus Christ that we might
[1:33:40] receive the promise of the Spirit
[1:33:42] through faith hallelujah amen amen
[1:33:50] so Jesus Christ has to go to Calvary to
[1:33:56] demonstrate his power over since when
[1:34:03] our behalf oh brother you remember it
[1:34:08] product easy for him to go to the cross
[1:34:10] new dramatic turn came the Bible say
[1:34:13] that he went to the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:34:17] hallelujah as we demonstrated last
[1:34:19] Thursday here he was in Akron he was in
[1:34:22] a trouble because it was time for him to
[1:34:27] change the law into grace he prayed and
[1:34:34] prayed and prayed because he had no
[1:34:35] option
[1:34:37] he prayed and prayed and prayed for you
[1:34:41] and I he said Lord father if it be
[1:34:49] possible let this cup pass over me but
[1:34:55] not my will but dying hallelujah
[1:35:01] and so he said lastly say it is finished
[1:35:07] the salvation plan forgiveness of our
[1:35:11] sins brutal the spirit of life in Christ
[1:35:15] Jesus was made finished and he giveth
[1:35:21] none power for us to be called the sons
[1:35:26] and daughters of God not what we have
[1:35:30] done but what he has done
[1:35:37] praised be the name of our God
[1:35:40] hallelujah amen and even so the Bible
[1:35:47] says in Hebrews he says today after so
[1:35:50] long a time as Curtis said if you hear
[1:35:55] his voice harden not your heart that
[1:36:01] Jesus had given them arrest will he not
[1:36:04] afterward have spoken of another day
[1:36:08] what is the rest what was the rest the
[1:36:12] summit what was it the purpose that it
[1:36:14] just means to rest and the Holy Ghost
[1:36:17] today in your life is what gives you
[1:36:19] that rest
[1:36:21] oh brother we are wrestling today we are
[1:36:25] resting today in the grace of God not
[1:36:29] what we have done we have nothing to do
[1:36:31] with it we didn't pay for anything we
[1:36:34] didn't do anything about it it is his
[1:36:38] own wheel we are resting today we are
[1:36:42] resting today in the person of Christ
[1:36:47] amen and he says the dispensation
[1:36:51] changed with Jesus Christ from the Lord
[1:36:54] grace from wedge or to Grace from
[1:36:58] something you do to watch something
[1:37:02] God did hallelujah upon your honor it no
[1:37:07] upon his merit it changed amen
[1:37:13] you remember do I still have time
[1:37:18] rosamma remember one day the Bible says
[1:37:22] that Jesus Christ was in the temple and
[1:37:27] lo and behold that were our seats there
[1:37:33] always to the youngest they held this
[1:37:38] woman proper proper and brought her
[1:37:44] before Jesus Christ and they asked Jesus
[1:37:48] master this woman has been caught in
[1:37:53] adultery in fact in a very act and
[1:37:59] according to the law of Moses such a
[1:38:02] woman should be stoned to death but what
[1:38:06] do you say why did he go and as Jesus
[1:38:11] cried out question you know they
[1:38:15] themself near questions we are always
[1:38:17] condemning them why should I boil Jesus
[1:38:21] you have the law why don't you implement
[1:38:24] it because they have seen that Christ
[1:38:27] has brought something new that they
[1:38:30] didn't have the man didn't have what it
[1:38:32] takes
[1:38:33] to grab it so they were always confused
[1:38:38] hallelujah
[1:38:40] that is why we know they had a law the
[1:38:42] law tells them there's no God human but
[1:38:44] then they say no let us go a ciggies as
[1:38:46] Christ face meanwhile the according
[1:38:49] visible so now the clergy the holy men
[1:38:57] they were going to ask them eligible to
[1:39:02] tell them what they should do about the
[1:39:04] law can we imagine this so they went and
[1:39:10] told the desert this man was caught in
[1:39:13] adultery
[1:39:14] she wished one head to death then the
[1:39:18] Bible says that Jesus Christ took on the
[1:39:23] floor and he started writing something
[1:39:26] that nobody knew up to today perhaps he
[1:39:31] was writing I am the one who gave the
[1:39:35] law to Moses and I say such a woman
[1:39:39] should be stoned to death now you are
[1:39:45] asking me what should be done to this
[1:39:47] woman I am the same one who made Moses
[1:39:52] on the mountain I have come here with a
[1:39:57] new thing to change the old one after
[1:40:04] you wrote that on the floor he
[1:40:06] straightened himself up now we look at
[1:40:08] them
[1:40:08] he said anyone among you who have not
[1:40:14] seen she first cast the stone and he
[1:40:22] continued and now I am going to crucify
[1:40:27] the law on the cross
[1:40:31] and I will introduce grace of God to
[1:40:38] bring righteousness to my people
[1:40:43] [Applause]
[1:40:46] so before Christ finish writing distant
[1:40:49] on the floor and he straightened himself
[1:40:52] up
[1:40:53] no Pharisee was they again and by the
[1:40:58] Bible say that they started moving one
[1:41:01] by one starting from the old man hey so
[1:41:09] it means let me know do a condom and
[1:41:12] this woman to die dead himself was not
[1:41:16] righteous they were not Rachel
[1:41:20] so it means that there were so many
[1:41:21] hypocrisy people were healed by people
[1:41:25] who supposed to be killed you understand
[1:41:30] it now so none of them were justified by
[1:41:33] the law even to condemn people by the
[1:41:37] same law the policy is not and it was
[1:41:46] with Jesus and the woman alone and
[1:41:49] Christ asked the woman where are your
[1:41:52] accusers nobody condemned you it's the
[1:41:56] new master it's a while now that grounds
[1:42:00] to condemn you but boo and sin no more
[1:42:06] how alone
[1:42:08] so we are talking about grace great
[1:42:10] doesn't mean that you can continue to
[1:42:11] live in sin no then you don't have
[1:42:14] revelation of what the mean of Grace's
[1:42:19] hallelujah they don't have the wind of
[1:42:22] it so if they are d'autre I'm surprised
[1:42:26] at the current the current who make war
[1:42:28] of the man by the middle of on the on
[1:42:32] the woman only proud the man was faster
[1:42:35] like Hussein good and he ran away you
[1:42:39] understand that is why anything that you
[1:42:42] do to someone
[1:42:43] you must make sure that you are doing
[1:42:46] the right thing but I will you give us
[1:42:51] romance after sex we are reading all of
[1:42:53] us are going to read it before we close
[1:42:55] okay Romans chapter 6 and verse 1
[1:43:12] romanced ripped away Chapter six I'm
[1:43:14] sorry I ready to read with me he's gonna
[1:43:24] board romance after sex
[1:43:29] okay let's go is that what shall we say
[1:43:33] then shall we continue in sin that grace
[1:43:37] may abound verse two says God forbid how
[1:43:43] shall we that are dead to sin little
[1:43:46] longer they read hallelujah
[1:43:52] should we continue in sin that grace may
[1:43:56] abound the bubbles that are good for
[1:43:58] bigges how shall we that are dead to sin
[1:44:01] live any longer the ring we have killed
[1:44:07] see by grace in the flesh but the law
[1:44:13] could not kill sick you see the word
[1:44:16] atenas the grace of God which is the
[1:44:21] spirit of life in Christ Jesus has been
[1:44:24] able to kill sin in the flesh what the
[1:44:31] law could not give grace has done it so
[1:44:35] Paul say that God forbid that he doesn't
[1:44:38] mean that you are a message believer you
[1:44:41] believe the message so that is all oh
[1:44:42] you feel the Holy Ghost so that you can
[1:44:44] do whatever no it is never like that we
[1:44:51] bring righteousness out of grace we are
[1:44:56] here as representations of God
[1:45:01] hallelujah we have another influence
[1:45:05] that cannot cope with the system of this
[1:45:09] present time the environment that we are
[1:45:13] living in now that is why it were our
[1:45:16] desire that we should be accepted in the
[1:45:20] society
[1:45:22] your faith that you hope now can make
[1:45:26] you you know have a whole lot of enemies
[1:45:29] around you because anything that I do
[1:45:34] you contaminate and not you condiment
[1:45:37] but that the Spirit of Christ that is in
[1:45:39] you anything contrary to the Word of God
[1:45:44] is condemnable we don't condemn the
[1:45:48] people because the illiberal sin but we
[1:45:52] condemned sin in the people so the
[1:45:57] proper to tell you somewhere we say we
[1:45:58] don't hate the sinner but we love the
[1:46:00] cinema we hate the same we are here to
[1:46:04] establish the kingdom of God and that is
[1:46:07] what we are doing we are not doing it by
[1:46:10] by our strength but just the grace of
[1:46:13] God we are doing all this thing by His
[1:46:19] grace amen one time somebody was asking
[1:46:28] me a question me God there was a brother
[1:46:32] in the church who was misbehaving and I
[1:46:36] was after so many advice he was not you
[1:46:39] know listened to the advice so what
[1:46:43] happened was that we have to apply the
[1:46:44] word and as come kick him from the
[1:46:46] church and he was confused and so how
[1:46:51] can we do that so well as the is the
[1:46:55] word we didn't do it is what is written
[1:46:58] in a word thanks a lot but the Prophet
[1:47:05] didn't has communicated anybody from the
[1:47:06] his church and I asked him were you
[1:47:09] dealt with it
[1:47:09] you had a prophet in his church were you
[1:47:13] dealt with him if nobody is misbehaving
[1:47:18] there is no need of excommunicating
[1:47:20] anybody but if somebody's misbehaving
[1:47:24] then we can do that because great
[1:47:28] doesn't mean that we can leave anyhow
[1:47:32] Grace has brought this LC into our body
[1:47:37] Grace has got righteousness into our
[1:47:40] body
[1:47:42] hallelujah Grace has brought holy life
[1:47:45] into our body and that is what we knew
[1:47:49] and that's always freedom brother sister
[1:47:53] before I close do not be discouraged do
[1:47:57] not be discouraged at all that you
[1:48:00] believe this message do not be
[1:48:02] discouraged a poll that pay your faith
[1:48:05] you are not gonna be accepted in the
[1:48:07] areas value you found yourself in do not
[1:48:10] be discouraged because very soon we are
[1:48:15] going to tend to be judges upon their
[1:48:18] people on this earth your brother Brahm
[1:48:22] say that when grace is spawned what is
[1:48:25] left is what judgment today let us
[1:48:31] acknowledge that God for that mattias on
[1:48:35] Jesus Christ took us from where we were
[1:48:39] and you put us in his condition and he
[1:48:44] has come into our condition that is what
[1:48:48] we are able to live as Christians amen
[1:48:52] that is why anything that we do today
[1:48:55] brings glory to his holy name the grace
[1:49:00] of God in us is what is reflecting what
[1:49:03] is in heaven that is why your life my
[1:49:07] sister is different from the woman on
[1:49:09] the street that is why the man living a
[1:49:13] decent life because grace has done it
[1:49:17] for us
[1:49:21] grace has given enough power if a dress
[1:49:25] has refined us and today we can be bold
[1:49:31] and happy to look up to the skies and
[1:49:37] say Lord come now we can look to the
[1:49:44] skies and see that the halls of heaven
[1:49:50] they are all ready to accept us now to
[1:49:54] receive us because what we are doing
[1:49:58] today is what is influencing them also
[1:50:03] over there your life and my life we are
[1:50:08] looking on us hallelujah
[1:50:12] they are looking on the way the behavior
[1:50:14] we are putting up on this we are looking
[1:50:19] down and they are watching us because if
[1:50:22] we fail the Apostle feel so the Bible
[1:50:27] say that the prophets of old the
[1:50:32] apostles and all the saints they are
[1:50:38] looking on you
[1:50:41] are we going to fill them I say no no
[1:50:48] matter how difficult it will be on the
[1:50:49] way no matter how frustrated if they
[1:50:54] will be no matter what hardship perhaps
[1:51:02] who rise on the way let us live on Jesus
[1:51:06] Christ for he is our warfare general he
[1:51:13] said it has finished and I'm not sure
[1:51:16] that that word us judgment manifest in
[1:51:19] my life you must make sure that it
[1:51:23] manifests in your life soon and very
[1:51:27] soon we are going to go away that is
[1:51:31] what I am thinking about now because
[1:51:33] everything shows that there's no time
[1:51:36] left everything shows like we said last
[1:51:41] Thursday he shall have travail and and
[1:51:47] the child is born to them we must also
[1:51:52] travail because as they are preparing to
[1:51:58] receive the Messiah the Messiah whose
[1:52:01] Jesus Christ must hide his wife also in
[1:52:04] the place even that is there today there
[1:52:13] are a lot of people don't know what time
[1:52:16] is it but a prophet will ask you says
[1:52:20] what time is it today I will tell you
[1:52:25] that it is the time of changing of the
[1:52:28] body of the believers and we are in a
[1:52:33] process of the body change oh brother
[1:52:37] sister I would like you to say Amen here
[1:52:40] we are in a process of the body change
[1:52:45] anything that will make the body change
[1:52:48] is here
[1:52:50] I say it's here hallelujah
[1:52:54] as we park today as we park tomorrow one
[1:52:57] day of these days it will be over and as
[1:53:03] I always say when we change
[1:53:06] let me see you die glove change because
[1:53:10] I will make sure that you see that I've
[1:53:12] change and I wouldn't need to go and buy
[1:53:17] delta tickets to fly and come and see
[1:53:22] where a summer and a check we will not
[1:53:25] need to go and buy perhaps of American
[1:53:28] Airlines but as you sit here in Loreen I
[1:53:33] will be in Ghana and I will see
[1:53:36] everything that is going on and you do
[1:53:39] the same brother and sister there is no
[1:53:46] joy that can surpass that condition
[1:53:51] there is no liberty that also pass that
[1:53:56] thatís why to pay our age you let us
[1:53:59] press on
[1:54:01] I said let us press on to the price of
[1:54:05] the high collars of God do not be
[1:54:07] frustrated do not be discouraged by
[1:54:10] enemies in this world for the society
[1:54:13] will not welcome us but we are here to
[1:54:16] establish the kingdom of God and that is
[1:54:18] what we are doing now god bless all of
[1:54:21] you
[1:54:22] god sentinel of you god for all of you
[1:54:25] with his power and glory
[1:54:28] anything that will be a hindrance on
[1:54:31] your way the lost click on 1208 and i
[1:54:35] think i will be disappointed to the
[1:54:36] appointment in your way
[1:54:37] the law should take care of it and
[1:54:39] attain that to suggest you to be worried
[1:54:42] to be touchy to be lukewarm to be lazy
[1:54:45] then law should take it away from your
[1:54:47] life then I will fill you with all the
[1:54:50] glories of heaven shallow
[1:54:52] [Applause]
[1:55:17] sit amen God is so good kidney you know
[1:55:28] brother branham he makes a statement in
[1:55:32] the message of grace and he says you
[1:55:35] know there's two things he said that I'm
[1:55:37] gotten after that people disagree with
[1:55:40] me so much on and he said first of all
[1:55:43] he said it's on the doctrine of
[1:55:46] predestination and he said the second
[1:55:48] thing that they don't like is the
[1:55:51] message of grace that I'm minister see
[1:55:55] those two things go hand in hand and I
[1:55:58] realize that within this hour what God
[1:56:01] has restored back to us that election
[1:56:04] was not something that was new this
[1:56:07] message did not bring new things to us
[1:56:11] it uncovered what was already laying
[1:56:16] here we're restored back to the original
[1:56:20] faith and with that the those things
[1:56:26] that God seen that in here that were
[1:56:30] hidden and reserved as nuggets for this
[1:56:33] hour such as to be able to look at
[1:56:36] Abraham and Sarah and to see that change
[1:56:39] it is not wrote in the scripture by
[1:56:41] words but yet it is written there in
[1:56:45] their lives and those are nuggets that
[1:56:48] even God would bring out in this hour
[1:56:51] thinking of Rebecca and Esther and all
[1:56:54] of those things they were only making
[1:56:56] known of what types you know there were
[1:57:00] shadows in order to have a shadow there
[1:57:02] must be substance that made a shadow and
[1:57:06] to this morning I'm looking at the
[1:57:09] substance I am of that substance
[1:57:13] David was a type in part of his life of
[1:57:16] Christ not everything David did was
[1:57:19] Christ but that tight in only spoke of
[1:57:22] the true substance that would come and
[1:57:25] then to see in this hour all
[1:57:28] the shadows in order to be a shadow
[1:57:30] there must be a substance to make a
[1:57:32] shadow and so seeing that how that
[1:57:35] Christ would come preeminent in his
[1:57:38] bride body it is the substance of all
[1:57:42] the shadows its Christ in bright form
[1:57:47] that same Lord Jesus
[1:57:50] now manifests within our life then
[1:57:53] they're wonderful you know friends the
[1:57:55] Bible says very clearly it says david
[1:57:58] says all let us worship him in the
[1:58:01] beauty of holiness and that holiness is
[1:58:05] not our our works is not our
[1:58:09] righteousness
[1:58:10] it is his holiness the very opening of
[1:58:14] the book of Romans says that he raised
[1:58:16] him from the grave by the spirit of
[1:58:19] holiness see he fulfilled the law you
[1:58:24] with me he fulfilled that because it's
[1:58:27] his life within you and I how could you
[1:58:31] stand when the Bible says that the Holy
[1:58:33] Ghost
[1:58:33] he will bring conviction to our lives is
[1:58:36] that right he brings conviction from the
[1:58:39] inside so then how how could it be that
[1:58:43] you could say Father forgive me I didn't
[1:58:46] mean to say that I didn't mean to
[1:58:48] entertain that I did how could that be
[1:58:50] because there's been a desire that's
[1:58:52] been raised up by the Spirit of Christ
[1:58:55] on the inside God sees the desire is
[1:59:02] that right that is the real spirit and
[1:59:06] beauty of holiness because my if we're
[1:59:09] standing here this morning on our own
[1:59:11] merits we're in trouble
[1:59:13] we are in big trouble because the
[1:59:16] rapture itself will not be by merits the
[1:59:21] rapture is simply by walking in
[1:59:24] obedience to the grace that he has
[1:59:27] unfolded and when that moment comes he
[1:59:31] just as he did for Abraham he will move
[1:59:35] on the scene enrapturing grace
[1:59:39] it's all him you know the Bible says
[1:59:44] like this look in the scripture I just
[1:59:46] just want to drop these few things John
[1:59:48] sometimes you know brother Stephen of
[1:59:51] Bali and I we were fellowshipping about
[1:59:52] some of these things because sometimes
[1:59:54] the things that are spoken and expressed
[1:59:56] sometimes they can bring if those words
[1:59:58] aren't broke down they can bring trouble
[2:00:00] and when you look at things we speak of
[2:00:03] the three stages of grace and I think I
[2:00:06] may have mentioned this on Sunday we
[2:00:08] look at things sometimes and we look at
[2:00:10] it in terms of steps as though it's
[2:00:13] steps were making it's not steps were
[2:00:15] making it's the work that he starts in
[2:00:19] us and he deepens in our life so it's
[2:00:23] not me coming from this point but
[2:00:27] remember that inner veil is Christ
[2:00:30] coming upon the throne of our heart so
[2:00:35] it's not us moving it's us yielding and
[2:00:39] he moves deeper so when the scripture
[2:00:43] says let us labor to enter into his rest
[2:00:45] it's not my I gotta get distant I gotta
[2:00:49] get this and I gotta go no no it wasn't
[2:00:53] that even when you look in the condition
[2:00:55] of Buddy Robinson in the field it wasn't
[2:00:57] because he got down on his knees and I'm
[2:00:59] gonna get this I'm gonna do this and I
[2:01:01] it wasn't that it was this here when
[2:01:03] that came to that place God moved into
[2:01:06] depth its surrendering so the whole
[2:01:09] labor you know the whole labor it's us
[2:01:11] it's our will it's our will but no no
[2:01:18] wonder Paul could say you bleep all the
[2:01:20] spirit-filled no wonder Paul could say
[2:01:23] oh I protest by your rejoicing that I
[2:01:28] die daily
[2:01:32] in Christ isn't that wonderful
[2:01:36] God's grace to you and I that real
[2:01:40] righteousness on the inside where it's
[2:01:42] not our efforts
[2:01:44] it's our yielding you see your efforts
[2:01:48] it will condemn you but why are you
[2:01:51] looking to what he has already done as I
[2:01:54] think that was a tremendous statement
[2:01:56] that was made grace is to acknowledge
[2:02:00] what you cannot do but that he has
[2:02:03] already done that is powerful the grace
[2:02:09] of Almighty God oh my and one of these
[2:02:12] moments as brother Daniel said we are
[2:02:15] going to be changed by the grace of God
[2:02:18] I ask you who put the RAM on the
[2:02:21] mountain did Abraham put him there did
[2:02:26] Abraham didn't put him there no el
[2:02:30] Abraham did was walk in obedience to
[2:02:33] what God had made no and when Abraham
[2:02:38] come even into that place where he was
[2:02:40] ready to take his own son's life
[2:02:43] according to what God had asked his hand
[2:02:46] was in the air
[2:02:48] brother Bram says the buzzers inside
[2:02:52] were going off what are you gonna tell
[2:02:54] Sarah when you get back home what are
[2:02:56] you gonna do what brother Brown says but
[2:02:59] Abraham stood in obedience to what God
[2:03:03] had asked for and the angel of the Lord
[2:03:07] stayed his hand and then about that time
[2:03:10] you're the bush hear hear the sound
[2:03:13] here's the ram the ram has come on the
[2:03:17] scene that's the rapture the RAM coming
[2:03:20] on the scene walking in obedience to the
[2:03:23] word I believe I'm looking in the
[2:03:26] generation of the RAM amen
[2:03:30] Abraham was an old man the rapture is
[2:03:36] for all of God's children
[2:03:39] [Music]
[2:03:39] [Applause]
[2:03:44] grace grace grace unto it aren't you
[2:03:51] grateful to God my my my my my my how I
[2:03:55] think God lets tend oh my we have so
[2:04:01] much to be thankful for so much I know
[2:04:05] you were blessed amen
[2:04:09] we have certainly been blessed and we
[2:04:12] still think God that God allowed brother
[2:04:14] Daniel to be able to come by our way
[2:04:17] amen we want to pray for our brother
[2:04:19] pray for his church his family that God
[2:04:21] will just continue to to strengthen him
[2:04:24] I also want to make mention to you but
[2:04:27] the cadre digs will be here with us this
[2:04:28] coming Thursday and let's continue to
[2:04:32] remember the Cruz family in prayer they
[2:04:38] just we want to hold them up in prayer
[2:04:40] that God will just strengthen them
[2:04:42] during this time and then when
[2:04:44] everything is made known on behalf of
[2:04:47] the funeral and all those arrangements
[2:04:50] we will get that out to you as soon as
[2:04:52] that becomes available to us and my I'm
[2:04:57] just so thankful for the grace of God
[2:04:59] aren't you you know there couldn't have
[2:05:01] been a New Testament if there wasn't a
[2:05:04] fulfillment of the old now how could we
[2:05:07] fulfill that how could anybody fulfill
[2:05:09] the old you know brother mem says God
[2:05:10] makes a requirement and God makes the
[2:05:13] requirement where there's nobody else
[2:05:14] can do it but him and then he steps on
[2:05:19] the scene
[2:05:20] oh how wonderful he is amen let's just
[2:05:26] bow our heads in a word of Prayer

[2:07:09] nature on the inside and release the
[2:07:12] very holiness and righteousness of Jesus
[2:07:17] Christ by the grace of God into the
[2:07:19] bosom of our soul
[2:07:21] that by that life that quickening power

[2:07:30] into subjection by that authority of the
