[34:35] brother George and prayers he's gonna be
[34:37] traveling back flies out of Detroit
[34:40] tonight five thankfully everything
[34:43] worked out for morning just seeing how
[34:55] the weather was going so some of you
[34:58] that's traveled up there on that I had
[35:00] her state 94 that's I don't need to sing
[35:04] no more if you've ever been on the

[35:07] something else so we just want to just
[35:09] remember brother George and prayer
[35:10] certainly was a real blessing just a
[35:14] real real encouragement to our hearts we
[35:17] just thank God you know I know it's a
[35:20] little different on the nights that we
[35:22] had the meetings but you know sometimes
[35:23] I think we get too comfortable where
[35:25] things have to be convenient because I'm
[35:28] you let your thought we'll both of em
[35:30] tells us this right here brother Graham
[35:32] says you take for example a family
[35:34] that'll drive through a snowstorm I'm
[35:36] not advising that I'm gonna have that's
[35:38] church in a snowstorm but brother Graham
[35:39] just making a point here
[35:41] he says you take for example a family
[35:43] that'll do that he said you watch god
[35:45] bless him for their sacrifice there's
[35:48] when it sacrifices made by the remm
[35:50] talked about in the message desperations
[35:52] he talked about how all those were lined
[35:54] up down in Arkansas and he talked about
[35:57] how each one of them were getting their
[35:58] needs met and he said you know why it
[36:00] was is because there was a sacrifice he
[36:03] said for anyone he said that's born with
[36:05] a silver spoon he's the expression
[36:06] silver spoon in their mouth they don't
[36:08] appreciate it very much I say Lord don't
[36:11] ever let us
[36:12] failed to appreciate his goodness and
[36:16] the opportunity just leave just what we
[36:20] what is given to us here this
[36:22] something's here a little bit too loud
[36:30] the also would I want to ask you we
[36:35] could just for the sake of things that
[36:43] Sunday and Thursday morning so let's
[37:33] just go right to the word
[37:37] I'm gonna read a portion of the word
[37:39] then I'm gonna let you be seated second
[37:43] Corinthians chapter 3 verse 1 we'll read
[37:47] down a few verses of Scripture y'all
[37:56] aren't tired are you Lord had to service
[37:59] this week I mean we can plug it into 3rd
[38:06] certainly 2nd Corinthians chapter 3
[38:09] verse 1 do we begin again to commend
[38:15] ourselves or neatly as some others
[38:18] epistles of commendation to you or
[38:21] letters of commendation from you now
[38:24] Paul speaking of many of you baubles
[38:28] readers you would know that you know
[38:29] this in the book of Acts even when
[38:31] someone was sent out from you'll find
[38:34] Paul doing of this where they would send
[38:36] out maybe an evangelist or whomever and
[38:38] they would write letters of commendation
[38:40] regarding this individual and so this
[38:43] individual then would be received
[38:45] because of the character that has been
[38:48] expressed in regards to say receive this
[38:51] man it'd be good for you received him
[38:53] he'll be a blessing to you so Paul is
[38:56] letting to be known that you know we we
[38:59] were not in need he was just so loud up
[39:03] here before i don't know what it was
[39:05] it's better now thank you paul was
[39:09] expressing that that God has so
[39:11] evidently confirmed that and vindicated
[39:14] that that there's not a need for another
[39:17] epistle of commendation
[39:19] God's already vindicated himself so in
[39:24] verse 2 ye are our epistle written in
[39:28] our hearts known and read of all men for
[39:33] as much as ye are manifestly declared to
[39:36] be the Epistle of Christ ministered by
[39:39] US written not with ink but with the
[39:43] spirit of the Living God not in tables
[39:45] of stone but in fleshy tables
[39:48] heart and such trust we have through
[39:52] Christ to godly not that we are
[39:55] sufficient of ourselves to think
[39:56] anything as of ourselves but our
[39:59] sufficiency is of God who also hath made
[40:03] us able ministers of the New Testament
[40:07] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[40:11] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[40:13] life but if administration of death
[40:16] written and engraven in stones was
[40:19] glorious so that the children of Israel
[40:22] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[40:24] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[40:26] which glory was to be done away how
[40:30] shall not the ministration of a spirit
[40:32] be rather glorious for if the
[40:35] ministration of condemnation be glory
[40:37] much more the administration of
[40:40] righteousness exceed in glory even that
[40:43] which was made glorious had no glory in
[40:46] this respect by reason of the glory that
[40:49] xcellent where if that which is done
[40:52] away was glorious much more that which
[40:54] remaineth
[40:57] may God bless you to being seated we
[41:00] want to continue look at that thought
[41:01] with the heart of God Paul is here in
[41:08] the opening part of the chapter Paul's
[41:12] placing the same parallel you remember
[41:16] when God had brought Israel out into
[41:21] thee in the wilderness and here God was
[41:24] bringing them out of Egypt with the
[41:27] objective not to bring them into the
[41:30] wilderness but the objective was to
[41:32] bring him into the land so we understand
[41:36] that in the midst of the deliverance
[41:39] from Egypt and coming into the land
[41:41] which is which is the fulfillment of the
[41:43] promise that in the meantime riding
[41:46] through here there was there was a
[41:50] weeding out there were there was a
[41:52] remove
[41:53] and a dissolved and God allowed all of
[41:56] that time we we understand that Israel
[41:59] made a choice during that time and then
[42:02] God allowed them to wonder around and
[42:06] around for 40 years until as the Bible
[42:09] would say that generation that was there
[42:11] was was consumed and so there was gonna
[42:16] raise up God's desire where there was
[42:18] gonna be people who were going to move
[42:21] fully into the promise they're not going
[42:23] to be just glad that they got out of
[42:26] Egypt and there in the wilderness
[42:27] because the wilderness is not the that's
[42:30] not the achievement the wilderness is a
[42:32] process but the achievement is full
[42:35] reconciliation and that's the that's the
[42:38] whole part of the gospel of every time
[42:40] that the word is ministered through
[42:42] every age and in every part is there is
[42:44] a promise that is given and when that
[42:47] promise is given God comes on the scene
[42:49] to manifest that promise and the
[42:51] manifestation of that promise is to stir
[42:54] the hearts of the people in faith in God
[42:57] who made the promise that he will
[43:00] fulfill that promise
[43:02] sometimes you know it's very easy to get
[43:05] caught up in the things aware of what
[43:07] God has done and you can recognize what
[43:09] God has done but for it and remembering
[43:11] why God came down and he visited them
[43:14] within Egypt and all the signs and all
[43:16] the wonders the Bible says I believe it
[43:19] Psalm 78 that where David speaks by
[43:22] inspiration he said that of all those
[43:24] things that were done he said that the
[43:26] people didn't understand it it wasn't
[43:30] that they didn't see it but they didn't
[43:31] understand what it was all about that
[43:34] right there was manifest that they would
[43:37] have a confidence in the Living God they
[43:39] would know that not only not not just
[43:42] knowing a letter but they would know the
[43:44] Living God and their confidence would be
[43:47] in God that God Himself will fulfill
[43:50] this word it isn't that you and I
[43:53] haven't figured out we don't have it
[43:55] figured out but that's where we have a
[43:56] rest because we know that God Himself
[43:59] makes known his word to us by by his
[44:02] great sovereignty and then through all
[44:04] of that through
[44:05] the Junction's and the moments and all
[44:07] these things it's God himself in
[44:09] sovereignty preparing us making himself
[44:12] known to us it's him
[44:14] taking care of his word and that's why
[44:18] it's so important that we be identified
[44:20] with his word because we're identified
[44:22] with his word God always keeps his word
[44:24] and so we find this this parallel that
[44:27] Paul is speaking of of how that when
[44:29] when Moses they come out here in the
[44:32] wilderness and Moses receives and you
[44:34] know the commandments of the Lord here
[44:36] he is up in the presence of God and God
[44:39] instructs him there in the vision that
[44:41] the promises that's been received are
[44:44] the commandments that these these
[44:46] Commandments are to be put into that of
[44:49] an ark and there would be that'll be the
[44:51] Ark of testimony it would be called the
[44:53] tabernacle of testimony because you see
[44:56] God never intended that the commandments
[44:58] themselves would just be you know just
[45:00] stones and just in other words just to
[45:02] have that kind of a meaning that it's
[45:04] not a real meaning but God wanted it to
[45:07] be a testimony that it would be a
[45:09] witness and that's the same thing God
[45:11] desires in every one of our life is that
[45:14] our lives is not just something of stone
[45:16] where all of a sudden we've become
[45:18] impressed upon or engraved upon but
[45:21] there's a real living pulsation in our
[45:23] lives and it's a it's a real living
[45:26] testimony because a testimony is nothing
[45:29] that somebody can teach us if testimony
[45:32] is nothing that a mom dad prophet nobody
[45:34] can give us that it has to be God
[45:37] himself come on the scene and it must be
[45:39] us to where we can say Lord I believe
[45:41] not about I can't explain it but Lord I
[45:44] believe but it's recognizing him that's
[45:46] what's important friends it's not that
[45:48] we understand everything it's
[45:50] recognizing him because if we can
[45:52] recognize him and yield to him then he
[45:55] can't give to us the understanding that
[45:58] we need when we need it and that's the
[46:01] confidence that we have in him and as we
[46:03] see that within it Moses here he placed
[46:06] that test
[46:07] only within within the arc and that arc
[46:09] it was in a it was in a place that
[46:11] nobody had access to that place but the
[46:14] high priest once a year it was a place
[46:16] that God had told Moses that right
[46:18] across this mercy speed see I will speak
[46:21] to you I will commune with you live to
[46:24] hear it was a place that it would be
[46:26] where the word itself would find rest it
[46:29] was a place where Communion and
[46:31] fellowship would be it was a place of
[46:33] atonement it was a place of
[46:35] reconciliation in that same time as Paul
[46:38] was saying here that the word itself is
[46:41] intended to be placed and find its rest
[46:44] in the heart of the belief that is God's
[46:47] desire when God as he revealed himself
[46:50] to Paul the objective the desire as Paul
[46:53] could say ye are our epistle written in
[46:56] our hearts because Paul he himself as he
[46:59] said in our hearts Paul and those that
[47:01] ministry that had come under that light
[47:03] there were ministering in continuity and
[47:06] unity of the promise of the faith of the
[47:09] Living God and that going forward it was
[47:11] not the image of Paul that was getting
[47:14] placed in people's hearts or or any of
[47:16] the other men Timothy and Philemon allof
[47:18] it was not their image but it was the
[47:20] image of Jesus Christ as a matter of
[47:22] fact Paul you know was in such a place
[47:24] to where he said I was in fear and
[47:27] trembling lest your faith would be
[47:29] placed in the enticing words of man's
[47:32] wisdom you know what Paul knew that he'd
[47:34] pulled knew his strengths while knew a
[47:36] lot of languages pulling through a lot
[47:37] of words but Paul also realized that if
[47:40] I come in that manner and I rest upon
[47:42] that people's faith will be in words
[47:44] like that and that won't do no good but
[47:47] their faith has got to be in the power
[47:49] of Almighty God and nothing wrong with
[47:51] words but there's got to be the power of
[47:53] God come behind it and back it up
[47:55] because after we leave this service when
[47:57] we go out of here you may not remember
[47:59] every single word been Martha's clock
[48:01] we're after and after God help me see
[48:04] the help me to see
[48:05] in my life what is the most important
[48:07] thing is that the power of God the
[48:09] presence of God has come down through
[48:11] that word vindicated that word confirmed
[48:14] that word and then we give ourselves to
[48:16] that word and as will to give ourselves
[48:18] to that word we are changed we are
[48:20] transformed and that word that was
[48:23] spoken now becomes reflected in our life
[48:26] it's an igniting to bring forward what
[48:29] is already linguist in you you
[48:32] understand the preaching of the word is
[48:33] not imparting something to you but it is
[48:36] calling forth out of you as a seed of
[48:38] God what is already there hallelujah
[48:42] it's amazed you and have recognizing
[48:45] more and more of who we are so this is
[48:47] God's desire that the word would find a
[48:51] resting place in our life and I tell you
[48:53] we could go through here and testimony
[48:55] and witness when the spare in the Word
[48:57] of God finds his place down into the
[49:00] depths of the heart of the believer in
[49:02] their change their transform and tell
[49:04] you what a life to become a new creation
[49:06] the life itself becomes like that where
[49:09] the house of obed-edom were the ark
[49:12] itself came there and was placed in his
[49:14] house and all of his house was blessed
[49:16] because the ark was there when the word
[49:18] is pressing in our life depressions of
[49:20] the Living God is there our lives oh my
[49:23] you might be going through all sorts of
[49:25] things this morning but if the word has
[49:28] found its mark in your life its resting
[49:30] there in your soul there might be all
[49:32] sorts of things your mind and your
[49:34] spirit you might be traveled here and
[49:36] there but there's a rest down deep in
[49:38] yourself you've got a greater one on the
[49:40] inside
[49:41] better move as we say Lord move upon
[49:44] this troubled waters Lord move upon my
[49:46] life Lord God we have that confidence in
[49:50] him Amen this is a living dog in a
[49:53] living word in the message leadership I
[49:59] want to read this this is a little bit
[50:01] of a limp T quote but I want to read it
[50:03] here because things within it I want us
[50:06] to to catch but the randoms in prayer
[50:09] and he says dear God as we stand here
[50:12] tonight a dying people our faces are
[50:16] turned towards the earth it does you
[50:19] give us this cutting sermon Lord we see
[50:22] the example of two men one of them was a
[50:25] religious man went to church but
[50:28] rejected the leadership to eternal life
[50:31] and the other rejected the worldly fame
[50:37] and turned to eternal life if we just
[50:43] stuff right here
[50:43] when we look at it who when we can see
[50:46] just where they're standing who is
[50:49] closer not the one in worldly fame the
[50:54] one who's living a religious life is
[50:57] closer but because he turns down the
[51:04] leadership you see it wasn't necessary
[51:08] that he ruin was we could say well he
[51:10] just flat-out rejected it or not he did
[51:12] because he rejected leadership
[51:15] leadership is very very important
[51:18] leadership always shows itself always
[51:23] shows this but here is fine he says
[51:25] there's one that rejected worldly fame
[51:28] and turn to eternal life and we see both
[51:32] of their conditions tonight according to
[51:34] the Bible the rich man is in torment and
[51:37] Moses is in glory father we want to be
[51:41] like Moses we want to be led by your
[51:44] holy Son Jesus Christ to eternal life
[51:47] give it to our hearts tonight Lord tear
[51:50] out the old stony heart place into
[51:54] the new heart the heart of flesh the
[51:57] heart that you can talk to and deal with
[52:00] and we will not be haughty or different
[52:03] so you see even even to come to eternal
[52:07] life you know process can be bypassed it
[52:12] has to come through where God God deals
[52:14] with the heart turning that lard so that
[52:18] the heart itself is actually now as the
[52:21] scripture you know says in the Book of
[52:23] Ezekiel multiple places a new heart and
[52:25] a new spirit will I give you this is not
[52:29] something we give ourselves but even God
[52:31] gives us a new heart and a new spirit
[52:33] because as the Prophet is very clear and
[52:36] saying we couldn't get along with our
[52:38] self or our neighbor so if you can't get
[52:42] along with your neighbors you had even
[52:44] got a new heart in the new spirit yet
[52:48] just flat-out save it you know we will
[52:52] not you understand - where where we ask
[52:54] friends where we're not here how much
[52:57] you understand that we're not here to be
[52:59] sugar-coated we want to hear the gospel
[53:01] we want to hear the letter that is here
[53:03] to transform us we're not planning on
[53:06] staying here this is not our home this
[53:09] is not the achievement of this our the
[53:13] achievement of the hour is the rapture
[53:15] the change of the body there's many
[53:19] things that we are longing for and
[53:22] promised even as the president was
[53:25] saying the message Messiah whoa God
[53:26] before all of this comes to an end
[53:29] I trust that you get a hold of a bunch
[53:32] of people Lord by your spirit and they
[53:36] living underneath that word and your
[53:38] presence that they will be clear your
[53:41] word your life in every dimension that
[53:45] is supposed to begin I know I'm gonna
[53:49] say like this I don't believe that
[53:50] that's something in the future I believe
[53:52] that there's people right now
[53:54] I believe I'm one of them but I want you
[53:56] understand this right here hang on I'm
[53:58] not looking at that promise and say well
[54:00] we've arrived know various a greater a
[54:03] greater there is more and more and more
[54:07] of God for our lives
[54:09] the moment we stop asking for more is
[54:12] the moment that says some time ago our
[54:15] hearts already have excellent we need
[54:18] more of him heart of flesh this is what
[54:25] we want a heart of flesh and without me
[54:28] dealing with this a lot there's times
[54:30] where our hearts and hearts need to be
[54:33] dealt with
[54:35] sometimes our hearts can drift on things
[54:37] our hearts can get caught up in
[54:39] complexes and other things I'm not gonna
[54:41] feel this act this morning but then a
[54:43] heart of flesh is one that he can speak
[54:45] to and God's got confidence that he can
[54:48] speak to that heart and lead it in the
[54:50] way that he needs to go
[54:54] may the Holy Spirit never leave Lord may
[54:58] it coming ordain this people speak to
[55:02] them tear up their stony will and put in
[55:06] the will of God save everyone father
[55:09] give us a bad love once you watch this
[55:13] get us to a place Lord that won't get
[55:17] away from all the emotional part to the
[55:20] real solid part of the Phenom the
[55:23] heartfelt part the deepness of the
[55:25] Spirit the riches of God the kingdom of
[55:28] the Spirit in our hearts granite oh
[55:32] great leader great Holy Spirit before
[55:35] you take your flight into the skies with
[55:38] your church just hold it to ever let is
[55:43] a sense that we'll get away from the
[55:45] emotional part now you know for the
[55:48] bread is not calling we don't need in
[55:51] there's no more emotions that's not what
[55:54] he's saying there's some of the
[55:56] statements of things where it's closed
[55:58] it's closed things to be it's gone off
[56:00] into such a place to where they have
[56:02] stale Christians where
[56:04] is the baptism of the holy ghost or that
[56:06] no sensation and those things are quoted
[56:10] without a life to back it up God is not
[56:14] created just statues it's living images
[56:19] it is a reality if we place that work
[56:22] correctly that it is not something and
[56:25] experience with God is not something
[56:28] that's worked up but it is divinely
[56:30] orchestrated by God and the real reality
[56:33] of it is the fruit that follows
[56:35] afterwards because sometimes where the
[56:39] enemy wants to so hammer people on is
[56:41] they want to say I know the date the
[56:43] time to our the disc that this and this
[56:45] and then there's others say well you
[56:46] know I don't know that the day of the
[56:48] our brother Samuel that's not possible
[56:49] 1964 sister bruised brother Brandon I
[56:52] don't have anything I can put my foot on
[56:54] but I've ever had an experience are you
[56:57] with me now and there's multiple places
[56:59] in the message and that but I could even
[57:01] pull out to you of different ones we're
[57:03] going right through but you know what it
[57:04] is
[57:05] where did the Prophet blame them back to
[57:06] he let him see better foot he's not
[57:09] resting upon an experience it rest upon
[57:12] the world it's not to be an experience
[57:15] in the word and experiencing what did he
[57:18] said your life normally and naturally
[57:20] would have been this way he said but
[57:22] what changed your life see she had the
[57:25] question but she already had the answer
[57:27] he had the director and she said what's
[57:30] Christ that changed my life I tell you
[57:33] what you know when you read about of
[57:35] that and I've heard you know I've talked
[57:37] to her brother Jim Humes even when I you
[57:39] know I was ministering in his church and
[57:41] he I referred to that place and and
[57:43] brother Tim got up and told it the
[57:45] church later he said you know that
[57:47] particular interview was not a meeting
[57:48] we're not an interview that was
[57:50] requested by sister Bruce it was an
[57:52] interview brother Brandon requested
[57:54] because sister Bruce was going around to
[57:56] sister Humes and different one saying I
[57:58] wish I had what you had and I wish I had
[58:00] what you have and I wish I had what you
[58:01] had and brother ran our clock window
[58:03] then he called for that interview
[58:07] hello you know what that her feet would
[58:10] be able to be established so she's not
[58:11] gonna be trouble on that what they want
[58:15] was Satan doing what was he doing
[58:17] brother brain went right into it power
[58:18] maker for us and how that this is how
[58:21] you are you get somebody on your heart
[58:23] you can't get them off your heart till
[58:24] you go and pray for it till you do this
[58:26] he said and now Satan takes that on the
[58:28] contrary my goodness so I we must be the
[58:34] ones who's left in the dark on how we're
[58:35] made up God knows how we're made up and
[58:38] Satan watches us as well but thanks be
[58:41] to God if we've been born again from our
[58:42] soul greater is He that's within us Amen
[58:45] we've received a bear I don't overcrowd
[58:47] and be able to show the victory through
[58:51] that life you love him this morning
[58:53] you're talking about of deepness a heart
[58:55] to a part where our lives it's a
[58:58] pulsating where it's a life that's to
[59:00] live in expression it's not just
[59:02] something of that other of a church life
[59:04] but he is the entirety of that life it's
[59:08] a deepness of spirit not just an
[59:10] anointing that that comes you know you
[59:12] know how many times you know you can see
[59:14] things you can see things you know it
[59:16] well this is a praise break and you know
[59:18] they're all not chatting and everything
[59:19] else but friends listen I'm not making
[59:21] fun of that but when it comes down to it
[59:23] look what kind of mockery the things
[59:25] that's become to where lives that are
[59:27] liveth but it's such a mockery among the
[59:30] world where the world says me go to
[59:32] church why I know different than you and
[59:36] yet now listen I believe one thing we're
[59:38] gonna need we need to watch very
[59:40] carefully and not call everything that
[59:42] falls the Holy Ghost knows their demon
[59:46] anointing that comes as well oh yes
[59:48] Sarah when the Bible talks about
[59:50] doctrines of devils friends that is not
[59:53] the Holy Ghost bringing that bringing
[59:54] that doctrine that's a doctrine of
[59:55] devils there's a lot of things in there
[59:57] and I want to say it I want to say it
[1:00:00] like this it's very very important it is
[1:00:03] a must it isn't
[1:00:05] Sesa t that our lives be ready and not
[1:00:08] just ready to go but you're not you're
[1:00:10] not even ready to go unless you're ready
[1:00:12] to live now you know we're you know a
[1:00:17] religion something that's just once in a
[1:00:19] while something that's just an
[1:00:20] afterthought it's just a church life
[1:00:22] Church life's not gonna cut it a church
[1:00:24] like I'm telling you right now don't
[1:00:25] allow Satan to sell you short that's not
[1:00:29] what Calvary was about a church like the
[1:00:33] Calvary was about a shedding of his
[1:00:34] blood that his life might come back upon
[1:00:37] the worshiper and liberate you and I and
[1:00:41] bring a heartfelt deepness of Spirit to
[1:00:45] where whether you're in the house of God
[1:00:46] whether you're in the marketplace or
[1:00:48] you're in your house you're a Christian
[1:00:50] you have different at home than you do
[1:00:52] at church I'll tell you right now you're
[1:00:54] a hypocrite and you need to get rocked
[1:00:57] if you have different to somebody's face
[1:01:00] than you do on Facebook you're a
[1:01:02] hypocrite your heart's not right with
[1:01:05] God
[1:01:05] when the Lord Jesus came down in Matthew
[1:01:08] 23 these guys were all styled out real
[1:01:11] good but Jesus weren't looking at the
[1:01:13] outside he said I want to see your heart
[1:01:15] and your heart is food and contaminated
[1:01:21] whoo princesses it's checking up you see
[1:01:27] what it is it's looking at the balance
[1:01:29] of the world and you can have a weight
[1:01:33] and the weight of the word and there
[1:01:35] must have a life that matches that
[1:01:37] weight there's no life you know what I
[1:01:41] mean you can have a ball that has all
[1:01:43] the dimensions of a bowling ball when
[1:01:45] the ball should get out of the
[1:01:46] supermarket but you just look at those
[1:01:48] balls there's a different density it
[1:01:52] might look the same but there's a
[1:01:53] different density that's why God when
[1:01:57] God would set the density of his people
[1:02:00] even that of the apocrypha of the
[1:02:03] anointing oil it was not left up to
[1:02:05] outside means but he said and he
[1:02:07] referred to it your measurements shall
[1:02:09] be based on the tap on the sage of the
[1:02:11] shackle of the sea truth
[1:02:14] the show God provides for measurement of
[1:02:17] his word were men shaved down what the
[1:02:22] true reality is and then we have things
[1:02:24] that's not balancing up with the word
[1:02:26] but God himself
[1:02:28] provides to every generation the shell
[1:02:31] and it's the shell of the sanctuary
[1:02:35] that's minister oh my a deepness of the
[1:02:40] Spirit Bill Graham said it like this he
[1:02:42] says Oh God let me go Lord don't leave
[1:02:48] me behind Jesus let me go with your
[1:02:51] father I don't want to stay here on this
[1:02:53] earth to watch these tribulations coming
[1:02:55] on I don't want to stay here in this
[1:02:58] insanity I don't want to stand when
[1:03:00] hideous sites and people losing their
[1:03:02] mind we look at man trying to act like

[1:06:25] in the web of the devil young men
[1:06:26] perverted minds children dope addicts
[1:06:29] cigarette smoking drinking him moral
[1:06:30] Satan's Eden now if they with me now God
[1:06:33] had taken you six thousand years
[1:06:35] according to the Bible to build an
[1:06:36] evening and you put your son and his
[1:06:38] wife and there his bride to rule over
[1:06:40] and Satan come around and perverted it
[1:06:43] he's got six thousand years and he's
[1:06:45] built his own intellectual eating
[1:06:46] through science and education and
[1:06:48] so-called intelligence and he's building
[1:06:51] into a mess of death let me tell you
[1:06:56] what be or what thee what the motivating
[1:06:58] factor is behind that it is Babylon
[1:07:05] Mystery Babylon the Roman Catholic
[1:07:09] Church and the me just go ahead and put
[1:07:10] it in there and the Prophet said the
[1:07:12] preston's Protestants want to somehow
[1:07:14] classify themselves different he said
[1:07:16] they do the same thing because they are
[1:07:18] harlots of that horse system they do the
[1:07:23] same thing you know sometimes you hear
[1:07:24] things like that on the radio you hear
[1:07:26] things up oh boy the Roman Catholic
[1:07:28] Church and things like this and that in
[1:07:30] the Pope and you think hold on they're
[1:07:32] on our side don't you think that we're
[1:07:34] we tell you something it's not about our
[1:07:36] side as a man
[1:07:37] there is a clear side that you and I or
[1:07:39] to stand on and that is the side of the
[1:07:41] word the side of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:44] not the side of the church the side of
[1:07:47] the Lord Jesus Christ we be called to
[1:07:49] stand on his side he won't make nobody
[1:07:52] stand by his side but he asked y'all
[1:07:54] that's on the Lord's come stand by me
[1:07:57] [Applause]
[1:08:01] he's building into a message look at
[1:08:04] this friends that don't stay at churches
[1:08:05] even for people who don't doc in the
[1:08:08] church doors and they're forgetting when
[1:08:11] I was still teaching it was a whole you
[1:08:14] know what some of you know some of the
[1:08:15] teachers did they took a field trip to a
[1:08:17] church walked him to a church downtown
[1:08:19] some doesn't wanna know why almost 30
[1:08:22] kids in a class one raised their hand
[1:08:25] that they had ever been inside
[1:08:26] to church you understand there's worse
[1:08:32] things but sometimes you take some that
[1:08:35] are religiously educated but what I'm
[1:08:40] getting at is that you see such a place
[1:08:42] of mockery to where look what look what
[1:08:45] Satan's diabolic system has done it has
[1:08:49] not produced a real fervency a heart
[1:08:52] that beats forgot as a matter of fact
[1:08:54] it's produced opposition it's taken out
[1:08:58] from among the people I'm not talking
[1:09:01] about coming into a church of the lost
[1:09:02] feel this way I feel this way or
[1:09:04] whatever more sometimes you can just
[1:09:06] feel that way you walk in front of a
[1:09:07] monument you understand lord have mercy
[1:09:11] when I had to deliver flowers then big
[1:09:13] Catholic churches I had to walk in the
[1:09:14] door and all these Easter lilies I have
[1:09:16] to unload all that panel van lord have
[1:09:18] mercy I'll go I'm looking around to me
[1:09:20] with like a spook place I'm not saying
[1:09:23] that to put things down friends I'm just
[1:09:25] saying that within it within the midst
[1:09:26] of all of these things that our presence
[1:09:29] it's the presence of God that comes down
[1:09:33] to deal with hearts and life and when
[1:09:35] his presence comes down we don't want to
[1:09:37] just upon our flesh with a only just
[1:09:40] about our Spirit we want it to fall into
[1:09:44] the depths of my heart just upon our
[1:09:49] flesh it runs out you know how the
[1:09:51] prophet called that camp-meeting claims
[1:09:53] closed upon the spirit it's the same
[1:09:56] manner it's not the manna that's the
[1:09:59] problem it's where it falls if it's just
[1:10:04] on the flesh it runs out if it just on
[1:10:06] the spirit it runs out but if it falls
[1:10:08] into the soul it's taken there into the
[1:10:11] soul and the presence of God it's there
[1:10:13] to keep from time may now become the
[1:10:20] creature of eternity and there is a
[1:10:22] feeding that takes place they are fed by
[1:10:26] the divine energy their life is changed
[1:10:29] and now the heart pulsates
[1:10:31] the Living God he's built it into a mess
[1:10:38] look at the wreck look at the wreck with
[1:10:39] and things within where it comes down
[1:10:41] into families and everything else all of
[1:10:43] this and yet all of this is put out
[1:10:45] there the Prophet speaks of that in
[1:10:47] invisible union of how that everything
[1:10:49] now has become an imagery trying to look
[1:10:52] for something else and you've got
[1:10:53] Hollywood teaching people how to be
[1:10:55] families dear God have mercy that's been
[1:11:01] going on and look what it's produced
[1:11:04] mess because it's not real it's not true
[1:11:09] it's not genuine you say what are you
[1:11:11] saying but they're not telling you God
[1:11:13] is a God of every area of your life
[1:11:16] there's no God doesn't want to be God he
[1:11:21] wants to be found in every earring my
[1:11:30] name got started but I'm just going to
[1:11:36] refer over these things in the next part
[1:11:39] of the scripture here that we move into
[1:11:42] Paul goes on to say here and I have to
[1:11:45] read these to you he says seeing that we
[1:11:47] have such hope we use great plainness of
[1:11:51] speech our preaching it's not with soul
[1:11:56] figures of this mysterious and this
[1:12:03] that's not what the ministering of the
[1:12:05] words about trying to make things
[1:12:07] mysterious for people to wear when they
[1:12:09] come out of it oh that guy is so deep in
[1:12:13] what in what friends I don't know about
[1:12:18] you but I'm the depth I want is the
[1:12:20] depth of his life inside
[1:12:22] I don't it doesn't doesn't matter if if
[1:12:24] a person says well I think you're deeper
[1:12:26] I think you're shallow run more it's not
[1:12:27] up I don't measure myself by that I want
[1:12:30] to speak want the unction of the Spirit
[1:12:32] of God lays on my heart to speak doesn't
[1:12:34] matter sometimes he can change things
[1:12:37] that I don't even what I've studied out
[1:12:39] under his own show but then he can
[1:12:41] change it at a moment's notice and I
[1:12:42] don't even have one single note and yet
[1:12:45] he'll stand right there and deliver it I
[1:12:47] don't have one single note but it's what
[1:12:49] he he it's about him it's not about me
[1:12:53] it's about him most of that revelation
[1:12:56] is in what is in our hearts is now in
[1:12:59] your lives
[1:13:00] it's a transmission look at this in
[1:13:05] verse 13 not as Moses which put a veil
[1:13:09] over his face that the children of
[1:13:11] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[1:13:14] end of that which is abolished that veil
[1:13:17] over his face they were not able to look
[1:13:21] and see the end of the law to see the
[1:13:26] fulfillment what was it that kept them
[1:13:33] from that the Veil the veil now watch
[1:13:37] how Paul moves into this in verse 14 but
[1:13:41] their minds were blinded from till this
[1:13:45] day the same veil I'm taken away in the
[1:13:50] reading of the Old Testament it remains
[1:13:52] which veil is done away in Christ but
[1:13:56] even unto this day when Moses is read
[1:13:59] the veil is upon their heart so the veil
[1:14:02] that set Moses was wearing was a type of
[1:14:06] the veil
[1:14:07] that would be on their heart and the
[1:14:10] veil upon their heart that weren't
[1:14:12] blinded here is the very word that means
[1:14:14] dull callous lacking understanding it
[1:14:21] means to grow hard or become dull in an
[1:14:26] amazing better tree that is drawing
[1:14:30] water from the ground that tree he can
[1:14:35] draw that water
[1:14:36] my pushing out but you let that tree
[1:14:38] fall over in the water save water same
[1:14:44] tree what's happened the position of it
[1:14:48] the same water that once nourished it is
[1:14:51] now the water that rottens it come on
[1:14:55] somebody its position you must maintain
[1:14:59] your position that's why the Prophet
[1:15:04] uses that phrase in what I just referred
[1:15:06] to you at the tree keep life in you
[1:15:09] never let the spirit of revival die
[1:15:19] there's more to be said on that but
[1:15:21] let's move today blanket the veil is
[1:15:25] upon their heart but look what Paul look
[1:15:28] what Paul says nevertheless when it the
[1:15:31] heart the heart shall turn to the Lord
[1:15:35] the veil shall be taken away so the veil
[1:15:39] itself is there but it's that where
[1:15:45] their heart is not turned 40 if the
[1:15:50] heart is looking at the word um their
[1:15:54] eyes are looking at the word but the
[1:15:56] heart is not behind places I refer to
[1:16:01] you in the scripture here now think of
[1:16:05] us Israel could not stedfastly look to
[1:16:07] the end of it but within the midst of
[1:16:11] Israel there's an election and Paul
[1:16:15] deals with this he speaks of how that
[1:16:18] Israel was following after the law of
[1:16:22] righteousness I want you to catch this
[1:16:23] here they were following after the law
[1:16:26] of righteousness but they did not attain
[1:16:31] to the law of righteousness how do you
[1:16:34] follow after something and not attain to
[1:16:36] it it's exactly what he said in Romans 9
[1:16:42] wherefore Romans 9 32 wherefore how can
[1:16:45] this be because they sought it not by
[1:16:48] faith but as it were by the works of the
[1:16:53] law the heart wasn't in it it was not by
[1:17:00] faith it will simply by works doing
[1:17:06] enough to get by
[1:17:09] now remember remember these are people
[1:17:13] you couldn't put a finger on their life
[1:17:15] these are people when you compare them
[1:17:17] to the Lord Jesus remember they had more
[1:17:20] fruits of the spirit but they it was not
[1:17:25] the fruit of the Spirit that's why the
[1:17:29] problem be careful when you're reading
[1:17:30] this the Prophet says Christians science
[1:17:32] can have more talking about you starting
[1:17:36] with these these attributes these
[1:17:37] characteristics but the fruit of the
[1:17:40] Spirit is the fruit that is ordained to
[1:17:45] be made manifest in this season and when
[1:17:48] that truth is made manifest it has
[1:17:50] within it all of the characteristics of
[1:17:53] a life from the vine
[1:17:55] come through the branch and now make
[1:17:57] fruit see it's not something we're
[1:18:02] producing it's Christ we are in him than
[1:18:08] his life flows through us and what is it
[1:18:11] what's manifest through the branch the
[1:18:13] life of the vine the Bible goes on to
[1:18:19] say here in the book of Romans in 9 they
[1:18:23] are not all Israel which are of Israel
[1:18:26] see there's an election that was hidden
[1:18:29] within Paul says it's not because if
[1:18:33] they are all seated Abraham that they
[1:18:36] are all children remember as we've been
[1:18:39] the Spirit of God been taking us on that
[1:18:40] they had become so haughty with what
[1:18:45] they had been raised up under because so
[1:18:48] haughty and then different the Paul
[1:18:51] makes it clear it's not because they're
[1:18:53] the sea but in Isaac
[1:18:56] in the promise those are the promise of
[1:19:01] faith seed oh my Paul goes on to speak
[1:19:07] of missing Romans 11 I know I'm moving
[1:19:09] through this quick but I had this down
[1:19:11] for you he goes on to talk about how
[1:19:13] that in verse 5 of Romans 11 even so at
[1:19:17] this present time there is a remnant
[1:19:19] according to the election of grace Paul
[1:19:23] is very mighty Paul puts you and I into
[1:19:26] a place to be mindful that Israel never
[1:19:31] thought this could happen to him
[1:19:33] and Paul puts us when he's talking about
[1:19:36] the grafting of the the wild olive
[1:19:38] branch and Paul said you better be
[1:19:40] careful what the pride doesn't get in
[1:19:44] and become lifted up as though God can't
[1:19:47] make it without me you gotta be careful
[1:19:51] friends remember it is the grace of God
[1:19:54] I don't want to get ahead of myself but
[1:19:57] man I'm telling you I want to get
[1:19:59] somewhere Israel the Bible said in verse
[1:20:05] 7 Israel has not an 11-7 Israel have not
[1:20:09] obtained with that which he seeketh for
[1:20:13] these people were not as I've been
[1:20:15] saying like this lazy they were seeking
[1:20:19] for but the election hath obtained it
[1:20:23] and the rest were blinded they were
[1:20:28] seeking for it asked him if the Messiah
[1:20:32] is going to come absolutely
[1:20:33] we're expecting it
[1:20:42] Oh God but God could never forgot about
[1:20:50] Israel just as much as Sheila work
[1:20:54] hidden and wrote there in the scriptures
[1:20:57] he's not forgotten about Israel as a
[1:21:01] matter of fact for the Rebbe said
[1:21:02] they're there they're waiting on us to
[1:21:05] get out of the way let's say God help me
[1:21:10] get out of the way then we get out of
[1:21:13] the way so I can get out of the way the
[1:21:18] lady God's never forgot he's brought
[1:21:24] them back it was not the harsh hand it
[1:21:27] was the tender end of Jehovah tender
[1:21:30] mercies tender what the world despises
[1:21:34] it there was no Holocaust there what no
[1:21:37] this you know what what make what it is
[1:21:39] they try to deny those things are trying
[1:21:40] to sweep over let me tell you something
[1:21:42] it's the same diabolic spirit you what
[1:21:45] is it it's the rolling revival the
[1:21:48] Prophet said in in time seat side he
[1:21:50] said when they give back that part of
[1:21:52] Germany he said it will be now the old
[1:21:54] Roman Empire and he said what will it be
[1:21:57] the Roman revival because that Landers
[1:22:03] come back there is a branch revival
[1:22:06] because we have received our
[1:22:10] receive the borders of our land the land
[1:22:14] the promise that's been given back to us
[1:22:17] as believers we're Satan Wonderwall
[1:22:22] enough with traditions fill it up where
[1:22:25] the whole Eagles been down there that's
[1:22:27] that river Euphrates battle there for
[1:22:30] all those thousands of years but now the
[1:22:32] Holy Ghost is loose wrap back into the
[1:22:35] Church of the Living God
[1:22:37] once again what is it it's Christ
[1:22:39] reclaiming my children my life will be
[1:22:50] so lived that it will literally draw the
[1:22:53] rest out of the group
[1:22:55] what's he doing declaring his boundaries
[1:22:57] what is this this is that stone the
[1:23:03] Prophet tells us from Jubilee year he
[1:23:05] said there must be a ministry on the
[1:23:07] earth to catch that stole the ministry
[1:23:10] of the stove when the stone is coming
[1:23:12] down I say that ministry has already
[1:23:16] called to catch the coming stone he'll
[1:23:25] elude Jesus said to to the disciples he
[1:23:34] talked about how the people's hearts had
[1:23:37] waxed gross say me callous all
[1:23:42] insensitive but he says bless
[1:23:50] blessed are your ears for they hear and
[1:23:53] here's what he says for verily I say
[1:23:56] into you in Matthew 13 17 many prophets
[1:23:58] and righteous men have desired to see
[1:24:04] those things which you see I have not
[1:24:07] seen let me say this to you Paul has
[1:24:13] desired to see this I've preached about
[1:24:19] it he was declaring it what was hidden
[1:24:22] in this tree back there Paul those
[1:24:25] things begin to come out they've
[1:24:29] preached on the change of the body they
[1:24:32] preach these things what a privilege it
[1:24:35] is with this privilege comes a high
[1:24:39] responsibility to remember that it is
[1:24:44] grace that taught my heart his grace my
[1:24:50] fears His grace that brought me safe
[1:24:54] thus father
[1:24:55] His grace was safely kidding the Bible
[1:25:02] says in Zechariah 712 it speaks from how
[1:25:06] that they made their hearts they made
[1:25:10] their hearts adamant stone lest they
[1:25:15] should hear the law so there was a
[1:25:19] difference they were hearing it but they
[1:25:22] weren't hearing they were reading it but
[1:25:26] they weren't getting it lest they should
[1:25:28] hear the law and the words which the
[1:25:32] Lord of Hosts hath said they made their
[1:25:39] heart so hot where is our here and where
[1:25:41] is your see if your heart the presence
[1:25:45] of God that's how we see is with a heart
[1:25:47] not with these eyes these eyes can read
[1:25:50] these ears can hear but this on the
[1:25:54] inside they can hear
[1:25:57] it can see what these eyes can't see
[1:25:59] these eyes can see hallelujah
[1:26:50] Leslie should hear the law and the words
[1:26:53] which the Lord of Hosts hath sent in his
[1:26:59] spirit by the former prophets the hosts
[1:27:04] of the Lord were there on the mountain
[1:27:06] that day I'm not just talking about any
[1:27:10] last this time I'm talking about the
[1:27:13] hosts of the Lord were there the hosts
[1:27:16] of the Lord I'm talking about all the
[1:27:19] representation come on friends when
[1:27:23] Jacobs shows back up he comes across
[1:27:25] that River the Bible says he begins to
[1:27:28] see a whole host of angel and Jacob
[1:27:30] Cosette mania the head by the camp that
[1:27:33] of the two camps were to test heaven
[1:27:36] actually Ken Magnum Ljubljana whoa
[1:27:42] so who accompanied these prophets it was
[1:27:44] not just gotta cut them it was a lot of
[1:27:47] Hope standing behind his water his train
[1:27:52] filled the temple his presence comes
[1:27:55] with his word to confirm this word oku
[1:27:58] repeat of God if we are inside of that
[1:28:00] word dwelling inside of that word you
[1:28:02] say better send you do you got my back
[1:28:04] as somebody else bigger than brother
[1:28:06] Samuel and the Browns are there at the
[1:28:22] gates the gates is where transactions
[1:28:26] happen they want to approach the gates
[1:28:30] but there's a seagull that sends there
[1:28:33] the Holy Spirit says got more work this
[1:28:36] room is sealed they did this they did
[1:28:44] that did but the Bloods been apply the
[1:28:51] Lord of Hosts has sent in his spirit by
[1:28:56] the former prophets therefore came a
[1:28:58] great wrath from the Lord of hosts they
[1:29:01] never got in the spirit of the author
[1:29:04] they were reading but they never got in
[1:29:07] the spirit of the author
[1:29:18] sometimes you ever read something you
[1:29:19] have to go back and read there's one
[1:29:23] book that I read from cover to cover in
[1:29:25] school right at the end of my master's
[1:29:29] program I read I'm very always a little
[1:29:34] bit here you got saying that I always
[1:29:36] went through it and you know they teach
[1:29:38] you first a little bit of college you're
[1:29:40] going through and you're just skin
[1:29:40] picking through you're able to go
[1:29:42] through the pages moving through getting
[1:29:44] getting topics and something to eat all
[1:29:46] those things but this one my statistics
[1:29:48] I love them I understood it made sense
[1:29:52] to me there was things it was workable
[1:29:54] in it but other stuff you know it is
[1:29:57] when you've read it sometimes anyone or
[1:30:03] read in the scriptures you reading you
[1:30:05] think you reckon reading you listen to a
[1:30:08] message give it back give it back then
[1:30:14] what I do just committed to God that's
[1:30:18] the truth
[1:30:19] don't try to pry into it commit it to
[1:30:21] God God will bring I'm not just saying
[1:30:24] things things they're things up to you
[1:30:25] off the cuff I'm telling you right now
[1:30:27] that's exactly how God operates you
[1:30:30] bring those things to you actually have
[1:30:31] need of it but they didn't get in the
[1:30:33] spirit up but you see the prophets the
[1:30:39] prophets themselves were moved by the
[1:30:42] Spirit of God Peter declares that and we
[1:30:46] see that they were moved lifted up out
[1:30:50] of the earthly senses and they would
[1:30:54] speak things that it's not even
[1:30:58] reasonable to the human mind a virgin
[1:31:03] shall conceive it's not reasonable but
[1:31:09] you see what happened
[1:31:10] they were vessels instruments that were
[1:31:15] set aside
[1:31:17] they didn't make themselves holy they
[1:31:20] submitted to the voice that called them
[1:31:25] by submitting to that learner he brought
[1:31:28] separation to where the word could have
[1:31:31] preeminence and they as a prophet just
[1:31:36] let me refer to it in spiritual food and
[1:31:37] due season
[1:31:38] he said these prophets so lived in the
[1:31:43] world in the presence of the Lord
[1:31:46] till they be king that word I'm telling
[1:31:50] you brother and sister that is not just
[1:31:53] a privilege for the prophecy that was a
[1:31:57] time it was pointing to the perfect son
[1:32:02] the second Adam that was to come and his
[1:32:05] life was a declaration because no none
[1:32:08] of us were there but his life those of
[1:32:11] declaration of this is how I intended
[1:32:15] you to be this is how the first Adam was
[1:32:17] and this is my idea of sons and
[1:32:21] daughters wasn't a church idea it was
[1:32:25] God's thought they become so wrapped in
[1:32:31] the presence of God they were lifted
[1:32:35] lifted out of these senses the Bible
[1:32:38] says it he goes in you know enjoy a
[1:32:40] further place you see how that they
[1:32:42] would cry look out David David so
[1:32:44] yielded to the Spirit of God remember
[1:32:46] they were asking who's he talking of is
[1:32:50] this pavement talking about himself or
[1:32:53] the who is it was a spirit of Christ
[1:32:55] indeed for us it you see their lives
[1:32:58] were were touched by God knows by God
[1:33:01] and they were moved in that place to
[1:33:04] where there was a pulsation in their
[1:33:06] life to where that God was announcing
[1:33:10] his coming
[1:33:11] a further unfolding was taking place in
[1:33:14] their life let me say this the word just
[1:33:17] did not come to them and make an abrupt
[1:33:19] stop the word is living the word is not
[1:33:23] the water came in and continued to
[1:33:26] unfold and unfold and unfold
[1:33:29] going up like a roman candle poof over
[1:33:32] there it's unfolding itself
[1:33:37] he took the seals off himself it's him
[1:33:42] unfolding himself in your life
[1:33:48] he's the theme of it he's the thief he
[1:33:52] was the theme in the Old Testament he
[1:33:54] was a theme of error the Bible talks
[1:33:56] about him Peter of how but this
[1:33:59] salvation this salvation be receiving
[1:34:02] the end of your faith even the salvation
[1:34:05] or soul the Bible says that this
[1:34:08] salvation the prophets inquired and
[1:34:11] searched diligently they spoke these
[1:34:15] things what the Bible said the Spirit of
[1:34:17] Christ was in them it signified of his
[1:34:21] suffering he spoke of these things the
[1:34:23] Bible was on the st. Onge alas they'd
[1:34:26] administer these things which are now
[1:34:28] reported unto you by them that have
[1:34:30] preached the gospel with the Holy Ghost
[1:34:32] sent down from heaven what is it the
[1:34:36] same Holy Ghost that picked up the
[1:34:38] prophets and then begin to announce his
[1:34:41] the same Holy Ghost that came on the day
[1:34:43] of Pentecost and picked up those
[1:34:45] apostles picked up them each and every
[1:34:47] one of them and begin the minister that
[1:34:49] were it's the same Holy Ghost that goes
[1:34:52] with that word that lifts you and I in
[1:34:54] the kernel that word what is it it's God
[1:34:57] Himself to God be the glory
[1:34:59] it's the fullness of him that filleth
[1:35:01] all in all
[1:35:03] it's Christ these prophets these men
[1:35:15] they knew it was coming they knew it was
[1:35:19] coming
[1:35:19] look how wide you could stand on Mount
[1:35:22] Carmel he was not trying to reclaim the
[1:35:26] church he was there under the unction of
[1:35:29] the holding edge what was that not Karma
[1:35:31] visitation about it was about the
[1:35:33] looking forward to the salvation that
[1:35:37] was to come getting him back in line for
[1:35:40] the promise because the promise is gonna
[1:35:43] be fulfilled being at the right place at
[1:35:49] the right time at the right moment that
[1:35:53] right
[1:35:54] Israel noted the lamb was put up that in
[1:35:59] Egypt for 14 days Israel know it was
[1:36:02] coming there right they know that was
[1:36:06] coming
[1:36:06] the Prophet said Luther was looking for
[1:36:09] this video Wesley knew who's gonna come
[1:36:12] look what he said he says it in the
[1:36:14] message the token he said lay knew that
[1:36:17] the pillar fire was gonna visit the
[1:36:19] church again and make it all look back
[1:36:25] in the world and know that God never
[1:36:28] does anything breaking a pattern of his
[1:36:31] word
[1:36:32] are you with me at the end there of the
[1:36:36] time but that age when here was a
[1:36:39] summing up of the time to where the
[1:36:41] Redeemer would come balcony Israel how
[1:36:44] could lose her how could Wesley how
[1:36:46] could those true Pentecostals know that
[1:36:48] this would come in this hour how could
[1:36:50] they know that the pillar fire was going
[1:36:52] to return because in this hour the
[1:36:54] unction of the Spirit of God that was
[1:36:56] picking them up and revealing to them
[1:36:58] their part in the body whether it was
[1:37:00] the toes the feet the legs the pies
[1:37:02] whatever it was they knew they were a
[1:37:04] part of that body and they were
[1:37:06] thing with an unction because why here
[1:37:08] must come a bride in completeness
[1:37:10] because he made a promise he will
[1:37:12] present unto himself a church without
[1:37:14] spot wrinkle blemish or any such thing
[1:37:19] he must come again in his fullness
[1:37:22] that's redemption what is redemption
[1:37:29] claiming the body that he had brought
[1:37:32] forth he brought forth this body wearing
[1:37:35] good he brought it forth out of the womb
[1:37:37] and he steps forward by his word and he
[1:37:40] claims the body that he had got for the
[1:37:45] Bible said on who now see the staff
[1:37:48] descend and remain apart
[1:37:51] this was redemption hallelujah
[1:37:58] there was a man by the name of Simeon
[1:38:03] well we've been looking at Israel could
[1:38:06] not stedfastly look to the end of it but
[1:38:08] there was a man by the name of Simeon
[1:38:10] the Bible said he was a devout man and
[1:38:13] he had a testimony see the first thing
[1:38:16] that you've got to ask you question
[1:38:17] yourself do you have a testimony so he
[1:38:21] had a testimony before all of this
[1:38:23] coming and picking up the Messiah did
[1:38:26] not give him a testimony he already had
[1:38:28] a testimony that prepared him for that
[1:38:31] moment is that right
[1:38:33] he was a man the Bible the Bible says
[1:38:36] you know he that he was lady for the
[1:38:39] consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost
[1:38:41] was upon him
[1:38:43] it was waiting and resting upon his life
[1:38:47] there was a Simeon there was an Anna
[1:38:49] that was waiting for the consolation
[1:38:51] brother Samuel you just read that all
[1:38:53] the Israel was seeking for it and they
[1:38:55] didn't obtain it that's exactly right
[1:38:56] the natural Israel that was looking for
[1:38:59] it they did not obtain it but there was
[1:39:02] a remnant who was waiting
[1:39:05] line with the pulsation of the heart of
[1:39:07] God and they were lady constantly
[1:39:10] waiting for the fulfillment of the world
[1:39:14] their faith was not that they could
[1:39:17] explain it
[1:39:18] faith was his that God has said they had
[1:39:23] that same God who made the promise his
[1:39:26] the same God the Bible says the Holy
[1:39:28] Ghost was upon him
[1:39:30] let me tell you something the Holy Ghost
[1:39:32] so far rather pulled a lot and let you
[1:39:34] know Holy Ghost was upon him now once
[1:39:57] you catch this here it was revealed to
[1:40:00] him in him in Luke 226 it was revealed
[1:40:02] unto him by the Holy Ghost revealed that
[1:40:07] he should not see death before he had
[1:40:09] seen the Lord's Christ I don't care what
[1:40:12] kind of sickness tried to come his way
[1:40:13] he could stand there and say you can't
[1:40:15] touch me not in arrogance but he that
[1:40:23] was showing that there is a pride in the
[1:40:26] last days this type of lead here was
[1:40:28] Simeon that there's a bride pairs of
[1:40:30] people that one God has revealed his
[1:40:32] word though Satan may try to sell you
[1:40:34] this man said it that way but he cannot
[1:40:37] get to that soul
[1:40:43] we've been sealed by the Holy Spirit and
[1:40:47] that sea of alert seal is a security
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:56] [Applause]
[1:41:04] verse 27 and he came by the spirit into
[1:41:09] the temple how did he come by the spirit
[1:41:13] into the temple it does so here look
[1:41:15] look what what was revealed to him did
[1:41:18] not bring some sort of a hazard light
[1:41:21] well it's time to go to the temple again
[1:41:24] well it's time to it didn't bring that
[1:41:29] you think there weren't days that Simeon
[1:41:32] didn't get down they wouldn t now don't
[1:41:37] claim up on it I'm trying to I'm trying
[1:41:40] to show friends that the things are
[1:41:42] where that enemy wants to paint things
[1:41:44] so bad sometimes wants to paint it so
[1:41:46] bleak he wants to paint it well this is
[1:41:50] so bad but remember friends you're not a
[1:41:52] people without a covenant you're not a
[1:41:55] people without a promise that word
[1:42:01] whatever you have need up he's already
[1:42:04] got it covered
[1:42:04] he knew what it brought you along this
[1:42:06] way you meet me t he he tells me water
[1:42:10] breath he come back for you he yelled
[1:42:12] you need shoes on your feet
[1:42:17] I might kick down but don't you kill me
[1:42:50] I might go through text you might go
[1:42:55] through trial but don't you tell me how
[1:42:57] he came by the spirit into the temple
[1:43:07] and when the parents brought in the
[1:43:13] Child Jesus to do for him after the
[1:43:16] custom of the law which is here is Mary
[1:43:19] and Joseph bringing the child in after
[1:43:22] the custom of the law they're being
[1:43:25] brought to this place into this moment
[1:43:27] and Simeon being brought to this place
[1:43:30] it's why once you see here was Mary and
[1:43:34] Joseph they weren't doing things
[1:43:36] contrary to the word they were doing it
[1:43:40] according to the word see it wasn't
[1:43:43] malar free from the law no they were
[1:43:45] going they were operating according to
[1:43:47] the law and here's a man who was a
[1:43:49] devout man who living according to the
[1:43:50] law but what was the difference in them
[1:43:53] it was a pulsation in them it was not a
[1:43:57] formality
[1:43:59] it wasn't all print with no life if it
[1:44:06] meant fatherland
[1:44:09] they were waiting they were actively
[1:44:12] living in the prophecy of the word the
[1:44:16] Prophet said what the problem was with
[1:44:17] Israel they had gotten away from the
[1:44:19] supernatural part they began to read in
[1:44:23] the word and begin to come up with their
[1:44:25] own ideas about things the beginning
[1:44:29] they left off the supernatural part of
[1:44:31] God remembers we looked at that last
[1:44:33] week Jesus brought up that part where it
[1:44:36] says you transgress the commandment of
[1:44:40] the word by saying you know they went
[1:44:45] into that part then whosoever honors
[1:44:47] father and mother but rather just say
[1:44:48] it's a gift whereby thou must be
[1:44:50] prospered by me it showed they had no
[1:44:53] fear of God and no fear what was that he
[1:44:57] was removed from them they were reading
[1:45:00] his word but they didn't know him they
[1:45:03] had no fear so a man that could take
[1:45:05] away from the word they had no problem
[1:45:08] taking scissors to him they could cut
[1:45:10] out certain things come on somebody
[1:45:14] they had no fear because they had no
[1:45:17] heart they had no heart because they had
[1:45:19] no love come on somebody Jesus when he
[1:45:23] spoke to them what did he say in John
[1:45:26] eight I know that the love of God is not
[1:45:28] in your hearts they didn't have to it
[1:45:32] show that there even before the
[1:45:35] indwelling of the Holy Spirit that there
[1:45:38] was the potential and there was that
[1:45:41] where the love of God could dwell within
[1:45:43] a life what waiting for the fulfil it
[1:45:48] wasn't just words but they were moved by
[1:45:51] an inspiration they lived so close to
[1:45:56] that
[1:45:59] can I have just a little bit more time I
[1:46:01] want to just just bring you to this to
[1:46:03] this place here here when we look at I
[1:46:07] want you to think of this this statement
[1:46:10] then when you could look at their lives
[1:46:13] remember the Prophet said as I said
[1:46:14] moments ago you could not put a finger
[1:46:16] on the room but yet just because they
[1:46:21] could do this and this even to the paint
[1:46:24] I knew all of those but yet that is not
[1:46:35] a life live they're gone with the print
[1:46:42] begin accept the life live by the word
[1:46:46] that's their thinking of how it was but
[1:46:50] that was not elected by the word jesus
[1:46:53] said in the where he first heard of what
[1:46:56] moses spoke to them God led you and
[1:47:00] suffered you to hunger fed you with man
[1:47:04] that you might know that man does not
[1:47:10] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:47:13] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:47:17] so it's not just it falls out sustained
[1:47:21] it's done now there is a continuance in
[1:47:25] his word
[1:47:29] it's a walking long in his word so a
[1:47:33] life being lived by the latter is not
[1:47:36] the word expressed but the word
[1:47:41] expressed is when the heart of that word
[1:47:45] is that's a life expressed by the word
[1:47:54] this is what Jesus is dealing with this
[1:47:57] part here this is where the Prophet I
[1:47:59] love hi says there's some souls in
[1:48:01] prison now I want to read this to you he
[1:48:03] says not by speaking in tongues not by
[1:48:05] dancing in the spirit not by church
[1:48:06] joining not by fruit to this
[1:48:07] Christian science can smother any of you
[1:48:09] on that and deny even Jesus Christ was
[1:48:11] divine
[1:48:12] not that but it's the word living there
[1:48:15] is if they'd have only looked he was
[1:48:17] Messiah he was the Living Word made
[1:48:19] manifest and a man that's got the Spirit
[1:48:22] of God in him or a woman lifts that word
[1:48:25] and lives right out in them that's the
[1:48:28] heartbeat the predestinated for the word
[1:48:31] of the Lord comes to them and they are
[1:48:33] aware to the people the heartbeat when
[1:48:38] the latter times each place in your
[1:48:41] heart
[1:48:42] it's my heartbeat upon its pulsating out
[1:48:48] pull out for the bank cows eating
[1:48:50] through the branches the water comes why
[1:48:54] what is the work because there is a part
[1:48:57] that is already by coordination
[1:49:03] the Spirit of God moves upon our eyes
[1:49:07] you're talking about hard people in
[1:49:09] different people follow me back to the
[1:49:11] beginning to service there is a people
[1:49:13] who are a lot closer people who studied
[1:49:17] for a long time
[1:49:18] lot closer that pored over this Bible a
[1:49:22] long time here how he remember Jesus
[1:49:28] made a great supper
[1:49:29] these are telling to come they said you
[1:49:32] don't tell him we got other things to do
[1:49:35] so they sent him excuses I'm gonna tell
[1:49:40] your name no excuse it's gonna get you
[1:49:42] out the flames ahead
[1:49:44] very nice Cuse that'll get you out the
[1:49:46] Tribulation Period but there is a token
[1:49:50] and it's not just getting the token so
[1:49:53] you can escape it because if that's your
[1:49:55] reason you won't get it your motives are
[1:49:57] wrong because you wouldn't want to live
[1:50:00] why you would want to live right
[1:50:01] you wouldn't be faithful when you got
[1:50:03] there so the token itself
[1:50:06] that's why prophet says and many times
[1:50:08] he said that's why the token is not so
[1:50:10] readily given out why motives motives
[1:50:15] but people have behind the Morelle
[1:50:17] Simeon was lay your hands on me that I
[1:50:19] can receive this power that I can do
[1:50:20] things wrong move it well god I want to
[1:50:25] be a better man that's an admirable
[1:50:26] thing but it's more than being a better
[1:50:30] man to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:50:32] here's the fell in love with him fall in
[1:50:36] love with him
[1:50:37] not a chance
[1:50:39] [Applause]
[1:50:43] the person their table had become a
[1:50:55] snare psalm 69 verse 21 this is the
[1:51:01] million of the Missi annex songs let me
[1:51:05] just read this part because it on the
[1:51:07] cross they gave me also golf for me and
[1:51:09] in my thirst they gave me vinegar to
[1:51:11] drink let their table become a snare
[1:51:15] before now we know what a table is right
[1:51:19] I'm not talk about a coffee table Amy
[1:51:22] ain't talking about a sofa table
[1:51:24] we're talking about a table from the
[1:51:27] looks at us nobody has to tell us what
[1:51:28] to do that's right this is a table
[1:51:35] what's the table let their table and
[1:51:43] that which should have been for their
[1:51:46] welfare let it become a trap you mean
[1:51:53] the very word they were following after
[1:51:56] the law righteousness they were seeking
[1:51:59] for you mean that the table because
[1:52:05] they're setting it and the law was there
[1:52:07] but it wasn't just the law the table is
[1:52:12] their teacher their o their ideas their
[1:52:23] thoughts I want you to watch this listen
[1:52:25] look what their thoughts and ideas did
[1:52:27] did it humble or did it blow Allah
[1:52:33] that's why when somebody wants to come
[1:52:35] and give doctrine I want to see what it
[1:52:37] does for you you make sure that you're a
[1:52:40] true representation of the true doctrine
[1:52:42] of this life
[1:52:43] that's why when things are constructing
[1:52:46] to run more I want to say is that what
[1:52:47] it produces
[1:52:48] I don't want okay we got this quote here
[1:52:52] not this quote here got this scripture I
[1:52:53] see what it's producing it's a false
[1:52:58] image you've taken things that God has
[1:53:02] given and constructed a false image I
[1:53:04] don't want no one you can keep it and
[1:53:08] see what kind of life that it produces I
[1:53:10] don't want a mom this was a bad life is
[1:53:13] it not there people had become a snare
[1:53:19] Oh mom they're teaching
[1:53:22] what would their teaching doing their
[1:53:24] teaching was not building people up in
[1:53:25] the faith of the world they had the wall
[1:53:28] they had the prophets they had all these
[1:53:30] things their teaching wasn't building
[1:53:32] people up in faith it was tearing it
[1:53:33] down that's why the had to take away
[1:53:37] from the way well yeah it's not on or
[1:53:39] father and mother
[1:53:40] you just can't you're just a gift to
[1:53:41] them there's no power of God that can
[1:53:44] come behind they work Mac then no matter
[1:53:47] what the situation wasn't that young
[1:53:48] person's alive but if they could take
[1:53:50] that work and stand on their word and
[1:53:52] plead that promise it's not the man the
[1:53:54] flesh that comes and gets a hold of the
[1:53:56] promise it's Almighty God who comes on
[1:53:59] the scene and fulfills that promise let
[1:54:01] me tell you something church it is not
[1:54:03] us that's making the word come to pass
[1:54:05] it's the Spirit of God coming through
[1:54:07] the word building our faith in the world
[1:54:10] that is the Ministry of the seventh
[1:54:13] angel was to go on restore Bible Ted
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:21] wouldn't need a new Bible we need faith
[1:54:24] restored back in the Bible that was
[1:54:28] given
[1:54:31] hello a great advantage poll said they
[1:54:38] had a great advantage it'd be like you
[1:54:43] know brother Doug you and I you know we
[1:54:44] were at a buffet that one Buffett we
[1:54:46] went to over there a place in one day
[1:54:48] let's say you were sitting at a table
[1:54:50] right close that Buffett remember you
[1:54:51] can just reach over get a plate and get
[1:54:53] the stuff and Here I am clearing that
[1:54:54] other room where they put us that day
[1:54:57] who's closer he is who really has an
[1:55:02] advantage he does he has an advantage
[1:55:05] because he can say they just brought out
[1:55:07] dressed my song oh they just brought off
[1:55:10] this fettuccine oh they just brought out
[1:55:13] fifty times all day I don't know what
[1:55:15] they're bringing out I've got to keep
[1:55:17] running back and forth running back and
[1:55:18] forth don't you see Paul said that they
[1:55:21] had the advantage he said chiefly in
[1:55:25] every way to them was the covenants to
[1:55:30] them pertain with the adoption all of
[1:55:32] these things
[1:55:33] there wasn't any promise that was so so
[1:55:38] brought out there so play declare of the
[1:55:41] Gentile but yet we see even when Simeon
[1:55:44] speaks about the light to lighten the
[1:55:46] Gentiles even placed in the word some
[1:55:49] small parts were mention about the
[1:55:51] Gentiles
[1:55:52] Hosea Habakkuk all the different places
[1:55:54] Isaiah it was mentioned in there this is
[1:55:57] why Paul could say when the Spirit of
[1:56:00] God would move in this time in this hour
[1:56:02] that the Jews themselves having the law
[1:56:04] they had an advantage but the Spirit of
[1:56:07] God could pick Paul up and he can show
[1:56:10] Paul the mystery that was kept hidden
[1:56:12] and Paul could come back and begin to
[1:56:14] declare that mystery that you and I were
[1:56:17] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[1:56:20] he could speak the give riches and the
[1:56:23] unsearchable riches of Almighty God and
[1:56:25] let you have no whose talent is dogs and
[1:56:28] outcasts but yet beneath it all gods and
[1:56:31] she'll get it all then what will seem to
[1:56:34] be a disadvantage God where we learn we
[1:56:42] were looking he came there shuttle
[1:56:52] traditions their traditions and so took
[1:56:56] them away you know it's like it's like
[1:57:00] you know a place to where they have so
[1:57:02] contrived these traditions to where they
[1:57:04] didn't even recognize him when he came
[1:57:06] like an internet scam artist send
[1:57:11] another picture of this big buck where
[1:57:18] you from I'm from Ohio but I have a
[1:57:20] British connection I would love to marry
[1:57:24] human seen all of the limousine
[1:57:31] understand he's showing the picture
[1:57:33] people falling over the picture and not
[1:57:38] seeing who is the character behind it I
[1:57:41] hope you with me now that goes now it's
[1:57:44] not just a picture it's the character
[1:57:47] John was ready to bow before the image
[1:57:50] with the Spirit of God said let me show
[1:57:53] you the character they looked at the
[1:58:00] Pharisee who said ma what an image Jesus
[1:58:03] said full of dead men's bones what was
[1:58:11] it he was a ministry that came to reveal
[1:58:14] character
[1:58:16] because what was going to be taken in
[1:58:19] the upper room was the Spirit of God to
[1:58:21] come down and not to lift up a fallen
[1:58:25] character but to reveal what was hidden
[1:58:28] there beneath the darkness true image Oh
[1:58:36] glory be to God you're loving this
[1:58:38] morning I want you to think of this the
[1:58:41] very promise of God what it did to
[1:58:42] Pharaoh and to his servant in hardness
[1:58:46] look what what is that his presence but
[1:59:01] there is a receptiveness he's tendering
[1:59:04] us he's molding us bringing us into the
[1:59:08] preparation when the Israel went into
[1:59:17] Babylon why did they go into Babylon
[1:59:20] heart condition what was going to get

[1:59:30] you shall seek me with all your heart
[1:59:31] and so then I shall be found of you what
[1:59:36] condition put them in but turn to the
[1:59:39] heart
[1:59:40] brought a lot God you got in this world
[1:59:46] Psalms twenty seven eight David I want

[2:06:02] you in the book of Zechariah the Lord of
[2:06:05] Hosts was with that word that was spoken

[2:06:31] looking at a word and saying well I
[2:06:33] don't think we can do this or I don't
[2:06:34] think and do this here was a master that

[2:06:43] in it took that they begin to tighten up
[2:06:49] the strings you see what it was he was

[2:07:26] Prophet said he said he won the dry eye
[2:07:28] sitting at that auction what was going
[2:07:30] to be sold for pennies became priceless
[2:07:33] imitated something that the Spirit of
[2:07:35] God has come to him he tore the seals
[2:07:37] off of this Bible he tuned me to do he
[2:07:40] tuned it up he didn't add to it or take
[2:07:44] away he took what was here and the great
[2:07:47] rose and stroke of predestination the
[2:07:49] Spirit of God poured out in this hour to
[2:07:52] make that word Leah what did he do he
[2:07:54] begin to bring them promises to life
[2:07:56] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that
[2:07:59] saved a wretch like me a generation in

[2:09:36] talked about that advantage let us be
[2:09:38] careful brothers and sisters to take
[2:09:44] heed of the word that God has delivered
[2:09:47] to us the preaching of the word the
[2:09:50] hearing of the word the Lord passing
[2:09:53] right through and confirming his word he
[2:09:57] passed right through he passed right
[2:10:00] through the Pool of Bethesda there was
[2:10:02] one man from college he passed right
[2:10:05] through this age passing right through

[2:10:51] believe that I believe nobody says I'm
[2:10:53] just gonna be a form
[2:10:56] but I just want to just encourage you
[2:10:58] don't don't let Satan put anything over
[2:11:01] it you have that there's anything less
[2:11:03] than a full life
[2:11:05] don't don't don't let Satan put anything

[2:11:09] same God you might have here I've been
[2:11:12] serving the Lord for years in your life
[2:11:14] but you might see you feel like Lord I'm
[2:11:19] gonna be there's a closer walk I don't
[2:11:24] want to just I don't want to stand still
[2:11:26] you know the Prophet God's chosen place
[2:11:28] of worship in the middle of the prayer
[2:11:30] he said they're dying may the people who
[2:11:33] follow this message never stand still
[2:11:37] for a denomination the key word has not
[2:11:40] been on the nation the key word is
[2:11:42] keywords
[2:11:43] stand still
[2:11:46] don't stop when God has revealed its
[2:11:49] word its continuing to walk in the light
[2:11:52] as he is in the light
[2:11:55] my brother Brent gave that example that
[2:11:57] men said I could you know he said I come
[2:11:59] going with me over home
[2:12:00] Levin so I can't see your home he's no
[2:12:03] brother Romney said there's a pastor
[2:12:04] right here he said I got a lantern he
[2:12:06] said we can walk in this path and said
[2:12:07] it we're on the other side of that hill
[2:12:08] he said is my house for the better said
[2:12:11] to the brother he said brother that's
[2:12:12] the same way this before he said you
[2:12:14] just take the light of the word he said
[2:12:15] walk in the light and as you walk in it
[2:12:18] he'll reveal more walk in it walk means
[2:12:23] you move in it occupy it how do i oq PI
[2:12:27] by letting it occupy you that's how we
[2:12:30] occupy let the life Israel occupied the
[2:12:33] land by letting the life giver of the
[2:12:36] promise occupy there when they stop
[2:12:39] letting the life giver occupy them they
[2:12:41] lost the land they were staying so it's
[2:12:44] him occupying us Lord every part every
[2:12:47] every every aspect of me search me out
[2:12:51] and whatever the need whatever the
[2:12:53] promise does not promised us a spirit of
[2:12:57] improvising he promised us his spirit
[2:13:01] which brings us into harmony with his
[2:13:04] word but you know it's a great symphony
[2:13:09] things have tuned up things are brought
[2:13:13] into we're looking at the sheet music
[2:13:14] and from the sheet music and we're able
[2:13:17] to look at that at the director I've
[2:13:19] seen the Greek Holy Spirit moving
[2:13:21] bringing the Junction's so we know as
[2:13:24] we're going moving along
[2:13:27] by his grace his presence with his word
[2:13:32] don't I'll say from my heart and say
[2:13:35] from this church Lord I don't want my
[2:13:37] life to become just
[2:13:41] I wanted to be the pulsation of his
[2:13:47] principles that's why they even David
[2:13:49] when he instructed Solomon about
[2:13:51] building the temple he said son serving
[2:13:54] with a perfect heart and with a willing
[2:13:57] mind
[2:13:59] she went on to tell him David some the
[2:14:01] Bible says on his first song the Bible
[2:14:04] says that David spoke within that time
[2:14:06] and said seek the Lord and his strength
[2:14:08] seek his face shewbread Pinilla seek his
[2:14:13] face continually continually we need you
[2:14:18] it's his presence you know how it is
[2:14:21] sometimes you've been going through
[2:14:23] something in your life maybe you're a
[2:14:25] test to trial maybe you've been in the
[2:14:27] doctor's office I don't know but you
[2:14:29] understand what I mean there might be
[2:14:30] something maybe you're just down and all
[2:14:33] of a sudden here you are you start
[2:14:35] thinking about him and he gave you a
[2:14:37] little something to think on and you're
[2:14:39] gonna fake it on it as you start
[2:14:41] thinking on it all the sudden there's
[2:14:46] this press is just sweeps down don't
[2:14:49] mean the world do you you just find
[2:14:51] yourself here your hands might be you
[2:14:53] know covered in butter and you know you
[2:14:55] have a knife here between your heart and
[2:14:56] thinking Lord Jesus what is it its
[2:14:59] strength
[2:14:59] it's his pressing gets prescence by his
[2:15:03] word coming by his presence what is it
[2:15:07] his word that's why the property could
[2:15:09] say he says we get his word in our mind
[2:15:12] and in our hearts what happens his
[2:15:15] presence the Prophet told us what did he
[2:15:19] say many times in the beginner service
[2:15:20] such simple instructions but he would
[2:15:23] say now land a middle disservice he said
[2:15:25] I want you to get this promise on your
[2:15:27] heart and I want you to start thinking
[2:15:29] about that promise that I'm the Lord
[2:15:30] that he loves me I want you to see it in
[2:15:32] your heart right now that you're not
[2:15:34] gonna be on that cot or you're not going
[2:15:35] to be in that wheelchair he's not trying
[2:15:37] to make them mind over matter but it's
[2:15:39] trying to let him see let the word have
[2:15:41] the preeminence in your thoughts because
[2:15:43] the Prophet tells us that even in the
[2:15:45] days of the Lord Jesus and in his
[2:15:47] ministry
[2:15:48] he said when he would be standing there
[2:15:49] on the platform he said he would all of
[2:15:51] a sudden he would feel a pulsation and
[2:15:55] he said what it was there was a meet in
[2:15:57] the audience there was a need somebody
[2:15:59] had a need they had gone to thinking on
[2:16:01] that word and their faith was when what
[2:16:03] their faith was rising in the Living God
[2:16:06] to perform that word and what was it it
[2:16:08] was a pulsation through the bread said
[2:16:11] like a heartbeat thank God his attention
[2:16:14] how would he know lamb was act the
[2:16:17] heartbeat found the heart met the
[2:16:21] heartbeat found the heartbeat that
[2:16:23] promise was their deliverer she is
[2:16:32] beating
[2:16:39] he wants to be everything he wants to be
[2:16:42] our all in all he wants to feel every
[2:16:45] part of our life every SP goes
[2:16:50] he's all in all everything everything
[2:16:55] that we have needed friends he already
[2:16:58] had he already has four family
[2:17:02] he comes down in this this service like

[2:17:06] single word his presence come behind his
[2:17:10] word to make his word known to you you

[2:19:04] chamber every area Lord God as I've read
[2:19:07] enough study the heart itself has four
[2:19:09] chambers chambers within their Lord and
[2:19:12] how that those chambers have to work in
[2:19:14] such a harmony and synchronization with
[2:19:17] one another each one has its part Lloyd
[2:19:21] your god when we've read about this of
[2:19:23] where a heart can become blinded heart
[2:19:26] wax gross
[2:19:28] it's where Lord God a condition as I was
[2:19:31] reading it's called cardiomyopathy Lloyd
[2:19:33] to where there's a thickening to where
[2:19:36] that there's a part of that heart in
[2:19:38] that chamber that's not working
[2:19:39] correctly maybe it's a part board that
[2:19:41] is where it's putting forth the blood
[2:19:43] into the lungs to get the oxygen and
[2:19:45] bringing it back overlord it putting it
[2:19:47] out through the rest of the body maybe
[2:19:48] it's not working just properly your God
[2:19:51] I pray this morning father
[2:19:56] knowing that we are standing here near
[2:19:58] presence I don't believe there's a soul

[2:25:30] brother Brown picks it up in modern
[2:25:32] events made clear about prophecy
[2:25:34] expressed as to how the Scriptures he
[2:25:39] said this is not just a look of history
[2:25:41] it's a book of prophecy so living
[2:25:47] and he goes into that and he says
[2:25:51] the believers those who are believing
[2:25:57] and looking for these promises waiting
[2:26:00] patiently on their toes waiting for them
[2:26:06] to be fulfilled is who it's revealed
[2:26:12] now you might look and you would look at
[2:26:15] those Pharisees and different ones we
[2:26:19] would say I think they're on their toes
[2:26:24] right you would say I think they're on
[2:26:26] their toes they're quoting it they're
[2:26:29] doing this we're doing it but there's a
[2:26:32] Peter there's an Andrew so we've got
[2:26:37] John the Baptist we've got Hannah we've
[2:26:39] got Simeon we hit them but then let's
[2:26:40] take a let's take the Peter let's take
[2:26:42] the Andrew let's take to Philip let's
[2:26:43] take the Daniel let's take all there
[2:26:44] let's take these different ones here
[2:26:46] they are they look like there's no way
[2:26:51] they're waiting for it
[2:26:55] there was a pulsation in their heart
[2:26:58] waiting for that moment this is why that
[2:27:02] even where that phil could go to
[2:27:05] Nathanael and say come come see I just
[2:27:10] can't even tell you about it
[2:27:11] come see what do you say we have found
[2:27:16] him Moses and the Lost Book of you what
[2:27:21] does he say the image that was there in
[2:27:24] that word we found it they were on their
[2:27:30] toes now move that move it forward now
[2:27:35] with a forward they were on their toes
[2:27:38] and then look what takes place after his
[2:27:41] resurrection he pierced to them he
[2:27:45] speaks to them on what their to do right
[2:27:48] and the Bible says when he was a sin me
[2:27:52] the scripture says at the end of loop
[2:27:55] recording it that they returned unto
[2:27:58] Jerusalem with joy
[2:28:03] why the ground goes onto that scripture
[2:28:06] says they returned with joy because they
[2:28:09] knew he was gonna make good on that
[2:28:10] promise see he had raised and revealed
[2:28:15] himself to them for what banku faced
[2:28:18] when he walked with him on the road to
[2:28:21] Emmaus he didn't come out and try to say
[2:28:23] look look look look look look look look
[2:28:24] look he began in Moses he took them
[2:28:28] through the scriptures concerning
[2:28:29] himself what was he doing building Bible
[2:28:34] faith you say what was going on what was
[2:28:38] going on in his ministry before the
[2:28:39] resurrection wasn't a Bible faith being
[2:28:41] built sure it was faith here's the
[2:28:44] living God among us now it had to be
[2:28:47] built their faith they had to take all
[2:28:50] of that and had become accumulated for
[2:28:54] them to move into the next feast to
[2:28:58] where now they have faith for the
[2:29:00] promise for their lives what do you find
[2:29:05] Peter waited on his toes he doesn't look
[2:29:09] like the Peter that they found out there
[2:29:11] fishing he's had been changed what's
[2:29:13] happened what he was waiting for is
[2:29:15] being unfolded in his life
[2:29:19] it's being afforded is waiting
[2:29:22] earnestly this is where think of this
[2:29:26] 1963 flashing red lights was coming and
[2:29:29] the Prophet gives the example of a train
[2:29:33] passing through
[2:29:34] what's rid of trains do and make the
[2:29:36] style like different ones of different
[2:29:37] ones of you us we fly you got a fly to a
[2:29:40] hook right
[2:29:41] you can't sometimes in flight straight
[2:29:42] shots and you have to get off of the hub
[2:29:44] and here you are at Atlanta I'm in
[2:29:46] Detroit I'm looking where's my gate why
[2:30:00] then when they stop there I should have
[2:30:03] time to go do something there's like a
[2:30:04] 50 minute window sometimes I want to
[2:30:07] have sometimes two hours sometimes for
[2:30:09] three hours sometimes what is that it's
[2:30:10] a time of a delay you have time that you
[2:30:15] can go get something this is where the
[2:30:18] Prophet said it's time to throw away
[2:30:24] it's time all the things that have been
[2:30:26] picked up at the Whistle Stop it's time
[2:30:28] to let it go it's time to get on board
[2:30:31] it's time to be in the Train now time to
[2:30:37] stop time to look around there's not
[2:30:39] time to take souvenirs it's time to be
[2:30:42] in the tree all the peanuts and
[2:30:45] everything else inside everything
[2:30:53] it's time to become supreme more look if
[2:30:58] the Prophet himself I don't think
[2:30:59] anybody or one of us would argue and say
[2:31:01] well brother Branham wasn't sincere
[2:31:03] there's not one if you would say this
[2:31:05] man wasn't sincere you need help but how
[2:31:08] the Spirit of God dealt with his life
[2:31:10] and said you need to be
[2:31:13] you know what he said help me be more
[2:31:16] sincere than that because I this is the
[2:31:20] sincerity but you're calling for for
[2:31:22] more sincerity help me
[2:31:25] helped me to come to that place
[2:31:28] so when our heart is longing Lord I want
[2:31:31] more than you I want to be closer to you
[2:31:34] he brings us into that place
[2:31:40] No
[2:31:42] no we've been here water and I don't
[2:31:45] intend to keep you hours studying
[2:31:51] [Music]
[2:31:53] these burns in my heart
