[41:50] minister to us Lord speak to our lives
[41:53] Lord to every need Lord
[41:56] we love you and we need you Lord
[41:59] in the name of Jesus Christ
[42:02] amen
[42:03] amen isn't it good to be in the house of
[42:05] the Lord
[42:07] amen
[42:08] amen I just as you're turning with me in
[42:11] in the scriptures
[42:13] I'm going to ask you to turn with me to
[42:15] the book of Deuteronomy and
[42:18] uh I'll be there in the first and second
[42:21] chapter there
[42:22] um I just want to make a couple
[42:24] announcements that when I know sometimes
[42:27] on the dismissal we are here and we're
[42:30] worshiping a little later just to make
[42:32] sure if you are leaving just make sure
[42:34] on the dismissal you go ahead and slip
[42:36] on out and don't uh just staying in the
[42:38] aisleways because sometimes people are
[42:40] trying to others trying to get by and
[42:42] then when we get out on going out into
[42:44] the foyer so if you know you want we
[42:47] welcome you to stay into worship but if
[42:49] you are doing that just try to do it
[42:51] inside of the Pew and so that people are
[42:53] able to still exit as they feel to exit
[42:56] and go ahead and go on their way also
[42:58] want to make mention to you uh just kind
[43:00] of been brought to our attention that
[43:03] I know we have like the cough drops and
[43:07] there's been other rappers that we found
[43:09] here and in the sanctuary and we just
[43:13] asked that first of all I we've had some
[43:17] gum chewing going on and gum wrappers
[43:20] and things and I I'll just tell you
[43:21] personally I don't think that's the
[43:23] place chew gum
[43:26] I just tell you I don't think that's a
[43:28] place to chew gum I think that we want
[43:31] we come to the house of God we ought to
[43:32] give everything we've got and respect to
[43:34] his presence
[43:35] and if you need a cough drop that's fine
[43:38] that's maybe a different story but just
[43:40] make sure you you know you're just
[43:41] careful to pick up the wrapper put it in
[43:43] your pocket and then there's a trash can
[43:45] there and I think there's trash cans
[43:47] almost in every room here in the
[43:48] building amen so if you could that would
[43:51] make it a lot easier when they have to
[43:53] come through and and clean it so they
[43:55] don't have to pick that up so is
[43:56] everybody okay with that
[43:58] there's kleenexes too you know we don't
[44:00] want to
[44:02] you know we don't want to touch those
[44:03] kleenexes and things like that so you
[44:05] just put them in your pocket and take
[44:07] them with you and amen and well it's so
[44:10] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[44:12] morning it's just it's good to be here
[44:13] and amen these aren't the things that I
[44:16] enjoy as a pastor but you know it's it's
[44:18] just like a father at home sometimes I
[44:20] got to cover things at home that maybe
[44:22] not made joyous and great Revelation but
[44:25] it's things that need to be done
[44:26] you know there's one thing to call
[44:29] people to dinner when you've got dinner
[44:30] and it's another thing to say pick up
[44:32] your room you know that's not quite the
[44:34] same but we just we thank God Amen that
[44:37] he's given us a place amen a place where
[44:39] we can come together and to worship Him
[44:41] and Liberty and freedom and
[44:44] um so we thank God for that I as you're
[44:46] turning there I I know with the trustees
[44:49] and it probably would be better if they
[44:50] had given it um and they probably would
[44:53] have if I would have just mentioned it
[44:54] or whatever but they have contacted that
[44:58] the Amish crew and it was actually over
[45:00] a month ago
[45:01] for them that are going to do this out
[45:04] out there and you know the brothers got
[45:06] other bids on it but it wasn't the way
[45:09] that it was drawn up and designed that
[45:12] the brothers drew it up and brother
[45:13] Richie actually had drawn that up and um
[45:16] and so you know we don't fault other
[45:19] companies and you know it's just it
[45:21] would be a quite of a different thing to
[45:24] have somebody else to do it and what we
[45:26] had in our mind and so you just keep
[45:28] praying for that those that con that uh
[45:30] Amish crew has has contacted brother
[45:33] Richie and they came out and looked at
[45:35] the the job and things like that and
[45:36] they're going to do it so it should be
[45:37] any day that they would be starting that
[45:40] so you just keep that in prayer will you
[45:41] do that amen because that certainly will
[45:44] be very very nice and I think God Amen
[45:47] for how he's provided for us let's look
[45:49] here in the word and
[45:51] we just see how the Lord will take us
[45:53] here this morning and
[45:56] um
[45:58] maybe if we could let's just start at
[46:00] Deuteronomy 1 and verse one I'm kind of
[46:03] pulled on where to actually to read from
[46:05] but um
[46:06] uh well maybe you know what let's just
[46:09] read from Deuteronomy 2 I I don't want
[46:11] to have you standing that long
[46:13] uh
[46:15] and Deuteronomy sorry Deuteronomy
[46:19] chapter 2 and verse 2.
[46:22] and the Lord spake unto me saying
[46:27] ye have compassed this mountain long
[46:31] enough
[46:33] turn you northward
[46:36] I want to read that verse 2 again but
[46:38] I'm going to read that as personal
[46:41] the Lord spake unto me
[46:43] saying ye have compassed this mountain
[46:46] long enough
[46:48] turn you northward
[46:52] I'd like to just speak to you this
[46:54] morning on long enough
[46:56] long enough
[46:58] God bless you as you're being seated
[47:05] some weeks ago was I was just walking in
[47:07] here and of course that's where how God
[47:09] will deal with us on inspiration and
[47:10] just praying and the Holy Spirit just
[47:13] dropped this in and
[47:16] just waiting on the moment here to to
[47:19] bring it and I just felt I knew even
[47:22] from last week this was the moment to
[47:24] bring it and we'll just see how far the
[47:26] Lord will let us get in this but I want
[47:28] to take a a look here at this thought on
[47:33] Long
[47:33] enough and there's a lot of things that
[47:36] I think that we can we come to consensus
[47:39] at different times in our life where it
[47:43] there's a declaration it can be in
[47:45] things in the natural and the spiritual
[47:48] where there's a declaration that rises
[47:51] and says long enough
[47:53] long enough now nobody else can say that
[47:56] has to be a declaration that comes in
[47:58] our heart
[47:59] but I want to hear just to open up with
[48:03] where this is at in the book of a
[48:05] Deuteronomy and if you will go to go
[48:08] back to Deuteronomy chapter 1 and
[48:11] here is a is a preparation for the
[48:13] people to go into the land of promise
[48:15] and Deuteronomy 1 and verse 2 it says
[48:18] there are 11 days journey from Horeb by
[48:21] the way of Mount Sayer unto kadish
[48:23] barnian I want you to remember this is
[48:26] how close they were when they came out
[48:29] from Egypt and when they came to Horeb
[48:33] they were only a few days journey to get
[48:37] where they needed to get to
[48:39] so there it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't
[48:41] going to be it wasn't like it was going
[48:43] to be oh this is a long way this is a
[48:45] long before this no it was only a few
[48:48] days
[48:49] but what made the difference between a
[48:52] few days and years
[48:55] was their choices
[48:58] are you hearing me it was their
[49:00] decisions it wasn't God it was their
[49:03] decisions
[49:05] so here it says in verse 3 it came to
[49:08] pass in the 40th year in the 11th month
[49:13] on the first day of the month
[49:15] that Moses spake unto the children of
[49:17] Israel I find it fitting it's the month
[49:19] of February
[49:21] according unto all that the Lord hath
[49:23] given him in commandment unto them
[49:26] after he had slain Zion the king of the
[49:29] amorites which dwelt in heshbon and OG
[49:32] the king of Bashan which dwelt at
[49:34] asteroth in edree on this side Jordan in
[49:38] the land of Moab began Moses to declare
[49:41] this law saying now here what you find
[49:45] is Moses is rehearsing to them what has
[49:49] taken place and the defeating there as
[49:52] it's mentioned in verse 4 of Scion and
[49:55] OG these are two kings that God brings
[49:59] down before Israel is going to go in the
[50:02] land after the generation that rejected
[50:06] the word of God and the will of God and
[50:08] God awaited for them to die off then God
[50:12] notice what he does to build the faith
[50:14] of the people coming into the land he
[50:18] has them to make an approach to two
[50:21] other kings coming to their land God
[50:24] knowing those kings would read reject
[50:26] their entry into that place but God had
[50:30] that in mind because through that King's
[50:33] rejection then it would invite the grace
[50:35] of God to move that where that king
[50:38] would be dismantled and Israel would
[50:40] take possession there it's the same way
[50:43] with all you see when it comes down to
[50:46] this it's God building our faith for
[50:50] what the moment calls for
[50:53] it's not a pep rally
[50:55] God doesn't pep up his people the word
[50:57] of God stimulates us and stirs our heart
[51:00] for the moment building faith for our
[51:03] life
[51:05] is that right for my life for your life
[51:08] personally so notice Moses begins to
[51:11] rehearse God's full desire and one was
[51:14] God's full desire when God sent Moses
[51:16] down to Egypt he said I've come to bring
[51:19] you out of bondage and in to the land
[51:24] flowing with milk and honey that's
[51:26] Redemption so Redemption has two parts
[51:29] to it coming out of and going into
[51:33] and so now notice in verse 6 the Lord
[51:36] Our God spake unto us in Horeb saying ye
[51:40] have dwelt long enough in this mountain
[51:41] now this is the initial beginning when
[51:44] they came out and here the law is is
[51:46] given at that time and even at that
[51:49] moment God made a declaration when the
[51:51] law was given you've dwelt here long
[51:54] enough in other words it's time to move
[51:57] from here
[51:59] yes amen okay this is back in chapter
[52:01] one now this is where when God is
[52:03] telling us to move he's telling us
[52:05] personally what to move on
[52:07] is that right
[52:09] turn you and take your journey and go to
[52:12] the Mount of the amrise because remember
[52:14] this gospel is personal
[52:17] it's God telling you not God telling you
[52:19] from me but God's telling you God tells
[52:22] me it's personal I walk with God is a
[52:26] personal walk
[52:28] turn you and take your journey and go to
[52:31] the Mount of the amorites and unto all
[52:33] the places neither unto in the plane in
[52:37] the hills and in the veil and in the
[52:39] South and by the seaside to the land of
[52:42] the Canaanites and unto Lebanon and unto
[52:44] the Great River the river Euphrates and
[52:47] behold I have set the land before you go
[52:50] in and possess the land which the Lord
[52:52] swear unto your fathers Abraham Isaac
[52:55] and Jacob to give unto them and to their
[52:58] seed after them now Moses goes and he
[53:00] rehearses the rejection that's what he's
[53:03] that's what he's rehearsing right now is
[53:05] when they left Horeb yet they came face
[53:08] to face with the promise and they
[53:11] doubted God's ability to keep his word
[53:16] and really what was what they doubted
[53:18] let me just say this when you doubt
[53:20] God's word you're questioning his love
[53:25] are you hearing me because that that's
[53:27] what the reason his word came it's his
[53:30] love God so loved the world is that
[53:33] right God is love and so remember Jesus
[53:37] himself was the very expression of God's
[53:40] heart when the fall came in the
[53:42] beginning and here that Pillar of Fire
[53:44] came down and how brother Ram dramatizes
[53:46] it he came over and he spelled out
[53:49] l-o-v-e when there was no way back yet
[53:53] God stepped in at that time and said I
[53:57] will make a way back for you
[54:01] you know the promise of that seed that's
[54:03] to come so now here they are at Mount
[54:06] seer in verse 1 of Deuteronomy 2 then we
[54:10] turned now this is after the rejection
[54:12] and took our journey into the Wilderness
[54:15] by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord
[54:18] spake unto me I want you to catch this
[54:20] for a minute I wonder how many times
[54:22] they walked by the Red Sea and they
[54:24] could rehearse yeah we remember this and
[54:26] we remember this and they remember this
[54:28] but they weren't going on with God
[54:33] good it was only rehearsal of
[54:36] testimonies of what God had done
[54:39] but he is the I am
[54:43] sure he's the I was and he is that he
[54:46] shall be but he is the I am and what's
[54:48] important in our experience with God is
[54:52] that it must be the experience of the I
[54:55] am right now in our lives
[55:00] it doesn't matter what you were even
[55:02] last month what are you today
[55:04] all right well I remember you know last
[55:06] year no what are you today
[55:11] are you hearing me
[55:13] now verse two it comes into our text and
[55:17] the Lord spake unto me saying now this
[55:20] is a declaration for this moment for
[55:22] this new generation you have compassed
[55:24] this mountain long enough
[55:29] turn you northward
[55:30] in other words it's time it's time to
[55:33] move
[55:34] it's time it's time to start making the
[55:36] same old tracks it's time to go on
[55:38] command thou the people saying you know
[55:41] listen I want you to catch this now
[55:42] verse 4 and I'm going to read verse 4
[55:45] through verse 7 and I want you to notice
[55:47] the direction that the spirit of the
[55:50] Lord is given them
[55:52] command the people saying ye are to pass
[55:55] through the coast of your brethren the
[55:58] children of Esau which dwelt in Seer and
[56:01] they shall be afraid of you take your
[56:04] heed unto yourselves therefore and
[56:06] meddle not with them
[56:08] for I will not give you of their land no
[56:11] not so much as a foot breath because I
[56:13] have given mounts here unto Esau for a
[56:16] possession you shall buy meat of them
[56:18] for money you may that you may eat you
[56:21] shall also buy water of them for money
[56:23] that you may drink for the Lord thy God
[56:26] hath blessed thee in all the works of
[56:28] thy hand for he knoweth thy walking
[56:31] through this Great Wilderness these 40
[56:33] years the Lord thy God has been with
[56:36] thee and thou has lacked nothing
[56:40] foreign
[56:42] why am I still here you're here because
[56:45] it's long enough it's time to move
[56:48] [Music]
[56:50] that's why God has kept you alive God
[56:53] has kept you you may have went around
[56:55] the same Mountain over and over but now
[56:57] is the moment and God has kept you for
[57:00] this moment it's long enough it's time
[57:03] to go over
[57:07] Glory
[57:10] I want to just say it like this I want
[57:12] to just I'm going to just lay some
[57:14] things that I know I could preach it but
[57:16] I want to just lay some things in here
[57:18] this morning and
[57:21] and I want to say it in this way
[57:24] this message that God sent to us
[57:27] is not just another move
[57:33] this is not another move this is not a
[57:35] well Moody had this and they were all
[57:37] men of God
[57:38] and those were not just movements those
[57:40] were men of God inspired for the moment
[57:42] and the season they were in
[57:44] but this message that God has sent to us
[57:46] I want you to understand when God had
[57:49] seven stars in the right hand there were
[57:52] many other Ministries throughout the
[57:54] Gentile ages but God had a messenger for
[57:57] each age and that messenger would be one
[58:00] that was calling the people back to the
[58:04] Redemptive rights
[58:06] as a son and daughter of God that they
[58:09] could have a real possession in Jesus
[58:12] Christ
[58:14] because Satan has always been there to
[58:17] try to warp it and try to you know water
[58:20] it down but God comes in his power and
[58:24] His glory through every Ministry of
[58:27] those Seven Stars they reflect the same
[58:30] power and Glory from him who is the
[58:34] mighty conqueror
[58:35] are you hearing me those seven stars are
[58:38] in the right hand they are reflecting
[58:40] the light from a seated one one who has
[58:43] set down one who is the Conqueror one
[58:47] who is standing who is sitting there and
[58:49] it is a declaration that I have overcome
[58:52] it all
[58:58] let me tell you this let me just say
[59:00] this clearly but put the devil on notice
[59:01] there's nothing the devil has in this
[59:04] age that's a match to God
[59:07] [Applause]
[59:09] every age when they when the enemy
[59:13] wanted to come in a manner and come
[59:15] against the word God's word was more
[59:18] than a match not just a match not just
[59:20] equal he's more than enough
[59:29] so we can we rest upon this part of it
[59:32] we're not the we God never called us
[59:34] together
[59:35] around this message just to Fellowship
[59:38] around it
[59:39] but get into it
[59:43] all right
[59:44] notice brother Brown says it like this
[59:46] in the token I'm just going to read for
[59:47] a few places in two of the token
[59:50] messages it was not just to get together
[59:52] and talk about it all then all the Jews
[59:55] come together and say I'll tell you what
[59:57] I'll tell you fellas you know I believe
[59:59] that Moses is right because look we see
[1:00:02] God identifying himself with Moses
[1:00:05] because we see that Pillar of Fire we
[1:00:08] know what happens we know all the
[1:00:10] identifications that God has given Moses
[1:00:13] it's right you know he said we got to
[1:00:16] have the blood on the door I believe
[1:00:18] that
[1:00:20] but
[1:00:22] sometimes that word is okay and there's
[1:00:25] other times it's just laying up for an
[1:00:28] excuse to follow behind it
[1:00:31] I'll take it when it says we who were
[1:00:33] dead in sins and trespass but God who is
[1:00:36] rich in Mercy I'll take you there
[1:00:39] anybody else want to come join in with
[1:00:41] that and say look I don't want to use it
[1:00:43] when it's leading to an excuse when the
[1:00:45] word speak into my life because I'm here
[1:00:48] this morning to receive the word for my
[1:00:50] own life
[1:00:52] we got to have the blood on the door I
[1:00:55] believe that but you know after all I
[1:00:57] believe I'm just as good as anybody I'm
[1:01:00] really a covenant Jew I've been
[1:01:02] circumcised and I pay my offerings and
[1:01:05] tithes into the congregation why even
[1:01:07] the priest I ate dinner with him well
[1:01:10] I'm just as good a man as the rest of
[1:01:12] you are
[1:01:13] that isn't what happened
[1:01:15] we're not to come together to talk about
[1:01:17] the message we are come together to get
[1:01:20] in the message
[1:01:22] and the message is Christ
[1:01:25] he is the word
[1:01:28] to get into it get beneath it yes sir
[1:01:32] that's what we're supposed to do
[1:01:35] so it's a place so the message is not a
[1:01:38] collection of Doctrine and teaching it
[1:01:41] is the person of Jesus Christ being
[1:01:44] revealed
[1:01:45] when they stood there on the day of
[1:01:47] Pentecost what was it it was the person
[1:01:50] of Jesus Christ that same son of man was
[1:01:53] veiled now in their flesh and it was in
[1:01:56] effect when they spoke those words it
[1:01:59] caused conviction to strike the heart
[1:02:01] and said what must we do to Veil that
[1:02:04] same presence
[1:02:05] [Applause]
[1:02:07] it was the son of man being revealed in
[1:02:11] his Redemptive work declaring that I am
[1:02:13] an overcomer
[1:02:15] so the message is Christ it is the word
[1:02:18] and we're to get beneath it
[1:02:21] now the name goes on to say
[1:02:24] just to believe it is not enough
[1:02:30] to walk around where it's at
[1:02:33] isn't enough
[1:02:36] that's to make yourself worse
[1:02:39] yeah
[1:02:40] see not even to be around where it's at
[1:02:43] it makes yourself worse
[1:02:45] if notice for he that knoweth to do good
[1:02:49] and doeth it not to him it's sin
[1:02:52] borderline Believers Jesus spoke of the
[1:02:55] same thing
[1:02:56] now you can remember in the message how
[1:03:00] can I overcome
[1:03:01] and I thought of this as I was looking
[1:03:02] over this quote
[1:03:04] remember brother Ram talks about when he
[1:03:06] where he got he had heard another
[1:03:08] brother preaching on that of overcoming
[1:03:10] it and then the Holy Spirit began to
[1:03:11] deal with him and he began to open and
[1:03:13] hear for this age and bring it down you
[1:03:16] know bring it break it forth out of
[1:03:17] Prophecy and and bring it down he talks
[1:03:19] about how when he was walking across the
[1:03:21] Stream
[1:03:22] and he said I was walking across the
[1:03:24] stream and and there was this log that
[1:03:27] was going across the stream and he said
[1:03:30] when I went to go across that log he
[1:03:32] said what happened to me when I went
[1:03:34] across it I jumped on that log and a
[1:03:37] great big chunk of it fell off
[1:03:42] now I want you to think of this
[1:03:44] trees need water is that right
[1:03:47] but it depends if you're positioned in
[1:03:49] it or not
[1:03:51] just to lay in it you'll rot
[1:03:55] are you hearing me now and that's why
[1:03:57] I'm doing the band would bring it down
[1:03:58] he said that's the way so many
[1:04:00] Christians have become they can't take
[1:04:02] anything it's like a chunk falls off a
[1:04:05] Chuck falls off a chunk falls off
[1:04:07] because they've been dead in sin and
[1:04:10] trespasses so long I say long enough
[1:04:15] so they can't hold no weight can't hold
[1:04:17] no pressure but you see the tree itself
[1:04:20] this is why when brother Brown would say
[1:04:22] we as Christians real with as being a
[1:04:25] Christian we are to keep life in us I'm
[1:04:28] just referring to this place and he said
[1:04:30] if we're following the message of the
[1:04:32] hour at least this part of the message
[1:04:35] We should strive to live constantly in
[1:04:40] the Life of Christ
[1:04:44] are you hearing me
[1:04:47] amen living constantly in his life
[1:04:51] that's overcoming don't don't just lay
[1:04:53] around we want to move within that word
[1:04:56] I just say it like this you see when we
[1:04:59] read that there in the scriptures for
[1:05:01] our text we think about that where we
[1:05:04] are standing that we realize it's not
[1:05:07] enough just to be around it but we've
[1:05:09] got to get beneath it
[1:05:11] amen we've got to get beneath it and I'd
[1:05:13] just saying like this is there a desire
[1:05:15] in your heart
[1:05:17] to press on
[1:05:19] over the center I know about sister son
[1:05:21] I ain't talking about sister so and so
[1:05:24] I'm talking about you
[1:05:26] God never sent you to look over for
[1:05:28] somebody else I'm talking about you
[1:05:31] we don't come to church to shovel it and
[1:05:33] Pitchfork it on nobody else I'm talking
[1:05:35] about you I'm talking about me
[1:05:39] hello somebody
[1:05:40] is there a desire that moves in our
[1:05:44] heart to press on
[1:05:47] Hallelujah because there should be a
[1:05:50] pulsation that rises in our hearts that
[1:05:52] says long enough
[1:05:54] now you can fill that in for whatever it
[1:05:57] is in your life
[1:05:59] long enough
[1:06:02] Hallelujah now notice Matthew 11 12 from
[1:06:05] the days of John the Baptist until now
[1:06:07] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[1:06:12] and the violent take it by force
[1:06:16] let me tell you something Satan is no
[1:06:18] kitty cat that just is walking around
[1:06:20] like a powder puff
[1:06:22] he's in a challenge every every word of
[1:06:27] God he'll challenge every word that you
[1:06:29] say I believe that he'll challenge it
[1:06:31] and to see do you really believe it or
[1:06:33] not
[1:06:35] are you hearing me now you see this the
[1:06:38] kingdom of God is not something that is
[1:06:40] just handed to us but if it really means
[1:06:43] something to you you're going to have to
[1:06:45] fight for it
[1:06:47] come on now
[1:06:49] it ain't something that's just handed
[1:06:51] out but it's something you've got to
[1:06:53] fight for and you're not fighting
[1:06:55] against God it's fighting against our
[1:06:57] own will
[1:06:59] and sometimes our own will like I read
[1:07:01] in those quotes I'm okay I'm just as
[1:07:04] good or this is okay and listen I'm not
[1:07:07] only talking about the New Birth I'm
[1:07:09] talking also about things sometimes that
[1:07:11] we have allowed to remain in our life
[1:07:13] allowed to remain in our families we've
[1:07:16] went around mountains in Cycles over and
[1:07:19] over and over again
[1:07:23] are you hearing me friends or we go
[1:07:26] around and make up that we cut off then
[1:07:27] we make it's time to break the Cycles I
[1:07:30] said it's time to say it's long enough
[1:07:36] flesh and blood is not your enemy it's
[1:07:39] the devil
[1:07:42] and the violent take it by force
[1:07:46] God said I've given you the lamb but
[1:07:48] you're gonna have to fight for every
[1:07:49] inch of it
[1:07:53] I want you to listen to this
[1:07:55] this is as I was with Moses you hear me
[1:07:57] quote this many times over the years
[1:08:00] when I've ministered but I'm going to
[1:08:01] read it today
[1:08:02] as I was with Moses
[1:08:05] but REM says
[1:08:07] or how can you try to make all the
[1:08:09] lutherans see it
[1:08:10] all the Baptists see it
[1:08:13] all the Presbyterians nazarenes and
[1:08:15] Pilgrim Holiness don't condemn them
[1:08:18] that's all they know
[1:08:20] that's all that's in them
[1:08:23] we don't so we're not trying no notice
[1:08:26] but to you who believe now see this is
[1:08:28] where the message is addressing to you
[1:08:30] who believe
[1:08:32] to you who know to you that's got
[1:08:34] something in you that's calling to the
[1:08:36] Deep if all the Deep you've got's been
[1:08:39] satisfied
[1:08:40] then stay where you are
[1:08:44] if you're saddest
[1:08:46] sad to say where you're at
[1:08:47] but as for me I'm going on
[1:08:50] it may not be comfortable for you
[1:08:53] but I'm going to go on
[1:08:56] I'll say like this as for me in my house
[1:08:59] as for me and the church the group of
[1:09:01] people that God has given me Grace to
[1:09:03] stand as Pastor we're going to go on
[1:09:07] Hallelujah not walking around mountains
[1:09:10] come on Friends
[1:09:11] [Applause]
[1:09:14] you know how it is when brother Brandon
[1:09:15] was walking around that on that day they
[1:09:17] called it but then said the Indians call
[1:09:19] it a death march Brother Brad was
[1:09:20] thinking man I got this figured out I'm
[1:09:22] a you're a good guy William Branham
[1:09:24] you're a good guy you can figure it out
[1:09:25] and brother Brown realized after so long
[1:09:27] the time he kept seeing that deer
[1:09:29] hanging in the tree
[1:09:31] what was it he was walking the same old
[1:09:34] pathway
[1:09:36] and getting nowhere
[1:09:39] but finally when he humbled himself and
[1:09:41] said God
[1:09:43] I'm lost
[1:09:46] oh can we preacher now
[1:09:49] brother Branham he liked us that not
[1:09:51] only to a person spiritually lost but
[1:09:54] right here this morning there might be
[1:09:55] something that here you are you're
[1:09:57] setting and your life everything you say
[1:09:59] I know in my life in whom I have
[1:10:01] believed but God I need a way out of
[1:10:04] this
[1:10:05] I need the clouds to break back and the
[1:10:08] lifeline
[1:10:14] but as for me and my house
[1:10:16] for me there's something more than what
[1:10:18] he sees so the person who's who's who's
[1:10:21] just staying content I want to ask you
[1:10:24] what do you think that looks like
[1:10:26] I feel like I'm preaching in my heart
[1:10:27] and bible study in my living room with
[1:10:30] my young people
[1:10:31] what does that look like for a person
[1:10:33] sister Brandon go up to that go go up
[1:10:36] one that's right there says if all the
[1:10:39] Deep you've got's been satisfied then
[1:10:41] stay where you are what's that look like
[1:10:45] what's it look like when a person a
[1:10:47] person I ain't satisfied but what does
[1:10:49] it look like you see we can say things
[1:10:52] and sometimes we can become so
[1:10:54] accustomed to saying the right thing and
[1:10:57] yet
[1:10:58] we don't really mean it
[1:11:00] we're just saying what we know is the
[1:11:02] right thing to say
[1:11:05] what does that look like
[1:11:08] to be satisfied it shows in our walk
[1:11:11] with God I'm satisfied I've got it made
[1:11:19] amen amen amen help me Jesus
[1:11:24] Oh Ma I'm glad the word comes to search
[1:11:26] us out I'm talking about searching you
[1:11:28] searching me out
[1:11:32] are you hearing me
[1:11:34] I don't believe in getting together I
[1:11:35] don't believe in getting together and
[1:11:36] say well you know brother so-and-so or
[1:11:38] sister so and so no sir the word is for
[1:11:41] us personally
[1:11:42] [Applause]
[1:11:45] he's doing the work
[1:11:47] but for me and my house oh what a
[1:11:49] declaration for me there's something
[1:11:51] more than what he sees there's a land
[1:11:53] beyond the river somewhere there's still
[1:11:55] a deep calling to the deep I cannot be
[1:11:58] satisfied with theology I cannot be
[1:12:01] satisfied with a good church I cannot be
[1:12:04] satisfied with a good campaign I cannot
[1:12:07] be satisfied with a little healing
[1:12:09] service there's something beyond that
[1:12:11] that's calling
[1:12:16] there's a d that's calling out
[1:12:21] [Applause]
[1:12:23] I said I do
[1:12:25] I just Health to be perfect
[1:12:27] but I'm reaching
[1:12:29] reaching I'm reaching
[1:12:33] I'm pressing on
[1:12:36] anything you got to press again it's
[1:12:37] because everything is coming against you
[1:12:40] but you've got to press on I'm talking
[1:12:42] about the world
[1:12:43] some of the things we've got to press
[1:12:45] through as our own will our own feelings
[1:12:48] our own faults come on somebody it's
[1:12:51] pressing through that
[1:12:54] Bram said so here's what you do
[1:12:57] if they're content with that just let
[1:13:00] them alone
[1:13:01] remember what he said about no matter
[1:13:03] with Edom
[1:13:05] just let them alone go on through don't
[1:13:08] argue with them but we're passing to
[1:13:10] another land
[1:13:11] they wasn't ordained to go with you they
[1:13:14] won't walk with you see how can two walk
[1:13:16] unless they be agreed but to those who
[1:13:19] love God
[1:13:20] to those who are called of God well they
[1:13:23] say well God give us this church God did
[1:13:25] this that's right
[1:13:26] God said I give East on this mountain
[1:13:28] don't touch him I've got something
[1:13:30] different for you cross over
[1:13:32] that's my desire Brethren to see my
[1:13:36] church cross over into another land a
[1:13:39] desire to move over to the other side
[1:13:42] I'm going to tell you that's my desire
[1:13:45] my desire is not just to see people in
[1:13:47] church
[1:13:49] I believe you ought to come to the
[1:13:50] Church of the house of God and if you've
[1:13:52] got the love of God in your heart you'll
[1:13:54] press through to be in his presence
[1:13:57] it's the word of God forsake not to
[1:13:59] assemble yourselves together if you got
[1:14:01] the love of God in your heart you can't
[1:14:03] wait for those Church doors to open
[1:14:06] we can go on and on with him but
[1:14:08] remember there's something greater it's
[1:14:10] something more there is a land there is
[1:14:14] something that belongs to you if you're
[1:14:16] very you're satisfied where you're at it
[1:14:18] won't matter how much the preaching goes
[1:14:20] it wouldn't matter what anything does
[1:14:22] you'll stay right there but there are
[1:14:25] lies that are Desiring to say Lord I
[1:14:28] want a deeper walk there's something
[1:14:30] staring within me there's a pulsation
[1:14:33] that says long enough
[1:14:36] [Applause]
[1:14:40] [Music]
[1:14:45] oh my mama if there's something in you
[1:14:49] here first calling notice in you it's
[1:14:51] calling out it's a signal
[1:14:54] calling out there'll be something to
[1:14:56] respond to that call just settling down
[1:14:58] I want you to watch this just settling
[1:15:01] down to sheep raising ain't enough for
[1:15:03] you
[1:15:04] go into some sort of business is not
[1:15:07] enough for you just to join the church
[1:15:09] and put your name on the book not enough
[1:15:11] for you because there's something
[1:15:13] calling all across the ridge Yonder
[1:15:15] across the next Ridge and across Jordan
[1:15:18] until you fall into the arms of the
[1:15:21] Living God Yonder
[1:15:25] gotta home over younger
[1:15:29] got about
[1:15:30] Over Yonder
[1:15:31] hey man I've got a theophany about it
[1:15:34] that is reserved in the heavens
[1:15:37] amen I I have a garment that I am
[1:15:40] Desiring to be clothed upon because this
[1:15:43] spirit this flesh it is not a fitting
[1:15:46] Tabernacle for a Son of God but God said
[1:15:49] it's not your inheritance but I gave it
[1:15:51] to you for a possession I manifest my
[1:15:54] glory through your through your human
[1:15:56] Spirit through the flesh I'll manifest
[1:15:59] my glory through you and it will be a
[1:16:02] longing for that other side
[1:16:06] longing for more of him
[1:16:08] I want you to catch this just going into
[1:16:11] sheep raising ain't enough for you
[1:16:15] you realize that there was
[1:16:17] two of the tribes
[1:16:19] that they settled
[1:16:21] and they didn't go over Jordan
[1:16:24] there's a few of them tribes that didn't
[1:16:25] go over
[1:16:26] right
[1:16:27] now let me remind you about one of those
[1:16:29] tribes what happened to him one of them
[1:16:31] tribes was a tribe of God
[1:16:33] and remember you're you're well aware
[1:16:35] when Jesus came on the scene there was a
[1:16:38] man we know as the maniac of gadera
[1:16:42] yeah I'm gonna tell you the result of
[1:16:45] that right there is that when Jesus came
[1:16:47] and brought Deliverance to that man that
[1:16:49] that particular group of people did not
[1:16:52] want a Revival
[1:16:55] come on friends they didn't want a real
[1:16:58] Revival I'll tell you what a real
[1:16:59] Revival is a real Revival ain't just
[1:17:02] singing a real Revival is real
[1:17:04] repentance with men and women that are
[1:17:06] getting rack and being brought back to
[1:17:07] the path of God's holy word
[1:17:10] come on now Church
[1:17:12] hey man it's more it's a word it takes a
[1:17:14] wire to bring a Revival the spirit of
[1:17:17] the Living God to move down in lies
[1:17:21] so settling down just for sheep reason
[1:17:23] ain't enough you see what you find here
[1:17:25] is Satan is such a slew foot he'll do
[1:17:29] anything
[1:17:31] to try to get your Zeal channeled
[1:17:34] elsewhere
[1:17:36] he can get your Zeal you say well the
[1:17:39] same how can he get my Zeal he can get
[1:17:40] your Zeal what God's Desiring the
[1:17:43] prophet said you let so many other
[1:17:44] things take it out of you what God's
[1:17:46] wanting to reveal to you God stirs up
[1:17:49] the heart God's moving your life but you
[1:17:51] let so many other things and some of the
[1:17:53] things that he said he wasn't even
[1:17:55] saying in that quote movies and other
[1:17:57] things he said you'd let family
[1:18:00] we got quiet now
[1:18:03] but something like so many other things
[1:18:04] take it out of us
[1:18:07] when God's stirring up the Zeal it's not
[1:18:10] for anything else but for more of him
[1:18:12] because how can I really stand correctly
[1:18:15] for my family if I'm not putting God
[1:18:17] first
[1:18:19] I can't do that it must be God first and
[1:18:22] then God orders everything else settling
[1:18:24] down just a sheep breezing ain't enough
[1:18:26] for us
[1:18:27] amen we want to go forward in the things
[1:18:30] of God this is why the Bible said if we
[1:18:32] walk in the light as he's in the light
[1:18:35] oh I love that we have Fellowship one
[1:18:38] with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:18:40] Christ his son cleanseth us from all
[1:18:43] sins amen
[1:18:44] amen amen I want to keep walking with
[1:18:45] him I want this word to keep moving keep
[1:18:48] working in my life keep changing me from
[1:18:50] glory and to Glory
[1:18:52] hallelujah thank God for the job he gave
[1:18:54] me but God gave me that job and God did
[1:18:57] not require me hey buddy you keep it
[1:18:59] open God gave me the job and if the
[1:19:01] doors closed God's got another place for
[1:19:03] me
[1:19:05] somebody
[1:19:07] you didn't build the factory you didn't
[1:19:09] build the hospital somebody else built
[1:19:11] that and the reason was there because
[1:19:13] God was going to provide for himself he
[1:19:15] was going to provide for your needs so
[1:19:18] what is it it's letting God be first and
[1:19:20] everything else second
[1:19:23] hello somebody we're made we should be
[1:19:26] releasing the Zeal in the right place if
[1:19:29] we don't release it in the right place
[1:19:31] it'll be around the mountain
[1:19:35] see there's things that God brings us to
[1:19:37] in his grace for us to overcome
[1:19:41] which way should we as the Church of the
[1:19:44] Living God which way should we always be
[1:19:46] going
[1:19:47] somebody say it again
[1:19:49] forward
[1:19:51] never backwards
[1:19:53] never retreat
[1:19:55] never sideways
[1:19:58] amen when you read of how the spirit of
[1:20:00] God moves in the living creatures it's
[1:20:02] always moving forward
[1:20:04] see the spirit of God will never take
[1:20:06] you backwards
[1:20:09] are you hearing me now well I'm feeling
[1:20:11] Latin no the spirit of God don't lead
[1:20:13] somebody backwards
[1:20:15] the spirit of God to the believer leads
[1:20:19] us onward
[1:20:21] always going forward notice in Jesus
[1:20:24] Christ the same 1955. brother said don't
[1:20:27] be satisfied with your fire built here
[1:20:30] from last night let's build it a little
[1:20:33] further up the road tonight
[1:20:35] never build it in the same place you
[1:20:38] can't stand still
[1:20:41] you're either somebody read this with me
[1:20:44] you're either backsliding or going
[1:20:47] forward
[1:20:49] it's one or the other
[1:20:51] it can't be both ways at the same time
[1:20:53] it's either one or the other now Hebrews
[1:20:55] 6 verse 1 therefore leaving the
[1:20:57] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[1:21:00] us go on unto Perfection not laying
[1:21:04] again the foundation of repentance from
[1:21:06] dead works and of Faith toward God
[1:21:11] of the doctrine of baptisms and of
[1:21:13] laying on of hands and of resurrection
[1:21:15] of the dead and of Eternal judgment and
[1:21:18] this will we do if God permit
[1:21:20] so Paul the burden that Paul is is
[1:21:23] expressing is the same thing that God
[1:21:26] has said to that of Israel in that time
[1:21:29] you've dwelt here long enough
[1:21:32] it's time to move on now all the all the
[1:21:34] principles of the doctrine of Christ
[1:21:36] every one of those things are absolutely
[1:21:38] necessary repentance all of those things
[1:21:41] sanctification every single doctrine of
[1:21:43] Christ baptism laying on of hands all
[1:21:46] those things are essential but all of
[1:21:48] that is a beginning for us and calling
[1:21:52] us and directing us to go on to
[1:21:54] Perfection and Perfection is where
[1:21:56] Christ's life is reproduced in US
[1:22:01] right see it's got to come to a spot to
[1:22:03] where in our lives when we look at
[1:22:06] certain things you've got to go beyond
[1:22:08] repetitive Cycles
[1:22:13] say brother Samuel what do you mean by
[1:22:15] repetitive Cycles well you see this is
[1:22:18] when God encourages us he doesn't
[1:22:19] condemn us he comes to encourage us it
[1:22:22] comes to let us know
[1:22:23] we're living beneath our privileges
[1:22:25] don't just be content let me bring it
[1:22:27] down like this don't just be content
[1:22:29] with continually asking forgiveness for
[1:22:32] the same old thing
[1:22:35] are you hearing me now
[1:22:37] you see God forgives us and the thing of
[1:22:39] it is you can fill a release you can
[1:22:41] fill because you know what the lamb he
[1:22:44] has already bore he paid for the sins
[1:22:46] past present and future
[1:22:49] but you see it comes to a spot to where
[1:22:51] and that's not something that anybody
[1:22:53] else can make that up for you or for me
[1:22:55] it has to come to that place to say this
[1:22:58] is long enough
[1:22:59] this cycle is stopping
[1:23:03] it's enough with the cycle going around
[1:23:05] the mountain the same Mountain because
[1:23:07] you almost begin to know the same
[1:23:09] pathway and the same treads and we know
[1:23:11] everything but it's long enough
[1:23:13] right Amen brother Brown says it like
[1:23:16] this and I think I have this quote on
[1:23:17] here for the sound of the message
[1:23:18] Paradox and I want you to think about
[1:23:20] where we are at here in this moment in
[1:23:23] this hour
[1:23:24] brother bran speaks of how that the Holy
[1:23:26] Spirit here had woke him up and you say
[1:23:29] he talks about it with three o'clock in
[1:23:30] the morning and he said I had gotten up
[1:23:32] and I looked where in front of me and I
[1:23:34] was coming down to the Jordan it looked
[1:23:36] like I was standing on the map of
[1:23:38] Palestine and I was coming down to the
[1:23:40] Jordan
[1:23:41] and it seemed like I could hear the song
[1:23:43] I'm going down to the down to the Jordan
[1:23:46] someone was singing it and as I drew
[1:23:48] near the river I looked back and seen
[1:23:51] which away I had come and I was
[1:23:53] two-thirds of the way there to the
[1:23:57] Jordan first pool second pool
[1:24:00] I was two-thirds of the way to the
[1:24:03] Jordan
[1:24:03] right justification sanctification I was
[1:24:06] two-thirds of the way and I looked
[1:24:08] across Jordan and I said oh praise God
[1:24:11] just on the other side is where all the
[1:24:15] promises lay every promise lays in the
[1:24:19] Promised Land
[1:24:22] so look in the cross and seeing every
[1:24:25] promise lays there my inheritance lays
[1:24:27] there you see it has meaning that is for
[1:24:31] me
[1:24:33] now I want you to think but the brand
[1:24:35] would speak of it like this when the
[1:24:38] spirit of the Lord would have him to
[1:24:40] pick up his pen and write and he talked
[1:24:42] about seeing the promises coming into
[1:24:44] view here
[1:24:46] in 1962 in March and he speaks to you
[1:24:49] and I and he says let us stand like
[1:24:53] Joshua and Caleb
[1:24:56] well how did Joshua and Caleb stand
[1:24:59] they stood on the word of God
[1:25:04] there was a lot of pressures around them
[1:25:06] is
[1:25:07] they weren't they they were outnumbered
[1:25:12] but they stood on God's word
[1:25:16] against what all the odds look like they
[1:25:19] stood on God's word
[1:25:21] so I'll say to you right now that you
[1:25:23] know let me just go back because I think
[1:25:25] of it right now you might look and say
[1:25:27] well I've had to repent of this and
[1:25:28] repent of this but remember just sat on
[1:25:30] your heart right now long enough
[1:25:33] stand right now long enough
[1:25:36] it's long enough I'm not this is not
[1:25:39] going to go on this isn't trying to
[1:25:41] psych you up it is the authority of
[1:25:43] God's word by his Spirit just say it's
[1:25:46] long enough
[1:25:46] [Applause]
[1:25:48] because God's not here condemning you
[1:25:50] because you couldn't even lift your head
[1:25:52] up he's here to remind you you don't
[1:25:54] have to keep walking around the same
[1:25:56] Mountain
[1:25:57] [Music]
[1:25:59] come on church I preach unto every one
[1:26:02] of us even in our own character
[1:26:05] come on now oh brother Sammy you know my
[1:26:09] daddy was like this my mama was like
[1:26:11] this what tree are you of anyhow are you
[1:26:14] up there you're still bragging on the
[1:26:15] first birth or have you been grafted and
[1:26:18] birth into that tree of life
[1:26:21] come on Friends anybody can make excuses
[1:26:25] when it's convenient but when it comes
[1:26:27] down to push and shut will we stand on
[1:26:30] God's word
[1:26:31] come on now it's time to draw a line or
[1:26:34] I've acted like this all my life when
[1:26:37] something came up I acted like this all
[1:26:39] my life it's time to say let there be
[1:26:41] another action come in my life
[1:26:46] come on now it's convenient to brag on
[1:26:50] all the whole first birth oh but let us
[1:26:54] come to that new birth let's brag on the
[1:26:57] tree of life let's make our boast in the
[1:26:59] Lord
[1:27:00] [Applause]
[1:27:08] I don't discount nobody's story but I
[1:27:10] want you to understand
[1:27:11] that your story
[1:27:13] is not greater than the blood of Jesus
[1:27:15] Christ
[1:27:15] [Music]
[1:27:20] Hallelujah no Sympathy for the Devil
[1:27:25] are you hearing me
[1:27:29] you give that guy a little bit it's just
[1:27:31] like what the Palestinians are doing
[1:27:32] over there right now
[1:27:34] you give them a little bit and a little
[1:27:35] bit a little bit they'll build on top of
[1:27:37] one another
[1:27:40] but they're on
[1:27:41] land that don't belong to him
[1:27:47] come on now
[1:27:49] let's look down in our life is there
[1:27:51] something in our life where there's some
[1:27:52] Palestinians at that don't belong there
[1:27:58] oh brother Samuel That Couldn't meal
[1:28:00] Holy Spirit said give no place to the
[1:28:02] devil pulling down strong holds
[1:28:06] long enough
[1:28:09] you dwelt on the West Bank of my life
[1:28:11] long enough
[1:28:14] come on now
[1:28:17] brother Samuel what do you do well I'll
[1:28:19] tell you what we're not the devil's
[1:28:21] punching bag
[1:28:23] [Applause]
[1:28:25] it's time to take the the battle to the
[1:28:27] enemy's Camp it's long enough
[1:28:29] we've got to go possess the land
[1:28:33] now look at this God didn't move Israel
[1:28:35] until it was God's ordained time
[1:28:38] remember a lot we're moving around with
[1:28:40] Joshua and Joshua come on her brother
[1:28:42] Brian dramatizer come on Joshua come on
[1:28:44] Joshua come on Joshua come on Joshua
[1:28:46] come on Joshua you used to have thus
[1:28:47] saith the Lord and but you see
[1:28:50] Joshua was not moved
[1:28:53] by the persuasion
[1:28:55] of others
[1:28:58] he was one
[1:29:00] that could recognize and he was standing
[1:29:02] on the word of God and brother Brown
[1:29:03] would make this statement here I think
[1:29:04] it's powerful he says he knew to wait
[1:29:07] for a clear-cut decision from God for
[1:29:10] his time
[1:29:12] and when the time was come Joshua knew
[1:29:13] it's time
[1:29:15] it's time he knew this was the moment
[1:29:17] right here this is time it's it's time
[1:29:19] to go so when you think of there's a
[1:29:22] there's a time and a need for a decision
[1:29:26] there's a need for a decision in this
[1:29:28] hour and you know when you make a
[1:29:30] decision because you really can't you
[1:29:32] you can't stay neutral none of us can
[1:29:35] stay neutral remember what we just read
[1:29:37] we're either going forward
[1:29:40] or we're backsliding
[1:29:42] there's no holding in the same place
[1:29:44] we're either getting closer to God or
[1:29:47] further away
[1:29:51] is that right yes so now
[1:29:54] when brother Brandon would make that
[1:29:55] declaration and he would talk about
[1:29:57] Caleb and Joshua and it would be a call
[1:29:59] that there's a need for a man to
[1:30:02] challenge the promise of God for this
[1:30:03] hour I want you to think of this I said
[1:30:05] it's right there in Candace barnia
[1:30:07] paragraph 125 and I want to read that
[1:30:09] what we need in this hour is a man to
[1:30:12] challenge the promise of God before the
[1:30:14] people I want you to catch this
[1:30:16] to challenge the promise of God before
[1:30:18] the people in other words that God would
[1:30:22] manifest himself that he's the same
[1:30:24] yesterday today and forever
[1:30:27] because through that manifestation it'll
[1:30:30] build faith in the children of God that
[1:30:32] no matter what the opposition is it will
[1:30:35] build faith in their hearts to impress
[1:30:37] on into the new birth it'll build bread
[1:30:39] it'll build faith in their hearts that
[1:30:41] there is no opposition no obstacle too
[1:30:44] great for God
[1:30:46] because why theology won't do it but a
[1:30:48] living God making himself manifest in
[1:30:51] this hour it's God listen when God
[1:30:54] veiled himself in the life of the
[1:30:56] Prophet that was God saying I am going
[1:30:59] to Avail myself in the life of my pride
[1:31:04] you're letting you and I know this is
[1:31:06] what your inheritance is is for Christ
[1:31:09] to dwell in you supremely
[1:31:15] oh Jesus help us
[1:31:17] notice God promised the pouring out of
[1:31:20] the Pentecostal blessing in the last
[1:31:21] days I mean a real Pentecostal poor
[1:31:24] house and it's time for it to come
[1:31:26] another kadish barnia has arrived and
[1:31:30] they said you know well we we can do it
[1:31:32] sure sure we can do it
[1:31:34] but you see those cowardly church
[1:31:36] members was looking to what they could
[1:31:38] see with their eyes I tell you your eyes
[1:31:40] will always lie to you
[1:31:47] and they'll always lie to us
[1:31:50] but Caleb and Joshua was looking to
[1:31:53] God's promise
[1:31:55] you know what you go to looking at will
[1:31:57] affect how you act
[1:32:00] I don't care how much opposition they
[1:32:03] had how big the giants look how big the
[1:32:05] fences look they were looking to God's
[1:32:08] promise
[1:32:10] now I want you to watch how Paul says
[1:32:12] this in Galatians 4 19.
[1:32:15] and just stay with me here just a few
[1:32:17] moments
[1:32:18] my little children
[1:32:20] of whom I travail in birth again until
[1:32:25] Christ be formed in you
[1:32:30] now think of that of travailing
[1:32:34] leads in you think of birth pains that
[1:32:37] come along
[1:32:38] you know the preaching of the word when
[1:32:41] the word is being preached it's what
[1:32:44] brings conviction to The Sinner
[1:32:47] now to the heart that don't want to get
[1:32:49] right it's for its condemnation
[1:32:52] but for the heart I'm going to respond
[1:32:54] to it it's conviction it's a way out
[1:32:56] this is my way out are you hearing me
[1:32:59] oh my you see we're living in an age of
[1:33:02] don't judge me don't judge me listen the
[1:33:04] word the word right here is coming forth
[1:33:06] and we need the word to discern the
[1:33:08] thoughts and intents of the heart that
[1:33:10] word discern means judge
[1:33:12] are you hearing me it's the holy spirit
[1:33:15] that brings conviction
[1:33:17] amen so notice of whom I travail in
[1:33:20] birth again until Christ be formed in
[1:33:23] you so Paul here he is laboring with the
[1:33:26] people of God and where they're at in
[1:33:29] their walk with God and to notice that
[1:33:31] you know when there is um you know
[1:33:34] sometimes they'll do things to induce
[1:33:35] labor they'll you know put that little
[1:33:37] drip in there and it it begins to start
[1:33:40] the contractions and starts it moving on
[1:33:42] down and trying to you know bring bring
[1:33:44] it to that place of of a birth and let
[1:33:46] me tell you something the Holy Spirit
[1:33:48] comes and it streams of Grace that's
[1:33:50] moving down that's why the real grace of
[1:33:53] God it comes to bring conviction in our
[1:33:55] life it deals with the person that says
[1:33:58] wow this is wrong this is not right what
[1:34:00] is it it's streams of God's grace to
[1:34:04] deal with our life
[1:34:05] that's what real Grace is Grace isn't
[1:34:08] leaving us in the same condition
[1:34:10] but that grace of God is at streams of
[1:34:13] Grace it flows down until Christ himself
[1:34:18] God's Grace has been fully reproduced in
[1:34:21] our life in other words it becomes Grace
[1:34:23] for Grace the grace that God gives to us
[1:34:26] in Repentance we receive that and we
[1:34:30] walk on and Grace is given for
[1:34:33] sanctification we walk on Grace is given
[1:34:36] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost Grace
[1:34:38] for Grace
[1:34:40] so it's an inter continual unfolding of
[1:34:43] Grace
[1:34:44] let me just say it like this that Grace
[1:34:46] as it's flowing what it does it brings a
[1:34:50] travail in Zion
[1:34:53] and when Zion travaileth the Bible said
[1:34:55] in Isaiah 66 verse 8 in the last part of
[1:34:59] that scripture for as soon as Zion
[1:35:01] travaileth she brought forth her
[1:35:04] children
[1:35:06] you see the streams of Grace it's there
[1:35:08] to bring what a travailing
[1:35:11] amen God dealing with the light here's a
[1:35:14] need for a birth
[1:35:15] there's a need to go on there's a need
[1:35:18] for a real experience what is it the
[1:35:20] spirit of God is bringing travail that's
[1:35:22] why in the services listen even as the
[1:35:24] Church of the Living God you have lives
[1:35:26] that have already crossed over dwelling
[1:35:28] in the land and have a desire and are
[1:35:31] feeding of that inheritance and notice
[1:35:33] the same spirit of God is moving through
[1:35:36] the body to do what travail this holy
[1:35:39] spirit is not coming to strip you down
[1:35:41] he's coming to do what bring travail
[1:35:46] to bring us to a place of dying to
[1:35:49] ourselves
[1:35:51] because by not making a decision you're
[1:35:53] making a decision
[1:35:57] God said in Isaiah 66 9 the first part
[1:36:00] of that one shall I bring to the birth
[1:36:02] and not cause to bring forth
[1:36:05] you see the thing
[1:36:08] we just have to speak plainly
[1:36:14] we can't Dodge the new birth
[1:36:18] there's not another way
[1:36:20] into the inheritance there's not another
[1:36:23] way to Victory
[1:36:25] it's going to come through the new birth
[1:36:26] and it's a mess
[1:36:29] are you hearing me when God starts
[1:36:31] dealing with the light there's things
[1:36:32] there's decisions you have to start
[1:36:34] making
[1:36:35] right
[1:36:36] some of you know what I'm talking about
[1:36:37] there's decisions you've got to start
[1:36:39] making there's things the Holy Spirit
[1:36:41] starts dealing with your life I'm
[1:36:43] letting this go I'm forsaking this who
[1:36:46] is speaking to you to do that and
[1:36:48] equipping you it's the Holy Spirit
[1:36:51] and what is it it's dying out
[1:36:54] it may not happen all at once like this
[1:36:59] are you hearing me
[1:37:00] but it's a dying out
[1:37:03] sometimes I say it in this manner like
[1:37:05] this if I can just elaborate on this the
[1:37:08] experience itself is not a timeline
[1:37:13] it's you surrendering and God taking
[1:37:15] over
[1:37:18] are you hearing me
[1:37:19] because sometimes we can look at things
[1:37:21] and remember here's the thing that's
[1:37:23] always the same The Experience itself as
[1:37:26] far as passing from Death unto life is
[1:37:29] the same experience
[1:37:32] but sometimes
[1:37:34] the timeline and it has nothing with God
[1:37:37] dealing with God holding anything back
[1:37:38] it's just God working personally with
[1:37:41] lives but Samuel what are you saying I'm
[1:37:43] saying this to you do what he tells you
[1:37:46] to do
[1:37:49] and don't ever build your fire on the
[1:37:52] same place you built it the night before
[1:37:54] keep moving on with God
[1:37:58] don't look back don't walk around the
[1:38:00] same Mountain if you build a fire here
[1:38:02] keep on moving for the next time and
[1:38:05] press Holland and look if there's
[1:38:07] something that's in your life right now
[1:38:09] ask God Lord take that out of my life
[1:38:13] that's called dying out take it out of
[1:38:15] my life Lord
[1:38:17] because I don't want to keep walking
[1:38:18] around this mountain I want to go on
[1:38:23] Hallelujah remember brother random
[1:38:25] likened it to a little white button
[1:38:31] a little white button
[1:38:32] as it comes in
[1:38:34] he likened the spirit of God coming into
[1:38:36] a life right
[1:38:38] but notice he comes in and he grows
[1:38:40] brother Brian says the more he has you
[1:38:42] can push out all the malice all the
[1:38:44] hatred all of this right here what's he
[1:38:46] doing he's growing into sanctification
[1:38:49] what is it it's until Christ be formed
[1:38:52] in you
[1:38:53] he's growing he's moving he's pushing
[1:38:56] forth in your life that's why the Holy
[1:38:59] Spirit when he deals with our life it's
[1:39:00] God calling to our hearts it's God
[1:39:03] beckoning to our life
[1:39:08] I'm just going to speak some things here
[1:39:10] we just had a wonderful
[1:39:12] youth meeting there on
[1:39:14] Friday evening and some of the
[1:39:16] testimonies and things are being shared
[1:39:19] sometimes you have
[1:39:21] things where
[1:39:23] there's one individual saying
[1:39:25] you know
[1:39:27] it went to a youth meeting and made a
[1:39:30] determination I'm going to let go of all
[1:39:31] this right here
[1:39:32] and then here
[1:39:35] it was back again
[1:39:37] and then went again back again when
[1:39:40] again then the things come back again
[1:39:42] but finally and this is what they said
[1:39:46] when they got desperate to be free
[1:39:51] when they got desperate to be free
[1:39:53] because we can say I surrender you see
[1:39:56] some of that sometimes those terms seem
[1:39:58] so vague
[1:39:59] to somebody who hasn't never come to
[1:40:01] that place it seems so vague because
[1:40:03] it's like this right here then you know
[1:40:05] if I'm going to give you my phone and
[1:40:06] I'm handing it to Paul say here Paul
[1:40:08] take it come on take it take it take it
[1:40:12] take it
[1:40:14] we're in a tug of war
[1:40:16] I'm not really surrendering
[1:40:19] are you hearing me
[1:40:21] thank you
[1:40:24] I better keep this or we'll never go to
[1:40:25] lunch
[1:40:30] it's where we get for to be free
[1:40:35] it's got to be desperation you see if we
[1:40:38] can be content with and we can look at
[1:40:41] things in our life and we become content
[1:40:43] well everything's all right here and I'm
[1:40:45] okay here we'll keep going around the
[1:40:47] same Mountain but there is something
[1:40:49] that arises up within us it says long
[1:40:52] enough
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:54] long enough there's power let me tell
[1:40:56] you this morning there's power in a
[1:40:58] decision
[1:41:00] are you hearing me there's power in a
[1:41:02] decision
[1:41:03] every one of us has the ability to make
[1:41:06] a decision here this morning
[1:41:11] let me let me read this in closing we're
[1:41:14] just going to stop here
[1:41:17] but the brand says tonight
[1:41:19] the Branham Tabernacle has got to make
[1:41:22] up its mind
[1:41:24] we're either going to go on or go back
[1:41:28] we're either going they're going to go
[1:41:30] we'll go back to garlic and leak and
[1:41:31] stuff of Egypt or you're going on to
[1:41:33] Angel's food to the promised land where
[1:41:34] God made a promise
[1:41:36] we're going on to an Old-Fashioned Holy
[1:41:38] Ghost Revival or you'll be wishing while
[1:41:40] she packing around and pecking like a
[1:41:42] robin on an Apple until the day you die
[1:41:44] I don't know about you but I don't want
[1:41:45] to be wishy-washy
[1:41:48] I don't want to be that
[1:41:50] you've got to make your decision you
[1:41:52] can't go on why haunt you between two
[1:41:56] opinions said Elijah God be God serve
[1:41:59] him if he's not God then don't serve him
[1:42:02] now notice what he brings in here but
[1:42:04] the brand goes in and he says the real
[1:42:06] experience of God is what takes the sin
[1:42:09] out of a man's heart
[1:42:10] not belonging to a church or belonging
[1:42:13] to a clan or belonging to an
[1:42:15] organization
[1:42:16] goes on talk about how education we'll
[1:42:18] never do it
[1:42:21] he says there's only one Savior for the
[1:42:23] world and that's the blood of Jesus
[1:42:25] Christ who has freely poured out at
[1:42:28] Calvary for the remission of every sin
[1:42:30] that a man ever committed he was wounded
[1:42:33] for our transgressions Bruce for our
[1:42:36] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:42:38] was upon him and with his strats we were
[1:42:41] healed I challenge any man or woman in
[1:42:45] the name of Jesus Christ to take God at
[1:42:47] his promise tonight and see if it's
[1:42:49] right or wrong
[1:42:51] now watch where he goes into
[1:42:53] I've seen the dead raised when the
[1:42:56] doctors walked away and pronounced him
[1:42:57] dead
[1:43:00] the guy Witnesses right here
[1:43:03] some right here
[1:43:04] that God has raised from the dead
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:09] you just had a testimony here this
[1:43:11] morning that wasn't years ago this was
[1:43:13] just wasn't last week brother Dave
[1:43:15] I completely forgot about it he came in
[1:43:17] my office and told me about it this
[1:43:18] morning
[1:43:21] the cancer that was on his nose gone
[1:43:27] now you tell me who did that
[1:43:32] right there's no one no man could do
[1:43:34] that
[1:43:35] ain't no man's hands that are special
[1:43:37] it's almighty God that's in our midst
[1:43:41] and if the same God could take a cancer
[1:43:43] off a nose what about a cancer in your
[1:43:45] soul what about a cancer in your spirit
[1:43:47] what about a cancer in your mind
[1:43:50] he's still God
[1:43:55] you say a cancer a cancer is trying to
[1:43:58] take the life out of you
[1:44:02] Hallelujah there's something here's
[1:44:04] greater than spiritual chemo there's the
[1:44:07] blood of Jesus Christ that Passage
[1:44:14] and if you'll side with the word of God
[1:44:16] if you'll make that decision and say
[1:44:18] that's what I want I want that living
[1:44:22] reality
[1:44:24] there's a God who is present Who removed
[1:44:28] cancer who heals arms who raises the
[1:44:31] Dead
[1:44:35] Hallelujah
[1:44:37] who heals of lupus
[1:44:41] and going and on there's a God right
[1:44:44] here this morning that can meet your
[1:44:46] need when you're ready to say long
[1:44:48] enough
[1:44:50] long enough
[1:44:52] when the doctors have walked away and
[1:44:54] said nope

[1:45:02] lost cause

[1:45:11] failed you're not a lost cause

[1:45:17] that it's a life spirit that would want
[1:45:19] to keep you bound but Liberty is here
[1:45:22] this morning
[1:45:26] you're a son and daughter of God you may
[1:45:28] not know it in reality this morning but
[1:45:30] there's a voice that's taken a hold of
[1:45:32] you as the shepherd speaking to his
[1:45:35] sheep and saying it's long enough
[1:45:40] maybe you've lived underneath traditions
[1:45:44] and mind battles and the enemy telling
[1:45:46] you're not good enough right now this
[1:45:48] morning it's long enough
[1:45:51] you don't have to listen to him one more
[1:45:55] moment

[1:46:29] and tried to be made well took shots in
[1:46:32] everything and all the psychology in the
[1:46:34] world and the best doctors of the world
[1:46:35] could be gotten to give them treatment
[1:46:37] and fail and I've seen that same man
