[0:01] this is what I say that though Israel
[0:03] could not hear it here but remember
[0:05] those trumpets were supernaturally
[0:09] sounded so the spirit of God going out
[0:12] throughout the Earth and that's why it
[0:14] that's what it is that begin to cause
[0:16] you to yearn to desire you might have
[0:19] had your start at an altar in some
[0:21] Mission somewhere or some church but
[0:23] listen what it is the spirit of God come
[0:25] and begin to draw upon your heart and
[0:28] it's something that you could not where
[0:30] you were and you might say well brother
[0:32] Samuel I was born and raised in a
[0:33] message church now you're talking my
[0:35] language I was as well but you recognize
[0:38] that still there had to come a moment
[0:41] where God begin to stir what he had
[0:43] placed on the inside that there's got to
[0:45] be something more than just knowing
[0:48] what's right just believing this message
[0:50] but there's got to be something more
[0:52] what is it it's the spirit of
[0:54] understanding the spirit of Truth the
[0:56] quickening power that's drawing upon
[0:59] that part of himself on the inside and
[1:02] we can never be satisfied with anything
[1:05] less than
[1:07] Christ so here we are standing in the
[1:10] end time when the ages are finishing and
[1:13] a bride of Jesus Christ the Bible says
[1:16] the Lamb's wife is on Earth and he is
[1:19] manifested himself according to his word
[1:23] think of it think of it the countless
[1:25] number the tapes you and I listen to the
[1:27] messages and how many of them with the
[1:30] things that were said in a manner of oh
[1:32] you know oh this gift oh this precious
[1:34] gift all this gift but they missed the
[1:37] revealing of the son of
[1:39] man the gift was not the
[1:42] emphasis but the gift was only to
[1:44] manifest and to declare that he is now
[1:49] here he's here in the fullness and the
[1:52] Fulfillment of his
[1:54] word but there's a people that were
[1:56] ordained to it elected to it that the
[1:59] grace of God catches our lives and it
[2:02] draws Us in this place and here he is in
[2:05] his fullness in a people she's under her
[2:07] husband the word and she's bringing
[2:10] forth children unto the
[2:12] Lord I wanted just looking at this
[2:15] living in the Realms of
[2:17] Grace in this hour I certainly believe
[2:20] that that's where God has called for us
[2:22] to live we find the the the the the the
[2:26] admonition in the scripture that we have
[2:29] been orain gain to live in Heavenly
[2:33] places is that right it's just like this
[2:36] I and I'm I'm going to say something
[2:38] that is a supposed to but that might be
[2:41] serve as a little example here in this
[2:44] area we supposedly elect people to
[2:47] represent us in another place
[2:51] supposedly okay I know that's a big
[2:53] supposed but it
[2:55] is now don't get caught up on that but
[2:58] the people that we elect are to be a
[3:01] representative before a body and
[3:03] decisions that are made are to be in our
[3:05] best interest let me just say this when
[3:09] we speak about being in Heavenly places
[3:12] in Christ Jesus we are speaking about
[3:15] that representation that we had before
[3:18] the foundation of the world yes sir
[3:20] where the Bible says where the sons of
[3:22] God shouted for Joy that's right is that
[3:27] right absolutely we are speaking of that
[3:29] to where that even when John himself
[3:32] would see his name what was John seeing
[3:34] it's the author name are you hearing me
[3:38] we're speaking of that representation
[3:40] like you would go and you would call
[3:42] whoever I don't even know who it is
[3:43] whoever a representative is for this
[3:45] area you would call them and say hey uh
[3:47] can you do something about the parks
[3:49] down here but you see we we recognize
[3:52] this is something so far greater because
[3:54] our representation is Before the Throne
[3:56] of God but there had to be somebody to
[3:59] connect us back to that
[4:02] representation somebody who could span
[4:05] the breach somebody who could take take
[4:08] away the Gap somebody who could bring
[4:11] that reality of thy will be done in in
[4:14] Earth even as it is in
[4:16] heaven right when I go somewhere else
[4:18] there's times where you know you go to
[4:20] another Nation they can say tell you're
[4:22] American by the way you walk I don't
[4:25] know I
[4:26] mean I don't know about that oh that's
[4:28] true but well listen how much more
[4:30] greater right here we're of a greater
[4:34] Kingdom we're not of an Earthly Kingdom
[4:36] we might stand here in these different
[4:38] citizenships and so forth but we are of
[4:41] another kingdom we've been born of the
[4:44] spirit of God into that Kingdom and our
[4:46] lives here are to reflect in this earth
[4:49] that other Kingdom so we're tied back
[4:52] into that representation we're tied back
[4:54] in being represented in Heavenly places
[4:57] in Christ Jesus and that's where we live
[5:00] that's our Authority living in the
[5:02] Realms of Grace now I want to just deal
[5:05] with this in terms of of that in law and
[5:09] Grace and I want you just to keep that
[5:11] thought in mind because when we're
[5:13] looking at this here in the Scripture it
[5:14] says a woman clothed with the sun and we
[5:17] know that that's the gospel that's
[5:19] Christ and the moon under her feet and
[5:22] above her head a crown of stars so she's
[5:24] living in the realm of Grace Above the
[5:27] Law we want to get to that here in a
[5:30] moment in Galatians 3:21 Paul lay lays
[5:34] us out in this time here with with with
[5:37] that of uh in the galatian church is the
[5:39] law then against the promises of God God
[5:43] forbid now we all know what the law is
[5:45] Thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt
[5:47] not but he says if there had been a law
[5:50] given which could have given life verily
[5:53] righteousness should have been by the
[5:55] law but the scripture hath concluded all
[5:58] under sin that the Promise by faith of
[6:01] Jesus Christ might be given to them that
[6:05] believe but before Faith came that's
[6:08] faith is the absolute essential
[6:11] necessity before Faith came we were kept
[6:15] under the law shut up in unto the faith
[6:19] which should afterwards be revealed we
[6:21] were in a prison
[6:23] house the law was there expressing we
[6:27] are guilty right Paul said I had not
[6:30] known sin L there was the law right I
[6:33] mean it's like how many have well don't
[6:35] raise your hand but you know you've been
[6:37] up and down sometimes a Road thank God
[6:39] for the GPS's that you have on right now
[6:41] times I'm other places I'm looking you
[6:43] know I pull that up and I want to know
[6:45] what's the speed limit here cuz
[6:46] sometimes you get in a place and there's
[6:48] no signs on what the speed limit
[6:50] is good luck trying to tell the officer
[6:52] I didn't know what the speed
[6:55] was good luck with that one right but
[6:59] you're recognize that this here the law
[7:01] was to point out that we that we are
[7:04] guilty but notice this we where the law
[7:08] was our school Master to bring us unto
[7:11] Christ that we might be justified by
[7:14] faith so the law wasn't all bad there
[7:17] was a shadow so there was a measure of
[7:19] light but it was a school Master to
[7:22] bring us unto
[7:24] Christ right now notice that we might be
[7:28] justified by faith but after that faith
[7:32] is come we are no longer under a school
[7:36] Master for ye are all children all for
[7:40] you are all the children of God by faith
[7:42] in Christ Jesus for as many as you have
[7:45] been baptized into Christ have put on
[7:48] Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek
[7:51] there is neither Bond nor free there's
[7:53] neither male nor female for you are all
[7:56] one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ
[8:00] then are you Abraham's seed and HS
[8:03] according to the promise in Romans 3:31
[8:07] Paul said do we then make void the law
[8:11] through faith God forbid yay we
[8:15] establish the
[8:17] law remember God's desire was and he
[8:20] made a promise Ezekiel Jeremiah and he
[8:23] made this promise to the house of Israel
[8:26] but we know that it had that it was
[8:28] coming to that of the Gentiles where God
[8:31] said I will write my laws and my
[8:34] statutes upon your heart and in your
[8:38] minds and I'll remember your sin no
[8:42] more God made a promise that he would do
[8:45] that man could copy the law but God made
[8:49] a promise that I'm the one solely
[8:52] reserved the right that I will inscript
[8:55] this my own law my word on your heart
[8:58] and in your mind so coming to a place to
[9:02] think of this that even when the Lord
[9:04] Jesus when he come remember when he come
[9:08] even even Paul afterwards this is where
[9:10] Paul is even referring to this it it's
[9:12] so misunderstood when the Fulfillment of
[9:15] the word comes to many look at as though
[9:18] it's trying to take away from what was
[9:20] already there but Jesus said I am not
[9:23] come to destroy the law or the
[9:27] prophets see the Fulfillment of it you
[9:30] we would think in our minds you would
[9:32] think though the Fulfillment of it it's
[9:34] just going to make sense but remember
[9:36] the Fulfillment of it is just as
[9:38] Supernatural as the god supernaturally
[9:42] moved upon the prophets and spoke
[9:45] it and God speaks it and here is a time
[9:48] and a season for it to be fulfilled
[9:51] there's all types of ways that it that
[9:53] man can get in his mind and maybe it'll
[9:55] be this way and maybe it'll be that way
[9:57] and we know that that was there but what
[10:00] was greater than all of the ways that
[10:02] could be thought is that down on the
[10:04] inside like the little woman at the well
[10:06] like Simeon like Anna they were able to
[10:09] catch the expression of the Fulfillment
[10:12] of the
[10:13] word they did not see the word as this
[10:17] fulfillment as taking away from the law
[10:20] and the
[10:22] prophets oh my you see a with the
[10:26] scripture this is here's God coming
[10:29] coming down almighty God coming down
[10:32] changing his mask great Jehovah God
[10:36] Spirit now changing his Mas he was in
[10:39] portion in part in the prophets is that
[10:43] right when he stood there and he asked
[10:45] them who do you say I am some say you're
[10:47] Jeremiah some Elias some Moses some on
[10:50] and on but notice they inart not in the
[10:53] fullness but in part it was Christ being
[10:56] revealed through each of their lives
[11:00] right now within that how God himself
[11:04] coming down and he takes and he changes
[11:08] his mask and now you and I were standing
[11:11] in need of a kinsman redeemer we were
[11:15] standing in one we we could not pay the
[11:18] price we could not satisfy the debt but
[11:21] God himself changed his
[11:24] mask amen he came down and took upon a
[11:27] body on himself and he paid the price
[11:29] for you and I that that life might come
[11:32] to you and I that we could become fully
[11:35] manifested Sons and Daughters of God
[11:38] this is why we hear this establishing of
[11:40] the law this is why Jesus could say and
[11:43] is expressed through David in Psalms 40
[11:46] but he says I Delight to do thy will oh
[11:49] God yay thy law is within my heart
[11:54] that's that's good this could never be
[11:57] before
[11:59] this could never be before this is
[12:02] speaking this is now coming God
[12:05] restoring and is restoring it by himself
[12:09] where God would take his own laws upon
[12:12] himself is that right David you know
[12:15] could say I bind him on my finger I bind
[12:18] him on the fringes all of that had a
[12:20] tight but it could never be in the heart
[12:23] Hallelujah because this is a sovereign
[12:26] work of almighty God Amen that's right
[12:29] where God comes in and God sets in the
[12:32] midst of the Throne of our life this is
[12:35] why his expression back there when he
[12:38] told Moses he told the rest of Israel
[12:41] let them make me a sanctuary that I may
[12:44] dwell among them he didn't say let them
[12:46] make me a
[12:47] tabernacle let them make me a sanctuary
[12:50] the sanctuary is the innermost sanctum
[12:52] the innermost
[12:54] place because God himself was calling
[12:58] for let them oh my they could only
[13:01] surrender what they have and you and I
[13:03] can only surrender what we
[13:06] have you might say what gift do I have
[13:08] let me tell you what the prophet said in
[13:10] things that are to be he said that real
[13:13] gift on the inside of you is that soul
[13:16] that came from God that can be
[13:18] surrendered to God and God can take that
[13:21] life and so impregnate that life with
[13:24] his presence and bring forth a son and
[13:26] daughter of God that bears His image
[13:30] thy the law thy law is within my heart
[13:33] think of this in Matthew 17 I I'm just
[13:36] I'm moving here very quickly but
[13:38] remember on Matthew 17 there were three
[13:41] Earthly witnesses that were
[13:44] taken up to mount's
[13:46] Transfiguration and there was three
[13:48] Heavenly
[13:49] Witnesses let me just read this in verse
[13:51] one and after six days Jesus taken Peter
[13:55] James and John his brother and bringeth
[13:57] them up into a high mountain Mountain
[13:59] apart and was transfigured before them
[14:02] and his face did shine as the sun and
[14:06] his rment was white as the
[14:09] light what is this this is the
[14:12] adoption it's an adoption
[14:15] Ceremony this is why that even as the
[14:19] prophet would would bring us and
[14:20] emphasize in this hour that we're living
[14:22] in brother Brown countless times would
[14:24] preach hear you
[14:26] him then coming into the adoption series
[14:29] I'm I'm going this way as he's leading
[14:32] purposely that as he would deal with
[14:35] that there's more to it than just being
[14:37] born of his Spirit meaning that more
[14:40] than just
[14:41] repentance it's more than just
[14:44] sanctification right but it's to be
[14:46] adopted or placed to where his life
[14:50] comes on the inside
[14:52] that's it's an adoption it's a moment
[14:55] it's listen the Holy Spirit has been
[14:57] given out throughout the ages is that
[14:59] right because you could look back and
[15:00] say well the holy spirit's been given
[15:02] throughout the ages but it was a
[15:05] portion in the Ephesian age a
[15:08] portion all the way down through was a
[15:11] portion but in the end time we are not
[15:15] promised a portion but we are promised
[15:19] he himself who is the gift amen the
[15:22] person of Jesus Christ let us be glad
[15:25] and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb
[15:28] has come How can there be a marriage if
[15:30] there's no
[15:34] groom but he's here declaring himself
[15:38] and he's calling to Hearts to unite with
[15:45] him that's him it's not just a
[15:48] portion so here we are standing in a
[15:50] time where a word here even as the word
[15:53] serving as our school Master do you
[15:55] realize that even within every one of
[15:57] our lives even uh lives that can be in
[16:00] Journey right here this morning the word
[16:03] itself if you haven't fully received the
[16:06] the spirit of God to come into that
[16:07] place of adoption where it's Christ in
[16:10] you do you realize the word is given as
[16:12] a school Master to teach you it's not
[16:15] there to put you down but it's there to
[16:18] guide you in the right
[16:21] way before the fire could come down on
[16:24] Mount on Mount Carmel the the stones had
[16:27] to be put in order is that right right
[16:30] how did how did Elijah know how to put
[16:31] the stones in order well he was a
[16:33] prophet okay but
[16:35] how he said I have done all of this
[16:39] according to Thy word now the scriptures
[16:42] we read in Galatians 3 said we were shut
[16:45] up unto this faith we were shut up we
[16:49] were kept back from it you see it takes
[16:51] a faith to even respond and believe
[16:55] God's word it takes Faith to First
[16:57] recognize in your life that I'm a sinner
[17:00] and I need God it takes Faith to
[17:02] recognize that I need God now what is it
[17:05] it's God moving upon your faith to draw
[17:09] you and bring you to a place to where he
[17:11] can step in and it's no longer your
[17:15] faith alone because your faith or my
[17:18] faith will give out in
[17:22] times but his faith it cannot give out
[17:26] his faith holds you when your
[17:31] faith come on Friends pulled up next to
[17:35] brother brandham asked him and said
[17:37] Billy he said how you holding your
[17:40] religion now he said it ain't holding me
[17:43] he said that I ain't holding it he said
[17:45] but it's holding
[17:48] me it's something that's real that it's
[17:51] him it's Christ it's a living God that's
[17:54] holding me that's stabilizing my life
[17:57] that's giving me
[17:59] strength and see that in itself in When
[18:03] Faith even its initial places comes it
[18:06] starts as a love
[18:09] affair I mean if you start talking to a
[18:12] young lady young man and there's not
[18:14] something there's not some sort of an
[18:15] attraction or some something you can see
[18:17] a substance then what are you doing
[18:19] talking to
[18:22] them well that got quiet but it's true
[18:26] there's going to be a reason or purpose
[18:28] it's not just playing
[18:30] around you see this is why the prophet
[18:32] said in Christ the mystery he said who
[18:34] does he reveal himself to not
[18:39] flirters not flirters but lives that
[18:42] desire to know him Jesus said if you
[18:46] love me keep my Commandments and we will
[18:49] come and make our Abode in your life so
[18:53] it's simple obedience to the word of God
[18:56] that takes faith
[18:59] it's Faith to recognize he's calling you
[19:01] calling he's dealing with your life it's
[19:03] God touching our hearts it's God drawing
[19:06] us so here we come into this place of
[19:08] Matthew 17 and here at verse three let
[19:11] me get back to this behold there
[19:13] appeared unto them Moses and Elias
[19:16] talking with him then answered Peter and
[19:19] said unto Jesus Lord is it good for us
[19:23] to be here he got excited didn't
[19:26] he if thou wilt let us make here three
[19:31] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[19:34] and one for Elias Elijah while he spake
[19:38] Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them
[19:41] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[19:44] which said this is my beloved Son in
[19:47] whom I'm well pleased hear ye
[19:50] him I like how brother Ram says this
[19:52] brother Ram said before he could get it
[19:54] out he said the voice spoke and shut him
[19:57] up
[20:00] he wanted to make three Tabernacles
[20:01] Peter was all excited I mean my think
[20:04] about it here you are and you see Moses
[20:07] standing there you see Elijah you've
[20:09] only heard about
[20:11] them right but here you are seeing them
[20:14] you say how did they know it the prophet
[20:16] said because at that moment under that
[20:20] presence under that inspiration they
[20:23] knew who they were can I preach for a
[20:26] moment he said you might be wondering
[20:28] how will I recognize my dad how will I
[20:30] recognize my mom he said you will
[20:33] recognize them when they raised because
[20:36] of the inspiration of the moment you'll
[20:39] know your loved
[20:41] ones maybe it's one that's died as a
[20:44] little baby passed on how will I know
[20:47] them oh my you won't need a computer
[20:49] generated program you won't need an app
[20:51] to
[20:52] know Hallelujah the inspiration of the
[20:56] moment will make it known to
[20:59] you the point is to be found ready
[21:03] watching looking and that understanding
[21:05] poured out within that moment just as it
[21:08] is right now that you understand this is
[21:09] a moment this is an hour this is a Time
[21:12] Christ is Among Us and I'm one of his
[21:14] children that same understanding so to
[21:17] think of it where Moses you know I'm
[21:21] glad I'm glad that these Tabernacles
[21:24] were not built because the law only put
[21:27] us in jail
[21:31] is that right the law only put us in
[21:35] jail and the prophets were there as
[21:38] God's justice to execute judgment when
[21:42] the law says you're guilty and the
[21:44] prophets came to execute judgment is
[21:48] that right but here notice the focus and
[21:51] the attention here this is my beloved
[21:55] Son hear ye him where one who has met
[22:00] all the requirements one who has
[22:03] satisfied the debt amen what was needed
[22:08] in order for man to go free because we
[22:11] couldn't live by the
[22:13] law I mean we could but we couldn't it
[22:17] wasn't God's perfect will God's perfect
[22:20] will is that it would be and reside in
[22:23] the heart of a people his own life
[22:26] moving through you and I but notice
[22:29] because even as David would write things
[22:31] David knew the prophet said he was
[22:33] missing something in his life he knew
[22:36] there was something
[22:40] Beyond oh my don't you love him and to
[22:44] think of this but how that Christ was
[22:47] Mercy the law put you in jail but it
[22:50] couldn't get you out the prophets is
[22:52] God's justice to condemn you and kill
[22:54] you forth but Jesus was God's love and
[22:57] re Revelation to to let you know as a
[23:00] predestinated seed that he had called
[23:03] you this is him hear ye him now I don't
[23:07] want to just go back there to where we
[23:09] have to go back prior to Calvary but
[23:11] remember prior to Calvary this statement
[23:15] is made this is my beloved Son hear ye
[23:18] him and he hadn't even been smitten
[23:21] yet it was prophecy the sacrifice
[23:25] that'll be offered up it will be smitten
[23:28] and hear ye him he's going to speak
[23:32] Liberty will come Jubilee is going to be
[23:34] called calling you and I back to a
[23:37] rightful
[23:39] position and here he is he begins to
[23:41] speak he enters into a bright body
[23:43] enters into a life and it begins to Paul
[23:46] say and here we stand in this hour a
[23:49] mount
[23:50] Transfiguration
[23:54] experience a time of adoption where Sons
[23:58] and Daughters of God come into
[24:01] manifestation to reflect the Living God
[24:05] standing here adorned in his
[24:09] reignment the son the righteousness the
[24:12] glory of
[24:13] God the son and notice even of here of
[24:18] this where we read in our opening
[24:20] chapter and to think about here this
[24:24] woman is crowned having 12 stars on her
[24:28] head the doctrines of the Apostle this
[24:31] is why that anything that outside of
[24:34] accepting the full word of God is not
[24:36] the
[24:37] bride anything less than the doctrine
[24:40] because the church is built on the
[24:41] doctrine of the Apostles and the
[24:44] prophets is that right where the what
[24:47] the scriptures taught what the word
[24:48] taught that's why we we stand it's not
[24:51] just something we say is a cliche of say
[24:54] well I believe the Bible we are Bible
[24:56] Believers We Believe believe all the
[24:58] word of God the Bible said blessed are
[25:01] they who do and keep all his
[25:04] Commandments for they shall have right
[25:06] to
[25:07] life is that right it's not just part
[25:10] it's not just not just fragments it's
[25:12] not just what we like but I'm thankful
[25:15] to God God has delivered us from the
[25:17] Ingenuity of man and man's reasoning and
[25:20] Theology and brought us to a living
[25:23] presence of a living God that we can
[25:25] know him and there is not one thing in
[25:28] the Bible not one word of God where our
[25:31] soul cannot punctuate
[25:33] amen if there's anything in here
[25:36] anything that where your heart draws
[25:38] back check your spirit and say God bring
[25:42] me to that place to where I can stand
[25:44] there and say Amen to every word of
[25:48] God hallelujah hallelujah that's what
[25:51] God
[25:52] does that's where he brings us to and
[25:55] this is why the prophet would say just
[25:57] to just to think of this we are what we
[26:00] are right now this moment because the
[26:04] grace of God has appeared to
[26:07] us if God's grace had not appeared to us
[26:10] now I may have got your attention some
[26:12] way or another but let me say it what it
[26:14] all comes back to is God calling you as
[26:17] an individual me to a personal
[26:19] relationship with
[26:21] him that's what it all comes back to to
[26:24] where he's living his own life through
[26:26] you and I oh what what would we have
[26:29] been we'd have still been
[26:31] Sinners we'd have still been under the
[26:33] wrath of God we would have still been
[26:36] walking with a I trust everything's all
[26:38] right I hope everything's all
[26:40] right but God's brought us certainty in
[26:43] this
[26:43] hour the word that God has delivered in
[26:46] this hour listen friends when we talk
[26:49] about the lamb taking the book it's all
[26:51] about the person of Jesus Christ it's
[26:54] God himself coming down Among Us
[26:58] there's no greater certainty than his
[27:01] voice he said my sheep know my
[27:05] voice and a sheep longs to hear his
[27:08] voice yes sir I'm not looking for
[27:10] something that you know that man will
[27:12] Pat me on the back and go along with me
[27:15] and tell me what a good guy I am I I
[27:16] want a word that brings Assurance in my
[27:20] life a word that I know where I'm
[27:22] standing and not just know where I'm
[27:24] standing but I can live I can move as a
[27:27] son and daughter of
[27:30] God and I'm going to say the grace of
[27:33] God Has Lifted Us in this hour to a
[27:36] rightful position it's pointed out to
[27:39] you and I that there is a blood to take
[27:43] care of every sin stain that When sin is
[27:47] confessed and it goes in the bleach goes
[27:51] in the Clorox of God if I can say it the
[27:54] blood of Jesus Christ and that person
[27:57] cannot come out the same way again it
[28:01] changes you it changes your life it
[28:05] transforms your
[28:09] life now just to confess We Believe
[28:12] something won't do it there can be a
[28:14] start but I'm telling you the God has
[28:16] called you and I to a place as Sons and
[28:19] Daughters of God where his own life is
[28:21] living through you and I let me just say
[28:24] this that is something that your mom
[28:26] your dad or or the prophet even Jesus
[28:29] Christ standing right here and I believe
[28:31] he is speaking through our vessel
[28:33] through our lives this morning but he
[28:35] cannot create or bring about and cause
[28:38] you to all of a sudden to want it that's
[28:41] got to be something that rises within
[28:43] your heart amen he brings that
[28:46] desperation is that right his presence
[28:48] moving among us but without desperation
[28:52] where are we
[28:54] at oh my think of the Prophet just
[28:57] listening to this
[28:59] week and in the message I heard but now
[29:01] I see they're in the first part of the
[29:04] week brother Brown talking and I Marvel
[29:07] when I go back across that where hady
[29:09] Wright was standing
[29:10] there and she remember she hears the
[29:14] report about those squirrels being
[29:16] spoken into
[29:17] existence now brother brandham goes in
[29:19] to tell us he'll tell in different
[29:21] stories but those two boys were over
[29:23] there laughing at him right are you
[29:26] hearing me right they were laughing at
[29:31] him but then she's at that moment here's
[29:34] where she heard her here's where she
[29:36] stood steady she stood steady at that
[29:40] moment as a Believer God knew God knew
[29:42] the needs of her of her boys God knew
[29:45] those needs but at that moment here it
[29:48] drops down in that moment that's nothing
[29:52] but the truth brother Brandon amen and
[29:55] at that moment brother Brandon says
[29:57] super anointing dropped down in the room
[30:00] you see how powerful it is to agree with
[30:02] the word of God you see how powerful it
[30:04] is to be in a place that even when as we
[30:07] come into the house of God and we're
[30:08] walking daily not just when we're here
[30:10] but to be in that place to be a channel
[30:13] where inspiration can drop
[30:17] down God provides a way for that now I
[30:20] think of that those two boys brother BR
[30:22] says here they were over here laughing
[30:25] cutting up
[30:28] my I wonder I wonder how many of us
[30:29] would have just put him
[30:31] out what I'm trying to show you is is
[30:33] that listen in order for something to
[30:36] take place it took the supernatural to
[30:39] move on their
[30:40] hearts their actions and responses was
[30:43] as much in
[30:46] opposition to what was going to be asked
[30:48] for and sister hady right said ask
[30:51] whatever you want and brother R
[30:53] mentioned that to her and she said I
[30:55] want the salvation of my boy brother B
[30:57] said at that moment they fell across
[31:00] turn lap gave their heart to God and
[31:02] were filled with the Holy
[31:06] Ghost what happened the atmosphere
[31:09] changed so it brings me back to this
[31:11] place and this point God has to change
[31:14] the
[31:17] atmosphere that's why it's not just
[31:19] coming and receiving the Holy Ghost upon
[31:22] our life but God it's getting into that
[31:24] of the place of the word yes am man
[31:27] entering into the spirit of God and
[31:29] allowing the spirit of God to affect our
[31:33] lives let me tell you something don't
[31:35] hold back to the end of the
[31:37] service don't let the devil get on your
[31:40] shoulder and say well you're not worthy
[31:42] you're not there you're not this you've
[31:43] got to enter into the atmosphere you've
[31:45] got to get into the word that's what
[31:47] this word is being ministered it's a
[31:49] word of life it's a word of the glory of
[31:52] God it's a word that says you are Sons
[31:55] and Daughters of God
[31:58] it's God that changes the atmosphere God
[32:00] that changes the heart I want you to
[32:03] think of this grace that you and I are
[32:06] standing in In This Moment Paul says in
[32:09] Romans 5:1 therefore being justified by
[32:12] faith we have peace with God through our
[32:15] Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have
[32:19] access by faith into this grace wherein
[32:23] we stand and rejoice in Hope of the
[32:27] glory of God in 1 Peter
[32:30] 5:12 Peter writes it like this Bas
[32:33] sylvenus a faithful brother the end of
[32:36] the quote scripture exhorting and
[32:38] testifying that this is the true grace
[32:41] of God wherein you
[32:44] stand so to be above the
[32:47] law I know that's very simple but to be
[32:50] above the law Paul said Galatians 5:18
[32:54] if you be led of the spirit ye are not
[32:57] under the
[33:00] law brother bandam simply takes it like
[33:02] this in the uh latter part of that of
[33:05] that scripture or that that quote in the
[33:07] mark of the beast seal of God part two
[33:09] he says so through the true Seed of
[33:11] Abraham is Jesus Christ which is the
[33:15] grace of God and no more law to it no
[33:18] sir laws not connected with it at all
[33:21] you're above the law over the law it's
[33:25] love love is above the law Grace law
[33:30] came by Moses Grace and Truth by Jesus
[33:34] Christ in the message then Jesus came
[33:37] and called he said the law was for the
[33:39] Jews years ago today we're in the Realms
[33:43] of Grace We're living Above the Law a
[33:46] man that's living in Grace has no law
[33:51] there's no law for
[33:55] Grace oh my he said how can you condemn
[33:58] me for running a stoplight here which
[34:00] the city has done give me a right to run
[34:03] any stoplight I wish to you couldn't
[34:05] there's no law to condemn me so as long
[34:09] as I'm in Christ I'm free from the law
[34:13] I'm above the law because I'm in his
[34:16] grace what's he talking about in his
[34:20] life in Christ he's put that confidence
[34:24] in me that I won't do anything that's
[34:26] wrong or he wouldn't give me gra give me
[34:29] that Grace that's what he does to you
[34:31] the same way we in his
[34:36] grace this is the true grace of God it's
[34:39] not we in Grace and you know God doesn't
[34:42] care about how it it no the this that's
[34:44] not the grace of God at all that's
[34:46] disgrace that's what that's what Jude
[34:48] wrote that there were men men who crept
[34:52] in unawares turning the grace of our God
[34:55] into obviousness but there is a true
[34:59] grace of God where a Heart Is Made free
[35:02] from where how is it made free from
[35:04] bondage it wasn't remember the
[35:07] scriptures God didn't do away with the
[35:09] law he fulfills the law and the same one
[35:13] who gave the law now comes and lives
[35:16] inside of your life and it's him living
[35:19] out his own life your nature that was
[35:22] against the law that was against the
[35:24] word that nature has been done away
[35:27] with don't you understand the new birth
[35:30] is not God cleaning a person up and
[35:33] saying I'm going to marry you the new
[35:35] birth is God killing the old
[35:39] man that's why he can remember your sins
[35:42] no more you look in the mirror and you
[35:45] remember yourself as a
[35:48] sinner but God sees who you have been a
[35:51] whole time a son and daughter of God and
[35:54] that's what the quickening power came to
[35:57] raise up what did that the grace of God
[36:02] not law the grace of
[36:06] God Romans 8 can I have a few more
[36:09] moments Romans 81 there is therefore now
[36:12] no
[36:14] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[36:17] Jesus we
[36:19] passed judgment's been
[36:23] passed he that hear my words and
[36:25] believeth on him is me has passed from
[36:29] Death unto life when they put the blood
[36:33] on the lentil and the post of the door
[36:36] the Lamb's blood being applied was
[36:40] signified death has already come here
[36:43] there's one that's taken the place and
[36:45] the Death Angel passed right over and
[36:48] that's why to be a partaker of the Holy
[36:52] Spirit it shows that you have been
[36:54] identified in the shedding of the
[36:58] blood it's a token hallu the token that
[37:03] gives us Grace to move beyond the living
[37:07] or the dead works of man dead Creeds of
[37:11] man come on friends I was like that even
[37:13] as a young boy of things I got to do
[37:15] this I got to do that and you got to do
[37:16] this and you got to do that listen it's
[37:19] something deeper it's deeper than I've
[37:21] got to do this and I got to do that oh I
[37:23] got to make sure everything's just right
[37:24] brother so and so they might see me here
[37:25] or sister so and so it's deeper than
[37:27] that amen it's got to be something to
[37:29] where you realize whether brother or
[37:31] sister so and so are around or not God
[37:33] is always around and it has to come to a
[37:36] place that your desire is to please
[37:40] him watch this who walk not after the
[37:44] flesh but after the spirit what's he
[37:46] speaking of the nature on the inside
[37:49] you're not walking after that first
[37:51] nature you're walking after the spirit
[37:52] in other words he is your aim he is your
[37:55] goal for the law of the spirit of life
[37:58] in Christ Jesus hath made me free from
[38:01] the law of sin and death for what the
[38:03] law could not do in that it was weak
[38:05] through the flesh God sending his own
[38:07] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[38:10] for sin condemn sin in the flesh that
[38:14] the righteousness look at this that the
[38:16] righteousness of the law might be
[38:19] fulfilled in us so as the law was
[38:22] fulfilled in him so is the word
[38:25] fulfilled with in The Bride of Jesus
[38:28] Christ that's why a person say well you
[38:30] know how I I I can't live that well of
[38:33] course you can it's got to take Christ
[38:35] on the inside of you so don't let the
[38:37] devil beat you up or try to put it out
[38:40] that it's got to be you doing it but
[38:41] just invite him fall in love with him
[38:45] when you begin to fall in love with him
[38:47] the things that seem hard and difficult
[38:49] that you look about laying this side
[38:51] laying that aside and let me just put
[38:53] this real clear I'm not just talking
[38:55] their lives right now that are coming to
[38:57] the Holy Ghost but lives that are
[38:59] already in the Holy Spirit it takes a
[39:02] real love affair of us laying aside our
[39:04] reasoning us laying aside everything
[39:07] around of where we maybe have responded
[39:10] in certain ways and it takes the love of
[39:13] God so moving in our
[39:16] lives because who's our goal he's our
[39:18] goal that's who we want to please right
[39:22] it's like the little the boy who played
[39:23] the piano oh they were clapping clapping
[39:25] clapping on here and he came and looked
[39:27] straight up in the
[39:28] balcony oh what's he doing the master
[39:32] was in the balcony all this was fine but
[39:35] the master he wanted to know what did
[39:36] his master say amen that's what we're
[39:38] looking and we're not looking to the
[39:39] Applause of men hallelujah we're looking
[39:42] at what does he
[39:43] say is that right so we're not
[39:46] controlled by fear but by love cuz fear
[39:48] had
[39:49] torment God God's desire is to bring you
[39:52] to settled places in our lives for as
[39:57] many as are led by the spirit of God
[39:59] they are the sons of God for you've not
[40:02] received the spirit of bondage again to
[40:03] fear but you've received the spirit of
[40:05] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father and
[40:09] the spirit beareth witness with our
[40:11] spirit that we're the children of
[40:13] God Romans
[40:15] 2:13 for not the hearers of the law are
[40:18] just before God but the doers of the law
[40:21] shall be
[40:22] justified I want that word to so
[40:25] drop is that your desire amen you see we
[40:29] come and we hear the word and what an
[40:30] atmosphere that the word itself brings
[40:33] and my how encouragement the
[40:36] challenging but God comes by our way
[40:39] that that word might drop down in our
[40:41] lives say God let it drop down within
[40:45] me Let It Drop down in my life Lord let
[40:49] the word like the rain I you know
[40:51] there's times in the summer we were
[40:53] blessed this summer with
[40:55] rain
[40:57] ah we really were but there's been other
[40:59] times you know how it is we say we're
[41:01] getting rain and all you can say is the
[41:03] ground's so dry I hope it's not I hope
[41:06] it's not a heavy rain all at once
[41:08] because you know that Heavy Rain ain't
[41:10] going to do much
[41:11] good it's just going to run off erosion
[41:14] and stuff just runs right off but Lord
[41:18] let it be a steady rain a rain that
[41:20] comes down I don't care if it rains all
[41:22] day and it might rain the same amount
[41:25] that it would rain rain within just
[41:29] minutes but if it just rains a steady
[41:31] Mist throughout all day it allows it to
[41:34] do what soak
[41:37] in that's why as we give ourselves to
[41:40] the word of God that's why as you're
[41:42] hearing certain messages quoted from
[41:45] that's why you're hearing certain
[41:46] scriptures that's why even as we leave
[41:48] the house of God even we're here Lord
[41:50] let it settle down lord for the rain
[41:54] cometh to water amen is that right what
[41:57] is what is that rign his thoughts my
[42:01] ways my thoughts are above yours Lord
[42:03] let him let them saturate down here just
[42:06] let it keep on Sat even when we walk out
[42:08] let it keep saturated let it let it just
[42:10] drop
[42:11] Lord for when the Gentiles which have
[42:14] not the law do by Nature the things
[42:16] contained in the law these having not
[42:18] the law are a law unto themselves which
[42:21] show the work of the law written in
[42:23] their
[42:24] hearts now let let me just read I want a
[42:27] couple more scriptures than I want to
[42:29] read here of quote in
[42:31] closing in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the
[42:34] same yesterday and today and
[42:39] forever be not carried about with
[42:42] diverse and strange doctrines for it is
[42:46] good it is a good thing that the heart
[42:49] be established with Grace not with Meats
[42:54] which are not profited them that that
[42:56] have occupied therein that the heart be
[43:01] established with Grace that's let me
[43:04] just say this that's God's objective is
[43:07] that our heart be established in
[43:09] Grace and let me just say it like this
[43:12] let me just let me read this let me read
[43:14] this quote here there's much more it
[43:15] could be
[43:16] said brother brandham here in the
[43:19] message he says paragraph 140 there law
[43:22] having a shadow he said when God brought
[43:24] is brought out brought out is an
[43:26] Israelite Abraham believed God he said I
[43:29] was talking to a very outstanding one of
[43:31] the greatest Christian leaders in the
[43:32] world today one of the greatest Pastor
[43:34] Bose and I in the room the other day
[43:36] speaking on that see it's not what we
[43:39] did it's what Christ did it isn't what
[43:43] I'm going to do it's what he's done
[43:46] already now I believe in Reading I
[43:50] believe in praying right that's
[43:52] something that draws upon our heart but
[43:54] I'll tell you right now I've been
[43:56] serving God for many years it hadn't
[43:58] gotten no easier My Flesh has never come
[44:00] to a spot and said hey come on let's go
[44:04] pray brother Crest has it got any easier
[44:07] no my flesh has never come to a spot and
[44:09] said hey let's just sit down and listen
[44:10] to a message no my flesh hasn't done
[44:12] that so it's got to be something deeper
[44:15] than my flesh brother Samuel what is
[44:18] that it's overcoming where we have to
[44:20] overcome and press beyond what we feel
[44:24] that's true is that right right so it
[44:26] isn't what I'm going to do it's what
[44:29] he's done already so it you know it's
[44:31] like this right here let me just say it
[44:32] like this if even if I went a day or a
[44:35] moment without praying or reading my
[44:38] Bible it does not change who I am in
[44:41] Christ now I will tell you this right
[44:44] here there will be something missing in
[44:45] my
[44:47] life is that right it'll be like trying
[44:49] to drive the car you know on bad gas I
[44:53] don't know if any of you you know this
[44:54] gas they sell I won't call the gas gas
[44:56] station out but this gas and it looks so
[44:58] cheap and we were out on a trip the one
[45:00] time and I put some in my Expedition you
[45:02] know I don't know what it's 87 or 88
[45:04] whatever it says on the on the sign and
[45:06] man it's supposed to be cheap I'm
[45:07] telling you I didn't know if I was going
[45:08] to be able to get my truck through
[45:10] Pittsburgh it was acting
[45:13] terrible I said never
[45:16] again I am never gassing up with this
[45:18] gas again they just open a a beautiful
[45:20] brand new one on the exit where I live
[45:22] go on by it every
[45:24] time what is you saying brother Samuel
[45:27] that we want real fuel in our
[45:31] lives this is why the spirit of God this
[45:34] is why that it is Grace moving within
[45:37] our lives notice he says I know I'm no
[45:40] good never was never will be but then in
[45:43] the presence of God I'm absolutely
[45:46] perfect because it's not me he never
[45:49] sees me he sees Christ I'm in Christ and
[45:54] my name was asso associated with him at
[45:57] the foundation of the world I'm just
[45:59] waiting for the cord to be draw up we'll
[46:02] go some of these blessed days to meet
[46:04] him in the air some of them said brother
[46:06] brandom aren't ain't you afraid you know
[46:09] many times way back when I was a kid
[46:11] little boy preacher all the people used
[46:13] to come around and say brother brandom
[46:15] why if that be so what he's just spoke
[46:18] why if that be so well then I can just
[46:20] do anything I want to I said that's
[46:23] right sure do anything you want to
[46:26] if Evil's in your heart then you've
[46:29] never been to Calvary that's one thing
[46:31] for
[46:32] sure I always do what I want God lets me
[46:37] do what I want and I'm so glad of it if
[46:41] I did what the devil wanted me to do
[46:44] it's hard to tell what I would do but if
[46:46] I do what I wanted to do like I did
[46:49] before I was Sav but now watch how this
[46:51] comes in service there's a new spirit in
[46:54] here it's not the Spirit of a lamb
[46:56] neither the spirit of William brandom
[46:59] it's the spirit of Jesus Christ that
[47:01] makes me love the unlovable makes me do
[47:04] things that I thought I never would do
[47:07] it's him watch how watch this makes me
[47:10] do things why if it was up to me you
[47:13] know what I'd say tonight I'd have
[47:15] called up brother Mr Bose and said say
[47:17] boy look I've been up for two nights I
[47:19] ain't had a bit of sleep I ain't slept
[47:22] about two hours in the last two nights
[47:23] going and coming people have to door and
[47:26] everything else and weigh in the night
[47:28] and trying to lay down a few minutes
[47:30] they get you up again then it's broke
[47:32] and then that goes away here's another
[47:34] sure I'd stay home he probably have a
[47:36] pretty good excuse now watch he's
[47:38] talking about A Love Affair here but
[47:41] there was something in me that wasn't me
[47:46] said you're supposed to be in Chicago
[47:48] tonight and it was 12:30 at home about
[47:51] 280 Mi to drive through the traffic I
[47:54] said Lord I'm going you help help me and
[47:56] he did and I got here just in time yes
[47:58] sir that's right wow something in
[48:03] me glory be to God oh he says see it's
[48:06] something in you there is now no
[48:09] condemnation can't be to those that are
[48:11] in Christ for they don't walk after the
[48:13] lust of the flesh they walk after the
[48:16] spirit if you love the Lord you want to
[48:18] do everything you can to please
[48:24] himely that's right it'd be kind of be
[48:28] like in your marriage if you just said
[48:29] I'm only going to do big
[48:33] things good
[48:35] luck it's the little
[48:38] things it's the little things to please
[48:40] maybe things that don't even seem maybe
[48:42] to you you don't even see the
[48:44] significance of it like taking your
[48:46] shoes off at the
[48:48] door right I know I have to say this
[48:51] maybe for some for brothers hanging your
[48:53] towel up when you get done in the
[48:55] bathroom
[48:56] that's right picking your own clothes up
[48:58] and putting them in a clothes hamper
[49:00] that's right if you need to act like
[49:02] you're you know you're at the closing
[49:03] shot of the game and you know putting
[49:05] them
[49:08] there maybe your brothers are different
[49:10] ones don't really see the significance
[49:12] of it like I don't understand why this
[49:13] wants to be I don't but when that's made
[49:15] known to you after time maybe years down
[49:18] the Lo Road some things down the line
[49:21] begin to make sense to you that's right
[49:25] absolutely it's just why there's certain
[49:26] little things that sometimes that we
[49:28] maybe don't understand even when brother
[49:30] BR talked about coming to the house of
[49:32] God early okay that's not a law I want
[49:36] you to understand this that's not
[49:38] something that comes along and says oh
[49:40] the you're a bride and you're not that's
[49:41] not what it is at all but he's giving us
[49:43] admonition that for everything that is
[49:46] around us something that we may not even
[49:49] understand but there's a value in it
[49:52] it's a little thing absolutely but
[49:55] there's a value in it you understand
[49:57] that that's what Grace is there's
[49:58] certain things it isn't about if you do
[50:00] this if you don't do this bless God
[50:02] you're not in the bride you're not going
[50:04] to no it's not that there's little
[50:06] things that make a
[50:09] difference we're living in an hour where
[50:12] sometimes where it's looked at the
[50:13] little things don't mean much but it
[50:15] does mean much to God yes it does if you
[50:18] say brother Samuel show me that in the
[50:20] scripture he said he was not forgetful
[50:23] to overlook a cup of water being given
[50:27] to one who was in thirst and that's not
[50:30] even a bride
[50:32] type are you with me that's not even a
[50:34] bride type when was I naked and you
[50:36] clothed me when was I hungry and you fed
[50:38] me that's not even the bride that's
[50:41] those who will stand at the white Throne
[50:42] judgment and be granted to enter into
[50:45] life how much more for you and I God
[50:47] helped me to be observant of his needs
[50:50] help me to care about that help me not
[50:52] to be so consumed with life itself
[50:56] that we forget the little
[50:59] things that's what the love of God does
[51:01] this is why you had you sat down with
[51:03] your husband with your wife cuz
[51:05] sometimes you have to sit down and be
[51:07] reminded and reminisce where things got
[51:09] off the rails from little things simple
[51:13] little things everybody stay with
[51:17] me you wer until I got there
[51:21] right watch this let's take it this way
[51:23] that the unlearned one understand
[51:26] if you love your wife right I love my
[51:28] wife real good well if there was such a
[51:30] thing if some other woman would come up
[51:31] and say Billy I love you too she might
[51:33] be a pretty girl and she'd say I love
[51:35] you well she wouldn't do it he said but
[51:38] what what would I tell her I'd say look
[51:40] sister kneel down here a minute I want
[51:41] to pray with you a little bit well you
[51:43] say Bill you're in Africa Asia somewhere
[51:46] your wife would never know it that might
[51:49] be true and if she never did know it I'd
[51:52] know it I would know it and another
[51:55] other thing if I love her the right way
[51:58] if she loves me so much she'd forgive me
[52:01] that's what you'd say that may be so too
[52:04] but I love her too much to do it that's
[52:09] Grace not nothing i' done but it's just
[52:13] my love for her and that's the way our
[52:15] love is to Christ when we've been born
[52:18] again and realized that we're Sons and
[52:20] Daughters of God it ain't me have to do
[52:22] this have to do that Paul said all
[52:24] things to me are lawful but not all
[52:27] expedient
[52:29] right amen amen right amen amen so it
[52:34] now it comes into a different place to
[52:37] where it's not just where we're we're
[52:38] not under you can do this you can't do
[52:40] that but it's evaluating even the things
[52:43] in our lives that could be
[52:46] absolutely permissible you see this is
[52:49] where maturity comes to where it now
[52:51] raises to a place to it's not just
[52:53] something about is this against the word
[52:55] or not there's a lot of things that yes
[52:57] as we grow there's certain things we
[52:58] grow and we learn and God brings us to
[53:01] the attention but it goes to even deeper
[53:03] than that that if there are things that
[53:05] we can look in our life and say Lord
[53:07] what do you say about this like brother
[53:10] BR he wanted to be a hunter and a
[53:11] Trapper is that right what's sinful
[53:13] about being a hunter and Trapper nothing
[53:15] unless it takes away from serving God if
[53:19] it hinders in any way from him being
[53:23] effective to what God called him to do
[53:25] do and that's where we are called to as
[53:27] Sons and Daughters of God oh my brother
[53:30] Samuel I want to talk about the adoption
[53:32] that's what I'm talking about well I
[53:33] want to talk about speaking storms and
[53:35] storms out of existence hey there's
[53:37] storms come in your life come in my life
[53:39] and we've got to stand as Sons and
[53:40] Daughters of God and speak to those
[53:44] storms Amen to be able to look at things
[53:48] as it comes around our life and it's not
[53:50] looking at it of what's sinful and
[53:51] what's not it's even looking at in a
[53:53] manner of is will this edify Christ in
[53:57] me will it edify my family will this
[54:01] Choice encourage my familyes walk in
[54:05] God hello I'm talking about adopted Sons
[54:08] and Daughters of God so it isn't some
[54:11] law that I have to preach the gospel
[54:14] isn't some law I have to do this it's
[54:16] because I love him so much I just love
[54:19] to do it and if you love him like that
[54:21] as long as I love my wife like that she
[54:23] don't never have to worry
[54:25] as long as she loves me like that she
[54:27] don't have to worry we don't go around
[54:29] one another and say now listen here Mr
[54:31] brandom tell you something right now
[54:33] you're going away on a trip I'm going to
[54:35] lay the law right down on you don't you
[54:37] run around on me young man don't you do
[54:40] that and after she gets done laying down
[54:41] the law then I turn around and say now
[54:43] my fair lady let me tell you something
[54:45] while I'm gone don't you have no other
[54:47] husbands don't you do this don't you do
[54:49] that brother B says see I just love her
[54:51] so much my trust is in herah in another
[54:55] place he says what kind of home would
[54:58] that
[54:59] be amen what kind of home would that be
[55:02] aren't you glad that he's prepared a
[55:05] place living in the Realms of Grace
[55:09] We're not living under a law if you're
[55:11] still living under fear you're still
[55:13] living God doesn't want you to live
[55:15] there God wants you to live in the
[55:17] freedom and the Liberty to where from
[55:20] within your full desire is to please him
[55:24] amen is that right and then even as our
[55:27] lives to even look and evaluate through
[55:29] our lives God wants us to be able to
[55:31] look as Sons and Daughters of God and
[55:34] say Lord in my life this domain that
[55:37] you've placed me over my home and my job
[55:40] and other things because you know
[55:41] there's decisions that you've got to
[55:42] make sometimes you could easily get
[55:45] yourself so tangled up and no doubt we
[55:47] all have made mistakes we've got
[55:50] entangled with things and we've
[55:51] overcommitted oursel we've committed
[55:53] ourselves in areas of ways to where it's
[55:55] affected sometimes it hasn't maybe taken
[55:57] you out of the house of God but when you
[55:58] come to the house of God you're so wore
[56:01] out listen it hasn't been because
[56:03] something has been mandated sometimes
[56:05] it's been from our overc
[56:07] commitment is that right we all know how
[56:09] we are I can get that done in two hours
[56:10] two hours turns into two
[56:13] months right but what do we do oh oh oh
[56:16] what do I do well we learn from that
[56:18] Lord help me to learn help me to be
[56:19] sensitive help me not to overcommit
[56:21] myself why because even my spirit I
[56:25] don't want to just be here physically in
[56:26] my body and weary in my spirit I know he
[56:29] can help me I witnessed that amen how
[56:32] many witnesses I got here that he's
[56:34] helped me when I've been weary in my
[56:35] spirit but I don't want to be that way
[56:37] and I know sometimes there's things we
[56:38] can't help but God help us as Sons and
[56:41] Daughters of God I want to give my very
[56:43] best to
[56:44] him decisions that I make that are not
[56:47] about Sin of doing this oh this is right
[56:50] this no it's decision that I look at to
[56:52] say God I want you to be glor glorified
[56:55] in my life and you know what if there's
[56:58] something where it's come along a trap
[57:01] well listen God's here to Spring traps
[57:04] amen now the Trap itself doesn't mean
[57:07] that God just takes the Trap away but
[57:09] say God help me right and he'll lead you
[57:11] out of that he'll give you Grace to
[57:13] overcome that and say God help me that I
[57:17] won't make that same mistake again
[57:20] because why the same trap will be
[57:22] presented itself once again you will you
[57:26] you and I both we know that you'll be
[57:27] presented with it once again why so that
[57:30] God can manifest just as you overcome to
[57:32] get out of the Trap that when it comes
[57:34] along again there's Grace that manifest
[57:37] to where you might be pulled this way or
[57:40] pulled that way reasonings can come what
[57:42] will your family take or you ought to do
[57:44] this for this but there is something
[57:45] that stands what does my Lord
[57:48] say you love
[57:50] him oh god let's live in the Realms of
[57:53] Grace let's live as Sons and Daughters
[57:56] of God Amen let's bow our heads in order
