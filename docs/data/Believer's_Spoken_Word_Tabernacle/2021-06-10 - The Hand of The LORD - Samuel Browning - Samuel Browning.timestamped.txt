[39:40] in the precious name of the lord jesus
[39:42] christ
[39:44] amen god bless you tonight
[39:50] we just invite you to the word of the
[39:54] lord
[40:02] what if you'll go with me to second
[40:04] second kings chapter 3
[40:07] verse 14.
[40:12] it's a little different than what we
[40:13] speaking on here on thursday night and
[40:15] even what i had planned
[40:16] to speak of but he had other plans
[40:21] we're always open to that amen
[40:25] so let's look at this in second kings
[40:28] chapter 3
[40:30] verse 14. and elisha said
[40:35] as the lord of hosts liveth for whom i
[40:38] stand
[40:40] surely were it not that i regard the
[40:42] presence of jehoshaphat
[40:44] the king of judah i would not look
[40:47] toward thee
[40:48] nor see them but now bring me a minstrel
[40:52] came to pass when the minstrel played
[40:56] that the hand of the lord came upon him
[41:00] he said thus saith the lord
[41:03] make this valley full of ditches
[41:07] for thus saith the lord you shall not
[41:09] see wind
[41:10] neither shall you see rain yet the
[41:13] valley shall be filled with water
[41:16] that ye may drink both ye your cattle
[41:19] and your beasts this is but a light
[41:22] thing in the sight of the lord
[41:24] he will deliver the moabites also
[41:28] into your hand you shall smite every
[41:31] fence
[41:31] city every choice city and shall fell
[41:35] every good
[41:36] tree and stop all wells of water
[41:40] and mar every good piece of land with
[41:43] stones
[41:45] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[41:48] of the word as you're being seated
[41:51] i'd like to just speak here just a few
[41:52] moments this evening
[41:55] on the hand of the lord
[41:58] and when we look at it here
[42:02] in the scripture in this particular
[42:06] setting in this background we look at
[42:09] something that as it as it was
[42:12] there was a wrongful alliance that had
[42:15] taken
[42:16] place jehoshaphat
[42:19] and you think of what was what was going
[42:21] on in the time
[42:22] of israel there had already come a
[42:25] division
[42:26] within the land of israel and here it
[42:29] was
[42:30] that there was an alliance that was made
[42:33] and jehoshaphat you you would look at
[42:36] this and many times it's so
[42:38] it can be some sometimes so easy for us
[42:41] to look at it and say
[42:43] jehoshaphat you did this before
[42:48] this happened before with ahab but you
[42:51] see
[42:52] it goes to show that it's not god is not
[42:55] asking you or i neither can we rely
[42:59] upon our own ability we can't even rely
[43:03] on looking back upon our own memories
[43:05] and upon different things
[43:07] but yet here it shows the very need for
[43:10] the discernment
[43:12] of the spirit of god you see what what
[43:15] jehoshaphat was looking at was the same
[43:17] thing
[43:18] that he had looked at before it looked
[43:21] as though that this would be
[43:23] the right thing to do it seemed like
[43:26] that this was right on it just
[43:27] it just felt right and you remember
[43:30] how that even that jehoshaphat himself
[43:33] he says the same thing regarding
[43:35] this particular thing as he did when it
[43:38] came down to that of ahab and he said
[43:41] i am as thou art my horses
[43:44] are your horses my people are your
[43:47] people
[43:48] and yet with what jehoshaphat was saying
[43:52] he was failing to examine it by the word
[43:55] of god
[43:56] because there was already god cannot
[44:00] bless what he's cursed you see
[44:03] god god has a standard and god won't
[44:06] compromise it and so
[44:08] here you find that you know jehoshaphat
[44:11] is sitting in a place
[44:12] very similar to what it was when he was
[44:15] standing there with ahab that time
[44:17] and remember with ahab it was it was
[44:20] actually the mercy of god that
[44:22] moved upon jehoshaphat in that moment
[44:25] when all of the hundreds of prophets of
[44:29] of baal were prophesying and telling
[44:32] ahab
[44:32] go on up the lord is with thee and yet
[44:36] it did not matter the multitude and how
[44:39] many that were saying it
[44:41] but here jehoshaphat there was a
[44:43] pulsation
[44:44] in his heart in that moment that asked
[44:47] is there not
[44:48] another one a prophet of the lord that
[44:51] we might inquire
[44:53] by him now to me that said a lot to all
[44:56] the hundreds that
[44:57] were saying go on up the lord is with
[44:59] you but there was something that was
[45:02] there within jehoshaphat and
[45:04] i want to just liken that to the
[45:06] pulsation of the holy spirit
[45:08] within a believer's life that there's
[45:11] something that moves you and i
[45:13] in a time that you may not realize or
[45:16] understand
[45:17] exactly what's going on but you stand
[45:20] there and
[45:20] brother brown called it the holy spirit
[45:22] he said it was like a little buzzer
[45:24] that's in your heart and he told us he
[45:26] said pay attention to that little buzzer
[45:28] he said because
[45:30] he spoke of a man that at one time he
[45:32] had a dog and
[45:33] that man had mined you know and got a
[45:35] lot of gold and all of a sudden that dog
[45:38] began to bark he said because
[45:40] there was actually robbers and thieves
[45:43] that were out there
[45:44] in the bushes but that man did not have
[45:46] the sense
[45:47] to be able to discern that but he had a
[45:50] dog
[45:50] and the dog was there to alert him and
[45:53] he kept telling him shut up tomorrow i'm
[45:55] going to be rich
[45:56] shut up tomorrow i'm going to be rich
[45:58] you see he wanted to drowned out
[46:00] the the voice that was letting him know
[46:03] there is
[46:04] danger lurking in the bushes
[46:07] and eventually the man just shot that
[46:09] dog
[46:10] and what ended up happening you know the
[46:12] rest of the story those of you who'd
[46:13] heard in the message
[46:14] here the robbers came right on in they
[46:17] took the spoil
[46:18] they killed the man and it all was all
[46:21] because
[46:22] he failed to pay attention to the simple
[46:25] little warnings of the dog you see
[46:29] god has placed that even within an
[46:32] individual
[46:33] you see many times like you look at with
[46:35] science science so
[46:36] you know we know within our own body
[46:39] that you have that of you know
[46:40] adrenaline and different things
[46:42] will kick in you'll even take take of
[46:44] things of how that
[46:45] you know there's a part within our our
[46:47] adrenals and different things like that
[46:49] to where
[46:50] it's it's it's it's a fear or fight or
[46:53] flight and
[46:54] those things will take place and yet
[46:55] there's a protection
[46:57] that is within that in the natural you
[46:59] know there's been around sometimes where
[47:01] there's things that
[47:02] you know it's just you need to get out
[47:04] of there is that right
[47:05] and yet within that in the natural how
[47:08] much greater
[47:09] in the spiritual that god would speak
[47:12] and would warn his children and would
[47:14] deal with hearts and lives
[47:16] and and to think of it that in the midst
[47:19] of this time
[47:20] that jehoshaphat like he did before he
[47:23] almost got
[47:24] killed in that battle but i believe with
[47:26] all of my heart
[47:27] it was because jehoshaphat was able to
[47:30] humble himself
[47:32] and in the midst of it all and say is
[47:34] there not
[47:35] one more the request
[47:38] for hearing one more is what spared
[47:42] jehoshaphat he went on into that battle
[47:45] but god
[47:46] recognized and honored the humility that
[47:49] he would humble
[47:50] himself to the voice of god even though
[47:53] he was in a wrongful alliance
[47:55] but god stepped on the scene and
[47:57] delivered jehoshaphat then
[48:00] we find in this particular setting in
[48:02] this situation
[48:03] that is here we find within this
[48:06] alliance here
[48:07] here here comes a place it was it was
[48:10] unadvised
[48:12] it was jehoshaphat never got spiritual
[48:15] counsel
[48:16] to unite himself there with jordan he
[48:19] never
[48:20] got that from god whatsoever you see
[48:22] this is the very
[48:24] part that even what's happened down
[48:26] through the ages
[48:27] that when the church itself or even an
[48:30] individual gets tangled up
[48:32] it's because they fail to heed to the
[48:35] word of almighty god
[48:37] you see sometimes our feelings can feel
[48:39] so real
[48:40] but our feelings are not to be what we
[48:43] go by
[48:44] sometimes our thoughts on things and
[48:46] everything else around us and
[48:48] oh i see this sign and i see this sign
[48:50] but there is
[48:51] nothing that is the absolute outside of
[48:54] the word of god
[48:55] that's why with every feeling that's why
[48:57] with every dream
[48:59] that's why with every vision it must
[49:01] come back
[49:02] to the word and if the word doesn't
[49:04] stand behind it
[49:06] then we cast down our feelings no matter
[49:08] how right they feel
[49:10] no matter how anything is we cast it
[49:12] down
[49:13] because the word is what is to have the
[49:16] ultimate preeminence
[49:18] in our lives so we find that within this
[49:22] of where here that jehoshaphat they come
[49:25] into
[49:26] this place that how they have journeyed
[49:30] and now they're asking you know they're
[49:32] asking for
[49:33] that there would be one jehoshaphat says
[49:36] is there not one is there not a prophet
[49:40] of the lord that we might inquire
[49:42] by his hand you see there was a need
[49:45] they had gone off without even asking
[49:49] god
[49:52] oh my god i tell you brother sister
[49:54] we'll always get in trouble
[49:56] when we go without asking god
[49:59] that's true we've got our five senses in
[50:02] our flesh
[50:02] we've got the five senses in our spirit
[50:06] but never are we to take any one of
[50:08] those
[50:09] above the word of god if it speaks
[50:12] with the word then we will say amen
[50:16] but when it is against the word we will
[50:19] deny
[50:19] that this is why here we stand in this
[50:22] hour the greatest battle ever fought
[50:24] and how that there are tests and things
[50:27] that can come our way
[50:28] and you see the enemy the whole thing
[50:30] the tests the trials
[50:31] every temptation that comes our way it
[50:34] is a test
[50:35] whether or not we are going to stand on
[50:37] the word of almighty god or if the enemy
[50:40] can pull us this way
[50:42] or he can pull us this way any way that
[50:44] he can pull us
[50:45] in any way wrongful alliances sometimes
[50:48] it's wrongful thoughts
[50:50] it's wrongful thinking it's wrongful
[50:52] action it is an
[50:53] alliance because before we can ever act
[50:56] out in a certain way
[50:57] we've actually had to receive a thought
[51:00] maybe it's a thought that the enemy is
[51:02] shot in
[51:03] and all of a sudden you've been taking
[51:04] it in taking it in then another thought
[51:07] comes and the
[51:08] complex begins to be built out in your
[51:10] life and here
[51:11] actions start coming out this way
[51:13] action's this way what is it
[51:15] it's a wrongful alliance the bible says
[51:18] cast
[51:19] down imagination bring every thought
[51:22] in subjection to the obedience of christ
[51:26] here they are out there journeying seven
[51:29] days
[51:29] and they come into a place and there's
[51:32] no water
[51:34] my goodness when god let israel out of
[51:37] egypt
[51:38] god had the water provided amen
[51:41] israel you see what god leads you to do
[51:44] god does not ask you then
[51:46] to provide and make a way but whatever
[51:49] god's will is
[51:51] it's god who makes a way is that right
[51:54] and you find that they're out there
[51:55] without any water you know what water's
[51:57] a type of don't you
[51:59] a water water is a type of the holy
[52:01] ghost
[52:02] you see any time but a church or an
[52:05] individual
[52:05] they get away from that word they get
[52:08] away from the word of god
[52:09] and i'm not just talking about the
[52:11] letter because the letter
[52:12] killeth but the spirit giveth life
[52:15] because the word itself you can't
[52:17] separate the word
[52:19] from god because god is the word you
[52:22] can't
[52:22] separate the word from the holy ghost
[52:25] because the holy ghost
[52:26] is the word of promise made real
[52:30] in that hour to the believer and in the
[52:32] believer
[52:33] and through the believer so it is the
[52:35] word itself
[52:36] that is wrapped up in the life of the
[52:39] believer
[52:40] god has promised water in this
[52:43] generation
[52:44] god has promised water for the believer
[52:47] god himself
[52:48] provides for us just exactly what we
[52:50] need of
[52:51] i tell you i don't believe tonight
[52:53] anybody in here wants some old dried up
[52:55] formal thing i don't believe nobody
[52:57] desires that
[52:58] we desire the real refreshing of the
[53:01] spirit
[53:02] of the living god in our lives we do not
[53:04] want our lives going out
[53:06] in their own way but yet god in his
[53:09] mercy
[53:10] if we should start to go in an area or a
[53:13] channel where we should not
[53:15] immediately we find the spirit of god
[53:17] pulling back and it's as though
[53:19] that lord where are you lord where are
[53:22] you now we know there's times of testing
[53:24] but yet bearing that for a life of a
[53:27] believer
[53:28] it is something about it that when you
[53:30] get away
[53:31] from the presence of god it doesn't
[53:33] matter if it's a day
[53:34] it doesn't matter if things have piled
[53:36] into your life maybe through the
[53:37] activities of the day
[53:39] or the cares or or things that's upon
[53:41] your life it's something about it to a
[53:43] believer
[53:44] it bothers you when you know you've not
[53:47] been
[53:47] in the presence of god because why it's
[53:50] in his
[53:51] presence there is fullness of joy
[53:54] amen it's in his presence there is life
[53:58] it's in his presence there's power
[54:00] there's authority
[54:02] there's joy
[54:05] glory be to god and i look at this here
[54:08] tonight and i think of how even in the
[54:11] midst of the time
[54:12] of how when this situation arises how
[54:15] that the king of israel at that time
[54:17] this listen let me tell you something
[54:19] they knew brother brown puts it like
[54:21] this
[54:21] they had all the writings of the
[54:23] prophets they knew all the songs
[54:26] they knew all the commandments but they
[54:28] needed
[54:29] something greater to address the real
[54:32] problem
[54:34] are you with me there was a problem that
[54:37] was there and you look at how that the
[54:38] king of israel
[54:40] will stand there in the midst of that
[54:41] time how
[54:43] how how alive here with withdrawal
[54:46] with with joram or jerome however you
[54:48] would say it
[54:49] as he stands there and he says well
[54:51] god's brought us all together here
[54:52] to kill us all what an unscriptural
[54:55] person
[54:56] an unscriptural man doesn't even know
[54:58] where he's standing at
[55:00] there should never be any that would
[55:02] venture without authority
[55:04] when you venture without authority
[55:06] you're presuming
[55:07] that god doesn't work by guesses and i
[55:10] hope so and
[55:11] maybe that ain't how god works god works
[55:14] according to his word
[55:16] his word is sure god is sure and god
[55:19] brings a sure experience
[55:20] god brings a sure reality and a heart so
[55:23] that you and i can stand there
[55:25] in the midst of opposition in the midst
[55:28] of every situation
[55:29] and say i know in whom i have believed
[55:32] and i'm persuaded that he is able to
[55:35] keep that which i've committed unto him
[55:37] against today
[55:39] but here you know you would think that
[55:42] it would have
[55:43] more of an understanding with that but
[55:45] you see when you look at this
[55:47] here they call within the midst of it
[55:50] they're calling for a prophet of god
[55:52] they want one
[55:53] who has contact with god now let's look
[55:56] at this for a moment
[55:58] elisha was one this is what he's known
[56:01] as
[56:02] one who poured water on the hands of
[56:05] elijah
[56:07] you see there was an honor there was a
[56:09] respect
[56:10] and how think of this reputation when
[56:12] the request is made
[56:14] for a prophet of god that we might
[56:16] inquire of the lord
[56:17] here stood elisha he was he was a
[56:21] channel that god would use within that
[56:24] time
[56:24] and that hour and here's what his
[56:26] reputation this
[56:27] is what he's known there's a lot of
[56:29] reputations that a person could have
[56:31] but what greater reputation could a
[56:33] person have
[56:34] like that of elisha to say i have poured
[56:37] hands
[56:38] or water on the hands of elijah
[56:41] he was known you see he was associated
[56:44] not just around elijah but he was one
[56:47] that poured water
[56:48] on the hands of elijah elisha was known
[56:52] not as one who was just around the
[56:54] message or around the church
[56:56] but elisha remember he received a double
[56:59] portion of the spirit
[57:00] before elijah went off the scene the
[57:03] burden of the elijah ministry
[57:06] was to prepare a way that the spirit of
[57:09] god
[57:10] might come back on the church of the
[57:12] living god
[57:13] and how that god operated and worked
[57:16] through elijah's life
[57:17] and elisha responded to that working and
[57:20] received of a double portion
[57:22] of the spirit of almighty god i tell you
[57:25] one thing
[57:26] you realize for sure is here when when
[57:29] when elisha stands there before him you
[57:31] know he comes up and
[57:33] he lets him know he says i wouldn't even
[57:35] be here
[57:37] but the only reason i'm going to stand
[57:39] here is because jehoshaphat's here
[57:43] you see he was recognizing this is a
[57:45] statement that's being made
[57:47] god himself did not come on the scene
[57:51] because the king of israel was there
[57:54] because the king of israel it wasn't
[57:57] going to change him
[57:58] even to see the miraculous it wouldn't
[58:01] turn him around
[58:03] this is why many can see the miraculous
[58:06] and god moving and
[58:07] god speak into hearts it won't move them
[58:10] that continue to be the same way
[58:12] still given the idolatry all of their
[58:14] own thoughts all of their own thinking
[58:16] worshiping their own ideas but it's
[58:18] something about a child of god you see
[58:20] when god comes down god's coming down
[58:23] because his attributes are here
[58:25] and god comes down to fellowship with
[58:28] his attributes
[58:29] it's you and i that have need of god and
[58:32] god looks down
[58:33] beyond beyond everything and says
[58:35] they've got a need of me
[58:36] i must come down and minister to their
[58:39] need
[58:40] it's wonderful of the time that we have
[58:42] fellowship with god
[58:44] and you realize you and i can never have
[58:46] fellowship with god
[58:48] outside of the blood that has made a way
[58:50] and the spirit of god
[58:52] that has come back upon our lives to
[58:54] quicken that seed
[58:55] on the inside and bring forth the son
[58:58] and daughter of god
[58:59] that brings us in to fellowship with
[59:02] almighty god
[59:03] then it's god's fellowshipping with his
[59:06] attributes sons
[59:07] and daughters of almighty god but
[59:09] there's times that sometimes
[59:11] the attributes they need god to come on
[59:14] the scene
[59:14] there's a situation that maybe they're
[59:17] in a situation
[59:18] that's perplexing their life but god
[59:21] does not come down because of our flesh
[59:23] god does not come down because of our
[59:25] spirit although we may need ministering
[59:28] to in our flesh
[59:29] healing in our flesh we might need
[59:31] healing even in our spirit
[59:32] but god comes down to minister to the
[59:35] attribute
[59:36] because when the attribute is able to
[59:39] actually
[59:40] catch a hold of the living god it will
[59:42] bring strength in our spirit
[59:44] it will bring strength in our body
[59:46] because other than that
[59:48] we would give it go right through us we
[59:50] never catch it
[59:52] but god comes down in respect of his
[59:55] word
[59:57] glory be to god if it wasn't for that
[59:59] that of the king of judah
[1:00:01] i wouldn't even look at you
[1:00:05] it's some pretty tough words isn't it
[1:00:07] one thing you take from that
[1:00:08] god don't waste time
[1:00:11] come on now god said you know what i
[1:00:14] hear i keep pouring in pouring in let me
[1:00:16] tell you something
[1:00:17] even when you look at brother d mister
[1:00:18] carrie when he was up to remember he
[1:00:20] kept saying
[1:00:21] oh i'm looking for a revival to shake
[1:00:23] chicago a revival to shake chicago
[1:00:26] and brother brian will come right and
[1:00:27] stand on the platform and turn around
[1:00:29] and look there uh i mean
[1:00:31] not ne demas but brother joseph matson
[1:00:33] jose forgive me
[1:00:34] he would turn right around and look at
[1:00:35] him and said now brother joseph what
[1:00:37] you've been praying for
[1:00:38] a revival to hit the city he said it has
[1:00:42] hit the city he said that god never
[1:00:44] promised
[1:00:45] to shake everything he never promised to
[1:00:48] shake the cannon fodder
[1:00:50] he promised to come and deal with his
[1:00:52] children
[1:00:53] now what a precious thing it is tonight
[1:00:56] if the word is dealt with your heart
[1:00:58] if the word is moved upon your life if
[1:01:01] the word has drawn you
[1:01:03] brother you have got true riches that's
[1:01:05] greater than anything of this world
[1:01:07] the rest can look at it it'll go on by
[1:01:10] but there's something about it
[1:01:12] it has meaning to your life
[1:01:16] glory be to god and here's to
[1:01:19] jehoshaphat
[1:01:21] look into elisha and elisha makes a
[1:01:24] request here
[1:01:27] i appreciate this honesty of elisha he
[1:01:30] said bring me now a minstrel
[1:01:34] bring me a minstrel he was all out of
[1:01:36] sorts
[1:01:38] he was an ordained channel of god
[1:01:42] are you with me he was a channel that
[1:01:45] god
[1:01:46] would speak through reveal himself
[1:01:48] through
[1:01:49] but he needed to get his spirit
[1:01:52] and the atmosphere right amen
[1:01:56] you see this is where as we we see this
[1:01:59] on the minstrel coming
[1:02:00] that minstrel when that minstrel played
[1:02:02] i don't believe they got somebody out of
[1:02:04] a bar room
[1:02:05] i believe with all my heart that there
[1:02:07] was a minstrel there that was in tune
[1:02:09] with god and it began to play
[1:02:13] there you know skillfully begin to play
[1:02:15] it it was not their ability
[1:02:17] that brought this atmosphere changed but
[1:02:19] they begin to play
[1:02:21] there upon that upon that stringed
[1:02:23] instrument you know devils hate stringed
[1:02:25] instruments
[1:02:28] devils hate stringed instruments now
[1:02:30] when you find this of how think of it
[1:02:32] even when
[1:02:33] the evil spirits was upon saul david
[1:02:36] played
[1:02:37] upon the heart and that evil spirit it
[1:02:40] was
[1:02:40] lifted from saul is that right this is
[1:02:43] why at times even in your life
[1:02:45] sometimes you can feel so tied up and
[1:02:47] tied up and
[1:02:48] there's things going on with you know
[1:02:50] the best thing you can do is put on some
[1:02:52] good gospel music
[1:02:54] is to actually begin to put on some
[1:02:55] music because you may not even feel like
[1:02:57] singing
[1:02:58] it might start out with just
[1:02:59] instrumental but you see there's a way
[1:03:01] that's why
[1:03:02] even when you look before there was ever
[1:03:04] a battle the music
[1:03:06] always went before the battle or before
[1:03:08] the ark that's why it's so important
[1:03:11] to being in the house of god getting our
[1:03:13] spirit right
[1:03:14] praying and just praying over the
[1:03:16] service and just
[1:03:17] entering right into the song service and
[1:03:19] and really entering in and say
[1:03:22] lord jesus i'm looking forward to you
[1:03:24] tonight the words that are actually
[1:03:26] being sung begin to worship him begin to
[1:03:29] thank him oh you may not have a need in
[1:03:31] your body tonight but there's a song
[1:03:33] that's being sung
[1:03:35] on healing you can worship him because
[1:03:37] you know him as a healer
[1:03:39] you know what he's done in your life and
[1:03:41] you'll find that through that experience
[1:03:43] in your life
[1:03:44] it'll invite the presence of god right
[1:03:47] down in the service
[1:03:48] right down in a meeting because a
[1:03:50] preacher does not pack it
[1:03:52] in his ipad or his briefcase the meeting
[1:03:55] is not packed that way
[1:03:57] there is a two part that is working
[1:03:59] right here
[1:04:00] if there's not a pull upon the gift of
[1:04:02] god
[1:04:03] if the spirit of god is not moving there
[1:04:06] freely within the hearts of the people
[1:04:08] that kneading will be as stiff
[1:04:10] and stale and starchy oh but when there
[1:04:13] is a flow of the spirit of almighty god
[1:04:17] brother and sister it's unlimited to
[1:04:19] what
[1:04:20] god can do within a meeting like that
[1:04:23] [Applause]
[1:04:25] bring me a minstrel
[1:04:28] oh my and the bible says when it came to
[1:04:31] pass
[1:04:32] when the minstrel began to play that the
[1:04:34] hand of the lord
[1:04:36] came upon him he began to get in harmony
[1:04:40] let me just say it to you and i in this
[1:04:42] age we were out of harmony
[1:04:46] our lives were out of harmony we were
[1:04:49] looking at a music sheet
[1:04:51] but we were out of harmony but god
[1:04:54] himself
[1:04:55] who wrote the music sheet who knows
[1:04:58] where every note
[1:04:59] has been divinely placed and which how
[1:05:01] many counts that it's to hold and
[1:05:03] and where it's to be and the melody god
[1:05:06] himself
[1:05:07] knows what he has laid out within the
[1:05:10] music sheet of his word
[1:05:11] you know it's something about it when
[1:05:13] god begins to fulfill
[1:05:15] his word and glory begins to come down
[1:05:18] you'll find that even as you read over
[1:05:20] in revelations 5 the bible
[1:05:22] says they sung a new song
[1:05:25] the bible would speak of when victory
[1:05:27] would strike there
[1:05:28] the 144 thousand they will not only sing
[1:05:31] the song of moses
[1:05:32] from back there when they cross the red
[1:05:34] sea but they will have the unfolding
[1:05:36] of calvary and the true atonement and
[1:05:39] they will sing the song
[1:05:41] of the lamb brethren it's something
[1:05:42] about it singing in songs
[1:05:45] it means something to a believer and it
[1:05:48] expresses
[1:05:49] victory
[1:05:51] [Applause]
[1:05:53] hallelujah here is standing in this in
[1:05:56] this moment
[1:05:58] they needed to get into the spirit of
[1:06:00] god
[1:06:01] there had to be an atmosphere that's
[1:06:03] changed and god
[1:06:05] in this hour let me just say it to you
[1:06:07] like this
[1:06:08] god came down once again in this hour
[1:06:13] amen so because there was a beat
[1:06:16] that was to be played there were steps
[1:06:20] that were to be made
[1:06:21] in the promises of god and it was a need
[1:06:24] that the church of the living god
[1:06:26] would return fully to the same
[1:06:29] inspiration
[1:06:30] of the holy ghost that was poured out on
[1:06:32] the day of pentecost
[1:06:34] so god himself comes down in the
[1:06:37] fullness of his power
[1:06:38] and what does he do it's not asking you
[1:06:40] and i to get into harmony
[1:06:42] it's god moving in our lives and it
[1:06:44] becomes now god moving in us
[1:06:46] bringing us in harmony with him
[1:06:52] but we must get in the spirit first let
[1:06:55] me just say let me just drop a few
[1:06:57] things here
[1:06:58] you see when the scripture says
[1:07:00] regarding there
[1:07:02] in revelations 1 where john said i was
[1:07:04] in
[1:07:05] the spirit on the lord's day
[1:07:08] you know when you when you consider this
[1:07:11] and thinking about this
[1:07:12] minstrel there's a need that's present
[1:07:15] and it was absolute necessity
[1:07:19] necessary that elisha be able
[1:07:22] to enter into the spirit of god before
[1:07:26] visions can happen
[1:07:27] before deliverance can come before
[1:07:29] healing comes
[1:07:30] it must come in to the spirit of god
[1:07:34] before the holy ghost can come it must
[1:07:36] enter in get into
[1:07:38] the spirit of almighty god you see this
[1:07:40] is why
[1:07:41] through the preaching of the word of god
[1:07:43] is to bring us into an atmosphere
[1:07:46] the preacher doesn't create that
[1:07:48] atmosphere it's not altogether the
[1:07:50] congregation
[1:07:51] that creates that atmosphere it's the
[1:07:53] word like it did in genesis 1
[1:07:56] it's the word that sets the atmosphere
[1:07:59] for life
[1:07:59] because it is the word itself that has
[1:08:02] life in it
[1:08:03] and that word oh glory be to god that
[1:08:06] word begins to come forth
[1:08:07] and you might be sent in an atmosphere
[1:08:10] of doubt and discouragement
[1:08:12] and everything's around your life but
[1:08:14] how you sit there and you're listening
[1:08:16] to the word
[1:08:17] and all of a sudden from within you
[1:08:19] begin to say amen to the word
[1:08:21] what's happening darkness is being drove
[1:08:23] back it's being pushed back
[1:08:24] why because the word has life within it
[1:08:28] what you could not see before now the
[1:08:30] word pushes back
[1:08:32] the darkness it keeps on pushing it back
[1:08:35] [Applause]
[1:08:36] they entered into the spirit of god you
[1:08:38] see every word
[1:08:40] every promise of god in him is a
[1:08:43] and a man and every word of god is true
[1:08:46] every word of god is sure is that right
[1:08:49] and so we recognize in the scripture
[1:08:53] just as brother graham said the
[1:08:54] revelations that john
[1:08:56] received on the isle of patmos he must
[1:08:59] first be in the spirit
[1:09:00] and he said just as he was in the spirit
[1:09:02] to receive those revelations
[1:09:04] then we must be in the same spirit
[1:09:07] to receive them and become that
[1:09:10] revelation
[1:09:11] you see every word of god is inspired is
[1:09:14] that right
[1:09:15] that the prophets did not speak
[1:09:18] according to their own minds but they
[1:09:20] spake as they were
[1:09:21] moved upon by the holy ghost so it was
[1:09:24] not the man who was speaking
[1:09:27] but it was the man that was set aside
[1:09:29] and god
[1:09:30] as they would yield to him they would
[1:09:32] begin to speak according to the living
[1:09:34] oracles of almighty god
[1:09:36] they would speak things that was
[1:09:38] contrary to their own understanding
[1:09:40] they would say things that they didn't
[1:09:42] know how it was going to come to pass
[1:09:44] and neither do you need to be able to
[1:09:46] know how it's going to come to pass
[1:09:48] when the spirit of god pulsates in your
[1:09:50] heart
[1:09:51] speak that word take that claim take it
[1:09:54] upon your lips there through your heart
[1:09:56] and speak it out and let god bring it to
[1:09:59] pass
[1:10:01] so every word of god healing and no
[1:10:03] matter what it is
[1:10:05] the baptism of the holy ghost it has to
[1:10:09] be first
[1:10:10] get in the spirit of the author who
[1:10:12] wrote it
[1:10:13] when it says repent and be baptized in
[1:10:16] the name of jesus christ
[1:10:17] for the remission of your sins and you
[1:10:19] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:10:21] enter into the spirit of god and then
[1:10:24] you are under an expectation for the
[1:10:27] spirit of god
[1:10:28] to come down into your life according to
[1:10:31] the word
[1:10:31] you see what entering the spirit does it
[1:10:34] brings
[1:10:35] expectations
[1:10:38] and they're real let me just give you
[1:10:40] this example here
[1:10:42] brother brown would say speak to it like
[1:10:44] this of getting in the spirit i
[1:10:45] i believe this can really really help
[1:10:47] you when we look at this brother ramble
[1:10:49] say
[1:10:50] he said the first step is pray and ask
[1:10:53] god for revelation
[1:10:56] if you find that there's things that you
[1:10:58] look at in your life and
[1:11:00] i don't understand about this or the
[1:11:02] first step is
[1:11:03] pray and ask god for revelation just
[1:11:05] speak personally to it
[1:11:07] just like you would come up here tonight
[1:11:09] and if i told you
[1:11:10] hey go put my bag in my car now most of
[1:11:13] you know what my car is
[1:11:15] now there might be a different car that
[1:11:16] i would have out there and if you were
[1:11:18] looking for the same other car
[1:11:20] and you walked out there and you would
[1:11:21] say oh my goodness uh well where is this
[1:11:23] car
[1:11:24] at well i mean it'd be foolish for you
[1:11:26] to keep walking all over the parking lot
[1:11:28] you have me right here you can come
[1:11:30] right in and say brother samuel
[1:11:31] i will put your bag in your car
[1:11:35] which car do you have and then all i got
[1:11:37] to do
[1:11:38] is tell you the car the color i'll give
[1:11:40] you what you need and when you walk out
[1:11:42] of there
[1:11:43] you can walk there with an authority
[1:11:46] because
[1:11:46] now not only do you know to put it in
[1:11:49] the car
[1:11:49] but now you know what the car is and you
[1:11:52] can walk right there and nothing there
[1:11:54] can stand in your way
[1:11:56] if that's that simple in the natural how
[1:11:58] much more for god
[1:12:00] god don't want you walking out here and
[1:12:02] say well lord what do you want here
[1:12:04] but ask him say god reveal yourself to
[1:12:08] me
[1:12:08] because there is power in revelation
[1:12:12] brother
[1:12:13] the spirit of god is the one who gives
[1:12:15] revelation
[1:12:16] and when that word is being revealed
[1:12:19] there
[1:12:19] step right into it that's getting in the
[1:12:22] spirit
[1:12:24] brother man would stand like this for
[1:12:25] healing in our body
[1:12:28] and he would express he said you know
[1:12:30] he's saying like this
[1:12:31] i'm just going to refer to it he said we
[1:12:33] have all read it countless times
[1:12:36] you know the promises on healing we've
[1:12:37] read it countless times
[1:12:40] but did not get in the spirit when
[1:12:42] reading it
[1:12:43] did we ask god for his spirit to teach
[1:12:46] us the real truth of it
[1:12:47] if we did we'd call the elders confess
[1:12:51] our sins
[1:12:52] be anointed and prayed for and that
[1:12:54] would be that let me just say this
[1:12:56] confessing your sins god don't hide
[1:12:58] nothing from you
[1:13:00] sometimes i've witnessed fat over the
[1:13:02] years of pastoring and even before that
[1:13:04] you'd have somebody say well i don't
[1:13:06] know if there's something wrong in my
[1:13:07] life
[1:13:08] i've been praying god don't play
[1:13:09] peekaboo
[1:13:12] god don't hide something back and say
[1:13:13] aha i got something against you
[1:13:15] guess what it is no god's desire
[1:13:18] is that there be nothing between you and
[1:13:20] him more than
[1:13:22] you desire that
[1:13:25] are you with me and if there's something
[1:13:27] that's there
[1:13:28] the spirit of god hey look the bible
[1:13:31] says that in healing the word healing
[1:13:33] means restore
[1:13:34] and when you look at it you'll never
[1:13:36] find god dealing in condemnation
[1:13:38] he all the spirit of god deals with
[1:13:41] conviction
[1:13:42] that's what the spirit of god will do
[1:13:44] and when conviction
[1:13:45] it's always conviction because of the
[1:13:47] sacrifice
[1:13:48] and it points you away back
[1:13:52] are you with me because god's interested
[1:13:54] in the promises
[1:13:55] being made manifest and applied to our
[1:13:58] lives
[1:13:59] oh my you ought to just say boo devil
[1:14:01] get out of here
[1:14:02] amen you see this is god's desire within
[1:14:05] it
[1:14:05] and the enemy like to keep it all
[1:14:07] scrupled up you know within it well
[1:14:09] maybe you don't have as good of faith
[1:14:11] you got to call the elders of the church
[1:14:12] that's the word of god
[1:14:15] if i needed reinforcement that is the
[1:14:17] word
[1:14:18] i'm not going to sit there in pride and
[1:14:20] say well i'm just going to speak it out
[1:14:22] maybe i need some divine assistance it
[1:14:25] ain't the faith of brother brian
[1:14:26] it ain't the faith of brother bill it
[1:14:28] would be the faith of jesus christ
[1:14:31] that was operating in their life that it
[1:14:33] would unite together
[1:14:34] to drive back that enemy and drive him
[1:14:37] off our ground come on brother and
[1:14:38] sister
[1:14:39] we are the army of the living god it's
[1:14:42] time to stop letting the devil
[1:14:44] isolate us and try to beat us down with
[1:14:46] things
[1:14:47] if we need help from somebody then let
[1:14:49] us reach out
[1:14:50] the bible said confess your faults one
[1:14:53] to another
[1:14:54] and pray that you be healed this is the
[1:14:57] word of the living god
[1:15:00] hallelujah glory be to god in the
[1:15:03] highest
[1:15:04] oh my it might not happen immediately
[1:15:07] but in his spirit
[1:15:08] it's over there's no other court
[1:15:12] of appeal i mean
[1:15:15] we see this in in the world i mean you
[1:15:18] take the world they enter right in they
[1:15:20] enter into the weekend spirit even
[1:15:23] i mean thursday night many of them

[1:15:31] all the of all the stuff that they've
[1:15:32] had in them from

[1:15:43] see it's
[1:15:44] they'll enter right into that and begin
[1:15:46] to get right into that
[1:15:47] this is exactly what the world will do
[1:15:49] the world will enter right into ball
[1:15:51] games
[1:15:53] i've seen people tell me well i'm not
[1:15:54] that emotional get them outside of
[1:15:56] church you can hardly shut them up
[1:15:59] but yet they won't say man i praise god
[1:16:01] inside a church don't tell me about your
[1:16:02] makeup
[1:16:04] come on somebody this is the most
[1:16:06] glorious time
[1:16:08] in reality if there's anything you ought
[1:16:10] to be talking about
[1:16:11] and talking to the lord and say thank
[1:16:13] you lord it's right here
[1:16:15] in the sanctuary of the living god it
[1:16:17] ought to be a time that we're thanking
[1:16:19] god
[1:16:20] for who he is what he's done and what
[1:16:22] he's doing
[1:16:23] we should enter right in to the spirit
[1:16:26] of the living god
[1:16:29] bring me a minstrel
[1:16:32] [Music]
[1:16:33] hallelujah now you see the hand of the
[1:16:36] lord let's look at this just for a few
[1:16:37] moments
[1:16:38] the hand of the lord here it comes in a
[1:16:41] situation
[1:16:43] because there's a need that's among them
[1:16:45] they don't know what to do
[1:16:47] they're without water and they're gonna
[1:16:50] die
[1:16:51] their cattle's gonna die everything is
[1:16:54] going to perish
[1:16:55] unless they get water
[1:17:00] so now it comes to dealing with what it
[1:17:03] is
[1:17:03] that's hindering me they they start out
[1:17:05] in this way but now
[1:17:07] what it what is it that's hindering you
[1:17:09] see one of the ways that when you
[1:17:10] look at it before the hand of the lord
[1:17:12] ever come there is no
[1:17:14] there is no prophecy or or word of
[1:17:17] deliverance for that situation
[1:17:19] but you see for that need in that
[1:17:21] situation
[1:17:22] god comes present and god does something
[1:17:26] that only he can do oh my
[1:17:30] you see god he will always come
[1:17:33] where there are hearts that are willing
[1:17:35] to cry out in times of need
[1:17:37] the king of israel wasn't asking for a
[1:17:39] prophet of the lord
[1:17:40] but jehoshaphat was asking for it
[1:17:43] jehoshaphat
[1:17:44] wasn't too big to to recognize i'm
[1:17:47] in over my head and i need help from
[1:17:50] almighty god
[1:17:51] you know what this sends a message to
[1:17:52] you and i when you and i come into those
[1:17:55] kind of places
[1:17:56] and unlawful alliances and things maybe
[1:17:59] trying to straighten things out on your
[1:18:01] own or take care of this
[1:18:03] it cannot be with just flesh and blood
[1:18:06] it fails that's why god
[1:18:07] would speak to israel when they would
[1:18:09] want to fall back on egypt
[1:18:11] their chariots and their horses if if
[1:18:13] another nation was coming against them
[1:18:16] but there is nothing can succeed when it
[1:18:19] trusts in the arm of flesh
[1:18:21] but when it can trust and lay our trust
[1:18:24] in the
[1:18:24] arm of almighty god brother that's where
[1:18:28] safety is
[1:18:29] that's where stability is that's where
[1:18:32] peace is that's where the glory is
[1:18:34] that's where the joy of the lord is
[1:18:39] a vision without the hand of the lord
[1:18:42] there is no vision like with ezekiel
[1:18:45] you'll find in the scriptures without
[1:18:46] me reading of places here tonight to
[1:18:49] refer to
[1:18:50] how that the hand of the lord would come
[1:18:52] upon ezekiel
[1:18:53] and pick him up and would carry him and
[1:18:56] and he would see
[1:18:58] hear the wheel in the middle of the
[1:18:59] wheel when the hand of the lord would
[1:19:01] come upon him
[1:19:02] it would pick him up as he says in one
[1:19:04] place by the lock of my hair
[1:19:06] and he would begin to show him in the
[1:19:08] visions of god
[1:19:10] regarding jerusalem he would begin to
[1:19:12] reveal to him
[1:19:13] by the hand of the lord visions of wire
[1:19:16] that israel had gone astray
[1:19:18] and while they were in captivity so the
[1:19:21] hand of the lord
[1:19:22] is not always about glory and power
[1:19:25] but the hand of the lord also moves to
[1:19:28] bring
[1:19:29] and break strongholds to move upon
[1:19:32] hearts and lives and things where a
[1:19:34] person can say
[1:19:36] what's going on but the spirit of god
[1:19:38] can come by way of a vision of his word
[1:19:41] and begin to lift up and and make known
[1:19:43] hey
[1:19:44] here's a pathway or or this is where
[1:19:46] things have gone astray or or this is
[1:19:48] how to get back on track i'm grateful
[1:19:50] for the hand of almighty god
[1:19:52] let me tell you something brother random
[1:19:54] himself when you think of standing there
[1:19:56] and here he he had the vision god gave
[1:19:59] him the vision
[1:20:00] of the of that little finished boy that
[1:20:03] would be that would be raised up when he
[1:20:05] had been killed on the side of the road
[1:20:07] there in an accident
[1:20:09] and how that brother brown remember when
[1:20:10] he said he went there
[1:20:12] and as he was going there and he looked
[1:20:14] you know they stop and
[1:20:15] and they see us a situation and brother
[1:20:17] brown goes back now when he even sees
[1:20:19] that little boy
[1:20:20] brother graham said he looked at him he
[1:20:21] said something kind of just kind of
[1:20:24] moving within him like something about
[1:20:26] it i seem like i
[1:20:27] my you know i should know that little
[1:20:28] boy and he brother was just you know
[1:20:30] tore up for the situation and he turned
[1:20:32] and went to walk back to the car that he
[1:20:35] was riding in with brother moore in them
[1:20:37] and he said i felt a hand upon my
[1:20:40] shoulder and he said there wasn't nobody
[1:20:43] that was there
[1:20:44] around me said but the hand that was
[1:20:46] upon my hole my shoulder
[1:20:48] was that of a strength and so brother
[1:20:49] branham turned around and he began to
[1:20:51] think
[1:20:52] where have i seen that little boy before
[1:20:54] and then he sees the trees
[1:20:56] he sees the layout of the mountains and
[1:20:58] all of a sudden things
[1:21:00] begin to come together right there in
[1:21:02] that time
[1:21:03] that he realizes this is what god has
[1:21:06] spoke
[1:21:07] in a vision over in the homeland but
[1:21:09] there would be a little boy raised up
[1:21:11] and he told us go get your bible it's
[1:21:14] rolled in the flower leaf of the bible
[1:21:15] and brother adam would stand there like
[1:21:17] this he said i felt him draw near
[1:21:20] he said it wasn't now all the devils out
[1:21:22] of torment
[1:21:23] couldn't have stopped the vision from
[1:21:26] coming to pass
[1:21:27] why the hand of the lord came upon him
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:33] amen this is it don't miss it this is it
[1:21:36] don't miss it the hand of the lord
[1:21:41] came upon his life hallelujah
[1:21:44] oh think about it friends if not for the
[1:21:46] hand of almighty god
[1:21:48] you and i would miss it how many times
[1:21:50] brother branham's sitting there in the
[1:21:51] service
[1:21:52] and he said oh god they're going to miss
[1:21:54] it lord give me their name and all of a
[1:21:56] sudden their name is called out
[1:21:58] your healing sister or brother you're
[1:22:00] healed receive it
[1:22:01] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:22:03] what was it the hand of the lord that
[1:22:05] was
[1:22:06] present upon the prophet that same hand
[1:22:09] of the lord
[1:22:10] was moved and stretched out to minister
[1:22:13] to the need of his children that were
[1:22:15] right there
[1:22:18] you see god in every age when you think
[1:22:21] of it
[1:22:22] when john would see here in revelations
[1:22:25] 1
[1:22:26] the bible speaks of how john returned to
[1:22:29] see the voice that spoke to him
[1:22:31] it had meaning to his life in john sees
[1:22:34] one
[1:22:34] likened to the son of man walking in the
[1:22:36] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:22:39] he sees feet with you know with brass
[1:22:41] and out of his mouth a
[1:22:42] sharp two-edged sword hair as white as
[1:22:45] wool
[1:22:46] all of these symbols that speak of the
[1:22:49] authority
[1:22:51] of the word of god of the lord jesus
[1:22:54] christ
[1:22:56] and it would be revealed the vision that
[1:22:58] would be
[1:22:59] revealed the testimony of jesus christ
[1:23:01] would not be a vision
[1:23:03] of possum of this might be possible but
[1:23:06] it would be
[1:23:07] a vision to where he would take the very
[1:23:10] life
[1:23:10] out of john when he would see him and he
[1:23:12] would fall down at his feet
[1:23:14] but the bible says he stretched his
[1:23:17] right hand
[1:23:18] and laid it upon me and said fear not
[1:23:21] i tell you when john saw that vision it
[1:23:24] might have taken everything out of him
[1:23:25] think about it
[1:23:26] when the reality of the living god what
[1:23:29] did it do to your life
[1:23:30] when the revelation of jesus christ
[1:23:33] struck your heart brother
[1:23:34] it did away with that old life it
[1:23:36] brought a new life
[1:23:37] on the inside amen it was the right hand
[1:23:41] of almighty god his rack and his power
[1:23:44] and authority brother you just didn't
[1:23:47] have rights
[1:23:48] but you had the authority and the power
[1:23:50] of god
[1:23:51] to begin to live out the rights as a son
[1:23:54] and daughter of god
[1:23:55] why he put his hand upon me
[1:24:01] now in order for that hand to come upon
[1:24:03] our life
[1:24:05] god's desire for his his hand
[1:24:08] which his hand is the fulfillment of his
[1:24:11] word
[1:24:13] when you read in the scripture of how
[1:24:15] that he would speak
[1:24:16] regarding them in egypt that god that
[1:24:20] pharaoh would not let them go not by a
[1:24:22] mighty hand
[1:24:23] it could not be a mighty army that would
[1:24:25] release them
[1:24:26] that would only be temporary there would
[1:24:28] be another army that would rise up
[1:24:30] and bring them back into captivity but
[1:24:33] god let them know
[1:24:34] it will not be by a mighty hand by by
[1:24:37] that the mighty hand of natural
[1:24:38] but it will be but the stretch out arm
[1:24:41] of jehovah
[1:24:42] you know what that speaks of in the word
[1:24:44] the hand of the lord
[1:24:46] the mighty hand of god the right hand of
[1:24:48] god
[1:24:49] the arm of the lord his arm is stretched
[1:24:51] out
[1:24:52] it speaks of god condescending
[1:24:55] and coming personally with his power
[1:24:58] to bring strength to bring life to bring
[1:25:01] deliverance
[1:25:02] to bring vision to bring glory to bring
[1:25:05] healing
[1:25:05] that's what it speaks of through his
[1:25:07] word
[1:25:08] [Applause]
[1:25:09] hallelujah he's not an impersonal god
[1:25:13] [Applause]
[1:25:14] he ain't forgot about your trouble he
[1:25:17] ain't forgot about you
[1:25:19] he's not an onlooker he's governing
[1:25:22] right now
[1:25:23] in the affairs of men he knows right
[1:25:26] where he's at
[1:25:27] he never left you he's right there with
[1:25:30] you
[1:25:30] he's been right there with you the whole
[1:25:32] time when you felt down
[1:25:34] when you felt gloomy david said he knows
[1:25:37] my uprising
[1:25:38] and my down city he already knew all
[1:25:41] about it
[1:25:42] and god with his hand is right there to
[1:25:46] touch our lives
[1:25:49] it was his right hand that parted the
[1:25:52] sea
[1:25:54] his right arm here has him moved to
[1:25:57] parker the sea
[1:25:59] it was his outstretched arm that covered
[1:26:01] the sea
[1:26:02] back over and pharaoh and all of his
[1:26:05] army
[1:26:05] drowned there that day amen
[1:26:10] this is god making himself known
[1:26:14] the same way that god did there god has
[1:26:18] a promise and he cannot fail
[1:26:22] god promised there'll be a bride i'll
[1:26:24] present to my spell
[1:26:26] self without spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:26:29] she is a trophy of my grace
[1:26:34] she's a vessel of my mercy
[1:26:38] amen and i will bring her forth not
[1:26:40] barely making it
[1:26:41] but she will come forth crowned in my
[1:26:44] resurrection glory
[1:26:46] and power will not be one devil be able
[1:26:49] to stick its head up but it'll be
[1:26:51] already put underfoot and manifest in
[1:26:54] the bride of jesus christ
[1:26:56] sometimes you look at situations when
[1:26:58] they come your way
[1:26:59] and you wonder why did this come my way
[1:27:01] because god
[1:27:02] needs to manifest overcoming power
[1:27:05] through your life
[1:27:06] and let the devil know that i am still
[1:27:09] the same jehovah
[1:27:11] i've got people on earth who believe me
[1:27:15] amen and will still let me and invite me
[1:27:19] to be me
[1:27:22] hallelujah in the right hand
[1:27:26] there's seven stars are you with
[1:27:31] right me is power and authority the
[1:27:34] church
[1:27:35] in every age after the message would go
[1:27:38] forth
[1:27:38] calling them to what to the life
[1:27:42] not calling them to a church somewhere
[1:27:44] but calling them to life
[1:27:47] but they would go astray brother said
[1:27:49] you would think he said when you would
[1:27:50] read it
[1:27:51] as he walks in the midst of the seven
[1:27:54] golden candlesticks
[1:27:55] and there is a ministry of ephesians 4
[1:27:57] he said but yet
[1:27:58] you'll find he said that the church
[1:28:00] would go astray
[1:28:02] but god has made a promise he has seven
[1:28:06] stars
[1:28:07] in his right hand seven messengers
[1:28:10] to each one of those ages and what god
[1:28:13] would
[1:28:14] do within that age is god brother brahm
[1:28:16] says it like this i love it
[1:28:18] he said god would bring himself
[1:28:21] on the scene through the ministry of
[1:28:24] those stars
[1:28:26] it would be god bringing himself and the
[1:28:29] life
[1:28:29] yielded to god they would be yielded to
[1:28:32] god
[1:28:32] maybe they at first were part of an
[1:28:34] organization
[1:28:35] but god would begin to reveal his word
[1:28:38] and because they
[1:28:40] were tied to christ there was a
[1:28:43] pulsation
[1:28:44] when the right hand of god would be laid
[1:28:47] upon their life
[1:28:48] they would renounce organization they
[1:28:50] would walk away from it
[1:28:52] and walk with god and withstand the
[1:28:54] devil
[1:28:56] why because the hand of the lord was
[1:28:58] upon their life
[1:29:01] hallelujah god would bring himself
[1:29:04] on the scene he would unfold his power
[1:29:08] and his authority and let me just say it
[1:29:10] to you like this
[1:29:11] that didn't leave when the messenger
[1:29:13] left
[1:29:14] amen if all we've been left is books and
[1:29:17] tapes we're in trouble
[1:29:20] if all we got is quotes we're in trouble
[1:29:24] the devil don't care how right you are
[1:29:26] in your doctrine
[1:29:28] but as long as you miss that life let me
[1:29:30] tell you something the life is a living
[1:29:33] organism it lives
[1:29:36] it expresses itself its pulsation
[1:29:39] there are manifestations of the truth of
[1:29:42] almighty god
[1:29:43] in the church of the living god amen
[1:29:47] hallelujah that's god's promise he said
[1:29:50] he that believeth
[1:29:51] on me as the scripture said out of his
[1:29:54] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[1:29:56] amen he said that he that will believe
[1:29:59] on me the works that i do
[1:30:01] shall you do also amen
[1:30:04] lord be to god that word being revealed
[1:30:07] brother and sister
[1:30:08] the word being revealed oh my the spirit
[1:30:11] of the living god moving in our life oh
[1:30:14] my
[1:30:15] no matter where that you might be
[1:30:17] sitting at but to think how the hand of
[1:30:19] the lord would move down
[1:30:20] upon your life and be with your heart so
[1:30:23] much so
[1:30:24] that there are questions that you could
[1:30:25] have but you could stand there and say
[1:30:28] there ain't no way brother samuel he
[1:30:29] didn't know that or brother andrew
[1:30:31] whoever it wasn't stood there
[1:30:32] they didn't know that but god knew that
[1:30:35] and even if a man knew your need
[1:30:37] it would take more than the intellect of
[1:30:39] a man or the fine words of a man
[1:30:42] a man could not put words together he
[1:30:45] might be able to move you here or move
[1:30:46] you there
[1:30:47] but it takes the spirit of god to place
[1:30:50] your faith
[1:30:51] in god
[1:30:57] no wonder the scripture says in first
[1:31:00] peter 5 i'm coming down
[1:31:05] it would say you younger submit
[1:31:07] yourselves unto the elder
[1:31:09] all of you be subject one to another and
[1:31:12] be clothed with humility for god
[1:31:13] resisted the proud
[1:31:15] and giveth grace to the humble humble
[1:31:18] yourselves therefore
[1:31:19] under the mighty hand of god that he may
[1:31:22] exalt
[1:31:23] you in due time
[1:31:27] humble ourselves under the mighty hand
[1:31:30] of god
[1:31:31] the mighty god moving right here in our
[1:31:34] midst yes
[1:31:36] listen friends to talk about what god
[1:31:38] did back in 1965 will do you no good
[1:31:40] today
[1:31:42] but if you talk about it in a way that
[1:31:44] you say i know what god did back there
[1:31:47] it was only announcing that there were
[1:31:49] more
[1:31:50] in the field that were coming forth
[1:31:53] there's
[1:31:54] more sons and daughters of god that come
[1:31:57] into maturity
[1:31:58] let me just announce to hell we're not
[1:32:00] coming there
[1:32:01] we've arrived
[1:32:05] doom devils are on the run
[1:32:08] come on now amen brother bran was saying
[1:32:12] another place
[1:32:13] be careful satan
[1:32:16] amen there's a people on earth that know
[1:32:19] who they are
[1:32:20] they know where they're standing they
[1:32:22] that know their god
[1:32:23] shall do great exploits why
[1:32:27] the hand of the lord has come we were in
[1:32:30] desperate trouble our lives were all
[1:32:33] clogged up
[1:32:34] with organization and everything else
[1:32:37] you might have been raised right in the
[1:32:38] message
[1:32:39] but still clogged up with unbelief
[1:32:45] but here the spirit of god would move
[1:32:48] down
[1:32:49] and say dig this valley full of ditches
[1:32:53] get everything out of your life that's
[1:32:55] contrary to the word
[1:32:57] it might have been things that the
[1:32:59] enemies wanted to tell you
[1:33:01] about you what should i do kick it out
[1:33:04] just get rid of it
[1:33:05] just throw it right out of your life if
[1:33:07] it's something that says
[1:33:08] you'll never have victory throw that
[1:33:10] thing right out of your life
[1:33:11] what do i do dig that valley full of
[1:33:13] ditches keep digging
[1:33:15] the things that god keeps moving upon
[1:33:17] your heart
[1:33:18] keep digging under the hand of almighty
[1:33:21] god

[1:33:28] amen dig that valley full of ditches
[1:33:31] open up those channels open up
[1:33:33] the hell that the life of god might flow
[1:33:36] down

[1:33:40] not be
[1:33:41] it would not be the sound of rain it
[1:33:43] would not be wind
[1:33:47] they weren't going to hear anything
[1:33:51] but you know what it was the same god
[1:33:55] that walked the same grounds that
[1:33:58] provided for them when they were thirsty
[1:34:00] before
[1:34:01] brother drake that same rock was right
[1:34:04] there
[1:34:05] supernaturally the water of life
[1:34:09] entered what they had dug out the spirit
[1:34:12] of god never dug it out for him
[1:34:15] elisha never came and dug it out for him
[1:34:17] but the hand of the lord gave him
[1:34:19] authority
[1:34:20] there was a need in their life and no
[1:34:23] matter what the enemy has said
[1:34:25] you've got authority to throw it out
[1:34:30] hallelujah to dig it out maybe it's a
[1:34:32] place in your life you say

[1:34:52] surge that begins to move

[1:34:56] making way for the water of god to flow
[1:34:59] down into your life
[1:35:01] amen this is how it comes with every
[1:35:04] life and every heart there must be a
[1:35:06] consecration
[1:35:07] to the voice of almighty god when god's
[1:35:10] hand
[1:35:11] it comes upon that life it's god moving
[1:35:14] to open up vision and through that
[1:35:17] vision now
[1:35:19] as things begin to come back in order
[1:35:20] the power of god will begin to flow
[1:35:23] deliverance begins to move healing
[1:35:26] begins to flow
[1:35:30] all because of the hand of the lord
[1:35:36] you take the hand of the lord from the
[1:35:37] church of the living god
[1:35:39] and she's in trouble that's right but i
[1:35:42] want to remind you
[1:35:44] the hand of the lord is what came upon
[1:35:46] elijah
[1:35:47] and caused him to outrun the chariot of
[1:35:49] ahab
[1:35:52] are you with me amen it's the same hand
[1:35:56] of the lord
[1:35:57] that when there was a drought that god
[1:35:59] had called for
[1:36:00] through elijah when it came time for
[1:36:04] rain to come back upon the land
[1:36:06] elijah said to his servant go look over
[1:36:09] the sea
[1:36:10] he went the first time and looked he
[1:36:12] said i don't see nothing
[1:36:13] elijah said go again came back i don't
[1:36:16] see nothing
[1:36:17] go again he came back i don't see
[1:36:19] nothing go again
[1:36:21] finally on the seventh time
[1:36:24] he saw a cloud
[1:36:29] and when he saw that cloud that cloud
[1:36:32] was in the shape
[1:36:33] of a man's hand let me tell you
[1:36:36] something
[1:36:37] it's not a coincidence that out there
[1:36:40] on sunset mountain amen that the cloud
[1:36:44] of the lord in this hour would come down
[1:36:48] as the hand of the lord as the authority
[1:36:51] of almighty god
[1:36:52] come into the church of the living god
[1:36:55] that would let the church of the living
[1:36:57] god
[1:36:58] know there are channels to be cleared
[1:37:00] out we couldn't clear them out
[1:37:02] with seminary experiences we can't clear
[1:37:04] them out
[1:37:05] just with knowledge of quotes it takes
[1:37:08] the authority
[1:37:09] and power of almighty god
[1:37:15] takes the hand of the lord

[2:02:04] and then i said i gotta watch if i touch
[2:02:05] anything it would spread even further
[2:02:07] so then uh when sam was praying and then
[2:02:09] when he finished i looked up there the
[2:02:11] blisters were gone
[2:02:13] i also i went to the doctor and he said

[2:02:18] saw him uh
[2:02:19] today he said it's not as bad as i
[2:02:21] thought it was going to be worse than
[2:02:22] what he said it was but he said
[2:02:24] no i said stage one he said wiggy said
[2:02:26] he used to have 42 treatments
