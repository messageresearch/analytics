[29:28] hallelujah
[29:29] [Music]
[29:31] hallelujah
[29:33] that becomes more real
[29:36] amen you know the longer that you
[29:39] as you serve the lord
[29:41] the more and more you realize it's
[29:43] it really has nothing to do with you
[29:47] the more and more when we recognize that
[29:50] we realize that when we see that that it
[29:52] has nothing to do about us
[29:54] the more we want to give ourselves to
[29:56] him because he's the one
[29:58] to perform it
[30:01] and you know that's all that that's all
[30:02] god asked of us when he
[30:05] god had already
[30:08] already chosen moses
[30:11] to be the servant that he would use
[30:13] before the foundation of the world
[30:16] but god had to get moses in a place to
[30:19] recognize
[30:21] that he needed
[30:23] god
[30:24] he didn't just need to know about god
[30:27] need to know about the promise but he
[30:29] needed to know god
[30:31] and when moses met god in that way
[30:35] god revealed to him
[30:37] i'm the deliverer
[30:39] i'm come down
[30:40] to deliver the people
[30:42] now come i will send thee
[30:45] you know that's the greatest that's the
[30:47] greatest thing that god moves upon our
[30:50] lives is for us to recognize
[30:52] our weaknesses
[30:54] you know not only in coming to that of
[30:56] the new birth to a real surrender like
[30:58] moses did
[31:00] and each of us
[31:02] but it's also even after that
[31:04] recognizing
[31:05] our weaknesses
[31:07] our weaknesses
[31:09] and recognizing where we're too strong
[31:12] but where we are weak
[31:15] he is strong
[31:17] and that's just looking to god and just
[31:20] as the song the words of this song would
[31:22] say
[31:23] what an empty place if not for grace
[31:26] you know it's one thing a person could
[31:28] have a life that's so cleaned up
[31:30] so pristine
[31:32] you could say well
[31:34] not doing this and not doing that but
[31:36] yet if that place is not filled
[31:39] it's still empty
[31:41] you know many times we walk by you see
[31:43] rental properties and houses and we've
[31:45] moved out of houses each one of us
[31:47] apartments and so forth
[31:49] and before you can ever come into the
[31:51] other house or into the apartment you've
[31:53] got to get the stuff out of there
[31:55] [Music]
[31:56] sometimes people rip up the carpeting
[31:58] and the flooring and they they take
[32:00] things out so they can put their things
[32:02] in
[32:02] and god cleans god takes from that life
[32:05] and the real taking of it
[32:07] is god's not wanting to so move into
[32:10] that same place
[32:11] god wants to bring it to a place to
[32:13] where it says lord i want nothing
[32:16] but you
[32:18] and when that comes to that place then
[32:20] god steps in and god says
[32:23] this is not the house that i built but
[32:25] let me raise up my own house
[32:27] and god raises up that house that seed
[32:30] on the inside that there's a desire
[32:32] that's pulsated to serve god
[32:35] for a long time a desire to say there's
[32:38] a got to be a god somewhere there's a
[32:40] reality
[32:41] and god placed that there

[44:35] scriptures this morning
[44:37] as we come to encourage one another
[44:39] let's refer from deuteronomy
[44:42] the fifth book of moses
[44:44] let's read some few things from there
[44:46] woman could the other one say
[44:52] maybe we will read also from matthew
[44:57] 28
[44:59] so we go to deuteronomy chapter seven
[45:10] let's save time to read from verse 17
[45:16] if thou shalt say in thy heart
[45:20] these nations are more than i
[45:24] how can i dispossess
[45:27] them
[45:30] thou shalt never be afraid of them
[45:34] but shall we remember
[45:38] what the lord thy god did
[45:40] unto pharaoh
[45:43] and unto all egypt
[45:47] the great temptations
[45:49] which that i saw
[45:51] and the signs and the wonders
[45:55] and the mighty hand
[45:57] and the stretched out arm
[46:00] whereby the lord thy god brought thee
[46:03] out
[46:04] out
[46:06] so shall the lord thy god do unto all
[46:10] the nations all the people
[46:12] of whom that act afraid
[46:18] amen
[46:19] so we read from matthew let's read a
[46:22] little from matthew
[46:26] matthew 28
[46:33] verse 10
[46:37] then serve jesus unto them
[46:41] be
[46:42] not afraid
[46:45] go tell my brother
[46:48] that they
[46:49] go into galilee
[46:52] and they
[46:53] said they see me
[46:57] let's pray lord once again we thank you
[46:59] for your word
[47:02] we thank you for your faithfulness
[47:05] be with us
[47:06] and minister unto our needs in the name
[47:10] of jesus christ our lord
[47:12] we pray with faith and thanksgiving
[47:15] amen
[47:16] god bless you let's be seated
[47:22] in matthew the same matthew chapter 14
[47:27] when jesus was walking on the sea
[47:31] and the disciples saw him
[47:35] let's verse 25 matthew 14 25
[47:39] and in the fourth watch of the night
[47:42] jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[47:47] and when the disciples saw him walking
[47:50] on the sea they were troubled
[47:54] saying
[47:55] they were troubled
[47:58] saying
[47:59] it is a spirit
[48:00] and they
[48:02] cried out for fear
[48:05] but straight way jesus speak unto them
[48:09] say
[48:11] be of good cheer it is i
[48:14] be not afraid
[48:16] so this morning
[48:18] be not afraid
[48:24] be not afraid
[48:28] we realize we are living in the
[48:32] shaky times
[48:35] troubles hour
[48:38] pandemic
[48:40] troubled years and troubled day
[48:44] so much uncertainties
[48:48] and the scripture says men's hearts
[48:51] are failing for fear
[48:56] men's hearts are failing for fear
[49:00] because nobody even seems to have the
[49:02] answer scientists don't have the answer
[49:06] what leaders don't have the answer
[49:09] we can't remember what we've just gone
[49:11] through and we are still going through
[49:16] when the whole world was paralyzed
[49:20] when men could not even go out
[49:25] when men begin to fear men
[49:30] when husbands and wives were not sure
[49:33] who gave the virus who didn't get it
[49:37] when we were tormented in our minds
[49:43] fear
[49:44] on every hand
[49:48] parents are afraid children are afraid
[49:54] a difficult time
[49:59] when
[50:00] flight flight was southern airport and
[50:04] seaports and land borders everything
[50:06] closed down
[50:09] and
[50:10] nobody knows what is going to happen
[50:12] what is happening
[50:14] until today they have notified the
[50:17] solution
[50:20] and they tried this and we tried that
[50:23] and everything has been tried and this
[50:25] was and this is not working that is not
[50:27] working this and there is trouble
[50:33] oh we want to find a vaccine we want to
[50:35] do this and we try this and and and
[50:39] others it had a fight and others there
[50:41] was a negative effect and oh so where
[50:44] are we going where are we going
[50:48] men's hearts are feeling for fear
[50:51] but jesus said be not afraid
[50:55] don't fear
[50:59] in this flightful time
[51:03] difficult time
[51:06] things that are causing people to get
[51:08] worried our minds are filled with
[51:11] worried
[51:14] and there is fear within
[51:18] don't you see people walking and talking
[51:20] but there is fear within
[51:22] and if you guess someone says
[51:25] oh my god
[51:37] somebody will be binding in jesus name
[51:40] rebuking in jesus name
[51:43] oh my god
[51:46] there is trouble everywhere
[51:49] so where do we go
[51:51] to whom do we tend to
[51:54] come unto me
[51:56] turn unto jesus
[51:59] be not afraid
[52:02] rest assured calm down
[52:08] rest assured
[52:09] he wants us to cast our case on him
[52:15] in these difficult times when medical
[52:19] science
[52:21] has failed
[52:23] and it's failing
[52:26] when the doctors
[52:29] and the scientists themselves are afraid
[52:33] doctors are afraid of their patients
[52:37] and patients are afraid of their doctors
[52:43] everybody is afraid of somebody
[52:48] because it's not written on somebody's
[52:51] forehead that they get a virus
[52:56] and everybody is afraid but let me tell
[52:58] you the most dangerous virus
[53:01] is unbelief
[53:07] the most dangerous virus
[53:10] is unbelief of god's word
[53:14] for if you believe the word of the lord
[53:17] all things are possible
[53:24] may the lord help us believe us
[53:28] in this hour in which we are living
[53:33] the lord jesus said fear not
[53:37] all through the scriptures
[53:39] every time he comes on the scene
[53:42] he says to his people fear not
[53:47] when there is a situation a crisis
[53:50] problem
[53:52] a challenge
[53:53] on the land
[53:55] when we are confronted with situations
[53:58] that is beyond us
[54:00] all that is said is
[54:03] don't be afraid
[54:06] that is if you trust in the
[54:08] lord if you know who he is
[54:13] if you will cast your cast upon him
[54:18] then what he says
[54:20] is don't be afraid
[54:25] the prophet of god said
[54:28] the greatest trouble there is in the
[54:30] church today
[54:31] is a bunch of fear
[54:35] people always scared
[54:38] and that is of the devil
[54:41] don't be scared
[54:43] be brave
[54:46] you don't have nothing
[54:48] they had nothing to be afraid
[54:56] be brave
[54:58] don't be scared
[55:04] that's it the whole church
[55:08] there's the trouble with the church
[55:09] today he's scared to death
[55:16] but the lord says to us don't be afraid
[55:20] why
[55:21] remember
[55:23] we are not yet by chance
[55:28] we are not yet by accident
[55:32] remember our life journey
[55:36] was planned by jehovah god
[55:42] before
[55:43] the foundation of the world
[55:49] for the bible says that day that he for
[55:52] knew
[55:53] he called them
[55:54] amen
[55:57] so we are not here by chance and we are
[55:59] not a bastard and i want you to know
[56:02] we are not here because we want to be
[56:05] here
[56:09] we are not here because we want to be
[56:11] here we are here because he wants us to
[56:14] be here
[56:17] and you could not have come any other
[56:20] day than today
[56:25] we could not have been here any other
[56:27] day than today because he predestinated
[56:31] you to be in this day
[56:33] and this hour
[56:37] praise the lord
[56:40] and if he choose that i should be here
[56:44] at this hour
[56:45] then he has a purpose for me and for you
[56:49] be here at this hour
[56:53] and then remember if he brought you here
[56:55] at this hour he brought you here
[56:58] you didn't come here on your own
[57:00] but he brought you here then you cannot
[57:03] exist out of here without his permission
[57:08] that's what brother branham said
[57:09] until god has finished with us nothing
[57:12] can take care from here
[57:15] because god brought me here to serve my
[57:17] purpose
[57:19] and god brought you here to serve the
[57:21] purpose and until that purpose have been
[57:24] saved
[57:25] nothing can take anybody out of here
[57:29] nothing
[57:33] because the one that brought us here is
[57:35] watching over us
[57:40] somebody say praise the lord
[57:42] hallelujah
[57:44] listen he brought us here for purpose
[57:48] i am here for purpose
[57:51] you are here for purpose and remember
[57:53] that
[57:54] he has the purpose we are made
[57:56] differently for different purposes
[57:59] we are serving god in different
[58:01] capacities
[58:03] everybody has a path to play
[58:06] you have a path to play and i have a
[58:08] part to play before i came here he knew
[58:12] the number of years allocated for me
[58:16] he did it
[58:17] he allocated it
[58:18] he allocated your own time
[58:21] he allocated mankind and he knows
[58:23] everything about everybody and there is
[58:26] nothing out of cater
[58:29] and there is nothing
[58:31] that surprises our god
[58:37] and there is no power that can act with
[58:40] our god
[58:43] no matter what power no matter what
[58:46] forces there is no power satan cannot
[58:49] sneak in
[58:50] and act with our god
[58:55] because our god is the almighty god
[58:59] our god is the creator
[59:02] our god created the heavens and the
[59:04] earth our god controls the universe
[59:10] and if you are his son and his daughter
[59:13] why are you afraid
[59:18] when the bible tells us
[59:20] that all things worked together
[59:24] for good to those who love the lord
[59:27] those who are called by the lord
[59:29] for his own purpose
[59:32] cast them fear
[59:36] the prophet of god said
[59:38] god does not want his children to fear
[59:44] he wants his children to believe
[59:48] no matter the circumstances
[59:51] no matter what is happening around us
[59:54] no matter how dark it gets
[59:58] he is the light of the world
[1:00:03] sisters and brothers
[1:00:05] god don't want you to fear
[1:00:08] because fear torments
[1:00:12] and that's why many of us have been
[1:00:14] tormented
[1:00:16] we are frustrated
[1:00:18] we are depressed
[1:00:20] because of fear
[1:00:26] oh i don't know what is going to happen
[1:00:28] the one that knows what is going to
[1:00:30] happen say trust me
[1:00:32] you don't know what is happening
[1:00:34] you can say but he knows all and he said
[1:00:37] be not afraid
[1:00:46] if you want to have fear
[1:00:48] the bible tells us we should fear god
[1:00:53] the fear of god is the beginning of
[1:00:56] wisdom that is reverence and respect to
[1:00:58] god
[1:01:00] and god wants us to respect him and you
[1:01:02] respect god by taking his
[1:01:08] word if you refuse to take that word
[1:01:12] that's disrespect to god
[1:01:15] if you are doubting whether god can do
[1:01:17] this you are disrespecting him
[1:01:24] oh god have mercy upon us
[1:01:28] respect him
[1:01:30] by taking his word
[1:01:33] because all the time we see god come on
[1:01:36] the scene and he said don't fear
[1:01:40] fear came in because of disobedience to
[1:01:43] his word
[1:01:46] there was nothing confirmed when the
[1:01:49] word was being obeyed
[1:01:52] so fear is result of disobedience
[1:01:57] when the lord god has already spoken and
[1:02:00] he
[1:02:01] fortified them behind his word our
[1:02:04] fortification is the word
[1:02:08] when you leave your fortification you
[1:02:11] will be exposed
[1:02:13] when you leave your defense the word is
[1:02:15] our defense
[1:02:17] and when you leave it your spouse
[1:02:21] that is why god sees to eat that in
[1:02:24] every age
[1:02:25] in every time he sends the world to
[1:02:28] defend
[1:02:29] to protect his children
[1:02:32] may god help us
[1:02:34] hallelujah
[1:02:36] to to to hold on
[1:02:39] to the infallible
[1:02:41] word of the living god amen
[1:02:47] be not afraid
[1:02:53] everybody might be afraid everybody
[1:02:54] might be troubled because they don't
[1:02:56] have the big god that we have
[1:03:00] remember
[1:03:01] i am the lord that he left all that
[1:03:04] diseases
[1:03:06] this scripture
[1:03:07] is living today he's still alive today
[1:03:10] and you should be alive until we are out
[1:03:13] of here
[1:03:15] he is our protection and he is our
[1:03:18] defense
[1:03:24] he that brought it in the secret place
[1:03:26] secret place of the almighty shall abide
[1:03:30] under the shadow of the messiah
[1:03:33] i will say to the lord
[1:03:35] it is my refuge
[1:03:37] in god
[1:03:39] in him will i trust
[1:03:41] [Music]
[1:03:43] trust in the lord
[1:03:45] and cast your case upon him
[1:03:52] hallelujah
[1:03:54] trust in the lord
[1:03:56] hold on to the word because the word of
[1:03:58] the lord is giving to keep us
[1:04:03] god speaking to the children of israel
[1:04:06] and he was telling them
[1:04:10] when you go to battle
[1:04:12] or when you are compassed with armies
[1:04:16] the nations
[1:04:18] bigger than doubt
[1:04:20] mightier than thou
[1:04:24] literally 20.
[1:04:27] let me read this when that goes out to
[1:04:29] battle against their enemies
[1:04:33] and see as us
[1:04:35] and chariots
[1:04:37] and a people more than doubt be not
[1:04:40] afraid of them
[1:04:42] for the lord thy god is with thee
[1:04:45] which brought thee up out of the land of
[1:04:48] egypt
[1:04:50] when that goes to battle
[1:04:53] and thousands their enemies
[1:04:57] and
[1:04:58] cs
[1:05:00] and chariots and people more than doubt
[1:05:04] be not afraid of them
[1:05:08] humanly speaking
[1:05:10] when you are going and you see oh but in
[1:05:13] this one god tells his children don't be
[1:05:16] afraid
[1:05:17] because it is the lord thy god that goes
[1:05:20] with you
[1:05:22] he's the creator of the heavens and the
[1:05:24] earth
[1:05:26] that is going with you
[1:05:28] and that same jehovah god is going with
[1:05:31] us today
[1:05:33] because he said i will not leave you and
[1:05:35] i will not forsake you
[1:05:39] hallelujah
[1:05:41] the almighty god says to you be not
[1:05:43] afraid
[1:05:44] no matter the situation no matter the
[1:05:47] circumstances no matter what has
[1:05:50] surrendered you don't be afraid
[1:05:53] because it doesn't want you to fear
[1:05:59] the prophet of god said
[1:06:01] there are two elements that controls
[1:06:04] everything
[1:06:06] fear
[1:06:07] of faith
[1:06:11] he said
[1:06:13] each and every one of us here
[1:06:16] is controlled by one
[1:06:18] you're either controlled by fear
[1:06:20] or control by faith
[1:06:25] so
[1:06:26] as we are here what is controlling you
[1:06:28] because your behavior your absence your
[1:06:31] conduct shows what is controlling you
[1:06:40] what is controlling us
[1:06:43] your behavior your attitude
[1:06:46] because by our absence it shows what is
[1:06:48] there
[1:06:50] your at what expression
[1:06:53] is us only the manifestation of the one
[1:06:56] that is inside you
[1:06:58] or what is controlling you
[1:07:04] it does not matter what you see your
[1:07:06] expression will show because the tree is
[1:07:08] known but the fruit is
[1:07:15] are we together
[1:07:17] what is controlling our lives
[1:07:22] what are you afraid of
[1:07:25] and why are you afraid
[1:07:29] why are you afraid
[1:07:37] hallelujah
[1:07:40] praise the name of the lord
[1:07:44] you
[1:07:47] that's the trouble you are afraid
[1:07:50] when you ask you won't receive
[1:07:53] that's the reason you don't receive
[1:07:56] don't be scared
[1:07:58] ask
[1:07:58] and then believe
[1:08:00] you are going to get it
[1:08:04] and you'll get it
[1:08:09] he said
[1:08:12] the trouble that's the trouble with the
[1:08:14] trap today is scared to death
[1:08:16] you are going to make a failure
[1:08:19] how can you fail when you are in christ
[1:08:22] you can't fail
[1:08:26] how can you fail when you are in christ
[1:08:30] how can you fail
[1:08:32] but this has fear
[1:08:34] hey
[1:08:35] i don't think i'm good fear will bring
[1:08:38] failure
[1:08:45] but when you are in christ
[1:08:47] so
[1:08:49] it is very important
[1:08:51] to check and make sure that we are in
[1:08:54] christ
[1:08:56] because he is our safety
[1:09:00] he is our protection
[1:09:02] he is our defense
[1:09:05] and if you are forgotten you are being
[1:09:07] reminded
[1:09:09] that there is no failure in christ
[1:09:15] hey stop looking at yourself
[1:09:18] and your ability
[1:09:19] [Applause]
[1:09:22] stop looking at that
[1:09:24] because you will fail as a man
[1:09:27] but he can't fail so cast your case on
[1:09:30] him rely on him
[1:09:33] rest on his word
[1:09:38] amen
[1:09:41] are we together
[1:09:43] don't let the devil beat you down with
[1:09:45] fear
[1:09:46] and you are going to die i know
[1:09:48] everybody will die anyhow
[1:09:51] hey listen
[1:09:53] it is not this virus coronavirus killing
[1:09:56] people people are dying of heartache
[1:09:58] heart failures
[1:10:00] and this and that and that one time my
[1:10:02] brother came to me a friend enough from
[1:10:04] south africa missionary that
[1:10:06] everything we want to eat is sometimes
[1:10:08] he will put sugar on it i said brother
[1:10:10] this is too much it's a timothy
[1:10:13] if
[1:10:14] sugar don't kill you salt will kill you
[1:10:20] he says something will kill you
[1:10:24] if
[1:10:25] not high blood pressure low blood
[1:10:27] pressure
[1:10:29] if not high sugar low sugar
[1:10:35] something you leave here somehow
[1:10:37] but death is not the end
[1:10:40] there is love beyond that
[1:10:42] [Applause]
[1:10:45] so stop
[1:10:47] fearing and don't let him keep
[1:10:49] convincing you because jesus came to
[1:10:51] deliver us out of fear
[1:10:53] the fear of death the fear of failure
[1:10:56] for you to rely on him that in jesus
[1:10:59] christ we are more than conquerors
[1:11:02] in jesus christ we will dispose the
[1:11:04] enemy in jesus christ we are more than
[1:11:07] overcomers it is our victory so be not
[1:11:11] afraid
[1:11:14] it does not matter oh this one died this
[1:11:17] way and that one that that's fine that's
[1:11:20] okay
[1:11:21] but it does not mean that i will also go
[1:11:23] that way
[1:11:24] you know since
[1:11:26] there's nothing to fear listen everyone
[1:11:28] that is here
[1:11:30] like i've said when this advice you saw

[1:11:36] if god never saw me going out
[1:11:39] through this i will never go
[1:11:42] no
[1:11:44] god never saw you going you know if god
[1:11:46] saw you that you went out of this
[1:11:49] nothing can change it
[1:11:55] and nobody can force it to happen
[1:11:59] because he is the controller
[1:12:03] so brethren let's stop fear
[1:12:06] let's stop worry and let's trust the
[1:12:09] lord
[1:12:13] you see we have been brought here for
[1:12:15] different purposes
[1:12:17] brother branham said when god is
[1:12:19] finished with me i don't want to stay
[1:12:20] here one minute i'm gone
[1:12:25] i have two people i say if i'm preaching
[1:12:26] here if i fall down dead now what i
[1:12:29] expect you to do is get around pray
[1:12:32] if you pray and god wants me to come
[1:12:34] back i'll come back if not i'm going to
[1:12:36] forget go ahead
[1:12:41] if god is not ready for me i can't go
[1:12:46] and if god is not ready for you can't go
[1:12:49] so don't let the enemy be tormenting you
[1:12:52] with that
[1:12:57] let the enemy know that look god i came
[1:12:59] here
[1:13:01] for purpose
[1:13:03] somebody brought me here
[1:13:05] and until he has seen this with me there
[1:13:08] is nothing you can do
[1:13:10] [Applause]
[1:13:14] be not afraid
[1:13:18] let's make our father happy
[1:13:22] let's make jehovah happy
[1:13:27] so that he looks at this are my children
[1:13:28] indeed
[1:13:30] that's why shut up messiah can i believe
[1:13:33] we read about them
[1:13:35] our god is able to deliver us
[1:13:39] but if he doesn't we are not going to
[1:13:41] change what we believe
[1:13:43] because it is animal be saying today you
[1:13:47] should be able to say my god is able to
[1:13:50] heal me
[1:13:51] to protect me
[1:13:52] to watch over me
[1:13:54] but if he doesn't he's suffering
[1:13:57] god is suffering
[1:13:59] he does what pleases him
[1:14:01] and once he decides to not end something
[1:14:03] nobody can change it
[1:14:05] no amount of prayer can change it no
[1:14:08] matter anything he can do change it
[1:14:09] because he's suffering amen
[1:14:14] hallelujah
[1:14:15] you read the scriptures
[1:14:17] i said don't compare yourself to anybody
[1:14:22] if you do that the bible says you are
[1:14:24] not wise
[1:14:26] because i'm different you are different
[1:14:30] like i've said
[1:14:32] john the baptist
[1:14:34] the time he was born
[1:14:36] and the time jesus was born
[1:14:39] just six months apart
[1:14:42] herod
[1:14:43] when he heard about the birth of christ
[1:14:45] and the wise men came there
[1:14:47] he waited for them and they did not come
[1:14:50] and then arrows sent an order
[1:14:52] that they should go and kill all the
[1:14:55] children from two years down
[1:15:00] joseph was told to jesus to take jesus
[1:15:03] out
[1:15:05] but nothing was said about john the
[1:15:06] baptist
[1:15:08] so john the baptist was there when
[1:15:11] ernest was killing the children
[1:15:14] but god protected him
[1:15:18] nothing happened to him
[1:15:21] he didn't go anywhere
[1:15:23] but nothing happened to him and nothing
[1:15:26] will happen to you
[1:15:27] it does not matter what will be
[1:15:29] happening around nothing will touch you
[1:15:31] because god has a purpose for your life
[1:15:39] john grew up
[1:15:41] he came to serve the purpose of god
[1:15:43] until
[1:15:45] when that purpose was finished he
[1:15:47] preached the gospel he rebuked errol he
[1:15:50] rebuked erodius he condemned them for
[1:15:52] their evil things committing adultery
[1:15:54] and living in adultery
[1:15:59] and a prostitute
[1:16:01] they asked for the end of john the
[1:16:03] baptist
[1:16:05] god could have prevented it
[1:16:07] because the bible said the greatness of
[1:16:09] all prophets was john the baptist
[1:16:12] of all that were born of women none
[1:16:14] greater than john the baptist
[1:16:18] yet he has to be buried without his head
[1:16:22] a great prophet like john the baptist
[1:16:26] was it because he failed was it because
[1:16:29] god was not mindful no
[1:16:32] god was there
[1:16:34] and he has to go that way
[1:16:37] jesus was on the scene at that time
[1:16:40] but god has a purpose for everybody
[1:16:45] our coming in and are going out
[1:16:51] praise the lord
[1:16:52] hallelujah
[1:16:54] don't fear be not afraid
[1:16:58] believe what the bible says
[1:17:00] believe the word of the lord that's why
[1:17:02] god sent a prophet to us today to preach
[1:17:04] he said what am i trying to do to drive
[1:17:06] away fear
[1:17:16] and that's what i'm trying to do to
[1:17:17] drive i was here
[1:17:18] in this flightful and fearful times in
[1:17:20] which we are living
[1:17:23] don't work in fear walk in fights
[1:17:27] commit your life commit your way to
[1:17:29] god's hands
[1:17:36] live a righteous life
[1:17:38] live a holy life
[1:17:40] i mean as a christian as a believer like
[1:17:43] i've said jesus one day asked his
[1:17:44] disciples
[1:17:46] who do men say i the son of man whom do
[1:17:49] they say i am
[1:17:52] whole son said elijah also said john the
[1:17:54] baptist sunset jeremiah said one of the
[1:17:57] prophets so wonderful is listening
[1:18:00] all the names they mentioned with people
[1:18:02] that fear god
[1:18:03] and why they miss you all these prophets
[1:18:05] because each and every one of them lived
[1:18:08] part of the life of christ
[1:18:12] he was in david
[1:18:13] he was in jeremiah he was in moses he
[1:18:16] was
[1:18:17] ezekiel
[1:18:18] everyone of the prophet was manifesting
[1:18:20] part of the life of christ
[1:18:25] and so today what are we who are we
[1:18:28] then the question comes jesus said whom
[1:18:30] do men say i the son of man
[1:18:33] because the people have looked at his
[1:18:34] life and
[1:18:36] sometimes he speaks like moses he lives
[1:18:38] like jeremiah he did like this and that
[1:18:41] now the question comes
[1:18:42] whom do they say you are
[1:18:44] you also
[1:18:46] whom do the people say you are your
[1:18:48] neighbors
[1:18:50] your colleagues your associates
[1:18:54] your place of work whom do they say you
[1:18:56] are
[1:18:59] your life is reflecting who
[1:19:02] your character is reflecting who
[1:19:06] your asses your belief your habits who
[1:19:09] is it reflecting who do they say you are
[1:19:14] can they say you're a christian
[1:19:16] can they say a daughter of god
[1:19:18] can they say oh like john
[1:19:20] oh like peter like johanna like suzuana
[1:19:24] like mary like whom do they say you are
[1:19:28] who are you reflecting
[1:19:32] because if you believe this message you
[1:19:34] will refer jesus christ
[1:19:37] if you're a believer of this word of the
[1:19:39] lord message of this hour that has been
[1:19:41] given to us you will reflect christ
[1:19:44] the ultimate is the only god's baptism
[1:19:47] to reflect our life to show jesus in our
[1:19:50] lives
[1:19:51] as they said about the christians in the
[1:19:53] beginning they were christians the bible
[1:19:55] said they were called christians at
[1:19:57] antioch
[1:19:58] because they saw their lives
[1:20:01] yes
[1:20:04] christ this one like like that man
[1:20:06] christ that's why the god that were
[1:20:07] christians
[1:20:09] so in your behavior and your attitude
[1:20:12] who does he reflect
[1:20:19] are you reflecting christ
[1:20:23] the bible said though he was god he
[1:20:25] thought it not roughly to be equal with
[1:20:27] god but humble itself and made himself
[1:20:30] of no reputation
[1:20:34] him humble himself
[1:20:37] and made himself of no reputation
[1:20:40] of death their calling names
[1:20:44] they call him even visible
[1:20:47] chief of demons
[1:20:50] his father forgive they don't even know
[1:20:51] what they are saying
[1:20:53] what about you
[1:20:55] why do you get offended
[1:20:57] what about you what about the woman that
[1:21:00] came to jesus and jesus said i can't
[1:21:02] take the children's bread and cast it to
[1:21:04] dogs
[1:21:07] jesus called that woman dog
[1:21:10] i can't take the children's breath and
[1:21:12] cast it to dogs
[1:21:14] did he get offended he said no
[1:21:17] he said lord you are right
[1:21:20] you are right
[1:21:22] it is not right to take the children's
[1:21:24] bread and cast it to dusk when the
[1:21:25] children have not
[1:21:26] eaten he said listen faith
[1:21:29] always acknowledges that the word is the
[1:21:32] truth
[1:21:35] listen we are too much a life of
[1:21:36] ourselves
[1:21:38] we think too much of ourselves
[1:21:41] i am this i am fine
[1:21:43] but if you are a christian
[1:21:45] you must come under the world
[1:21:49] you must die to the flesh
[1:21:52] to our thinkings and our ideas and our
[1:21:55] words
[1:21:57] we too might get offended
[1:21:59] i'm not going to church again i don't
[1:22:01] want to talk to that brother again
[1:22:03] is this scripture not to talk to your
[1:22:05] brother
[1:22:07] is this creature not to talk with sister
[1:22:10] is it scripture
[1:22:12] giving jesus said if you greet those who
[1:22:14] only greet you what more are you doing
[1:22:17] even the hittings they do they say
[1:22:20] the life of the christian is to go the
[1:22:22] extra mile
[1:22:24] to do what the ordinary person cannot do
[1:22:27] and when the holy ghost is there we will
[1:22:29] do it
[1:22:31] so what life are we living
[1:22:35] it's not enough to say i believe the
[1:22:36] message if you believe the message leave
[1:22:38] the message
[1:22:39] work the message talk the message

[1:22:59] didn't jesus said it so what life are we
[1:23:02] living today
[1:23:04] do you love your enemies
[1:23:08] do you love those who criticize you
[1:23:10] and speak evil about you
[1:23:12] and condemn you when you have not done
[1:23:14] anything

[1:23:24] brother that disagrees with you or
[1:23:26] sister that disagrees with you do you

[1:23:36] church we need the holy ghost we need
[1:23:39] christ we need the revelation of the
[1:23:41] world

[1:23:51] even on talking tents with our brothers
[1:23:53] and our sisters how can you be on taking
[1:23:55] time with god
[1:23:58] the bible read the bible how can a man
[1:24:01] say he loves god
[1:24:02] when he doesn't love his fellow man that
[1:24:04] he sees with his eye that's the bible
[1:24:11] i'm just cutting the scriptures
[1:24:15] because the bible says he that would say
[1:24:17] he loves my god and he doesn't love his
[1:24:20] fellow man he's a liar the bible says so
[1:24:26] your life and my life is examined by
[1:24:28] god's word
[1:24:34] think about it and repent
[1:24:36] and straighten up that is what the word
[1:24:38] is here for to strengthen us up
[1:24:41] because it is not your standard
[1:24:44] it's not my standard it is god's
[1:24:46] standard
[1:24:48] it is not what you say or what you think
[1:24:51] about yourself but it is what the word
[1:24:53] says about you
[1:24:59] praise the lord
[1:25:00] sorry if i'm keeping you quiet but
[1:25:02] it will go anyhow blessed be the name of
[1:25:05] the lord

[1:25:09] listen we are very close to the coming
[1:25:10] of the lord
[1:25:13] we are in the end time
[1:25:15] the end of the end is here
[1:25:18] the time is late
[1:25:20] what are you here for
[1:25:22] to add to the number
[1:25:23] to be a benchwoman what are you here for

[1:25:47] oh god help us
[1:25:49] unless the sense of god don't compare
[1:25:52] your life to anybody
[1:25:54] the bible says son through the flood
[1:25:57] sun through great sorrows sown through
[1:25:59] this
[1:26:00] some true that but all through the blood
[1:26:08] of the believers
[1:26:09] were bent
[1:26:11] to death
[1:26:13] some of the believers
[1:26:15] fire could not touch them
[1:26:19] is it because
[1:26:20] those who fire could not touch them we
[1:26:23] see because they were stronger than
[1:26:24] those that the firemen no
[1:26:27] they were all heroes of the faith
[1:26:31] these believers that were bent at stake
[1:26:34] and they stood there
[1:26:36] we would not deny our lord
[1:26:40] men like polycarb
[1:26:42] many of the brothers
[1:26:44] oh john huss
[1:26:46] different people
[1:26:48] they had the right the bible talked
[1:26:50] about in the book of hebrews hebrews 11
[1:26:52] he said they refused deliverance
[1:26:55] they refused deliverance
[1:26:57] that they might attain a better
[1:26:59] resurrection
[1:27:01] they could have gone away they could
[1:27:02] have ran if only they had compromised
[1:27:05] they said no we will not compromise
[1:27:09] they walk to the state
[1:27:13] and they stood there
[1:27:16] and the whole the the people wanted to
[1:27:18] watching them
[1:27:20] and people laughing calling them all
[1:27:22] names
[1:27:24] and it's their students on their faith
[1:27:27] oh heroes of the faith
[1:27:30] and they set fire on them
[1:27:33] jonah said father lord i come in my
[1:27:35] spirit on today
[1:27:37] jesus son of david have mercy on me
[1:27:41] when the priest said we commit your soul
[1:27:43] cannot say we commit your soul to the
[1:27:44] devil is a common soul to the lord
[1:27:50] they were heroes
[1:27:53] god determined that they should go
[1:27:55] they said the blood of the saints the
[1:27:57] blood of the matters is the seed of the
[1:27:59] side at the church
[1:28:01] they shed their blood
[1:28:03] this only god's gospel dripping with
[1:28:05] blood
[1:28:08] i've been to some of the arenas in rome
[1:28:11] when they went
[1:28:12] they released lions
[1:28:14] to eat our brothers
[1:28:18] and those warriors
[1:28:20] they were men and women of faith in
[1:28:22] respect babysitting all together were
[1:28:25] given to lions
[1:28:26] but they stood and defied the lions
[1:28:29] we are not going to bow we're going to
[1:28:31] serve god we are not going to renounce
[1:28:33] jesus he is our lord is our savior
[1:28:36] our god disabled
[1:28:38] and the student to the shame of those
[1:28:40] admirers
[1:28:44] they did not surrender
[1:28:46] they didn't believe in fear don't live
[1:28:49] in fights
[1:28:54] some of these believers oh hallelujah
[1:28:57] they stood they went into the fire and
[1:28:59] they quit the violence of fire

[1:42:06] enter the promised land
[1:42:08] fear
[1:42:12] they were afraid because they look at it
[1:42:15] look at the giant they look at this one
[1:42:17] there look at this one die that of this
[1:42:19] one this one suffer this one so what
[1:42:24] it didn't mean nothing to god
[1:42:27] there was a joshua and there was a
[1:42:29] killing
[1:42:30] and they said hey
[1:42:32] let's go to possess the land because
[1:42:34] this is what god said to us
[1:42:39] they were not afraid those who were
[1:42:41] afraid didn't enter the land
[1:42:45] why are they always here then
[1:42:48] there is no value in fear
[1:42:51] so what do you fear why do you hold on
[1:42:53] to something that has no value in it
[1:42:58] why do you worry
[1:42:59] jesus said which of us might worry can i
[1:43:02] give you one inch to your ear
[1:43:04] when he told us that even he knows the
[1:43:07] number of our head
[1:43:09] he said why we not fall without annoying
[1:43:14] what do we fear why are you afraid
[1:43:19] trust me
[1:43:21] cast your case upon me that's what he
[1:43:24] says
[1:43:27] listen when we are in crisis and
[1:43:30] challenging time as we are in today that
[1:43:33] is when we are to trust the lord
[1:43:35] more
[1:43:36] in crisis time in difficult times that
[1:43:39] is where faith is displayed
[1:43:41] that's when faith goes into action
[1:43:44] that's when faith is manifested
[1:43:46] because all
[1:43:48] these challenges are opportunities for
[1:43:50] faith
[1:43:59] the prophet said excise your faith
[1:44:12] they didn't enter the promised land
[1:44:13] because of fear
[1:44:15] who this problem there
[1:44:17] because look
[1:44:18] he was telling them he said remember
[1:44:21] when you will say these nations are
[1:44:23] bigger than us
[1:44:25] these nations have this how we're going
[1:44:27] to dispose them
[1:44:28] he said remember what i did for you
[1:44:32] what i did to pharaoh and to remember
[1:44:35] that
[1:44:36] can you remember what god has done for
[1:44:37] you look back into your life
[1:44:40] look back into your life
[1:44:42] how are you alive today
[1:44:44] how are you where you are today look
[1:44:47] back god don't want us to forget
[1:44:50] amen
[1:44:54] he said remember what i did to pharaoh
[1:45:00] the pharaohs that were one controlling
[1:45:02] your life
[1:45:04] the powers that was one rule in your
[1:45:06] life remember where i brought you from
[1:45:09] from the iron fairness
[1:45:11] from bandage
[1:45:13] who could have done that except our god
[1:45:16] to take a whole nation he said remember
[1:45:18] the things that i did in egypt
[1:45:21] pledged upon place
[1:45:23] and when those places were happening he
[1:45:25] said listen he kept israel from it
[1:45:30] do you know that even mosquito didn't go
[1:45:32] to goshen
[1:45:34] he kept all the virus he kept on from
[1:45:36] then
[1:45:37] when the whole line was being plagued
[1:45:40] it was plagued upon plague
[1:45:42] and this word is going to face plague
[1:45:44] upon plague
[1:45:46] the prophet said there will be diseases
[1:45:48] in the last days
[1:45:52] place
[1:45:56] in the last days that doctors has
[1:45:58] nothing no answer
[1:46:01] he said every cancer will look like a
[1:46:03] toothache
[1:46:07] and do you know how much tooth aid can
[1:46:09] bend
[1:46:10] whoa
[1:46:11] do you ever had it too fake
[1:46:19] did anybody had it before
[1:46:21] brother
[1:46:24] it's terrible i had one
[1:46:26] i had the ones i said doctor take it out
[1:46:35] but faith is the master of all
[1:46:37] circumstances
[1:46:40] is the master of all circumstances that
[1:46:43] no matter what it will be no matter the
[1:46:45] place no matter the diseases no matter
[1:46:48] what we come faith is the master of all
[1:46:50] circumstances that is why we need faith
[1:46:53] in this hour jesus said have faith in
[1:46:56] god
[1:47:04] enough of fear enough of worry let's
[1:47:06] turn to faith
[1:47:07] because worry has never helped us
[1:47:10] fear has never helped us
[1:47:12] so let's go to what will help us
[1:47:16] if you are taking something you tried
[1:47:17] this disease and that medicine and that
[1:47:19] is you go for another you look for
[1:47:22] something better than this and the
[1:47:24] better than all is the faith in jehovah
[1:47:26] god
[1:47:27] amen
[1:47:30] that is
[1:47:31] believe what he says
[1:47:34] don't reason with it take his attitudes
[1:47:39] trust in the lord before your heart
[1:47:44] praise the lord
[1:47:46] i know you think this guy is crazy but
[1:47:48] that's happy to do so far
[1:47:52] i like to be crazy this way
[1:47:57] because in the first place
[1:48:00] you can't serve god in your own mind
[1:48:02] you need the mind of christ
[1:48:05] the bible says let this mind which was
[1:48:07] in christ being in you
[1:48:10] the mind of christ who said father that
[1:48:12] will be done
[1:48:13] the mind of christ is to do the will of
[1:48:15] the father the mind of christ is to stay
[1:48:17] with the word of god
[1:48:19] and that's what we need in this hour
[1:48:21] to cast down reasons
[1:48:29] god help us
[1:48:33] be not afraid
[1:48:37] the children of israel are coming out of
[1:48:39] egypt and god is reminding remember
[1:48:46] let's let's negotiate that place
[1:48:51] if thou shall say in thy heart
[1:48:55] these nations are more than i
[1:48:58] how can i dispose them
[1:49:01] how can i get over this situation
[1:49:03] how can i get over this mountain
[1:49:06] i cannot overcome
[1:49:08] how can i make it
[1:49:12] how did you make it today
[1:49:16] when this pandemic broke out
[1:49:19] and everybody was afraid how did we come
[1:49:21] to where we are today
[1:49:23] he took care of us
[1:49:28] you might have contacted or be in
[1:49:31] contact with people that had the virus
[1:49:33] that did themselves didn't know
[1:49:35] that you didn't know and god took care
[1:49:37] of us

[1:49:56] thousand at your right hand it does not
[1:49:58] come near you

[2:08:48] rapture it's sent to prepare us so
[2:08:51] straighten us up
[2:08:52] sense
[2:08:54] fear is the case
[2:08:57] and we must move away from it
[2:09:01] knowing that
[2:09:02] perfect faith is the master of all
[2:09:05] circumstances
[2:09:08] when we have faith in god
[2:09:11] all things are possible
[2:09:13] may god be with us
[2:09:15] as we press on the
[2:09:17] may god be with us
[2:09:19] as we match forward
[2:09:21] let's match forward in faith
[2:09:23] let's live in faith let's keep trusting
[2:09:26] the lord
[2:09:27] whatever situation young men young women
[2:09:30] mothers fathers husbands and wives there
[2:09:32] is nothing to forget
[2:09:36] our god
[2:09:38] is abundantly
[2:09:40] able
[2:09:41] an apostle paul said my god
[2:09:44] shall supply all your needs
[2:09:47] according to its riches
[2:09:49] in glory in christ jesus
[2:09:53] he said be careful for nothing
[2:09:56] in everything with prayer
[2:09:58] and supplication
[2:10:00] let that request be made new
[2:10:03] unto the lord
[2:10:04] for he has promised
[2:10:06] i will never leave you
[2:10:08] and i will never forsake you
[2:10:11] be not afraid god bless you
[2:10:23] let god be with us
[2:10:25] let's keep pressing on but the assam can
[2:10:52] amen
[2:10:54] have you been encouraged
[2:10:56] amen
[2:10:58] it's the same theme no matter what
[2:10:59] country you're in
[2:11:01] because he's the same god
[2:11:03] and the reality is that we we see here
[2:11:06] in this
[2:11:07] one word that i continue to just go over
[2:11:09] my heart was brother timothy was
[2:11:11] speaking is the word perspective
[2:11:14] perspective is everything
[2:11:16] you know when you you hear one report
[2:11:18] from the
[2:11:19] spies who went over
[2:11:22] their perspective was
[2:11:24] is we're defeated
[2:11:26] but in whose eyes
[2:11:28] in their own eyes
[2:11:30] in their own eyes
[2:11:32] they never walked up to a giant and said
[2:11:35] mr giant what do i look like to you you
[2:11:38] look like a grasshopper okay thank you
[2:11:40] so i
[2:11:41] that was their own
[2:11:44] mind
[2:11:46] they took they looked at the situation
[2:11:48] but they failed to look
[2:11:51] to the word of god
[2:11:52] the god who brought them there
[2:11:55] joshua and caleb they've seen the same
[2:11:57] giants
[2:11:59] they you know joshua and caleb didn't
[2:12:01] say my we we must not have been in the
[2:12:03] same place we saw only little people
[2:12:06] you guys saw big people no no joshua and
[2:12:09] caleb saw the same people
[2:12:14] but when you listen to joshua and
[2:12:16] caleb's testimony
[2:12:18] they don't focus on the giants
[2:12:21] because really what's important is to
[2:12:24] focus on the god who has brought us here
[2:12:26] it's the god who made the promise
[2:12:28] and in taking that possession it's to
[2:12:30] focus on him
[2:12:33] so it really doesn't matter what's in
[2:12:34] the land doesn't matter what comes up
[2:12:36] doesn't matter what circumstance he's
[2:12:38] still
[2:12:39] jehovah jireh
[2:12:42] oh my i tell you if one thing that we
[2:12:45] can take even from these things how that
[2:12:48] god through the message of the hour
[2:12:50] we speak of the message of the hour i'm
[2:12:52] not talking about books i'm not talking
[2:12:54] about tapes i'm not talking about quotes
[2:12:56] i'm talking about jesus christ because
[2:12:58] the message is christ
[2:13:01] when that that anchor and that is there
[2:13:05] you look beyond circumstances
[2:13:08] circumstances can come
[2:13:10] fear can try to come but it's what you
[2:13:12] focus on
[2:13:13] these are the themes i i think of it
[2:13:15] that how god used brother timothy to
[2:13:18] speak to our hearts here this morning
[2:13:20] this is a word from the lord
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:23] and i can tell you no matter what it is
[2:13:25] god was very clear that in christ there
[2:13:28] is nothing to fear
[2:13:31] and if we and if there is fear whether
[2:13:33] it's doctor's report whether it's
[2:13:35] coronavirus or the next virus and
[2:13:38] maybe they'll come up with the second
[2:13:39] greek alphabet i don't know
[2:13:42] whatever god has placed us here
[2:13:46] and there's nothing can defeat the
[2:13:48] purpose of god
[2:13:51] god did not ask us to do to defend for
[2:13:54] ourselves and try to fend for ourselves
[2:13:56] it's only frustration
[2:13:58] worry and everything else if the
[2:14:00] doctor's report has said a certain thing
[2:14:03] we have a different report
[2:14:06] that we place above that report
[2:14:08] who
[2:14:09] hath believed our report
[2:14:14] that's what matters above every other
[2:14:16] report and we believe that
[2:14:18] we believe that in this hour
[2:14:21] the stabilizers as the prophet said have
[2:14:23] been put on the ship so no matter what
[2:14:26] comes
[2:14:28] our way
[2:14:29] we can look to god and know that god is
[2:14:31] faithful
[2:14:33] to direct our lives that we can walk
[2:14:35] in a perfect faith
[2:14:37] you know it depends on what you feed on
[2:14:41] you with me it depends on what you feed
[2:14:43] on whatever you feed on you will feel
[2:14:46] the effects of it
[2:14:49] and there should be no word no article
[2:14:52] nothing that should be placed above the
[2:14:55] word of god or that we even give
[2:14:57] equalness to
[2:15:00] nothing because there is nothing equal
[2:15:03] to god
[2:15:05] no matter what comes up we say he's the
[2:15:08] almighty god
[2:15:10] he's the almighty god
[2:15:12] god is over it all
[2:15:14] and it's a time of real examination be
[2:15:16] sure
[2:15:18] that you're in christ
[2:15:20] and if you're in christ and you
[2:15:23] you you've got to looking this and
[2:15:25] looking at that just be honest before
[2:15:27] god
[2:15:29] well lord i'm just trying to be wise you
[2:15:31] know say god i was fearful
[2:15:34] i'm fearful about this look
[2:15:36] god is not ashamed god doesn't say oh
[2:15:38] you got a doctor's report and you were
[2:15:40] fearful oh i'm so ashamed of you no no
[2:15:43] david said
[2:15:44] i cried unto the lord this poor man
[2:15:47] cried unto the lord and he heard me and
[2:15:50] delivered me from all my fears
[2:15:56] god
[2:15:57] comes to honesty
[2:16:00] and i've done whatever it is i can go to
[2:16:03] him he's not ashamed of me but he'll
[2:16:05] come and he'll minister what i have need
[2:16:07] of to lift me in that moment
[2:16:10] he's the same god for every one of us
[2:16:13] amen we we have been encouraged by the
[2:16:16] things of god
[2:16:17] and you know what that does when
[2:16:18] encouragement comes
[2:16:21] as as god was speaking here to us
[2:16:23] there's a reflection that comes out in
[2:16:25] our life
[2:16:27] you know i i just i marveled it seemed
[2:16:29] like how
[2:16:30] god used brother timothy here this
[2:16:32] morning and it was like taking things
[2:16:34] that's been ministered all the other
[2:16:35] ministers here as well taking things
[2:16:37] that's been ministered a culmination
[2:16:38] over the year and just it was like ends
[2:16:41] ends coming together
[2:16:43] are you with me
[2:16:44] ends up with where brother daryl was at
[2:16:46] with with here with with lazarus and the
[2:16:49] resurrection power of corruption
[2:16:51] how god speaking be not afraid and when
[2:16:53] brother wayne was here focus on the
[2:16:55] vindicated word of god
[2:16:57] all these things all the way through god
[2:16:59] has a purpose and that purpose cannot be
[2:17:03] defeated
[2:17:05] you know just like he said you don't go
[2:17:07] stand in the middle of the street but
[2:17:09] yet it's like this
[2:17:11] how many times when we you have to go
[2:17:13] somewhere you have to go somewhere
[2:17:15] whether you go to work or whether you
[2:17:16] you don't think about getting in your
[2:17:18] car and say my goodness my chance of
[2:17:21] survival
[2:17:22] is at such and such a rate
[2:17:25] you know in reality in statistics you
[2:17:27] have a less chance of survival in a car
[2:17:29] than you do from coronavirus
[2:17:31] [Music]
[2:17:34] that's facts i'm not i'm not making that
[2:17:35] up that's just statistics i'm not making
[2:17:37] these things up that's just statistics
[2:17:39] but you see it's all perspective
[2:17:43] it's perspective
[2:17:45] and things begin as things start to
[2:17:47] happen
[2:17:48] you let things where
[2:17:50] and it is seen things can happen and it
[2:17:52] seems to give validity to this we need
[2:17:55] to follow this oh we need to do this we
[2:17:57] need you let someone in a family are you
[2:17:59] hearing me you let someone die in a car
[2:18:01] accident in a family if it's not careful
[2:18:04] that fear will come all the way through
[2:18:05] that family
[2:18:07] it'll come all the way through
[2:18:09] is to let somebody die suddenly of a
[2:18:11] heart attack all of a sudden everybody's
[2:18:13] got i got chest pains
[2:18:15] but see it's recognize that you may have
[2:18:17] come through that but it's to recognize
[2:18:19] fear itself then of a situation that you
[2:18:22] didn't have control over it's a
[2:18:24] situation when god maybe as a child of
[2:18:26] god took that person home but god never
[2:18:28] meant that to bring fear but satan is an
[2:18:30] opportunist to try to use that to inject
[2:18:33] fear oh you're starting to feel this way
[2:18:35] maybe you've got clogged arteries
[2:18:37] god never brings anxiousness
[2:18:41] god never brings fear and he never
[2:18:43] brings condemnation the word will bring
[2:18:46] conviction always pointing us to the
[2:18:48] cross
[2:18:49] is that right
[2:18:50] it'll always bring peace
[2:18:52] and strength within our lives
[2:18:55] that god has god has all this covered
[2:18:58] and they can just say it like this look
[2:18:59] look at your neighbor and say god's got
[2:19:01] this covered
[2:19:03] he's got it covered
[2:19:04] he's already got it covered
[2:19:06] and you know this is not this is not
[2:19:08] it's not fine print
[2:19:10] you know what i mean brother richard
[2:19:11] it's not like where you have to get the
[2:19:13] the the telescope that they look out
[2:19:15] there and say oh what did the fine print
[2:19:17] say
[2:19:18] oh everything you're covered this is a
[2:19:20] life insurance oh life insurance policy
[2:19:22] but if this happens we will not cover
[2:19:24] that no no
[2:19:26] there's no fine print in here
[2:19:29] you know why they put it in fine print
[2:19:30] because they don't want you to read it
[2:19:33] and we don't read it right do you agree
[2:19:35] to these terms
[2:19:37] agree
[2:19:38] right but in god's word there's no fine
[2:19:41] print
[2:19:42] but every word he said he means it
[2:19:45] every word he said is yeah amen and he's
[2:19:48] the same god that'll fulfill every word
[2:19:50] no matter the conditions
[2:19:52] he's still the same great i am
[2:19:56] amen he said
[2:19:58] don't fear
[2:19:59] lo i am with thee always
[2:20:03] whether so ever thou goest

[2:20:15] god is an ever-present help in the time
[2:20:18] of trouble

[2:20:20] i believe i can say within this time we
[2:20:23] have been so
[2:20:24] encouraged
[2:20:25] in the things of god

[2:25:44] have that
[2:25:45] but they had something that was greater

[2:25:50] trust you that whether you delivered
[2:25:53] them out of the lands or not nothing
[2:25:55] could touch or hinder their journey and
