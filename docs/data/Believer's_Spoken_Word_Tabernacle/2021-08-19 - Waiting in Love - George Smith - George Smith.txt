that no matter what's going on in life no matter what what comes out or what's said or what comes even our way there's an anchor that holds us that's greater than any any bit of our natural strength even when our strength comes to the end of its way god's strength never reaches an end this is when he told paul my grace is sufficient amen and we're we are we are witnesses of that tonight throughout this building here tonight there's not one that hasn't been through a test or in a test or in a trial but god's grace has been with you and god's grace is still here with you amen and if there's one that doesn't know that strength he's here tonight it's not an idea it's not a quote it's not a scripture it's a person it becomes an anchor that no matter what is going on around no matter how great the winds blow or the storm gets he's the same yesterday today and forever you can only aren't you glad you can count on jesus he's still the same he's never changed time changes but he's never changed amen we just want to just invite brother george and just so thankful to have brother george smith here with us and thankful for brother george friendship and and just the times that we've been able to have together and uh just appreciate brother george's stand and it's just it's just it's constant it's steady and you know sometimes as you know for myself it it's a little bit it's been a little bit accumulating meeting different ones that have been right there you know with brother branham and i've i've always well i've learned to really appreciate that and you know sometimes as i've said to people and they say well you really don't need that or whatever but it's not that i needed it but it's something about it that i i certainly enjoy hearing the things because what you see is there's some even some insight and the life that was there and i believe that that same life i i see and witness that right here it's in the bride of jesus christ and just the little things you know that you hear and it just means it to me it means a lot to me you know the the testimonies and things that are shared it means a whole lot to me and i believe it means a lot to all of us and we're just thankful for the grace of god in this hour thankful that god not only that god sent a message in this hour but that god anointed us to be able to hear it and that we would have a heart that would become a place that god could make his abode in our life what does all that boil down to grace not one thing that we have done it's what we've yielded to it's all the grace of god aren't you thankful for that tonight the same grace it'll take us all the way through amen let's just sing tonight as brother george would just make his way we want him just to take his liberty here tonight brother george it's good to have you here amen we're really glad to have you could we sing that song adjusting amazing grace as brother george would come oh amazing grace how [Music] [Music] like me [Music] once was lost but now i'm [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we've known last days [Music] amen and amen so good to be in the house of the lord tonight that'll be all the music i'm not going to try to sing we're going to be sitting for a while so we're going to be standing for a little bit first i'm not a three-hour preacher don't get worried but i speak fast and you got to listen fast but it's good to be here last time i was here was very cold weather and the pastor just reminded me it was 2018. a lot of things have happened since then but uh he was telling me much too bad some of the people are out look empty seats never bother me i'm worried about y'all getting something to take home that you would get something that would amount to life take you to the next sunday to next whatever so if you have your bible we want to turn into the book of luke chapter 8 and we're going to read a few verses here in luke chapter 8 we've got uh the storm on the sea of galilee now they call it a sea but we've got bigger lakes right out you know close by here it's a lake that's eight by 13 miles and um jesus calmed the sea verses 22-25 and then in verses 26-39 he he dealt with that one man who would cross the sea prayed for one man the man was delivered and the spirit in the man said oh send us into those pigs so there's 2 000 pigs over there and these spirits go into those pigs and it drove them crazy and they all went into the steve galley and drowned and the people were mad because you know the pigs were gone but anyway we're down into verse 38 of chapter 8 of luke where it says um wait a minute here yeah uh now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might go with him they want to go with him but jesus sent him away saying return to your own people your house show what great things god has done and he went his way and published throughout the whole city what great things god had done and it came to pass when jesus was returned to where he started out from the people gladly received him for they were all waiting for him now that's the historical part if we look over to chapter 12 of luke chapter 12 and verse 39 see if we can get our bearings here uh 39 and this know that if the good man of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken into but be therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at the hour when you think not so our consolation is over in second thessalonians yeah glad everybody brought their bible let's see ii thessalonians and um that's right here chapter three ii second thessalonians chapter three verse one finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not the faith surprise surprise clear back there they weren't all christians right okay verse 3 but the lord is faithful who shall establish you and keep you from evil and we have confidence in the lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which are commanded you and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god into the patient waiting for christ so the holy spirit is what brought you here today you thought you just had a good idea we'll go over and see brother samuels if he's still following the message and all that no you came because god brought you you know and uh it really wasn't your choice and so you're waiting today for jesus to say something to you see brother brahm says that the minister's job is to make christ real to the people anybody can get up here and read anybody can quote it but is it real to you this is something that is real so he only comes to those that are waiting for him so today we're going to speak on a title waiting in love let's pray heavenly father we thank you for your grace we thank you lord that you've brought us each one from our different places into this beautiful little church we thank you for brother samuel we thank you for the people here we thank you lord for the welcoming spirit we feel and we just pray that you would bless your word may it be real to each person may each one take something home with them that would help them we love you we thank you we pray that you bless your people in the other countries protect them and help us lord in jesus name amen you may be seated now the preacher says over in ecclesiastes 1 to everything there is a season so there's a time for each thing each one of you came to the knowledge of the gospel at a certain time it wouldn't work the week before and some put it off and they got a second chance and some just walked away but there's this everything there's a season and a time for every purpose under heaven a time or a season for every detail okay time for every purpose under heaven and that covers everything these words are not in the bible for just no reason see every detail of your individual life right here in 2021 and tomorrow in every moment from here to the resurrection and beyond everything but yesterday's gone you already forgot what you had for supper last night it's like the water in the river it's gone and we don't have any guarantee of tomorrow you don't know that you'll wake up tomorrow but we're here now so we're going to pay attention we're going to see what god has for us right now so it's every detail every thought all your fears he knows what the solutions are solomon also wrote there's nothing new under the sun now we think that we live in such an enlightened age because you know we all have a cell phone and we got a forty thousand dollar car and you know we got a wife we got all these wonderful blessings but guess what god is coming for individual people all this is going to burn you see and so it all goes to nothing so i'm only here to remind you i'm not an entertainer believe it or not i'm just a true witness of a very mighty message and we're here to help you to look in the mirror now the mirror is god's word this mirror doesn't need your help to clean it off the word is clean that's right amen now the ultimate uh alternative is like the man in rome he said well this old we need a new bible well you don't even know that you don't know the one you have what do you need a new one for you know we have the word of god so our job is to hold it at the right angle so that you can see yourself you see see what's lacking because we're all trying to get out of here everybody wants to go to heaven they just don't want to go today you know and so um we always are seeking balance now yes i brought my favorite tool see first we checked the pulpit that's exactly right okay did the amish make this for you but um if you notice the cross down here it's got a short a short piece and a long piece everybody can see that right okay the long piece is your prayer life as you keep your prayer life lined up and you see you're not you're not on the side you're not going that way you're going straight to heaven so as you keep your prayer life straight god will take care of the horizontal but you must keep in balance okay and so uh i just want to mention the fact i don't i'm not going to go into a lot of details but you know my wife uh passed on a long time ago and we had the the funeral in december of 06 okay so i was you know pretty much devastated i didn't think it'd be this way but you know a few weeks before she passed we had a call from a little sister over here in west virginia and she said now uh you know this is the only second time this happened in my life but i was getting up from lunch today and there was a vision right there across the table and she said there was brother and preaching all these people preaching faith and there was a prayer line and all this was lined up and out of nowhere all of a sudden he says in your little sister thank you for praying praying for my sister my daughter rebecca and tell george not to worry everything's going to be okay well when you hear your name from eternity you begin to pay attention so i figured okay this isn't going to be the way i want it but god's in control you know the word says be still i'm god i got it all figured out don't need your opinions i'm god and we learn that the hard way a lot of times so after the funeral i remember praying and i asked god now look please keep me busy and keep me focused on the resurrection and keep me balanced and so he's done his part i've failed my own self a lot of times but he's doing his part so we're thankful so our focus today is waiting that's patience on the famous chart you know and it's a bit of a foreign concept to uh us that live in this instant world i got a friend north carolina he loves the um starbucks coffee but if there's three people in line he's not gonna wait no he wants it now he'll go across the street and pay a dollar for for mcdonald's uh instead of waiting in line well wait a minute we've got to have patience you know and so as believers that are plugged into god's economy and his perfect timing amen we are in fact waiting for the redemption of these bodies and the full salvation of our soul now it's well it's foreign to some people but you see we're saved by grace through faith in the atonement of christ we make that first step here at the altar and the atonement that was made at calvary but we're waiting for the completion or the closing we're in progress okay we're not yet perfect i hate to tell you you know all you guys are in love and newly married it's not perfect yet we're only forgiven okay so david wrote over here in psalm 62 you'll find it real quick here he wrote here in psalm 62 and verse 5 my soul is this on does she'll use this one yes or no okay we'll try not to scare you too bad uh psalm 62 5 my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall be not be moved and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before god before him god is our refuge for us so our only hope in security is in god it's not in how much you got in the bank and what your name is and who your daddy was and all that no no matter who your pastor is you gotta face god individually okay romans 13 11 says and knowing the time that now is high time to awake out of sleep and now for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed right so it's coming it's yet to be completed we're in progress and while we wait we're not wondering we're not guessing but we're busy and we're getting ready and once you you know it's not that you're ready and you stay right there no you're constantly getting ready says in first peter chapter 1 that the trial of your faith and then we have a parenthesis being much more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried in fire okay that's qualifier so that the trial of your faith might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ whom having not seen you love and him in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory that's what we can sing that's what we can pray and rejoice receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls so just give you those few verses to let you know that you haven't arrived yet you're in progress you know the devil's on the sides trying to get our attention romans 8 23 we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why does he had hope for it but if we hope for that which we see not then we do with patience wait for it so we're waiting patiently we're waiting in love now some people aren't waiting in love they're waiting with a big stick to smash anybody that doesn't see it there narrow way i'm sure you probably don't have anybody up here in ohio like that but where i come from there are people with very very narrow vision you know and anybody didn't qualify now that's what we're seeing in afghanistan right now those people which are the sons of who ismail they have no patience it's my way or no way they're burning women in the street it's crazy okay so everything of value you must wait for it as a child it was always weight i don't see too many children here but you know what i'm talking about and so they would say well no no not now later later son later when you get older and waiting for a trip was always a challenge you remember that and then as young adults with very little experience but with lots of opinions we tried to offer advice to our mother you ever tried that you ever tried it didn't work did it no no no it was a big mistake because she'd always say wait till you have children and you know i always remember my mother-in-law sister branham she uh used to say because you know she was married in in 41 and then didn't have a baby until she's you know in 1946 and caesarean and all these problems and she said um i wouldn't i wouldn't she said i wouldn't give you i wouldn't take a million dollars for that child but i wouldn't give you a nickel for another one and so my dad you know he was he wasn't patient i'll be first to admit but he said god always answers my prayers he's either yes or no or wait a while so there was always an answer you know so this christian life doesn't take us to perfection in this flesh now we take supplements and we try to stay away from the good stuff but you know we're not going to attain perfection we just don't want to you know we want to go into the into the morgue in a wheelchair you know but if that is what you're expecting perfection in this flesh well it's you're in for a big surprise these bodies are time dated yes sir yeah you know that's right so we live daily among sinners we live in a dark world totally immersed in sin and corruption after you notice that people say they don't want to come to church there's all those hypocrites sitting on the other bench well then stay out of walmart because full of them over there so we do not conform to their ways or their desires we're only looking looking around here if we start looking around we'll get nervous but the scripture says in luke 21 28 when these things start to happen look up you can't fix this i don't care who you are look up you know so that is why a believer with the holy spirit anointing his soul can walk right through dark laodicea it doesn't matter what they dress like no matter what happens you can walk right through without damage without becoming a casualty without looking like laodicea but if you if you only have the genuine anointing of god's spirit on your flesh and or your spirit while the music is playing for example you'll fail miserably end up in the hot place guaranteed so you must have the holy spirit baptism on your soul sealed securely until the day of redemption and when we get to that day of redemption hey we don't you don't have to figure any more out i got friends they're so worried about what's going to happen after the resurrection and they're so worried about that they're not paying attention right now so they're missing it all just take care of right now because you don't know that's only for those people that arrive now this is here to keep me you know focused and lets you know that we're trying to stay balanced but if i happen to see anybody dozing off see we have it's a double purpose because see you can only see one person but i can see all of you so we live here we use the benefits of uh the tools of liticia and not only survive but we're destined to become more than conquerors amen okay victorious laodicea believers when we cross over if they happen to hand out t-shirts it's not going to say survivor it's going to say more than conquerors we're beyond that you know overcomers you know in a boxing match there's two people only one gets the big belt in the check and all that right okay so he's the winner he's the overcomer but when he gives that check to his wife she's more than overcomer so let's see let's move along here um so we live in darklio to see it we all agree to that it's miserable a lot of ways but brother brandon even talked about that you see um when he was preaching in the caribbean in 1959 there was some americans with him and one of them said that he had had a four-hour interview with brother branham and so uh during this time that they were talking he asked brother random why do you mention 1977 which was 18 years ahead and why are you even asking a dumb question you might not live that long you know but uh brother brahm said well because when i was looking through this through the stream of time of course you're seeing numbers he said by the time i got to 1977 it was so dark that i didn't see how any believer could live in that darkness that's speaking in 1959 but now we're over here what 44 years later it's real dark see but the redeemed are waiting in love many are waiting to hear the gospel for the first time yeah that's hard to believe because we got it on the radio we got a tv we've got every place you know we've got several versions of brother brown's messaging on our phone you see right now everything brother brahms said in several languages and the entire king james bible is on every phone on the planet so there's no lack of word it's a matter of taking it in so you can go through the grocery store i don't care how good a cook you are but you go through the grocery store and if you don't partake of it you can read all the labels yeah this will do that that you can do all that and die right there in the grocery store because you didn't partake of it and we got people sitting in churches kind of the same way so many people are hearing are waiting to hear the gospel for the first time in fact we got a missionary going over to egypt this week to carry the gospel to get something for those people so through radio through the internet it's reaching people that we can't reach you see now in the ministry of jesus christ um he didn't we don't read about the nicest people in society do we we read about people we wouldn't even let in the door this church i know it's rough but of course they got to find it first but no we we got to be careful who and how we talk to people just let your light shine you see many hundreds of of dangerous drug people have heard the gospel and have been baptized and a lot of them died before the sun came up the next day because they knew too much and they can't let them go that's happening in mexico especially but they're playing this message on their own network it's it's going out over the waves because the guy at the top he wants it heard so the book of acts is not finished it's being written right now you see and you are a part of it thank you for your help now many people in the scriptures had to wait i know it's hard to believe but there was old simeon for example in luke chapter 2. he was waiting for the consolation of israel he was old he lived right next door to the church and so god told him you're not going to die until you see the consolation and only he knew what sign he was looking for he didn't tell anybody he knew what he was looking for and so he he didn't know how long he didn't know if it was next week or next year when he sees a certain thing then he knew that he would be moving on so he would go out maybe they have a certain day of the week i don't know but they'd go out there and he would see all those women with those little babies no nothing today and go back to bed but one day he goes out and he saw a sign what god showed him to look for it and god deals with each one of us individually he's not going to put a cloud over the sky you know and say certain things it's individual and so only only uh he and mary and joseph knew what was happening so he goes up to mary said can i hold a child sure because they think they were on the same page he raised the baby said now you let thy servant depart in peace my eyes have seen what do you see a crying baby but that was the promise of the age you see and so um he was one of a very few back then that recognized the anointed messiah the value of what god was doing in present tense anybody can look back and and see you know the book of acts and all these things that it was real where is it today we got the scripture that we repeat all the time jesus christ saying yesterday today and forever so we argue about what happened there we argue about what's going to happen tomorrow where is he today don't worry about those things now so that's what happened in israel back then when you know jesus was born what about israel today well as you know they're in the homeland fulfillment of scripture they're waiting for the messiah and they're crying out for for redemption god has it all under control so in our scripture in luke chapter 8 verse 40 long in there also in mark 5 there was a lady up on the hillside and like brother brown paints the picture she was in her rocker she was knitting and she saw this little crowd gathering down at the harbor and at this point she had been sick for many years 12 years i believe and so she'd spent all her money doctors couldn't help her couldn't figure it out kind of like today and nothing for no relief agonizing waiting for her healing but she was up there and she saw this little boat come along and jesus was coming back from gudera which is the other side of you know the eight miles and so um uh she thought she'd go down and see what's going on and she started hearing whispers oh jesus jesus is here i've heard about him i saw him you know reflected in some other people but here he is and she she had in her mind if i can just touch the hem of his garment just just touch that i'll be fine so she made her way through the crowd all these people and she touched his garment somewhere and then she backed off and went over and sat down and then jesus said uh wait a minute here somebody touch me and guess who was there big mouth peter oh please lord look at this crowd what are you talking about peter take a seat i know what i'm talking about and so he looked and he deserved it was you and she was healed and so um we have also in luke 19 where jesus was walking through jericho and you've heard brother tell it many times he's walking through jericho and everybody wants to touch him and the disciples said now stand back stand back monster's tired so he's coming through and walking slowly and there was a man there that was waiting and his name was zacchaeus now zacchaeus you know thanks mommy give him to give him that name with that z you know so only not only was he short but he was always the last guy in line had a problem you know so he thought i'll get a good look at this guy i'll decide if he's you know a proper man if he's profit or whatever and so he and his wife rebecca owned a restaurant and jesus was coming through town so here's that kiosk up in the tree and he's looking down on him looking watch him come along and jesus stopped right under the tree hey zacchaeus come on down going to your house for lunch and so he went to this house for lunch and they had they had a meal and so zacchaeus was convinced he was converted now he was a tax collector okay he was the worst kind of person just like today and uh and so he says now if i've if i've heard anybody he knew who he'd hurt he had records what's his if business if i if i've done anything well i'll pay them four times and all that they know they're wrong you know there was another man that was waiting when jesus got through with lunch he's leaving um he's leaving with jericho and now back then they didn't have any planes everything everybody walked so they had walls around the cities and that was their security now uh this man bartimaeus he was blind okay probably born blind we don't know but he was sitting in the shade of the wall the sun goes out so he's in the shade and um and they didn't have german shepherd dogs so they trained this this lamb to take him over there and bring it back to the house you know so there he is begging for money there's all this noise going on and you'll find that mark chapter 10 and so he's um he's he's hearing this noise and he asked his buddy what's all this noise about well is that so-called prophet jesus jesus is here why didn't you tell me and so he starts crying out son of david have mercy now there's 200 people or more and several yards away jesus probably didn't hear him but he contacted his spirit and he turned back and he healed him so this crowd is growing as they're leaving jericho and they're going up to jerusalem and when you read in the bible they went up to jerusalem because jerusalem's at 2 400 feet above sea level and jericho is uh about 500 more feet below sea level or a thousand feet so up to jerusalem uh they they climb 3600 feet in 24 miles up if you come from the coast it's also up and so the crowd's growing they're all headed for for jerusalem and so they stopped at a certain place and um jesus sent his disciples said you know a couple of steps now go over that other village and you're going to find a donkey over there and the donkey has a baby a white baby you know a foal now bring them over here if anybody says anything just tell them master has need now he didn't just make this up no 500 years before that there was a prophet in zechariah 9 9 says rejoice daughter of jerusalem thy king cometh to thee yeah he's just he has salvation he's lowly that means he's humble and he's writing on a cadillac a white truck no riding on a coat just a young you know young donkey small insignificant donkey now in those 500 years see that was spoken back there when 500 years that's like from from the time martin luther until today a lot of things can happen in 500 years so some people heard this this um this prophecy they read it and so you know this farmer has a little white donkey all of a sudden well that's the one praise god this is the one well five miles away another one had a donkey and so there was a lot of argument there was a lot of interpretations imagine that but there's only one fulfillment so after that happened it's finished well this crowd is on the way to the temple okay screaming from psalm 118 hosanna well now we say hosanna and in their language hostile now blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord they're all excited man this is the man and so forth now the romans they're the police they're watching they're supposed to be keeping order and they had no revelation and there was the pharisees now the pharisees knew their bible perfectly without an ipad right they read it they memorized it they knew what it said and to them this guy did not fulfill the scripture okay so they were waiting but they weren't waiting in love they're waiting in arrogance they were good at that waiting for an opportunity to belittle jesus the manifested word of the hour and show their bad attitude you know and so even over there in luke 19 uh where this all is uh is uh written uh they jumped out in front of the parade you know master rebuked these people calm them down a bunch of fanatics what they're saying about you you know that you're not that person well he knew that he was but see they had no revelation now they knew their words the prophet's words perfectly and to their limited understanding this man didn't fit the description because they've been taught a certain way just like all of our relatives that are taught a certain way they can't accept the you know the the message of the bible somehow they imagine that that matthew 28 19 is right and that peter just kind of flubbed here in acts chapter 2 and all the rest of them all the way through acts well wait a minute what does the bible say and these are these are high standing baptists and all of them you know no revelation to so their limited understanding back then this man jesus didn't fit the description that they had learned in school they were legalists afraid that somebody was going to be happy in church scared to death that the prophet's words might be manifested and bloom out into present tense that's what they couldn't handle see and so today here we are in 2021 and all of us that are over 50 we never thought we'd see this day but here we are still walking around so we have any number of people today ready to listen and they can quote it word for word but scared to death of any fulfillment of the prophetic word they cannot say this day this scripture is fulfilled you see and um and so for a person to stand in the pope and say this is that they can't take it you see it's exactly what brother brahm talked about so jesus was waiting also he was waiting for his opportunity and he said to these uh religious scholars and boys i can make them be quiet they'll be quiet but do y'all see these rocks here if i tell them to be quiet all these rocks are gonna start screaming at the same thing and guess what the rocks are still there yeah so friends we walk by faith not by sight we don't want we're not going through this thing by what we can see it looks terrible i mean in the last 18 months the the number of suicides has gone up and all these problems because one little italian guy said we've got to do this i'm going to do that and do the other it's nonsense yes people are dying but they could have solved this a long time ago okay so we walk by faith and god does encourage us from time to time by letting us see some evidence he does answer our prayers yes no or wait a while our only desire is to please god with our thoughts our words and our deeds right and we're directed by his word and by his spirit brother abraham says you will have difficulty with this flesh until the day he calls you home oh man i thought pills was going to solve everything sorry but by grace by the grace of god every believer will overcome okay so how are we going to overcome this dark world is falling apart scripture says and they overcame him the evil one by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony everybody's got a testimony that combined with the blood that's how we overcome you see that's in your testimony it's what you manifest so just what are you reflecting here in dark laodicea what exactly are you feeding on did you take time from tv to come to church well it's going to take a lot more in church to solve your problem you see are you balanced john 4 23 is where jesus met the woman at the well and brother bram mentions it's just battery tape and you know she thought she had it together but he said look honey you all don't know what you're talking about salvation is of the jews but god is looking for those that will worship him in spirit and in truth we can have a lot of spirit you know and beat those drones until they fall apart with no truth you're not going to work you can have all kinds of truth and have the doctrine perfect and no spirit you're still out you got to be balanced okay so what do your children see in you you know children record everything yeah from about the you know six months they should start recording it all you know and um what does your wife see in you she's the one that knows you best uh what does your unconverted neighbor see in you see we're on display all the time you know um the there was a man in the catholic church by the name of francis of assists if any of you was raised catholic you probably remember that name well brother brown said he was a preacher of the gospel preacher and he said one day 900 years ago he said preach always use words when necessary well how do we do that well brother brown said it very simply live your message your neighbors aren't interested in what william branham said that is the least of their problems they're watching you they're watching to see if your life matches what you say because today we all got this cell phone so blah blah blah blah and eventually that doesn't balance out without what we're doing it's got to come in balance right here so just live your message then if there's something in them they will ask yes why do you have long hair why do you do this why do you do that and then we can point him to the word you can't bring him to the pastor every time you got to know that you've been here more than six months you've got to have something on the mall so if you live your message they will ask questions now in second peter chapter one we have also a more sure word of prophecy under which you do well that you take heed in other words you must do it as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day star arrives in your hearts so we got to stay balanced we got to stay ready we've got to stay in step with the beat the rhythm of the pure gospel of jesus christ and you must maintain the vertical connection okay now in this message where's it at 65 uh where is it february 17 to 65. okay this is very important now i was you know i've lived through all of this and back then brother branham had made uh he had a lot of questions about marriage and divorce because some people was messed up so he kept promising okay so now he's going to be in jeffersonville february of 65 and he's got four messages that he's going to preach and then sunday morning he's going to be marriage and divorce so everybody's there well he drove by himself kids were in school you know everything so he drove all the way back there now when brother and drove by himself sometimes there's no lie sometimes he would get his notepad out and he'd start writing put his glasses on and the car was going by itself turn whatever yeah that happened so anyway he gets there uh i think he drove straight through so he got there some sometime wednesday morning church is gonna be thursday friday thursday friday saturday and sunday so he gets the early wednesday and um he's you know cleaned up and he says well i can't just stay up the house all those people down there at church so he goes down thinking he'll you know just have some fellowship well brother neville saw him come in brother bill up here well he doesn't have anything he just came down to have fellowship and that's when he preached this great message a man running from the presence of the lord so he says i i believe we have truth i'm satisfied of that and i believe the wheat absolutely the shuck is pulling away from it clear back there that was that was starting to happen see so we don't have to wonder we don't have to question if this is true or not it is true it's scripture it's not like my friends in salt lake city that have to you know massage it and kind of add some things to it no we believe the scriptures you see god says so and he's admit he's vindicated and he's still vindicating it there's people being baptized every day in africa and in brazil in these places and it's it's happening even after all these years this doesn't depend on brother branham being here we have god's word it's opened it up to us you see so god continues to vindicate the truth in many countries many languages so we should respect this ministry and not lean to our own understanding and try to figure it out and correct all the things we don't like no we don't have time for that stuff no um the scripture says in in psalm 46 10 be still i'm god got it all in control just follow you know so we got to stay in balance to avoid extremes yes brother brown says it took the catholics two thousand years to get where they are today and took pentecostal people 50 years to get to the same place now all you mathematicians know that brother rem's been gone 55 years it puts us in a pretty bad shape we got idolatry amongst us you know and so um we're in worse conditions sometimes and it's not the fault of the matter of the messenger it's because we've got unbalanced teaching unbalanced preaching a lot of noise and no substance so imagine building this church without a level you got to have one of these no matter what you're doing right you know these nice cars you got out here you take them to the tire shop and they put on the machine and they take a 50 cent piece of lead and they tack it on a certain place now you got a smooth ride so if you go taking it off it's going to be trouble so we got to have balance okay um so i've traveled to many countries and i was looking the other day in 2010 which was a long time ago but i visited 18 countries i can't go anywhere right now so god has me coming up here and i'll be back promise me back on a sunday i promise but um so i've been in a lot of places okay i've seen extremes i've seen where candles are part of some people's worship that are following this message there's people in south america right now that have candles in front of william branham's picture they didn't change they just changed pictures you know yeah so um how do good people arrive at extremes by not saying what paul said that's right we got we got paul's words over here in in galatians 1 8 where he says he's in starting in verse 6 i'm marvel that you're so soon removed from him that called you into grace of christ and to another gospel amen semicolon which is not another but there be some among you and we got them today that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but if i come back next week or even if an angel comes down okay and preaches something different than what i've already given you by revelation he's accursed but see we're so uh forgiving and we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings so if if somebody comes in this church and starts you know saying that william brandwell really wasn't a messenger and starts putting doubt you throw him out right but they can come in another guy can come in and start making it bigger than it really is and we accept that you know it's got to be balanced you see and so therefore they cannot ever produce the fruit of the word they can only produce fruit of their leaders opinions and unbalanced explanations now god is not nervous he's got a schedule everything's working out perfectly ephesians 4 11 through 16 is one sentence we're not going to read it today but you can check it out later so these ministries that god has put into the church they're god ordained god placed and god vindicated and they work in harmony okay they're walking in step with the messenger of the age under the same anointing that way uh it's it's important that you listen to what the messenger said that way you know something's going in the right way or not so the solution is back to the sure word of prophecy the original proverbs 3 5 lean not to your own understanding because it will fail every time so extremes are very dangerous we've got to stay in tune we've got to stay in step with god's program this entire package of 1200 tapes that we have we call the message it's only the vehicle that brings us back to the open book the message doesn't stand over here by itself and only us is going to go to heaven god's got people everywhere and he doesn't need our opinion about it you know so may god help us in the message great servant moses 1955 and as moses went with the judgment stick before him that same stick tonight to the church is jesus christ if those egyptians could ever got that little simple stick out of moses hands they would have had him whipped and when the devil can ever get the deity out of the name of jesus christ he's got the church whip and that's why we have powerless groups of people everywhere that because they've taken the deity out of jesus christ and put it in this organization and this man somewhere else god's not pleased and god doesn't judge you know every saturday no he lets it go see god's got a lot more patience than we do right it's up to me i had to wipe the whole thing off a long time ago but god has patience he lets things go on and on and on and he's watching how people react to the whole thing see so there were forces in the days of william branham and their forces today to separate the deity out of christ it only causes confusion causes doubt and takes the people away from jesus christ and they mislocate the deity into a person a ministry or group and god is not pleased our god doesn't share his glory with anybody no god doesn't share his glory even brother branham after years of ministry and who knows how many thousands of people been healed all these great mysteries been revealed he would say now if god will come and bless us tonight he didn't have a push button ministry because he said so no he was he was humble so we're we've lived long enough now to see the results of some of these misguided ministries and failure is right ahead we do have one example and now this is extreme but uh we're dealing with reality and so over in the in the congo in africa there's a lot of people over there a lot of so-called believers you talk about church you know 15 000 people were you gonna have a percentage of believers make believers and unbelievers it's just that way and so there was a man that uh he was you know supposedly a believer and he got so sidetracked and so anointed in the wrong direction that he was preaching to a bunch of people under a tree one day and so he um he said now william branham is god's prophet and he's higher than jesus christ you know it is much more important than jesus christ and so he took the huffman's head of you know the picture he ripped it and he stepped on it he said i'm not telling the truth my god strike me dead and right now he died i mean there's he's pot he's dead so they they saw wow this is real so they got him loaded up on a bicycle or something they're going to take him over to his village to bury him the worms were already eating him they had to bury him on the way you don't mess with god isaiah 40 31 speaks to us about waiting they that wait now that's not everybody but those that wait on the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they'll walk and not faint so one of god's favorite methods of preparing us for something great is to send us into the shadows to wait okay but that doesn't mean that you're doomed to terminal darkness take heart from this british author his name is james stalker he said waiting is a common instrument of providential discipline for those to whom exceptional work has been appointed we shall come up with that but it's true now the book of esther for example for example in the old testament you need to read it this week it's a great love story about god's providential care how he cared for his people okay he he does care for his own all ages everywhere and it's the only book in the bible where god's not even mentioned you know i think one other book but god's not mentioned in this book and there's not one mention of it in the in the new testament esther was just another jewish girl got taken away prisoner to persia which is iran today but by god's choice things worked around she became queen okay and god blessed her to deliver the jewish people um from destruction showing that god is always in control i know some of this looks disjointed to you but you can chew on it next week you'll find out that god's footed together so she was another believer that waited in chapter 4 verse 16 she came to her hour of decision okay and there seems to be a blank space in the three days from verse 17 to chapter five uh verse one nothing's recorded of the drama nothing's happening it was during this time that she was fasting and she was praying and she was seeking the mind of jehovah getting ready for no doubt and reading these words of prophet isaiah from 300 years earlier in chapter 41 where it says fear thou not i am with thee be not dismayed i am thy god i will strengthen the yea i will help thee i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness verse 11 behold all they that are incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing and they that strive with thee shall perish so she found her identification in the word not in somebody's ideas you see so when the believer in our age that we live in is in tune with the spirit of god that believer can identify with the portion that applies and you will see how god will make it come alive in your life in your particular circumstances it works okay as you as an individual so you may be going through some dark days you might be going through whatever trial you know we all have problems and um it would seem that nothing's happening but it's during those times that you need balance you gotta get it straight you see reading god's word and you and every individual can create your own personal private atmosphere i've been on planes people doing all kinds of things but i'm over here concentrating on the word just to create my own atmosphere you know it's that time when you need to pull back i'm not rushing into this uncertain situation no i have no direction can't find my way i believe i'll just wait and see what god directs and what he says now rarely does he going to give you a cloud formation over your house it's probably not going to happen and you're looking for something over here and you're just really striving where is that thing and then for some reason you got to look oh here it is right here happens every time you know so all you had to do was wait now let's see what brother adam says here in the god of this evil age which was the first of august of 1965. now if you notice but you know every so many years the same dates follow the same days and 2021 is the same days as 1965. so we had august the first sunday we'll have august 1st sunday back there he says here she the bride is part of the groom true to him in every point waiting for the wedding supper waiting for the wedding the uniting not at that communical council but in the sky at the wedding supper she has been given and has been revealed to her the seven seal mysteries of the bible okay um she sees the folly of the deceiver so she's watching both angles she sees the the truth she sees the deceiver okay um so very close to the truth almost deceives the elected she sees it she um she sees the two opposing spirits that work in this simple age can you see it each very religious we have cain and abel those spirits again coming to their heads to full manifestation still the same as they started so there's no change they're just maturing you see one worshiping by beauty by knowledge education science ethics all sounds great and let's go for it the other one by faith of the revelation of the word of god oh that's better that means you know that you know and he said both of them are standing in this building this morning i was there that sunday he baptized me the next day now so just because people come to church and make some kind of sacrifice and give tithes and offerings that's normal but how many are living the gospel the other one by the faith of the revelation of the word of god that's right this one is a prostitute the bible says she's the mother of harlots and they all come together and that kind of a woman is a woman that's untrue to her husband and claiming christ as her husband and belonging to a denomination such nonsense saying we belong to christ okay world's full of them but in obedience this little faith woman that lives by faith the bride a person here over there somewhere else some other denomination wherever she is she believes the word of god she's obedient waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed now if you're waiting for something to be confirmed you've got to know what that is okay you can't just be sitting on the porch waiting for the check no you gotta gotta know what it's all about she is watching for it she is part of that word and she's watching for her life to manifest that word that's what she's watching for don't worry about everybody else myself so she's not looking for flaws in others she's not looking for doctrinal differences qualifying everybody by my limited understanding you know i mean i don't know why all this stuff in afghanistan i'm not in charge i don't understand what they're doing i just know that we're going to leave soon you know they're polishing up the plane they're fueling the plane it's about ready to leave but you got to get ready so if anything is out of order just wait god will bring the correction at the right time and with the right spirit we usually make a big mess out of it if we try to correct stuff you know so he says she's watching for her life to manifest that word so she has to know the word so that she'll know when it's manifested so we belong in the word they asked brother brandon you know 60 years ago how can i be a better christian see people like a set of rules do this this you're in no read your word your bible and pray oh we already knew that well then do it you know so she's not out slamming everybody you know correcting everybody she's waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed watching for her life to manifest that word so may god help us now after all this traveling and everything life i've lived i found this one thing to be true illustrious preaching does not always translate into victorious living i know preachers man they can preach the house down but then you go from here to the hotel and somebody pulls out they're ready to shoot him wait a minute what happened no brother branham lived what he preached now he was you know he was no pushover but i wasn't attracted to this message by the miracles and oh wow that's wonderful no i was attracted because here's a man that was living the word of god i'd already read my bible i knew what it said in some places you know i didn't know it all but i knew the spirit of the bible it's like brother bram says he he read about uh oh is it um uh tarzan and he want to be like tarzan you know i live in trees well i i'd read my bible i knew what the spirit of the bible was and now here's a man that's living that spirit you know so um william branham didn't uh waste any time pounding and slamming all those that didn't believe it just like he did if he was only going to go out and visit those who believed it like him he'd have never left the corner but people wanted to see the miracles they want to see the gift and he went and preached the truth so can you see yourself in this word that's the question for today you know can we see ourself in the mirror of the word god gives you the peace that goes way beyond all the things you can understand way beyond the religious fanaticism the legalism the peace of god is in harmony with the spirit of the scriptures the bible says in romans 8 28 all things work together not just sitting here but out there tomorrow all things work together for good to them that love god and to them that are called according to his purpose two requirements so don't waste your time or the pastor's time trying to figure things out it doesn't work no just relax wait in love for the manifestation of the promise in your life and while you wait prayer is very important we're almost done in a message jesus christ the same in chicago the devils tremble when the weakest of saints goes to their knees what a power and a privilege has been given to the church of the living god when you follow your knees in prayer even the devils tremble and the devil knows when it's just from the teeth out he can tell if it's real or not you know so brother brown had to wait he had to be obedient he had to walk by faith every day when he was getting ready to preach the seven seals you know they rebuilt the church remodeled it and so he's back there and he talks about that but anyway when he's on the way to the pulpit for the first service he came by billy's office he said ability you need to pray for dad i don't have any idea what we tell these people he's already invited them all they're all there great expectation but he had to walk by faith you see in the message the new ministry of 1959 that you might know that the sovereign grace reigns with god did you know that those two boys and sister had his two boys that woman's children that were saved god knew that before the foundation of the world and their names were actually put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and your children and you it was all done back there you see the bible says that and it only had to work down to this minute in other words there's a time for things to manifest you see and um and so god he says did you know that god knew we would be standing here 10 million years before the world was founded did you know that he knew we'd be standing here the infinite sea of god that's opposite of being finite of god knew every fly every gnat so every mosquito every cockroach everything you know how many times they would bat their eyes and how much towel that would produce excuse me just a minute well i might get this off help thank you yeah so god knew all these things right before the world was formed he knew all that how many cockroaches how many times they would bat their eyes he says here well if if he knows that then why are you preaching that's part of god's program preaching is his program so if you listen close enough you'll find that all your problems are solved within brother brown's message he covers it all so he says preaching is his program when he looked on the apostles and he looked upon the harvest he said you know the harvest is right but the laborers are few pray to the lord of the harvest and he will send laborers into his harvest he says why would they have to pray to the lord of the harvest to send laborers into his harvest if the lord of the harvest was standing there knowing how it would be done great question he says god has so arranged it all that his program cannot move without you and me and as long as we're not doing what god leads us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the holy ghost then we're in god's will doing this program very simple so you know many times we rehearsed the story of abraham and sarah right and they were they were living down in hebron and there's a big oak tree there remember all that the tree's still there they got records of 5 000 years of that tree when i was there in 84 they still had green leaves on it so they waited in love not knowing it would be 25 years it thought it'd be next month he kept asking you know all that so they returned back young for one purpose that the word of god would be fulfilled god can do anything so he says over here in this one message he showed in abraham and sarah what he's going to do to you and your wife one of these days turn you back young again we are the seed of we are the seed of abraham on our road to the promise now mine's already turned back she's waiting for me i got to behave because i want to go so um there's a friend of mine had a dream about three years ago now when rebecca was very sick i'll just put this in here we got time right um she wasn't just anybody this is somebody lived with william brennan for 19 years she knew what faith was it's all miracles and so forth and then she got stuck with me but um so when she's real sick i said now now honey god can heal you make you brand new in the next 10 minutes you know that but if he chooses to take you which we have no you know we have no uh promise of any kind but if he chooses to take you then find your dad and wait for me there well as turned out that's what happened and so then just about two years ago um this uh brother had a dream he called me he was talking about it now he only speaks spanish and we're talking but in the dream he says i was in heaven and so in heaven he's he's talking to william random this is his dream and so they're talking and um and so one of the questions that he he asked he said brother brown uh down there where i live a lot of people say you've got to come back and do all these things he got real stern he said look i have said everything i have to say but if i was to come back you know the way they want i'd have to take a few people to the woodshed and you didn't mention my name okay so so he's talking to him and he notices this young girl is standing on you know they're hooked onto his arm he looked real close ah that's rebecca of course and so she gives him a big smile and she said tell george i'm waiting right where he told me so it is real well let's see if we can finish up here real quick um you know that in the one message in 1963 some greeks had seen a reflection of jesus and some of the believers but they want to see the real man you know if they see you on the on the street someplace yeah but where do you go to church we want to we'll have what you have so they wanted to see him and brother brown says some greeks had heard now they wanted to see jesus they had heard now they wanted to see him they didn't want to see a lecturer you know all the boards perfectly some pulpit clown now why would he use this term back in 63 because there are such not some entertainer they want to see him jesus christ he says god doesn't send entertainers he sends preachers to preach his word it's all through the message so we have the example of the of the uh executive of the armor meat company remember so this guy you know he finally decided he wanted a wife want to settle down and so his company owned some ranches out west and so he goes out west looking for a bride well they heard he was coming so they fixed up the place you know and when he got there well they've had all the amazon stuff coming it looks just like it was back home big deal and so they had entertainment and everything well he'd left all that behind but he was looking for something genuine now if you go to cracker barrel and you look at the pictures real closely they didn't marry the women back then because they were beautiful they married him because they could work i mean it's just facts and so and so this thank you guys thank you um this this guy was looking for a real a real worker somebody that he could depend on you know and so he'd been through all this stuff so on the last day they're putting on the big party and uh he noticed this one girl he hadn't seen all week and she was carrying out the water because they didn't have faucets you know you bring it in and take it out and so um he followed her out and you know the whole story right he goes out there and he says do you know why i'm here you know who i am yeah we know you are you're looking for a wife yeah he says i've seen all your your relatives in there but god has spoken to me and says you're the one no but i just got this one dress and i don't have any shoes and i've got this calluses and i've got problems god told me you're the one well just like brother samuel did one day he convinced her you know that she's the one and so he made her a promise i'll be back one year from today august 20 right there's a 19. yeah so august 19 i'll be back and um and all she had to do was get ready right she had to wait and get ready and she waited in love and she suffered ridicule and persecution because guess what he left and so the next day she had to get up early set the table get the croissants ready get the tea and everything and and then she disappeared because the cousins they were too fancy they couldn't get their fingernails dirty or anything so they're having their tea did he ask you did he ask you he didn't ask anybody what a bummer well where's that ugly cousin of ours well they're looking for her well she's back there in her room what are you doing well hey tell you all but he said i'm the one ah it's not possible it is possible that's why i'm working on this dress and so she she worked on her dress now the ridicule she got wasn't from the people of the next ranch or the people in town it was under her own roof the same house you see drank the same water and everything so she continued to get ready you know doing all the work and so forth and so then she's marking the calendar now they didn't believe so they weren't marker no calendar but she was marking the counter because she believed and nothing could convince her otherwise they tried nothing could separate her from the love of the one that made her the promise she had his word there was no phone there was no email she had his word it was worth something and he says one year from today i'll be back get ready so as time goes on you know the day's coming i see she had to wash watch what she ate because they didn't have stretch material back then she's making this dress you know and so she um she knew the day was coming boy the calendar's not gonna lie and um so sure enough she heard the buck board coming she heard the horses coming now when you live in the country you know how it used to be if somebody's coming bar all stretching their neck out see who it is well she already knew who it was she didn't have to stretch her neck out she got the last part of the dress ready and everything and the buck board stopped out there and they all started wow he did come back and we're not ready but she showed up in her dress out of the way girls she got the bunker board took off and they never saw her again and that's about what's going to happen to us so may god bless you and we will come back some other time to finish this thank you brother samuel i'll take this let's do it amen you know it's uh patience is one thing that we can all we all need more of and you know as the lord jesus you find over and over in in lives and things that's all the way through the scripture even when god would speak to joseph and joseph it had a dream vision many things unfolded but it only happened at god's appointed time but it just shows that even with everything that god has promised us and you know it brings us to this place that as brother brahman says if there was something that came contrary to the word we stay with the word and i think brother george he he spoke and mentioned that tonight and as paul went through that in galatians 1. brother brahm says if the vision tells you something he said you can believe that he said this word has made us promises and so to see that within it these are promises that even that god has made to us remember when it came to i think it's in hebrews 6 it says you have need of patience after you've done the will of god there's many times the things that we we don't receive first of all we have to evaluate have we done the will of god have we you know when the bible says if there be any sick among you let them call for the elders of church if they if there be any sin let them confess it let all that be put aside and then pray the prayer of faith anointing them with oil all those things in order god will never skip the order is that right the bible says he gives the holy ghost to them that belief amen that obey him so you see within all these things the patience we look at every one of the the characters that god spoke to us tonight in every one of them there's things that even when you look back in their life as abraham and the rest of them i think god even made it very clear to us tonight they were no different as james would write they were men of of subject to like passion such as we are but here's the thing they looked with expectation if something didn't happen today they were waiting for it tomorrow that's when it's a reality to where if it doesn't happen today we're waiting tomorrow brother brahms said it like this i think it in 1964 the message look he said abraham didn't look at all the misunderstandings of the promise he looked to the one who made the promise we have a lot of misunderstandings there's things that look there's a lot of things that even sometimes we're praying about things and it doesn't come out the way that we would desire it to come out but everything itself we know god's will cannot be overrode and the greatest thing that can place us into that place of waiting is to have the life of christ inside of us then what is that it's not us looking for him but it's christ inside of us looking for himself so for every junction of time of things that to me this is it's just tremendous because then what are we looking for we're not looking through our own lens we're looking through christ is that right he's the i that god has sent to guide the church so then no matter what comes about as brother george was saying if we're we are lined up vertically then all the horizontal things all the things that come if you you know you look on a tombstone and you see a tombstone you see this date where or this year when they were born or this date and then this date and in between they put a little dash it's all is a little dash but in that dash is life there's events this print this person if you looked around on different tombstones if they could have all the timeline wrote out you this one this happened at this time and this one happened at this time and you could look and say well this one you know maybe they got their first job at this age and this one got their first job at this age this one got married at this age this one got but you see all of our lives it's in god's hands and in that dash that's why being in connection with god and him being in our life then we can look and what we're looking for is we want to stay in step with him i want to stay instead i don't want to miss him even in the job that i take or the job that we say no to we don't want to miss god that's what matters more to us as believers more than anything else is i don't want to come out of line i want to stay right in line in a place to where god can speak to me move and deal with my life because what means more than everything of this earth and that's his coming it's him and not just waiting for that moment but even in this time right now it's a joy to walk in his presence it's a joy to know it it's a peace that you can know i'm in god's will i'm just waiting i'm waiting and i'm looking you know how god brought it tonight there's also another scripture i love brother george was going through those the very last scripture in first corinthians 15 which is my goodness a chapter you know when you think of the very change when this mortality shall put on immortality the very last scripture that while waiting for this paul wrote and said see that you abound in the work of the lord it's everything just it's god lining everything up and brother branham i'm just just hearing it again here today and as brother brahem is going through that and god and simplicity in the breach and he's saying remember he brings us back that he said you can't remember he said about the handkerchief if it's got to be here so and so has to put it there they have to do that but it's god it's god overseeing it and i say god let me just be simple enough to the parts and the places just to be open and yielded to you because when it's all said and done you or i can't say my i yielded to that no it was god's grace that ministered to us that we could yield there's nothing that we can glory in but what a place to be waiting in christ it's a place of rest it's a place that we can it's solid ground it's a place we have a great expectation it's a place in christ and if we're just locked in with him you can't miss what god has for you you can't miss it if you're locked into christ amen hallelujah [Music] let's just sing this let's just just let the rain of the holy spirit just water in that word here tonight waiting in the love of god oh let the world live in me dear lord show me myself within show me myself and show me my savior [Music] yes well let's let it be a prayer oh just let the world [Music] [Music] every place lord within
