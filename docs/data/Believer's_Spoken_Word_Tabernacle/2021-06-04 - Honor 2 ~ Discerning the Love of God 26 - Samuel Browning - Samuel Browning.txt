every heart and life here tonight lord minister to us in a special way i pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen and amen let's turn if you would in the scriptures here too first corinthians 13. just want to say it just such a such a good weekend presence of the lord amen things that what god has has done you know there's things that when you see god just doesn't work abruptly god works and he builds and he builds and he builds and he keeps moving and god just comes and he he does things well don't he yeah he just and this is the thing that we just we just so thank god for that and just how the lord just moved they meant so richly right here among us in these services i tell you that's just a little foretaste of glory amen just the the real just it just was wonderful i i just you know it's always one of those things i always i get you know when it comes time to go to the house of god i always get i always get excited you know it was one of those times even i think about when it comes to special meetings my goodness i just it's just the time just can't wait to just to be able to get together because if god does special things amen there's things that god does amen very very very special and i believe god i know he did special things this past weekend amen so we just want to invite him here tonight just let's read in the word of the lord here tonight just just invite him to come and speak to us in in first corinthians chapter 13 and verse 1 paul would say though i would speak with the tongues of men and have angels i have not charity i am become as a sounding brass or a team or a tingling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing we understand when we're speaking of this charity we're not speaking of ophelia love we're not speaking of that of a human love we're speaking of the divine love of almighty god but the same love that reaches out and deals with our heart and draws us to him brings conviction in our life is now that same love that comes to reside in the heart of the believer so not only is that love abiding in us but we are abiding in him amen so this is this is what paul is speaking of in verse 4 charity suffereth long and is kind i want you to notice paul shifts here in these next parts of the scripture and he begins to say what it is not it doesn't envy it doesn't bond itself it's not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not our own it isn't easily not it is not easily provoked and it thinketh no he so we want to just look at this a little bit more tonight this evening may i ask the lord to bless the word as you're being seated tonight his presence let's say just welcome chad brother dave's brother-in-law good to see you here tonight trust you all been having some good fishing sorry i can't be there um but i want to look here at this and and we look at this tonight you know as we go through the scripture and you see as it points out of what charity is not and you know we can take many different examples upon that one of the ways it's wrote even in the amplified bible this particular phrase does not behave itself unseemly it means it is not rude which is unmannerly or does not act on becoming so when we want to look at this here i want to look at it because we recognize the word of god the word of god is not a list of do's and don'ts and that's not what paul is trying to set forth here in any way paul is not trying to set forth that there is a prescribed tenets or or commandments or you have to do this or you don't have to do this but he's letting it be known that the nature of god has come and the divine love of god has come on earth to bring a ransom and there is a reality of how that the church of god is to display itself and to act and i believe this with all my heart that you do not need to teach somebody how to be a christian you only let them meet god one time and there's a heart that gets changed on the inside and now they become teachable by the spirit of god there's things that sure that god has to he will speak to us as things that we'll look in here tonight of things that god will remind you and i love and remind us and speak to us upon different things but i do not believe that there is a certain parts of you know do these steps and these steps here you'll be a christian i think it's very fitting as dr bosworth would say it like this in the book christ is the healer and your brother brother bosworth would say it like this and you know how brother branham felt about brother bosworth brother bosworth said he said i think we're too busy teaching people he said on how to be a christian instead of getting them to christ because when you get them to christ then christ himself comes on the inside and there's a transforming power that takes place you see if christ himself if the holy ghost he promised that he would be a teacher when he would come and this is one of the things that even that i look for is a life because it doesn't matter of all the manifestations of everything else that can take place but if they are teachable because if we're not teachable then the teacher isn't there but if the teacher's on the inside we can be corrected we can learn we can grow because he is a teacher he takes his word and he brings it to past within our life and so when we look at this i want to look really at the contrast of it if if charity itself does not behave it behave itself unseemly then i want to look at the contrast of that and let's look at the positive that what charity itself will do it will actually conduct itself in honor it will conduct itself in a manner so that there is a testimony that cannot be evil spoken of it will produce an honor that no matter whether the person is a believer or an unbeliever we can honor that person we can honor that not honor their sin because all through the scriptures you'll find that even where it says to honor all men it is not speaking of honoring the wickedness or the sin of the sinner but yet to actually honor the man how could we honor them by being respectful by being nice it doesn't matter what they look like they might look so scary they might have all sorts of things you know earrings and everything else but there's a soul down there on the inside so there's a way that you and i and it's not just those in that condition but even among us as believers there's a real reality that invites god's presence when we actually honor one another and this is where paul says preferring one another you know to think of it in this regards you know of how that god himself would would just be invited to this in the message time tested memorials of god brother brahma say it like this he says the things that you do the words that you say how you treat your neighbor and what you do about christ will be an everlasting memorial you might have a fine home to leave your children you might be working for some livelihood to leave to your children but i'd rather leave them the word of god than anything else those houses will vanish he said that's perfectly all right that's good i have nothing against it but don't do those minor things and leave the great things undone because the word he said or the house will perish and the people will perish with it but the word of god will raise them up in the last days and will give them eternal and immortal life again and that's what god has called us to be is living memorials we could give a lot of things to people but that in itself if we fail that the word of god is what's established in their hearts and minds that because the bible says that teach a child when it's young in the way that it should go and when it's old it will not depart so there must be a standard and sometimes as a parent you can look and say i want to see that standard of the living god inside of that child but remember a standard itself is that to be of a display of that word that image that's on display in our lives that it would be such a living effectual life and a standard that then with no matter what comes or goes there is a living reality that or their heart is always drawn back to to know that there is a god who is alive and well a god who liberates a god who sets free a god who produces a godly life a holy life a god that is alive and well who still feels with the holy ghost to steal heals the sick we are called to be the standard bearers in this hour that god is alive and well we can't do it with a doctrine we can't do it with theology we can't even do it with quotes and scriptures alone it takes the quickening power of god to raise the standard of god above the children of god that's an everlasting eternal and a man a memorial that will stand out before in their lives uh when we look at this here you think of in first timothy 3 14 and i want to just move with this here tonight in first timothy 3 14 the bible says these things right unto right eye unto you hoping to come unto thee shortly but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou art us to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth now paul is not talking about this building that we have designated and dedicated and called the house of god though this has been designated though there is ways that in here that god has spoke to us of even of how that were to conduct our lives and many of you probably don't realize it but even when i was in jeffersonville there last year different ones would speak they spoke to me of how that there were things that even brother branham himself was picking up on i'm talking about in the earlier ministry and there were things that were corrected in the house of god that you and i can read about and hear about in church order that brother random himself actually had to put in place in the tabernacle see god dealt with the prophet's heart to put it in order that there wouldn't be talking in the sanctuary wouldn't be running around wouldn't be carrying on but this is a place that we reverence i understand it's two by fours or brick or drywall and seats and pews but we reverence this place because this has been reserved as a place for god to come down and to meet with his children to deliver the captives to set them free to heal the sick to feel with the holy ghost this is a place that's designated for god to come and meet with his children and this is why that everything is set the way that it is but paul is not speaking of the building that's made out of bricks and you know drywall and things of this but let me read it again that thou mayest know how thou ought us to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and the ground of truth when i read this i hear brother branham many times as it goes through my mind when i can hear brother branham in the opening of the seals hearing almost every message after the opening of the seals you'll even hear him in earlier messages lord please come lord and teach us lord god revealing your will that we might know how to behave or conduct ourselves in this last days so when we look at this we know it takes a living god because just eagle teaching alone won't do it we need more than just eagle teaching we need the great eagle himself to show up that's what we need the great eagle himself is the one to come and teach us by his manifested presence in our midst and in our lives and without controversy notice great is the mystery of godliness this word godliness here it is that which is of a reverence a respect a piety towards god and godliness so let me read this again and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness this means being filled with god that's what the real mystery of godliness is it's to be filled with god's spirit god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world and received up into glory so this church that paul is writing about which is the house of golf the church of the living god the pillar in the ground of truth he's talking about the body of believers that has not only been purchased by the blood redeemed but now are divinely placed in the body of jesus christ which is the word of god which is the tabernacle of god which is the bride of jesus christ now i want you to look at this here in the scripture in revelations 3 12 him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god i love this in scripture we could just run with this all night god does not ask you or me to make ourselves because we cannot make ourselves but he if we can yield of ourselves to him he's the one that makes new creation he's the one that comes on the scene and he's the one that makes us from a bound man to a free man he's the one that makes us what we really are notice him will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go out go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from god and i will write upon him my new name lord have mercy which he now has been placed and made a temple in the pillar of my god god said my identification will be all over his life i will write my name all over his life matter of fact where he is dwelling will be reflected through his life glory be to god in the highest so this would take more than just a message book underneath an arm this takes the life of jesus christ on display notice now he is not only giving look how brother brown words this he's not only giving crowns but he says that these in the bride will be pillars in the temple of god but what is the temple of god jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of god but now that we are his body the church is the temple of god by the holy ghost within us so what sets us as the temple of god or the body of jesus christ is by the holy spirit dwelling within us so it's not what we say but it's god himself because of him divinely placing us in him and his life his name the characteristic of that new jerusalem which is his own life pulsating in the believer it is a divine witness that our life is under the influence of almighty god because our action is god our talking is god our thinking is god everything about our life it beats out jesus christ holy holy holy lord god almighty hallelujah but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of god by the holy ghost within us now he's going to make the overcomer a pillar in that temple but what's a pillar a pillar now a pillar in you know for kentucky it ain't what you have on your bed but what is a pillar a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for it holds up the superstructure oh my look what he said praise god that puts the overcomer right in with the apostles and prophets glory be to god amen right there in with the apostles and the prophets you're part of the superstructure we didn't receive a weak down gospel or watered down of it just barely got enough power to every once in a while bring you to the house of god you're missing it that is not what the holy ghost does the holy ghost just does not it's not a trickle of well you know i might be able to live a victorious life that's not what it does the holy ghost is the victory to the church of the living god it is the victory that reigns in the heart of the believer that sounds out he is the mighty conqueror he has put all things under his feet it is the victory that sounds out to the church of the living god that what god was back there he still the same god right here tonight and you are represented by being placed as a pillar in the super structure glory be to god oh my look what paul look out brother ram will go into this in ephesians 2 19 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord in whom ye are also build it together for inhabitation of god through the spirit now probably you know that when you go back and read about in solomon's temple there are pillars that solomon placed in that temple and there are two that are distinct that he names one he writes the name of boaz on one and writes the name of jason on another but that of jason means he will establish and that of boaz by his power so god establishes the believer as a pillar in the temple of the living god by his power glory be to god now notice he says we are building together with them everything went through the door jesus and is a part of that body or temple now when god puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him part of that foundation group what is he doing he is giving him the revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostles and prophets had and he goes into that in matthew 16. look at him look what he says here there he is in that word talking about you and me there he stands and no one can get him out there ain't enough youtube videos there ain't enough devils there ain't enough demons there ain't enough tests they're in enough trials you've been sealed in there you're a pillar in the temple of almighty god when you're going through a test the name of jesus christ is on display in your life when you're going through situations and in everything there is a display that i am just a pilgrim and a stranger here in this i am a citizen of another land of another country not only do i got the passport but i got my visa i've received the token that the deed has been cleared i've got all my shots my vaccines i've been immunized against sin [Music] [Applause] glory glory i love that scripture him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out there's no more desire amen to go out the desire is to dwell in his presence hallelujah look one legion when legion was delivered look where you find him the next reading at jesus feet is that right he wanted to get in the boat with jesus but jesus said no you stay here and i want you to go publish go preach tell your friends what the mercy of god has done for your life hallelujah who man who was once held in the tombs and out in there and bound with devils but now became a walking display and billboard of the power of god to announce that there is one person here on earth according to the promises that he made there's a god on earth that can take care of your situation a god on earth who's bigger than every devil in every demon so here in the scripture paul goes on to say that we are god's building many places that paul would would write of this under inspiration because remember when jesus would say upon this rock i'll build my church which is the revelation of himself to the individual amen that revelation of himself to the individual that's the new birth that's the quickening power that comes upon that life to really change them and transform them then you can say from your heart that indeed jesus is lord amen he become the lord of our life and here we are dwelling in the very tabernacle of god in the temple of god we are part of the body of god and so with that in that body the same way that he did in his earthly body it's the same way that he does in his earthly body now for he said that the works that i do shall you do also so the same life that he lived he now comes and lives through a mini-membered body hallelujah and as we've looked at that god wasn't trying to get in our flesh he wasn't even trying to get in our spirit and a matter of fact he didn't even want to marry our old nature he wanted to kill it so he could raise up that virgin womb on the inside that which was dead that is the body that god has prepared for me that which god himself has laid out in this earth just like when you dropped from your mother's womb that seed was already in you there ain't nobody put that seed in you god put that seed in you that's why the prophet could say it's that it was that g that found you hallelujah that's where we take it off the works of man and it comes back to the sovereignty of almighty god it was not us seeking after god it was god seeking after you and me god did not need anybody to provide himself a house but god has provided a house for himself he gave a vision to moses and moses built the house according to the divine pattern and what happened the pillar of fire came let me tell you something when the pattern of the word is preached with the power of the holy ghost it will draw the seed gene of god into a position that the pillar of fire will come right down and dwell in the light and take that life that was groping in darkness and place them in the shekinah life as a pillar in the temple of my god [Applause] glory be to god in the highest amen that's whose house we are we're made to be inhabited by god you are the church of the living god hallelujah brother braham said it like this and why christ speak there's there is only only one real church and you don't join it you're born in it and if you're born in it the living god works himself through you making himself known that's where god dwells in his church oh my i like this god goes to church every day he don't go to church some days and stream other days streaming ain't an option with jesus come on now that's an old roman catholic spirit that wants to creep around the message i'm going to preach it that's a roman catholic spirit my wife and i were going one to one saturday night and we went over we were had to go out i had to go get something around in avon or whatever more and we come down that one roadway i don't know if it might be 254 and there was one of them great big spooky morgues on the corner right there i might be on the corner nagel road or however you pronounce it and i looked and man here was saturday night my wife said why in the world is all those cars parked around that church i said that's called convenience religion it's convenient for them to go on saturday night because they're too busy for sunday come on friends when you're too busy to get in the house of god you're too busy i'm going to preach god goes to church every day and you know what he carries those with him to church oh god goes to church every day he just lives in church now that's how brother bran's place in this he lives in you you're his church you are his church you are the tabernacle that god dwells in you are the church of the living god yourself now i know there's no doubt there's people that can take it and run off anyway but you see the scripture will always right here the forsaken not to assemble ourselves together and i'm sorry i don't believe in computer chairs or a way to assemble together i'm just going to preach it that's not an option god is gone all of a sudden the rapture itself is going to be a gathering together that's what's taking place right now there's got to be efforts that's put in to be to the house of god when you don't feel like coming to the house of god that's the very time to come to the house of god you don't know what kind of trouble i'm in that ought to make you say i need to get there more than anything else because my help cometh from the lord oh glory be to god well that was free and if the living god lives in his living being then your action is of god if it isn't then god isn't there he wouldn't make you act like that when he says in his word here his blueprint don't do that you go do it see that's wrong when you deny it then that shows that the life isn't even in you so the life of the holy spirit it brings an action in our life it becomes the pulsation it is the will in the middle of the wheel it's what moves us forward that's why when god told us in the book of ezekiel a couple places and speaking of that of the real birth he said he would give us a new spirit thank god for that new spirit he'd give us a new heart thank god for that that's all necessary preparation that he said then i will give them my spirit and i will cause them to keep my way that ain't god driving us but now comes a change on the inside of our life where our desires are changed this you see the battle itself is not out here if the battle is down here once that battle right there once it is announced in your heart that the victory is over the battle's been won you recognize i was included in that victory on calvary and now that victory it reigns in your life and now you reign as an overcomer through that power on the inside of your life glory be to god sure there's temptations but greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world this is why when we look at here our lives and how we are living and walking and and and dwelling in jesus christ dwelling in the word the bible tells us that when the comforter has come this is what he would do in verse 8 he will reprove that means to bring conviction he's the one that brings conviction he reproves the world of sin of righteousness and a judgment and you see it's a conviction on the inside of us it's a holy spirit that brings conviction there's there's a there's a change that comes about in a believer's life when he has come there's convictions that you're walking by that your life is is a pleasing unto the lord look how the scripture says it in philippians 3 20 for our conversation this deals with our our constitution that we live by that which is is what what directs our life for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the savior the lord jesus christ who shall change our vile body that it might be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself he's working even now in our lives to subdue all things unto himself amen our life has been you see there's no way that we could match up with that character of life there was nobody on earth that could match that character of life the earth was combed even underneath the earth it was looked for who is able to take the book who's able what character can be produced and there was found no character but here came the lamb himself there's no other character that could be produced but other than god's character it was god's character of his life that would come to you and i and would bring a transformation in our life not by unwillingness but by him drawing us into a place of complete surrender is that right and the same god that brought a change in our life whereby that we are living by the word we're not living by the word of the church we're living by the word of god let me tell you something this message is not an earthly message this message itself is that sounding of the third angel flying through the heavens come out of babylon and as that was sounding out the bible said i heard a voice from heaven saying come out of here and brother ram tells us he said what it is is that angel that was sounding on earth was so inclined with god if heaven roared back the same thing let me announce to you we are inclined with god to speak in this hour we are inclined with god in this hour there is not a voice of a man that's backing us up it's the voice of god in our lives heaven is backing up the word [Applause] hallelujah and that same reality that brought a transformation and a change in our life it's going to change these mortal bodies [Music] the picture is being developed oh it'll be better than anything polaroid could ever do anything better than anything iphone or ever do it'll be the i am bringing us to him oh glory be to god notice paul would write in colossians 3 15 and let the peace of god rule let him be the umpire well you know when we're in a whether a baseball game or whatever you're in some some type of a sport or whatever more there is somebody there it ain't like backyard where you make your own little rules up and when we got south of rain rules and we got west over here and south amherst rules and no no when you play the game you're going to play according to the rules are you with me so when we look at this the peace of god let the peace of god be the umpire be the ultimate be the absolute in your hearts you see it's just like this when it comes let it be the peace of god that stands there as the umpire to say out right or the peace of god that can stand there and say go forward let it be the peace of god that rules in here to the which you're also called in one body and be you thankful let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom this word dwell means to dwell in one and influence him for the good i'll just say it to you like this i believe that a life can live so close to god that the devil don't know what to do let me tell you i believe that we can live so close to god that the spirit of god is not greed are you hearing me i believe that you say well how can that be possible by the life by the power of the holy ghost that we are established in the tabernacle of the living god that i believe with all my heart that living in the presence of god that it don't mean that things won't want to try to stick but i believe that there is rich honey that flows down to the great pyramid of god i believe that that the love of god it can be so thick and our hearts can be so bound in the love of god i believe that this is a reality of a living experience with jesus christ you know how we get pricky sometimes you know how we get our feelings and everything been out of shape because we're not living in the presence of god the way that we ought to it isn't because well brother samuel you don't know someone saw offending me so-and-so did this so and so did that but let me tell you something there is power in the life of almighty god if we will stay in his presence and staying in there and feasting it and laying before him there's a strength in there brother that we don't have to be sprayed with insect repellent or repel this or tell that we don't have to be sprayed with that you've got to spray of eternal life that's passing through that seed gene if you just let god have the right away i don't believe these are stories when brother ran would let us in on his private life and people would go to run him down and run down his family and brother bran would say let him alone he said god predestinated that and brother then bro you know and here the brother said how in the world can you stand and take it like that oh my teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him it's pretty simple amen if you can't do it in his name don't do it if you can't do it if you can't if you can't speak it and speak it in his name then don't do it hallelujah now let me just i'm going to move i'm just going to skip over a part here and i want to just say it like this here true honor because we're not talking about the false honor we're not talking about well if you know you like me i like you that's that's nonsense that's a false harmony this is what the pharisees were doing they wanted to scratch one another's back they were honoring one another so we're talking about a true honor and a true honor itself is what honors the lord in all things we can honor god even in the midst of a time in a situation where we've been dishonest that's a real test because you say well how can i honor god when i've been dishonored because god has given in his word the direction and listen god's desire by his spirit is that our life would remain open and pleasing unto him hallelujah think of this true honor begets true honor respect begets respect love begets love patience will beget patience now brother brown would take this and is your life worthy the gospel temper breeds temper and love brings love and brother brown also gives the member who he addresses the one sister that now through her whole house and nervousness is through the whole house among the family brother said see what it is he said keep your thoughts on christ because he said one thinking like that it can just it could just move you see because thoughts themselves just aren't well that's just a thought it's a spirit it's a spirit that's wanting to encroach or a spirit that maybe something would be suggested to you and then it would want to try to bring fear in your life or to bring uncertainty what do i do stand there and the good man of faith that's on the inside says and don't accept what you are saying because you're a liar lord be to god patience begets patience so then on the contrary side rudeness would beget rudeness on and on it goes is that right you see when the bible says that god gives the holy ghost to them that obey him it shows when you honor god he'll honor you with his presence god honors those who honor his word hallelujah his word his word is the expression of himself and anything that's contrary his presence will pull back and as believers were were built to be sensitive to them want you to look how paul would write this here in the next just over a few moments paul said i exhort therefore that first of all first timothy 2 1 supplications prayers intercessions and giving of things be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty and notice how paul's bringing this down he's not saying and not admonishing that well we need to get wrapped up with what the latest thing that's going on but the purpose notice why are we praying about these things are you hearing me what's the purpose so that we might lead a quiet and peaceable life paul would say follow peace with all men is that right you see the holy spirit will not come with us where peace is not out he will not come in an atmosphere this is why the enemy have you ever watched how that satan will try to come at you even on a thursday he'll try to come at you even on a sunday are you with me you know why because he knows if he can get everything so tore up but what god has for you you can actually miss it so paul is saying paul is not instructing us neither did brother random instructors say i want you to pray that miracle will be turned around that's not what we're praying about we're praying that we might lead a quiet and peaceable life not that oh my that my bank account might be blessed that ain't what he's talking about this is talking about seek ye first that the gospel might have the right of way in our lives but while we're here that god would make a way that's why we're not to be entangled up why do that in all godliness and all honesty through prayer not through getting around and getting around and pow-wowing about it and getting around this and get look there's just as much nonsense on the right as there is on the left whether you say a man or not i'll keep preaching it there's as much nonsense on the right as there is the left there's stuff that's set there as traps to try to ensnare people's lives what should i do get your eyes set on where you're going forget about all of that you can't control it anyhow but through prayer god can give you grace to live a quiet and peaceable life you have a right to that amen well i'm not up there in congress to vote but i still believe in prayer amen amen hallelujah not prayer to turn it around are you hearing me that's not at all so this is where this scripture still remains in effect for this is good look what he says for this is good and acceptable to all who are on my facebook page no that's a braggart for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior now remember in his sight it's what he's looking down on the inside now when we say here but what's on the inside who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth i don't know you ain't seen some of the characters we were characters some of us were characters some riding their bikes and everything else and had all their leather things on and my goodness we were some of us were some real characters some of us were some message kid characters come on now but god his desire and listen to me it's god's desire as it says who will have all men to be saved will all men be saved no but god's desire that's right is that all would be he has no hands but our hands no feet but our feet and to come unto the knowledge of the truth for there is one god and one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time did you think of that if god had not become one of us then there would be no way that we could be brought into the household of god someone had to be the redeemer and that was god himself notice how paul would write this here in first timothy 6 1 let us many servants now in here in the church when paul is dealing with this i want to just look at this here a little bit just just just over the next few moments here notice how paul was dealing with this paul's got a setting of where there is servants and masters and and things and it isn't even the way that we even in our country would even think about it but even at times when i've went overseas and been in other places it's nothing for people to have someone in the house who takes care of all the groceries who takes care of all the cleaning who takes care of all those other things i know some of you are thinking let me get signed up with this but you see it's not that the viewpoint of it is not necessarily how we and ourselves would look at now watch what paul says first timothy 6 1 let as many servants as are under the yoke meaning that they are a servant count their own masters worthy of all honor now he's not talking about whether or not the master is a believer or not but he said let them count think deem worthy of all honor [Music] that the name of god notice this remember that the name of god that which is roped on the pillar of god that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed so let that be steamed and worthy of honor that the doctrine be not the name of god or the doctrine be not blasphemed or evil spoken and they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren can you imagine that sitting right in the same pew your master and here you are a servant sat right next to him and the spirit of god would come across and not addre and not address the master and say you turned them loose everybody okay tonight and they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit these things teach and exhort so this wasn't just things to say well you know we're just we're just in trust and there are many things that we do entrust the spirit of god because god himself remember he will teach a life in the way of holiness and the holy spirit itself it takes and makes a life teachable to where that the spirit of god is able to so move within a person's life that their character is now molded by the character of light that has come down into that seed on the inside it is molded to reflect the lord of glory these things teach and exhort if any man notice how paul would write this if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness he is proud knowing nothing doting about questions and stripes of words wherewith cometh envy strife railings and evil surmising sounds pretty peaceful don't it perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thy self so to miss a paul is dealing to miss the display of the true character of god's own life coming in to that life by the holy ghost and being placed in our lives to govern our lives to direct our lives then truly the real doctrine of godliness has been misplaced so the truth the truth itself you know a person can say well we've got the truth but the truth ain't a book well we got the truth the truth ain't the tape that's right the truth is the person of jesus christ he said i am the lay the truth and the light and he said that you shall know the son and the son shall make you free indeed not set you free but he comes to change you make a new creation out of you he makes you free by the birth of the holy ghost in your life you now are a new creation you have been made free from the law of sin and death is that right and now christ himself is the center of our lives paul would write in the book of titus exhort servants to be obedient unto their even unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again this word answering means don't speak against gain say contradict to oppose oneself decline to obey declare oneself against him refuse to have anything you do with him now you understand i can't go here tonight the scripture says many things as is fit in the lord are you with me the same man peter could say submit yourselves unto every ordinance a man is the same peter that stood here after the day of pentecost when they want to shut them down and he said we're going to obey god's word and not yours that takes a discernment of the holy ghost he was not dishonoring them he was honoring the word in every place when he said submit yourself to every ordinance he was honoring god's word is that right jesus said give unto caesar what belongs to caesar but give unto god what belongs to god is that right and he was honoring god when they said you got to shut the church down and peter said we're not listening to you we're going to listen to god i'll save that for another time but i just i had to want to put that in there as it comes to me this is something not answering again in other words when things are even asked of us or things that are done that there be not a gain saying or a contradicting you know how it is you all have been in places where your boss or your principal or whoever it is me personally friends look has there been times that when i worked that there were things decisions i disagreed with you better believe it were there things that i looked at and said i think this could have been done a better way yes but here's the part of it there's a part probably that i don't see and if even if that is that or a decision is being made and they're having to make this decision or whatever more what good does it do to get my spirit all tore up there are people when i talked that i would purposely some of y'all know this i would keep like a stack of folders that absolutely had nothing to do with nothing they had papers in them and everything else and when i saw some of them people that all they wanted to do was gather around in the room and run down the principle or talk about this and how could the superintendent do this i don't got time for that nonsense i have a family i want to get home to it and i don't want to be packed full of junk of what you've got to say because listen to me critical spirits in the workplace if you don't stop from there they'll come home with you you'll be critical in your house it don't stop there it'll come right among brothers and sisters it keeps going but you're the one to say not here so brother brian what'd i do when i saw one of them i felt like boy you can hear them outside the room i just picked that up and i walked down what were you doing i act like i was getting ready to go copy papers why didn't you just tell them it didn't do no good i wanted to save a little bit of time because i had work that i needed to do in my room oh my you know how it is people boy i'm saying they can get on and my goodness but anyhow we're believers we're not out of this world now brother samuel where there was there must have been a time you never got caught up in that no there were some times that i sure did sometimes there's some things that i thought very this decision where in the world is this decision coming from but i can tell you one thing the holy spirit will bring conviction to your heart that's one thing i can tell you he convicts our lives is that right not purloined but showing all good fidelity that means a real character of one who can be trusted that they may adorn the doctrine of god our savior in all things so our conduct our behavior where people cannot see in or the place where we do in the temple of god in the body of jesus christ but the life that is lived it's an adornment what they see that's displayed on the outside tells what's on the inside and this is our desire is that the doctrine of our savior and lord jesus christ would be adorned on our life it would be that which they would see that because this is more you understand it's more than than teaching it's more this isn't about five steps this is where the spirit of god comes down and deals with our heart and these things are stirred up in our lives it changes us it causes us on the inside to prostrate ourselves and say be it unto me there are things that you could look at and maybe bypass and you wonder and you say god why why is this being brought to light right now but god said right now is the time to deal with it i'm telling you if he came all at once and wanted to mold our character all at once we'd be in bad shape but he molds us shapes us brother bram said with nail scarred amen can i have just one more moment ephesians six verse five i just want to wrap this part up paul would write of this here and and also in colossi in colossians 3 same thing with servants and masters but i want you to notice how he places this servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart what's those three words say as on to christ wow so i'm looking at my boss or i'm looking but it's with singleness of heart as unto christ not with i service as men pleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart so not just eye pleasers we're just trying to do just to fit in but it's where we do it from our heart as paul would say what you do do it harder as unto the lord i'd say it like this you know brother drake i'd say when you go to do them all that plumbing work that you do i would venture to say i i believe i could i could say this freely the way that you are in those homes that you're in and all that that you have to do down there it's a rough stuff but i say you do it and you do it like you do it if it was in your house to treat it as if it would be your place is that right yes you see this is something that if we notice how paul goes on with good will here's how we do it with goodwill doing service as to the lord and not the men i could ask for a show of hands and no doubt there's hands that go up and say you know what i've had to apply that i've had a boss or somebody's been mean as a rattlesnake they've done this and done that well i'll tell you what but did you do it as unto the lord you see god puts us in peculiar situations this life is not meant to be a cakewalk this life is not meant to be that boy i've got to have the right boss and i've got to have the ideal boss i've got to have this and i've got to have that boy what a boss that would be right we'd have we'd have a birthday cake every day but you see joseph from the scriptures in order for what god had in his life to come forth god had to place him in prison god had to place him under those who would have rulership over his life those that would tell him get up in the morning go to bed this is what you're eating why because according to the vision the dream he was going to rule so there had to be a character that was able to handle the authority that would be entrusted to his life sometimes the things that we're so interested in getting away from that's the flesh part of it but this part of it here is doing it as unto the lord god help me to have the right attitude tell me to look beyond the person or the individual help me to look lord notice how paul would go on to say this knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free let me just read the same point i want to leave you with this in colossians 3 24 if this is a paul speaking of the same thing what i just read to you knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance after our journey is completed because where we're headed in this hour if this ever was even a moment where we could say this is the time we are to not only receive the promise of all the other previous ages of the overcomers but in this age we are to set with him in history even as he is set down in his father's throne this is talking about a reigning and a ruling in the millennium are you with me it's where that all of where the old testament prophets and david would write of of that of that time of the rule of the son of david in the millennium it'll be a time her character has been so molded in this life to where the rapture will be the absolute transplanting of that life that's been molded and shaped through suffering through tests through trials and when we stand there on that day just here in that of the rapture well i tell you what we'll say lord it was worth it all when we sat there to marriage suffer the lamb lord thank you for grace for the tests and trials lord thank you for correction of how to look at things in the right way i'll tell you you talk about a joyous time we'll be thankful in that hour is that right knowing that of the lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the lord christ so your boss can say my goodness we're going to get you're the you're the top guy here you in your heart to know i've done it because god gave me this job i've done it as unto the lord i may have had skills but you gave them to me abilities you've given to me certificates you've given to me lord you've helped me you've led my path all along you provided for me you are jehovah jairo and lord jesus it's you lord god that i serve oh the boss and how that they can think my what a model employee what this and what that and everything else but you're not doing it as unto the boss you're doing it it's unto the lord it's just like when the boss and different things you know they can ask you and say hey why don't you come to the christmas party but as unto the lord you could say i don't go to those kinds of places but samuel did you do that i did i told them i don't go to those kinds of places sure it was places where they could eat and they would serve drinks but i knew that probably most of them was going to be sipping some drinks and there was already enough stuff to come out of their mouth i didn't want to be around them because there was stuff that i couldn't even set no in the the lunchroom with them and eat lunch with them i told my teachers i went my own room did my own work i for sure didn't want to be involved in one of their christmas parties and nothing against them all right are you with me but i can do as what is unto the lord of when the job says this i can do it at some point you with me think of this here i told you i was closing i am i've held you today i think a little bit longer than what i normally would do on a thursday night but think of this remember when that remember when that man that would come by and buy slaves he came by that ranch or that plantation remember he looked at this one slave he wanted to buy him from that broker and he asked that broker he said i want to buy that one no he's not for sale you can't buy him right that's a real life that's in the temple of god you can't buy them for nothing they can't be bought they've already been bought they've already been redeemed and placed in him you you can't buy them off they're not a cheap reproduction we're part of the original amen are you with me oh he he he's not for sale you can't buy him right brother brahms said all the rest of them what that man noticed is the rest of them were so weary it was a condition you and i could understand that you can understand they'd be weary think of how aware that they would live within their lives like there's nothing to live for there's no hope they've been separated from family separated from their native lands no doubt there's things that is so foreign to them their foods and everything else that's around them but them said even where they would have to whip up to get them to work so the weariness and then also the whipping them to get them to work but this man that they seen out here in the field brother bram says you didn't have to whip him he was just up and at it at all times they said well what you know the story but what do you do different see it's as though that there's a difference being made that's why he's acting a little bit maybe he's a teacher's pet that's why no he eats the same food the rest of them eat he lives in ladies they're where the rest of them live he works just like the rest of them works are you with me what is it that makes him act different he said i used to wonder that he said but i come to find out that he knows that his father is a king in the homeland and so he knows that he's the son of a king so because of that it makes him con conduct his life it makes him or direct his life and he said even he helps the morals of the others you talk about an influence there was an influence through his life because he knew who he was that power of knowing me was it influenced others around him it caused him it caused him to stand out when all the rest of them were there but this the conduct in his life is what brought the separation he wasn't trying to act odd he wasn't trying to be odd his conduct is what separated him from the rest of the side it made him act different that's the same thing that the holy ghost does to a son and daughter of god that makes us act different talk to you it brings conviction to our lives when we've been wrong whether even a thinking or a thought comes in their mind why would right away the conviction of the holy spirit says don't do that don't don't don't think that way why this right here comes back to what even brother andrew was preaching on friday night channels that are free and open satan wants to try to clog everything he can and he'll use any device that he thinks he can get but i say let's let's live free amen be a reflection of the real tabernacle of the living god let the holy spirit because it'll it'll take that right off in our life it'll make us act right it'll make us live when he has placed his life in us and we are placed in the temple of the living god we reflect his presence wherever we go holy holy holy unto the lord it doesn't matter where we go it's him that's on discipline dear lord jesus this is lord the very desire of each of our lives he's lord we want to be a real reflection of you i pray heavenly father that lord that you would just as you've come and spoke to our hearts tonight that would be the that would be the request of our lives we see lord god how that just through lord very simple things applying that word in our life you're god entering into prayer that for lord those of the kings and so forth that we might live a quiet and peaceable life not go and talk about it not get a church circle together about it not get a group of brothers together no no through prayer through prayer lord i know that lord throughout this building there might be some lord that's dealing dealing with some of these points lord as you brought out here tonight i pray that god whether they're dealing with it tonight or it's something lord that's down the road but may they just recognize lord they're just staying in your presence taking things before you in prayer really getting there in a place of prayer to where we're yielded in your presence to where that same fire that burns [Music] what got right there in the bosom of our soul that same light that should kind of light that cannot be put out to where lord god it just so influences we're so submitted and surrendered that lordy would influence our lives influence our behavior influence our thoughts influence our action lord we're not too big tonight to ask for that we want to humble ourselves in your presence for we know lord god of where we're headed lord through some of the things that you would permit to come our way it's part of the molding and the shape forgive us lord when we've complained about things we know that that's our flesh but we ain't making no excuses for it we as a son and daughter of god allowed it we ask that you'd forgive us help us lord i pray sometimes lord what we could look at it's the very display of christ in our life in situations that god would bring such a testimony that others know there's something greater inside of that life something more than just self-determination or self-will nothing could handle that kind of pressure and lord we would not be able to unless we ourselves were pressurized unless lord god we were established by your power in the temple of the living god [Music] lord jesus the few days that we tread here upon this earth i pray that god maybe some lord would never give us the time of day to witness to him but may lord god our lives be a living witness may it be that the word of the lord would sound out from our lives oh god [Music] help us lord give us the grace that we need give us strength lord father if there's one here tonight that were streaming or would archive this service that's not come to that place yet lord god may they recognize that that's your desire for them that they would come to that real perfect realization to know who they are lord god to have lord that reality lord that would burn in their hearts to where lord it's it's no longer them acting [Music] but it's you acting may they may they see that lord that that's your desire that lord what they do have a longing for you place that in there may they surrender lord to your voice may they honor you lord and say father i need you i need you lord dear god you always come where you're honored you're respected where hearts are always willing to obey your voice granted lord i pray lord you'll make a son and daughter of god out of their life help us father help us lord we give ourselves to you lord jesus in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen on earth [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] just to be [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] me [Music] once again [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
