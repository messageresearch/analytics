[34:58] that he's on time amen not always on
[35:02] what my time that I'm looking for him
[35:05] but he's on
[35:07] time amen and you know it's just uh so
[35:11] many times sometimes we are praying and
[35:13] we're looking to the Lord for things and
[35:15] and we we don't seem to have an answer
[35:18] right away but that's where patience God
[35:20] is molding and building patience in our
[35:23] lives and you know I what I'm thankful
[35:26] for
[35:27] it's very simple but just as God is
[35:30] moving and working in each of Our Lives
[35:33] I'm glad that he gives us Grace Amen to
[35:36] go through the tests and the trials it's
[35:39] like when brother Bram you know was was
[35:41] asking in uh the three kinds of
[35:44] Believers and he says Lord he said don't
[35:46] keep the tests and trials from me that's
[35:49] ordained for my life but just give me
[35:52] the grace am to go through
[35:55] them because God knows what we have need
[35:58] of and uh he knows his grace is there to
[36:03] bring us through all the way I remember
[36:06] one time brother brandham was he was
[36:07] praying and he was just saying Lord I
[36:10] just want to come on home I want to come
[36:11] on home and he says the spirit of the
[36:13] Lord just spoke back to him and says are
[36:15] you trying to
[36:16] dodge your
[36:19] trials but you know God is he's molding
[36:23] he's molding and he's shaping us here in
[36:25] this in this moment and I tell you truly
[36:29] standing over there it it the things
[36:32] that we deal with now do not compare
[36:34] with the glory that shall be revealed in
[36:36] US it doesn't compare and you know
[36:39] everything that God brings us through
[36:41] that he permits we come out stronger you
[36:44] know there's a great difference when we
[36:46] look at with trials and tests because
[36:48] trials and tests we understand are not
[36:51] correction it's things that God's
[36:53] working out to bring character in our
[36:55] life there's time times where things
[36:57] where God can use other means to bring
[36:59] correction on our life but no more than
[37:01] you or me you know you you don't correct
[37:04] your children in whatever manner you do
[37:05] you don't just correction is not just
[37:08] something where you just say go sit down
[37:10] there for what correction comes because
[37:13] there's been something that has been
[37:15] stepped over and that's the how God
[37:17] works with us so test and trials is not
[37:20] that of God coming to correct us is God
[37:23] coming to bring out of our Lives what's
[37:25] needed
[37:27] but how you know within the midst of it
[37:29] all we still come into that place don't
[37:31] we as Believers where brother Bram he
[37:33] shows us that principle in the scripture
[37:36] where we can look in the word and
[37:38] examine our hearts to be certain of God
[37:40] to be certain where we're standing and
[37:42] to know that if there's any there's
[37:44] nothing between us and God then we can
[37:46] stand we're standing firm on the promise
[37:48] and we're just looking to the Lord to
[37:51] come to fulfill his word and to bring us
[37:53] through so I just thank God for that and
[37:56] I I tell you I believe with all my heart
[37:57] in this hour uh this could you know
[38:00] stand here for some hours in time to
[38:03] speak on it but I believe that there's
[38:05] one one thing that we could we all
[38:08] benefit from and that is real real
[38:10] spiritual
[38:11] reflection in our lives and looking at
[38:14] the word of God and when we see in our
[38:17] lives areas that Lord I need I need to
[38:20] come up in this area of my life and you
[38:22] know we couldn't see it if unless God
[38:24] shows it to us friends unless God shows
[38:26] CL it to us we we don't see it uh
[38:29] sometimes you know you and that's where
[38:31] we need his grace to show us these
[38:33] things and I as my heart's desire is is
[38:36] God I want to I want to not only look
[38:38] into the mirror of your word and when I
[38:40] see I want to see where I'm short at I
[38:43] want to see where I'm short I want to
[38:45] see those areas that Lord I need I need
[38:48] to surrender that your strength can be
[38:50] poured into it I we want to walk in that
[38:53] kind of a way amen and I believe God in
[38:56] this hour he's provided for us truly a
[38:59] mirror um you know I think back as I say
[39:02] that now uh years ago brother Dan
[39:07] daisley He preached the service and he
[39:09] preached it throughout the world
[39:10] actually and it was he preached entitled
[39:12] it
[39:13] Cinderella and he was dealing with you
[39:15] remember s Cinderella mirror mirror on
[39:17] the wall and he talked about God has
[39:19] given us a real Mirror Has restored the
[39:21] mirror in this hour because there's been
[39:23] mirrors that have spoke and other things
[39:26] but they've not been true but God's
[39:28] given us a true mirror in this hour and
[39:30] there's a there's a True Fit to the word
[39:32] in our life amen so we just thank God
[39:36] for that just want to re remind you to
[39:39] keep remembering in prayer uh the
[39:41] different needs I know the requests that
[39:42] were mentioned here tonight and we just
[39:45] want to continue to hold one another up
[39:47] in prayer the Lord will just continue
[39:50] Amen to strengthen different ones I just
[39:52] had got that text earlier before coming
[39:55] from uh brother Mark regarding sister
[39:57] Doris there and so we want to continue
[39:59] with that also uh sister aah was there a
[40:02] request put in for that okay so we want
[40:05] to continue to remember how is she doing
[40:08] she's gone through two um radiation
[40:11] treatments okay just kind of Wai to see
[40:14] how the T looks okay so we want to just
[40:17] continue to remember Sister a in prayer
[40:19] the Lord will just continued just to
[40:21] move on her behalf that her body would
[40:23] also accept that treatment uh it's the
[40:25] same way with uh uh for sister Erica
[40:29] Parker and U you know she's on the same
[40:32] going under the same treatment that uh
[40:34] brother Ron Spencer is on as far as with
[40:37] that particular drug and that's where
[40:39] the doctors have directed in that moment
[40:42] and you see even in this right here God
[40:45] provided where that was going to cost
[40:47] them $40,000 a month just for that drug
[40:51] but God provided where the insurance
[40:53] said we're not going to cover this and
[40:55] things turned and the insurance is going
[40:57] to
[40:58] cover so you know God works and those
[41:01] are things that we just we take every
[41:03] little token and and here's the thing no
[41:05] matter how our healing comes it all
[41:08] comes from God whatever Avenue it comes
[41:11] through it comes from God and to God be
[41:14] the glory amen so let's just let's go to
[41:17] him in a word of prayer here tonight as

[43:46] and amen amen thank you
[43:49] musicians amen I want to just go here
[43:52] once again into the scriptures in job 23
[43:57] I just want to read a few vers of
[43:59] scripture here
[44:11] tonight and I want to if the Lord will
[44:14] help us I mentioned to you last week
[44:16] that I wanted to go into this thought on
[44:19] in his hands and I would want to I want
[44:22] to continue with that tonight and just
[44:24] take another part of it
[44:26] and just to speak on that here just for
[44:28] a few
[44:30] moments in verse
[44:32] 8 job said behold I go forward but he is
[44:36] not there and backward but I cannot
[44:40] perceive him on the left hand where he
[44:44] doth work but I cannot Behold Him He
[44:48] hideth himself on the right hand that I
[44:51] cannot see him but he knoweth the way
[44:55] that I take and when he hath tried me I
[44:59] shall come forth as goldall amen may God
[45:03] bless you and bless the reading of the
[45:05] word as you're being
[45:10] seated we look at how that job would
[45:13] Express this and job is aware
[45:18] that God is right there God is around he
[45:23] has heard from the Lord God is spoken to
[45:26] him he's got a revelation in his heart
[45:29] that he knows that he has met God and
[45:32] he's standing on the provided sacrifice
[45:35] of the Lord but job remember as the
[45:39] prophet would tell us the many of the
[45:40] things that were job what was troubling
[45:42] him is because job knew God by
[45:45] Revelation and what was taking place God
[45:48] had not spoke to him regarding this
[45:51] whole thing now however many days
[45:54] however many weeks it was I don't have
[45:57] that knowledge upon that but no matter
[45:59] what it is it was one to see things
[46:02] taking place and not to have an
[46:04] understanding on it you know how you and
[46:06] I feel sometimes when things are taking
[46:08] place around us and our minds can go 100
[46:12] miles in less than a minute we can cover
[46:14] all sorts of ground within it what if
[46:16] it's this what if it's this what if it's
[46:18] about this or what if it's about that
[46:20] and all of those parts are all part of
[46:22] that of how that we would think and
[46:25] consider in our life because for us and
[46:27] our lives as a Believer when God has
[46:30] touched your heart and your life there
[46:33] is a desire to please him and that's the
[46:36] very thing that moves you and moves us
[46:38] day by day and Moment by moment the
[46:41] prophet said as a matter of fact he said
[46:42] he describes it like the belt on the
[46:45] pulley of a car that you have to have
[46:47] those those that that belt going around
[46:50] and it puts that tension on those
[46:51] pulleys and that's what causes that car
[46:53] to go down the road and he said that's
[46:55] how it is for us as a Believer is that
[46:57] we have a tension in our life and that
[47:00] tension is always am I pleasing to the
[47:03] Lord that's and so brother Bram turns it
[47:05] around he says so see after all tension
[47:08] is a blessing he said think about if we
[47:10] didn't have this tension what we would
[47:12] be that's right so God moving in our
[47:15] life our desire is always to know and
[47:17] where we're standing that we're pleasing
[47:19] to the Lord and this thought and in his
[47:22] hands when the Lord just moving upon
[47:24] that and I begin to look at this and
[47:26] matter of fact this scripture here in
[47:28] verse 9 I've pondered and I you know
[47:30] I've been preaching out of job 23 here
[47:32] for quite some time now a few months and
[47:35] even out of this section but and I've
[47:36] looked at that on the left hand and
[47:38] looked down on the right hand but how
[47:40] God begin to just deal with my heart
[47:42] here a few weeks ago and going in there
[47:44] because as job would would would move
[47:46] and draw the attention to that and I
[47:49] want to just draw our attention not so
[47:51] much to the first part of the verse
[47:53] tonight I want to just really focus on
[47:55] the the right hand of God now we know
[47:57] that God is a spirit we know that God
[47:59] does not have hands like we have but
[48:02] there everything that we see within the
[48:04] scripture it's all even um symbolic and
[48:08] it's all it's uh it's figurative and how
[48:10] that even God would even relate and make
[48:13] himself known to you and I when it would
[48:15] say the stretched out arm of the Lord or
[48:17] the mighty hand of God it's showing
[48:19] God's personal dealing with Humanity in
[48:23] the Fulfillment of his word and God
[48:25] loves to fulfill his word God loves to
[48:27] make his word known and God just doesn't
[48:30] do it just to show off uh but God has a
[48:33] purpose there's a people that's ordained
[48:36] to catch when that manifestation is made
[48:39] known there's a people that's ordained
[48:42] much like the film in a camera that is
[48:44] made to catch when that light is
[48:46] impressed against it that's the same way
[48:49] in our life that though we could go for
[48:51] a many many times and and wondering and
[48:54] pondering our our our journey here upon
[48:57] Earth what am I here for what's my
[48:59] purpose and a lot of those things but
[49:01] God holding that purpose all and once
[49:03] that light comes across our pathway and
[49:06] you know you might be setting under the
[49:08] light but when you get into that right
[49:09] angle of it and finally that light
[49:11] strikes and then he becomes the
[49:14] satisfying portion and it just it drops
[49:16] so in your life that you realize this is
[49:19] why I'm here I'm here to serve the Lord
[49:22] all of these other parts of life they're
[49:24] they're okay but that's not my main
[49:26] that's not my main purpose whatever your
[49:29] occupation or anything you're here for
[49:31] that's not the main purpose there main
[49:33] purpose is to serve the Lord that's the
[49:36] beginning of all things is to fear the
[49:38] lord and to serve him and then he says
[49:40] all these other things will be added to
[49:43] us and so there is a a blessing that we
[49:46] can see here within the word where job
[49:49] and I want to draw from this because
[49:51] this this scripture here where what
[49:53] resonated so much in my heart when the
[49:55] Lord began to deal with my heart some
[49:57] weeks ago uh before the Labor Day
[50:00] weekend was that we find ourselves so
[50:02] many times as Believers and as Believers
[50:05] in the hands of God and that's where we
[50:07] want our lives to be we want we want to
[50:10] be surrendered vessels in the hands of
[50:12] God As a matter of fact brother B says
[50:14] you can't even be in God's hands until
[50:16] you're fully surrendered to him now my
[50:19] life your life no matter where I was
[50:21] even when I was out in the world my life
[50:23] was still in its hands Satan couldn't
[50:25] touch it because I was ordained to
[50:28] eternal life that didn't take away all
[50:31] the decisions and scars and baggage and
[50:33] everything else but God had an ordained
[50:36] plan of when God as he would draw he
[50:38] would deal with my life and bring me to
[50:41] himself and it would come to a place to
[50:43] where that I just like you had to come
[50:45] to a place of surrendering our life into
[50:48] the hands of God cuz God won't take our
[50:50] life but God wants us to surrender it
[50:53] God wants us to come to that place to
[50:55] real realiz I can't do this I can't do
[50:57] this on my own I can't make this happen
[51:00] is because every time that I keep going
[51:02] on it nothing makes sense but Lord in
[51:05] your hands You're The God Who satisfies
[51:08] You're The God Who takes where just like
[51:10] we looked at last week of Five Loaves
[51:13] two fishes You're The God Who takes and
[51:15] multiplies what little I have what can
[51:17] be placed in your hands and that's the
[51:19] thing with our life we want our life to
[51:22] be placed into the hands of almighty God
[51:25] so when we look at this this part of
[51:27] left hand and right hand it's all about
[51:29] our life and how that God deals with us
[51:32] and so I want to just move in which
[51:34] we're very accustomed to and have no
[51:36] doubt a lot of understanding and
[51:37] background we hear the right hand of god
[51:40] mentioned quite often we never hear too
[51:42] much even in the scriptures of where
[51:44] even a reference is mentioned of the
[51:46] left hand but job catches something here
[51:49] and it's important but I won't get to
[51:51] that tonight but I want to just Express
[51:53] when job says he hideth himself on the
[51:56] right hand that I cannot see him notice
[52:00] as it says he hideth himself what job is
[52:04] expressing is that he cannot see him
[52:06] which he's not visible in manifesting
[52:10] himself in his glory and his power for
[52:13] this moment yet job knows he is present
[52:17] but he's concealed as if it was one who
[52:19] is covered amen that's good and this is
[52:23] something that job is not seeing his
[52:26] glory he's not seeing
[52:28] manifestations and that's something even
[52:31] in that job is saying this is the right
[52:33] hand of God and I'm not seeing it the
[52:36] very word that we look here in the
[52:37] scripture to see it's the very word uh
[52:41] that that is mentioned first of all in
[52:43] Genesis 1:3 when it says God said let
[52:45] there be light and there was light and
[52:47] God saw the light that it was good and
[52:51] God divided the light from the darkness
[52:53] in Genesis 18 many places I could go
[52:56] with this but I want to just stay with
[52:57] this and the Lord appeared unto him that
[53:01] word appeared saw unto him in the plains
[53:03] of mamory and he sat in the tent Door In
[53:06] the Heat of the day and he lift up his
[53:09] eyes and looked and lo three men stood
[53:12] by him and when he saw them he ran to
[53:15] meet them from the tent door and bowed
[53:17] himself to the ground so this was not a
[53:20] vision that Abraham was seeing God had
[53:24] stepped from that realm into this realm
[53:27] The God Who was right there now became
[53:30] visible it was a visible undeniable
[53:33] manifestation he saw God just as when
[53:37] God said let there be light and brother
[53:39] BR says if there never had come forth
[53:41] light and until that light comes forth
[53:44] there could be questions but once the
[53:47] light is made manifest of what was
[53:50] spoken that removes all doubt amen and
[53:53] so that's where God God speaks his word
[53:56] but then it's in God's hands to bring
[53:59] his word to pass and when God brings his
[54:01] word to pass it will it's never by the
[54:04] Ingenuity or the strength of man we've
[54:07] seen that Moses tried to do it in his
[54:10] own strength he took a promise of God
[54:13] but he couldn't do it in his own
[54:14] strength Moses had to be an instrument
[54:17] in the hand of God there were many men
[54:20] that raised up before the days of the
[54:22] Lord Jesus and led people out there into
[54:24] the deserts with Promises of Messiah
[54:27] well was it men rising up under their
[54:30] own strength but when God comes to
[54:32] fulfill his word it's not the strength
[54:35] of man doing it it's the strength of
[54:38] almighty God that's why in this hour we
[54:42] needed not the strength of man man I I
[54:46] tell you wonderful where man will labor
[54:48] and and everything but when man relies
[54:51] on his strength he always is limited and
[54:54] he gets in trouble because our reasoning
[54:57] can only go so far it can only move so
[55:00] far that's why it must be the
[55:03] supernatural strength of the Living God
[55:06] it has to be God come because let me
[55:08] tell you as you and I as Believers to be
[55:11] a real believer you've got to meet the
[55:14] supernatural God you've got to know that
[55:17] this is not just a word or just a letter
[55:20] or something you've been talked into or
[55:22] it's just a reasoning or it's something
[55:25] that well that makes sense or this is
[55:27] the truth but you've got to know him
[55:29] you've got to know the person of Jesus
[55:32] Christ he is the truth the life and the
[55:34] way it is the very strength of almighty
[55:37] God because if we're talked into
[55:39] something you can be talked out of
[55:43] it that's why we need something greater
[55:46] that's why God when he deposits his word
[55:48] he doesn't deposit it in our
[55:51] spirit he goes to the deepest most place
[55:54] in our life the the
[55:55] soul that's God's dwelling place that's
[55:59] the Tabernacle of God that is the temple
[56:02] not made with hands that's where the
[56:04] word must be deposited because if it's
[56:07] just in our spirit there's no overcoming
[56:09] power there if it's just on our flesh
[56:12] which would move there with the spirit
[56:14] as well there's no strength no
[56:15] overcoming power but when there moves to
[56:18] the inside when he's taking his place
[56:21] and there has come a rest then there is
[56:23] a strength that moves through that
[56:26] life amen and there are witnesses here
[56:29] tonight of
[56:30] that so you're seeing this looking and
[56:33] and seeing it's it's visible where God
[56:37] makes himself visible and known right
[56:39] among us this is where that even Jacob
[56:42] could say in Genesis 48:3 Jacob said to
[56:46] Joseph this is when Jacob is preparing
[56:47] to pass God Almighty appeared unto me at
[56:51] l in the land of Canaan and blessed me
[56:54] that's where he rested wrestled with the
[56:55] angel of the Lord he appeared to me so
[56:58] it wasn't just a
[57:00] vision you see what God told Abraham
[57:03] when he walked to Genesis 22 and Abraham
[57:06] went up there in Journey what Abraham
[57:08] slew on the altar was not a vision
[57:11] Visions don't
[57:13] bleed are you with me it had moved from
[57:16] this it had moved and become visible it
[57:19] had become a manifestation what brought
[57:21] that forth not man but the right hand of
[57:26] God it's God fulfilling his word let me
[57:29] just say this to you we can't have the
[57:32] left hand without the right
[57:34] hand I I wish I could just preach and
[57:37] hold you here tonight but I don't want
[57:39] to hold you here you understand but to
[57:41] understand we want God that God is
[57:43] working in our life but God works by his
[57:45] power amen and so it must be that
[57:48] meeting with god notice in Exodus 14:13
[57:52] Moses said to the people fear you not
[57:54] stand still and see the salvation of the
[57:57] Lord which he will show to you today for
[58:01] the Egyptians whom you've seen today
[58:03] you'll see them again no more forever
[58:07] right so stand still and behold this so
[58:10] it isn't something that's obscure you
[58:12] actually see what has been tormenting
[58:15] you what's been after you stand still
[58:18] and see the salvation of the Lord and
[58:22] they turned and saw the Egyptian
[58:25] consumed it was not a figment of their
[58:27] imagination it was the power of God that
[58:30] moved down and consumed the Egyptians
[58:34] that were after
[58:36] themall the right hand of God that's
[58:39] right in Psalms 48 verse 8 it's David
[58:42] says as we have heard so have we seen in
[58:44] the city of the Lord of hosts in the
[58:46] city of our God God will establish it
[58:48] forever saah we have thought of thy
[58:51] loving kindness oh Lord in the midst of
[58:53] thy Temple according to thy name oh God
[58:57] so is thy praise unto the ends of the
[58:59] Earth thy right hand is full of
[59:04] righteousness verse Psalms 145:17 I want
[59:07] to just capitalize on that a moment the
[59:10] Lord is righteous in all his ways and
[59:14] holy in all his works hallah so remember
[59:18] God just don't show himself to put on a
[59:22] show that's right how many times you
[59:25] hear Brother BR I'm will bring it down
[59:27] in vernacular that we can understand God
[59:29] don't clown for
[59:31] nobody even when Satan came to the Lord
[59:34] Jesus and said if thou be the Son of God
[59:37] turn these turn these stones into bread
[59:41] he was in a moment of Temptation so he
[59:43] came to test him in a moment of weakness
[59:46] to see could he get him to surrender and
[59:49] use his power in the midst of a
[59:51] temptation but he stayed with the word
[59:55] why because God is not obligated to show
[59:58] off or to clown for anyone right this is
[1:00:02] why even when that man came to brother
[1:00:03] Bram and said you know when he was you
[1:00:05] know one of them that was doubting
[1:00:07] Divine Healing said here let me cut this
[1:00:09] little girl's arm and then you turn
[1:00:11] around and heal her and brother bandam
[1:00:12] just said it he was hitting some pretty
[1:00:14] nice words but that man was
[1:00:16] insane why would you say that let me
[1:00:19] destroy this little girl's arm and then
[1:00:21] you turn around and heal her it wouldn't
[1:00:23] matter do you understand it wouldn't
[1:00:25] matter even if that would have been done
[1:00:28] that man was not a
[1:00:30] Believer that's right friends there's
[1:00:33] sometimes where you God himself can
[1:00:35] stand right and before people and he is
[1:00:37] it's God in his
[1:00:39] people that's right amen and they don't
[1:00:42] recognize it amen God making his word
[1:00:45] known Healing The Sick delivering the
[1:00:47] captive filling with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:49] Discerning the hearts right where the
[1:00:51] words going forth and yet was sitting
[1:00:53] right there and look looking at it and
[1:00:55] not recognizing it it's not a man with
[1:00:58] hit and miss a man can't do that it's
[1:01:01] God doing
[1:01:02] that I don't ever come in here with the
[1:01:05] intention of let me see if I can just
[1:01:08] determine what's on brother Ray's heart
[1:01:09] or what's on so I don't have to do that
[1:01:12] if I just stay with what God has put on
[1:01:14] my heart and whatever track he wants to
[1:01:17] lead me on I am confident that God knows
[1:01:20] our need he is the chief Shepherd I am
[1:01:24] an UND sheeper Hallelujah just to follow
[1:01:28] him that's
[1:01:30] right God making promise known after
[1:01:33] promis known why does God do that to get
[1:01:35] the attention of his people
[1:01:38] amen I tell you what they're blessed
[1:01:41] people cuz there's many that can see the
[1:01:44] mighty miracles of God's hand and turn
[1:01:46] around and walk
[1:01:50] away lives that no doubt every one of us
[1:01:53] can give testimony of
[1:01:55] even I think over the years of different
[1:01:56] ones that have come oh I'll serve the
[1:01:58] Lord I'll do this I'll do that and God
[1:02:00] has moved in such a marvelous way and
[1:02:03] where they at right that's right where
[1:02:07] they at friends I'm not dting people I'm
[1:02:10] just trying to say who who but God could
[1:02:12] do that God showing his love and care
[1:02:14] you say why would God do that and God
[1:02:16] knew they were going to walk away that's
[1:02:18] because God loves Humanity that much
[1:02:20] that's right amen come on now you
[1:02:23] talking about the love of God I tell you
[1:02:25] we can't even scratch the service when
[1:02:27] we start looking at no wonder that the
[1:02:29] man that they found that wrote in that
[1:02:31] insane institution the love of God oh so
[1:02:35] rich and pure who can fathom it you
[1:02:38] can't we can't wrap our hands around it
[1:02:40] I'm glad I'm glad about that because
[1:02:43] it's wrapped you and I up it's got our
[1:02:46] soul our life wrapped up I can't figure
[1:02:49] it out I can't understand it but I'm
[1:02:53] overwhelmed
[1:02:55] true the Lord God's ways his god making
[1:03:00] himself known by his right hand his
[1:03:03] power his majesty his glory it works in
[1:03:07] continuity with the Fulfillment of his
[1:03:10] word god comes among us to do what not
[1:03:13] just to heal us but he comes to
[1:03:15] encourage us that's why testimonies are
[1:03:18] important that's why when we're praying
[1:03:20] for different needs and we see God
[1:03:22] moving on the scene that's god making
[1:03:25] known his love and his care right here
[1:03:27] among
[1:03:28] us see and this is why let me just refer
[1:03:31] to this here which I know we're aware of
[1:03:35] it but brother Brandon refers to it like
[1:03:36] this what does right hand mean in the
[1:03:38] Hebrews chapter 1 he says not that God's
[1:03:41] got a right hand that somebody's setting
[1:03:43] on but a right hand means the power and
[1:03:45] authority and he's got the authority of
[1:03:47] everything in Heaven and Earth and all
[1:03:49] the heavens and earth is made by
[1:03:53] him now I want you to think of what God
[1:03:55] had told you know even what the promise
[1:03:58] he had made to Abraham about bringing
[1:04:01] the Israel the children of Israel out of
[1:04:04] Egypt I want you to notice in Exodus
[1:04:07] 3:20 God told Moses he said and I will
[1:04:11] stretch out my hand as he said the verse
[1:04:15] before this they will not be brought
[1:04:16] forth no not by a mighty hand you could
[1:04:18] have took what would have seemingly been
[1:04:19] the mightiest Army it could have never
[1:04:21] delivered Israel no that's right right
[1:04:23] that's right it couldn't have take the
[1:04:25] mightiest hand or whatever mightiest
[1:04:27] Nation we know e Egypt was the mightiest
[1:04:30] at that time but find out whatever's the
[1:04:32] next in line it couldn't do it no amen
[1:04:35] only God could why it's prophecy to be
[1:04:38] fulfilled and when God has made a
[1:04:41] promise are you hearing me tonight don't
[1:04:43] just let it be for this right here take
[1:04:44] it down for your loved ones take it down
[1:04:46] for your children take it down for your
[1:04:49] husband your wife whomever it is that
[1:04:51] you're looking at and saying they're all
[1:04:52] out here if God has made a a promise and
[1:04:54] he has he said believe and thy and thy
[1:04:57] household shall be saved and he said
[1:05:00] they and their offspring shall be there
[1:05:02] with them that's a promise that a man
[1:05:04] didn't make God made that promise so God
[1:05:07] made that promise then it's up to God to
[1:05:10] fulfill that promise and it'll be
[1:05:13] fulfilled by nothing less than the
[1:05:15] supernatural strength of almighty God
[1:05:18] manifesting his right hand of
[1:05:21] power Exodus 3:20 said and I will
[1:05:24] stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with
[1:05:26] all wonders which I will do in the midst
[1:05:29] thereof and after that he will let you
[1:05:31] go so God breaking down their will boy
[1:05:35] man these things will
[1:05:37] preach you see God manifesting himself
[1:05:40] what was God doing he was breaking down
[1:05:42] cuz Pharaoh kept saying Pharaoh would
[1:05:44] come Pharaoh oh he was on the edge of
[1:05:46] his seat you know and then all of a
[1:05:49] sudden another service would go by God
[1:05:51] comes back around another service what's
[1:05:53] God doing breaking down the will that's
[1:05:56] right that's what leads to the New Birth
[1:05:59] is where the old man dies that's right
[1:06:02] that's what God does that's what God
[1:06:03] moves service after service Time After
[1:06:06] Time what's he doing it by his
[1:06:08] outstretched hand hallelujah oh my now
[1:06:12] notice when Israel came in and Moses
[1:06:15] after what I read in Exodus 14 here
[1:06:18] Moses sings the song uh that that is
[1:06:21] sung in Victory and verse six say says
[1:06:24] of Exodus 15 thy right hand O Lord is
[1:06:28] become glorious in power thy right hand
[1:06:31] oh Lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy
[1:06:34] wo in verse 11 is lack unto thee Oh Lord
[1:06:38] who is lack unto thee Oh Lord among the
[1:06:40] gods who is like thee glorious in
[1:06:42] Holiness fearful in Praises doing
[1:06:45] wonders thou stretches out thy right
[1:06:48] hand and the Earth swallow them
[1:06:50] Hallelujah I'll tell you where I take
[1:06:52] comfort in this right here that the same
[1:06:54] Mighty hand that moved down in Egypt and
[1:06:57] revealed the way out was thre and by the
[1:07:00] lamb oh my when they were looking are
[1:07:03] you hearing me what they were looking
[1:07:04] for what is my ticket out of here I
[1:07:07] wonder how long they have been raising
[1:07:09] those sheep that lamb that they had been
[1:07:12] feeding there for that period of time
[1:07:14] little did they know the blood of that
[1:07:16] lamb it would come under the divine
[1:07:18] order by God's revelation and being
[1:07:21] applied it would become the loosening
[1:07:24] liberating power of the word of almighty
[1:07:27] God where a promise was made but now has
[1:07:30] become visible and glorious in power
[1:07:34] amen and not only did God lead him out
[1:07:36] into the
[1:07:38] Wilderness but God was with them all
[1:07:41] along when the Egyptians rose up and
[1:07:45] wanted to pursue after them brother br
[1:07:46] will take this in many different types
[1:07:48] he'll type the Red Sea of sanctification
[1:07:51] then he'll type it as the day of
[1:07:52] Pentecost then he'll type it a sickness
[1:07:54] coming after us as Believers it's always
[1:07:56] follow following in those places of
[1:07:58] where it's to be applied in our lives at
[1:08:00] that moment and we see that here all the
[1:08:03] way through the all the way through the
[1:08:04] Journey God steps on the scene to make
[1:08:07] himself known that his power did not
[1:08:10] begin and end in Egypt so good so I'm
[1:08:15] going to say this God's power in this
[1:08:17] message did not end or begin and end
[1:08:20] with brother Bram that's right it did
[1:08:22] not begin and end right in when Us
[1:08:25] coming out of Egypt he's right here
[1:08:28] Among
[1:08:29] Us it's the same Living God and it's not
[1:08:32] just for not just for ministers you have
[1:08:35] access as Believers you have access to
[1:08:38] the throne of God that's why the
[1:08:40] preaching of the word the preaching of
[1:08:42] the word is not for us to look up to a
[1:08:43] man the preaching of the word is all
[1:08:45] about lifting him up and that we can see
[1:08:48] if there's anything that's getting in
[1:08:50] our pathway that's hindering our daily
[1:08:53] walk walk with God the word is there to
[1:08:56] reveal it that's God's love so we're not
[1:08:58] looking at a man and lifting a man up
[1:09:01] we're seeing him being lifted up and
[1:09:03] we're looking at that channel to make
[1:09:05] sure and see that there's nothing
[1:09:07] between us and
[1:09:08] him oh how we need him that's Joshua
[1:09:12] 4:23 and here's Joshua the testimony
[1:09:15] before they're going over the Jordan
[1:09:17] notice this rehearsal before they're
[1:09:18] going over the J Jordan for the Lord
[1:09:21] your God dried up the Waters of the
[1:09:22] Jordan from before until you were passed
[1:09:24] over as the Lord your God did to the Red
[1:09:27] Sea which he dried up before us until we
[1:09:29] were gone over that all the people of
[1:09:31] the earth might know the hand of the
[1:09:34] Lord that it is mighty that ye might
[1:09:38] fear the lord your God forever so God
[1:09:41] did it his mighty
[1:09:45] hand and of all the times in the world
[1:09:48] for God to pick going across
[1:09:50] Jordan it's the time when it's the
[1:09:55] worst it's flooded it's a time of Latter
[1:09:58] rain season it's a time when it's
[1:10:01] flooding but that was the very time that
[1:10:04] God declared it's time to go over amen
[1:10:07] and God Made A Way showing he the same
[1:10:09] God you see his characteristics are
[1:10:12] still the same and why did he do that he
[1:10:15] did it that the Earth might know the
[1:10:17] hand of the Lord that it's mighty did it
[1:10:19] help all the rest of the Nations no what
[1:10:22] was that when God made known his word
[1:10:25] that was a promise that God said I'll
[1:10:27] send the Hornet before you what would it
[1:10:30] be it would be the mighty acts of God
[1:10:33] being made manifest and when the people
[1:10:35] would recognize and see that it would be
[1:10:38] the angel of the Lord stinging against
[1:10:40] those individuals and what was it they
[1:10:42] would be in fear all the courage would
[1:10:44] be taken out of their heart but you
[1:10:46] would have people like Rahab that they
[1:10:48] would hear of the mighty hand of God and
[1:10:50] they would say if God can open the Red
[1:10:53] Sea the god that can open the Jordan
[1:10:55] surely God can make a way for me that I
[1:10:58] can walk in righteousness and Holiness
[1:11:00] and live and overcoming life my my my my
[1:11:05] what gave her that kind of an
[1:11:06] understanding there was something on the
[1:11:08] inside that could connect with the
[1:11:10] mighty hand of God hallelujah Psalm 168
[1:11:15] David said I have set the lord always
[1:11:17] before me I love this scripture yes my I
[1:11:20] love this scripture it no matter what
[1:11:23] your promise is right listen friends
[1:11:27] this scripture is one scripture that I
[1:11:28] rest in after every service after every
[1:11:31] meeting because no matter what it is who
[1:11:33] I've seen or we've not seen if you can
[1:11:36] let the Lord be always before you that
[1:11:38] after we leave out of here or whatever
[1:11:40] that it's not my ideas that's in the
[1:11:43] Forefront anymore not my thoughts but I
[1:11:45] have put the Lord before me amen I love
[1:11:48] this because he is at my right hand I
[1:11:51] shall not be moved so whatever promise
[1:11:54] that I am seeking for he's at my right
[1:11:57] hand he's the one strengthening me when
[1:11:59] I get discouraged he's at my right hand
[1:12:02] he's encouraging me the promise is you
[1:12:05] the promise is for you this is your
[1:12:07] promise he is at my right hand I shall
[1:12:10] not be
[1:12:11] moved yes sir amen
[1:12:14] therefore he's at my right hand oh my my
[1:12:17] my therefore my heart is glad and my
[1:12:19] glory rejoiceth My Flesh also shall Rest
[1:12:22] In Hope for thou Willl not leave my soul
[1:12:24] in Hell neither wil thou suffer thine
[1:12:27] Holy One to see corruption thou Wil show
[1:12:29] me the path of life in thy presence is
[1:12:32] fullness of joy and at thy right hand
[1:12:35] are Pleasures forever more aren't you
[1:12:39] thankful for that
[1:12:41] am at thy right hand are Pleasures
[1:12:43] forever
[1:12:45] more oh if every day could be a
[1:12:48] right-hand day that's right I won't get
[1:12:51] there tonight but oh if every day could
[1:12:52] be a right-hand day yes sir but needless
[1:12:55] to say the pleasures that are at the
[1:12:58] right hand and having access to it and
[1:13:01] you know not allowing the enemy to keep
[1:13:03] you back even when you come into service
[1:13:05] sometimes you feel labored and loaden
[1:13:07] with the cares of life and burdens and
[1:13:10] the things that you've uh throughout the
[1:13:12] week you've come face to face with some
[1:13:14] things that nearly about knock the wind
[1:13:16] out of your CS that you we're not
[1:13:18] expecting but yet as you come into the
[1:13:20] presence of God and God begins to
[1:13:22] strengthen you God begins to minister to
[1:13:24] you God begins to comfort you in that
[1:13:27] moment what is that those are Pleasures
[1:13:29] from the right hand Hallelujah every one
[1:13:31] of us can testify of walking into a
[1:13:34] service and and we're down we're
[1:13:37] discouraged maybe I'll just preach for
[1:13:39] the five that feel that way
[1:13:41] sometimes but it is something that is
[1:13:44] within us to know that I I'm I want to
[1:13:46] get to the house of God it's not just so
[1:13:49] much of being in these walls it's being
[1:13:51] in the presence of other belever
[1:13:53] Believers where the presence of God is
[1:13:55] moving you may not be in a downtime but
[1:13:58] somebody else might be but that's a time
[1:14:00] to say Lord flow through me I want to be
[1:14:04] one that's an encouragement that
[1:14:06] actually will allow the spirit of God to
[1:14:09] create an atmosphere to move for needs
[1:14:12] that are present here in the body that
[1:14:14] to me is a responsibility that I have
[1:14:17] you have of God I'm here to create an
[1:14:19] atmosphere I don't ever walk out of the
[1:14:21] service and say I did not get anything
[1:14:24] from God there are things that God will
[1:14:26] speak to me but let me just say this to
[1:14:28] you if there was one time that I could
[1:14:30] ever walk out of service and say I never
[1:14:33] received anything at all I don't know
[1:14:34] how that would be but there's one thing
[1:14:36] that I do want to be able to declare I
[1:14:39] am here to be an instrument and a part
[1:14:41] of the body I'm talking about if I'm
[1:14:43] setting right there is to be a channel
[1:14:46] to bring the spirit of God on the
[1:14:51] scene I told told you many times there's
[1:14:54] sometimes the reason I sat in certain
[1:14:55] places even when I've gone into certain
[1:14:57] meetings or certain times here I sat in
[1:14:59] certain places just for a certain reason
[1:15:01] you know sometimes you get behind people
[1:15:03] that can be quiet and everything else
[1:15:04] get behind them and you start pulling on
[1:15:06] the gift of God I know that the spirit
[1:15:08] of God it'll reach right back there
[1:15:09] there's a connection that's going
[1:15:13] on maybe give away the secrets but they
[1:15:16] don't
[1:15:17] matter I would to God we all think of
[1:15:19] that like that and I could just come
[1:15:21] right up here and sit down I love in
[1:15:23] front but there's times where
[1:15:25] strategically listen friends I've done
[1:15:27] it in many different meetings I look
[1:15:29] over the situation and then I'll go set
[1:15:31] accordingly and just start come on man
[1:15:33] of God preaching man of God getting
[1:15:35] right in there why creating an
[1:15:37] atmosphere I'm not looking down on
[1:15:40] people we're here to be
[1:15:42] helped if there's anybody that can help
[1:15:45] us it's Jesus and that's the only
[1:15:48] one oh my so he is at my right hand
[1:15:52] that's why even when the the the symbol
[1:15:54] of how when the blood would be applied
[1:15:56] when Moses would take of the heer and of
[1:15:59] the sacrifice he would apply it on the
[1:16:00] right thumb he would apply on the right
[1:16:02] toe right ear all of that was the
[1:16:04] signifying through the strength and
[1:16:07] Authority I do not want to go Upon My
[1:16:09] Own Strength I want my strength to be
[1:16:12] under the governance of the Holy Spirit
[1:16:14] to where we're yielded to him that God
[1:16:16] can use our strength anytime he desires
[1:16:21] to now think about this in Psalms 44 now
[1:16:25] notice the Bible said Lord oh in verse
[1:16:28] one oh God our fathers have told us what
[1:16:30] work thou didst in their days in the
[1:16:32] times of old how thou didst drive out
[1:16:35] the Heathen With Thine hand and plest
[1:16:39] them now when I read my
[1:16:43] Bible I read where they had
[1:16:46] battles I read where Joshua didn't know
[1:16:49] how to approach Jericho but he knew this
[1:16:52] is what God Said said this has got to
[1:16:54] come down first so Joshua went out to
[1:16:57] meditate and to pray and Joshua went out
[1:17:02] God met him right Joshua asked now
[1:17:06] listen it wasn't a vision he met him
[1:17:09] Joshua drew his sword amen are you for
[1:17:12] us or are you against us yes right God
[1:17:16] makes himself known in that moment and
[1:17:20] God equips Israel with his word
[1:17:23] and you know how everything comes about
[1:17:25] with Jericho I don't have time to
[1:17:27] elaborate on that but then even as every
[1:17:29] city and each of those things when that
[1:17:31] whole Conquest notice it was God moving
[1:17:34] through the surrendered hearts of the
[1:17:37] people so all it is attributed is that
[1:17:41] thy hand Lord It's thy hand that drive
[1:17:43] out the the the Heathen and plant us
[1:17:46] them how did how how thou didst afflict
[1:17:49] the people and cast them out for they
[1:17:51] got not the land in possession
[1:17:53] possession by their own sword neither
[1:17:55] did their own arm save them and yet if
[1:17:58] you would look at them you could say hey
[1:18:00] that's your sword you're swinging but
[1:18:02] they're not swinging their sword
[1:18:04] underneath their own leadership their
[1:18:07] sword is yielded to the Lord oh my
[1:18:10] that's how we want to live our lives we
[1:18:12] want our lives to be surrendered to the
[1:18:15] power of almighty God we do not want our
[1:18:18] lives where we are swinging by our own
[1:18:20] power we'll never get anywhere that's
[1:18:22] right you'll never get one inch of land
[1:18:24] whatsoever but notice the promise
[1:18:27] neither did their own arms save them but
[1:18:29] thy right hand and thine arm and the
[1:18:31] light of thy countenance because thou
[1:18:34] had us a favor unto them now here's
[1:18:36] another thing to think about the right
[1:18:38] hand of God can anybody make the right
[1:18:40] hand come on
[1:18:42] display no you can't just make it come
[1:18:45] on display well I tell you what we're
[1:18:47] going to have a display of the right
[1:18:48] hand of God
[1:18:50] tonight he's faithful to his word I
[1:18:53] believe whatever need we have but you
[1:18:56] see God's not at our
[1:18:58] Command it's not it's not us commanding
[1:19:00] and US Desiring us doing this and us
[1:19:03] doing that you understand what I'm
[1:19:04] saying neither is it when it comes to
[1:19:07] things that are to be moved and dealt
[1:19:10] with in our life families and situations
[1:19:13] we cannot command the right hand of
[1:19:16] God remember brother Bram said he was
[1:19:18] listening to a man praying one time and
[1:19:19] says God I say to you heal this person
[1:19:24] you don't tell God what to
[1:19:25] do you don't tell God what to do he's
[1:19:28] not our servant we're to be his
[1:19:31] servants he he's not he's not our mascot
[1:19:33] boy that things we just want this done
[1:19:36] this is uncomfortable I want this done I
[1:19:37] want this change I want this change you
[1:19:39] know sometimes the situations and we all
[1:19:41] have been guilty within our Humanity
[1:19:43] that we want change we want it changeed
[1:19:45] cuz it's rubbing us the wrong way and
[1:19:47] it's not because the situation don't
[1:19:49] need to be changed but you know why God
[1:19:51] allows it to even Linger on on is to get
[1:19:53] rubbed out what needs to get rubbed out
[1:19:55] inside of us we're looking at the other
[1:19:58] person once they become sweet powdered
[1:20:00] sugar Everything Will Change with me
[1:20:02] that ain't how it works God works to
[1:20:04] change us well brother Samuel why is
[1:20:06] this lingering you might want to ask and
[1:20:07] say Lord if this is lingering in this
[1:20:10] way maybe there needs to be some
[1:20:12] sweetness coming my way I need to have a
[1:20:14] little bit more of the love of God I
[1:20:16] need a refilling I need a fresh trip to
[1:20:20] Calvary to remember that one love me who
[1:20:24] was the
[1:20:27] unlovable my my my so the right hand of
[1:20:29] God we can't force it what we're seeing
[1:20:31] here is the right hand of God works in
[1:20:34] Harmony and coordination with his word
[1:20:36] and the plan of God the program of God
[1:20:40] is that right so we find that the hand
[1:20:44] of the Lord I think of this in this
[1:20:46] measure you remember that as it was when
[1:20:49] there was the the drought that was there
[1:20:51] in the land of is Israel and Elijah had
[1:20:54] called for that there will not be Doom
[1:20:55] nor rain fall until I call for it and
[1:20:58] when it came time for that the the
[1:21:01] season of that to end remember Elijah
[1:21:05] sent Gesa up to the mountain and he said
[1:21:08] I want you to go to the top of this
[1:21:09] mountain and look over the sea he went
[1:21:13] it was seven times he kept coming back
[1:21:15] to Elijah and said I don't see nothing
[1:21:18] Elijah said go again came back I don't
[1:21:21] see nothing go again I don't see
[1:21:25] nothing well it could teach a lot
[1:21:27] there but finally Gesa came down and
[1:21:31] Gesa said I see a cloud like a man's
[1:21:35] hand that's rising up out of the sea
[1:21:38] Hallelujah and when he said that the
[1:21:41] Bible and a Elijah sent him to tell Ahab
[1:21:46] get down to jezrael so your chariot
[1:21:49] don't get stuck here cuz the rain is
[1:21:52] coming
[1:21:53] jezrael is 20 mil away and once he
[1:21:55] announces it the hand of the Lord comes
[1:21:59] upon him and he runs ahead of Ahab and
[1:22:03] meets him at the entrance of jezrael yes
[1:22:07] sir Hallelujah you say what was it that
[1:22:10] gave Elijah the strength to run like
[1:22:12] that you might look at that and say man
[1:22:14] I ain't seen nothing like that except
[1:22:16] it's on cartoons no we ain't talking
[1:22:18] about cartoons we're talking about a
[1:22:21] living almighty God that was a type for
[1:22:24] you and I that the prophet said when you
[1:22:26] see the hand of the Lord j s u s and
[1:22:30] Faith Rises he said when God makes it
[1:22:33] known in your heart you're healed I'm
[1:22:35] the Lord that Health it when it begins
[1:22:37] to pulsate in your life this is the
[1:22:39] truth he said run towards the holy ghost
[1:22:42] at that moment take off running
[1:22:47] sir it's
[1:22:49] certain Elijah all you saw is the is a a
[1:22:53] cloud oh
[1:22:55] Lord like the size of a man's hand
[1:22:58] that's all you saw but he said it's
[1:23:01] certain I done so the
[1:23:05] victory oh my I got to just stay right
[1:23:08] here I could we could go down trails and
[1:23:10] preach but I got to stay right
[1:23:13] here the hand of almighty God I'm
[1:23:16] thankful tonight for the God's hand I'm
[1:23:19] thankful like Jacob when he rest with
[1:23:22] the angel he was touched by the hand of
[1:23:26] the
[1:23:28] Angel he got
[1:23:30] touched he came out walking
[1:23:33] different Jacob was no longer Jacob
[1:23:37] right right but that hidden part mystery
[1:23:40] on the inside that was all sealed up
[1:23:43] having the name m having the name Israel
[1:23:45] but when the seal would be broken then
[1:23:47] the name could be called and he touched
[1:23:50] him there and the Bible said he blessed
[1:23:52] asked him there where did he bless him
[1:23:54] at down on the
[1:23:56] inside and Jacob left out of there with
[1:23:59] a different
[1:24:00] walk he came out of there different he
[1:24:04] was a changed man and the god that began
[1:24:07] the change there brought a change in his
[1:24:09] life it continued to change everything
[1:24:10] in Jacob's life is that right just like
[1:24:13] for you and I that that that one initial
[1:24:15] change in our life by the Holy Ghost
[1:24:17] what does it do it sets everything in
[1:24:19] change it's just like then it just
[1:24:21] starts everything like one domino
[1:24:23] falling over all the rest of them are
[1:24:24] gonna come amen oh my think about it of
[1:24:29] how that God had moved back the Red Sea
[1:24:32] I want you to think about this the
[1:24:33] Mighty God that moved back the Red Sea
[1:24:36] by his right hand his glorious
[1:24:39] power would Veil
[1:24:42] himself in this hour that we're living
[1:24:45] in and declare the promise behold I
[1:24:49] stand at the
[1:24:50] door right and knock the same hand that
[1:24:55] destroyed Pharaoh's Army that's good the
[1:24:58] same hand that's so that brought him out
[1:25:00] of Egypt the same hand has come and
[1:25:04] knocked on your heart's
[1:25:06] door the same hand wow has moved down in
[1:25:10] his glorious power to speak to woo to
[1:25:14] draw you and
[1:25:16] ijah what Grace it's a fulfillment you
[1:25:20] see what God is doing he's making on the
[1:25:22] Fulfillment of his word just just a few
[1:25:24] more moments here in Acts 2:32 I'm just
[1:25:27] going to skip a few scriptures but acts
[1:25:28] 232 I know we're familiar with it but
[1:25:31] here's Peter declaring this witness on
[1:25:34] the day of Pentecost after they've
[1:25:36] come into this place after coming out of
[1:25:40] the upper room and here he is giving
[1:25:42] witness of the word that has come to
[1:25:45] pass that not only is the true atonement
[1:25:48] here but it's been offered up amen now
[1:25:51] watch as he says this this this Jesus
[1:25:54] hath God raised up whereof we all are
[1:25:58] witnesses therefore being by the right
[1:26:01] hand of God exalted and having received
[1:26:04] of the Father the promise of the Holy
[1:26:06] Ghost he ha shed forth this which ye now
[1:26:12] see and
[1:26:15] hear you are W he is is declaring you
[1:26:18] are witnessing the right hand of God
[1:26:22] Hallelujah at work what God promised in
[1:26:25] his word I will not leave my soul in
[1:26:29] hell hallelu what God promised God has
[1:26:33] fulfilled that word God hath raised him
[1:26:36] up that same quickening power raised up
[1:26:39] that body Seated on the right hand now
[1:26:43] we understand it's not a right hand like
[1:26:44] this we understand that's that's a
[1:26:47] symbol it means Authority and power
[1:26:51] because when Jesus says in Matthew 28
[1:26:54] all power in Heaven and Earth is given
[1:26:56] unto me if God's the one that has all
[1:26:59] the power now Jesus does somebody lost
[1:27:01] power and somebody gained power you see
[1:27:04] what a mess trinitarianism is it is yes
[1:27:07] sir you see the whole the whole part of
[1:27:09] redemption is God coming down amen and
[1:27:13] becoming
[1:27:14] flesh because with the whole desire not
[1:27:17] only to shed his blood for you and I but
[1:27:20] that his own life that he now can impart
[1:27:24] his own life and move inside of you and
[1:27:27] I as Believers so that we then can stand
[1:27:32] as Sons and Daughters of God and think
[1:27:34] it not
[1:27:35] robbery
[1:27:37] Hallelujah that's great to be what the
[1:27:40] word says I am I am what the word says I
[1:27:44] am I
[1:27:45] [Applause]
[1:27:47] am
[1:27:48] amen this is the promise which you now
[1:27:51] see and he because remember this word
[1:27:54] was taking effect on their lives what
[1:27:56] you're seeing is is the manifestation of
[1:27:59] now where this word has been received
[1:28:02] every promise all the Redemptive
[1:28:03] blessings all that were laying down
[1:28:05] through the scriptures everything that
[1:28:06] had been promised all of these things
[1:28:08] that had even been shown down through
[1:28:10] the times now here comes the Fulfillment
[1:28:13] where God had stepped forward and became
[1:28:16] man God became one of us to pay the
[1:28:19] ultimate price of redemption and there
[1:28:23] notice that here he he ascends back up
[1:28:26] and that Corporal body is Seated on the
[1:28:28] throne of almighty God it's there for
[1:28:31] you and I to lay claim on every
[1:28:34] Redemptive blessing thank you Lord
[1:28:37] hallelujah you realize he opened up the
[1:28:39] way every wall that was we were veiled
[1:28:41] off we were shut off he opened up the
[1:28:44] way for you and I to come back into the
[1:28:46] holiest of holies he opened up the
[1:28:48] channel for you and I what did that the
[1:28:50] right hand of God that's right
[1:28:53] this is why that Steven in the midst of
[1:28:55] his trial brother BR said he did not
[1:28:57] even feel one of those claws hit him in

[1:31:09] it took every breath out of him when he
[1:31:11] saw the revelation of Jesus Christ The
[1:31:14] Mighty conqueror he saw all of his

[1:32:51] Neville and how that the enemy was so
[1:32:53] working on sister Neville cuz she was
[1:32:56] going through a certain time of life and
[1:32:58] brother BR says it is this way he said
[1:33:00] for every woman to pass through this
[1:33:03] Valley they must pass through this
[1:33:05] moment of darkness he said now Lord
[1:33:07] Satan would like to take her from

[1:33:12] that as she's to pass through this
[1:33:13] Valley may you be right there with her
[1:33:16] and he said when the nervousness and
[1:33:18] fretfulness wants to arise May the
[1:33:21] mercies of God move in in that moment
[1:33:24] you see what what I'm saying with that
[1:33:25] quote was it wasn't just pow the
[1:33:28] nervousness and all of it's gone it
[1:33:30] wasn't that it was that she had an

[1:34:15] look at things like that and I I say God
[1:34:18] thank you because I know how the enemy
[1:34:20] likes to wear people out as though they
[1:34:21] feel like that their need has not been
[1:34:24] met let me tell you something when
[1:34:25] something wants to arise and come back
[1:34:28] that is not a sign that you're licked
[1:34:30] it's not a sign that you're not an
[1:34:31] overcomer it's a time you need to stand
[1:34:34] right there and remind that devil I've
[1:34:36] been delivered I've been set free I've
[1:34:38] been healed and you're not going to have
[1:34:40] dominion over my
[1:34:42] life how do I do that by the right hand
[1:34:45] of
[1:34:47] godall yes sir you may not even be able
[1:34:50] to get auditory words out you might have
[1:34:52] to lip them you might have to say in
[1:34:53] your heart but let me tell you something
[1:34:55] when you say in your heart God sees it
[1:34:56] and all Heaven stands behind
[1:34:59] it my Lord we're here we're at the end

[1:35:08] close his right
[1:35:11] hand how
[1:35:14] wonderful and we have access to the
[1:35:18] right hand of God we need as we've been

[1:35:34] every day is not a right hand I don't
[1:35:36] sell you that to lower your
[1:35:38] expectations I tell you that so that you
[1:35:41] can realize the right hand is given and
[1:35:45] God makes himself
[1:35:46] known that you might be reminded that
[1:35:49] when you don't see him
[1:35:51] he's still there thank you
[1:35:55] Lord that when you move from a service
[1:35:58] you move from something that God has
[1:35:59] done in your life or another testimony
[1:36:01] of another individual listen friends
[1:36:04] testimonies that are given in this
[1:36:05] assembly it's for us it is I thank God
[1:36:08] for testimonies you know we share them
[1:36:10] from other assemblies too because I
[1:36:11] think they're wonderful it's what God is
[1:36:13] doing but you see God God's doing things
[1:36:15] right here in a local assembly and you
[1:36:17] know what that's for that's for us
[1:36:19] that's to encourage us now that test you
[1:36:21] might go out and be a blessing to
[1:36:23] somebody else but God's doing these
[1:36:25] things to encourage you and I let us not
[1:36:28] be like Israel when we come up to
[1:36:30] another situation we
[1:36:31] say bitter water what's going on

[1:40:45] it through the the prophets of
[1:40:48] old where you Lord would speak speak to
[1:40:51] the people through the prophets we see
[1:40:54] Lord as you became
[1:40:57] flesh and that Lord for
[1:41:00] Redemption you took upon a body of
[1:41:03] Flesh and here Lord what was manifested
[1:41:06] even
[1:41:08] the the young man that could testify who
[1:41:11] was
[1:41:12] blind and was
[1:41:15] healed his parents Lord under the
[1:41:17] pressure of the rulers of the synagogue
[1:41:20] they didn't want to answer the question
[1:41:21] who who did
[1:41:25] this but Lord as he stood there as a
[1:41:27] young
[1:41:28] man and he spoke to the religious of
[1:41:31] that day and he said this is a Marvel
[1:41:34] you don't know who this is but yet since
[1:41:38] the
[1:41:39] world had began there's never been this
[1:41:43] where the eyes of the blind have been
[1:41:46] opened father you were right in the
[1:41:49] Fulfillment of your word Mighty acts of
[1:41:55] power and the religious of that day
[1:41:57] could not recognize you could not see
[1:42:00] you for who you
[1:42:02] are but
[1:42:08] father there was a group there was
[1:42:10] Believers your Prophet put it like this
[1:42:12] in the message birth
[1:42:14] pains the church and that was which was
[1:42:16] waiting on you was a very very very very
[1:42:19] very small Church

[1:42:50] can go on and on how Elizabeth prayed
[1:42:53] for zakus and it seemed like it got
[1:42:56] worse but your Prophet would look down
[1:42:58] and tell us when we're praying for our
[1:43:01] loved ones and it seems like they're
[1:43:02] getting worse and maybe more contener he
[1:43:04] said that's the time God's
[1:43:05] working what an encouragement

[1:43:48] reflected through our lives Lord I'm
[1:43:50] glad we we don't have to just hear a
[1:43:53] story hear an account but I'm glad that
[1:43:57] Lord that we can be
[1:43:59] witnesses that he's the mighty conqueror
[1:44:02] in my
[1:44:03] life he's conquered he's conquered me

[1:44:41] but may they look Lord and just continue
[1:44:43] to surrender to you and allow you Lord
[1:44:46] to dismantle every desire any hold or
[1:44:48] anything that's there may they Lord
[1:44:50] continue to give themselves to you Lord
[1:44:52] may they come Lord continue to that
[1:44:54] place to Lord to hate the things that
[1:44:56] Lord are around them that they would see
[1:44:58] Lord that would seemingly get in the way
[1:45:00] and hold them back lord and just
[1:45:02] surrendering Lord themselves to you may
