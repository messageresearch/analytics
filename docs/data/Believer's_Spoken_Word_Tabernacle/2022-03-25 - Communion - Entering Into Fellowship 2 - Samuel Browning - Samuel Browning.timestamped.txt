[37:45] at the moment but it had to be thinking
[37:47] back over his life and over the tests
[37:49] and over the trials and
[37:51] even like it shows that picture in the
[37:53] footprints of the sands of times it said
[37:55] i see two foot i t two sets of uh
[37:58] footprints but sometimes i only see one
[38:00] set
[38:01] he said oh in that time that's when i
[38:03] was carrying you
[38:07] oh glory be to god in the highest amen
[38:10] don't you just love him tonight
[38:12] oh my we are certainly a blessed people
[38:15] in this hour
[38:16] amen
[38:17] let's just go to the lord in prayer if
[38:19] you'd like to stand with us
[38:20] before we turn to the word of god and
[38:24] just uh as you just continue to keep uh
[38:26] sister linda in prayer as well god will
[38:29] just continue to move and strengthen her
[38:33] i don't know if they put it out or not
[38:35] but they had to do a trach on her
[38:38] the other day
[38:40] and because they've been going back and
[38:42] forth with that breathing tube and then
[38:44] you have all of that trying to get uh
[38:47] you know strength as far as sustenance
[38:50] and things in her when we were there on
[38:52] friday before
[38:54] they did this with the trick
[38:56] this was already in the plans to do it
[38:58] so they could get her up and start doing
[39:00] the therapy even more and
[39:02] worry with some of those other
[39:04] hindrances sometimes we don't know the
[39:06] pathways god's going to take
[39:09] you know we pray for certain we pray and
[39:11] we're looking
[39:12] um and when we were there she had very
[39:15] good color and she was very
[39:18] strong and then i hear the reports
[39:20] yesterday and because the way that as i
[39:23] spoke to you before the way i've been
[39:24] praying is god will just strengthen her
[39:27] in her spirit
[39:28] and in her mind
[39:30] and
[39:31] well
[39:32] of the testimony and what i received
[39:34] even of the other day
[39:36] she's got her spunk
[39:38] and so i'm glad to hear that
[39:40] amen you know and i i spoke to you the
[39:42] other day when we were there and i said
[39:46] and linda i said brother bannon made it
[39:48] this clear
[39:50] he said you get it before you a vision
[39:53] of a perfectly whole person
[39:56] and he said you make step by step by
[39:59] step until you become that person
[40:02] i said so that that person in front of
[40:04] you is well because the lord jesus
[40:07] christ has already done the work you
[40:10] just keep walking step by step i said
[40:12] every little thing that therapy and
[40:14] everything that they're asking to be
[40:16] done
[40:17] you know
[40:19] we just believe that
[40:21] we believe that sometimes there's things
[40:22] that comes our way and it's it's
[40:24] setbacks that could it could knock us in
[40:27] our spirit and in our mind for a loop
[40:30] we don't go into anything with those
[40:31] kind of expectations
[40:33] you don't go into any surgery
[40:36] focused on the fine print
[40:38] if you do you'll call up and say uh
[40:41] i just do without
[40:43] that's why it's fine print
[40:46] you know what you're focused on
[40:49] but i'm glad we've got another report
[40:52] i'm glad we got another report
[40:54] that's a report that we're locked into
[40:56] here tonight so we want to just just
[40:58] lift her up in prayer as well
[41:01] and so
[41:02] there's other other requests even within
[41:05] that of ukraine many of the ones
[41:08] they've there's no brothers and sisters
[41:10] in maripo
[41:12] many of the other places you know
[41:13] they've just
[41:14] dispersed into other areas
[41:17] and
[41:19] one of the things you know that brother
[41:21] barry had heard a statement that he had
[41:23] made regarding and he said you just
[41:24] don't know in these times
[41:26] that god couldn't be spreading them to
[41:29] reach that last one in europe
[41:31] you don't know you see
[41:33] in the book of acts persecution came and
[41:36] it caused spreading
[41:37] if that persecution had not come
[41:40] then they wouldn't have spread and the
[41:41] gospel had not been spread
[41:43] god knows what he's doing and it's it's
[41:45] certainly the things
[41:47] is not comfortable to our flesh it's not
[41:50] comfortable in any of those things at
[41:51] all so we want to
[41:53] hold those brothers and sisters up in
[41:55] prayer
[41:56] and
[41:57] that god will just continue to
[41:58] strengthen them as well
[42:01] amen some of them that are still in that
[42:04] donbass region
[42:06] i think of donostek
[42:08] some of the believers that are there
[42:09] well when russia has come in there
[42:11] they're wanting
[42:14] they've up to age to where now they're
[42:16] recruiting to take the men that are
[42:18] there and turn them against their own
[42:20] country
[42:21] in battle so you've got brothers and
[42:23] sisters there all the way up to age 65
[42:26] and so
[42:27] we're just praying that you know they
[42:29] won't have to enter into that place and
[42:31] that part of it
[42:32] and you realize where we're where we're
[42:34] at brother bannon made it so clear i
[42:36] just say it in this way
[42:38] putin seems like he's strong
[42:40] but he's afraid
[42:42] but the brandon brother ram told us he
[42:44] said his fear on either side
[42:46] fear on either side
[42:48] and so you see it's fear that's
[42:50] dominating these things and what's
[42:52] driving it but in a tremendous that in
[42:54] an hour that we live in when there is
[42:56] fear and there is tensions everywhere
[42:59] that the bride of jesus christ
[43:01] we can dwell
[43:02] in perfect love
[43:04] and it it cast out fear
[43:06] it didn't say that sometimes fear might
[43:08] not try to encroach but we've got a
[43:10] strength within us just like the dove
[43:12] has that oil within her
[43:14] she don't have to take a bath she's got
[43:16] an oil that keeps her clean
[43:18] and perfect love it cast out all fear
[43:21] amen we thank god for that so let's just

[46:34] amen amen
[46:37] amen
[46:38] let's turn in our bibles to first john
[46:40] chapter one and i certainly love you
[46:44] lord tonight so good to
[46:46] see you
[46:48] and tonight just trust the lord will
[46:50] just
[46:52] just come by our way and just speak to
[46:54] us in a very personal way tonight
[46:58] i want to read here
[47:00] in in first john chapter 1 and verse 1
[47:03] and i have a
[47:05] few scriptures here to read
[47:08] john writes it in this way
[47:10] that which was from the beginning
[47:13] which we have heard
[47:15] which we have seen with our eyes
[47:18] which we have looked upon
[47:20] and our hands have handled of the word
[47:23] of life
[47:24] for the life was manifested and we have
[47:28] seen it and bear witness and show unto
[47:31] you
[47:32] that eternal life which was with the
[47:34] father
[47:36] and was manifested unto us
[47:39] notice notice verse 3 that which we have
[47:42] seen and heard declare we unto you
[47:46] that ye also
[47:48] may have fellowship with us
[47:51] and truly our fellowship is with the
[47:54] father and with his son
[47:57] jesus christ and these things right we
[48:00] unto you that your joy may be full
[48:03] this then is the message which we have
[48:05] heard of him and declare unto you that
[48:07] god is light and in him is no darkness
[48:10] at all
[48:11] if we say we have fellowship with him
[48:13] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[48:16] the truth
[48:17] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[48:20] the light we have fellowship one with
[48:23] another and the blood of jesus christ
[48:27] his son
[48:28] cleanses us
[48:29] from all sin
[48:32] amen may god bless the reading of the
[48:33] word as you're being seated
[48:36] if if we can just
[48:38] looking in the scripture here and we've
[48:40] been dealing with
[48:41] on prayer
[48:43] what prayer really is
[48:46] prayer is a is a real time of communion
[48:50] god would make a way that you and i can
[48:52] come back into that place that not only
[48:55] to speak to him but to hear from him
[48:59] and as we've
[49:00] been looking at it that
[49:02] there's many
[49:04] when we look in the scriptures
[49:06] the
[49:07] as jesus would say ask the father
[49:09] anything in my name
[49:11] and i'll do it
[49:12] and
[49:13] you know people i know people that
[49:17] though not walking in the light of the
[49:19] truth but when they can pray
[49:21] and pray for different needs and
[49:23] there'll be things that take transpire
[49:26] take place god will answer them
[49:29] and that's that's just the mercy of god
[49:32] but you see this when we talk about
[49:35] communion this is where god
[49:37] is disclosing his heart
[49:40] brother branham would speak of it in
[49:42] this way in christ the mystery and he
[49:44] would say
[49:45] how that god is not
[49:48] uh he said though
[49:49] though he said it's to all to anybody he
[49:53] said it's to all but he says it's only
[49:56] the elect that's going to respond
[49:59] and he said it's just like he said the
[50:01] that he said for that young lady that
[50:04] you're going to marry and he brings that
[50:06] type in because that's the real type of
[50:08] communion and fellowship and
[50:10] relationship he said is that you begin
[50:13] to disclose to her
[50:15] secrets of your heart
[50:16] and brother brown says that's where he
[50:18] said god he said he's not letting
[50:20] flirters know what's going on he said
[50:24] he's speaking his love secrets to his
[50:26] bride
[50:27] that's a channel of comm of communion
[50:30] between god and his bride just like it
[50:32] would be between a husband and a wife
[50:35] things that's just exclusive and let me
[50:37] just say it in this way that should be
[50:39] exclusive between a husband and wife
[50:41] and i i would you know i would say it in
[50:44] this way that there are things that are
[50:46] just there that is exclusive to that
[50:49] household
[50:50] that well we could go on on that but i'm
[50:52] not going to dwell on that but we're
[50:54] such a such a thing that could be
[50:56] applied in other words let me say it in
[50:58] this way that not everybody knows your
[51:01] business
[51:02] is that okay to say it that way there's
[51:04] a special inside of that of that house
[51:07] it's not that things are done wrong it's
[51:09] that when as we look at it with christ
[51:12] and his bride that christ has such a way
[51:15] of how that he has moved in our life to
[51:17] our faults our failures our mistakes he
[51:20] never discloses to no one else
[51:24] it is personal between he and i
[51:27] is that right
[51:28] and there is a communion of how that he
[51:30] deals with our life my life how he deals
[51:33] personally with our lives with one
[51:35] another there's a fellowship that we
[51:37] have and john would would speak of it in
[51:40] this way the desire notice this
[51:43] fellowship that god had of what was
[51:45] there in the beginning
[51:48] there in the garden of eden notice how
[51:51] that this fellowship in the restoring of
[51:53] it john writes of it in john 1 1 of how
[51:56] the word that was with god the word was
[51:59] god how that same word came down and
[52:02] became flesh now
[52:05] through the through and by the shed
[52:07] blood the the opening of the weight now
[52:10] that same life that now comes upon the
[52:13] worshiper and brings you and i into that
[52:16] place of a restored fellowship and
[52:18] notice the burning the desire as it's
[52:22] expressed in first john 1 3 that that
[52:24] which we've seen and heard declare we
[52:27] unto you
[52:28] that ye also may have fellowship with us
[52:32] and truly our fellowship is with the
[52:34] father and with his son jesus christ in
[52:37] other words john here is the heart of
[52:39] god the heart of christ that's long
[52:42] that's being expressed for fellowship
[52:46] it's an invitation to come into
[52:48] fellowship you see this fellowship does
[52:51] not come in a manner of of of borders or
[52:55] just to say it's got to be here and if
[52:58] it's not here that's that's not how this
[53:00] fellowship works this fellowship what
[53:03] john is saying is the fellowship we're
[53:05] expressing to you is the fellowship that
[53:08] we have
[53:09] with the father and with his son jesus
[53:12] christ
[53:13] so here's a fellowship that he's
[53:15] expressing a way that has been opened up
[53:18] and here when we look in in 1st john
[53:21] chapter 1 verse 8 just continuing there
[53:24] in our text it says if we say that we
[53:26] have no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[53:30] truth is not in us
[53:32] if we confess our sins that's that's a
[53:34] big one right there if we confess our
[53:37] sins in other words
[53:39] come completely clean with god because
[53:41] god already knows what's there before us
[53:46] and if we confess our sins he is
[53:49] faithful and just to forgive us
[53:53] and to cleanse us from all
[53:55] unrighteousness so this confession leads
[53:58] to it brings about a forgiveness that's
[54:01] his faithfulness god's faithfulness is
[54:04] not when the sin is confessed to dwell
[54:06] upon oh how bad this says and now no as
[54:09] soon as it's confessed then forgiveness
[54:13] he's faithful to forgive and it leads
[54:16] into
[54:17] reconciliation cleanse us from all
[54:20] unrighteousness in other words deal with
[54:23] the very root of the problem that was
[54:26] there in the beginning aren't you glad
[54:28] for that
[54:29] if we confess our sins if we say that we
[54:32] have not sinned we make him a liar and
[54:35] his word is not in us so when we we look
[54:38] at this i when i look at those three
[54:41] scriptures there that is it's very uh
[54:44] imperative that in every generation that
[54:47] every generation has a fresh chance at
[54:50] the word of god no matter the the the
[54:54] knowledge that we can have of the word
[54:56] and i can speak for young people on up
[54:58] no matters we're setting underneath a
[55:00] gospel of truth and of power but it
[55:04] still has to come to a realization that
[55:06] i'm a sinner no matter if mommy and
[55:09] daddy holy ghost field but you have to
[55:12] have your own experience with god
[55:14] it doesn't matter even coming to a
[55:16] church doesn't even matter when we say
[55:18] well i believe brother branham's a
[55:20] prophet we first have to be able to
[55:22] really see has the words dealing with
[55:24] our life that i need a personal
[55:27] experience with jesus christ
[55:30] because if not we're just changing out
[55:33] theology we trade in baptist theology
[55:36] for message theology and that's why
[55:38] brother branham could say when he spoke
[55:40] to the young people he would say say to
[55:42] them in one of the messages on
[55:43] leadership he said we just don't want to
[55:46] come and learn the message
[55:48] we want to have a personal experience
[55:52] with jesus christ
[55:54] so when we look at it it's to be a life
[55:57] this message that god has sent to you
[56:00] and i
[56:01] is to be an expression of our life and
[56:03] that's what john was writing this
[56:06] fellowship that we're declaring there is
[56:09] an expression of god's own life working
[56:11] out through our life it's the same
[56:13] fellowship that they noticed in the book
[56:16] of acts that peter and john had when
[56:19] they took notice they're ignorant
[56:21] they're unlearned but they've been with
[56:23] jesus
[56:24] you see what stood out was they've been
[56:26] with jesus
[56:28] what was the effect they had fellowship
[56:30] with the lord jesus they had come in by
[56:33] the new birth to a full fellowship
[56:35] remember they walked with him while he
[56:38] was here upon the earth
[56:39] they sat around the campfire with him
[56:42] but they did not have the fellowship
[56:44] that he desired to restore back to them
[56:48] but that fellowship are you hearing me
[56:50] tonight that fellowship that they had
[56:52] around the campfire that word being made
[56:55] known and visibly before them that
[56:57] testimony that they could see and say
[57:00] that what moses spoke of by the spirit
[57:02] of god we found him when peter could say
[57:06] in that in that manner where else can we
[57:09] go thou alone has the words of eternal
[57:11] life those were necessary moments of
[57:15] fellowship to stir their hearts into the
[57:20] fellowship that god had intended for
[57:23] them which would come after the offering
[57:26] up of the sacrifice the resurrection and
[57:29] now through the outpouring of the holy
[57:30] ghost you say brother samuel what are
[57:32] you saying i'm saying that's just like
[57:34] family altar that's just like our homes
[57:37] that's just like right here it's
[57:38] necessary there being a fellowship with
[57:42] jesus christ it's true we cannot give
[57:45] our children the new birth i can't give
[57:47] you the new birth you can't give we
[57:50] can't go vice versa but if we can come
[57:52] into that place there's such a
[57:54] fellowship we can stand like john and
[57:57] say the fellowship that we have we're
[58:00] declaring that fellowship with you and
[58:02] we're letting you know it's for you too
[58:08] hallelujah it's necessary
[58:12] it's very necessary so to think
[58:14] what a power of this fellowship when we
[58:17] talk about this fellowship we're talking
[58:20] about the holy spirit
[58:22] taking up residency in our lives
[58:26] where that life has been
[58:28] changed and that that channel of
[58:30] communication now is fully open that god
[58:34] is speaking to a son and daughter of god
[58:37] that has been brought into expression by
[58:39] his own life
[58:41] you see when we look at that of the lord
[58:43] jesus the way
[58:45] into the holiest of holies when you
[58:47] think of the tabernacle there in the
[58:50] wilderness was which was an expression
[58:52] of you and i living in a three-room
[58:54] house
[58:55] and god's ultimate desire
[58:57] was that that fellowship would be
[59:00] restored but it wouldn't be restored in
[59:02] the first court of our flesh it wouldn't
[59:05] be restored in our spirit realm but it
[59:08] was to be restored in that of the most
[59:11] sacred place in that of the soul on the
[59:14] inside that's where he told moses i will
[59:17] meet thee there and commune with you
[59:20] there
[59:22] and yet we realize every one of these
[59:24] other parts that go along with that of
[59:26] the tabernacle that you and i
[59:29] when we see it in this hour god came
[59:31] down
[59:32] he came down and lived in a three-room
[59:34] house expressed exactly what man had
[59:38] lost in the fall he was the expression
[59:41] he paid the price and there was a
[59:43] communion that he had with the father
[59:46] that he could say i thank thee that thou
[59:49] hearest me always it was a communion
[59:52] that he could he was he was looking he
[59:54] was in tune with what the spirit wanted
[59:57] to be done at that time the spirit would
[59:59] call to him quicken to him different
[1:00:02] things that needed to happen in that
[1:00:04] junction of time you see that was god
[1:00:07] expressing this is the fellowship that
[1:00:10] we're to have and we have a pleasure to
[1:00:12] have with god friends your eye
[1:00:15] it's not us finding our way it's the
[1:00:17] spirit of god that has come and sought
[1:00:19] us out it's called quickening to us the
[1:00:22] things that even we're to be praying
[1:00:24] about
[1:00:25] it's god's desire can't you see even in
[1:00:27] that i believe we can it's god's desire
[1:00:30] and longing for fellowship that god
[1:00:32] would reveal and make himself known so
[1:00:35] that you and i could begin to seek for
[1:00:38] those things to come to pass in our life
[1:00:41] you see this this way that's been opened
[1:00:44] into this kind of glory it opened the
[1:00:47] way through the shedding of the veil
[1:00:50] there you know at calvary it opened the
[1:00:52] way so that man could come back into a
[1:00:56] real pentecostal fellowship into a place
[1:00:59] of the presence of god where the power
[1:01:02] of god will cleanse that man or that
[1:01:05] woman from all unrighteousness to where
[1:01:07] they become new creatures in christ
[1:01:10] jesus where all backwardness and
[1:01:12] shameness is taken away from that life
[1:01:16] like paul could say be not ashamed of me
[1:01:19] nor the testimony of jesus christ paul
[1:01:21] could say i'm not ashamed of the gospel
[1:01:24] of jesus christ you see paul was
[1:01:27] expressing that there was nothing that
[1:01:29] he had to be ashamed of but it was the
[1:01:31] greatest
[1:01:32] greatest privilege paul had been
[1:01:34] identified with great men like camilla
[1:01:38] and the rest of them but paul could look
[1:01:40] at this those men could not do for paul
[1:01:43] what the lord jesus did the lord jesus
[1:01:46] brought paul into a fellowship paul knew
[1:01:48] the word but that was not the fellowship
[1:01:52] that god was calling him to he was
[1:01:54] calling him to where the word would not
[1:01:56] be out here but that word would be on
[1:01:59] the inside of his life it would be god
[1:02:02] wrapped up in that veil
[1:02:05] a fellowship where god could speak to
[1:02:08] him personally where god speaks to you
[1:02:11] and i personally and that's why that in
[1:02:13] the in the time when we consider and we
[1:02:16] look at it of how that the bible speaks
[1:02:20] of how that the bride of jesus christ is
[1:02:23] to be bringing forth children
[1:02:25] children that are crying have a father
[1:02:28] god doesn't have grandchildren
[1:02:31] right
[1:02:32] god has only
[1:02:34] children only sons
[1:02:36] when you find how god would reveal
[1:02:38] himself in the old testament uh just an
[1:02:42] example when you take that of of isaac
[1:02:45] and you recognize that though when god
[1:02:47] would speak to isaac or even to jacob
[1:02:50] let me just take jacob for a man or he
[1:02:52] can talk about it with isaac as well and
[1:02:55] notice he would speak to jacob and he
[1:02:57] says i am the god of your father abraham
[1:03:00] he never said i'm the god of your
[1:03:02] grandfather
[1:03:03] and the god of your father abraham
[1:03:07] god reveals himself
[1:03:09] personally to every generation to every
[1:03:12] one of his children in a personal way
[1:03:15] that's why the recording in the book of
[1:03:17] hebrews is where it speaks of the
[1:03:20] writing of the book and it declares that
[1:03:22] the gathering of the brethren it's the
[1:03:25] church of the firstborn
[1:03:28] so god only has sons he doesn't have any
[1:03:31] grandchildren whatsoever but when we
[1:03:34] look at this entering into the
[1:03:36] fellowship i tell you we as we said we
[1:03:39] recognize without the mercy of god
[1:03:43] your eye would not be able to find our
[1:03:46] way
[1:03:47] i think our brother billy paul said it
[1:03:49] he said before god sent his prophet he
[1:03:51] said farmers didn't even know how to
[1:03:52] cross a fence
[1:03:54] i know that's pretty simple but you
[1:03:56] understand what i'm saying when we look
[1:03:58] at it god revealed and opened up the way
[1:04:02] for you and i in this hour then we can
[1:04:05] come into a full relationship with jesus
[1:04:08] christ
[1:04:09] you see here we come into the place
[1:04:11] hebrews chapter 10 let's just move right
[1:04:14] back into here in hebrews 10 verse 19 it
[1:04:17] says having therefore brethren boldness
[1:04:20] to enter into the holiest by the blood
[1:04:23] of jesus
[1:04:25] this is god's
[1:04:27] desire this what i will read here in
[1:04:30] these verses is the effect of fellowship
[1:04:34] being restored
[1:04:36] having boldness therefore brethren to
[1:04:38] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[1:04:41] jesus by a new and living way which he
[1:04:45] hath consecrated for us through the veil
[1:04:47] that is to say his flesh
[1:04:50] and having a high priest over the house
[1:04:52] of god let us draw near with a true
[1:04:55] heart in full assurance of faith having
[1:04:58] our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:05:01] conscience and our bodies washed with
[1:05:04] pure water
[1:05:05] because here god moves down to remove or
[1:05:10] to deal with what is between or
[1:05:13] hindering fellowship
[1:05:15] because
[1:05:16] because without without us coming
[1:05:19] through the blood or as we're coming to
[1:05:21] that place there is sin that is between
[1:05:24] us and god as the prophet would call it
[1:05:26] a chasm and that sin has to be dealt
[1:05:30] with and god has already made a way
[1:05:34] through him by the blood of jesus that
[1:05:36] that sin has been dealt with
[1:05:38] that's where when we can come to that
[1:05:40] place to confess our sins he's faithful
[1:05:44] and just to forgive us and cleanse us
[1:05:47] from all unrighteousness that we might
[1:05:50] have be able to come before him with a
[1:05:53] true heart
[1:05:54] because you can't commune with anybody
[1:05:56] you're on edge with
[1:05:59] you can't you avoid them
[1:06:01] are you hearing me
[1:06:02] see this is god's working you and i
[1:06:05] could not do this even when we look in
[1:06:07] the old testament when god made a way of
[1:06:11] where he would take that of an innocent
[1:06:13] an innocent one there in the fall in the
[1:06:15] beginning and he would throw them you
[1:06:18] know the the clothing the garments of
[1:06:20] that innocent one back in there and they
[1:06:23] would stand there clothed in those
[1:06:24] bloody garments in the presence of
[1:06:26] almighty god that's the only way they
[1:06:29] could stand in his presence and here as
[1:06:32] the as as paul is writing by the spirit
[1:06:34] of god that our hearts have been
[1:06:36] sprinkled from
[1:06:38] or as brother braham says shook away
[1:06:40] from a conscience he's dealt with the
[1:06:42] sin problem evil and darkness has been
[1:06:45] shook out of it and our bodies have been
[1:06:48] washed with pure water through water
[1:06:50] baptism in the name of jesus christ and
[1:06:53] we can walk freely and boldly up to god
[1:06:56] knowing this that the evil that i once
[1:06:59] loved has passed away
[1:07:01] knowing that the life that i once lived
[1:07:04] is now ceased not because i did it
[1:07:07] because something come in me and did it
[1:07:10] itself
[1:07:13] oh glory be to god
[1:07:15] by grace he saved me i believed him he
[1:07:18] gave me the holy spirit and the things
[1:07:20] that i once hated i now love the
[1:07:23] sacrifice it used to be hard for me to
[1:07:25] go to church now i love to go to hear
[1:07:28] the people sing shout and testify i used
[1:07:31] to hate it i love it now something has
[1:07:34] changed me
[1:07:35] then i have a new and living way
[1:07:38] oh my
[1:07:39] this is an expression the new and living
[1:07:41] way is an expression through our lives
[1:07:44] something has anchored here i know when
[1:07:47] i went down into the water and they
[1:07:49] baptized me in the name of jesus christ
[1:07:52] and i have received his life
[1:07:58] gone made a way god's preparation
[1:08:00] for fellowship it's just like if you
[1:08:02] were going to have someone to your house
[1:08:06] well you don't invite somebody to your
[1:08:07] house and expect them to bring the
[1:08:09] dishes and the food and
[1:08:11] come over and you know clean it and set
[1:08:13] everything else up and
[1:08:15] cook it
[1:08:17] i don't think you do that
[1:08:19] no you you make preparations
[1:08:23] right you everything is taken care of to
[1:08:25] make sure
[1:08:27] that the guest will be able to come in
[1:08:29] and there'll be a meal that's provided
[1:08:32] in that in the natural of what you and i
[1:08:34] could do out of a desire to have
[1:08:37] fellowship with brother and sister
[1:08:39] family families what have you
[1:08:41] how much greater that god before the
[1:08:44] foundation of the world
[1:08:47] before adam dust or molecule god already
[1:08:51] provided in the mind of god the way that
[1:08:54] it would be unfolded for you and i to
[1:08:57] come back into fellowship with him
[1:09:00] and he knew we would desire to come back
[1:09:03] into fellowship with him
[1:09:05] as a matter of fact when job when job
[1:09:09] you know in the writing there is the
[1:09:11] realization that the morning stars
[1:09:14] shouted for joy
[1:09:16] what were what were the mornings start
[1:09:18] shouting about that's speaking of you
[1:09:20] and i
[1:09:21] when we could see
[1:09:23] our salvation through the lamb of god
[1:09:27] there was a shouting that went on oh i
[1:09:30] mean think about it that was the focus
[1:09:33] but now when we look at how god has made
[1:09:36] a way that that that you and i can come
[1:09:39] in to that fellowship
[1:09:41] back with god once again god provided
[1:09:45] the way god made a way god gave the
[1:09:47] sacrifice you see god knew you and i
[1:09:50] would desire that because we are a part
[1:09:54] of him
[1:09:55] and he desired fellowship as adam in the
[1:09:58] beginning he's spoken you know here gave
[1:10:01] names to all of the animals but there
[1:10:03] was still something
[1:10:05] that god could see within him
[1:10:10] you don't read it in the scripture it's
[1:10:12] not an utterance it's a silence but god
[1:10:15] sees the silence and in there he sees
[1:10:19] there's a longing for fellowship
[1:10:23] hallelujah so god addresses what nothing
[1:10:26] else can be seen no one else sees it or
[1:10:29] knows it but god sees that desire what
[1:10:32] was it it was something that even adam
[1:10:35] could not explain but he was desiring a
[1:10:38] fellowship with one of his kind
[1:10:43] that's what god that portrayals air is
[1:10:46] exactly what god had in mind that god
[1:10:49] had a desire to have fellowship with one
[1:10:53] of his kind in other words somebody
[1:10:55] someone he can speak to that won't look
[1:10:58] at him and say that's not necessary but
[1:11:01] he wants somebody he can speak to and
[1:11:03] have communion with and welcome his
[1:11:06] words and will take it to their heart
[1:11:09] where his desire it pulsates within them
[1:11:14] god placed that desire in you and me
[1:11:18] god knew that we would want the holy
[1:11:20] ghost
[1:11:21] because there's a desire within you and
[1:11:24] i that calls out for life
[1:11:27] it calls out for fellowship
[1:11:30] remember as we were looking at last week
[1:11:32] and i just want to move through this
[1:11:33] into certain places
[1:11:35] of how
[1:11:37] in numbers 19
[1:11:38] where they were to take
[1:11:40] a red heifer
[1:11:43] and they were too that red heifer could
[1:11:45] not have
[1:11:46] have been yoked
[1:11:48] with anything
[1:11:50] it could never have had a yoke on it
[1:11:53] i was speaking of christ
[1:11:55] it was speaking of the word of god
[1:11:57] that never to be yoked up with a
[1:12:00] denomination
[1:12:02] never to be yoked up with an idea of man
[1:12:07] it's christ that's above it all right
[1:12:10] so this is there this this opening of
[1:12:13] where there would be no spot in it no
[1:12:15] blemish in it and then they were to take
[1:12:19] of of the blood of this red heifer and
[1:12:22] the bible tells us of how they would
[1:12:24] sprinkle that blood
[1:12:26] seven times before the tabernacle of the
[1:12:30] congregation
[1:12:32] and how that they would take of the
[1:12:33] ashes of where they would they would
[1:12:36] they were there after the offering they
[1:12:38] would burn that that red heifer and they
[1:12:40] would take those ashes and they would be
[1:12:42] kept up
[1:12:43] to for for uh waters of separation to
[1:12:47] where would be placed in a vessel where
[1:12:49] running water and it could be sprinkled
[1:12:52] upon the unclean it could be sprinkled
[1:12:54] on one that maybe had fallen out of
[1:12:57] fellowship it could be sprinkled on them
[1:12:59] has waters of separation that was the
[1:13:02] beginning to enter into fellowship
[1:13:07] now think of this in this manner that
[1:13:10] was to be that
[1:13:13] what had been done there was the ashes
[1:13:15] were gathered and they were to be kept
[1:13:18] up in verse 9 of numbers 19 just to
[1:13:21] reference that they were to keep this up
[1:13:24] for the congregation of the children of
[1:13:26] israel for a water of separation let me
[1:13:29] say this it wasn't for everybody
[1:13:33] this was for god god gave this this is
[1:13:36] for that of the congregation of israel
[1:13:40] and the prophet would place it down so
[1:13:42] clearly he said notice this is what god
[1:13:46] has given of the bread of life is for
[1:13:49] his bride his believing children
[1:13:52] knowing that he would take the waters of
[1:13:55] separation in order to bring you an eye
[1:13:58] back into fellowship under the blood
[1:14:04] hallelujah and those seven stripes it
[1:14:06] spoke of seven ages
[1:14:09] it spoke of a time of those gentile ages
[1:14:12] even though it was given there but it
[1:14:15] would speak in this time where you and i
[1:14:17] are out and there would be seven ages
[1:14:20] because every age when we remember as we
[1:14:23] read last week and you read in
[1:14:25] revelations one the seven churches the
[1:14:28] seven spirits the seven stars are the
[1:14:31] seven messengers it's the same holy
[1:14:33] spirit
[1:14:34] it's the same holy spirit coming and
[1:14:37] delivering the message to each
[1:14:41] generation to come under the blood
[1:14:45] amen it's no other message where
[1:14:47] everywhere even in the beginning in the
[1:14:50] ephesian age where the church had
[1:14:52] already fallen entering into that age
[1:14:55] but remember the message was to call
[1:14:57] them uh separate them away from the
[1:15:00] traditions of man because satan started
[1:15:03] out right there in that first age or
[1:15:05] writing into it to substitute the
[1:15:08] reality of jesus christ in the heart and
[1:15:11] life of the people satan doesn't care
[1:15:14] how religious that we are but if he can
[1:15:17] keep that relationship where there is no
[1:15:20] fellowship between god and his people to
[1:15:23] where it is
[1:15:25] no longer god dwelling in the heart of
[1:15:27] the people then he's got to defeat it
[1:15:29] because it isn't the word out here that
[1:15:32] backs the devil up he's not listening to
[1:15:35] our voice but it's the voice of the word
[1:15:38] on the inside of us
[1:15:40] that backs him up
[1:15:42] and so god in simplicity
[1:15:45] would sin this is why
[1:15:47] god sends a message
[1:15:50] i want you just to phone in here just a
[1:15:52] moment just
[1:15:54] some things really pressing on my heart
[1:15:56] because
[1:15:58] when god sends a message
[1:16:00] it's not like the rest
[1:16:02] it's not a blending in with the world
[1:16:05] when god sends a message think how the
[1:16:07] world looks at it the world looks at it
[1:16:09] with harshness well we don't have to do
[1:16:11] that we don't have to do that that's
[1:16:13] unnecessary but if they can only hear
[1:16:16] that the voice yes it's correction but
[1:16:18] it's a voice to break the whole of
[1:16:21] delusion and that voice that that is
[1:16:23] there holding them in bondage and
[1:16:25] keeping them back from a relationship
[1:16:28] with jesus christ
[1:16:30] it's the mercy of god to every age
[1:16:35] god's sending his word let me say this
[1:16:37] even to every young person and every
[1:16:39] person gathered here it's the mercy of
[1:16:42] god that comes right to your doorstep
[1:16:45] and lets you know that there is a need
[1:16:48] for a real relationship and it's him
[1:16:52] that's asking you i want a relationship
[1:16:55] i'm standing at the door i'm knocking
[1:16:58] open up and i'll come in i'm not going
[1:17:01] to force my way in
[1:17:03] but i'll come in
[1:17:05] and we'll have communion
[1:17:10] that's god's desire it's a mercy of god
[1:17:16] so
[1:17:17] these waters were waters of separation
[1:17:22] that's why with the sprinkling of those
[1:17:24] waters
[1:17:26] if waters say come join a church that
[1:17:28] ain't the waters of separation
[1:17:31] if waters say you believe brother braham
[1:17:33] is a prophet that's not the waters of
[1:17:34] separation
[1:17:38] are you hearing me
[1:17:40] listen the devil knows brother brandon
[1:17:42] was a prophet
[1:17:44] he experienced many times
[1:17:46] the mighty god coming down and through
[1:17:48] that vessel
[1:17:49] being cast out our lives
[1:17:52] no question with him
[1:17:54] right but that in itself is not it's not
[1:17:57] an evidence
[1:17:58] but so we look the waters themselves
[1:18:01] what are the waters when you see it
[1:18:03] water's a separation so it's not waters
[1:18:06] that come to allow us to remain in the
[1:18:09] condition that we're in
[1:18:11] it's waters that come to bring a
[1:18:14] separation
[1:18:16] or draw us into fellowship with god
[1:18:21] and in order to come into fellowship
[1:18:22] with god we've got to be washed
[1:18:26] the waters of separation must come forth
[1:18:29] and it brings conviction in our life
[1:18:37] oh my this is why when we when we
[1:18:40] examine this here
[1:18:42] that in order to enter into this place
[1:18:45] of fellowship
[1:18:47] and i think i referred to this one in
[1:18:49] closing last week
[1:18:51] brother rahm's talking about this place
[1:18:53] of fellowship
[1:18:54] of relationship of communion
[1:18:57] in the holiest of wholeness
[1:19:00] before you can enter this place there's
[1:19:02] a blood veil hanging there
[1:19:04] for the cleansing
[1:19:06] and you must recognize that blood as an
[1:19:10] innocent
[1:19:11] substitute
[1:19:12] see that's very important
[1:19:15] is to recognize that blood as an
[1:19:17] innocent substitute
[1:19:19] it's not it's not something that a
[1:19:22] church has done or a man can do for you
[1:19:25] but to recognize the blood of an
[1:19:27] innocent one you see what it is it's
[1:19:30] taking the eyes of the worshipper off of
[1:19:33] himself
[1:19:35] the waters of separation it brings
[1:19:37] conviction it it it brings a cleansing
[1:19:40] it brings a separation as that man would
[1:19:43] enter in he's separating there it's
[1:19:46] separating him from his sin there's a
[1:19:48] even in his mind his thinking becomes
[1:19:51] different he begins to feed upon the
[1:19:54] word of god let me just say this to you
[1:19:56] just trying to
[1:19:58] just go
[1:19:59] in a very not to move in a fast manner
[1:20:02] but many times
[1:20:05] lives come into a place where the waters
[1:20:07] of separation has dealt with that life
[1:20:11] but you have to continue
[1:20:14] to allow the waters of separation
[1:20:17] to wash you
[1:20:20] this is where you feed on the word of
[1:20:22] god
[1:20:23] you draw strength you have to feed your
[1:20:26] experience
[1:20:28] you can say brother samuel i i've got to
[1:20:30] come clear all the way in there but
[1:20:32] remember fellowship itself is the holy
[1:20:35] spirit drawing you bringing you to the
[1:20:38] place to where you look at and you see
[1:20:41] the blood that's gone before you one has
[1:20:44] made a way that you and i you can come
[1:20:46] into this place and we feed upon that
[1:20:49] word
[1:20:53] so many times
[1:20:54] you know don't don't look for feelings
[1:20:57] upon things just just feed on the word
[1:21:01] take the word into your life
[1:21:03] put on a message over the same i don't
[1:21:05] understand that well that's no reason to
[1:21:07] turn it off you're not going to
[1:21:09] understand it the more you turn it off
[1:21:11] but give yourself to it
[1:21:15] give yourself to it
[1:21:17] read in the scriptures pray
[1:21:20] this is part of entering into fellowship
[1:21:23] if you can't do that now
[1:21:25] why would you want to go into fellowship
[1:21:27] with him because fellowship and
[1:21:29] communion with him this is where you're
[1:21:31] in that place like jacob's son where the
[1:21:34] angels of god are ascending and
[1:21:36] descending you're in a place of
[1:21:38] communion of fellowship with him
[1:21:42] this is why even right here
[1:21:46] lives and we're pointing to
[1:21:48] to the full fellowship and we stop right
[1:21:50] there we stop
[1:21:52] but you got to keep going
[1:21:55] gonna keep going
[1:21:57] through the preaching so through the
[1:21:58] preaching of the word
[1:22:00] that veil of blood is brought down it's
[1:22:03] made personal see it's not a historical
[1:22:06] gospel
[1:22:07] it's a living god that comes present
[1:22:10] right here among us to deal with our
[1:22:12] lives to where it's not something
[1:22:14] pointing back in history but a living
[1:22:16] god who comes down right there in the
[1:22:18] midst of our life and the bible says
[1:22:21] that the spirit of man is as the candle
[1:22:23] of the lord where god begins to go down
[1:22:26] and it begins to just now it's a
[1:22:28] searching all through the spirit of man
[1:22:32] it's god searching there the light of
[1:22:34] the word bringing discernment it's not
[1:22:37] you and i guessing of things but it's
[1:22:39] god who is coming to expose the hold of
[1:22:44] darkness light exposes that that we
[1:22:48] might walk into the light if we'll walk
[1:22:51] in the light as he's in the light then
[1:22:53] we have fellowship one with another and
[1:22:56] let me just say this that's why we
[1:22:58] continually
[1:22:59] even after entering into fellowship
[1:23:02] there is a burning in our lives to stay
[1:23:05] in that place of fellowship in other
[1:23:07] words where we're open we're available
[1:23:10] we're in contact with god where he can
[1:23:13] speak to us where there's nothing
[1:23:15] between he or i there's no funny
[1:23:17] feelings at all no condemnation at all
[1:23:20] but where there is an openness
[1:23:24] and that's why the waters of separation
[1:23:27] the preaching of the word as it goes
[1:23:29] forth it's god's desire that you and i
[1:23:32] would stay in that place
[1:23:34] of fellowship and communion with him
[1:23:37] because you see when that veil of blood
[1:23:40] is brought down then
[1:23:42] all the things of
[1:23:44] early earthly possessions
[1:23:47] brother brown said all the fang dangle
[1:23:49] ideas and your dancing and more on
[1:23:50] living and all the things that you
[1:23:52] thought up of your own self and all
[1:23:54] these things that you do i go to church
[1:23:56] i do this i do that i don't eat meat and
[1:23:58] all these things you lay it aside
[1:24:00] when the blood veil
[1:24:02] is brought before you
[1:24:04] and then he says coming forth from your
[1:24:06] heart is pledge me in plunge me into the
[1:24:09] blood and say lord wash me and cleanse
[1:24:12] me
[1:24:16] i'm not just reading quotes tonight
[1:24:20] this is direction
[1:24:23] lord wash me and cleanse me
[1:24:26] you see he's not gonna do we must invite
[1:24:28] him
[1:24:30] lord wash me and cleanse me well i have
[1:24:32] this in my life there's power in the
[1:24:34] blood the innocent one has suffered for
[1:24:37] the guilty
[1:24:39] he's made a way that you and i can grow
[1:24:42] free as a matter of fact we're already
[1:24:45] free we have to come to that realization
[1:24:48] i've been made free what are you saying
[1:24:50] johnny crow look down and realize that
[1:24:53] the string is no longer on your leg quit
[1:24:57] walking back and forth across that fence
[1:24:59] post he who the son has set free is free
[1:25:04] indeed
[1:25:06] [Applause]
[1:25:07] wash me and cleanse me
[1:25:09] then the holy spirit inside of this
[1:25:11] blood cell where the fellowship is it'll
[1:25:14] draw you through the blood of cleansing
[1:25:17] into the lord jesus by the holy spirit
[1:25:21] so in mark
[1:25:24] 8
[1:25:24] 38
[1:25:26] the scripture said whosoever therefore
[1:25:29] shall be ashamed of me
[1:25:31] and my words in this adulterous and
[1:25:33] sinful generation of him also shall the
[1:25:36] son of man be ashamed when he cometh in
[1:25:38] the glory of his father
[1:25:41] and the holy angels
[1:25:43] he made a way for you and i
[1:25:46] there had to be
[1:25:47] there's no other place of fellowship
[1:25:49] than under the blood
[1:25:52] now once you think of this
[1:25:53] there's no other place of fellowship
[1:25:55] than under the blood i'm laying some
[1:25:57] groundwork for some things coming on
[1:25:58] sundays
[1:25:59] there's no other place for fellowship
[1:26:02] we're not talking about the chemical
[1:26:04] we're talking about the life that was
[1:26:06] inside of the blood the blood was shed
[1:26:10] on the day of atonement which would
[1:26:13] coincide there every 50 years there
[1:26:15] would be a concern
[1:26:17] a coinciding there of the jubilee there
[1:26:20] would be one that would blow the horn or
[1:26:23] the shofar and when they would blow that
[1:26:26] it was an announcement though others
[1:26:28] weren't there they didn't see the blood
[1:26:31] they didn't see it taking place but the
[1:26:33] sounding let them know the blood has
[1:26:37] been shed
[1:26:39] and this is personal for you
[1:26:42] what is it the blood had a voice within
[1:26:46] it that lets you know you're free you
[1:26:49] can go free
[1:26:51] you don't have to stay in bondage no
[1:26:53] more you're free
[1:26:56] i'll tell you jesus christ is the high
[1:26:58] priest riding through his children
[1:27:01] writing through his church proclaiming
[1:27:03] liberty
[1:27:06] amen this is why
[1:27:09] think of how
[1:27:10] when god would send a message
[1:27:13] notice whoever is ashamed of me and my
[1:27:15] words
[1:27:16] me and my words because he is the word
[1:27:20] he is the word
[1:27:23] notice he said you're ashamed of me
[1:27:26] i'll be ashamed of you there
[1:27:29] the word brings conviction deals with
[1:27:31] our life and it's drawing us into
[1:27:34] fellowship if we heed to it
[1:27:38] that's why there's no
[1:27:40] without the shedding of blood the bible
[1:27:42] says there's no remission of sins
[1:27:44] that's why we had to go back we must go
[1:27:47] back to god's plan back to the bible
[1:27:51] because there's just no other way that
[1:27:52] we can come to god that's the only
[1:27:54] grounds
[1:27:57] and
[1:27:58] yet when you consider the scriptures
[1:28:01] here
[1:28:03] many different ones
[1:28:06] come out of different backgrounds
[1:28:08] and we hear the blood talked about
[1:28:10] is that right
[1:28:12] if you went on sunday perhaps
[1:28:14] sat in a pentecostal church
[1:28:16] said in a baptist church
[1:28:18] they would talk about the blood
[1:28:21] but it shows
[1:28:23] they're not getting under the blood
[1:28:26] because when you get under the blood the
[1:28:28] life of the blood testifies there is
[1:28:32] fellowship
[1:28:33] are you hearing me they're not getting
[1:28:35] under the blood
[1:28:36] but there they are there is a
[1:28:38] ministering that's going on this listen
[1:28:40] to me now this is why when god has to
[1:28:43] send a message it's to get us back into
[1:28:47] the plan of his word
[1:28:50] that message has come not to elate our
[1:28:52] heads that message has come to reveal
[1:28:56] the pathway back home
[1:28:58] it's come to reveal this is the way back
[1:29:02] under the blood
[1:29:03] this is the way back to fellowship
[1:29:07] oh my
[1:29:08] psalm 16 11
[1:29:10] thou wilt show me the path of life and
[1:29:14] in thy presence is fullness of joy at
[1:29:17] thy right hand there are pleasures
[1:29:21] forevermore
[1:29:23] so everywhere that we know
[1:29:26] there had to be
[1:29:28] that shedding of the blood on calvary
[1:29:31] and the pathway david prophesying here
[1:29:34] thou wilt show me the path of life
[1:29:37] and in that presence is fullness of joy
[1:29:40] notice david never came to that place
[1:29:43] david had a lot of joy but he had joy
[1:29:46] according to what god had made known
[1:29:48] through the law but fullness of joy is
[1:29:50] that joy that jesus christ delivered to
[1:29:54] the church of the living god and he said
[1:29:56] the joy that i give you
[1:29:59] the world can give it to you and the
[1:30:01] world can't take it away it's a fullness
[1:30:04] of joy
[1:30:06] at his right hand
[1:30:08] in resting in his power in his strength
[1:30:11] there are pleasures forevermore
[1:30:14] this path
[1:30:16] let me just kind of just take a few
[1:30:18] moments and just kind of drag my feet
[1:30:20] here on this
[1:30:22] each of the seven ages
[1:30:25] have their dip
[1:30:26] in the spirit of god
[1:30:29] their stripe of blood remember the seven
[1:30:32] stripes of blood every age there's seven
[1:30:35] gentile ages
[1:30:37] they all came under in their age under
[1:30:39] the fellowship of the lord jesus through
[1:30:42] the blood that was revealed to them
[1:30:46] are you hearing me this is upon my bond
[1:30:49] this rock i will build my church
[1:30:52] now
[1:30:53] yet in this hour that you and i are
[1:30:56] living in
[1:30:57] this is the hour where it would be the
[1:30:59] fullness
[1:31:01] of the holy spirit visiting the church
[1:31:04] as we've been just declaring over and
[1:31:06] over in that of the son of man it's
[1:31:09] where christ himself comes in his
[1:31:11] fullness and notice what did he do he
[1:31:14] made himself known through the ministry
[1:31:17] of malachi 4 for the purpose
[1:31:20] that we would recognize it's him that's
[1:31:24] our bridegroom
[1:31:25] not brother branham but christ is our
[1:31:28] bridegroom
[1:31:30] and that there's a uniting with him
[1:31:33] to where the two are no longer twain but
[1:31:36] they're one
[1:31:38] the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:31:44] hallelujah
[1:31:45] is where god has entered in to his
[1:31:48] temple
[1:31:50] this is an hour of that fullness that's
[1:31:53] what separates this message
[1:31:55] because it's an hour of an ending of
[1:31:58] gentile dispensations it's a time where
[1:32:01] sons of god the bible says the earth is
[1:32:03] groaning and travailing for the
[1:32:04] manifestation of the sons of god this is
[1:32:07] the hour
[1:32:08] to where sons and daughters of god come
[1:32:11] fully under the blood of jesus christ
[1:32:17] to where there's no liens against us
[1:32:20] are you hearing me
[1:32:22] you see no other age could take the
[1:32:24] rapture
[1:32:25] but god in this age sent a message
[1:32:28] and that message was come under the
[1:32:31] blood
[1:32:32] that message is the true sayings of god
[1:32:35] it deals with our life to bring us to a
[1:32:37] place to where we are free
[1:32:40] from the holds of this world
[1:32:43] satan had a lien on the church before he
[1:32:45] could say you can't go in the rapture
[1:32:46] because you got my baptism
[1:32:49] a lot of other liens there were liens
[1:32:53] leans
[1:32:54] doctrines of devils that were there
[1:32:56] things that weren't straightened out but
[1:32:59] in this hour god himself he is the
[1:33:02] abstract
[1:33:05] he
[1:33:06] is the breach
[1:33:08] [Applause]
[1:33:09] he's the one that stands there and ties
[1:33:13] us back in to a full
[1:33:16] life as a son and daughter of god that's
[1:33:19] what the holy ghost does
[1:33:22] coming under the blood
[1:33:27] this is evening time
[1:33:29] ephesians 5. let me read this quickly
[1:33:34] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:33:37] even as christ is the head of the church
[1:33:40] and he
[1:33:42] is the savior
[1:33:43] of the body
[1:33:45] therefore as the church
[1:33:48] is subject unto christ so let the wives
[1:33:51] be to their own husbands in everything
[1:33:54] speaking of surrendering
[1:33:56] of surrendering
[1:33:59] husbands love your wives
[1:34:01] even as christ also loved the church
[1:34:05] and gave himself
[1:34:07] for it now think back to that
[1:34:10] red heifer think back to that offering
[1:34:12] up brother aaron to where we could enter
[1:34:13] in to fellowship
[1:34:15] god provided
[1:34:17] god provided for himself
[1:34:20] a sacrifice
[1:34:22] god provided so that you and i could
[1:34:25] come back in brother carlos to a full
[1:34:27] fellowship he gave himself
[1:34:31] no other blood could do it
[1:34:34] every other blood was polluted
[1:34:37] good beings stood down through time but
[1:34:39] everyone those bloods was sexual born
[1:34:42] blood
[1:34:43] but this had to be a virgin born blood
[1:34:47] why a blood that was free from that of
[1:34:50] man but it was the creative blood of
[1:34:53] almighty god where god himself wrapped
[1:34:57] himself in the blood cell created a
[1:35:00] blood cell that he might come down and
[1:35:02] pay the price and through the shedding
[1:35:05] of the blood
[1:35:06] make a way
[1:35:08] that we can come back in
[1:35:10] to full fellowship with him
[1:35:12] he gave himself for it that he might
[1:35:15] sanctify
[1:35:17] and cleanse it
[1:35:19] only he can do this
[1:35:20] a church can't do it a church will make
[1:35:23] you look like a church
[1:35:26] come on now go along with their beliefs
[1:35:28] but the word of god we're not it's not
[1:35:30] that that's not how it's supposed to be
[1:35:32] the word of god is alone what cleanses
[1:35:35] us and sanctifies us
[1:35:38] not the latter
[1:35:41] but the person
[1:35:43] of the word himself
[1:35:46] is what sanctifies and cleanses us with
[1:35:49] the washing
[1:35:50] of water by the word
[1:35:54] that he might present it to himself
[1:35:57] a glorious church
[1:36:01] not having spot
[1:36:03] or wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:36:05] should be holy
[1:36:06] and without blemish
[1:36:09] only under the blood
[1:36:12] is this produced
[1:36:14] this
[1:36:15] is a result of the word let me just kind
[1:36:18] of just just just coast a few moments
[1:36:20] here
[1:36:22] this is the result of the word itself
[1:36:25] becoming blood for you and i
[1:36:30] that the word itself might become blood
[1:36:33] in order to wash you and i in what was
[1:36:38] in that blood
[1:36:40] it was the life that was within the
[1:36:42] blood
[1:36:43] and that life goes forth to bring
[1:36:46] cleansing in our life
[1:36:48] so when the holy spirit as he comes and
[1:36:50] he's dealing with our life that is the
[1:36:53] blood of jesus christ
[1:36:56] coming personally to our lives
[1:36:59] it's an announcement the blood has been
[1:37:02] shed and you are included in it
[1:37:05] it's calling us into fellowship
[1:37:09] you see it's the word that separates us
[1:37:12] from our unbelief
[1:37:14] it's nothing else but the word of god
[1:37:17] and i want you to think of this
[1:37:20] brother rabbit says it like this and
[1:37:22] things that ought to be
[1:37:24] and i'm coming down here
[1:37:27] he says think of it in my father's house
[1:37:30] i'll go and prepare a place for you that
[1:37:33] take you out of this pest house and
[1:37:35] deliver you into my father's house
[1:37:38] there you are
[1:37:39] take you out of this old earthly pest
[1:37:41] house this old earthly pesticide
[1:37:45] he's gone to prepare
[1:37:47] a place
[1:37:48] a perfect place where no evil exists
[1:37:52] no sickness exists no old age exists no
[1:37:55] death exists
[1:37:57] let me say
[1:37:59] that same perfection that we're going to
[1:38:03] it's reflected
[1:38:05] when the new birth has come
[1:38:08] because in the soul
[1:38:10] there's no evil
[1:38:14] it's a perfect cleansing
[1:38:19] this is what that perfection does when
[1:38:21] it says in his word be there for perfect
[1:38:23] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[1:38:26] god provides
[1:38:28] what was needed that perfection and
[1:38:31] there's no other perfection
[1:38:33] but his own life
[1:38:35] to bring you an eye
[1:38:37] completely
[1:38:38] under the blood
[1:38:40] ram says it like this it's a perfect
[1:38:41] place calling you to that perfection and
[1:38:44] you have to be perfect to get there
[1:38:46] and he quotes that scripture be you
[1:38:48] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:38:49] heaven is perfect it's a perfect kingdom
[1:38:52] so it must be a perfect people come
[1:38:54] because you have to stand and be married
[1:38:56] to a perfect son of god and you must be
[1:38:58] a perfect bride
[1:39:01] he's not talking about being perfect in
[1:39:02] ourselves
[1:39:04] because remember we could lick our spots
[1:39:06] and they just stand out more
[1:39:08] that's all he's talking about it's
[1:39:10] accepting
[1:39:12] what he's provided
[1:39:15] he said so how can you do it
[1:39:17] through anything else but the perfect
[1:39:20] word of god which is the waters of
[1:39:22] separation that washes us from our sins
[1:39:26] the blood of jesus christ think of it
[1:39:29] the dripping bloody word the blood the
[1:39:32] word of god bleeding to wash the bride
[1:39:35] in now she stands perfect virgin
[1:39:38] unadulterated she never sinned in the
[1:39:42] first place
[1:39:43] where is the first place in the mind of
[1:39:46] god
[1:39:49] see how perfect this blood is this blood
[1:39:53] just doesn't clean us out but this blood
[1:39:55] moves us to a place to where there's a
[1:39:57] complete death
[1:40:00] and the life quickens that seed and
[1:40:03] there's a new creation in christ
[1:40:06] jesus it raises up a new creation in the
[1:40:10] under the perfection and in the
[1:40:12] perfection of his life to where our
[1:40:14] desires
[1:40:15] are stayed on him
[1:40:20] are we perfect no we're not perfect
[1:40:24] but we have
[1:40:25] a water of separation
[1:40:28] where we are washed
[1:40:30] washing with the waters of the word not
[1:40:33] washed washing with waters of the word
[1:40:37] because there's a washing that's going
[1:40:38] on
[1:40:41] remember
[1:40:42] once your soul's been washed your soul
[1:40:44] don't have to be washed again
[1:40:47] right
[1:40:48] jesus when he came to peter and he spoke
[1:40:50] there and peter's like oh no lord you're
[1:40:52] not going to do that no no no not for me
[1:40:54] you're not going to wash my feet jesus
[1:40:55] said if i don't wash you
[1:40:57] you don't have no part with me
[1:41:00] see he's applying it to the to the
[1:41:01] spiritual part if i don't wash you
[1:41:04] you're not a part of me
[1:41:06] so there has to come a washing and he
[1:41:08] says that man need not wash save his
[1:41:12] hands and feet only
[1:41:15] once your soul has been washed by the
[1:41:18] blood of the lamb
[1:41:21] then there's a washing there you can
[1:41:23] wash your doings and your goings things
[1:41:26] that you come in contact are mistakes
[1:41:28] and so forth there is a washing of water
[1:41:32] by the word that we can stay in
[1:41:35] fellowship with him
[1:41:39] oh my
[1:41:41] oh brother samuel aren't you afraid
[1:41:43] that'll produce a loose life not at all
[1:41:44] that's the gospel
[1:41:47] that's the gospel
[1:41:48] that's a liberty that belongs to us as
[1:41:51] sons and daughters of god brother
[1:41:52] branham gave a strict strict message and
[1:41:54] believeth thou this he says don't you
[1:41:56] try to perfect this you'll never do it
[1:41:59] but you give must get that this
[1:42:01] perfected on the inside and when that
[1:42:03] perfected perfection has come then
[1:42:05] you've got authority to bring this outer
[1:42:08] man in subjection to the word
[1:42:10] and the brother bram goes on to say
[1:42:12] it'll be a constant war a constant
[1:42:14] battle but greater
[1:42:16] is he
[1:42:18] that is in you than he that's in the
[1:42:20] world
[1:42:24] i want you to think of this
[1:42:27] how in this time
[1:42:29] that we're living in the announcement
[1:42:31] could come
[1:42:34] brother branham would look at that of
[1:42:38] the third pool the little room
[1:42:41] and that isn't something speaking out
[1:42:42] here we're gonna go
[1:42:44] right here
[1:42:45] coming into the very soul of man
[1:42:48] because man is god's place of rest
[1:42:53] see this message would go clear to the
[1:42:55] very depths in our life bring us fully
[1:42:58] under the blood like it was back on the
[1:43:01] day of pentecost
[1:43:05] that's the restoring back that's the
[1:43:07] that's the omega bride being restored
[1:43:09] back to the alpha bright
[1:43:14] think of this announcement
[1:43:15] when thou prayest
[1:43:17] enter into the closet you know what that
[1:43:19] says there's an entrance ministered unto
[1:43:21] you
[1:43:22] there's a place where
[1:43:24] it's ministered unto you where you can
[1:43:26] enter into that secret place with god
[1:43:29] you're not stumbling and staggering
[1:43:30] around
[1:43:32] you you you don't have a waters of
[1:43:34] separation preached to you it says
[1:43:35] that's okay to cut your hair it's okay
[1:43:37] to do this it's okay to do that because
[1:43:39] that's not a waters of separation
[1:43:41] that just produces church members
[1:43:44] but there's a water of separation that
[1:43:46] brings conviction
[1:43:48] deals with the life to really do what
[1:43:50] bring us under the blood
[1:43:53] and fellowship with god
[1:43:56] think of this
[1:43:58] that god would have
[1:44:02] think of the purpose
[1:44:03] of this message that god has sent to us
[1:44:07] every age god would speak to one person
[1:44:10] he that hath an ear
[1:44:13] let him hear
[1:44:14] god would speak to one person
[1:44:17] then from that person
[1:44:18] then from that messenger he would go out
[1:44:20] to others
[1:44:23] that would come
[1:44:24] that would come under that light
[1:44:27] that would come under the headship of
[1:44:29] that word
[1:44:31] are you hearing me
[1:44:33] tells us their people it was seen every
[1:44:35] age he said some he said that they come
[1:44:38] around it he said but then he says
[1:44:40] they'll put their own interpretation to
[1:44:42] it and they go off into sin
[1:44:48] but it's to say
[1:44:50] what's been said
[1:44:56] you see you see because
[1:44:58] we're not talking about the mind of a
[1:44:59] man
[1:45:01] this is not the mind of william brown
[1:45:03] grunt took a seven a man who didn't even
[1:45:05] complete seventh grade
[1:45:06] and i'm not saying you gotta have a high
[1:45:08] school diploma to be smart that's not
[1:45:10] what i'm saying
[1:45:11] are you hearing me because i don't
[1:45:13] believe that i don't believe you gotta
[1:45:14] have to be a smart person
[1:45:16] but notice god showed you and i that it
[1:45:19] was not something of the intellect of
[1:45:22] man that he was coming to
[1:45:25] god took a vessel that will surrender
[1:45:29] that he could speak his life through and
[1:45:32] it would be manifested night after night
[1:45:35] after night on the platform
[1:45:38] just stay with me just just a minute
[1:45:40] here because it's coming on down to an
[1:45:42] example because when god would give that
[1:45:44] then that same light would go forth what
[1:45:46] was it it was a message of calling the
[1:45:49] children of god to come under the blood
[1:45:52] when paul could speak of timothy and he
[1:45:55] could say i have no other one
[1:45:57] like-minded meaning equal in soul he
[1:46:00] would be with those who would that were
[1:46:02] message than revelation had so struck in
[1:46:04] their heart to call the people under the
[1:46:07] blood
[1:46:08] notice then
[1:46:11] that speaks where god would reveal
[1:46:13] himself to one person
[1:46:16] keep
[1:46:17] the ashes
[1:46:19] of the red heifer of the red heifer up
[1:46:22] in a clean place
[1:46:24] and it must be a clean man
[1:46:28] god man can't cleanse himself
[1:46:31] but god cleanses us by his word
[1:46:35] and god sets a man aside the bible says
[1:46:37] that holy that the prophets of all holy
[1:46:40] men of god that were set aside and moved
[1:46:43] upon by the holy ghost
[1:46:45] it's god who called them aside they
[1:46:47] didn't even know what they were saying
[1:46:53] they were set aside
[1:46:55] to be a spokesman for god
[1:46:57] let me say this to you
[1:46:59] here god would have a vessel
[1:47:01] a life that that waters of separation
[1:47:05] that the mystery of god as we were
[1:47:07] speaking on last week could be kept in a
[1:47:09] clean heart why because it's calling us
[1:47:12] to cleanliness to a cleansing under the
[1:47:16] blood of jesus christ so god not a
[1:47:18] message that's attached to a
[1:47:20] denomination not a message that's
[1:47:22] attached to an idea not a message that
[1:47:25] man has his thumb over and man says well
[1:47:27] brother brown said this here brother man
[1:47:28] no but in a clean place
[1:47:32] a clean place
[1:47:34] so that it reduces what cleanliness it
[1:47:37] produces the life of jesus christ
[1:47:42] i'm thankful for that
[1:47:45] because that clean place
[1:47:48] notice
[1:47:49] among a clean
[1:47:51] congregation
[1:47:53] where the washing of water by the word
[1:47:55] it brings forth liberty
[1:47:58] but we know where we stand
[1:48:01] we're washed in it
[1:48:04] we're not wondering
[1:48:06] we've come under the blood
[1:48:09] we're not walking in darkness
[1:48:12] we're not walking under the ideas of man
[1:48:15] but we are in fellowship
[1:48:18] with almighty god
[1:48:21] we have met him
[1:48:24] we have come in contact with him
[1:48:27] we've been united with jesus christ
[1:48:30] the relationship with him where he
[1:48:33] speaks lip to ear to you and i
[1:48:36] in the bible oh oh if i could put this
[1:48:38] together no it ain't about all of that
[1:48:39] right there remember we just lay in the
[1:48:42] word and he unfolds
[1:48:45] these things
[1:48:49] but god sends his word
[1:48:52] to call us
[1:48:54] into full
[1:48:56] fellowship
[1:48:57] with him aren't you glad for that
[1:49:01] and i just say that's that's that's the
[1:49:03] invitation that for every life
[1:49:06] i'm finished
[1:49:07] i just stop
[1:49:10] that's the call for every every life
[1:49:12] every heart
[1:49:13] is to come fully under the blood
[1:49:16] that's the call
[1:49:18] that's the it's open the way is open
[1:49:22] it's been made clear before us
[1:49:26] you see we're not just we're not talking
[1:49:27] we're not just talking about the blood
[1:49:30] but he
[1:49:31] who created that blood cell
[1:49:34] is right here among us
[1:49:38] because of life under the blood it
[1:49:40] reflects
[1:49:42] it's a life under the blood
[1:49:44] where all things are settled
[1:49:47] where there's rest
[1:49:48] and peace
[1:49:49] in him
[1:49:51] and it's a reflection
[1:49:53] of his own
[1:49:55] oh my god life bare our hands
[1:49:58] i say tonight if
[1:50:01] if any
[1:50:02] did not come to that place
[1:50:05] don't take anything for granted
[1:50:08] but just fully
[1:50:10] fully
[1:50:11] fully
[1:50:13] just deliver yourself over
[1:50:15] into his hands
[1:50:18] just let god just
[1:50:20] just come in just such a special way you
[1:50:22] say brother samuel this was a thursday
[1:50:24] night
[1:50:25] well god doesn't make any difference
[1:50:27] between thursday night or sundays
[1:50:30] i'll tell you in the preparation of
[1:50:32] things i don't there's no difference in
[1:50:33] the preparation that he directs me for
[1:50:36] thursday night than he does for sunday
[1:50:38] he's the same god
[1:50:41] he's very he's very personal
[1:50:44] and god is so mindful
[1:50:47] of every
[1:50:49] single
[1:50:50] need
[1:50:54] let's just approach him in prayer
[1:51:01] before i pray brother branham is
[1:51:03] speaking to a group of people
[1:51:07] he says lord here's boys and girls men
[1:51:10] and women that are standing with humble
[1:51:11] hearts
[1:51:13] in confession confession and their
[1:51:15] wanting to enter into this glory
[1:51:17] and find
[1:51:18] peace eternal
[1:51:21] they're standing as testimonies tonight
[1:51:23] and you said he that will witness me
[1:51:25] before men i'll witness before my father
[1:51:26] and for the holy angels
[1:51:29] you're ashamed of me and my gospel i'll
[1:51:30] be ashamed of you at that day before my
[1:51:32] father and his holy angels
[1:51:34] men and men and women boys and girls he
[1:51:36] said that has laid aside
[1:51:38] their shameness
[1:51:41] they've come in
[1:51:43] the bedroom of fellowship and
[1:51:44] relationship and they're pleading for
[1:51:46] the shekinah glory to fall upon their
[1:51:47] souls
[1:51:48] to change them
[1:51:50] make them new creatures
[1:51:52] i say tonight is every head and every
[1:51:54] heart is bound
[1:52:00] if there's one here

[1:52:44] of the innocent one that was shed for
[1:52:47] you
[1:52:49] that's where you focus
[1:52:51] because you can never make yourself
[1:52:53] worthy
[1:52:54] he
[1:52:54] is the worthy one
[1:52:57] he's the one
[1:52:58] who makes us worthy

[1:53:30] there's hearts right here among us that
[1:53:32] where we've crossed into that place of
[1:53:34] fellowship with god
[1:53:38] but there's just a longing within our
[1:53:40] hearts
[1:53:42] a desire
[1:53:44] we want to please him
[1:53:47] and that word as it comes forth to wash
[1:53:49] us

[1:53:53] there's a cleansing that takes place
[1:53:56] it's god moving right down in our midst

[1:53:59] maybe things that we could overlook
[1:54:02] that god would say i
[1:54:04] let's let's take care of this
[1:54:08] may as you rub shoulders with the world
[1:54:10] sometimes you rub shoulders with the
[1:54:11] world and the things of it
[1:54:13] and not that you've even done anything
[1:54:16] but you just feel
[1:54:17] you just feel so out of place
[1:54:20] there's a washing
[1:54:21] of water by the word
[1:54:23] it doesn't mean that you're a sinner
[1:54:25] once you've already crossed behind that
[1:54:26] veil what your desire is to stay in
[1:54:29] fellowship with him but there's a
[1:54:31] washing of water by the word
[1:54:34] that washes you

[1:54:56] washing of water by the word that goes
[1:54:58] down if there's something that's out of
[1:55:00] place
[1:55:02] in our life
[1:55:03] maybe it's an attitude maybe it's a
[1:55:05] grudge maybe whatever we want to stand
