[0:00] he ties it into the mission fields he
[0:02] ties it in into witnessing he ties it
[0:04] into where we are supporting the work of
[0:07] the lord so it's something to be
[0:09] invested because let's just be honest
[0:11] we're going to be invested in something
[0:14] and any you you we can't hide what we're
[0:17] invested in it'll come forth because
[0:20] everybody's dedicated
[0:22] right everybody's dedicated
[0:24] you know just as much as you've had
[0:26] people that's dedicated to work you've
[0:28] got people dedicated to find ways not to
[0:30] work
[0:33] truth is truth
[0:34] right
[0:36] so everybody there's dedication and what
[0:38] it is is what is what is and you say
[0:40] well how do i know what i'm dedicated to
[0:43] what is it whatever you're dedicated to
[0:45] and what is preeminent you will not
[0:48] allow compromise in that area of your
[0:49] life
[0:51] it might be your children
[0:54] but i'll go to church but whatever it is
[0:56] that you will say nope i draw the line
[0:58] right here
[0:59] but reality in all those things what it
[1:02] should be is the preeminence in our life
[1:05] is the lord jesus christ
[1:07] because when he's the preeminent one
[1:09] he's the one that gives the influence
[1:12] over the lives of our homes it's him
[1:14] that even when we can't say anything to
[1:17] the boss or or to this one but it's his
[1:20] influence in our life that god will give
[1:23] favor and bring us into favor in the
[1:26] sight of man god will direct our lives
[1:29] and we can have confidence within that
[1:32] oh glory be to god we we thank god to be
[1:35] invested in the work of the lord we
[1:37] thank god to recognize our day of
[1:39] visitation and the message we recognize
[1:42] that this visitation that god has
[1:45] promised in his word in this hour it was
[1:48] not just another man with a gift this
[1:51] was a prophetic gift that was prophesied
[1:54] in the scriptures in this hour just as
[1:57] much as the lord jesus himself was here
[2:00] in redemption god promised he would send
[2:02] a message that would redeem the bride
[2:05] draw her out of denominational
[2:08] and place a real uniting with jesus
[2:11] christ god has kept his promise and what
[2:14] a privilege it is to recognize our day
[2:17] and its message that we're not just
[2:19] fellowshipping around what god did our
[2:22] fellowship is not just looking at the
[2:25] prophet but our fellowship is what god
[2:28] was in the prophet and what god
[2:30] manifested that same god is present
[2:33] right here in our lives and we are
[2:36] invited to have the same experience to
[2:39] have the token applied to our lives
[2:42] just as the coming of the lord jesus
[2:44] pointed the children of god to the upper
[2:47] room that they must be united with him
[2:52] it's a privilege to be united with the
[2:54] living god by the new birth
[2:57] hallelujah it's a privilege that our
[2:59] understanding has been opened
[3:02] that we recognize that just accepting
[3:04] jesus christ as our savior we're not
[3:06] born again just by that
[3:08] that's part of the way
[3:10] what a privilege it is that god would
[3:12] say in this hour and confirm he has made
[3:15] known to us the path of righteousness
[3:18] the path of life because it's god's
[3:20] desire not man's desire but god's desire
[3:24] because even when god would make this
[3:26] known and reveal it man would pull back
[3:29] and man would say well this is what our
[3:31] church teaches this is what our church
[3:33] teaches but if the church teaches
[3:36] something different from the word it's
[3:39] not a gateway to heaven it's a gate of
[3:42] hell
[3:44] come on friends the bible said many
[3:47] powerful men in the book of proverbs
[3:49] have went into her gates and it said her
[3:52] stares are the stairway to hell
[3:56] is that right
[3:57] oh my it's where a relationship is
[4:00] between
[4:01] god and his people the surrendering of
[4:04] our lives oh my way and a privilege that
[4:07] we can support the cause with our
[4:09] attendance ties and offerings and all
[4:12] that he would ask us to do we want to
[4:14] have the same kind of testimony as the
[4:16] queen of sheba had
[4:19] are you with me the queen of sheba she
[4:21] went ready she heard what was going on
[4:24] and how the bible records she went there
[4:27] her camel's was was filled there with
[4:30] with riches with an offering to give if
[4:32] she saw that what she had heard about
[4:35] that god was present there and making
[4:38] himself real through the life of a man
[4:41] she was ready to support it when she saw
[4:44] it she didn't only see it in solomon she
[4:47] seen the effect of that gift and lives
[4:50] that were rallied around that gift
[4:52] remember the real gift is the holy ghost
[4:55] in this hour
[4:56] are you hearing me now when she saw she
[4:59] said even how the servants put the meat
[5:02] on the table even how solomon ascended
[5:05] up to the house of god she watched the
[5:09] character
[5:10] that actually was exhibited through the
[5:13] lives of the household and she said
[5:15] there was no spirit
[5:17] left within me
[5:19] she recognized you see the effect of the
[5:23] gift of god that it had and she was
[5:26] ready
[5:27] ready to support it
[5:29] so when we look at this and think of it
[5:31] in the scripture because you know as god
[5:34] wrote it here with ties and offerings
[5:38] they're not the same thing
[5:40] they're two different things
[5:41] and god wrote him that way
[5:43] he wrote and he spoke to israel in that
[5:46] way and he would speak of how that they
[5:48] were to return and have things because
[5:50] remember the tithes and offerings
[5:52] themselves they could have given their
[5:54] tithes and their offerings and they
[5:55] still wouldn't have been fully returned
[5:57] to god but god was speaking of and you
[6:00] realize in this chapter and other places
[6:02] in haggai it was their heart that had
[6:05] gone away from god
[6:07] their heart got turned and they began to
[6:10] be invested in other things of life and
[6:12] once you start investing in other things
[6:14] of life you begin to lose sight of other
[6:17] things and god is speaking to their
[6:19] heart
[6:20] because wherever your heart is and heart
[6:23] is directed your life will follow
[6:27] is that right
[6:28] so now notice how god would make such a
[6:31] distinct difference
[6:33] you see
[6:34] each of them had to do
[6:36] with the work of the lord in the house
[6:38] of the lord you know brother branham was
[6:40] asked a question
[6:41] would it be wrong
[6:43] to use ties on church building funds
[6:45] and i know i've had i've had
[6:48] i've had things not here but i've had
[6:50] you know different ones and ministers
[6:52] and different ones call me and you know
[6:54] and ask you know a take or something
[6:56] because sometimes you know in this in
[6:58] this day and age and i hate to say it
[7:00] this way but sometimes people become so
[7:02] dogmatic on things
[7:04] i've just got to say it
[7:06] become so locked up instead of really
[7:08] recognizing what's behind the quote
[7:10] anybody can quote a quote
[7:12] but there's one thing about this message
[7:14] and i'll get to as we get further on in
[7:16] here that this message brought us to
[7:18] was to discern the motive and the spirit
[7:21] behind everything
[7:24] you say what do you say i'm saying that
[7:25] where there's been people that would
[7:26] leave churches because a pastor would
[7:28] take from the tithing and put into the
[7:30] building fund i'll just say it this way
[7:32] they really weren't locked in the right
[7:34] way the way they should have been
[7:37] because when we're locked in the right
[7:39] way our focus is on jesus christ
[7:43] we're all we're going to make decisions
[7:44] we might disappoint one another but if
[7:47] our focus is on jesus christ just like
[7:50] it should be in our homes
[7:52] among our family then no matter when we
[7:54] would disappoint we may not agree but
[7:56] our focus still stays on christ who is
[7:59] the absolute
[8:02] we should not be looking about dividing
[8:04] we should be in the spirit of uniting
[8:06] with the word
[8:08] so you know brother graham he puts that
[8:10] separate he lets it be known uh the the
[8:13] separate within this and i'm just going
[8:14] to refer to a few places i i didn't post
[8:17] this quote but he says you know how the
[8:19] tithings that goes to the the pastors
[8:21] and so forth and he says but he says and
[8:23] he talks about how he said well people
[8:24] would take you no money and he said
[8:27] they'll take their ties and give them to
[8:28] a widow woman well that's wrong if
[8:30] you've got anything to give the widow
[8:31] woman you give her but don't give her
[8:34] god's money that's not yours in the
[8:36] first place that's god's if you sent me
[8:39] downtown look how simple he puts it you
[8:41] sent me downtown to get a loaf of bread
[8:42] and you give me 25 cents to get the loaf
[8:44] of bread and i met somebody on the
[8:46] street and they wanted something else
[8:48] and i'd give them the 25 cents i've give
[8:51] them your money if they ask me for
[8:53] something let me get over here in the
[8:55] other pocket and give them money because
[8:57] a tenth is the lord's and levi the
[9:00] priest could live on the tenth now
[9:02] brother battle says that that tithing
[9:03] goes into the church for the pastor he
[9:05] said but the building funds and the
[9:07] things are separate fun all together
[9:10] so the ties themselves uh you know i
[9:13] never forget i had a co-worker one time
[9:15] she asked you know sometimes you
[9:17] i guess it i don't want to call it
[9:19] privileges or what but you get asked you
[9:20] know a question you know knowing you're
[9:22] a minister and said hey i want to ask
[9:24] you a question i you know i i had some
[9:27] ties and and what i did was is my
[9:29] ex-husband you know i i gave him those
[9:31] ties what do you think about that
[9:35] there's some questions you get as a
[9:36] minister you think why did i get there
[9:40] i just i so what did you say well i told
[9:42] her you know see just a sweet lady and i
[9:45] told her i said well you know i said
[9:47] what the scripture says i said is that
[9:48] goes into the storehouse i said where
[9:50] you get your food
[9:52] i said so you given it to that to your
[9:54] ex-husband or whatever more i said god
[9:56] don't recognize that you took what
[9:58] belonged to god and you gave it to them
[10:02] oh my sometimes it's really easy to
[10:05] speak truth and other times it's just
[10:06] your feet your toes are crawling up in
[10:08] you you know
[10:10] because
[10:11] you know how we all deal with things or
[10:12] thoughts and things like that but notice
[10:14] we see how god separated the ties and
[10:16] the offerings and how that the tithes
[10:19] are to support that ministry that is
[10:20] laboring on behalf of the lord given to
[10:23] study in order to minister the word of
[10:25] the lord whereby the sheep of god are
[10:28] led by the holy spirit coming through
[10:29] the word of god and the offerings are to
[10:32] support the work of the lord the local
[10:34] assembly in maintenance of the
[10:36] facilities utilities and upkeep also the
[10:39] building fund is as well as offerings
[10:41] designated for missions missionaries and
[10:43] mission work and love offerings so god
[10:46] has an ordained way
[10:49] i'm not going to read this and this this
[10:51] quote to you but i'll refer to it it's
[10:52] very similar to the ones that we were
[10:55] reading last week
[10:56] god has already a provided way
[11:00] god has a provided way just like for a
[11:03] man to come into christ it's not by
[11:06] hand's sake
[11:08] it's by one spirit we are baptized into
[11:12] one body
[11:13] repent and be baptized in the name of
[11:15] jesus christ for the remission of your
[11:17] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[11:20] the holy ghost it's not a church book a
[11:22] church book has no virtue in it
[11:24] so all of these things that we see
[11:27] and brother branham would lay this
[11:28] downhill with theology and teaching and
[11:31] they tried to you know tell a man this
[11:33] and tell a man that and everything is
[11:35] theology and brethren said we've got to
[11:37] come back to god's way now how he's
[11:39] placing all this god's way that god he
[11:42] said has a way to support the church
[11:43] it's not through uh you know blanket
[11:45] selling and pies selling and soup
[11:48] suppers but god already had a provided
[11:51] way
[11:52] and we can come back to god's way and
[11:55] and really in everything in our lives
[11:57] and evaluating it then everything will
[12:00] operate according to god's provided way
[12:03] for that
[12:04] i'm glad that god makes known his
[12:07] provided way aren't you
[12:09] amen because you know there's no doubt
[12:11] about it you know you can have people
[12:14] that you come in contact with and and
[12:16] you know when they start talking about
[12:18] coming to church the thing that stands
[12:20] out to them is man you how in the world
[12:22] you do this
[12:23] you got to give a tenth of your income
[12:26] my goodness
[12:29] to think
[12:30] listen to me now to think that that
[12:32] would be one thing that would stop
[12:34] people from giving their life to the
[12:35] lord
[12:37] it ain't about to recognize that the
[12:39] money that even that we have remember as
[12:41] we looked at it last week the earth is
[12:43] the lords and the fullness thereof
[12:46] we have not done this on our own god has
[12:49] given us the skills and the strengths
[12:51] that we have
[12:52] i mean you could take me out to the
[12:54] range a month of sundays and let me
[12:57] shoot and zero in i can tell you right
[12:59] now i'll never be able to shoot like
[13:01] brother joey shoots you might say
[13:02] brother simon you're selling yourself
[13:04] short well i don't think so i i know
[13:06] better than that sometimes my hand gets
[13:08] a little bit shaky but you see there are
[13:10] skills that god has placed within our
[13:14] lives
[13:16] just like when they wanted to tell me as
[13:18] a teacher well you need to teach them
[13:19] math this way and teach them math that
[13:21] way or you know sending me off to look
[13:23] at that i said hold on a second
[13:26] you're wanting me to take teach
[13:28] everybody as though everybody has an
[13:30] engineering mind everybody don't have an
[13:32] engineering mind we're interested that
[13:35] they grab a hold of the concept if
[13:37] that's there within them it will come
[13:39] out in the other framework of classes in
[13:43] high school and college
[13:46] is that right god has placed us here in
[13:48] earth not with something well god didn't
[13:51] give me anything to take care of myself
[13:52] he's jehovah jireh amen
[13:55] when god gave the vision to moses there
[13:58] remember in the midst of that vision he
[14:00] says by the way in order to bring this
[14:02] to pass i have filled men with the
[14:05] spirit of wisdom to bring it from the
[14:07] vision till it becomes manifest
[14:10] he's jehovah jireh now you and i have to
[14:12] come to that place to find out what is
[14:15] it that god that you have me to do
[14:19] and sometimes that can you know as you
[14:20] narrow down as young people that can be
[14:22] seemingly become a little bit scary now
[14:24] listen it doesn't mean for everybody
[14:26] that everybody's going to go to college
[14:28] my goodness
[14:31] samuel oh this don't seem very spiritual
[14:33] very deep no god's interested in every
[14:35] part
[14:36] god's interested in every part of our
[14:37] life sometimes there's things that we
[14:39] put so far off and well this internet
[14:41] and this and this and then we wonder why
[14:43] sometimes why isn't the church and why
[14:46] aren't lives moving on the way they
[14:48] should be
[14:49] sometime in our own lives
[14:51] sometimes the things that we look at and
[14:53] say oh that's insignificant let me tell
[14:55] you something brother branham didn't
[14:57] think these things were insignificant he
[14:59] spoke that how before in that quote i
[15:01] read you he said he spent weeks and
[15:04] months upon teaching the church tithes
[15:07] and offerings
[15:08] we don't have those recorded messages
[15:12] it was important
[15:14] so when we see this sometimes it's hard
[15:16] for us coming to the place of what god
[15:18] has for us and let me just say it to you
[15:20] like this if you're in college god never
[15:22] called you to be a career college
[15:23] student
[15:29] pastor's back
[15:32] god never called you no you say what do
[15:34] you mean brother simon i'm a witness
[15:36] i'm a witness when you just can ask god
[15:39] and put yourself before god god will
[15:42] speak to you whether it's through a
[15:44] teacher whether it's through a minister
[15:46] some way god will speak to your heart
[15:48] because god has placed that within you
[15:51] that he ignites it and brings it forth
[15:54] to serve his purpose
[15:57] that's why i said it's not just even in
[15:59] college uh even within trades and
[16:01] drywall and plumbing and painting and
[16:03] whatever more
[16:04] i'm appreciative of that
[16:08] i had to do a little bit of plumbing
[16:09] miner
[16:12] and it's other calling other people
[16:15] drywall
[16:17] drywall's an art well we're going to go
[16:18] on and preach here
[16:20] so the tithe is the 10 out of the income
[16:24] and the offering is what we willingly
[16:26] give of the 90 now think how god says in
[16:29] proverbs 3 9 honor the lord with thy
[16:32] substance and
[16:34] with the first fruits of all thine
[16:35] increase so shall thy barns
[16:39] be filled with mercedes
[16:43] now don't say that
[16:45] now i know smiley tooth texans teach
[16:47] that but that ain't what god said
[16:50] so shall thy barns be filled with plenty
[16:52] means enough
[16:56] that's what it means
[16:57] and thy presses shall burst out with new
[17:00] wine what god has said is the same way
[17:03] that he took care of the widow of zereth
[17:06] that put god first then god seemed that
[17:09] every one of her needs were met and she
[17:12] ate of thus saith the lord
[17:18] remember jesus won't be outdone he won't
[17:19] be in debt to nobody
[17:22] so think how god has so entrusted us
[17:25] with the substance and increase with
[17:27] complete understanding of our needs and
[17:29] he asked us to trust him and says proves
[17:32] me and that's to walk into every life of
[17:34] the believer is to walk in faith
[17:36] trusting completely in the lord you know
[17:38] this is one small way when we give of
[17:41] our times and our offering this is one
[17:43] small way that we are able to honor the
[17:45] lord
[17:46] this is one small way of recognizing his
[17:49] lordship
[17:51] his faithfulness remember when abraham
[17:53] came face to face there in the in in the
[17:57] kings dale and he comes there there's a
[17:59] lot of other kings
[18:01] but right there
[18:03] abraham recognizes melchizedek is
[18:06] greater than all of them
[18:10] and that's where we recognize the lord
[18:12] his presence working very personally
[18:15] even in our local church you see that's
[18:17] where and you know me by now some of you
[18:20] visitors don't know me but you know me
[18:21] by now i've never told anybody come here
[18:24] to church
[18:28] i've never done that as a matter of fact
[18:29] anybody's thinking about coming to
[18:31] church i don't go out to eat with them
[18:34] sorry
[18:35] why i don't want anybody nothing my
[18:37] personality be something you'd fall in
[18:38] love with but i don't want anybody here
[18:40] because we're to cater to this and cater
[18:42] to this if god leads you to come here
[18:44] that's what it has to be that there's a
[18:46] connection between you and god not a
[18:49] man's personality
[18:52] we don't need to be united with
[18:53] personalities as a matter of fact many
[18:56] personalities in the scripture brother
[18:58] branham even said regarding his own
[19:00] personality we're not united with the
[19:02] personality it's to hear the voice of
[19:06] god john said i turned to hear the voice
[19:10] see the voice that was speaking to me
[19:13] there must be a voice of god that speaks
[19:16] so personally to your life that you
[19:18] recognize it's god speaking personally
[19:21] it's god given a stewardship of my life
[19:24] he's ministering right down to the very
[19:27] strings and hearts of my life
[19:30] what grace how would we know even where
[19:32] to put our foot down
[19:37] i thank god for that
[19:41] oh glory be to god it was just like
[19:43] before god you know
[19:45] before i become pastor here didn't want
[19:47] to be pastor
[19:49] but i had brothers that set me down and
[19:51] they they told me i said you're wasting
[19:53] your time
[19:55] well brother samuel you can come here
[19:56] and you know
[19:58] we'll turn the church over i'm no
[20:00] i'm i'm where i belong
[20:03] they say how do you know that because
[20:05] you say brother samuel god can god can
[20:07] move things around like he did paul and
[20:09] barnabas i don't doubt that but i knew
[20:11] what the certainty where god had placed
[20:14] me and god wanted me to be here so no
[20:17] matter what came my way i knew this is
[20:20] where god wanted me to be
[20:27] this is why brother brahma talked about
[20:29] that one small way
[20:31] he says
[20:32] our heavenly father thou has taught us
[20:35] in the word that let every man lay aside
[20:36] that which god has prospered him that
[20:38] when the first day of the week when we
[20:40] come together that we should bring in
[20:42] our tithes and offerings into the place
[20:43] your house
[20:44] and we thank thee for the privilege that
[20:46] we have of worshiping thee
[20:49] in this manner which is such
[20:51] a little way
[20:53] second corinthians 9 7 says every man
[20:56] according as he hath purposed in his
[20:58] heart
[20:59] so let him give so this scripture
[21:02] it would speak
[21:04] there was a purposing in heart and this
[21:06] scripture really
[21:08] speaks in that of the offering where
[21:09] it's taking from
[21:11] the other 90 that god has entrusted to
[21:14] us and notice according as he had
[21:17] purposed in his heart this is something
[21:18] that's to be
[21:20] between
[21:21] us personally and god
[21:24] tithing is between you and god too
[21:27] right between me and god because we're
[21:29] all tithe players ministers included
[21:32] we're all in offering because we're all
[21:33] invested in this together
[21:36] is that right
[21:37] now so within this notice how the
[21:40] principal paul would pick this up
[21:42] not grudgingly
[21:45] or otherness or of necessity well i have
[21:47] to do this
[21:49] for god loveth a cheerful
[21:52] giver
[21:58] in other words don't look at it like
[21:59] you're paying your water bill
[22:02] or when your car breaks down
[22:05] is that all right
[22:08] sorry that'll help some of you loosen
[22:10] you up a little bit
[22:11] luke 6 38 give and it shall be given
[22:14] unto you good measure pressed down and
[22:17] shaken together running over shall men
[22:19] give into your bosom for with the same
[22:23] measure that you meet with all it shall
[22:25] be measured to you again
[22:28] brother branham i just um
[22:30] you know i remembered this from some you
[22:32] know a few years back or the times and
[22:34] you're getting ready to preach the
[22:35] message you must be born again and
[22:36] there's a need that has arose in the
[22:38] congregation and brother branham he
[22:40] turns and said brother neville would you
[22:41] mind taking up this offering
[22:44] and brother neville let me just read you
[22:46] i have it here in my quotes i'm just
[22:47] going to refer to this point here's what
[22:49] brother neville says brother neville
[22:51] says thank you brother branham oh i
[22:53] enjoy doing something this way because
[22:56] it is this that helps us to be more
[22:58] christ-like and spiritual sometimes
[23:01] people say i want you to pray for me
[23:03] that i'll be a better christian he said
[23:05] well i've prayed for you now i'm going
[23:07] to show you how to be one
[23:09] [Laughter]
[23:12] oh glory be to god
[23:15] oh my
[23:17] now in the offerings here let's just try
[23:19] to whittle this down here a little bit
[23:21] in exodus 25
[23:23] verse 1 the bible said the lord spake
[23:25] unto moses saying
[23:27] speak unto the children of israel that
[23:28] they bring me an offering notice bring
[23:31] me an offering
[23:33] of every man that giveth that willing
[23:35] with his heart willingly with his heart
[23:38] ye shall take
[23:40] my offering so it's unto the lord and
[23:43] this is the offering which you shall
[23:44] take of them gold silver brass verse 8
[23:47] and let them make me a sanctuary that i
[23:51] may dwell among them according to all
[23:54] that i show thee after the pattern of
[23:55] the tabernacle and the pattern of all
[23:58] the instruments thereof even so
[24:01] shall you make it
[24:02] and remember this is when moses here is
[24:04] caught up in the cloud
[24:07] and god is unfolding to him
[24:10] of that vision of the tabernacle you see
[24:12] god was was expressing
[24:15] to
[24:16] to moses
[24:18] his desire all along was to dwell among
[24:22] men now god could not come into man
[24:25] right now because
[24:27] there was nothing that could atone and
[24:30] take care of the sin condition
[24:33] right
[24:34] we see all this begins to be spoken
[24:36] where abraham has a desire for an heir
[24:39] and god lets him know somebody on the
[24:42] outside and elies are in different one
[24:44] that's not going to be your heir but one
[24:46] that will come forth from thine own
[24:49] loins shall be thine air see it was an
[24:52] expression of god and then that
[24:54] continues to move forward to the reality
[24:57] that god's desire his resting place and
[25:00] dwelling place would be in the very
[25:03] heart of his error of his children of
[25:07] his offspring we are the dwelling place
[25:11] of almighty god
[25:14] so all of this was speaking in tight but
[25:16] notice notice
[25:18] god said speak to them and let them
[25:20] bring
[25:22] me an offering
[25:24] see god's a gentleman
[25:26] it's just like in a person god doesn't
[25:29] god doesn't run around and pull us
[25:32] and threaten us but god pulls on the
[25:35] heart of an individual to surrender
[25:37] their own life
[25:39] is that right the bible said he that
[25:41] will keep his life shall lose it but he
[25:43] that will lose it for my sake shall find
[25:46] it
[25:47] right so it's entrusted god has
[25:49] entrusted us
[25:50] and with a choice a decision that you
[25:53] and i are called upon to make and notice
[25:57] let them make me a sanctuary that i may
[25:59] dwell among them now when you think of
[26:01] this
[26:03] look here in exodus 35 10 chapters later
[26:06] this is after remember after the golden
[26:08] calf and all this now is when moses can
[26:11] actually speak to the people they were
[26:14] in no condition for this vision to be
[26:17] made known to at that time
[26:20] because the golden calf sin was in the
[26:23] camp right
[26:25] so there were no condition for the
[26:27] vision to be spoken of
[26:30] i'm trying my best not to preach here
[26:33] this is why
[26:34] there must be a repentance first before
[26:39] the real vision and the unfolding of the
[26:41] word that real reality can begin to come
[26:44] there's got to be a repentance
[26:48] amen to be baptized in the name of the
[26:50] lord jesus christ then god can reveal
[26:54] his riches to you and i
[26:57] right there's an entrustment
[26:59] notice in verse 20 of exodus 35 and all
[27:02] the congregation of the children of
[27:03] israel departed from the presence of
[27:05] moses so he's making known to them the
[27:08] vision of the sanctuary
[27:10] and they came everyone whose heart
[27:14] stirred him up so who was it was it
[27:16] moses that stirred them up
[27:19] their heart
[27:20] how was their heart stirred by the
[27:22] vision
[27:23] supernatural vision god's desire being
[27:26] spoken through earthly lips touched
[27:29] their heart
[27:32] it stirred them up and everyone whom his
[27:35] spirit made willing and they brought the
[27:38] lord's offering
[27:39] to the work of the tabernacle of the
[27:41] congregation and for all his service and
[27:43] for the holy garments
[27:44] and they came both men and women as many
[27:46] as were willing hearted
[27:48] and he goes on to all that they brought
[27:50] and every man that offered offered an
[27:52] offering of gold unto the lord and every
[27:55] man look at this with whom was found
[27:59] it lays out everything
[28:02] everyone that did offer an offering of
[28:04] silver and brass and brought the lord's
[28:06] offering in verse 24 every man with whom
[28:09] was found
[28:10] verse 27
[28:12] and the rulers brought
[28:15] notice all of these things
[28:18] moses never said
[28:20] are you
[28:21] brother aaron you bring the blue
[28:24] uh sister anna you bring the scarlet
[28:26] that was never said
[28:29] but he was communicated and what god
[28:32] needed they already had been entrusted
[28:34] with
[28:37] hallelujah it struck their heart the
[28:39] blue the scarlet
[28:41] the goat's hair it already it's god
[28:44] because remember he's jehovah gyra
[28:47] god is not going to make a vision if
[28:49] there's nothing on earth that can't
[28:51] bring that vision into manifestation
[28:55] god never sends a message unless there's
[28:57] a people on earth that are ordained to
[29:00] line up with that message and become
[29:02] that message
[29:04] he is jehovah jireh he provides for
[29:07] himself
[29:10] is that right oh and the bible says in
[29:13] verse 29 the children of israel brought
[29:15] a willing offering unto the lord every
[29:17] man whose heart made them willing to
[29:19] bring all the manner of work which the
[29:20] lord had commanded to be made by the
[29:23] hand of moses
[29:25] god had arranged this
[29:27] when you read how
[29:29] that even before moses
[29:32] goes down to egypt god let him know on
[29:34] this deliverance
[29:36] and with the people to borrow
[29:39] of the egyptians the gold and all these
[29:41] things because they didn't have them
[29:43] the children of israel didn't have onyx
[29:45] stones and gold and all that they didn't
[29:47] have that
[29:49] think about it if that would have been
[29:51] spoken at that time it wasn't fitting
[29:54] why it wasn't in their possession
[30:00] and you read through the scriptures as
[30:02] it goes god said to borrow to take to
[30:05] gain favor with the egyptians they did
[30:08] not go in there the egyptians and say
[30:10] give me this and give me that and give
[30:11] me this that's not how it worked
[30:15] god continued on in two other places
[30:17] when it was time for the exodus in
[30:20] exodus 11 before
[30:23] chapter 12 god's going into the passover
[30:25] he says you tell the people now is the
[30:28] time
[30:29] to go speak to the egyptians
[30:32] well brother samuel that was egyptian
[30:34] goat the earth
[30:36] is the lord's
[30:38] and the fullness thereof
[30:42] i know it's awful to think about
[30:45] but the 20 bill maybe that's too high
[30:47] the one dollar bill that you've got in
[30:49] your pocket right now might have been a
[30:50] dollar bill that was made for a drug
[30:52] deal last week
[30:55] are you with me
[30:58] but you see in the things that god has
[31:00] entrusted the earth is the lord's and
[31:03] the fullness thereof
[31:06] and the bible says they went out in
[31:08] exodus 12 and they did according to the
[31:10] word of moses and they borrowed of the
[31:13] egyptians
[31:15] and god gave them favor in their sight
[31:20] i'll tell you what i see within that
[31:23] i see the same thing as it was in jacob
[31:25] when jacob came to bethel jacob was just
[31:27] running
[31:29] jacob didn't know anything was special
[31:30] about where he was at at bethel
[31:32] but that night at bethel god had
[31:34] pre-arranged that
[31:36] and when god came down jacob a man that
[31:38] had nothing
[31:40] but he told god he said lord if you
[31:42] watch over me and you bring me back to
[31:44] this place bless me lord god that i will
[31:47] give thee a tithe of all
[31:51] he had met god and notice he could ask
[31:54] he could look to god and say god if you
[31:56] will bless me lord you're the one that
[31:58] has to bless me you're the one lord that
[32:00] has to provide for me jacob made a vow
[32:04] unto god and when jacob returned to the
[32:06] battle
[32:08] brother he returned and he kept that vow
[32:11] he had all he had much right
[32:15] jacob not only had the attempt to offer
[32:17] to god but jacob remembered now we know
[32:19] even out of fear he was sending over
[32:21] droves of cattle and everything else you
[32:23] know to meet esau right
[32:26] even when god even when laban tried to
[32:29] mess with everything change his wages 10
[32:32] times
[32:33] god was watching over jacob
[32:36] god said i'll rebuke the devourer for
[32:38] your sake
[32:39] he was watching over him that even
[32:42] though things fluctuated stock market
[32:44] went up and down but god said i was got
[32:46] before the stock market i'll be god
[32:49] after it's all said and done
[32:51] are you with me
[32:52] i wonder how many people would have
[32:54] thought we could look back on it now
[32:56] when did brother random and then build
[32:57] the tabernacle
[33:02] during the time of
[33:04] the depression
[33:07] is that right
[33:08] he lets us know that he said of how that
[33:10] even the people wanted a church so bad
[33:15] now they had a place together i want you
[33:17] to catch this they had a place i i
[33:19] walked around and brother nathan nam was
[33:21] pointing it out you know the different
[33:22] places and they would take me to where
[33:24] the different gatherings were at where
[33:26] brother branham was where they gathered
[33:27] here they rented this building they
[33:28] rented this building but the people
[33:30] wanted a place that they could call
[33:32] their own
[33:35] and even you you can read that in the
[33:36] message where they made a statement to
[33:38] brother brown they said we will
[33:39] allowance our children at the dinner
[33:42] table
[33:43] in order to have a place
[33:46] you know why
[33:48] these were hearts that caught a vision
[33:51] beyond just natural provision
[33:53] they realize after we are done set and
[33:56] gone we've got to make arrangements if
[33:59] the lord tarries brother samuel god is
[34:01] coming if i knew he was coming tonight
[34:05] i'd still
[34:07] be ready
[34:08] if i knew he was coming on thursday
[34:10] night i'd still get ready to preach
[34:12] thursday's service
[34:14] are you hearing me this is how we are
[34:16] told to live in this hour
[34:20] oh glory be to god
[34:22] you see
[34:24] god has entrusted us with so many things
[34:27] so it's our i you know i i think with
[34:30] everything not just
[34:32] that we should pray about
[34:34] you know when we're
[34:36] the times we already know that's a tenth
[34:38] unto the lord i think we should pray
[34:39] about this with our offerings i think we
[34:41] definitely should pray not think we
[34:43] should pray about it
[34:44] we should make it a matter of prayer
[34:47] you see god has entrusted us
[34:49] with so many different things entrusted
[34:51] us with talents and trusted us with
[34:53] gifts all the way through the gospel
[34:55] itself of jesus christ how that the
[34:58] whole theme of it's displayed in one who
[35:01] took the form of a servant
[35:04] our whole lives are meant to be an
[35:05] offering
[35:07] right
[35:08] our whole lives brother brown would say
[35:10] it like this in the message what house
[35:11] will you build me short message
[35:14] that he speaks to the needs that are in
[35:16] that congregation when brother perry is
[35:17] starting out and he says now look
[35:19] they're going to need sunday school
[35:20] teachers
[35:22] they're going to need deacons they're
[35:23] going to need this they're going to need
[35:25] that
[35:26] and he says
[35:27] you pray about that
[35:30] you see that's being invested in
[35:32] something not everybody's going to be a
[35:33] deacon everybody's going to trust him
[35:34] not everybody's going but we're all
[35:36] invested in the work of the lord what
[35:38] can we do that should be the question
[35:40] lord what can i do
[35:42] what can i do lord what can i do brother
[35:45] browning always used to have a i don't
[35:47] know if it was brother browning's saying
[35:49] or not but he would say it very often
[35:50] and it was a saying that says if
[35:52] everyone was in this if everyone in this
[35:53] church was just like me
[35:55] then what kind of church would this
[35:56] church be and he wasn't talking about
[35:59] himself that's a question that we have
[36:00] to look in the mirror and say if
[36:02] everybody in the church was just like me
[36:03] what kind of church would this church be
[36:07] see sometimes in reality we're counting
[36:09] on other people
[36:11] instead of also being under the burden
[36:13] of the lord
[36:17] and god has called us to labor together
[36:22] to labor together think of this
[36:25] i want to just touch this part on on
[36:27] worship very quickly
[36:30] in luke
[36:32] chap 21 verse 1
[36:35] and he looked up here was the lord jesus
[36:37] he saw rich men casting their gifts into
[36:39] the treasury
[36:40] he saw also a certain poor widow casting
[36:43] into their two mites
[36:44] and he said of a truth i say unto you
[36:47] that this poor widow hath cast in more
[36:50] than they all
[36:51] for all these have of their abundance
[36:54] cast in unto the offerings of god
[36:56] but she of her own
[36:58] penery hath cast in all the living
[37:01] that she had
[37:04] brother branham says it in this way let
[37:06] me just maybe refer to this at the same
[37:08] time
[37:09] two brethren had asked brother branham
[37:12] if he would come and do a meeting
[37:16] they had
[37:18] tithing for him and they were going to
[37:20] put on a meeting brother brown told him
[37:21] he said
[37:22] no he said i'm not going to do that
[37:25] he said what you do is i want you to
[37:27] take what you were going to give
[37:29] and i want you to pay for that meeting
[37:31] all the expenses of that meeting
[37:34] so the brothers brother fred sofman and
[37:36] the other and and brother borders they
[37:38] did that
[37:40] and when they and when they did it
[37:43] the meeting itself was not a success
[37:46] there were things that were so lacking
[37:48] in the meetings brother braham talks
[37:49] about it
[37:50] brother braham says in this he says you
[37:52] know he says i
[37:54] you know he says
[37:55] within it he said meetings are fine he
[37:57] said and we didn't take up an offering
[37:59] he says i don't care if the church is
[38:00] worth a hundred billion dollars you
[38:03] still owe it to god to take up an
[38:04] offering that's part of the worship
[38:10] it doesn't matter he said if it's a
[38:11] hundred billion dollar the church might
[38:14] everything's going good around here i
[38:15] don't think
[38:18] it's going good instead of 20 with two
[38:20] dollars to be all right still got two in
[38:21] it
[38:22] [Music]
[38:24] everybody say man
[38:28] kind of looking around you know
[38:30] but you see but brother brown went on to
[38:32] say within that
[38:35] he said
[38:38] which is true he said i wish i was
[38:40] financially able so we wouldn't even
[38:41] have to mention offering
[38:43] but he said i mention it anyhow and he
[38:44] goes into that example of what took
[38:46] place on that one time
[38:48] and he says
[38:50] when when they did that
[38:51] he said
[38:53] it was not a success
[38:55] because people has to have something in
[38:58] the meeting
[38:59] it's their
[39:01] meeting
[39:06] now i'll be honest with you i've been
[39:07] guilty of this
[39:09] i've been guilty when we had meetings
[39:12] we didn't take up any offering
[39:15] but by his help i'll not be guilty again
[39:21] it's true
[39:22] he said i did it he said people has to
[39:24] have something in the meeting it's their
[39:26] meeting listen what brother brown said
[39:27] the people were saying to him they'd
[39:29] meet me on the street and they'd say
[39:30] what's the matter with this meeting
[39:32] now brother i'm talking about a special
[39:34] meeting you understand what i'm saying
[39:35] he's talking about a special meeting he
[39:37] said people were meeting him on the
[39:38] street and said what's the matter with
[39:40] this meeting we haven't got no part in
[39:42] it they don't even take up an offering
[39:44] so offering is a part of worship
[39:48] brother braham ties into hattie wright
[39:50] brother remember brother branham went to
[39:52] hattie wright's house
[39:53] and he had 20 dollars in his pocket that
[39:56] sister meaty had given him to go buy
[39:58] eggs with
[40:00] and he went to her house
[40:02] with the purpose
[40:04] of giving that money back to sister
[40:06] hattie because sister hattie
[40:08] had pledged that towards the new church
[40:11] now when you read how brother brown
[40:13] speaks of hattie wright's house i her
[40:15] house still isn't standing but i've been
[40:16] right up there where we're right right
[40:17] there on the hill right where it was at
[40:19] and there's a trailer in its place now
[40:21] but when you have brother bam talked
[40:22] about her house brother brown says you
[40:24] could look through the boards and see
[40:26] the outside
[40:27] it struck brother brown's heart when he
[40:29] he went there
[40:31] and brother ram said i went there with
[40:33] that 20 in my heart my pocket i was
[40:35] going to give it back to her
[40:38] but he said the lord told me don't do
[40:40] that but brother brown was still waiting
[40:42] on that and about that time with telling
[40:44] how those squirrels stepped forth in the
[40:46] woods remember brother graham said i
[40:48] can't see how but it's just the same
[40:51] thing of genesis 22 that god provided a
[40:54] ram for abraham and he said he she was
[40:58] sitting back there and she said that
[41:00] ain't nothing but the truth he said see
[41:02] what it is he said i was going to give
[41:04] it back to her but god knew what he was
[41:07] going to do for her
[41:09] if you were to ask sister hattie sister
[41:12] had in that twenty dollars or your two
[41:14] your sons their two souls she didn't buy
[41:17] their souls but her willingness to offer
[41:20] and to give god seen beyond that
[41:26] whatever she would ask for at that time
[41:28] she could have had it her daddy being
[41:30] well her sister being made well but she
[41:33] turned around and he said i want the
[41:34] salvation of my two boys
[41:37] and the spirit of god came in there and
[41:40] brought conviction to their lives
[41:44] oh my you know you know what that speaks
[41:46] of is this right here it let us be
[41:48] invested in the things of god it will
[41:51] have an effect on our families on our
[41:54] children
[41:54] [Applause]
[41:56] we want to be invested in the vision
[41:58] catch the vision of almighty god and
[42:01] pray over these things in our lives
[42:04] i think if there's things if we could
[42:05] say it within this manner many many
[42:07] other places i could go into but if we
[42:10] could take it within that even that 90
[42:12] percent that we have to where our
[42:15] offerings comes from because the 10th is
[42:17] already set but the 90 what comes out of
[42:20] there are offering that's but that's
[42:21] between us and god there's no set amount
[42:23] that's on that
[42:27] but can i just give you a testimony
[42:30] the way that i've worked it in my own
[42:32] life for our family
[42:35] before marriage and after marriage
[42:38] because i know how things can come here
[42:40] or there
[42:41] but i made certain things and and stands
[42:44] that this is where i'm going i'm going
[42:46] to stand right here
[42:47] you say why would you do that
[42:49] so that when it came to make decisions
[42:51] on other things
[42:53] i was not going to go across that
[42:55] because
[42:56] i don't want to tie things up to where
[42:58] god can't deal with my heart
[43:01] are you hearing me
[43:03] i remember back in 2003 or 2002 whenever
[43:06] it was we
[43:07] built our house that we sold brother joy
[43:09] they
[43:10] called me up and they wanted me to come
[43:11] in well i never thought i'd build a
[43:12] house whatsoever i really wasn't even
[43:14] looking at that i
[43:15] i went in there and i told them before i
[43:17] come in and say wait a minute just
[43:18] just cancel the appointment i'm not
[43:20] interested
[43:21] oh but you come in and you know we've
[43:22] got somebody in here you know and and
[43:24] they'll they'll talk with you on the
[43:26] financing one more i said ma'am you may
[43:29] not understand this
[43:31] i said but i pay tithes
[43:34] unto the lord
[43:36] now i was already pastoring the time
[43:38] i said and you know what i support the
[43:40] work of the lord and offerings and i
[43:41] said i know the people that are going to
[43:43] be looking at the financial part you're
[43:45] going to tell me what i can't afford i
[43:46] know what i can't afford
[43:49] you know it's like you go to the car
[43:50] dealership and you and you go to them
[43:52] and they if there's somebody anybody
[43:53] who's a car dealer in here forgive me
[43:55] but you know they they get you in there
[43:57] how you like it you like take it for a
[43:59] ride
[44:00] ah let's see kev we get you out the door
[44:02] for this much how much is it what if we
[44:05] get how much is it
[44:07] how much you're giving me on mine right
[44:10] because you know they want to look they
[44:12] look at everything and tell you well
[44:13] this is how much he can do no no this is
[44:15] why i believe within our hearts friends
[44:17] as children of god that
[44:19] if we look at these things and say you
[44:21] know i don't want finances to be a
[44:23] burden
[44:26] in my life and we've all made mistakes
[44:28] i said we've all made mistakes that
[44:30] comes with the territory
[44:32] right
[44:33] but if we can look at it and say god i
[44:34] don't even want that to be a burden i
[44:36] don't want that to be a thought i don't
[44:38] even want i just i want to be free to
[44:40] serve you i want to i don't want tension
[44:42] in my marriage i don't want
[44:46] this is this is our responsibility
[44:49] that god entrust us with
[44:53] oh man you love him
[44:56] all right let's just
[44:58] we'll just close with that
[45:00] the offerings as you see what we take up
[45:03] its offerings is
[45:04] there's bills that that are had just in
[45:07] bills without even a project or
[45:09] something that comes along
[45:11] uh other things that comes up
[45:13] maintenance and
[45:14] everything else that takes place and
[45:16] this is why i really admonish you and i
[45:19] thank god
[45:20] the faithfulness
[45:22] that you have exhibited to the lord and
[45:24] i say god richly bless you
[45:26] if these services have done nothing more
[45:29] than just to encourage you i trust it
[45:31] has encouraged you for those of you that
[45:33] have not really moved in to become a
[45:36] part that it will encourage you to
[45:37] really
[45:38] become a part in taking god at his word
[45:41] for those that have been a part if you
[45:43] just it may be just refocus the vision
[45:45] that you recognize
[45:47] that this is this where you can say this
[45:49] is my church
[45:50] this is my responsibility this isn't
[45:53] brother samuel's church this isn't so
[45:54] this is my church
[45:56] god has revealed that this is my poster
[45:58] duty
[45:59] this is mine this is everything that
[46:01] goes around here
[46:03] you know
[46:04] with the things that we do and the
[46:05] trustees
[46:07] they know when we we sit down and we
[46:08] speak with things and i believe the same
[46:10] thing in their heart as well too
[46:12] you know we're not trying to make
[46:13] anything to where it would be
[46:15] gold covered
[46:17] but i do want everything to be very
[46:19] presentable
[46:20] if that means if we have to wait let's
[46:22] wait
[46:24] i don't want blue with green and patched
[46:26] with green if
[46:28] is that all right
[46:29] we want it to be presentable when david
[46:31] could say
[46:32] i
[46:33] dwell in a house
[46:35] and that and the ark of the lord dwells
[46:37] in tense
[46:40] see david knew god
[46:43] deserves the best
[46:47] these are things that we just we thank
[46:49] god for the maintenance that god has
[46:51] allowed us to be able to do through the
[46:53] offerings and things and look
[46:55] in reality with this right here this
[46:57] this special project that we've it's not
[47:00] been an option like could we do it
[47:02] uh should we do it it was something we
[47:04] had to do we come to a spot
[47:07] we've had to do it
[47:08] it's not like other things where you you
[47:10] can you know where it just becomes an
[47:12] option and what are the things that's
[47:13] been done throughout throughout the
[47:15] building
[47:16] thank god we we never had we didn't take
[47:18] a special offering you know why that is
[47:20] that's because of your giving
[47:22] within the offerings it was there
[47:25] to be able to do with
[47:27] right all of that back there because
[47:29] remember
[47:30] this is your church
[47:33] this is your church all that that was
[47:35] done everything that you see and don't
[47:36] see the video and all those things there
[47:39] it is all of your giving and now you
[47:41] know we just we don't want to be taken
[47:43] with those things
[47:45] but we want to obey the word of the lord
[47:47] because to know that god
[47:49] is mindful
[47:51] and as long as i've got breath in my
[47:52] body and to stand here as long as you
[47:54] have me for that we want to see that the
[47:57] work of god goes forward
[48:00] amen and then the work keeps on moving
[48:03] on for the kingdom of god
[48:06] that
[48:07] you know the next month or the next
[48:08] tomorrow or these years i may not live
[48:10] to see that
[48:12] but my children will at god teres
[48:14] and brother branham would tell us
[48:16] even in the message mother's day the
[48:18] very first quote he admonished the
[48:20] church he said i see you're getting
[48:22] ready to build a new church he said
[48:24] that's wonderful he said because we have
[48:26] to think about our children and make
[48:28] arrangements for a place for them
[48:31] they didn't end up building a new
[48:32] building they ended up adding on to that
[48:35] building that they had there
[48:37] but that was part of the message taking
[48:39] sides with jesus i'm just giving these
[48:41] little things is that okay
[48:42] when brother branham was dealing with
[48:44] and taking sides with jesus he said
[48:46] we've got to think about our children
[48:47] that's coming on and make arrangements
[48:50] for them
[48:52] not just in building
[48:53] not just in
[48:55] all these things of finances but we have
[48:58] to think of it in terms of let our lives
[49:01] be an example
[49:03] that they can follow
[49:04] let the testimony of jesus christ be so
[49:07] prevailing in our lives and our hearts
[49:10] that it's his presence
[49:12] that affects their life
[49:15] amen
[49:17] amen how many love the lord
[49:20] how many glad you came
[49:25] amen
[49:29] i want to live the way he wants me to
[49:31] live if musicians would come
[49:34] much more that we
[49:36] but i believe that the lord helped us to
[49:38] see and gather just to be admonished
[49:40] it's a worship
[49:42] the giving of our times and offerings of
[49:43] worship unto the lord we're worshiping
[49:45] him
[49:46] for his great provision
[49:48] in our lives
[49:50] and what a worship it is
[49:52] and i hope you understood that when i
[49:53] said that about meetings because that
[49:55] was one of the things that we we never
[49:58] did and it isn't about money but there
[50:00] are i will say this when we do have
[50:02] meetings there are extra expenses that
[50:04] goes on uh the brothers know it from
[50:06] when they have to call about the septic
[50:08] tank and all those other things like
[50:09] that water and all those other things
[50:11] that takes place as well as things that
[50:13] we we are thankful that we're able to do
[50:16] whether to providing lunch uh providing
[50:19] things even when the other young people
[50:20] and things are getting together on those
[50:22] days and all everything that goes into
[50:24] it we want to be a part of it
[50:27] so we're not here to
[50:28] gather and garner
[50:30] uh out of that but it's always unto the
[50:33] lord
[50:34] amen
[50:36] hallelujah well we need to sing
[50:38] something
[50:39] you know i
[50:41] i heard a
[50:43] it was told me one time as a
[50:46] young boy
[50:47] it was a brother who substituted for the
[50:49] song service that day and
[50:51] when it came to taking up times and
[50:53] offerings he took the plate he wasn't
[50:55] thinking but he began to walk around and
[50:57] sing the song it is mine mine blessed be
[51:00] his name
[51:12] you know
[51:14] it's sometimes we don't think about
[51:16] things like that you know but
[51:18] the reality is is
[51:20] you know we we thank god because listen
[51:22] the greatest offering that we can ever
[51:24] give
[51:25] is to offer up our lives to the lord
[51:28] it's the greatest
[51:30] god doesn't take it from us remember he
[51:31] doesn't he doesn't force anybody to
[51:33] serve
[51:34] he doesn't force us that's not god's way
[51:36] if that if you're in that condition
[51:38] today that's a miserable condition
[51:41] you don't have to stay in that way
[51:43] god
[51:45] desires an offering
[51:48] that's brought from our hearts our lives
[51:50] offered up to him and you know that
[51:52] offering doesn't stop
[51:53] that offering goes about daily
[51:56] there's sometimes daily that we don't
[51:58] feel like praying
[52:00] we don't feel like reading
[52:03] we don't feel like sitting down and
[52:06] sometimes we just you just don't feel
[52:07] like it but that's that's the flesh
[52:10] but this is where it becomes a sacrifice
[52:13] and the offering and what a blessing it
[52:15] is when we can move beyond that barrier
[52:18] sometimes we maybe don't feel as
[52:22] you know and
[52:23] in other things reaching out to this one
[52:25] or reaching out here but you know it's
[52:26] an offering
[52:28] there's times with our families there's
[52:29] certain things that you know among your
[52:31] children there's certain things that are
[52:32] not your favorite activities to do with
[52:35] them
[52:36] right
[52:37] but but you don't do
[52:39] just what's favorite
[52:41] with you
[52:43] you find what they enjoy doing
[52:46] because it's all about not the activity
[52:48] it's about building the relationship of
[52:50] them
[52:51] i'm sure that the young brothers or the
[52:53] brothers who have
[52:54] daughters young daughters i'm sure
[52:57] you've probably played
[53:00] daddy in the house next to the little
[53:02] tikes once in a while
[53:05] you've ate the
[53:06] imaginary mac and cheese and you've
[53:08] drank the imaginary tea
[53:10] you've tasted the imaginary beef stew
[53:12] and said it was the best in the world
[53:14] and
[53:16] why did you do that not because you said
[53:18] boy i can't wait today we get to play
[53:20] house
[53:22] you did what you did as an offering
[53:25] because of that relationship
[53:27] with your daughter
[53:29] [Music]
[53:31] and that's what our lives every part of
[53:33] our life is an offering unto god
[53:36] our family life
[53:37] our life unto god paul would write
[53:40] let us present our lives
[53:43] as a living sacrifice
[53:45] an offering
[53:47] a sacrifice
[53:49] this is what we want to do we want every
[53:50] part of our life
[53:52] i don't want to just be
[53:53] where i'm giving in offerings but i want
[53:56] my life to be an offering
[53:58] where paul could say at the end of it
[54:00] he said now i'm ready to be offered up
[54:04] i've poured out my life now i'm ready to
[54:06] be offered up
[54:08] we want every part of our life lord
[54:10] i want every part of my life to center
[54:14] around you lord
[54:15] to where when my time is up here on this
[54:17] earth there might be a lot of other
[54:19] things that they could read about and
[54:20] know about but the one thing that's at
[54:22] the top of the list
[54:26] wasn't that boy he
[54:28] really enjoyed hunting no that that's
[54:30] true but that's not at the top of the
[54:32] list
[54:34] but when everything is said and done if
[54:36] my time comes before the rapture i want
[54:38] it to be where it said
[54:41] he was a real christian
[54:44] he loved the lord with all this heart
[54:47] he loved this message and then you can
[54:49] list the other things
[54:53] he liked throwing the football he liked
[54:54] getting out and hunting like
[54:56] but everything else
[54:57] jesus
[54:59] is number one
[55:01] amen let's pray
[55:04] heavenly father
[55:08] lord i thank you for your grace lord
