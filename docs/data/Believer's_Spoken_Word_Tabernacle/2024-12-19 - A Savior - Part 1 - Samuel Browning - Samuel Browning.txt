our strength Lord oh God tonight Lord as we just Lord just want to say thank you we just want to say thank you we have many requests we have many petitions and we're not ashamed to come before your throne and to lay every one of them Lord At Your Feet Lord and to believe you for all things Lord but we want to say thank you Lord amen we thank you Lord for every request Lord that you have answered Lord thank you for each time that you've moved our heart into the place to be able to recognize you and to receive Lord God what it is that you would bring our way we just Lord ask that you'll just take control now Lord in the further part of this service amen what a what a privilege it is to Worship You Lord hallelujah what a privilege Lord and we just pray that Lord you'll just help us together that we can step out of the way that Lord that you can just come and speak to our hearts may you move Among Us Lord for every need those that are able to be your lord those that are not Lord that even through the streaming Lord May the angel of the Lord make a visit Lord I pray to every life and every heart Lord and give to us what we have need of Lord we pray we just ask these things oh God in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen you loving amen any good amen the Lord is so good amen God bless you thank you musicians amen I would like to turn here tonight once again into the uh Book of Job and the school to chapter 26 and I want to just speak just draw a little bit more from uh the second verse tonight and job 26 and we'll just read verses one and verse two and I want to the Lord would just help us tonight I just uh want to kind of lay a little bit of a a groundwork here I thought I would probably get to uh well at least hoped I would get to all of it and I begin to realize there's just no way to lay it in and um but then again if he changes course then he changes course but uh I just want to be uh very sensitive and mindful of him and I don't want to rush through things um so in job 26 verse one verse two amen but job answered and said how has the thou help him that is without power and how savest thou the arm that hath no strength and that's what we want to just draw from here tonight how savest thou the arm that hath no strength amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated amen like to say just such a such a blessing just to be able to see you tonight and uh I know different ones that have been recovering it's good to see you here and sister Stephanie sister Barb and different ones and I know there's others that uh um I know that are also dealing with certain things even from the places that they work with and so forth so uh let's just keep one another in prayer uh you know it makes one thing about it it makes you look forward to a time when all this will pass and uh and not just I'm not just looking in the future way out there even though I desire that in the Millennium uh that's the kind of Health Care system I believe in I mean when you think of it in the Millennium that there will be lives the Bible said that there would be raised up those who had come against the city and those that had never heard but the prophet said they'll be raised in the time of the Millennium and they will G be given a chance to receive the Gospel and to think of how that they will come back and walk within this and they'll never experience any ailment or any physical condition or any sickness in their body and the sad thing about it is is being in such a perfect condition at the end of it all there'll be many that'll make a decision in that time and say I don't want this so even in a perfect condition in a perfect situation you know what you know what it comes down to show us that it's it's it's deeper than all the atmosphere that we're around it's what's on the inside of us that can respond to the glory of God and that part on the inside that's all God's working that's why it all comes down to the grace of God so we're certainly looking forward to that time of when there'll be no sickness and we always look forward to the time of when through the year if God terries that things just kind of pass and it runs its course and goes on in the meantime we just want to hold one another up in prayer but I'd like to just speak here tonight uh Bria if you go ahead and switch that over for me I'd like to speak here tonight on a savior and I'd like to deal with this thought here within this uh portion of the verse that job is expressing to the Brethren who are there and remember they came I believe with all my heart I believe they came to be a help I believe they came in some way to try to save or to minister to job I I don't believe that they came with the wrong intentions uh but what they lacked is what we've been the Lord's been leading us on is they lack discernment and so if there's everything any everything that we need we need the discernment and the leadership of the Holy Spirit go God's given us his word in this hour and what a powerful word and that word of power and authority is the King's word it's God restoring his word by his presence in our lives and there's a confidence that we have from an inner work in our own lives and yet with that when as we approach uh one another as brothers and sisters we approach sometime those that maybe are backsliding or we come across others that maybe you know they're just they're looking and just struggling and maybe maybe there there's something they're longing for a little bit more and we just always want to know that there's one thing and there's one objective that we have and that is we always want to point people to the Lord Jesus Christ if there's one thing that when we leave that the one thing that they have been impressed upon their life is that they have been able to see Jesus Christ a little bit more clear and that the more uh determined to serve him you know I I just say it in this way that you know my objective is not to go and to try to take Pentecostals or Methodist or Baptist and try to make them a message Believers if they're ordained seed of God then when the light shines in humility there will be something that is there that only God can satisfy and God will draw them to himself he'll use the agency of man that's true and that's what we're going to begin speaking about tonight how God uses that that agency of man but at the same time if they are walking in all the light that they are or D to see I pray that God let my life be that which would encourage them to be all that God would have them to be that's that because that takes all of us us not trying to pull people or struggle just just be a light brother Bram said let it Flash in humility and God will take care of the rest of it and sometimes you know when we know that uh uh with that sometimes you know a lot of thoughts can come in but Lord just help us to have our thoughts just stable ized on you and so I want to just look at this this here on how savest thou the arm that hath no strength and I want to look at that thought on a savior the scriptures here tonight I'd like to look at this here because to be that of a savior uh would be that of where to be delivered or be liberated and uh to be saved from many times moral troubles to be saved from many uh different situations that that could be present and we understand that there is no savior but God Alone true we want to just really lay that in it's not it's not our strength it's not our abilities but it's God at work that's why when God showed Zachariah the the picture of the Candlestick which was representative of the seven Church ages and he asked him what do you see and zachariah's response to the angel uh because a prophet does not know the symbol unless God interprets the symbol but a prophet is a channel that God will interpret symbols so that symbols no longer remain as symbols but now they become clear pictures and so he said what will you what thou sayest what is it and he let him know that the whole working within that of the candlesticks is not by my not by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord this mountain shall be removed so it's always it's it's God's spirit at work and it that's that's if there's anything that is to be achieved in our lives anything that is achieved in our homes and our families and everywhere it must come by the spirit of God but God needs channels to work through and that's what we want to be it's just like an extension cord if you run an extension cord from right here and run it back there and you could plug a fan up maybe where Brother Carlos is at that extension cord just serves to carry the electricity it doesn't produce it but if it's unplugged from The Source no matter how much it's plugged up there the the extension cord does not have anything to carry that's why in our lives we always want to stay plugged in always want to stay plugged in so there's some there's a current that's flowing through our lives that it's not I that liveth but Christ who liveth in me so now in looking at how Paul would write this all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation so now God coming down to become one of us now through and through and by the work of Calvary that the blood has been shed now that same life God's own life comes into the worship and it ties us together with God then we are part of the ministry of reconciliation so the spirit of God is not a spirit that draws circles tighter or excludes or even looks down but the ministry of reconciliation is even not about someone uh joining and and seeing things the way I see it it's about being reconciled to God glory that's the focus that's the objective is being reconciled to God and before that that can really be the objective in our lives we have to in countless situations always make sure that our objectives our motives are in tune and in line with God that we as an individual are completely reconciled to God and then the ministry of reconciliation Works through us and I want to just say this to you it's not just a one Stop Shop deal that it just well you know I've received the spirit of God so I'm part of the ministry of reconciliation you have to stay in a place to where your life remains as a channel to be reconciled in all areas of our life I can't get to that tonight but that's the that's the challenge and that's what Satan wants to work on is to try to hinder and block the channel true that's what he wants to try to do do he'll try to do that through discouragement he'll try to do that through uh frustration he'll try to do that through many different agencies but God's desire is that that Ministry of reconciliation remember he's the one in us that carries the message it's not us carrying the message it's Christ in US carrying the message because the message is of him glory to God that's what the holy ghost coming that's what it is now to ITT that go watch how Paul Paul brings this so that we can see our own selves to wit that God was in Christ Recon reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation so in other words all of the trespasses could not hinder or stop God from fulfilling his word and once his word has been fulfilled then it's able to deal with the trespasses it's able to deal with the hindrances that we might be fully reconciled to God because not one of us could make ourselves fit to a place to be reconciled with God is that right John looked and he looked he saw in Heaven and Earth and saw no man worthy no one was worthy but then John receiv received a call there is one Behold the Lamb Worthy is the Lamb Glory the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world that lamb that became preeminent in the body of Jesus Christ now that lamb walks forward with authority to say I have taken care of everything that they have done and all that was lost even that of creation I've come to fully claim what I have done yes Hallelujah I'm glad he's got the book in his hand aren't you I'm glad to be a recipient of that book tonight A recipient of that life now notice how he says this a word of reconciliation these are the this is the things oh God let our lives be so seasoned as we've talked in previous weeks on Words fit words that are spoke that it's words of reconciliation now then we are ambass adors for Christ amen so I'm not an ambassador for a church no I'm an ambassador for Christ am I'm not an ambassador to try to get people here we are ambassadors to try to get them to Christ because we know it's not a church that's changed us it was God who changed us even the understanding and the knowledge of the message did not change us but meeting the person that has changed our lives we are EMB ambassadors of Christ fully authorized Vindicated sealed agents of the most high God hallelujah just like when you can be looking at a person and you don't know who they are and how many times policemen have come up and they've pulled somebody over and they've arrested them and all of a sudden here the person pops out a badge they look like everybody else pling clothesman they blend right in the fbca whatever more they blend right in but they have a badge and it is a it is that of an authority that states who they are you and I do not look any different as far as we're made of the same flesh as every other person out there but there's one thing that separates you and I and that's the grace of God on display by the Seal of the Living God in our lives and that seal in our forehead in our heart it gives us a knowledge to walk we do not walk as other Gentiles will walk we walk as Sons and Daughters of God we're ambassadors of Christ amen as though God did beseech You by us so God used vessels to speak and to reach others they were not they did not become polites or Apollos sites or or branhamites but they became sons of God manifested through the vessels that God would use that's why that it's not the Highlight that we become a reflection of church to so much to where that someone says oh we can tell that if so and so is your pastor we don't want we don't want to Bear the image of a man we want to Bear the image of Jesus Christ that's why our glory is not some Doctrine our glory is the person of Jesus Christ on display in our lives sir Hallelujah yes sir we pray you notice we pray you in Christ's dead we're standing on his behalf be ye reconciled to God for he notice this declaration for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in Christ that's a powerful statement it points to him who was the innocent one I tell you the other day I I was listening to the to the message and how the prophet begin to speak about that and in the message of Grace and he says here was a here was a king he sent his son he said and there was one who rose up and he you know he he got in a moment of anger and he killed that son and and here he was on on the death penalty but then the king said I want to take a few moments and I want to go down and talk to this young man and he went down to talk to this young man as brother Ram tells a story and he got into that cell with that young man and he said the young man and he said why did you do it the young man said I was in a fit of rage he said I don't know why I did it I'm so sorry I did it I didn't mean to do it and he said the king walked out of the sell he said he went over and he got over on a desk and he took the record of that young man and he wrote pardoned on it and he said you have become my son this day oh my and to think about it the prophet said that's what he did for me we were guilty it was the iniquity of us all he hath laid on him it was for my sins that he was crucified I was that barabus and he took my place Hallelujah I didn't deserve it I didn't become good enough but God rich in Mercy a savior came down thank you Jesus hallu he took upon my sin your sin our shame that he might place within us his own life and bring us back to being Sons and Daughters of God again amen the holy ghost coming by way of the word loosens a Ministry and you and I are part of this ministry a matter of fact in questions and answerers 61 brother bradam gathering with a group of Brethren of ministers he says Brethren this message that God is given me he said we are together in this message we are messengers of this message and the prophet said when you have received the Holy Ghost in the Hebrew series now the spirit of God in you has brought you into a place you are messengers of the Covenant Christ through you is witnessing that the Covenant that God made is in effect and they see the working of the Covenant keeping God in your life my my that's enough to just say glory be to God thank you Jesus and hallelujah praise the Lord but there's some more oh God reach down in his mercy God is our savior yes he is God our savior let me just I I know I but I just want to I love I love the word of God I just want to rehearse some scripture here Jonah said clearly salvation is of the Lord amen Isaiah 43:11 I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior there ain't nobody else I alone am the savior Isaiah 45: 2122 tell ye and bring them near yay tell them and take counsel together who ha declared this from the ancient time who have told it from the time have not I the Lord there is no God else beside me a just God and a savior there is none beside me look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else none else Hallelujah I'm glad that if that here the announcement comes look unto me look unto me who A finished work I'm your savior look on me aren't you glad if he's calling us to look then there must be a renting of the veil there must be a loosening of the seals it must be where Christ is coming in plain view to where the worshipper can look and see a finished work they can see themselves in Christ they can recognize my enemy is dead they can recognize I am more than an overcomer I wish I had more voice I wish I had more strength because that is the authority that overcomes every of Satan's poison breath is being able to look and see him our Mighty conqueror and you and I are tied into that yes we're tied into that it's already begun in your life it's already begun in your life he changed he changed your nature and then when test and trials have kind to come your way and Satan is one to knock you down there has been a resurrection power within you that has brought you right back into places again with God it is God working in your life my 1 Timothy 2 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior right who will have all men to be saved that's God's desire is it all would be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth God's desire what is the knowledge of the truth it's not it's not a a a knowledge as far as facts but the knowledge of the truth is to having that understanding of his life dwelling in us what he come to do in us and listen to come to that place and to come to that realization once he's come in of who's on the inside Hallelujah did you catch that to recognize who has come into your life and to recognize what his purpose is to do did you catch that see it's not something that all of a sudden here the knowledge of the truth has come in and then from that moment on man there's there's no battle no now there becomes a battle but now in the realization of that it's giving the preeminence to the truth himself who is Christ don't you to love that sir my think about that for there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus un who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time oh my for therefore notice how Paul words this we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the Living God who is the savior of all men especially those that believe you see he's a SA savior of all yeah he is is that right he gave his life for all but he came with his mind upon those in the book of redemption but notice if there had not been a fall there would have been many that would have never populated upon the Earth but God even in the midst of the Fall there are many names that are written outside of the little section there are many names that are written in the Book of Life is that right there's many that's why brother Ram would say it over and over if it's a Catholic man and he's trusting in the church for his salvation he's lost but if he's trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ he's saved right he said that about the Methodist goes on down now he didn't say well that's a part of the Bride he's talking about they have believed and they are saved now if God's if God's desire and they and and they are aart they they listen they were then always apart in God's mind and a part of the word then let me tell you something God will not leave hoof behind God won't do it thank you Jesus sometimes it might take a lot of things where God has to work on a life it'll come it'll things will drop here and drop there and drop there look at that he Pharaoh didn't let him go after the first plague fell no stubbornness resistance but you know what that showed if we can look at it in this way and instead of looking at it and say man why didn't he let him go man why haven't they come yet man why haven't they turned around yet but look at how God God's not going to give up on one of his words he's not going to give up on one of his children I'm telling you claim your children God is not giving up on one he'll move he'll move everything to get to one of his children Hallelujah it don't matter they may not have come or they may not be here when the first plague is Fallen second plague but God is still a god of his word and he didn't send a message into your life to come back empty handed Glory Hallelujah glory be to God I'm talking about a savior Hallelujah notice acts 5:30 the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior he's the prince of the kings of the earth he's the chief one he he's the author he he's he's the now he's the one that was the example to say this is how it was back there in Eden this is how it was with Adam and now I have come to restore what has been lost I have come to redeem my children he's prince and a savior for to give repentance to Israel in forgiveness of sins so it what what is it all about what what is what what is the objective for the preaching of the Gospel under the inspiration of God what's the objective in your life has God lead you to witness and God would lead you to maybe to speak to somebody else or you know to contact another brother or sister in church and you know maybe just to to encourage them or you know maybe as we would go to to pray for them what what is our objective well our objective is certainly we know that we can't save nobody we can't heal nobody but we know the God who is more than enough we know the God who saves We Know The God Who heals and so the objective is is God let my life just be a channel that Faith their faith can be built to the place of the finished work to where they can see it's finished to where they can see I'm already healed to where they can see amen I'm already saved they can see God's Redemptive plan God sweeten our actions sweeten our our our words give us the right words in the right season at the right time is that right oh my faith to it's faith in a finished work and this is why look how brother BR says this because remember how many times brother Brandon was accused or you know they would say this Dr best was one of them that said it down in Houston of saying well you know Here Comes This Divine healer and over and over brother Brandon faced that and he said well you know if you say I'm a Divine healer by saying go into this hospital and empty everybody up you be a Divine healer he said well then I'll say to you go into the bar down the street and you be a divine Savior and he said no more than you could be a divine Savior I'm not a Divine healer but God's the Healer and God is the savior amen is that right and he he he moves right down and he'll he'll crawl he'll step over this one step over that step over there he'll get he'll get to the one let me tell you when God coming down there to the pool of beest and he stepped over this one stepped over that one moved there you know what that was all about that was not showing that God was lacking in compassion but his compassion was tied to the will of God you see sometimes this is why the prophet would take time with that and said sometimes he said we get human compassion confused with God's compassion because you say what's IND different human compassion is always about reconciling Humanity with Humanity but Godly compassion is reconciling with God because that's the lasting work right it's just like if somebody you know here have compassion and somebody all of a sudden comes and they learn the message they know the message but if they've not met the Lord Jesus Christ it's only a matter of time that if they they don't need him to wear something a website or this or that may not even be that it just may here it just just walk right away but this is why it's not about learning the message it's meeting the person of Jesus Christ that's what it's all about because he's the one that gives us Victory let me tell you something we don't stand there and defeat the devil on a daily basis by being able to recite Doctrine Doctrine just belongs to us are you hearing me the right Doctrine belongs to us because the spirit of Truth has come to lead and guide us into all truth but we're standing there knowing who we are knowing that we've been redeemed knowing that his life is working within us and we stand on those sacred Sands where the devil can't put his dirty feet Glory Hallelujah and who did that a savior Hallelujah now watch brother R says in believing God he says there you are he's talking about that Divine healer divine Savior there you are faith in the word you couldn't say save no one preaching the gospel of Salvation doesn't make you a divine Savior no more than preaching Divine Healing makes me a Divine healer but it's faith in God's spoken word yeah and he said and I know this that some of us has more faith than others and those who have abundance of Faith are supposed to pray for those but if you don't live the right kind of life you better leave away from it the devil will laugh at your prayer but when you live right and do right and act right and have faith in God Satan will tremble with when you speak cuz God swore under obligation he take care of that prayer yes he will Hallelujah I say God let us be channels Lord now remember there like man told us here there's a lot of different diversity diversity of gifts diversity of administrations Paul lays that out in the body God don't want us being all alike he does need that who in the world has a whole a whole tool chest full of nothing nothing but Philip screwdrivers sometimes you need a plier sometimes you need a flathead screwdriver is that right you need all different types of tools is that right I mean there's there's a need for different tools and God has so fixed it in our lives each of us are an instrument for his glory am and God ain't going to use you as a flathead screwdriver to pound a nail in the wall he you know what my brother has that gift my brother Hammer come on over here you know what that is when pride has been knocked out it ain't about it don't matter who gets the glory god gets the glory I know a brother I know this I come on over here brother Hammer come on over brother screwdriver come on over brother brother brother pliers come on over here brother needle noose oh my I'm so thankful for the Arsenal that God has in his body and let me just tell you the truth you and I are not a not Swiss pocket knives where we've got all sorts of things and pulling out this and pulling out that a spoon a fork a knife and a cork breaker and everything else nope we are instruments and God don't expect us to do what he called somebody else to do that's right amen he's the great Diamond that shines through it all but in the midst of it if we just settle upon this God recognizing the strength of Our Lives for God to move through our life lives as a savior now I want you to think this is why it comes from drawing drawing from the right Source how many know we got to draw from the right Source you know you got to you know it's like I said if you don't you plug that that that extension cord into the wrong to the wrong thing you plug into one that where maybe there's a wire or something that's you know messed up in that in that extension cord I don't know if you've ever had to do that sometimes in lamps I've had to take that off and replace and rehook that wire and and you know it wasn't that it needed a whole new set up in that lamp it's just something got loose it got shorted out from what use yeah now listen the holy ghost in your soul never gets old the Garment of Salvation which is the holy spirit never wears out that's what Israel experienced in a type when they walk through the Wilderness when their shoes didn't wear out and their clothes didn't get be God God was using that as a type that there's an experience that won't wear out thank you but that other part this garment this garment that gets older uglier I'm just speaking from me I I I see I see I see pictures of me and and then dear God I mean really I mean I look at let me get a hat on quick I don't want to flash you know I mean when I'm looking at this thing is the one that gets tired gets weary gets weak gets troubled I'm talking about our flesh and our spirit but notice this is why we are drawing from the source of Living Waters and that's why Satan battles against that Source because he knows the authority that's in it and that you and I are called to be channels that's why he battles it listen your prayer life it's not just about you you're reading and giving to the word it's not just about you you see as you're taking that word in it not only comes in but now it moves moves in our lives and it comes out right I mean when when when you ate your carne aada today did you determine and say this carneada it's going to go down and the you know the the the red blood settles in this right here I needed some iron so it's going to go down into my toe there and it's going to take care of that place I got on my toe and there you didn't determine that no or you'd be stay it's been a while since I had some of that but you you don't determine that when I eat the rice the rice is going to go here and it's going to break down this the complex car you don't need you don't worry about that the nutrients in it find themselves in the in your life and that's how it is with the word of God it's packed with the gospel it's packed with what you and I have need of and it will go to work in every area of our life where you and I have need of it you know what that is it's taking our mind off of our problems and focusing on Jesus Christ amen because this word has power in it it has glory in it has transforming power in it it has the vitamins that's needed in it to go to work in our life I don't have to tell the word where to go the word knows where to go and then it'll work out in my life you know like after you ate you're no longer hangry you you comfortable to be around some people got that one drawn from the source of Living Waters notice 1 Timothy 4:15 meditate notice how Paul writes to Timothy medit meditate upon these things your mind give your mind give your heart meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them that thy profiting may appear to all now it's not the objective is that you might have some glorious appearance no meditate upon these things give yourself to them is not not what Jesus said hide thyself away in the closet prayeth to him that seeth in secret and he that seeth in hearing in secret will reward thee openly what is it speaking of there is a manifestation for a life that's being hidden away and there's also effects when we're not hiding away like we should is that right leaves become prickers it goes from a beautiful oak tree oh I didn't know it was a cactus we got we got we we got Cactus here in lorine no no no come on friends we I I'm speaking all of us all of us notice what he said take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine so un giving what is he speaking he's letting Paul he's letting Timothy know give yourself to the message of the hour to that reality that God has manifested his glory he is our savior and continue in them that's a challenge to continue means keep moving don't don't become sedentary don't become complacent keep moving for in doing this this is the result then for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee praise God so sometimes we're looking and saying God I I I'm praying for this and we should pray Lord I I you know I'm I'm I'm working trying to make contact but you know what don't become discouraged by what you're not seeing keep giving yourself to the Lord because after all it's going to be him that turns their heart it's going to be him and us as we give ourselves to him not only will you save yourself so in other words here we are giving oursel to the word what happens all of our frustrations everything that we sometimes get so bottled up Lord I am doing this Lord I'm I'm really loving them Lord I'm really doing it Lord I'm really loving them Lord and they're and they're just acting mean and terrible and everything Lord I'm loving them and as we get just keep praying and get staying in his presence we begin to realize I'm not loving them like you love them amen I'm loving them how I love them right Lord I need a refilling of the love of God I need a refilling of the holy spirit so see what happens Thou shalt save thyself and others that hear thee you see what happens is that as we stay in God's presence then there's things that can be made right in our own hearts and our own lives that when we go out of there isn't it wonderful where you can go to the Lord and cast and leave your burdens there sometimes you're leaving burdens you didn't even realize you were carrying his burdens and you're able to leave them there and you walk out of there and you realize what you thought was the problem was not the problem and the burden has been let down and now Thou shalt save thyself and others that hear thee oh my oh my you say brother Samuel that that Paul was talking to ministers he let me tell you something whether or not you're you're a minister every one of us preach and I'm not talking about those who do it on Facebook I'm talking about that every one of us preach through our lives you understand what I'm saying every one of us you your life your life preaches sermons true you think I preach series your life prees series part 335 notice how brother R talks about this creative power everybody all right he said this creative power familiar point I want you to think about just this thought on the creative power of God I want you to think about what it is that's laying inside of you that's what the prophet would spend that time in the message in 1949 the deity of Jesus Christ to get the people to recognize what is in them right that same deity that created the heavens and the Earth lays inside of you the same God who who who who set forth and brought all of this is the same God that has created and brought forth a new creation in your life it's to dwell upon that the creative power of God brother B says with the token get ready apply it believe it clean up let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you it'll take an effect no let see it just let him see it let Lord help me me to get out of the way that that's all they can see am he goes on to say then apply the token in prayer with consideration with believing and with such love till you know it's going to take place it's going to take place apply it in confidence believing it's going to help and when you talk to that child notice now here's how the applying comes there's a confidence what's our confidence in it's not my confidence is is when I go talk to little Aaron he's going to turn around no I I it with confidence confidence in what confidence in God who is in you oh that's good that's where Satan many times gets us and we get frustrated because we've walked out and we're so enthused we have such confidence but our confidence God wants you to look to the god who's in you what he did in you he'll do for others God let me get so much in your hands let me so commit myself in your hands to where you take control Lord now when I go talk to him my confidence is in God my savior when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband talk to your wife talk to this loved one believe that it's going to help true so you've got to have a relationship it's got to be relationship and it's it's talk it's is talking believing it's going to help oh yeah absolutely right if I can just be that extension cord from right here and take it back where Brother Carlos is at here I am I'm I'm walking around right where it's at I've got something that I can apply to the situation I've got something I can't apply to it I can take it there but if I just leave the extension cord right there here he is back there in need but I know what's in me I I know what's in my life I know what's changed me and you see you what look what it's doing it's removing Confidence from our own selves and it's putting confidence in the word of God cuz heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail and God has given you a positive word and that positive word is what is on the inside of you he spoke the word is that right and then he raised the standard again the second time the word became flesh and then he raised it to a higher standard now it's flesh in you with the Holy Ghost oh yeah same God working what does it do it brings a positive experience in a positive God oh Hallelujah believe that it's going to help what what he said just stand there and say Lord I've claimed them they're mine I'm getting them for you Lord who's the mind you recognize that you're standing as an ambassador for Christ no hands but his hands no feet but his feet I'm standing here Lord and I'm claiming them for you they're mine but there all there's and Satan says but look how they are and look at the situation but they're mine look at the condition look at how terrible they are but they're mine you see there's got to be something in your heart like it was in moses' heart that's able to look past oh yeah the condition that Israel wasin and see the promise of God that God has given you it will not return back to him void amen it has produced in your life and it will work and it does work in you and through you oh yeah it's creative power that's working in our lives apply it and create that atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right into it if you've got the token you create a spirit around you a power that when you walk people know that you're a Christian we don't we don't have to have anything we don't have to have even symbols we don't have to have you know a cross I believe in having a cross in my car but it it we're not known by symbols the way as we our life is lived the way the life is lived the conduct the atmosphere the presence of God that's around us that that others cannot put their finger on what it is is but it's something about his presence that's what makes you and I different because we are made up with the same dirt calcium potish petroleum is everybody else but there's something different on the inside that's his presence and aren't you thankful there was a seed on the inside that could capture his presence aren't you think well there was a seed that pursued after his presence my I feel like preaching it was a seed in Jacob that that that that sought for the glory to be made manifest in his life what was that that seed of God it was that seed in Tamar that rose up and said I've got to have that life I've got to be one raised up to the name of my husband there was something operating within her nothing was going to stand in her way from that work of Kinsmen being fulfilled you know what that is that's why the prophet says it like this in unveiling of God and he's talking about how God has become one of us and he's talking about brought it right down to the present hour We're living and he speaks of how that God when God became man God became one of us God operating through the Flesh of his son Jesus Christ he was manifesting the attribute of Redeemer and savior and deliverer and it was not only temporal in other words that saving was not temporal once he saves you from your sins you can you can't go back once Redemption has been experienced you can't go back are you hearing me now I'm talking about something that now is no longer just a type but the antitype and now that same anointing Works Upon Our Life when now the prophet moves it to the place to showing us that where the word has become flesh in this hour you think about it if you can if we can just grasp this the work that God has done all the way down Through the Ages and then in this end time with the message of the hour it shows the power of the blood of Jesus Christ Glory because God can take vessels and he God works through redeemed vessels it shows the power of the blood to dismantle all that was against you it shows the power of the blood to break it all up and send it and scatter it away it shows the power of the blood to break every bit of sins hold it shows the power of the blood to bring you back to your rightful place in the Lamb's Book of Life That's The Power of coming under the blood that God would take a vessel without a seventh grade education and God was not ashamed to make his glory known and God's not ashamed to make his glory known through your life preach with with me now a minute think it not robbery to be equal with God that's the power of the blood of Jesus Christ that comes to loosen you from sin's Hope and it lets you know this is what God has always thought about you he's known about you you are one of his and he works through redeemed subjects to redeem the work of redemption goes on the work of redemption is working on it's going on it's going on that that that that that that that uh that that uh what do we call it in a race what do you call it in a track race a baton you pass a baton so it's like it goes from me and you pass it on and then the next one takes it runs a little bit passes it on passes it on that's what's happened down through the seven Church ages that's why the prophet said there was always an overlapping in the ages why it's a passing on of the Baton and in the end time what was they passing they were passing on that life and God said I will restore that life will come into the full resurrection power and glory in a people it's Redeemer anointing at work what is it that moves in your heart to go after your loved ones what is it that moves in your heart to go after others let me just say it like this they're outside of your circle somebody's got to be the Redeemer to go bring them in you hearing me now very simple these are these are very tremendous principles of redemption that God places in our hands for us what do we do Redeemer anointing you see what it is it works under reconciliation where did reconciliation start in the mind of God in the heart of God where does reconciliation start it starts in your heart the desire it begins in your heart forgiveness begins to work and there's a desire for reconciliation a desire for Harmony and God as we give to him he brings it all to pass God restores relationships God restores marriages God restores heart listen if he did look how many times how many times we heard brother Ram say if if if he if he that inspiration he says and I have heard but I see he said if that inspiration dropped to save you won't that same inspiration drop for healing in your body sir won't the same inspiration let me just say like this I want to just I'll just say it like this let's just make such a declaration from our hearts Lord I don't want no roadblocks on reconciliation I want my heart open to you because I can trust everything that God does I can put my foot on you you might tell me you buildt a set of stairs you might tell me you set out a ladder but I don't know you may not have put that ladder out all the way that ladder may not be able to handle my weight I don't know that but I do know one thing I can stand on I can stand on God's word and if I'm looking for God's word to be fulfilled then there's a place I can put my foot on cuz God's desire is for us to walk in shity in confidence and in stability amen you love him AB man I wish I had more time yes yes sir let me just try to try to wrap it here on this right here God works through man I say try to wrap it right here I some of you thinking what's the time when we on but I I don't want to give you I don't want to give too much of it God works through man I want you just to think of this here I want you to think of this just a moment I didn't put this quote up but I'm going to read it brother bramman says and God's gifts always find their places he said that he came to redeem the whole creation and nothing could do it but God himself that's the reason that God does nothing outside of a man he always works through a man because he had to use a man a man is what he had to use to display his attribute of Savior so God's not about to change his program now that's right brother Samuel look at me you're we're we're we're we're in the right spot we're in the right spot for him to use this God help us to continue look at me me Lord how how could you use me how could you use me but see that shows you the power of the blood yeah you see what the power of the blood is it ain't about just coming and getting something that's powerful enough to take care of every stain in your life it's about the power of the blood that's able to kill kill yes sin nature and that quickening power raises up that seed on the inside listen to me God will not be called an adulterer so he cannot marry a woman who's got a living husband are you hearing me now Romans 7 so what does he have to do he kills that old man not only is he divorced put away but he comes and he bring death comes to that man but then very quickly God raises up that seed on the inside and he ites himself with that life on the inside and so now that's why this is why like Rahab you can look back where are thine accusers there is none there is none that's what that's what the prophet tells us in souls in prison on and on and on you find such a beautiful thing as brother R says that and souls in prison what God has worked on all along is to get that first nature to agree with him him and then he kills it and then he raises up that which was always there on the inside don't you love him let me finish reading this quote here A man is what he had to use to redeem or to display his attribute of savior he had to make him in his image make him something like him and put him on free moral agency and let him act any way he wanted to act he could he could take his choice and he knew that man by giving him a choice would fall so being that he had to do that he turns back around and makes the man a partner to him and does nothing except he does it through a man the whole work of Redemption come by a man so the whole key is it's God doing it not us but it's God doing it oh brother BR said death come by the first man life come by the second Adam there you are he does nothing because he had to use a man for that and he uses a man to redeem back again so deity become a child he become in the form of sin that he might redeem The Sinner God has always and will always work through the agency of man man that he has redeemed in order to display his Redemption through don't you love him me to say Lord just flow through me Lord Lord Brother br will say in Christ the mystery he'll say in perfect Faith you're familiar with it he'll say as we receive the word we become the word am he says as he said what the faith of God is is that of a Believer is the faith of God that flows through us I just say Lord you know my responsibility as an extension cord my responsibility is not to produce electricity that's not it my responsibility your responsibility God never asked me Samuel heal somebody I can't no he never asked you and me hey Save Somebody I can't no but he said just be the extension cord that may be they're far out there but just be plugged into me so when it when when it would just get near just get near them and there's a point of contact there's virtue that's present there's strength that's available that they can draw from they can draw from maybe it's a dark storm and lights and everything else has gone out all around electricity's down like it was what was it some months ago and uh back in August when all that I was here that day and man trees and everything else coming down and man it was so dark and my how many people electricity um sister Judith y y'all's electricity was out for a long time time over there right there in Cleveland they were out and you know there's a lot of things let me tell you something we're living in a time of gross Darkness we're living in a time of Darkness but there's light in your dwelling there's light in Goan there's light in your life well me say it it don't it you know how in the world can this light handle the darkness no you misunderstand this place right in here could be ever so dark but if I strike one of them little matches out of a matchbook that light itself just that little tip will push back Darkness that's around it it don't have to be some great big light it just has to be a light and that's all God has called you and I to be I just want to be a light ye are lights just to what what what are we to show is to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we're not displaying a new gospel the message is not a new movement but the message itself is a restored relationship with the living Fountain of the Living God the fountain is open in the House of David Hallelujah there is Deliverance there is pardoning Saving Grace that's what our lives are an example of so let me just say sure we're ashamed from our past but let me say don't despise from where God has brought you because through your life God himself is declaring a testimony that there was nothing and no hold no circumstance that was greater that the blood of Jesus Christ can't take care of I said I was finished and this ain't even my notes Hallelujah it just goes on display just like when sister Dalton wrote wrote to to brother brandham and talked about she was so tore up about her illegitimate birth and brother brandham pinned out the letter I've got a copy of the letter pinned it out to her and wrote it back to her and brother Ram preaches it in the message he said the reason he said where they couldn't enter into the congregation of the Lord until that fourth generation or whatever it was he said cuz there wasn't nothing strong enough at that time the blood of bulls and goats couldn't do it he said but that was until the blood of Jesus come when the blood of Jesus come it's strong enough to take care of it hallelujah it's strong enough that there's not a habit there's nothing that can hold you back from being exiled from God the blood of Jesus Christ will go to work as we confess our sins it dismantles holds Lord oh my I'm just ready to preach right now I tell you get to talking about the blood of Jesus Christ oh my brother and sister that's why I said sister dton don't you fear he said the new birth takes care of the first birth boo devil amen boo devil you see look look what the atmosphere that atmosphere of Faith being created right around our lives you know what it's doing it's putting us in that position to operate as a vessel for the Savior to work through praise because when you know where you're standing you can stand right there you're you're not a you're not a You're Not Afraid when God leads you go speak to this one you question your heart or or call this this brother a seen this brother this sister you're not you're not worried you're just you're saying Lord I'm following your leading you said not to take any thought regarding the words that I would say but it'll be given to me what was needed you know Lord what they need whether they need a word whether they just need god with skin on it somebody hallelujah it's like when your battery is dead sometimes what you got to do is you got to get somebody else's car and you get somebody else's car and you ask them and say hey you got any jumper cables somebody else might say I don't got them but do you you say yeah I got some jumper cables and what do you do you hook them up and you get a you get a you get a jolt you get a jump is that right let me tell you something we are not Divided We are one body and the life of Jesus Christ is to flow through the body if I need a jump I Got Confidence there's quickening power in the body of Jesus Christ maybe I need a jump on my thoughts a jump on my attitude jump on I don't know but God knows what we have need of and when we have need of a jump he's there to give it he might give it through another brother or sister and then again brother brandom said that glorified body that we're going to step into he said that theoy he said it's right here in the meeting right now he said let it slip right up next to you and give you a fresh charge because he said it's not way out there somewhere he said we're just going to step from this realm into that realm woo Glory I'm talking about a savior oh glory be to God in the highest don't you love him woo Hallelujah there's no God like our God Amen none other beside me there's not somebody on the right and somebody on the left I looked and saw one that was Seated on the throne hallelujah amen amen oh my let's just stand and ask and just ask God's blessing amen you've got a need in your life his presence is here oh my he's here this he's here this evening those of you on by way of the internet you got a need in your body a need in your life right now let's just let's let's let's invite the Holy Spirit who's here amen the lifegiver amen let's just invite him to move right in maybe as you standing right next to a brother a sister a husband a wife and let's just let's lay hands on one another the prophet said that quickening power travels through the body from one Eagle to another Eagle oh Heavenly Father Lord God as we come before you this evening Lord we're
