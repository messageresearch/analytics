[11:15] and they applied the blood to be safe
[11:19] and uh he said the same thing's
[11:21] happening today

[11:24] and not come out
[11:25] and he said and the same thing needs to
[11:27] be done we need to apply the blood
[11:29] because if the blood

[31:29] it's a wonderful reality the love of god
[31:32] amen a love that cleanses us a love that

[31:42] love
[31:43] is rapturing us amen
[31:46] the same love amen
[31:49] well we're just so so happy to be here
[31:51] and we want to just turn our attention
[31:54] to the word but look could we just pray
[31:56] and just bow our hearts before the lord
[31:58] as we prepare to look into the word here
[32:00] this morning
[32:02] heavenly father it's just a lord a great
[32:06] privilege
[32:06] that you have given to us that we could
[32:09] be gathered together once again
[32:12] lord knowing that there's many needs we
[32:15] we have gathered here lord with a real
[32:18] purpose in our heart
[32:20] and lord that's true that's to see you
[32:23] i said we might look into the word we
[32:26] might take account of our lives
[32:28] dear god that we go out of here better
[32:31] people
[32:32] closer to you more determined
[32:35] strengthened
[32:36] encouraged in you
[32:39] so we ask the lord that you will help us
[32:41] because we know that it will take
[32:43] more than our mind to do that
[32:46] it will take a supernatural work
[32:50] of almighty god lord we believe that
[32:53] you're still the same god we believe
[32:56] lord that you still open eyes you still
[32:59] turn hearts
[33:01] you're still saved you still feel with
[33:02] the holy ghost you still heal
[33:04] lord you're still delivered you're still
[33:06] the same god
[33:08] so lord this is our expectation this
[33:10] morning
[33:12] we ask the lord you would just direct us
[33:14] now in your word we pray
[33:16] may we be sensitive may we o god our
[33:19] hearts be open
[33:22] may we be moved in you lord i pray in
[33:25] jesus precious name
[33:26] amen amen first corinthians chapter 10
[33:30] is where i'd like to
[33:31] to start here
[33:38] i want to go to verse verse 1 and we'll
[33:40] read a few verses and then let you have
[33:42] your
[33:44] your seats
[33:51] in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 1
[33:57] moreover brethren i would not that you
[34:01] should be
[34:02] ignorant i mean he's grateful that god's
[34:05] desire is not for us to be ignorant
[34:07] it's to be mindful of where we're at the
[34:10] hour we're in
[34:11] to also to have that understanding of
[34:14] our walk and where we are
[34:17] i would not that ye should be ignorant
[34:20] how that all our fathers were under the
[34:23] cloud
[34:24] and all passed through the sea and were
[34:27] all baptized
[34:28] unto moses in the cloud and in the sea
[34:32] in other words they had committed to the
[34:34] direction
[34:36] that moses was leading them we know it
[34:39] wasn't
[34:39] moses as the man but god makes known his
[34:43] will
[34:43] his word his leadership god will take it
[34:48] comes into the word for that hour and
[34:50] god has a vessel
[34:52] that is set aside and there are vessels
[34:55] that receive
[34:56] that same leadership that was present
[34:59] in the life of the messenger so they've
[35:02] committed to this is what paul was
[35:04] saying
[35:04] they committed this to receive
[35:07] that direction that come through moses
[35:10] we're all baptized unto moses
[35:12] in the cloud and in the sea and did all
[35:16] eat the same spiritual
[35:19] meat when you think of it this was not
[35:23] they didn't you know this wasn't like
[35:25] going to a fair
[35:27] and there's all kinds of food stands
[35:30] this wasn't out there i know it's a
[35:31] simple but it wasn't out there
[35:34] who provided what they had need of god
[35:37] did
[35:39] the same god that brought them that sent
[35:41] the messenger
[35:42] with a message and the pillar of fire to
[35:45] confirm the promise
[35:47] is the same god was letting him know i'm
[35:49] your provider
[35:51] he had everything taken care of
[35:57] and did all drink the same spiritual
[36:00] drink amen god brought the manna
[36:04] god brought even the water from the rock
[36:06] it was spiritual
[36:08] it was spiritual it was god providing
[36:11] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[36:13] that followed them
[36:15] and that rock was christ you see
[36:18] many of them could have looked at the
[36:20] rock and looked at the manna and they
[36:21] just looked at it as something you walk
[36:23] you take or you drink and they looked at
[36:26] what came out in the natural
[36:28] but they failed to recognize who is it
[36:30] that's bringing this about
[36:32] why is he doing this so they failed
[36:36] they failed to connect what was actually
[36:38] going on
[36:41] but with many of them god was not
[36:45] well pleased for they were overthrown
[36:49] in the wilderness i'd like to continue
[36:53] to speak to you this
[36:54] morning on in that thought we were
[36:56] looking at the admonition
[36:58] to the spiritual mind may god bless you
[37:00] as you're being seated
[37:02] and i'd like to continue to read in this
[37:04] on this portion of it and uh
[37:08] just very intentional upon these these
[37:10] points just feeling just to move through
[37:12] this
[37:14] and we know that it's very it's a great
[37:16] blessing
[37:18] uh to have that
[37:22] of a spiritual mind and to recognize
[37:25] that even before
[37:28] you are where you are today if you hear
[37:31] a setting here and
[37:33] no matter where you're at whether you're
[37:35] in journey
[37:36] into the promised land to receive the
[37:39] holy ghost or you have
[37:40] already received the holy ghost there
[37:42] was always that part about you
[37:45] that was spiritual that did not come
[37:49] in the new birth that the spiritual part
[37:52] was already there
[37:54] jacob before he ever came to bethel
[37:58] jacob was already spiritual
[38:02] esau had no
[38:06] value to him for this birthright
[38:10] he sold it you see it would be one thing
[38:14] if you could think whatever might be of
[38:16] a value of a cost
[38:18] but to show you how lightly when god
[38:20] said he lightly esteemed it
[38:22] he sold it for a mess of pottage
[38:26] which was something to satisfy an
[38:30] earthly carnal desire
[38:34] but jacob was spiritual he
[38:38] wanted that birthright
[38:41] all the odds were against him
[38:46] there is absolutely no way if we're just
[38:49] looking at it in natural there's no way
[38:53] that jacob would be able to receive
[38:56] that birthright that which belonged to
[38:59] the firstborn
[39:01] we bring it down to you and i the odds
[39:05] were against us we were without hope
[39:11] let me just say it like this even though
[39:13] the jews had the covenants and the
[39:15] adoption that was spoke to them
[39:17] but they were hopeless without
[39:21] him coming and bringing them into that
[39:25] you see nobody could bring us into this
[39:28] promise
[39:29] outside of the lord jesus christ himself
[39:34] there was no man could do it no man
[39:35] knowing heaven nor on earth
[39:37] no one could do it but jacob was
[39:40] spiritual
[39:41] he was moved beyond all
[39:44] of the things that were around him that
[39:47] would tell him
[39:48] what are you doing this is not possible
[39:50] you'll never receive it
[39:52] i mean it's not even allotted to you
[39:54] look it's not even according to the law
[39:56] but there was a law of god already
[39:59] pulsating on the inside
[40:01] jacob just didn't know how to possess
[40:04] that law yet
[40:06] are you with me as the son and daughter
[40:08] of god you were always the son and
[40:10] daughter of god
[40:11] but you did not know how to possess that
[40:13] law but it took
[40:14] one of our own kind coming to you and i
[40:18] in order to restore this bride tree in
[40:21] order to restore us
[40:22] back to a place to where now we possess
[40:25] that law
[40:26] on the inside well law am i talking
[40:28] about
[40:29] the law of god as a son and daughter of
[40:31] god
[40:32] you're not trying to conduct yourself as
[40:34] a son and daughter of god
[40:35] it's a life within you
[40:39] jacob was already spiritual
[40:42] even within everything that was around
[40:45] him so the spiritual part is we're
[40:47] looking at this even here
[40:49] this morning a spiritual mind and you
[40:52] find
[40:53] how that paul would write of this
[40:56] here in the scripture and it's not paul
[40:59] think of it paul himself he
[41:02] knew exactly it wasn't my knowledge
[41:05] but this experience that he had received
[41:07] because paul was among those pharisees
[41:09] he had his training he had his teaching
[41:12] he had his same belief remember he was a
[41:14] persecutor
[41:15] of this way he came against that of the
[41:18] church of the living god
[41:21] but yet paul was spiritual
[41:24] but yet within that he was persecuting
[41:28] the church of the living god
[41:30] you see he needed help he needed
[41:32] alignment
[41:33] he needed god to come and let him see
[41:37] the very thing that you really desire
[41:40] and you're looking forward to it's been
[41:42] a fulfillment
[41:43] and god comes to him and makes it known
[41:46] to him and when god reveals
[41:48] it he doesn't have to teach paul paul do
[41:50] this and paul do that
[41:52] but paul he just lays it down and he
[41:54] says
[41:55] what would you have me to do
[41:59] what was that it was the inside
[42:01] spiritual man
[42:02] that no longer was walking by the orders
[42:05] of the sanhedrin
[42:07] he had received higher orders he had
[42:10] received orders
[42:11] of a heavenly voice that now has
[42:14] thundered on earth and
[42:16] spoke to his life it superseded
[42:20] all other orders just like when god has
[42:23] spoke to your life
[42:24] it supersedes your natural family tree
[42:27] it supersedes everything why because the
[42:31] abstract
[42:32] ties you back in not to a family tree
[42:35] but to the tree of life
[42:38] [Music]
[42:40] hallelujah and paul having that
[42:43] experience remember when jesus stood
[42:46] there with the pharisees
[42:48] and you know this they were letting know
[42:52] their pedigree you know like they have a
[42:56] horse or whatever morning you know
[42:58] they're letting the horse know you know
[42:59] the horse this is this pedigree and
[43:01] this is his dad and this is his mom
[43:04] right
[43:05] like when you know i went to buy a dog i
[43:07] want to know what what what's what's the
[43:09] dad like what's the mom like
[43:13] i want to know i mean if they're crazy
[43:15] and nutty i don't want them
[43:17] because this thing travels on down
[43:21] boy we could preach here couldn't we
[43:25] we got crazies and nuts in our families
[43:28] and we came with those jeans but there
[43:29] was another gene on the inside
[43:35] god did not unite with that gene of the
[43:37] natural birth
[43:38] but god came and gave spiritual birth to
[43:41] that
[43:41] gene that was on the inside the world
[43:45] thinks we're crazy
[43:47] the world thinks we're an oddball the
[43:49] world thinks we're a nut
[43:50] but what it is is we've been threaded
[43:53] amen
[43:55] we've been threaded to the right nut
[43:59] amen glory be to god
[44:02] and here jesus said remember their
[44:06] pedigree that they're standing on
[44:08] our fathers didn't eat manna in the
[44:10] wilderness and jesus said
[44:11] and they're everyone dead he was not
[44:15] talking about just
[44:16] you know buried he spoke spiritually
[44:20] see jesus was speaking standing here and
[44:23] here god was veiled in a body of flesh
[44:26] they were hearing him
[44:28] with natural ears they were not hearing
[44:32] with spiritual ears
[44:35] this is why they withstood him regarding
[44:38] the sabbath
[44:39] why because even in reading of the
[44:41] sabbath they didn't have understanding
[44:44] they could quote it they could read it
[44:45] but they didn't have understanding
[44:48] and jesus said they're everyone dead
[44:50] they're eternally
[44:52] lost
[44:56] now as we look here in the scripture
[44:59] let's read just a little bit further in
[45:01] this
[45:02] in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 6
[45:05] let's keep going
[45:06] now these things were our examples
[45:10] to the intent we should not lust
[45:14] after evil things as they also lusted
[45:17] now let me just
[45:18] make some some points here on this
[45:21] remember
[45:22] there was their desire we want meat
[45:25] we're tired of this manna
[45:28] who was that about them
[45:34] selfish desires were still present
[45:37] they were walking in the word but they
[45:40] still had
[45:40] selfish desires and everything
[45:44] was about them
[45:48] let me just say this very clearly
[45:52] the heart's desire of a believer is to
[45:54] be fully
[45:55] in the word let me say we we we need
[45:59] uh we need encouragement in the word we
[46:01] need to the word to be rightfully
[46:04] divided we need it to be rightfully
[46:06] divided in our life
[46:07] sometimes and i'll say this even to the
[46:09] spiritual mind
[46:10] you can sometimes get in a rut and you
[46:12] start pondering you start thinking
[46:14] and if you keep going in that manner and
[46:16] you start thinking in the negative
[46:17] the enemy can step right in there and
[46:19] then you find yourself
[46:20] under a cloud of doubt but you see this
[46:23] is where the word
[46:24] must be rightfully divided and the holy
[46:28] spirit in you and i he rightfully
[46:30] divides the word
[46:31] but we've got to rest on him to
[46:34] interpret that word
[46:36] sometimes if we've come here there when
[46:39] the holy spirit has come
[46:40] he'll come and he'll break that word he
[46:43] breaks it like he broke the bread before
[46:45] like he's opened and unveiled himself in
[46:47] our life to let us know who we are
[46:50] in that experience within our life and
[46:52] then he breaks that word and we say oh
[46:54] now i see it and what happens the cloud
[46:56] the darkness it goes away
[47:00] but they were asking things and it was
[47:02] all about them
[47:05] it wasn't enough it had nothing to do
[47:08] with the furtherance of the
[47:10] word you see what should have been first
[47:13] was the promise depends on what you're
[47:16] feeding on
[47:19] who wins white dog or black dog depends
[47:21] on which one's feeding
[47:24] and you still have to walk and live in
[47:25] this natural life
[47:27] as much as you would like you and i
[47:28] would like to check out of it there's
[47:30] things that comes
[47:30] comes my pathway i'm sure is yours and
[47:32] you know what it's like i don't i don't
[47:34] i don't feel like giving time to that
[47:36] right now
[47:38] anybody else feel that way sometimes we
[47:41] want
[47:41] we won't create a list because i'm sure
[47:43] you've got yours and i've got mine
[47:45] sometimes we look i don't feel like
[47:46] giving time to this but we realize
[47:48] there's things that we have to attend to
[47:50] in the natural but yet this this is
[47:53] where it comes to a place
[47:55] we do not want to be so occupied to
[47:58] where
[47:58] that christ is second or last place in
[48:01] our life
[48:02] but he's to be the first place in our
[48:04] life that's not just something we
[48:06] say it's what comes out and is expressed
[48:09] and lived out in our life that a person
[48:12] can see
[48:13] it's brother brown would say it make it
[48:14] so clear he said
[48:16] your life he said as a christian he said
[48:18] if you're truly a spirit-filled
[48:20] christian
[48:21] he said you your neighbor will truly
[48:24] know it
[48:26] i know it isn't going to be necessarily
[48:28] your neighbor is going to come over and
[48:29] say hey i know you believe the message
[48:31] of the hour
[48:32] i know you're a spiritual christian you
[48:33] know what it is they know something's
[48:34] different about you
[48:36] is that right they can't put a finger
[48:38] what church you go to what denomination
[48:40] you belong to
[48:41] denomination don't change me a church
[48:44] didn't change me changed you
[48:48] the same one paul met
[48:50] [Applause]
[48:52] the same one this message came to
[48:54] introduce me to
[48:55] and bring me into union with
[48:59] glory be to god verse 7
[49:04] neither be ye idolaters
[49:08] as were some of them as it is written
[49:11] notice the people sat down
[49:14] to eat and drink and rose up to play
[49:19] brother brandon would take this this
[49:21] this quote
[49:22] or the scripture and he says a person
[49:24] can say
[49:25] bless god i'm not an idolater the
[49:28] brahman said oh no
[49:29] no no no he said all you have to be
[49:32] is idle i-d-l-e
[49:35] in other words not going anywhere
[49:39] and whatever is an idol what is an idol
[49:42] it cannot hear it cannot see
[49:45] right an idle you got to pick it up put
[49:48] it down
[49:49] carry it here carry it there but see
[49:51] god's desire
[49:52] is not we're not packing around the
[49:55] message
[49:56] but the messages inside of us it's the
[49:59] spirit of god
[50:00] moving in out packing his word
[50:04] see to be idle you see idol itself it's
[50:06] just to be setting down brother brahma
[50:08] says you come to church go home and you
[50:10] do nothing about it let me just say this
[50:12] it's where we give our lives to god and
[50:14] you may not
[50:15] understand everything that's going on
[50:17] and let me just clue clue you in a
[50:19] moment
[50:19] don't look at it like oh my goodness you
[50:21] know if it was like brother samuel
[50:23] or so and so my goodness look how very
[50:25] many oh look you don't understand it
[50:27] cast
[50:27] down imaginations that is not helping
[50:31] you at all
[50:32] but what is it it's to recognize who's
[50:34] speaking to you
[50:36] and to recognize that word and say god
[50:39] let that word be
[50:40] formed in my life like david over and
[50:43] over and over and over
[50:45] you read it in the psalms quicken thou
[50:47] me according to that word quicken thou
[50:49] me according to that word
[50:50] quicken down me then i might live out
[50:52] thy word oh god
[50:54] we want it to be alive in us this is why
[50:58] after a service
[50:59] this is why as we go through we don't
[51:01] just leave it here
[51:02] but we go out
[51:06] we're reading we're reading
[51:10] realities of why they were overthrown
[51:16] no the bible says neither let us commit
[51:19] fornication as some of them committed
[51:22] and fell in one day three and twenty
[51:24] thousand remember they went up to the
[51:25] feast of bel pior
[51:28] why go to the feast of baal pior
[51:31] god said you're a separate people
[51:34] what does what does the feast of baal
[51:37] pure you're not called to that feast
[51:39] god brought you out of egypt that you
[51:41] might have a feast with him
[51:45] it's not it's it's you're done with the
[51:47] world it's like elisha you
[51:49] burn every bridge that's behind you
[51:52] you're done you're finished you see
[51:56] this is where what what more i'm just
[51:59] saying very plainly
[52:00] where else it's to whom shall we go
[52:04] i'm not looking for anything else
[52:08] this message has revealed to me jesus
[52:10] christ
[52:11] and i see who i am let me just say the
[52:14] ministering of this word
[52:15] supernaturally has been the vows upon my
[52:19] soul
[52:20] the coming of the holy spirit to unite
[52:23] us
[52:24] to him in union
[52:28] we're not looking for another message
[52:31] sure a lot of
[52:32] sure a lot of great men has god used men
[52:34] god has used men but
[52:36] to recognize when god sends a message
[52:38] that message is to call us
[52:40] back to the word back to the character
[52:43] of the living god
[52:46] oh my neither commit fornication they
[52:49] they went and they forsook
[52:52] their love and their devotion brother
[52:56] brahm uses the scripture
[52:58] and he'll speak of like how's a husband
[53:01] and a wi-fi
[53:02] he said brother brown said how would it
[53:04] feel he said let's just examine the
[53:05] scripture
[53:06] in terms of your relationship with your
[53:08] wife how would it feel
[53:10] he said if your wife only came once in a
[53:14] great while
[53:15] and put her hand on your hand and say
[53:17] honey i love you
[53:24] samuel that's all mushy brother bam said
[53:26] never let the honeymoon die
[53:32] i like god being mushy on me i like
[53:34] being mushy on him
[53:38] are you with me it's like you know
[53:40] marriage of course i know every vehicle
[53:42] now has those consoles they're pretty
[53:43] nice you can rest your arm
[53:44] charge your phone and all that stuff too
[53:46] and you know
[53:48] but man back in the days it was a
[53:50] straight bench you know
[53:53] you got married and she sat right there
[53:55] beside you
[54:00] but then things start coming starts
[54:02] drifting
[54:04] cares of life things are drifting that's
[54:07] why there has to be times
[54:08] of reuniting amen
[54:12] that that's very much in the natural in
[54:14] that of husband and wife
[54:16] it's purposeful you see you take account
[54:18] it's like when you tell
[54:19] your wife and say hey wait wait wait
[54:21] wait honey or a wife tells her husband
[54:23] hey honey
[54:24] can we talk not just keep going on but
[54:27] you sit down and you recognize
[54:28] something's wrong
[54:30] that's spiritual discernment
[54:33] well we're getting quiet in here maybe i
[54:35] need to come down here and preach today
[54:38] it's it's reflection because sometimes
[54:40] there's things that get out of line
[54:42] and it's got to be brought back in line
[54:44] and the only way it gets brought back in
[54:46] line
[54:46] you've got to have some real honest open
[54:50] communion
[54:53] feelings can get in the way everything
[54:55] else but this is where there's got to be
[54:57] some open
[54:58] honest communion for what reconciling
[55:02] preach brother samuel
[55:06] of laying down man i don't know we just
[55:14] i'm saying but that don't have nothing
[55:15] to do with it then why did god have paul
[55:19] take time not only with the corinthian
[55:22] church
[55:22] with the colossian church and with the
[55:24] ephesian church
[55:26] amen because sometimes the things that
[55:29] we look at are lit
[55:30] as little things are the very things
[55:32] that are hindering
[55:34] god from moving greater
[55:39] neither neither commit fornication let
[55:42] the love and devotion
[55:43] be to him and him alone i mean friends
[55:46] listen you understand you can
[55:48] tell where people's love is just watch
[55:51] their life
[55:52] you can tell where their love is right
[55:56] people never miss work but they miss
[55:59] church like nothing
[56:03] and brother branham told us he said you
[56:05] can miss a day of work now he wasn't
[56:07] giving you know something your union
[56:08] hasn't bargained for but
[56:09] what he was saying is he said you can do
[56:11] that but don't you miss
[56:13] church it's value
[56:17] it's it's a value you place on it you
[56:19] know how you can tell people you can say
[56:21] everything
[56:21] but it's the value whatever you value
[56:24] will come out
[56:25] in your life
[56:30] i know sometimes it's just like when you
[56:32] we speak of these things
[56:35] when when we we we we're looking at it
[56:38] i think these are things that we have to
[56:40] be very
[56:41] uh mindful of and to know exactly
[56:45] what god's desire is in our life notice
[56:48] he goes on to say let me read these
[56:50] verses here
[56:51] neither let us tempt christ as some of
[56:53] them also tempted
[56:54] and were destroyed of serpents how did
[56:56] they tempt christ
[56:58] they spoke against moses and the word
[57:05] some of these things you wonder you look
[57:08] at it
[57:08] and you say how in the world could they
[57:11] even say anything
[57:12] i mean when's the last time you walk
[57:13] through a parted sea
[57:16] i mean you get up every morning just
[57:17] walk through a parted sea they've
[57:19] already
[57:19] already been through the red sea when's
[57:22] the last time
[57:23] you saw a national power defeated
[57:26] not with a mighty army but with a
[57:29] simple humble man anointed with god
[57:33] a prophet that the pillar of fire was
[57:36] vindicated through
[57:37] when's the last time you saw that
[57:41] it's not a god of history it's a god of
[57:43] the i am
[57:44] [Applause]
[57:50] how could you speak against moses
[57:54] how could you speak against him how
[57:56] could you speak against
[57:57] how could you speak against god you
[57:59] recognize when they spoke against moses
[58:01] god said i'm taking that personally
[58:03] because that's the veil
[58:04] that i'm veiled in that's the veil that
[58:08] i've chosen
[58:09] to vindicate my word through
[58:14] i am his credentials
[58:18] this is what god was saying i am his
[58:20] credentials
[58:21] this is why it's not the word of a man
[58:24] coming to you and i
[58:25] it's not the word of a man a word of a
[58:27] man stir you up in your reasoning but
[58:29] the word of god
[58:30] it searches through the depths of our
[58:32] heart it causes us to reflect
[58:34] and he gives us strength and courage to
[58:37] rise above every doubt
[58:39] and every unbelief what is that that's
[58:41] god's credentials of himself
[58:51] neither murmur murmur ye
[58:54] as some of them also murmured and were
[58:57] destroyed of the destroyer every time
[59:00] attached to trial something came along
[59:03] oh no not this again
[59:09] how many times we repented of that
[59:12] i didn't fix that thing two weeks ago
[59:14] now it's
[59:16] right or maybe it's something else that
[59:18] comes along you you understand what i'm
[59:19] saying
[59:22] neither murmur you they they were
[59:23] murmuring what were they what was the
[59:25] murmuring about
[59:26] they were offended at what was taking
[59:30] place around them
[59:33] like moses god
[59:36] i've been following you why is sickness
[59:39] coming
[59:41] why is this coming i mean i'm your child
[59:44] i'm the elect i'm the royal seed and god
[59:47] says
[59:48] uh-huh but for me to bring that out
[59:55] my strength is made perfect
[59:58] in your weakness
[1:00:03] and god said i will take sickness
[1:00:06] from among you they came to the waters
[1:00:10] of morrow
[1:00:10] god showed up and let him see something
[1:00:13] that was standing there that they
[1:00:14] probably here they are oh
[1:00:15] this water's terrible oh this water is
[1:00:17] terrible and here
[1:00:19] was a little bush not a great big
[1:00:22] stained glass
[1:00:25] something a simple little bush
[1:00:30] a tree and moses was directed of god
[1:00:34] to get the tree and go take it
[1:00:37] cut that and place it in the water
[1:00:39] speaking of
[1:00:40] placing the atonement in the word in
[1:00:43] that of the lives of the people because
[1:00:45] water speaks
[1:00:46] of multitudes of people is that right
[1:00:50] placing the atonement the atonement is
[1:00:52] there and ever present to minister to
[1:00:55] our needs he's not just a god who saved
[1:00:57] your soul
[1:00:58] and filled you with the holy ghost but
[1:01:00] that's his commitment to say
[1:01:01] i've got everything taken care of
[1:01:05] for you i will see
[1:01:08] you through
[1:01:13] that's some meat to feed on
[1:01:18] oh my now all these things happened unto
[1:01:22] them for end samples and they were
[1:01:24] written for our admonition
[1:01:26] upon whom the ends of the world will
[1:01:28] come notice they were these were wrote
[1:01:30] for our admonition
[1:01:34] wherefore look at this in verse 12.
[1:01:37] wherefore let him
[1:01:38] that thinketh he standeth take heed lest
[1:01:41] he fall
[1:01:43] what's paul speaking of
[1:01:47] where a person becomes confident
[1:01:50] in things outside of the word
[1:01:53] being inside of them there is
[1:01:57] no other ground that is solid ground
[1:02:01] outside of the revelation of jesus
[1:02:03] christ
[1:02:04] in our soul to know who
[1:02:07] we are there's no other ground you can't
[1:02:09] stand upon sensation
[1:02:11] you cannot stand upon what i have gifts
[1:02:13] or or i can preach or
[1:02:14] my i can shout no there's no other
[1:02:16] ground that stands on
[1:02:18] that kind of a ground to say well you
[1:02:19] know i enjoy the word my
[1:02:21] you know i've got joy there's no other
[1:02:23] ground to stand upon
[1:02:25] outside of that solid ground of the word
[1:02:29] inside of you and you are inside of him
[1:02:31] that solid ground
[1:02:33] upon that ground you can face anything
[1:02:36] because greater is he that is in you
[1:02:40] than he that's in the world
[1:02:43] so my thoughts as a man thinketh in his
[1:02:46] heart my
[1:02:46] thoughts are not based upon these things
[1:02:50] out here
[1:02:52] but it's simply based on the simplicity
[1:02:54] of
[1:02:55] i know where i was hallelujah and i know
[1:02:59] where he brought me to
[1:03:00] amen i know what he's done for me
[1:03:04] and that his love that part that he
[1:03:06] sowed on the inside of my life
[1:03:08] it has captured
[1:03:11] where the rest of the world said get out
[1:03:14] but on the inside that part that said
[1:03:16] have you seen my beloved have you seen
[1:03:19] my beloved
[1:03:20] can you tell me where my beloved is at
[1:03:23] that show on the inside where was it it
[1:03:25] was a place
[1:03:26] that was calling out for the word it was
[1:03:29] a womb that was already ordained
[1:03:31] for the word to come into and he was
[1:03:34] calling this is a place of rest
[1:03:37] this is a place of rest come o great
[1:03:39] dove
[1:03:40] come dove into my soul that rest this is
[1:03:44] a place of rest
[1:03:45] [Music]
[1:03:50] amen let every man take heed
[1:04:02] this is why branham would take
[1:04:06] and spend so much time here within even
[1:04:08] this chapter
[1:04:10] verse 13 there hath no temptation taken
[1:04:13] you
[1:04:14] but such is common to man
[1:04:18] oh brother samuel i would have made it
[1:04:20] how would have made it
[1:04:21] but you don't know what the devil no no
[1:04:23] no
[1:04:25] whatever came anybody's way it wasn't
[1:04:28] because it was above what any man could
[1:04:30] be tested
[1:04:34] it came but the reality
[1:04:38] it wasn't the test that brought you out
[1:04:42] it wasn't the trial oh this trial this
[1:04:44] trial took him out the trial didn't take
[1:04:46] nobody out
[1:04:47] all right come on somebody the chester
[1:04:50] the trial
[1:04:51] where lot's wife was walking it wasn't
[1:04:52] the tester trial that turned her around
[1:04:55] it was her heart was not fully
[1:04:57] surrendered to god
[1:05:00] the devil wants to make it so hard and
[1:05:02] you know the reality is
[1:05:04] it's not about you being a better moral
[1:05:07] person
[1:05:08] the word calls to that are you with me
[1:05:11] but that's not
[1:05:12] christianity christianity is where you
[1:05:16] are
[1:05:17] zeroed in and united with god
[1:05:22] well that person says well i don't drink
[1:05:23] no more praise god there's more to
[1:05:25] overcoming than just drinking
[1:05:27] i don't smoke no more praise god there's
[1:05:29] more to overcoming than just not spoken
[1:05:33] we're talking about the overcoming life
[1:05:36] on the inside of you
[1:05:37] where you and christ are no longer twain
[1:05:40] but you are
[1:05:40] one
[1:05:45] the scriptures speak of this great love
[1:05:48] story
[1:05:49] all the way through right
[1:05:53] it's the plan of redemption unfolding
[1:05:55] it's the secret god
[1:05:57] has laid out all the way through
[1:06:00] he even wrote it in the heavens
[1:06:04] he wrote it all the way through it's a
[1:06:06] secret
[1:06:07] but he's unfolded that secret slowly
[1:06:11] slowly unfolding it through lies
[1:06:16] if you catch that that ought to be
[1:06:18] something that's a very great
[1:06:20] encouragement for your life amen god
[1:06:24] doesn't unfold quickly
[1:06:27] he unfolds himself slowly
[1:06:33] the wheels of prophecy turn slow
[1:06:37] but sure and your life
[1:06:42] is a prophecy it's now made known
[1:06:46] in the word amen
[1:06:50] there's things you see about your life
[1:06:52] now that you never saw before
[1:06:55] even the clarity oh no you could say
[1:06:57] maybe years ago 5 10
[1:06:59] 20 30 years ago oh i know i'm a son of
[1:07:02] god but that reality has become more
[1:07:04] real
[1:07:06] it's become more real and it keeps on
[1:07:09] becoming more real
[1:07:11] the prophet stood at eagle rock and he
[1:07:14] makes this
[1:07:14] declaration he says oh god that you have
[1:07:17] opened your word
[1:07:19] he said this has led me to a faith i
[1:07:22] never had before
[1:07:24] 1965 why our faith grows
[1:07:27] our faith grows our faith grows just
[1:07:30] like your faith
[1:07:31] will grow in a service
[1:07:34] that's the same thing that's happening
[1:07:36] in the expanse of our lives spiritually
[1:07:42] oh but i love this next part but
[1:07:45] god is faithful somebody say that
[1:07:56] not was yes
[1:08:01] brother greg he is yeah he watched
[1:08:04] but he did once yes

[1:08:13] and he that was and he that is is the
[1:08:14] same that shall be
[1:08:17] when is that it's a revelation of jesus
[1:08:19] christ
[1:08:21] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:08:24] above
[1:08:24] that you're able but i tell you that's
[1:08:26] something to hang on to and say god
[1:08:28] i i feel like this would be on me but
[1:08:30] you see what i can't see
[1:08:33] give me grace to go through this lord
[1:08:36] but will with oh i like that will with
[1:08:39] the temptation
[1:08:40] also make a way to escape that you might
[1:08:43] be able
[1:08:44] to bear it amen hallelujah
[1:08:48] wherefore my dearly beloved flee from
[1:08:50] idolatry
[1:08:52] he said i speak as to wise men are we
[1:08:56] wise this morning
[1:08:58] hallelujah judging
[1:09:01] what i say you see
[1:09:06] they were all partakers of spiritual
[1:09:09] things
[1:09:11] brother brown said they could sit and
[1:09:12] enjoy hearing the word preached
[1:09:16] they could even have joy oh
[1:09:20] speak in tongues prophesy
[1:09:23] shall sing they were partaking
[1:09:28] of spiritual meat
[1:09:31] you know they could say that's quail it
[1:09:34] was spiritual
[1:09:35] that quail was not there god provided
[1:09:40] that water oh that was just water i know
[1:09:42] i drank that water it refreshed me
[1:09:44] but it was all spiritual
[1:09:49] who i don't want to say in their right
[1:09:51] mind but who in their mind would say
[1:09:53] hey you're thirsty brother joyce says
[1:09:56] man yeah
[1:09:57] i'm awful hot man i'm thirsty here
[1:09:59] brother joey let's go to this rock and
[1:10:01] get some water
[1:10:02] rock right
[1:10:05] but sam i thought she was maybe 10 i
[1:10:07] think you had a whale somewhere
[1:10:09] or let's go some but see god
[1:10:13] hides in simplicity
[1:10:17] amen he is a fountain in a dry and
[1:10:20] thirsty land
[1:10:24] there might be times that dryness comes
[1:10:26] about your life but let me just tell you
[1:10:28] look to him because he is there with you
[1:10:31] and say god
[1:10:32] where is this place of oasis lord you've
[1:10:35] led me through this
[1:10:36] hot desert and in the desert is where
[1:10:39] prophets are molded in deserts is where
[1:10:42] his children are molded
[1:10:43] god you know i got need openness and
[1:10:46] nourishment
[1:10:47] and sustainment you've led me here and i
[1:10:49] don't want to run from here
[1:10:51] i want to receive what it is you're
[1:10:53] trying to mold in my life
[1:10:55] but i need some strength lord
[1:10:59] that's eating on the word that's looking
[1:11:01] to him
[1:11:03] that's not murmuring that's looking to
[1:11:05] him who is your all-sufficiency
[1:11:09] because our flesh is just like any other
[1:11:11] flesh if it be possible
[1:11:20] they were all partakers of spiritual
[1:11:22] things this is where
[1:11:24] it comes they failed to spiritually
[1:11:28] discern
[1:11:31] who was in their midst teaching does not
[1:11:33] bring discernment
[1:11:34] teaching of the spirit as far as where
[1:11:36] the spirit reveals
[1:11:38] brings discernment but just teaching
[1:11:40] alone does not bring discernment
[1:11:42] are you asking me discernment comes by
[1:11:45] the spirit of god
[1:11:47] when the holy ghost comes in a meeting
[1:11:50] and he comes through the word he gets in
[1:11:52] his brother bram said in god of civil
[1:11:53] age he said
[1:11:54] he gets in the word he begins to uncover
[1:11:56] satan
[1:11:57] amen he begins to reveal
[1:12:01] he begins to take the cover off he
[1:12:02] begins to expose him
[1:12:04] he begins to come and give courage he
[1:12:06] begins to come
[1:12:07] and give strength what was it those
[1:12:09] nutrients were already there within the
[1:12:11] word you here you are carrying it around
[1:12:14] and the nutrients already there but what
[1:12:15] happens he comes and the fire comes upon
[1:12:18] the lamb
[1:12:19] and then with that word that you've read
[1:12:21] and it might have been something you
[1:12:23] read
[1:12:23] even in devotion this morning and it's
[1:12:25] something that caught you
[1:12:26] but now what is it it's the spirit of
[1:12:28] god it's almost like you knowing what's
[1:12:30] on the menu
[1:12:31] and now the spirit of god said now it's
[1:12:34] time
[1:12:34] for that rail that lamb to be roasted
[1:12:37] with fire oh that's a wonderful thing
[1:12:42] but we also have to eat the pertinents
[1:12:44] thereof
[1:12:45] and when we leave out of here brother
[1:12:47] and this is where we got to eat it with
[1:12:48] bitter herbs
[1:12:50] this is where we're eating the lamb now
[1:12:51] it comes by experience
[1:12:53] it comes to dying out
[1:12:56] it comes just giving ourselves to the
[1:12:58] word
[1:13:00] not just walking away my that was a my
[1:13:02] what a service but did you recognize
[1:13:04] who's in our midst
[1:13:06] hallelujah that's keith did you
[1:13:08] recognize who was in our midst
[1:13:11] did you recognize what was what was
[1:13:13] being said i'm not saying you understood
[1:13:14] it all
[1:13:15] i the main important thing is you
[1:13:17] recognize who's in our midst
[1:13:19] it's something that's drawing you in you
[1:13:22] see it's drawing you
[1:13:23] beyond you we need to be
[1:13:27] challenged beyond our own thinking
[1:13:30] our own thinking remember it's carnal it
[1:13:33] limits us
[1:13:33] it's a sound barrier but there is a wind
[1:13:37] there is a force
[1:13:38] there is a strength that comes to lift
[1:13:41] us
[1:13:41] beyond that sound barrier
[1:13:46] what is that the mind of christ setting
[1:13:47] down
[1:13:51] they failed to they failed to discern
[1:13:53] who was in their midst
[1:13:56] they failed to discern his faithfulness
[1:13:58] to his word of promise brother bryan
[1:14:00] when when he showed up
[1:14:01] moses remember when moses stood there it
[1:14:04] was this was not a show
[1:14:06] he let him know the god of our fathers
[1:14:11] the god of abraham the god of isaac
[1:14:14] the god of jacob he met me
[1:14:18] and he told me to tell you this
[1:14:22] what did he say i am that
[1:14:26] i am i am
[1:14:29] action me
[1:14:34] that was that if it's spiritually
[1:14:36] discerned
[1:14:37] this is not just something that's taking
[1:14:39] place and says oh wow this is another
[1:14:41] healing ministry
[1:14:42] oh like so-and-so's healing ministry no
[1:14:44] it's not
[1:14:46] no it's not this is the message
[1:14:50] of the hour the focus is not on divine
[1:14:55] healing
[1:14:55] but divine healing is to get the
[1:14:57] attention
[1:14:58] of the people that there is a living god
[1:15:02] who is present the same god that can
[1:15:04] heal the
[1:15:05] heal the sick raise the dead is the same
[1:15:08] god
[1:15:08] who comes on the sea to give life to
[1:15:11] those
[1:15:12] who are spiritually dead he comes to
[1:15:15] awaken
[1:15:16] arise and shine
[1:15:22] they failed to discern it
[1:15:30] even standing there in egypt they failed
[1:15:32] to discern it
[1:15:37] they fail to discern god's faithfulness
[1:15:39] because when god
[1:15:41] brings his word
[1:15:44] that word of promise that god gives it's
[1:15:47] a word that comes to call
[1:15:48] us out and take us into
[1:15:52] amen brother drake you know how it is
[1:15:54] you do you're a plumber
[1:15:56] god bless his heart he likes his trait
[1:15:59] god bless his heart
[1:16:01] you know how it is you get into
[1:16:03] something
[1:16:05] you know you know you're like oh man i
[1:16:08] can't finish this
[1:16:09] i gotta finish this job you get halfway
[1:16:12] through it
[1:16:13] and something's still going on it's
[1:16:15] still leaking
[1:16:16] you don't tell the customers i don't you
[1:16:19] know what just put a bucket underneath
[1:16:20] here
[1:16:20] it'd be good sure it'll catch it and you
[1:16:24] got to keep dumping it
[1:16:28] god doesn't do things halfway
[1:16:32] he does a total deliverance
[1:16:36] a total job the same god that has
[1:16:39] brought you
[1:16:40] this far will safely
[1:16:43] take you home
[1:16:49] so he ain't gonna put you know homer
[1:16:51] buckets underneath it we'll catch this
[1:16:52] dripping
[1:16:53] you know we'll throw it out and then you
[1:16:54] know after service make sure you get the
[1:16:56] bucket back and
[1:16:56] and catch the drip no no
[1:17:03] let me get off a plum before i get down
[1:17:07] they failed to discern his provisions
[1:17:10] of grace
[1:17:15] god has sent a prophet
[1:17:19] they were in egypt living beneath
[1:17:22] oppression
[1:17:25] serving another master
[1:17:29] serving another nation this was not the
[1:17:33] character
[1:17:34] that god had called and ordained for
[1:17:36] their life
[1:17:37] god said before i can never that
[1:17:39] character oh preach
[1:17:41] before that character can never be made
[1:17:43] manifest i gotta get you out from under
[1:17:45] the condemnation
[1:17:47] i gotta get you out from underneath the
[1:17:49] oppression of the tax master
[1:17:51] i've got to set you free and bring you
[1:17:54] into the land where your character can
[1:17:57] be
[1:17:58] unfold
[1:18:05] it failed to discern here's a prophet
[1:18:09] god thought that much about me that he
[1:18:11] sent me a prophet
[1:18:16] that's how i feel
[1:18:23] i'm just trying to stay on this one
[1:18:24] focus
[1:18:28] this is the inspiration we live under
[1:18:32] this is the inspiration
[1:18:37] this inspiration of the word that's been
[1:18:39] opened in this hour
[1:18:43] this is how i look at things when i read
[1:18:45] the bible
[1:18:46] i'm not reading it through the eyes of a
[1:18:48] man
[1:18:50] when i'm hearing the message i'm not
[1:18:51] hearing it through the eyes of a man
[1:18:54] i love the statement brother branham
[1:18:55] makes in third exodus he said
[1:18:57] he he said sent the seven angels
[1:19:01] back to us with the inspiration
[1:19:05] of those seven seals we're living in
[1:19:08] that inspiration
[1:19:10] brother william that's what it is
[1:19:11] inspiration has come to you and i
[1:19:14] the letter killer but the spirit giveth
[1:19:17] life
[1:19:18] amen not just old people remember in
[1:19:20] that vision when the seven angels
[1:19:23] as they came and they were there waiting
[1:19:25] on the prophet and when the prophet came
[1:19:27] there
[1:19:28] here came those angels that were waiting
[1:19:31] for him to get there
[1:19:32] and they picked him up in that
[1:19:33] constellation and in the midst
[1:19:36] of the message coming forth god spoke
[1:19:39] concerning the young people
[1:19:43] that right brother brown says i remember
[1:19:45] what he said to me concerning you young
[1:19:48] people
[1:19:51] glory be to god what is it that you
[1:19:53] don't have to wait to a certain age
[1:19:58] much much we could preach on that it's
[1:20:00] that the same life
[1:20:01] the same truth the same word the same
[1:20:04] victory
[1:20:05] the same reality that there's a young
[1:20:07] people that in the face
[1:20:08] of all the evil and debauchery and the
[1:20:11] temptations
[1:20:12] that are upon this generation let me
[1:20:14] just tell you something the devil would
[1:20:15] like to even you know as i heard people
[1:20:17] would think and my dad sometimes would
[1:20:19] say oh he said i hate to think of my
[1:20:21] grandkids
[1:20:22] living in this age but let me tell you
[1:20:23] something if the coming of the lord
[1:20:26] carries another hundred years there's
[1:20:28] gonna be parents
[1:20:29] and young people that'll live victorious
[1:20:32] and this message and the glory
[1:20:34] and the joy will become greater and
[1:20:37] greater and later
[1:20:38] and greater because
[1:20:42] it's taking it higher and higher
[1:20:47] it's not man taking it higher it's the
[1:20:49] coming of the lord
[1:20:51] we're getting closer
[1:21:02] it didn't see the pillar of fire they
[1:21:04] didn't discern that
[1:21:06] they didn't discern
[1:21:13] it didn't catch that
[1:21:18] i know maybe not everybody saw that but
[1:21:20] i will tell you this
[1:21:22] the cloud that was by day
[1:21:27] and the pillar fire by night that was
[1:21:30] their present
[1:21:31] yes i mean to think about it you're
[1:21:33] encamped
[1:21:34] and the enemy can't get to you you're
[1:21:37] standing there
[1:21:39] and let me just say maybe like this like
[1:21:41] brother chris you're not the enemy
[1:21:42] forgive me
[1:21:43] let me use it for example it beat us
[1:21:45] like me or brother crass or
[1:21:46] brother richard and here we are brother
[1:21:49] adam they're all back their
[1:21:50] enemies they're trying trying to get at
[1:21:53] me
[1:21:54] but god said i'll be the go-between
[1:21:59] i'll be the one who fills the gap
[1:22:02] i'll be the one who stands in the breach
[1:22:06] hallelujah hey man i'll be the one
[1:22:09] that stands there as an abstract that
[1:22:11] stands between you
[1:22:13] and the enemy that's what the real holy
[1:22:16] ghost and the seal of god is
[1:22:18] it's that part of the pillar fire our
[1:22:20] inheritance
[1:22:21] that has come to you and i we are sealed
[1:22:24] until the day
[1:22:25] of our redemption we are under the
[1:22:28] inspiration of the cloud
[1:22:30] the world that has been opened in this
[1:22:32] hour
[1:22:33] and we have received a living experience
[1:22:36] our on the inheritance
[1:22:43] what does it do a spiritual admonishment
[1:22:45] what's it do to make us aware
[1:22:47] make us aware make us aware
[1:22:52] of where we're at what's going on
[1:22:57] this is why the scripture said they in
[1:23:00] psalms 106 7
[1:23:02] when god said through david our fathers
[1:23:05] understood
[1:23:06] not the miracles they didn't understand
[1:23:10] they didn't understand what was going on
[1:23:12] they were just eating
[1:23:14] oh man man this is good wow whoo thank
[1:23:17] goodness man i'm glad we got water today
[1:23:19] man i'm glad we got manner today
[1:23:23] translate that to what paul was speaking
[1:23:26] is that people
[1:23:27] were partaking but they never were being
[1:23:32] changed the word that you and i
[1:23:36] are called to feed upon there's a lot of
[1:23:39] difference between just hearing and
[1:23:40] feeding
[1:23:42] you can listen and not be a feeder
[1:23:46] when you feed it translates into your
[1:23:49] life
[1:23:54] you can tell by looking at some of us we
[1:23:56] just don't taste
[1:24:00] food
[1:24:11] oh i just eat a little bit yeah right
[1:24:14] a little bit too much
[1:24:19] i just eat a little bit you know i just
[1:24:20] need a little problem is you're not
[1:24:22] feeding
[1:24:23] right right
[1:24:28] you like hors d'oeuvres yes and no
[1:24:31] depends on how big of a plate you give
[1:24:32] me to get them all durbs with
[1:24:34] i don't like them little things look
[1:24:35] like golf tees
[1:24:38] let's eat our croissant and let's
[1:24:41] imagine we're getting food
[1:24:45] can i have a spot of tea
[1:24:49] give me a plate sister anna
[1:24:53] like brother louie when he came to the
[1:24:55] fellowship dinners
[1:24:57] that brother brought his own plate
[1:25:01] brother william you would have really
[1:25:03] liked brother louie he was a man's man
[1:25:06] when he came to the fellowship he
[1:25:08] brought a platter
[1:25:10] not a plate a platter
[1:25:15] he did we're talking about being a
[1:25:19] feeder when we were looking at things
[1:25:21] like even as we were
[1:25:22] going into this on thursday night is to
[1:25:24] recognize feed on that word
[1:25:27] feed on it take the word into your life
[1:25:29] feed on that word
[1:25:30] there's not just listening i'm not
[1:25:32] talking about where here you are
[1:25:33] you know you're here in the service and
[1:25:35] my i've got to remember every word
[1:25:37] that's that's still listening if say god
[1:25:39] you speak to me
[1:25:41] it's when you leave out of here say god
[1:25:43] lord let that word
[1:25:45] become flesh in me where you give
[1:25:47] yourself to it where you meditate in it
[1:25:49] day and night your life is
[1:25:53] challenged you don't walk away from here
[1:25:55] and forget what kind of a person you saw
[1:25:59] but with the challenge with the
[1:26:01] challenge comes encouragement
[1:26:08] they failed
[1:26:13] they failed to understand the miracles
[1:26:19] they were overthrown
[1:26:23] they came to the very purpose
[1:26:26] that the message was given for
[1:26:32] to be united with christ
[1:26:36] he brings us into the body the finishing
[1:26:40] the setting for the rapture
[1:26:46] the whole message is capped off in the
[1:26:48] token
[1:26:50] because in him in christ under the blood
[1:26:54] full of the holy ghost in him
[1:26:58] every promise is ye and amen
[1:27:04] the grounds that belong to us as
[1:27:05] believers
[1:27:07] are not just ministered to us
[1:27:11] they are quickened to us
[1:27:18] why the purpose even
[1:27:22] when you prepare to baptize somebody
[1:27:25] sometimes i've been known in the past
[1:27:28] i've had people that come and say i want
[1:27:30] to be a baptized
[1:27:32] why why
[1:27:37] he said why would you say that because i
[1:27:39] want you to understand
[1:27:40] this is not a catholic tradition
[1:27:43] i want you to understand that this water
[1:27:45] does not change you
[1:27:47] i want you to understand that this isn't
[1:27:48] just i did something bad and i want to
[1:27:50] feel better no
[1:27:51] no no no we're not playing games why do
[1:27:54] you want to be baptized
[1:27:57] it's different many times sometimes i
[1:27:59] didn't have to ask that question
[1:28:00] it begins to come right out of the heart
[1:28:04] god's been dealing with my heart god's
[1:28:06] been dealing with my life
[1:28:07] i want to serve god i want to be united
[1:28:09] with god i don't want to just come to
[1:28:11] church
[1:28:11] i don't want to just be a part of a
[1:28:13] church i want to be united with jesus
[1:28:15] christ
[1:28:18] because remember they were all baptized
[1:28:21] brother braham said god permitted them
[1:28:23] to be baptized come through the
[1:28:24] principles of christ
[1:28:26] experience healing experience all that
[1:28:29] and yet they were overthrown
[1:28:31] why they never went all the way right
[1:28:34] right there was no discernment
[1:28:39] but think of caleb
[1:28:44] caleb was standing there and here they
[1:28:46] go across
[1:28:49] to look in the land
[1:28:53] they were but they were in the minority
[1:28:55] 2
[1:28:56] against 10.
[1:29:02] caleb and them came across and what they
[1:29:05] saw
[1:29:06] they said dear lord these guys are too
[1:29:09] big
[1:29:10] to miss
[1:29:13] how can that be because the word is an
[1:29:15] exposure
[1:29:17] it exposed them
[1:29:21] what did it expose it exposed this
[1:29:24] just like israel was looking at goliath
[1:29:26] oh look at this guy
[1:29:28] he's got a big old armor he's got a big
[1:29:30] old you know spear
[1:29:31] he's got a big old this and he's got a
[1:29:33] big old that
[1:29:35] david said he's a philistine all right
[1:29:38] all right yeah
[1:29:39] man he's a big guy man you ever check
[1:29:41] his website out that guy you see all the
[1:29:43] statistics he's got you ought to see all
[1:29:45] the stuff he's got his blog
[1:29:48] david said he's uncircumcised
[1:29:54] david said you can take all of his
[1:29:56] websites all of his stuff
[1:29:58] it comes down to one thing he's
[1:30:01] uncircumcised
[1:30:03] you know what that means he's
[1:30:05] uncircumcision is where he's vulnerable
[1:30:12] he's under a curse oh my mama you see
[1:30:15] he was different david was looking was
[1:30:18] spiritual
[1:30:19] discernment that took him beyond just
[1:30:21] what was in the natural
[1:30:25] this man is a philistine he's
[1:30:26] uncircumcised we
[1:30:28] are the children of god amen
[1:30:32] they weren't feeling like the children
[1:30:33] of god they weren't acting like the
[1:30:35] children of god but god had to have one
[1:30:36] man
[1:30:37] come on the scene and let them know who
[1:30:39] they are one man glory be to god
[1:30:41] that god could get in his hand and
[1:30:44] demonstrate the power of god
[1:30:45] that belonged to them as covenant born
[1:30:49] sons of god
[1:30:55] caleb standing there
[1:31:00] hallelujah as he was standing the word
[1:31:03] had given caleb vision
[1:31:08] caleb made the declaration if the lord
[1:31:11] delighting us
[1:31:11] that word if it ain't used
[1:31:16] like in a manner like i don't know maybe
[1:31:19] you know if it weren't used in that way
[1:31:23] that word is used to try to help them
[1:31:27] get out of the blindness therein
[1:31:30] they were seen perfectly here but their
[1:31:33] blindness was here
[1:31:36] they were blind to who was in their
[1:31:38] midst they were blind
[1:31:40] to his grace they were blind that was a
[1:31:42] spirit of grace they were
[1:31:44] blind to his faithfulness to his promise
[1:31:46] they were blind
[1:31:48] oh what was this when you walk out and
[1:31:50] you you
[1:31:51] god provides manna what is this where
[1:31:53] the complaining and the murmur
[1:31:54] god provides quail what is this where
[1:31:57] the water comes what is that
[1:31:58] that is god's expression of love that
[1:32:01] just as i
[1:32:02] have provided a fountain in a desert i
[1:32:05] prefer
[1:32:06] i have prepared a table in the
[1:32:08] wilderness and the same god
[1:32:11] that will take you over
[1:32:15] but they understood not what was it
[1:32:19] they failed to accumulate in their heart
[1:32:24] all the signs all the wonders what was
[1:32:26] all the spiritual food
[1:32:28] they failed to accumulate in their heart
[1:32:37] brother branham makes that statement i
[1:32:39] read from that on thursday night
[1:32:42] the very next paragraph he says we're on
[1:32:45] the
[1:32:46] sea troublesome times
[1:32:49] are ahead hey listen friends in this
[1:32:52] hour
[1:32:53] it requires faith to be made manifest
[1:32:58] it's not faith that's out there saying i
[1:32:59] got this and i got that and i got this
[1:33:01] and i got
[1:33:04] his faith to recognize he said
[1:33:08] don't you fear to go anywhere
[1:33:11] for the never failing presence of god
[1:33:14] is with you whether so ever thou cost
[1:33:21] i could say something here but you would
[1:33:22] probably think i'm political but god
[1:33:23] didn't call us to a spiritual bunker
[1:33:25] house
[1:33:27] to go hide in a spiritual basement
[1:33:30] are you with me brother brown said a man
[1:33:32] that runs in the basement something's
[1:33:34] wrong
[1:33:35] when there's light shining are you with
[1:33:38] me
[1:33:39] it's light to come out this walk in the
[1:33:41] light
[1:33:47] faith to walk and to live in this hour
[1:33:51] is to come back to where you're standing
[1:33:53] examine where you're standing
[1:33:55] examine the love of god in your life and
[1:33:57] then let the perfect love cast out all
[1:33:58] fear
[1:33:59] amen god never intended for us to be
[1:34:02] subservient to fear
[1:34:06] he wants us to walk in his love amen
[1:34:11] if there's one if there's one bunker
[1:34:14] that god wanted us to fall into
[1:34:15] brother brown says it over and over he
[1:34:17] said it's not a fallout shelter
[1:34:19] it's a falling jesus
[1:34:23] it's a falling jesus amen oh my
[1:34:26] we're protected in him amen
[1:34:29] you see what caleb had let me just bring
[1:34:31] this down here
[1:34:33] but when i say bring it down don't don't
[1:34:35] go ahead and go to the bathroom in your
[1:34:36] mind
[1:34:37] don't go ahead and leave and go and
[1:34:38] check out and go to your favorite steak
[1:34:39] steakhouse
[1:34:41] spiritual admonition
[1:34:47] they all had the word preached to him
[1:34:53] but caleb and joshua well joy they had
[1:34:55] been accumulating all along
[1:34:58] the things that god had done for them
[1:35:02] right you know how personal they took it
[1:35:04] caleb said if i had been the only one
[1:35:08] oh now i feel like preaching now if i
[1:35:11] had been the only one
[1:35:12] god would have still sent this message
[1:35:15] how can you say that caleb
[1:35:18] your great-grandfather is a duke of edom
[1:35:23] you're of the lineage of esau
[1:35:28] hello somebody a kenyan site
[1:35:31] you see his first birth was against him
[1:35:35] but it was spiritual down there beneath
[1:35:37] that first prayer
[1:35:38] he was not going to be controlled by his
[1:35:41] first purse
[1:35:42] there was something greater even when
[1:35:44] brother's saying he felt like giving up
[1:35:46] when it looked like there's no hope but
[1:35:48] something on the inside what was that
[1:35:51] supernaturally
[1:35:52] god was sounding and he was calling out
[1:35:56] to caleb
[1:36:07] the rest of him cut her looks and said
[1:36:11] what promise have you got
[1:36:16] caleb even took it personal god
[1:36:20] told my prophet my messenger
[1:36:24] to select me to represent judah
[1:36:31] he was he was he did not have a gene of
[1:36:34] judah in him
[1:36:37] are you with me but god chose him
[1:36:44] god chose you and i you would look at
[1:36:46] him and say well what about the jews
[1:36:48] because the jews would reject him when
[1:36:51] he came but this gospel
[1:36:53] would return to the jews he would come
[1:36:56] to the gentiles
[1:36:57] and then come back to the jews
[1:37:03] who is it the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:37:07] his life inside of you and i the
[1:37:10] preserving brother brian
[1:37:11] of his word of his truth is
[1:37:13] spirit-filled people
[1:37:16] the words out here people can hack and
[1:37:18] cut that oh we're going to change the
[1:37:19] version of the bible
[1:37:21] you can't change this version
[1:37:25] this is an authorized version it was a
[1:37:28] personal book signing
[1:37:30] by the author himself
[1:37:34] man hallelujah it's been a personal book
[1:37:37] signing
[1:37:38] it's the authorized version it ain't
[1:37:40] king james it's king jesus
[1:37:42] amen it's an authorized version of the
[1:37:45] word
[1:37:47] that which was written is now made fresh
[1:37:53] [Applause]
[1:37:55] we could take our bibles take the tapes
[1:37:58] take the books
[1:37:59] take all those things maybe someday they
[1:38:01] will but there's one thing about it
[1:38:02] you cannot take the word from out of our
[1:38:05] hearts
[1:38:06] that word was there inside of that seed
[1:38:09] the message only come to declare it and
[1:38:12] say
[1:38:13] lazarus come forth
[1:38:16] this message called our nay come forth
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:26] this message is the chapter 11 of john
[1:38:30] standing between 10 and 10 stands in the
[1:38:33] midst
[1:38:34] and says come forth
[1:38:43] i believe i feel like preaching
[1:38:49] hallelujah amen
[1:39:01] lebron said with caleb and joshua
[1:39:06] he said what was it they were
[1:39:08] positionally born in christ
[1:39:11] they had a knowledge of the word and the
[1:39:14] word became manifested
[1:39:19] remember every one of those israelites
[1:39:22] had the word of god preached to them
[1:39:24] but it only taken effect
[1:39:27] upon caleb and joshua to realize
[1:39:31] what it was all about
[1:39:36] everybody else getting this wonderful
[1:39:40] my what a move of god man wasn't that
[1:39:42] good
[1:39:43] man wasn't this they were enjoying
[1:39:46] all the same all the same spiritual
[1:39:49] blessings
[1:39:51] but for caleb and joshua you see
[1:39:54] the inspiration as it was poured out
[1:39:57] it was anointing them with faith
[1:40:02] faith to believe in the impossible
[1:40:06] faith that would carry them and give
[1:40:09] them strength
[1:40:10] to cast down imagination
[1:40:15] you see satan his job
[1:40:19] is to try to talk you out of the
[1:40:21] promises his job
[1:40:24] is to try to hide from you who you
[1:40:27] really are
[1:40:35] but god comes to disclose
[1:40:39] who you really are
[1:40:43] to discern who is in our midst
[1:40:46] who it is that's speaking to our hearts
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:51] as a person that the purpose
[1:40:54] god deals with their life here they
[1:40:55] repent baptized in the name of jesus
[1:40:57] christ
[1:40:58] that they might come into that place to
[1:41:01] receive
[1:41:02] the gift of the holy ghost
[1:41:06] and to receive the gift of the holy
[1:41:09] ghost
[1:41:10] i'm stopping we'll pick this up
[1:41:16] it doesn't mean your battles are done
[1:41:21] brother brian it'd be kind of hard to
[1:41:22] fight a battle if you don't know
[1:41:23] somebody's there
[1:41:24] it's got strength
[1:41:30] be hard brother carlos if you think man
[1:41:32] how am i going to
[1:41:35] see brother aaron this is the ground we
[1:41:37] got to stand on
[1:41:39] the thoughts our ground that we have to
[1:41:42] stand on is
[1:41:44] is i know in whom i have believed amen
[1:41:47] and i am persuaded how can you be so
[1:41:50] perseverant because i heard his voice
[1:41:57] he's spoken here he spoke in here
[1:42:02] he laid claim on my life how do you know
[1:42:04] he laid claim on your life
[1:42:06] how do you know did you feel it

[1:42:33] and i know what i am now i know the
[1:42:36] things that i used to love
[1:42:38] i don't love no more and i have believed
[1:42:42] every word of god

[1:43:31] the overcomers
[1:43:34] this is the land where overcomers
[1:43:38] make manifest the overcomer
[1:43:41] that has already overcome and prevailed

[1:44:33] this is the land where sons and
[1:44:35] daughters
[1:44:36] exercise their authority by the
[1:44:39] quickening power
[1:44:41] you don't know how you know how thick
[1:44:43] these walls are that we built
[1:44:47] god didn't take battering rams to get
[1:44:48] him down you know what god said to do
[1:44:51] brother you know what he said do he said
[1:44:53] march around him

[1:45:14] marching around walls
[1:45:17] going to take down stones i mean really
[1:45:19] have you considered the mortar
[1:45:21] have you considered what had to lift
[1:45:23] these uh
[1:45:24] rocks up there and then if you had a
[1:45:26] brother like brother mark beside you
[1:45:27] brother mark would have the calculations
[1:45:29] they had to use this particular thing to
[1:45:30] get it up there and to put it down
[1:45:35] but that wasn't necessary god said i
[1:45:37] give you the land
[1:45:40] as i was with moses so i be with you

[1:46:18] because her house was not resting
[1:46:21] on the foundation of jericho her house
[1:46:25] was resting
[1:46:26] on the foundation of god's revealed word
[1:46:30] under the token
[1:46:34] though everything was shaking all around
[1:46:37] but in the midst of it it said oh my
[1:46:39] this shaking's going on but in that
[1:46:41] house the glory of the lord
[1:46:43] the shekinah glory was there they said
[1:46:45] praise god
[1:46:46] this shaking's going on it's time for
[1:46:48] deliverance
[1:46:51] what was it spiritual minded
[1:46:56] they caught what was all about
[1:47:02] it had an effect upon him
[1:47:08] and they had to eat that meat of the
[1:47:11] word
[1:47:17] what did god tell them in joshua 1.

[1:49:51] forget it
[1:49:55] i know that might be touchy with some
[1:49:56] people
[1:49:58] but the reality of that's not why we're
[1:50:00] standing
[1:50:02] they're as confused as everybody else is

[1:50:06] way this way this way they're not saying
[1:50:07] we want we don't walk around
[1:50:08] arrogant you understand but we also are
[1:50:11] not ignorant to what's going on
[1:50:16] we're not ignorant to that
[1:50:21] but we look at these things that we're
[1:50:23] facing how
[1:50:24] not i'm not talking about the virus this
[1:50:26] is that's a small thing compared to the
[1:50:28] spiritual things that's going on

[1:50:38] with just let me just i'll just stop

[1:54:03] i know i'm not the only one
[1:54:09] listening to messages over and over
[1:54:11] sometimes
[1:54:12] they get into a series of things and
[1:54:14] there might be messages god will bring
[1:54:16] me right back into

[1:54:48] doing something real spiritual you know
[1:54:50] what it's doing

[1:55:08] and i heard read abraham say so anthony
[1:55:12] how many times i listen this message now

[1:55:15] time
[1:55:15] how many times whoa
[1:55:22] and it's like i never heard that but
[1:55:24] when you hear that part what is it
[1:55:25] it's another key it opens the picture a
[1:55:28] little bit more
[1:55:35] you see it's not me prying i want i'm
[1:55:37] not prying
[1:55:38] i'm just listening i'm feeding
[1:55:42] and then all of a sudden really brian
[1:55:44] here comes one of those raven i don't
[1:55:45] want to call an angel or raven but
[1:55:46] brother branham used that example with
[1:55:48] elijah
[1:55:48] here he comes by
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:54] so whatever your favorite one is baloney

[1:56:09] nourishment has hit brother aaron and
[1:56:14] you say lord
[1:56:16] it's so precious that's what i want in
[1:56:18] my life
[1:56:21] that's what i want you hear the word the
[1:56:23] words calling you what's it called
[1:56:24] what's the word doing
[1:56:26] the words calling to the character on
[1:56:28] the inside
[1:56:31] is feasting on that word as a molding
[1:56:33] and a shaping that's going on
[1:56:36] i hope you don't miss the example that i
[1:56:38] felt impressed to give
[1:56:40] what i'm trying to tell you is don't
[1:56:42] miss your opportunities
[1:56:43] to feed on the word what should i do
[1:56:47] you put on a message you go in devotion
[1:56:50] if you're in devotion in the morning you
[1:56:51] put on a message
[1:56:52] say lord give me my daily bread this day
[1:56:55] lord
[1:56:58] help me to glean what i need to
[1:57:04] but samuel sometimes i i'm work put it
[1:57:06] on while you're working
[1:57:08] put it on while you're ironing it put it
[1:57:11] on while you're doing the dishes
[1:57:12] put it on
[1:57:19] i don't care if people call me cardinal
[1:57:20] or what some of the greatest times i
[1:57:21] have
[1:57:22] because i'm out in the dirt around the
[1:57:24] landscaping but i'm listening
[1:57:27] i might be walking walking on the path
[1:57:29] but i'm listening
[1:57:34] sometimes what it is to me i'm so open
[1:57:36] in that moment
[1:57:37] i know i probably scared away a lot more
[1:57:39] deer than i probably could have shot
[1:57:40] if i'm a good shot that is but my point
[1:57:43] is is that
[1:57:44] it's making yourself available
[1:57:47] if you never go to eat
[1:57:52] if you never go to eat
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:56] how are you going to get nutrients
[1:58:00] [Music]
[1:58:02] i know sometimes it seems like in this
[1:58:03] dna or intermittent fasting you don't
[1:58:05] want to be intermittent spiritually
[1:58:10] why starve yourself for god from god
[1:58:13] give him everything give him everything
[1:58:17] the bible said we're to be fat i like
[1:58:19] that this part in the scripture would be
[1:58:20] as fat as calves in the star
[1:58:24] the word fattens us up but it don't make
[1:58:27] us lazy
[1:58:28] when we really receive it you know what
[1:58:29] that fat does what does the fat do
[1:58:32] for the animals that's going into the
[1:58:33] wintertime like you see the deer right
[1:58:35] now they're
[1:58:36] they left the beans they're on the
[1:58:38] acorns now
[1:58:39] white oak and red oak than pin oak those
[1:58:42] acorns are a lot of fat
[1:58:44] is that right the bears them bears
[1:58:47] and bears get a lot of they gain a lot
[1:58:49] of weight
[1:58:51] why they're getting ready to hibernate
[1:58:53] they need fat
[1:58:54] for their body to endure during the time
[1:58:56] of hibernation
[1:58:58] that's what the word when it speaks of
[1:59:00] being fat as calves in a star
[1:59:02] it doesn't mean that we'll wallow around
[1:59:04] and can't hardly get around oh i can't
[1:59:06] do nothing boy
[1:59:07] this word is so good no no no no no it's
[1:59:09] talking about the nutrients
[1:59:11] necessary nutrients and strength in our
[1:59:14] life
[1:59:15] to live even in times
[1:59:19] of winter
[1:59:23] when all the beautiful leaves are gone
[1:59:25] when you can't seem to find a
[1:59:27] where's that flower at i wish the
[1:59:29] flowers were here but it gives you
[1:59:30] something to say
[1:59:33] there'll be another spring
[1:59:38] [Music]
[1:59:41] i've taken it's been some time but i
[1:59:44] trust here this this morning
[1:59:47] that this has really been we've taken
[1:59:49] this spiritual admonition
[1:59:50] because i don't believe i'm looking at
[1:59:52] people this morning
[1:59:55] we're just coming to church to play
[1:59:56] around
[1:59:58] i'm not speaking to people who are just
[2:00:00] coming
[2:00:01] to fulfill a duty i'm speaking to the
[2:00:04] bride of jesus christ
[2:00:07] it says there's one thing that i have
[2:00:08] one goal
[2:00:10] and that's the rapture and i want to
[2:00:13] live every day
[2:00:14] every moment as if it's the next moment
[2:00:17] i want to live pleasing to him
[2:00:20] i believe i'm speaking to people i say i
[2:00:23] see what the spiritual mean
[2:00:24] the spiritual drink i know what he's
[2:00:26] saying to me
[2:00:28] brother drake you leave out of a service
[2:00:30] it's as though you were the only guy
[2:00:32] here and he spoke to you and you said
[2:00:34] this is what was spoke to me someone
[2:00:36] said really man it's tremendous and then
[2:00:38] sister rebecca said to you
[2:00:39] yeah but this is what he said to me did
[2:00:40] you see what it is it's personal
[2:00:44] [Music]
[2:00:46] it's not a church growing us
[2:00:49] [Music]
[2:00:50] it's the life of christ himself
[2:00:54] that's maturing us
[2:00:57] let's pray anyone want to be remembered
[2:00:59] in prayer
[2:01:01] no matter where you might be say god
[2:01:03] remember me lord
[2:01:04] amen heavenly father
[2:01:09] you have swept over our soul
[2:01:12] you have spoke to us lord words
[2:01:16] of life spiritual admonition now father
[2:01:19] according to every desire that's behind
[2:01:22] every hand
[2:01:23] lord will you minister according to
[2:01:26] their request and their need
[2:01:28] their hand went up because lord they
[2:01:32] know it discerned to know that they're
[2:01:36] in your presence
[2:01:37] to know that you're the god of your word
[2:01:40] to know that it is
[2:01:41] your grace and your faithfulness to your
[2:01:43] word to know
[2:01:46] that lord who you are to know who they
[2:01:48] they are
[2:01:50] god it it's that reality
[2:01:54] and so lord as they raised their hand
[2:01:57] that was a defiance of gravity but i
[2:01:59] think lord on the inside
[2:02:01] it was like that where jacob
[2:02:05] defied his natural birth
[2:02:08] and persevered to the birthright
[2:02:12] it's where rahab denied
[2:02:15] the curse that was upon that city and
[2:02:18] the spiritual part on the inside
[2:02:20] persevered for the true token
[2:02:25] its lives and hearts oh god that
[2:02:28] where the spiritual mind on the inside
[2:02:32] perseveres beyond
[2:02:36] lord we know it's overcoming
[2:02:40] strength that you've given to us
[2:02:43] the lord i pray
[2:02:47] may you grant to the desire of every
[2:02:50] heart
[2:02:51] maybe it's healing in their body maybe
[2:02:54] it's for a life this morning that maybe
[2:02:55] while streaming or hear
[2:02:57] and they would just my request to say

[2:03:09] all the way with you grant that lord
[2:03:12] this morning

[2:03:28] lord

[2:03:32] that the burden
[2:03:34] that comes from your heart from the mind
[2:03:36] of god
[2:03:38] it comes lord to our lives and it moves
[2:03:41] within our hearts
[2:03:42] as paul said i would not have you
[2:03:44] ignorant
[2:03:45] lord our desire is to be wise but not
[2:03:48] wise in our own conceit
[2:03:51] but oh god as a wise man can hear
[2:03:54] correction and he's made more wise
[2:03:57] granite lord may our lamps
