[31:43] with a desire to serve the lord and

[31:52] god

[31:54] that life
[31:56] and the one thing that i expressed to
[31:58] him and be it behooves to
[32:00] to every life as uh once you see
[32:03] if a person goes to build a deck or
[32:07] something like that
[32:08] there's some work that starts showing up
[32:10] at first but then there's
[32:12] there's got to be boards that are put up
[32:14] and things are put on the house and
[32:16] people keep walking by oh you've got to
[32:19] my you've got wood laying out and then
[32:22] they start looking for posts
[32:23] oh you've got the post in the ground but
[32:25] you know how it is if somebody keeps
[32:27] walking by
[32:28] week after week and hey you only got
[32:30] post in the ground
[32:32] you got to keep going you got to keep
[32:34] going you got to keep going
[32:36] the objective within everything of when

[32:47] that deals with our life
[32:48] and becomes the very love of our life

[34:17] inner man o god could really lord be
[34:20] able to receive because we know it's the
[34:22] inner man that takes that word lord
[34:25] as the word is coming in the lamb is
[34:27] being delivered it's the fire on the
[34:29] inside that roast that lamb oh god
[34:32] and lord would see to it lord that the
[34:34] word itself
[34:35] lord has just moved forth in our life oh
[34:38] god for
[34:39] it's lord not by bread alone but by
[34:42] every word that
[34:43] lord proceeds out of the mouth of god
[34:45] that we live lord and
[34:47] our life is directed lord in you we pray
[34:51] now lord i ask that you'll just come and
[34:53] take these lips of clay
[34:55] oh god may you guide and direct here
[34:57] tonight lord with your
[34:59] holy spirit lord say what lord you would
[35:01] have
[35:02] to be said oh god and just move in our
[35:05] hearts in a special way may the spirit
[35:07] of god
[35:08] just move to every heart and every life
[35:10] that's gathered here lord tonight
[35:12] we just love you and we thank you now
[35:14] father in jesus precious name
[35:17] amen and amen amen i'm going to go
[35:20] straight to first corinthians 13
[35:22] 4 and then i'm just going to move on
[35:24] from there
[35:27] and where we've what we've been looking
[35:30] at here or at least were
[35:32] have been dealing with we've really been
[35:33] looking at the thought
[35:36] of honor and um honor is respect
[35:40] and that is something that god
[35:44] god values that of honor
[35:47] and of respect and it's things that
[35:51] when we look here in the scripture the
[35:53] honor that is among
[35:55] the children of god is his presence
[35:58] it's not it's not a self-made honor it's
[36:01] not
[36:02] a self-made title that's when remember
[36:04] when the lord jesus came
[36:06] and he was among the pharisees and they
[36:09] were
[36:10] they were seeking honor one of another
[36:12] they wanted certain
[36:13] seats and certain things and they did
[36:16] certain things they
[36:17] acted a certain way to to draw attention
[36:20] to themselves
[36:21] and so it wasn't a real humility it was
[36:23] a real false humility it wasn't a true
[36:26] honor and the lord jesus said it like
[36:28] this and it applies to every aspect
[36:30] in life he says how can you have faith
[36:34] when you seek honor one from another
[36:38] so the honor that that we receive as the
[36:40] children of god
[36:42] is where that it's god's presence
[36:45] that we can see and we can sense and
[36:48] it's honoring
[36:49] his presence uh even when there's things
[36:52] that we don't understand
[36:54] but we honor the presence of almighty
[36:57] god
[36:58] and this is what this that's what even
[37:00] when david was writing that into psalms
[37:02] where we started looking at that in
[37:04] psalms 105 where he led them along and
[37:06] he said
[37:07] touch not mine anointed and do my
[37:09] prophets no harm
[37:10] it's that of god god will always
[37:13] respect that and even as we we've seen
[37:15] it here in the scripture i'm not mean to
[37:17] keep you standing but
[37:18] you can even see how that god would lay
[37:20] in through paul
[37:22] as we were looking at here of even in
[37:25] aspects
[37:25] of life that goes right outside of
[37:29] beyond interactions with brothers and
[37:32] sisters when it gets right out there
[37:33] into
[37:34] the rest of the community and life and
[37:36] everything else and paul
[37:38] would take diligence by the spirit of
[37:40] god
[37:41] to write that to the children of god to
[37:43] see that servants
[37:44] obey your masters and he went through
[37:46] all of those parts of how
[37:48] that our lives should be in humility and
[37:50] giving honor
[37:52] that's respects and it invites the
[37:54] presence of god and paul would say
[37:55] just to remember he says it is unto of
[37:58] the
[37:59] inheritance that we receive from god
[38:02] and so um i want to just read here and
[38:05] then i'm going to let you be seated in
[38:06] first corinthians 13
[38:08] 4 paul writes charity suffereth long
[38:12] and is kind it endeth not
[38:16] and it vaunteth not itself up and is not
[38:19] puffed up it does not behave itself
[38:22] unseemly and that's why i want to draw
[38:24] from that that word we
[38:26] is dealing with rudely or act
[38:28] unbecomingly
[38:30] it charity does not display itself in
[38:32] that way
[38:33] so may god bless his word and bless the
[38:35] reading of the words you're being seated
[38:37] as we're looking at this with honor and
[38:39] i just want to after
[38:41] some time and we started into it last
[38:43] week and honor
[38:44] in the home and just to see how that
[38:48] within all of these parts here that you
[38:51] know as we look at it
[38:53] brother branham would would take the
[38:55] time and i believe it wasn't uh and i'm
[38:57] not going to just give it to where it
[38:58] was brother branham's doing
[39:00] it was a holy spirit just so much to
[39:03] where that
[39:03] even that he would speak and express
[39:06] things because it's tied so perfectly
[39:08] within the scripture
[39:09] and the relationship between husband and
[39:13] wife and that of christ and the church
[39:14] and paul
[39:15] would write of that even in ephesians 5
[39:18] and how brother branham would deal with
[39:20] how that love itself and i read this
[39:22] quote to you last week of how that love
[39:24] itself
[39:25] should be what governs the home and
[39:28] that's what should actually be the
[39:31] the the the banner or the standard over
[39:34] the home
[39:35] is that of of love and so when we look
[39:38] at this here just to move right into
[39:40] this
[39:41] and we know we understand that in
[39:43] everything
[39:44] that where paul is writing this by the
[39:47] spirit of god it does not behave itself
[39:49] unseemly so then
[39:50] the contrast of that is honor and i want
[39:54] to just i want to just begin here in a
[39:56] fee
[39:56] in a hebrews 13 4 and paul writes it in
[40:00] this way
[40:01] marriage is honorable in all
[40:05] and the bed undefiled but whoremongers
[40:08] and adulterers god will judge
[40:12] i want you to think of this this this
[40:14] this is
[40:15] is a very uh powerful statement it was a
[40:18] powerful statement then and it's a
[40:20] powerful statement now
[40:21] marriage is honorable in all and the bed
[40:25] undefiled
[40:26] because when we look at this of of
[40:29] honorable
[40:30] the very word honorable here it means
[40:32] it's precious
[40:33] it's most precious more precious it's
[40:36] dear it's as of a
[40:37] great price it's held in honor it's
[40:40] esteemed
[40:41] and especially dear and brother branham
[40:44] would write it like would say it like
[40:46] this in god's covenant with abraham and
[40:47] he says
[40:48] i do not believe that satan is a creator
[40:50] i believe that satan is a perverter but
[40:52] not a creator because god is the only
[40:55] one who can create
[40:57] and in the beginning when he became
[40:58] co-partnered to god
[41:00] the son of the morning and so forth when
[41:02] he walked up and down a fiery brimstone
[41:04] and so forth
[41:05] that when satan perverted good to evil
[41:08] you know
[41:09] you know pervert is to do is to
[41:12] pervert anything and he said married
[41:15] life is of god
[41:19] married life is of god
[41:22] the bible said that married life is of
[41:25] god
[41:25] the bed is undefiled but prostitution
[41:29] and illegal that's perverted and
[41:31] look at the whole mind of american
[41:32] people and the peoples of the world
[41:34] is gradually becoming so perverted even
[41:37] the radio television it's all one big
[41:39] conglomeration of sin because the hearts
[41:41] of man
[41:42] call for that every intention of man's
[41:45] heart just like it was before
[41:47] the andaluvian destruction every desire
[41:49] of man
[41:50] is becoming continually evil
[41:54] and you know so when we we see this
[41:57] marriage is honor
[41:58] married life is of god it's not
[42:02] it's not that of that of of the enemy
[42:05] but the enemy has
[42:06] perverted it the enemy has taken
[42:09] something that should be held
[42:11] so precious most precious should be of
[42:14] high value and when satan gets a hold of
[42:18] something
[42:19] he takes it down from the value from
[42:22] what it really should be
[42:24] but it's wonderful and it's awesome that
[42:27] god himself
[42:28] it doesn't do away with the reality that
[42:31] marriage is honorable
[42:32] it's the real image of it that with
[42:35] though even the world itself
[42:37] is got away from all of that and then
[42:39] even to where
[42:40] the the state and the condition that it
[42:43] is in this
[42:44] hour yet we know that he would come to
[42:46] this
[42:47] in this hour paul would prophesy this by
[42:50] the spirit of god
[42:51] in the last days of how peerless times
[42:55] would come
[42:56] he would speak how men would be truth
[42:59] breakers
[42:59] nobody's a person of their word anymore
[43:02] they're without natural affection he
[43:05] would write of that even
[43:06] in the book of romans the first chapter
[43:09] in and
[43:09] having things that should be absolutely
[43:12] when he says without natural affection
[43:14] and it's gone without that that that
[43:17] part which should be
[43:19] something that should be so natural that
[43:21] would be
[43:22] that which is learned between how that a
[43:24] husband treats the wife and the wife
[43:26] responds back to the husband
[43:28] because the bible tells us in the book
[43:30] of thessalonians that
[43:32] you don't need any man to teach you of
[43:34] how that you are
[43:35] to love the brethren because he says you
[43:38] are every man
[43:39] taught of god because when you've
[43:42] received that love and that love's been
[43:44] expressed to you
[43:45] and in that right manner then you
[43:47] understand
[43:48] it's not just an understanding but it is
[43:51] now that same love
[43:52] that would operate through you and
[43:54] that's the reality even within
[43:56] a home life of where where it comes down
[43:59] with children and everything else
[44:01] they are taught how to love and how to
[44:03] receive love
[44:04] by that of the order that's expressed
[44:07] between husband
[44:08] and wife and wife back to husband
[44:11] are you with me now i realize let me
[44:13] just throw out this disclaimer
[44:15] i realize i'm not preaching to anybody
[44:17] who's perfect and that includes me
[44:20] are you with me now i realize that
[44:22] there's a lot of things that you can you
[44:24] could look back or
[44:25] a person could say brother samuel this
[44:27] but brother samuel that
[44:28] but this is one thing about it that when
[44:31] god has taken a hold of our life
[44:33] there's not one person that's here
[44:35] tonight that's too
[44:36] big that's too high that can't say
[44:39] god that you would just come down in a
[44:42] special way and just speak to my heart
[44:45] and help me lord help me to live that
[44:47] out because
[44:48] there there's a desire in our heart to
[44:51] have that reflection
[44:52] of christ within our lives so
[44:56] within this we we see that even where
[44:59] things would get to
[45:00] in in this hour where it would speak of
[45:02] how it was
[45:03] in the days of noah even how it was in
[45:05] the days of lot
[45:07] the conditions would be upon the earth
[45:09] again
[45:10] in this hour now brother brown would say
[45:13] it like this in invisible union he said
[45:15] marriage
[45:16] is the oldest institution in the world
[45:20] marriage was performed first and
[45:22] instituted
[45:23] in the garden of eden now brother brown
[45:25] will take this in this way and just to
[45:27] lay this for
[45:28] a foundation of what i'm going into
[45:30] brother braham will take this when he's
[45:31] speaking of
[45:32] of you know even man and woman coming
[45:35] together
[45:36] in that of of a holy matrimony in union
[45:39] and he'll deal with
[45:40] ahab and jezebel and brother brahma will
[45:42] continue to take
[45:43] these examples over and over and he says
[45:46] it like this he says
[45:47] just like today when a christian boy
[45:50] marries a sinner girl
[45:51] or a sinner girl a christian boy that
[45:54] starts something right then
[45:56] don't you get married unless you're
[45:58] equally yoked together with
[46:00] believers to keep trouble down
[46:04] when god made men and women this is what
[46:06] i want you to get when
[46:07] god made men and women in the beginning
[46:09] he made their
[46:10] spirits then there's someone
[46:13] for you i'll tell you i just love this
[46:16] how
[46:17] that god would just speak so personally
[46:20] in the message of the hour
[46:21] and what a comfort it is and not only
[46:23] just the comfort within that
[46:25] because we see the part of what it ties
[46:28] to
[46:29] with that within the spiritual realm
[46:31] that you and i
[46:32] think about in your own life that you
[46:34] and i even as young people
[46:36] and on and on tried to find different
[46:39] things to satisfy
[46:40] a first that was in your life there are
[46:43] things that people could go and look at
[46:45] on the now on the internet they could
[46:47] try to take the bottle
[46:49] they could try to take cigarettes they
[46:51] could run around and everything else
[46:53] trying to satisfy a desire that's on the
[46:56] inside but that desire on the inside
[46:59] was for reality and all every one of
[47:02] those things right there
[47:04] will leave you empty it'll leave lives
[47:06] messed up
[47:07] but there is a longing on the inside for
[47:10] reality
[47:11] and there's only one person that can
[47:13] satisfy
[47:14] that thirst on the inside that will
[47:16] raise a life
[47:18] from a life of sin to a life of
[47:20] righteousness
[47:21] in jesus christ and that is god himself
[47:24] coming on the scene
[47:26] and dealing with that life where you and
[47:28] i could walk for years and think
[47:30] man i don't seem like i can fit in you
[47:32] can try to fit in
[47:33] all you want to with the world but
[47:35] you'll never fit in with the world why
[47:38] there's a part of you that belongs to
[47:41] god
[47:42] that's a part of you that really is god
[47:45] and it's
[47:45] god that pulls upon that part our spirit
[47:48] and our flesh can resist it but there's
[47:51] a part down on the inside
[47:53] just like that i would have a sim card
[47:55] in this phone right here
[47:57] it receives a signal when a signal is
[48:00] sent to my phone
[48:01] if there's no sim card there's no
[48:03] receiving of a signal
[48:05] you could send texts and call and text
[48:08] and call
[48:08] but i'll never get it unless i've got
[48:10] the sim card and the sim guard has to be
[48:13] activated into the network you know what
[48:15] i'm talking about
[48:16] for by one spirit we are baptized into
[48:20] one body then we receive divine
[48:22] communication
[48:24] is that right so there's a part about it
[48:27] that that part
[48:28] that only can be satisfied by almighty
[48:31] god
[48:31] and that is the part that even within
[48:34] the positive that is
[48:35] actually it lays out here in the
[48:37] negative
[48:38] of even in that part of men and women as
[48:41] brother ram said in the beginning
[48:42] he made their spirits then now let's
[48:45] look back at this in genesis 1
[48:47] 26 and god said let us make man in our
[48:50] own image
[48:51] after our own likeness let me move on to
[48:53] verse 27.
[48:55] so god created man in his own image in
[48:58] the image of god
[48:59] created he him male
[49:02] and female created he them
[49:06] and god blessed them and god said unto
[49:08] them be fruitful
[49:10] multiply replenish the earth and subdue
[49:13] it
[49:13] and have dominion over the fish of the
[49:15] sea over the fowl of the air
[49:16] over every living thing that moveth upon
[49:19] the earth now we recognize that then
[49:22] from this
[49:22] in genesis 1 it goes to genesis 2
[49:26] that here we find that god he places
[49:29] that man that he has made in his image
[49:32] and
[49:33] likeness he places it within a flesh
[49:35] body
[49:36] adam names all of creation as we looked
[49:38] at last week
[49:39] he says this is cal and this is horse
[49:42] and he's naming it by the characteristic
[49:44] as it is revealed to him because he's in
[49:47] tune with the mind
[49:48] of christ is that right you see this is
[49:51] where we've been brought
[49:52] back to as a son and daughter of god
[49:54] back to that same
[49:55] dominion that same have the same mind of
[49:58] christ to operate in our life
[50:00] but yet here they are one in spirit here
[50:03] is
[50:03] here is man here is adam and remember
[50:06] the bible says
[50:07] that in the day that god created them he
[50:10] called their name
[50:11] adam they were one when god created that
[50:14] of the original spirit
[50:16] it was male and female it lay right
[50:18] there within adam but then
[50:20] god in order to provide a helpmate
[50:23] for adam notice a helpmate for adam he
[50:26] put
[50:27] adam to sleep and he took a rib and god
[50:30] began to multiply on that rib god did
[50:32] not
[50:32] move down into another and taken more
[50:36] of a creation but god began to multiply
[50:39] on that rib that was there and god then
[50:42] when the body itself was ready then god
[50:45] goes in
[50:46] and he performs as operation where he
[50:49] separates the masculine spirit
[50:52] from the feminine spirit and he puts
[50:54] that feminine spirit
[50:56] right there in in that of the body
[50:59] of the woman you see the spirit was
[51:02] original
[51:03] the body is the byproduct this is why
[51:06] that even though our bodies
[51:07] are byproduct you came from here and i
[51:10] came from here and
[51:11] you know your mom and dad and so forth
[51:13] but when we receive
[51:14] the holy spirit we're not receiving a
[51:17] different spirit
[51:18] we're receiving the same original
[51:22] spirit is that right so then within that
[51:25] part of it
[51:25] here after god has that set forth now
[51:28] here you have
[51:29] adam the man and here you have that of
[51:32] eve even though she did not have that
[51:33] name at that time
[51:34] she was under that of adam's name and
[51:37] here you find the woman
[51:38] and you find that of them of even that
[51:41] of the feminine spirit
[51:42] that is present there so when marriage
[51:44] was instituted and performed
[51:46] by the lord god between his son and his
[51:48] wife god was uniting them together
[51:51] the spirits are you with me that
[51:54] masculine spirit here
[51:56] and that feminine spirit that was here
[51:58] god was uniting
[51:59] that together in a holy matrimony
[52:03] are you with me you see this is what
[52:06] this is what god was doing now
[52:07] watch how brother brown will place this
[52:09] here and identifying it and he goes into
[52:11] this in
[52:12] questions and answers on genesis and he
[52:14] says you know
[52:15] he says when god had said let us make
[52:17] man in our own image and after our own
[52:19] likeness
[52:19] he made him male and female he made the
[52:22] burly spirit
[52:24] for the man he made the tender
[52:27] little delicate feminist spirit for the
[52:30] woman now this is what
[52:32] god made this is original
[52:36] creation all right
[52:39] the man was made to be burly not a
[52:44] the woman the spirit of the woman tender
[52:47] little
[52:47] delicate feminist her spirit was not
[52:50] made to be
[52:51] burly is that right now notice when
[52:54] jesus here
[52:55] would speak in matthew 19 3 when here
[52:57] the pharisees came to him and
[52:59] tempting him and saying is it lawful for
[53:01] a man to put away his wife for every
[53:04] cause and he answered and said unto them
[53:06] have you not read
[53:08] that he which made them at the beginning
[53:10] made them
[53:11] male and female
[53:14] the world could use a little lesson here
[53:16] on that
[53:17] god didn't make an oops oh i should have
[53:20] made you a female
[53:21] you were a male that's that's the world
[53:25] that's satan's kingdom that's perversion
[53:29] are you with me you see the spirit now
[53:31] listen to me now
[53:32] the spirit is complementary of the body
[53:36] the male in body should hold and display
[53:39] a masculine spirit are you with me now
[53:43] while the female in bodies should hold
[53:45] and display that of a
[53:47] feminine spirit what we just read about
[53:50] you see then when we we recognize this
[53:53] because
[53:54] when brother brahmi tells us he says now
[53:56] man and woman
[53:58] was one he's going back to that in
[53:59] genesis 1. and he says
[54:01] now a woman in the beginning he took the
[54:04] woman from adam
[54:05] and man and wife are really one
[54:09] but what was done was so to reproduce
[54:12] themselves
[54:13] to put them in flesh so god had to the
[54:16] whole
[54:17] separation from that of where god
[54:20] divided that
[54:20] of masculine and feminine putting them
[54:23] into separate
[54:24] there into separate bodies was so that
[54:26] they could reproduce themselves again
[54:29] but they would not reproduce a different
[54:32] image
[54:33] because when god made them male and
[54:35] female god never made
[54:36] images he made one image
[54:41] amen that's why that for the bride of
[54:43] jesus christ
[54:44] we do not have any life that's different
[54:47] than his own life
[54:48] that would be reflected in our life if
[54:50] there is something different in a life
[54:52] that says
[54:53] i'm a christian but their life reflects
[54:55] the world
[54:56] it's not reflecting the true image of
[54:59] what a christian is
[55:00] are you with me it shows that they have
[55:02] not truly
[55:04] been born again by the spirit of the
[55:06] living god
[55:07] because the same way that the spirit
[55:09] behave in the body of the lord jesus
[55:11] is the same way that that same holy
[55:13] spirit will behave itself
[55:15] in every son and daughter of god for he
[55:18] said the works that i do
[55:20] shall you do also is that right
[55:24] so here we find that man and wife
[55:27] are really one so god has put it there
[55:30] so that they would reap
[55:31] they could reproduce themselves again
[55:33] brother brown goes on to say it in this
[55:35] way he says
[55:36] when a woman tries to act like a man
[55:38] dress like a man talk like a man
[55:40] she's out of her place a woman is
[55:42] feminish
[55:43] sweet and loving not big and carrying on
[55:46] and acting like a man
[55:48] well she's not supposed to be when she
[55:50] does that her life is perverted
[55:52] she's sweet loving kind where adam is
[55:56] more the burly type for he was the man
[55:59] the masculine type the woman was
[56:02] feminist but it's
[56:03] it's the same spirit for he took her
[56:06] from adam now
[56:06] here is god in the original creation and
[56:09] when we see this
[56:10] how complementary this is god did not
[56:14] make that of a man to be
[56:15] you know where he's a little timid guy
[56:18] and and everything else
[56:19] but he meant him to where that he would
[56:21] be burly now none of these things in
[56:23] here
[56:24] are our directive of of an of a lordship
[56:27] or a dictatorship or
[56:29] or a pushover that's not at all but the
[56:32] two working together
[56:33] are complementary let me just say it to
[56:35] you like this let's bring it down all
[56:36] right
[56:37] there are times in our life that we need
[56:39] the lord jesus
[56:40] to move on the scene in our lives and
[56:42] there's battles to be fought and we
[56:44] don't need him being tender with the
[56:46] enemy
[56:47] we need the enemy's head taken off is
[56:49] that right but then there's times where
[56:51] we need the great tenderness
[56:53] of the holy spirit to move down within
[56:55] our life
[56:56] and begin to deal with our life so that
[56:58] we can receive
[56:59] if it's correction or whatever it is we
[57:02] need him to move on the scene
[57:04] and he is able to do all of those things
[57:07] you see
[57:07] just how he's able to do that he's also
[57:10] with that same spirit and that life
[57:12] pulsating within you and i
[57:14] it brings us to a place of
[57:16] submissiveness of
[57:17] yieldedness to his voice
[57:21] is that right so then what does it do it
[57:24] manifests
[57:25] who you and i are as the bride of jesus
[57:28] christ
[57:29] you're not trying to be that part of the
[57:32] word well i'm going to try to do this
[57:34] i'm it's it's a desire that's within
[57:37] your heart
[57:37] he stirred that desire up and every time
[57:40] he comes by
[57:41] it just stirs that desire up a little
[57:43] bit more
[57:44] aren't you glad we got a husband like
[57:45] that amen i'm so glad about that
[57:49] notice here brother graham goes on to
[57:51] say it again like this he says
[57:53] you know regarding that and i may not
[57:55] have them sister roseanne are you the
[57:57] one running those
[57:58] i may not have some of these quotes okay
[58:00] yeah up up there because i don't know
[58:01] exactly how much i was going to read of
[58:03] them
[58:03] uh so brother braham says it like this
[58:05] he says he says he put that in the woman
[58:08] the love spirit the feminist kind and
[58:11] gentle
[58:14] brothers you know how it is i think i
[58:16] referred to this last week
[58:17] you know my boys and it wasn't because
[58:19] i'm you know some ogre or something like
[58:21] that but you know it's natural when they
[58:23] fell down
[58:23] they ran to mama there's parts about
[58:26] mama
[58:27] how mama's able to nurture them and you
[58:29] know drive put off to
[58:30] you know take off the you know put on
[58:32] whatever needs to be put on the knee if
[58:34] they skin it or whatever more but
[58:35] there's a part that's within that and
[58:37] that mother part
[58:38] never leaves doesn't matter when they're
[58:41] 40 something years old 50 some years old
[58:43] that mother part never leaves
[58:47] same thing with the dad part as well but
[58:49] you know here notice
[58:50] and the bible goes on to say in matthew
[58:52] 19 5 for this cause shall a man
[58:55] leave father and mother and shall
[58:58] cleave to his wife and they twain
[59:01] shall be one flesh now what twain is he
[59:03] talking about that masculine
[59:05] and feminine spirit remember the spirits
[59:08] here when god made
[59:09] in the very beginning you see how
[59:11] brother graham sets us forth
[59:13] god already has the matches already
[59:15] perfectly made is that right
[59:18] now we also realize brother brown would
[59:20] tell us in 1964 question answers he said
[59:22] if you got the wrong one down here he
[59:24] said don't worry he said all wrongs will
[59:26] be made right over there
[59:28] is that right and you know how brother
[59:29] brown laid it out very clearly
[59:31] if you think it's got the wrong one boy
[59:33] i'm going to go find the right one
[59:34] you need to get the right spirit first
[59:37] are you with me you know brother baby
[59:39] see the spirit of god
[59:41] dealt with these things because this
[59:43] message is a parallel
[59:45] and it works exactly with how that paul
[59:48] himself stood
[59:49] in the early church and laid down a real
[59:52] scriptural order or pattern paul dealt
[59:54] with every one of these parts because
[59:56] it applies to the word
[1:00:00] are you with me so here now they twain
[1:00:03] shall be one flesh that's that's a
[1:00:05] mystery here you have here you have two
[1:00:07] individuals
[1:00:08] and here you could look at them and say
[1:00:10] well i see two people
[1:00:11] i see a man i see a woman like you'd see
[1:00:13] my wife and myself
[1:00:14] standing next to one and you say i see
[1:00:16] two people but you see
[1:00:18] when we've really been joined in a real
[1:00:20] matrimony
[1:00:21] that part of they are no longer twain
[1:00:24] that means that part that feminist part
[1:00:26] that spirit that was out there and the
[1:00:28] masculine part to correspond to that
[1:00:31] where we were separated but god has
[1:00:34] brought it together
[1:00:35] to do what to express not a divided
[1:00:38] image but one image hallelujah
[1:00:42] that's why god sets everything in unity
[1:00:44] and harmony this is why the spirit of
[1:00:46] god
[1:00:47] would write in ephesians 4 endeavor to
[1:00:50] keep the unity why it burns within our
[1:00:53] heart because
[1:00:54] we are not different images but it's one
[1:00:57] image that's to be displayed
[1:01:00] is that right so now verse six wherefore
[1:01:03] they are no more twain but one flesh
[1:01:07] what therefore god hath joined together
[1:01:11] let no man put us under oh my
[1:01:14] i love how brother branham takes this
[1:01:15] here he says what god
[1:01:17] had joined together not one man joined
[1:01:20] together
[1:01:22] you know i i realize that even as as i
[1:01:24] speak and
[1:01:25] you know no matter where it's at you
[1:01:27] know even when at times i've been in
[1:01:29] youth retreats and places overseas and
[1:01:32] and i you know they
[1:01:33] they have me and i'm dealing with
[1:01:34] certain things on this and would ask me
[1:01:36] to teach on it and things like that
[1:01:38] i realized that sometimes sitting there
[1:01:40] there might be parents or older ones
[1:01:42] who could look at it and say lord thank
[1:01:45] you for your grace because
[1:01:46] you recognize god's grace that you
[1:01:49] didn't have that pattern to follow
[1:01:51] you didn't have that but god in his
[1:01:53] mercy
[1:01:54] and you i'll tell you what it's such an
[1:01:56] appreciation i i tell you
[1:01:58] i'm appreciative even though that i sat
[1:02:00] within a pew
[1:02:01] and everything else i'm appreciative of
[1:02:03] the divine arrangement of almighty
[1:02:06] god and how that god as brother ram says
[1:02:08] when you've got a direct revelation from
[1:02:11] god
[1:02:11] that's your wife and the same thing
[1:02:13] that's yours
[1:02:15] the rest of your life what is that that
[1:02:18] revelation that this is my wife
[1:02:20] this is my husband that's an absolute
[1:02:23] that when that when trials come when
[1:02:26] disappointments come
[1:02:27] it's an anchor it's an anchor
[1:02:30] though the gates of hell would try to
[1:02:32] prevail against it it's an anchor
[1:02:36] though everything else could be taking
[1:02:38] place within the world
[1:02:39] it's an anchor because it's not what man
[1:02:42] has joined together
[1:02:43] it's not the minister that joins a man
[1:02:46] and a woman together
[1:02:48] it's god that joins them together
[1:02:51] a minister stands here as a as a as a
[1:02:54] vessel as a
[1:02:55] a as a yielded vessel and and you know
[1:02:58] reading off the valves
[1:02:59] and the vowels that are that are being
[1:03:01] rehearsed and these things that are made
[1:03:03] public
[1:03:04] before an assembly but you realize oh my
[1:03:07] how many people can stand and they can
[1:03:09] rehearse vows
[1:03:10] but their hearts are not even one with
[1:03:13] one another
[1:03:14] it's not even one with one they're even
[1:03:16] so undecided
[1:03:17] you know but to thank god that god would
[1:03:20] come down
[1:03:21] and in the midst of a marriage ceremony
[1:03:23] that god himself
[1:03:25] would be put a stamp with his presence
[1:03:27] that this
[1:03:28] is my divine arrangement these are two
[1:03:31] that have stepped out of eternity
[1:03:33] into a space called time
[1:03:36] you believe that oh it's wonderful
[1:03:40] to think of the grace of god and to
[1:03:42] recognize that even
[1:03:44] though in this lifetime here you've
[1:03:46] walked in this lifetime
[1:03:48] perhaps raised children and everything
[1:03:49] else but even there on the other side
[1:03:52] you'll still be identified together
[1:03:56] that you walk together in life a
[1:03:58] fellowship together
[1:03:59] imagine what it would be like imagine if
[1:04:02] your spouse wasn't there with you
[1:04:04] it's something about it that you look at
[1:04:06] it and say this
[1:04:07] is a delight that god has arranged and
[1:04:10] prepared
[1:04:14] listen to this here brother branham he's
[1:04:17] bringing this in statue of a perfect man
[1:04:21] he said you know he said a young man the
[1:04:24] other day
[1:04:24] said you think i could ought to get
[1:04:27] married
[1:04:28] brother branham to such a such a girl as
[1:04:30] to how much you think of her
[1:04:32] oh my i just love her i said well if
[1:04:35] you're not going to live without her
[1:04:38] you better marry her then but if you can
[1:04:40] live without her
[1:04:41] you better not but if it's going to kill
[1:04:44] you
[1:04:45] you better go ahead and get married
[1:04:48] brother bran said
[1:04:50] what i was trying to get to him was that
[1:04:54] was this that if you love her so much it
[1:04:57] says right now before you're married
[1:05:00] everything is just fine and dandy but
[1:05:02] after you get married
[1:05:04] then the toils and trials of life come
[1:05:07] in
[1:05:08] that's when you got to be so in love
[1:05:10] that you understand
[1:05:11] one another when you're disappointed in
[1:05:14] her
[1:05:15] she's disappointed in you you still
[1:05:18] understand one another
[1:05:20] see what brother is laying down honor
[1:05:25] doesn't stop even in
[1:05:29] you don't even when you're disappointed
[1:05:30] in one another
[1:05:32] it's still honor honor is still there
[1:05:36] because what what does honoring do
[1:05:39] when we talk about applying the token to
[1:05:41] our house
[1:05:42] that of honor and keeping it in that
[1:05:44] place it invites the spirit of god
[1:05:47] to move and to direct us
[1:05:50] to help us are you with me now
[1:05:53] you see when the scripture says this i'm
[1:05:55] a little bit off point but
[1:05:57] when the scripture says this when it
[1:05:59] speaks of the word husband
[1:06:01] the very word husband it means
[1:06:04] a house banned that's what the word is
[1:06:09] and that word means it's the same word
[1:06:11] that would be used for when they would
[1:06:13] take a
[1:06:13] sheath and have to wave the sheath
[1:06:15] before the lord to be accepted
[1:06:17] they had to put a band around that sheaf
[1:06:21] so god lays that part down of that of of
[1:06:25] a husband of a life
[1:06:26] that the responsibility to try to bring
[1:06:29] that
[1:06:30] home under the influence and the
[1:06:32] presence of almighty god
[1:06:34] and i know i'm speaking even to veteran
[1:06:36] parents that
[1:06:38] you know your your children are maybe my
[1:06:40] age
[1:06:41] some of them but you recognize this very
[1:06:44] thing right here that the applying of
[1:06:45] that token and of that life
[1:06:47] is the atmosphere that's been created
[1:06:50] the bible says teach a child when it's
[1:06:54] young in the way that it should go
[1:06:56] and when it grows old it will not depart
[1:06:58] from it is that right
[1:07:00] and i think we can agree here tonight
[1:07:03] teaching is more than talking
[1:07:06] teaching is a life on display
[1:07:09] because teaching alone will not say we
[1:07:12] do this and we don't do that and we do
[1:07:13] no no
[1:07:14] brother braham tells us when we display
[1:07:15] the token he said let him see it
[1:07:18] in you it'll have an effect
[1:07:21] you see it's reality within that life
[1:07:24] and how god when we look at that and you
[1:07:26] might think well
[1:07:27] they're here maybe your children are not
[1:07:29] all your children are serving or maybe
[1:07:30] some are and some aren't
[1:07:31] but this but but our confidence is in
[1:07:34] that reality of
[1:07:36] jesus christ because out there there is
[1:07:38] no reality
[1:07:40] there's only one place of reality and
[1:07:42] only one of
[1:07:43] real real true satisfaction
[1:07:46] and that's in the lord jesus christ it's
[1:07:49] that
[1:07:49] part right there that presses upon their
[1:07:52] life that's why when they get in trouble
[1:07:54] they hunt you up it isn't because you
[1:07:56] can quote the scripture real good
[1:07:57] that's not why they call you and ask for
[1:07:59] prayer it's because they've got
[1:08:01] confidence you've got contact with
[1:08:04] god are you with me
[1:08:09] so what a responsibility when we when we
[1:08:11] see this here of
[1:08:12] of that band that comes around it and
[1:08:15] how that there
[1:08:16] i i i i it raises up what a
[1:08:19] responsibility and i know there's more
[1:08:21] to that but
[1:08:22] you see it comes to a place in applying
[1:08:25] that
[1:08:25] brother brahman says when you're
[1:08:26] disappointed in her she's disappointed
[1:08:28] in you
[1:08:29] you still understand one another that's
[1:08:32] the way it is with christ
[1:08:34] we've got to be so in love with him to
[1:08:37] when we ask
[1:08:38] for something and he doesn't give it to
[1:08:40] us
[1:08:41] that doesn't shake us a bit
[1:08:45] the only way you can do that is to
[1:08:46] become partakers of his divine nature
[1:08:49] then you'll understand the reason he
[1:08:51] can't give it to you
[1:08:53] now i think within all this you know i i
[1:08:56] read this you know the other night
[1:08:57] and uh you know when i when right there
[1:09:00] in the home but i want you just to
[1:09:02] think of this here in the midst of all
[1:09:04] that's going on because sometimes
[1:09:06] you hear things you know where we see
[1:09:08] signs we see
[1:09:10] things taking place around us we see
[1:09:12] that that what was predicted we see
[1:09:14] things taking place
[1:09:15] but no man knows the day nor the hour we
[1:09:18] know we're living in the
[1:09:20] time of his coming but even sometimes
[1:09:22] you know that
[1:09:23] maybe where a person or a young person
[1:09:25] could say well should i do this right
[1:09:26] now should i
[1:09:27] should i go ahead and you know make make
[1:09:29] plans you know for
[1:09:31] a career and what's coming on down the
[1:09:33] road absolutely
[1:09:34] samuel what if the rapture was going to
[1:09:36] take place the very day that i started
[1:09:39] fall semester
[1:09:40] be in class on the fall semester and let
[1:09:43] him rapture you
[1:09:45] brother said if i knew that the rapture
[1:09:47] was coming in the morning
[1:09:48] i would study to preach this message
[1:09:52] see it's not us just waiting around with
[1:09:54] our hands crossed and our feet laid back
[1:09:56] and
[1:09:56] we're living in that time we're not
[1:09:58] built to be that way
[1:09:59] we're built as paul would write in first
[1:10:01] corinthians 15
[1:10:02] to be abounding in the work of the lord
[1:10:06] is that right so even you know when
[1:10:08] brother brown was asked questions i
[1:10:09] think questions answers on the seals
[1:10:11] in other places now notice here he's
[1:10:13] asked this question
[1:10:14] brother branham knowing that time is
[1:10:16] ending and
[1:10:17] eternity's setting in what would be your
[1:10:20] advice for a couple
[1:10:21] planning marriage now he's got every
[1:10:24] opportunity to say you know what
[1:10:26] just forget about it don't even think
[1:10:29] about marriage
[1:10:30] i mean the time so late
[1:10:33] but that wouldn't be right
[1:10:36] that wouldn't be right the bible said
[1:10:38] enoch walked
[1:10:40] with god are you with me when god came
[1:10:43] to mary
[1:10:44] she was making her normal trip to the
[1:10:47] well
[1:10:48] are you with me that's the same way the
[1:10:49] rapture the rapture is going to be
[1:10:51] is going about the normal daily
[1:10:54] activities
[1:10:56] are you with me glory be to god so now
[1:11:00] go right ahead and get married go right
[1:11:03] on just like
[1:11:04] if you was going to live for another
[1:11:06] hundred years here on earth
[1:11:08] just go right on keep your heart set on
[1:11:10] christ
[1:11:11] not your hearts on these things of the
[1:11:13] world but on
[1:11:14] christ go right on get married children
[1:11:18] god bless you in your wedding this is
[1:11:21] advice
[1:11:22] and counsel that is given to that of
[1:11:26] even those that would be coming into
[1:11:28] that place
[1:11:29] to say you make preparations as though
[1:11:32] you're going to be here a hundred years
[1:11:33] but you live as if he could come the
[1:11:36] next
[1:11:37] moment you have to make plans for things
[1:11:40] right
[1:11:41] right don't worry there'll come a last
[1:11:44] day that
[1:11:45] dinner has to be made last day that the
[1:11:47] towel's got to be washed and
[1:11:49] last day that you know that the shirts
[1:11:52] have to be ironed and
[1:11:53] they'll be one of those last days last
[1:11:55] days you gotta you know
[1:11:57] change the the tire on the car there'll
[1:11:58] be one of those last days
[1:12:00] is that right but until that time we
[1:12:03] carry on
[1:12:05] is that right so marriage is honorable
[1:12:07] let's look at these things just for a
[1:12:08] few moments here
[1:12:09] and i'm going to wrap up marriage is
[1:12:11] honorable so then every aspect of
[1:12:13] marriage
[1:12:14] is to be honorable to be held in honor
[1:12:17] and that would be honored displayed
[1:12:18] notice the scripture would write this
[1:12:20] here
[1:12:21] in ephesians 5 and paul from here is
[1:12:24] referring back to places that we've been
[1:12:25] in genesis 1.
[1:12:27] and he would write submitting yourselves
[1:12:29] one to another
[1:12:30] in the fear of god how many times that
[1:12:32] paul would write of this
[1:12:34] and he deals with the marriage
[1:12:35] relationship the same way
[1:12:37] as peter would deal with it and you'll
[1:12:39] find over and over
[1:12:40] the word fear fear does not mean
[1:12:42] slavishes where you're ducking around
[1:12:45] fear means reverence to hold in honor
[1:12:48] submitting yourselves unto one another
[1:12:51] in the fear
[1:12:52] of god and you find that here
[1:12:55] within that that all of this submission
[1:12:57] is dealing with
[1:12:58] in reverence of god in verse 22
[1:13:02] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[1:13:05] husbands as unto the lord
[1:13:09] notice as unto the lord so this word
[1:13:13] submission it deals with
[1:13:15] one that would submit or to yield to
[1:13:19] uh one's admonition or advice uh
[1:13:22] and here's a very important part it is a
[1:13:25] voluntary
[1:13:26] attitude of giving in cooperating
[1:13:29] assuming ability
[1:13:30] and carrying a burden notice it's god's
[1:13:32] instruction is
[1:13:33] that wives would submit themselves that
[1:13:36] is not it
[1:13:37] is not something that's just that if i
[1:13:39] can say it in this way
[1:13:40] that is just demanded but god's desire
[1:13:44] is that it would be something that for
[1:13:46] that of the wife
[1:13:47] it would be a willingness it would not
[1:13:50] be a
[1:13:50] wrestling it would not be a fighting it
[1:13:52] would not be a
[1:13:53] struggling but it would be something
[1:13:56] that would just
[1:13:57] be that of willingness to really
[1:14:00] release that part that is right there
[1:14:04] amen now notice this
[1:14:09] i've said it like this before i read
[1:14:10] this this quote i've said this like this
[1:14:12] here over the years as well too
[1:14:16] god desires
[1:14:19] this order as we read even in the
[1:14:22] scriptures of where that
[1:14:24] the man is the head of the woman and
[1:14:26] christ the head of the man and god
[1:14:27] of christ and we recognize that that
[1:14:30] order of how that that's to flow
[1:14:32] and even though the man is to be the
[1:14:33] head but it's not something that is just
[1:14:36] when
[1:14:36] god would express that it's that it's
[1:14:38] just well this is just to be
[1:14:40] uh you know it's just well this is who i
[1:14:42] am i'm the head of the house
[1:14:43] but it's to be something that should be
[1:14:46] residing
[1:14:46] within the heart of that wife
[1:14:50] it should be a place that is given like
[1:14:52] peter could write
[1:14:53] the hidden man of the heart is that
[1:14:56] right
[1:14:58] now notice brother braham will write it
[1:14:59] like this and he'll say
[1:15:01] out of the thytarian age you'll say now
[1:15:03] a woman is not meant to have
[1:15:04] an iron disposition not according to the
[1:15:07] holy scripture
[1:15:09] as she is according to the holy
[1:15:10] scripture to be submissive to the male
[1:15:13] that's commanded of her woman who is
[1:15:15] truly female
[1:15:16] all female will be of that disposition
[1:15:19] well then what is it if it's not of that
[1:15:21] disposition
[1:15:23] then it's just like when you have a
[1:15:25] bruised cell
[1:15:27] cancer can come in is that right
[1:15:30] this is where you find things that
[1:15:32] things can when you look and you can
[1:15:35] i mean it isn't too hard sometimes to
[1:15:37] pick out certain things you know
[1:15:39] when you're walking around and you see
[1:15:41] certain things you know in stores and
[1:15:43] and everywhere else and it's a very sad
[1:15:45] thing i mean when you see
[1:15:46] the situations where there's such a
[1:15:48] demeanor uh
[1:15:50] among that of women and it's a sadness
[1:15:52] that's there because it's a real
[1:15:54] it's a harshness and it's though it's
[1:15:55] that they've got something to prove that
[1:15:58] i can do this just as good as you can
[1:16:00] god never put that position there
[1:16:03] that was never that was never supposed
[1:16:05] to be there
[1:16:06] but you see god gave the woman her
[1:16:08] position and her place and it's a
[1:16:11] glorious place
[1:16:13] are you with me it's a glorious place i
[1:16:15] mean to think of what god himself
[1:16:18] has done what he has done in order to
[1:16:20] bring life to you and i
[1:16:22] as the bride of jesus christ before we
[1:16:25] could ever lay our lives down
[1:16:27] he laid his life down he laid his life
[1:16:31] down so that you and i
[1:16:32] might be able to lay our lives down what
[1:16:34] is that submitting yourselves to one
[1:16:35] another in the fear of god
[1:16:37] he submitted to the word that called for
[1:16:40] a kinsmen
[1:16:41] redeemer and what did that do it had an
[1:16:43] effect to draw upon
[1:16:44] our lives when the spirit of god would
[1:16:46] deal with our life to do what
[1:16:48] submit ourselves yield to his admonition
[1:16:52] i don't think tonight i'm not standing
[1:16:54] here because i have to
[1:16:55] i'm not standing here because well i
[1:16:57] have to preach i'm not standing here
[1:16:59] because
[1:16:59] well i've got to serve god if i don't
[1:17:01] serve god i'm going to go to hell
[1:17:02] if that's how you feel tonight you need
[1:17:04] to meet the lord jesus
[1:17:06] that's a slavish ungodly fear
[1:17:10] that is not the love of god the bible
[1:17:12] tells us that the love of god
[1:17:14] that in that love there is no fear
[1:17:17] there's no torment but it actually gives
[1:17:20] us a confidence
[1:17:21] that right now where we're standing that
[1:17:24] though we're here
[1:17:25] in this life we have already been
[1:17:27] accepted
[1:17:28] in the beloved it's not something i have
[1:17:31] to do
[1:17:32] it's the privilege and the pleasure of
[1:17:34] what can i do for you lord
[1:17:36] what can i do for you tonight lord what
[1:17:39] what would you have me to do you see
[1:17:40] what is that
[1:17:41] that is a submitting with a voluntary
[1:17:45] attitude now let's just be honest our
[1:17:48] first nature
[1:17:49] didn't want nothing to do with it
[1:17:52] our first nature ran from it but you can
[1:17:55] only run so far
[1:17:58] because there was something on the
[1:18:00] inside it was a part of him
[1:18:03] and he would begin to draw that part to
[1:18:06] himself
[1:18:07] it was his love his love being projected
[1:18:10] his love being manifested to you and i
[1:18:13] it was not
[1:18:14] harshness and cruelty it was not god
[1:18:17] coming down with the rod
[1:18:18] and beating you and iron scaring us to
[1:18:21] death that would never produce
[1:18:23] anything but slavish fear but the love
[1:18:25] of god
[1:18:26] sure it can point out in a life that if
[1:18:28] you don't surrender and the direction
[1:18:30] you're going
[1:18:31] this is the way you're headed but the
[1:18:32] love of god will come right back and say
[1:18:35] but i made a way for you you don't have
[1:18:37] to remain in that condition
[1:18:38] you don't have to keep going that way
[1:18:40] there is a way
[1:18:42] and i am the way the truth and the life
[1:18:46] glory be to god he draws us to that
[1:18:49] place
[1:18:51] notice this here woman who is truly
[1:18:54] female
[1:18:54] all female will be of that disposition
[1:18:57] not a doormat
[1:18:59] can you say amen not a doormat
[1:19:04] no real male makes a female a doormat
[1:19:09] what's a doormat wipe their feet on
[1:19:13] that's not what a real man does
[1:19:16] he doesn't make a woman a doormat
[1:19:20] but she look at this but she will want
[1:19:22] to be under authority
[1:19:24] and not rule over the mail for he is the
[1:19:26] head of the house
[1:19:29] let me just say this to you this is a
[1:19:33] part
[1:19:34] that god already put within the female
[1:19:38] it's part that lays there in that
[1:19:40] feminist spirit
[1:19:41] it's not something that she receives
[1:19:43] after she oh
[1:19:45] that she receives uh the holy spirit
[1:19:47] that's already there
[1:19:49] are you with me that attribute is
[1:19:52] already there just like a little girl
[1:19:54] that would go along and she has her
[1:19:55] first baby doll she's caring for that
[1:19:57] baby doll you know she has her kitchen
[1:19:59] set and
[1:19:59] she's serving you you know plastic
[1:20:01] donuts and
[1:20:02] plastic watermelon slices and everything
[1:20:04] else what's she doing she's imitating
[1:20:06] things that she saw
[1:20:08] mama do is that right but what it is is
[1:20:11] there's
[1:20:11] attributes that's already in there you
[1:20:14] give her a little puppy
[1:20:15] she'll she'll mother that little puppy
[1:20:17] along just as a little girl why the
[1:20:19] attributes
[1:20:20] are already in there is that right but
[1:20:23] in the proper season and the proper
[1:20:26] bed of time are you with me now they
[1:20:29] will come
[1:20:29] out and into expression because the
[1:20:32] bible says for
[1:20:33] every purpose there is a season
[1:20:36] is that right so it's a preparation for
[1:20:39] that season
[1:20:40] in order to come forth that's what we
[1:20:41] were looking at last week so then when
[1:20:43] we look at this part of it
[1:20:44] it's a natural part now here's the thing
[1:20:47] that works within this
[1:20:48] it's also satan's desire to work on the
[1:20:51] man
[1:20:52] especially in this hour it's been this
[1:20:54] way for years
[1:20:55] and it works it's that feminist agenda
[1:20:57] that started clear back in the 1800s
[1:21:00] i know you may not know that but i've
[1:21:01] studied this for a few years it started
[1:21:03] clear back
[1:21:04] in the 1800s seeds that were sown even
[1:21:07] when they had that sexual revolution
[1:21:09] in the 1960s that was some of the
[1:21:11] product
[1:21:12] of what was sown in the late 1800s
[1:21:17] it's seeds that have been sown this is
[1:21:19] why even the prophet is telling us
[1:21:21] with certain seeds that were even being
[1:21:23] sown in that hour
[1:21:25] and he would take a a sitcom or a show
[1:21:28] by the name of i love lucy and what
[1:21:30] everybody else would look at and say
[1:21:32] what's harmful about that i mean if you
[1:21:34] you know nowadays no doubt there are no
[1:21:36] doubt things that you could look at and
[1:21:37] say
[1:21:38] there ain't nothing that i love losing
[1:21:39] brother would say susie you know
[1:21:41] there ain't nothing to that but you see
[1:21:43] what it was it was seeds
[1:21:45] that was being sown it was actions it
[1:21:48] wasn't so much
[1:21:49] that you know i think it was lucille
[1:21:50] ball whoever that she was you know
[1:21:52] maybe outrightly calling her husband a
[1:21:55] dummy or anything else like that
[1:21:56] but it was how that she was acting in
[1:21:58] disrespect i'm telling you
[1:22:00] image is more powerful than words
[1:22:04] and that's what the prophet was dealing
[1:22:05] with that's why i said when you let he
[1:22:07] said
[1:22:08] your children watch all of these things
[1:22:09] on the screen and men and women
[1:22:11] swapping over one another he said
[1:22:13] they'll be practicing the same thing
[1:22:15] the next day why it's images that's set
[1:22:18] forth
[1:22:20] but aren't you glad there's been another
[1:22:23] image
[1:22:25] there's been another image brother it
[1:22:27] hadn't come by television
[1:22:29] it's combination of the word in this
[1:22:33] hour
[1:22:33] that is set forth of what a real man and
[1:22:36] woman is
[1:22:37] what a real marriage is it set forth who
[1:22:40] the real bride of jesus christ is
[1:22:42] because it is revealed jesus christ is
[1:22:45] the same yesterday
[1:22:46] today and forever and when he begins to
[1:22:49] reveal himself
[1:22:50] his mate is drawn to him in love
[1:22:53] and brother it's a match literally made
[1:22:56] in heaven
[1:22:58] hallelujah glory be to god in the
[1:23:02] highest
[1:23:03] oh my notice he said if she breaks that
[1:23:06] image
[1:23:07] that god made for she's perverted any
[1:23:09] male
[1:23:10] that lets this is important now any male
[1:23:13] that lets the woman take authority
[1:23:15] has also broken that image and he is
[1:23:16] perverted
[1:23:19] this is why as we were saying natural
[1:23:21] things that are pertaining
[1:23:23] you know a man said well you know i'm
[1:23:25] gonna my wife you know i think she's
[1:23:27] more spiritual
[1:23:29] perversion i said that's perversion
[1:23:33] there's something not right there there
[1:23:36] should be a real confidence
[1:23:38] a man is to have a cut not an arrogance
[1:23:40] are you understanding me
[1:23:41] confidence is not arrogance you do not
[1:23:43] want a man who's wishy-washy
[1:23:45] you don't want a pastor who's well you
[1:23:47] know what i don't know about this i i
[1:23:48] don't know how to believe about this i
[1:23:50] don't know what i think you don't want a
[1:23:51] pastor that way
[1:23:53] are you with me you want a man who'll
[1:23:55] stand on the word and on the convictions
[1:23:57] of what god
[1:23:58] has revealed to him and hold that
[1:24:01] absolute over the congregation that's a
[1:24:05] standard of god's word
[1:24:06] and what is it it's not the man himself
[1:24:09] because that man
[1:24:10] may not have a lick of confidence in
[1:24:12] himself which he shouldn't
[1:24:14] it should be according to the working of
[1:24:16] the holy spirit
[1:24:17] in his life but he's got confidence in
[1:24:19] that word that
[1:24:20] god has revealed that the word will
[1:24:23] perform just exactly
[1:24:25] what it said it will do
[1:24:26] [Applause]
[1:24:28] hallelujah and that's why with a husband
[1:24:32] a husband that's a part that a woman
[1:24:34] craves
[1:24:36] to be led to be directed
[1:24:44] when that doesn't happen this is why you
[1:24:46] find things all out of order
[1:24:48] this is why you find things where you
[1:24:50] know where things where you've got
[1:24:52] women responding in certain ways they
[1:24:53] shouldn't be responding
[1:24:55] they shouldn't they shouldn't be out
[1:24:57] there it shouldn't be in that way
[1:24:58] well i think this and i think this this
[1:25:01] shouldn't be that way the bible says if
[1:25:02] the woman is to learn anything
[1:25:04] let her learn in silence
[1:25:08] are you with me not putting all of her
[1:25:10] things out there
[1:25:11] now they've got all kinds of platforms
[1:25:12] that everything can be put out there
[1:25:14] but you see it's a part that's natural
[1:25:17] it's natural
[1:25:18] and if that part as a husband is not
[1:25:21] fulfilled
[1:25:22] god will hold the husband accountable
[1:25:25] because he's
[1:25:26] not actually serving according to the
[1:25:28] image
[1:25:29] that god created him to be in
[1:25:33] my goodness
[1:25:36] it's a very important the man himself
[1:25:41] should be the head of discipline in the
[1:25:42] house
[1:25:44] should be the one who directs it
[1:25:50] either it's pricking or we're just
[1:25:52] listening
[1:25:55] it should be that direction that's given
[1:25:58] there there should be that direction
[1:26:00] that's
[1:26:00] that's moving on there within that home
[1:26:03] because when it does
[1:26:04] what that actually does it allows then
[1:26:06] that wife
[1:26:07] to flourish in the place that god
[1:26:10] has called her to dwell in
[1:26:14] oh my for the husband
[1:26:19] is the head of the wife even as christ
[1:26:23] is the head of the church and he is the
[1:26:26] savior
[1:26:27] of the body you see this responsibility
[1:26:31] i'm going to pull up here this is a
[1:26:34] responsibility
[1:26:36] that the husband has for the husband is
[1:26:37] head of the wife headship itself
[1:26:41] is an ultimate is a is an awesome
[1:26:44] responsibility when i when i use the
[1:26:45] word awesome here i do not mean
[1:26:47] something lightly like
[1:26:48] hearts it's to be reverenced
[1:26:52] the responsibility that one is coming
[1:26:56] into
[1:26:56] or has because to
[1:27:00] serve in that capacity as head
[1:27:03] is responsible for all provision
[1:27:08] responsible for protection
[1:27:14] history is responsible for the comfort
[1:27:17] of life to provide
[1:27:20] all of those things with what's
[1:27:21] necessary and the comfort of life for
[1:27:24] comforting
[1:27:24] that that's a big responsibility
[1:27:26] headship is not something that's just
[1:27:28] well i'm the head of the home and pardon
[1:27:30] me for saying this
[1:27:32] but how it is nowadays i'm the head of
[1:27:34] the home and where's he at
[1:27:35] in the basement with video games
[1:27:38] preach brother samuel i will he's the
[1:27:41] head of the home
[1:27:43] and she's doing she's running everything
[1:27:46] that's an agenda of seeds that was sown
[1:27:48] back there
[1:27:49] that's coming out now to demasculinize
[1:27:55] a man
[1:27:59] but all of this is being placed within
[1:28:02] those plates you said brother samuel oh
[1:28:03] that that really no it's very necessary
[1:28:05] this is very necessary to be taught if
[1:28:08] paul by the spirit of god would have
[1:28:10] paul to put this in the scripture and
[1:28:11] brother branham would lay on this
[1:28:13] time and time again it's very necessary
[1:28:15] because it goes back and forth with the
[1:28:17] spiritual
[1:28:19] so it's something that's a great
[1:28:21] responsibility for that husband
[1:28:24] great responsibility oh my
[1:28:27] let me just you're probably saying whew
[1:28:31] man
[1:28:32] we're done now we can move on
[1:28:37] can i have just two more minutes
[1:28:40] verse 24 therefore as the church is
[1:28:42] subject unto christ
[1:28:45] so let the wives be to their own
[1:28:46] husbands in everything
[1:28:50] see as the church is subject unto christ
[1:28:52] well how is the church subject
[1:28:54] this word subject is the same word
[1:28:55] submit comes back to
[1:28:57] we're not in bondage we're free
[1:29:00] i'm not doing what i have to do because
[1:29:02] i have to do it
[1:29:04] brother dan daisley told a story i think
[1:29:06] his brother dan yeah brother dan days
[1:29:08] they told a story
[1:29:09] it might have come out of the message
[1:29:10] but i i didn't even plan on this but it
[1:29:12] comes to mind right now
[1:29:14] there was a woman here she was married
[1:29:19] and her husband had all of this list
[1:29:22] of things to do and here she is
[1:29:26] doing this doing that she's doing it all
[1:29:29] she does it all
[1:29:30] everything you know that he's asked
[1:29:34] she comes you know to a place of very
[1:29:36] grieved you know
[1:29:39] but they don't separate or anything like
[1:29:41] that
[1:29:42] finally it comes to a spot that he
[1:29:45] passes away
[1:29:47] he passes away and you know she's
[1:29:51] younger or whatever the age is
[1:29:54] and she gets married again
[1:29:58] once she gets married she's up in the
[1:30:00] attic and she's looking at all those
[1:30:02] boxes and things like that
[1:30:04] and she finds this long list
[1:30:08] and she starts reading it well nobody
[1:30:10] knows what's going on she just starts
[1:30:12] laughing and laughing and laughing and
[1:30:14] laughing
[1:30:15] well what it was she was laughing at the
[1:30:18] list
[1:30:19] because everything that she had to have
[1:30:21] that list for to do this to do that and
[1:30:23] from the first husband she didn't need
[1:30:26] it for the second husband
[1:30:27] she wasn't even thinking of it in that
[1:30:29] way she just
[1:30:30] did it see that's the same way it is
[1:30:34] when god brings about a real
[1:30:36] change in a person's life you can do
[1:30:39] things i have to do this and i have to
[1:30:40] do that and
[1:30:41] all those things are our parts don't
[1:30:43] don't misunderstand me
[1:30:44] those are all parts but to understand
[1:30:47] that's not the final resting place
[1:30:51] the final resting place is then where
[1:30:53] you're looking at the word and the bible
[1:30:55] says
[1:30:55] his commandments are not grievous
[1:30:58] it's where you find yourself just it's
[1:31:00] being lived out in your
[1:31:02] life and it's joy you're you're laughing
[1:31:04] like that woman was just joy because
[1:31:06] you realize the struggle has ended
[1:31:10] it's no longer i who liveth but christ
[1:31:13] who liveth in me so as the church is
[1:31:15] subject unto christ so let the wives be
[1:31:18] to their own husbands and it goes on to
[1:31:22] say
[1:31:22] as it says in everything and you realize
[1:31:24] from the scripture there
[1:31:26] in colossians 3 18 wives submit
[1:31:28] yourselves unto your own husbands as is
[1:31:30] fit in the lord so when we look at
[1:31:32] everything it's as is
[1:31:34] fit in the lord remember brother brown
[1:31:37] tells us in this way he said if your
[1:31:38] husband maybe you have an
[1:31:40] unbelieving husband or something like
[1:31:41] that and he says well you know what
[1:31:43] you're not going to church anymore i
[1:31:46] think of one sister you know that
[1:31:49] coming and she said her husband said i
[1:31:52] don't want you going back to church no
[1:31:53] more
[1:31:54] and this sister said do you really want
[1:31:56] me to make that decision
[1:31:58] do you want me to make that decision she
[1:32:00] said because i think you know what
[1:32:01] decision i'll make
[1:32:03] you'll be left here alone why
[1:32:06] i'm going to the house of god see the
[1:32:08] word
[1:32:09] remember the word is first in everything
[1:32:13] as is fit in the lord so when she said
[1:32:17] i'm not going to stay here you're trying
[1:32:19] to stop me from going to church
[1:32:20] she was doing as unto the lord she was
[1:32:24] right where she needed to be
[1:32:28] are you with me because even when a wife
[1:32:30] is submitting to the husband
[1:32:32] she's doing it as unto the lord
[1:32:36] verse 25 husbands love your wives
[1:32:39] even as christ i got to leave you with
[1:32:41] this one here this let me leave you this
[1:32:42] this might be a little bit of not
[1:32:44] not salt in the wound because i don't
[1:32:45] believe there's any wound this is just
[1:32:47] teaching tonight but it'll help you give
[1:32:49] a little honey with it
[1:32:51] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:32:54] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:32:57] for it
[1:32:58] this love here it requires more than
[1:33:00] just feeling o love
[1:33:02] this word is a god for love it's
[1:33:06] unconditional
[1:33:08] it's the same love we were writing
[1:33:10] reading about here does not behave
[1:33:11] itself unseemly
[1:33:14] does not seek its own like it's my way
[1:33:16] or the highway
[1:33:18] it does not think no think it does not
[1:33:21] think evil
[1:33:22] i remember last january january 22nd you
[1:33:25] did this
[1:33:26] you always think of no evil
[1:33:30] this is what this love does this is why
[1:33:32] we must have that love agape love
[1:33:35] permeating our earth because this agape
[1:33:36] love you know what it'll do it'll
[1:33:38] cleanse us
[1:33:40] it washes us it cleanses us think about
[1:33:43] it tonight if the love of god coming to
[1:33:45] our hearts
[1:33:46] think about it of even the things i
[1:33:48] heard brother paul say up here
[1:33:50] moments ago of things that maybe
[1:33:52] thoughts and other things like that
[1:33:53] think of the love of god that comes
[1:33:55] to do what cleanse us
[1:33:58] keep us clean to help you and i'd be
[1:34:01] reminded
[1:34:01] that we can be reminded of who we are
[1:34:05] he reminds us he wants us to know that
[1:34:07] so well
[1:34:09] brother brown would say it like this in
[1:34:10] desperations and i'm closing
[1:34:14] he says now he says sister again
[1:34:17] roseanne go down to that where it says
[1:34:18] if you said can you do that
[1:34:21] did i have that do i have that on there
[1:34:23] oh yeah okay good
[1:34:24] if you said you loved your wife and
[1:34:27] never tell her about it
[1:34:28] never sat down make love to her
[1:34:30] expressed it to her
[1:34:32] kiss her hug her you know all that mushy
[1:34:34] stuff
[1:34:35] and tell her she's the best cook in the
[1:34:37] country
[1:34:38] i mean come on if the biscuits went from
[1:34:40] being burnt till
[1:34:42] they're fluffy hey it had to be some
[1:34:45] praise
[1:34:46] right where the rice tastes like rice
[1:34:49] like mama made
[1:34:50] come on now because you know it's
[1:34:51] dangerous if you go to saying
[1:34:53] this ain't like what mama made you're in
[1:34:55] trouble
[1:34:56] if you don't know that by now you're in
[1:34:58] trouble
[1:35:00] so matthew god terry's don't you ever
[1:35:02] compare try to compare somebody to your
[1:35:04] mom's cooking your mom is a good cook
[1:35:05] but don't you ever try to do that
[1:35:09] if you said you loved her and you never
[1:35:10] tell her about it never sit down and
[1:35:11] make love to her express it to her kiss
[1:35:13] her hug her and tell her she's the best
[1:35:14] cook in the country
[1:35:15] all the things that you know and how
[1:35:17] pretty she is and how much you love her
[1:35:19] if you don't do that she'll never
[1:35:22] know it that's the way if you do love
[1:35:26] her
[1:35:27] you express it how many is glad that god
[1:35:30] expressed his love to us
[1:35:32] aren't you glad that god doesn't say hey
[1:35:34] i already told you one time
[1:35:36] what i need to tell you again if i ever
[1:35:38] change my mind i'll let you know
[1:35:42] he doesn't do that as a matter of fact
[1:35:45] he'll come
[1:35:46] you might be right in the middle of the
[1:35:48] day in a time when you're in your lowest
[1:35:50] or your weakest
[1:35:52] maybe it's a time where you've been
[1:35:53] wounded or something's happened or
[1:35:55] whatever and he'll come right to
[1:35:56] his presence will come
[1:35:59] isn't it tremendous of even of times if
[1:36:01] we could say it back to this because
[1:36:03] it's not based on works
[1:36:04] of even of times that we don't deserve
[1:36:09] not that we ever deserve but you
[1:36:11] understand what i'm saying
[1:36:12] in times that we could say boy i mean we
[1:36:14] could feel it like this but here he'll
[1:36:16] come sweeping
[1:36:17] down in his presence and you know his
[1:36:20] presence when it comes like that you
[1:36:21] know he's letting you know
[1:36:23] i love you i love you
[1:36:26] i love you when you go to pray and you
[1:36:28] begin to thank him you know how it is
[1:36:29] when you
[1:36:30] begin to talk to the lord in prayer
[1:36:32] sometimes you know you might seem like
[1:36:33] my
[1:36:34] i feel so twisted up in my spirit i feel
[1:36:36] so i don't even know how to start i
[1:36:38] i don't even feel like this is the flesh
[1:36:40] i don't feel like praying
[1:36:42] but you realize if i can just get in
[1:36:44] there and start to say lord
[1:36:46] i love you i appreciate you so much
[1:36:51] lord jesus for where you brought me from
[1:36:54] how you've changed my life lord how
[1:36:56] you've helped me day after day
[1:36:58] how you've given me strength lord in my
[1:37:00] body how you lord god given me grace
[1:37:02] through tests and trials
[1:37:04] and you begin to find that as that
[1:37:06] praise begins to go forth
[1:37:08] it begins to worship what's happening
[1:37:10] it's creating an atmosphere of honor
[1:37:13] that he'll come down for he dwells
[1:37:16] in the praises of his people amen
[1:37:21] oh my let's bow our heads
[1:37:25] heavenly father
[1:37:29] lord as we thank you lord for such an
[1:37:32] example
[1:37:34] a reality that lord tonight that we're
[1:37:37] not just looking at things
[1:37:39] lord that really that pertain to husband
[1:37:42] and wife
[1:37:44] but we're looking at it lord in a very
[1:37:46] spiritual manner
[1:37:48] this is where paul could write this is a
[1:37:50] great mystery
[1:37:52] which i speak concerning christ in the
[1:37:54] church
[1:37:55] and lord we can relate to that as your
[1:37:58] children
[1:37:59] we can relate to that as the wife
[1:38:03] of the lord jesus that lord we're not
[1:38:06] here tonight
[1:38:08] because of a fear we have to be
[1:38:13] but we're here because we love you
[1:38:17] every day of our life lord the desire is
[1:38:20] to please you
[1:38:22] i think of it lord there's times where
[1:38:24] there's things
[1:38:27] that lord is a faithful husband you
[1:38:29] would come and let me know
[1:38:32] samuel that's that's not pleasing
[1:38:36] it may not even been anything that was
[1:38:38] said it might have just been the
[1:38:39] attitude
[1:38:41] lord you're so mindful
[1:38:45] you come with such with such love
[1:38:48] you realize lord it isn't something
[1:38:50] that's just mushy but it
[1:38:52] that love itself is such a revering and
[1:38:55] a respect it's such an
[1:38:56] honor lord but what it draws out of our
[1:39:00] lives
[1:39:02] is a real reverence back to you
[1:39:05] submitting our lives to you lord
[1:39:08] father i pray here tonight i i don't
[1:39:10] know there
[1:39:12] might be one here tonight there might be
[1:39:14] one streaming by way of the internet
[1:39:15] lord
[1:39:16] maybe one that would even archive this
[1:39:20] but they'd like to trade that slavish
[1:39:22] fear in
[1:39:24] they'd like to trade that surrender that
[1:39:27] lower love that
[1:39:29] love that just in their mind they love
[1:39:32] you
[1:39:33] but it's it's not genuine love of god on
[1:39:36] the inside
[1:39:38] they still dilly dally play with the
[1:39:40] world still have
[1:39:41] lord things of the world in their life
[1:39:44] they're at a place lord that they
[1:39:46] realize i don't want to make excuses no
[1:39:48] more
[1:39:50] i want the love of god down in the
[1:39:52] depths of my soul
[1:39:54] i want that love that's not a fear
[1:39:58] but it's a love that brings such a
[1:39:59] reverence and a humility
[1:40:01] a love that brings a submission to the
[1:40:03] word that
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:06] it's a love to the lord jesus
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:11] father would you just just move down

[1:49:01] lord in a word of prayer and
[1:49:03] i thought i might mention that just in
[1:49:05] case some of you didn't weren't aware of
[1:49:07] it you
[1:49:07] probably were but this would be brother
[1:49:10] doug and
[1:49:11] sister betsy's grandson and so
[1:49:15] you know we just want to we want to just
[1:49:17] go to the lord in prayer
[1:49:19] and we know that whatever the work that
[1:49:21] god starts
[1:49:23] god will finish his work and we just
[1:49:25] want to just just
[1:49:26] invite the presence of god and this the
[1:49:29] same way for
[1:49:30] for devlin as god has dealt with his
[1:49:32] heart and his life
[1:49:33] and just to walk on with the lord that
[1:49:36] god will do a full work
[1:49:37] in his life that the same one who dealt
[1:49:39] with his heart
[1:49:41] that it comes to a place of a real
[1:49:44] uniting
[1:49:45] with the lord jesus christ you know as i
[1:49:48] talked to him here the other day and
[1:49:49] most of you heard this example of times
[1:49:51] but i said you realize that
[1:49:53] as a as a glass itself if i picked up a
[1:49:55] dirty glass right outside my window
[1:49:57] and i offered you a drink out of it
[1:49:59] would you drink out of it
[1:50:01] absolutely not you'd say i'm not
[1:50:03] drinking out of that because it's a
[1:50:04] dirty glass
[1:50:06] but you see in order for that glass the
[1:50:08] ultimate is to
[1:50:10] drink out of it it's first of all got to
[1:50:12] get picked up
[1:50:14] then when it's picked up then there's
[1:50:15] got to be a cleansing
[1:50:17] of that glass a washing of it and that
[1:50:20] washing is
[1:50:22] by the spirit of god the blood of the
[1:50:24] lord jesus christ with the purpose
[1:50:27] that he might have refreshment
[1:50:30] from that life so we just want to invite
