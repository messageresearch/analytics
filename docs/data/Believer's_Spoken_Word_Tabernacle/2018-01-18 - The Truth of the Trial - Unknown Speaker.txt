so grateful to the Lord for His mercy aren't you and I'm so glad to be in the house of the Lord once again tonight man we just want to go right into the word and turn our attention there you'd like to stand with me let's go to first Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 I just felt pressed of the Lord last Thursday after the service and I haven't been able to get through that quote at all and I just felt pressed to the Lord and praying and kept looking and putting things down and Friday and then Saturday the whole day was dealing with dealing with this and I want to just take of it we take like uh maybe an intermission on the loyalty of your heart and look at that because we know that all of that is the loyalty of our heart is what is displayed through them through the midst of the trial but yet in the end before the trial itself I want to look here at a thought on the truth of the trial the truth of the trial so first Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 look how Paul deals with with the believers bringing them from everything that God has brought Israel through coming out of the land and verse 12 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall there have no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it notice this next verse and how that this is length right in here it's not oddly places its divinely placed wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry idolatry we know is that which is not the truth it's not true it's not real there's only one that is true and that is real that's gone is that right let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer our Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord we've the Lord opened the lids of this Bible and we've read Lord of your word but father we need more than just looking at Lord and reading the letters we need you Lord there author to come tonight Lord and to speak to our hearts Lord and now Lord God not only giving us understanding the Lord God within your word but father that your presence would just set down here tonight Lord in each and every one of our lives and our hearts and Lord calls us to have an understanding of application we pray that Lord that you will just speak to us tonight Lord and just take us Lord completely Lord into your your control in your hands Lord for the next few moments Lord we pray Lord we just give ourselves to you now and we ask Lord for every request and every need Lord I think of Lord here today I received Lord a text from brother David crest jr. Lord you know the need there in this body Lord with this blood pressure right now I pray that God that you'll just strengthen him Lord as he's resting there Lord at home under doctor's orders I pray that God that the Spirit of God would just move for him tonight Lord God calls those numbers Lord God to be lowered Lord to where they need to be out pray father and Lord just touching his body Lord of that sinus affection Lord that Lord has come against him Lord you know the needs of each and every one Lord and Lord perhaps there's more Lord but you know each and every one and we just asked tonight Lord that you would touch each and every heart and every life Lord ministering to every need Lord we pray those of us that are present those that are streaming those that we'll even have to go Lord and archiving Lord we ask it now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and may God blesses your being seated I find that that that verse of scripture I've always found that verse of scripture to be peculiar I dealt with it different times but when I look at how that when Israel remember when they come out of Egypt and they came out and it was indeed with not only with the blood but truly with with great power and there was great joy among them when they had come out of Egypt and with we would have maybe been able to ask them at first when they came out of Egypt it would have been much just like in our journey when God first came to our lives and God brought deliverance to us and no doubt within many of their lives you think of how many miracles and supernatural things that has taken place within their life but now there's gonna be times within the journey that they're gonna be brought to testing times there's gonna be situations that God will actually allow and permit and actually will guide them into places that where there's no other way for them to get out we know the Red Sea we know the the bitter waters and we see all of that and you know you you think of it many times of how that we still will look at it of how that God would would speak here in fleeing from idolatry no doubt about it that the people when they left Egypt they never ever thought they would have to go through or encounter some of the things they encountered never thought they would have to do that and then when these things came along their way no doubt it was it was things that we know they rose up and said why why is this happening and I don't understand this and and through the midst of the tests and trial it wasn't that that it weakened Israel it actually strengthened Israel there was weeding out that took place in the midst of the testing times there were all of those things that had taken place during those times but yet in the midst of it there was a reality that we're in that for them there was a need to be rafflesia and yet it's deeper it's so much deeper than that of the golden calf because idolatry itself is just even a thought and you know that you and I can get within our thoughts and thoughts themselves can become thinking they can become that of where an image can begin to be crafted and idea and all that lays right there within the imagination that's the very framework and how things can begin to can be contrived and brought together there's not one person in here tonight that you haven't thought wrongly about something and you maybe have thought about it and then you went ahead and acted upon what you thought and then it comes down to the to the end result of it you you acted wrongly and what you acted wrong on you acted wrong on what you thought or perceived and we know that within it that God's desire is not that you and I would would walk by our own contrived perceptions and you know if we get to looking at the things like brother Branham told us he said you are putting before the people as though that it's a flowery bed of ease and just come and serve the Lord and all your troubles are solved and you'll have no more tensions he said that is not the truth you add tension when you become a Christian you don't there's not an alleviation of trials as a matter of fact as the Prophet would put it like this he said you were just slopping along when you were out in the world but he said as soon as you say that I've got the Holy Ghost he said every gun out of hell is trained upon you then so there's a testing it's a trying it's approving and and God as we've looked at this here in some previous services God loves to bring the testing and the trying to is to his children in first John 5:20 one would even reiterate you know little children keep yourself from idols and when I look at this I always think of many different places brother ran would speak about them in idles and how easily things can be crafted but I look at the message the unchangeable God and brother Bev said it like this he said the thing is with people is the way God appears many times we want to make an idol out of God we ask God to do something and then he must do it just the way that we ask it or we'll say he never answered when we do that we weaken our faith in God and we weaken our testimony when we do not take him at his word God always answers in that the truth God always answers no one ever asked he said jesus said ask and you shall receive seek and ye shall find everyone that asks will receive everyone that seeks shall find everyone that knocks it'll be open to them now that's the only way that I've always found it that I can get anything from God he has take him at his word and believe it the way he sends it now if we do not take it just that way that we think it is we've built God as an idol he's got to answer just according to our ways well it's just no good he did answer us God answers in many ways he answers in peculiar ways times and everything is odd all in the moulding and the making and you there's a lot of things with that Dollar Tree as they as I said that even sometimes in our mind we we recognize that God I tell you in my own life right now God is more real to me now than he was when I first met him he is more real now I can tell you that the distances of things that happen if I can say miraculously where the supernatural it's not an everyday thing that's not that way with any believer that's the book of X the book of Acts was over men he wasn't over days it was over years but you see if if all of those times if those things God allows it to be in those proving times that you and I can be tested and proven and to think what if it what kind of an idea I want you to think of this what kind of an idea would you have of God if every time you were sick God healed you and you never had to go to a doctor never had to take a medicine you're what you would develop within that is say that you know what real faith is you don't have to go to a doctor and that's an idol that's not true there are many things in the messages that brother Branham says your first duty when you're sick is to go to your doctor multiple times you said it so it's not that a person has more faith but you see sometimes there's things that are idols where people are giving themselves too and I'll just say it like this we all need to continually be cleansed of the Lord and in one of these things right here is even looking at how that trials themselves and what is really the truth of what a trial is all about and we we look at that here that how that James would speak of and I want to just pull out a few words here in James chapter one verse two my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations now notice the word count it means to consider deem account or think of it think of it consider it this way this is the way that your to think of it when these things have come about knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience in first Peter chapter four verse twelve there's a few words I want to look at in here he says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you what's he dealing with they're thinking because if Satan can get him in their thinking you'll defeat him he'll whip them because of the thinking he listened to a real child of God born again and sealed by the Spirit of God he'll never move that person from God no you can't separate them that's impossible but what but within the midst of it that the thinking about things to understand what is going on and this is where Peter said think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange things happened unto you like what's going on I know I understand I understand that even as being mature Christians and years on down the road that it is and all of a sudden when a trial shows up that you or I have become so mature that automatically we kick in gears oh it's just the trial v here that will happen that would it's something that immediately if it does something's wrong because immediately as a believer you go to check where you're standing with the Lord that's the first thing you do checking where you're standing we know that our sacrifice is perfect but you begin to check in your life and knowing that God if there's anything there God will bring that out but then you can begin to see when something will come out and you can begin to recognize wait a minute wait a minute this is a trial this is a test it doesn't mean that at that point in time we say okay mom we're just going continue to go about business and my everything is just happening and hunky-dory and whatever more no but neither doesn't mean that we are are down and moving down in the mullet groves you might get down joke got down but God's grace is sufficient to pick you up and God might have to pick you up today pick you up tomorrow pick you up the next day pick you up the next day you say I just seen that man going through a trial he was rejoicing yesterday he's down in the dust but you let all of a sudden something drop in his heart about the Lord you'll hear praise come out of there hmmm he'll give glory to God this is not about a show or put all I know we understand that but fake it not strange of the fiery trial and that strange that first word that's there the two strangers they're not the same think it not strange as there's something that's a surprise or astonished by the novelty of the thing to be surprised as tavad astonished at the novelty or strangeness of a thing that as as as a believer that we're going to be tested and tried absolutely we're going to be tested and tried and we are being tested and tried listen to me friends we're being in tested and tried by every word of God that's this bride is being tested by every word of God take it not strange notice the next part as something that is a like an alien from a person or thing without the knowledge or without a share in to be unheard of like what is this that's going on and you know Israel was like that when things come up well what is this what's going on why did you lead us to bitter waters we said we were thirsty don't you know where that clear Springs are at why we were asking for fares you lead us to bitter waters God knows what he's doing God is trying anything he's making himself known again and again how many of you want God to make himself known again and again I want God to continue to make himself known to me and in my life right here in this church and then in the midst of all that that were asking God to continue to make himself known he's not going to make himself known in a status of comfort oh my god we'll take things right out of the nest bill event says if God don't take things out of the nest he said that little baby could say oh my mom was so great oh my mom is so great hold on he said he don't know how great his momma is but he said when mama gets her things out of the nest and that little one gets to fly then he said when they gets to fallen it's not able to someone catch itself mama sweeps in he said he's never saw mama with them wings before like that he's never saw mama come out like that but you see what it is mama has quite brought about or allowed a situation that she might make herself known in a way that that little Eagles never know mama before so think it not strange oh my love this is tremendous but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy and you look at how that in three kinds of believers let me read a little bit more here in this quote and come back over a few areas I've covered he said joke went through the trials and the tests his children taken everything else taken the church members come and accused him of being a secret center and tried to say everything against him but yet he wouldn't listen to any of it he knowed he had met God's requirements he know there's no need of Satan trying to tempt him he knowed it was the devil and what did he know was the devil trying to come against the sacrifice he knew that's the devil and as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job with what was the devil trying to do for a wedge put a wedge between job and God they're right but when job once struck that revelation that it was not God he was only going through his trials to make him something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it and the same thing today he'll try to tell you these trials and things is your God trying to put punishment upon you it isn't so no sir it's Satan doing that and God permitting it to temper you to make you see if you're tied to this earth by the earth cares or whether your treasures is in heaven for wherever your treasure is there you are also your heart is where your treasures are now look out the brother branham brings us out and recognising your day and its message and he's talking about how that God comes and God vindicates his word he said job never recognized that it was God as long as the devil can make you believe some time that the little trials you go through is God punishing you it was God trying to show him something job never recognized it till he saw a vision and like Moses when Moses saw the vision the pillar find their bush it was vindicated so where where was job being whipped not on his sacrifice he was being whipped in his thinking because Satan was telling him it was his God that was punishing him ah you know I said back there you know sometimes I put him put a lot of different notes but I got to looking at one part in I thought why did I put this part in here why did I put this in here in the inspiration on Saturday back on Saturday morning why was I and I got to looking at I didn't include it in the notes there but I got to looking at that and and what I'm looking at is how that it was in God you have to remember that God Himself when we look at the term of punishment there's one there's a place in the scripture that speaks of punishment and it speaks of those who are set to depart into everlasting punishment but God brings correction that all right the Prophet Blaise it very clearly like this you just have to follow me on this out of the church age book he says he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and chasten to rebuke is to reprove and to reprove is to expose with a view to correction now now look at that to reprove is what expose for what reason for correction not reprove that it might just leave you bet but it's to expose for correction Jason does not mean to punish what what in sight by the Spirit of God into the word Jason does not mean to punish it means to discipline because the subjects amendment is in mine so when God is chastening it's not God punishing it's correction that is coming but Faris there must be reproof and as reproof comes then God his discipline is always with the vision and what God is doing think of how that God has brought a word in this hour and here we are feeding on that word and the Holy Spirit bringing that word down here into our lives and bringing application to us instructing you and I by his Spirit leading us in this hour to think of it of how that the Holy Spirit has given and in this hour if it had not been given in that way we would not be where we are today because what the discipline there of the word to stay in it every time just like when you're disciplining your children it's disciplining or things that that are corrected it's because of what you can see in the future it's not about they're annoying me they're bothering me that's that's not that's not discipline but discipline we understand that is with the subjects amendment in mind looking ahead into the future and if this goes on now where will it be Zin is that right so here that's how God God is preparing he trains you and I because even when you look in the scriptures in Hebrews chapter 12 if I can just refer to a few places there you find of how that the Spirit of the Lord moving through Paul in rend Hebrews 12 would bring there the distinction of the chastening and the rebuke despise not when without the chastening of the Lord and here when we look at the chastening chastening is not just just correction where in terms that there's contact that's made but it's as a matter of fact we we understand that and I'm just going to just preach it but it's something that it's called it's ongoing there is so many opportunities even throughout a day would you it with your children and even in the hours if they go to school and here they are told there's so many opportunities to instruct and to admonish them and so many different things to show them different things talk to them about different things you understand well they don't know how to change the tire on a lawnmower did you ever show in the same don't get upset with somebody when another brother shows them how to change the tire but you see it's just all of these things are a part of it little things that can be being be shared that's all chastening and it's things that are our our guidance and direction upon things right now to help guide and train the individual alone so it's even having a correct view of even looking of that of really what chastening is I'm not going to stay too long on that here but how that God Himself within it we understand that chastening is not to punish God is interested in bringing about maturity in our lives this is why that the Prophet after coming through that of the molding and the making there even within Hebrews twelve he would speak of how that God's desire is in love a family of his own a family of sons sons like himself he said therefore all all before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay and out of the same look he will now make vessels unto honor and under dishonor the choosing will be his choosing you know God don't make one man dishonorable and another honorable but the same that he just said right there that he will now make vessels unto honor and to dishonor but God don't make people dishonorable and other people honorable but the presence of his word his life only ripens what is there that's all I can do God does not mean take pigs and make sheep out of them come on somebody he reveals to the sheep that's they're living like a pig that you are not a pig you are a sheep right you never became a sheep on a certain day but being a sheep you were called and brought to God through the process of justification sanctification and the new birth that shows you are she then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to his image in their walk how how could I ever train these boys if I never had them if they hadn't been born how can I train them they won't understand they wouldn't understand my ways they wouldn't understand the things I'm saying but there had to come a birth first and there are things that have company when they were born there were things that fit it at that time just like God knows how to fit things at our time God knows just how when we are in need and he knows just what we're able to handle well I know sometimes we think we can really handle this and handle that and God I could really handle this but you see God knows what you and I really are able to handle because there ain't none of us and nobody is above Apostle Paul are you with me but Paul himself had to continue as God allowed that reoccurrence with his eyes over and over why did God do that why did he do it here's a prophet of God a servant of God an apostle why did God do that what does our Bible say less I should get insulted but isn't he a child of God shouldn't he be able to keep himself in subjection there is a measure where God himself has required of you and I to keep our lives in subjection by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and yet God in His great mercy and grace permits trials and tests to come our way to do what keep us in a place of humility depending on him lest I should become exalted hey man so there's a training I mean let me just move on when you look at how these things were job in the midst in the midst of this time there's been a conversation that has taken place in heaven joke doesn't know about it his buddies don't know about it I don't care how spiritual they were they didn't know it you with me here is Joe standing as a prophet of God and God here when the sons of God have come to present themselves Satan comes with them and now aren't you looking for a time we're no longer signal no longer be around you I am notice this in job chapter 1 verse 8 here the Lord said unto Satan that's not considered my servant joke have you looked at him have you thought about him who are you talking about not just Joe my servant Joe have you considered him that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that fears God and eschewed evil there's no doubt about it this man was full of mistakes just like you and I are but how was how was God able to stand here and say he's a perfect man because Joe had a perfect faith in a perfect revelation of a perfect sacrifice and he moved with obedience and God was looking at the sacrifice because that's where job was standing hallelujah the devil was not going to get job away from the sacrifice hallelujah it would be easier to cut him over it and take his heart out you cannot separate the uniting of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost with it yes a seal that's been pressed there on the soul there is nothing that can come between in that soul getting in the spirit working through those things well that's where we have to stand and stand and don't allow and say Lord if there's anything Lord pearls Clin not know what I'm saying right you can get weak in your spirit you falter in your spirit you can say it man or not but I've seen every one of you enough now to know when there's times you're down in times when you're up and you can be ready just like a book that's the truth now remember don't get out of that idolatry but I mean if you went through the tenth wait wait a minute that's idolatry because everybody the tests and trials that come remember it's personal temptations I do not have to go through the exact trial that brother Joey went through brother joy does not have to go through the exact trial - adilyn through but that do have to be tried and I am being tried he has to be tried and God knows exactly what he's doing this ain't no Sears and Roebuck harmony house if God made us a variety god knows each and every one of us he knows our temperament he knows our makeup these tests and trials are not just things that scattered out like 50 to pick up these trials are designed and tailor-made for you and I it isn't just what what why would this fall my way oh no how did these bitter waters come no see before we can ever get to rejoicing in understanding the glory of all the value of what their trials about we can't have the the thinking of what what's this going on what's this happening I'll tell you how powerful this is brother man preach in the Hebrew series brother Ram said just after in Hebrews 4 he said just after I got done preaching this morning about Israel complaining and asking God why and why and why and why over he said I had people come tonight in the prayer line asking me why what's he doing he's pointing to church you didn't hear what the words were saying this morning the world was trying to help you but you were so blocked off in what was going on in your life well I said instead of giving yourself in prostration to God they were prostrating to an idol whoo because there's flatline is how was this going on this can't be going on to a child of God what have I done wrong what no no it isn't that you've done anything wrong it's that God Himself has been bragging on you whoo you know friends this is this is the truth it amazes me I I don't understand how that in the midst of a time or in the midst even in the services when the word is coming forth when you're giving yourself to the word to me these are things it's not coincidental there are things that even when I look back through that he over the course of even last week coming into this we bet our messages that even I was listening to at that time that the Spirit of God was quickening statements over and over that was ministering to me during that time and causing my fate to increase what was it it was the word who on the feeling below tender and say that's exactly right Lord oh my he just since said just a sir just you know just a real peace right there thank you Lord for your word so Satan took everything around me all of his possessions children everything around him he didn't touch his wife what they were one glory he come there and notice here's job after all this is done the Bible says at the end of that chapter joke continued on in all this he sinned not foolishly in all of this he was still going on he was still standing steadfast in the word Satan said here he is the Saints sons of God come again to present themselves and Satan says he up was about time to go to the house of God I'll go so here he presents himself and notice how God says this in verse three he adds a little bit of a dragon to it how many you want gone to brag on you some people have both hands are setting out of there this is the results of God bragging on you when you're going through a test go through a trial God's been bragging on you but see our minds don't think that way see job's not thinking this way but my greatest God you know he's not thinking this way and the Lord said unto Satan verse 3 of job - hath stopp'd considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and eschewed evil and steals look at God testified still he hold it fast his integrity although that moves me against him to destroy him without cause God's testified of who he is and testified of how he's standing in the midst of the circumstance well my but Satan wasn't done things that you letting me touch his life man will give everything for his health for his life God said go ahead but you can't take his life you can afflict him but you cannot take his life see God has the boundary set he will not suffer you to be tested tempted above what you're able to bear see this wasn't God saying oh my goodness I wonder if job's gonna be able to do this I hope so oh oh my goodness somebody can bring me more fingernails to chew I hope Jobs gonna make it know what is God what is God reason how can God stand like this is it because of the flesh of job does he have a pedigree within his flesh was as his as genetics celebrate his manda solicitude that joke can remember scripture here scripture there scripture here is that what God got faith in no but job what does God have faith in his servant is hiding and abiding in the sacrifice that has been revealed by we beat a god so here you have one of these good friends it comes by and he's got the solution these guys came I don't know how long they preached to him and they were just rattling it one right after another here is a life as in joke fine he is telling joke that you're trying the trial what's going on it's God punishing you and it's because you're a sinner you've got sin in your life now look how your life has stands and speaks this behold happy is the man whom God corrected that is true is that right hello is that the word there therefore despise not the chastening of the Almighty that's the word wrong application that's the word but a wrong application why is it a wrong application lack of understanding lack of understanding who Oberlin Samuel these people understand God but they don't understand the sacrifice to the true depth see they don't know the depth of that sacrifice so they only know God according to the depth that they know the sacrifice in for he maketh sore and Banda thug he wounded and his hands make whole we can say Amen to all of that but yet they have no understanding in what they're saying but how that these individuals continue to speak to job over and over one right after another one right after another brother Brent says after Satan got doing got done got done with what he doing he said Satan removed himself but here the friends remained you get the faith who was worse these are church folks come on somebody these are individuals that that that jump on the set brother Eli fast brother bill death move somebody these are individuals but you get to look anything my lord I mean this is where they're coming and the things that they're speaking about what they don't realize that they're coming and they're talking about his sacrifice now what's this in the message in the message fellowship brother Brett says job a righteous man a godly man everything against him one day Satan took a notion to make him deny God he said I love to read Joe many people say it's a riddle it isn't it's the Word of God Jesus referred to JoVE about have you heard the patience no matter what was going on how much he was persecuted how much he was called that he was in the wrong path job stayed packed on the world I like that he said peradventure my children have sinned I'll offer a sacrifice for them now the only thing the man knew was the burnt offering that was God's requirement and many people think sometimes because disaster happens to a Christian oh he got off the will of God they left the church they went out sometimes that's not right thinking what's he dealing with idolatry thinking and that's thinking here's the thing here's the part not only is it damaging toward the individual that would be going through the trial but who it's really damaging it's down because what happens to them when their trial comes their way then it's really gonna be the world is this you remember brother branham nd in the adoption series there is be talking about bringing the things everything coming into a maturity we understand that bringing the people into the birth into the land and then in the maturity and standing there strong with the faith in the sacrifice and then he begins to break off right in there and I think it's also in taking sides with Jesus he talks about how that people write their they'll say this right there at the Brennan Tabernacle to show you that there was not anything that was immune their brother bran was not talking to people just out here in organization this message is to us this message is to us it applies to today that's exactly right that's why even everything with organization and denomination it is it were beyond though it applies to today it's a discerning of any spirit that is contrary to the true atonement that right but many had thought brother branham's accident with the gun they thought he addresses it they've got something wrong there then he says and some of you thinking with brother Neville had the bad car accident something was wrong there you see I don't believe that the people mean to be that way it's the lack of understanding it isn't that you or me or whatever would would have to mean to be thinking in this way I don't believe that nobody wants to think this way but you can see how that a thought pattern can just start and it Kurt starts going and then before the person themselves it takes place then there in defeat what do i do what do I do God's punishing me the Lord's against me let me tell you something it seems like that I noticed this over the years and when I've dealt and talked right here and I've talked in other places as well where sometimes we're individuals they'll go in and how they'll say well that devil been bothering me all about my past and things from things you know years ago and whatever more that's as a true statement the devil is not God if you're repented of it and put it in the blood of Jesus Christ it's been put there it's not to be remembered no more but sometimes this would things in things that where the enemy will come and he'll come against people upon those things well this is why you're going through this it's because of this is because of that that God's got a case he can lay it out but know where you stand in that you've met God's requirements and when you know your standard me you've met God's requirements you can stand on that and allow God to bring delight you when you need it on the trial that you're going through you know sometimes the trials that you go through even right now you even when you come out of them you can't come out of the trial say you know what I know this trial this trial was it made me this way because five years from now five years from now I'm gonna be doing this and I'm gonna be doing that and so that's the why they come here and let's deflate you a little bit it'll happen that way God didn't do his profits and nobody else that way so he don't expect you to walk that that your victory in a trial is that you know all job could say I know when I come through this I'll come forth this pure soul that's what I know he did not know whoa this other been awaited him but I know I'm come forth purest gold knew that many people think sometimes he says because disaster happens to a Christian he got off the will of God they left the church they went out sometimes that's not right now notice I says it sometimes it's not right you know God loves people so much he loves his children then even when they themselves somebody might get so discouraged and yeah you know within their walk and maybe they they're not where they're and the enemy just poured in honestly you'll never have that you'll never live a victorious life and they just feel like you know what I'm just giving up and they hear they they backslide on God but God's love will reach out to them and if they won't heed to it God will bring correction to drive them back somebody it could be a sickness it'd be a disease and God will permit that to bring them back man I've watched it I've seen it I thank God I don't think God for the sickness or the disease no more than you do but what I thank God for is that there was one Satan you thought you had you never had him you never had her little repeater God ain't that wonderful God just reaches down it some matches in right away what Satan got he had in the goodie bag and take it home new sometimes that's not right because God chastens every son that comes to him he cleanses him purchase him tries to see if he will stand that's what he was doing in the time of job in the evening messenger he said now remember job all of his trials that wasn't God chastening job it was God approving his servant so it all worked for good you see when the book of Job was wrote for all generations for a testimony look at that now for a testimony God's working it for God in the message Victor day I'm just trying to move forward here now remember God has did you worthy when you have a test this is the truth of the trial don't fail to get this get this when you have a trial or test it shows the grace of God has found you found favor with God and God believes that you'll stand the test Wow in another part here in a victory day right on down when it looks like I love that when it looks like it ain't when it looks like everything has gone wrong God is giving you a trial hey don't just give you individually he gives the church a trial sure he does hello he'll bring everyone is trying it's proving it's showing as a matter of fact the brother Brenda makes us so clear he said the church that is not suffering is the church that don't got it dealing with idolatry there he says you know even he said he's got confidence in you he don't have to baby you around you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid you're a real Christian nah I like good strong plants don't you not like strong plants I don't like plants that are wimpy and weak and finicky and whatever more I don't I don't plant them I don't like them I like things that as we know them are Hardy now just because they're Hardy doesn't mean they don't need tender nourishing care they need care they need a lot more care even in the beginning in the initial setting of the roots but after that has the planet set here to continue to go up you don't have to be babied around you might forget to prune it this season oh well it'll be all right you're a real Christian not a hotbed plant a hybrid God has given you a test see what you'll do about it no wonder Peter said these fiery trials like and all joy it's more precious to you and gold many times we harm and haul that can't be a new song coming home oh well if I just well well that's something God give you something God give you to overcome the same if I want to be an overcomer then there's things to overcome well I believe that I have already overcome you have already overcome the world if you've been born of the Spirit of God you've already overcome the things of the world and as the overcomer is in you he manifests himself as an overcomer through you to overcome he knows you'll do it he's put trust in you and the message the approach to God he said if you ever noticed he said when disaster struck job's home the children was all killed and everything job all job had was destroyed God wasn't rebuking job he was only purging job well he said Amen I like that word purge the branch that bears fruit than God purges it that it'll bring forth more fruit the trouble of it is we think sometimes God's angry with us we think what's the trouble we think you mean the troubles not the trial no the trouble is we think through trials not to travel the trial is the instrument or the tool to bring forth the product that's why I said last week when the inspiration struck just even about this right here you don't see the Saul's the table saw everything the ruler the level the the screwdrivers the router you don't see that up here I'm not preaching behind those tools I am preaching behind a production those tools were used to make and the trial itself is tools that are given to bring forth that image out of our life it purges that purge I got the look and you know and you think of how a purge a purge itself it gets rid it's a cleansing in John 15 verse 1 he said I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away in every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit some of you that have fruit trees or those of you it's worked with him you know there's got to be pruning you don't prune them there will be no producing but they've got to be pruned and it's not just snipping them off but there is a method to it I'm not professing to know it but I do know that there's a method to and I know the one thing with the fruit tree you got to open it up so the light gets in the center you have to open it your pruning that tree a man is able to look at that one who would stand there within those orchards and grow in those things he knows exactly how to prune and those things to prune off whereas for you and I we would look at and say why are you pruning this one instead of this one right here why are you taking away this part of the branch and not this one over here what but he knows what he's doing why he's after a yield of more fruit that's why he's purging that's why the cleansing that's why the movie and you realize that even in that word purge I got to looking at that word purge you realize what purge is it's even to remove an unwanted feeling to remove to purge to get rid of to cleanse God purge Paul he was purging life that God himself that that word - the humility could continue to flow forth and that word that God had given oh my and the approach to God I I'm closing he said here's a little thing I want you to notice after all the turmoil and everything was over God had taken all of his sheep his cattle his horses and things then at the end of his chastisement or purging God TT if he had 10,000 cattle he give him 20,000 pounds in their marvelous God perch Jill for the purpose to bless you the trial was to purge that yard my blessing you say brother Brennan I'm a Christian and I got a sickness now I wonder why God may be purging you give you some trials make you draw a little closer together pray awhile then you heal you pray awhile then he heal you you see this isn't just he makes a way that we might be able to bear it's not an exit door out of it nor which one of these walls are was one of these walls were halted no that's not the way that he makes out of it His grace is sufficient to guide and direct us through it make you draw a little closer to him pray awhile then heal you that you can have a testimony Christ heals you you say well I heal I heard he healed others he said but then you're the husband men is the partakers of the fruit then so it's no longer than what you've heard but now I see he is a healer I no longer heard he's a deliverer I know he's a deal he restoreth nice aren't you glad through the trial through the test oh my I'm glad that he restored my brings everything you look everything else it was doubled around it was the blessing that came after the purging but the child the purging was not God punishing Joe but it was God heard you removing it was God approving Joe yes sir this is the truth of the trial suffer a little while then after he said I establish you each and every one that cometh to God Hebrews twelve declares this and it is the truth your tests it and you try and you can even witness this as an individual that the moment how a person will turn and God has touched your life and you surrender your life to the Lord yes that God has called you may the light might steal at all sorts of all world within it but your heart has been turned to the Lord and there will be afflictions there'll be things that have come right at you see what are you gonna do you're gonna turn around or are you gonna keep pressing on to say I know that God who who spoke to my life I believe that that promise is for me so you keep you stand there and you you keep making another step chasing in comes correction comes but you stand there and say I want to be a vessel in his service sir you don't know what you have to go through in order to to come into here but I want to be in his service think of what the Queen of Sheba when she looked at Solomon's house I want you to understand this she saw the working she saw the discernment but then when she turns to behold he's beholding his house she sees the conduct the Bible says that she noticed even how the servants carried the meat and what a blessed thing she said it is to be in this house she noticed every detail or was it the effects of the Living God to believe and know that living God the supernatural God was present to train his children to conform to his image in their walk no doubt there was purged and it was cleansing but all was for the glory of God it's the truth of the trial simple but it's true say North cast down any idol cast down any slot Lord he's not against me he is for me if God be for us who can be against us senator what's the value of that so that you can count it all joy count it all joy so that you can do as the scripture said rejoice in these things Lord Jesus what do we thank you for your word tonight lord thank you Lord Jesus how the Lord that you speak to our hearts upon these things Lord God just to me Lord even in the profoundness of it it's things that it's not Lord our memory it's not our memory it's not our memory of these things Lord because Lord just just memory alone doesn't pack power the father to think back and lord when things Lord would come about I'm so thankful so thankful Lord for your presence Lord and how that you would draw near and direct us Lord in the midst of these things Lord that right here that where Lord were not walking as Lord as as believers and why why is this happening Lord God there may be Lord questions but Lord in our hearts what is the most important thing is being established in you Lord understanding that we need Lord even in that of the trial will get it Lord when we need it but in the midst of it Lord our testimony is that father in all things you are faithful Lord I'm so thankful for that but that's just not words I'm grateful Lord for that resounding reality Lord that father in the midst of it Lord or we can stand say Lord I don't know how but I know I'm gonna be stronger I know we're gonna be stronger I don't know how this is your word and your word I'm just standing on your word as you have said it would but after we've suffered then ulis been establish us Lord God I pray tonight may we take Lord from that refreshment Lord from your presence coming through the word and I pray that Lord you give strength and give comfort away now Lord tonight maybe perhaps Lord maybe perhaps it was just for one Lord I don't know but if that be so which I know that you'll do things just for one person you called Philip away from a revival for one person you kept the Lord Jesus and directed him to the well of samara for one person so I want to thank you lord it just shows how great your love and care is that's your love and care it's not based on the number that needed the Lord I find in my own heart Lord that even as these things were dropping Lord right after the service that you pressed on my heart lay this out next Thursday lord I thank yous I look through these things Lord I never you know my heart I don't study Lord based on knowledge but it's based on inspiration sometimes Lord that inspiration sometimes it comes I just it floods down then there's other times the Lord we're just waiting praying looking to you nonetheless Lord I rejoice in your word Lord and I want to say thank your father Lord for the truth of the trial it doesn't take the trial away it doesn't take the circumstances or the tests the Lord God it helps us to look at it with a right understanding Lord and then we can look up to you Lord who gives grace sufficient for what we have need of grace that is measured to meet what we need in this moment Lord God no doubt sitting here Lord some of your children Lord different trials and tests that they are are facing and they're going through right now in their own life maybe Lord it's something that would be on a job a family something Lord God long maybe it finances or you you know the need maybe its sickness Lord in their body I pray Lord God here tonight Lord just taking that word and applying it and Lord God just entering in with the worship Lord to be able to say thank you Lord I'm thankful what God for your grace or God where I have I found favor in your eyes but lord I need grace to go through this trial would I need grace Lord honor I'm not asking you to take the trial away I'm asking you just to give me the grace that I need to go through Lord Jesus I'm thankful for that the Lord God there's not one of us the Lord God Lord God when we begin to see the real value of it we don't want to dodge our trials Lord we don't want to dogs trials because we realize the Lord and these are instruments tools that have been selected to be able Lord to shape mold to temper to purge to cleanse all of those things Lord that your glory might be reflected in us not for our sake but for thy sake are we killed all the day long we love you Lord Jesus that you might be reflected in our lives what I want to ask you I'll start right here I'll ask you Lord I ask you on behalf of everyone in your Lord forgive us when we have complained forgive us Lord God that in the midst of when that trial that test arises Lord God that disturbs what we consider our tranquility our peace forgive us Lord because that's what we're really come that's what we're complaining about I ask you Lord forgive me Lord and father God with each and every one that would want to be remembered Lord in this prayer I ask you Lord God to forgive them Lord as well or do we realize this Lord but we know that God it must be more than us our knowledge it is in our knowledge that kicks in in these times Lord the father it's that understanding Lord that hole that anchor that in the midst Lord when our mind could go a certain way you know Lord thank you at that direction that rests within our heart that I know I know that God is in control Lord we love you we thank you tonight Lord I pray the Lord you'd strengthen each and every one Lord if there's one here tonight that doesn't know you Lord may I pray that God that they would surrender their heart in their life to you father for you give strength you give Lord an anchor that holds in the midst of the storm thank you Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music]
