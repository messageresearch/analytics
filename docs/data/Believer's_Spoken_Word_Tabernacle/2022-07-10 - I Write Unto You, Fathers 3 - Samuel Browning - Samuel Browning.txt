face [Music] so bravely run the race till we see christ [Music] amen just so grateful to be back together again amen and uh certainly appreciate your prayers this past week and the lord was so good to us and the services you know every every camp is different when you go to it and i'm talking about not just the facilities i'm talking about each year at the same camp it's different and so we just thank the lord for his mercy and god gave just such grace there was breakthrough at the camp with hearts and lives and god helped many many hearts and lives and i certainly believe that we'll continue to see the the testimonies that will continue to come in from that and i certainly want to say i know that it was your prayers and you were joined with many others that were praying for the services and it's just quite something when you i know that for some of you haven't you haven't been there but when i when you see everything at at the meeting from the ministry that's going on you have in the morning you have three different places where there's ministry going on you have the the children up to age 13. in a little tabernacle and when i say little that's just because of their age and the way that they relay and bring the gospel right down into their level and just to seeing the holy spirit just moving among them and then you have the group that's 14 to 18 and they're in the main tabernacle and there's ministry in the morning there and then the group of 19 and older which is that's the group that i had this year they were just laying in teaching bringing bringing things down the things that they're facing and will be moving in into their life and you have three different parts but that's not all every one of the staff and everything that's there the dorm leaders i tell you what there's things that after the ministering sometimes you know we don't walk out of that everybody comes together from 14 on up in the main tabernacle at night and sometimes from a service like that we don't walk out of that service until 11 11 30 still working with hearts and then there's some counselors are still in there some counselors remain some of those children young young people are not getting back to their dorms to 1 30 2 in the morning god just moving down and they see a living lord jesus christ and it's just a moment of breakthrough and we witnessed that and uh this this week and you know sometimes it's a little hard i in in in sometimes the services like i told you sometimes the atmospheres sometimes we have to press even when we come here and um but you know just because we have to press it's one of those things we just realized okay i sense this i'm gonna have to press a little bit it's just like in those services you could kind of ins and some of the things starting up okay we're gonna have to press and you know sometimes what we would do and we start seeing that i start looking strategically where i'm gonna set that night i start look where am i going to sit you want to i want to find a place where i can start pulling and just pulling the presence of god right back over like like a like a like like a like a sheet or a tent just getting right in there let's just let's just pull pull on the gift of god and so we start you know you start kind of strategically positioning yourselves and then i think that be something good here for the assembly as well there's times where we as we come in and we can sense sometimes you know it becomes to us sometimes what are we going to do sometimes when there's might be seems like a tense service like boy brother brian's having a hard time brother so-and-so's having a hard time well you know they keep putting bullets in the gun we want we want to get in there and say yes lord that's why we keep that's why with the song is that keep singing keep singing just leave it leave it leave it leave it lead us into that present because as we move into that place right there sometimes it can be tight because you know we go through things sometimes our spirits we can be tight is that right then sometimes as we move into those places say god help us and we just start pressing in there and start pressing in you know and so it's just like brother brian i heard what he said today how he felt and sometimes when sometimes we don't always feel that way is that right that's where a sacrifice of praise comes in that's where sacrifice comes in and that's where sometimes we just we we do it not because we feel sometimes you we just we don't feel but we do it because he's worthy amen and we just we love him amen where would we be without him amen he's so precious to us and so i just wanted to share that with you and i would have paul and ben they they went with me i would have them give testimonies here today but i know that it's kind of putting them on the spot but i know that they were really blessed in the meetings and the services among others and so i just want to say thank you for your prayers and no way i can only relate it and relay it that when thursday morning was over for me you know how they have a pressure valve on the pressure cooker that's how i felt something that's been months and months and months and months and you know just trying to find the mind and the leading of the lord and that's how it is with all of the the brothers in the ministry and we just i just thank god for everyone they did they just did such a tremendous job but the daniel andes brother andrew glover brother jonathan martin brother paul lafontaine just such a tremendous job brother john sanger brother josh martin brother junior woosley my goodness it's just so wonderful to see amen the the people of god and the bride of jesus christ and hearts being edified amen and encouraged even in the things of god so i would just want to say thank you you you may not see it but your prayers were effectual it had an effect and as you continued to pray in those services so i just want to say thank you this morning we want to lift the special offering here for the building project and so if the brothers would come at this time and i'd just like to pray as they prepare for that as they're coming for that and then just make our way right into the word of the lord and i just certainly covet your prayers this morning i'm just a little just a little tired and just ask that the lord will just help us here this morning in a very special way heavenly father as we just come to you once again what a what a joy it is lord to serve you what a great privilege that you've given to us lord father as we lord think upon lord your goodness lord it overwhelms us lord how many times has i heard brother brian refer to that lord in regards to the special that was sung it does us good lord when we can not only revisit where you've brought us from but lord as we can just stand upon that solid ground in our lives and our hearts to know that god that you you are the one that is working you're the one that has moved in our lives what a peace that gives us lord when there might be all sorts of things around us but there's a ground that we can stand on and there is a perfect peace knowing that lord you've got everything in control now father as we lift this offering this morning lord we thank you father even as we go forward lord in these lord with the things that are taking place out there the finishing of the project lord i pray that god you'll just bless your people lord god as they sacrifice lord each and every one lord father to make lord things look a little better just of appreciation for all that you've given to us lord we thank you for the building that you've given us lord to come and worship in father i don't know how many times that i talk to different brothers and different ones that lord that have oh god as friends and it's such a difficult thing lord they can't even lord at this point even finding a building things that lord can be difficult i pray that god that you'll open the door for them lord i know that you have something for them i remember when we prayed that way lord many times lord we would look and it just wasn't the right avenue i know how disappointing that can be and i'm asking god for those brethren this morning those churches lord those pastors those people that god you'll just intercede for them lord lord jesus it's just we want to say thank you lord for you have provided for us lord it's you that's put it in the hearts of your children oh god and father we just want to say we love you because lord god if your grace is removed from our lives we're nothing lord and father we just acknowledge that in everything and we pray that god you'll be with us in this service remaining part of it help me to step aside lord as a speaker god that i could get out of the way that you can just speak lip to ear to your children lord this morning lord may our lives lord be changed in your presence lord we love you and we thank you father in jesus name amen and amen amen god bless you amen hey that's mine buddy if you take that we're going to be in trouble sorry if he takes that we're in trouble today you love him i'm not talking about him i'm talking about the lord i love him don't you we love brother brian too amen would you stand with me and let's turn to first john chapter 2. amen it's just so good to see you and be with you and i just have heard just wonderful reports of the of the service here on thursday and i'm so i'm i'm blessed by hearing that amen that that you you've been edified so i just really look forward to getting getting in and just listening to that that message as well because i just uh to me i so appreciate brother nathan erickson and the gift that's there in his life and i just really really really appreciate the yielding to the lord verse 12 i'm just going to read a couple verses that we've been reading these the past two services but i want to just move here and try to bring something to a point this morning in verse verse 13 we'll start there i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning he's talking about knowing the word and the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and we realized that the word is not a letter but the word is the person of jesus christ because you have known him that is from the beginning and i write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one write unto your little children because ye have known the father and god add the blessing to the word that you're being seated i'd like to continue on that thought i write unto you fathers and as we are looking as paul or not paul but as john would write this by inspiration it's what an encouragement it is that god has set forth and there are hearts and lives that have have a good understanding and a good understanding is not so much that it's com all knowledge because we we know it takes something it's more than knowledge knowledge itself can never it never can and it never will change anybody but it takes an understanding and if i could say it in this way understanding what i'm speaking of is where the word itself because we have to have knowledge we have to have instruction the bible comes to and the word of god comes to instruct us in other words to set a clear expectation that we can move within that channel of the word that's open to us and then the understanding itself is where when that word begins to move down in our life and that word this is something i want you just to take is that the word itself the word is eternal so the word just doesn't come into our life and just like as moving my bible and it moves here and it just stops the word as it comes into our life it keeps moving in our lives the word that we receive it isn't just oh i've got that revelation and now i've got to get this revelation the word itself what it is he keeps unfolding himself and that word just keeps opening keeps it keeps working in our lives the bible said perfect love casteth out all fear and the love of god is the holy holy ghost that is the word of god as it comes into our life it dismantles every hold of fear uncertainty worry and doubt and i'm glad he's still doing that when the enemy would want to raise his head up and maybe stand in our conscience i'm talking in our spirit realm or something comes up in the reasoning i'm glad that there's a greater power on the inside that is able and it releases to us a virtue and a strength to dismantle the hold of the enemy if the scripture at which it does tell us to cast down you and cast down imagination and everything that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god i'm thankful there's a resource and a power that you and i are able to draw from and that person that that that resource is the very person of jesus christ himself that's what the word is the word is the person of jesus christ it is that same word that the bible says that that was that was god that that that is god that was in him and that same life it came to give light into men an understanding and and in this hour there's a lot of things that's called light the bible says this in this in this day in this time that we're living in it would be a time when light when it would be not clear not day nor night but god said i will bring a real understanding in the evening time that would be a light so it's not something that's vague and something that's gray and all covelled or covered over but i will bring something that's absolute something that is true something you are able to put your feet upon and stand upon solid ground and god has made a promise in every time knowing what would come in the advancements how satan would come and he says i will raise the standard when the enemy comes in like a flood i will raise a standard against the enemy and the standard is not god giving another word but it's god making his word more sure more real and how does he do that but by himself coming into his word and making that promise real so then we as the children of god have a clear direction and an expectation for our lives so we're not left wondering what comes next what comes next but god opens a clear direction that we can have faith and faith is that which looks beyond that of just the temporal it looks to what god says and says regardless how i feel regardless how i think regardless of what everything's going wrong this is what god has said this is god's desire and faith itself is like an anchor that's just cast into that place to say so being lord and then allow the word just to come as i said is the word moving in our life and what does it do it dismantles every hold of doubt or unbelief every bit around our life that's the power of the person of jesus christ the holy spirit working in our lives so this this gospel the word that god has given to us in this hour it has it calls for relationship and it's deeper relationship than what has been through the seven church ages because every one of the seven church ages had a portion or brother brown would say their dip in the holy ghost they each had that but we're living in the bride time or as the scripture says let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and that you we can't you we're not united with just a part of him we're not even united with the shadow we're not united with the type we're not we are united we're now the very person himself the holy ghost in its fullness has come down right among us in the promise of his word to unite a people together in a perfect relationship and it's it's it's rapturing grace for you and i it's a it's a relationship that through that relationship the lamb himself is revealed and as he's revealed through that revealing it also makes known this is the lamb's wife these two shall no longer be twain but they're one and so when we see this of of the father's this understanding notice how that the scriptures would speak through the life of the lord jesus when he was standing here as one that when god came came to redeem you and i god became one of us and he became one of us that he might redeem us and through that oneness also that he might be able to understand us to be a faithful and merciful high priest one that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities in other words there's nothing that you can experience that he has not already experienced and you have to understand experience itself doesn't even have to do with with with a committing but an experience itself is where he was tempted in all points such as we are yet without sin he experienced what it was when when when sadness would come he experienced depression he experienced this is scripture now the bible says he he suffered in the in the garden of gethsemane when you when you study that in that portion he studied depression as if we could take it on his scale he's he he came to experience of what it was at an apache moment he experienced that he said brother samuel what does that mean well it doesn't mean that he came that in order we could have a separate group and say this is where all the anxious people gather we'll probably all be there this is where the people because at one time or another we're anxious or we're depressed come on church let's be real now but he didn't come to make camps he came to deliver us out of that camp he came to us so we can say father i'm feeling this way i'm feeling like david said when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i open up that pathway lord open that up lord then and so we have a faithful and merciful high priest god became one of us and through that relationship notice through that relationship as he himself is on his way in the fulfillment of the word he speaks to the disciples and he lets them know there's a change in relationship i'm no longer going to call you servants because a servant doesn't know what his lord is doing but i'm going to call you friends so that that change in word from servant to friends it was declaring this is a moment of change this is a season of change this is a moment where there are things that can be begin to be made known to you in a greater measure then after the resurrection he comes and he declares there's now a change in relationship because the price has been paid the debt has been settled is that right he has he has ascended up now it's time for complete relationship but all of these parts servant friends now leads to this place call us brethren to think of it we were always his breth they were always his brethren is that right they were always his brethren but there is a relationship that is taking place to lead them into that place they wouldn't have understood brethren in in the time when it was the time of of servants they wouldn't have understood what brethren mean you see when words are spoken it lets you know the season and lets you know the promises that belongs to you and it's it's more than just a word it's an awakening of the spirit of god that awakens something within you he called me brethren what it is the word is awakening you to the promise and relationship of this hour yes sir that's why when the holy spirit could stop the prophet there in the seals and say i'm no longer going to call you church and listen how he says this i'm going to call you bride that you might understand it you see to recognize because this is not church thinking we are the bride yet to be called the church of the living god is what a great honor but it's declaring this is the season of the bride it's been the church all along but that there's an awareness and the spirit of god moves by that word i think we can all say clearly right here this morning there's a greater understanding that god has brought into our lives no matter how long we've been walking in the message of right now of what it means to be called the bride of jesus christ we see the effect of that word is that right and notice even how that relationship jesus didn't jesus was not just changing that relationship but there were things that were four seasons servant friend and brethren so the whole of what we were reading in the scripture here all of it speaks of relationship fathers well in order to be a father somebody you know they have to have then of of children to be a young man they're a product of a union children is a product of a union though all of these are in different positions in their walk or in their life but every one of them are right where they need to be and though think how god places this together god places it together to where that the fathers that he's wrote to in here they have understanding they've passed through certain things in their life they don't necessarily have the same stamina the same strength as the young men i'm not talking about the strength of the holy ghost i'm talking about strength in their natural body but they have but the young men have a strength but notice if you have all that strength that's there you've also got to have an understanding that goes with that and an understanding that also will display itself in humility to the lord and in humility to other things like when solomon came the mistake that solomon made and it divided the kingdom is he should have listened to the fathers but instead solomon listened to the young men the young men had a lot of zeal we're going to get things curved out here but what happened is that zeal it actually brought division so we want to have zeal but we want to have zeal according to the time according to the season according to what's called for at that moment and i can say this and i'll have both hands up god help me help every one of us to have the right zeal at the right moment at the right time we need that leadership and that's one of the parts of that a father a father begins to of the display is that a young man or a child that's coming on they can look and they can see a father one of understanding and saying my what a what a what a great man of faith what a what a great lady of faith and you know they can look and but remember ruth didn't become ruth overnight esther didn't become esther overnight rebecca didn't become rebecca overnight abraham didn't become abraham overnight but it wasn't working in their lives so i say it in this way you know i mentioned this there when i was with one of the with with the group there of the 19 year olds and up when the holy ghost has come and he sets down in your life he doesn't change you and i this is what i told them and i thank you we will all benefit from this he doesn't change you from 19 year old thinking to 50 year old thinking you see there's two parts of maturity there's a maturity in our natural life and a maturing in our spiritual life if we have the wrong expectation then we're under a confusion we're under oh things are not going as planned no no no remember brother brahma he would tell us so many things he said you can look around and things seem like this he said but everything's right on plan so there's a maturing that that that takes place by the spirit of god within our lives you know it none of those things this is why paul would have to write to timothy and speak to him and admonish him as a young man is fleeing youthful lust but following after those of faith and charity and all of those things he was giving him a direction in his life and he also said don't despise your youth in other words just to take a back seat but follow after there is examples timothy for you to follow follow after those examples and this is where for fathers and let me get back to the point that as fathers and or as young men and children i can remember and i still you know to this day i find myself it's kind of funny because i find myself in a minister's meeting and i'm looking around i'm i'm looking around i was in a i went to a ministers down to a minister's gathering we had had in kentucky some weeks ago and i went down there and i'm looking around i realized oh my lord i'm one of the oldest ones in the room here you know i'm wanting somebody older ones you know to fall back and you know taking this and standing up and you know and think i'm saying lord have mercy i'm only 46 years old you know but i'm looking around you know you're looking for somebody around you but you know sometimes the things that we look at and it is a mystery to us because the working of the holy spirit is never anything that you and i can explain if it is something we can explain then it's not the holy ghost because the bible says in these those eyes that are inward in our life that god brings faith into our hearts and those lies are anointed with the eyes have of the holy spirit that's what nick or jesus was telling nicodemus that then we understand the kingdom of god or see it it doesn't mean we understand as far as well i know everything there is to know about it that you don't know that from your birth when we're born again we don't know that oh i know everything no there's more that we see and we know as we go on and just bring it to this point you can look at someone that's been serving the lord for maybe a time and you're like wow man i i want to just move out and have faith like that that didn't come overnight it doesn't mean that we have to stand in the backseat but it means this right here what real faith is and those that life that you see that maturity real maturity is not something that's sticking its chest out but it's able to stand in humility and it's to be it's an example of a life that has come to such a place in their walk with god to realize he is here and i can do nothing on my own that's real maturity that's real understanding is i need him now that doesn't mean when we say we need him that it's just he's doing everything and i'm just you know it's like well lord you just do it and i'm over here doing this no if god's wanting to tend to this and i see this is a need then i'm going to be praying about how to care for this how to tend for it how to tend to it then he's coming down he gives me direction on how to attend to it so i must know what needs to be or alerted to the season that i'm living in bring in let the holy spirit bring it down to uh in our natural lives and our spiritual lives because right in the midst of a congregation as the words going forth god allows you and i to see just exactly in the season of our life of where you and i are at the bride is in a season as a whole a rapturing season are you with me but each and every one of us we are also in a season underneath that great season and that is all the working of the person of jesus christ and this this is where paul could write talking about this understanding and he would write in first corinthians 14 9 he says in the church i would rather speak five words with my understanding than that that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue so paul's recognizing much it doesn't take much to bring a great achievement all it takes is a yieldedness and a healiness and a humility to see there's a need that's present for this moment i would rather paul says speak five words paul's recognizing this isn't about me it's about the body and that's what the holy spirit brings out in our life that's the maturing of the spirit of god in our lives look at what it did in our natural life look at how the curbing out in our natural life even as we grow it should be this way even in our natural life if we are pulling away from from a selfishness and that's the same way it works in our life spiritually he's he's god comes in to give us sufficient grace to deliver us from our own selves not just once but paul said i die daily jesus said carry the cross daily brethren be not children in understanding how be it in malice be your children be and understand to be men so if there's anywhere we want to be in the high chair it's when it comes to malice we might look awful funny being big people in a high chair or maybe they can make them our size but we that's what we want to be we want to be children because you see malice cannot exist when you look among children you can have children that you know they disagree but you give them time they're out there playing and everything else i mean unless the parents foster division somebody with greater knowledge can foster these things and no we don't play with them we don't but but if children are left to themselves you'll find them and it's it's like what happened because there are children in that part there's things that they see that you and i can say oh when they grow up they won't be playing so much but you see there's a part of it that they see the value of i want to go play kickball i want to go play with this child and what right now i'm feeling or this scuffle we had or this words that ain't worth it i want to go play and that's what paul is bringing to you and i the oh god help us to be children and you say how can we be children well it's not a light switch but it's staying in the presence of our father and we recognize i am his child and he is my heavenly father you see these are things it's not just that all of a sudden well i have the holy spirit and light switches going on it's staying in the presence of almighty god remembering i am his child and he's my father we want to be men of understanding we want to be hearts and lives of understanding the bible says in first chronicles 12 32 that the children of issachar now this is when the tribes were coming to turn the kingdom to from saul unto david and remember they here they were as refuge uh refugees in that time they were outcasts but the bible says regarding the children of issachar which were men that had uh understanding of the times that's first chronicles 12 32 men that had understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do now when you read this and as a bible reader you'll know all the way through there you have different tribes that are mentioned of one's an expert to war one was was expert in bowls and you know and knives and all that right there and all of that's needed right it's all needed but god is pointing out this was very necessary because where all of these other parts were needed for battle for taking possession for defending what rightfully belonged to israel there also had to be men within the midst of all of that there had to be a character that would be able to handle that power and it would be men of understanding of the times in other words we've come to a spot that david we've been running we've now gathered at hebron and hebron is the place of the fathers we have been gathered here it's time to anoint david king and i'd say in this hour as fathers as husbands as every every child of god in here i think it's time that we can say god knew we would need understanding in this time daniel said understanding would be released when the seals were tore off the understanding would come he would come to hearts and lives to say we're living in a time it's time to anoint david king in other words it's time to receive this word that has come to us in power and glory and demonstration as the mighty conqueror and let it be king in other words every idea that i have let it be cast out and let the king reveal and his splendor and his glory in my life in my home in my marriage in all my relationships let the king of glory declare himself men understanding the times psalms 133 verse 1 david said behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity in unity a wonderful thing now you know how unity comes don't you everybody's got to think like i think is that right i mean we're going to be in unity everybody's got to order their steak medium medium rare baked potato and getting you hungry now ain't no i mean everybody's got to think like i think you know one of the most glorious revelations is when you realize god didn't call you to change nobody else god has everybody has their own temperament and your temperament is not a sin are you with me remember them guys sitting down at the end of the holiday brothers they were pop popping them squirrels off pop glory got another one brother brahms up the holler sportsman's holler and he puts his gun down against the tree and he starts crying he hears them having a good time down there why am i this way why am i this way you see he was wanting delivered from something that god fearfully and wonderfully made and put there what can i why why can't i why is it i got to be so tortured but i can't hit him in the eye i mean i've been happy to be just hitting you know and kill him you know but you see here's what the spirit of god said i made you that way for a purpose you see one of the greatest revelations that we can realize god doesn't want us in our temperament our disposition to change brother braham says if you things that are to be if you would have judged james by peter you'd have kicked peter out because peter was much different than james or andrew you you know what i'm where i'm going with this that it's the holy spirit brother brandon places it very clearly and why people are so tossed about he comes down in the center of your temperament to direct it i'm glad about that aren't you god knows what he's doing and when we look at that that even comes into our children and what we have here in the assembly god has never called me that you know i'll pick on brother joe here a little bit god never called me the man i've got to change brother joy's makeup or how he looks that god is not if i think that i'm going to waste my time i mean nothing bill joy you understand what i'm saying and so why am i going i'm fine listen to me i'm fighting against god because david received the revelation how marvelous are thy thoughts to me i am fearfully and wonderfully made now that applies not only within the assembly and it's a paradox how god sets us all together right some of us are punctual pete and some of us are right not sin it's not sin are you hearing me now i know sometimes we we like to put things in as as rankings and but it's not it's reality sometimes we have to understand the part of where we're made up but listen friends you say what are you saying that brother say well why he's saying it is so that it's not our idea that's exalted it's jesus christ who's exalted in our midst when the greek said they never came to them and said show us your idea tell us your idea they said sirs we would see jesus right when philip was there with him he said show us the father he said how long i've been with you he said show us the father it suffice it he said when you have seen me you have seen the father in other words he brought it from being something way out here so mysterious so distant he brought it down to a place is that god has been walking right here it's god that you've been fellowshipping with it's god that's been touching your life it's god that's been providing for you loaves and bread and every it's god that's been doing this it's god in simplicity working through human temples how pleasant it is for brethren to do all together in unity right it's all give and take i mean in order for us you know to dwell in unity everyone not just somebody everybody has to forsake their own opinions and ideas right in order to do that in order to have a unity because we could come into the service what if we allowed our opinions in coming into the service and then those opinions you would say well i'll tell you what if they would have done this and boy they should have only had the you know only had two specials right now today and it wasn't the two specials that threw the service out of whack it was your attitude because god will allow things to come our pathway to see are we fathers in this or not what are we going to do in the midst of this situation you see so sometimes the unity it's just like look at times when i go and minister places and you know i've been in meetings sometimes and now the song service can go an hour i know when it goes an hour and just trying to get out there and get a feel of the people i know whether or not how much within that service then maybe it's going to have to drop now sometimes in special meetings there's a lot more grace that's given there people are able to endure a little bit more i understand it's not about enduring but i think you get what i'm talking about what if we stopped in a place and you just said it ain't going you know what they sang that song right there and his drum beat was off and this and that oh lord have mercy man what a service that would be what an atmosphere right so sometimes we let little things that mean a lot to us hinder us satan gets in there and hinders us for the rest of the service you can't blame it on anybody else my goodness you can't this is where as fathers this is where we want to be people of understanding and i don't i think with understanding i'm not too big to ask god help me lord jesus when that one's in the philippines and they finally came and got man service that song sure has been well over an hour maybe hour and a half and for the row and then they're apologizing to us hey when in rome we do is wrong you know hey we just we just roll with it this is this is normal this is expectation so what did you do brother samuel i got out there and sung a song [Laughter] hey everybody so here to dwell together in unity verse two my it's like the precious ointment up on the head notice notice i want you to see this here it's like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments maybe to try to put a visual here if this was there's much there's a different consistency between water and syrup now you know i used to think syrup was that stuff that come in mrs butterworth's bottle my aunt mama i thought that was sir that was a fake now i don't mean to tear down no companies but you know i really i didn't know what maple syrup really was when you get maple syrup it's almost like water i thought no wonder i really never cared for mrs butterworth and all that stuff but i'm running at a point here the consistency how notice the precious ointment moving notice it wasn't just something that just david was able to capture how unity moves unity begins with the head unity begins with the head and unity flowing down into the body not fast you know sometimes we want to see fast change glory to god hallelujah oh fast change dope open it up microwave or we hate microblading way food but we try to microwave our children microwave husbands wives and everything we're going they're instant i mean we first got a microwave and dad got all into that oh man cakes in the microwave nastiest stuff in the world he about root me on scrambled eggs and making scrambled eggs in the microwave then things had butter on all you had to do was put them in your mouth and go like this and it was it wasn't natural you got to be in a skillet man but i'm making a point that the working of the holy spirit by unity is that which moves from the head down it moves down through every detail in your home in your life and you say brother samuel i need it to get down here just stand still and let the holy spirit do the work he knows where he's got to get to you don't have to guide him you don't have to take the holy spirit by the hand he knows exactly where to get to he knows every bedroom every heart of your children your wife your husband he knows how to get there he doesn't need my help well brother samuel glory to god what does that have to do with unity i'm getting somewhere here as the dew notice here's how it is it's as the due of hermit don't worry that coke going off don't mean it's going to be 50 more minutes as the dude notice this is how it is as the dew of hermann and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of zion how many of you ever heard the dewfall you heard the dew fall no you did that was bad that was probably a trick question i fought in them tried failing those trick questions many times so nobody heard the dewfall right you know god says that's a nice dude tonight boy that's a nice dude i mean eventually when you walk in the grass if you're up at a certain time or early in the morning you catch you're like wow this is a thick dew this morning in the fall wonderful in the fall when it frosts like that for a lot of reasons but that dew you don't hear it coming down it comes down in stillness and that's god's promise of the covenant to the children of abraham i will give you the dew of heaven because there are going to be dry times and it's not going to rain but my do shall descend it'll be the work of almighty god in the time of the silence and the dew will produce the dew will produce you you don't hear it where it's coming from you don't see it when it's coming but there's a confidence this is part of the covenant that if i can just be in that place of unity you say brother samuel i need to do but this is the qualifications be together in unity and when we're together in unity then the dew comes down and this is where the bible says and therefore the lord commanded the blessing even life forevermore sometimes we're trying to get things backwards we're praying we're asking god i need this god we need this god we need this god we need this and we're praying this isn't putting nobody down that's not i'm included here with this it's us understanding you the dew doesn't come when we're all tore up the do comes in the stillness of the night be still and know that i'm god it's when his presence come in and brother braham says that's that moment of refreshing back in the holiest of homes he says it's those times he said that we get so with our lives he said and we just have to get alone in prayer not that let me say this not that we don't pray but we don't make prayer tradition in other words clock in at three o'clock out at four come on our lives are so used to time frames but prayer itself is not confined just to the position of your body it's the prostrating of our heart to god you can pray how could a man pray without ceasing because you're in fellowship with god lord i love you lord jesus lord i'm going into work today i invite you lord would you go into work with me lord i don't know what i feel this is a great day i'm thankful for the sun it's a beautiful day maybe pick up brother brian's lines it's wonderful but lord i need you today would you just come and let's have fellowship today lord i want to draw closer why i'm here this job you've given me talents you've given me i want to draw closer to you lord that's inviting him it's inviting the dew of hermann that which falls upon mount zion mountains of zion and all of this here notice as it speaks in the scripture here on the mountains of zion if this is not speaking of mount zion which would be jerusalem it's speaking of the mountains that surround it see we are called to mount zion which mount zion is what it's that of the word the holy spirit in the lives of his people but outside when we when we leave we're outside of of church it's mountains of zion you're on a mountain of zion you're on a mountain of zion and what does it do you need that elevation this is where the dew comes down in a dry dry region yet the dew comes to give necessary moisture for life to come forth so unity unity is very very very critical even in all of our lives remember when brother branham walked into his home and everything was tore up brother branham never walked in there and started giving orders hey stop this hey stop that hey come on now come on get away from that get it it was an example that was shown to us right you took dominion and how do you first take dominion by first allowing the holy spirit to have dominion here and recognizing that you know what if i go on this on my own it's going to be a big mess right have a certain way we're going to feel about it but how god comes and gives us grace to direct that and notice the simple way that brother branham took that began to help washing dishes begin to talk to his wife an atmosphere came think of this brother brandon went in the living room with the children he came in there next to his wife and he put on the apron one of the first times that brother gerd wrote a wallet seen brother branham was wearing an apron washing dishes and it blew him away he went over this house i'm here thinking a prophet of god stepping out with the commandments of god here's a prophet of god stepping out with an apron god bless you brother gerst oh that ain't manly according to whose definition according to whose definition see we talk so much about what we're not of the world you realize the world itself permeates very slowly we got this thing listen you can be manly and wash dishes and sweep the carpet in other words to help out right it's all together to help out oh my i don't know where this is going but you understand notice what happened that atmosphere changed it was tight in that place right brother brahm didn't say here let me read you some quotes and let me read some scripture rebuke your one side rebuke you down the other tell you how you must be intact oh you shouldn't be that you're a daughter of god you shouldn't be yeah that would have done a lot of good a men of understanding and what happened a change of an atmosphere brother brown says the kids stopped arguing they started getting together and started playing man that make any parent have a praise break right there you know you need to be older you need to act order you need to grow we we have all of these directions and listen friends the holy spirit is not telling us this morning that all of a sudden here we we come out of these things oh i hear this and man now i'm going to be the perfect parent he's the perfect parent there's not one of us in here that are the perfect parent but thank god for his word that comes to remind us of the channels and direction in our life so we can yield to him and if anybody feels like they're the perfect parent you can come forward we'll cast that prideful devil and that lying spirit off of you now i want you just to ch just to catch this here just to uh just a moment here brother branham is talking about because sometimes we we are looking at things uh i hope the lord will just help me to bring this together as it just so just just just dealing with my heart you know we're looking sometimes at trying to make things or things transpire or things happen even in our homes and we can't even make things change in our own lives we can't do that now this is where brother branham makes this statement in the message show us the father i love this he says you don't try to go to a seminary and get this indoctrinated bombing embalming fluid put into you or some social creed because it's not life right think of the term relationship okay the thing you want is the baptism of the holy spirit the incarnate power of god dwelling in you that accepts this word notice that accepts this word and makes it live out as it really is that's what he does that's what the person of christ does coming to our lives it's him taking the word and bringing then the word coming to pass in our life all the way through you see this is where we stand as men of issachar children of god in this hour understanding he's king of my life he's the king of this throne of my thoughts he's the king he's above the thoughts that even i think of myself because if he is above that then what if i put him above it then what happens it flows down it's removing all of those things that even that you know can come into mind that could come into our mind we place him as the king in our life is that all right so then i love this brother brahm says you know he says that little orange tree takes the simplicity of showing us the father that little orange tree says when you plant it maybe when you get it it's a little sprig about so big anybody ever seen them little trees that give you like an arbor day what do you do give them away they're too small but they're you know you look and they're so small right and you look at some of them you're like uh how long does it take to grow uh by the time you're in you're like no i won't even see it i won't even live here but you don't understand it starts out like a little spring but let's get to the point it starts out a little spring it says you plan it see see how my my human way of looking at i want something to grow i i want to be able to see it i want to be able to enjoy it but you planning out something that starts real small okay that's all that you have to do to it is plan it you don't have to go out and say now i've got to get me some oranges somewhere and you go to dumping into it the oranges is already in it it's like this it's already in it the only thing that little tree has to do is you have to keep plenty of water on it right how many of you know when you plant something you better water it and you don't water it like when we had planted trees some years ago you don't water the guys came out and they say hey don't be watering this every day you water it to you water it every every third day and about five minutes but don't do no gusher on it why because the gusher just runs off put it put a put a drip on it it was a lady that really helped me a lot she said get a five-gallon bucket and drill a hole in it like that and put the bucket near the plant fill the fill the bucket up and that little it the water will go down real slow but it goes down to the roots training the roots go deep for water because if you just oh i watered the tree it runs off and what it does it trains the roots come up because water's only on the surface if you allow it's slowness what are the slowness as you're giving it water it's also teaching it go deep go deep go deeper go deeper go deeper maya we can preach on that one [Music] the only thing that little tree has to do you have to keep plenty of water on it then the only thing the tree has to do is drink and it drinks and it drinks it drinks over its amount as it drinks it pushes out limbs pushes out leaves drinks more pushes out blossom drinks more it pushes out oranges just drink push drink and push and that said that's all you have to do when we are planted together in christ the only thing we have to do is drink from his promise you see drinking from his promise is not only when i'm in the word listening to the word but you realize drinking from his promise watering it is also saying thank you lord thank you for your mercy lord thank you for your grace lord another week another day lord father you're the lord of my life it's it's staying in fellowship with him it's talking with him he's right there with us when when you have something going on invite him you say well sam i believe he's with me but just just be real purposeful with it lord jesus will you sit down right here right next to me oh brother samuel that's that's real simple i know it is but remember this is a relationship this is not a god who's far off it is not one who came down who came with an sd card and said here we're going to let you download the commandments and you give that back to me because i'm going to take somebody else and download it there but he came down and he said i am the word i've come right here to be a display and also to affect your life i tell you i'd rather i'd rather have him sitting right by me i'd rather invite him and say lord you lead me today you direct me today every time when i take the pulpit even when i'm studying when i'm studying and the inspiration i can the sense that inspiration is moving right in at that moment and i said lord now you direct me lord for your children you guide me lord you know you know the needs that are going to be present guide me lord i all i want to do is get into that channel of inspiration and follow that so as we were planted in christ the only thing we have to do is drink from his promise and push out i love that the only thing we have to do is drink and push out that's it everything that you have need of is in you when you receive christ because christ is in you and you just have to drink from his word his life and push out that's all we have to do and what does that do that's showing the father for his life it's his life that's coming forth leaves the growth of the tree oranges that are coming from in from forth in our lives hallelujah in the message here let me in the scriptures let me read galatians chapter 2 and then i'm just going to come down from here because there's no way i can keep on going with this to make it make the point in galatians 2 20 paul would write i am crucified with christ now i want you to catch this here paul never says i was i am ongoing not i was i am ongoing i'm crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me what a glorious revelation when when we're living not by our strength we are living by the strength and reality of the relationship of the lord jesus christ that he gave himself for me he did it for you brother joy bill he did it for you and i'm living now see it's one one thing to say he did it but then has you be as you accept that and you don't accept it by works that's not accepting it you're trying to earn it how do you accept it you accept what he did for you he's the one that has come to our life dealt with our heart his love has spoken to our life so what is it that is taking place it's himself he's revealing himself to you and i the work of calvary and what is the work of calvary it's to bring relationship i'm not living paul said by my faith i'm living by the faith of the son of god i'm living by that faith of the one who loved me and gave himself for me you understand that relationship that reality when we understand that and oh god help us to so live within that that it's it's his working in our life brethren how pleasant it is to dwell together in unity resting in him who's begun to work he's performing it until the day of jesus christ in our homes in our families it's resting in this reality that i'm not living i'm not living by my works there's things that god calls us to do like i said we see the time we need to be moving in this and we're asking god to give us direction in seeing the need but we realize it's not me or you acting apart from god relationship has come to where we can say as jesus said that whatsoever the son seeth the father doing that doeth the son likewise there's a relationship we're not acting on our own we're acting under his influence his direction his love and his care in our lives i do not verse 21 i do not frustrate the grace of god in other words bring confusion to it for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain paul putting it very clearly to the body of believers here that this life because remember there were those who had come in back into the galatian church trying to turn the people back to self-efforts self-reformation instead of resting on the person of jesus christ paul's letting him know why are you going back to something that takes that's taking away from relationship relationship is here the lord he made a way for complete relationship and see these are the things as it comes down as it moves down even into our homes and into our lives we recognize that the greatest thing is that that god brings forth relationship in our life now let me just drop these little statements for you and i'm not going to preach on them today release relationship without boundaries and standards is confusion are you hearing me grace has come to us but it isn't grace you just do whatever you want god loves you you know what that brings right grace god spoke to titus and what how did i love how the spirit of god brings it through titus the grace of god come teaching us corrects us gracious and say ah you're a good boy you're good girl everything's good man praise the lord you you know better they come of your genes they come of my genes you know what's in our genes and i'm not talking about levi's either i'm talking about the genes of of our makeup right and that's why you can look at certain things your life you say they need the holy ghost they're gonna need they're really gonna need that relationship with jesus christ come on be honest now you're good there there's the need but you recognize that that of the relationship itself and yet if there's rules without relationship that leads to rebellion there's an age to become their buddy are you hearing me now always you have a relationship but you don't you're not buddies when you're five years old right are you hearing me well that's for another service but it's relationship god does not god give us boundaries oh how precious are those boundaries aren't you i'm glad when he corrects me i'm glad i'm glad that he says hey wait a minute the tide's only going this far the moon you know caused the boundaries you know we're not just we're not like little kids running around over the doctor's office of we're in this person's face and we're in this person's face you've probably seen that i've seen that hey there's personal space you know that you don't run around and get in everybody's face well that's something that parents teach should teach they didn't cute getting in everybody's face now i know sometimes you go oh brother sam there's a big old stick in the mud no no i'm not sticking the mud but you need to teach boundaries man oh man let's close let's pray heavenly father lord as the lord we stood here i stood here even this morning asking god for your grace and mercy to lead us i am i'm never disappointed lord that we maybe don't get to a certain place because i want to follow you it's it's you ministering to our needs and i include myself lord father i pray here this morning lord you know the needs of of every one of your children you know everyone that's gathered here lord and father how your word it falls into our heart and ministers to what we have need lord dear god may you lord help us lord i pray god living by a relationship with jesus christ lord to see your approach even in our life you're not approaching us as a law giver you're approaching us and lord in in that of relationship where your presence your life if lord we will entertain you then almighty god it's through you the word that change comes into our life if there's struggles in a life if there's things that where lives are tempted certain things in certain ways lord may they recognize and invite you lord and just know that god as the person of jesus christ there's a real there's a relationship your desire is to help them to free them from law and lord that there's a grace on the inside as they would submit to you and allow the word to perform in their lives there's got to be a unity lord it's got to be identifying with the words got to be a letting down of ourselves lord how precious it is for brethren to dwell together in unity laying down our ideas and just say lord i invite you lord jesus let that let that precious ointment let it flow lord let it flow through every channel and every fiber of my being lord oh god just like the dew of herman let it be lord through the congregation here this morning that for every heart for every father mother husband wife every believer every young person lord may that be o god the real heart's request is lord jesus just flow through me lord flow through me lord as your prophet put it so simply and so clearly that lord as we are partakers of the word as we allow the word to flow through us we become the word we want you to flow through us lord if you find any if there be any channel that stopped up lord we want we want that channel cleared we ask that god you would forgive us and lord just the cleansing flow and the power of the love of god that dismantles every doubt every unbelief and every hold it brings healing oh god not only to our soul but our spirit and our body oh granted lord as father as lord young men as children help us lord i pray that god that we might move in this understanding o god and seeing what the power of real true relationship is lord allow the word just to have its work and its free course in our lives help each and every one of us oh god i pray help every parent lord and lord every husband every wife every mother help us lord as a church body lord dear god these are so important lord to our lives lord and god we just want to give ourselves to you when we come away from a service like this or any service what you gave us right here at the end lord like that little orange tree that's what you've called us to do is to get plenty of water is to drink drink and push out and just keep taking lord in of that word things that we are desiring to see changed things that lord in our lives things around us lord may we be lord partakers and just keep partaking of you lord just lord just giving ourselves to you we love you and we thank you father in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen that's what we want to do we want to push out leaves but i can't push him out you can't push him out but we're taking in of that word and how do we take in the word you know taking in the word it doesn't mean altogether that i'm sitting down and reading my bible i believe in doing that i believe in listening to the message i believe in getting into that i believe in praying i believe in having a time we set aside from with prayer but listen relationship it's like if i if i can find relationship with my wife to when we're only at the dinner table that's not relationship she's she's with me he goes in the living room or of an evening go set and drink coffee it's a part of my life we're part of one another's life it's not just something that it's an appointment at dinner and that's why that even reading a bible listening to the message praying it's not an appointment relationship goes throughout the day you can invite him right there right beside you the whole day you it's a love affair with him lord i love you how many times during the day do you just say that lord i love you i mean think about where he's brought you from you you might look in your life and say well brother samuel i'm not where i need to be hey he's done so much for you right now why not love him for even bringing you to that place of where you are now because you know where you are now it's because his love has come to you and there was a there was a capturing of that in your life and what did it start doing it started working in your life so what do you do you continue to entertain him like abraham said don't go nowhere hey go get a calf hey make some make some good cornbread you know the the buttermilk kind go get some of this and get some good beans and and get the good scallions and get he's entertaining him but the brown said when jesus comes in a meeting he wants to be entertained we want to entertain him hallelujah right and we entertain him just daily just thank you lord you know maybe you used to as married you used to write down maybe when you're first dating recording you'd reach over and grab your hand man that was a good thing to hold her hand and now it's like well we we're getting somewhere now but you realize with the lord jesus you can reach over him he wants to hold your hand and you know in jesus car he don't have them consoles down the middle he still has the nice bench seat where you can slide right over next to him i love that don't you amen i'm glad about that but friends it's that simple the person of jesus christ is not an idea it's god himself that's come down right here among us and in your life he changes our lives to where a life can look in their life and say my goodness how did i get how did i get here see it's so amazing it's a how did i get here it's because his love and you just continue to take in his love and surrendering it back to him when i tell you his love it's overwhelming his love dismantles fear doubt complexes just keep loving him keep entertaining him and he loosens the hold of everything great is our god amen let's stand lead us in song amen hallelujah amen hallelujah is nothing like the presence nothing like the presence nothing like the presence of the lord there is nothing like the presence nothing like the presence nothing like the presence of the lord there [Music] it flows down [Music] [Applause] i'm gonna worship as it's flowing healing [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] forever in his presence [Music] yes there is joy [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh there's joy in the presence of the lord there's freedom there is freedom in the press hallelujah there is freedom in [Music] there is freedom in the presence freedom in the [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] thank you lord i'm not the same i'm changed for forever is [Music] foreign [Music] one more time [Music] in his presence [Music] in his presence [Music] thank you lost forever in his presence oh it's jesus on the inside working for the outside making [Music] making a difference [Music] in my life [Music] [Music] oh yes it's jesus on the inside working for the outside making a difference in my life [Music] in my life [Music] [Music] [Music] and i begin to cry and my mind just fails to know exactly why oh i love this for i can explain with tongue or pin the spirits [Music] oh hallelujah could you just raise your hand and say thank you lord i hear i'm glad lord i'm so thankful lord to hear your voice [Music] a deeper relationship deeper relationship deeper relationship thank you lord speaks too i'm glad you speak to me

speaks to me and i agree [Music] lord please come and take control [Music] thank you lord jesus thank you lord for your mercy lord thank you lord god for this this wonderful relationship oh god thank you lord oh jesus how we love you lord how great you are lord hallelujah i think of that that scripture in the song of solomon where the bible says love is as strong as death it might seem like that those don't belong in the same scripture but you think about it you go back and look at a picture maybe a year ago two years ago three years ago four years ago and you look and you say wow where did those wrinkles come where did that hair go or where did this change you know what it is once we reach a certain spot death starts setting in is that right it just keeps setting in but think about that as the love of god setting in on our life like a picture that we took and here we were in preschool kindergarten first grade you know some of those pictures you take in first grade and you smile and you're missing a tooth and then by the time you get to fourth grade you look and you say wow i can see that's that person back there and you see that and then here seventh grade eighth grade it's what is it it's a life that's maturing and growing and it seems like all of a sudden like i look at young our young people i look at our boys and look i look at them i think goodness what happened here it's like brother nathan erickson who stood here the other night in ministry i remember when brother nathan said on the front row and i went to brother race his feet didn't even touch the ground i remember that i think goodness what happened now i'm looking up to him what happened in many ways look up to him it it's see it's it happened it was growing it was changing that's what the relationship with the lord jesus christ brings about in your life you welcome him he brings change you welcome him and invite him in it's inviting and you watch how things change just like those pictures in that yearbook there's a change taking place in your life who's doing that not a creed not an idea it's the person of jesus christ when we rejoice and say the marriage of the lamb has come and we understand what that means it's christ here in his fullness and a bride is coming into full view it's to understand that here is the very person of jesus christ not just a baptism of the spirit but the person himself coming and he brings transformation in our life probably for every husband and wife that's in here i can truly say this right now i love my wife and i appreciate her more now than when i even started coordinating when we got married it means more to me now i don't know what i'd do without her our fellowship as i told the young people the other day i said before i was ever called to the ministry i said i've got a lot of good ministering friends good brothers i said my favorite person to fellowship with around the world is my wife no one i'd rather talk to i know some might not have that opportunity but there's no one else it's your best friend and i believe if you don't have i believe god can move on that and bring that about okay understand that don't look at it and take like a condemning look in and say god this is what you're able to do we want that relationship why because in everything that we do when dwelling together in unity what does it do it allows the spirit of god just to flow now you haven't realized how it was look how brother brown stood on the platform that time and that maniac came up there everybody else was fearful right they were all tore up and things were going every which way there wasn't any unity taking place right there but brother branham he yielded his thoughts to the lord you remember that brother bram says i will begin to size him up he was a boxer he said i started to size him up none of the same brother ram got opposed the brand said thoughts of fear came into his mind you see then he says i chose to say wait a minute if i'm going to die right here i'm going to die with courage it brought the atmosphere of the holy spirit so unity with the lord it invites his presence it invites the dew of hermann it's one thing for us to feel every one of us here and i don't mean i'm i'm just going to close up on this every one of us there's things that we look at things sometimes and we've experienced change in our life like that we've experienced situations of healing right there's things that's happened and it's not saying that we don't expect god to move he still moves that way but sometimes in situations of unity here where it comes down then it's got to be the dew of heaven i think where we're at the prophet went off the scene in 1965 here we are in 2022. [Music] what is that 87 years or no no 45 35 35 22 so about 50 some 60 years okay what's been happening he was like oh my this is this time this time what's been happening the dew has been moving down the dew has been moving down and that's what happens in our lives individually it doesn't all of a sudden it doesn't run like water but it's like thick honey and it runs down slow you know honey will have that when it's dropping off they don't have that it's just like you see it gets stringy the drop gets bigger that's how the holy spirit moves to our lives water him praising that's how he moves through your family it's the dew of heaven relationship allow him to move say oh lord just continue to flow lord just continue to have your way hallelujah let's bow our hearts father thank you this morning lord once again thank you lord brothers and sisters thank you for your mercy coming lord and speaking to our hearts helping us to step out of the way and just the lord come to speak to us in a personal way the lord would we even as we would depart from the presence of one another lord we want to entertain you or maybe the simplest thing that lord and i trust it's been that simple to walk out of this message here this morning to realize your desire is to have a relationship with each and every one sometimes lord even in the midst of a relationship we can get too busy god made the simplicity just just stay in that place lord of realizing just inviting you just acknowledging you just worshiping you lord giving ourselves to you inviting you lord just lord just continue to change me lord continue to mold me and shape me let me lord be found in the season that we are in oh god let let every part of my life be so formed according to your word lord granted lord jesus may that honey of the love of god just so flow lord down through our lives lord granted lord we love you and we thank you lord this morning i should just go with your people lord bless them this week watch over and give them strength and what i pray in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen god bless you and let you be dismissed in the name of the lord the splendor of a king clothed in majesty [Music] let all the earth rejoice all [Music] tries to hide and trembles at his force trembles at his voice how great is our god sing with me how grace is our god all see how great how great is [Music] and time is in his hands beginning [Music] has been sound and the seals have been revealed his bride has heard his voice the bride assert his voice how great is our god sing with me how great is our god all will see how great how great is our god the nations know you are king you're the maker of [Music] we call and you are near your presence conquers all our fear we make our boast in you [Music] how great is our god sing with me how great is our god oh we'll see how great how great our god and he's the name above all names he is worthy of all praise [Music] and my heart will see how great is our god and he's the name above all names [Music] and my heart will see [Music] how great is our god how grace is our god sing with me how great is our god oh see how great how great is our god because he's the name above all names he is worthy of all praise [Music] the more i seek you [Music] the more i find you the more i find you the more i love you [Music] the more i see you [Music] the more i find you the more i find you [Music] the more i [Music] lord your love is so deep more [Music] more i see the more i find you the more i find you the more i love you i wanna sit at your feet drink from the cup in your hand lay back against you and breathe [Music] this love is so deep it's more than i can stand [Music] drink from the cup [Music] this love is so deep but it's more than i can stand i'm melting your peace it's overwhelming he's gone in all in control he's got it all in control he's got it all in control [Music] i put my life in his hands [Music] father knows what i need [Music] every trial i go through he knows what's best for me thank you my father knows what it means
