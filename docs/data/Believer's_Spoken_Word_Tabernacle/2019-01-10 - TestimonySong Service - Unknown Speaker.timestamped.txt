[9:43] to be gathered here tonight be together
[9:47] and you just want to just take a little
[9:52] a little look here at the Word of God
[9:54] tonight and you know here we are we're
[9:57] already more than a few days into into
[10:02] this year and but yet we want to be able
[10:05] to by God's grace ask God that would
[10:08] give us the grace on the departure from
[10:10] the previous years amen and give us
[10:12] grace into this next year find so many
[10:15] times when you take just the phrases
[10:18] through the message and I don't know if
[10:20] you've ever done it or not but if you
[10:21] take the phrases coming year or this
[10:24] year and just look at the things that
[10:26] brother Baron himself would set within
[10:29] it it wasn't something that was just
[10:31] loose in any way but it was a real
[10:35] burden that would be what God would take
[10:38] us on further in every oncoming year and
[10:42] I believe that you know that's what
[10:44] we're that's our desire to here tonight
[10:46] and I thank God for the opportunity that
[10:48] we're able to have to to come together
[10:51] like this I know some of you have been
[10:52] speaking about this for a while to come
[10:54] together and have some singing and have
[10:57] testimonies and yet here we are in the
[10:59] midst of a time we have so many that are
[11:01] dealing with sickness and you know so
[11:04] some are not able to be here tonight for
[11:07] that but we want to remember them in
[11:09] prayer and we also will take those
[11:13] requests up in just a moment and just
[11:15] ask that God would be with them as well
[11:17] if you would right now I want and let's
[11:20] turn in our Bibles here and I will stand
[11:23] with me I want to read out of
[11:27] Philippians chapter 3 there just for a
[11:31] few moments and I'm not going to I know
[11:35] you're probably thinking what we'll see
[11:36] but I'm not going to speak that long
[11:39] just if just really a few reflections
[11:42] that's on my heart in Philippians
[11:45] chapter 3
[11:50] and Paul here in the opening verse verse
[11:55] 1 he says finally my brethren rejoice in
[12:01] the Lord to write the same things to you
[12:04] to me indeed is not Grievous but for you
[12:06] but for you it is safe beware of dogs
[12:09] beware of evil workers beware of the
[12:12] concision for we are the circumcision
[12:14] which worship God in the spirit and
[12:17] rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no
[12:19] confidence in the flesh though I might
[12:22] also have confidence in the flesh If any
[12:25] man if any other man thinketh that he
[12:28] might or of he might trust in the flesh
[12:30] I'm more circumcised the eighth day of
[12:33] the stock of Israel of the tribe of
[12:35] Benjamin an Hebrew of the Hebrews as
[12:39] touching the law a Pharisee concerning
[12:42] zeal persecuting the church touching the
[12:44] righteousness which is in the law
[12:46] blameless and verse 7 we'll just will
[12:49] read this and pause here but what things
[12:52] were gain to me those I counted loss for
[12:57] Christ what things were gain to me those
[13:02] I counted loss for Christ amen let's
[13:06] just pause there and just ask the Lord's
[13:08] blessing Lord Jesus as Lord we bow our
[13:13] hearts Lord in your presence dear
[13:17] Heavenly Father we're just asking Lord
[13:20] here
[13:21] your God your blessing upon the service
[13:24] we're asking for your guidance Lord as
[13:27] we would just Lord share a few things
[13:31] Lord that you've placed upon our hearts
[13:33] and we certainly would just desire O God
[13:36] that you have just complete preeminence
[13:39] Lord Father may in the further part of
[13:42] the service Lord I pray that your God as
[13:45] we Lord take this time Lord to set aside
[13:48] and to Lord just - Lord speak God the
[13:52] testimonies we've we've given
[13:54] testimonies here in Lord the services
[13:56] Lord but just feeling pressed just -
[13:58] Lord call this and just to have these
[14:01] times these moments Lord and we pray
[14:03] that God may it be an edification
[14:05] because that's that's the objective Lord
[14:07] in everything that we do that it would
[14:10] edify the body of Jesus Christ so father
[14:13] we pray that you'll just bless the
[14:14] specials tonight as well Lord may it be
[14:17] an encouragement Lord through our lives
[14:19] we pray Lord we love you and thank you
[14:21] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[14:25] god bless you as you're being seated I
[14:32] want to just just draw your attention
[14:35] here just a few moments here into that
[14:37] verse of scripture this verse of
[14:40] scripture here is one that I could not
[14:43] get away from it's something that it
[14:46] just continued to resonate within my
[14:49] heart where Paul makes this declaration
[14:51] what things were gain to me those I
[14:54] counted loss for Christ there's no doubt
[14:58] about it that there are things that when
[15:00] we are looking at it in our life we know
[15:03] that when we have been born again and
[15:07] born of the Spirit of God
[15:09] we have been lifted from just where we
[15:13] were looking and living on a plane in
[15:15] this world but now we're walking and
[15:17] we're walking in two worlds we when
[15:20] we've been born again we now are aware
[15:23] of that other world that brother brems
[15:25] says we were bumping into all of those
[15:27] years and we we come to a place that we
[15:30] recognize ourselves as a song we sang as
[15:33] Pilgrims and strangers and that's when
[15:36] we can truly say we're a pilgrim and
[15:38] we're stranger when we realize that
[15:40] we're just passing through this life and
[15:42] yet they within the midst of this life
[15:45] it's always a challenge it's always a
[15:47] battle for us to keep the two parts of
[15:50] us always in check and to keep it
[15:52] separated because Paul is letting it be
[15:55] known here what things were gain to me
[15:57] those I counted loss for Christ but yet
[16:00] there was a part of Paul that desired
[16:03] more of God in his life and Paul is here
[16:07] when he's placing this before us is that
[16:10] there is an evaluation that Paul was
[16:12] making that for everything within his
[16:15] if it is just profiting Paul the natural
[16:18] man and that's all that where it's at
[16:20] Paul said that if if that if that's it
[16:23] right there and it hinders the spiritual
[16:25] then that in itself is not profitable to
[16:28] me but in everything that we do we I
[16:31] believe as believers that we desire that
[16:35] with every step Lord I want to be in the
[16:39] center of your will we we don't want our
[16:42] lives to be entangled and you know in
[16:45] held in bondage with things and I
[16:47] believe this with all of my heart when
[16:49] we're praying for God's will in our life
[16:52] God is not going to lead us into
[16:54] something that would take us from him
[16:57] he'll never do that we have that we have
[17:00] that assurance but if anything God will
[17:03] always open up the door his will is
[17:06] something that will see to it when our
[17:08] desire is to be closer to him it will be
[17:11] unhindered there's gonna be challenges
[17:14] sure there will be challenges when God
[17:16] opens a door and he makes known his will
[17:18] it's not without challenges but when he
[17:21] makes known his will it is that which
[17:23] gives us strength and confidence when
[17:26] adversity strikes that we know that
[17:28] we're in the perfect will of God
[17:30] and we can look to God to bring answers
[17:32] to give direction of where we're
[17:34] standing in that time so when Paul I
[17:37] believe this to be a real mark for our
[17:39] lives as we look into this year what
[17:42] things were gain to me those I counted
[17:44] loss for Christ and you think Paul goes
[17:47] on to say it like this he says ëi
[17:49] doubtless I count all things but loss
[17:52] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[17:54] Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[17:57] suffered the loss of all things and do
[18:01] count them but dung that I may win
[18:03] Christ there's no regrets here think of
[18:06] what Paul what Paul was removed from in
[18:09] his life because of now what God had
[18:12] done in Paul's life Paul is able to say
[18:15] and those things which I have suffered
[18:17] the loss of I count them but dung in
[18:20] other words Paul is making a declaration
[18:21] he says I'm not like that of Lot's wife
[18:24] where I look back and say oh I
[18:26] oh this could have been all that could
[18:28] have been there's no value within those
[18:31] things Paul realizes and is declaring my
[18:34] heart is no longer their accountant but
[18:38] dumb he's recognizing see he's moving on
[18:41] and you recognized this that here he
[18:44] goes on to say in verse nine this is the
[18:46] desire coming out of verse eight that I
[18:48] may win Christ in to verse nine and be
[18:51] found in him not having mine own
[18:54] righteousness which is of the law but
[18:57] that which is through the faith of
[18:58] Christ the righteousness which is of God
[19:01] by faith that I may know him in the
[19:04] power of his resurrection in the
[19:06] Fellowship of his sufferings being made
[19:08] conformable unto his death if by any
[19:11] means I might attain unto the
[19:13] resurrection of the Dead
[19:15] and watch out Paul goes here his desire
[19:17] notice what Paul's focus is is the
[19:20] promise of the first resurrection then I
[19:23] might attain unto that resurrection out
[19:25] of that that I ain't aend to that first
[19:28] resurrection that's the goal that's the
[19:31] desire I believe that's our desire is
[19:35] that is our focus within everything not
[19:39] look I says is in verse twelve not as
[19:42] though I had already attained either
[19:46] were already perfect but I follow after
[19:51] if that I may apprehend that for which
[19:53] also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus I
[19:57] look at this very clearly this verse of
[20:00] scripture has always been a verse of
[20:02] scripture over the years that's always
[20:03] stood out to me that Paul could stand
[20:06] here there is the church age messenger
[20:09] having the revelation that he has but
[20:11] Paul could say I do not count myself
[20:15] that I've already attained in other
[20:17] words I'm already there I've already
[20:21] come to the pinnacle I'm already at the
[20:23] summit Paul is very very very clearly
[20:27] stating here and I'm still moving on I'm
[20:30] following after I'm in pursuit of what
[20:33] God has made known you see if God hadn't
[20:36] made it known to Paul think of it God
[20:39] works in
[20:40] that channel to make it known to the age
[20:42] and then how God would disperse it out
[20:45] through that age and that is always kept
[20:47] before the people the focus of the hour
[20:50] and what God is calling us to down
[20:53] through the ages every age has been
[20:56] focused on the coming of the Lord that
[20:58] has been the expectation that has been
[21:01] the hope of the gospel of every one that
[21:04] has lived in every age and yet as they
[21:07] lived within their age lived within
[21:10] their time think of this here it's
[21:12] constant where the vision was always
[21:14] placed before them we are we are made as
[21:18] a people that we are a people of vision
[21:20] and I'm not just talking on a spiritual
[21:22] level I'm talking also on a natural
[21:25] level of things there are things that
[21:27] you know that we we are meant to have a
[21:30] focus and have a goal and have a
[21:32] direction within life think of this
[21:35] and the message faith is our victory
[21:37] brother Branham talks about the bum
[21:40] who's at his door you remember the story
[21:43] the bum was at his door he said I
[21:45] invited the man in and I invited him to
[21:47] sit down at the table he said and then I
[21:49] thought I would ask him a few questions
[21:51] and brother Brian begin to feed him
[21:53] brother Brendan washed his feet and
[21:54] brother brown asked him he says where
[21:57] are you going hmm
[21:59] he said well where you come from mmm but
[22:05] the brem says what's your ambitions what
[22:09] do you plan to do the REM goes into that
[22:13] fate now watch this he this is us this
[22:15] is relative to the subject he's speaking
[22:18] on faith is our victory faith itself is
[22:23] the sovereign will of God revealed to
[22:28] you and I yet without details I don't
[22:36] want to labor on that tonight but God's
[22:38] will that is what we want when we walk
[22:41] by faith it's we're walking by divine
[22:44] revelation and we don't know how or when
[22:49] and how all the other parts will unfold
[22:52] but what we know
[22:53] his faith is we're walking steadfast in
[22:56] what God has shown us for that moment
[22:59] when we get to the place we need to get
[23:02] to he'll open more to us he doesn't open
[23:06] Luqman by God told Abraham he told him
[23:10] to get to the mountains he never told
[23:11] him what mountain yet it was till it
[23:14] wasn't until Abraham got to a place in
[23:16] the scriptures then everything begins to
[23:18] single down begins to narrow it's
[23:21] walking and obedience to what God has
[23:24] opened right then that's faith even with
[23:27] Abel Abel didn't know that the Spirit of
[23:30] God was going to come down and give
[23:31] witness on that sacrifice but what he
[23:34] knew is this is what God has revealed as
[23:37] the acceptable way and so he took that
[23:41] and he walked by faith and that God came
[23:43] and God recognized and honored that this
[23:47] was indeed from me so when we think of
[23:51] these things here I look back on that
[23:53] bum you know that that was there but so
[23:55] brother Brown described it he had no
[23:58] purpose
[23:59] he had no direction and brother Branham
[24:02] spoke of that he says what a sad thing
[24:05] it is he said for a church member
[24:07] someone who's just aimlessly floating
[24:10] down the river of life he said you take
[24:13] for example he said these the wood
[24:15] that's going down the stream he said yet
[24:18] if you take that wood and it's shaped
[24:21] and molded put together and you put an
[24:23] engine behind it
[24:24] he said then he said he can go somewhere
[24:26] it now has a purpose and I believeth on
[24:29] my heart and we recognized I'll say it
[24:31] like this I believe that I'm speaking to
[24:34] and I'm one of believers that have
[24:36] matured into a place that we recognize
[24:39] the predestinated plan of God is not
[24:42] like a bunch of marbles thrown in the
[24:45] air that just happens to roll around but
[24:47] we recognize that our lives are divinely
[24:51] influenced by the Lord Jesus Christ even
[24:54] when you don't feel anointed you're
[24:58] still anointed the anointing the Prophet
[25:02] separated he said anointing is not a
[25:04] feeling he said it is
[25:07] in power in control right there so
[25:11] you're walking and sometimes we don't
[25:14] recognize of all how God is leading us
[25:17] and how we're being moved within our
[25:20] life that it is not and we do not treat
[25:23] God's program as though it's just
[25:25] something that's just well if it's going
[25:27] to be it's going to be we recognize God
[25:30] doesn't do that he never haphazardly
[25:33] treated our salvation in that way and
[25:35] said well we'll just see it was all
[25:38] God's plan his program being unfolded
[25:41] and all through the time even the types
[25:45] that were being laid in the Old
[25:47] Testament they were all moved upon by
[25:50] the Holy Ghost and as they moved by the
[25:53] Holy Spirit that each part would be
[25:56] laying there that would actually speak
[25:58] in part of Christ they were moving in
[26:01] the will of God for their season you
[26:04] know it was something it took ahold of
[26:06] their life like it did Abraham's life
[26:07] Jeremiah's life and on and on to where
[26:10] that Christ revealed to them in them and
[26:15] through them in that generation it took
[26:17] precedence over everything else it was
[26:22] what they made their decisions in life
[26:24] by everything hinged upon that and I
[26:29] believe that this is where Paul is
[26:31] speaking to us with in this he goes on
[26:34] to say in verse 13 brethren I count not
[26:39] myself to have apprehended those are
[26:43] tremendous words aren't they in other
[26:45] words I'm not already there I'm pressing
[26:48] C there's a goal that is out ahead of me
[26:51] there's something there's a reality that
[26:53] is before me I want to see this word me
[26:57] and this word become one not just what
[27:00] brother Sam I believe that's already
[27:01] happened Paul did too but Paul is still
[27:04] saying he said I'm not there yet I want
[27:07] to fully become how Christ as fully made
[27:11] himself known that's what Paul is saying
[27:14] so Paul's recognizing there's a goal
[27:16] there's a focus and that's why I think
[27:18] the scripture is so clear you
[27:20] what the Bible says then what is it
[27:22] proverbs 29 13 where there is no vision
[27:25] the people perish and you recognize that
[27:30] word vision where there is no vision
[27:34] that word means a lack of leadership is
[27:38] nakedness it's the same word that's used
[27:42] in Genesis and they knew they were naked
[27:45] so to be naked is to lack leadership
[27:49] leadership is to be clothed is to have a
[27:52] vision have a direction for our life and
[27:57] this is why that where the scriptures
[28:01] even as it would portray we won't go and
[28:04] spend that time tonight but it even
[28:05] portrays and shows itself within our
[28:08] life but I believe that these two next
[28:10] parts here what Paul says in verse 13
[28:13] are very very applicable to our lives
[28:16] and they must be applied I count not
[28:19] myself to apprehend it but this one
[28:21] thing I do forgetting those things which
[28:26] are behind how can you forget what's
[28:33] behind unless you have access access to
[28:39] power that's able to minister grace to
[28:43] you to you recognize it's in the past
[28:46] leave it in the past don't dig it up
[28:52] don't talk about it brother branham
[28:54] actually says in one place the message
[28:55] help us Lord to bury it there and never
[28:58] dig it up again and he wasn't just
[29:02] talking about sinners coming to the
[29:04] altar he's speaking about from what the
[29:06] pastor was coming into the upcoming year
[29:10] we need to forget those things you know
[29:13] sometimes when we look at the past boy
[29:15] you could really labor on this thought
[29:17] but sometimes even the way that we even
[29:20] will allow ourselves to enter into other
[29:24] relationships with people and so forth
[29:26] is based upon previous experiences and
[29:30] we look and say I've forgot it but yet
[29:32] that at previous
[29:34] it's to keeps us in that place whether
[29:36] it's a lack of trust or it's a lack of
[29:38] this and it keeps us there and it's not
[29:40] God's will for us to be bombed bound to
[29:45] them but do do I believe that there are
[29:47] things that we can learn how many
[29:49] believe we can learn from things
[29:50] absolutely you know you never take
[29:53] things like I've told people before
[29:54] setting in the office I've taken paper
[29:56] and roll up I said you don't take your
[29:57] experience and just throw it off and say
[29:59] well praise be to God on this go on
[30:01] no let God teach us from these
[30:03] experiences it's true that Mozart and
[30:07] Beethoven threw away a lot of
[30:09] masterpieces but they learned from them
[30:12] to go forward onto the next sheet right
[30:16] so we learn from our mistakes and we we
[30:19] we need the grace of God to be able to
[30:23] forget those things that are behind it
[30:25] without laboring on this point let me
[30:28] just say it to you like this when God
[30:31] has moved into the depths of our life
[30:33] and that change has been brought by the
[30:36] Holy Spirit there is no longer a desire
[30:39] for the things of the world you with me
[30:43] there are traps and things that can be
[30:46] put along the way but this is where you
[30:48] have to come back to in applying the
[30:50] scripture is to come down to what is the
[30:53] desire within your heart if the desire
[30:56] within your heart you can stand there
[30:58] and say here is a repulsion to those
[31:01] things then listen to me brother and
[31:03] sister when God has brought those things
[31:05] to our attention you've repented oven
[31:08] you've made it right it's under the
[31:10] blood it's finished there's no trace of
[31:15] that coming up and that's where you had
[31:17] that's the ground you've got to stand on
[31:19] because you can't see it go in the blood
[31:21] you can't feel it but what you recognize
[31:24] is the release comes by you know the
[31:27] desire that's in your heart that desire
[31:30] you didn't place there it wasn't there
[31:32] but that is what the change of the new
[31:34] birth has brought in your life that's a
[31:38] powered see that's a that's a hidden
[31:40] power that's in that scripture because
[31:42] Paul is speaking brethren this is what
[31:45] we do
[31:46] and we reach forth unto those things
[31:50] which are before how many you realize
[31:52] sometimes the past can keep you from
[31:54] moving forward the past itself you it
[31:58] still of what the past was and the
[32:00] failures and all those things and it
[32:02] keeps you from reaching forward for what
[32:05] God has for you remember keeping the
[32:08] duality of yourself in mind when you've
[32:10] been born to the Spirit of God you've
[32:12] got a natural part and there's a
[32:14] divinity there's a divine part and
[32:16] remember Paul would see you tell us in
[32:18] Galatians five that the spirit lusts of
[32:20] against the flesh the flesh against the
[32:22] spirit it wasn't lowercase s its capital
[32:25] S there's a war but libram called it a
[32:28] constant war that is going on he also
[32:31] placed it like this white dog black dog
[32:34] you with me tonight and to see that how
[32:38] that that would be moving there back and
[32:41] forth and to recognize that within this
[32:44] here that by the grace of God there
[32:47] there is there is a goal that what God
[32:51] has for our life you realize that how
[32:53] God is so personally in services you
[32:57] watch how God will so hone our focus in
[33:01] so here you are you're sitting here in
[33:03] your home church but then here you are
[33:05] you'll be listening to a message you're
[33:07] reading in the scriptures maybe you go
[33:09] and visit another assembly visit some
[33:11] friends or what have you and here it
[33:13] just seems like everything is so
[33:15] personally being directed to you you
[33:17] know why that is there's a feeding
[33:19] that's going on it's a feeding that's
[33:22] going on it's not something that's
[33:24] scattered to you but you're recognizing
[33:27] this is a feeding that's going on it's
[33:30] God ministry and you know what you and I
[33:32] have the opportunity the privilege the
[33:35] honor at that time to be able to either
[33:38] hold ourselves or surrender ourselves we
[33:42] can either hold it I'm not gonna go it
[33:43] on that pathway I don't want to visit
[33:45] that pathway if I visit that pathway
[33:47] what it's going to require me or we can
[33:49] say Lord you're the one who's leading
[33:51] Lord I'm gonna follow after you I may
[33:53] have never been able to overcome this
[33:55] and this might have been a trap but by
[33:57] God's grace I'm gonna
[33:59] aside every weight and every sin that
[34:02] does so easily beset me you say that's
[34:05] impossible it is not impossible I can do
[34:09] all things with Christ Jesus who
[34:12] strengthens me it's not your strength or
[34:15] my strength it's him he's the strong one
[34:18] here he's the RAM who's on the scene
[34:20] it's our Lord Jesus Christ amen it's him
[34:25] we're not here turning new leaves
[34:26] tonight we're not here tonight say well
[34:29] I hope this but I believe with all my
[34:31] heart there is a vision there's a
[34:34] renewing to think of how they would
[34:36] start a new year and it would be a
[34:38] firmly spoken there at the beginning
[34:41] there were among the Jews this is a new
[34:44] beginning for you that's a very
[34:47] statement of exodus 12 this is a new
[34:49] beginning for you the world takes and
[34:53] they take it to one place and I'm gonna
[34:55] do this and I'm gonna do that and
[34:57] there's nothing wrong with all those
[34:59] goals you know many times I've always
[35:01] thought if I can always watch the
[35:03] neighbors and the exercise equipment
[35:04] they're buying now maybe by October I'll
[35:07] be able to get it for half price from
[35:08] them in their garage sale you know in a
[35:11] but in everything it all does
[35:16] start with a focus it starts with a goal
[35:18] we have things in a natural life we have
[35:23] things in a natural life face is still
[35:25] even in the natural life look was here
[35:28] around the church let me just just for
[35:30] just a moment here I think of what God
[35:33] how God has has blessed us with you know
[35:38] being able to do different things around
[35:41] the church here you know if there's a
[35:44] lot of things that's changed and it's in
[35:47] it it's it's very it's very nice looking
[35:50] I think so I really appreciate I
[35:56] appreciate everything that the brothers
[35:58] have done and have labor I appreciate
[36:02] how that things have really you know
[36:04] come together and things that's taken
[36:06] place and all of those things it starts
[36:09] with a vision you know you
[36:11] or me I mean that we might not have that
[36:13] vision of this needs to be done but yet
[36:15] we still have our vital vital part in
[36:18] all of it how we're bringing you know
[36:20] bringing to what God has blessed us with
[36:22] and here we are laying and saying Lord
[36:24] Jesus this is for your work Lord and how
[36:27] does he how that God through little
[36:29] things you know and I think of it
[36:31] there's no way that we would have been
[36:33] able for the work that's been done there
[36:36] is really no way that we would have been
[36:37] able to really have paid for it to have
[36:39] somebody to come in and do it but I'll
[36:41] tell you what I think it's been done
[36:43] professionally I really believe that
[36:46] with all my heart I think I think God
[36:50] for the brothers that's come in and I
[36:52] love the daylight on Sunday morning when
[36:55] I preach I'm looking forward to daylight
[36:59] springs gonna be coming I know somebody
[37:02] I know we're in January but Springs just
[37:05] around the corner I felt the warmth the
[37:08] other day but I think it's important
[37:12] that we look at those things you know
[37:15] God has allowed us you might say oh
[37:17] brother Samuel those things seem a
[37:18] little carnal but what if we don't take
[37:21] care of the natural what if we don't
[37:24] take care of natural things and cares of
[37:26] this building then it will hinder the
[37:28] spiritual the focus is let me make sure
[37:31] my natural does not hinder the spiritual
[37:35] let the spiritual govern the natural let
[37:39] it keep things in check because the
[37:41] spiritual it desires to be unhindered
[37:44] that Christ Himself could be glorified
[37:46] in me that natural man is always trying
[37:49] to encroach and sometimes as I said here
[37:52] it's not necessarily the encroachment of
[37:54] doing sometimes it can be the lack of
[37:56] you know there's things that all of us
[37:59] have had around our house said I was
[38:00] going to get to that I was going to get
[38:02] to that I'm gonna get to that I'm gonna
[38:03] get to that
[38:04] I'm gonna get to that and then by the
[38:05] time it comes around it's it's a repair
[38:09] beyond us then we get to a place why did
[38:13] I put it off so sometimes it's not us
[38:16] doing more sometimes it's putting off we
[38:19] really need the help of the Lord don't
[38:20] Lee we need God's help and to think
[38:23] we're living
[38:24] the time all of us since this we're all
[38:26] living in a time of such pressure
[38:28] there's more pressure in this age were
[38:31] pressured all around there's demonic
[38:33] oppression all around there's pressures
[38:36] all around there's things all around
[38:37] there's more you know so many different
[38:40] things you know that people are always
[38:42] you know things you have to normally do
[38:44] let alone having to tell people and turn
[38:46] them down I don't want new windows I
[38:48] don't need new windows my windows are
[38:50] only a few years old or 10 years old my
[38:52] house is this I don't need that you know
[38:58] you're gonna meet you got to run an
[38:59] extra part around the store to avoid
[39:01] them how many times I told you all I
[39:05] don't have TV in my house you asked me
[39:10] the same question over and over you get
[39:12] the same answer the pressures pressures
[39:18] so for all you forget those things in
[39:21] the past and reach those things are
[39:22] before verse 14 I press toward the mark
[39:25] of the prize of the high calling of God
[39:27] in Christ Jesus I believe that should be
[39:32] our focus
[39:33] I press toward the mark for the prize of
[39:37] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus
[39:40] look how Paul such this fourth year I'm
[39:43] gonna I'm coming down here let us
[39:45] therefore as many as be perfect be thus
[39:49] minded and if in anything you be
[39:53] otherwise minded God shall reveal even
[39:56] this unto you how precious is that we
[40:00] are perfect he said let us be less
[40:03] minded that we're pressing toward the
[40:05] mark and if there's any part of our life
[40:07] that's not in line with that Paul said
[40:09] this will be brought to our attention
[40:11] because why the desire of our life is to
[40:15] hit that mark the desire within our life
[40:18] is truly the rapture the change of the
[40:21] body and within that there is a longing
[40:24] within our lives to be closer to him
[40:29] amen we want to be closer to him we find
[40:32] ourselves this year no doubt within the
[40:34] past month
[40:35] you're more
[40:35] watch full of things hallelujah aren't
[40:41] you glad for that what comfort that is
[40:44] you know I've read that verse I don't
[40:46] know how many times and it just jumped
[40:47] off the page and I just about I just you
[40:49] know I had tears of joy within my soul
[40:51] if in anything you'd be otherwise minded
[40:54] God shall reveal even this to you I'm
[40:57] glad that he's watching over I'm glad
[41:00] that when we sit there and say and for
[41:02] my heart's Lord I want to be more like
[41:04] you the word pulls on our hearts he
[41:06] pulls in our life and if there's any
[41:08] little area he says don't worry I'll
[41:10] reveal it to you whatever areas out of
[41:12] line because I know the desire of your
[41:14] heart I'll bring it in line
[41:17] Alleluia I think God for that verse 16
[41:21] nevertheless we're we're too we have
[41:23] already attained let us walk by the same
[41:26] rule let us mind the same thing brethren
[41:29] be followers together of me and mark
[41:31] them which walk so as you have us for an
[41:35] ensample Brennan said it like this in
[41:38] the message Salome so he says as we face
[41:41] this year just like we do all years
[41:43] there's a regret of our mistakes in the
[41:46] past
[41:46] and I look looking forward for a future
[41:49] of the glorious light of Christ no doubt
[41:52] if we live through this year we'll find
[41:55] many mistakes that we have made and we
[41:58] just expect that because it goes along
[42:00] the pro and con that's the law of
[42:03] average that we live by here in this
[42:06] life but we're so glad we have a
[42:08] mediator who sets at the right hand of
[42:11] God to make intercessions when we are
[42:14] willing to admit our mistakes that we
[42:16] done wrong then he forgives them he is
[42:20] full of grace and mercy to forgive us
[42:22] for those mistakes aren't you grateful
[42:25] for them amen thank God for His mercy
[42:30] but the bantam says it like this here in
[42:33] another place he says images of Christ
[42:37] he says I want more of the Holy Spirit
[42:40] in me to reflect Christ in me
[42:45] he says I want to be more like him the
[42:48] Lord Jesus look what he says he says
[42:51] it'll take the Holy Ghost to do that
[42:53] that's the only thing can do it he said
[42:56] I'm not interested he says in seminaries
[42:58] kissing the crucifix or pulling them to
[43:00] my heart or saying prayers they did he
[43:03] said I'm interested in one thing that's
[43:05] more of the Holy Spirit to take over
[43:08] William Brennan I say man I'm not
[43:14] interested he says in joining a greater
[43:16] Church than what I belong to I belong to
[43:19] the real Church of the Living God the
[43:20] first point I was born into it I want
[43:22] more of the Holy Ghost in my life to
[43:25] reflect Christ who I love brother
[43:29] Branham says I don't care what plane I
[43:30] have to come on to get to it and these
[43:34] are some of the planes some of the
[43:36] planes some of the places we can we come
[43:39] to where people will call it bro Graham
[43:42] says they call you fanatic quite a Holy
[43:45] Roller see you're moving and desire I
[43:49] want to see more of him reflected in me
[43:54] no matter what that requires his focus
[43:58] was not on the requirements it was on I
[44:01] want more of the Holy Ghost because I'm
[44:07] not interested on the plane I have to
[44:09] come on I'm interested in the Holy Ghost
[44:11] so I can look at this here's the reason
[44:12] I'm interested in the Holy Ghost so I
[44:14] can be more of a servant like he was
[44:22] this is my heart's prayer I want more of
[44:26] the Holy Ghost to take over Samuel Brown
[44:28] II so I can be more of a servant like he
[44:32] was that's my desire you know I I know
[44:39] I'm no different from you you're no
[44:41] different from me you find yourself just
[44:44] as I find myself reflecting except I
[44:49] don't believe that we just wait to the
[44:51] end of the year there's times I always
[44:53] find myself reflecting could I what can
[44:56] I do more
[44:58] what can I do more when something hasn't
[45:01] turned out in a certain way or
[45:03] something's going on how could this have
[45:05] been better handled how could I've done
[45:06] this or how could this are your constant
[45:09] even even listen to me even when answers
[45:11] themselves come to a place
[45:12] sometimes things are uncomfortable and
[45:14] there's no other way around it but yet
[45:16] steel within our hearts there's always
[45:18] that place of reflection I've said this
[45:22] many times as a parent when I became a
[45:25] parent I find myself its constant
[45:28] constant reflection but let me say this
[45:31] to you
[45:32] reflection is not beating yourself up
[45:38] that's not reflection but by God's grace
[45:42] to be able to look and that the Holy
[45:46] Spirit teach us show us because our
[45:49] desire because we know that we make
[45:52] mistakes there was a statement I don't
[45:58] know how many times I've read this in
[45:59] Joshua chapter one but brother Matt
[46:01] Watkins was preaching there the first
[46:03] night at or the second night at the
[46:05] youth retreat and I just thought I was
[46:08] going to have to run the scriptures in
[46:11] Joshua were God told Joshua as I was
[46:15] with Moses so will I be with thee I will
[46:19] not fail thee I will not forsake thee
[46:22] and brother Matt under the leading of
[46:25] the Holy Spirit said if you'll notice he
[46:27] never said Joshua you'll never fail he
[46:30] said I'll never fail you
[46:33] he never said Joshua you won't forsake
[46:35] me but he said I will never forsake you
[46:38] I am so grateful because that's a
[46:42] reality he said I'll never forsake you
[46:47] I'll never leave you I'm so glad about
[46:53] that and tonight I pray that we can in
[46:57] our hearts with the testimonies we'll
[46:58] take a prayer request and then I'll let
[47:00] brother Brian do the bringing of
[47:02] different things up here with the
[47:03] testimonies songs and so forth but I
[47:06] pray tonight you know the desire that
[47:08] really would be within
[47:11] Hart I said god I want to be a better
[47:14] pastor I do I want to grow more you know
[47:21] I've said it over and over I said if
[47:22] there's ever a sign put outside that
[47:24] door don't you ever just put Samuel
[47:27] Browning brother Samuel pastor you make
[47:29] sure you put in front of Pastor
[47:31] associate in training because he's the
[47:36] pastor I'm just his assistant and I'm
[47:39] constantly in training but I mean that
[47:43] with all of my heart there's things you
[47:46] know because within let me say this to
[47:48] you within a church
[47:49] there's always has to be a vision we're
[47:52] not talking about filling the pews up
[47:54] but I will tell you this right here I
[47:56] doom in my heart pray God let there be
[47:59] hearts and lives that even Souls you
[48:01] would add to have a burden for your work
[48:04] what's going on here you might say
[48:07] brother Samuel that self is it's not
[48:09] selfish at all we realize we're part of
[48:12] the of the of the mystical body of Jesus
[48:16] Christ around the world but we have our
[48:18] part right here and God sees to it
[48:21] within our little platoon that we have
[48:23] here there is a focus and everything
[48:25] itself it's marching right under the
[48:28] leadership of the Holy Spirit and God
[48:30] has ordained that we are a focused group
[48:34] of people that we're there's a goal you
[48:38] say the rapture I agree the rapture but
[48:39] also praying God let the love of God let
[48:42] it so flow among us Lord and brother
[48:45] brems said keep malice from us Lord keep
[48:47] jealousy from us he said keep sickness
[48:50] from us keep these things from us and
[48:52] praying for that Lord granite Lord God
[48:56] let us let us be found wearing the
[48:59] garment of as the elect of God putting
[49:02] on that garment with bowels of Mercy for
[49:04] one another let us be found in that way
[49:08] - it's a place that where when there is
[49:10] those that's coming in those who would
[49:12] come they would visit it's not where
[49:15] they're just coming to a place it's just
[49:16] cold and I I believe this with all my
[49:19] heart the testimony that I have received
[49:21] from visitors not only from other
[49:23] churches but from
[49:24] that's come in here they have testified
[49:26] to the presence of God and to the love
[49:29] of God but I don't take that for granted
[49:31] it can go just as great as it is here it
[49:35] can leave you realize that we can't look
[49:41] at something of where it's at now or
[49:43] where it's been you know when you think
[49:45] of it
[49:46] ministry and different ministers I you
[49:49] know by God's grace I don't have when
[49:51] it's calling and you know many times of
[49:53] asking a minister to come in here
[49:54] they're not looking and saying you know
[49:57] this and that because the calm the
[49:59] comments that always come it's an easy
[50:01] group of people to preach to say brother
[50:07] Simon do you think and you take
[50:08] knowledge of that I sure do because I
[50:12] know that to be the truth but I always
[50:15] want his presence it's nothing that I
[50:18] look at and pride I look at it that it's
[50:21] because of his presence his Liberty
[50:25] hearts that are in tune and love the
[50:28] Lord are we a perfect people we're not a
[50:31] perfect people but we have a perfect
[50:33] sacrifice and were identified in a
[50:36] perfect sacrifice or it be to God amen I
[50:41] love him don't you
[50:43] I thank God I know not everybody's here
[50:45] tonight but I think God for each and
[50:47] every one of you I think God for your
[50:50] labor and how laboring but I believe
[50:53] with all of my heart there's more
[50:57] there's more for us there's more there's
[51:01] when we're looking at things in all my I
[51:03] just could keep going tonight but may we
[51:07] may we with all of our hearts this
[51:11] coming year may it be the desire as
[51:14] we're praying we need to pray for one
[51:16] another I need your prayers when we're

[59:19] started getting into my testimony and
[59:22] I'm one of the trustees and actually
[59:26] their testimony I want to give is just a
[59:28] continuance
[59:29] what brother Sam you started talking
[59:31] here about the church you know been a
[59:35] long time we were having meetings in the
[59:37] back room back there
[59:39] but the Samuel myself but the bill but
[59:42] they're all Bobby Carper and better all
[59:45] the trustees we were talking all the
[59:48] needs that the church needed and all
[59:52] that needed to be done
[59:54] brother Brown he was sitting back there
[59:56] and as we were talking he kept saying
[59:59] where's the money coming from every time
[1:00:03] we had a meeting he said where's the
[1:00:05] money coming from and nobody said
[1:00:07] nothing and you know we we got started
[1:00:12] working you know brothers and ourselves
[1:00:15] none of us were younger all Oh old
[1:00:18] people and we were able by the grace of
[1:00:22] God I don't believe we ever asked for a
[1:00:26] penny nobody ever got up here and asked
[1:00:29] for a penny and he seen the work that's
[1:00:33] been done to this church in the
[1:00:34] bathrooms the floors in the back and we
[1:00:38] had new stairs put up and we've done so
[1:00:41] many things the only people we've gotten
[1:00:43] in here to work on the people for the
[1:00:45] furnace and we got two brand new
[1:00:47] furnaces two brand new era conditions
[1:00:49] and all this work that's been done here
[1:00:51] in the church we never asked for a penny
[1:00:55] that's a miracle in itself why because
[1:00:59] we're a small group or not a big group
[1:01:02] no and you know I
[1:01:06] the Thursday one brother Sandhya was
[1:01:08] talking I already give this testimony
[1:01:10] Thursday I wasn't I didn't want to wait
[1:01:15] till today and then what his brother Sam
[1:01:19] you're doing into my testimony and yep
[1:01:23] but it's been just so much been working
[1:01:26] you know myself and brother Richard
[1:01:28] Sanchez and and all of us brothers got
[1:01:31] in here and we had a wonderful time we
[1:01:35] had a wonderful time working in here we
[1:01:37] worked hard and we got tired but we had
[1:01:40] a wonderful time because we were not
[1:01:43] going this work for the Lord
[1:01:45] but for the people all of this has been
[1:01:49] done it's been for you you know and like
[1:01:54] brother Samuel said you know we we have
[1:01:57] a testimony within ourselves as people
[1:02:00] come in here and see the condition of
[1:02:03] this church you know I sometimes I sit
[1:02:06] back there and I marvel at everything
[1:02:08] that's been done and we've never had one
[1:02:13] professional come in here well we need
[1:02:16] an electrician the electrician was laid
[1:02:19] off victim I Sonny and he came in here
[1:02:25] and he says he said I asked him but he
[1:02:28] said sure that I'll do it all and he
[1:02:31] said and I don't want no money first
[1:02:35] thing he told me said dad I'm not coming
[1:02:37] over here to get paid so let's get that
[1:02:39] thing out of the way lo and behold after
[1:02:43] a while we made a collection in the
[1:02:46] church and he was shocked but glad at
[1:02:49] the same time so you know I I just want
[1:02:55] to just get thanks to the people but
[1:02:57] especially thanks to God that God had
[1:03:00] moved upon the hearts of the people and
[1:03:01] we have everything paid off for all
[1:03:06] these things this little church is done
[1:03:08] and I'm just so thankful you know I came
[1:03:11] here one time when brother browning was
[1:03:14] preaching I was so tore up about his
[1:03:17] situation I had
[1:03:19] the financial situation and I left here
[1:03:24] this church what out of doubt not a
[1:03:28] penny more in my check and never looked
[1:03:32] back I made sure I told brother brought
[1:03:35] me back I said brother brownie I was I
[1:03:37] was just so tore up I just didn't know
[1:03:40] what to do what was confused my wife
[1:03:42] knew I was confused I was I just just
[1:03:46] didn't know it had no idea I sat down
[1:03:49] there and I left here like somebody turn
[1:03:52] on the light and that was it never
[1:03:54] looked back you know and what was it it
[1:03:58] was gone I'm thankful for God for how
[1:04:02] beautiful our church looks and all the
[1:04:05] work that's been done and we worked hard
[1:04:08] but it was sure we sure had a lot of fun

[1:04:47] to give a special thanks to the I don't
[1:04:50] know exactly which brother crawled under
[1:04:51] the church to do want the wires I'm just
[1:04:54] glad I'm not the brother what's brother

[1:04:58] Richie's down here I'm gonna give him a
[1:05:00] big hug well next time I see him because
[1:05:02] I would never be able to do that but
[1:05:05] thankful for the brothers that have done
[1:05:07] all the work and and and God providing
[1:05:09] for everything that's just thing that
[1:05:10] he's already provided brother Gomez is
[1:05:12] next give his testimony he's already
[1:05:18] proven
[1:05:22] he's always
[1:05:27] providing everything you need
[1:05:35] he's already provided every promise you
[1:05:47] can claim just asking his name
[1:05:56] everything that you need he's already I
[1:06:18] am NOT a person with many words but I
[1:06:22] thank God for what he had done for me I
[1:06:28] have a long testimony but I try and make
[1:06:31] it as sure as I can but being a person
[1:06:37] you know not knowing much about God and
[1:06:41] how he protected me through the years
[1:06:43] and how he had given me life and I had
[1:06:50] to really 76 years old that I am and I
[1:06:56] thought that I would know God when I was
[1:07:00] a child and and I really didn't know him
[1:07:05] but but I tried the best I could well
[1:07:09] says when I was a child to serve God
[1:07:14] yeah that was a little child that didn't
[1:07:18] have really much help from my parents
[1:07:23] didn't even know my dad when I was born
[1:07:28] he died and I didn't even see a picture
[1:07:31] of him I could have been there when I
[1:07:35] was a teen
[1:07:36] yet the Lord protected me in those years
[1:07:41] when I was in the service I didn't go to
[1:07:45] Vietnam and everybody else was going
[1:07:47] Vietnam and the Lord kept me from going
[1:07:49] to Vietnam and and there's so many times
[1:07:54] that my life games that I thought that
[1:08:00] if it would have been because of God I
[1:08:03] would have been dead a few times and I'm
[1:08:07] here by the grace of God I just wanted
[1:08:11] to talk older brothers and a sister I'd
[1:08:12] thank my pastor with the bottom of my
[1:08:15] heart God knows that I'll pray for him
[1:08:17] all the time the Lord would protect him
[1:08:19] protect his family and I thank for all
[1:08:24] the brothers and sister gather here
[1:08:26] somehow someway and one way or another
[1:08:29] you helped me to get closer to God
[1:08:35] believe me any little thing that anybody
[1:08:39] do for God he helped me to get closer to
[1:08:43] him so let's try to encourage one
[1:08:46] another and they just keep up one
[1:08:50] another in prayer and let's just say God
[1:08:56] been so good to me and I just want to
[1:09:00] try to do the best I can to pray for
[1:09:02] everyone every morning every night I
[1:09:04] pray for the brother and sister in
[1:09:06] Christ I pray for my own all my own cell
[1:09:09] loved ones I just thank God for the gift
[1:09:13] that we have we probably don't see it
[1:09:18] but we have a great gift in this place
[1:09:21] and you know sometimes we say man if I
[1:09:26] would have been in time of the Lord
[1:09:27] Jesus when he was here all the good
[1:09:30] things he did where he is doing it today
[1:09:33] what did we see her or not he's doing it
[1:09:36] his donor among us is doing it here and
[1:09:40] I thank God for that
[1:09:41] because let me tell you if I would have
[1:09:44] been the
[1:09:45] when Lord Jesus was walking on the earth
[1:09:48] one greatest thing got done in our day
[1:09:51] with brother Branham but yet it wasn't
[1:09:56] the man but he was always the gray I am
[1:09:59] Jehovah the Lord Jesus Christ they have
[1:10:03] a present why he is the one but do we
[1:10:06] see him do we hear him when he speak he
[1:10:12] speak to us all the time believe me if
[1:10:15] we can look beyond the veil of the flesh
[1:10:18] we can hear God talking to us many a
[1:10:21] times I have come with my wife talking
[1:10:26] about things that the product did not
[1:10:28] nothing about it and then the Lord from
[1:10:31] here he started to talk and I will tell
[1:10:35] my wife you know you see what but you
[1:10:39] see that's to me that is for me you see
[1:10:43] and I see it but he's doing it all the
[1:10:45] time here and and we keep looking back
[1:10:49] all the time we could look him back when
[1:10:51] he did in the past and you know what old
[1:10:55] it is we did in the past like the
[1:10:57] brothers in a little while ago what can
[1:10:59] we do with the things that we did in the
[1:11:01] past but repent but yet if we repent
[1:11:05] what are we going to do from this day on
[1:11:08] that's that's the main thing we can't
[1:11:11] repair all the things we did in the past
[1:11:13] because that's all we can do but what
[1:11:15] are we gonna do from this day are so you
[1:11:18] see I just say brother and sister I love
[1:11:23] you if you remember what the guy mean
[1:11:25] you pray pray for me because I tell you
[1:11:27] when I was going through this pain for
[1:11:30] seven day I had it the third day I say O
[1:11:33] Lord is three days already can you just
[1:11:36] eat a little bit and it was so hard that
[1:11:39] my wife had to help me get up from bed
[1:11:41] and I told my head was gonna fall off I
[1:11:44] have to hold it it was so painful but
[1:11:48] the seventh day and I was I was reading
[1:11:51] in the Old Testament I read in the
[1:11:54] morning I read at night from the Bible
[1:11:56] but I
[1:11:56] was reading about medium when medium was
[1:11:59] same things about Moses and house she
[1:12:02] was huddled on leprosy and she had for
[1:12:04] seven days and for seven day I had a
[1:12:08] pain so I said well it's okay
[1:12:11] you know God knows whole thing dad I
[1:12:14] knew God knew what I was going through I
[1:12:16] knew that and I said there's a reason
[1:12:19] for it I just got to know that I am in
[1:12:22] pain right now when this pain is gone
[1:12:24] away and when it feels so good but
[1:12:26] sometimes we have to go to those little
[1:12:28] test on trials to see when we are down
[1:12:31] there we keep looking up to him but
[1:12:35] we'll reach reach the top that's what we
[1:12:37] have to look to him the most always
[1:12:40] remember that when we feel that we are
[1:12:43] on top of the of the whatever it might
[1:12:49] be the mount or whatever how big the
[1:12:51] mountain is that is when we need the
[1:12:53] Lord the most because when we are down
[1:12:55] in the valley we know we need them but
[1:12:58] don't never forget God always be there
[1:13:01] but he's because of him we could have
[1:13:04] life pray for me and pray for my family

[1:17:26] oh you brought me yes you brought me -
[1:17:36] everyone I have a testimony and it's a
[1:17:41] to me it was very very how would you say
[1:17:46] it was it's been a hard testimony but
[1:17:50] it's been a it's a good testimony this
[1:17:53] last Monday I was supposed to have a
[1:17:55] double knee replacement for both knees
[1:17:58] one on each knee and it's a major
[1:18:00] surgery so what happened was it was it
[1:18:06] come out of nowhere really what happened
[1:18:09] I'm not saying this to to boast or
[1:18:13] anything but we were we were fishing the
[1:18:15] the work back here on this floor and
[1:18:17] that's benched brother Carlos and myself
[1:18:20] and this was 13 days ago so that was the
[1:18:25] last job that that I have even to do
[1:18:28] here before to get to surgery and what
[1:18:32] happened was that I was trying to
[1:18:34] negotiate with brother Carlos on who was
[1:18:37] going to go on the floor or who was
[1:18:40] gonna go outside and cut and because I
[1:18:43] don't like to go outside with God and he
[1:18:45] makes fun of me I said I'll do the floor
[1:18:48] but then while we were getting ready I
[1:18:51] decided to lay some tarp down and I put
[1:18:54] all those saws in the back room here so
[1:18:56] I said now you could lay the floor
[1:18:58] because of my knees so what happened was
[1:19:02] the flooring didn't go too well
[1:19:04] instead of two or three hours it took us
[1:19:07] five hours and every time I would get up
[1:19:10] and down where the colors would go
[1:19:14] bendito bendito means you know he feels
[1:19:16] sorry for me
[1:19:17] so when we left he said he took some
[1:19:20] talent on I said I took some Tylenol
[1:19:22] when I went home and stayed home when
[1:19:23] that was the end of us but we got it
[1:19:26] done but the strange thing is that it
[1:19:30] was eight days before my surgery and I
[1:19:33] didn't think anything of it so the next
[1:19:36] day which was Saturday no Sunday Sunday
[1:19:42] morning Sunday morning I woke up and I
[1:19:46] had no pain in my knees so I'm puzzled
[1:19:50] because I'm thinking what's going on
[1:19:53] because if you you got to understand
[1:19:56] that I took all the tests CT scans every
[1:20:01] test that I needed to take I've been on
[1:20:03] the I've been on the Internet and took
[1:20:06] and watched hours of YouTube or these
[1:20:08] neat operations I even watched an actual
[1:20:12] one which wasn't very pretty and and I
[1:20:17] joined a gym to exercise so I figure I'm
[1:20:22] gonna get ready for this I'm ready for
[1:20:24] this probably three weeks before the
[1:20:28] operation I was give it a little bit
[1:20:30] nervous but then I committed it to the
[1:20:31] Lord and then I was praying for the
[1:20:34] doctor so when this all sprung on me it
[1:20:38] was you could say it was like an ambush
[1:20:40] almost but it was like an ambush because
[1:20:43] I didn't have the stay at the Lord
[1:20:45] I didn't have nothing so Sunday came by
[1:20:48] and I'm puzzled I'm I don't know what's
[1:20:51] going on so I Monday I thought I'm gonna
[1:20:54] go work out really really hard so I went
[1:20:57] at I worked out hard and I was okay so
[1:21:01] now Wednesday morning I'm supposed to
[1:21:03] see this doctor so the last step is
[1:21:06] talked to him he's going to tell me
[1:21:08] exactly what's going to happen so
[1:21:10] Tuesday night I prayed I said lord if I
[1:21:13] wake up I'm gonna tell him that I'm not
[1:21:16] going to get this operation but I was I
[1:21:18] was in a conflict didn't know what to do
[1:21:21] because he didn't tell me to do this and
[1:21:24] because you know how we make mistakes
[1:21:26] and I've made mistakes where I prayed
[1:21:28] and I thought
[1:21:29] the Lord I didn't know what to do so I
[1:21:31] was in a trial so what happened was
[1:21:34] Maria went with me she stayed in the
[1:21:37] lobby I don't think she wanted to see
[1:21:39] what was going to go on and I never I
[1:21:42] never talked to people and trying to
[1:21:44] tell them I'm a Christian and this and
[1:21:46] that but when I went in there he he came
[1:21:48] in finally and he says are you ready for
[1:21:52] what I'm going to tell you and I said I
[1:21:55] need to talk to you so I told him I says
[1:21:58] you know I've been a Christian for a
[1:21:59] long time I said and and then I started
[1:22:04] telling what happened I says when I was
[1:22:06] 16 I used to wrestle and I tore my left
[1:22:09] knee cartilage big operation six days in
[1:22:12] the hospital that's the way it used to
[1:22:14] be then at 18 my senior year I told my
[1:22:17] write me but that one I'd let it go in
[1:22:21] it and I didn't get that operated till
[1:22:23] thirty-nine I'm telling him all this so
[1:22:26] I said at 55 I said I could not even
[1:22:29] stand five minutes at my job I was a
[1:22:32] machinist I could not stand in five
[1:22:33] minutes and I started getting cortisone
[1:22:36] shots but at first I went to a doctor
[1:22:39] and the one that did my knee my right
[1:22:42] knee at 39 and he told me that I needed
[1:22:45] a knee replacement so I left him I made
[1:22:49] another appointment with another doctor
[1:22:50] didn't say anything he said you need a
[1:22:53] knee placement at 55 so what we did we
[1:22:57] started getting cortisone shots they
[1:22:59] would last for two months every three
[1:23:01] months I would take them and after a
[1:23:03] year in two months he got to a point
[1:23:06] where it wasn't even helping me so he
[1:23:09] got to the place where one day the Lord
[1:23:13] just I felt that he showed me but when I
[1:23:16] got this bill that he just told me that
[1:23:19] you're being robbed and from there on it
[1:23:22] was like 85% and it got better and
[1:23:24] better see the Lord gave me like nine
[1:23:27] more years after that and about four
[1:23:30] years ago I started getting cortisone
[1:23:31] shots again but all that time when I
[1:23:34] ain't getting no shots no knee
[1:23:35] replacement by then now the other needs
[1:23:38] going bad so this is where we came to
[1:23:42] where
[1:23:43] August first I got my last cortisone
[1:23:46] shot and it only lasted about four weeks
[1:23:48] so I decided I'm done I gotta get this
[1:23:51] done
[1:23:52] so we got to this place where November I
[1:23:56] made the appointment about three months
[1:23:58] ago that I was going to get operated
[1:23:59] January 7th and about and I had another
[1:24:04] appointment for cortisone before
[1:24:06] November 6th so I thought I'm gonna
[1:24:08] sneak one in here so I don't have to
[1:24:10] take all these pills because I was
[1:24:12] popping a lot of pills taking a lot of
[1:24:14] pills I was stiff I mean you know pretty
[1:24:18] bad there's just a few people who
[1:24:20] probably know that brother Cruz bill my
[1:24:22] wife and brother go misnamed oh but I
[1:24:25] didn't say too much to anybody brother
[1:24:27] Samuel they might have known but he got
[1:24:30] to got to a place where I thought I was
[1:24:32] going to sneak another cortisone shot in
[1:24:34] there when I got in there he said we
[1:24:36] can't give you another one so from then
[1:24:39] to the time that we were putting that
[1:24:41] floor I was taking a lot of pain pills
[1:24:45] and some were pretty strong but what
[1:24:48] happened was that Sunday I woke up and
[1:24:50] that's what happened I didn't know I was
[1:24:53] a trial so when I got in there I went
[1:24:55] through the whole story I says when I
[1:24:58] was 55 when I was 56 that's when it
[1:25:01] happened I said the Lord gave me nine
[1:25:03] nine ten more years and I said I think
[1:25:07] that's what he's what's going on right
[1:25:09] now and then you know I told him I said
[1:25:14] you know what if he said no it's fine he
[1:25:16] said it's fine you know I don't know
[1:25:17] what he knows what he believes but I
[1:25:20] said if you don't want me as a patient
[1:25:23] anymore you can get rid of me goes no no
[1:25:25] no no he said you're fine you're fine
[1:25:27] you do what you got to do so you know we
[1:25:32] put it that he said if we do this again
[1:25:34] we'll have to go through this again we
[1:25:36] have to go through every step all over
[1:25:38] again and I left and I said okay you
[1:25:41] know I left I was you got to understand
[1:25:43] through this whole thing as a trial
[1:25:45] because I didn't have those things or
[1:25:47] but I could say now it's been I think 13
[1:25:51] days and I've been fine ever since
[1:25:55] I have not taken one pill for pain not
[1:25:58] one I'm standing here right now a
[1:26:01] hundred percent sometimes it's 85
[1:26:04] percent but like brother Gomez today I
[1:26:06] asked him I said how's your shoulder he
[1:26:08] says 95 percent and then he tell he told
[1:26:11] me this I'm giving the other 5% to the
[1:26:13] devil back to the devil so you know it's
[1:26:20] something that probably would have been
[1:26:21] easier to tell you the truth I told the
[1:26:25] doctor this I said I'm more nervous
[1:26:26] talking to you than the operation
[1:26:28] because I was not scared of the uppers I
[1:26:30] was ready but I'm just thankful to the
[1:26:33] Lord that what I've learned from this is
[1:26:35] that even though I wasn't praying for
[1:26:37] this
[1:26:37] I prayed before but what I've learned
[1:26:41] from this is that we always ask him for
[1:26:43] healing or praying for someone like
[1:26:45] those we don't know when God's gonna do
[1:26:47] this we don't know I don't know I didn't
[1:26:50] know you know that's what I learned we
[1:26:53] just got to keep praying believing and
[1:26:54] when God does it it's in his time but
[1:26:56] the stainless said the other day we
[1:26:59] can't beg God and that's true we ask God
[1:27:03] so I'm just so grateful that what he's
[1:27:06] done it's been a little trial my
[1:27:09] daughter-in-law she's a physical
[1:27:11] therapist she told Maria she says well
[1:27:15] what's going to happen when the pain
[1:27:16] comes back see so these are all things
[1:27:18] that come at you while you're trying to
[1:27:20] hang on to what's going on still not
[1:27:23] knowing if it was God or not but now I
[1:27:27] know that it well I've known that
[1:27:30] whatever happens I'm just going to keep
[1:27:32] claiming it and believing his word
[1:27:37] [Applause]
[1:27:48] he's a known time God yes he is oh he's
[1:27:57] an on time God yes he is
[1:28:04] well he may not come when you want him
[1:28:09] he'll be there right on time teasing on

[1:28:21] he's an on time God yes he is
[1:28:28] oh yes he's an on time God yes he

[1:40:33] somebody say that's a testimony I'm
[1:40:34] gonna get up from the church and I'm on
[1:40:36] testifying give God praise and then
[1:40:38] three years later brother Samuel has a
[1:40:40] testimony service and you realize boy I
[1:40:42] really I'm gonna I'm gonna tell that one
[1:40:45] tonight I got one
[1:40:47] I have several testimonies I could give
[1:40:49] but we kind of I don't think we have
[1:40:52] time for all of them but I want to just
[1:40:54] real quick give a short one and then a
[1:40:56] slightly longer one um a couple years
[1:40:59] ago about three years ago I had a
[1:41:01] surgery and I had never had surgery
[1:41:03] before and I was I was very very worried
[1:41:06] about it the devil had you know I heard
[1:41:09] stories about people getting put under
[1:41:11] and never waking up and I you know I am
[1:41:15] bleeding to death on the table and cut
[1:41:17] you up like a you know and I was I was
[1:41:20] very very worried and I I'd been praying
[1:41:21] and asking God to heal me and this was
[1:41:23] this was just the way that it was gonna
[1:41:25] be this time you know and I was and like
[1:41:29] I was thinking about what brother
[1:41:30] brother Richard was saying I didn't feel
[1:41:32] like I had thus sayeth the Lord on it
[1:41:33] like nothing had come down and settled
[1:41:36] in my heart and I was I was very
[1:41:38] distraught over it and we went sue and
[1:41:41] the kids took me to the hospital and you
[1:41:44] know sitting in the waiting room and you
[1:41:45] can't escape that there's no way yes you
[1:41:48] know by the time they they get that gown
[1:41:50] on you and they will you over to a table
[1:41:52] and I couldn't see my family and they
[1:41:55] were gone and I I didn't know if it was
[1:41:58] really the will of God and everything
[1:42:00] and I was I was laying there and I was I
[1:42:04] was just so distraught and the Lord just
[1:42:08] dropped into my heart my favorite song I
[1:42:11] remembered it and it was he gives me
[1:42:14] peace in the midst of the storm and I
[1:42:19] just started singing that song and as I
[1:42:21] sang it I started crying in the Spirit
[1:42:23] of the Lord came down when I was singing
[1:42:27] that and I was and I felt that pit that
[1:42:32] peace that he's talking about it
[1:42:34] so how many times a million times I've
[1:42:37] probably something that song here and it
[1:42:39] meant more to me than when I was when he
[1:42:42] came down in that room and not only that
[1:42:44] when I sang that I didn't know they were
[1:42:46] gonna do this here I hadn't seen my
[1:42:47] family for a while because they can't
[1:42:49] your family can't be there while they're
[1:42:50] opera they brought him around and had
[1:42:52] him come over and they they came over
[1:42:54] and talked to me daddy you're gonna be
[1:42:55] fine we're we praying for you
[1:42:57] everything's gonna be fine so and that
[1:42:59] this period of God came down and just
[1:43:02] blessed me and I I was I knew I was
[1:43:04] gonna be okay I wasn't afraid anymore I
[1:43:06] was like yep hooked me up go get it done
[1:43:08] uh-huh I didn't have any doubts anymore
[1:43:12] so I was thankful for that and I'm gonna
[1:43:16] try and keep this short but this is
[1:43:18] almost a life testimony for me
[1:43:21] I've been some leading probably since I
[1:43:23] was I think it was about 17 Sam you were
[1:43:26] what 20 21 it's been a long time and
[1:43:32] when I first started something I always
[1:43:34] wanted to you can ask any brother
[1:43:36] anything anybody that does some the
[1:43:38] Brian but the bill we delete songs
[1:43:39] anything that everyone think one thing
[1:43:41] we want to see is we want to see people
[1:43:42] God's people blessed I don't care if
[1:43:45] someone comes out and tells me great job
[1:43:46] I'm smack you on the back I don't really
[1:43:47] care about that I want to feel God's
[1:43:49] presence and see God's presence move on
[1:43:51] as people that's that's our desire and
[1:43:53] any brother that does anything in the
[1:43:54] church they want to see God's people
[1:43:56] blessed whether they're working or
[1:43:57] they're anything they're doing they want
[1:44:00] to see God's people bless and so I
[1:44:02] always put in my life I always said god
[1:44:03] I want to be where you want me to be
[1:44:05] doing what you want me to do supporting
[1:44:07] the work that you want me to be
[1:44:08] supporting so I've been here for a long
[1:44:10] time so I believe God's wanted to be
[1:44:11] here for awhile and I've had several
[1:44:15] times in my life where you know job
[1:44:18] situations you know they shut that this
[1:44:20] job shuts down there's a new job you
[1:44:22] gotta move here move there but it's
[1:44:24] always been right here with it within
[1:44:26] about an hour of the church it was over
[1:44:27] in Sandusky and then I'm over over where
[1:44:30] I am now and about five years ago I was
[1:44:34] working at FedEx I don't know if you
[1:44:36] anyone remembers I used to work at FedEx
[1:44:37] and they had a new VP come in she come
[1:44:40] in and said guess what I got great news
[1:44:43] all of you we're gonna let you all move
[1:44:46] down to
[1:44:46] Memphis so you can keep your job if you
[1:44:50] want to keep a job you have to move down
[1:44:52] to Memphis there wasn't really a choice
[1:44:54] given to us they said within the next
[1:44:55] year too we're gonna cut off all the
[1:44:59] Java development up here in Hudson Ohio
[1:45:02] so everybody was everybody was freaking
[1:45:05] out it was it was it was a scary time
[1:45:08] and so everybody started looking for new
[1:45:10] jobs and everything and I had I had
[1:45:13] several jobs on my on my plate that I
[1:45:16] wanted to sign up for and I was I was
[1:45:19] reviewing had a couple of recruiters
[1:45:21] looking at me I didn't know which way to
[1:45:24] go I mean I was also looking at moving
[1:45:26] down man can I move down to Memphis is
[1:45:27] that is that the will of God and I just
[1:45:29] I knew in my heart that wasn't the will
[1:45:31] of God I didn't think I wanted me to
[1:45:32] wanted me to leave here it's what my
[1:45:34] family is and this one my church my home
[1:45:36] churches and everything so I had those
[1:45:41] two jobs and there was one problem was
[1:45:43] how many knows what corba is anyone ever
[1:45:45] heard of CORBA when you leave a job if
[1:45:48] you got health insurance with your job
[1:45:50] you got Cobra Corp is a programming
[1:45:55] language I always get that one myself
[1:45:56] Cobra yeah Cobra is so you get three
[1:46:00] months of that you can continue your
[1:46:03] current healthcare but you got to pay
[1:46:05] for it every penny and it was gonna be
[1:46:08] about $3,000 me doing I did not have
[1:46:11] $3,000 laying around so I was praying
[1:46:16] about it I went to brother salmon we
[1:46:18] were in the back praying and I and I
[1:46:19] said I said I don't know what to do I
[1:46:21] said I don't know what job to take and I
[1:46:24] said I I've never asked for you know
[1:46:27] extra you know anything whenever I sign
[1:46:29] up for a job I just take it yes I'll
[1:46:31] take it
[1:46:32] you know I never said oh I want this and
[1:46:33] I want this and I want this I've never
[1:46:35] done that before
[1:46:35] so he said why don't we do this he said
[1:46:39] you need that korba money Cobra money
[1:46:42] you need that Cobra money to get you
[1:46:44] from this job to the next one he said
[1:46:46] why don't we put it before the Lord and
[1:46:48] you ask them if they'll pay for that
[1:46:51] Cobra asked both of them if they'll pay
[1:46:54] for that Cobra if you take that job no
[1:46:58] it was the one job I was I was looking
[1:46:59] at one instead of the
[1:47:00] I said we'll ask them and I went in and
[1:47:03] I talked to the HR lady on the phone
[1:47:05] they liked me they wanted me to come
[1:47:07] work for him I said I said I've
[1:47:09] explained to them a cobra situation I
[1:47:11] said it'll be three months because at my
[1:47:13] the new job they wouldn't give you
[1:47:14] health care until you'd work for them
[1:47:16] for three months so I would have to
[1:47:17] cover that out-of-pocket I said I know
[1:47:19] that's your guys policy I said but I
[1:47:23] tell you what if you'll pay for that
[1:47:25] Cobra and you'll give me one more week
[1:47:28] vacation I said I'll come for you I'll
[1:47:32] come work for you now and a day or two
[1:47:36] later they called back and they said yep
[1:47:39] no problem we'll sign it up no problem
[1:47:41] you come work for us I came back told by
[1:47:43] the same he said that's it yes yeah I
[1:47:45] was like yes
[1:47:47] that's what we were praying for it
[1:47:49] because because I said I said I just
[1:47:53] believe that God will provide and this
[1:47:55] is the last little part of this
[1:47:56] testimony just like I said I believe
[1:47:59] that God's always led me to be here God
[1:48:02] doesn't have to always have you in the
[1:48:03] same place God might someday all of us
[1:48:05] might God might have us go some once but
[1:48:07] I know that right now this is what God
[1:48:08] wants me and but I've been tempted
[1:48:12] I mean Columbus is a nice city there's a
[1:48:15] lot of Java development down there my
[1:48:16] kind of work and I was I've been working
[1:48:19] on a project for the last three years
[1:48:20] I've worked on a really big project and
[1:48:22] there's a lot of bosses down in Columbus
[1:48:24] who they've been working and they don't
[1:48:27] know much about the people that work up
[1:48:29] here in Twinsburg where I work for
[1:48:30] Cardinal health and I was working with
[1:48:33] one of these bosses and he said Brian
[1:48:35] you know what you are just the kind of
[1:48:37] guy I'm what I'm looking for for our
[1:48:38] architectural team because I'm just a
[1:48:40] programmer I'm a team lead by my just a

[1:48:45] come down because you've got on the
[1:48:46] ground experience I want you to come
[1:48:48] down to Columbus we will pay for you to
[1:48:49] move we will pay for everything I want
[1:48:51] you to come down to Columbus and we are
[1:48:54] going to give you the job title of
[1:48:56] solution architect and I've always
[1:48:57] wanted to be an architect to move on to
[1:48:59] that next level where you're designing
[1:49:01] systems the big systems and I was like
[1:49:04] oh man this is my dream and I was
[1:49:06] thinking abut Columbus how am I gonna
[1:49:07] make it work so I tried to my mind is
[1:49:11] you know it's like thank you lord I
[1:49:13] believe this is your will and I'm going
[1:49:14] going forward I didn't really wait for
[1:49:16] him to tell me if that was his well I
[1:49:17] just went ahead anyway and I started
[1:49:20] trying to work out how could I do it I
[1:49:22] talked to him maybe I could come stay in
[1:49:24] a hotel two days a week and then you
[1:49:26] know drive back every other day and you
[1:49:28] know maybe we can work something out he
[1:49:29] said no no no if you're gonna come down
[1:49:31] here and do this job you're gonna have
[1:49:32] to move down here I said we don't have
[1:49:34] the budget to support you stay in hotels
[1:49:36] okay so that I called up brothers and I
[1:49:40] was talking to sue and I said well maybe
[1:49:43] we can move like 30 or 40 miles north of
[1:49:47] Columbus and then I could we could go to
[1:49:50] brother Erikson's on to Thursdays and
[1:49:53] then on Sundays we could come back to
[1:49:54] the and she was like make it work it
[1:50:01] could work and I you know I called up by
[1:50:03] the Samuel and I asked him prayed he
[1:50:05] didn't tell me Amy he didn't say no but
[1:50:07] he didn't say anything like that I
[1:50:09] called him up he said let's pray about
[1:50:11] it let's pray about it and see if it's
[1:50:13] really the will of God you know and you
[1:50:16] know it said you know it's it sounds
[1:50:18] interesting because like I said it's
[1:50:20] what I wanted for my career it's really
[1:50:22] what I wanted and we we both been
[1:50:26] praying about it and he called me one
[1:50:27] night later that week and he he said you
[1:50:31] know brother Brian I've been praying
[1:50:32] about this and you know looking at it
[1:50:35] and and the way that you were talking
[1:50:36] about it he said it just dropped in my
[1:50:38] heart Lord spoke to me and really said
[1:50:40] this really isn't his will not
[1:50:42] definitely not you know not this time
[1:50:44] it's not God's will and like I said in
[1:50:47] my heart I knew I knew he was right I
[1:50:51] knew it was right but I wanted so badly
[1:50:53] that job and I said lord I it was so
[1:50:57] hard to I called them up the next day
[1:50:59] and I said I'm really sorry I said I
[1:51:01] want this so bad I said but it's just
[1:51:03] not gonna work for me right now I said
[1:51:04] my family my church I don't search
[1:51:06] everything I have is up here I just
[1:51:08] can't do it and the guy that was gonna

[1:51:11] well I understand that you know I have a
[1:51:13] whole church he played he plays an
[1:51:16] orchestra or something down there and he
[1:51:18] he said I understand that he said I wish
[1:51:21] you good luck
[1:51:21] and I felt so bad there was a guy at my
[1:51:24] job and said you better take this
[1:51:25] because this will be the only this could
[1:51:27] be the only time your career I had one
[1:51:29] time in my career somebody asked me to
[1:51:31] two to go to a place and I didn't take
[1:51:34] it and I've regretted it every day

[1:55:16] my mother who had a very difficult life
[1:55:19] just just so many hardships and my
[1:55:22] father passed away when I was five years
[1:55:23] old and mom raised us by herself I love
[1:55:27] my mother I have so much I thank the
[1:55:29] Lord for my dear mother and she she
[1:55:33] never gave up and I my sisters when the
[1:55:37] loire heck out of one of my life there
[1:55:39] was a complete change it was a
[1:55:40] transformation like they couldn't
[1:55:41] believe because when I was in the world
[1:55:43] I was in the world and then what
[1:55:47] happened they seen this transformation
[1:55:49] in me then my mom and my sister got
[1:55:50] scared and they were like she's in a
[1:55:53] cult she's in a cult we got to get her
[1:55:55] out of that call we gotta do something
[1:55:56] to get her out of that cult so then they
[1:55:58] start to plot in the meantime the Lord's
[1:56:01] dealing in my life and mom comes over
[1:56:03] and my mother's oh she was always angry
[1:56:06] bitter and angry and it was like and I
[1:56:08] was floating because I was God had dealt
[1:56:11] and changed my life so much I was
[1:56:12] floating in a different world I was so
[1:56:15] excited like and my mother couldn't
[1:56:16] believe where I come from and so then
[1:56:19] she was so
[1:56:19] agree and I remember her sitting on a
[1:56:21] sofa and I had the television and she
[1:56:23] was watching it and she was just full of
[1:56:26] so much anger and all of a sudden the
[1:56:27] Lord just something happened and I start
[1:56:29] to talk to about the Lord and she was
[1:56:31] sitting on a sofa and I put my hand on
[1:56:34] my mother's shoulder in the back I says
[1:56:36] mom why are you always so angry why are
[1:56:40] you always so mad and then the Lord put
[1:56:43] words in my mouth to tell my mom and I
[1:56:46] didn't know that but my mother wouldn't
[1:56:48] move she would not move she did she
[1:56:50] didn't do nothing she was frozen and I
[1:56:52] thought and I just kept talking I don't
[1:56:54] know what it was it kept talking and
[1:56:56] talking and after a while I saw my
[1:56:58] mother's eyes and tears were coming down
[1:57:00] her eyes and I thought you know I didn't
[1:57:03] know what's going on I just kept on you
[1:57:04] know but the Lord was leading I was just
[1:57:06] a tool in his hand so then my mom when
[1:57:11] you know she she just she couldn't say
[1:57:14] anything she just when she but I think
[1:57:16] when it was over she just stood up she
[1:57:18] goes oh let me go leave me alone and she
[1:57:20] left and I thought I don't know what
[1:57:23] went there anyways and then it wasn't
[1:57:25] till the Lord that Belinda and Mom were
[1:57:27] saying okay we gotta get her out of
[1:57:28] there
[1:57:28] we gotta get out of that cult and then
[1:57:30] they came to church and for the brownie
[1:57:31] was there and sister browning and the
[1:57:33] Lord was dealing with my mom through for
[1:57:35] the Browning and from then on my mother
[1:57:40] knew and my sister knew that the reality
[1:57:44] of the Lord Jesus Christ he changed my
[1:57:47] life
[1:57:47] she knew it they knew it and even my mom
[1:57:51] said this is her testimony she goes do
[1:57:54] you know that day I came over your house
[1:57:56] and I was so angry I said yeah mom she
[1:57:59] goes do you know that I wanted to scream
[1:58:01] and yell at you and tell you leave me
[1:58:03] alone shut up leave me alone but she
[1:58:06] goes do you know something had me by my
[1:58:08] throat and I grabbed my throat and it
[1:58:11] would not let me speak because she knew
[1:58:14] because God knew that if mom would act
[1:58:17] that way I'd shut up and I wouldn't say
[1:58:19] anything so guy thought I got this in
[1:58:21] the control don't you worry I hold her
[1:58:23] throat she wants anything you keep
[1:58:25] speaking until I get ahold of her so god
[1:58:28] is good he's kept me all my life you
[1:58:31] know he continues to be
[1:58:33] my strength is Amanda strength what
[1:58:35] she's going through and God has given us
[1:58:37] direction there and we're just taking it
[1:58:39] as the Lord leads and even a man they

[2:01:03] here's my everything
[2:01:07] [Music]
[2:01:19] myself us and sister needed to the
[2:01:24] winner you thought you don't know if you
[2:01:25] guys are familiar with that but it's a
[2:01:26] think seventeen and up or 18 and up
[2:01:29] singles only just gathered together to
[2:01:32] draw closer to God and from all around
[2:01:35] the world and just going to share some
[2:01:39] things what God kind of did for me and I
[2:01:42] think Paul too wants to share some
[2:01:44] things but I guess the main theme of it
[2:01:46] was not to be ignorant Satan's devices
[2:01:50] you know we have these phones and just
[2:01:55] so many things you know video games all
[2:01:56] this stuff this the way brother Samuel
[2:01:58] and and others broke it down but the
[2:02:02] theme really was just being disconnected
[2:02:04] from God and also distracted from God
[2:02:06] and and for me you know I just got this
[2:02:08] new job I know it's just a lot of time
[2:02:11] you know gets wrapped up in it but I
[2:02:14] just first wanted to thank the Lord for
[2:02:17] just just just really making itself just
[2:02:21] personal to me and how much he cares
[2:02:23] where I'm at right now and also for
[2:02:27] brother Samuel he wasn't supposed to
[2:02:30] originally preach for the Winter youth
[2:02:33] retreat it was supposed to be brother
[2:02:34] Aaron something and I just thank the
[2:02:39] Lord for him you know he does so much
[2:02:41] for us youth he hasn't set his house you
[2:02:45] know once every Friday and for his wife
[2:02:47] too I just so many people came up to me
[2:02:51] and it's a man that message was so good
[2:02:53] and I said yeah that's my pastor says
[2:02:58] why ice and you know they plan on
[2:03:00] visiting and it's just I just think
[2:03:03] brothers thank you brother Sam for
[2:03:05] everything you do for us the seen and
[2:03:07] unseen things and just it's just amazing
[2:03:10] but just that that concept just how God
[2:03:13] brought everything together every
[2:03:15] message was so personal just just about
[2:03:19] the Satan's devices and
[2:03:22] one of the biggest things for me was
[2:03:24] just how the Lord reminds us when we get
[2:03:28] off track a little bit whether it's our
[2:03:29] time
[2:03:32] we're maybe spending too much time in
[2:03:35] one area and whether it's it was through
[2:03:38] you know this retreat just God got me
[2:03:41] straight again got me back on track and
[2:03:43] I know he can share some things too but
[2:03:50] one of the last nights to God's presence
[2:03:54] was just so real after brother Matt had
[2:03:57] preached is the last night the
[2:03:59] expectation and things are high and we
[2:04:01] were just worshiping it was going up
[2:04:05] yonder we started singing that and I
[2:04:08] don't know if you ever seen those big
[2:04:10] like fans in a basketball gym or
[2:04:13] something it's like someone turned a fan
[2:04:15] on and I was pause me and brother
[2:04:18] Michael Belton in the front row I was
[2:04:20] like just a huge rush of wind just swept
[2:04:25] through the place and I had my eyes
[2:04:27] closed and I opened up I was like wow
[2:04:29] and I look back and then you know
[2:04:31] sisters started dancing to rejoice and
[2:04:33] people were running and it's just a good
[2:04:36] time you know I it's just just I think
[2:04:39] I've heard just pastors who care brother
[2:04:41] Paul and all that just they care about
[2:04:44] the youth you know because we're coming
[2:04:47] up here we're the next generation you
[2:04:49] know if the Lord tarries well this is my
[2:04:55] first time speaking in front of you also
[2:04:58] a little nervous you can't really tell
[2:05:00] but I'm nervous you know I want to share
[2:05:07] some real quick testimonies I'm not
[2:05:09] going to be long
[2:05:11] me as you know well I don't get out as
[2:05:14] much you know probably because I'm a
[2:05:16] homeschooler but you know I know that
[2:05:21] Lord really you know he's really been
[2:05:24] the only one with me he's been helping
[2:05:26] me a lot to overcome my fears anxieties
[2:05:31] going to certain places god I would just
[2:05:34] get so scared
[2:05:35] you know I get scared you know I would
[2:05:37] be like so afraid and I just I didn't
[2:05:42] know how to comprehend it I was just
[2:05:43] like yeah I don't think I can make it in
[2:05:45] life I'm an I'm just I'm so afraid of
[2:05:49] everything you know I'm just like I'm so
[2:05:52] scared you know I can't I can't go with
[2:05:55] a certain place and stuff like that but
[2:05:56] you know the Lord really has helped me
[2:06:00] and you know what for our family we went
[2:06:02] through a lot where so many of you know
[2:06:05] 2017 my papaw you know he went home to
[2:06:07] be a floor and just that's really struck
[2:06:10] me I thought yeah I never would have
[2:06:11] thought my papaw girl so you know I
[2:06:14] always he was my buddy you know my best
[2:06:16] friend but uh you know and I was just in
[2:06:20] the shower you know that I want you
[2:06:22] nights I was just crying it's the Lord
[2:06:24] you know I everything there's so much
[2:06:26] change going on and I don't know how to
[2:06:28] comprehend cuz we also just moved to I
[2:06:30] mean wow you know we just moved and and
[2:06:35] you know but I was just saying Lord you
[2:06:37] know just you know I just need your help
[2:06:41] I don't know I don't know what to do I
[2:06:42] just said I don't know what's going on
[2:06:44] but it was like you something just spoke
[2:06:46] to my hurt you know I thought you know I
[2:06:48] everything's changing like for me
[2:06:50] everything was just changing and I'm a
[2:06:52] person that doesn't like change well
[2:06:54] uncle Jerry a week before peple passed
[2:06:57] away he said well he said you know I
[2:06:59] know a lot of hole not a lot of people
[2:07:01] like change you said what it depends on
[2:07:03] what the change is that's pretty good so
[2:07:08] of course that that was needed that was
[2:07:11] needful at that time and so I was
[2:07:14] thinking me I just I don't know what I
[2:07:16] do I'm just Christ the Lord I don't know
[2:07:18] if I can I can't do this and why there's
[2:07:20] so much changing but it was like some

[2:27:18] let's stand oh my it's it's been a
[2:27:26] wonderful wonderful time been a
[2:27:28] wonderful time you know I think God for
[2:27:32] all of those testimonies thank God for
[2:27:35] the specials but I think the Lord
[2:27:37] what encouragement you know it gives to
[2:27:41] our hearts and you know there's many
[2:27:43] testimonies that could have been shared
[2:27:44] that what has already been done within
[2:27:47] the past year that are things that would
[2:27:49] be very I think needful to be reminded
[2:27:54] but I'm grateful that how that the
[2:27:58] testimonies that are given and my you
[2:28:00] can just see the hand of God and I think
[2:28:03] God for that you know if we look at the
[2:28:04] testimonies and we take them in the
[2:28:06] right light it shows that God not only
[2:28:09] is he among us but the Lord is mindful
[2:28:12] of every situation and there's things
[2:28:15] that you can look at and the testimonies
[2:28:18] that you give don't ever think that one
[2:28:20] is too insignificant because whatever it
[2:28:23] is it's personal and there's someone
[2:28:26] else that might be dealing with or going
[2:28:28] through that same thing and they can
[2:28:30] look at that and they can take
[2:28:31] encouragement from that very thing right
[2:28:35] there and say Lord how you directed that
[2:28:37] one you'll direct me as well amen water
[2:28:41] water what a comfort it is to us so boy
[2:28:44] I tell you we have to do this again

[2:29:10] we have a reason to be happy we have a
[2:29:13] reason to be happy Amen you know I
[2:29:16] looked at that scripture in Luke 15 how
[2:29:20] many even know where that talks about
[2:29:21] the prodigal son and you remember the
[2:29:24] two had the younger younger the prodigal
[2:29:27] and then he had the elder son do you
