[0:00] who will not leave me who will not
[0:03] forsake me I shall not be moved our
[0:06] trust has got to be in him
[0:08] Hebrews 13 8 says he's the same
[0:10] yesterday today and forever and he said
[0:12] again lo I Am with You alway even to the
[0:15] end the evening time preaching on
[0:17] preaching on it last night at the
[0:19] evening time I'll still be there
[0:21] I'll never leave you no matter what the
[0:24] boat is doing how much rocking and
[0:27] rolling they're doing or anything else
[0:28] I'll be with you be with you to the end
[0:33] time never leave you
[0:36] my what a comfort
[0:40] no matter what the boat is doing
[0:42] I'll be with you no matter what your
[0:44] mind is taking you through I'll be with
[0:47] you no matter the doubt that you're
[0:49] experiencing I'll be with you I would
[0:52] make it a a challenge to each one of you
[0:54] Believers tonight to remove every bit of
[0:57] doubt that you have in your life
[1:01] now it's not just Mind Over Matter
[1:04] but remove the doubt remove the doubt
[1:07] that he's not able remove the doubt that
[1:10] it's not for you remove the doubt that
[1:12] maybe this is the truth remove the doubt
[1:14] that you just happened stance in here
[1:16] remove the doubt that you're here by
[1:17] chance remove the doubt that it's for
[1:19] your sister or your brother remove all
[1:21] doubt and see how God comes on the scene
[1:24] when you're fully trusting in his word
[1:26] alone
[1:28] you're no longer hindered by what about
[1:30] or what if or if I do this or it's a
[1:32] circumstantial worship that way but if
[1:34] you remove the doubt it's God fully
[1:37] moving on your situation
[1:40] yes
[1:43] in such a way as in tomorrow when the
[1:46] Devil Comes against you like a flood
[1:48] recognize where your trust is your trust
[1:52] isn't not in your ability
[1:54] your trust is in him who said he'd be
[1:56] there
[1:57] your trust is in him that sweet dove
[2:00] that abides
[2:02] that sweet comforter that's there
[2:05] that sweet Redeemer that saved you
[2:07] I to think the struggles that we go
[2:10] through in this life
[2:12] and God
[2:14] saw Us Victorious
[2:21] he didn't he didn't see you I don't I
[2:23] don't believe the scripture says that he
[2:24] saw it a a ragtag bride
[2:28] that had torn garments
[2:30] that was just barely crawling their way
[2:32] through
[2:33] but he saw the bride who recognized
[2:37] I am bone of his bone yeah
[2:40] flesh of his flesh long time to speak
[2:42] over that
[2:45] we've got to change our language
[2:47] we've got to change what language we're
[2:49] speaking
[2:50] we've got to speak Jesus
[2:52] we've got to speak Authority we've got
[2:54] to speak over every Mountain that's in
[2:56] front of us to recognize that we are
[2:59] trusting in Him that's already
[3:01] overcoming
[3:03] Big Brother's here we're not waiting for
[3:06] him to come he's here yet a little while
[3:09] the world sees me no more yet ye shall
[3:11] see me the church the believer for I'll
[3:13] be with you even in you to the end of
[3:15] the world what are we setting here for
[3:16] what are we even living for what are you
[3:19] trying for what's your efforts for what
[3:23] are you sweating it out for
[3:25] if it's any right at all it's either
[3:28] every bit right or none of it right
[3:30] remember it wasn't you or I or your
[3:33] pastors that made the promise it was
[3:35] Jesus made these promises I remember he
[3:39] said it
[3:42] what are we going through this struggle
[3:43] for
[3:44] if this word isn't true
[3:47] if his promises aren't true if his
[3:49] victory is not true we are living and I
[3:52] know we hear this but we are we are
[3:54] actually walking
[3:56] in the last work that God will do on
[4:00] this Earth it's coming to manifest
[4:02] itself through the hands of Believers
[4:05] just like you can I just share a quick
[4:07] testimony that comes to mind just uh
[4:10] last two Sundays ago I was down in
[4:12] Georgia preaching a a meeting in and uh
[4:15] uh uh the anointing of God came in that
[4:17] building and this I tell this testimony
[4:19] because maybe some of you are going
[4:21] through the same exact situation but
[4:23] this this elderly sister came up was the
[4:26] first one to come up for prayer and she
[4:28] said I've got a cancer
[4:31] and I call it out in the name of Jesus
[4:33] Christ that was her faith that did it I
[4:36] told her by Mark 16 we'll lay our hands
[4:38] on you will anoint you with oil and he's
[4:41] already promised that he would heal you
[4:43] you've just got to believe it and we
[4:44] entered into prayer with her and she
[4:46] began to contact the one who saved her
[4:48] she began to contact the one who she
[4:50] knew would heal her she began to shout
[4:52] out and rejoice and recognize there was
[4:55] a greater anointing there than a man or
[4:57] or just her or big brother in the back
[4:59] but there was an anointing there that
[5:00] could heal a cancer there was an
[5:02] anointing there that could that could
[5:04] eradicate a sickness
[5:06] she began to rejoice and and left out
[5:09] there and I in the prayer I told her I
[5:11] said if you believe by tomorrow this
[5:14] tumor will be gone
[5:17] well you know I wouldn't be telling you
[5:18] this story if I didn't already get the
[5:21] testimony back that next morning she
[5:23] testified that she was listening to a
[5:25] take uh on expectation and while she was
[5:28] listening to that tape she felt just the
[5:30] the the anointing of the Lord come down
[5:32] and brother ran him in the tape said now
[5:34] Sister you had a tumor I said had it's
[5:37] gone and she reached down for that tumor
[5:40] and it was totally gone
[5:42] see we're not living some past age but
[5:45] he's doing it right now through the
[5:48] hands of Believers like you through the
[5:50] faith of Believers like us what are we
[5:53] living this forth he's not a man of his
[5:55] word he will keep his promise he will
[5:58] show up on time later on she had uh sent
[6:01] me the whole testimony she'd been
[6:03] diagnosed with stage four breast cancer
[6:05] it got in her lymph nodes and lungs she
[6:07] went back three days later she already
[6:09] had a scheduled test and they said we
[6:11] cannot find the tumor we cannot find it
[6:14] we must order more scares it's totally
[6:17] gone she said I know it's gone because
[6:19] God came and healed me on Sunday that's
[6:22] the God we serve our trust is not in the
[6:25] doctor our trust is not a medicine it's
[6:27] in God who healeth all my diseases
[6:31] now if he could do that for a cancer in
[6:34] in if the time continues in 10 years 15
[6:36] years she'll go on and pass from old age
[6:38] but what about the Eternal things that
[6:41] God is doing in his bride what about the
[6:43] holy ghost power that's still on the
[6:45] earth that's filling Hearts igniting
[6:47] Faith opening eyes opening ears
[6:49] recognizing the truth in our hour those
[6:53] Eternal things I put my trust in
[6:57] to testify of it
[7:00] we don't have to look back 60 years
[7:02] we're walking in God's miraculous age
[7:05] where he's working in in his bride it's
[7:08] him in her doing the Greater Works it's
[7:12] him and you
[7:14] that's going to resist that devil
[7:15] tomorrow it's him and you that's going
[7:18] to be able to deny every bit of doubt
[7:20] that comes into your mind it's him in
[7:23] you doing the Greater Works
[7:26] we've got to recognize where our trust
[7:28] is the man would say the only thing we
[7:30] have to do my ought to pay attention to
[7:32] that the only thing we have to do is
[7:35] wake up Shake ourselves call Jesus on
[7:38] the scene and father when you come on
[7:40] the scene speak that you are the same
[7:43] yesterday today and forever and let us
[7:45] know tonight that you're still in the
[7:47] boat you're still here you said I'll
[7:50] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[7:52] and let it be known tonight Lord that I
[7:54] have told the truth no matter how many
[7:55] words I should say I still wouldn't be
[7:58] like you saying one thing just one word
[8:00] from you will mean more than anything
[8:02] any man could say
[8:04] we want you father come on the scene
[8:07] just enough that these people here can
[8:09] see that you're in the boat and I
[8:11] believe that every sinner will repent I
[8:13] believe that every backslider will Rush
[8:14] quickly to the altar I believe every
[8:16] sick person will be made well won't you
[8:18] grant it Lord we're calling on you come
[8:21] Jesus
[8:22] some will perish Lord some will die the
[8:25] Eternal death the separation from God if
[8:27] you don't come on the scene we perish

[8:31] some of this had some some of them has
[8:34] forgot your great healing Miracles oh
[8:36] God move on the scene we're calling on
[8:38] you come and arouse our conscious Lord
[8:40] the spirit of Christ that's within us
[8:43] we pray through Jesus Christ's name
[8:46] amen
[8:48] come and arouse the conscience of the
[8:50] spirit of Christ that's already within
[8:53] us
[8:54] we've just got to wake up
[8:56] who's in the boat right the disciples
[8:59] were afraid they forgot who was in the
[9:02] boat
[9:03] we get afraid sometimes we get backed up
[9:05] in a corner we forget who's in the boat
[9:08] we forget what we believe we forget what
[9:11] our trust is in if this doesn't do
[9:12] anything else for us tonight you take
[9:14] these songs that I that I repeated back
[9:16] to you go back into and I think the
[9:18] brother was recording them down read
[9:20] those
[9:21] read those in the time of trouble my
[9:23] trust is in him at all times I shall not
[9:27] be moved he is my refuge in the day of
[9:31] trouble he is my stronghold in the time
[9:33] of Temptation I will put my trust in him
[9:36] at all times
[9:39] my goodness that will defeat the Devil
[9:41] in any circumstance that he comes
[9:43] against you in to know that your
[9:45] Authority is in the word you are
[9:48] anointed to speak this word in this age
[9:51] David was anointed to be king he wasn't
[9:53] worried about it he knew the hour would
[9:56] come that he would be king
[9:58] all right what about you
[10:00] you recognize the anointing power that's
[10:03] been placed on the bride in this age
[10:04] through this messenger you are anointed
[10:07] to overcome the devil that nobody else
[10:10] has been able to do but you this
[10:13] generation this age coming out of an age
[10:16] this age
[10:18] you will defeat him
[10:19] you will bind him in circumstance you
[10:22] will kick him into the Lake of Fire I
[10:24] think it's time to reverse the script on
[10:26] the devil and tell him who he's messing
[10:27] with I don't know who you think you're
[10:29] messing with tonight Della but you're
[10:30] not messing with just some kid on the
[10:32] Block I am a blood bot Blood Washed son
[10:36] or daughter of God and I will not be
[10:39] moved I know where my confidence lies I
[10:43] know who I put my trust in
[10:46] all times
[10:48] I will not be moved
[10:50] our trust is in him who's already
[10:54] working for us my to think he's already
[10:57] moved on the scene
[10:59] he's already ministered to us
[11:02] he's already brought the healing
[11:04] we just got to recognize it he's already
[11:06] brought the Holy Ghost we've just got to
[11:08] recognize this here he's already brought
[11:10] the quickening power to the word we've
[11:12] just got to open our eyes to see it's
[11:14] all ready here
[11:16] remember when John Ryan went through the
[11:18] prayer line and brother Branham told him
[11:20] you're healed and then he went off the
[11:21] he went off the stage and then you know
[11:23] he was a little troubled he couldn't see
[11:24] he said that man told me I was healed
[11:27] right so he marches back up there and he
[11:29] said you said I was healed I still can't
[11:31] see he said you are healed
[11:34] just go testify
[11:36] just go Testify the vision never lies I
[11:41] see you with Clear Vision
[11:43] you are healed just go testify it there
[11:47] is where we become Overcomers in between
[11:49] being told that we're Victorious and
[11:52] manifesting the Victorious word there he
[11:55] was two weeks later in a barber's chair
[11:56] telling everybody I'm I'm Healed I can
[11:59] see I can see and you can imagine
[12:01] they're just putting their hands in
[12:02] front of his eyes
[12:07] but all of a sudden
[12:09] his confession
[12:11] became a reality
[12:14] it's exactly like us like us in this
[12:17] generation looking to the Fulfillment of
[12:19] the word our confession is becoming a
[12:22] reality we have been preaching and we
[12:24] have been living these things for for
[12:26] years some of us our entire lives have
[12:28] been striving to fulfill this but now in
[12:31] this season under this anointing we are
[12:34] seeing the manifested word of God come
[12:37] to pass in our lives
[12:39] this is what we have waited for this is
[12:42] what we have prayed for what we've grown
[12:43] for what we've sacrificed for we've been
[12:46] obedient to the word to see the
[12:48] manifestation of this word in our life
[12:52] if not then what are we doing
[12:54] all right why are we here why are we
[12:56] living this somebody's gonna manifest it
[12:57] it's happening now I say get in the boat
[13:00] it's time it's not time to doubt it's
[13:04] not time to reason with it it's time to
[13:06] get all in surrender every doubt
[13:08] surrender everything that's holding you
[13:10] back get all in
[13:11] testify until it becomes manifested you
[13:15] know Brother Band it was like that for
[13:16] me when I claimed to have the Holy Ghost
[13:17] I was like Paul Ryan
[13:19] I believe that I got the commission of
[13:21] the Holy Ghost one night and it took it
[13:23] took months I was testifying I got it I
[13:25] got it I got it one day I was just by
[13:27] myself somewhere and that promise came
[13:29] to manifest
[13:31] because I'm an overcomer
[13:33] now what about you tonight are you an
[13:35] overcomer I believe you're already here
[13:37] showing the devil that he didn't have
[13:39] enough to stop you you didn't have
[13:41] enough to get you to stay home tonight
[13:43] you didn't have enough to get you to
[13:45] sound too tired to go I worked too hard
[13:47] today I dug too much dirt today he
[13:49] didn't have enough you are here and
[13:52] where he is
[13:53] there is Liberty I don't know what
[13:56] situation you're in tonight but there is
[13:58] Liberty here to get free from any
[14:00] circumstance
[14:02] say Lord
[14:03] I'm drawing the line
[14:06] I'm walking out of here Victorious
[14:09] I am sick and tired of the devil telling
[14:12] me how far I can go
[14:15] what I can attain what I can achieve I
[14:18] say it's time to flip the narrative on
[14:19] the devil
[14:21] listen here bub
[14:24] I don't know who you thought you picked
[14:26] a fight with
[14:27] but you picked a fight with the wrong
[14:29] guy
[14:30] I have authority within me because my
[14:33] trust is in him who has already defeated
[14:36] you
[14:37] they're on Calvary when you thought you
[14:39] beat him he defeated you there in the
[14:42] wilderness when you tempted him and you
[14:43] thought he you defeat him there he
[14:46] defeated you there was Joe when you
[14:48] thought you'd defeat him by the same
[14:50] things that took you out of Heaven job
[14:52] overcame you by the word of the Lord
[14:56] you recognize this it's the same
[14:58] anointing that job had you recognize
[15:01] this Faith it's the same faith that
[15:03] Peter had it's the same faith that Paul
[15:06] had you've lost every time you've came
[15:09] against this faith I say it's time to
[15:11] recognize who we are amen we are not
[15:14] packing some weak watered-down religion
[15:16] we are packing the living Pillar of Fire
[15:19] in this hour that will overcome every
[15:22] enemy in front of us
[15:24] it's a reality to me
[15:26] he's not forgot about you it's the never
[15:29] failing presence of Jehovah
[15:33] maybe it's been some time since you felt
[15:35] that presence you know a lot of times
[15:36] we'll go through these private battles
[15:38] and we'll we'll take burdens on ourself
[15:40] and nobody around us seemingly will know
[15:43] that we're packing this this heaviness
[15:45] you might get asked a question are you
[15:47] doing okay
[15:48] yeah yeah
[15:51] no
[15:52] you didn't have you don't have as much
[15:53] joy as you used to have
[15:55] to have Liberty like you used to have
[15:58] you know the prophet went through the
[15:59] same thing
[16:01] you got a burden on him
[16:03] and yet he was still going to church he
[16:05] was still preaching he was still praying
[16:07] for the sick people were still getting
[16:08] healed revivals were coming and going
[16:10] but he carried this burden with him all
[16:12] that while knowing within himself I'm
[16:15] just not I'm just not as joyful
[16:18] as I used to be
[16:21] but remember
[16:23] he says I said
[16:25] he was there in the wilderness remember
[16:28] he said a voice spoke out just as clear
[16:30] right out of them blue skies not a cloud
[16:34] it all been within just about just a
[16:36] little bit of time now remember just
[16:37] before this there was a big Mighty storm
[16:40] but the man would say the sun's always
[16:42] there
[16:43] is just beyond the clouds
[16:47] he says a voice spoke out just right out
[16:49] of them blue skies just a little bit of
[16:51] time and a voice spoke and said you
[16:53] remembered your promise didn't you I
[16:55] said yes Lord
[16:56] he said I'll remember mine too
[16:59] I'll never leave you nor forsake you and
[17:02] the burden left my heart it hasn't been
[17:05] there since and may it never again the
[17:08] burden
[17:09] left my heart
[17:11] as simple as remembering his promise now
[17:14] for brother Branham it was I'll never
[17:15] shoot a deer that I don't have a tag for
[17:18] and you might think that's a simple
[17:19] thing but how many promises have you
[17:21] made God
[17:25] and now there's a burden on you
[17:27] but it's as simple as remembering your
[17:29] promise
[17:30] and he'll remember his too I'll never
[17:33] leave you
[17:34] nor forsake you by the ramp said I saw
[17:36] that Pillar of Fire said to John his
[17:39] never failing presence
[17:41] as he said in John over there his never
[17:44] failing presence will never leave you
[17:49] he'll never leave you
[17:51] and Enoch one day walk like that you
[17:53] know what he done he walked all the way
[17:55] home with God got so far up the road he
[17:57] didn't want to come back anymore walk
[18:00] with God the doctor says you're going to
[18:01] die walk with God yeah the doctor says
[18:03] you can't well walk with God just walk
[18:05] with God that's all for God has promised
[18:08] you I'll never leave you or forsake you
[18:11] I'll be with you to the end of the world
[18:13] and he took an oath and by the Covenant
[18:15] that he get that he give you that he
[18:17] would confirm it just walk with God then
[18:21] you'll have your ups and downs don't
[18:24] worry you've got to go through Briar
[18:26] patches and over sharp rocks and over
[18:27] Bluffs down over hillsides up through
[18:30] mountains over Waters sound familiar
[18:32] Church
[18:33] but walk with God
[18:35] yes sir there's so many Hills to climb
[18:37] upward you've heard the old song but how
[18:39] little it'll seem when you get to the
[18:42] end of the way my mind just look at
[18:44] there all that's been look back at your
[18:46] Footprints it won't be very much
