[Music] oh praise the lord amen aren't you glad for that amen amen amen oh my how thankful we are for the grace of god amen just so thankful to be back together again amen and just want to say we so enjoyed the services that brother daniel ministered here and what a word that came to really to edify amen challenge our hearts our lives and to edify us as believers and uh one thing we become more and more aware of and more and more real to our lives that he's not god somewhere out there and it's not just god right next to you but it's god in you and the same god who created in the beginning that same god is living inside of his believing children to think of it oh my just it just really humbles us may we just with all of our hearts just so yield ourselves to that god who's on the inside amen amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father it's just so good to be gathered together again lord oh father what a privilege it is lord to come to the house of the lord we pray oh god you would just lord move among us in a special way tonight father you know our needs lord you know those lord things lord to be spoken and we ask that god we want you to be at liberty right here among us lord oh god that you would speak so personally to our hearts lord and father for every request lord as we lord different ones among us o god different things lord of sickness and things lord but oh god how thankful we are that father your word stands true that you lord are the lord our god who healeth all our diseases oh god you are still the mighty conqueror lord and father we thank you lord for those stripes tonight that were laid and you took lord on our behalf o god we love you lord we appreciate you oh god father we just ask that you'll just come lord just take lord these vessels tonight lord speak and hear through us we pray oh god may our lives be built up and edified by the holy ghost we pray we love you and thank you father in jesus name amen amen if you would let's turn to joshua chapter four i'd like to just like to go on just a little bit tonight i'd just like to say so appreciate prayers for for us and family and different ones and sickness and things we just so thankful for the touch from the lord amen i we streaming there the past two services i tell you i i said this it's just not the same it's not the same i mean the word is is wonderful but it's just it's not the same i'm just so glad that that's to me it's just not well i guess it's an option if you're sick but i just i i'm so glad that we get to come to the house of god amen because as we come to the house of god it's we are channels one to another and the spirit of god just moving here among us and that's something that just is so precious and just to see one another and be with one another and more likes of fire coming together oh my this is what god intended it to be amen so let's just look in joshua chapter four verse one and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over jordan that the lord spake unto joshua saying take you twelve men out of the people out of every tribe of man and command ye them saying take you hence out of the midst of jordan out of the place where the priest's feet stood firm 12 stone so they're taking 12 stones out of the jordan where the feet of the priest have stood and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you shall lodge this night then joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of israel out of every tribe of man joshua said unto them passover before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel that this and i want you just to look here in verse 6 that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones then you shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be a memorial unto the children of israel forever and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up 12 stones out of the midst of jordan as the lord spake unto joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged and laid them down there and joshua set up 12 stones in the midst of jordan in the place where the feet of the priest bear the ark of the covenant stood so they took 12 stones out and there's 12 stones that went in where the priest's feet stood so joshua let me read verse 9 again joshua set up 12 stones in the midst of jordan in the place where the feet of the priest which bear the ark of the covenant stood and they are there unto this day amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i'd just like to speak just for a few moments on living memorials of the living god living memorials of the living god and we were looking at this here a few weeks ago and of how that coming into this place of promise and our promised land and how that joshua in coming into this the word itself is what was placed first joshua when he he put his his confession his confession was based upon the word that god was going to open up the jordan and make a way you know brother branham said it like this in the message of guide he said the pillar of fire led them all the way through the wilderness and he led them up to the promised land gate and that's as far as he was going to go to think that the pillar of fire now the pillar of fire didn't stay over there but you see and now it would come to a time where the pillar of fire has led them to the promise now it's time for the people of god to believe the word that god has spoken now we know that god's god always in fulfilling his word it takes the holy spirit to come to unctionize that word it takes god coming even upon hearts and lives that lives begin to hunger for the living god to come and and to move upon his word and to know that when we if we could just jump ahead just for a moment that that pillar of fire when joshua would meet him over in the land it was not a pillar of fire but god had come down in the form of the captain of the lord's host so it was the same god all along but how god will lead us to the promise now it was now time for as the word would be placed there first and the word itself when we think of the ark going forth into the into the waters and remember how that god had spoke through joshua to stay within a certain distance of that of the ark and stay behind it you've never passed this way before so the word was was opening up the way and you know when we look at this it the ark itself would speak that the word would be embodied it would be expressed that it's going to go into jordan to make a way to open up the way for the people of the promise to cross over it would be the way of the word and the path of the word that would open up the way into the promised land you think about it of how that when you know god when he comes to give leadership to our lives you know there's god will always his leadership always comes by his word and and the guide that god has given is the word itself being made manifest think think about when here they stood on the day of pentecost and they came out from the upper room and there were those that begin to ask questions what must we do to be saved and peter begin to express the word he's he's letting him know this what you are seeing is the promise that god has made in his word and that word has been fulfilled now when that word is being placed before the people it's now up to them will they follow the word of god on into the promise of god you see god in order to provide a god a person could look at the scriptures but the guide itself is when god comes down and gets into his word and makes that word alive makes it real it's just like when peter stood there in the house of cornelius now think of him the angel told cornelius uh regarding there is a man a simon you know a tanner by trade he he calls him out and tells him where to go and there's a man you know down there on the street of joppa and the thing an angel would tell him go down there and and require and ask of that man to come here and to stand in your house and to minister you're you're desiring to know more of god but i want you to go get in contact with peter because god had a representation of that word upon the earth and god has reserved it that the guide himself would be christ embodied in his people because when we think of the ark of the lord it god used that as a type to where it would be his very word his presence that would be abiding in the very heart and life of the believer it would be his word that would be dwelling within your life not a dead letter but a living god a living reality in your life to where peter could stand there and when he came to cornelius house and he said i'm here and cornelius said we're all gathered here and we are waiting to hear the words that god has given to you see in that moment the guide was standing present in peter's life to guide them into a place and the bible said while peter yet spake these words peter went through the prophecies of those things that concerned the fulfillment of the messiah and the coming of the holy ghost and peter preached that with a living experience in his life it wasn't something that was secondhanded but the guide himself was speaking through peter and was giving the leadership into the promise and the bible says that while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell upon them their hearts were made available to receive the word of almighty god so the guide itself is the living word of god made manifest so when we consider this in this hour brother branham would say it like this and i have heard but now i see he said you know thinking of the church he said you're looking at it with your own eyes the living word of god made manifest the promise of the hour in the last days looking with your own eyes at the living word being interpreted in natural form god among us so the people what what they are witnessing is when we talk about the promise of malachi 4 that is a promise that god has made that he has come down to fulfill that promise and god will not fulfill it through any other way but through the life of a believer and god already had a channel when we look at that promise of malachi 4 you think a virgin shall conceive when you look at all of those promises god already had ordained vessels that he would use to manifest that word through in that time it would take a as as god would work through that and the things that were taking place in the ministry when we think of brother adam the ministry that was here as god continued to unfold his word in this hour it was more than just signs and miracles that were being done because let me tell you many of the pentecostals were stirred up about the signs and wonders but that's not what this message was about this message it came to bring a relationship between god and his people to where the people of god would recognize the living god in their midst and there would become a union between god and his children god would make that word so real he would make it manifest sure the signs and wonders they would confirm that he is here and if he is here then every promise that he's ever given in his word he's here to make good upon that promise let me tell you he's the same god right here tonight so here as god interprets it he interprets it by manifesting it now there's there's two memorials when we look at this here that i want to just kind of deal with here a moment do find that there's the 12 stones that come up that they're brought up out of the midst of jordan where the feet of the priest were at and then we have 12 stones that are put in where the priest's feet stood you see it shows one thing that that when we look at this and see the reality that there is no way that man could cross over into the promised land this was all a type about you as a believer crossing into the promised land of the word of god the holy ghost we could not get in there without the word himself coming down and becoming flesh the word had to become flesh the word itself had to bleed because a spirit can't do that but god had to become flesh he had to die there had to be blood that was shed and then he rose up on that easter morning now to think of this the word itself came down and took our place amen there was one who went and took our place in the judgment in death that we might take his place in other words we were those stones that were there in the river jordan but god came down and brought us out of jordan and there's one that stands there there's a memorial that stands there that i am your waymaker i'm the one who made a way for you when you couldn't get over there the ark itself the word became flesh to open up the way for you and i think about it that god would come time and time again in this generation and every time for a heart that desires to know god in a living reality to know god in a personal way there's a hunger that you didn't place within yourself and let me tell you something there is nothing of this world that can ever satisfy that thirst you can go from here you can labor after this you can labor after that you can go everywhere in the world but there is nothing that will place that rest of the holy ghost of you coming into a personal relationship with jesus christ it's god who placed that hunger there and blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled let me tell you something if you've got a desire to serve god that is greater than every devil out of hell you might say brother samuel i'm longing for the holy ghost but if you've got the least desire in your life it's greater than every devil because that desire is a heavenly desire and it's greater than every demon there's not a devil big enough strong enough bad enough or big enough that can hinder the word from coming to pass oh let's glorify almighty god hallelujah if you've got the least desire move on that pulsation brother samuel it's a small desire it's bigger than every devil [Applause] hallelujah all through this building right here the man standing right here it started from a small desire a desire that was tucked down way down in there oh there was darkness over it there was all sorts of things things of the world but there was a desire that one day i'm gonna serve god but i don't know how i don't know how to get there but he came to me there was a desire that was on the inside god put that desire there sunday school teacher didn't put it there daddy reading the bible listen to the message didn't put it there that desire came from the mind of god and it was here when i came into this earth it was a longing for a fellowship with almighty god brother samuel what should i do well you put the word first put your confession with the word before the jordan ever opened up the word had to be put first and joshua put his confession right upon the word think about it this the word was made flesh and took our place in judgment in death i think of the scripture here if i can cut in and read it of second corinthians 5 21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him let me tell you the preaching of the gospel is not about a historical event but it's a living god who comes right here right personal right up next to us and there's a faith that begins to rise in our hearts that wouldn't that moves us beyond doubts it brings what is it listen friends it's not something that can be worked up it's not what a music does it's nothing that that old music music doesn't do this it's his presence that begins to warm our hearts it's his presence moving in our midst that begins to get our attention what is it it's the guide of the word himself oh glory be to god it becomes real to us that he's for me he is my liberty now think of this in verse 20 of joshua 4. and those 12 stones which they took out of jordan did joshua pitch in gilgame and he spake unto the children of israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean these stones then you shall let your children know saying israel came over this jordan on dry land for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you until you were passed over as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up before us until we were gone over so the same experience of the same god who moved down upon the red sea and they went forth on dry ground god did the same thing one more time amen when there was no way that was open to them and the enemy was breathing down their necks god made a way how did he make a way speak the word and go forward his word opened up the pathway and that's the same way it it has been here with the jordan god come down once again and he makes his word alive and real the same experience of the same god that they walk across on dry ground think of this how the bible records it that the waters were stayed they were stayed it didn't become a pooling reservoir they were stayed how god stopped it where the waters stood up and they were able to walk down right through the midst of it maybe four or five hours with all those millions that crossed through there and had to pass through in that time but god stayed the waters why because it was a time for his children to cross into the promise god's still a waymaker tonight god's a waymaker tonight god knows how to bring a stay in your life god knows how to bring a stay in your family god knows how to bring a stay in your body god is still the same god oh glory be to god think of it that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty that you might fear that ye might fear the lord your god forever now think of it this in this word this word campaign if i can say it in that way this is god's word and it's the only way that god will ever fulfill his word is through believers is that right remember the pillar of fire was given direction through joshua and there the word of the lord went forth and there were believers in that day that god was going to prove his word through now think of this how brother braham says this in proving his word he says it like this he says it is by believers that he proves his word by he can only prove his word not by unbelievers it's only by the believers that he can prove his word no matter how much the rest of them claim to be oh i believe brother see if you do god will prove it so because we look and we see the others and how can we say then but you see it's by true believers that he proves his word not by those who say they believe but those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word i tell you it can't get any more simple god only asked us do you believe do you believe me because if it is that is where it comes down it is faith that comes down into the finished work of almighty god but many times friends what hinders the belief is we've got too many things still lingering and clogged up in our life so many times there's things that can be unconfessed sin it could be things that you're looking at and if there's just a slight little bit of reason the slight little bit of doubt he can't work upon that but when he can just come into this place to where you can just take god at his word and really settle it i mean speak it out that i doubt my doubts i i'm nothing without you lord i i can't lord i need your strength lord i need your work of grace in my life almighty god amen as a believer inviting his presence you can't figure this out one thing that i should do the greatest thing you can do is throw yourself into the arms of the living god brother braham said he had believers the old crop had died off the unbelievers who said we can't take it he let every one of them perish every one of them but the believers who was left moses had been taken to glory and the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness and this was their children there were only two that crossed over and that was the believers joshua and caleb and i was talking about from that original group they was the believers they was the one who crossed over i want you to watch how he says this it's the only way god can do it is by his believing children his believers was the one that done it he used them to cross over how did god cross over cross over in the fulfillment of his word he used believers to cross over him oh glory so what were the believers it was the word made manifest it was the word finding a place in the heart of the believer that was opening the way into the land of promise because what good would it do for god to go in the promised land without his people but you see god has ordained that going into that of the land the promises would be made manifest through the lives of his children oh my oh it's god coming down and dwelling in the hearts and lives of his people he used them to cross over with now he says he does it the same way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers and in order to have believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age now i realize when we talk about when we're looking at this notice he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age it just everything it shows there is nothing by chance with god right god predestinated god predestinated just as much as mary would be there at that time she was a predestinated ordained channel for isaiah 9 6 and isaiah 7 14 to be fulfilled through nothing made her a greater candidate though she maybe went to sunday school let's say she was there at sunday school she memorized all the scriptures one good but that is not predestination predestination takes it away from any human merit the bible says in romans chapter 9 that before jacob or esau either had done anything god said jacob have i loved esau have i hated why because we're talking about an almighty god who can see the end from the beginning and know what our attitude and our response would be to the word oh my predestinated for this moment there was millions as they stood there and they rejected to go over into the promised land but god knew there were two joshua and caleb that they would be those that he would cross over him god would take their lives simply because they believed him and you know what belief has to come from it's trust and you know how you get trust by love faith worketh by love he's got to predestinate this thing to be here to meet the challenge of the age let me go on he said oh brother brown said did you get that did you feel it did you see it did you understand it that's what's happening today he's predestinated it to this by four knowledge when he predestinated in malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and predestinates anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so and when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there at that time he predestinated a bride she's going to be there going to be a rapture she's going to be there he predestinated it by his foreknowledge there's nothing somebody say this with me nothing going to stop it god's predestinated it nothing's going to stop it i'll tell you what those ought to be some words that we put up on our phone or tag up on our our refrigerator or tag up on your mirror when you get discouraged this is something you ought to say nothing's going to stop it god's word cannot fail brother samuel i see this going this way i see so and so going this way nothing can stop god's word from coming to pass that's where the question listen don't get your eyes off remember remember there were people who got their eyes where the church started going over the hill they got their eyes off of looking unto jesus are you hearing me now you see it wasn't a big group that went into the land it was believers and believers are not made believers by believers believers are believers and they've been believers all along are you with me the holy ghost doesn't make you a believer you are already a believer but the holy ghost raises up that seed on the inside that's why there's got to be a new birth a new creation on the inside then it is a work of almighty god on the inside god predestinated it amen when we came here we dropped from our mother's womb that seed was there within us amen it's an ordained channel of god so let me just say it in this way because there's nothing going to stop it you know this is why brother branham you know him talk he was talking to a group of people in the message of thy house when he was preaching in georgia and they had some different ones i asked him brother brown if you believe the coming of the lord is so close how in the world can you go off and fish and hunt like this you seems like you ought to be going like a house on fire brother bram said i've come to realize there's only so many names on that book and he said you know what there's one that's that's who's going to be there and god it wasn't brother brown became likes about it but what brother brown was saying is is that there's to listen that i'm not going to make anybody else make it that isn't ordained to make it are you hearing me now but the one thing that we want to do is encouraging life sure we want to encourage hearts we've got loved ones but let's encourage the believers that are moving on into the promises of god i want to encourage every heart that if there's a life that has not made us stand yet that they'll make a stand on the word of god that the holy spirit would strike their hearts and strike their lives but the proving grounds of god's word is channels that god's ordained to receive the lord remember there were four kinds of ground right the seed that went out some was on stony ground right some some came up there was thorns and thistles that came up choked it out but there was one that was called good ground and brother branham over and over works as faith express then in the message the rapture he says that is free prepared ground god he said ordained you to receive him in this generation so the recognizing of god is by a part within you just like inside of your cell phone there's something to recognize when i punch in numbers and call you it don't go to somebody else it goes to your phone are you with me that's how when the word comes by it's already dialed into the word the word already has your name wrote into it the word already has that part of what you've been longing for what you've been searching for that other part that comes together you're the vessel that god will prove himself through the believers the instrument that god performs his paradox through god think about it in your life in my life our lives are those things are is that which god proves he's still a deliverer god proves he's still a healer i don't want to get sick nobody wants to get sick is that right nobody wants to have a disease but god will take those opportunities remember nothing can come our way unless god permitted and god will take situations that others would collapse others would walk away others say i'll tell you what i just can't do with this if god take this i'll serve him you never was there in the first place are you with me but god takes lives and he'll prove he's a healer he'll prove he's a deliverer he proves in this hour that he still feels with the holy ghost he's proving his word through believers is that right i would say it in this way we are ordained stones god has stones that are set forth as a testimony and a witness just as much as those stones had to be there in the jordan to be brought up we were ordained though covered over with sin and mock and everything but we were ordained as stones to be testimonies as memorials of god's grace say brother samuel what does this have to do with prayer everything in the world because you can stand as a memorial and say what whatsoever we ask in his name he said he'll do it he's still a healer he's still a deliverer he still feels with the holy ghost we're able to stand there upon the promises of god we've got an open communication with god ordained stones think about it like this remember when the pharisees i'm just gonna just move here just to capture all of this when it came john the baptist standing there on the river jordan baptizing think about it here he is standing on the river jordan where they had crossed when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them old generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham what's john taking them back to he's taken them back to that crossing of the jordan that god's able to raise up stones if you're not going to recognize him and yield to him god will raise up stones god will take lives that that you wouldn't even suspect but if you won't yield to him god's got some people that will yield to him i love how brother graham says it like this he said no matter what man thinks god's got a program and it's going to be fulfilled i don't care how many doubters rise i don't care how many websites i don't care god's word cannot fail god's word is being fulfilled no matter how much how many devils rise and whatever they want to say whatever they want to do but god's word cannot be stopped let me just say believers can't be stopped because it's not greater it's me it's greater is he that is in me [Applause] cancer might come upon some but he can but satan can't stop him diseases and everything else trials can come around but it can't stop a real believer they were a believer before the test they were a believer before the trial they're a believer in the test a believer in the trial and they'll be a believer afterwards hallelujah god will cross right through cancer right through them oh glory be to god it's going to be fulfilled oh my there there are testimonies remember that even when paul could write what if men what if some did not believe think about it when jesus was standing there it wasn't just him they didn't believe noah is that right in isaiah 53 says he is despised and rejected it was christ in noah that was rejected when they ran noah down they weren't running noah down they were running down jehovah when they ran down jeremiah they weren't running down jeremiah they were running down jehovah when they ran down moses they were running down jehovah are you hearing me now they couldn't recognize it and see it but it was god veiled in men is that right and that's always where man stumbles is man seeing beyond the veil of man are you hearing me you and i it's just like the veil that we have it's why it takes something greater than our veil of our human mind our human intellect our human spirit there's got to be a divine connection down there on the inside that we recognize it's god that's speaking to my heart it's god oh friends do you realize tonight if you can hear the voice of god you are the richest people on the face of the earth to be able to hear his voice his voice is not a kentuckian his voice was in that voice but that voice that was there is now in bright form glory be to god oh so what if some did not believe did that stop god god didn't say oh wait a minute they're not believing no there was an ordained remnant as a matter of fact there was a handful simeon anna there was just a few brother brown said that was god's church a handful it wasn't a big mega church in the message birth things brother ran brings it out it was a handful of people but they were waiting on the fulfillment of god's word and god came to him is that right they were ordained while the rest of them were rejecting but it didn't make god's word of none effect god had some vessels on earth that his word could have preeminence in think of this brother let me just pull from a few places he said god's able of these stones to raise children to abraham he said if the pentecostals he said they're not willing to take it on god he said will rise up out of the lutherans god arrives up from here he's pulling out stones he said god's able of these stones to rise children to abraham somebody's going to see the vision and take it on i'm talking about a living memorial of his presence oh glory think of this you might be feeling a little bit low you might be feeling me who am i look at all my weaknesses look at all my frailties look at all my failures look at all my mistakes what do i have to offer god but god listen to me now god placed within you what he needs and all it requires for us is to offer back to him what he's placed within us because the very thing that we look at and say it would disqualify but god looks down into our lives and says but the qualification is by my word i want you just to look at this a moment familiar scriptures but let me read it god in first corinthians 1 27 god had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise think about it god had a man by the name of peter he couldn't read his name on a boxcar and god would call him to preach the gospel he would be filled with the spirit of almighty god he would be given the keys unlocking that gospel there to the jews and to the gentiles and ignorant and unlearned men the bible said they took notice they were ignorant and unlearned is that right moses didn't believe he was qualified when he got in the presence of god i can't even talk straight lord i'm a man of a slow tongue but god chose him god didn't choose you or i because of our natural abilities god had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things which are weak things of the world and things which are despised have god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not those things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence it's god who raises up it's god who has raised us up it's not us but god remember god has provided you couldn't have been born in any other age is that right david said in one psalms 139 that my members were wrote in thy book before i ever was god told jeremiah i knew you before you were in your other mother's womb and i ordained you to be a prophet glory be to god this is not haphazard amen calvary was not a haphazard event where god came down and thinking well i wonder if somebody's gonna serve me or not he came as a redeemer and a redeemer is to redeem what belongs to one amen predestination opens up that it's god it's a program this is not a program that's just hanging out here in balance this is grounded firmly in god oh glory be to god think about that even thinking back back to the message brother jerry had preached about the plans that god has laid down for me the purposes and sometimes things in our life we can't figure out why did i go this channel or what i go this or what i do this and sometimes things that we look off and say well that was a waste but yet we don't understand everything but one thing that we can look at is to know that there is a purpose and a plan that god has for my life sometimes god has to get this going this way this going this way and get this going this way sometimes god has to let you make decisions and then bring you back to a starting point just to let you know that he cares about you he loves you and that you belong to him you might escape and might get away but you can never get away from the mind of god god raises up and god god takes what he wants to take god didn't have to ask anybody can i take moses god didn't ask anybody can i take mary god didn't have to ask anybody can i take a stephen god never had to ask anybody they were ordained channels for god to prove his word through god's got children brother brahm said he's still jehovah gyra he said if he's got to pull him from the streets he's got to take him from prostitutes he said god will raise up children because he's still jehovah gyra he said god has provided himself a message he's provided a messenger and god will provide the signs and wonders in his church think about that predestinated seed in john 6. think about it brother aaron here she was coming down to the well she went down just like normal any other day but little did she know that that day in that moment it was going to be a time where a stone was going to be raised oh my there was one who came down there to seek for her she was buried beneath all the darkness but down within her life there was an ordained channel to receive god let me tell you something her life where nobody would let her come around at the well when they were there but that channel in her life when she met the messiah the living word the guide that could take her from death to life the god oh he didn't have to hold a seminar on how to be a real lady she met him and the god took her from a life where she was at into a real place as a real woman whose testimony lives and rings throughout the gospel think about mary magdalene whom seven spirits were cast out she was an ordained channel that god would manifest his word through think about it brother shane when simon called him there at his house to make fun of him jesus kept that appointment at that place because he knew she was coming that appointment was not about simon that appointment was because he knew she was going to be there it was all divinely arranged glory be to god think about the woman caught in adultery oh my think about the situation that was there and how they brought her in there but little what a situation oh that could it seemed and it was so vile but right there in the midst of that situation she was able to receive the forgiveness of the word and rise up without one accuser the word dismantled every accusation that was against her what was it the living word moving down in the jordan to open up the way think about when paul was in corinth i'm coming down i wonder how much how paul no doubt was maybe he got discouraged when he was there because god had to tell paul paul i want you to stay right here because i've got much people in this city they don't know they're my people but i know them they don't know they're my stones but i know them i've got them right here in this city they're covered over oh they're some of them thieves and everything let me just read it first corinthians 6 9 know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators idolaters or adulterers effeminate you know that means sissies nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you glory be to god stones that have been raised up but ye are washed you are sanctified you are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god no wonder paul could speak to the ephesians as they were coming into their land and you hath he quickened who were dead in sin and trespasses walked according to the prince of power of the air carried about with all sorts of things think about in this age when god had people who could stand and look at the message the word that god was vindicated and would make a statement and say i wouldn't have nothing to do with that or i wouldn't feed that religion to my cow think of that where people could say well brother brown is a prophet when the anointing's upon him and the signs and wonders but don't you listen to his teaching and don't realize that the signs and wonders were only to confirm the word it was to confirm the word it's the voice of god that we have been brought in contact with a man to hear the voice of almighty god speaking to our lives think about it brother branham would say like this he said god's able to rise up stones he said if people won't receive it he said god will raise up apostle and bring opossum in if people won't receive it god will bring up god will raise up a little fishy let me tell you something that's a powerful powerful testimony right there amen you think think of that of that possum where it was a situation think of it now that brother branham was instructed put it out of its mind it won't make it it'll never survive it was rolled off but nothing is beyond almighty god he's able to rise up stones that little fishy when brother dave said there in the boat he said i guess you shot your last wad but god raised up that little fishing its intrus was pulled out it was a situation and look it's beyond hope just write it off but not to god not to god let me tell you something your situation is not beyond god there is nothing beyond god your loved ones it's not beyond god your children it's not beyond god i don't care what they're tangled up in it's not beyond god brother samuel you don't know what they might have said but think of what brother branham could say in the message paradox he said you can take somebody consent in a meeting tonight and criticize the working of what's going on but you let god get a hold of their life he said he'll take him from a critic to a believer what is that the sovereignty and the grace of almighty god i'm telling you we're believers there's nothing impossible with god nothing impossible with god and as a believer there's nothing impossible with you when god's word requires it he raises up what's needed to meet that challenge think about a memorial you know as we as i close here many memorials that could be built and there are sometimes we go and we see different memorials and sometimes those memorials are nice to see just reminders and things that we can have in this nation and different things like that even of times you know in the past few years when i've been able to go down into jeffersonville and the places and they've taken me around i've really enjoyed just looking back and different memorials of places and just standing there and and just kind of beholding you know there's not really i we would say markers and things like that but you know man will always raise up a memorial to something that you can go and look at and and you know within that memorial though if there's not something that's really eternal behind it it's only something of this life but you know i think of it in this way brother brown would take the example of of elisha when that axe head flew off of that that stick when they those prophets went to build a memorial they were going to build a school and it fell off into the water and they came and asked elisha they said elisha we need help we got to recover this axe head now that's impossible for an axe head to come up out of the water right i mean you brothers that are fishermen you know in order to get sometimes the bait down in the water you got to put sinkers on it to get it to go down to where you want it certain levels but to think of an axe head where elisha would say give me the stick and he would place that stick much we could speak about that but that axe head rose up brother brahem said what elisha chose to do rather than more erect a memorial out here he chose a greater memorial where there would be something that was beneath the water something that was dead and it would be raised back into position back to its purpose and this is what god when he takes a life and god raises that life from beneath the muck the gum everything of this world in this earth and from sin and you know what your life becomes a memorial it becomes a testimony it doesn't mean that everything's always went your way it doesn't mean that our lives are free from tests and trials as a matter of fact the test and trials is what really proves and shows a memorial because the tests and trials is what proves whether the gold is real or not is that right because if something can't be tested then it really can't be trusted but a real remor memorial is something that it can stand there and when everything is said and done when it's all finished there's a memorial that can stand as a testimony not only now but it stands as this is a real believer not that everything is just fine and dandy but you know what in everything god is first are you hearing me now that that in no matter tests and trials you think about this week you can see lives and knowing that there's lives that have gone through tests and trials and things come our way things that you you cannot even explain but a memorial is one that can stand there as a testimony and you know what a more memorial does just as much as if you would go into those areas where they have memorials and it points to you know george washington crossing the valley forge and all those different things that delaware all those things like that it'll point to an event that's the same way a memorial does in our life it points to a living christ a living event so that when your children say what mean these stones you can say it's god what god did for me he's the same god for you he's the same yesterday today and forever it's a living memorial of the presence of almighty god oh my let's just pray heavenly father lord jesus nothing lord that could be greater than a memorial that god that you would raise up lord out of lives and hearts oh god to be a testimony in this hour to be a witness oh god and that you would prove your word through lord god father when we think about lord in just the simplicity of it oh god that lord it's not us lord but it's you within us lord i pray god tonight lord if there is lord one life or one heart lord that that doesn't know you lord in that way maybe they've lord just had their ups and downs and ins and outs and it's just been something lord that maybe they've just been associated around but god when tests or trials or things has come it's just taking them under lord i pray tonight god may they recognize that there is a there's a living reality of a living god that can make a living memorial by his presence your presence in their life grant that tonight oh god [Music] lord lives in hearts oh god maybe the lord is facing lord in a test or a trial and praying seeking your face lord maybe there's been a trap lord that they've come into god may you give him the grace and the humility to recognize that and to lord bring that before you and say god you're still my waymaker i know that lord that you won't just pick me up out of this but would you lead me out oh god [Music] father you know that need tonight lord maybe lord physically something that someone is facing lord may you make yourself known tonight as the waymaker lord for their life oh god when we think of this i lord as i've looked at this in the scriptures lord and just just considering it over and over this place where they these stones are pitched it's the place called gilgal lord and i look at that through the scripture every everything would center right around gilgal joshua would be camped right around gilda orders would come out from gilgal when the kingdom needed to be renewed they came to gilgal gilgal was a very important place lord father tonight when there are needs that arise in our lives we can go and look at some things that lord it seems impossible maybe it's lord children that are before us loved ones there's situations it seems like lord i just don't know how this is going to be may we go back lord god has a stone of the living god to realize that the same god who made a way for us is the same god to make a way for our children same god to make a way for our spouse the same god to make a way for our loved ones the same god and he'll do it by his word he'll perform it through lives and through hearts [Music] oh god granted tonight lord [Music] for those every need may you show yourself lord strong on the behalf of your children i pray [Music] oh how we thank you lord tonight that you're still the waymaker you're still the god who opens doors you're still the god oh father who moves the mountains you're still the god who raises up lord granted lord we pray in the name of jesus christ [Music] oh glory be to god oh we've got a living memorial a living memorial hallelujah [Music] yes lord you only know oh if you'd like to stand in worship i'm [Music] glad of love [Music] a hopeless case [Music] in an empty place [Music] if not for grace [Music] know [Music] i'm glad you see oh yes through eyes of love an empty place [Music] [Music] and lord i thank you for the things i cannot see [Music] a shield surrounding me and i thank you for the mercy you provided [Music] yes lord cause i know you could have walked away but you stayed a thousand times [Music] [Applause] how sweet the sound oh hallelujah i once was lost [Applause] [Music] an empty place not for grace [Music] [Music] a hopeless case [Music] and lord i thank you for the things i cannot see [Music] yes lord you [Music] yes lord that shield surrounding me hallelujah and i thank you for [Music] but you stayed [Music] [Applause] amazing grace [Music] oh [Music] case [Music] an empty place if not for bread
