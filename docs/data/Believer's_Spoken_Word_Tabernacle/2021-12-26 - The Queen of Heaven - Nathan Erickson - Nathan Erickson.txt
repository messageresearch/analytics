i know some some unexpected things came up and uh we're gonna miss brother samuel being here today but just happy that we can be of a help and i hope that's all what we always can be is a help to our brother samuel and a support we sure believe in this ministry and this church and appreciate the friendship and the relationship that we've shared over the years we want to say god bless you i hope you had a wonderful merry christmas with your family and are enjoying this holiday season a little bit of a break amen and we just love you in the lord god bless you let's go to the word of god in esther the fourth chapter amen and uh i got a little thought here i just been studying on and preaching on at home and been really enjoying this it's quite a lot to bring out so i just trust the lord will give utterance and uh and put it together just the way he wants it this morning but i've been preaching on on the queen of heaven my title tonight the queen of heaven quite an unusual uh phrase but i've just been blessed by this study so esther chapter 4 and verse 11 i this is one of my favorite moments of the stories of the bible i think it's quite dramatic it's quite striking has a very relevant meaning for our day and for our for our own relationship with the lord and the ministry of this bride in esther 4 verse 11. this is her words all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whomsoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king in the inner court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but i have not been called to come into the king these thirty days and they told the mordecai esther's words then mordecai commanded of course you know the background of this story we're well acquainted with the story of esther mordecai replied there's a persecution coming for her people and so mordecai replies to her says think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the jews for if thou holdest thy peace at this time then shall there be enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou in thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this for such a time as this esther made them return this answer go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast for me and neither eat or drink three days night or day i also and my mains will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish if i perish i perish let the desperation that moment just settle in this morning amen and then uh to to continue laying a foundation here let's take a reading from luke chapter one a little bit of a christmas passage here it's not a i don't have a christmas sermon this morning per se but this goes right along with the thought and i've been blessed by this reading in luke chapter 1 and we'll read the 30th to the 38th verses and the angel said unto mary fear not for thou has found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus he shall be great and called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end and mary said on the angel how how shall this be seeing i know not a man the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her amen let's have a word of prayer lord it's a privilege this morning father to stand before this august body of believers father the elect lady of this hour lord lord maybe the world does not appreciate your children for what they are but father by the revelation this message lord we understand what a great honor it is just to rub shoulders with the royalty of god i pray father that your word would just come lord and be precious to us this morning father may your holy ghost just come lord it may it not be in just another service father and may we not be distracted by all the goings-on of this holiday time but father may we put you at the center of it all for a few moments lord and have fellowship with you that you could unfold to us something precious from your word lord that would edify us and be of eternal value to us lord for our we love you lord our heart is unto you our our devotion and our desire is for you lord and we we dedicate ourselves to you in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you as you're seated this morning amen this scripture just so reminded me did i give the testimony here at this church yet about my wife and i and i i didn't think so because i think it was too early on last time i was here but uh speaking of elizabeth's womb there and just to uh give share a little testimony what the lord is doing in our life we had a we had an experience my wife and i earlier this year sometime in the spring i think with a um with a specialist a fertility specialist and we were told that that the little girl that we have was basically statistically a miracle and that we were never going to be able to bring forth children and if we were to have if we were to able to conceive again that uh that we would just miscarry again we've had four miscarriages some quite traumatic so uh so you know that uh to to be honest with you that would have been quite all right with me that report because we have our little girl and she's my whole world and if i if i never had another child you know i would be content of course with my my little miracle but uh but the problem was that just two days prior to that i had been sitting in service at home on a on a sunday morning and and this is the way it goes sometimes with the lord if you're not careful you come with the wrong expectation and you're not listening with spiritual ears but the pastor was ministering and he was he was trying to remember a testimony brother ray was trying to recall the details of a testimony and to anybody who wasn't maybe in tune with it it might have seemed like the most human part of the service and you wouldn't have maybe called it anointed because he was stumbling at this time and trying to remember the details you know how it is sometimes and just off the cuff and trying to come up with the details but he was telling a testimony of a woman who uh who had actually had a full hysterectomy and miraculously was able to have a child after that fact and so you know it may not have seemed like a powerful part of the service but the lord just spoke to me right there and um and and it was just quite unexpected but the lord spoke to me and and the way that i've described it to to a lot of people was that uh you know it wasn't like a thus saith the lord but you know when something just quickens your heart faith quickens in your heart you want it you just lay hold of something and you say i'm believing for this and so i i had in my heart i'm believing uh i'm believing that i'm gonna have a son with my wife and so that was the report so you know uh so uh that i so we had a bad report from the from the uh from medicine and and uh they told us that it would have to be art some sort of artificial method is the only way we'd be able to conceive and it was prohibitively expensive and so we just laid it before the lord and said i don't know how it'll be but i just have to believe because of what the lord did for me there in the service i have to believe that we're going to have this child and so you know a few months later we were at some meetings down at brother nathan bryant's church and i might have shared a little bit of testimony of those meetings but there was a powerful prayer line on that saturday night brother wayne was speaking and that's when a woman got up and and testified that she had been in brother branham's meetings and in his prayer lines and she said tonight was just exactly the same the same atmosphere the same power and of course it is because it's the same god amen amen but brother brother wayne was preaching on being in position for a miracle and he actually gave the testimony of his son and his daughter uh we're in the exact same situation as as us and my wife and sister ann are very close but the lord allowed them to have a little baby and so you know just faith was being built and it came down to the prayer line and and uh and you know i i i'm believing for for a child but uh but you know not pushing anything because you sisters and your brothers that are married and been through this you understand how traumatic it is to you know to to miscarry to lose a child like that and so so i just said lord whatever it is whatever the timing is you work on my wife and and just work on both ends and it's just laying before the lord that's how you have to do it sometimes say man so so uh so just almost to the end of the prayer line my wife came up to in the prayer line and and i didn't really know what she was going for actually she she went up for something different her side of the testimony is quite amazing as well that she had something different on her heart came up in the testimony but when she got there she just broke down she said we're here we want a child we want a baby and so so we just stood there we had a we had it was you know the spirit of lord just came and and blessed it and uh and then after the service was over i went into the office with brother wayne and the holy spirit came again i just crying and weeping i said i knew this was the day i knew this was the day so we just held it before the lord i don't know when i don't know how but i just know where this is going to be fulfilled and so a few months later it was actually the week before our youth camp uh when we had all that going on she tested positive and so we had a baby of course you know it's hard you've been through this several times you've conceived and lost and conceived and lost you know but we just uh we just we're holding faith and so we got to the eight week appointment and uh everything was just right that's where one of them we hadn't had a heartbeat but so we got to that eight week appointment it was a it was you know as tense and and it was uh suspenseful and uh but the but the the measurement of the baby and the heartbeat of the baby were to the number exactly right exactly right ten weeks exactly right amen and we're we're well on now in the in toward the end of the second trimester i think and and due in april and we've had the gender reveal and it's a lovely little girl amen isn't that the way the lord does us sometimes but but you know what i don't know what that means amen but i know it's a blessing from the lord i know it's a miracle and so i just wanted to give that testimony before we go to the word amen amen might mean we got to have another one get that boy amen but my wouldn't we be content just with what the lord's done for us thus far amen more than we deserve amen but so to turning to this thought on the queen of heaven you know we read the scriptures here of a couple of significant women in the bible and and i think there's actually a a it's a little bit difficult to see without some expounding on it but there's actually a connection i believe between these two scriptures that we've read and between these two stories about the queen of heaven and of course this is an unusual phrase that we don't we don't say it a lot we don't hear it a lot uh uh preached on or spoken of and and actually if you take the phrase queen of heaven and you run that through the bible and search search through the words of the bible you'll find that that it's only spoken in the bible in a negative context there's a lot of quite a few scriptures that mention a queen of heaven but that queen of heaven that it's talking about is a pagan worship of mesopotamian lands where uh and actually the whole book of jeremiah one of the major parts of his ministry is rebuking this worship of the queen of heaven because they made the queen of heaven was was uh uh it was ishtar or astardase it was a a goddess of the eastern religion of the of mesopotamia there and so they had it wasn't just the the real problem with their paganism was not that they had left the worship of god uh but that they had combined the worship of god yahweh the father amen and then they had invented this figure of yahweh's wife or the queen yahweh's queen a man a male god and a female god a god and a goddess and so and and that was uh and that was god you find in the bible will not suffer this god doesn't allow this kind of worship to happen he doesn't he rebukes it very strongly that there's not to be you know because god is not to be worshipped and like you know a male god and a female god god is not two god is not three god is one god he's amen he's one he's one person he's one power he's one spirit he's one one lord and one father of us all uh everything that is all life came from the fountain of the one god the the one true and living god and that is yahweh so there's no duality to god there's no multiplicity to god amen there's only one god amen but we find that there is in this pagan worship there there there they're fascinated with all these different aspects of male and female and things and so and so it turned into a paganism and we know that it didn't stay pagan amen but it crept into the christian religion and we we know the history of the church how these things came into the catholic church early on through roman paganism and that's why today it's actually a pagan thing that the catholics speak about mary the mother of jesus they call her the queen of heaven that's their that's their appellate for her that's her title that's her that's her position in the catholic doctrine that mary is the queen of heaven that jesus is the king and mary is the queen and that's that's their they they call her that now brother branham said some of you dear catholic people he said they met you make her a goddess a queen of heaven but it's not right he said it's it's not she was a good woman yes sir but she was no more than any other woman that god chooses to use amen now can you imagine that now what a teaching amen what a teaching brother bran is bringing she was no more than any other woman that god chooses to use he said he can use a woman for something else now now isn't that amazing because you know of all the women ever born in this world of all the billions of of of women that have lived over the over the eons and the centuries there's only one woman amen who found favor with god only one woman who was elected and chosen amen and put in the in the right season and put in the right city in the right place in the right circumstances there's only one woman who was visited by the angel gabriel only one woman who brought forth from her womb the lord jesus christ amen amen and yet brother branham is teaching you that that woman amen though she was a blessed woman and a favored woman in the economy of god she's no more than any other woman god chooses to use amen now we're foreshadowing something here she's no more than any other woman god chooses to use amen she he said he could she he can use a woman for something else now see but so so god is not allowing anyone to claim this title of queen of heaven it's it's it's it's it's forbidden it's not a a god god is rebuking it he's not allowing it because he's jealous over that title he has never allowed no woman there is no woman there is no church there is no religion there is no system there is no nation there is nobody who has ever been allowed to be called the queen of heaven nobody has a right to that nobody it's been forbidden amen through the ages to any church or woman or people amen this this this uh this this status of the queen of heaven and yet you find that it speaks in the bible of the lamb's bride amen that the lamb would have a bride amen it's spoken of the bible the lamb would have a bride amen and and so you know uh i i just want us to to enter into this now this morning because those of us that have been raised around the message and we're familiar with message teachings you know we we very much take it for granted what we know about the bride of jesus christ but that even that title even that even that that revelation of of the of of the true bride of jesus christ is something that's a mystery to many people it's uh all the different denominations have different ideas about it the mormons believe there's a mother god and a father god and justice pagan as the rest and you know different churches that they they have different ideas about who that bride is amen and yet see we have been identified by a message and we have received a revelation which is allowing us to see something very beautiful here amen amen i got to tell you a funny little story about when i was a little boy i was sitting in church with one of my cousins we were sitting next to grandma you know like you do when you're a little boy maybe six seven eight years old and grandpa was just preaching away and preaching a good sermon on the bride of jesus christ and my little cousin piped up and he said the bride the bride it's always about the bride amen but you know a little child has no understanding but when we become c's in the word we find out it's all about the bride amen this message is all about who you are what you've been called for what you've been positioning a place to do in this world amen there is the lamb's bride and notice what a prophet is going to tell you who that bride is and he's going to identify you and he's talking about here in the first seal about the throne of judgment he says notice the rest of the dead are going to come forth and this is the white throne and they're going to stand before the bride that's right stand before the king and the queen amen glory said there is a church today rebuking the catholics here that calls herself the queen of heaven here's what brother brahm said the queen of heaven is the selected bride of jesus christ and she comes with him friends i didn't make that up i didn't say that about you but vindication amen a god sent message a prophet of our day stood on the face of the earth and has identified you amen not as a lowly servant but as the very queen of heaven the bride of jesus christ amen a royal seed amen one with our king hallelujah and she comes with him friends you say well that's way out of reach brother nathan when you're talking about something that that just doesn't feel comfortable it doesn't strike me right to to to to claim a title like that of the queen of heaven but friends amen it's not out of reach to say it you are the queen of heaven amen vindication has uttered it amen over this bride he said i no longer call you church i call you bride you are the lamb's wife you are the queen of heaven amen you'll judge the world whole friends you say well brother anything but what have we done or or who who who would i be to be called the queen of heaven it is not what you have done it is not what any man or woman has done or who you are amen it is the election of god that let you represent amen recognize the message for your day amen the grace of god that chose you for this amen you didn't ascend to this title but god threw a message amen has laid this title on you amen when he took you to be no longer a church but to be his bride then all of his royalty was transferred to you glory be to god oh brother bran said didn't jesus say the queen of now this is typing this bride he's preaching on this bride he said didn't jesus say the queen of the south shall rise and condemn this generation he's preaching about the queen of sheba amen how the bible says she would come up in the last judgment and that the queen of sheba would stand there and have to rebuke the generation for rejecting the word of god amen and he said and they were blind and they missed him because they were looking for him but he comes so simple they went right over the top of it amen amen oh friends you know what you you know how this message is we're acquainted with this message in its simplicity it's so humble it's so it's so simple until the world has completely missed the word that is stricken you amen and yet some grace has allowed your eyes to be open amen to the glory of this word amen what a what a what a what a work of grace amen how wonderful amen to think that just like solomon amen solomon had a gift of wisdom he's bringing the forth the word amen and people came from everywhere to hear solomon oh yeah they came from the east and west to sit at the feasts and the and to hear the words of wisdom and to see all the splendor of of solomon's palace and solomon's temple and all of his riches and all those things and then they went their way amen they came they saw and they left amen but the queen amen the queen of sheba when she came there was something it wasn't the riches that it wasn't the the wonder though that's not what impressed her but there was something in solomon's words that touch your heart amen hallelujah what was it it was election friends amen because as sure and as certain as god had king solomon in mind he had king solomon's queen in mind hallelujah so he could not exist without her and she would have to receive his word and she would have to be there amen that's a picture of you friends you're that great queen that brother bram said humbled herself and came and accepted the message and she'll stand in the judgment and condemn that generation friends this message came so simple that the world missed but it was a greater than solomon was here jesus christ himself through a ministry is revealing himself to the world and the world rejected it friends but i tell you what greater than sheba is here because the bride of jesus christ is in her ascendancy amen and she has come under the message it's identified her royalty and it has espoused her to the lamb of god glory be to god hallelujah oh there's something about the bride of christ when she hears this word it just quickens something on the inside you know how it was for you it wasn't just a you know when you came the first time it wasn't the church that impressed you it wasn't the building it wasn't the you know the wonderful singing and the wonderful music and good preaching and all those things are wonderful but that's not what caught your attention but there was something when the word went forth amen it touched amen it touched something in the on the inside you said i belong to this i don't i may not understand it all i may not see it all yet but there's something in my heart saying this is me this is where i belong this is my message this is my cause this is my husband hallelujah glory be to god amen just like the woman at the well it was the word that touches the word that gripped her brother brahm said her sins were forgiven because she was redeemable she was redeemable now isn't that a wonderful word she was redeemable now what made her redeemable brother bram said because she was in god's thinking at the beginning it wasn't her works friend she was a sinner a prostitute she didn't have any reputation she didn't have any wealth she didn't have any honor she had nothing to offer amen but yet jesus didn't come to the pharisees he didn't go to the high priest he went to the well where a thirsty woman was drawing because she was redeemable because he saw her before the foundation of the world amen oh hallelujah amen she was in god's thinking at the beginning so brother graham said it redeemed her or brought her back when she seen the express scripture manifested why is it brother sister that you recognize your day and its message why is it that this world rejected it but there's something about you you would never give it away it's not for sale it's not up for debate it's not up for compromise it's our word it's our everything it's our lord hallelujah we're gonna stand with it we're gonna cling to it hold fast even more as we see the day approaching oh friends because it's a love affair it's a it's an election it's a choosing you didn't join this this chose you amen you didn't put your name on the book and join the church and shake the pastor's hand amen but jesus christ came and took whatever human vessel it was and uttered the words of life to you and it quickened something on the inside here set your heart on fire and burst a new life in you glory be to god what is it it's election friends are greater than sheba a greater than shiva is here oh to think to think of it you know that every country every people doesn't matter what it was everybody has every every group that's ever existed has had the same belief that we are the people you are you take different languages you know and they're words for themselves like like german or dutch or whatever it is when you take it all the way back to the original it just means people because everybody sees themselves that way we are the people and then there's the other people but and then there's everyone else but we're the people amen now that's that's true if it's a nation if it's a church if it's a football team it doesn't matter any group of human beings will have that idea we are the people amen but to think of this bride amen has come from the east and the west the bible says she's of every nation and tongue she's not a group she's misfits and outcasts and people that were rejected and kicked out of churches and amen and persecuted for the sake of the word but by the grace of god not because of who we are but by the grace of god we are the people the lamb's bride the queen of heaven hallelujah that's not making something to yourself amen but that's god's grace to you and to me amen to make us the people hallelujah the chosen people it's not our ability it's not our amen can we take a little example from history this morning i'm kind of a history buff and i i like to i like to think along these lines but the other day i was thinking about queen elizabeth back in uh back in the the early days of the kingdom of england and this was just at the time you know she was a remarkable figure in history actually because she was a she was a woman as a small child uh her her family was protestant but her she had an aunt uh who was catholic who persecuted the protestant church in in the in england and that that's the one that's called bloody mary the queen of scots and so her aunt when she was very young locked her away in a tower amen it looked like looked like she would just spend the rest of her life there amen but but things just worked around amen until she ended up becoming the queen and she never actually got she never actually got married so at that time for like the first time there wasn't a king of england it was just the queen there was no there was no king there the queen was the one that was present she had the rulership and so that makes her a remarkable figure in history and so at that time though there was a great turmoil because because uh uh because of the uh uh the the wars going on between catholics and protestants and the greatest empire of the time was the spanish empire which was catholic and they were so they were incredibly rich from american gold and and there and so the king of spain is sending his armada just that like the thousands hundreds of ships the greatest ships the world had ever seen the the latest technology biggest like the big great big they called them floating castles with cannons on them and he was sending his armada up there to take elizabeth off the throne and and and bring the inquisition amen to the shores of england amen and shut down the protestant uh movement basically permanently in england now now we all know about the the british empire you know the famous british empire and one of the greatest of the imperial age and they had the saying that the sun never set on the british empire didn't matter where you were in the world where the sun was it might be night in england but somewhere the sun is shining on british soil amen but it didn't start like that when it started out it was very small it was an underdog it didn't have military might it didn't even have a stable government because all you had was the queen and that's where that battle cry came from god save the queen god save the queen amen amen and and you know this is what's amazing to me because this period of history has been very romanticized but there really is nothing special nothing that special about elizabeth's core about her government it had all the same politics it had all the same corruption it had all the same intrigue and things and going around it didn't have a lot of wealth it didn't have a lot of power it didn't have a lot of anything all it had was a queen amen amen and but what made the difference there friends amen when you think about what makes a difference it wasn't any woman it wasn't any government it wasn't any people but it was this fact amen that the light of luther was burning on amen in queen elizabeth's dynasty amen they are the the kings and queens of that dynasty of that lineage were carrying on luther's light amen until one day that light was going to burn forth on their on their soil a wesley who would take the message of of sanctification across the world and eventually amen that that same kingdom that she was ruling over amen was going to plant on a new continent the seeds of the greatest christian revival ever to strike the face of the earth amen so oh that's why god saved the queen amen amen you know that actually at her time she was rubbing shoulders with the very same scholars who would write the king james bible that's why god saved the queen amen not because she was a great queen amen not because she was a great person but because god moves the governments and the powers of the earth to protect his word and because she was attached to his word god saved the queen and so when her aunt locked her in a tower amen for life god saved the queen amen when people tried to depose her because they didn't want a woman to be ruling amen god saved the queen he had a purpose in saving the queen and when that spanish armada floated up the english channel to bring the inquisition to her shores amen she stood there on the shore with her people and she said here i am she said i've got the she stood before her her navy and she said here i am i've got the frail body of a woman but i've got the heart of a king amen and so and so when her navy went forth god saved the queen hallelujah and the armada was sunk and the british empire began that day and you know how god saved the queen is that though when those great spanish ships came rolling in as i've read somewhere amen that her boats were so little amen that the span great spanish galleons fired right over the top of them amen it was all her own humility is what saved the queen that's how god saves his queen france that's how god saves you when you're up against a trial amen when your great enemy comes to destroy you amen he's great but you're small i love you and it's the very greatness of the devil that's his undoing amen because his world can never recognize god's queen hallelujah he may hate it he doesn't want it he doesn't want this bride to be on this earth in the position that she's in having the power that she has but god saves the queen god saves the queen hey man you like that hallelujah oh we're nothing in the eyes of the world but we're carrying a seed on the inside and it's because of that word seed that's in you not because of your merit that you're saved it's because you're attached to the word so when you deserve death in hell god save the queen amen whatever you're going through that threatens to destroy your very life god saves the queen because of that because of that word because of that seed on the inside no matter what you're going through i say god save the queen amen amen see so friends why is it we get so worried then about all the waves of this world and the warfares and always worried we there's christians spending all their time worried that they're gonna sink you're not gonna sing god's gonna save you from that storm those waves cannot sink you why because not because of you or your ability but because there's a seed on the inside that god won't let go of god saves the queen he protects the seed so the word can go forth hallelujah he sure does it then why are we worried about trying to make waves in this world we're not of this world we're of another kingdom we're of another realm oh friends i like the way brother graham said it in a prisoner might have read it here before he's praying he says may we remember in our minds as we walk down the street and rub arms with the world we're not supposed to be like them we're not supposed to be like them but actually now he said now look where where where the prophet's placing you amen because people people want to take this power and authority and try to make some great ministry out of it build some big church and everybody look at us look away no that's not this bride brother ram said the bride he said we step aside and give them place amen he said we in their rightful position here on earth we'll take the back seat knowing that we have a kingdom that's coming into power hallelujah friends all will you take the back seat for you know that's why there's so many to so many people are are worried and and there's so much turmoil in the world today about about you know the injustices of the world and and and and and the poverty you know the rich people doing whatever they do and and hoarding power and manipulating things and everybody there's so much turmoil in this world but for the bride we're not part of all that nonsense let them do that's their right to play that game to do what they want to do whatever they're going to do they're going to do but the bride has a seated amen she's part of another kingdom and when all this passes away you may not have all the wealth on this side you may not have all the experiences here you may never be as somebody in this world amen but you're somebody to god more than a servant more than a sinner even more than a son you are his spouse you are the bride of jesus christ you are the queen of heaven if you have a kingdom that's coming into power you're delegates from another world if you're trying to make this message into something that'll glorify yourself friends you'll never get anywhere with it but when you can see it for what it is and recognize the grace of god to let you see this message and join yourself to the to the throne of the rejected king then you won't worry if the world rejects you if you don't fit in if you don't dress like them or act like them if you're persecuted by them it doesn't matter you've seen the king you've beheld his throne you're like isaiah amen who entered into his presence amen was overcome by his glory and he said i saw the lord hallelujah when the world didn't see it the kings didn't see it the popes and the priests and the pulpits didn't see it but i saw the lord and he was a rejected king but he was glorious he was high and lifted up and his train filled the temple hallelujah amen the people on the thrones of this world can't see him but you have gathered before his throne amen and we can see his glory and we can feel his presence as that train of glory swirls about the building as the holy ghost moves over his people what is it it's god amen entertaining his queen and the queen entertaining her god her king hallelujah that's our ministry brother brown said to minister to him as his wife as his bride amen he'll give up every worldly thing to be that amen it'll take everything to be his bride he said you must be part of him not part of the creed not part of the church not part of the denomination but part of him any kind of other kind of form won't work you've got to be hewed from the word and the world cut off you and just the word only living in you friends you see what it is she is him it's not a duality it's not a it's not a father god and a mother god it's not a king and a queen or a god and a goddess it's one god amen but but thanks be to god amen but we've heard from our theophany and we know that you and i are part of that one god that one life that one spirit that won baptism amen we've been joined with him the world has been cut off and now we're just as royal as he is royal because we are him he became me that i might become him by grace glory you see the you see this revelation friends that's what we sacrifice for that's what we that's what we live for it's not rules and regulations it's not legalism and do's and don'ts friends we don't want to dress like the world we don't want to be like the world i want to be his queen hallelujah that's my identity that's my passion that's the burning desire of my heart is to be that what this message called me to be hallelujah just like ruth ruth my she had a family back in moab in moab she was a somebody she was a priestess she had nobility she had a family she probably had wealth but there was something in her heart that wasn't satisfied with where she was at there was something driving her something maybe she didn't even understand it you ever think of that she may have not even known what she was saying but something was driving her to go be part of that judah line something's driving her to judah until the point where uh until the point where it was it was where you go i'll go wherever you stay uh look look your god is gonna be my god where you die that's where i die hallelujah why because she is something election grace god's foreknowledge is driving her to be part of that judah line to bring forth the promised son amen because she had to be a part of it even though she was following a false religion amen when when god found her she was a moabitus she was a gentile she wasn't part of it seemed like not part of the promise we would have called her a sinner we would have called her somebody with no hope amen we would have called her somebody of this world who would never see this message but god turned something around because god wanted her to be a part of it and he wanted to place a seed in there that would bring forth one day the lord jesus christ right out of jesse's line absolutely friends that's the way it is for you and your lord amen brother bran said he was the fullness of the godhead bodily so you walked with him when he was on earth you suffered with him why because you were in that godhead so you suffered with him and you died with him you were buried with him and now you're risen with him and manifested attributes of god setting in heavenly places already raised already raised oh come on now already raised oh are we not in heavenly places in christ jesus amen you're already raised amen resurrected to new life and setting in heavenly places oh that means so much church it means so much to us to see ourself positionally placed in jesus christ amen now you you've heard you've heard message preachers teaching and preaching and pouring their heart out about how you must you must get past the church you must be able to see christ in this message that's what that means because when you see christ then you will see yourself amen positionally placed in christ amen and then whatever attributes you have of this flesh do not pertain to you you are one with him his righteousness is your righteousness his glory is your glory his royalty his power and his throne is yours your name on the check is just as good as his what a message friends oh hallelujah see but when you walked with him back then when you walked with him when you died with him when you were you were you nobody could see you and without this message you couldn't see you amen because you were a mystery you were hidden in him but that ministry had to be fulfilled just like just like just like eve had to come forth from adam for the mystery to be perfect for everything that was in god to be revealed amen his side had to be opened up amen pouring out amen the three attributes of a new birth to bring forth on this world on this earth a bride amen that he could draw on himself and have fellowship with you friends and so there is an appointed time for every thought that was in god for the beginning amen before the beginning every thought has to come forth in its appointed time friends now you may have been swirling around in god's mind i you may have swirled there a long time amen it might have been billions and billions of years and eons amen that you were just a little spark in the mind of god but you had to come forth laodicea amen amen could not could not satan couldn't wreck this world enough amen to prevent you from coming into your advent because you were a seed of god and as oh as long as there's been a king amen there's been a queen amen that's that's the bride see brother brahms said we must be that word bride and what is that word bride she's the manifestation of this hour now i'm going to major on this now amen you say well brother nathan i thought you know the manifestation this hour was prayer lines and and prophecies and brother met visions and god sent a prophet and all those things no the manifestation of this hour the work of god for today is the the bringing forth and the speaking into this world of the bride of jesus christ amen that's what you the the world is here for you the angels are here for you god is here for you heaven is here for you your theophany is here to take you home it's all for you friends that's the manifestation of this hour there is to be a spiritual bride raise up which will be a royal seed of abraham's royal son and she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise that's given to her amen another place he said we must be that word bride where i was just reading he said now see what we're that that bride is a living oracle displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride you see why you're here because god had things in him that were a mystery for the eons amen but you are here that those attributes that were once mysterious the attributes that he held within himself when he walked and when he healed amen when he delivered when he died and when he rose those attributes were in there but today they're not in there they've been spoken into this laodicean soil amen and the seed that was planted has blossomed forth into a bride body hallelujah and now we're displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the blood of the bride friends if you want to see the grace of god look at the bride you want to see the love of god look at the bride you want to see healing you want to see power you want to see miracles baptism of the holy ghost and deliverance look at the bride of jesus christ she's got it she is the attributes of god on display that's what you're called to be friends and the time and the place is a promise that's given her he said the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living this hour i no longer call you church i call you bride hey brand friends when you look at you see because we can see the picture when we look on the other side when you look across the millennial reign when you look at the white throne judgment look yeah sure look at the queen sitting there with him in his throne look at how splen look at her splendor look at her glory look at her power sitting there in the throne with him amen but that bride it's not just for that time and that place but this time and this place for the same bride there's a promise friends i just can't preach it like i feel it amen oh it's this time in this place see it's for such a time as this amen you might not have known it because you're like esther you know you didn't know why you were here you didn't know why you were born you didn't know why god sent you a prophet you don't know why you joined a certain church you didn't know why but this message can tell you why amen it can reveal it to you you were born for such a time as this no one else can take your place there's nobody else with the power with the with the with the uh there's nobody else with the sway on the king that you have it's your time it's your it's your time to be the queen friends we really there and esther god didn't make us through the queen just to pamper her this wasn't some prosperity gospel nonsense no but there was an appointed time an appointed place and an appointed purpose see what are we talking about the ministry of the bride on earth now see what is the ministry of that bride brother braham said one in a million i'm going to break it down here he said brother jesus supposed to according the scriptures returned to us in the last days in this type of ministry and that will be after the baptism of the spirit after the speaking in tongues after the divine healing he said what we're speaking of is the capping of the pentecostal message notice now see it's the capping of the pentecostal message he said and what is that capping is this ministry of the christ himself impersonated amongst his people amen with the very same things that he did when he was here on earth in his body the bride friends see it's more than just a pentecostal it's more than pentecostalism it's more than signs and wonders or miracles or speaking in tongues or dancing or shouting it was more than a tingle that went up and down your spine but that holy ghost on the inside of you is jesus christ himself has taken up residence in you to fulfill the same ministry that he had when he was on the earth before this world more than not just to make you rich or get you inflated cadillac's or a big mansion or something like that no to make you one with him and to and to carry on and reproduce amen the ministry of jesus christ through your spiritual womb friends amen that is the ministry of this bride it's christ himself impersonated in the people or incarnated in the people amen just like when he was on earth now he's doing the same things as husband and wife or king and queen amen just before the marriage ceremony amen see the purpose of the bride the ministry of the bride is to reproduce the bridegroom that's what that's what consummates a marriage that is the purpose of the union amen we know these things is to reproduce amen the bridegroom that is your ministry friends just like sarah in the old testament amen amen and mary in the new testament you have been called to bring forth the promised son oh now this is very important amen i hope you listen very carefully to this but you've been you have been called to bring forth the promised son well what does that mean brother nathan when you study the the promised son through the message and through the bible i don't i'm not going to take the time to go all into it this morning amen but but the promised son represents the coming of the lord it represents his coming amen his advent his arrival amen oh just like and that's what that's what every the the the there's a there's an experience that unites everyone from the old testament to the new up till today we all share one experience as god's children and that is waiting for the coming waiting for the coming abraham and sarah we're waiting for the coming israel was waiting for the coming simeon and anna were waiting for the coming we the churches have been waiting for the coming but the bride's ministry is to be the vessel through which his coming happens amen because he could not come the promised son couldn't come to abraham and sarah except it came through abraham's bride and thus jesus could not come into this world except he came by the womb of mary and jesus can't return to this earth unless he comes through the bride of jesus christ brother man said just as sarah's body had to be changed to receive the child of promise your bodies will have to be changed amen before jesus christ can come and sit on a throne it is your ministry and it is your purpose to be the very vessel by which amen jesus returns the rapture is not something floating around in the sky and one day it'll just kind of it'll just kind of accidentally randomly happen stance strike the earth the rapture friends amen is swirling around amen in the sacred fire on the altar of your heart it's christ in you rapture is in you the coming of the lord is in you it's coming through you you are part of it you are one with it glory be to god the promised son is a type of the coming lord it cannot come forth through any other vessel than the bride of jesus christ if sarah's body had to be changed amen we said that now i know see the rapture cannot come through any other church or people or queen or goddess or religion or idea or anything than you the bride of jesus christ i know that's an awesome statement amen but god is seeking a bride who can receive it a bride who can recognize their message recognize her day recognize such a time as this what we're on the earth for you to receive that message not just receive christ and brother branham but receive christ in you hallelujah amen amen you look at sarah amen sarah you know she was she was faithful to god's prophet she was faithful to him she believed him she fought him she was married sarah called abraham lord amen and we would say that that's the most the the most faithful message believer that it could be but did you ever contrast that to the two to the to the new testament because sarah called abraham lord amen and yet she was rebuked because she shirked at the promise it was too great it was too wonderful it's too it was too incredible for her to believe that she could be the one to bring forth the promised son of course bret grace brought it forth anyway amen but then in the new testament when jesus goes to find his bride amen there came a woman amen and said to him uh there's came a woman she said i want my child amen her child was demon-possessed her child ain't meant her child been taken from her she said i want that child amen amen but jim but she wasn't under a covenant she wasn't like uh she wasn't like sarah we would say she didn't she wasn't raising the message she wasn't around she never heard the hunting stories she never was part of the church she was backslid she didn't grow up in a pew she grew up on a bar stool whatever it was amen apply it to your own self but when she said truth lord amen jesus actually called her a dog amen but she but but see a little bit of resistance couldn't stop her something in her heart was driving her to the promise that's what he was looking for so when she said lord amen brother bran said she had a right to him under that name why she might not been part of abraham's line naturally but she was part of abraham's seed amen because she was the bride that he was coming for glory to god that's what i say i say truth lord truth lord i may not i may not have problems i may in my flesh i may not be redeemed i may not i may be a sinful creature and yet truth lord but i believe the promise i believe there's a crumb for me of this bread of life i believe i'll bring forth my child i believe in restoration glory be to god that's what he was looking for amen just like jesus when he was just like mary when he came to her blessed art thou mary and she thought me out of all the women in the world me but be it unto me according to thy word i'm so glad mary had just enough gumption about her just enough audacity to stand in the face of an angel telling her she's gonna bring forth the messiah and she said all right i accept it i don't understand it but i receive it so be it unto me according to thy word here's your handmaid you talk about friends talk about how the angel came to me brother brandon preached that i think i could preach about how the angel came to me amen i was nothing when he found me amen might have been or might have been associated with this message my whole life that didn't mean i had a clue about this word amen no hope for me nothing good about me amen when he found me but he came amen and the angel came to me amen i heard the words of the angel and it was a message to me that in my life jesus christ could be brought forth and it seems too wonderful to imagine that the very rapture amen could come through me and come through you but be it unto me according to thy word i didn't say it he did he chose me mary wasn't looking for it amen oh but the angel came looking for mary oh see you're just like mary that holy ghost came and overshadowed you if it was a baptism without sensation that doesn't mean what these false teachers think it means these starchy churches amen it means that there was no human intervention amen because she had no part to do with it joseph had nothing to do with it no man had anything to do with it but the holy spirit came and overshadowed her and it brought forth in her the seat of life that would save the world hallelujah that's your baptism friends it's not you but the holy ghost in you has overshadowed your life and birthed forth a seed it's the christ child being born in the individual heart you talk about a christmas message i think charles wesley wrote the words amen oh uh veiled in flesh the godhead sea hail the incarnate deity brother ram said deities not in heaven brother it's in you it's in the womb of your heart and the wonderful thing about it is it's a work of the holy ghost you have nothing to do with it amen you it's going to grow there's a law of life in it it's going to bring forth life brother man said your womb is sealed it cannot receive another scene of a discrepancy no it's shut off the door is shut and all you can do is bring forth christ shouting grounds it's a supernatural overshadowing and you are bringing forth the christ child into this world you are bringing forth the advent of the son of david and this time it'll really be peace on earth it'll really be good will toward man it'll really be everything he really will be wonderful counselor mighty god and the prince of peace he'll rule over a thousand years of peace and you'll rule with him do you ever just get beside yourself thinking about this word and how great it is how how beyond anything we ever deserved but it's true it is the word of god like the song mary did you know hey man little bride did you know could you ever imagine brother brian in a million years as a little boy what that god was what he was calling to you what this message would mean to you one day what he would do in your life amen what what that what he would make of you the the experiences you would have in his presence amen those revelations that would become open to your eyes just yours not the worlds but just but just as a little elect lady here's those love secrets mary did you know amen oh we had no idea but the message made it plain amen what is this message all about it's spirit and truth converging on the bride advent of jesus christ the bride coming his life in the body preparing us for the change amen because when that seed quickens the life things change that's what we're finding out around my house everything changes when there's a baby on the way when that life is coming forth it changes everything appetites change behaviors change amen moods change anyway amen but see see it's preparing us oh church it's time to know where you stand with god amen it's time to wreck let the bride recognize who she is that's when the rapture will go why when she sees what is being birthed in her own heart i no longer call you church i call you bride amen you're more than a sinner you're more than a servant you're even more than a son you are the bride of jesus christ see it's a consummation amen you've got to understand who you are to god what how precious you are to him the seed that you're carrying on the inside amen is the is this ultimate desire to bring forth you are his queen you are everything to him you know this thing talking about you know the natural side moods change but really you know even physically when a woman is is with child you know that sweetness comes over her and even the husband his behavior changes he becomes he becomes nurturing he becomes caring he becomes defensive he's protecting what is it is protecting that life on the inside amen that's why his hand is over you he's overshadowed you he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you because you've got something in the womb of your heart that's precious to me and you are precious to me because i chose you to receive it oh what a beautiful relationship what a beautiful picture amen you've got to understand who you are you're the queen see because what we have the problem the main problem one of the main problems that we have around the message is that this word is so great and it's identifying us with such power and with such authority but it doesn't match you know our sort of human experience or our human perspective and so we doubt it so much and christians struggle with condemnation they they stu they struggle with with guilt and shame and all these things so much amen it's just like esther esther didn't want to go before the king because she wasn't sure of his love she was not sure of her acceptance she knew she was a queen but she didn't know if she was on that level where she could just go into him because it was death to do it death to enter in but she got in the place where she found out it was death to stay out and so it became a crisis it became a time of decision amen she began to wonder maybe i'm here maybe this is it maybe this is the moment and i'm here for such a time as this but she knew that there was a haman that was out to get her her she had an enemy and he was very powerful and as far as she knew haman's words meant as more to the king than hers and that was what kept her out of his presence amen and it's what keeps the christian out of the presence of god every time amen is a little stumble a little mistake and then they doubt in their minds whether amen they hold as much weight with god as their accuser amen amen but and as long as she believed that human that haman's accusations meant as much to the king as she did she would never enter into that presence oh friends amen but but haman might have been a mighty man he might have been powerful but she was his queen amen and she had to realize i am the queen amen haman's great his accusations are great his power is great amen but to think out of a million girls in the kingdom out of all the eligible ladies all the talent all the beauty everything in this world the king chose me the king chose me and it was that revelation that took her into her presence friends i hope you hear what i'm saying until you can receive your revelation of justification that it's just as though you never did it in the first place you are washed you are pure you are sanctified amen until you can receive your election amen rest on your eternal security then how will you ever enter before his throne and receive power amen receive the scepter for the spoken word and the third poll and the rapture and all those things that are lying there in the hand of the king but you don't know that it's extended to you because you're afraid to go into his presence and find out amen but your accuser is nothing to the king compared to you because you are his queen as she found that out didn't he didn't she amen because when she went in that hour of crisis and she had worked up the courage to throw those doors open and step up before the king there was a whole lot of people that didn't want her there amen every sing you ever think that every single one of those statesmen and and rulers and princes that were in that court every single one of them had a daughter that he wanted to be the queen amen nobody wanted esther there all opposition was against her so it is for you you come to church on a sunday morning amen and the devil's just fighting you and bombarding you amen and even people getting up in the pulpits and trying to and trying to push down on the moving the spirit they don't want you to feel any emotion they don't want the lord the spirit to be able to move and touch you and they don't want any reality in it at all no power no experience no presence everything is trying to keep this bride out of the presence of the king trying to prevent that revelation that he is here now amen that's what it's all that's where the whole battle is but this pride has the courage you may not see it in yourself but it's in there friends and it may take such a time as this to for you to for to realize your potential but you can get past you can break through it all amen when the spirit comes to move over you you can get past what what somebody said once when you broke out in worship you you you got happy and did a little dance somebody criticized it i don't know why i'm going this way but you can get past that because you're the queen amen and all the critics in the world cannot keep you from your rightful place at his side haman himself your accuser cannot keep you out lord be to god so she went in there amen and it was and felt all that fear and all those all those slant eyes turn on her amen looking at her scant amen and and and judging her and angry at her and she walked up that long aisle to the king and maybe she was afraid to even look him in the eye but when she saw him he was smiling he was holding out a scepter because that was his queen friends and that's when she found out it didn't matter what haman had to say didn't matter what the accusers or her enemies it didn't matter what any of them tried to do she was safe as long as she was with that king because all the power of his throne was behind her all of his favor was on her he was for her he loved her she was his friends and you know the last thing uh brother
