amen he's done so much for us so why would we doubt that he would take us all the way through amen I I think we may have come in the church this morning with needs and burdens but if you just look back at your life and see what he's brought you through and amen sometimes I think about it because I've been in the middle of Trials and amen the Lord just just brings me through every time and then sometimes you get in another trial and you think how's it going to work how how's it how's he going to do it brother Brian but then you look back and you think hasn't he done at every other time amen and won't he do it this time amen because he's a faithful God amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning I I so enjoyed that worship that singing I just was so blessed amen just a wonderful atmosphere to serve the Lord and we're certainly happy to be with you once again and amen if you have your Bibles we go straight to the word we don't want to keep you long we'll turn to the Book of Exodus chapter 1 and thank you musicians and we were able to be in defiance last night brother Wayne was speaking at the meeting there for brother Steven Carle and we just had a wonderful time and got to see brother Samuel and and uh we're just sad that you know they you know I some of the boys were saying that they wouldn't be able to make it back and they were apologizing I said no I I wish I could stay too in here brother Samuel so wish we could just all be together but we know he's got a duty to be there this morning so we're praying the Lord bless his meeting and uh appreciate the comment confidence that he would have us to be here this morning Exodus 1 we'll read first verse down to the 12th and then we'll turn to Second Kings for a couple verses it says these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt every man in his household came with Jacob Ruben Simeon Levi and Judah issachar Zebulon and Benjamin Dan and naali Gad and Asher and all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were 70 souls for Joseph was in Egypt already and Joseph died and all his Brethren and all that generation and the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding Mighty and the land was filled with them now there rose up a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when they F th any War they join also onto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land therefore they did set over them task Masters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for Pharaoh treasure cities Pam and Ramsay but the more they Afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel amen now second Kings 3 just a couple verses here starting in verse 15 it says now bring me a minstril and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the Lord came upon Him speaking of Elisha here it says and he he said thus sayith the Lord make this Valley full of ditches for thus sayith the Lord You shall not see wind neither shall you see rain yet the valley shall be filled with water that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your Beast amen if you have a need on your heart let's just lift it up before the Lord as we go to prayer before we're seated Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your mercy and your grace to come into your house once again Lord and we feel your presence Lord Lord just the worship father just such a good good atmosphere in the house of the Lord this morning just to sing your Praises Lord to to feel the joy of the Lord as we've maybe had a heavy week Lord and we we have work and we we're in the atmospheres of the world and sometimes it's difficult but we come to the house of God and there's an atmosphere of joy and worship where we can lay aside the weights of the week and the burdens and we can just begin to Worship You Lord and begin to just remember Lord how faithful you are Lord that you're always right on time and Lord you see the needs you see the burdens of the hearts this morning and Lord we invite you to come down into this meeting just once more Lord and I pray that you take take control of my voice Lord knowing that I I I'm not sufficient to meet the expectations of the people but Lord I believe you're a supernatural God and you can meet the supernatural expectations of the hearts this morning and I pray Lord that your word would just begin to minister Lord and we'll be sure to give you the glory and the honor as we commit this service into your hands in Jesus name amen and amen you may have your seats this morning I've been doing a little study on the book of Exodus and I I don't know what it'll turn into it may turn into multiple Services uh but just some things that have been speaking to my heart and just if we could just build a foundation this morning uh we'd like to speak out of those scriptures on getting in the spirit of Exodus getting in the spirit of Exodus and of course brother brandham speaks on the sermon getting in the spirit and uh in different sermons he talks about the importance of getting in the spirit and the first thing he you know we want to lay the foundation of the importance of getting in the spirit brother Brandon would tell us that you just can't do any good until first you get in the spirit and I believe that we know that's the truth this morning I I believe each and every one of us feel that in different areas of our lives and as a minister I feel that of course the necessity of getting in the spirit not just to preach but even to study and prepare for a sermon if you just do it in the flesh you know you can you can do it intellectually but it's so much different when the Lord begins to come down and begin to put scriptures together and lead you through those different Aven news and you feel the inspiration of it but but it's not just for us preachers but the singer and and the worshipper and the musician you know if we just do it in the flesh you know we felt maybe sometimes you come to service and it's a little difficult to to to break through those barriers you feel maybe it's just a little heavy but all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord begins to move down into the music move down into the preaching and all of a sudden it's a different atmosphere and I believe that's what we want to do this morning we want to get in the Spirit as John would write in the Book of Revelations I was in the spirit on the Lord's day brother brandom said I think we could just call those words the whole of the Christian Life to get in the spirit because as Paul would say if I'm going to sing I'll sing in the spirit if I'm going to pray I'll pray in the spirit and John had to get in the spirit amen to get the Revelation on the aisle of patmas and brother brandom said he didn't just get in his own spirit because if he just got in the spirit of John it wouldn't have brought those great vision visions and Revelations but he had to get in the spirit of the Lord and caught up into an atmosphere and caught up into the vision that he might see what the Lord was wanting to show him that he might write the Book of Revelations that would take the spirit of the Lord not just the spirit of a man John and so that's what we want to get in the spirit the spirit of the Lord because you can get into the wrong spirit and maybe sometimes you've witnessed that even in before you were a Christian you would get in the spirit of the world or get in the Spirit of of worldly dancing or worldly music and they get in the spirit they get in the spirit of ball games they get in the spirit but they're getting in the wrong spirit and sometimes even Christians and nominal Christians you know they they get in the spirit uh uh but they but they don't know the true spirit of God and they'll end up worshiping under uh denominational Spirit thinking that they're worshiping God but there is a true Spirit there is a spirit of the Lord that's been introduced to us in this hour that that that he's here as a prophet would stand and declare he is here my Ministry is to to introduce him he's here the Lord is here and there's a bride that can get in the true spirit of God and get caught up in the message of the hour and realize that that your vision will change it'll change how you look at things but but you must first get in the spirit and you know brother Brandon would say you know that they get in the spirit of their ball games and Ben he would say that if we're Holy Rollers cuz they look at us and they call us holy rollers but but he said if we're Holy Rollers then they must be on Holy Rollers because they're getting in the spirit just the same as you it's just that they're getting in the spirit of the of their games and their baseball and their basketball they're getting in the spirit of it but then they'll come to the house of God and sit like a a fly on the wall and make fun of the true Christian for getting in the spirit of the word and me because they don't understand it they don't get in the spirit of the word and so they criticize it just like if you went to a ball game and you sit there when your favorite team scores a touchdown and they look at you funny you know what are you even doing here if you're not going to enjoy yourself you know but but but it's it's the getting in the spirit of the event but when they come to the house of God brother Brandon would say how they criticize Us and how they hate the Christians for getting into the spirit of God's word he said they call us Fanatics and holy rollers there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but he said ignore that that you can expect it knowing where it's coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship I think that's what we can do this morning is amen that little devil sit on your shoulder and he'll try to tell you well you're just you're just being emotional or you're just working it up amen but just ignore that critical spirit and just go on and get in the spirit of worship amen just go on and get in the spirit of the word amen just go on and get in the spirit of of the service because I believe that there's no limit to what the Lord can do amen if we as a preacher in a congregation would get caught up into the spirit amen then it would no longer be me and it would no longer be you but it would be the Lord moving in our midst because I don't believe the Lord's limited Amen to numbers I don't believe the Lord's limited amen only to the limits we place on him but I believe he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them and if he is here and if his spirit is here then I believe that there's nothing that he can't do this morning amen you may have walk in here brother Aaron with a hard week amen and you come into the house of God and as the scripture says sometimes the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak amen and that's why this morning we're not here just to get into the flesh because if we get in the flesh amen then we we'll never get anywhere because the flesh is up and down and the flesh will have you thinking one day you're saved and the next day you're not that's why you're not saved by your feelings and you're not saved by your flesh but you're saved amen by your faith in the word of God Amen as a preacher this morning I don't come here to preach to your flesh I didn't come here just to preach Amen to your reasoning and your affections I come here to preach to your soul because I believe amen this morning that no matter what situation you're going through no matter what it looks like with the natural eyes I know that there's a soul down there beyond the trouble beyond the circumstances and the word that I preach is the message of the hour amen by the help of the Lord I know that if that word begins to penetrate through your troubles and through your trials amen there's a soul in there that will begin to say Amen to the word of God am me because your flesh might not want to amen the word but your soul will say Amen to every word written in this Bible amen and that gives me a hope as a as a preacher of this gospel amen that no matter how dark it looks no matter how cloudy it seems if this word would just begin to go forth it'll begin to contact that spirit and that spirit will start to contact back and say amen amen and before you know it'll begin to draw you out of the heaviness of your weak and out of your burdens and your soul will be lifted up and caught up in the spirit and something will change the atmosphere will start to shift and you'll realize amen that that that that I've had a hard week but the spirit of the Lord is here Amen to turn it around he's here to heal he's here to deliver he's here to set the captive free he's here to bring you out of where you're at and lift you up oh and pour out a Revival upon your life I believe there's Revival available I I I don't I know that this nation amen she's passed Revival but I believe to the individual under the message of the hour there is a Revival amen and it's an unending Revival because it's a Revival that comes from the word I mean it's not just coming from emotion it's not a Revival that just comes from the music we don't have to beat it up this morning we don't have to pound it out of the altar but the word of the hour has been released and it's a message of spirit and truth and as it's released if you'll just get under it and begin to become a receiver amen of what the Lord is sending in the shower it'll bring a Revival in your life oh but you've got to get in the spirit of Revival to receive a Revival brother Brandon would say am mean that a minister can't bring the Revival amen ex except the people would get in the spirit of it to receive a Revival am me because I a man of God can only do so much amen but the Lord am mean I believe he's already promised us every blessing and every promise in this Bible but we've got to get in the spirit to receive it say Lord whatever you have for me today I'm willing and I'm ready and I'm open to receive what you have for me today oh Revival it means to bring back amen and just like that oh the way I come in today I was driving along that Lakeside and and brother Brandon would tell us that that Lake when those waves go to tossing and turning there's not any more water in that Lake amen than on a still day but what it is it's washing the trash out amen and that's what Revival means amen it means to wash the trash out of your life it doesn't just mean to add new members to the church it means to revive what's already there oh and sometimes amen you lose your joy sometimes you lose your peace and all you need is a good old fashioned God sent Holy Ghost Revival Amen to bring back what you've lost to bring back your joy and to begin to restore and wash out of your life all the filth of the world Amen that's what brother brandom showed us in the message getting in the spirit out of Second Kings there he begins to say how that minstral begin to play the music and that's what actually brought the prophet into the spirit anden you see it in the life of David how the Lord would use Music even to cast out Spirits amen they said how you know people try to take music out of the church amen but how it's it's an instrumental part of God's program Amen to begin to make the way for battle to get the people in the spirit that the Lord might move and here the spirit of the Lord begins to come down upon as the minstral plays and the the spirit of the Lord begins to come upon Elisha and Elisha begins to see a vision because Elisha was a prophet and God's program for dealing with a prophet is through VIs vision and brother brand said how did the Lord you know begin to deal with him and then brother Brandon begins to tell us that Elisha saw a vision amen and here he is and there they are in this situation and Elisha begins to have a vision and brother Brandon begins to say what you know what was the vision he didn't tell him to go and amen put on better uniforms he didn't tell him to go amen and go to schools of theology he didn't tell him to go and get better Weaponry he said just get to digging am mean and there is water and mean because the children children of Israel anden walked through that desert years ago and when they were in the desert there was a rock in the wilderness that would give them water and brother Bram said the water from that rock was still laying under that sand and if they would just get to digging and mean they would have access to the same water amen that Moses had access to and the children of Israel had access to oh and I believe that water is still laying there this morning and that a Believer can dig out the logs of excuses and condemnation amen the logs of it's not for me amen it was just for my parents but the same water amen that your parents got to tap into amen is still laying this morning that our young people can get to digging in the same Revival amen every generation gets a chance at Revival and that same water is still available this morning amen if we could just get to digging amen Revival is available for the Church of God this morning amen a refreshing is available this morning but you got to get the logs out and mean you got to get the logs out amen that mean I'm going to make a fool of myself or am mean my friends are are going to think I'm crazy aen but as you start to digging those logs out you'll realize amen that that water is still there and you may not see the evidence of it right away and mean but if you'll just keep digging and mean the rain may not fall but there's a source of water amen that's willing and ready to come up to the surface amen and feed your soul if you'll just get the logs out brother Brandon would say am me get the logs out he would say I think it's pretty you don't hear brother brandom talk about Tides much I don't feel like but here he says you hit an Old Log there what is this 10% of my wages he said we've been having soup sers to pay our preacher dig that old lock out log out there get it out there you oh God a tent I thought that's free this morning I'm just dropping that in there I thought that was pretty uh pretty funny how the prophet would talk about that here he's saying you know sometimes it's a log that lays in the way of a believer's life because you think well you know that was just under the law and I don't owe God my tithes but amen it's a log and if you ever dig it out it'll open up a blessing in your life amen because what you reap amen you will s and what you cast your bread upon the Water it will return unto you and if you want to open up a Channel of blessing in your life anden then give to the kingdom of God anden to watch the Lord begin to bless you amen I don't know how I'll do it but I know it's a law in the word of God Amen and it works amen but it's a log oh but if we just get all the logs out this morning amen and get into the vision amen because I like how brother brandom said it he said as long as you say bless God I'm Methodist I don't have to put up with such I'm Baptist I'm assemblies I'm oness all right go ahead he said you'll never see the vision but you throw that thing aside and get into the vision see Jesus coming and the church perishing here and get into the vision dig right down brother I'm telling you something will happen to you then you'll get in the spirit of Revival amen that's what we want this morning is to get in the spirit of it forgive me if I get comfortable amen and I like how he says it there because he says get into the vision because I don't know about you but the Lord may not deal with you with actual Visions but we've had a Prophet come and the word of the Lord comes to the prophet and so when the prophet came on the scene and mean the prophet would see a vision and the prophet would see the vision for this age and the vision for this generation and so you don't have to see a vision this morning you just have to get into the vision am me you don't have to see a vision of of how everything's going to work out but we've already had a vision and so go ahead and get into the vision I mean I like how brother Brandon would deal with people in the prayer lines and in one place he's talking about and I don't know if it was a vision but he's telling the person that there's a well person standing out just in front of you and he said Jesus Christ is calling you to that well body and what you do is you just keep walking he said he said now by faith as you close your eyes walk right into that well body then just keep walking just keep on going and that's how you do it this morning if you're sick or if you're in if you're in a situation you get a vision out out in front of you of a well body or a delivered body and and you start walking into that Vision amen without Vision the people perish and if a church loses its vision and mean it'll be turning one way and another way and don't know where to go amen but if you just get a vision this morning and start walking into that Vision all things are possible amen and I believe we don't need a new vision I believe we've already got the message of the hour but maybe your eagle eyes have got filmed over and I pray this morning the Lord would open up to us as individuals a fresh Vision amen a fresh vision of the coming of the Lord a fresh Vision to get Soul saved a fresh Vision Amen to see our loved ones come home Amen to see our sick healed to see our bound toiv and and if we just get a vision and start walking towards that Vision amen I believe all things are possible am mean you may have a crippled hand and mean and you get prayed for and that hand is just as crippled as it ever was but once you get a vision then it doesn't matter how crippled your hand is and mean you've got a vision and you just start walking and you might be able to move it a little bit at a time and the next day a little more but all of a sudden you'll be living in the vision and mean because it was a word vision and mean because it was a scriptural vision and mean we believe that God am mean his word is infallible and once he speaks it amen it's got to come to pass if you approach it upon the same basis and amen he's bound to his word amen it's like putting on a pair of glasses brother Aaron amen and before we come into this message our vision was blurry and mean our vision was cloudy it was just a denominational Vision but when you put on the glasses of this message oh you could see clearly am me because the prophet is lacking onto an eagle and our prophet got up in that Watchtower and he T us things that are to be and amen he taught us amen modern events made clear by prophet Y and when you put on this message and you let it become your vision am me it'll open up a whole new world unto you anden and you won't just be blinded by the dark Glade of seing condition but you'll have an Eagle Vision to look out and mean you'll be able to discern Spirits amen by the word of God and know where you stand who you are and where you came from anden where you're going to be amen because it brings Clarity to your life it brings Vision to your life amen that you know amen that you have amen a a destination amen Seasons may change but the vision doesn't change amen seasons are going to come and seasons are going to go amen transitions might come amen loved ones might pass away none of these things change the vision and mean you might lose your job am mean you might have a mistake you might fall down amen but the vision says get back up you've got somewhere to go and mean we've got somewhere to we've got somewhere to get to we we we're not just here amen just to be am mean Gathering service after service just to play church but we've got a vision and mean we we've got a goal to attain you and it can only be attained through the message of the hour if we look at the definition of it sometimes I like definitions it just opens things up to you and just a uh I I sometimes it's it makes it clear to me and and if we look at the definition of the phrase get in the spirit it says to fully embrace the enthusiasm and positive attitude surrounding a particular event or occasion Often by actively participating in activities related to it and uh adopting its theme and and that struck me when I begin to look at that because if you want to get in the spirit of the Season you're living in you adopt the theme of that season and right now we're coming into spring season so you put away the winter decoration and you begin to bring out the spring decorations because you're adopting the theme of the season and you know when we get into football season people amen very strongly be basketball whatever you adopt the theme of the season and they'll put on their jerseys and you know say I I'm an Ohio State fan or I'm this fan or I'm that fan because what are they doing they're adopting the theme amen uh of the identity that they're taking on the theme and mean when they get in the spirit of the season they adopt the theme of the season and me but Satan is is a shrew devil and what he'll try to do is try to get you to adopt the wrong theme and he try to get your confession to begin to say well I'm depressed or I'm anxious or I I I'm not going to make it and if he can just begin to sew seeds of Doubt am me into your theme then before you know it it'll become the whole theme of your life and me in your very theme and you'll begin to get in the spirit of depression and get in the spirit of anxiety until it's just like a cloud hanging over your head Amen in every day that that that becomes your theme amen but but Satan is such a liar this morning and God sent us a word amen not just to sit on the letter to put it in your mouth and begin to confess the word of God and let it become the theme of your life and mean when Satan tries to get you to take on his theme you say no devil am mean I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God and this morning I'm free I am healed I'm delivered amen by a Stripes I'm Healed if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover amen and that's the theme of my life because I'm a Christian am mean and when I became a Christian I adopted the theme of being a Christian and because I'm a Christian I pray I read my Bible and Christ becomes the theme of my life am me because it's just who I am amen and when you ever can get your identity settled anden by revelation God begins to show you who you are and mean then you no longer have to wonder what your theme is amen but your theme becomes settled in the word of God that I'm going to make it the Rapture is for me amen the body changes for me the marriage separates for me and mean because I know who I am and I know what my theme is that's why this morning we're speaking on getting in the spirit of Exodus because there they were down in that land amen but they had a theme they were getting in the spirit that this is not where we belong but we're going to come out of here one day because Exodus means called out and so there they were and there they were down in that land amen but God had already promised Abraham I mean in Genesis 15 that the Seed of Abraham would be a Stranger in a Strange Land that wasn't theirs and they would sojourn there for 400 years but afterward they would come out with great substance and the iniquity of the amorites wasn't yet fulfilled in the land that he had promised them and me the amorites dwell there and Giants dwell there but when their time was up they would have to give way because the children of Israel were going to come out and possess that land am mean but brother brandom says that sometimes the cogs of God's will turn slow but they turned sure and he said God makes everything work together just right just like car coming together and sometimes you'll look out and you say how's it going to be amen but those cogs of Prophecy amen they're turning amen those great grinding wheels of God's prophetic anden they're always turning sometimes slow but always sure amen and some of our elders this morning have watched them turn for a lot longer than I have amen but have they always been sure brother and me has this message always Vindicated itself amen time and time again what about sister have they always been sure and mean they've always worked together just right am me but sometimes we look through our natural senses of time and sight and brother Bram said time and sight are two of God's worst enemies because neither one declare anything about God and we want it done right away but God takes his time about things and so we realize sometimes there's a time of waiting but there's coming a time of Deliverance and me sometimes you find yourself waiting wondering how's this going to work out how's this all going to play out oh but the time of Deliverance is coming and may because God's promises are true oh my if you look at literature there's actually a word it's called the day newon and it's the word in literature where the the the final loose ends of the plot get get tied together at the very end it's the closing scenes of of the literature where the author begins to tie together all the Loose Ends of of the plot amen and sometimes that's how it is in life it looks like a lot of loose ends amen but it's just coming down to that final chapter in those last moments where the author Our Father begins to tie together all the Loose Ends isn't that what this message came to do it come to tie together the loose sins of doctrines and when were men of God had tried to tie them together but they could never get him just right but God sent a prophet to tie those loose ends together and now we have a message and it's not loose but it's tied it's perfect Gathering a bride for a Rapture oh but if he did it for the message and mean can he do it for his children and mean and you look at your children and mean and they're still out in the world and you say God how's this going to work out but God has a way in the closing scenes of the book Amen to tie those strands together he has a way in the darkest moment to step in on the scene am me and bring healing and bring prodigal home oh I I believe he's able to do it this morning amen I think of my wife she has a testimony where uh she was I think a uh maybe about 18 years old and and we had had some uh troubles and we had been together and got apart and it was it was my fault and man I just I I told it at the church the other day and I kind of made it sound a little bit like it could be her fault and I I think I had to apolog oliz because it was my fault I I I wasn't you know committing the way I should have been and so we had some trouble and anyway she got into a spot where you know she was pretty ready just to move back down to Arkansas she you know she she had lived up here but she was having some trouble and she was ready just to move away and mean but we had a New Year's Eve service and we had kind of a popcorn style meeting where all the brothers were getting up and it was the first time I ever spoke personally in the church and I got up and I began to speak and and me it was just special for me and there at the end of the service uh Brother Ray got up and he began to pray and the power of the Lord fell down in that building and it struck her where she was at in her seat and she got up you know her confession and her testimony she got up from there a different person than when she went down and even desires and things that she was struggling with were gone amen from the moment she went down to the moment she came up she was a different girl and there just a few weeks later she uh we started dating and just a few months later ien she married a preacher and now we have a son but if you looked at it in your naturalized amen it looked pretty dark as a parent of of a daughter it looked like she was about to move away and and she was about to take a wrong direction but just in a moment God could change that direction and I believe it can happen in a moment this morning and mean it looks like a mean your child or your loved ones going a certain way or maybe even you sitting in the house of God this morning in your spirit and mean you're ready to go the wrong way but the power of God begins to drop down and it begins to turn your direction and let you know that no that's not the way to go just like brother Brandon when he was there lost in the mountain trying to guide a me but God would put his hand down on his shoulder and turn him around and say no the Mountain's this way and mean and God will not lose a one of his this morning and his hand is not too short that it can't reach down and set your path on a Rapture path and on an eternal path oh I believe he still got a hand to turn down amen and when the time of waiting is over the time of Deliverance will come and God will not lose a one of his amen but youve got to keep the theme don't get discouraged and well-doing don't get weary and praying and seeking the Lord for the answer am mean because God is moving and mean there they were down in the in the lands of Egypt am mean but there was a something in Jacob's heart because Circumstances had led them to the desert and me brother Brandon's begin to say that drought had driven them down into the lands of Goan and led them into Egypt and there they were standing there but Jacob was determined although they were spending amen hundreds of years in Egypt there was something about him that they never lost the vision brother Dave of Exodus because Jacob there down in the land of Egypt he said don't you leave my my bones here when I die because we're coming out of here one day amen and Joseph said no don't bury my bones he said you can put them in a casket but don't bury them here in Egyptian land I mean because we're going to leave here one of these days you see they never lost the vision and me because job had had a revelation and mean that in my flesh I will see God Amen and it may not have been written in scripture but those Patriarchs caught the Revelation and Abraham was buried where job was buried and Sarah was buried where job was buried and Isaac was buried and Jacob and Joseph said no don't bury us here because the resurrection is not going to take place in Egypt it's going to take place in the promised land so bury my bones in the promised land oh friends and brother brandom said I caught the spiritual revelation of the coming of the Lord and he said that's why I left the Baptist Church because I knew that the resurrection wouldn't take place in the Baptist church or the Methodist Church but it would take place in Christ and so he buried himself am me in the spirit of the Lord amen that on the resurrection morning and me brother Brandon will be a part of it because he didn't bury himself in just a denomination but he buried himself in Christ Oh by one Spirit we're baptized into one body and it's the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the grave brother shame if it dwells in you it'll also Quicken your mortal body so if you want to get in the spirit of Exodus you're going to have to get in the spirit of God am me because that's where this Exodus is taking place oh it's not taking place in a church it's not taking place under a certain one man Ministry it's taking place under the spirit of the revealed word for our day that God sent through a prophet oh we're going out of here one of these days and I think it's important to remember it friends I think we ought to get in the spirit of it am mean that we're not here to stay in this world you ever go on a vacation I mean you're just gone for a couple days and so it's hard to get settled into the hotel or the condo or the Airbnb and sometimes you just live out of a suitcase and mean because you know I'm here but I'm not here to stay and that's how it is in this world friends we're here but we're not here to stay and mean we brought nothing into this world and it sure will carry nothing out amen but but but but here we have no continuing City am mean like Abraham we're pilgrims and strangers amen but we're seeking a city to come that's why we don't lay up our Treasures here on Earth but we lay up our Treasures in Heaven amen where moth and dust cannot corrupt it amen because we have a city that we're going to oh sometimes you might have to forsake houses and lands here on this side amen but just remember amen that you are not of this world Amen but you have a Heavenly Home amen where God can repay everything that you forsaken on this side oh my that's why we seek first the kingdom of God am mean because we're not in the leay of the see in spirit of am mean I'm rich and I have need of nothing amen but I'd rather be rich in spirit than rich in wealth of this world and mean because one of these days all the wealth of this world will be burnt with fire amen but there'll be a bride amen out of mar supper amen caught up in the heavenlies AM mean because she didn't just get in the spirit of this world but you got in the spirit of God oh my and we're going out of here one of these days amen we're not here to stay friends am we're not of this world we're only here for a season we're in it but we're not of it amen I'm American by natural birth but by spiritual birth I came from the back part of the mind of God and one of these days he's going to call me back oh that's home this isn't home but that's home and we're going home home and if we're going home if God's calling us out of this world as the scripture says iath Not Seen Nor Ear heard what he has in store for those that love him and if he's calling you out I believe he has somewhere better to take you I mean I don't believe God would call you and if you feel the tug of God this morning calling you higher we don't have to be scared and me say Lord I'm comfortable where I'm at but if he's calling you out he's got somewhere better to take you amen so we got to follow the leading of his spirit I think it applies to our trials I think it applies to our sickness I don't think that we should ever get complacent Amen in anything the devil throws at us but I think we should look the devil in the eye and say devil I'm here but I'm not here to stay Amen brother brandom said it he said that's what he's spreading this morning to you sick people you sick people that seems like you're going to sit there all your life if the devil can get you to believe that he's got you I mean you see that's what the devil would try to get you to believe this morning that you're just going to sit there all your life that you're always going to be sick or maybe in the spiritual that you're always going to be in that condition you're always going to go through those Cycles you're always going to remain there amen but it's just the devil amen trying to get you to put your Stakes down in Egypt but that's not where you belong this morning am me brother Brandon said about this little girl he said she had bad ankles and high blood meure and many things wrong with her and brother Bram said Satan would give her a stroke if he could he would lay her up yonder on the bed of Affliction he'll put her out of commission in he can for he don't want her testimony and me and that's the this morning when Satan Whispers in your ear that you're always going to stay there amen and you begin to wonder maybe that's really the truth amen but Satan don't wants your testimony and that's why he'll try to keep you down and mean because he don't want your testimony and mean he don't wants you to rise to the potential that God is calling you to and mean because God can bring healing to that sickness and when brother Brandon begins to tell about that little girl they said people who don't understand would ask why why is she in this condition why is she here and then he begins to tie it to that little boy who was blind in scripture and they would ask him why are you blind because your mother sin or your father sined and they said no neither but that the works of God might be made manifest that little boy was blind and it said I believe that's why this little girl has gotten this condition and me not because of sin me but that the works of God might be made manifest oh glorymen don't let the devil lie to you and mean and sometimes I know there's special cases but sometimes you find yourself in a trial and Satan will try to tell you that it's because you sin or because some generational curse amen but tell that Devil he's a liar and get determined to be a testimony for the kingdom of God and say no devil I'm determined not to stay here I'm determined to come out of this sickness I'm determined to be a testimony I'm determined to let my life and me be for the glory of God that I was not built to stay in this sickness but I'm going to come out of here oh you've got to let it be your testimony friends amen because Satan if if you're not careful Satan will try to build you up in a complex if you've been sick a long time and try to get you to get an A comp complex of self-pity and me then you want everybody to pity you because you're sick but if you're not careful self-pity becomes an enemy to healing and mean and self-pity will hold you in the cage and keep you in a complex of sickness I mean and you want everybody to pet you and me but it's a complex and and brother Brandon found himself in that complex one time he said when he was in a meeting for eight days or whatever it was he got in that complex but then he heard an eagle scream when he picked up a book by FF Bosworth called Christian confession and it said a Believer doesn't look at what you see with your eye but you look at what you see by faith oh and that'll break every self-pity complex and mean you might have been there like the woman at the uh with the blood issue with 12 years she had that blood issue but brother Brandon said she never had self-pity but when the master came by amen she said this is my chance to be made well and I believe amen this morning no matter how how many years you've been in that condition and just one sweep of the master this morning and if you don't let yourself get into self-pity but recognize the moment and say no I'm not going to sit here in a complex the Master's here and this could be the service of my healing this could be the service of my Deliverance this could be My Moment oh amen that man at the pool of Bethesda he was sick for 30 some years and but he didn't lay there in a pity but he'd recognized his moment with the master oh I think of Abraham and Sarah 25 years they waited on that promise and but what did they do did they sit there and say wowy wowy me it's been so long when's it going to happen no they went into the store and they bought booties and they bought a crib and they begin to think Sarah what will it be when Isaac comes what will it be like to hold him what will it be like to to feed him a bottle and nurse him anden but what were they doing they were adopting the theme of the oncoming promise oh friends and mean that's what if you I I'm sure you all know the testimony of Mariah puit she had that Al thecia where she was losing her hair amen but she didn't let it become the theme of her life amen but she took those bobby pins and she began to adopt another theme and she brought those bobby pins in that prayer line and she said I'm here but but I'm not here to stay I'm determined to be a testimony for the glory of God and tonight or this morning she has long hair and then because she didn't stay in that condition but she adopted the theme of her Deliverance oh and it led to it amen she got her healing amen but she had to maybe change her expectation maybe maybe the devil would try to get her just to expect just you might as well expect that one day you're going to be totally bald amen because of this sickness that's what it does you might as well expect it but maybe one morning she had to drive down a Stak no I'm not going to expect to be totally bald I'm going to expect to have a head full of hair because I serve a mighty God am me I I I know what that's like have you ever been there and mean you're going through a valley and and and I've been there where where you come to church and if you're not careful you'll actually get in a spot where you just expect to to not be able to maybe enjoy the service because maybe maybe you're going through a season where you have young children or you're going through a season of sickness and it's hard for you to enjoy the service like you used to and the devil will try to get you down into a discouragement until you start to expect to have a bad day or a bad service amen but that's when you got to change your expectation and that's when you stop expecting trouble in heartache and bad days and you start expecting the god of Miracles Amen to come on the scene and turn the situation around oh you say no devil I'm going to start expecting my healing I'm going to start expecting amen change to come amen like brother BR said you heard about the lady that prayed for the mountain to be moved and got up the next morning and looked out the window and said just as I expected still there he said that's the reason she expected it that's right am mean but what about the sir phenician woman am mean that when the Lord Lord would tell her that you know she was like a dog and she said oh yes Lord but even the dog eats the crumbs from the master's table and he said because of thy saying go thy way thy daughter shall be made well and me and she went her way and she didn't say well Lord you should do it this way or Lord you should do it that way but whatever the Lord spoke she expected to find it that way and when she went home her daughter was well in the bed because she expected what the Lord had spoken to come to pass and I believe if the Lord spoke it you have a right to expect it amen we are not amen Children of the devil we are children of the promise and I believe you have a right to let your expectation match who you are anden you're not just a denominational church member friends we are the Bride of Jesus Christ who we've been given the authority of the spoken word and when under inspiration you speak a promise you have a right to expect that word to come to pass you have a right to expect that mountain to move amen because am mean that's who you are you are adopted Sons and Daughters of God am mean you're not just Fly by Night amen amen intellectual Christians you're word born amen word filled Sons and Daughters of God Amen that have a right Amen to expect the promises of God to manifest in your life amen and maybe not the way you think they should or ought to amen but the way that God said they would amen it'll happen just the way he said it would am mean even if it don't look possible he's the god of the impossible and he always is right on time look at look at them in the book of Exodus look at what they were going through when they come up right up to the brink of Exodus and when they're raised up a pharaoh who knew not Joseph and as we read in the opening scripture and the Pharaoh and mean there it was I believe it was SEI Pharaoh had honored Joseph believed he was a prophet and respected him but when Ramsay raised up he didn't respect Joseph and he began to turn against the children of Israel I mean and he had no a mean maybe spiritual reasoning but was just a maybe just uh uh believed in the power of of you know the government and he was beginning to turn against that religious side he didn't believe in the freedom of religion but he began to persecute the children of Israel and said put task Masters over over them and put put put put them in prison and make them build bricks because and mean if they get strong they might join up with our enemies and come against us and so Satan begin to try to stop the oncoming visitation am mean but but but he would say mid wise if it's a if it's a if it's a Manchild you need to kill it at the birth or and mean eventually would tell them you need to throw it in the river but what was he doing and because brother brandham told us that there's three powers to an Exodus he said there's the power of Satan the power of faith and the power of God and he said Satan mostly knows God's program and he tries to interfere and he usually always acts first and so when God is performing in Exodus Satan mostly knows I like that mostly amen he mostly knows enough to try to interfere amen but he doesn't know enough or have enough power to stop it amen so we try to interfere by cutting off Moses life amen and he's tried to interfere by cutting off Abel's life and cutting off Christ and killing him on a cross and but no matter but no matter how much he tries to interfere he can't stop God's program and mean because God's program is going to go on friends nothing can stop the program of God and there he tried to stop it like brother Brandon would say in the message is there anything too hard for the Lord he said there was sat and trying to stop the oncoming visitation for Abraham and Sarah and and what he'll do is he'll try to come like on a Sunday morning he'll try to give you a hard morning and try to get you just to say well this is just going to be a bad day I guess it's just something's wrong maybe I've sinned maybe I've done something wrong and you begin to let yourself drop down into a confusion of of worry and maybe have you displeased the Lord or have you done something wrong but many times it's just Satan trying to stop and oncoming visitation and if you can just recognize it on a Thursday night or on a Sunday morning when you've begin to feel that feeling maybe you have a car accident on the way to work and you begin to think something's wrong and you get all frazzled but that's not the time to get frazzled that's the time to put down a steak and say Satan I see what you're doing the Lord must have something for me today so I'm going to go to the house of God and receive my blessing amen because Satan can't stop it oh brother br they try to put an end to this shouting they try to close the church doors and mean they try to shut this message down and me but they can't stop God's program am mean they can't stop the coming of the Lord am mean because it's God's program and there's not enough powers in hell to stop it oh he said you know they tried to burn it out they tried to feed it to Lions but every time they try to persecute the church we read it in Exodus 1 that the more they persecuted them the stronger they got and that's what Satan does to you the more he tries to persecute you and hit at you and pound at you he's trying to destroy you but because there's a seed in your life you can't be destroyed so instead you just end up getting stronger than ever before am mean he's tried to blow on the fire of God's word amen for generations and generations amen but the more he blows the bigger the Fire gets because it's not been lit by man but this fire has been lit by God and Satan tried to blow it out but it's burning this morning stronger than ever before because it's found a place and Sons and Daughters of God and Satan Winds of of confusion and Winds of Doctrine and winds amen of controversy have tried to blow against your life and get you to stop believing this message but all it does is shakes up your roots enough that they might grow deeper and you say Satan no I believe it more than ever before I trust it like never before and me because if you haven't got me yet I have confidence that you'll never get me I must be a Son of God I must have come from God oh and I must be going back to God because Satan's tried to destroy me but he can't oh he's tried to stop you brother Dave but he can't and mean he can't stop what God has started and mean he can't break what God has mended and mean he can't destroy what God has fixed I mean because it's the work of the Lord and is mighty and it's strong oh my God has sent us a message to prepare us for Exodus and me brother BR preaches a message preparation and begins to lay a foundation how before God does anything he always prepares for it and God is always prepares the people for the events that's just about to happen and we've seen it throughout all the scripture and me in the days of Noah God prepared a man to come on the scene and begin pounding away at an ark that that the people might have a way of Escape in the days of Noah that the that God will prepare an escape for his church and brother Bram said God is preparing a church today to be saved just that he as he did in the days of Noah in the ark he said I believe the people are in the preparation of the last great destruction this world will ever know and skipping down he says they're in the spirit of the last days and God cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit for Destruction he said cannot be War until people get in the spirit of War amen and so they're getting in the spirit of the last days amen and brother Brandon begins to you know show us and we we see it all around us how you know they're they're making movies about it they're building their bomb shelters they're they're getting in the spirit of it they're am mean they're getting in the spirit of just a a religious spirit just and mean go to a denomination and live any sort of way and think that they're fine but brother Bram said the world's got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come and we're in the spirit of the last days but here he says God in another message let us be in the spirit of Christ tonight so we can have Christ let us be in the spirit of repentance a spirit of Faith give it to us tonight amen you see how the world is getting in the spirit of destruction we see how Israel is getting in the spirit to receive her Messiah they're they're making preparations Amen to for for for they're coming they're they're getting together their their their relics and their instruments they're getting together their red heers that to sacrifice them and they're even saying that they may be able to do it this Passover they're they're getting it all together that they might build the Third Temple and me to welcome back their Messiah and maybe they don't understand how it's going to come like we do but they're getting in the spirit of it and when we see that as a bride we know am mean there's a people getting in the spirit am me of an exodus and mean there's a bride getting in the Spirit am me of the coming of the Lord am mean we see the world getting in the spirit of destruction we see Israel getting in the spirit of their Messiah and as a bride am mean we've received a message that's put us in the spirit amen to get out of here amen we're not going to be here forever but there is a time where God will call us off of this Earth amen but he sent us a message to put us in the spirit of it oh my friends as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man and me in the days of Noah they got in the spirit of destruction but there was some elect that got in the ark because they recognized that there was a prophet in the scene and preparations were made that they wouldn't have to go through the destruction but there would be a way of Escape oh in the days of lot they got in their Spirit they married wise they they did all these things but there was an Abraham amen that would come out of the systems amen and receive the preparations and oh friends we've been put in the spirit of preparation by the message of the hour and that said oh the plagues are coming but before that comes behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord that you might be dressed in the garments of the word that you might prepare oh to leave out of here Amen in Luke 17 it said that there'd be two in the field one would be taken one would be left Amen in the message was sent in this hour anden and amen it might have left the one next to you but it picked you up anden it began to reveal the son of man to you I mean this message begin to call your name and it was separating you amen for Rapture like it separated the wheat from the tears and the Goat from the sheeps this message began to call you out and separate you for the coming of the Lord am mean it's always been am mean in the first Exodus he sent Moses accompanied by the pillar of Fire fire in the second Exodus he sent John the Baptist to prepare way for his first coming am mean and let him know and there was the pillar of fire in that day but in this Exodus he sent us to Elijah accompanied by the same Pillar of Fire calling us out of the systems and calling us into the millennial reign with him amen he's always sent a message and a messenger to prepare people for Exodus that you wouldn't be left here Amen in confusion that you wouldn't be left here but she would say come out out of her my people and come up oh how would they know how to prepare how would they know how to apply the token how would they know how to prepare the Passover and put the staff in their hands and the shoes on their feet unless there was a Moses in the land oh and how would you know how to prepare how would you know how to be dressed in the word how would you know how to apply the token unless God had sent a Moses in this hour to say friends this is what you need to do apply the token get Des put it on display get your families under it and me get them under that blood like Rahab under that scarlet cord oh prepare yourself and mean he warned us of the coming destruction but he also gave us the material to prepare oh that we might not have to stay here oh it's written in Revelations 18 as we begin to draw it down it says I saw after these things I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies he said I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues anden brother BR said then God sent an angel a messenger to what call out come out the message of the hour is come out of the systems anden brother Bram said in Revelation 17 it speaks of mystery Babylon and reveals who that is and then immediately after that it began to reveal and call come out of her and mean Revelation 17 revealed what it was but Revelations 18 there come a voice saying come out of her my people and brother brandham ties the voice of Revelations 10:7 to the voice of Revelations 18:4 that at the sounding forth of the message of the hour it would call a bride out of the systems at the same time that those seals were open there was a loosening amen of the word that begin to sound forth and call you come out of confusion come out of the systems he didn't say he said you don't have to leave your church oh but that spirit will begin to call come out from among the confusion you don't have to be confused any longer about what's the truth and what's not am me this message isn't just amen some from some amen hillbilly voice this came from Heaven it's a scriptural message it's the voice of God in this last day saying come out of the systems and be birth oh into the liberty of the word for your day oh I believe it's a season of it I believe I believe it's the season of coming out as the scripture says come out from among them and be separate touch not their unclean thing and I will receive you oh brother Brandon said if there ever was a coming out time it ought to be right now and mean he said in the message the way of a true Prophet I think it's a time it's just about another coming out party another Boston Tea Party has to say Oh Glory I believe it's time this morning another coming out party because what you know in that days of that Boston Tea Party in 1773 and mean there was some I mean just some common people who had left the old land and they come into the new land amen but they were trying to tax their tea and make it uh impossible amen for them to you know operate in the liberty of the new land and there was taxation without representation and they were getting tired of living in the new land under the old rulership and mean and they actually were called that group was called the Sons of Liberty amen and they got so tired of it that they begin to get in the spirit and they begin to put pain on their face and dress up like Indians and go out and throw all that tea off the boat anden and you know those actions didn't just stop there but a few short years later they led the way that they would sign the Declaration of Independence that they would know no longer be tied to that old Union but there would be a new Union of Liberty and I believe that that's what this message came to do and me it came and mean that there would be some Sons of Liberty and mean that would come out from the methodists and the Baptists and the Lutheran and mean and you didn't just come to the new land to live under the rulership of the old land and mean you didn't just leave the Creeds and me to stay under bondage but you come to the message to be married to the anointed word for your day and and this is the word now am mean this isn't a denomination this is the word and you've got to die to the old denomination to be birthed into the new and you've got to die to those Creeds to be birthed into this word and we didn't just come into this message to bring the chains of the old Union into this message but this message brought us Liberty this message brought us freedom and mean it begin to let you know and mean that if your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life then it's not whether you shout or whether you don't it's not whether you dance or whether you don't and the Pentecostals were all about it but a prophet would come and say whether you speak in tongues or whether you don't if your name is on the L's Book of Life and me then you're a Freeborn Son of God and you have a right to enjoy the Liberties of the message of the hour you have a right to feed on the word for your day and mean and you're not under a nicolan spirit and me that you've got to run and mean you know and oh we don't have to bring a measuring tape to the house of God every Sunday and measure the skirts and measure this and that anden get him in the message get him under the pillar of fire and oh give him an exodus and me that oh it'll become a liberty and not because someone said do it not because Pastor said do it but because oh there's a new life amen the Holy Spirit Will Lead You In All truth the holy spirit will take the makeup off the Holy Spirit Will Am me get you back on level ground and put modest clothes on you and me it'll take the earrings off it'll it'll take all care of all that oh you see if you just make it a land of legalism or a land of fanaticism you have a bunch of robots amen that are just listening to what some man told him to do but I'm thankful for God sent pastors and God sent men of God that'll just preach the message in its Liberty anden and in his power and let the anointing of the word amen begin to shape the people into the image that God desired to see in his bride oh this message is perfect I mean the the legalism was already shaved off the fanaticism was already shaved off when God sent us this message am mean it was a pure word amen that we could enjoy it and feast on it amen with Liberty without condemnation that we might be free amen and we might know who we are and me because it called us into our identity anden because this third X Exodus is calling a bride out of a church and there they were and there they were in the time of that Boston Tea Party brother Dave and they were gathering and what they would do is they would call themselves by the name of the state that they lived in they would say we're Virginians or or or we're North Carolinians or whatever the first colonies were there you know they say we're this and we that but as they begin to gather against this system they begin to call themel for the first times Americans can can imagine that the first time that was ever uttered forth were Americans say well well well I'm a I'm I'm a Virginia no now you're an American and can you imagine and mean as these seals begin to open for the first time a prophet begins to say so that you might understand I no longer call you church I call you bride you're no longer Methodist you're no longer Baptist you're no longer Lutheran I call you bride and that you might know know that you have been Loos from your old marriage like you never done it in the first place and you've been married to the word for your day and and you're Justified as though you never did it in the first place oh that old Taskmaster that's been beating you for years and years that thing is dead and drowned in the sea and the message is calling you to your identity saying no you're my bride amen because that's a coming out party that's the party we've had because if you look at the world and when they have coming out parties it's actually it's a perversion in the season we're living and they'll get their families together and say I'm no longer a boy or I'm no longer a girl what a sick perverted devil and but if that's true in the negative what about in the positive and when the message begins to call your name it's saying come out of her my people and you say oh for the first time your eyes get open and you say that's why I've always been different that's what made me different from my friends and from the school and from all the world it was a jean seed on the inside of your heart and that seed began to get pulled and tugged by the message of the hour saying you're my bride you were never meant to be a part of that system you were never meant to be bound in Traditions and dogmas and Creeds come out into your true identity and when the bride recognizes its its position in who she is then the Rapture will go and that message begin to sound forth and let you know brother Shane who you are and where you came from and where you're going that's true oh calling you to your identity calling you come out of the confusion and mean because we read it in Revelations 18:2 and it would say that it was a cage trapped that system was a cage to every unclean bird I mean we could read it again but we read it for the sake of time and brother brother Brandon begins to say how sure they were trapped in that cage vultures and chickens but he makes it very clear that there was no Eagles in that cage of unclean birds all that World Council of churches it trapped a lot of chickens it trapped a lot of vultures oh but the Eagles were all called out under the sounding of that message I mean you were not left behind amen and because he didn't leave you behind in the system and mean he won't leave you behind for the tribulation because that Jean seed has already been caught up into the Heavenly places and if that seed has been quickened already anden then you've already made it anden then that same spirit that raised you up from the Creed into the Living Word will also Quicken your mortal bodies oh Hallelujah there's no Eagles in this cage it's an eagle age and mean you were born for the skies you were born to be an eagle and mean we're no longer under an old age as brother Brandon would begin to tell us this is Eagle time am me that's prophesied in Revelations 10:7 and Malachi 4 that it would come an eagle age an astronaut age where a people would be lifted up above the world called out of Le DEA oh and begin to tell you that there's four beasts in Revelations 4 he said there's a there's a lion and there's a ox and there's a man and there's an eagle and he said those four beasts were sent to combat the four horse riders and he said the lion combed the Roman age and the ox combed that Dark Age of that martyrdom and that man combed that amen intellectual age those were the reformers Martin Luther and and Knox and the reformers but he said in the evening time there would come forth a flying eagle anointing that would combat the age of Darkness Le to see and Antichrist Spirits all around but there would rise a prophet under an eagle anointing and me that would combat that system and because you belong in this Eagle age you're not under an ox anointing you're not under a lion anointing you're not under a man anointing but you're under an eagle anointing and you just can't help but be the spirit of the age that you dwell in oh and God knew what age to place you and mean he didn't place you in the ox age if you were meant to be there he would have done it he placed you here because you were meant to be in this age and he knew what age you belonged in so he began to call you out and place you in the eagle age oh that's where we're at this morning it's Eagle time it's revealing time it's calling up high time oh I love it I think that's one of the greatest examples of an exodus I can think of is when that little Eagle amen because a farmer was raising chickens but he was shorten egg and so he took that eagle egg and placed it in that Nest oh and it began to it began to be built under a chicken atmosphere and it was born one day but there was something about it that didn't never fit in brother Bram said a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes he's a son Amen brother Bram said in fact a lot of true Christians are like the story of that baby baby eagle that was hatched under a hand you can go a long time before recognizing your son am mean but there that eagle was it knew it didn't fit in it tried for a season to dwell amongst those chickens but it never fit in it never belonged and so one day when mother Eagle begins to Circle that old Barnyard and it begins to cry out that eagle scream there's something in that eagle that begins to say whoa that sounds familiar that sounds like my language that sounds like home and mean because it spoke the same language that's why when this message began to call you you understood it because it was Eagle to Eagle it spoke your language it was calling your name and mean because you may have spent years in the chicken yard not knowing you were a son but when this message begin to call your name it begin to reveal to you that you always were a son that you always were an eagle that you never belonged in the chicken yard but something was calling you higher and me because this message will call you higher friends and me sometimes you might feel like it's preaching above you and you're never going to reach it but that's because it's an eagle message and it's only calling you higher so sometimes it'll preach above you and me but don't feel condemned just say Lord I want to get up there amen where the preacher's preaching and I feel a Tug come up higher oh and that eagle started with a flap you know the sky might have looked a long ways away but he started with just a little flap and sometimes that's all you do that you just start with a little move towards God and Me Maybe all you can do is raise your hand me but it's a move towards God how did the T how did the children of Israel get out of Egypt it started with a step and me that the same step that took them amen from Egypt Into the Wilderness could take him into the promised land but it started with a step amen sometimes you just got to take a step and me sometimes you you feel like you're never going to reach it but you just take another step and before you know it you'll be a lot longer down the road than you were a few months ago or a few years ago oh and that eagle am me it jumped up on that barnyard post and mean it wasn't high enough it wasn't where he belonged but maybe it was higher than he'd ever been before and mean for the first time in his life he's beginning to realize this old chicken yard that I've been pending for my whole life it's not going to hold me forever and he began to realize that those man-made cages would not hold him oh I like what a prophet said he said you can't organize Pentecost you can't denominate Pentecost is an experience not an organization he said it's for you methodists you Baptists and Presbyterians he said they try to draw offences is around it but it's not so Eagles will fly right over it sure they do oh Friends when the prophet begin to teach us that this message can't be denominated now I understand why because it's an eagle message and every time a man-made chicken or a man-made farmer tries to a me put fences around this message it just flies right over the fence and me because the same message that brother Brandon preached 60 years ago is still alive and well amen because it just keeps flying over every man-made fence over every man-made Creed trying to say the days of Miracles are passed trying to say God don't do those things no more trying to say he don't pour out the Holy Spirit no more am me well do you have the Holy Spirit I mean why because this message can't be denominated but it flew over the fence oh and you're Eagles aren't you how many Eagles are here this morning and me and Satan's try to fence you up and try to limit you Amen to a certain experience and try to hold you down in an oppressive life a life of depression and a life of anxiety but your Eagles oh and you just fly over the fence anden Mama chicken started to tell you that and me you're never going to make it and Me Mama chick and try to say you can't you can't you can't you can't oh but I can't didn't belong in the eagle dictionary and mean I can't might have worked for those chickens but when that eagle re realized who it was it be to say I can I can I can I can I can I can I can make it I can be healed I can be delivered I can go in a Rapture I can understand the word for my day because I'm an eagle I can I can I can and me because it's who I am oh but when that mother Eagle begin to sound it begin to sound forth a voice letting that eagle know I don't belong here I don't belong here I don't belong in this chicken yard I hear something and for the first time in my life it's beginning to make sense why I've always felt this way I don't belong here you see Moses was raised up under pharaoh and he spent a season in the Palace of pharaoh but one day God called him out because he never belonged in Pharaoh's Palace and you might have been raised up under organization you might have been raised up under depression you might might have been raised up under a complex raised up under a fear amen but God there comes a calling out time in your life amen where that voice begins to say you might have been raised up there but you don't belong there I mean you might be there but you don't belong there that's not your identity and then God may have allowed you to go through it for a season and brother comes a calling out time saying come out my children come out of the fear come out of the worry and me come out of the heaviness come out of the darkness come out of lay the sea and come up into Heavenly places with Christ anden come up into the atmospheres where all things are possible God is preparing a people to believe all things you see Exodus 1:1 said that the children of Israel came into Egypt oh before we start this book of Exodus and me before we bring out this whole book the very first verse is telling you amen that these were not called the children of Egypt they were called the children of Israel and they only came into Egypt but they didn't belong in Egypt oh that's letting you know that a mean you are not identified with what you're going through you may be going through Egypt but you are children of Israel oh and you may be going through depression you may be going through the symptoms of this world but you're a child of God and he's saying you don't belong there come out of her my people come out of it and come up come up higher come up into the heavenlies come up into the ATM fears where all things are possible oh lay aside every weight lay aside every sin which does so easily beset you and run this race with amen patience press towards the High Calling brother brandom said you can't look backward and move forward at the same time you've got to forget those things which are behind to press into this High Calling and if you're Looking Backward at the mistakes you've made 10 years ago it's time to forget those things which are behind and press towards a high call calling all the church has built upon High Ambitions and if there's still a deep calling in your heart for more of God there's a deep to respond this morning there's more of God to be had and mean you may be justified but you can be Sanctified you can be filled with the Holy Ghost you can be adopted you see those children of Israel were going through that desert and Joshua had a command him we're going to pass by Esau's Mountain but that's not your inheritance that's he's saying we're going to pass by them and they were not ordained to go where you're going he said your inheritance lays beyond the Jordan your inheritance lays in Jacob's Mountain he said don't fuss with them don't Ste with them how can we make all the Lutheran see it how can we make them see it but oh to you to you who have a deep calling to the Deep to you where amen just to settle down and amen just raising sheep is not enough for you and mean you're here for more than to be a mechanic you're here for more am mean this to be an electrician or just to work on a computer oh you were here to manifest the word for your day to be a Son of God in the image of God you were created for more and if there's a deep calling in the deep and mean there's a deep to respond and say Lord we want to see healing today and Lord tomorrow we want to see missing limbs restored Lord and the next day we want to see our loved ones amongst us Lord I'm not going to stop I'm built upon High Ambitions because I'm an eagle oh and you begin to Fly Above the chatter chatter of the world that old voice just trying to hold you down those old voices of of complex and fears trying to hold you down oh but you realize I don't have to live with this devil's voice amen but you begin to Flap those wings and set your wings to The Winds of the word of God and those winds are not up and down you don't flop up one day and down the next but when you really learn to set your wings if you do flop it doesn't mean you're not an eagle but there's different phases that eagle begins to mature he begins to learn how to set his wings oh and all of a sudden that little flopping anden you you see them sometimes and I don't have any problem with that at all but sometimes you see him come to the altar time after time again and and I I say come come on on keep coming but oh how we love to see that stability come into a life and all a sudden oh they begin to recognize I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God and they begin to set their wings oh and they begin to soar up into those atmospheres where all things are possible and they might fall down again oh maybe they'll come a time oh they need to get back to that Altar and rededicate and get their eyes cleaned again maybe there come a time where they need to get back down oh they get in that Valley and they begin to come through those phases but oh just a few short days and because they're an eagle they'll be back up in that Heavenly because that's where they belong and when you belong in your position as a son or daughter of God that's where you belong and if you're not there you'll never be satisfied that's right you'll never be satisfied with just a halfway life you'll never be satisfied if God's calling you to preach God's calling you to sing God's calling you to be a Son of God or daughter of God then you'll never be satisfied until you reach that calling and you begin to surrender to what he's calling you to and me you be you fighting with it you're fussing with it you're saying Lord I don't want to do it I I don't want to give up this I don't want to give up that I don't want to do that Lord oh but he begins to break that wheel and he begins to stir that Nest he says no if you're not going to go on your own I'll stir the nest because I will not leave you here you belong in the skies you belong in that position I will not let you stay here I'll stir the nest if I have to I'll kick you out and let you have a test fall if I have to oh but if you fall I'll catch you on my wings I'll bear you up again I'll not let you stay there am me because you're a heaven born bird anden and the eagle isn't just born up high but it belongs in the skies and mean you see it was heaven born and it's heavenbound because it's an eagle and so if the eagle finds itself down in the trial am mean that's not where he came from and that's not where he's going it's just the season that he's found himself in and oh you might be going through a hard week or a hard season but it's the hardest it's it's the lowest you can get friends if you're an eagle this hard season you're going through it's the lowest you can get because you came from God and you're going back back to God and this little chicken yard experience that you might be in it's just a season oh but it's the lowest you can go hallu he's calling you up and can we stand to our feet this morning yes he is I believe it's time for the church to come up higher oh come into those atmospheres all the move is on for the bride the prophet would say thus sayith the Lord to those of you who really believe this he said we're entering another age we're entering the raptured age oh because Le to seea we might be in it but we're not of it that's not where your soul belongs your soul is not meant to be in the spirit of the L to see and age be lukewarm formal and Powerless that's not the spirit you want to get into you want to get in the spirit of an eagle age oh he's not just your Exodus he's your door that open door where he's saying come up out of her my people and come up higher come into Heavenly places he's your Exodus it's more than a book friends it's a person a and that person is here this morning he's your Exodus from sickness to health he's your Exodus from bondage to Liberty he's your Exodus and if he's calling you out he's got somewhere to take you oh time to get into the vision time to let this message become your vision time to get in the vision and start walking oh start soaring brother Bram said the next breath he said it's more than three minutes I mean less than three minutes s say less than it's three minutes for the earth to be blowed up in time less than that he said the next breath of Jehovah is come out of it my people come up higher amen and who is this he said the world's cry the world cries out who is this what is this where did it come from it's the Holy Spirit Come From God for what purpose to prepare a people give them a Heavenly atmosphere a desire to come up higher oh he said that you must always look where you're going not where you've been come up higher do you have that desire this morning Lord I want to come up higher I'm tired of that old Earthbound chatter chatter I'm tired of that Old Devil whispering in my ear but you know what if you just set your wings to the infallible word of God oh that chicken can't follow you there that Old Pine squirrel can't follow you there just like those uncircumcised Philistines could not follow those children of Israel through that Red Sea Satan cannot follow you where you're going church oh he cannot go because if if he wanted to follow you where you're going he'd have to get under that blood and receive the Holy Ghost and then he'd be your brother amen you might feel him now and mean you might be going through your weeks and you feel that old tempter amen but he can only follow you so long oh but one of these days he'll be left here and you'll be caught up oh into a new body friends you can get into that place that your kind of Glory where you're soundproof cut off from that world cut off from that old squirrel oh that old confusion it's my desire Lord Lift Me Up on Higher Ground I wonder could we sing that this morning I I can't sing if the
