[34:19] are just thankful I for brother Alex and
[34:22] brother Stephen and why they did a
[34:24] tremendous job
[34:25] and uh you know I I just hearing all the
[34:29] good reports well that just I'm just
[34:32] thankful
[34:33] amen you know when uh when even our um
[34:37] our children and our family go and
[34:40] you know there's things that I see like
[34:42] where doctors or different ones can help

[34:47] really like this teacher
[34:49] you know Zachary has certain ones that

[35:06] amen and I think it's tremendous to be
[35:09] able to look Beyond a veil and be able
[35:13] to recognize God
[35:15] you know that's why when we look at it
[35:18] when the Lord Jesus stepped out on the
[35:19] road to Emmaus
[35:21] he began to walk with him their eyes
[35:23] were holding from him they didn't know
[35:26] it was him
[35:27] but he began to take his word
[35:29] and began to open his word
[35:32] their hearts begin to burn
[35:34] and then
[35:36] when he made as though he was going to
[35:38] go on the constrained said father said
[35:40] come stay with us
[35:42] he was still a stranger but they were
[35:43] bidding this stranger who had spoke to
[35:46] them and it so stirred their hearts no
[35:49] you've got to come in
[35:51] and when they invited him in
[35:54] then he made known
[35:56] who he was
[35:59] and through all of that he's the god
[36:01] that takes care of his word
[36:04] I'm glad he's watching over his word
[36:05] aren't you glad he's watching over over
[36:08] us and I love that scripture in the
[36:11] Psalms David said thou Hast exalted
[36:15] Thy Word
[36:17] above thy name
[36:19] and yet his name is called the word of
[36:23] God
[36:23] [Music]
[36:25] never varies never changes he's the same
[36:29] yesterday a day and forever
[36:31] aren't you glad that what he has said
[36:34] he will perform
[36:37] amen and that's the manifestation of his
[36:39] name that's his character that's who
[36:41] he's is
[36:42] so when we say the Lord Jesus Christ we
[36:44] know he's the faithful one
[36:47] amen the high priest our high priest
[36:50] that can be touched by the feeling of
[36:52] our infirmities amen you know when he
[36:55] came and got a hold of Our Lives he
[36:58] wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty
[37:01] he wasn't afraid to roll up his sleeves
[37:03] and go to work on us
[37:05] but he knew what it would take and
[37:07] and not only knew what it would take but
[37:09] how he's still working on us

[40:45] the word of the Lord here this morning
[40:47] amen
[40:51] I want to say as you would turn with me
[40:53] if you would to Second Peter chapter one
[40:55] I just want to say I we didn't get to
[40:58] make many comments but boy I think that
[41:00] that porch is coming along really nicely
[41:04] it's looking really really good and we
[41:07] just so appreciate that and
[41:09] thankful to all the the brothers and the
[41:12] laboring and the work and I know brother
[41:14] Richie has been sneaking over here after
[41:16] his job and doing that and and uh well
[41:20] we just are are thankful to the Lord I
[41:22] know there's some others I don't mean to
[41:23] miss anybody but uh so even if you've
[41:26] held a nail God bless your heart
[41:28] amen and uh so we just everything
[41:31] together and and we we're a body we work
[41:35] together
[41:36] is that right brother Brian I've got
[41:38] just a little bit of just don't cut me
[41:42] out completely
[41:43] but just a little bit of ring here just
[41:45] you if you'll take care of that for me
[41:48] um
[41:49] sorry sometimes I don't know how we
[41:51] there's different adjustments that come
[41:53] and the sound men get blamed if there's
[41:55] anything that goes wrong but
[41:57] uh oh somebody just cut me out
[41:59] completely here so
[42:01] um let's read here in second Peter
[42:04] chapter one and verse 12.
[42:06] and I just want to read just this
[42:09] one verse of scripture here
[42:11] and um just take a little thought from
[42:15] here this morning
[42:17] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[42:21] you always in remembrance of these
[42:23] things though you know them
[42:26] and be established in the present
[42:31] truth
[42:32] I want to just read that again and Peter
[42:35] in these the scriptures that are
[42:37] preceding before here he's talking about
[42:40] a walk with God that is fruitful that's
[42:43] abounding in the grace of God but I just
[42:46] want to draw our attention here this
[42:48] morning in verse 12. where Peter is
[42:51] speaking to them regarding those things
[42:53] and says I will not be negligent to put
[42:55] you always in remembrance of these
[42:57] things how many of you like to be
[42:58] reminded
[43:00] I mean now there's sometimes I sometimes
[43:03] to be reminded of things I'm like I know
[43:05] I see it in front of me it says 35 miles
[43:08] per hour I'm going 35 miles per hour but
[43:10] you know and the turn's coming up I know
[43:12] the turn's coming up here some of you
[43:14] know what I'm referring to but there's
[43:17] times that we are thankful and I tell
[43:19] you when you make the right turn you
[43:21] know or you make the wrong turn you're
[43:22] like where was she at
[43:25] but it was good to be reminded isn't it
[43:28] and you know that's the thing with God
[43:30] God he comes to remind us not that it
[43:34] would become repetitive in where we can
[43:37] just simply repeat it but God comes to
[43:40] stir us up and there's a constant
[43:42] growing and developing in our life but
[43:45] this is where it all originates from
[43:47] though you know them and be established
[43:51] in the present truth and I want to just
[43:54] speak just one word this morning on
[43:56] established
[43:58] established and this word established
[44:01] here if you'll let me just read this
[44:02] before we just offer a word of Prayer
[44:05] it's it's to be established or
[44:08] established or steadfastly set it's to
[44:11] make stable place firmly set fast or fix
[44:16] to set one's face steadfastly remember
[44:19] Jesus when he was going to Calvary he
[44:22] set his face steadfastly those in
[44:24] Samaria got upset is that right
[44:27] but he said his face steadfastly
[44:30] keep the face turned it's to strengthen
[44:34] to make firm to render constant and
[44:38] confirm one's mind and that that not
[44:41] only is something that's done initially
[44:43] but this last part and there's no way we
[44:45] can look at this this morning but that
[44:47] continues to take place in our life
[44:50] God continues to establish us
[44:54] continues to make us stronger
[44:58] amen so let's just offer a word of
[45:01] prayer here this morning and I know we
[45:03] all have needs and let's just invite him
[45:05] to come by our way and
[45:07] just speak to us this morning Heavenly
[45:10] follower
[45:11] Lord we are so privileged Lord to God to
[45:16] be gathered together here this morning
[45:18] in your presence we just invite you Lord
[45:22] what a what a lord a wonderful
[45:24] atmosphere oh God and we know that that
[45:27] was not Lord the piano or the organ or
[45:30] any instrument that created that
[45:32] atmosphere but God there's a there's a a
[45:36] praise Lord in the hearts of your
[45:38] children there's a Thanksgiving Lord
[45:41] there's an expectation Lord and father
[45:45] it's you that we've come to Worship in
[45:47] spirit and in truth and Lord you dwell
[45:50] in the Praises of your people and we
[45:53] just invite you Lord this morning that
[45:55] you'll take control of Lord the speaker
[45:58] and the hearing God just move Among Us
[46:01] in a special way there's only one desire
[46:04] that we have is that you'd be glorified
[46:06] and that your word Lord would find its
[46:09] Mark Lord in our hearts and our lives
[46:12] Lord we love you and we thank you now
[46:14] Lord we commit Lord every every doing
[46:17] Lord we committed into your hands Lord
[46:20] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[46:22] Christ amen amen God bless you as you're
[46:25] being seated
[46:27] foreign
[46:29] when we think of this word
[46:32] to be established we recognize that it's
[46:35] something that
[46:37] it's not to be
[46:40] transient and just moved about and so
[46:44] when you think of this all through the
[46:45] scriptures
[46:47] God would always
[46:50] desire and would and would establish his
[46:54] Covenant he would establish his word and
[46:56] that word establishes to worry he
[46:59] confirms it and God God declares himself
[47:02] faithful and you know once God as God
[47:06] declares himself faithful
[47:08] uh that in itself is something that then
[47:11] where there comes an experience of Faith
[47:15] by an experience to believe God for
[47:18] every situation for every need and it's
[47:22] a work of God uh Faith itself is not the
[47:25] work of man it's God's work and so to be
[47:28] established and to think of how that God
[47:30] would his desire would be to bring man
[47:35] to this place of establishment and I
[47:38] want to go to the scriptures because to
[47:40] be established it would lead us here
[47:42] into the scripture of Matthew 11 28 and
[47:45] brother brown or the scripture says come
[47:48] unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
[47:51] laden and I will give you rest take my
[47:55] yoke upon you and learn of me for I am
[47:59] meek and lowly in heart and ye shall
[48:02] find rest unto your souls for my yoke is
[48:07] easy and my burden is light remember God
[48:12] had an objective for Israel that they
[48:16] would come out of Egypt and they would
[48:18] be established in the promised land that
[48:22] would be the rest that would be the type
[48:25] of the Holy Spirit
[48:27] and to to remain there and we realize
[48:30] that that that in itself being a type of
[48:34] what God would do for us to bring us
[48:37] into the promised land of the Holy
[48:39] Spirit to where that we would become
[48:42] established in him
[48:44] established in the word of God and I I
[48:48] want to draw from as we look at this
[48:50] thought I'm going to read here a quite a
[48:54] a a piece out of the message why people
[48:57] are so tossed about and brother Branham
[49:00] is drawing from this here and I want us
[49:02] just to make just to draw from this a
[49:04] few moments brother Brian said I he said
[49:07] he's he was speaking to his wife he says
[49:09] the Christian faith is based solidly
[49:13] upon rest that's right a Christian is
[49:16] not tossed about a Christian doesn't run
[49:19] from place to place a Christian doesn't
[49:22] fuss and fume and worry about things a
[49:26] Christian rest it's all over it's all
[49:29] finished for the believer at Calvary I
[49:33] won't ask you to raise your hand but
[49:34] there's problem there might even be some
[49:36] things this morning that thoughts have
[49:38] come to you with things that you might
[49:40] have tomorrow that could be a little
[49:42] worrisome so it doesn't mean that worry
[49:44] can't come but for a Christian you have
[49:47] something on the inside that's able to
[49:49] tap the worry down
[49:52] that's what a rest is something so that
[49:55] when things do come there is that which
[49:58] is able to put it right back in its
[50:00] place
[50:01] so it's it's all I love this it's all
[50:03] over it's all finished for the believer
[50:05] at Calvary sickness may come
[50:08] disappointments but the Christians at
[50:11] rest knowing this that God's able to
[50:14] keep that which he has performed knowing
[50:18] no matter what the thing is or how it
[50:20] looks there's neither sickness sorrow
[50:23] death there's neither starvation or
[50:26] anything that can separate us from the
[50:29] love of God that's in Jesus Christ we're
[50:32] at rest Just Let The Old Ship toss any
[50:35] way she wants to The Anchor Holds
[50:38] brother REM said I come by on Harbor one
[50:41] time and I seen that we were flying in a
[50:43] plane and you know is when you're in a
[50:45] plane sometimes you can look down and he
[50:47] says coming down low there was a big old
[50:49] ship there and the sails had been let
[50:51] down you know and oh what a storm on the
[50:54] sea she was tossing and I seen that Old
[50:57] Ship there rocking back and forth and
[51:00] some waves that that would go in and
[51:02] some ways that would go under and
[51:04] everything and I said I wonder why that
[51:06] is and a fellow a fellow setting said
[51:09] it's got a sea anchor on it therefore
[51:12] the ship can't sink it can go through
[51:16] the waves but it can't sink because it's
[51:19] anchored he said I said oh praise be to
[51:22] God we got an anchor
[51:25] some waves we can go over
[51:28] some we can go under but regardless if
[51:32] the anchor holds
[51:34] so every wave we're not going to go over
[51:37] some we go under but it doesn't matter
[51:39] the anchor holds
[51:42] it isn't the ship doing the holding it's
[51:45] the anchor doing the holding it isn't
[51:48] what I am or what I will be or what I
[51:52] was it's what he is now and what he did
[51:56] for me and you it ain't what I can do
[51:58] it's what he has done
[52:02] now he's getting into this he'll go
[52:04] right into this of Faith itself
[52:07] my faith doesn't anchor in what the
[52:11] coming meetings will be
[52:13] my faith doesn't rest in any ability
[52:17] that I would have or upon what church I
[52:21] should join or what people I should
[52:24] associate with now many scriptures that
[52:27] we could just allude to here and I in
[52:29] many ways I'm just resting on the Holy
[52:31] Spirit to bring them to your attention
[52:32] and this is where that Paul could say in
[52:35] the opening of First Corinthians though
[52:37] I could have a lot of things gifts and
[52:40] everything else but if I do not have the
[52:43] love of God now God's love is not a
[52:46] peachy Philly powder sugary type thing
[52:49] God's love is a love that is based on
[52:52] his word
[52:54] is that right it's a it's a love that
[52:57] comes to minister and to deal with and
[52:59] to address and to meet and to overtake
[53:02] and to transform situations
[53:06] that's what the love of God does you say
[53:09] how do you know that because that's what
[53:11] he did for me
[53:12] is that what he did for you
[53:15] that's what the love of God is
[53:17] so when we see this you notice it
[53:19] doesn't rest upon anything it doesn't
[53:22] rest up on any uh associate or what any
[53:25] gift or anything but my faith anchors
[53:28] and rests entirely upon the finished
[53:32] work of the Lord Jesus Christ already
[53:36] been received God Justified him by
[53:40] raising him from the dead this is my
[53:42] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and
[53:44] God raised him from the dead for our
[53:47] justification the Christian rest in that
[53:51] hope upon the stormy seas
[53:54] sure storms rise all kinds of troubles
[53:58] but were anchored that's all it'll never
[54:02] sink it can't sink
[54:06] remove the anchor and the ship is tossed
[54:10] about
[54:11] remove the anchor and the ship can sink
[54:15] but if the ship the anchor is set it
[54:19] doesn't matter if though it's on the
[54:21] wave under a wave doesn't matter the
[54:24] storms or it's calm the anchor is what
[54:28] holds constant
[54:31] and it's the anchor as Paul said that
[54:33] entereth within the veil Brethren said
[54:36] I've noticed now he draws from this he
[54:37] says I've noticed many Christians in my
[54:40] life to be up and down and I've wondered
[54:43] about that
[54:44] he said you find people who seem to be
[54:47] very religious seem to have such a deep
[54:50] desire and daily they search and hunt
[54:55] and seek for God and never come to any
[54:59] settlement of any kind to where they
[55:02] could ever be settled or Anchored In
[55:06] Christ
[55:07] what's he talking about being
[55:09] established
[55:11] and this I have learned to be an
[55:13] experience that is people of
[55:16] intellectuals he said now speaking of
[55:18] this there's two different types of
[55:20] Christianity he said seems strange and
[55:23] he can just follow me here he says I I
[55:25] don't want to say two different types
[55:26] but I want to say two different phases
[55:29] would be a better word to use not two
[55:32] types two phases the same Christianity
[55:35] but two phases of it and one of them is
[55:39] an intellectual or a mental conception
[55:42] of what God has said in his word and of
[55:44] Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge and
[55:48] the other is an ex experimental
[55:50] experience that God has given the man in
[55:54] his heart
[55:56] so intellects and then an experience
[55:58] that God gives a man in his heart the
[56:01] one intellectually is hungering he's
[56:05] feasting on God but his Feast doesn't
[56:09] hold out
[56:10] what's further I'm talking about when
[56:12] they would go to gather the manna
[56:15] right every morning they had together
[56:17] the manna and the Manna was coming down
[56:20] from heaven
[56:22] but that Manna they have were to eat of
[56:24] that Manna and then whatever they didn't
[56:27] eat that day than they were to burn that
[56:30] is that right that manner though if they
[56:33] kept it
[56:35] then it would canker and get worms in it
[56:39] is that right
[56:41] but the manna that fell on the very
[56:43] first day the first time the Mana ever
[56:45] fell when Aaron was instructed to go get
[56:48] a golden Homer of that Manna and take it
[56:52] into the holiest of holies that Manna
[56:56] never corrupted or conquered
[56:59] what is the manner a type of the Holy
[57:02] Ghost
[57:03] and you can look and say well the Holy
[57:05] Ghost that's God how could that ever
[57:07] conquer it matters where it's at if it's
[57:11] only on the flesh it'll go away
[57:14] if it's only in the spirit realm the
[57:17] mind the intellects it'll go away but if
[57:21] it's there in the soul in that
[57:23] predestinated Omer golden Homer of
[57:27] almighty God there is a keeping power of
[57:31] the Holy Spirit a seal of the Living God
[57:34] an anchor an experience an establishment
[57:38] that no matter what's going on your
[57:41] experience is the same today as it was
[57:44] yesterday your experience is the same
[57:47] tomorrow as it was a year ago
[57:50] what is it because it's an experience of
[57:53] the Holy Ghost in the depth of the Soul
[57:57] let me just say this to you
[57:59] many times people can have experiences
[58:02] and it has not reached the depth of
[58:05] their soul yet
[58:06] don't throw those experiences away
[58:12] those EXP
[58:15] [Applause]
[58:20] hears about you and he wants to do for
[58:23] you
[58:24] see I want scripture on that Jacob when
[58:26] he left to go to uh the land of of
[58:31] Rebecca's Kindred and to go there he
[58:35] meets God in Bethel the first time
[58:38] but he's not changed but God lets him
[58:41] know I'm the god
[58:43] that's your daddy talked about
[58:46] and the god that's your father Abraham
[58:49] talked about
[58:50] I am God what you've heard about what
[58:53] you know about I'm letting you know I'm
[58:55] that God that they talked about that
[58:59] presence that you sensed when Jacob when
[59:02] your father would or or Abraham or Isaac
[59:05] would talk about I want you to know
[59:07] that's who I am I am that God and I'm
[59:10] mindful of you and I'll bring you back
[59:12] to this place
[59:15] and Jacob came back to that place years
[59:18] later right 14 years later and he met
[59:21] God face to face and he wrestled it out
[59:25] right it went then into the depths of
[59:28] experience
[59:30] an establishment in his life did Jacob
[59:33] after that moment did was was Jacob the
[59:38] same no Jacob was changed
[59:42] is that right was Jacob then a perfect
[59:45] man as far as in all of his doings no I
[59:49] don't have time in the scripture to go
[59:50] through that but there's one thing that
[59:53] was for sure he had met God and he was
[59:56] established in the word of God and When
[59:58] Storms would tried to come and at
[1:00:00] different times you'll see where Jacob
[1:00:02] the Bible say in Jacob then another
[1:00:04] times it'll say Israel what is it it's
[1:00:06] the Israel is the part on the inside
[1:00:09] that has been redeemed by the strong one
[1:00:15] that's why there's got to be a
[1:00:16] establishment in our life that then
[1:00:19] brings all things subject
[1:00:23] to himself
[1:00:25] it's established
[1:00:28] so he says the other one seems to have
[1:00:31] Victory all the time
[1:00:33] there's nothing bothers them these
[1:00:36] memories just we just ready talked about
[1:00:37] the intellectual and then he talks about
[1:00:39] this one he says the woman experience
[1:00:41] had seems to have Victory all the time
[1:00:43] there's nothing bothers them they're
[1:00:45] just as solid and anchored as they can
[1:00:47] be no trials no storms bother them at
[1:00:51] all but they seem to have something
[1:00:52] about them that people who are
[1:00:55] Christians and trying to live for God
[1:00:57] admire that type of Christian and I've
[1:01:00] often wondered Lord what is it that
[1:01:03] these people have that others crave so
[1:01:06] much for and yet seen to fail to get it
[1:01:11] and I know that's a great Christian of
[1:01:13] all uh questions sorry of all of our
[1:01:16] hearts who have served Christ
[1:01:18] and I've never seen a person yet that
[1:01:20] ever once comes to him excepting
[1:01:23] afterwards they their life never seemed
[1:01:26] right to them anymore if they ever left
[1:01:30] Christ
[1:01:32] I just want to say that within this
[1:01:36] God has a provided way
[1:01:40] and I think of the scripture in the book
[1:01:43] of Jeremiah when here Israel is
[1:01:45] preparing to go into bondage and
[1:01:47] Jeremiah
[1:01:48] under the unction of the Holy Spirit God
[1:01:52] is is speaking to Israel of what they
[1:01:55] should ask for
[1:01:57] and when he's telling them ask for the
[1:02:00] old
[1:02:02] I don't have that up there I'm just
[1:02:04] referencing that as it's coming to me
[1:02:06] ask for the Old Paths
[1:02:08] ask for the paths to be restored what
[1:02:11] paths are we talking about we're not
[1:02:13] talking about dirt paths we're talking
[1:02:15] about the path of righteousness the path
[1:02:18] of Holiness the path that we're and has
[1:02:21] become obscure ask for those Old Paths
[1:02:23] let me just say this to you and I that
[1:02:26] this is something that God in his grace
[1:02:28] God made a promise to himself because he
[1:02:32] was not him saying to David you shall
[1:02:35] discover but he says David by
[1:02:37] inspiration said thou Wilt show me the
[1:02:43] path of life
[1:02:44] so it shows that the Old Paths are
[1:02:48] revealed by the person of almighty God
[1:02:52] thou Wilt show me the path of life
[1:02:57] so the Old Paths God knew even though in
[1:03:00] our heart there could be a craving there
[1:03:03] could be a longing and trying to find
[1:03:05] this and not getting settled here and
[1:03:07] trying to find this and not getting
[1:03:09] settled here there's only one place of
[1:03:11] settlement for a real believer and I'm
[1:03:14] talking about even as you wondered
[1:03:16] throughout the world you might have
[1:03:18] wondered through church through church
[1:03:20] from denomination to denomination but if
[1:03:23] you are ordained to be in the land of
[1:03:27] promise there is no satisfaction outside
[1:03:32] of the word of God
[1:03:35] because it's not a man that is calling
[1:03:39] you
[1:03:39] it's not a man that put that desire in
[1:03:42] you
[1:03:44] Sunday school thank God for it it didn't
[1:03:46] put it in you thank God for daddies and
[1:03:49] mommies and devotion but they didn't put
[1:03:51] it in you God put that desire in you and
[1:03:55] God knew you would be here in this hour
[1:03:57] can I just say what the prophet said he
[1:04:00] said God knew you would want the Holy
[1:04:03] Ghost
[1:04:04] how did he know that because you always
[1:04:07] were one of his
[1:04:11] Hallelujah
[1:04:14] glory be to God he knew it and he made a
[1:04:18] way that you would be able to receive it
[1:04:23] God's provided way
[1:04:26] it's God working it was God hearing
[1:04:28] through his word there was a call coming
[1:04:31] out of our life restore the Old Paths oh
[1:04:34] God
[1:04:36] Hallelujah and so when we see this to be
[1:04:40] established I want to go in the
[1:04:42] scriptures that we could to Colossians
[1:04:44] chapter 1. and look here for a few
[1:04:47] moments in verse 21. and I want you to
[1:04:50] watch this purpose and this objective
[1:04:52] that God has for our lives it's
[1:04:57] something that it moves it moves and has
[1:04:59] moved from the mind of God it is
[1:05:03] pulsated from the heart of God it came
[1:05:07] down that it it brought forth our lovely
[1:05:10] Lord Jesus Christ who paid the price in
[1:05:13] Redemption and it now pulsates through a
[1:05:17] body of believers
[1:05:19] and you verse 21 that were sometime
[1:05:22] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[1:05:26] Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled
[1:05:30] in the body of his flesh through death
[1:05:32] to present you holy and unblameable and
[1:05:36] unreprovable in his sight this is his
[1:05:40] working
[1:05:45] you can look at your life and say you
[1:05:48] don't know what I have in my life let me
[1:05:50] just tell you he ain't looking at you
[1:05:52] when he's dealing with you because if
[1:05:55] he's looking at you and he took into
[1:05:57] account all of our sin or every
[1:06:00] attribute and all unbelief he'd never
[1:06:02] deal with this but he's looking at a
[1:06:05] perfect sacrifice and that's why the
[1:06:07] word can come with such Authority
[1:06:09] beloved now we are the sons of God
[1:06:15] you don't all of a sudden come to a
[1:06:17] place and then he starts talking to you
[1:06:19] like a son or daughter of God he is
[1:06:21] bringing a word that is calling you and
[1:06:24] I to sonship to adoption as Sons and
[1:06:27] Daughters of God he's not all of us he's
[1:06:30] not calling you a pig and then turning
[1:06:32] around and calling you a sheep he's
[1:06:34] letting you know don't allow that nature
[1:06:36] of a pig to rule over you you're a sheep
[1:06:39] you ordained to be a sheep Let the word
[1:06:42] of God have the right away
[1:06:45] your doubt throw them down don't try to
[1:06:48] change it throw it down
[1:06:50] in his presence
[1:06:53] Hallelujah
[1:06:55] glory be to God I tell you friends
[1:06:58] that's why with the Gospel of Jesus
[1:07:00] Christ we can stand because it's the
[1:07:02] power of God unto salvation it is power
[1:07:05] to undo holds it has power to dismantle
[1:07:08] every form of Darkness it has power to
[1:07:11] overthrow all unbelief it has power to
[1:07:14] consume every attribute of sin
[1:07:18] glory be to God
[1:07:20] a few now this is verse 23 let's move
[1:07:23] into this moment if you continue
[1:07:27] this is very important
[1:07:30] in the faith
[1:07:32] grounded
[1:07:34] and settled
[1:07:36] and be not moved away from the hope of
[1:07:39] the Gospel
[1:07:41] so there's a continuance
[1:07:43] just like when God takes a hold of a
[1:07:45] life
[1:07:47] justification they repent of their sins
[1:07:50] still
[1:07:51] the thing on the inside that brought
[1:07:53] forth all the habits still there
[1:07:56] right
[1:07:58] then you walk on with the word you begin
[1:08:00] to apply the blood how do I apply the
[1:08:02] blood you apply the word
[1:08:05] you apply it to your life
[1:08:07] there's things that you can see in your
[1:08:10] life and the Holy Spirit will call it
[1:08:12] out and identify those things sometimes
[1:08:14] we'll call it straight out other times
[1:08:15] it's just right there to you personally
[1:08:17] without even anything being said what do
[1:08:19] I do at that moment you take a hold of
[1:08:22] the word apply it to your life and say
[1:08:24] Lord I lay it down under for the glory
[1:08:28] of God now Lord clean it out of My Heart
[1:08:30] Lord
[1:08:32] what is that continuing
[1:08:34] continuing
[1:08:36] amen being in prayer with that listen
[1:08:39] this is a journey and a walk between you
[1:08:42] and God I know I'm speaking to all
[1:08:44] across the board but we're interested in
[1:08:47] one thing establishment and how the word
[1:08:50] even for lives that have crossed and are
[1:08:52] dwelling in the promised land that we
[1:08:55] continue to be established and grow it
[1:08:57] still takes the applying of the word
[1:09:01] right that's why brother Graham said you
[1:09:03] don't take the token it's the medicine
[1:09:05] and put the medicine on the Shelf you
[1:09:08] take the medicine and take it
[1:09:11] is that right
[1:09:13] glory be to God now if you continue in
[1:09:16] the faith grounded and settled so
[1:09:18] everything that God is doing every work
[1:09:21] of God that he does in your life is to
[1:09:24] further establish you for another move
[1:09:30] David said he's making my feet like
[1:09:32] Heinz feet
[1:09:33] God establishes my Goings
[1:09:36] God does that that's God revealing and
[1:09:38] speaking very personally to our lives
[1:09:40] now and be not moved away from the hope
[1:09:43] of the Gospel which you've heard which
[1:09:46] was preached to every creature which is
[1:09:48] under Heaven whereof Paul I am made a
[1:09:50] minister uh it goes on to say here who
[1:09:54] now rejoice in my sufferings for you and
[1:09:57] fill up that which is behind of the
[1:09:58] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[1:10:01] his body's sake which is the church
[1:10:02] whereof I am made a minister according
[1:10:06] to the dispensation of God which is
[1:10:08] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[1:10:11] of God and then it goes in this is this
[1:10:13] is the Fulfillment of the word of God
[1:10:15] that we're called to even the mystery
[1:10:18] that have been hid from ages and
[1:10:19] generations but now it's made manifest
[1:10:22] to his Saints to whom God would make
[1:10:24] known what is the richest of the glory
[1:10:27] of this mystery among the Gentiles which
[1:10:30] is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:10:34] so the Fulfillment that we are called to
[1:10:37] ordained to is that let Christ be the
[1:10:41] Fulfillment in our life that he would
[1:10:43] fill every fiber of our life but Christ
[1:10:47] would so dwell in our hearts there would
[1:10:50] be an assurance of the expectation of
[1:10:53] Glory that would look Beyond just this
[1:10:56] realm and be able to see that when it's
[1:10:58] all said and done I know in whom I have
[1:11:01] believed and I am persuaded that he is
[1:11:04] able to keep that which I have committed
[1:11:07] unto him against that day
[1:11:10] who we will preach and I notice as he
[1:11:12] moves into this warning every man and
[1:11:16] teaching every man in all wisdom
[1:11:19] that we may present every man perfect
[1:11:23] in Christ Jesus
[1:11:25] and I I think of that as we were
[1:11:28] referencing there to that quote and even
[1:11:30] where Jeremiah restored to us the Old
[1:11:33] Paths that God is God's desire
[1:11:37] is that our lives would be established
[1:11:39] it would be settled we'll be grounded
[1:11:43] remember the Bible says walk in the
[1:11:45] light as he's in the light
[1:11:48] it didn't say skip in the light jump in
[1:11:51] the light running the light it said walk
[1:11:55] because when you walk it's one foot in
[1:11:58] front of another
[1:12:00] and what's God doing as you walk you
[1:12:03] come to that place and you're solid
[1:12:05] right there
[1:12:07] what did I do be solid in what God has
[1:12:10] revealed thus far
[1:12:12] what God has made known be established
[1:12:15] in that right now and say Lord as more
[1:12:18] that he will reveal to you and I because
[1:12:20] God can't reveal anything further unless
[1:12:22] we first walk in obedience to what he's
[1:12:25] already revealed is that right so here
[1:12:29] God opening his way now then we may
[1:12:31] present every man perfect that's a
[1:12:33] completion in Christ Jesus that's that's
[1:12:37] a perfect word of the new birth where
[1:12:39] unto I also labor striving according to
[1:12:43] his working which worketh in me mightily
[1:12:48] so Paul what's motivating you
[1:12:50] is it to have a big congregation no
[1:12:54] is it money
[1:12:55] no
[1:12:57] what's moving what's propelling you on
[1:13:00] what God had in his mind
[1:13:03] what was in his heart
[1:13:05] is pressed right there and the desire is
[1:13:08] is to see Christ
[1:13:10] enthroned in the heart of God's children
[1:13:15] where lives are established that no
[1:13:17] matter what comes or goes that life is
[1:13:20] established in Jesus Christ
[1:13:23] the life is not fixed on anything else
[1:13:25] it's established in Jesus Christ no
[1:13:28] matter if this one goes or that one
[1:13:29] leaves her mama leaves or daddy leaves
[1:13:31] my heart is fixed in God I have met him
[1:13:36] face to face
[1:13:38] established in him
[1:13:41] amen and that's a revelation
[1:13:44] that's not our intellect because if
[1:13:48] intellectually
[1:13:50] this makes sense
[1:13:52] there'll be something else come wrong
[1:13:55] that will intellectually seem to make
[1:13:58] better sense
[1:14:01] but remember every every every word that
[1:14:05] comes to you is a word that's coming not
[1:14:09] for your reasoning it's coming for your
[1:14:11] soul
[1:14:13] I want to walk under that word that
[1:14:15] brings Liberty a word of redemption a
[1:14:19] word of authority not a word that makes
[1:14:21] allowances
[1:14:24] not a word that makes excuses because
[1:14:26] that's not the word of God that's the
[1:14:28] word of man
[1:14:31] is that right
[1:14:32] so now to think of this here there is a
[1:14:35] fountain oh uh a fountain another man
[1:14:39] with references here and I just want to
[1:14:40] paraphrase it there's a fountain that's
[1:14:42] open in the House of David
[1:14:45] there's a fountain that's open in in the
[1:14:48] revealed word The Word of Promise in
[1:14:50] this hour a fountain that can take care
[1:14:52] of all cleanliness all all in Purity
[1:14:54] it'll take care of everything what will
[1:14:57] do that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:15:01] amen you can go in one way when commens
[1:15:05] will go in Sinners you'll come out saved
[1:15:07] you'll go in sick you'll come out well
[1:15:09] going downtrodden come out disheartened
[1:15:12] weary tossed about by every little thing
[1:15:14] and you'll come out on the other side
[1:15:15] established
[1:15:18] that's the power of the blood of Jesus
[1:15:21] Christ that's the power of the holy
[1:15:23] ghost moving through amen the revealed
[1:15:27] word in this hour
[1:15:29] now notice what Paul would say in Romans
[1:15:31] 16 25. now to him
[1:15:36] that is of power
[1:15:38] to establish you according to my gospel
[1:15:42] and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[1:15:45] according to the revelation of the
[1:15:47] mystery which was Kept Secret since the
[1:15:49] world began I want you to notice Paul
[1:15:52] here he is even asserting and then I
[1:15:55] think it's the chapter before this and
[1:15:57] he speaks of how that of the ministering
[1:15:59] of the word that has been committed to
[1:16:01] him to the Gentiles that the offering up
[1:16:05] might be acceptable unto God Sanctified
[1:16:08] by the Holy Ghost let me just say this
[1:16:12] there is no other gospel than the Gospel
[1:16:14] of Jesus Christ and that gospel was
[1:16:17] committed to Paul so any other thing
[1:16:21] that is to pattern or line up must match
[1:16:24] that pattern that was given it was a
[1:16:27] pattern that points back to the
[1:16:29] Fulfillment from before the foundation
[1:16:31] of the world and that word has never
[1:16:34] diminished that word cannot be changed
[1:16:37] men have tried to change it let me just
[1:16:39] tell you something if man would just be
[1:16:41] honest and say I don't have the power to
[1:16:44] live it but I need to meet God who gave
[1:16:47] this word instead of making excuses for
[1:16:49] why I can't live it why I can't walk in
[1:16:52] Victory I believe God will come down I
[1:16:55] don't want to believe it I know God will
[1:16:57] come down and make his word known
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:01] oh my I say God let all the pretending
[1:17:04] and everything else and act in
[1:17:06] phariseeism and everything else be put
[1:17:08] aside God just once Honest Hearts
[1:17:10] that'll stand right there and call him
[1:17:12] on the scene and if you can't you never
[1:17:14] reach that place yet just be honest with
[1:17:17] God and say God send the power just now
[1:17:20] Lord
[1:17:21] [Applause]
[1:17:23] oh my to him
[1:17:26] Paul might have been the vessel but it's
[1:17:28] him the Lord Jesus that has power to
[1:17:31] establish you according to my gospel and
[1:17:34] the preaching of Jesus Christ according
[1:17:36] to the revelation of the mystery which
[1:17:38] was Kept Secret since the world began
[1:17:41] aren't you glad it's no longer a secret
[1:17:44] see when things are secret you could
[1:17:45] guess at it
[1:17:47] you could probe at it but when the
[1:17:49] secret is revealed the silence is broken
[1:17:53] right there's no more guessing it's now
[1:17:55] in plain view
[1:17:56] so when that which is in plain view then
[1:17:59] you can have a certainty upon your
[1:18:02] approach and to know that what God has
[1:18:06] said and he sounded that to my heart I
[1:18:09] can act upon that word by the authority
[1:18:11] of the voice that is speaking to me
[1:18:15] but now verse 26 let me get here but now
[1:18:18] it's made manifest and by the scriptures
[1:18:19] of the prophets according to the
[1:18:21] Commandment of the Everlasting God made
[1:18:24] known to All Nations
[1:18:26] for The Obedience of Faith to God only
[1:18:29] wise be glory through Jesus Christ
[1:18:31] forever
[1:18:33] now I don't I don't have this but I want
[1:18:35] to refer to it
[1:18:37] remember when Paul came to thee
[1:18:39] Philippian Jailer pardon me
[1:18:42] and remember the Philippine General the
[1:18:44] walls you know we were shaking down
[1:18:48] the Philippian Jailer asked Paul
[1:18:51] there was something about it God knew
[1:18:53] there was a predestinated seed down
[1:18:55] there
[1:18:56] true
[1:18:58] what knew that
[1:19:00] that's why that's why even Paul I can't
[1:19:02] go into all that the predestinated oil
[1:19:04] or orchestration of God but here's the
[1:19:06] Philippian Jailer he comes out of there
[1:19:09] and he asked them the question what must
[1:19:11] I do to be saved
[1:19:15] what must I do
[1:19:17] you see the scripture said all all the
[1:19:21] father has given me will come to me
[1:19:24] the scripture I read here in the
[1:19:25] beginning and Matthew come unto me
[1:19:30] oh you better have relating and I'll
[1:19:33] give you rest
[1:19:34] what's he saying come unto me get to him
[1:19:39] right Revenge said it's like offering
[1:19:42] coconuts on a tree and we built the
[1:19:44] fence so high you got to do this quit
[1:19:46] doing this quit doing this quit doing
[1:19:47] this we believe in Holiness we believe
[1:19:50] in approaching the things of God because
[1:19:52] sometimes a life can't understand why am
[1:19:54] I not getting anywhere because if you're
[1:19:56] not repentive in your heart you can't
[1:19:58] get anywhere with God but when the Holy
[1:20:01] Spirit strikes your heart come unto me
[1:20:03] all you that are heavy laden let go and
[1:20:06] let the holy spirit that is drawing you
[1:20:09] let me tell you has your leg go in that
[1:20:11] moment you'll find out that every hold
[1:20:13] of unbelief will let go of your life why
[1:20:16] because the power of the Lord is present
[1:20:19] to bring healing in your life
[1:20:23] not what must I stop doing what just
[1:20:26] believe
[1:20:29] it's like trying to take all the leaves
[1:20:31] off the tree that's just you
[1:20:35] but get down to the root of it
[1:20:38] say God deal with the root of it Lord
[1:20:42] come to him get to him move to him
[1:20:46] amen and he'll take care of that work
[1:20:48] and that's why brother random says Paul
[1:20:51] told him believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:20:53] Christ and thou shalt be saved he said
[1:20:56] get the faith of God back in the people
[1:20:59] so they'll know what to do and how to
[1:21:01] act
[1:21:03] Faith brings you back to a place do you
[1:21:06] know what to do and how to act
[1:21:10] sure I believe listen John laid the
[1:21:13] standard in his word there's Holiness is
[1:21:15] Holiness was not a Bible doctrine that
[1:21:17] brother Branham came up with
[1:21:19] Holiness has always been in the word
[1:21:21] is that right it's been restored in this
[1:21:24] hour
[1:21:24] this is an hour of restoration it's an
[1:21:27] hour of divine Separation by the Holy
[1:21:30] Spirit dwelling in vessels that he has
[1:21:33] chosen or ordained and assembled to
[1:21:36] himself it has always been and he does
[1:21:38] have to remind us there is things that's
[1:21:40] called out but I believe as a person
[1:21:43] gets close to God and they're looking to
[1:21:45] God it will affect your wardrobe it'll
[1:21:48] affect your attitude it'll affect your
[1:21:50] outlook on life why because it is the
[1:21:53] power of God unto salvation it changes a
[1:21:57] person's life what is it it's getting
[1:21:59] close to the faith of God
[1:22:02] and it'll influence how to act
[1:22:06] Hallelujah that's the face that's that
[1:22:09] that's the face that I want my book in
[1:22:10] or the book I want my face in I'll get
[1:22:13] it right there sometime
[1:22:14] right I don't want to be checking out
[1:22:16] what the current styles are and what
[1:22:18] this and I Lord I want my life to match
[1:22:20] your word
[1:22:22] I don't want to match the world I don't
[1:22:24] want to match the world I want to match
[1:22:26] the word of God
[1:22:30] is that right
[1:22:32] so the objective
[1:22:35] of faith
[1:22:37] is a settledness
[1:22:39] is to be at rest
[1:22:44] is to be at rest
[1:22:46] and that don't mean snoozing
[1:22:48] it means to be at rest in other words
[1:22:51] I'm settled
[1:22:54] there's nothing between I
[1:22:56] and my savior
[1:22:58] it's settled
[1:23:01] it's settled and you know that's God's
[1:23:04] desire it's not it listen that's not
[1:23:06] your desire it's God's desire
[1:23:09] because you are ordained to be a son and
[1:23:11] daughter of God and God Wants You
[1:23:13] operating
[1:23:15] with an authority
[1:23:17] and that comes by is being established
[1:23:21] that's why Brethren could make this this
[1:23:23] statement I'm just going to refer to a
[1:23:24] few places
[1:23:26] Faith itself he said doesn't come
[1:23:29] by fasting
[1:23:32] Faith doesn't come by praying or reading
[1:23:34] a book
[1:23:36] all of that's good
[1:23:37] but faith comes by a settled something
[1:23:41] in the human heart
[1:23:43] see it's a settled faith is a settled
[1:23:46] something
[1:23:47] it's not something that's worked up
[1:23:50] but it's settled
[1:23:53] I want you to think of this
[1:23:55] in the just for a moment as we read
[1:23:59] Psalms
[1:24:00] 119 verse 89.
[1:24:05] in Psalms 118 Verse 89.
[1:24:08] I got to looking this up on the med and
[1:24:11] today or I don't know if I'm saying it
[1:24:12] right but I'm not going to go into all
[1:24:14] that but I just got to just sometimes
[1:24:16] you're drawn to certain things I think
[1:24:18] I'm going to look this up here and I
[1:24:19] just feel impressed to do so but uh
[1:24:22] you know we all have well I don't want
[1:24:24] to say we all
[1:24:25] you know you have watches you have we
[1:24:27] have calendars we have things to keep
[1:24:28] time and
[1:24:30] you know when it comes to turning back
[1:24:32] our clocks or moving them forward and
[1:24:34] this isn't scriptural but this is just
[1:24:37] my thoughts my opinion I wish they just
[1:24:39] stopped that stuff and let's just let's
[1:24:41] just stay the same but I'm glad that we
[1:24:43] have our cell phones or just they go
[1:24:45] ahead and kick forward or they kick back
[1:24:47] and you know you don't have to go I mean
[1:24:49] you still have to go around the house
[1:24:49] and send all the rest of the clocks
[1:24:51] right now but uh you know there's
[1:24:52] something that with the word of God no
[1:24:56] matter what else goes on it remains
[1:24:58] constant
[1:25:00] it's always right on time
[1:25:02] right God has said it the Bible said
[1:25:05] that the heavens declare his handiwork
[1:25:09] right God's first Bible was wrote in the
[1:25:11] heavens when God spoke to job remember
[1:25:14] he refers him to even the constellations
[1:25:18] even to him who has the Seven Stars in
[1:25:21] his hand
[1:25:22] speaks in those manners
[1:25:24] and so here in Psalms 119 verse 89 I
[1:25:29] want you to see this forever O Lord
[1:25:33] Thy word is settled in heaven
[1:25:36] I love that
[1:25:38] it was already before he ever spoke it
[1:25:41] it was already settled
[1:25:43] in the mind of God it was already
[1:25:45] settled
[1:25:46] right the lamb Revelations 13 8 the lamb
[1:25:50] that was slain in the mind of God before
[1:25:53] the foundation of the world
[1:25:55] Ephesians 1 he had chosen Us in him when
[1:25:59] before the foundation of the world why
[1:26:02] we were in him
[1:26:03] we were part of this genus we were a
[1:26:06] part of him
[1:26:08] write his word has always been settled
[1:26:11] in heaven so God's not here on Earth
[1:26:15] like an author of a book in this time
[1:26:18] that has to submit his work and they
[1:26:21] edit it send it back or they reject it
[1:26:24] and then you have to send it back and
[1:26:26] edit it and send it back and take this
[1:26:28] person out no no God's word is settled
[1:26:32] and God has not asked anybody to edit
[1:26:35] his work
[1:26:38] man have tried to edit it but when you
[1:26:40] added it you're taking out part of God
[1:26:47] oh Hallelujah forever oh Lord Thy word
[1:26:51] is settled in heaven so if it was
[1:26:54] settled in heaven
[1:26:56] how could it not be settled
[1:26:59] in Earth
[1:27:01] that will be done
[1:27:04] in Earth even as it is in heaven
[1:27:08] Lord lead me to that same settledness
[1:27:12] that when you spoke it what are you
[1:27:14] asking Lord thy faith come Lord the same
[1:27:18] faith that said let there be and stood
[1:27:21] back and believed his own word
[1:27:24] let it be in this earth Lord
[1:27:28] forever O Lord Thy word is settled in
[1:27:31] heaven thy faithfulness is unto all
[1:27:33] generations thou Hast establish the
[1:27:37] Earth and it abideth
[1:27:40] there's been a lot of changing kingdoms
[1:27:42] a lot of changing influences but the
[1:27:45] Earth
[1:27:46] Still Remains the Same go away right
[1:27:49] even the stars and the moons and they
[1:27:50] can do all these predictions but you'll
[1:27:52] never find a timepiece like it
[1:27:55] right there's nobody out there you know
[1:27:57] standing out here on the lake and saying
[1:27:59] okay Tides go back
[1:28:02] right then nobody says Hey Tides come in
[1:28:04] nobody God has it already set up
[1:28:09] do you see God
[1:28:12] everything is set for our life and our
[1:28:15] walk with him the coming the growing the
[1:28:17] rising the following the everything is
[1:28:19] all set by almighty God God has already
[1:28:22] provided for you and I you and I were
[1:28:25] always a part of him and we come here in
[1:28:27] this time he has prepared a place for me
[1:28:31] and we have been this word has been
[1:28:33] ordained and prepared In This Moment
[1:28:36] Christ being revealed it is a place that
[1:28:40] has been prepared
[1:28:42] just as much as God knows there's some
[1:28:44] that like mountains some that like
[1:28:45] planes some men like water and some that
[1:28:48] don't God knew you would love this word
[1:28:50] god knew you would be identified with
[1:28:53] this word god knew you would press
[1:28:55] through all disappointments through all
[1:28:57] frustrations why because you're part of
[1:28:59] him
[1:29:00] [Applause]
[1:29:01] he knows you
[1:29:04] my goodness glory to God
[1:29:08] thou Hast established the Earth
[1:29:10] and it abideth
[1:29:12] they
[1:29:14] continue this day
[1:29:16] according to thine art ordinances
[1:29:19] for all
[1:29:20] are thy servants
[1:29:24] brother Brown comes in here
[1:29:27] and questions and answers 59.
[1:29:33] he says now death means separated and
[1:29:35] some of death in the body okay so my
[1:29:37] death death means separated now
[1:29:39] physically
[1:29:41] we separate from our physical sight
[1:29:43] because that's still sin right we bury
[1:29:46] our loved ones because the body itself
[1:29:48] is still sin
[1:29:49] still get sick
[1:29:51] is that right even even our spirit
[1:29:56] not our soul
[1:29:57] but our human Spirit right there'll be
[1:30:00] there's got to be a fading away of that
[1:30:01] God's already made a way
[1:30:03] you're always made to be a three-room
[1:30:05] house
[1:30:06] right so when the soul itself has as
[1:30:09] that Soul as it moves it moves right
[1:30:12] into that theophany that word body
[1:30:16] that's been right there by you the whole
[1:30:18] time
[1:30:19] is that right it's not traveling far out
[1:30:21] here it's just a step
[1:30:24] come on brother Brandon tells us he says
[1:30:25] right here in this building he said oh
[1:30:27] God let the glorified body that's
[1:30:29] standing beside them give them a charge
[1:30:32] this morning
[1:30:35] and this is why you are no longer
[1:30:37] foreigners and strangers not only to the
[1:30:40] Covenant
[1:30:41] but you now have
[1:30:42] you are and your representation Before
[1:30:45] the Throne of God and here you are you
[1:30:48] theophany is one that was some way far
[1:30:50] away out there is right here
[1:30:55] glory and then then that the orphany
[1:30:58] with the soul and that theophany then
[1:31:01] will come forth a glorified body a human
[1:31:03] body in a glorified condition not made
[1:31:05] of that between a man and woman but it
[1:31:08] will be that which will be by the word
[1:31:10] of God will we look the same we will
[1:31:12] look according to what we were between
[1:31:14] 18 and 25.
[1:31:17] come on God already had his family album
[1:31:20] set before the foundation of the world
[1:31:22] it's not like you and I finding out
[1:31:24] about our children and watching them
[1:31:26] grow God already took a picture of you
[1:31:29] when you were in your Perfection and
[1:31:31] that's why this word is calling you to
[1:31:33] that same Perfection he's not looking at
[1:31:36] what you are he's looking at his word
[1:31:39] he's looking at his word and he's
[1:31:42] speaking the blessings over your life
[1:31:46] what's happening with that come up
[1:31:48] hither come up
[1:31:51] come up because the whole Declaration of
[1:31:53] Revelations 4 come up Heather
[1:31:58] it's become the dwelling place
[1:32:04] Four and Twenty Elders becoming a
[1:32:06] tabernacle of the Living God
[1:32:10] it's a body on display
[1:32:13] surrounded by the Covenant of almighty
[1:32:16] God
[1:32:17] Hallelujah
[1:32:19] blessed be his name
[1:32:21] death means separated now physically we
[1:32:25] separate from our physical sight but
[1:32:27] that's still sin but our spirit is of
[1:32:29] God that can never be separated from God
[1:32:31] because we're a part of God we are
[1:32:34] brought back into that thought of God
[1:32:36] everything that God does is perfect and
[1:32:38] eternal and when God's very thoughts
[1:32:40] went out for a kingdom of people who
[1:32:42] would worship Him them very thoughts is
[1:32:45] eternal
[1:32:46] they can no more perish
[1:32:48] every word of God is eternal
[1:32:50] Jesus said Heaven's on Earth will pass
[1:32:52] away both heavens and earth may pass
[1:32:54] away but my words will never pass away
[1:32:57] they're Eternal with God and if you
[1:33:00] abide in me in my word abide in you we
[1:33:02] become a part of his word part of his
[1:33:05] life for we are flesh of his flesh bone
[1:33:07] of his bone and life of his life then we
[1:33:09] can no more perish than God himself
[1:33:11] could perish that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:33:13] is
[1:33:15] brother Brian talks about a little fella
[1:33:18] by the name right the same same quote of
[1:33:21] from Georgia brother Welch Evans you
[1:33:23] hear brother Brandon talk about brother
[1:33:24] Welch Evans quite a bit
[1:33:27] and this is just one of the places where
[1:33:28] the holy spirit will deal with these
[1:33:31] things
[1:33:32] in the settling Hearts
[1:33:34] establishing lives
[1:33:37] I want you to notice here he says a
[1:33:39] little fella from Georgia brother Evans
[1:33:41] he's been everywhere
[1:33:42] across the country he's a great
[1:33:45] supporter of my good friend oral
[1:33:47] Robertson he supported all his
[1:33:48] television cast down in there and a lot
[1:33:51] of things he did but he said to me the
[1:33:53] other day he said brother Branham
[1:33:55] I went over to brother Jagger's school I
[1:33:57] went everywhere I stayed there for three
[1:34:00] months I was hunting I went to the
[1:34:03] places each one of them and bring it
[1:34:06] back to the same thing I could never get
[1:34:09] a place where I had any Assurance if I
[1:34:13] do this or if I do that and what I might
[1:34:16] do here or am I or am I not see what it
[1:34:19] is is unsettled
[1:34:21] he said I went he went went to there to
[1:34:23] brother World he's looking for something
[1:34:25] to help him become
[1:34:27] established
[1:34:29] because you can't do anything unless
[1:34:30] you're
[1:34:31] you're settled
[1:34:33] right and so let me just say it's
[1:34:36] Satan's desire to keep you in an
[1:34:38] unsettled condition
[1:34:39] it's Satan's desire to even you know and
[1:34:42] some of the ways that he could even try
[1:34:45] to do that is where a person can you
[1:34:47] know they they can feel a release from
[1:34:49] the Forgiveness of their sins but they
[1:34:51] don't go on to the full baptism of the
[1:34:53] Holy Ghost
[1:34:54] and it becomes unsettled what am I doing
[1:34:56] what did I do and did I and it becomes
[1:34:59] unsettled but you see God's desire is to
[1:35:01] settle you let me just say this you're
[1:35:03] not ever going to get settled by going
[1:35:05] away from his voice right
[1:35:08] you have never get settled you can only
[1:35:10] be settled by the word of God
[1:35:13] and if you if your heart is open to the
[1:35:15] word of God God establishes his children
[1:35:20] is that right notice this he went all
[1:35:23] sorts of places trying to get Assurance
[1:35:25] he says and I I didn't have any says
[1:35:28] till I heard your teachings
[1:35:31] said then that settled it once for all
[1:35:36] and this is the scripture that the Holy
[1:35:38] Spirit was so impressing for the
[1:35:40] worshiper wants purged from his sins has
[1:35:44] no more conscience that means no more
[1:35:46] desire of sin he's passed from Death
[1:35:50] unto life and he's got eternal life
[1:35:52] inside of him dwelling there and can no
[1:35:55] more die than God can die exactly the
[1:35:58] Bible he's eternally taken care of
[1:36:00] because he's got eternal life
[1:36:03] why the inside man there's been a
[1:36:06] purging on the inside the old desire the
[1:36:09] old nature it's gone
[1:36:12] right it's not looking you can go to
[1:36:15] you're going to Oral Roberts remember
[1:36:16] brother random takes the same account in
[1:36:18] word made flesh India trip and a man has
[1:36:20] gone here and they tell him you got to
[1:36:22] speak in tongues speaks in tongues he
[1:36:24] says still and then they tell him you
[1:36:25] got to shout he shouts they go over here
[1:36:27] and tell him this tell him that and
[1:36:29] they're telling all sorts of things and
[1:36:30] they told him you know there's such a
[1:36:33] mess in your life I'm paraphrasing that
[1:36:35] you need to see a prophet you need to go
[1:36:38] talk to brother random and brother Brown
[1:36:39] stands right up there and says brother
[1:36:41] you don't need a prophet you just need
[1:36:44] to get straightened out
[1:36:48] and he took him back in his life and he
[1:36:51] says at one time in your life you used
[1:36:53] to love all those things of dancing and
[1:36:55] drinking and all the immorality and you
[1:36:58] know everything we're doing clothing and
[1:37:00] everything else he said but what
[1:37:02] happened to your life he said what
[1:37:04] happened what what took place in your
[1:37:06] life and the man began to rehearse when
[1:37:08] he was reading just a track and he said
[1:37:10] I seen what was in my wife's life he
[1:37:13] said but as I was reading this track
[1:37:15] somebody gave me a track and when I
[1:37:17] pulled it out it said where will you
[1:37:19] spend
[1:37:21] eternity
[1:37:21] now we know that the hell is not Eternal
[1:37:24] but it still was the thought on there
[1:37:26] and as he began to read that he said
[1:37:28] something rolls up in my heart even at
[1:37:31] that moment and repentance and all was
[1:37:33] made and he said there was something
[1:37:35] that came over me and brother Brandon
[1:37:37] said so from that moment he said all the
[1:37:40] rest of those things were gone he said
[1:37:42] yes he said brother you've had it the
[1:37:43] whole time
[1:37:45] and the man jumped off the porch and he
[1:37:48] said my I've had it the whole time
[1:37:52] what established him the word
[1:37:56] faith is not an emotion
[1:37:59] it's not a workup
[1:38:02] faith is a settled something
[1:38:07] that is in the heart
[1:38:09] declaring
[1:38:10] and knowing whom I have believed
[1:38:13] I have passed
[1:38:15] from death
[1:38:16] unto life
[1:38:18] I'm established
[1:38:21] in Jesus Christ
[1:38:22] by his power
[1:38:26] I just invite you this morning if you
[1:38:29] haven't met that God in that way let him
[1:38:31] invite him to establish
[1:38:34] don't don't be too proud don't have too
[1:38:36] much of a put on out front but invite
[1:38:38] him to establish you in that way
[1:38:40] and if there's things that in your life
[1:38:42] that you can look and say at one time my
[1:38:45] life was this way I could look this way
[1:38:47] and and you know don't look at all your
[1:38:49] mistakes you're always going to have
[1:38:51] mistakes
[1:38:53] now Disobedience to the word of God
[1:38:55] that's a different story we got to get
[1:38:57] down to the heart but I'm talking about
[1:38:59] mistakes that are made I'm talking about
[1:39:01] failures that's what the blood of Jesus
[1:39:04] Christ takes care of God's looking on
[1:39:06] your heart
[1:39:08] that's where from your heart
[1:39:10] it's to have that place to where that
[1:39:12] you know
[1:39:14] I've passed from Death unto life
[1:39:17] that God established that
[1:39:19] let God settle that to where your faith
[1:39:23] is settled in the word of God
[1:39:26] it's not an emotion I believe in
[1:39:27] emotions
[1:39:29] I believe in that
[1:39:31] right I believe in that I believe I I
[1:39:33] believe in all of that I give you many
[1:39:36] different quotes on it but but it's not
[1:39:39] faith is not based on that
[1:39:42] faith is based
[1:39:44] on a settledness
[1:39:46] in our heart
[1:39:48] that I know in whom I have believed
[1:39:51] that when everything is said and done
[1:39:53] the music is over the prayer benediction
[1:39:56] has been offered
[1:39:57] you leave out of here
[1:39:59] with a victory in your life
[1:40:03] the victory is not contingent upon the
[1:40:05] organ the piano or anything the victory
[1:40:06] is within you
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:09] amen God bless you let's bow our heads
[1:40:15] hallelujahs our heads are bound
[1:40:19] amen and amen
[1:40:22] I wonder if there'd be a heart here this
[1:40:24] morning and say Lord
[1:40:26] be it unto me Lord
[1:40:27] let it be established Lord in my heart
[1:40:29] let my heart be established in you God
[1:40:33] bless you
[1:40:34] bless you let it be established in you
[1:40:36] Lord God bless you
[1:40:38] amen you know the Bible said let all of
[1:40:40] our doings our goings be established in
[1:40:42] him
[1:40:45] God's desire is for you and me to
[1:40:48] operate
[1:40:49] in a settledness in our life
[1:40:52] to where our lives are settled it's not
[1:40:54] dependent upon anybody else
[1:40:55] our walk is not dependent upon anyone
[1:40:58] else
[1:40:59] but it's centered in Jesus Christ
[1:41:02] it's an anchor
[1:41:04] if that's not been your case in your
[1:41:06] life
[1:41:07] if it's been up if it's been down in and
[1:41:10] out and
[1:41:12] in the world back out of the world let
[1:41:15] him establish you this morning
[1:41:18] but I I just say it to you like this
[1:41:19] invite him to your heart
[1:41:22] don't don't just do it because it's the
[1:41:24] right thing to do do it because he's
[1:41:26] speaking to you
[1:41:28] and say Lord from my heart
[1:41:30] from My Heart Lord
