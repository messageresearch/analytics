[34:50] know you not your own selves how that
[34:53] Jesus Christ is in you except you be
[34:56] reprobates
[34:59] Colossians 1:23 says if ye continue in
[35:02] the faith grounded and settled and be
[35:05] not moved away from the hope of the
[35:07] Gospel which you have heard and which
[35:10] was preached to every creature which is
[35:12] under Heaven whereof I Paul am a
[35:16] minister 2 Timothy 3:1 said this know
[35:19] also in the last days perilous times
[35:22] shall come he speaking about apostasy
[35:27] apostasy is falling away or it is the
[35:31] act of professed Christians who
[35:34] deliberately reject the revealed truth
[35:39] right turn with me if you would to Amos
[35:42] chapter
[35:45] 8 Amos chapter 8 and verse 11 and 12
[36:01] verse 11 says behold the days come
[36:04] sayeth the Lord that I will send a
[36:06] famine in the land not a famine of bread
[36:08] nor a thirst for water but of of hearing
[36:13] the words of the Lord and they shall
[36:17] Wander from sea to Sea and from North
[36:19] even to the East and they shall run to
[36:23] and fro to seek the word of the Lord and
[36:26] shall not find it
[36:29] brother bam says in the curtain of time
[36:31] he said just today I was reading the
[36:34] little place of scripture in Amos
[36:38] 811 and he
[36:42] says if that doesn't fit this nation at
[36:45] this time I don't know where it does
[36:50] fit that's right we don't need bread we
[36:52] got plenty of it we got plenty to eat
[36:55] plenty of clothes to wear nice homes to
[36:57] live in and everything but there's a
[36:59] famine for the hearing of the word of
[37:03] God a man won't know what to believe
[37:07] that's right you're all confused one
[37:10] says this one says that one says this
[37:13] and one says something else base your
[37:17] thoughts on thus sayith the Lord God
[37:21] will confirm
[37:24] it we are living in a Time of apostasy
[37:29] yes we're living in a time of a falling
[37:32] away those that have sojourned with us
[37:36] there's many of them that have turned
[37:39] their back on the revealed
[37:42] truth but that shouldn't Shake us
[37:45] because the scripture says that would
[37:48] take
[37:50] place so when we see those things
[37:53] happening we should Stand Fast in the
[37:56] faith amen Hallelujah not
[37:59] wavering and another thing is don't
[38:03] listen to what they have to
[38:06] say don't read what they
[38:10] write they've got this stuff all over
[38:13] the Internet against the message of the
[38:15] hour the revealed truth don't read it
[38:18] that's
[38:20] right because there are spirits that has
[38:23] caused them to write that
[38:28] base brother Ram said base your thoughts
[38:32] on thus saith the
[38:35] [Applause]
[38:38] Lord the voice of God in this last days
[38:41] brother brandham said and God has
[38:43] promised to meet the need of the hour he
[38:45] always does that we need the voice of
[38:48] God today to meet the need of the hour
[38:51] to meet the time we're living in and
[38:53] after he's promised it we can rest
[38:56] assure that he will keep keep his
[38:58] promise that's the confidence that the
[39:00] believer has in his maker that he
[39:02] promised to meet the need and today one
[39:05] reason the church is in the condition
[39:07] it's in is because there's so many
[39:10] voices so many other voices to attract
[39:13] the church from the voice of god Till
[39:16] It's very doubtful that many would hear
[39:19] the voice of God though it spoke right
[39:22] in their midst they perhaps wouldn't
[39:25] even understand it because if would be a
[39:27] foreign thing to them they've got
[39:30] themselves so much centered on the
[39:33] voices of
[39:35] today there are so many
[39:40] voices and if we notice in our scripture
[39:42] reading the voice of God was foreign to
[39:44] them he's talking about during the time
[39:46] of Eli and when Samuel came as a young
[39:50] boy and remember how that the Lord the
[39:53] god visited uh Samuel and spoke to him
[39:57] and remember he went to Eli Eli told him
[40:00] said go back and lay down see if he'll
[40:02] speak to you
[40:04] again and he says the voice of God was
[40:08] foreign to
[40:09] them and it's become that way again
[40:11] today the voice of God there's so many
[40:14] other
[40:15] voices and then if God promised to give
[40:18] us that and if other voices are contrary
[40:21] to the voice of God then it must be the
[40:24] voice of our enemy to confuse us that we
[40:27] would would not understand the voice of
[40:29] God when it
[40:31] spoke you want answers the answers are
[40:34] in the
[40:36] word you want answers for today they're
[40:39] in the
[40:41] message you're not going to go and find
[40:44] them in books in the
[40:48] library you're not going to find them
[40:50] down at your local
[40:54] bookstore the psychologists of today
[40:57] don't have the
[41:01] answers it's good enough for those that
[41:04] are just people that are wanting to do
[41:07] better or live a moral life or whatever
[41:11] they go by those
[41:14] things but we're looking for more than
[41:17] that that's
[41:20] right there's more than just being a
[41:22] good
[41:24] person there's more than just you know
[41:27] just being a good moral
[41:29] person there's more to it than
[41:32] that there's more to just going to
[41:34] church and professing to be a Christian
[41:39] right we've got to not only hear the
[41:42] truth but we've got to let the truth
[41:45] manifest through
[41:47] US amen that's right yes Lord as the
[41:51] times grow darker the light of the Bride
[41:54] grows stronger
[42:07] so many voices in the Earth today that
[42:09] it's absolutely a hard thing because it
[42:12] deadens the voice of the supernatural
[42:28] and hear his voice he says but there's
[42:30] so many voices
[42:31] today that it takes the voice of the
[42:34] Lord away from
[42:37] us now how how does what is it these
[42:42] voices
[42:45] have that if you listen to
[42:48] them they can sound
[42:54] reasonable because what they're relying
[42:56] on is human
[43:01] reasoning and that's how the enemy would
[43:04] like to trap us to get us to approach it
[43:06] through
[43:08] reasoning but keep this in mind what I
[43:11] read he said base your thoughts on thus
[43:14] sayeth the
[43:15] Lord not on
[43:20] reasoning there are those they contest
[43:24] whether the uh what brother brandham
[43:27] talked about happened with the bridge
[43:30] and the lives that were lost and him
[43:32] seeing that vision and that happened
[43:33] there son said all that never
[43:36] happened how do they know were they
[43:41] [Applause]
[43:43] there because because they interviewed a
[43:47] man whose mother was alive and saw
[43:52] it that's true
[43:57] and he was just a boy when it
[44:00] happened so somebody was there and saw
[44:03] it
[44:10] right what about the
[44:14] cloud it was up higher than a cloud
[44:17] could even
[44:23] exist and there was a picture taken of
[44:26] it
[44:29] now you say do you how do you know where
[44:32] the random was caught up in there by
[44:35] faith he said
[44:37] it and I believe
[44:41] him it doesn't have to be scientifically
[44:45] explained because the Supernatural is
[44:47] not
[44:49] scientific the supernatural goes beyond
[44:52] scientific understanding
[44:59] what about John said I was caught up on
[45:02] the Lord's
[45:03] day do they believe
[45:13] that the voice of God in this last days
[45:16] he says there's so many voices so many
[45:18] confused things the people get up and
[45:22] they don't know the word and they say
[45:23] things and maybe it sounds very
[45:25] reasonable
[45:27] he said communism is a reasonable
[45:30] thing everybody the same there's no more
[45:34] capitalists they're all
[45:36] Communists you ever stop and think that
[45:40] that's a false Revival communism
[45:43] is what did he pattern it
[45:46] after Jesus said the two Spirits would
[45:49] be so close he would deceive the elect
[45:51] if possible and everything the devil's
[45:54] got it's a perversion of what God
[45:56] created right sin is righteousness
[45:59] perverted lie is the truth
[46:02] misrepresented adultery is an act that
[46:04] God ordained to us
[46:06] perverted all unbelief is the perversion
[46:10] of
[46:11] belief you have to deny the truth in
[46:14] order to take the
[46:15] perversion see straighten out these
[46:18] voices test them by the word and see if
[46:22] it's
[46:25] truth right
[46:28] I remember years ago there was different
[46:32] ones that would travel around visiting
[46:34] this church visiting that church and we
[46:36] had some of them in our home when I was
[46:38] growing up and they would come around
[46:41] with their version of the
[46:44] message and they would sit and try to
[46:48] convince my dad of
[46:49] their version of the message right but
[46:53] it didn't line up with the
[46:55] word that's right
[46:58] right there was one man
[47:02] that he come across my family's path and
[47:06] later I found out that my associate
[47:09] pastor brother Phil who's actually from
[47:12] Indiana his come across his in his
[47:16] family's
[47:17] path and the man what the man was saying
[47:20] was you don't have to go to church no
[47:23] more we just we'll just gather
[47:25] Fellowship in our home
[47:28] and listen to the
[47:30] tapes we don't need the fivefold
[47:32] ministry no
[47:36] more brother Phil's family his dad
[47:39] followed
[47:45] it brother Phil's a
[47:51] miracle but he was raised around that
[47:54] and come up like he is praise God but
[47:59] when I met him he seemed to be so
[48:02] confused by
[48:06] things but
[48:08] gradually the voice of God straightened
[48:12] out all the
[48:13] [Applause]
[48:17] confusion the proof of his resurrection
[48:19] brother ramam says 2third of the world
[48:22] have never heard about Jesus or the
[48:24] resurrection but brother when when the
[48:27] emus experience come to caas when their
[48:31] eyes were open and they recognized who
[48:35] they were in a few minutes time they
[48:38] traveled down the corridors of time back
[48:40] to Jerusalem lightf footed light-hearted
[48:43] telling people we know our Lord is risen
[48:45] from the dead for we have seen him and
[48:48] we know that he is real hallelujah what
[48:52] is it is the last days God's going to
[48:56] raise men
[48:57] with messages with power with
[49:00] deliverance and with the power of the
[49:03] Gospel to prove that Jesus Christ is the
[49:06] same yesterday today and forever I
[49:09] believe this has been
[49:11] fulfilled I believe it's being
[49:17] fulfilled he says I know it sounds
[49:20] excitable no wonder we're living in an
[49:22] exciting time we are living in an
[49:25] exciting time it's a perilous
[49:29] time but for the bride of Christ it is a
[49:33] glorious
[49:36] time because we're living in the dime of
[49:40] the coming of the
[49:45] lord we are watching prophecy be
[49:49] fulfilled amen amen glory and you
[49:54] know as Jesus
[49:57] resurrected there was more prophecy
[49:59] fulfilled in th that amount of time than
[50:03] what had been fulfilled all during his
[50:08] ministry there was so much just happened
[50:10] and I believe that we're at that time
[50:13] and I believe that it will it can all
[50:16] just start falling into place and happen
[50:19] so
[50:21] quickly and I believe and it happening
[50:23] so quickly there won't be time for
[50:27] stragglers to turn around and say wait a
[50:29] minute maybe I've been going the wrong
[50:34] way course I don't believe they will
[50:40] anyhow it's a hard
[50:43] thing but those that are deceived were
[50:46] ordained to be
[50:50] deceived but the elect of God cannot be
[50:54] deceived Hallelujah amen it said it
[50:57] would deceive the very elect if possible
[50:59] but it's not possible it just said it
[51:02] would be so
[51:05] close and I believe things that we've
[51:08] saw over just the past recent years of
[51:12] the falling way of people that we can
[51:15] see how that it's so
[51:23] close why because it came right out of
[51:26] our
[51:38] Mist we're living in an exciting time
[51:41] yes we're living in the last day when
[51:42] God through every holy prophet through
[51:45] all the Old Testament through the New
[51:47] Testament has prophesied that in the end
[51:50] time the same things took place in the
[51:53] beginning would happen in the end time
[51:55] and as the Darkness would Fleet away the
[51:58] Gospel Light will shine across the
[52:00] corridors of the earth once more before
[52:03] the coming of the Lord he is risen from
[52:05] the dead he's the same yesterday today
[52:07] and forever Jesus Christ raised from the
[52:10] dead and is living among us I'm so happy
[52:13] for that my heart is thrilled beyond
[52:16] words when we don't have to guess about
[52:19] it
[52:21] amen we're not guessing whether this is
[52:23] true or not it's been Vindicated
[52:29] yes and I'll I'll show
[52:35] you SE the Antichrist he said
[52:39] men come in the anointed of the Holy
[52:42] Spirit they preach everything that's
[52:45] within them and the people walk right
[52:48] away as if nothing ever happened just
[52:53] unconcerned now there's got to be a
[52:54] reason for that and if you'll study this
[52:58] this tells what the reason is do you
[53:00] know the scripture says there would be a
[53:02] time in the last days where there be a
[53:04] famine strike the land not for bread or
[53:07] water but for hearing of the word of the
[53:12] Lord there's not a famine of the word of
[53:15] the Lord but there's a famine for the
[53:18] hearing of the word of the
[53:21] Lord he said that these ministers would
[53:25] preach their hearts out and people would
[53:27] just walk away from
[53:38] it voice of God in the last days he said
[53:41] Moses heard the voice of God he was full
[53:44] of theology he knowed all the ins and
[53:46] outs but it
[53:48] failed and he heard the voice of God and
[53:52] Moses was never the
[53:54] same and no man is never the same you
[53:57] might hear in your ears the voice
[54:01] speaking but when you hear in your heart
[54:04] the voice speaking see then you're
[54:07] hearing you do not see with your eye you
[54:10] look with your eye you see with your
[54:12] heart you see something say I don't see
[54:15] it you mean you don't understand
[54:18] it you do not hear with your ears you
[54:22] hear with your heart many times your
[54:25] ears hear the true voice of God and it
[54:28] falls off you like water off a duck's
[54:30] back but when you really hear you hear
[54:33] with your
[54:35] heart that's where the famine for
[54:37] hearing is they hear with their ears but
[54:40] they don't hear with their
[54:44] heart
[54:46] why brother Rams I often go back to this
[54:50] brother Ram said what was the difference
[54:53] in the woman at the well remember when
[54:57] Jesus went there he said I have a need
[54:59] to go by
[55:01] Samaria and he told that woman her
[55:04] life remember that he said if you know
[55:07] who you were talking to you'd ask me for
[55:09] a drink and I would give you a drink and
[55:11] you'd never thirst
[55:13] again and she said I perceive thou art a
[55:20] prophet she re there was something in
[55:23] her that recognized brother said what
[55:26] was difference between that woman and
[55:27] the priest down at the temple who was
[55:29] calling belah yes sir he said it was she
[55:33] had
[55:34] representation there was something in
[55:37] her that could hear the word of the Lord
[55:41] there was something in her that can hear
[55:43] the voice of God
[55:47] speaking why are you where you're at
[55:49] today because there's something in you
[55:52] that can hear the voice of God lord
[55:57] [Applause]
[56:00] that's where the difference is
[56:06] at do you know your theophany body
[56:09] already
[56:11] [Applause]
[56:12] exists it's not something yet to be
[56:16] created brother Bram said when you hear
[56:20] this message and recognize it to be
[56:23] Eagle food you have heard from your
[56:27] [Applause]
[56:45] theophany this is again the same message
[56:47] the voice of God in the last days he
[56:49] said in spite of these impersonations
[56:52] false voices false prophets all these
[56:55] other things that's Rising rising up
[56:57] Jesus still said in spite of all this if
[57:00] any man will hear my voice and follow
[57:03] me he is the word listen his commission
[57:07] to us today in all these voices which I
[57:10] said it would take hours to bring out
[57:12] all these voices and it's confusing to
[57:15] the people it's a pathetic thing and
[57:18] after all you don't get a second chance
[57:21] you got to take it now you might not get
[57:25] a chance
[57:27] tonight you might get you might not get
[57:30] a chance tomorrow it's
[57:33] now when you hear my voice Harden not
[57:38] your hearts as in the days of the
[57:40] provocation now is the time this is the
[57:43] acceptable time that if any man will
[57:45] hear my voice that goes to show his
[57:49] voice will still be there in the midst
[57:52] of all the
[57:54] chaos he still got a voice voice why his
[57:57] voice will ever remain it said heavens
[58:00] and earth will pass away but my voice
[58:03] shall not pass away his
[58:05] word in the midst of all the chaos his
[58:09] voice is still there and there's still a
[58:12] people that are are hearing that
[58:16] voice there is a people that have
[58:19] shutting their ears to all the voices of
[58:21] today all the other voices I don't care
[58:25] what they've got to say I don't care
[58:28] what their thoughts are I don't care
[58:30] their about their
[58:34] opinions when I get in the pull pit I'm
[58:36] not bringing you my opinion I'm bringing
[58:39] you to the revealed word of
[58:43] God so I don't want to hear their
[58:48] opinions everyone's got
[58:54] opinions I don't have time to
[58:57] waste I'm getting ready to
[59:00] [Applause]
[59:04] leave I've got my thoughts centered on
[59:08] where am I at in the faith I've got my
[59:12] thoughts centered on standing fast I've
[59:15] got my thoughts centered on taking
[59:17] inventory of myself because I want to be
[59:21] ready to go when he comes
[59:29] Hallelujah
[59:38] Lord these signs shall follow them that
[59:41] believe in my name they shall cast out
[59:43] Devils there's the word they shall speak
[59:46] with new tongues take up serpents that
[59:49] would not harm them if they drink deadly
[59:51] things it would not bother them if they
[59:54] lay their hands on the sick they Shout
[59:56] recover and you watch these things plus
[59:59] all the rest of the scripture put
[1:00:02] together now that alone will not confirm
[1:00:05] it not at all that's where Pentecostal
[1:00:08] get on the wrong
[1:00:10] road did not Jesus say many will come to
[1:00:13] me in that day and say Lord have not I
[1:00:16] done Mighty things in your name have not
[1:00:18] I prophesied your name have not I done
[1:00:21] all this in your name and Jesus said
[1:00:24] depart from me you that work iniquity I
[1:00:26] never knew you that's right it's to know
[1:00:30] Christ there's something that changes in
[1:00:33] your life watch your life and pattern it
[1:00:36] with the word and see where you're at
[1:00:40] taking inventory
[1:00:45] certainly what what is the
[1:00:49] proof there's been a change and eternal
[1:00:53] change has took place on the
[1:00:57] inside something changed us it's not a
[1:01:01] turning over of a new Leaf it's not
[1:01:03] trying on a new
[1:01:06] religion it's not just trying to be a
[1:01:09] moral person but there's something
[1:01:12] that's changed what is it that's changed
[1:01:14] us it's the voice of God that has
[1:01:17] changed
[1:01:18] us that's how we know it's the voice of
[1:01:21] God
[1:01:24] am brought about a changing us like it
[1:01:27] did
[1:01:27] Moses brought about a changing us like
[1:01:30] it did Joseph yes sir brought about a
[1:01:33] changing us just like it did
[1:01:38] John when John heard the voice it
[1:01:41] changed
[1:01:49] him they took and throw John out onto
[1:01:52] the aisle of patmas cuz they couldn't
[1:01:55] kill any all the ways they tried to kill
[1:01:58] him that wasn't successful so they
[1:02:00] throwed him out there in the aisle of
[1:02:01] patmas and brother brandom said that was
[1:02:04] exactly where God wanted him
[1:02:08] at so no matter what gets thrown at
[1:02:12] you you're going to end up exactly where
[1:02:15] God wants
[1:02:18] [Applause]
[1:02:24] you you know people are afraid to
[1:02:28] change many times people are afraid to
[1:02:30] change we we as humans we get so used to
[1:02:34] something being a certain way we get to
[1:02:37] be afraid of change but there is a
[1:02:38] change coming that you don't need to be
[1:02:40] afraid
[1:02:42] [Applause]
[1:02:45] of hallelu we've we've received a change
[1:02:49] spiritually in our
[1:02:52] souls turn with me to 1 Corinthians 15
[1:02:56] verse starting at verse 51-
[1:02:59] [Music]
[1:03:06] 58 behold I show you a mystery we shall
[1:03:11] not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:03:14] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:03:17] eye at the last Trump for the Trump
[1:03:20] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:03:23] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:03:27] I'm not afraid of that
[1:03:31] change
[1:03:33] amen I'm waiting for that
[1:03:38] change I like that song I used to sing
[1:03:41] years ago there's been a change in me
[1:03:43] amen I'm not the man I used to be I
[1:03:47] don't go to the places I used to go I
[1:03:49] don't do the things I used to do why
[1:03:52] there's been a
[1:03:54] change brother ROM says there first must
[1:03:57] be a spiritual Resurrection before you
[1:04:00] could ever have a natural Resurrection
[1:04:02] yes sir and I'm saying there first must
[1:04:04] be a spiritual change before you can
[1:04:07] have this
[1:04:11] change for this corruptible must put on
[1:04:15] incorruption this Mortal must put on
[1:04:19] immortality so when this corruptible
[1:04:21] shall be put on incorruption and this
[1:04:24] Mortal shall put on in IM mortality then
[1:04:27] shall be brought to pass as saying it is
[1:04:29] written death is swallowed up in Victory
[1:04:33] oh death where is thy sting oh grave
[1:04:35] where is thy Victory The Sting of death
[1:04:38] is sin and the strength of sin is the
[1:04:41] law but thanks be to God which giveth us
[1:04:45] the victory through our Lord Jesus
[1:04:48] Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be
[1:04:52] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[1:04:56] the work of the Lord for as much as you
[1:04:59] know that your labor is not in vain in
[1:05:01] the
[1:05:08] Lord 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:12] 3 verse 17
[1:05:17] 18 now the Lord is that spirit and where
[1:05:21] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:05:23] Liberty you believe that yeah I know you
[1:05:26] believe it because there's a liberty to
[1:05:28] preach here
[1:05:31] yes but we all with open face beholding
[1:05:34] as in the glass the glory of the Lord
[1:05:36] are changed into the same image from
[1:05:39] glory to glory even as by the spirit of
[1:05:42] the Lord that's the change that's taking
[1:05:45] place now in our
[1:05:48] life Lord sir we're waiting for what I
[1:05:51] mentioned before about the change of
[1:05:53] this body
[1:06:01] what is it that changes
[1:06:02] it the word of
[1:06:06] God but it's not through some magical no
[1:06:10] pain
[1:06:16] way God always proves his sons he always
[1:06:20] proves his
[1:06:23] children he'll put you in situations
[1:06:27] see what you'll do that's right you say
[1:06:30] is he really want he knows what you're
[1:06:32] going to
[1:06:35] do but he wants to watch
[1:06:42] it it's like giving a kid a new
[1:06:48] bike here
[1:06:51] recently my youngest son who's here with
[1:06:54] us tonight sitting somewh
[1:06:56] where he uh there he
[1:07:00] is that's
[1:07:03] William on his 15th birthday we bought
[1:07:06] him a brand new
[1:07:08] bicycle and when he came out we took it
[1:07:10] out of the back of the truck he act like
[1:07:12] he could hardly believe his eyes he was
[1:07:14] so excited about
[1:07:16] it I knew he was going to be excited and
[1:07:19] I knew what he was going to do with it
[1:07:21] but I still wanted to watch him do it
[1:07:23] when we took it down out of the truck
[1:07:28] I wanted to watch him ride that bike I
[1:07:31] wanted to see him happy with
[1:07:35] it and I wanted to see what he would do
[1:07:37] with the big hill we lived
[1:07:44] on that was a test going down that hill
[1:07:48] in the gravel and
[1:07:49] things God will put you he'll allow
[1:07:54] circumstances right just to see what
[1:07:56] you'll
[1:07:57] do not for him to discover what you'll
[1:08:00] do but for him to watch what you're
[1:08:02] going to do he knows his
[1:08:11] children until we reflect his life in
[1:08:15] every situation and Circumstance no
[1:08:17] matter how we're treated by
[1:08:21] others that's that's how long it'll go
[1:08:24] on
[1:08:26] and God's not a one-dimensional god he's
[1:08:28] a multi-dimensional God he can do more
[1:08:30] than one thing at a
[1:08:33] time God can take one
[1:08:36] situation and teach five different
[1:08:39] people from one
[1:08:41] situation God can take one happening and
[1:08:44] affect the lives of many people that's
[1:08:48] right right he can God can take this
[1:08:51] person and let them affect a somebody
[1:08:54] who will in turn affect someone else
[1:08:56] with what with friends when we gather
[1:08:58] together here we're drawing strength
[1:09:01] from one
[1:09:02] another our faith we link our faith
[1:09:08] together remember brother Brandon
[1:09:10] mention said there's such a bank of
[1:09:11] faith in this place all things are
[1:09:15] possible I believe that
[1:09:19] tonight I know you believe I can feel
[1:09:23] your faith hallah
[1:09:29] all things work together for the good of
[1:09:32] them that love the
[1:09:33] Lord what things all
[1:09:36] things there's nothing that takes
[1:09:39] place what God doesn't allow
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:44] it and God is allowing this testing this
[1:09:48] shaking he's allowing this apostasy to
[1:09:51] run wild
[1:09:53] why because it's to shake loose
[1:09:56] everything that can be
[1:10:00] shook why because we're getting ready to
[1:10:03] leave
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:06] here and only the elect can
[1:10:14] go Noah preached to everyone that's
[1:10:21] right but he built the ark to house
[1:10:23] eight wow
[1:10:28] not because that was in his own thinking
[1:10:30] but because that was the instructions of
[1:10:36] God but he still went on and
[1:10:39] preached like everyone could be saved
[1:10:42] because they could it wasn't a something
[1:10:45] false if they would have believed they
[1:10:48] could have been saved but God knowed who
[1:10:51] would and who
[1:10:53] wouldn't and there's a good old gospel
[1:10:57] ship that's getting ready to
[1:10:59] leave amen and I'll tell you what
[1:11:02] there's only room on it for the
[1:11:04] elect in Noah's time there was just
[1:11:07] enough room on the ark for the elect and
[1:11:10] that's the way it is in this day so God
[1:11:12] is shaking loose everything that is not
[1:11:15] the elect of
[1:11:20] God that's one of the things that they
[1:11:22] hate
[1:11:23] too they hate that word
[1:11:28] election they say oh the
[1:11:36] elite they don't believe in that Elite
[1:11:41] Doctrine well I'm
[1:11:43] sorry the
[1:11:46] Bible testifies of
[1:11:51] [Applause]
[1:11:54] election Paul all quoting what the voice
[1:11:57] of God said through the old prophets
[1:12:00] said was it not written that Jacob have
[1:12:03] I loved and Esau have I hated before
[1:12:07] either boy was born that the election of
[1:12:10] God might stand
[1:12:18] sure how can you do away with something
[1:12:20] that's that clear in the
[1:12:22] Bible right
[1:12:35] change you know when I think of that I
[1:12:38] always think of that story brother Brown
[1:12:39] tells about that crow that had been
[1:12:41] caught and been chained
[1:12:43] up and it could only hop out around so
[1:12:46] far as where the chain would let it
[1:12:49] hop he said one day they let It Off the
[1:12:52] Chain but the crow would only still just
[1:12:54] hop so far as the chain had allowed him
[1:12:56] to
[1:12:57] hop why he didn't know he was
[1:13:00] free but I'm telling you tonight you
[1:13:03] know you're free
[1:13:07] hallelu we've been set
[1:13:13] free you Lord Jesus
[1:13:20] Hallelujah and I'll tell you what I love
[1:13:22] the opportunities that God gives us
[1:13:28] God gives us opportunities to show
[1:13:32] love he gives us
[1:13:35] opportunities to have
[1:13:40] faith I believe
[1:13:44] that it was brother Tim puit one time I
[1:13:47] heard say that sickness is just an
[1:13:49] opportunity to be healed
[1:13:53] [Applause]
[1:13:55] it's an opportunity for Divine
[1:13:58] Healing and we're promised
[1:14:02] that
[1:14:06] amen be not soon shaking the Bible
[1:14:10] says and we won't
[1:14:13] be we're living in a great
[1:14:17] time wonderful time amen hallelujah
[1:14:22] hallelujah amen God bless you brother
[1:14:25] same
[1:14:45] God Amen let's
[1:14:50] stand amen you love the Lord tonight
[1:14:52] amen hallelujah amen
[1:14:57] thank you Lord I tell you thank God for
[1:15:00] for his voice amen thank God for his
[1:15:04] voice you know when you look at how that
[1:15:07] the Lord just just really speaking to
[1:15:10] our hearts here
[1:15:12] tonight you know the Bible says he said
[1:15:15] beloved try every
[1:15:17] Spirit whether it be of God Amen and
[1:15:20] when you listen to it you hear things
[1:15:23] all around things that come even from
[1:15:26] internally that things are spoken things
[1:15:29] that can even be they use the quotes of
[1:15:34] the message to
[1:15:36] cloak but you know the spirit of God
[1:15:39] will never back something that's
[1:15:42] off never the holy spirit will always
[1:15:46] stay with the word amen and he said I'll
[1:15:49] bring to remembrance whatsoever I have
[1:15:52] said amen God always V indicates his
[1:15:56] word amen so it it's just as God if we
[1:16:01] thank God because the reality is is that
[1:16:04] God's voice it'll always stay with the
[1:16:06] same pattern of the word we don't give
[1:16:10] preeminence no matter who it comes from
[1:16:12] it must come and line itself with the
[1:16:15] word of God is that right because when
[1:16:18] we look at the message that God has sent
[1:16:20] to us in this hour it is the voice of
[1:16:23] God personally
[1:16:25] to
[1:16:26] us so when we hear those things it's
[1:16:29] just like what was spoken here those
[1:16:31] voices are very strong even that are
[1:16:33] around right now there's Gatherings
[1:16:35] going on that you you don't need
[1:16:37] Ministry anymore if if ministers don't
[1:16:41] play it in the pullit you're
[1:16:44] deuses that's
[1:16:46] error that's error the truth of the of
[1:16:50] of the reality is is that we've never
[1:16:52] stopped with brother Brandon being in
[1:16:54] the pool
[1:16:56] we preach from the message of the hour
[1:16:58] Hallelujah we do what we have been
[1:17:00] commissioned to do by the spirit of
[1:17:03] almighty God and God is having his way
[1:17:08] amen we want to be sensitive to his
[1:17:10] voice we want to see that that word just
[1:17:13] moving in our lives transforming us amen
[1:17:18] is God having his wonderful way don't
[1:17:21] you love him amen just Lord you know
[1:17:25] it's just like within it all Lord to me
[1:17:27] I just want to be simple I want to just
[1:17:30] take it in and I want to live by the
[1:17:34] word of God of what God has spoken amen
[1:17:38] this is this is not this is not a
[1:17:40] Doctrine to us it is him this is
[1:17:44] Christ it is our life when Noah built
[1:17:48] the ark that was an expression of what
[1:17:50] God had revealed to him it was not
[1:17:52] something he did on the side it was his
[1:17:55] life so everything that Noah did when
[1:17:58] Noah had a decision to make it was how
[1:18:01] is this going to affect the construction
[1:18:03] of the Ark yes how is that going to
[1:18:06] affect anything see because what the ark
[1:18:09] that was Christ the center of the
[1:18:12] Revelation so it was the center of
[1:18:15] Noah's life so it gave that's what gave
[1:18:18] meaning to why did Noah do certain
[1:18:20] things is because everything came back
[1:18:22] to how is this going to affect
[1:18:25] the ark it's the same thing with Moses
[1:18:27] same thing with each of that's why when
[1:18:29] this word as it's truly personally
[1:18:32] revealed to our hearts it's Christ it's
[1:18:35] the person of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:18:37] the message is it's the token to us
[1:18:41] personally and it is our life we're not
[1:18:45] just looking and talking about the
[1:18:46] coming of the Lord we're living for the
[1:18:49] coming of the
[1:18:50] Lord he is our life all that we do oh oh
[1:18:54] my may God continue to help us and
[1:18:58] continue to change us if there's
[1:19:01] anything at all Lord that needs to be
[1:19:03] rubbed out rub it out Lord that we are
[1:19:07] found ready if there's anything that
[1:19:09] would make me dull of hearing it all rub
[1:19:12] it out Lord if there's any other voices
[1:19:15] anything else all around let's just let
[1:19:17] it be shut
[1:19:18] out amen
[1:19:21] hallelujah amen Lord Jesus
