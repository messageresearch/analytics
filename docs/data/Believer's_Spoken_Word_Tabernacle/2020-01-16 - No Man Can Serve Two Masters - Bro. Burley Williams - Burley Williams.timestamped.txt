[29:49] what you believe
[29:53] is what will be
[29:58] the satchel we
[30:02] - the winds of fate

[30:11] in a higher place
[30:16] do not struggle

[32:03] do not struggle boy it's fine
[32:10] [Applause]
[32:11] [Music]
[32:13] Joleen
[32:16] the wind Sophie what inspired words you
[32:30] know you think of the the eagle itself
[32:33] how brother Brad would tell us that
[32:35] story where he was up there in the
[32:38] mountains praying
[32:41] and how that that little chipmunk and
[32:44] that eagle had come down and landed in
[32:46] that little chipmunk begin to chatter
[32:49] chatter chatter at the eagle
[32:52] whether bam got to looking at it and the
[32:54] inspiration just struck him because
[32:57] everything that that little chipmunk was
[33:00] saying was things that really it didn't
[33:03] matter the chipmunk didn't hold any
[33:07] mystery for that Eagles life and finally
[33:10] you know brother bran just you know he
[33:11] gives the illustrations and dramatizing
[33:14] it as though that that little chipmunk
[33:15] was just speaking everything that was
[33:18] contrary to the authority that laid in
[33:20] that eagle these are miracles has passed
[33:23] and all those things are behind but
[33:25] there was an authority that lay within
[33:27] that eagle and just all he had to do was
[33:30] spread his wings and a little thrust and
[33:33] there was a current that could lift him
[33:36] I believe there's there's it is it is
[33:40] absolutely a lesson in a direction for
[33:43] our lives there's a lot of chatter that
[33:45] we can hear there's a lot of chatter
[33:47] that's going on we look in Psalms 27 the
[33:51] Bible as it speaks and brother bran
[33:53] would take that for the background to
[33:55] the rapture you know when you ever heard
[33:57] of a story and you hear a story
[33:59] sometimes it makes it different it has
[34:03] such a meaning when you see the
[34:04] background of those characters and of
[34:07] that story were surrounded the enemies
[34:11] all around us but like David said one
[34:14] thing will I seek after and that I may
[34:17] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[34:19] so the enemy swore and that he would get
[34:23] me but he says he stumbled
[34:25] yay he stumbled and fell amen whereas
[34:29] our confidence that it's in the Lord and
[34:31] you know what God has let us know in
[34:33] this hour what the real revelation
[34:35] breaks forth on our life is to let you
[34:37] and I know who we are
[34:40] the authority that's given to us as sons
[34:42] and daughters of God let me just say it
[34:44] like this as as the ministering of the
[34:47] word will come just in in and simplicity
[34:50] here tonight we have authority within
[34:54] our life
[34:55] to rise above and to lay everything else
[34:58] aside amen you believe that we have that
[35:03] authority listen when the word of God is
[35:05] coming forth the Word of God is here it
[35:08] sits the person of Jesus Christ to
[35:10] anoint our eyes and our hearts and what
[35:14] the word is speaking just obey a man you
[35:18] find liberty is within the Word of God
[35:20] amen can you say Amen tonight
[35:22] amen what at what authority is in the
[35:26] Word of God and in as children of God as
[35:28] believing sons and daughters of God

[35:33] got a lot to pray for but we've got also
[35:35] a lot to be thankful for

[35:39] our way it is the making of a testimony

[36:16] interested in hearing from him and to
[36:18] know that God will take that vessel take
[36:19] the gift that God will step down inside

[41:35] white baby if it's a Chinese baby if
[41:38] it's a Mexican baby you can't tell the
[41:41] difference it's all cried

[42:06] the hearts of your people tonight reacts
[42:08] in the name of Jesus Christ as we could
[42:11] meet everything and not hands and the
[42:13] church says Amen god bless you making
[42:18] musicians god bless you today
[42:26] to submit up this way
[42:29] I said it but reading I believe it's
[42:31] probably eight years ago
[42:33] I was longing it actually but we here by
[42:37] God's grace a man
[42:39] it's good to see brother end it god
[42:40] bless you brother
[42:43] while you have to be in the house of the
[42:44] Lord tonight man god bless you but
[42:48] saving for allowing us to be here and
[42:50] we'll just like just get on into the
[42:53] word
[42:58] you don't wanna preach to your young
[43:00] people
[43:03] praise the Lord I just
[43:06] it's been lately you know just been
[43:11] I guess I get stuck in a gear or
[43:13] sometimes and just like to share things
[43:16] Whittle but you know when the gospel go
[43:18] forth this for all of us a man and what
[43:22] I would like to minister on tonight it
[43:23] actually could go either way
[43:24] I had something else I was gonna
[43:27] minister as I walked out and then I
[43:30] began to think about a little thought so
[43:32] I'm just gonna want to go at this
[43:33] thought in my heart tonight if you will
[43:36] I like to invite you to turn to Matthew
[43:39] chapter 6
[43:50] but I heard you talking about the Eagles
[43:53] that's some of my favorite service
[43:55] sermons to you know eagle they live
[43:59] quite some time someone can live up to
[44:03] 86 92 years old they say but one reason
[44:08] why they say the eagle clear so long
[44:10] it's because you don't use his strength
[44:14] to fly
[44:17] you know ego just go like this a couple
[44:19] of times and that's it because what
[44:22] happened to waiting catches him what
[44:25] makes him live long he'd know how to
[44:27] yield to the wind
[44:28] he don't flap a lot so he just spread
[44:32] his wings yield to the wind and let the
[44:35] wind carry him hey man so he don't wear
[44:40] out too much you know sometimes we wear
[44:43] out because we flapping flapping and
[44:46] flapping flapping flapping what we need
[44:48] to do is year to the holy spirit and let
[44:51] God carry us can we say praise the Lord
[44:54] and I'm so thankful for them amen
[44:58] let's turn to Matthew chapter 6
[45:04] I want to go to verse 24
[45:08] he says no man can serve two masters for
[45:12] either he will hate the one and love the
[45:15] other or else he will hold to the one
[45:18] and despise the
[45:22] you cannot serve God and Mammon just
[45:27] read that scripture again
[45:28] no man can serve two masters well hate
[45:31] the one and love the other or else he
[45:34] will hold to the one and despise the
[45:37] other you cannot serve God and Mammon I
[45:42] also had to go to Luke chapter 14
[45:54] week fourteen and I like to go to verse
[45:56] 25
[46:05] Luke 1425
[46:08] listen there wasn't a great multitude
[46:09] with him and he turned and said it to
[46:12] them if any man come to me hate not his
[46:16] father and mother and wife and children
[46:21] and brethren and sisters yay and his own
[46:25] life also he cannot be my disciple
[46:39] I would like to hopefully we won't hold
[46:42] too long
[46:45] I would like to speak a simple little
[46:47] thought tonight no man can serve two
[46:48] masters Jesus made that very plain he
[46:54] said no man can serve two masters well
[46:58] you either will hate the one and love
[47:01] the others
[47:03] those are pretty plain words don't need
[47:06] no interpretation that means exactly
[47:07] what it says
[47:10] and I really loved that scripture
[47:12] because it makes them very plain you
[47:15] know in this time that we're living in a
[47:17] lot of things are happening a lot of
[47:20] things are taking place but I don't
[47:23] dwell on the negatives I do well over
[47:25] the positive because when you talk about
[47:27] everything that is going wrong so much
[47:30] you're actually giving the devil praise
[47:33] when we should be giving God praise
[47:35] praise the Lord
[47:37] you know we we we just want to just I'm
[47:42] gonna go to numbers Exodus 21 in a
[47:44] moment but I want to just kind of deal
[47:46] with these scriptures for a moment and I
[47:48] want to read something
[47:51] cuz I'm getting ready to do something
[47:53] that's quite simple but Brenham says in
[47:57] the message faith come not hearing
[47:59] he said just lift the meeting down here
[48:02] where I had 2000 after noon about a week
[48:05] before then and as many as 30,000 at
[48:08] that time he said I just don't sound the
[48:12] trumpet about it I want I want it to
[48:15] sound it up there so where it goes up
[48:18] there
[48:18] the Lord said we see it you know and so
[48:22] forth
[48:22] he's about that's it friends he's a God
[48:26] set some in the church to dramatize I
[48:29] was thinking about this one better Sam
[48:32] he was talking about but a brand of
[48:34] gated drama about the little children
[48:36] said he'd come in my mind he said God
[48:38] said Psalm in the church to dramatize
[48:41] Psalm to preach a fiery service others
[48:45] to pray for the sick but all these
[48:48] gifted brothers they're in the church
[48:50] for one purpose that's to unite the
[48:54] kingdom of God here on earth the
[48:56] Brotherhood see we understand there's
[49:00] different types of ministries and he
[49:02] said some dramatize some preachers pray
[49:05] for the sick and you know I've got
[49:07] different types of gifts and I'm the one
[49:09] did it I respect every gift of God make
[49:12] no difference who the Vesely as long as
[49:14] the gifts from God we think for forward
[49:16] wicked glean from it and I like to read
[49:19] it under Co he says he in Christ as the
[49:21] mystery of God revealed why do you
[49:23] hunger Church why do you thirst
[49:26] that it's the father trying to reveal
[49:29] his hidden secret to you but you let so
[49:32] many things get it out of you you let
[49:36] your job you let your wife you know that
[49:39] your husband you let your children you
[49:42] let the cares of this world you let some
[49:44] pastor you let somebody else getting it
[49:47] out of you when you know that down in
[49:49] your heart you're thirsty hungry it's
[49:53] God trying to reveal it to you the
[49:55] revelation the last day is here now I
[49:59] want you to notice in this quote he said
[50:03] when he began to talk about you let so
[50:05] many things get it out of you
[50:07] he begins to say wife husband children
[50:13] pastor even the cares of this world that
[50:17] goes right back to the scripture that I
[50:18] read well we read in the Book of Luke 14
[50:21] if any man comes to me hate not father
[50:25] mother wife children brethren sisters
[50:30] yay in his own life so we look at in
[50:33] Luke 14 when it talks about you now we
[50:37] understand I'm pretty sure we are mature
[50:39] enough to realize when he said hey
[50:41] father mother brothers and sisters that
[50:45] don't mean to hate that we think hey man
[50:48] not that you mad at him you want to do
[50:50] something to him that's not what he's
[50:52] saying what he's simply talking about
[50:54] you can't put them things before me
[50:58] give me say praise the Lord now then
[51:01] brother branham is talking here about
[51:03] how you're thirsting but you let things
[51:06] you let things like shoot the children
[51:09] wife take these things from you so now
[51:13] when you look in the Book of Luke I
[51:14] believe because what Jesus is speaking
[51:17] in the Book of Luke he's speaking of
[51:19] family relations that can actually be a
[51:22] hindrance in your life and I find a lot
[51:26] of time in Christianity that's what no
[51:29] hindered a lot of people is family they
[51:31] don't want to let go
[51:33] being the influence the family influence
[51:35] them in the wrong directions
[51:36] I find that happened to a lot of people
[51:39] and I kind of want to just maybe talk
[51:41] about those things because you know
[51:43] family relationships and people in the
[51:46] family sometimes can be trapped in your
[51:48] life where you can't move on and you
[51:51] have to be able to discern them can we
[51:54] say praise the Lord
[51:55] so no man can serve two masters I
[51:58] believe we all have to come to a time to
[52:02] even get started we have to be like Ruth
[52:04] the prophet of God said what help Ruth
[52:07] to even start on her journey she had
[52:09] made a clear-cut decision and every one
[52:14] of us have to have the clear-cut
[52:16] decision I'm gonna serve God regardless
[52:21] of what comes or what goes I'm gonna
[52:24] serve God amen when you get that
[52:27] clear-cut decision you have temptations
[52:29] and trials come down through the journey
[52:31] but your decision is clear and you're
[52:34] not gonna let nothing stop them you know
[52:37] even Abraham we understand that when God
[52:39] told Abraham it's missing the same thing
[52:42] you got to leave your house family amen
[52:46] he's talking about family again so it
[52:48] can tell you it can see that it can be
[52:50] hinder it sometimes with family trying
[52:52] to serve the Lord if we're not careful
[52:54] but you know one thing I liked about
[52:56] Abraham we understand how the prophet of
[52:58] God taught us Abraham did not do
[53:00] everything exactly what God told him to
[53:02] do he told him the one thing he did do
[53:05] he left his country
[53:08] but you ever noticed in a story of
[53:11] Abraham when he had his father with him
[53:14] he had his nephew with him god never
[53:17] said why did you do that why did you
[53:21] bring him with you and God never said
[53:22] today for him
[53:23] do you know why the main thing Abraham
[53:26] did he started walking
[53:31] he left his country and he started
[53:35] walking
[53:35] so by him just walking God knew would
[53:40] have to be dealt with later on
[53:42] so Abraham done the right thing indeed
[53:44] we understand the story how God
[53:46] virtually got rid of daddy got really
[53:49] nice you
[53:50] but Abraham did the right thing he
[53:53] started walking that's what I try to
[53:56] encourage people whatever you do it's a
[54:00] statement that I use at my church I
[54:02] actually I can't remember the second who
[54:04] posted I think Paul I posted it
[54:06] he said if you smoke and go to church if
[54:09] you drink and go to church if you
[54:12] listening to where the music go to
[54:13] church if you're cursing going to church
[54:15] if you drink an alcohol go to church
[54:19] because what the devil do when people
[54:21] got those problems in life they say
[54:23] there's no need for me to go to church
[54:25] so ain't going to go to church until I
[54:28] can stop doing it if you can stop doing
[54:30] it you don't need God so if you go to
[54:34] church and bring the problem in the
[54:35] church you into a place where you can be
[54:37] helped can we say praise the Lord so
[54:41] honey current people keep pressing on
[54:42] keep pressing on and that's where
[54:44] Abraham did and we watch Abraham life
[54:47] little by little
[54:49] God was changing things and i'ma tell
[54:53] you one thing I love about it you know
[54:54] when God had to separate a lot from
[54:58] Abraham because strife begin to come
[55:00] between them but that separation when it
[55:03] took place I like how the scripture says
[55:05] it it said when life had gold did God
[55:09] speak to Abraham but do you notice in
[55:12] the scripture the one that caused the
[55:14] strife and so forth got out of Abraham
[55:17] life
[55:17] the
[55:18] when God got Abraham what he wanted him
[55:21] he sent him to go get back to rescue it
[55:25] so that's like God deal with us you know
[55:29] I encourage young people you know you
[55:31] saw maybe in public school and you got
[55:34] jobs and stuff but I encourage you
[55:36] Wilfred I don't think God want us to be
[55:38] Hermits and state to ourself and not do
[55:40] nothing but I encouraged and wherever
[55:43] you doing wherever you're going if you
[55:45] into a place where you can't keep the
[55:47] right atmosphere just leave I tell my
[55:51] son the same thing he like to play
[55:53] basketball all over the streets as a son
[55:55] that's fine but when you can't control
[55:56] that atmosphere get out of it can we say
[55:59] praise the Lord
[56:00] so sometimes you know you have to be
[56:03] careful with your hanging around and
[56:04] what you do if you're not strong enough
[56:06] in your spiritual walk there's certain
[56:08] things you can't go in certain places
[56:10] you can't go because it's going to be a
[56:12] hindrance to you can we say praise the
[56:14] Lord but I do believe as we go in Christ
[56:17] I can go anywhere I want to go because
[56:20] kicked nobody influenced me can we say
[56:23] praise the Lord I come to a place in my
[56:25] life I can't no can't nobody influenced
[56:27] me in the wrong way
[56:28] I don't permit that because I know who I
[56:31] am can we say praise the Lord
[56:33] so I do not encourage too young people
[56:35] you find your strength in the Lord and
[56:38] you know what you can take and you know
[56:39] what you can't take a man let God
[56:41] elevate you let God help you grow he'll
[56:44] help you I promise you Danny
[56:46] Amen man it's already eight o'clock
[56:48] brother praise the Lord you know since
[56:54] I've been passionate I got a little
[56:56] long-winded you know my you know how
[57:00] your family they don't know how to
[57:02] correct you like your own family now we
[57:06] brother you all y'all ministers you know
[57:07] how it is your wife catch every mistake
[57:09] you say and then you know how it is oh
[57:13] maybe I have to be honest with you when
[57:15] my wife say Amen that really excites me
[57:20] huh cuz you know this is good this is
[57:27] good
[57:28] it encourages me I mean I love amens and
[57:30] so far but with my wife just saying I
[57:32] said that's alright because I know I'm
[57:36] better enjoy that
[57:37] cuz soon as I say something wrong she's
[57:42] gonna remind me sometimes you preaching
[57:46] it and I'm like something wrong and need
[57:49] I said I said look she you know I play
[57:53] at all of them that's early edition yeah
[57:56] when I get it right she I appreciate
[58:00] that I really do I'm trying to relax
[58:04] some spirit I was uh you know I was
[58:10] looking at some stuff on the internet or
[58:12] people I wanted to know why people leave
[58:15] the message I'm interested why did you
[58:20] leave so I could learn from that that's
[58:23] what I do and I was my wife said what
[58:27] are you doing I said I'm just looking at
[58:28] some things here I just want to know
[58:30] what people leave a domestic what
[58:32] you doing there I said I'm a pastor and
[58:35] I want to know because when I learned
[58:37] things from why other people do things
[58:39] then I can see somebody else go in that
[58:43] same direction I can pick it up because
[58:45] I'm learning him I said you don't need
[58:49] to be caught up in that stuff I said I'm
[58:51] not caught up in it she's a bird I wanna
[58:53] tell you something if you get caught up
[58:56] in there that stuff something you know
[58:58] right now I'm not gonna follow you
[59:01] she said you leave this message I will
[59:04] not follow you she said I will move back
[59:07] home to my ot and I'm gone and I said
[59:11] god bless you sister
[59:16] that's right she said she said I don't
[59:20] know what's wrong with all the other
[59:21] sisters when they hugged the lead and
[59:23] they follow him she's I'm not one of
[59:24] them Bernie that tells me she has a
[59:29] revelation she's not following me she's
[59:34] following Christ can we say man you know
[59:38] brothers and sisters I can't explain
[59:40] everything
[59:41] I don't think none of us can but I'm
[59:45] here to tell you it's what I could
[59:48] explain the cloud or I can't explain it
[59:51] sons wonders and miracles it's not why
[59:56] I'm in the message it's the word you can
[1:00:03] show me false about brother better in
[1:00:04] life and there might even be right but
[1:00:06] it ain't gonna change my opinion about
[1:00:08] it it ain't gonna change my opinion
[1:00:11] about the message cuz some things we
[1:00:13] just don't understand can we say praise
[1:00:17] the Lord
[1:00:17] so I be honest with you it's only three
[1:00:21] types of groups in the message there's a
[1:00:24] group in the message that make brother
[1:00:26] Brandon more than what he was there was
[1:00:29] a group that take away from what he was
[1:00:32] but there's a bride know exactly what he
[1:00:35] was
[1:00:38] and and what I find the ones that make
[1:00:42] him more than what he was that's where
[1:00:44] your deity doctrines come from the one
[1:00:48] that takes away from what he was those
[1:00:51] are the one that capitalized on his
[1:00:53] mistakes but the bride says Elijah a man
[1:00:58] of like precious passions so you have to
[1:01:03] be a balance can we say praise the Lord
[1:01:06] but it is the word what caught me it is
[1:01:10] the word that's keeping me how many you
[1:01:13] believe we tie truth well Ruth type us
[1:01:18] because a bride is not a type you're the
[1:01:21] original so Ruth types you we don't type
[1:01:24] her let me make sure I make sure that
[1:01:26] right but you know but think about it
[1:01:29] when you read the story about Ruth when
[1:01:32] you go over there and you're going I
[1:01:34] think as Ruth chapter 4 when you're
[1:01:36] going and see Ruth talking to Boaz you
[1:01:39] middle boy I said who are that my
[1:01:41] daughter she said I'm Ruth right and
[1:01:45] didn't voice revealed to her the mystery
[1:01:49] of redemption what he's going to do is
[1:01:52] that right but if you notice when Ruth
[1:01:55] left bow ass she went back to Naomi and
[1:01:58] then they all he said who are that my
[1:02:01] daughter Ruth did not identify her name
[1:02:04] is Ruth cuz now she been revelaed
[1:02:08] something been revealed to her so she
[1:02:10] just said she just told what the man had
[1:02:13] done she wouldn't worry about her
[1:02:16] identity she was not identifying what
[1:02:19] boy and some promise he's gonna tell her
[1:02:21] can we say man
[1:02:23] so I say Who I thought my daughter my
[1:02:26] response is I can only tell you what the
[1:02:30] message what Christ has done for me
[1:02:34] that's all I can tell you you can't take
[1:02:37] away my testimony this message changed
[1:02:41] my life
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:44] it brought me from the streets brought
[1:02:47] me from being a thug brought me from
[1:02:48] being a liar it changed me so all I can
[1:02:53] do is testify what the message done for
[1:02:56] me
[1:02:58] sometimes I see sons gonna go out there
[1:03:00] gonna defend the message it saddens me
[1:03:04] when I see people try to defend brother
[1:03:06] Brennan
[1:03:07] you can't defend the Prophet God does
[1:03:11] there remember the Hat brother branham
[1:03:15] it on the stage but I barely said I'm
[1:03:17] not a healer he said but if the gift is
[1:03:20] in question God will answer for them see
[1:03:24] I don't have to go around trying to
[1:03:26] prove that brother Branham was a prophet
[1:03:28] God vindicated him if you want to prove
[1:03:34] the message live it
[1:03:40] he'll mean it yet we've been in the
[1:03:42] grocery store walking around in the
[1:03:44] grocery store and I apples they say an
[1:03:46] apple and an apple say hello you I'm an
[1:03:49] apple did bananas say hey I'm a banana
[1:03:52] carrots say hey you're my carrot anybody
[1:03:54] ever been in the grocery store and that
[1:03:55] happened to you know do you know I you
[1:04:00] look at the fruit and you know exactly
[1:04:01] what it is so I don't have to go around
[1:04:06] trying to prove the message is right I
[1:04:07] just live what the message is because
[1:04:10] the message is not win Brenham the
[1:04:15] message is Christ
[1:04:18] I hear a lot of times he'd say they have
[1:04:21] to measure they left the message they
[1:04:22] left the message a whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:04:23] whoa no they left Christ that's what
[1:04:26] they left can we say praise the Lord
[1:04:30] button sisters I'm just so thankful for
[1:04:35] a revelation I'm not interested in camps
[1:04:39] I'm not interested in personalities I'm
[1:04:43] interested in seeing the life of this
[1:04:46] gospel in people live that's what
[1:04:48] interests me I'm not interested how good
[1:04:51] somebody can quote I'm not interested
[1:04:53] I'm good they can relay scriptures I'm
[1:04:55] looking for life that's what I'm
[1:04:58] interested in can we say praise the Lord
[1:05:00] and I'll be on there with your brothers
[1:05:02] and sisters I'm just so thankful that we
[1:05:05] can see and such a time as this it's
[1:05:08] manifest in time every fruit every every
[1:05:12] seed is now coming into fruition because
[1:05:15] it's harvest time and we're going to be
[1:05:17] seeing more and more and more things but
[1:05:19] a believer can't be shaken can we say
[1:05:22] praise the Lord
[1:05:23] I think one message is really good to
[1:05:26] listen to in such the time as this is
[1:05:28] three kinds of believers I listen to it
[1:05:31] on the way of the road how is its
[1:05:32] explaining things I said this is just
[1:05:34] perfect
[1:05:35] he said I want to start with the
[1:05:37] believer because really the other ones
[1:05:38] don't matter
[1:05:41] the believer is what's matter and a
[1:05:45] believer believes can be said for
[1:05:49] instant law so many things are happening
[1:05:50] brother sisters but we can't this is not
[1:05:53] the hour to be discouraged you remember
[1:05:56] in the Bible when Jesus began to talk
[1:05:58] about things that's gonna happen to the
[1:06:00] earth in the war
[1:06:01] it takes her a groovy picture and then
[1:06:04] he says look up your Redemption draws
[1:06:08] nigh it's the sad picture didn't I said
[1:06:11] look up your Redemption draws nigh so
[1:06:15] when we see all these things going wrong
[1:06:17] we have to be excited cadet letting us
[1:06:20] know we're that much closer to home
[1:06:24] ain't earned walking around sad and
[1:06:27] confused no sad I say praise God you
[1:06:29] know what my soul don't have no joy
[1:06:32] nobody just like Paul was saying turning
[1:06:35] back from the word is no joy in that it
[1:06:37] saddens me but you know what that could
[1:06:41] have been me if God is not keeping me
[1:06:44] that's why we don't trust in ourselves
[1:06:46] and our ability with Justin he that is
[1:06:49] within us is Christ in me the hope of
[1:06:52] glory
[1:06:53] can we say praise the Lord actually what
[1:06:59] I'm going to preach in just a few
[1:07:00] minutes I'm just relaxing my spirit been
[1:07:03] a long time since we've been here in the
[1:07:08] scripture we reading
[1:07:12] with Matthew 6 Luke 14 I believe when
[1:07:19] Jesus was caught in these scriptures
[1:07:22] I believe Exodus 21 was in his mind and
[1:07:28] I want to show you what I believe that
[1:07:30] and you're looking to do it scriptures
[1:07:34] it is perfect now I'm going to do
[1:07:37] something I read that quote about
[1:07:39] dramatizing for a purpose because that's
[1:07:42] what I'm gonna do
[1:07:43] and I'm gonna need some help I already
[1:07:47] don't picked out who's gonna help so you
[1:07:50] might wanna but it's simple but if you
[1:07:57] catch anything
[1:07:58] catch them thought many really I don't
[1:08:03] see many good people
[1:08:06] fall you know people even dementia some
[1:08:09] people are good people that's leave but
[1:08:13] when I begin to talk to some women
[1:08:14] sometimes it's things that they have in
[1:08:17] their life they have now overcame and
[1:08:20] they've been going year after year
[1:08:22] struggling and fighting with the same
[1:08:24] thing but never got delivered and it
[1:08:26] pulls them back you know you read a
[1:08:30] quote the prophet of God talked about as
[1:08:32] long as we in this flesh we're gonna
[1:08:33] make mistakes and we're gonna get you
[1:08:35] didn't get sticky and flesh sometimes I
[1:08:37] hear people quote that quote sometimes
[1:08:39] and they wear it out mistakes mistakes
[1:08:42] mistakes wear it out I tell my church
[1:08:45] look if you're gonna make mistakes make
[1:08:48] new ones make new ones
[1:08:55] because if you keep doing the same thing
[1:08:57] over and over and over that's actually
[1:08:59] not a mistake there's somewhere in your
[1:09:02] life you need some deliverance in that
[1:09:04] area that's not a mistake the rebirth
[1:09:09] say I'm just I'm gonna preach to the
[1:09:12] young people in a minute yes you stand
[1:09:14] right there you stand right there if I
[1:09:18] walk or what your brother Sam you there
[1:09:20] do me one favor I might say something
[1:09:23] that sounds hilarious but it's not to
[1:09:25] beat us
[1:09:27] because you can laugh too much in the
[1:09:29] service it can break the anointing
[1:09:31] well are you with me I'm dramatizing
[1:09:35] better Samuel I believe with all of my
[1:09:38] heart if I'm walking and I come across
[1:09:42] and I was the trip and hit him extremely
[1:09:46] hard trip he was forgiven it's about Sam
[1:09:52] him sorry he said no problem
[1:09:54] it might hurt him but he said
[1:09:58] and what if I just get up can I go
[1:10:05] she first was a mistake but now he might
[1:10:09] say whoa oh brother burning something
[1:10:12] something oh you all right you
[1:10:16] understanding what I'm saying about
[1:10:17] mistakes and then custom to keep doing
[1:10:20] the same thing over and over it has to
[1:10:22] be some deliverance somewhere you know
[1:10:24] what I believe in total deliverance
[1:10:28] that's what I believe in
[1:10:30] that's what he taught that's what I
[1:10:31] believe God want his bride to be totally
[1:10:34] delivered she a mother
[1:10:43] let's go to Exodus 21
[1:10:49] I want you to watch the scripture very
[1:10:51] carefully Exodus 21 and I want you young
[1:10:56] people to listen
[1:11:02] we talking about no man can serve two
[1:11:05] masters
[1:11:06] but our you study the Bible history
[1:11:10] about masters in the Bible's they had
[1:11:14] tricks that they do to keep people
[1:11:15] trapped and what we have to understand
[1:11:21] even when we were young as we were
[1:11:23] growing up the devil could start trying
[1:11:25] to do things in our lives to put things
[1:11:27] in our lives too later on even we become
[1:11:30] adults and become traps things that we
[1:11:33] can't break because it wouldn't put
[1:11:35] there in young hood in our young age
[1:11:38] so I try to talk to young people about
[1:11:40] certain things about traps not even just
[1:11:42] young people even adults how the devil
[1:11:44] could have something planning and if you
[1:11:46] ain't careful you can fall into it then
[1:11:48] it becomes a struggle and hard to get
[1:11:52] over it it really needs some deliveries
[1:11:54] so I just want to talk about some of
[1:11:56] those things if you look in Exodus
[1:11:59] chapter 21 we want to go to verse 1
[1:12:04] we're going to read 1 to 6
[1:12:07] now these are the judgment which thou
[1:12:10] shalt set before them if they'll ban
[1:12:12] Hebrew serving six years he shall serve
[1:12:15] and in the seventh he shall go out free
[1:12:19] for nothing if he came in by himself he
[1:12:23] shall go out by himself if he were
[1:12:26] married then his wife shall go out with
[1:12:29] him if his master have given him a wife
[1:12:32] she had borne him sons and daughters the
[1:12:35] wife and her children shall be her
[1:12:38] masters he shall go out by himself and
[1:12:42] if the servants are playing they say I
[1:12:43] love my master my wife my children I
[1:12:46] would not go out free then this master
[1:12:49] shall bring him to the judges he and he
[1:12:52] shall also bring him to the door or to
[1:12:55] the doorpost and his master shall boil
[1:12:57] his ear through with an awl he shall
[1:13:00] serve him forever did you notice the
[1:13:03] language in the description they talking
[1:13:05] about husband wife master now if you go
[1:13:09] back to Matthew 6 and Luke 14 it's the
[1:13:12] same language husband wife master you
[1:13:17] can't serve two masters so that's why I
[1:13:20] feel when Jesus was saying that extra 21
[1:13:23] was on his mind and it was a purpose for
[1:13:27] them and we want to just turn it I
[1:13:29] wanted to show you a simple drama this
[1:13:32] is very very simple but it's a message
[1:13:34] in
[1:13:36] are you with me but then you
[1:13:41] I mean you in your life
[1:13:47] to come up please
[1:13:54] I hope anything gonna I'm not gonna
[1:13:55] embarrass
[1:13:59] now sister I need you to sit right there
[1:14:01] for
[1:14:03] but thing I need you to come right here
[1:14:05] just to stand right now I want to show
[1:14:07] you something in the Bible times a young
[1:14:14] man can get in trouble can get in debt
[1:14:17] can get in bondage but there was a law
[1:14:20] that he could work for seven years to
[1:14:24] clear his debts and then when the seven
[1:14:26] years is over he could go free the
[1:14:29] children of Israel was very aware of
[1:14:31] that law now Nathaniel I'm gonna use him
[1:14:36] as an example I need one more person
[1:14:44] I guess I'm usually better in
[1:14:48] that's your son you know it won't be
[1:14:51] offensive when you got to family matter
[1:14:55] you know man
[1:15:00] but Arendt I need you to spend right
[1:15:02] here
[1:15:07] now this isn't the thing you he don't
[1:15:11] got into some get
[1:15:14] he need to get out of it he knows the
[1:15:17] law of Israel
[1:15:18] now we gonna call him master Randy this
[1:15:24] is a master Randy so now he knows the
[1:15:27] law he know that he can go sell himself
[1:15:29] to master Randy for seven years to clear
[1:15:33] his debt then he can go free so now here
[1:15:37] going his been you I want you to walk up
[1:15:39] and say hello master Randy
[1:15:45] he's shaking hand say master Randy
[1:15:51] Messer Andy I got into a little trouble
[1:15:58] and I understand the laws of Israel
[1:16:05] that I could come to you and work to you
[1:16:07] with for you for a while and that could
[1:16:09] be free
[1:16:13] that is correct
[1:16:16] and what can I do for you
[1:16:19] son

[1:28:45] that's why don't fall for the devil okay
[1:28:49] look how hard to make a decision because
[1:28:53] reality struck and we can get ourself
[1:28:55] into them bangs young people for not
[1:28:58] careful at a young age
[1:29:05] the right choice
[1:29:07] you look at them say I'm sorry

[1:29:13] he done the same thing
[1:29:16] they married strange wives
[1:29:19] and they was put to the test do you guys
[1:29:22] want to be free they said we are willing
[1:29:24] to put away I was strange wise and our
[1:29:28] children they beaten in the book of Ezra
[1:29:32] but look at the pressure now see that's
[1:29:36] what I brothers and sisters do that
[1:29:37] which is right
[1:29:38] dude that which is honest don't let the
[1:29:41] devil get you in traps because this
[1:29:44] would be the same result pressure thank
[1:29:48] you let's give him a hand no man can
[1:30:02] serve two masters
[1:30:07] but I am so thankful for the blood of
[1:30:11] Jesus Christ
[1:30:14] he can wipe all that clean through
[1:30:17] repentance but the traps what do you
[1:30:20] think ability I'm said I've got the
[1:30:22] Catholics promise that you will make
[1:30:26] keep your children Catholics traps of
[1:30:30] the master brother promised you a raise
[1:30:33] your children Catholic Catholic all of
[1:30:35] those attract we can go on and on and on
[1:30:37] with all kind of traps
[1:30:40] there's boy traps there's girls traps
[1:30:44] it's traps but you got to be able to
[1:30:46] discern when the devil time set
[1:30:48] something there because you are the one
[1:30:51] got to make the decision and make the
[1:30:53] choice we all frame our agency though we
[1:30:57] need to be careful of our decisions
[1:31:01] traps of the master can we get a lot of
[1:31:05] hair
[1:31:06] [Applause]
[1:31:15] let us pray
[1:31:22] Heavenly Father
[1:31:25] well thank you for your grace and mercy
[1:31:29] traps
[1:31:33] sometimes I even look back in my own
[1:31:35] life and see some traps but the devil
[1:31:40] had done
[1:31:42] but I made the right decision is just as
[1:31:44] trusting you confess what I need to
[1:31:48] confess put it on the blood and press on
[1:31:52] cut for your children mercies and grace
[1:31:55] and the forgiveness that you have given
[1:31:57] us but lord I miss to see so many young
[1:32:01] people get chopped to it so many things
[1:32:04] their friends their music their movies
[1:32:08] and has chapped their hearts and chopped
[1:32:11] their spirits and they just can't break
[1:32:12] through certain things but because the
[1:32:14] plans that the enemy had put there but
[1:32:19] Lord I'm just asking that you just take
[1:32:20] this simple as a thought tonight and we
[1:32:23] just let it be impact into our hearts
[1:32:26] then we can be more mindful other things
[1:32:28] when the enemy tried to set the snare
[1:32:31] before
[1:32:32] it's just in you to deliver us from
[1:32:34] these things god I love you people I
[1:32:37] love the young I loved all I love your
[1:32:40] bride and I just trust you take these
[1:32:43] simple little things of God just
[1:32:46] minister to our hearts we thank you for
[1:32:48] your grace and mercy in the name of
[1:32:51] Jesus Christ
[1:33:15] brother make that Nathan I didn't
[1:33:20] embarrass you guys there
[1:33:21] it's just a drum tell me what
[1:33:37] although that would reach down his hand
[1:33:45] and would do this for me
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:53] wait for me
[1:33:55] [Music]
[1:34:00] one worthy to live and I'm not fear
[1:34:08] to give the man all the cross he had my
[1:34:17] name in his will he said that I
[1:34:25] I could see won't he say
[1:34:32] he said that I I could still go free
[1:34:42] Oh tell me what kind of a man won't
[1:34:50] reach down
[1:34:52] here's fan
[1:34:55] - this for me
[1:35:02] just for me so unworthy to live and I'm
[1:35:14] not fear
[1:35:16] to kill the man all and my name
[1:35:25] [Music]
[1:35:28] and he said that I could call free
[1:35:39] I wonder tonight in the presence of God
[1:35:45] we could be honest with the Lord those
[1:35:50] of you that know you were here and the
[1:35:53] service and no doubt at all that I don't
[1:35:55] have one doubt at all I haven't talked
[1:35:57] to brother Randy emprender Nathanael
[1:35:58] today or anything I don't know what was
[1:36:01] preached there on Sunday but I've got a
[1:36:03] good idea that it's right in line and
[1:36:07] these things right here brother Burleigh
[1:36:09] I haven't talked to him I don't talk to
[1:36:11] the man of God whoever's gonna preach I
[1:36:13] don't even talk to him one of what I've
[1:36:14] been preaching about I don't tell him I
[1:36:16] didn't talk to him I don't I don't get
[1:36:18] into fellowship matter of fact even
[1:36:20] today I hadn't even it was just a text
[1:36:23] to brother burly called on Monday it was
[1:36:26] simply a call about how's the weather
[1:36:27] look that's it I purposely do not talk
[1:36:31] about anything you say why because God's
[1:36:34] bigger than that God already knows what
[1:36:37] our needs are God has a way of coming
[1:36:41] around and taking things and making it
[1:36:45] so personal to our lives that you know
[1:36:49] one thing for sure that man that brother
[1:36:52] standing right there he doesn't know you
[1:36:55] good let me say to you the God who come
[1:37:00] down and use that gift tonight no she
[1:37:04] he knows every aspect every part about
[1:37:08] your life we talked about the
[1:37:10] predestinated will and the plan of God
[1:37:12] you realize that can't be defeated and
[1:37:15] in that as God deals with our hearts
[1:37:19] that's his mercy and His grace the
[1:37:22] things that were said I'm not going to
[1:37:25] re-preach it but I think it's very clear
[1:37:27] of what was said when that offer was
[1:37:30] made right here you seen the trap but
[1:37:33] the offer that was made when the seventh
[1:37:35] year would come that was known as a year
[1:37:39] of Liberty where brother Nathanael in
[1:37:43] acting that out whatever he had in his
[1:37:45] hand rake hole shovel everything he had
[1:37:47] been doing I don't care if he had been
[1:37:50] building a wall as brave if Master Randy
[1:37:53] if I could say that was had him building
[1:37:55] a wall and here he was he went to bed
[1:37:58] that night and fun man I've got more of
[1:38:00] this wall I got a build but when that
[1:38:03] seventh year that day that morning
[1:38:05] dawned he never had to look at that wall
[1:38:08] and say but I got to finish this out no
[1:38:11] it's finished it's finished let me just
[1:38:17] say this to you tonight he said on
[1:38:20] Calvary it is finished
[1:38:25] we've got authority tonight to lay
[1:38:30] everything down
[1:38:33] you don't have to ask that master you've
[1:38:36] been in Slate you don't have to ask him
[1:38:38] no no no you have a promise that has
[1:38:42] been made real right now I tell you I
[1:38:47] take this opportunity right now because
[1:38:51] it's true a mistake is not something we
[1:38:53] keep on going around in the circle
[1:38:54] that's not a mistake you say for the
[1:38:58] semi I need deliverance Liberty has been
[1:39:01] sounded don't walk out of here and keep
[1:39:06] building on that same wall but you said
[1:39:09] right now what was said in the very
[1:39:10] beginning of this service you make a
[1:39:12] clear-cut decision
[1:39:14] don't keep building that wall
[1:39:18] don't keep laboring in sin
[1:39:25] if you need a touch from the Lord
[1:39:27] tonight ask God he's right here
[1:39:32] matter of fact he's not just here he's
[1:39:35] right where you're at whatever you have
[1:39:39] Nina right now a confession laying it
[1:39:43] not just something just to free up but
[1:39:45] to go free say Lord right now tonight if
[1:39:50] you haven't made a decision and make a
[1:39:52] decision and here tonight for the sake
[1:39:55] of the gospel you we looked at on Sunday
[1:40:01] giving my all it's not enough just to
[1:40:06] come to church it's not enough just to
[1:40:07] know about the message that's not it
[1:40:09] that's not what the purpose is
[1:40:11] it's to know the author and I can tell
[1:40:15] you tonight by personal experience of
[1:40:18] what he'll do for your life he will
[1:40:21] change your life so completely to where
[1:40:25] it's not something you struggling but
[1:40:28] where God's grace is living through you
[1:40:32] where the very desires are changed you
[1:40:38] might say brother sin no that's that's
[1:40:40] that's that's pretty simple that's the
[1:40:42] reality and they will then let us not
[1:40:45] forget if God's done that work in your
[1:40:47] life you you ought to be right there in
[1:40:49] saying Lord is there anything in me am I
[1:40:54] laboring in certain areas and I'm
[1:40:57] wasting your time
[1:41:00] am I wasting your time think about one
[1:41:03] brother Brown went beyond the curtain of
[1:41:04] time he comes back he said lord have
[1:41:07] mercy
[1:41:08] often Here I am 50 years old and I've
[1:41:10] not done anything for you Lord it's kind
[1:41:16] of amazing how he could make that kind
[1:41:17] of a statement but you see it grips our
[1:41:20] hearts because we realize Lord it's so
[1:41:24] much more so much more
[1:41:26] I wonder tonight as we bow our heads
[1:41:33] I wonder how many would want to be
[1:41:34] remembered in prayer tonight we want to
[1:41:38] pray god bless you god bless your hands
[1:41:41] he sees your hands and your hearts all
[1:41:46] Jesus oh how precious he is how precious
[1:41:51] he is hallelujah
[1:41:54] he gave his word for you he sent His
[1:42:00] Word to heal his people how many would
[1:42:05] like to add to that and say Lord I want
[1:42:09] to consecrate myself afresh
[1:42:12] I want to redeem the Time Lord things
[1:42:17] that maybe with its we look at us they
[1:42:20] just it's taken time but I want to
[1:42:23] redeem the time Amen god bless your
[1:42:27] hands I've got my hand up Lord I want to
[1:42:30] redeem the time as husbands as daddy's
[1:42:35] is Mama's wives so I don't want no traps
[1:42:38] I don't want traps I don't want to
[1:42:40] present stumbling blocks that with
[1:42:41] stumbling blocks for me let's pray
[1:42:47] together and right now we're going to
[1:42:50] our Heavenly Father the same the same
[1:42:52] one who came right there to our hearts
[1:43:00] Lord Jesus what I cannot pray on behalf
[1:43:08] even though that I would pray for your
[1:43:12] people but Lord we're praying together
[1:43:17] Lord through this service here tonight I
[1:43:20] set their Lord at the very beginning and
[1:43:23] I marvel at just how personal you are
[1:43:30] nor do you know the needs you know the
[1:43:33] needs Lord Jesus may we receive it in
[1:43:37] that manner that trapped like it was
[1:43:41] spoke of here tonight he would try to
[1:43:42] hinder in the mind condemnation our Lord
[1:43:47] things would want to just try to close
[1:43:49] or call it to pull back but Lord you've
[1:43:51] come to speak to our hearts and may we
[1:43:56] Lord heed to your voice here tonight
[1:43:59] I believe our hearts have been inclined
[1:44:01] to your voice tonight the Lord behind
[1:44:05] every hand is my brothers and sisters
[1:44:06] we're putting together in this Lord God
[1:44:09] Lord Jesus we stand Lord in the name of
[1:44:16] Jesus Christ against every unclean
[1:44:18] spirit Lord there's no devil no master
[1:44:24] that can stand Lord God in your presence
[1:44:29] and father's we stand here tonight Lord
[1:44:32] in your presence your God taking charge
[1:44:36] lord over every unclean spirit Lord I
[1:44:40] pray father if there is any fame Lord
[1:44:44] the Lord would be hindering any habit
[1:44:47] Lord father in the name of Jesus right
[1:44:50] now the name of Jesus Christ Lord may
[1:44:55] they be loosed Lord God Satan you've got
[1:44:59] to turn him loose
[1:45:02] Granite Lord may their heart Lord making
[1:45:06] that decision I walk alone I walk alone
[1:45:09] I don't need these things that have come
[1:45:11] about my life they've only come to try
[1:45:13] to take me away and take away from that
[1:45:15] decision that I made that decision was
[1:45:19] not something that I came up with but it
[1:45:21] was the impression of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:23] upon my heart the Living God I want to
[1:45:26] serve the Lord with all this with enemy
[1:45:29] I want him to have every part of my life
[1:45:32] I'll lay it down everything I lay it
[1:45:35] down under the authority of the call of
[1:45:38] the word in Liberty Oh in the name of
[1:45:42] Jesus Christ Satan you're defeated do
[1:45:48] you believe it right there right where
[1:45:49] you're at right in your heart you settle
[1:45:51] it right now it's finished it's finished
[1:45:56] in the name of Jesus Christ Granite Lord
[1:46:01] those in need of the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:04] Ghost father I pray tonight God that
[1:46:06] Lord that you'll feel every one of them
[1:46:08] Lord God may their heart Lord God may it
[1:46:12] be the Lord within that consecration
[1:46:13] that I've got to have you more than
[1:46:16] anything else in this life Lord I've got
[1:46:20] to have you Jesus granite Lord father
[1:46:26] every hand that Lord was lifted there's
[1:46:29] hands Lord but God as our hands say Lord
[1:46:34] forgive me for time that's been wasted
[1:46:39] I want to redeem the time traps of
[1:46:43] things that were mentioned family other
[1:46:45] things that comes up things that don't
[1:46:47] necessarily look or seems sinful but
[1:46:50] anything that gets between us and you it
[1:46:55] becomes a god it becomes a God Lord we
[1:47:00] love our families we love each and every
[1:47:02] one but Lord God let there be nothing
[1:47:04] put between us and you because when it's
[1:47:08] put between us it's put before you or in
[1:47:12] the name of Jesus Christ right now why
[1:47:17] don't you just say Lord align it the
[1:47:18] right way the line of overcoming is God

[1:47:31] hinders say Lord forgive me if there's
[1:47:34] anything that has gotten in the way
[1:47:36] maybe it's things it's not as I said
[1:47:38] that maybe it's not sinful and it's
[1:47:41] things it just got caught up in and all
[1:47:42] of a sudden your time your time
[1:47:45] throughout the day you don't have time

[1:47:50] any time here there to get into the Word
[1:47:53] of God you say Lord I want to redeem the
[1:47:55] time help me Lord Jesus this is his
[1:47:59] desire it's his desire Lord granted
[1:48:04] right now father's your children this is
[1:48:08] the desire that you stir in our hearts
[1:48:11] help us Lord to be more sensitive for
[1:48:15] the more that Lord that we stay in your
[1:48:17] presence because our our own abilities
[1:48:19] cannot catch these things Lord the
[1:48:22] discernment is not of our our natural
[1:48:24] senses and Lord as the scripture tells
[1:48:28] us Lord as we're staying in fellowship
[1:48:29] with you eating upon the meat of the
[1:48:33] Word of God

[1:56:55] you know I think of that scripture in
[1:56:57] the book of Hebrews chapter 11 it says
[1:56:59] concerning Moses he chose he chose not
[1:57:05] to be taken with the pleasures of sin
[1:57:10] for a season but rather the Bible said
[1:57:15] he endured as seeing him who was
[1:57:18] invisible and he had respect unto the
[1:57:22] recompense you know that word respect
[1:57:26] means it doesn't mean like we think in
[1:57:28] our language that word respect means he
[1:57:32] had a mental focus his mind was set on
[1:57:39] the prize the Holy Spirit had so come
[1:57:43] into his heart to set that focus and I
[1:57:46] say to you just as a just from my heart
[1:57:49] you see things that even where you look
[1:57:53] at a lot of times when we see it all
[1:57:55] around us you see people start out in
[1:57:57] athletes and they think ma they've got
[1:58:00] years and years and some of them you
[1:58:02] find after two or three years some of
[1:58:05] them don't even make it a year and yet
[1:58:07] this is what they have labored for their
[1:58:09] entire life and I don't care if they had
[1:58:13] an opportunity to play for 13 15
[1:58:15] whatever how many years it's just a
[1:58:18] season it's like that I look back I'm 44
[1:58:24] years old and I think my goodness just
[1:58:27] 26 years 26 years ago seemed like that
[1:58:31] it just seemed just like that
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:58:35] I tell you give every moment give
[1:58:39] everything you've got to Jesus every
[1:58:42] part of your life everything give it to
[1:58:47] you give everything to him don't you
