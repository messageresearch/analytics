[15:01] tonight. Out on the
[15:05] waterers, storms raging
[15:09] high. The waters around them had trouble
[15:16] that night.
[15:19] Fear filled their
[15:22] hearts. They thought they would
[15:26] die, but they failed to
[15:31] remember. The master was not
[15:35] hallelujah. He spoke the
[15:39] word and the winds all stood still.
[15:45] Even the
[15:48] waters oy his
[15:52] will. And he calmed their
[15:56] stories just like he will
[16:01] mine if I just
[16:05] remember. And he lives
[16:10] inside. So why should I worry?
[16:16] Why should I
[16:18] fear? For this very same
[16:23] Jesus, he stays always
[16:27] near. He lives in my
[16:31] heart and he hears when I cry. Oh yes,
[16:36] Lord. I'll call on his
[16:40] name till the storm passes by.
[16:46] I read in the
[16:49] Bible how he walked with them. Yes,
[16:54] Lord. Brought light to their
[16:58] darkness when the way grew
[17:02] dear. How great it would
[17:06] be to have his steps leading my sword.
[17:12] And to walk with the
[17:16] master all of the
[17:20] time, when trials
[17:24] come and death is so
[17:28] nice, I'll just search for the master.
[17:33] I know he'll be right on
[17:37] time. When I'm in
[17:41] trouble and my body in
[17:45] pain, all I have to
[17:50] do is call on his
[17:54] name. So why should I worry?
[18:00] Why should I
[18:03] fear? For this very same
[18:08] Jesus, he stays always
[18:12] near. He lives in my heart.
[18:16] Amen. And he hears when I
[18:21] cry. I'll call on his
[18:25] name till the storm passes. Let's sing
[18:28] it one more time. Why should I worry? So
[18:31] why should I worry?
[18:35] Why should I
[18:38] fear? For this very same
[18:41] [Music]
[18:43] Jesus stays always
[18:47] near. Lives in my
[18:51] heart and he hears when I cry.
[18:57] Call on his
[19:00] name till the storm passes
[19:04] [Music]

[21:32] rejoices when I read his promise.
[21:37] He said, "There is a place I am
[21:42] preparing for

[35:37] river with the ransom I will
[35:42] sing.

[38:15] people. For his blood has
[38:22] washed away.
[38:25] [Music]
[38:32] Amen.
[38:34] Amen. Amen. I don't want to have you up
[38:36] and down. So, let's just uh if we could,
[38:40] let's just go to him in a word of
[38:41] prayer. And uh I say that because I want
[38:44] to read the text and then I want to kind
[38:47] of talk about some of the events of the
[38:49] day just very briefly and then
[38:51] um move into what the Lord would have
[38:54] for us here this evening. Amen. Let's
[38:57] just let's go to him in a word of
[38:59] prayer. Heavenly
[39:02] Father, how we're just so thankful
[39:06] for your mercy and your grace in this
[39:08] hour.
[39:11] Lord, we're thankful, Father, for this
[39:14] glorious evening light.
[39:18] First and foremost,
[39:21] Lord, it's Lord been that which has
[39:23] entered into our lives, Lord.
[39:27] That light, oh God, that has come to
[39:31] quicken our lives. Amen. That revelation
[39:35] of Jesus Christ, that reality, Lord,
[39:38] that union, that
[39:41] relationship, oh
[39:43] God, how glorious it is,
[39:46] Lord. The songs that Lord that Brother
[39:50] Brian was just leading us in right here,
[39:52] all that thrills my soul is Jesus.
[39:55] Hallelujah. Lord,
[39:57] that's that's the
[40:00] theme. You are the theme of our lives,
[40:06] Lord. Oh God, you are the reason, Lord.
[40:11] Even decisions that's been made like
[40:13] when Abraham came to a place to make a
[40:16] decision regarding Lot even though it
[40:18] was according to your word but your
[40:20] prophet told us Lord that decision was
[40:23] made based on the promise he was
[40:26] holding. So Lord we know that we're
[40:29] separation is not an earthly and carnal
[40:32] affair. It's not something that is based
[40:35] on differences among people. It is based
[40:38] on the light and the promise of God's
[40:41] word. Hallelujah. Lord
[40:43] Jesus, how we love you, Lord. We we so
[40:47] appreciate you, Lord. Those don't even
[40:50] seem like words that would be fitting
[40:52] enough, Lord, to say thank you, Lord,
[40:55] for your mercy in this hour. Lord, the
[40:58] things that we as we can see taking
[41:01] place and Lord, we know there's a lot of
[41:03] things even behind the scenes, even
[41:05] throughout the years that are taking
[41:07] place.
[41:09] But Lord, I'm so
[41:12] thankful that it's not present events
[41:15] that drives the bride to you, but we are
[41:19] drawn by the word of God.
[41:23] drawn by you revealing yourself in the
[41:26] tenderness and sweetness. Lord, we see
[41:29] the things around us. Oh God, we know
[41:31] that without you, we would be wondering
[41:35] as others. But Father, you have removed.
[41:40] This is a day where wondering has been
[41:42] removed.
[41:44] This is a day, Lord, where ignorance is
[41:46] being removed, Lord, from the church of
[41:48] the living God. This is a day, Lord, of
[41:51] certainty.
[41:52] Amen. You said when we begin to see
[41:55] these things, lift up our heads for our
[41:58] redemption drawth nigh. Hallelujah. Oh
[42:01] God, the only way that reason we can see
[42:04] what we see and see the way we do is
[42:06] because, Lord, of your grace that has
[42:08] come, Lord, and anointed our eyes, Lord.
[42:11] And we're ordained for this moment and
[42:13] for this season, Lord. God, with
[42:16] humility in our hearts, oh God, just add
[42:19] to us, Lord. bring us to the place that
[42:21] we need to be. Lord,
[42:24] oh God, I pray, Father,
[42:27] just continue to move among us, Lord.
[42:30] Lord, let our hearts, Lord, just even
[42:32] with a greater sincerity,
[42:36] grant it, Lord, for we love you. All
[42:40] that thrills our heart is Jesus.
[42:44] Lord, it's not out of fear. It's out of
[42:47] love.
[42:49] We love you because you first loved us.
[42:52] Hallelujah. It's not our love that we're
[42:54] loving you with. It's your love. It's
[42:57] your love, Lord. It's what's been
[43:00] projected into our lives. And now our
[43:03] lives are reflecting that same love,
[43:06] Lord. Oh God. And with that moving in
[43:10] our life, surely the grace of God will
[43:13] produce the achievement that has been
[43:16] called for, Lord God.
[43:19] Hallelujah. Thank you for your mercy,
[43:22] Lord. May you bless, Lord, your children
[43:24] tonight. Come among us, Lord, and just
[43:28] help us to step aside in these few
[43:30] moments, Lord. And may we just glean and
[43:33] help us to, Lord, see and to apply in
[43:36] every area of our life. Lord, we love
[43:39] you and we praise you now in Jesus name.
[43:43] Amen and
[43:45] amen. Amen. Let's go to the word of the
[43:48] Lord here tonight in 1 Corinthians 13.
[43:51] And I want to read just a few um
[43:54] scriptures. And uh as we're coming to
[43:56] that, I want to
[43:58] um I want to certainly wish my wife a
[44:02] happy birthday. Amen. And
[44:06] um I'll just say it in this way. Um I
[44:11] I'm so glad that I have her standing by
[44:13] my side.
[44:15] She has um just been such a great
[44:19] blessing and a great help. And uh I know
[44:23] I you know I know the meaning. You know
[44:25] when I first started ministering I could
[44:27] quote certain quotes but really didn't
[44:29] have an
[44:31] understanding and that is when brother
[44:33] Bram said when God calls the man he
[44:34] calls his his wife. Right. And to me,
[44:37] it's so something. I I have told her
[44:38] this over the years, and I mean it more
[44:40] and more. And I said, "If I had known
[44:43] what I know now, I would have chosen you
[44:45] a lot
[44:47] sooner because it's just it's just it's
[44:50] it's perfect of how God has brought us
[44:52] together. And I can say this, I
[44:55] appreciate because of what God has done
[44:57] and the burden that is shared. And you
[45:00] know, it's not just me at times where
[45:02] I'll look over and sometimes at night
[45:05] she's up and there's burdens that
[45:07] striking her heart and she's up praying
[45:10] and different ones that she'll approach
[45:12] me about and say, "Samuel, I've got I've
[45:15] had this on my heart." Sometimes she
[45:17] don't say anything for a while, but I
[45:19] just, you know, God knows what he's
[45:21] doing. And I know and I I know she's not
[45:24] the only one, but I'm so glad that God
[45:27] called us to serve together. Amen. Amen.
[45:29] And all of us together, I'm looking
[45:31] forward to that day when we can set
[45:32] across from the marriage supper of the
[45:34] lamb, we'll say, "It's been worth it
[45:36] all." Every test, every trial, every bit
[45:40] that we've pressed through, everything
[45:42] we've laid aside, it's been worth it
[45:44] all. So, and I also want to say I so
[45:47] enjoyed the services this weekend. Oh,
[45:50] yeah.
[45:51] I I just I so appreciate what the Lord
[45:54] is doing among us. And um I just really
[45:58] I really appreciated uh brother Jeremy
[46:00] just getting out of the way and just so
[46:03] appreciate and you know I appreciate the
[46:05] uniqueness within ministry if there's
[46:08] ever an hour and a time that and and I
[46:10] don't mean this in a wrong way because
[46:13] sometimes you know sometimes a person's
[46:15] personality can just and they have to
[46:17] battle this I'm just going to be
[46:19] different. We don't need that. But we
[46:22] what we do need we need everyone to be
[46:25] who God has made us. Amen. That's what
[46:27] we need. We need that because God that's
[46:30] why God has made us the way that he's
[46:32] made us. God we all don't approach the
[46:34] word the same way and where we look at
[46:36] it. But the end result is is Christ. And
[46:40] uh we I'm so thankful for God's great
[46:42] variety. Aren't you? I appreciate all
[46:45] that. I know in my landscaping I have
[46:47] things that contrast because I want
[46:48] certain things to stand out. And I think
[46:51] it's so beautiful how God so set things
[46:53] in the ministry. And I'm so I just want
[46:55] to say thank you Lord for what you've
[46:57] done for us this past weekend.
[47:00] Amen. Well, let's read. I told you I
[47:02] wouldn't keep you standing. And once
[47:04] again, I I seem to be failing. In verse
[47:08] eight, I want you to notice Paul says,
[47:11] "Charity never faileth."
[47:14] The love of God cannot fail. But whether
[47:17] there be prophecies, they shall fail.
[47:21] And whether they be tongues, they shall
[47:23] cease. Whether there be knowledge, it
[47:25] shall vanish away. For we know in part,
[47:29] and we prophesy in part. Verse 11. When
[47:33] I was a child, I spake as a child. I
[47:37] understood as a child, and I thought as
[47:40] a child. But when I became a man, I want
[47:44] you to notice that word became.
[47:46] That's it's not an event. It's a
[47:49] journey.
[47:51] It's a process. That's good. When I
[47:54] became a man, so becoming is a is a
[47:57] process. I put away childish things.
[48:01] This is one of the key
[48:03] indicators that of becoming a man. Not
[48:06] just because somebody is this stature or
[48:08] let's bring it spiritually. They can
[48:10] quote quotes, quote
[48:13] scriptures. But what's key is they put
[48:16] away childish things. And what's
[48:18] childish things? Speaking like a child,
[48:20] understanding like a child, thinking
[48:22] like a child. This is one of the key
[48:24] evidences of maturity is laying aside
[48:27] childish things. For now we see through
[48:30] a glass darkly, but then face to face.
[48:34] Now I know in part, but then shall I I
[48:38] know even as also I am known. And now
[48:41] abide of faith, hope, charity, these
[48:44] three, but the greatest of these is
[48:47] charity. Amen. May God bless you and
[48:49] bless the reading of the word as you're
[48:51] being seated. This is what I want to uh
[48:54] speak on here tonight. And I had a few
[48:56] different
[48:59] um couple outlines in front of me here
[49:02] and just really have been praying over
[49:03] the weeks on which way to go with this
[49:06] um because we've come through everything
[49:08] here as far as with covering the nine
[49:11] spiritual gifts and I just um and I know
[49:14] that there's uh no doubt there would be
[49:17] questions and I do intend to do that and
[49:20] I've tried to look ahead probably we're
[49:22] looking at a time in June where we'll
[49:24] have just on Thursday night just the
[49:26] questions and answers but from the local
[49:29] assembly here. So I won't be taking any
[49:31] from written in from elsewhere but from
[49:33] the local assembly and um where we'll
[49:35] just focus in on if there's something
[49:37] within this of of church order something
[49:40] within gifts. Um there's a lot more
[49:42] things that I would like to cover that I
[49:44] think that and I'm just going to I'm
[49:46] just waiting on the Lord to see if he
[49:48] wants me to go in that direction right
[49:50] now. but as far as questions and answers
[49:52] on things and we'll just do it centered
[49:54] around uh this and just see how the Lord
[49:56] will will take us uh because I certainly
[49:59] would want to know uh what's on your
[50:01] heart and if there's something that
[50:02] wasn't uh made clear. But we'll try to
[50:05] look at that here a little bit. I've got
[50:06] a few more parts before we'll do
[50:08] questions and answers. And uh I say that
[50:10] because we've got I've got different
[50:12] ministry coming in here that will kind
[50:14] of push me back into June before I can
[50:16] get to questions and answers as well.
[50:18] And so, but before I get into this
[50:21] thought here, um you're aware of today
[50:24] of what took place and that is where the
[50:27] um they have a new pope that's been
[50:29] elected and um you know, very
[50:32] interesting that this pope became a
[50:34] cardinal in 2023. Not been a cardinal
[50:37] very long at all. And uh certainly uh
[50:40] was not even a name I don't think that
[50:43] was even floated. and you heard things
[50:46] concerned um you know even when they
[50:49] would um interview different things with
[50:51] President Trump and many times many when
[50:53] they looked at it and of course you
[50:54] don't know you know you just commit
[50:56] things and for me I'm one you know this
[50:59] as well I don't I don't deliberate over
[51:01] trying to fit prophecy on things because
[51:04] to me that's a waste of time that's a
[51:07] trap because the because here's the
[51:09] message here's the title of the message
[51:11] modern events happenings are made clear
[51:14] by prophecy.
[51:16] Not prophecy makes clear modern events.
[51:19] That's so good. So let the event happen
[51:21] and when it happens there's prophecy
[51:23] that will interpret it. Yeah. So this is
[51:27] I believe this is because you know the
[51:29] greatest thing it's just like when there
[51:30] was things that you know when the it
[51:33] became and this might be a little bit
[51:35] off but I remember when all everything
[51:37] was going on with the blood moons and
[51:39] everything else too and every
[51:40] denominational preacher is preaching on
[51:42] blood moons and when I look at it you
[51:44] know yeah those things are very incred
[51:46] are we can look at it happenings but the
[51:49] real moon that I'm interested in is
[51:50] right here. Hallelujah. I'm interested
[51:53] in this moon reflecting the image of the
[51:56] sun. Yes, sir. I'm interested in this
[51:59] moon reflecting that image and keeping
[52:01] back the waters, holding the waters in
[52:04] their boundaries and saying, "You can't
[52:05] encroach this far on my life or my
[52:07] family." That's that's what I'm
[52:09] interested in. So, and and you say,
[52:11] "Well, Brother Samuel, maybe that's just
[52:12] you." Well, I look at the I look at the
[52:14] pattern of the prophet. He's the prophet
[52:16] of the age. And brother Brandon wasn't
[52:18] fiddling around like in a lab laboratory
[52:20] trying to put puzzle pieces together. It
[52:22] was God that alerted him to even events
[52:25] that were taking place in that hour. And
[52:27] so this is the rest that was within it
[52:30] all is that I know one thing is that no
[52:33] matter how everything plays out, I know
[52:36] in whom I have believed and I'm
[52:39] persuaded that he is able.
[52:42] All that thrills my heart is Jesus. Yes.
[52:45] And so with that, you know, when we look
[52:48] at it here, I wanted to read a quote
[52:50] because I had referred this quote here.
[52:52] Um whether it was the last time I
[52:53] preached on a Sunday or it was a
[52:55] Thursday, I don't remember. But uh I had
[52:58] referred to it and it's actually out of
[52:59] acts of the Holy Spirit. And brother
[53:01] Bram says,"I believe one of these
[53:03] glorious days when this United
[53:06] Confederation of Church goes together
[53:08] and the new pope is brought out of the
[53:11] United States and put over there
[53:13] according to prophecy, then they'll form
[53:17] an image like unto the beast." And I
[53:20] tell you, the true church of God will be
[53:23] drove together.
[53:27] differences will make
[53:29] won't even make any difference.
[53:32] You know, do we believe in this? Do what
[53:34] what will happen is all of the things
[53:36] that's actually
[53:38] been foolishness to focus on will become
[53:41] meaningless. And this is why that in
[53:44] reality we're that's why we're not
[53:46] striving for the unity of faith right
[53:48] now. We're striving for the unity of the
[53:50] spirit.
[53:53] Amen. Amen. You know, so many of you
[53:56] have never been in a place of a
[53:58] ministers meeting. And that's one of the
[53:59] things you you want when you sat down
[54:01] with the ministers or when you know we
[54:03] have had all those pastors together.
[54:06] We're striving for the unity of spirit
[54:07] and you set the direction. We're not
[54:09] here for these certain things and so
[54:10] forth so on. This is what we're here
[54:12] for. And so this is always something and
[54:15] and we all have our own, you know, it
[54:17] doesn't matter if we sat down long
[54:19] enough. There's certain things we'd
[54:20] agree and disagree. But the real thing
[54:22] about it is here's what's important. And
[54:23] I think this just goes uh for anything.
[54:26] We can either choose to focus on our
[54:28] differences or focus on what we have in
[54:30] common.
[54:32] And this is why to me, you know, I don't
[54:34] want a man standing in this pull pit
[54:36] who's firing volleys at somebody else.
[54:38] The devil's already firing volleys at
[54:40] everybody else. And and to me is that,
[54:43] you know, there might be someone, and
[54:44] I've taken this approach with my boys.
[54:46] There's certain things that I can see
[54:47] and I can observe. But you could ask
[54:49] them and say, "Uh, has your dad," and
[54:51] this is not to glorify me. It's just,
[54:53] you could ask them and say, "Has your
[54:55] dad ever said anything negative about
[54:56] any ministry and certain things that
[54:58] are, you know, are taking place or going
[55:00] on?" And I can tell you what they would
[55:02] be able to tell you. They would say,
[55:03] "No." You know why? Because there might
[55:06] be things that is a little off, but
[55:08] that's still a channel God will use. And
[55:11] I don't ever want to tamper with that
[55:13] channel just as much. If someone comes
[55:16] in here and maybe there's something
[55:17] that, you know, I've not ran into it
[55:19] very much, but maybe there may be
[55:21] something a little bit off. Well, we
[55:23] don't discredit everything that was said
[55:25] because it might have been many things
[55:26] that was that was helped. So, we don't
[55:28] want to tear down any vessel. Let's just
[55:31] focus on the truth. That's what Columbus
[55:33] said. Columbus said, you know, he says,
[55:35] I don't believe in focusing on the
[55:37] false. He said, I want to teach the
[55:38] people the truth so that they'll be able
[55:41] to discern the false. Yeah, that's
[55:43] another trap of Satan. I know I'm kind
[55:45] of off right now, but that's another
[55:47] trap of Satan getting us focused on this
[55:49] and differences and you know this is the
[55:51] thing. Brother Bram says if a man in
[55:52] discernment of spirit, if a man is right
[55:55] in his heart cuz some of the things you
[55:58] can see and you know and maybe pushing
[56:00] this or pushing this and and this is
[56:02] where we're at. Listen, I don't believe
[56:04] that people mean to do things in a wrong
[56:07] way. All right?
[56:09] And I'll say this, the prophet said if
[56:11] they're right in their heart and wrong
[56:12] in their doctrine, he said God will
[56:14] straighten it out.
[56:16] That's why I got confidence in it. And
[56:18] so, you know, just as much as I know he
[56:20] straightened me out, so I got confidence
[56:23] in that. And you know, so anyhow, let me
[56:26] get back to this quote because I really
[56:28] want to get into what I want to preach
[56:29] tonight. But I tell you, he said, "The
[56:31] true church of God will be drove
[56:33] together." Now, we know this image has
[56:35] been it's already being formed all
[56:37] along. What what is that image under the
[56:39] beast? It's that those harlot systems.
[56:42] It's where they they have rejected the
[56:44] word of God. They've rejected Christ.
[56:46] And so that's an image that is an image
[56:50] being formed under the beast. But you
[56:51] you know there's a lot of things there's
[56:53] even things that's kind of interesting
[56:54] where there's certain councils that's
[56:56] going to be convened this year in
[56:59] commemoration of the World Council of
[57:01] Churches. There's things that that when
[57:03] you look at it that we have not felt uh
[57:07] the pressures and these things uh as of
[57:10] yet of what that you know that we uh may
[57:13] feel and to whatever degree that it
[57:15] would be and um but we know this one
[57:18] thing when the prophet is speaking this
[57:20] here and I think we can see in the time
[57:23] we're living in I I don't know I just
[57:25] step back and I observe things. I just
[57:27] watch. I I don't even even with my
[57:29] family, I don't say, "Well, this and
[57:31] this and this." And I just don't uh I
[57:33] don't get into a lot of things when a
[57:35] lot of my text threads were blown up
[57:37] today with things and putting things
[57:39] together. But I do think there's some
[57:40] interesting points like uh one brother
[57:43] put in something and I'm just throwing
[57:44] this. This is not anything for a
[57:46] spiritual point. Don't put this on
[57:47] Twitter and say, "Oh my goodness, this
[57:49] is actually this interesting thing is
[57:51] the person took the birth date of this
[57:53] new pope and ran it in a conception
[57:56] calendar and found out that it was two
[57:58] weeks already. This pope that is in
[58:01] there now, two weeks he would have been
[58:02] in the womb when this quote was spoke."
[58:05] Wow. Wow. Just interesting things.
[58:08] Brother Samuel, are you making anything
[58:09] out of it? No.
[58:12] That's right. No. No. No.
[58:16] But I find it to be I find certain
[58:18] things to be very interesting. I also
[58:21] look at words. When brother Bram says
[58:22] that new pope, he didn't say the first
[58:24] pope. Right?
[58:27] So you just you you see what it is. It's
[58:29] like it's like trying to take you know
[58:31] people in a purple dress and fit the
[58:33] prophecy. We don't have to do that. We
[58:36] don't have to do that. Just just you
[58:38] know what? Because let me just tell it
[58:39] like this right here. Even in this quote
[58:41] right here is not going to make somebody
[58:44] get desperate.
[58:47] It's not going to even make somebody
[58:48] bride
[58:50] because the bride, the prophet said, is
[58:52] not driven by national pressures.
[58:56] She's moved by the power of God. That's
[58:59] right. That's right. Cuz it's the word.
[59:02] And and you know, and this right here, I
[59:04] I'm looking at all this and I think, you
[59:06] know, Paul, he he and I had we had we
[59:08] had lunch today cuz we actually a lot of
[59:10] times we we didn't get to connect like
[59:12] that. And so, uh, we had lunch today and
[59:14] I and I just we were talking and just
[59:16] for the first little bit and and we and
[59:18] he said, you know, Dad, I walked into
[59:20] the barber shop today and of course, you
[59:21] know, I didn't go to the barber shop
[59:23] with him, but I haven't been that place
[59:26] for a long time, you know, but but
[59:28] anyhow, we he said, "Dad, I went in
[59:29] there and that was just on the on the
[59:31] TVs at that time and everybody was just
[59:33] kind of quiet and just observing and
[59:35] saying, "Wow, look at this. A a pope out
[59:37] of America." And he said, "Dad," he
[59:39] said, "I I thought as I sat there," he
[59:41] said, "of God giving us understanding to
[59:44] know what's taking place." And I, you
[59:47] know, in this hour and time, thank you
[59:49] just don't even seem good enough. That's
[59:52] right. To say, God, to be able to see
[59:54] what's going on because listen, we would
[59:56] be like everybody else wondering. That's
[59:59] right. We would be wondering at the
[1:00:02] beast because the John wondered, but
[1:00:05] there was a voice that came. There was a
[1:00:07] message. There was a tour guide that he
[1:00:10] had a prophet that said, "Why are you
[1:00:13] wondering, John? Let me pull back the
[1:00:15] mystery behind it. Let me show you."
[1:00:17] That ended the wondering that broke the
[1:00:19] spell. Hallelujah.
[1:00:22] Hallelujah.
[1:00:23] Now, watch how Brother Brand, when he
[1:00:25] says this, in the next part of that
[1:00:26] quote, he says, "The real true believers
[1:00:28] out of Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[1:00:31] Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim,
[1:00:32] holiness, whatever they be." Now, you
[1:00:35] know, we know that there's already been
[1:00:38] a calling out of that and we're not
[1:00:39] we're not sitting around with those
[1:00:41] labels on. But sometimes there's
[1:00:43] different labels that people carry and
[1:00:45] we believe in the gifts or we don't
[1:00:47] believe in the gifts and we believe in
[1:00:48] the moving the spirit. We don't believe
[1:00:49] in that. We believe in this. We believe
[1:00:50] in shouting. We don't believe in shout.
[1:00:52] We believe in this and all these
[1:00:53] different things. And it and it becomes
[1:00:55] lines of demarcation. I said, "God, help
[1:00:58] us to stay free from demarcation
[1:01:02] because I don't want to be known by an
[1:01:05] idea."
[1:01:07] I want to be known by Jesus Christ. All
[1:01:11] I want to be known is that's a believer.
[1:01:14] And let me just tell you, everything
[1:01:16] God's promised, I believe in it.
[1:01:19] I believe in every word of God. I
[1:01:21] believe in emotion. I believe in
[1:01:22] feeling. Everything right because you're
[1:01:25] not going to take that away.
[1:01:28] whatever they be will go together and
[1:01:32] cemented by the love of God that will
[1:01:35] make the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:37] all the believers. So notice what will
[1:01:40] draw together is the love of God. So you
[1:01:44] see when the pressure and things coming
[1:01:47] this is where differences get laid
[1:01:48] aside. This is why when you take
[1:01:50] tragedy, trial and other things, you
[1:01:53] know, sometimes you might have had an
[1:01:54] argument at your house and all of a
[1:01:56] sudden something happens and here you
[1:01:58] are standing in the emergency room with
[1:01:59] your little boy. You know what that
[1:02:01] argument means? Nothing.
[1:02:03] You know what means everything? What the
[1:02:05] what is the doctor saying about our boy?
[1:02:07] What's the doctor saying about a girl?
[1:02:08] And that's the same thing. God knows how
[1:02:11] to allow situations to come about to
[1:02:14] where things that really are meaningless
[1:02:16] become meaningless. Yeah, that's right.
[1:02:19] And so he's working. God's working
[1:02:21] everything out. Daniel said he raises
[1:02:23] and puts up in power and pulls down.
[1:02:25] God's got it all in control. God,
[1:02:27] Listen, it God's got everything in
[1:02:29] control. You know, you can look at and
[1:02:31] say, "Man, uh, this president was sping
[1:02:34] was speeding it up. This one's slowing
[1:02:35] it down." That's what you think. That's
[1:02:37] right. You don't know. But I You do know
[1:02:40] this that everything is ticking right on
[1:02:43] course.
[1:02:45] Nothing's being delayed. There's nothing
[1:02:47] out of hand. Everything is working right
[1:02:49] on course. That's right. Now, you know,
[1:02:53] and you think about this here, one of
[1:02:55] the brothers that sent this and I really
[1:02:56] enjoyed it. Talked about this this man
[1:02:58] right here and um that that has been,
[1:03:01] you know, elected and you know, they
[1:03:03] pointed out never in the history of the
[1:03:05] Roman Catholic Church has there been an
[1:03:07] American pope. Then you have uh
[1:03:10] President Trump. Now, you know, you
[1:03:11] know, I don't have Twitter, so this
[1:03:12] somebody had to send me this. Uh, I
[1:03:14] think that's what it came from.
[1:03:16] Congratulations and brother and not
[1:03:18] brother Trump, but
[1:03:21] [Applause]
[1:03:23] but dear Lord have mercy.
[1:03:29] [Laughter]
[1:03:32] Well, we're here for it tonight, aren't
[1:03:33] we?
[1:03:38] Woo. Who was just named Pope? See, it
[1:03:41] was worth it to come to church tonight,
[1:03:43] wasn't it? You're you're all of that
[1:03:46] heaviness just went poof.
[1:03:49] Uh said it's such an honor to realize
[1:03:51] that he's the first American pope. What
[1:03:53] an excitement and what a great honor for
[1:03:54] our country. I look forward to meeting
[1:03:56] Pope Leo. Whatever. It will be very a
[1:04:00] very meaningful moment. Oh wow. And um
[1:04:04] even you know the man's name and a lot
[1:04:06] of different things is really kind of
[1:04:08] interesting. But once again, brother
[1:04:10] Samuel, what are you trying to make out
[1:04:12] of it? Nothing. I'm just just looking at
[1:04:15] a few things and I think it's
[1:04:16] interesting that the that the prophet of
[1:04:18] God said this and and you know, God sent
[1:04:21] a prophet in this hour. And to me, those
[1:04:23] are little significations in there
[1:04:26] whether this is that pope that that was
[1:04:28] being spoke of or not. You know what? I
[1:04:31] know that God knows what we have need of
[1:04:34] right now. The main thing is I want to
[1:04:36] be ready for that moment.
[1:04:40] I said, Lord, just just mold me, shape
[1:04:42] me, make me, prepare me because the
[1:04:45] Bible said that the marriage of the lamb
[1:04:47] has come and his wife hath made herself
[1:04:51] ready. I want to take the garments of
[1:04:53] the word. I want to be made ready. Amen.
[1:04:56] Amen. So, uh, maybe I'll touch on it a
[1:05:00] little bit more, but I want to just come
[1:05:02] into this place here on with with gifts
[1:05:05] and and the placement of gifts and
[1:05:07] growth and maturity. Um because one of
[1:05:11] the things that we're been looking at
[1:05:13] here with within gifts and I kind of
[1:05:15] started this out in a place where you
[1:05:18] know brother Brandham was talking about
[1:05:20] coming to a place to where that the
[1:05:22] gifts would be you know wanting to see
[1:05:24] them uh put into such a place you know
[1:05:27] having a room and having a separate
[1:05:30] meeting for them and I wanted to want to
[1:05:31] go through this but I want to show you
[1:05:34] in light of growth and maturity but I
[1:05:36] don't want it to be limited to just
[1:05:38] gifts because that's really not even in
[1:05:40] my heart of what I'm just looking at. It
[1:05:42] applies to every part of our life. And
[1:05:45] so when brother Brandham when he he's
[1:05:47] he's speaking to the church and he says
[1:05:50] I let the church now this is in church
[1:05:53] order. This is 63 at the end. He said it
[1:05:55] as it's coming in order come to this
[1:05:59] order. And he he goes into this quote
[1:06:02] and he's talking about how the simple
[1:06:05] order and it you don't have to read it.
[1:06:08] I let me just give you the footnotes on
[1:06:10] it. The simple order where it's coming
[1:06:13] to order is to realize you don't
[1:06:16] interrupt who's doing the speaking. If
[1:06:19] somebody's singing, you don't interrupt
[1:06:21] it. If somebody's if a preacher is
[1:06:23] preaching, you don't interrupt it. Well,
[1:06:25] this is important. The Bible said that
[1:06:27] the spirit of the prophets is subject to
[1:06:31] the prophets. So that's these are basic
[1:06:34] things that the prophet was really
[1:06:36] trying to get across to the people
[1:06:38] according to the scripture is that we
[1:06:40] just don't go according to feelings or
[1:06:44] impressions. Right? And so these are
[1:06:48] things that he's really working with to
[1:06:50] get into that place of order. And he's
[1:06:52] he's been watching it. Now he goes on to
[1:06:54] says now we was a child and Paul said I
[1:06:57] acted like a child. He told the
[1:06:59] Corinthians there I spoke like a child.
[1:07:01] He had a child mind but when I became an
[1:07:04] adult I put away childish things. And so
[1:07:08] I want to say it like this. Maturity is
[1:07:11] a process. It's a journey not an event.
[1:07:15] That's good.
[1:07:17] The Lord Jesus here he came. He comes
[1:07:20] down. The spirit of God sought him out.
[1:07:23] the tabernacle, the dwelling place. All
[1:07:26] along the body, God prepared himself his
[1:07:29] own body. And here led him down to the
[1:07:32] river Jordan. And there as he walked in
[1:07:35] obedience to the word, remember John
[1:07:37] said, "I have need to be baptized of
[1:07:39] you." And Jesus said, "Suffer it to be
[1:07:42] so, for it behooveth us, becometh us to
[1:07:46] fulfill all righteousness." As the
[1:07:50] sacrifice, he had to be washed. Yeah. as
[1:07:53] a incoming priest, he had to be washed.
[1:07:57] Right? And so here as he comes up out of
[1:08:01] the water, the heavens are open. The do
[1:08:03] the dove is descending. The Holy Spirit
[1:08:06] in the form of a dove is descending out
[1:08:09] from heaven and said, "This is my
[1:08:12] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased to
[1:08:15] dwell."
[1:08:16] Not a different person, but God coming
[1:08:19] to the tabernacle that he had made for
[1:08:22] himself and laid claim on it. Amen.
[1:08:26] Amen. And so what was happening? The
[1:08:29] revelation of God was setting down in
[1:08:33] his heart in that moment. That's why the
[1:08:37] Holy Spirit, the quickening power of
[1:08:39] God, it comes to reveal Jesus Christ not
[1:08:43] only to you and I, but once that that
[1:08:47] seed has been quickened, that part that
[1:08:49] God has prepared, now that revelation
[1:08:53] has that place of a pedestal, it's
[1:08:55] setting, it's residing, and our life is
[1:08:58] a reflection of Jesus Christ. It's a
[1:09:02] reflection of what he has done at
[1:09:06] Calvary when he rose on that Easter
[1:09:09] morning. I am the reason.
[1:09:13] It's reflected. So, it's not just
[1:09:15] something I'm believing on, but it's
[1:09:17] something reflected in my life. And
[1:09:20] that's why Paul said, "No man can call
[1:09:22] Jesus the Christ but by the Holy Ghost."
[1:09:25] Right. See in your life when that
[1:09:28] strikes then there becomes the testimony
[1:09:31] that that Jesus indeed is the Christ.
[1:09:37] Then we find from the river Jordan he he
[1:09:40] walks through that journey until coming
[1:09:43] to the end at Mount Transfiguration.
[1:09:46] Then you have the adoption ceremony. So
[1:09:48] adoption is not an event. It's a process
[1:09:53] that's culminated in a ceremony.
[1:09:58] That's the same way in our life from the
[1:10:01] new birth to
[1:10:03] adoption. It's a journey. I wish I had
[1:10:06] more time on this. I'm going to deal
[1:10:07] with a little bit here, but it's a it's
[1:10:09] a journey. And this is why that
[1:10:11] throughout our lives, we learn and we
[1:10:15] grow from the new birth to that of
[1:10:17] adoption. Even things we come to a
[1:10:20] greater realization of certain things
[1:10:23] that we've overlooked and now see the
[1:10:26] value in it. Like even seeing the value
[1:10:32] in being in the house of God.
[1:10:34] Absolutely. It's something that that has
[1:10:36] to come to where it's just not you know
[1:10:38] where it's more than just well I can or
[1:10:40] can't. It begins to see the value. See
[1:10:41] as a person begin and and and God allows
[1:10:44] it to go until they can see the value of
[1:10:46] wait a minute here. It doesn't matter
[1:10:47] what else I've got going on in my life
[1:10:49] if I don't put God first. Yes. Amen. And
[1:10:55] everything else in my life, it's not
[1:10:57] going to be in the correct order.
[1:11:01] And it's really not going to be there.
[1:11:03] There's not the the peace and the
[1:11:05] enjoyment that God even intended for me
[1:11:08] to get out of it. Now, you might say
[1:11:09] something in the natural such as maybe
[1:11:12] hanging kitchen cabinets that that would
[1:11:14] be something that I'm enjoy. Look, there
[1:11:16] ain't a sister in here that don't enjoy
[1:11:17] kitchen
[1:11:18] cabinets right now. We enjoy them when
[1:11:21] there's food in them. I'm not talking
[1:11:22] about the dishes when we enjoy the food
[1:11:24] ones. But you enjoy them. But you see,
[1:11:27] when it's something where you know in
[1:11:29] your life, when you can rest, where God
[1:11:32] has is first in your life in everything,
[1:11:35] then there's things of the natural life.
[1:11:37] You can really you can enjoy it
[1:11:40] according to the measure that God has
[1:11:41] given. And what is that? That's through
[1:11:43] the process of learning. That's right.
[1:11:48] Oh my. Because adoption is the crowning
[1:11:50] achievement of what the new birth has
[1:11:52] started in our life.
[1:11:55] My I wish I could just
[1:11:58] but you'll see we I just want to bring
[1:12:00] it down and apply it through all of this
[1:12:01] here. So it comes through this this
[1:12:04] journey and this process.
[1:12:06] God does not release us into autopilot
[1:12:09] or you know but it's through guidance.
[1:12:12] It's through correction. It's through
[1:12:14] admonition that's given and received.
[1:12:19] And when it's given and received, it
[1:12:22] does not become a framework of
[1:12:25] destruction, but it becomes a framework
[1:12:27] for real growth.
[1:12:30] There's a target, there's a goal, and
[1:12:32] the target never moves. The target is
[1:12:35] the rapture. The target is maturity.
[1:12:37] That never moves. All right? Those of
[1:12:39] you that know as a hunter, you sight
[1:12:41] something in and let's say you may take
[1:12:42] the shot, you look from where you're
[1:12:45] standing, you have a mark and you have
[1:12:46] that target. Uh when you go and look at
[1:12:49] the target, you don't move the target
[1:12:51] and then come back and start trying to
[1:12:52] adjust windage and everything else.
[1:12:54] That's that's that that's confusion.
[1:12:58] God never has moved the target.
[1:13:01] Hallelujah. Amen. Good. Man moves can
[1:13:06] move the target. God doesn't.
[1:13:08] Hallelujah. And that's why brother
[1:13:10] Brandon when he spoke even to and this
[1:13:13] adoption series he says now to you
[1:13:15] legalist brethren he said don't keep
[1:13:17] your church tore up. Just simply tell
[1:13:20] them if they don't have the love of God
[1:13:23] or they love the things of the world
[1:13:25] they've not arrived yet. What's he
[1:13:27] bringing it back to? The love of God.
[1:13:30] Because then it becomes criteria this
[1:13:32] criteria this. It's very simple. The new
[1:13:34] birth is very simple. It's the love of
[1:13:36] God in you working itself out.
[1:13:39] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:13:43] Otherwise, the target's getting moved.
[1:13:44] This one says this. This one says this.
[1:13:46] This one says I got to do this. This one
[1:13:48] says I got to do this. And it's like
[1:13:50] that man who came to brother Brandham
[1:13:51] and said they said I need a prophet.
[1:13:54] Brother Brandham said you don't need a
[1:13:55] prophet, brother. You just went
[1:13:56] straightened out in the beginning.
[1:14:01] Aren't you thankful for the word of God?
[1:14:05] This is why we want to let this mind be
[1:14:07] in us. See, it's something we can
[1:14:09] measure progress by. We can look at our
[1:14:12] life and uh you know, and how God will
[1:14:15] will lead and speak to us. And so, you
[1:14:18] know, brother Brandham, he says it like
[1:14:19] this. And he says when referring to the
[1:14:22] gifts and he's talking to Brandham
[1:14:23] Tabernacle. Now, I'm just going to be
[1:14:25] honest with you here. What brother
[1:14:27] Brandham I just took it off. I want you
[1:14:28] read ahead of me. Brother Brandham,
[1:14:31] yeah. When brother Brandham is talking
[1:14:32] about the gifts
[1:14:34] here, you don't find like the other six
[1:14:37] gifts I just got done. We we preached
[1:14:38] about the time the whole bulk of time
[1:14:41] that brother is dealing with gifts. It's
[1:14:43] actually dealing with three
[1:14:46] prophecy, tongues, interpretations.
[1:14:51] Now you understand knowledge is also
[1:14:53] prophecy because it's beyond that of
[1:14:56] human thinking. Right. Wisdom is also
[1:14:59] some that wisdom that comes from God for
[1:15:01] that situation.
[1:15:03] Right. Discernment is needed because
[1:15:06] that's judging that prophecy that's come
[1:15:08] forth. The Bible said, "Don't let it be
[1:15:11] received unless it's judged
[1:15:14] by three and two of them have to agree
[1:15:18] together." Right? So the majority of
[1:15:21] this and and that's just how it was with
[1:15:23] the Corinthian church. And this is why
[1:15:25] we said before many times when people
[1:15:27] say, "We don't see the gifts in the
[1:15:28] church." Hold on. I know what you're
[1:15:31] talking about. You're talking about
[1:15:32] tongues, interpretation, and prophecy.
[1:15:35] Because the other six gifts can take
[1:15:37] right place, right, while the word's
[1:15:39] being preached. It can take place
[1:15:41] through a card that's sent. It can take
[1:15:43] place through a phone call. It can take
[1:15:45] place right out in the lobby. It can
[1:15:47] take place right through a text. It can
[1:15:49] take place right through somebody going
[1:15:51] and praying for somebody else. and you
[1:15:53] would never know anything about it.
[1:15:57] That's good preacher.
[1:16:00] They're the other gifts, right?
[1:16:04] But they're the higher ones.
[1:16:07] Wisdom being the greatest and tongues
[1:16:10] being the least. Isn't it amazing? We
[1:16:12] always sell ourselves short and we go to
[1:16:14] chasing after that which is the least.
[1:16:16] Now, it's in the economy of God. So,
[1:16:18] you're not we're not doing away with it.
[1:16:19] We're not diminishing it. But let's
[1:16:21] strive like Paul said for the best
[1:16:24] gifts.
[1:16:26] Amen.
[1:16:29] Hallelujah. Cuz we don't have nothing to
[1:16:31] prove to nobody. That's right. God's the
[1:16:33] one proving his word through our lives.
[1:16:35] I mean, all we can look at is I know
[1:16:36] what I was before this token was
[1:16:39] applied. And I know what I am now. And I
[1:16:42] know where I'm going. I I I know I know
[1:16:44] that he's in control. I know he changed
[1:16:46] my life. And this word is my ultimate
[1:16:51] And that's all there is to it. He knows
[1:16:53] about me. My members were written in his
[1:16:55] book before they were ever formed.
[1:16:57] Psalms 139. He knows my name. If he
[1:17:00] knows the name of every star and all the
[1:17:02] stars look alike, but he knows everyone
[1:17:05] by name, how much more me and you.
[1:17:08] [Applause]
[1:17:11] Yes, sir. Absolutely. Hallelujah. Yes.
[1:17:14] This is why brother Brandon when he says
[1:17:15] this in church order, he's talking about
[1:17:18] we don't want no make believe. Right. No
[1:17:20] man, no. No honest person wants to be a
[1:17:22] make believe. If we can't have the real,
[1:17:24] let's not have any all. Let's wait till
[1:17:27] we do get the real. Now, let me can let
[1:17:29] me just put this in perspective. Brother
[1:17:31] Brandham is not saying
[1:17:33] here, we don't know. You know,
[1:17:36] everything's got to be perfect. He's
[1:17:38] talking about the progression of order.
[1:17:41] The first order is if there's no
[1:17:44] interpreter, let them hold their peace.
[1:17:46] Uh-huh. And then if it's interpreted,
[1:17:49] that's prophecy. And before it's
[1:17:52] received, let two or three, let three
[1:17:54] judge it. That's the order, beginning
[1:17:57] order. So there's always a start, a
[1:18:00] beginning to anything, right? I mean,
[1:18:02] no, no major league baseball player just
[1:18:06] all of a sudden walks on the field. No
[1:18:07] doubt. They went through pee-wee league,
[1:18:10] te-ball, uh, little league, and, uh, you
[1:18:13] know, and had, you know, they were
[1:18:14] mama's favorite, and they were daddy's
[1:18:16] favorite, and nobody else on the team
[1:18:17] was like them, you know, all these other
[1:18:19] things. And, and they went through all
[1:18:21] that. No doubt. They went and ran their
[1:18:23] ran their parents crazy, driving them to
[1:18:25] play ball here, play ball there, play
[1:18:27] ball there, play ball, and they they did
[1:18:29] all of that. But you know what? All of
[1:18:31] that is also what led to where they're
[1:18:33] at now. Right. That's right. So, you
[1:18:35] just don't start right out. That's the
[1:18:37] same thing with gifts. Now, not just
[1:18:39] within gifts. That's the same thing in
[1:18:41] fatherhood. That's the same thing in a
[1:18:43] husband. That's the same thing for a
[1:18:44] wife. Same thing for a mother, pastor,
[1:18:46] deacon, on and on, song leader, every
[1:18:48] one of us. It doesn't start out in its
[1:18:51] perfection, but we learn as we grow.
[1:18:56] That's the truth. So good. Amen. So,
[1:19:00] this is this is it's having the real and
[1:19:03] then growing with it, right?
[1:19:06] maturing. And you know
[1:19:09] what? Nobody, if I find you outside
[1:19:11] standing over your landscape in bed
[1:19:13] going, "Hurry up. Come on. Come on. Come
[1:19:14] on. Come on." I mean, I'm can't wait for
[1:19:17] my hydrangeas to blossom either. But
[1:19:20] you're not going to find me out there,
[1:19:22] you know. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[1:19:23] Come on. No. It's going to be released
[1:19:26] in its time. That's right. All I got to
[1:19:28] do is take the holy tone out of the bag,
[1:19:30] move away a little bit of mulch, drop it
[1:19:32] in there, move it back. It's getting
[1:19:33] ready to rain. Let it it it'll it'll
[1:19:35] it'll it'll move into the ground. I'm
[1:19:36] giving it what it needs and it will
[1:19:39] bring forth in the time and the season.
[1:19:43] Right. Is that right? That's so good.
[1:19:45] So, this is the same thing if I can put
[1:19:46] it in our vernacular. God don't want us
[1:19:49] sweating over these things like this.
[1:19:51] You know what he wants us doing is just
[1:19:53] saying, "Lord, I I just praying over
[1:19:55] that about the gifts, praying what what
[1:19:57] God would have for me to do and just
[1:20:00] letting God bring things along in his
[1:20:03] own way."
[1:20:07] Amen. Hallelujah. And he'll always bring
[1:20:09] it according to the word. So now I want
[1:20:12] you I love this statement. I I've got to
[1:20:14] read this out of works as faith
[1:20:16] expressed. I know it's simple, but I
[1:20:17] want to read it. Brother Brmond is
[1:20:19] talking in the beginning of this
[1:20:20] message. Jesus said, now he's talking to
[1:20:21] brother her hoser and he says, you know,
[1:20:23] we've been in this a long time, divine
[1:20:26] healing and preaching. We've seen the
[1:20:28] pros and cons and everything, praying
[1:20:30] for the sick around the world, seeing
[1:20:32] the disappointments of people, seeing
[1:20:34] the hallelujah from every side. Then all
[1:20:37] this we learn by. So what do you learn
[1:20:41] by? You learn
[1:20:43] by the disappointments, why the
[1:20:46] hallelujah. You start
[1:20:48] learning. Brother Bramman says it like
[1:20:50] this. He says, "Now it's like boys when
[1:20:54] you started, we were started preaching
[1:20:56] this, brother Herhoer. I hope I got it
[1:20:58] right. Like you started to swim. The
[1:21:01] first thing you know, it used to be I'd
[1:21:03] get out and brother Jack and brother
[1:21:04] Brown would have to walk me on the
[1:21:06] street night after night to try to get
[1:21:08] me get myself around to myself. I'd
[1:21:11] stand there like a little kid splashing
[1:21:14] the water seeing visions, you know. And
[1:21:17] brother Bram goes on to talk in a few
[1:21:18] paragraphs of how he says he was so out
[1:21:20] of it the one time many times and he
[1:21:22] said I I was just I want to go home. I
[1:21:25] want to go home. And they were trying to
[1:21:26] snap him out of it. You you can't go
[1:21:27] home. And even the next morning he was
[1:21:29] still so out of it. You you can't go
[1:21:30] home. You got another meeting. And
[1:21:32] brother Brand's talking about through
[1:21:34] this where he was at. He said, "I was
[1:21:36] like a little kid learning how to swim.
[1:21:41] And he says, you know, with this, it's
[1:21:44] like you're learning to swim, you know,
[1:21:45] and you splash the water, go across the
[1:21:47] pool,
[1:21:49] and I made
[1:21:51] her. Now, after you learn to swim, oh,
[1:21:55] this is different. More graceful is the
[1:21:57] stroke. And it don't wear you out so
[1:21:59] much. And everyone of us remember when
[1:22:01] people were teaching us how to swim,
[1:22:02] man, they were just like
[1:22:06] swans. It like they're skating on the
[1:22:09] water. Here we
[1:22:11] were grabbing a hold of the side of the
[1:22:13] pool, you know, or something like that.
[1:22:14] And you're struggling. You know why? Cuz
[1:22:17] you're learning.
[1:22:19] You're not where they are, but they're
[1:22:21] there to encourage you that one day
[1:22:24] you'll be where they are. That's right.
[1:22:27] And if they go by the way of the grave,
[1:22:29] you'll advance beyond that.
[1:22:33] That was a little spiritual there. But
[1:22:35] after you learn to swim, more graceful
[1:22:37] is the stroke. and it don't wear you out
[1:22:40] so much. Now, the prophet's talking
[1:22:42] about in his own ministry, he learned
[1:22:43] this. You learn how to do it and cut
[1:22:48] every corner and make it better. And
[1:22:50] that's more of an ease. Amen. So, you
[1:22:54] mean with brother Brandham learning how
[1:22:56] to control, learning, he was not
[1:22:59] diminishing the work of the Holy Spirit?
[1:23:02] Hallelujah. He wasn't taking away. Not
[1:23:05] at all. As a matter of fact, God wanted
[1:23:08] him to learn and to mature. You know
[1:23:12] why? So that God might be even more
[1:23:16] effective through his life.
[1:23:22] Now notice I I love I love these things,
[1:23:24] you know. He says you learn how to do
[1:23:26] it. You cut every corner, make it
[1:23:28] better. And that's more of a ease. In
[1:23:32] other words, when praying for people,
[1:23:34] it's not it's not the how loud or you
[1:23:37] know, I remember like brother Steven
[1:23:38] Abali and brother Timothy and Shawn, we
[1:23:40] were talking one time. He said they pray
[1:23:42] as if they're the ones that are giving
[1:23:43] people the Holy
[1:23:46] Ghost. But you know what that was?
[1:23:48] Brother Timothy and brother Steven, you
[1:23:50] know, and and every one of us are
[1:23:51] different, friends. Look, I'm not saying
[1:23:53] that everybody you have to stand like
[1:23:54] this and do like that. That that's where
[1:23:56] we
[1:23:57] get that's where things get wrong. You
[1:24:00] you God made us who we are. It's just
[1:24:03] like brother Juwel. You brother Juwel he
[1:24:05] would stomp when he would preach. I
[1:24:06] thought he was going to break 2x4s
[1:24:08] underneath here. But that brother Juwel
[1:24:10] everywhere he went. But not everybody
[1:24:11] had to stomp. But if you go up to
[1:24:13] brother Juel and say you don't got to
[1:24:15] stomp, right? One brother was telling me
[1:24:18] that Brother Juwel preaching in in their
[1:24:20] in their in in their church and they had
[1:24:22] a basement underneath the Sunday school
[1:24:23] room. He stomped one time and it the
[1:24:25] fluorescent light came
[1:24:27] off. The next time the pastor, it
[1:24:29] happened. It happened the second time.
[1:24:31] He said, "You do it again. I'm taking it
[1:24:32] out of your
[1:24:32] [Laughter]
[1:24:35] offering." But you understand what I'm
[1:24:37] saying? Uniqueness.
[1:24:39] Sometimes what we're trying to change
[1:24:42] has nothing to do with the spiritual
[1:24:45] part whatsoever. That's true. It just
[1:24:47] has to do with we want somebody to be
[1:24:49] like us. Oh wow. That's so good. God
[1:24:51] wants you to be who he's made you to be.
[1:24:53] Amen. You worship in a certain way.
[1:24:56] Listen, you worship God. You wor you be
[1:24:58] at liberty and worship God in the way
[1:25:01] that he has made you and don't make
[1:25:04] anybody feel make you feel bad for how
[1:25:06] you worship or don't make anybody make
[1:25:09] you feel bad because you're not doing
[1:25:11] what somebody else is doing. We don't
[1:25:14] want to operate under the influence of
[1:25:18] personalities.
[1:25:20] That's true. We want the person of
[1:25:21] Christ to be glorified.
[1:25:25] Now, my goodness, I I tell you, I don't
[1:25:28] think we're going to get anywhere
[1:25:29] tonight. Notice he says, "A little boy
[1:25:33] that never walked would try to walk down
[1:25:35] this aisle here. He'd fall down a dozen
[1:25:37] times and be wore out before he got
[1:25:40] there. But anyone who knows how to walk,
[1:25:42] an athlete would walk right down that
[1:25:45] aisle, never even notice doing it."
[1:25:48] Well, he had to start with, and that's
[1:25:50] what he is now.
[1:25:52] See, it's like in your life. I mean, we
[1:25:54] were like the little just starting out
[1:25:55] walking, right? We were like that. Took
[1:25:57] us forever in a day to get down to, you
[1:25:59] know, you're like, "Ha, I know when they
[1:26:02] first start walking and then the
[1:26:03] grandparents, you got all the time in
[1:26:05] the world. You know, it don't matter.
[1:26:06] They got all the time. They they they
[1:26:08] could take an hour to walk down here.
[1:26:09] Oh, isn't that so sweet? Look at them
[1:26:10] going this way. They got all the time in
[1:26:11] the
[1:26:13] world. You know, it must be a stipen in
[1:26:15] the 401k or something. But at any rate,
[1:26:18] at any rate, the thing of it is is we
[1:26:21] all started in that way, but it's what
[1:26:24] has become in our life. That's the same
[1:26:27] way when God has entrusted us with
[1:26:30] gifts. Amen. Whether it's song leader,
[1:26:32] deacon, trustee, whether it's singing
[1:26:35] specials, whether minister, whatever,
[1:26:37] whatever, every one of us are gifted in
[1:26:40] a certain way. You might be gifted to
[1:26:42] testify. God's entrusted you with that
[1:26:45] gift, but everything we want to do is
[1:26:47] stay humble and learn with it. Amen.
[1:26:52] Brother Bram says that's the same way
[1:26:54] with preaching divine healing or
[1:26:55] anything else. As you go along, you
[1:26:57] begin to learn. And if you don't learn,
[1:27:01] there's something wrong. Right? It's
[1:27:04] like if you're repeating second grade
[1:27:05] all the time, something's
[1:27:07] wrong. Either you're a daydreamer or
[1:27:11] there's something going on, right? So,
[1:27:14] it ought to be a learning. Now, every
[1:27:16] one of us, not every one of us learn the
[1:27:17] same the same the same pace. Right.
[1:27:21] Right. A lot of things sometimes we got
[1:27:23] to come through. You can just look in
[1:27:24] the epistles of Paul, you can find that.
[1:27:27] Ephesians, Romans, Corinthians, and
[1:27:29] sometimes the very things that that were
[1:27:30] affecting their lives. What we don't
[1:27:32] know and what's written in there is
[1:27:34] where they come from.
[1:27:36] Makeup. I'm not talking about makeup on
[1:27:38] the face. I'm talking about their
[1:27:39] makeup, their temperament, complexes,
[1:27:41] everything else. Cuz everything, let me
[1:27:43] just tell you something. We don't get to
[1:27:44] choose what we get in the grab bag of
[1:27:46] life.
[1:27:47] Are you with me? It's like, it's like
[1:27:49] brown paper bags that's been handed out.
[1:27:51] Here's your lunch. You're like, "Boy, I
[1:27:52] hope I got the Doritos. I hope I didn't
[1:27:54] get no apple. I hope I got an orange."
[1:27:56] Y'all remember why that was in school,
[1:27:58] right?
[1:28:00] I hope I got chocolate milk. I want
[1:28:02] white milk. You know, you know how it
[1:28:05] is. We didn't get to choose when we got
[1:28:07] in the grab bag of life.
[1:28:10] But God is achieving his purpose and his
[1:28:14] will through all the flaws that he knew
[1:28:17] would be in our life. Don't try to get
[1:28:21] rid of the flaw. He knew it would be
[1:28:24] there. And the flaw is what makes you a
[1:28:26] masterpiece
[1:28:28] because it's the flaw that gives him the
[1:28:31] opportunity to pour himself in and use
[1:28:33] himself through your life. He takes the
[1:28:36] weaknesses that are surrendered to him
[1:28:39] and he receives glory.
[1:28:43] Oh, it makes you look at flaws totally
[1:28:44] different, don't it? Makes you look at a
[1:28:47] lot differently. Now, let me just, you
[1:28:49] know, looking at this example here, and
[1:28:51] I I'm just I'm not going to be able to
[1:28:52] go on much longer, I know, because of
[1:28:54] time, but let's just look at this just
[1:28:56] for a moment. Let me I'll try to find a
[1:28:58] spot than where we can step off of here
[1:29:01] uh tonight. But look at God's example. I
[1:29:03] want you to watch how God takes the
[1:29:05] Corinthian church opening chapter. These
[1:29:07] are the first words that Paul utters to
[1:29:11] them. Now these are not people who are
[1:29:14] new to Paul. When you read cor first
[1:29:17] Corinthians chapter 1, it's not because
[1:29:18] these are brand new people. Paul, this
[1:29:21] church itself, Paul knows this church.
[1:29:24] Paul has been there. Now watch what he
[1:29:26] says. very first words called to be an
[1:29:30] apostle of Jesus Christ through the will
[1:29:31] of God and Sineses our brother unto the
[1:29:34] church of God which is at Corenth
[1:29:37] compliment to them that are sanctified
[1:29:40] in Christ Jesus compliment called to be
[1:29:44] saints compliment now I know somebody's
[1:29:47] got to be sitting on the edge when is he
[1:29:49] going to burn their hide
[1:29:53] I mean that's for some people that's
[1:29:56] church I don't
[1:29:58] If now look don't don't look down on
[1:29:59] them. Sometimes there people there's
[1:30:01] some people come to church that to them
[1:30:03] it ain't church unless hide's being
[1:30:04] burnt.
[1:30:06] Come on. Sometimes that's their makeup.
[1:30:08] Some that you know what they've got to
[1:30:10] recognize? They got to come to the
[1:30:11] realization of the grace of God.
[1:30:13] Sometime they got to have a trip back to
[1:30:15] recognize just how gracious God was to
[1:30:19] their lives.
[1:30:21] Come on friends. It's just like just
[1:30:23] like brother Jeremy is preaching. It's
[1:30:25] easy to stand right here and say, "How
[1:30:27] could they have chose Barabus? How could
[1:30:29] they have chose this?" Easy to stand
[1:30:30] here and say that on this side. Yes.
[1:30:34] But let us not forget God's grace and
[1:30:36] where he found us.
[1:30:39] And you know what that grace will
[1:30:40] eventually do? It'll take us to a place
[1:30:42] to realize that even in that place in
[1:30:45] our makeup, we maybe we're more strongly
[1:30:46] geared a certain way, but God's grace
[1:30:48] will override that. It'll bring it right
[1:30:50] back in line because there's a place for
[1:30:52] it.
[1:30:53] I said there's a place for it. Is that
[1:30:56] right? Now notice. And with all that are
[1:30:59] in every place call upon the name of
[1:31:01] Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and
[1:31:03] ours. Grace be unto you and Come on,
[1:31:06] Paul. When are you going to burn them?
[1:31:09] Grace be unto you and peace from God our
[1:31:11] father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[1:31:14] remember they they are in a place. Can
[1:31:17] you imagine how it is right now? Don't
[1:31:18] read on the next verse without me. Can
[1:31:20] you imagine how it is right now? They
[1:31:22] are just
[1:31:23] like the the toes start going out of
[1:31:25] their shoes, you know, and and pretty
[1:31:27] soon, you know, they're they're sitting
[1:31:28] back in the lazy boy and they didn't
[1:31:30] have them for church views, but they're
[1:31:31] sitting back and they're getting ready
[1:31:32] to clap. Man, this this is going to be
[1:31:34] good. This is what's happening. God's
[1:31:37] opening them up, right? God knows how to
[1:31:41] open us up.
[1:31:44] Because remember, the word has to be
[1:31:47] received brought in. Amen. And when the
[1:31:50] word is brought in, not our thoughts,
[1:31:52] but the word has life in it. And God
[1:31:54] knows how to open us up cuz this is
[1:31:56] truth. Paul is not putting on or
[1:31:59] preaching fluff. It's not just like, no,
[1:32:03] he's telling the truth,
[1:32:06] but their present conduct is not
[1:32:09] matching the high calling.
[1:32:12] But we're going to get there.
[1:32:14] Hallelujah. We're going to get there.
[1:32:16] And in the meantime of us getting there,
[1:32:18] we're not going to uncristianize you.
[1:32:22] I thank my God
[1:32:24] always on your behalf. Really, this
[1:32:27] church you've got so much reports from,
[1:32:29] if they would have had Twitter in that
[1:32:31] day, Paul's account would have been
[1:32:32] blown up
[1:32:35] drunk in the house of God at the table
[1:32:37] of the Lord. Can you believe that?
[1:32:41] Come on. 1 Corinthians 11.
[1:32:44] Right. Nothing wrong with what they act
[1:32:47] as far as keeping communion, but they
[1:32:48] didn't have the right discernment on how
[1:32:50] to do
[1:32:51] it, man. He would I mean, he would have
[1:32:53] been getting blown up. And can you
[1:32:55] imagine all these post and everything
[1:32:57] else would have been going on in that
[1:32:58] day. Well, no doubt there were rumors
[1:33:00] and everything else going. Can you
[1:33:01] imagine the things that was being said
[1:33:03] against the church of Corinth? This
[1:33:06] prophet of the hour, look at his church.
[1:33:09] Look how out of order it is. Come on.
[1:33:12] This is Paul's church. Look how out of
[1:33:14] order it is. I mean, look at what
[1:33:17] they're doing around his grave marker.
[1:33:19] You You know what I'm saying? You know
[1:33:20] what I mean? Look at all of this and
[1:33:22] look at all of this and on and on. No,
[1:33:26] we don't judge it by everything that we
[1:33:28] see out there. You judge it by the word.
[1:33:32] Amen. Does it stay with the word? You
[1:33:35] don't even judge a man's life by signs
[1:33:36] and wonders. You judge it on whether he
[1:33:39] stays with the word. That's what Jesus
[1:33:41] said in Matthew 24. By their fruits,
[1:33:45] teachings you shall know them because
[1:33:48] there'll be many that'll stand on that
[1:33:49] day and say, "Did we not prophesy?
[1:33:51] Preach in thy name. Do we not cast out
[1:33:53] devils? Do we not do all these things?"
[1:33:54] And he'll say, "Depart from me, you
[1:33:56] workers of iniquity. I never knew you. I
[1:33:59] never had relationship with you.
[1:34:03] You used your gift. You used your
[1:34:05] popularity for for for your own use and
[1:34:08] for the advantage, but you never used it
[1:34:11] for the advantage and the furtherance of
[1:34:13] the kingdom of God. If so, you would
[1:34:15] have submitted it to the word because
[1:34:17] it's the word that's marching on to
[1:34:18] glory.
[1:34:22] I thank my God always on your behalf for
[1:34:25] the grace of God which is given you by
[1:34:28] Jesus
[1:34:29] Christ. Woo! Amen. Glory. that in
[1:34:34] everything ye are
[1:34:36] enriched by him. In all
[1:34:41] utterance and in all knowledge there's
[1:34:44] no lacking. Even as the testimony of
[1:34:47] Christ was confirmed in you. What
[1:34:52] greater commenation could we have than
[1:34:55] that? Amen.
[1:34:57] So that you come behind in no gift,
[1:35:02] waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:35:04] Christ, who also who shall also confirm
[1:35:08] you unto the end, that you may be
[1:35:10] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus
[1:35:13] Christ. God is faithful by whom you were
[1:35:16] called unto the fellowship of his son
[1:35:19] Jesus Christ, our Lord. That's so good.
[1:35:21] When you get home, you can go on and
[1:35:23] read verse 10 and so forth. But Paul
[1:35:25] took nine verses
[1:35:27] to remind them this is who you are.
[1:35:30] Hallelujah. That's so good. Isn't it
[1:35:32] incredible how God will deal with our
[1:35:34] lives? He will take a bulk of a service
[1:35:37] to remind you of who you are. That is
[1:35:40] true. You know why? Cuz that's where
[1:35:41] your confidence got to be in. Not in
[1:35:43] your failures, not in your mistakes, not
[1:35:46] in where the devil has run you down.
[1:35:48] Your confidence has got to be in who the
[1:35:51] word says you are. Heavens and earth
[1:35:54] will pass away, but my word shall never
[1:35:57] fail.
[1:35:59] Is that right? There are three that are
[1:36:02] one in heaven. The father, the word, and
[1:36:05] the holy ghost. So when the holy spirit
[1:36:08] is come, that and the word are no
[1:36:10] different. That when he, the spirit of
[1:36:12] truth is come, he will lead and guide
[1:36:15] you into all truth. That's so good. So
[1:36:17] the holy spirit and the word are not two
[1:36:20] separate people. It is one and the same.
[1:36:22] It's God changing his form.
[1:36:28] Myise.
[1:36:30] So then God, you know, then Paul had to
[1:36:34] kind of work with them. But he wouldn't.
[1:36:35] The thing of it is it's like brother Bam
[1:36:37] tells with deacons and he says with
[1:36:39] other things, don't don't don't don't
[1:36:40] don't don't ever decianize the people.
[1:36:44] Even with things that you know, I say
[1:36:45] just within ministry, you don't strip
[1:36:47] away things of what God has done.
[1:36:50] Correction doesn't merit that. It's just
[1:36:52] like when for our son for our sons and
[1:36:55] daughters, you don't strip away that
[1:36:56] they're your children. You don't go back
[1:36:58] and say, "I got the wrong one at the
[1:37:01] hospital. I know
[1:37:02] it. I knew
[1:37:06] it." Or you look over at the spouse and
[1:37:08] say, "Boy, a lot of your jeans got
[1:37:12] [Applause]
[1:37:16] through." Some of you laughing because
[1:37:17] you know you said that.
[1:37:22] But here's the thing. Let me just can I
[1:37:24] let me just bring this to just to this
[1:37:26] point. I'm just need a few more
[1:37:28] scriptures to drop and then I'm just
[1:37:29] going to stop
[1:37:30] here and we'll just go take a break for
[1:37:32] a half hour and come
[1:37:37] back. That old new pope thing didn't let
[1:37:39] me get where I wanted to get
[1:37:42] to. Now, I knew I was going to have a
[1:37:44] hard time with this one. And anyhow,
[1:37:45] this I I I love the subject on maturity
[1:37:47] and growth and adoption and things. It
[1:37:49] really it stabilizes the people because
[1:37:52] when you realize this is you don't start
[1:37:53] out in perfection, you grow.
[1:37:57] You have a perfect life by a perfect
[1:37:59] birth and you grow into his into
[1:38:00] perfection of Jesus Christ. Is that
[1:38:03] right? Look back. Look back on your life
[1:38:04] right now. You can even look back on
[1:38:06] your life. You don't even think the same
[1:38:07] way about things now that you did a year
[1:38:08] ago. That's right. Think about when God
[1:38:10] first got a hold of your life and when
[1:38:12] this message came across your pathway.
[1:38:13] You don't even think the same way that
[1:38:15] you used to think.
[1:38:18] That's so true. Even sometimes decisions
[1:38:20] that would be made, whether it's about
[1:38:21] coming to the house of God or even with
[1:38:23] prayer and just sometimes the simplest
[1:38:25] of things and you realize now things
[1:38:28] change. Now that ain't everybody. That
[1:38:31] ain't everybody. But you know what?
[1:38:33] Every one of us got areas we got to grow
[1:38:35] in cuz some for some of the other people
[1:38:38] it's actually looking to realize that
[1:38:40] you're not a goody two shoes.
[1:38:44] And if God wanted you with a big long
[1:38:45] nose to look down on everybody else,
[1:38:47] he'd have gave you a big long nose.
[1:38:50] How do we get man alive?
[1:38:53] Oh my. Don't you love the Lord? Maybe
[1:38:56] I'm I'm going to test your love. I'm
[1:38:57] going to be back there to shake your
[1:38:58] hand after church.
[1:39:01] But I love you in the Lord. I love this
[1:39:03] cuz this this message brings this to
[1:39:05] light on that maturity into adoption.
[1:39:08] Hallelujah.
[1:39:10] Hallelujah.
[1:39:14] Wow. You ready for this next part? You
[1:39:18] sure? Brother Bram, here's what he said
[1:39:20] about the Corinthian
[1:39:22] church, brother. Now, Brother Bram had
[1:39:24] to Paul had to lay it in for the
[1:39:26] Ephesian church there. Evidently, you
[1:39:29] you just don't you don't you don't have
[1:39:31] order without it being taught. Right.
[1:39:35] Your kids, you had to teach them. And
[1:39:37] sometimes it it
[1:39:39] Well, it
[1:39:42] Yes, it just took repeated times and
[1:39:48] we'll move on. But anyhow, you you you
[1:39:50] realize everything had to be laid in
[1:39:52] order with Ephesians, the Romans, the
[1:39:54] Thessalonians, the Philippians, every
[1:39:56] bit. But you don't read in those books
[1:39:59] on the order where Paul's actually
[1:40:01] dealing with the Corinthians because
[1:40:03] he's had to come back and correct
[1:40:06] what's going on. So
[1:40:09] correction is needed for further growth.
[1:40:13] Amen. That's true. Amen. That's good.
[1:40:15] Yes, sir. Correction is God's love on
[1:40:18] display to our lives. Lord and
[1:40:20] correction is not a beatdown. Correction
[1:40:23] is this is what's wrong. This is but
[1:40:27] this is where you need to be. And what
[1:40:28] you're looking at is this over here. And
[1:40:29] not so much you're wrong. You
[1:40:30] acknowledge you're wrong. You repent of
[1:40:32] it. But you're looking at the image of
[1:40:33] what you're called to be, how we're
[1:40:35] supposed to and the order and how things
[1:40:36] are to operate. And if we ignore it,
[1:40:39] that don't change my sunship, right?
[1:40:41] That don't mean you're a daughter of
[1:40:42] God. It just means
[1:40:45] you're going to get corrected. Cuz you
[1:40:47] know why? We belong to him. God said, "I
[1:40:50] ain't going to have no youngans that's
[1:40:51] brats."
[1:40:53] There's not one of them is going to be
[1:40:54] spoiled, throw themselves a fit in the
[1:40:56] floor. Well, I can't do it this way. No.
[1:40:58] God said, "No, no, no. No, none of my
[1:41:01] young ones are going to be brats.
[1:41:04] Cuz if they're brats here, they'll be
[1:41:05] brats over there. The rapture don't
[1:41:08] change your your character. The rapture
[1:41:10] is about character.
[1:41:13] Whether it become an achievement here
[1:41:15] and the rapture is all the culminating,
[1:41:18] the crowning of that work that began in
[1:41:21] our life. Hallelujah. Right? Because the
[1:41:24] rapture is in you now. Amen. You've
[1:41:26] already been caught away from the things
[1:41:28] of the world, and it keeps on catching
[1:41:30] away and catching away and catching
[1:41:32] away.
[1:41:33] [Applause]
[1:41:35] I was going to finish this little part
[1:41:36] here, but here's what it was with the
[1:41:38] Corinthians. Look how Brother Bram, he
[1:41:40] makes this simple statement. He said,
[1:41:43] "But he did have to speak to the
[1:41:44] Corinthians continually about it because
[1:41:48] they made it an issue all the time."
[1:41:53] You know why they made it an issue?
[1:41:56] Because they wanted to ride shotgun.
[1:41:58] They wanted to be next to the window. I
[1:42:00] ain't sitting in the middle. Some of
[1:42:02] y'all know where I'm going. You know
[1:42:03] where things, man. We When we were
[1:42:05] younger, man, that mattered.
[1:42:07] Shotgun or it matter. I got window seat.
[1:42:11] Or you know, you get older, you get a
[1:42:12] little bit cooler. I get the very
[1:42:14] back. all the things, you know, that all
[1:42:17] of a sudden in the back of the bus and
[1:42:18] you finally realize if I'm on the back
[1:42:19] of the airplane, back of the bus, I'm
[1:42:21] the last one out.
[1:42:23] And then you finally realize the bus and
[1:42:25] the airplane car, guess what? All going
[1:42:27] the same spot.
[1:42:29] I'm wasting energy yelling shotgun and
[1:42:32] everything else. But just in case we're
[1:42:35] going somewhere, I got
[1:42:40] shotgun. Oh my. Because it made that and
[1:42:43] made an issue all the time. You know,
[1:42:44] this is the thing we want to do. We
[1:42:46] don't want to be on God's list where
[1:42:49] it's like, "Oh, we're on his list of
[1:42:52] handle of a kid gloves. Don't touch him.
[1:42:55] It's touchy. Don't do this." And and
[1:42:57] don't we don't want to be on that list.
[1:42:59] We want to be like when Brother Bram
[1:43:00] spoke to Sister Bruce and he's praying
[1:43:03] for her. He said, "God, don't take her.
[1:43:06] She's such a value and an asset to this
[1:43:11] church."
[1:43:13] That's the kind of lives we want to be.
[1:43:14] I want to be a value and an asset to the
[1:43:17] kingdom of God. Now, that don't mean
[1:43:18] that I everything I do or you do is
[1:43:20] perfect because we get a lot of
[1:43:21] corrections, right? I probably didn't
[1:43:24] get half the spankings I needed. I
[1:43:26] thought I did then.
[1:43:34] Okay. This is where Paul says this. I I
[1:43:37] am I'm coming down. Paul said, "You
[1:43:39] fathers, provoke not your children to
[1:43:42] wrath." In other words, don't don't take
[1:43:43] the spirit out of them. When they've
[1:43:45] done wrong, there's correction that's
[1:43:47] needed. Don't don't bring them to a
[1:43:48] place to where they have no life.
[1:43:50] There's nothing they can get back. In
[1:43:51] other words, the gospel is being
[1:43:52] ministered. The gospel is being
[1:43:53] preached. Don't take it to don't don't
[1:43:55] take Calvary out of view. Calvary is
[1:43:57] what should be in view. That's what real
[1:43:59] correction is. The word correction in
[1:44:01] the scriptures means restoration.
[1:44:05] You see, when the Holy Spirit is
[1:44:06] bringing that on on Saturday night
[1:44:08] through brother Jeremy and how he he
[1:44:10] brought that how the Holy Spirit brought
[1:44:11] that in such a way, it was not so much,
[1:44:14] if I can say it like this, like a black
[1:44:15] and white issue. It was a situation
[1:44:18] showing that the peace, the dove of the
[1:44:20] Holy Spirit that if when that's come
[1:44:22] into your life, there can be
[1:44:24] circumstances to where he'll fly out on
[1:44:26] a limb. But if you just get him back
[1:44:28] into the throne room, Yeah. he knows how
[1:44:31] to put everything else back into order.
[1:44:35] He and and then we as a son of God come
[1:44:37] into authority as we're under his
[1:44:38] leading. Amen. So you see this is why
[1:44:41] that Calvary is what should always be in
[1:44:43] view. Never take the this is what the
[1:44:45] scripture said. Don't do it to wrath to
[1:44:46] where they're exasperated. There's no
[1:44:48] life. There's no there's no get up.
[1:44:50] There's no nothing. But but there's you
[1:44:52] recognize what correction is. It's just
[1:44:54] this correction in this moment, this
[1:44:56] mistake, this failure, and this where
[1:44:57] you're at. That's not your destiny. This
[1:44:59] is your destiny.
[1:45:01] This is to make sure you stay on the
[1:45:02] path to this destiny.
[1:45:05] Aren't you glad God does that?
[1:45:10] Oh, blessed be his name. We're we're
[1:45:12] we're not in an autonomous vehicle. The
[1:45:14] Holy Spirit is our guide. He's guide and
[1:45:16] direct us all the way. This is why Paul
[1:45:18] said, "Don't, you know, don't don't
[1:45:20] exasperate him to
[1:45:22] resentment, but rear him tenderly in the
[1:45:24] training and discipline and the counsel
[1:45:26] and the admonition of the Lord."
[1:45:29] Brother Brham says he knows talking of
[1:45:32] the Lord Jesus. He knows how to
[1:45:34] encourage us in the right matters and
[1:45:36] discourage us in the wrong matters. He
[1:45:39] said we could all learn a good lesson
[1:45:41] right here in running the church and our
[1:45:43] families. And better still, we could all
[1:45:45] learn a lesson in that God deals with
[1:45:47] each of us in exactly this way. And what
[1:45:50] Brother Bram is dealing with is out of
[1:45:51] Revelations chapter 2. He said, "God
[1:45:53] knows there's weakness. He knows there's
[1:45:55] wrong among the church, but he's not
[1:45:57] crying out against it at first.
[1:46:00] He's admonishing them. I know your
[1:46:01] patience. I know your love. I know your
[1:46:04] faith. I know your this. He knows it's
[1:46:07] there. See that? Let see how this comes
[1:46:09] down into such a place of everyday life.
[1:46:12] I mean, how does that work when you go
[1:46:13] and start picking
[1:46:15] apart the biscuits? You don't pick apart
[1:46:18] the biscuits. Say, you know what?
[1:46:20] They're nice. These are nice crispy
[1:46:23] things. No, don't say that. You'll get
[1:46:24] hit with a pan. But you understand what
[1:46:26] I'm saying? You don't you don't go start
[1:46:28] picking apart the negative things,
[1:46:30] right? You see, sometimes, listen
[1:46:32] friends, sometimes these are simple
[1:46:34] things that we think, oh, it's just
[1:46:36] spiritually osmosis. Sometimes that's
[1:46:38] sometimes for for in our lives, we're so
[1:46:41] interested in getting to the point that
[1:46:44] we forget to make the pathway before us.
[1:46:48] The Bible said, "Prepare ye the way of
[1:46:51] the Lord." How do we prepare the way of
[1:46:54] the Lord? through divine love. How do we
[1:46:57] prepare the by our hearts being
[1:46:59] reconciled to his character? Not I'm
[1:47:02] going to straighten this out. And and
[1:47:04] many times what it is, it isn't
[1:47:05] necessarily what's been said that's been
[1:47:07] wrong is we haven't prepared the way of
[1:47:10] the Lord. That's what David did with
[1:47:12] Nathan, right? If David would have
[1:47:14] walked in there and said, "Nathan, what
[1:47:16] in the world have you
[1:47:19] done?" It wouldn't have worked. But what
[1:47:22] did he do? He opened him up. His
[1:47:25] reasoning came to that place. It opened
[1:47:26] him up to where he could eventually
[1:47:29] speak and say, "You're the man." And
[1:47:32] David could recognize it. Aren't you
[1:47:33] glad God does that? Now, you know what?
[1:47:36] As much as you would try to, "Oh, I'm
[1:47:38] going to really I'm going to really
[1:47:39] discern this out. I'm not going to get
[1:47:40] on the edge of my seat. I'm not going to
[1:47:41] get opened up like that." How can you
[1:47:43] not be in love with the Lord? That's
[1:47:46] good preacher. Yes, sir. How can you
[1:47:48] see? That's what the ministering of the
[1:47:49] word. It's the love of God that's
[1:47:51] coming. That's how even correction
[1:47:53] comes. Correction is all about love. How
[1:47:56] many things has God tolerated in our
[1:47:58] life? Sometimes even he said it over and
[1:48:01] over. He sent reminders even he might
[1:48:03] even send reminders through others
[1:48:04] you'll stream and other things like that
[1:48:06] and we'll just ignore it, put it off.
[1:48:08] Sometimes don't even catching it.
[1:48:11] Sometimes it isn't about we don't want
[1:48:12] to do it. Sometimes we're just not even
[1:48:14] catching it, but then all of a sudden we
[1:48:17] catch it.
[1:48:21] Let's stand. Let's stand.
[1:48:27] Paul said it like
[1:48:29] this. Said, "I'll come to you
[1:48:31] shortly." And Timothy and I'll tarry
[1:48:34] with you. How long, Paul? An hour, two
[1:48:37] hours, couple days. No, I'll tarry I'll
[1:48:39] tarry along if I have to tar long. In
[1:48:42] other words, I'm going to stay with
[1:48:43] you
[1:48:45] until thou knowest that thou mayest know
[1:48:48] how thou oughtest to behave thyself in
[1:48:51] the house of God, which is the church of
[1:48:54] the living God, the pillar and ground of
[1:48:57] the
[1:48:58] truth. See, this is why even as God
[1:49:01] deals with our life right through his
[1:49:04] word, he he the Bible said that the
[1:49:07] goodness of the Lord leads us to
[1:49:10] repentance.
[1:49:11] And it's even how God has drawn us to
[1:49:15] himself. You know, you weren't drawn to
[1:49:18] God because somebody counted down an
[1:49:20] altar call, right? All right. I'm going
[1:49:22] to start at 10. I've been there. I've
[1:49:26] been there. I've said under but that see
[1:49:29] because why? If you if there if you're
[1:49:31] scared into it, it that ain't love. It
[1:49:35] won't hold. What it is is to see him
[1:49:39] what he did for you. And this is why
[1:49:41] that even even when the ministry of the
[1:49:43] word when God deals with things
[1:49:45] sometimes and maybe our attitudes or
[1:49:47] he'll deal with dress. He'll deal with
[1:49:49] clothing. It's so much deeper than that.
[1:49:51] It's so much deeper. It's a character.
[1:49:54] It's a characteristic that God is
[1:49:56] dealing with. And we can see in his word
[1:50:00] and that's where something rises in our
[1:50:02] hearts like it did. Even when the Lord
[1:50:05] touched our lives like it did those on
[1:50:06] the day of Pentecost, they said, "What
[1:50:08] must we do to be
[1:50:11] saved?" And then Peter gave out the
[1:50:14] prescription,
[1:50:16] repent, be baptized in the name of the
[1:50:18] Lord Jesus Christ. See, they needed
[1:50:21] instruction. They need an instruction.
[1:50:23] Sometimes this is why here we are
[1:50:24] sitting in a service and I understand
[1:50:27] the revealing of the word has come. But
[1:50:29] I wonder if God wouldn't test us
[1:50:31] sometimes if something was brought. And
[1:50:34] I don't want to say it's elementary, but
[1:50:36] if God would bring something so simple,
[1:50:38] I wonder if it's also not only to
[1:50:39] minister and to help somebody else, but
[1:50:41] I wonder if it's also to test us to see,
[1:50:44] ah, we're beyond this. Well, not
[1:50:46] everybody may be. And sometimes testing
[1:50:49] our maturity and part of our growth is
[1:50:52] to see are we willing to sit there and
[1:50:54] glean. We might that might have been
[1:50:55] something God's already done in our life
[1:50:57] and we're able to worship. We're able to
[1:50:59] be part of creating an atmosphere that
[1:51:01] the Holy Spirit can drive back anything
[1:51:04] that's holding a person because when a
[1:51:06] person hasn't fully surrendered to God,
[1:51:08] it isn't many times because they don't
[1:51:09] want to. There's a spirit that's holding
[1:51:12] them back. It's not that the person's
[1:51:14] bad. It's a spirit that's holding them
[1:51:17] back. But this is what the preaching of
[1:51:19] the gospel is for. is to cast that
[1:51:21] spirit away so that they can come to
[1:51:24] that place that is already in their
[1:51:26] heart they're longing for. And so I and
[1:51:28] part of maturity is creating the
[1:51:30] atmosphere. You know, it gets to a spot
[1:51:32] to where you can go to a birthday party
[1:51:34] and you're not upset that you're not
[1:51:36] getting gifts.
[1:51:38] That's good. You know what I mean? We've
[1:51:40] all been around. We've all had we've all
[1:51:41] had nephews, nieces, cousins, and
[1:51:43] everything else. You know, man, they
[1:51:45] they had to. And then you finally get to
[1:51:46] a spot and you can realize you can enjoy
[1:51:49] somebody else's birthday, right? You can
[1:51:52] you can sing for them instead of
[1:51:55] pouting. But you know what? You know
[1:51:57] what did that? Maybe a few hide tannins
[1:51:59] and things like that. But but but what
[1:52:01] happened is you learn from it and then
[1:52:03] you finally mature and you're like,
[1:52:04] "Hey, you know what? I'm gonna get cake
[1:52:05] anyhow. Let's just have a good old
[1:52:07] time."
[1:52:09] Hallelujah. Gifts. I don't I don't need
[1:52:11] any gifts. I mean, after all, I mean, I
[1:52:13] work at Chick-fil-A now. I mean I
[1:52:19] can you wonder now some of you looking
[1:52:21] at me like oh man brother Sam you're
[1:52:23] having the people laughing a lot tonight
[1:52:24] I know where I'm at believe me I can
[1:52:26] give you the quote out of the fourth
[1:52:27] seal at the end of the seal where the
[1:52:30] prophet says watch he said you'll notice
[1:52:31] he said there's certain things I've said
[1:52:33] he said to get you laugh he said I turn
[1:52:34] right back around and drop something I'm
[1:52:36] not doing anything on purpose but you
[1:52:38] know what I am enjoying my salvation
[1:52:42] his presence is here it's this that's
[1:52:44] just how God has made me. It's how God
[1:52:46] But you know what? The word of God is
[1:52:48] still going forth right now to realize
[1:52:50] there's certain things that now that you
[1:52:52] realize. Why did I make that such a
[1:52:54] priority?
[1:52:58] That's so good. But you know, one thing
[1:52:59] that is the most thing that we want that
[1:53:01] should be the ultimate priority is
[1:53:03] pleasing him.
[1:53:05] Don't ever lose that. That that that's
[1:53:08] what it was that started with that
[1:53:09] instruction. Repent. be baptized in the
[1:53:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, not in
[1:53:17] titles, but in his name,
[1:53:21] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:53:24] Holy Ghost. See, God gave the
[1:53:26] prescription. You know why? God's
[1:53:29] interested. He's interested in us. Don't
[1:53:31] you love him? He's interested in his
[1:53:34] word.
[1:53:36] And I say, "Lord, help us. Help me. Help
[1:53:40] us as a church. Help me as a father.
[1:53:41] Help me as a husband. Help me as a
[1:53:43] pastor. Help me. Maybe you as musician.
[1:53:47] Maybe you young person. On and on.
[1:53:49] Listen friends, every one of us, it may
[1:53:51] not be one of these nine spiritual
[1:53:52] gifts, but I want you to put yourself
[1:53:54] into this. We all in our lives are in
[1:53:57] journey.
[1:54:00] We're all in journey. We're all in
[1:54:02] process. Some of us are in different
[1:54:03] places right now. Sometimes there might
[1:54:05] be in places that my there's hurts.
[1:54:07] There's things that you can't even make
[1:54:09] sense of right now. But I want you to
[1:54:11] remember God is not the author of
[1:54:14] confusion.
[1:54:17] The prophet tells us he has a purpose
[1:54:18] for everything that he permits and
[1:54:21] allows to come our way. I want to say,
[1:54:24] Lord, help me. Help me. Give me the
[1:54:27] grace for the season that I'm in. Help
[1:54:31] me, Lord. Help me. I don't want to I
[1:54:33] don't want to bypass this season. My
[1:54:35] flesh does. My spirit might, but I don't
[1:54:38] want to bypass this season because it's
[1:54:42] necessary. Help
[1:54:44] me. Could we just go to him in prayer
[1:54:47] right now?
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:51] Father, Lord
[1:54:53] Jesus, certainly Lord, not like what I
[1:54:56] thought it would go like here
[1:54:58] tonight, Lord. In looking over these
[1:55:00] things, Lord, my heart just so
[1:55:03] thrilled because you can see it Lord
[1:55:05] through every aspect of
[1:55:08] life. I see it, Lord, not only, Father,
[1:55:11] within the nine spiritual gifts, but I
[1:55:14] see it, dear God, in the five
[1:55:15] ministerial. I see it in a husband,
[1:55:18] father,
[1:55:19] mother, wife, brother, sister, young
[1:55:23] people. Lord, I see it, Father, through
[1:55:26] every part of our life.
[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:30] maturity. It's a process, a journey, not
[1:55:35] an
[1:55:36] event. Oh Lord God, help
[1:55:40] us Lord throughout this building. No
[1:55:43] doubt many different seasons of
[1:55:47] life. Some in the youthfulness, some
[1:55:50] middle, some
[1:55:51] older. Lord God, I'm asking for
[1:55:55] grace for this season we're in.
[1:55:57] [Music]
[1:55:59] And Lord
[1:56:01] Jesus, like you spoke to the Corinthian
[1:56:05] church, you speak to us the same
[1:56:08] [Music]
[1:56:09] way. Lord God, I wonder within one
[1:56:15] service how that you would approach to
[1:56:17] remind us always who we are. And that's
[1:56:21] exactly what the prophet tells us as
[1:56:23] ministers in how can I overcome. He said
[1:56:27] the ministers start and they study and
[1:56:30] among their congregations. He said they
[1:56:31] they study study those places those weak
[1:56:35] places not picking it out but
[1:56:38] realizing that God has called us to
[1:56:40] more. And he said then to catch from
[1:56:43] where we are to where we need to be.
[1:56:45] Lord I'm so glad. I I'll just say it.
[1:56:49] [Music]
[1:56:51] Lord, if Lord God you couldn't use
[1:56:55] me, if there's something, Lord, to where
[1:56:58] that it would be, Lord God, I never want
[1:57:00] to leave the people in the
[1:57:02] place where maybe they're at. But I
[1:57:05] want, Lord, my heart's desire is not
[1:57:08] only to recognize where we are, but to
[1:57:10] recognize where you've called us to be.
[1:57:13] to recognize that high calling and to
[1:57:16] press towards it, Lord, and to recognize
[1:57:18] it will not be by human merits or
[1:57:20] achievement. It will be by the operation
[1:57:23] of the quickening power of God, Lord, as
[1:57:26] we can
[1:57:28] yield, yield our lives to you. Help us
[1:57:32] to yield,
[1:57:33] Lord. Father, sometimes I wonder where
[1:57:37] you would set a
[1:57:40] service, even begin to deal with our
[1:57:42] hearts before coming
[1:57:44] here. The songs that would be
[1:57:46] sung. Then you would take maybe specials
[1:57:50] that would be sung. And then you would
[1:57:53] take a gift in a man's
[1:57:56] life. And throughout that
[1:57:59] service, perhaps it's been an hour and a
[1:58:03] half that's
[1:58:04] passed and he's five minutes from
[1:58:07] closing. And that whole hour and a half
[1:58:10] and even prior to that was all
[1:58:13] conditioning for what you would do in
[1:58:17] maybe one minute's
[1:58:20] time or two minutes or three minutes.
[1:58:24] Oh God, if you will take that much time
[1:58:28] and that much
[1:58:30] consideration, help us Lord. Help us
[1:58:34] with our families. Help us with our
[1:58:36] children. Help us with the church. Help
[1:58:38] us with one another Lord. Help us with
[1:58:40] our wives. Help us with our husbands
[1:58:43] Lord. Because after all, this is what we
[1:58:46] pray about and we sing. To be like
[1:58:49] Jesus. Lord, I may never walk on the
[1:58:53] water. I'm I'm not aspiring for that.
[1:58:55] But if I can if I can be a part of that
[1:58:58] and that would be fulfilled in
[1:59:00] me and in the rest of this
[1:59:03] congregation to where Lord that even in
[1:59:06] our approach it might be in an hour and
[1:59:08] a half
[1:59:10] approach for one moment's work maybe
[1:59:14] only a minute maybe only a
[1:59:17] sentence God help
[1:59:19] us help us Lord I know that comes
[1:59:23] through maturity it's not us pushing
[1:59:25] pushing, shoving. These aren't the three
[1:59:27] pushes, the three pulls is what it is.
[1:59:31] It's not shoving. We don't have to do
[1:59:33] that to get in
[1:59:35] position. It's your grace that's
[1:59:37] bringing us in
[1:59:38] position. It's not so much, Lord, a
[1:59:41] physical place. It's where the word just
[1:59:44] coming to a greater place of preeminence
[1:59:46] in our
[1:59:47] lives. Help us
[1:59:49] Lord. Anyone want to be remembered in
[1:59:51] prayer? Lord
[1:59:53] Jesus. Yes, Lord. Grant it, Lord, in
[1:59:57] each of our
[1:59:58] lives. Lord God, you know where each of
[2:00:01] us are at. You know where every heart is

[2:09:36] [Music]
[2:09:44] And aren't you glad
[2:09:47] that if your sights get a little bit off
[2:09:50] and and they have at times you get to
[2:09:53] looking and remember brother Brandon
[2:09:55] said that those in the back of the line
[2:09:59] he said what they was watching they was
[2:10:00] watching what was going on with that
[2:10:02] church
[2:10:03] was going off. Maybe they're trying to
[2:10:06] put all kinds of things together and
[2:10:08] this and that
[2:10:10] instead
[2:10:11] of looking to him.
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:15] And aren't you glad you're in tune to
[2:10:17] where you can hear that voice? And that
[2:10:18] voice said, "Get back in step."
[2:10:22] Hallelujah. Most importantly, not only
[2:10:24] you can hear it, but there's something
[2:10:25] on the inside that says,
[2:10:28] "It just lines right up." Hallelujah.
[2:10:31] You know why? It fits your life like a
[2:10:33] glove. That's right. Hallelujah. It's
[2:10:35] the matchpiece to your life. When this
[2:10:38] message, this life, the Holy Spirit has
[2:10:40] come, you know what it does? It takes
[2:10:42] dirty clothes and makes clean clothes
[2:10:44] out of them. Hallelujah. And you know
[2:10:46] what it does? It takes things that's
[2:10:48] been dirty rags. And what you see is the
[2:10:50] image of Christ.
[2:10:52] One time only thing this thing could
[2:10:54] display one time was nothing but filth.
[2:10:57] That's right. But when he camel,
[2:11:00] he took the dirty rags of my life
[2:11:03] through the process of justification,
[2:11:06] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[2:11:08] Ghost, bringing forth his image.
[2:11:13] And the queen walked in and she saw her
[2:11:15] image on that paper and she said,
[2:11:17] "Where'd you get that paper?" "Oh, you
[2:11:20] see this pack, this stack of dirty
[2:11:22] rags? That paper is yesterday's
[2:11:25] laundry."
[2:11:27] Glory be to God. You look at your life,
[2:11:29] how God has taken your life and my life.
[2:11:31] You know what he's done? Take it through
[2:11:32] a process. He sure has. And I'm so glad
[2:11:35] that he's still working on this, aren't
[2:11:36] you? Amen. Hallelujah. Blessed be the
[2:11:39] name of the Lord. I think we could go
[2:11:41] another hour. I'm
[2:11:43] just God bless you. I I I pray you have
[2:11:45] a good night's rest
[2:11:47] tonight. I pray you have a good rest. Oh
[2:11:50] my. God, Terry's, may God help us on
[2:11:52] Sunday. Amen. Give us grace. Amen. Could
[2:11:55] we just go singing this song? He's still
[2:11:59] working on
[2:12:01] me to make me what I ought to
[2:12:06] be. Well, it took him just a week to
[2:12:09] make the moon and stars, the sun and the
[2:12:13] earth and
[2:12:15] Jupiter. Oh, and patient. Amen. God
[2:12:19] bless you tonight.
[2:12:21] He's still working on me. I'm so glad
[2:12:25] he's still working on me
[2:12:30] to make me what I ought to

[2:12:40] the earth and
[2:12:42] you. Oh, how loving and patient he must

[2:12:56] reflection.
[2:13:00] [Music]
[2:13:02] Oh, that's
[2:13:05] right. And he
[2:13:06] [Music]
[2:13:08] knows

[2:13:21] be. Oh, it took him just a week to make
[2:13:25] the moon and stars, sun and the earth,
[2:13:31] Jupiter. How loving and patient he must
[2:13:36] be. Oh, he's still working on
[2:13:42] you. They ought to be silent upon my
[2:13:46] heart. Don't judge me if there's any
[2:13:51] confus but I'll be perfect just
[2:13:55] according to his plan fashion by the
[2:14:01] master's for he's still working on
[2:14:05] [Music]

[2:14:19] earth, Jupiter Mars. How loving and
[2:14:24] patient he must

[2:14:27] be. He's still working on
[2:14:31] me. Oh, how loving and patient he must
[2:14:35] be.
