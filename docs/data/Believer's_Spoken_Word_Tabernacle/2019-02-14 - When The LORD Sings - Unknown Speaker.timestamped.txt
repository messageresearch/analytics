[27:41] service here tonight and just speak to
[27:44] our heart we all have needs we all have
[27:48] needs and you know as much as we could
[27:51] try to when we would hear a need to try
[27:54] to speak to it and yet if it's not under
[27:58] his unction and direction even our
[28:01] greatest attempts would be futile but
[28:05] all it takes is his presence all it
[28:09] takes is him coming by and there is
[28:12] things that are able to open and answers
[28:15] to come that even that we and ourselves
[28:17] would not have even thought or even put
[28:20] together but in his presence he opens
[28:24] and he makes known his way and just to
[28:28] always remember he never slumbers or
[28:31] sleeps he knows exactly all of our needs
[28:38] and for us as believers this is not just
[28:41] a phrase this is a reality
[28:43] amen let's just stand and we'll look
[28:46] right into the word of the Lord we want
[28:48] to go right to Exodus 15 and I want to
[28:51] read just a little bit from there
[28:54] tonight
[29:06] Exodus 15 and would just read a few
[29:08] verses of Scripture here to begin with
[29:12] verse 1 then saying Moses and the
[29:15] children of Israel this song unto the
[29:17] Lord and spake saying I will sing unto
[29:20] the Lord for he hath triumphed

[29:31] strength and song and he has become my
[29:35] salvation he is my god and I will

[32:44] freely Lord in a real personal way
[32:47] tonight we pray in the name of Jesus
[32:50] Christ amen amen god bless yous your
[32:53] being seated I'm gonna ask you tonight
[32:57] if you'll just kind of bear with me here
[33:00] we you know when you get to looking at
[33:03] something I am eight tonight just kind
[33:05] of run in the looking at things that are
[33:08] laying prophetic in the scripture and
[33:10] you find that things that here with in
[33:14] Exodus 15
[33:18] fifteen that were actually smoking that
[33:22] were part of the prophecy don't worry
[33:26] I've got that my great that was given
[33:31] even concerning of Israel coming coming
[33:34] into their position into the land even
[33:38] now and you find that there are men
[33:40] there are other parts that were even
[33:42] typed and spoken here even of in Exodus
[33:46] 15 but you know I want to look at at the
[33:49] part that here you find in the book in
[33:52] this first stage of the journey and that
[33:55] of Exodus of how that God has brought
[33:59] Israel and he has taken care of of their
[34:04] enemies and we look at a song like last
[34:07] week we looked at that particular phrase
[34:09] the Lord is my strength and my song and
[34:13] that very thing is that he's not just a
[34:16] part of the song he is the song he is
[34:20] the melody and that's the very word he's
[34:23] the melody he's the heart he's the theme
[34:25] it's not it's not something within this
[34:27] song that you have to wonder who are we
[34:30] talking about it's very clear he's the
[34:33] he's the song he's the melody of our
[34:35] lives and when you think of it you know
[34:38] you look at songs when songs are being
[34:41] sung you know you come in to a service
[34:44] and we know that within a service you
[34:47] know the songs itself it goes before the
[34:50] battle and we can see many times you
[34:53] walk into a service and how that the
[34:56] songs and I believe that we need the
[34:59] leadership of the Holy Spirit in every
[35:00] part of the service it's things that not
[35:03] just among the song leader but we need
[35:05] it among the congregation and I believe
[35:08] that that that's something that we
[35:09] welcome and we recognize that their God
[35:14] his desire is that we would worship Him
[35:16] in spirit and in truth and to recognize
[35:19] that we each have a great participating
[35:22] role and it isn't so much so that you
[35:25] know that maybe you don't have as you
[35:28] would think maybe the greatest voice or
[35:30] maybe your voice isn't it
[35:31] or or what-have-you but it is where that
[35:34] you yourself are coming in and you are
[35:37] blending and giving your all with what's
[35:40] going on you may not be in as I said
[35:43] maybe having the strength to sing and it
[35:45] may be that maybe some songs or so forth
[35:49] and a new song is introduced but yet
[35:51] even as that would come along you us
[35:54] when we come in here we look for one
[35:57] purpose we're here to worship the Lord
[35:59] even the songs of Zion that are sung
[36:03] we're here to come into that place and
[36:06] say as we singing it and Lord just
[36:09] making it real to me and entering into
[36:12] those songs and we realized that this is
[36:14] not a show this is not anything that's a
[36:17] put-on and we're not interested I'll say
[36:20] it like this I believe that even when
[36:22] you look at musicians and everything
[36:24] else we want to do our very best unto
[36:26] the Lord but to remember that you know
[36:29] it's always important it's just like
[36:31] when you're singing we're not here that
[36:33] we hit every note just right because
[36:35] when we get worried on that we're
[36:37] worried about ourselves we're not
[36:39] worried that we get everything else
[36:41] right what we are worried and what we're
[36:43] not worried but what we're focused on is
[36:45] is we want to follow the unction of the
[36:47] Holy Spirit sometimes you come into a
[36:50] service and there's what you don't
[36:51] realize is that there's all types of
[36:53] spirits that's battling because if the
[36:55] enemy can get things thrown off from the
[36:58] very beginning then what he looks at is
[37:01] that our focus would be upon that and
[37:03] then it prevents what he knows God is
[37:05] going to do because you see Satan
[37:08] himself cannot stop what the man of God
[37:11] under inspiration is receiving from God
[37:13] and Satan has enough to know that when
[37:16] that inspiration is coming and that
[37:18] where he can look over you know the
[37:20] shoulder and so forth and see it as
[37:21] you're studying knows the things I'm
[37:23] putting down and everything else and he
[37:25] recognizes that if this word if it's
[37:28] having its free course it's gonna bring
[37:30] deliverance in lives
[37:32] it's gonna bring help so Satan will try
[37:34] to do everything he can to try to hinder
[37:37] that or to try to dismantle it but it's
[37:39] this is where that we as people of God
[37:42] and maybe you know tonight as I speak
[37:44] maybe two more
[37:45] mature Christians and things in this
[37:47] manner to heckle this that within all of
[37:50] our hearts let us recognize that when
[37:52] there are tough times that come up when
[37:55] there's things that we're notes aren't
[37:57] hitting just right let's have that heart
[37:59] of a comfort and an understanding and
[38:01] say I'm gonna get right in there and I'm
[38:03] gonna just blend right in with this I'm
[38:05] gonna pull right on I'm not going to say
[38:07] why didn't you hit the right note why
[38:09] didn't you do this right why I'm just
[38:11] following him now
[38:12] why didn't you do this right but you see
[38:14] we can look around but remember here
[38:16] it's not us hitting the right note of
[38:18] singing the right note that is
[38:20] perfection perfection is him the perfect
[38:23] one coming in our myths and him
[38:26] ministering to our lives so what that
[38:28] means is sometimes it's for us to wear
[38:31] that we have to come in and in order to
[38:33] be a part of the service we've got to be
[38:36] willing to give ourselves there's times
[38:38] where you know you you might look at
[38:40] something to wear that how a service or
[38:42] maybe how songs and how God has directed
[38:45] you know the song leader and so forth
[38:46] even those who sing specials to to have
[38:50] a burden you know to sing a song and you
[38:52] know when you come in it's always a
[38:54] choice that you can you know maybe you
[38:56] don't feel like you know it worshipping
[38:58] it's just something that you just seem
[39:01] like that man I mean you know you're
[39:03] down you're discouraged it seems like
[39:05] everything that's been against you now
[39:07] I've been there I know I know what
[39:08] that's like as well where you don't feel
[39:11] like that but yet in the midst of that
[39:13] time there's something that within you
[39:15] to recognize that if you can just yield
[39:18] and override that that you know that
[39:20] just like what God did for Paul and
[39:23] Silas it wasn't that the situation
[39:25] became more comfortable it's that they
[39:28] themselves begin to embrace and they
[39:31] begin to worship God now you know when
[39:33] we read the scriptures brother ray we
[39:35] don't know how that all started out we
[39:37] know brother Ram talks about maybe that
[39:39] you know he said it was just like a foot
[39:41] tap or whatever more but what you don't
[39:43] know is here's what started that all out
[39:45] maybe it was just something where Paul
[39:47] would look at Silas and say ain't God
[39:49] good we don't know but we know something
[39:53] itself had to be a source to ignite it
[39:56] now you know the way I look
[39:58] this and I think God helped me that even
[40:00] when I don't feel like it that if there
[40:02] is something that is rough that is
[40:05] taking place help me Lord God not to
[40:07] pull back but help me to move right in
[40:09] their shoulder the burden that if it's
[40:11] hard for somebody lifting it like if we
[40:13] were lifting this piano and I see
[40:16] somebody struggling I want to move right
[40:17] into that place and pick that up because
[40:20] I know there is a part within that for
[40:23] me and and I believe that when we look
[40:25] at with Paul and Silas look what
[40:27] happened you see they were able to move
[40:30] beyond their afflictions and to think
[40:32] about the clothing stuck to their back
[40:34] you know how it is when you got a cut on
[40:36] your arm a cut on your knee or a cut and
[40:38] you let fabric dry in there that's not
[40:40] comfortable but to think about it they
[40:43] press beyond the unpleasant and
[40:45] uncomfortable circumstances why did they
[40:49] do that because he was worthy you see
[40:52] that was the testimony he was the song
[40:55] of their life and it invited the Lord
[40:58] the presence of God came on the scene so
[41:02] when you look at it when you come into a
[41:04] song service and I just used as the
[41:06] example the Lord would give me you know
[41:08] you come into it and we come as the
[41:10] Bible says I believe in Acts chapter 2
[41:13] verse 1 it's a phrase that's used in the
[41:16] book of Acts a few times there and it's
[41:18] called
[41:18] one Accord it's not always the same word
[41:21] that's used throughout the New Testament
[41:22] but it's a word that begins with an H or
[41:25] ill you know a million dollar word there
[41:27] Hamas Satan or something like that but
[41:29] what it deals with is hound that there
[41:31] are many notes and yet those notes
[41:33] themselves surrendered and brought
[41:35] together then they they come together in
[41:38] an harmony and you know you're a note
[41:40] I'm a note every one of us and it
[41:42] depends on do we want to withhold our
[41:44] note or let our note blend with the rest
[41:46] of the music and you see that's how it
[41:49] is within a song service of how that we
[41:51] come in and we've got a decision to make
[41:53] are we going to blend in with worship
[41:56] now the devil will always fight you on
[41:58] the way to church he'll fight you
[42:00] throughout the week he'll fight you the
[42:01] devil even when you get here he'll fight
[42:04] you he'll try to get your mind all the
[42:05] things even while the word is going
[42:07] forth he'll try to fight you on it but
[42:10] this is
[42:10] that you have to say no my note belongs
[42:13] to the Lord it's here on this music
[42:15] sheet and I surrender it with the Lord
[42:17] like we said last week you and I we may
[42:19] not know exactly what's going on in the
[42:22] service and we look at it and it seems
[42:24] like my you know maybe my needs not even
[42:26] being addressed and maybe you do not
[42:28] have what would be like a need that
[42:30] you've really put out there but you've
[42:32] come to worship God you've come knowing
[42:34] that the Lord is mindful of your life
[42:36] but it might be a time in our life that
[42:38] we stand here and we say you know what
[42:40] I'm just going to pull on the gift of
[42:42] God because I know that there are needs
[42:45] within this assembly so right now even
[42:48] though that this might not be the strain
[42:50] or the Avenue over exactly where I'm
[42:52] living but still I've been there and I
[42:55] know that God is speaking and there's
[42:57] needs that's here tonight and this whole
[42:59] service is not just about me it is about
[43:02] the body of Jesus Christ the family of
[43:05] job and I'm a part of so I'm gonna lend
[43:07] my note I'm gonna yield myself and allow
[43:10] the Spirit of God to bring the melody
[43:12] from this service and bring victory to
[43:16] the people of God so when you look at
[43:18] this it takes it really takes the work
[43:20] of the Lord you know brother Carlos
[43:22] he'll never override you he'll never
[43:24] ride your brother Adam he'll never come
[43:26] brother bill say give me your note he
[43:28] wants our notes of our lives surrendered
[43:31] to him so God will work and so prepare a
[43:35] service to where that he is ministering
[43:38] not to bring all to us but he will bring
[43:40] it in such a manner to where you and I
[43:43] it's undeniable that God has been in our
[43:45] midst
[43:45] it will require something out of us for
[43:48] you and I to be able to yield and give
[43:51] of our lives
[43:51] but as we yield all we have to do is
[43:54] yield you and I cannot make it happen
[43:56] all we can do is yield but when we yield
[43:59] to him then think of it it is like a
[44:01] channel of faith a faith bank that is
[44:04] building within the building and the
[44:06] Spirit of God is moving to bring
[44:09] deliverance to bring you know to bring
[44:11] all the answers and to what questions or
[44:14] needs that's in our meeting here tonight
[44:16] and I look at this within the thought
[44:20] line and I think of how that God would
[44:23] deal with when we look at the
[44:25] faithfulness of the Lord God is faithful
[44:28] can you say amen to that he is faithful
[44:31] no matter what it is that we are facing
[44:35] or have faith he is faithful and I want
[44:38] to look at this tonight and examine the
[44:40] faithfulness of the Lord in bringing
[44:43] Zion Israel back to her homeland because
[44:47] remember Israel she is a Titan the
[44:51] Israel in the natural is a type of
[44:53] spiritual spirit spiritual Zion that of
[44:56] the bride of Jesus Christ and then you
[44:58] have that of natural Zion natural Israel
[45:01] and I want you to look at this here as
[45:03] we're looking in Exodus you find this
[45:05] was a time not of where that they were a
[45:09] sad but this was a time of victory but I
[45:14] want to remind you of something when
[45:16] they were standing on the shore here in
[45:18] Exodus 15 moments before this they
[45:22] thought their lives were going to be
[45:25] overtaken it they thought they were
[45:27] going to be snuffed out by the armies of
[45:29] the beasts but you see here God used
[45:33] that and aligned all that up it was
[45:35] nothing but an ambush - a lure Pharaoh
[45:39] and his army - a time of defeat and so
[45:42] when you look at it this was a time of
[45:45] rejoicing you know sometimes in our
[45:47] lives there is a song that may not be
[45:49] within maybe a certain tempo it might be
[45:53] a slower song but don't hang on there
[45:55] just have faith in the God because the
[45:58] Lord will turn you're farther along into
[46:01] I'll fly away are you with me now he
[46:05] knows exactly when to change the temple
[46:07] and the time because every song has high
[46:10] notes and low notes yours your life has
[46:14] high notes and low notes
[46:15] you can't play only low notes a piano it
[46:18] has high and low amid all of those work
[46:22] together to bring the beauty of the
[46:24] music and our tests and our trials they
[46:26] work together with the victories with
[46:29] everything in our life to bring forth
[46:31] the glory of Almighty God now I want to
[46:34] look at this tonight here and I want to
[46:36] speak
[46:37] the thought when the Lord sings when the
[46:39] Lord sings you know you got a choice
[46:41] when singing is going on if you're going
[46:43] to enter into that song or not Isaiah 62
[46:47] verse 1 for Zions sake I will not hold
[46:50] my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will
[46:54] not rest until the righteousness thereof
[46:58] go forth has a brightness and the
[47:00] salvation thereof as a lamp that burnin
[47:04] and the Gentiles shall see thy
[47:06] righteousness and all the kings that
[47:09] glory and thou shalt be called by a new
[47:12] name which the mouth of the Lord shall
[47:14] name thou shalt also be a crown of glory
[47:17] in the hand of the Lord and a royal
[47:20] diadem in the hand of God thou shall no
[47:23] more be termed forsaken neither shall
[47:27] that land anymore
[47:28] be turned desolate but thou shalt be
[47:31] called hepzibah and I'll and Beulah for
[47:34] the Lord the lightest in thee and thy
[47:36] land shall be married you see God's
[47:40] desire is that the land would be very
[47:43] not just to have the word but that there
[47:46] would be those who are ordained in that
[47:49] word have their place in the world that
[47:52] we would be Mary for what so that the
[47:55] very richness of the land might yield
[47:59] her strength in manifestation in our
[48:02] lives because remember we're talking not
[48:04] just about Israel but we're talking
[48:06] about our lives as well just so to think
[48:09] about this I want you to notice the
[48:11] words the Lord Himself is bringing this
[48:14] about it's God himself that's bringing
[48:18] it about and he will not rest until his
[48:21] word is fulfilled he's faithful now to
[48:25] think of this the name will be changed
[48:27] to reflect the change in Israel to
[48:30] recognize that even the changing of the
[48:32] name reflects the change even within our
[48:36] lives there is things that God can see
[48:38] even in the depths of our life to where
[48:41] when our name has been changed when we
[48:43] have taken upon his name it's a
[48:46] reflection of what he did
[48:49] and that we are a part of that and part
[48:51] of that family so to see how that even
[48:54] their land will no longer be termed
[48:57] Forsaken and desolate think about this
[48:59] they were out there out of where the
[49:03] promises to think of how Israel was out
[49:05] of where the promises when they were
[49:07] down in Egypt but God had to bring them
[49:10] out of Egypt and get him into the land
[49:12] in order for the Messiah to be made
[49:14] manifest among them he couldn't happen
[49:17] everything itself had to be lined up
[49:19] here it's the same thing for you and I
[49:20] the Prophet asks the question in a third
[49:23] Exodus he said God gave the Holy Ghost
[49:25] as the land for the people to dwell in
[49:28] and why are we out of the land you see
[49:31] God one of the people his desire that
[49:35] there is a people that are married in
[49:37] that land they are united in that word
[49:40] to what their inheritance lays within
[49:43] that land now I want you to think about
[49:45] this here he goes on to saying this in
[49:48] the scripture they shall be called my
[49:51] delight is in her that's what hepzibah
[49:54] that my delight is in her and not land
[49:57] is married you see God is in a time here
[50:00] of singing the elect of Israel gonna be
[50:03] united with the promises of God what's
[50:05] this for as a young man marries a virgin
[50:08] so shall thy sons marry thee and as a
[50:14] bridegroom rejoices over the bride so
[50:17] shall thy God rejoice over V what is he
[50:22] doing he is rejoicing over his work
[50:26] God's rejoicing now over his work we are
[50:30] his workmanship and when Israel has been
[50:34] brought forth there and then to see how
[50:36] God moves within Israel it's God
[50:39] rejoicing over her
[50:42] he said I've sent Watchmen upon thy
[50:45] walls o Jerusalem which shall hold their
[50:48] peace which shall never hold their peace
[50:50] they are not ye that make mention of the
[50:53] Lord keep not silent and give him no
[50:55] rest till he established until he make
[50:57] jerusalem a praise in the earth gallery
[51:02] I don't care who comes against it you
[51:05] cannot over throw it he will not rest
[51:12] many others break Pat's and everything
[51:15] else but remember he will not rest till
[51:19] he established and he make jerusalem a
[51:22] praise in the earth that goes clear into
[51:25] the millennium clear into the future
[51:27] hope he will not rest the elect sons
[51:33] think of this now the scripture said for
[51:36] as a young man marries a virgin
[51:38] so by sons so shall the sons marry thee
[51:41] think of it elect sons coming under the
[51:46] unction of the Holy Ghost I hope you're
[51:50] with me tonight you see for many that
[51:54] don't recognize even what is taking
[51:57] place
[51:57] there's thoughts there's all types of of
[52:00] things even among the Jewish people but
[52:02] to see the unction that is taking place
[52:04] where sons where there are many there's
[52:08] multitudes coming back but remember
[52:10] within the multitudes that are coming
[52:12] back there is an elect 144,000 within
[52:17] that whole bunch you see there there is
[52:19] that friends I'm telling you right now
[52:21] it is a problem throughout the earth
[52:23] where you see that the Jews themselves
[52:24] in one year alone
[52:26] thirty thousand going back to Israel
[52:28] there are all kinds of groups that are
[52:31] helping them and but the help of the
[52:32] Lord I'll get into that here in a little
[52:34] bit according to the scriptural prophecy
[52:36] and you see that the unction there of
[52:38] sons coming back and where the desire is
[52:42] is to come back to the land and God
[52:44] giving them a heart for the land a heart
[52:47] to return there a heart to leave their
[52:49] occupation and where they were grown up
[52:51] and born and to come back home I'm
[52:55] asking you who gave you a ransom to come
[52:58] home
[52:59] who put it in your heart to come home
[53:03] sometimes you look and you see a light
[53:05] word one gone here or gone there but let
[53:08] me tell you something you hold it before
[53:10] the throne of God and listen to me it
[53:12] has to be the Spirit of God sending the
[53:15] Holy Spirit out after him that he would
[53:18] bring an option that they returned back
[53:20] home that some shall marry thee throw
[53:28] repeater God spiritually Israel
[53:31] returning think about this in Zephaniah
[53:34] chapter three verse fourteen saying o
[53:37] daughter of Zion shout o Israel be glad
[53:41] and rejoice with all the heart o
[53:44] daughter of Jerusalem the LORD hath
[53:47] taken away thy judgments he hath cast
[53:49] out dine enemy the king of Israel even
[53:52] the Lord is in the midst of thee thou
[53:56] shalt not see evil anymore your glory
[54:01] better sister not just as this to natura
[54:05] Israel coming but this is the happening
[54:08] of what he himself has done in our life
[54:11] spiritually oh my he had taken away my
[54:15] judgments how he became our judgment he
[54:21] became our perpetuation glory be to God
[54:25] he cast out the enemy he didn't just
[54:29] escort him out remember there was a
[54:31] strong one that had a hold on our life
[54:33] but a stronger one came one stronger
[54:36] than him overtook him and spoil his
[54:40] Goods and threw him out of your life and
[54:43] he moves on the inside and that's why
[54:46] the testimony is greater is He that is
[54:49] in me than he that is in the world you
[54:53] see this is what happens when the Lord
[54:55] sings when he sings his presence falls
[55:00] Oh glory in that day it shall be said to
[55:07] Jerusalem fear thou not into zoos and
[55:10] design let not thy hands be
[55:12] slap the LORD thy God is in the midst of
[55:16] thee is mighty he's mighty the Lord who
[55:22] is in our midst he's mighty he's not
[55:24] puny he's not weak he's mighty the
[55:30] Ministry of Malachi for the ministry
[55:33] itself the prophetic ministry is to make
[55:36] known to you and I he is here for you
[55:40] with me it wasn't that after then God
[55:43] takes the Prophet off the scene listen
[55:45] friends it's not a prophetic ministry as
[55:47] far as what we were looking at in that
[55:50] hole that's got to continue on it's the
[55:52] same Holy Ghost it's the angel of the
[55:54] Lord that you and I had been brought
[55:56] into contact with the same Living God he
[56:00] did not diminish those heard he didn't
[56:07] diminish at all but we recognized him to
[56:10] be mighty he will save he will rejoice
[56:17] over thee with joy he will rest in his
[56:23] love he will joy over thee with singing
[56:29] bringing bringing prophecy together
[56:32] bringing the notes of our lives bringing
[56:35] and bringing it uniting it together it's
[56:38] caught himself in our midst the Lord
[56:41] Himself singing over us he's resting in
[56:46] his love this is how that he ministers
[56:49] to you and I in the rest is that it's
[56:52] not your works
[56:53] it's my rest look at this in verse 18 I
[57:01] will gather them that are sorrowful for
[57:06] the solemn assembly who are of thee to
[57:10] whom the reproach of it was a burden and
[57:14] that wonderful I will gather them now
[57:18] there's multitudes gathering but there
[57:20] are those who are part of those
[57:21] multitudes
[57:23] that he's bringing back there God knows
[57:29] who belongs to him then you're
[57:33] recognized here in Israel flooding back
[57:35] into the land in thousands in droves not
[57:39] to think of it has they're coming back
[57:40] into the land and how that the Spirit of
[57:43] God would be moving within this time I
[57:44] believe it's the Spirit of God with all
[57:46] my heart that is moving them back into
[57:48] the land now remember what the prophet
[57:50] has told us in the message invisible
[57:52] union of the Bride of Christ he said God
[57:54] cannot send a message until the people
[57:57] themselves desire to line up with the
[58:00] world he said and when their people
[58:02] desire to line with the word then God
[58:05] will send a message at that time I
[58:07] believe with all of my heart as the Lord
[58:09] is singing and he's drawing all of this
[58:12] back to Jerusalem just as he has drawn
[58:14] us and drawing every one of his children
[58:17] to him of the bride now I believe with
[58:19] all of my heart that the Spirit of God
[58:21] even as it is moving here among that of
[58:24] Israel there is a gathering that is
[58:27] taking place of the elect within that
[58:29] time I believe that with all my heart
[58:31] now notices here he goes on to say who
[58:33] are of thee to whom the reproach of it
[58:36] was a burden behold at that time I will
[58:40] undo all that afflict thee and I will
[58:46] save her that halted and gather her that
[58:51] was driven out notice I will I will
[58:57] it's God doing the gathering amen
[59:04] God has been the one gathering you know
[59:06] sometimes listen friends we look at
[59:08] things and we you know we should pray we
[59:11] ought to pray but remember it's not you
[59:13] and I that can make things happen if you
[59:16] set it over and over you can't save your
[59:17] children we are responsible to teach
[59:20] them that the presence of God would be
[59:22] manifested before that like Moses
[59:24] himself but people that shield renew the
[59:27] presence of God
[59:28] they knew the statutes the judgments
[59:29] they knew all of that but yet it took a
[59:32] greater one to come
[59:34] on the scene and bring them into the
[59:36] land and you know when we look at it
[59:39] that's what we have to recognize and
[59:40] realize that with each and every one
[59:42] that it takes God moving upon their
[59:45] heart it takes God gathering them if
[59:47] it's not God gathering them then it's
[59:49] just our own efforts but if we can look
[59:52] to the Lord you know what I mean
[59:54] sometimes you see different ones and
[59:55] maybe you ain't seen him for a while and
[59:57] all of a sudden you maybe you'll see
[59:58] them trickle back into church and you
[1:00:00] look at and say Lord is this you Lord
[1:00:03] God to know that friends they wouldn't
[1:00:05] be here unless there was something
[1:00:06] kneeling with their heart and then you
[1:00:08] look at and you say the Lord would you
[1:00:10] just continue Lord to move upon their
[1:00:12] life because you see God himself knows
[1:00:15] how to get a hold and bring his children
[1:00:18] unto himself he knows how to gather his
[1:00:20] children think about this what if your
[1:00:22] children come here and yet they could
[1:00:24] follow all the rules they could follow
[1:00:26] all the doctrine they could follow all
[1:00:28] that and yet they themselves were not
[1:00:30] born again would they be a help to the
[1:00:32] church in one way yes in another way no
[1:00:34] they would actually be a hindrance
[1:00:36] because within it they really do not see
[1:00:39] that they themselves must be lit on fire
[1:00:42] with the Holy Ghost that it's deeper
[1:00:45] than doctrines that it's deeper than
[1:00:47] following this that's deeper than all
[1:00:49] those things everything is necessary
[1:00:51] dress code holiness all those things but
[1:00:53] listen friends you can have all of that
[1:00:55] and without an experience you're lost
[1:00:57] you must have a new birth and experience
[1:01:01] with Almighty God and it takes God
[1:01:03] drawing upon the heart together his
[1:01:05] children unto him Oh glory be to God now
[1:01:10] watch this here that doesn't mean then
[1:01:12] we leave them alone
[1:01:13] it means we still witness we're friendly
[1:01:15] we reach out to him we encourage them we
[1:01:17] pray for right because remember here
[1:01:21] that he has no hands but our hands and
[1:01:24] blood Ram was quick to point out to us
[1:01:27] from the scripture if the salt has lost
[1:01:29] its Savior that how that salt itself
[1:01:32] cannot say unless it is brought in
[1:01:34] contact sometimes come in and contact
[1:01:38] with things that need saving that which
[1:01:40] is around it is very uncomfortable but
[1:01:42] remember it's the salt must be brought
[1:01:45] in contact to bring to savor
[1:01:48] come on somebody oh lord have mercy
[1:01:52] I don't want to fellowship with this I
[1:01:53] don't want to be with this I don't want
[1:01:55] to be polluted how about having
[1:01:56] confidence in the Holy Ghost in your
[1:01:57] life I'm not talking about going out and
[1:02:00] running with sinners and everything else
[1:02:01] but I'm saying it like this right here
[1:02:03] to recognize that it might be the very
[1:02:05] sounding of the shofar of your life that
[1:02:07] will actually get a hole of your
[1:02:09] family's life and to recognize and
[1:02:12] others within the Assembly the very
[1:02:13] presence of God in the mating from your
[1:02:16] life you need to recognize greater is He
[1:02:19] that is in me than he that's in the
[1:02:21] world look to God for his leadership
[1:02:24] don't trying to make it happen look to
[1:02:26] him for his leadership it doesn't matter
[1:02:28] how many have looked at these scriptures
[1:02:29] these prophecies but remember it's no
[1:02:32] man that can make this happen he said I
[1:02:34] will God will use men as instruments but
[1:02:38] he's the one doing the work that I was
[1:02:41] driven out and I will get them look at
[1:02:43] this I will get them praise and fame in
[1:02:47] every land where they have been put to
[1:02:49] shame at that time will I bring you
[1:02:52] again even in the time that I gather you
[1:02:54] for I will make you a name in a praise
[1:02:57] among all the people of the earth when I
[1:02:59] turn back your captivity before your
[1:03:02] eyes saith the Lord God's promise the
[1:03:06] veil is going to be lifted you realize
[1:03:09] there was a greater captivity than their
[1:03:10] captivity out there
[1:03:12] it's the captivity where the veil was
[1:03:14] over their heart because once the veil
[1:03:16] is removed then Liberty sounds right
[1:03:20] that's real true Liberty not just coming
[1:03:23] back to the land but the real true
[1:03:25] Liberty is where the veil is removed
[1:03:27] from their hearts now look at this in
[1:03:29] Zechariah chapter 12 verse 1 the burden
[1:03:33] of the word of the Lord for Israel saith
[1:03:35] the LORD which stretcheth forth the
[1:03:37] heavens and lay at the foundation of the
[1:03:39] earth and form a--the the spirit of man
[1:03:42] within him behold I will make Jerusalem
[1:03:50] a cup of trembling unto all the people
[1:03:54] round about when they shall be in the
[1:03:58] siege both against Judah
[1:04:00] and against Jerusalem who will make I
[1:04:04] will make God is in control and God is
[1:04:12] permitting and has permitted Israel but
[1:04:16] very nation to be a trembling cut to be
[1:04:18] something that you better just trying to
[1:04:20] maybe say the words just right because
[1:04:22] you know they're so interested in this
[1:04:24] peace agreement and this and and
[1:04:26] everything else God has allowed it and
[1:04:29] made it to be that way you find it even
[1:04:34] here in this nation where you have
[1:04:36] people now that have been elected into
[1:04:38] offices speaking out against Israel
[1:04:42] saying very very things that are in
[1:04:45] office very anti-semitic right against
[1:04:47] right against Israel then you have those
[1:04:49] even in the own party that are calling
[1:04:51] them out on it you know and standing
[1:04:53] upon those things you see there's such a
[1:04:55] dividing it's a trembling cup
[1:04:56] everybody's trying to be so politically
[1:04:59] balanced and and what do we do and and
[1:05:01] not tell you what frenzy you know what
[1:05:03] you can take it for how you want it but
[1:05:04] I'll just say like this we know that
[1:05:07] there had to be a certain character and
[1:05:08] caliber of a person we know it had to be
[1:05:11] God to come to a place to where that all
[1:05:14] these things even that embassy moving
[1:05:16] back to Jerusalem it could not have been
[1:05:18] upon a political puppet it could not
[1:05:20] have been somebody who was wishy-washy
[1:05:21] with a jellyfish backbone it could not
[1:05:24] have been somebody like that I'm not
[1:05:25] condoning we don't condone the man the
[1:05:27] character whatever more I'm not
[1:05:29] glorifying that I'm just telling you it
[1:05:31] could not have been anything else see
[1:05:33] the Spirit of God moving behind to bring
[1:05:35] that type of a decision in that time for
[1:05:38] a person who does not care what the rest
[1:05:42] of the world thinks
[1:05:46] Darren tell you some of the wishy-washys
[1:05:49] we've had would never have done that
[1:05:50] he said what brother Samuel it's the
[1:05:52] Spirit of God that's right but remember
[1:05:54] the Spirit of God even in this age keep
[1:05:56] in mind the Prophet said he fits the
[1:05:59] characteristic and makeup of the man out
[1:06:01] that age to catch the people of the age
[1:06:04] you see god himself knows how to so
[1:06:07] arrange those things if it's not for
[1:06:09] anything more other than our president
[1:06:11] that's an office right now
[1:06:13] it was to bring this very part around
[1:06:15] right here let me tell you something
[1:06:17] Cyrus was never a believer Cyrus was
[1:06:20] never known and recognized to be a
[1:06:22] believer but yet he was called my
[1:06:25] shepherd he was called mine anointed as
[1:06:29] a right this is what Cyrus was called it
[1:06:32] was not because that he was a believer
[1:06:35] it's because he would be an instrument a
[1:06:38] tool in the hand of God to recognize his
[1:06:42] commission Oh God if a man like that can
[1:06:45] be moved to recognize his commission
[1:06:48] what about you and I in this hour to
[1:06:51] recognize the commission of the Holy
[1:06:54] Ghost the word that would move upon our
[1:06:56] life hallelujah
[1:07:01] ho ho glory be to God I will make
[1:07:05] Jerusalem a trembling cup and in that
[1:07:09] day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome
[1:07:13] son for all people you know what that
[1:07:18] means the Spirit of Christ in you makes
[1:07:21] you a trembling cup to others it makes
[1:07:26] you burdensome they don't know where to
[1:07:29] place you they don't know how to
[1:07:31] classify you they want to know what
[1:07:33] organization do you belong to and when
[1:07:35] you do not pronounce one of the
[1:07:37] solidarity of names that are united
[1:07:40] together they do not know how to place
[1:07:42] you and then they look at you and they
[1:07:45] listen then they'll come around you and
[1:07:46] they say well don't judgment you said I
[1:07:48] ain't said a word to you you know what
[1:07:50] it is it's the conviction of the Holy
[1:07:53] Ghost by the standard in your life that
[1:07:56] actually brings conviction in their life
[1:07:59] it isn't you as a person but it's a very
[1:08:02] presence of Almighty God
[1:08:05] it's the law
[1:08:06] singing prayers over you it is his
[1:08:10] presence there where the Lord is
[1:08:12] bringing for joy and it brings
[1:08:14] conviction to them they don't even know
[1:08:17] why they hate you and though some of us
[1:08:26] bringing stuff on ourselves I'm saying
[1:08:27] that what is not recognized is because
[1:08:30] of the standard of Christ within our
[1:08:32] lives if we act like smart alecks and we
[1:08:35] get treated bad Wayne's suffering for
[1:08:37] God we're suffering from our own mouths
[1:08:41] come on friends and in that day will I
[1:08:44] make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for
[1:08:46] all people all that burden themselves
[1:08:48] with with it with it shall be cut to
[1:08:51] pieces though all the people of the
[1:08:53] earth be gathered together against us so
[1:08:55] here is speaking even that in a time of
[1:08:57] Armageddon
[1:08:58] now let's brake on over to verse 4 here
[1:09:00] in that day saith the Lord I will smite
[1:09:02] every horse with astonishment that's
[1:09:05] power beasts are power right and his
[1:09:08] rider with madness furious I who will do
[1:09:13] it I will and I will open my eyes upon
[1:09:19] the house of Judah and I will smite
[1:09:23] every horse of the people with blindness
[1:09:28] same God what he did to the student to
[1:09:31] the Syrians they were blind to that of
[1:09:35] Elijah and Elijah let him ride into
[1:09:39] Israel oh I got a preach a minute here
[1:09:43] you see the enemy when he comes upon our
[1:09:46] lives with tests and with trials what he
[1:09:49] doesn't realize it's a blindness he's
[1:09:51] being led right into an ambush
[1:09:54] he's been led right to a place for God
[1:09:57] himself to come on the scene her mother
[1:10:00] and sister are faith don't diminish our
[1:10:03] faith grow stronger our roots grow
[1:10:05] deeper our hearts magnify the Lord glory
[1:10:11] be to God God does that whoa look here
[1:10:17] now and the governors of Judah shall say
[1:10:22] in their heart the inhabitants of
[1:10:26] Jerusalem shall be my strength in the
[1:10:29] Lord of Hosts their God the governors
[1:10:32] the rulers the men who are in power this
[1:10:38] is what they shall say in their heart
[1:10:40] whose whispering to them the Lord the
[1:10:44] melody song is starting to be sung oh
[1:10:48] yeah no what's this here he's putting it
[1:10:51] into their heart think about this the
[1:10:53] Bible says that God had put into the
[1:10:56] heart of those 10 horns those 10 Kings
[1:10:59] he put it into their heart to give their
[1:11:02] Kingdom their kingdoms unto the Beast
[1:11:06] who did it dub did it the same God that
[1:11:09] did that that's the contrast to this
[1:11:12] here were God putting it into the hearts
[1:11:15] of the governors of Judah I'll stay with
[1:11:18] me now here the Lord is placing into the
[1:11:22] hearts to call for a regather enough of
[1:11:26] Israel who puts it in your hearts
[1:11:29] together together
[1:11:32] who's brought us together this is not an
[1:11:35] assembly of man come on somebody this is
[1:11:40] not Satan's synagogue this is an
[1:11:43] assembly that has been called by God
[1:11:45] himself
[1:11:46] making his word alive and real in our
[1:11:50] hearts you and I didn't even know that
[1:11:52] we were a part of this but you see God
[1:11:54] in this hour
[1:11:55] he's singing in that song and as the
[1:11:58] notes of that song you and I are a part
[1:12:01] of that music sheet and it strikes our
[1:12:03] heart and it begins to move in our life
[1:12:06] and then here we find ourselves
[1:12:07] gathering gathering and you know what we
[1:12:12] don't stop General Mills just way we
[1:12:14] don't stop gather we gather Thursday's
[1:12:16] we gather Sunday's we don't even stop
[1:12:19] gathering as a matter of fact even in
[1:12:21] the rapture we're gathering we're all
[1:12:25] getting together amen that comes up
[1:12:28] missing ones here and there what is it
[1:12:31] gathering you see we're part of the
[1:12:33] gathering unto Him glory be to God
[1:12:38] think of this here the burden there now
[1:12:40] I want you to watch this here how can we
[1:12:42] we look at this to think Israel a little
[1:12:46] a little small nation as it is but God
[1:12:49] would put in I just was you know looking
[1:12:50] at some things reading some different
[1:12:52] things the burden to pay for relocation
[1:12:54] and placement in the land by the
[1:12:58] governors of the land it would be like
[1:13:02] different ones that maybe we're away
[1:13:05] from here let's say maybe like sister
[1:13:06] Rita when you were down in Kentucky and
[1:13:08] here you know you're not able to come
[1:13:10] back and we say you know what we will
[1:13:12] send the money we will send the moving
[1:13:14] truck we will send everything all you
[1:13:16] need to do is come you would say thank
[1:13:18] you Lord right to see nothing this isn't
[1:13:23] just one person this is God putting this
[1:13:26] burden in the hearts of the governors to
[1:13:29] pay for them to relocate
[1:13:33] Oh glory be to God you see here this is
[1:13:37] the exact statement here that was taken
[1:13:39] the Jewish the politicians there they
[1:13:42] believe this is their words that the
[1:13:44] Jewish future is only within Jerusalem
[1:13:50] let me tell you something the bright
[1:13:52] future is in Christ the word this is our
[1:13:58] future this is our Jubilee we're not
[1:14:02] politicians but we are delegates of that
[1:14:05] new city and God has put in the hearts
[1:14:08] of the delegates to say let's get
[1:14:11] together let's get together let's get
[1:14:13] together verse 6 in that day will I make
[1:14:22] the governors of Judah look what he'll
[1:14:25] make a mess and heart of fire among the
[1:14:29] wood and like a torch of fire in a
[1:14:33] sheath you know what father is fires
[1:14:37] heat fire catches on revival flowers
[1:14:42] consuming fire sets things on fire you
[1:14:45] can have the wood here and have the fire
[1:14:46] but when you get them together the wood
[1:14:48] is what brings the kindling to the fire
[1:14:51] you see it's God putting it in the
[1:14:53] hearts of the governor see their music
[1:14:56] their notes they're yielding to God in
[1:14:58] the midst of this time think about it
[1:15:00] everything is against them everybody all
[1:15:02] around is against them but yet within
[1:15:04] the midst of it they are moved by the
[1:15:06] unction of the Holy Spirit do you
[1:15:08] realize there's two songs going on
[1:15:10] there's a song right now that God is
[1:15:12] bringing Israel back in we understand
[1:15:15] our song as well but to recognize that
[1:15:17] this whole earth itself is under a
[1:15:20] religious song even right now that is
[1:15:23] even a song that is against like Psalm
[1:15:26] 62 say they want to somehow say that
[1:15:29] they love him but they want to tear him
[1:15:31] down from his majesty you with me they
[1:15:35] want to destroy and take away the
[1:15:37] effects of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:15:40] they they hate him like a torch of
[1:15:42] fairness chief and they shall devour all
[1:15:45] the people round about on the right
[1:15:47] handed on the left and Jerusalem shall
[1:15:49] be inhabited again in her own place even
[1:15:52] in Jerusalem I'll tell you right now we
[1:15:58] know that God put it in the heart of the
[1:15:59] Zionists to come back there and for a
[1:16:02] language that was dead for a language to
[1:16:04] be resurrected for that language to come
[1:16:08] back again of the Jewish language for
[1:16:11] that - God - put it in the hearts of men
[1:16:13] and women to stand back there and say
[1:16:15] this language must come back I say who
[1:16:17] put it in the heart God put it in their
[1:16:19] hearts and here they stood there as
[1:16:21] honest you see it was notes of a song
[1:16:23] that they themselves were a part of they
[1:16:25] many of them they never lived lived he
[1:16:27] even see Israel becoming a nation but
[1:16:30] you see their lives were necessary
[1:16:32] stepping stones that even those that
[1:16:41] returned and when they occur Israel
[1:16:44] could be recognized as a nation there
[1:16:46] were those who in a head and they gave
[1:16:49] their lives by the burden of the Lord in
[1:16:52] their hearts and in those who gave their
[1:16:54] lives were driven back by the tender
[1:16:56] hand of Jehovah their lives given paved
[1:16:59] way for what we're seeing right now how
[1:17:04] about you and I there's been many that's
[1:17:07] paved the way for you and I to enjoy the
[1:17:10] blessing that we enjoyed tonight to
[1:17:13] enjoy the presence of God many that
[1:17:15] labor many that have given their life
[1:17:18] but you and I might enjoy and be able is
[1:17:21] here this melody in this hour
[1:17:23] oma may it be a ring in our hearts God
[1:17:26] let my life be so live to wear that I
[1:17:29] live to see Lord you're coming if not
[1:17:33] Lord let my life be a stepping-stone let
[1:17:36] it be that that will pave the way I say
[1:17:43] this is marvelous this is the Lord's
[1:17:46] doing
[1:17:51] it's a burning of the hearts to return
[1:17:53] back God's using the governors of Judah
[1:17:56] I don't know if I can pronounce this
[1:18:05] word sometimes I forget words but the
[1:18:08] Jewish people who make their how'd you
[1:18:11] say alia Alia their holiday ah means to
[1:18:15] emigrate to come home you see they're
[1:18:24] not just leaving a country there's a
[1:18:28] difference between emigrate and emigrate
[1:18:31] emigrate focuses on the foreign country
[1:18:34] you left emigrate means you're focusing
[1:18:38] on your home you're coming home say that
[1:18:43] say that word again run the rain alia
[1:18:45] this is immigrate to come back home

[1:18:56] us back home
[1:18:57] our alia we've come back home to the
[1:19:00] Lord Jesus Christ
