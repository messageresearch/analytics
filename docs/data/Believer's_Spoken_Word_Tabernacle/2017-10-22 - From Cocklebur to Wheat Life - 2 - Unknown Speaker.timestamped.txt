[39:58] come Laura - it's real solemn moment boy
[40:03] Lord Jesus we have assembled here this
[40:08] morning or because we love you
[40:13] or declaring that side of which we are
[40:17] on God think Lord of how that Moses came
[40:22] down for the mountain that day and he
[40:25] spoke and he said who is on the Lord's
[40:27] Day
[40:28] let him come after me Lord Jesus here we
[40:33] are this is the Sunday morning Lord your
[40:38] God setting Lord here Lord to declare
[40:42] what sign that we're on Father I pray
[40:47] God that you would help us this morning
[40:52] help us Lord that you're got to be able
[40:56] to get out of the way Lord as speaker
[40:58] and hearer together
[41:00] Lord you know you know what we have
[41:03] needed more than many things Lord that
[41:07] would lay before me many things more
[41:11] than throughout the week Lord your God
[41:14] but yet we want to reserve ourselves
[41:18] Lord completely to you so we just ask
[41:22] the Lord that you would come and speak
[41:25] to our hearts and minister to each and
[41:28] every life I pray that God that you
[41:33] would give understanding Lord to our
[41:34] hearts nor things that may be that we
[41:38] have heard the Lord would you make a
[41:41] more real to us we just don't want to
[41:45] agree with the Lord or recognize them
[41:48] Lord in terms of knowledge but God that
[41:52] from within Lord there is an agreement
[41:55] more with the Word of God
[41:57] and we ask the Lord that you would
[42:00] further make your word real than alive
[42:04] in our lives or God may you come and
[42:08] speak to us this morning Lord God Lord
[42:11] remove that the man part Lord step aside
[42:15] that God that you might come and speak
[42:18] your God I pray that you would move
[42:20] among us in a special way Lord God our
[42:23] hearts would be touched and would be
[42:25] stirred Lord in your presence or Oh God
[42:28] that where is the truly declared Lord
[42:31] has through your visitation Lord you're
[42:35] walking up and down the aisles Lord God
[42:37] that all things are possible to them to
[42:40] be granted Lord Jesus this morning Lord
[42:44] Lord we need you Lord God help us Lord
[42:48] we pray now
[42:49] give ourselves to you Lord and asked if
[42:52] we've said or done anything Lord any
[42:54] fault that we would have entertained
[42:55] Lord that would be displeasing to in any
[42:57] way Lord God please forgive us Lord we
[42:59] pray Lord may you have your way Lord in
[43:03] the name of Jesus Christ let's turn to
[43:08] John chapter 3 certainly ask that you
[43:21] would just keep brother Jerry and myself
[43:23] in prayer we certainly covet your
[43:26] prayers Lord willing we'll be leaving
[43:29] out here on on Tuesday Tuesday morning
[43:31] and then there within the meetings that
[43:38] are set forth there and in in the
[43:40] Philippines and we have a it's a pretty
[43:46] solid schedule when we get there and we
[43:49] land we really we start with everything
[43:53] which will be I think more or less it'll
[43:56] be like on Friday evening there which
[44:00] would be Thursday here and so from that
[44:05] time on clear up to the night before we
[44:08] leave or the day before we leave there
[44:10] there are meetings that are set the
[44:12] whole time and some of that itinerary we
[44:15] don't we don't know brother o al has
[44:17] established the whole inchoate in ireri
[44:19] but we have been praying and looking to
[44:22] the Lord and just believing that God is
[44:25] directing all of these things and we
[44:28] certainly just really covered your
[44:29] prayers and that you would just keep us
[44:33] in prayer and well I don't want to say
[44:39] too much because I'll get all choked up
[44:40] but let's just go into the word here
[44:45] John chapter 3 verse 1 there was a man
[44:50] of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler
[44:54] of the Jews that came to Jesus by night
[44:57] and said unto him rabbi we know that
[45:00] thou art a teacher come from God
[45:02] where no man can do these miracles that
[45:05] thou doest except God be with you
[45:08] jesus answered and said unto Him verily
[45:12] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[45:15] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[45:18] God
[45:20] Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be
[45:23] born when he is old can he enter the
[45:26] second time into his mother's womb and
[45:29] be born like we were looking at that
[45:32] last week that very much it shows that
[45:35] the confinement of their earthly
[45:38] thinking - even if a person could enter
[45:43] back in you still would come out with
[45:46] the same birth so this is a much
[45:49] different birth that the Lord Jesus is
[45:52] speaking of not one that has come
[45:55] according how you and I have come in our
[45:58] first birth but it would be a spiritual
[46:01] birth in verse 5 jesus answered verily
[46:05] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[46:09] born of water and of the spirit he
[46:12] cannot enter into the kingdom of God now
[46:17] notice this this is the formula except a
[46:20] man be born of water of the word and of
[46:27] the spirit he cannot enter into the
[46:31] kingdom of God that which is born of the
[46:35] flesh is flesh and that which is born of
[46:38] the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I
[46:42] said unto thee he must be born again the
[46:46] wind bloweth where it listeth and thou
[46:49] hearest the sound thereof that canst not
[46:51] tell whence it cometh and whither it
[46:53] goeth so is every one that is born of
[46:56] the Spirit when you are born of the
[47:00] Spirit of God you are a mystery to the
[47:03] world you become a paradox you are a
[47:08] paradox it's something that you cannot
[47:11] explain but you know
[47:14] has taken place verse 9 Nicodemus
[47:23] answered and said unto him how can these
[47:25] things be jesus answered and said unto
[47:29] Him art thou a master of Israel and
[47:31] knowest not these things verily verily I
[47:34] say unto thee we speak that we do know
[47:36] and testify that we have seen and you
[47:39] receive not our witness may God bless
[47:43] you bless the reading of his word as
[47:44] you've been seated I'd like to continue
[47:49] to take that little fault that we were
[47:51] looking at just move a little further
[47:54] with it from cockle burrow to wheat life
[48:00] and I want to go right back into that
[48:02] quote at least to start from where
[48:05] brother Branham is referring to this
[48:07] many times in the great mystery as we
[48:10] were looking at that a few weeks back of
[48:13] how that it would be natural for us to
[48:17] go according to the pattern of the
[48:21] course of life of the way things had
[48:23] been set throughout many generations
[48:27] before us brother brems said it you know
[48:30] it would be natural he said it would
[48:33] have been hey I would have been a
[48:35] drinker but the blood of Jesus Christ
[48:37] cleanses me from that and the key is I
[48:41] would have been and the thing the thing
[48:45] that makes the difference we know is the
[48:48] blood of Jesus Christ receiving the life
[48:51] that was within that blood cell coming
[48:54] back upon us as the worshipper and
[48:57] raising us up out of those natural genes
[49:01] where they no longer have the
[49:04] predominant part in our life but we have
[49:06] been delivered and then being delivered
[49:09] we are translated into the into that
[49:12] kingdom of his dear son it's really
[49:15] quiet a great a great thing that as
[49:17] we've just started to move into this a
[49:19] little bit of how that you find that
[49:22] even sickness itself and things can
[49:24] travel down through generations and
[49:26] certain things that
[49:28] we'll move within the genes and yet
[49:30] there are things that spiritually as
[49:33] well that can be handed down from one
[49:35] generation can pass from this generation
[49:38] to that generation how many times that
[49:40] the Prophet said that when he would
[49:42] stand there and he said dealing with a
[49:44] stubborn spirit he would trace that
[49:46] thing on back down through generations
[49:48] so it's something that where a person
[49:51] was actually given to that and then that
[49:54] spirit itself would would work in a
[49:56] manner to where he would actually be
[49:58] handed down didn't you say well how
[49:59] could that be handed down because there
[50:01] are things that were a spirit a spirit
[50:03] itself cannot work unless there is
[50:05] impressionable parts or things to be
[50:07] shown so then you find of how that those
[50:10] spirits some they would work in a manner
[50:12] that then impressions and those things
[50:14] would go forth much like teaching you
[50:16] understand it's teaching that would go
[50:19] on but yet teaching that wasn't where as
[50:21] far as someone's standing before you are
[50:23] I on saying now listen this is how we do
[50:24] this and how we do that but the most and
[50:26] the majority of our teaching is all the
[50:28] image that is placed before us it's not
[50:31] so much even words if we do things this
[50:33] way but it's just how we do it and
[50:35] that's where that we truly need the
[50:38] grace of God within our life we need the
[50:41] new birth and then by the new birth
[50:43] receiving the strength of God that our
[50:45] minds can actually be renewed by the
[50:49] Holy Spirit so that it's no longer the
[50:52] predominant part of our ways were no
[50:54] longer so much known by our family
[50:57] earthly name but we become known by the
[50:59] another name by the family name which is
[51:02] from heaven so this is this is the very
[51:05] working of God and certainly that
[51:08] there's no way that you and I can do
[51:10] this without the Lord and when we look
[51:13] at this this statement the brother
[51:15] Branham makes here in questions and
[51:16] answers part four he says how can I take
[51:18] a cockle burrow and make a grain of
[51:21] wheat out of it it's impossible for me
[51:25] to do it the only way it can be is
[51:27] because inside that cockerel has been
[51:30] transmitted from a cockle burrow to a
[51:33] germ called wheat life so there's come
[51:37] about a change on the inside of the
[51:40] kokuboro
[51:41] he says now then you bury that Kaka
[51:43] burrow and it'll produce a grain of
[51:45] wheat because there has been a life of
[51:47] wheat put in the cocklebur now when we
[51:50] most the time when we look at a seed and
[51:52] probably some of you that are farmers
[51:55] and different things like that
[51:57] you know gardeners and things you can
[51:58] look at certain seeds especially if you
[52:00] order seeds you know out of the
[52:02] catalogue and things like that I guess
[52:03] they still have the catalog but you know
[52:06] my dad he would order the different
[52:07] seeds they would come in brown bags they
[52:09] would have him wrapped down and stapled
[52:11] up and he would have the certain sweet
[52:12] corn he always wanted and this certain
[52:14] thing that he want a certain melons and
[52:16] he would he would take those seeds now
[52:18] in those seeds they each and every one
[52:20] we all we know there were seeds but
[52:22] there were by looking at the seed on the
[52:24] outside he could look at it and say well
[52:26] this is this part of sweet corn its
[52:28] identified with this one and he could
[52:30] look at this seed and say well this is
[52:31] squash and he could look at this one say
[52:33] well this one is melon and you know when
[52:35] you're looking at the outside of the
[52:37] seed we would look at it in a manner and
[52:39] we you and I would identify seeds in
[52:42] that manner and when we loo when you
[52:44] think of it as far as within the scope
[52:46] of all of our lives on the outside its
[52:49] all cocklebur oh it would be natural and
[52:52] normal for you to look at your life and
[52:54] to recognize had it not been for the
[52:56] grace of God you would bear cocklebur a
[52:59] life but because there is another life
[53:02] on the inside that has been planted
[53:04] there by God and God has moved to raise
[53:07] up that life removing the other one and
[53:10] raising that life that he has sown
[53:12] within us then um the outside we look
[53:15] the same as far as the same old temple
[53:18] but on the inside there is a new life
[53:20] that has started and that new life that
[53:23] is started there is a developing there
[53:25] is a forming into the word image as that
[53:27] life itself has begun within us through
[53:30] the quickening through the birth and it
[53:32] continues to develop until eventually
[53:34] from out of this earth it reaches its
[53:37] peak of maturity and there comes a
[53:39] rapture or as the prophet uses the term
[53:41] in future home a trance planning and you
[53:45] know what a trance planning is it's
[53:46] where that if something has reached to a
[53:48] certain place in that pot it can no
[53:51] longer grow or further flourish and so
[53:53] there has to be
[53:54] removing from that place a transplanting
[53:57] into another place so God himself by the
[54:00] rapture is harvesting his own crop
[54:04] it's his crop that he's sown it's his
[54:06] crop that he is watered
[54:08] it's his crop that he is nurtured and
[54:10] it's his crop that he takes home with
[54:13] him so he's here to care and nurture
[54:16] that crop all along so when we're
[54:18] looking at this a great paradox within
[54:20] it of how that the grace of God would
[54:23] move down in our life and raise up that
[54:26] that that wheat life that was sown there
[54:29] within us and how the Prophet says the
[54:31] life of the kokuboro has been taken out
[54:34] but the nature of the kokuboro
[54:37] is still sticky and it will be until
[54:40] this new life has fully been developed
[54:43] out of the ground and raised up again
[54:46] anybody ever get tired of yourself
[54:49] that's a wonderful sign you get tired of
[54:54] certain things you think my goodness and
[54:55] you know you find things you think my
[54:58] goodness you know Here I am you know and
[55:00] you find you so many be getting
[55:01] frustrated here frustrated there that's
[55:03] not an excuse but remember perfection
[55:05] maturity is not when this thing becomes
[55:08] perfect oh I no longer make the same
[55:10] mistakes I know that's not in perfection
[55:12] and maturity but perfection and maturity
[55:14] is recognizing that opposing force as
[55:17] it's entering in see sometimes we get so
[55:20] caught up in the failure and in the
[55:22] mistake that we fail to recognize the
[55:24] advancement or the approach of the enemy
[55:27] and that's what real perfection and
[55:29] maturity it brings us to recognize of
[55:32] how God of how that the enemy would want
[55:34] to move in a bonus but perfection and
[55:37] maturity is not letting that thing
[55:39] continue that's where the Prophet said
[55:43] what is overcoming is to recognize the
[55:45] devil at every one of his trips and you
[55:49] know what he knows each and every one of
[55:51] us but there's one who knew us before he
[55:55] knew us that's the one that we have to
[55:58] pay attention to that's the one that we
[56:00] have to look to is that all right it's
[56:04] like this let me just drop this with you
[56:06] here and I'll move on it's it's
[56:08] select when you have when in the very
[56:10] beginning in the Garden of Eden you have
[56:12] where you know Eve here we know the fall
[56:16] has come about and here when she
[56:19] receives King comes forth she says I
[56:22] have gotten a man from the Lord she
[56:26] never says that about Abel let me put it
[56:30] this way if we're looking at the shelves
[56:33] in the house and we're looking at
[56:36] pictures the firstborn usually gets a
[56:38] lot of pictures so on this shelf it was
[56:42] Cain Cain Cain Abel King King King King
[56:44] King Abel King if you looked at King you
[56:47] would see Cain if you look real close to
[56:48] the pictures were in such a place it was
[56:50] like movement on the shelf there's not
[56:55] been a lot said in our life about Abel
[57:00] but it takes one who knows able to come
[57:04] and reveal Abel it's one who knows who
[57:07] you really are to really reveal to you
[57:10] not him who you really are because the
[57:14] picture you've looked at a lot of times
[57:16] and you stare at and you get down on is
[57:18] the Cain part but remember that man he
[57:22] came by a law of God but the one who
[57:26] come and really is of the Lord is Abel
[57:29] and that's the real picture that we have
[57:33] to look at that's the one that we have
[57:35] to stop looking and looking so much at
[57:37] all of those Cain pictures and look at
[57:40] that Abel picture right because Abel is
[57:44] Abel Abel is able to live an overcoming
[57:47] life when Abel is brought forth he's
[57:51] able to live an overcoming life so when
[57:57] we're looking at this front of the new
[58:00] birth which here is the Lord Jesus the
[58:02] very first doctrine that he preaches it
[58:05] must be born again this is this is the
[58:08] whole coming of the Messiah is to bring
[58:11] Redemption now in the midst of bringing
[58:13] Redemption we know that God comes down
[58:16] and he walks here in a body that is made
[58:19] in the likeness of sinful flesh
[58:22] Terrence's all of the tests and the
[58:24] temptations that you and I will go
[58:27] through he's doing that because remember
[58:30] the the the very promise is that he
[58:33] would take a priest there would be one
[58:35] that is taken from among the Brethren so
[58:38] he had to become one of us
[58:41] then how's he standing here and
[58:44] ministering to you and I of that you
[58:47] must be born again he's calling the
[58:50] attention that this is the hour see any
[58:53] even though types had been given down
[58:55] through the scripture it was not the
[58:57] hour to begin to call people to the new
[58:59] birth the word would come and you would
[59:02] find Israel being called back to
[59:04] something and then they would recede and
[59:06] fall away then they would be called back
[59:08] to it but then they would recede and
[59:10] fall away but this was a different hour
[59:12] this was not just a calling you know by
[59:16] the inspiration of the word that was
[59:18] pointing to that of redemption but here
[59:20] it was this was the hour that was
[59:22] pointing to that it was a time that man
[59:25] could actually come into a place and be
[59:28] born again what a privilege what an
[59:33] announcement that is going forth this is
[59:35] the Lord Jesus himself preaching the
[59:38] precursor of the acceptable year he's
[59:42] letting it be known that the feast
[59:43] itself these things that have been in
[59:46] type aren't ready to be set in motion
[59:49] and be fulfilled
[59:54] notice when we're looking at this who
[59:57] can be when you think of this who can be
[1:00:00] reborn because this subject of being
[1:00:03] born again in new birth it's a subject
[1:00:06] that has been spoke on down through time
[1:00:09] it's a subject that this is the heart of
[1:00:13] what Satan has been after throughout the
[1:00:16] church ages this is the very thing -
[1:00:19] that's where that that Satan began what
[1:00:22] he produced a sterile priesthood a group
[1:00:26] of individuals that with all that was
[1:00:28] was deeds and doctrine but they were
[1:00:30] denying the very visitation
[1:00:34] the Lord Jesus Christ and not just
[1:00:35] something back there on Calvary they
[1:00:37] were and they were denying his presence
[1:00:40] now coming in fulfilling that of the
[1:00:43] Messiah and the Holy Spirit being given
[1:00:45] out that is Satan's objective is to take
[1:00:49] that away and produce a sterile
[1:00:52] priesthood a sterile people what is it
[1:00:55] back without power and authority but
[1:01:02] this unfolding of the plan I want to
[1:01:04] just look at that who can be reborn
[1:01:06] because when you see it it would you
[1:01:09] know the word when the word is preached
[1:01:11] it's the word is preached as though it's
[1:01:14] to everybody is that right it must be
[1:01:17] that way God God is not you know going
[1:01:20] down and and then just you know in some
[1:01:23] ways saying well I'm not gonna minister
[1:01:24] to this and Minister Betty he declares
[1:01:26] his word is his deliverance to everybody
[1:01:30] it's just like that in the time of
[1:01:32] Israel when there was a Jubilee the
[1:01:34] priest would ride through the land and
[1:01:36] sound the trumpet he was denoting that
[1:01:39] this was a time that you were in slavery
[1:01:42] can go free the choice became the
[1:01:46] individual who was in slavery whether
[1:01:49] they wanted to go free because that
[1:01:54] trumpet would let them know there's so
[1:01:57] much that sounded in that trumpet that
[1:02:00] didn't let them know you can throw down
[1:02:02] you can stop immediately what you're
[1:02:05] doing you don't have to all of a sudden
[1:02:08] come into a place and I'm no longer
[1:02:10] gonna do this I'm no longer gonna do
[1:02:12] that but you can by the authority of
[1:02:14] that sounding throw down that which you
[1:02:18] were doing you can cast it down Wow by
[1:02:21] the authority of the word that is
[1:02:23] sounding out it's not something that
[1:02:25] anybody else that that could be done to
[1:02:28] release them back into their inheritance
[1:02:30] it was a solemn act of Almighty God
[1:02:33] there was an appointed time when there
[1:02:36] would come a sounding and when that
[1:02:39] sounding came they had authority to go
[1:02:41] back to their inheritance you see they
[1:02:43] were going
[1:02:44] to something that was always there's
[1:02:49] this life this eternal life it always
[1:02:53] was yours hey man you didn't earn an
[1:02:59] inheritance unit gaining inheritance you
[1:03:02] always had an inheritance but there's
[1:03:06] got to be somebody come on the scene
[1:03:08] that can bring you to your inheritance
[1:03:13] this is the coming of the Messiah this
[1:03:17] is the coming of the Lord Jesus this is
[1:03:19] what the new birth is all about is to
[1:03:21] bring you back to your inheritance
[1:03:25] hallelujah so to look at these things if
[1:03:28] these are things that the enemy has
[1:03:31] wanted to tear down then you see
[1:03:35] traditions themselves God can allow
[1:03:38] traditions to go for a period of time
[1:03:41] you understand what I'm saying they can
[1:03:44] let it go in a manner to where that the
[1:03:46] new birth listen to me now carefully
[1:03:48] that the new birth is a matter of
[1:03:49] perseverance the new birth is not a
[1:03:52] matter of perseverance you're putting it
[1:03:54] you cannot put the new birth based on
[1:03:57] human strength it is not something that
[1:04:00] you and I can't attain to on our own it
[1:04:03] is God solemnly it's not a church it's
[1:04:07] not a prophet it's God solemnly the
[1:04:10] scripture says by one spirit we are
[1:04:13] baptized into one body it's not our
[1:04:17] strength
[1:04:17] it's our yielding these things when the
[1:04:27] Spirit of God coming in this hour
[1:04:29] how much those of you that know as
[1:04:32] you've been listening to the message you
[1:04:34] find how it homes so definitively as the
[1:04:39] message goes in right an election the
[1:04:42] prophet doesn't pull back from that it
[1:04:44] homes further in he homes it in tighter
[1:04:47] and tighter and tighter moving moving
[1:04:50] getting it right you say well yeah I
[1:04:51] understand I was elected but you see
[1:04:53] friends sometimes there's fragments of
[1:04:55] traditions back
[1:04:57] come with these things and it's not
[1:04:59] something that the prophet brought it's
[1:05:01] things that sometimes traditions that's
[1:05:03] back there that them fragments want to
[1:05:05] come on over and we're still looking at
[1:05:07] election through the fragments of
[1:05:09] tradition we're looking at election as
[1:05:12] though God look down and God said oh my
[1:05:14] Sandra's gonna make a choice to serve me
[1:05:16] I'm predestinate him that's not three
[1:05:18] destination come on somebody they meant
[1:05:22] that's called arminianism that's called
[1:05:26] me having something to do with it and
[1:05:28] because I did this God said I see him
[1:05:31] and I'm going to give him eternal life
[1:05:33] that's not election good fault did God
[1:05:37] see my choice yes but what is my choice
[1:05:39] that choice that he already made so it's
[1:05:43] not my perseverance as far as who I'm
[1:05:46] really going to attain this I'm gonna
[1:05:47] sure when the word of promise comes
[1:05:49] across our pathway it stirs something in
[1:05:53] us it causes something to rise in our
[1:05:56] hearts that even we can't explain I
[1:05:59] don't care if you sent around the
[1:06:01] message for years when God begins to
[1:06:03] deal with your heart it stirs something
[1:06:05] up within you that you cannot even
[1:06:07] explain as a matter of fact the Prophet
[1:06:09] put it this clearly in the Easter Show
[1:06:11] he said it's contrary to your own nature
[1:06:15] contrary to us what part of us the
[1:06:18] cocklebur part this is the power of God
[1:06:22] at work it's a sovereignty of God at
[1:06:25] work so when we're looking at this of
[1:06:28] the new birth this is God Himself making
[1:06:31] a way for himself to come and and bring
[1:06:35] to you and I that life hallelujah you
[1:06:39] know my mother and father came together
[1:06:41] and here here you and I came and here we
[1:06:45] are born of that woman tree right
[1:06:49] the woman tree that received the
[1:06:52] knowledge from the tree of good and evil
[1:06:54] and it produced and here we come back a
[1:06:57] sexual birth what the woman tree all
[1:07:00] that does as the Prophet tells us and
[1:07:02] then the book of Job the man that is
[1:07:05] born of a woman is a few days old and a
[1:07:09] all the trouble but there's got to come
[1:07:12] another birth and if there's gonna come
[1:07:15] another birth there's gotta be one who's
[1:07:18] able to lead me into that birth and
[1:07:21] deliver me my momma so this this is an
[1:07:33] unfolding of the plan of redemption this
[1:07:36] is God unfolding this plan this is not
[1:07:39] something that we realize that just
[1:07:40] started here within time but it's back
[1:07:44] way before the eternities in the mind of
[1:07:47] God before Adam Stardust or molecule
[1:07:50] this plan of redemption was already set
[1:07:52] forth in the mind of God revelation 13:8
[1:07:56] said that the lamb was slain from the
[1:07:58] foundation of the world in the mind of
[1:08:01] God Joe picks it up and said that the
[1:08:03] morning stars shouted for joy who wasn't
[1:08:07] in rejoicing in our salvation mom I hear
[1:08:12] God must unfold that it's not it's not
[1:08:15] enough just for that to be known but God
[1:08:18] must unfold that plan of redemption and
[1:08:21] the only way that he can do it is laid
[1:08:23] everything in pipes and shadows but he
[1:08:25] himself who who alone is able to bring
[1:08:29] us into this place he must become one of
[1:08:33] us now what you just to look at this
[1:08:37] here just a moment in the message in the
[1:08:42] submerging church age the Prophet said
[1:08:44] in very plain language the true Bride of
[1:08:47] Christ was in the mind of God eternally
[1:08:50] though not expressed until each came
[1:08:53] forth in the designated decreed season
[1:08:56] as each member came forth it became
[1:08:59] expressed and took its place in the body
[1:09:02] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[1:09:06] word see Bride amen
[1:09:10] and those she is feminine in designation
[1:09:13] she is also called the body of Christ it
[1:09:16] is very apparent that she
[1:09:18] to be called that for she was
[1:09:21] predestinated in him came from the same
[1:09:24] source was eternal with him and he is
[1:09:27] now manifesting God in a mini membered
[1:09:31] body whereas once God was manifested in
[1:09:34] one member even our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:38] so here the bride the spoken word she
[1:09:41] brought so there is laid out very clear
[1:09:44] that the bride itself is is that part of
[1:09:48] the word and when the word itself is
[1:09:51] declared for that season here we come
[1:09:53] into this life
[1:09:55] here we are born into this life but and
[1:09:59] here we are coming into an expression
[1:10:02] but there must come the word across
[1:10:05] there wait there's only one thing that
[1:10:07] can release you and I and that's the
[1:10:09] word that's the person of Christ himself
[1:10:13] and when he comes by your way remember
[1:10:15] it's not just a word it must be the
[1:10:19] Living Word it must be the living image
[1:10:22] not just a sermon about Eagles it's
[1:10:25] gotta be the eagle that passes over
[1:10:28] because we're not just talking about an
[1:10:31] image that leaves it up in your mind but
[1:10:33] it must be a living image that flies
[1:10:36] over your life now he says notice here
[1:10:46] we are coming to a conclusion has the
[1:10:49] eternal logos God was manifest in the
[1:10:53] son and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness
[1:10:56] of the Godhead bodily
[1:10:57] and that eternal one was the father
[1:11:01] manifest in flesh and thereby gained the
[1:11:04] title of son God manifested in flesh not
[1:11:10] to separate people but God created a
[1:11:13] body for himself to come and dwell in it
[1:11:16] remember we were looking as that God
[1:11:19] created a body and God stepped down at
[1:11:23] the River Jordan and he redeemed or
[1:11:27] claimed back what he
[1:11:30] had created what is that he's unfolding
[1:11:34] of the very pattern of what it is for
[1:11:37] every Alexa and daughter of God it's God
[1:11:42] coming down and claiming what belongs to
[1:11:45] him but he had to create a body he
[1:11:49] couldn't just come and just claim you
[1:11:51] and I as we were but he had to come and
[1:11:55] there had to be a shedding of the blood
[1:11:57] that that life could move in upon us
[1:12:03] it's him he moves all of that in this
[1:12:08] the Father manifested that gained the
[1:12:11] title of son become a son of man
[1:12:16] remember that confused him then they
[1:12:19] couldn't understand that they called him
[1:12:21] Beelzebub they cast everything up they
[1:12:23] didn't understand that the visitation
[1:12:26] the revealing of the son of man this was
[1:12:28] not just another inspiration pointing to
[1:12:31] Redemption to come Redemption has come
[1:12:37] that's why in this age it's not a
[1:12:39] portion of the Holy Ghost the entire
[1:12:42] Holy Ghost visits the church what is it
[1:12:47] it's the revealing of the son of man
[1:12:49] Christ behind your flesh God
[1:12:53] demonstrated God showed to you and I I'm
[1:12:55] still the same God he raised up out of
[1:12:58] all of when the church he just he raised
[1:13:01] up and he made himself known that he is
[1:13:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:07] not just a sign that he came with a word
[1:13:09] because listen friends the sign alone
[1:13:12] gets our attention what to come right
[1:13:14] back to the word what did Jesus do on
[1:13:17] the road to Emmaus he didn't come and
[1:13:20] try to persuade them that I'm him look
[1:13:22] at me look at this look at that but he
[1:13:24] took them into the word why he wanted
[1:13:28] them to recognize him by the word
[1:13:30] because that's how his children will
[1:13:34] recognize him his by the word
[1:13:37] not by our intellect of the word but
[1:13:41] it's when that word it's calling out to
[1:13:43] you and I and it is speaking to the
[1:13:45] depths of our life and we see that and
[1:13:47] say yes that's who I am
[1:13:56] remember the Spirit of God moved an
[1:13:59] inspiration upon the prophets they would
[1:14:01] speak in divine utterance and it would
[1:14:03] pull back but on this one this was
[1:14:09] different
[1:14:10] John well you see the Spirit descend and
[1:14:15] remain this is different now this is not
[1:14:20] moving in and pulling back moving in and
[1:14:22] pulling back but remaining upon this
[1:14:24] said the same is he that baptizes with
[1:14:28] the Holy Ghost Redemption has come this
[1:14:33] is not just speaking of Redemption but
[1:14:36] now here is he standing here with the
[1:14:38] Redeemer anointing upon his life amen
[1:14:43] the Messiah standing here upon earth my
[1:14:46] my even so we look at this now he's
[1:14:51] bringing it down to us even so we
[1:14:54] eternal in his thoughts in our turn it's
[1:15:00] like a play became the many membered
[1:15:04] spoken word seed manifest in flesh and
[1:15:07] those eternal thoughts now manifest in
[1:15:10] flesh are the sons of God even as we are
[1:15:13] so called now watch this we did not
[1:15:17] become seed by the rebirth no sir you
[1:15:25] did not become a son of God by being
[1:15:27] reborn see you did you say no Samuel
[1:15:31] that's an understandable point but what
[1:15:33] I'm trying to tell you this is that
[1:15:34] there are things that we don't want
[1:15:37] traditions hanging on it as though that
[1:15:39] sometimes who in my life you know one
[1:15:41] day in my life when all of a sudden I
[1:15:43] read you know the scriptures and I
[1:15:45] started praying God put a seed in my
[1:15:47] heart that is Error
[1:15:49] when you were born as you entered into
[1:15:53] this world that was a seed placed in you
[1:15:56] right then not something that you desire
[1:16:01] not something I wanted or you on it that
[1:16:04] seed was in us the whole time any other
[1:16:14] way it puts us got something to do with
[1:16:17] it well you know I read a book one day I
[1:16:19] heard a message one day and all of a
[1:16:21] sudden it's a seed of God came in me
[1:16:23] that's error always was seed now let me
[1:16:28] just let's develop this here we did not
[1:16:30] become seed by the rebirth we were seed
[1:16:34] and therefore were reborn for only the
[1:16:38] elect can be reborn a lot of things are
[1:16:44] spoken about the new birth but only the
[1:16:47] elect can be reborn now you might have
[1:16:50] been a part of a church and here you
[1:16:52] were out in other places and they told
[1:16:54] you just put your name on the book they
[1:16:56] told you that well as long as you
[1:16:58] believe as long as you believe that's
[1:16:59] all you've got to do is you just have to
[1:17:01] believe that is a partial truth but
[1:17:03] believing itself you must believe unto
[1:17:06] salvation unto the very fullness and
[1:17:10] quickening in your life so there's got
[1:17:13] to be listen it's got to me--one
[1:17:15] prescient that is the word himself
[1:17:17] that's able to lead you and I to life
[1:17:21] are you with me
[1:17:22] it takes more than a church to do that
[1:17:25] friends it's got to be the person of
[1:17:27] life himself and if God is not there to
[1:17:32] inspire that word God is not opening
[1:17:35] that word then there is no life as far
[1:17:38] as in terms of new birth I don't know
[1:17:40] about you but I just do not want emotion
[1:17:42] he motion will not last frenzied motion
[1:17:45] is fine it's wonderful I believe that
[1:17:48] you can be emotional but we just don't
[1:17:50] want where the Spirit of God moves in
[1:17:52] upon us and then after we leave out of
[1:17:54] here it pulls right back no the Spirit
[1:17:57] of God when it moves and upon your life
[1:17:59] it remains in quickens that see you may
[1:18:02] not feel it tomorrow you may not feel it
[1:18:04] the next day you may not feel like a
[1:18:06] Christian the next day but when that
[1:18:08] seed has been quickened you are sealed
[1:18:11] to your eternal destination it's not
[1:18:14] based on your clock of all feelings it's
[1:18:18] based on wheat life being raised up the
[1:18:23] Bible said the kingdom of God cometh
[1:18:25] without observation sometimes people are
[1:18:30] so interested in having a I know the
[1:18:32] date the time the place so many times
[1:18:33] people are so interested in that that
[1:18:35] they forget what is the true sign the
[1:18:39] true sign is what the spirit of truth
[1:18:41] when he has come he will lead and guide
[1:18:44] you into all truth it will be fruit that
[1:18:48] will be born out of your life that is
[1:18:51] the sign of the indwelling of God's
[1:18:53] Spirit it's wonderful if you know a
[1:18:56] place in a time in whatever more that's
[1:18:58] wonderful but friends listen all of
[1:19:00] those things that takes God to bring the
[1:19:03] divine establishment in our life to
[1:19:05] where that we recognize hey I'm not a
[1:19:07] talker burl I am a wheat plant mama
[1:19:16] where only the elect can be reborn
[1:19:19] because we were seed is the reason we
[1:19:23] could be quickening in non seed there is
[1:19:26] nothing to quicken true the Spirit of
[1:19:29] God can move upon can they call and say
[1:19:32] Lord I want to be safe sure but it
[1:19:34] doesn't there's nothing within to
[1:19:37] quicken quicken to what quickened to him
[1:19:39] quickened to become the expression of
[1:19:43] the word that's always been in their
[1:19:45] life but thank God that they can be
[1:19:48] saved but we're talking about being born
[1:19:52] again right in order to be born a father
[1:19:56] and mother there has to be to come
[1:19:59] together right so in order to have the
[1:20:02] new birth there must be a seed there on
[1:20:04] the inside that's able to receive seed
[1:20:07] life from the male that's able to
[1:20:10] receive that and
[1:20:11] getting to what express that image is
[1:20:16] that what the Lord Jesus spoke and
[1:20:17] taught us even in the book of Peter
[1:20:19] being born again of what of the
[1:20:21] incorruptible Word of God you know I
[1:20:30] went out here along the church on this
[1:20:33] side and I took a water and pill out
[1:20:35] here and I was out there just to water
[1:20:37] along on the on the ground I said buy
[1:20:39] more water these I'm gonna water these
[1:20:41] tomato plants hum little water you start
[1:20:44] looking too mean you think I know he's
[1:20:46] lost it for sure now I always thought
[1:20:49] there were problems with that guy but I
[1:20:50] know for sure you mind let me go on for
[1:20:53] a little bit and you thought well maybe
[1:20:55] maybe he planted us to me the plant
[1:20:56] there I don't know maybe just you know
[1:20:58] trying to make use of all the ground
[1:20:59] forests and things like that and I know
[1:21:01] he likes also maybe he just want a lot
[1:21:03] more tomatoes and things you know so I
[1:21:04] keep going I keep water in that same
[1:21:07] place after a while you start looking at
[1:21:09] how do you think he's been watering that
[1:21:11] an awful lot the first thing you asked
[1:21:14] me is did you plant any seed Dave did
[1:21:16] you plant something here oh no I didn't
[1:21:18] plant nothing there but I'm water a
[1:21:20] tomato plant you how in the world
[1:21:22] brother Sam no how can you ever bring
[1:21:24] forth tomatoes if you didn't plant
[1:21:26] anything let me say this to you the
[1:21:28] planting of God is not something present
[1:21:31] tense but the planting of God was before
[1:21:34] the foundation of the world in psalms
[1:21:37] chapter 1 blessed is that man what is he
[1:21:40] planted not will be not shall be but he
[1:21:43] is planted planted in what the promise
[1:21:49] of the word for the hour so there must
[1:21:55] be seed that's there to water in a
[1:21:57] notices hold this carefully in mind now
[1:22:00] take the next step redeem means to buy
[1:22:04] back it restores to the original owner
[1:22:09] God by his death and remember as a
[1:22:13] spirit he could not die but he had to be
[1:22:17] come from spirit to become a man
[1:22:22] so God created a body to step into a
[1:22:29] body purposed for death a body that he
[1:22:33] might express himself in God came down
[1:22:36] and become one of us
[1:22:38] friends don't ever let that become
[1:22:39] common to you because because without
[1:22:43] that we haven't we have no benefits but
[1:22:46] because that he had become one of us
[1:22:49] then you and I can enjoy the life that
[1:22:52] we have received from his offering up
[1:22:54] and by his resurrection and sending back
[1:22:57] that life you and I are being made and
[1:22:59] have been made partakers of the divine
[1:23:01] nature of God but his death the shed
[1:23:08] blood bought back his own he bought back
[1:23:13] the spoken-word seed bride remember how
[1:23:18] it was in the Old Testament they would
[1:23:20] have won that if the if the field or
[1:23:24] something the inheritance had been taken
[1:23:27] is there one that would have that would
[1:23:29] be a kin that would have the necessary
[1:23:32] means to purchase this right no man that
[1:23:39] none of us had the necessary means to
[1:23:41] purchase back what to get back through
[1:23:43] that tree of life God had it in that way
[1:23:47] that was everything most totally was set
[1:23:50] forth by God what that it gave him a
[1:23:52] reason and a purpose of being my God by
[1:23:58] his death the shed blood bought back his
[1:24:00] own he bought back the spoken-word see
[1:24:03] bride
[1:24:03] my sheep hear my voice the word and they
[1:24:07] follow me you always were a sheep you
[1:24:15] never wore a pig or a dog turned into a
[1:24:18] sheep we might have lived in that way
[1:24:26] but down beneath we were she
[1:24:30] Oh Oh when we entered into this with
[1:24:35] this earth we were always sheep we want
[1:24:39] to live like pigs and dogs but we were
[1:24:41] sheep but remember just looking on the
[1:24:47] outside of that seat as we said moments
[1:24:49] ago you could look at that seat and said
[1:24:51] no that's a sweet corn no that's a
[1:24:53] cockerel bro but there's a mystery
[1:24:55] inside of that sheep from the outside it
[1:25:00] might look like a pig in looks like this
[1:25:02] it looks like that but there is a
[1:25:03] mystery on the inside what is that
[1:25:06] mystery it is a sheep well if it's a
[1:25:11] sheep it means a shepherd and it's got
[1:25:16] to have a shepherd that knows who it is
[1:25:19] it's got to have a shepherd that's able
[1:25:22] to bring it out is that right that is
[1:25:27] impossible for every kind notice then
[1:25:30] what's impossible you never were a pig
[1:25:32] or adult turned into a sheet that is
[1:25:34] impossible for every kind of life
[1:25:36] produces the same kind and there is no
[1:25:39] change in specie I'm gonna make a
[1:25:45] statement right here I don't know why
[1:25:46] this book is so despised I don't
[1:25:51] understand that
[1:25:52] people have been made afraid and it's
[1:25:55] scared of the church age book shame on
[1:25:57] men that have done those things shame on
[1:26:00] them that is not that is not right to
[1:26:03] put that kind of a thing
[1:26:05] this right here by the Word of God it's
[1:26:07] setting out election it sets out what
[1:26:10] the true birth of the Holy Ghost is all
[1:26:12] about but I'll tell you a stream that I
[1:26:15] find I find a stream by those who stand
[1:26:18] against it and oppose it it still is
[1:26:20] very much opposed they have trouble when
[1:26:22] it takes away from fleshly
[1:26:25] demonstrations of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:28] listen you on the preset way oh yeah all
[1:26:30] - I'm the pastor here I'm responsible by
[1:26:34] God and I'm interested in tearing down
[1:26:37] every scarecrow
[1:26:39] because God never put that scarecrow up
[1:26:42] man put that scarecrow up they manage
[1:26:47] sets for that election it sets forth the
[1:26:50] real true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:26:54] understand people can say I felt this I
[1:26:57] felt that and I felt this but no it's
[1:26:59] where is there a life is there a life
[1:27:02] that's lived by the word we could have
[1:27:05] all kinds of feelings and all kinds of
[1:27:07] sensations but zerubabbel with the plumb
[1:27:10] line with the plummet in his hand
[1:27:13] it's healed of measure and to see all
[1:27:15] the parts of Jerusalem and say is it
[1:27:18] mattering up to the word absolutely all
[1:27:23] to say that I still find that it's
[1:27:26] better that it's fought against and and
[1:27:28] still despised listen friends I ain't
[1:27:30] pickin on no one person or no one body
[1:27:32] I'm telling you as my congregation as
[1:27:35] those that come here and you hear the
[1:27:37] word you ought to shake away from all of
[1:27:39] those things if that stuff has been
[1:27:41] crammed in you you ought to denounce it
[1:27:44] in the name of Jesus Christ and pass
[1:27:46] that off that is a doctrine of man it is
[1:27:50] not the doctrine of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:02] as we were in the thoughts of God and
[1:28:06] then expressed in flesh there had to
[1:28:10] come a day when we would hear his voice
[1:28:14] the word you understand the word it's
[1:28:20] not working you into something you
[1:28:23] understand right while the word is going
[1:28:26] forth you can be born again while Peter
[1:28:29] yet spake these words the Holy Ghost
[1:28:32] fell on them Paul laid hands on those
[1:28:35] that's true come on somebody that's a
[1:28:39] life that is changed that's been
[1:28:41] quickened that's met God face to face
[1:28:46] revealing who you are there had to come
[1:28:50] a day when we would hear his voice the
[1:28:51] word and hearing that voice become aware
[1:28:54] of our Father calling us and recognized
[1:28:57] that we are the sons of God oh my think
[1:29:05] of this and let me just refer to this I
[1:29:07] I'm not going to put this up on the
[1:29:08] screen but think of how the Lord Jesus
[1:29:10] said it forth even in the Book of Luke
[1:29:13] he talked about having a hundred sheep
[1:29:15] one sheep was lost what did he do went
[1:29:20] and saved that she him saving it didn't
[1:29:22] make it a sheep it always was a sheep he
[1:29:28] talks about the woman she had the dead a
[1:29:30] Jew the Jew falls out in what she do
[1:29:33] sweep and clean and reclaim what is
[1:29:36] already hers that's redemption there can
[1:29:43] be things that you might feel like that
[1:29:45] there been a little something that's
[1:29:46] missing out of your life but what does
[1:29:48] it do it causes you to sweep come on
[1:29:52] friends if the rapture is going to be a
[1:29:53] sweep then you ought to be sweepers
[1:29:56] right sweeping to make sure everything
[1:29:59] is in order
[1:30:01] what is she doing she is claiming taking
[1:30:04] back seeking for what she knows belongs
[1:30:06] to her
[1:30:12] now in John chapter 10 my in John
[1:30:19] chapter 10 here we are
[1:30:22] spoken we are sheep of God now there's a
[1:30:28] lot of ways a lot of angels or we can
[1:30:30] minister and we can preach because it
[1:30:32] this word can be applied in John 10 it
[1:30:34] can be applied to to the age it can be
[1:30:36] applied to the local body it can be
[1:30:38] applied it can be applied right down
[1:30:40] into your home to apply it in your life
[1:30:41] there's many applications for it but
[1:30:48] what we want to look at and take this
[1:30:49] this angle is in Redemption in verse 1
[1:30:54] Jesus said verily verily I say unto you
[1:30:57] he that entereth not by the door into
[1:31:00] the sheepfold but climbeth up some other
[1:31:02] way the same is a thief and robber
[1:31:06] so he's relating to be known the way of
[1:31:09] entrance we'll let you know who it is
[1:31:13] see that goes even down to your personal
[1:31:15] life what does a thief and a robber want
[1:31:19] to do come in and take something from
[1:31:21] you
[1:31:22] a thief wants to come in stealthily a
[1:31:27] robber will come in forcefully a thief
[1:31:32] can come in and insert a thought in your
[1:31:34] mind and you get drawn that thought and
[1:31:35] for you know it you're defeated a robber
[1:31:39] can come and just hit you hit you flat
[1:31:42] out straight forward now I'm bringing
[1:31:44] this down to a spiritual life but it
[1:31:48] applies here it comes into redemption he
[1:31:50] that does not come by the door he's a
[1:31:52] thief and a robber what is a thief and a
[1:31:55] robber about it's all about me me me me
[1:32:00] me me me me it's all about me
[1:32:11] you never sing that song the same way
[1:32:13] will you but he the interest in by the
[1:32:19] door not one but the door is the
[1:32:22] Shepherd of the sheep all of the
[1:32:27] Shepherd comes through the door that's
[1:32:31] the gun that that is a pre designation
[1:32:34] what is the door the door is the word
[1:32:37] the Shepherds gonna come through the
[1:32:40] door now stay with me now to him verse
[1:32:44] three to him the porter a--the the
[1:32:47] porter openeth so the Shepherd coming to
[1:32:52] the door the porter is standing there
[1:32:55] and the porter is the one that gives him
[1:32:57] entrance if he ain't the Shepherd the
[1:33:02] porter ain't giving him entrance you see
[1:33:05] how God had it all set forth that knew
[1:33:09] there was no other seed nothing could
[1:33:13] take you in deception you are always a
[1:33:17] sheep of God listen friends even when
[1:33:19] you and I were not aware of it the Holy
[1:33:21] Spirit was watching over her life God
[1:33:25] never forgot you never were out of sight
[1:33:28] out of mind
[1:33:29] he knew exactly because when you and I
[1:33:31] were born into this world we were
[1:33:33] expressed waiting to be manifested he
[1:33:38] knows he lee and lost track of one to
[1:33:43] him the porter openeth they men you see
[1:33:48] that's why it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:33:50] coming upon our life it takes the Holy
[1:33:52] Spirit what does the Spirit of God it's
[1:33:54] moving that what that the word can enter
[1:33:57] into our life he that is born of the
[1:33:59] water and of the Spirit and what none of
[1:34:03] us when the porter openeth the sheep
[1:34:07] hear his voice so we've got a door
[1:34:10] Shepherd Porter voice and the sheep hear
[1:34:17] his voice and he calleth his own sheep
[1:34:22] me and leadeth them out so the Shepherd
[1:34:28] comes and he speaks to the Sheep
[1:34:33] he knows him by name they hear his voice
[1:34:36] and he leads them out leads no matter
[1:34:40] what leads him out from underneath the
[1:34:43] life where they were and the Shepherd
[1:34:46] comes to lead the Sheep forth amen it's
[1:34:50] got to come up when he the spirit of
[1:34:52] truth is come he will lead and guide you
[1:34:54] into all truth it must be the Shepherd
[1:34:57] come to do what raise up the Sheep
[1:35:00] how does he done because he knows their
[1:35:03] name by his voice they hear his voice
[1:35:06] and when he put it forth
[1:35:09] oh I love that when he put it forth his
[1:35:11] own sheep he puts him forth he goes
[1:35:18] before them so he didn't before just put
[1:35:21] you out there's not putting you out when
[1:35:24] he has brought you forth he's going
[1:35:28] before you the paths are laid out you're
[1:35:33] following the shepherd the bishop of
[1:35:36] your soul he'll is committed to your
[1:35:39] care nor a difficult when the enemy
[1:35:44] would come in like a flood it's the
[1:35:46] Shepherd that's there in the door that's
[1:35:50] why the Holy Spirit is the seal upon the
[1:35:53] door
[1:35:54] it's Christ himself that seals the
[1:35:58] individual not your flesh not your
[1:36:05] spirit but he seals this
[1:36:11] you can sense things out in here but
[1:36:14] down in here there is a piece sometimes
[1:36:18] you wonder where that piece is at but
[1:36:20] yet beyond all the midst of it like what
[1:36:22] was preached here on Thursday night is
[1:36:24] something about it is such a great
[1:36:25] paradox that you know there is peace in
[1:36:30] the midst of a situation that you don't
[1:36:32] know how things are going to turn out
[1:36:33] how things are going to come out you
[1:36:35] don't even make sense to you to have
[1:36:37] that kind of a peace because you didn't
[1:36:38] produce it this is not a piece that's
[1:36:42] produced by man this is the peace of God
[1:36:48] and he goes before them and the Sheep
[1:36:51] follow him before they know his voice
[1:36:54] and the stranger they will not follow
[1:36:57] but flee from him for they know not the
[1:36:59] voice of strangers this parable spake
[1:37:03] Jesus unto them but they understood not
[1:37:05] what he was what he was saying verse 10
[1:37:07] then he sent unto them I am the door of
[1:37:10] the Sheep all that ever came before me
[1:37:14] are thieves and robbers trying to take
[1:37:18] away but the Sheep did not hear them
[1:37:25] they did not have the voice to raise up
[1:37:29] sheep you with me there were thieves and
[1:37:34] robbers but the Shepherd he is the one
[1:37:39] alone that can raise up the Sheep I am
[1:37:43] the door by me oh I love the scripture
[1:37:45] If any man enter in he shall be saved
[1:37:49] and shall go in and out and find pasture
[1:37:51] so now look out the Lord Jesus has moved
[1:37:54] in the first verses he's letting it be
[1:37:56] known he is the Shepherd of the Sheep
[1:37:58] you were sheep all the time then he
[1:38:00] moves it in now he's moving it along I
[1:38:03] am the door so he has become the
[1:38:06] entranceway he is the entranceway what
[1:38:09] he the word made flesh is the
[1:38:12] entranceway the promise is no longer
[1:38:16] just just I'll promise a future but now
[1:38:20] it is present are you with me and if any
[1:38:25] men notice he puts it back to choice
[1:38:27] we've got a choice right By Me If any
[1:38:33] man enter in he shall be saved and shall
[1:38:35] go in and out and find pasture he's
[1:38:39] speaking of the new birth they meant the
[1:38:43] entrance the the expression of of a
[1:38:46] sheep he's talking about when we enter
[1:38:48] in then he shall go in and out and find
[1:38:50] pasture come into a placement as the son
[1:38:54] of God
[1:38:55] as the sheep of God entering in by him
[1:38:58] by one spirit we're all baptized into
[1:39:01] one body been going in and out what is
[1:39:03] this going in and out David said even
[1:39:05] Solomon down lowing down and down
[1:39:07] through the scriptures he preserves my
[1:39:09] coming in and my going out my coming in
[1:39:11] and my going out then Solomon said teach
[1:39:14] me Lord how to be the king I don't know
[1:39:15] how to come in and I don't know how to
[1:39:17] go out but here right here what is the
[1:39:19] coming in and they're going out it is
[1:39:20] the character of life he is sitting
[1:39:24] right down to guide and direct and mold
[1:39:26] and shape our character and he will find
[1:39:31] pasture not just when you come to church
[1:39:32] it's not about a building but now you
[1:39:35] are birthed into the body of Jesus
[1:39:38] Christ and there is strength you can
[1:39:41] able to draw strength from that word you
[1:39:43] can be walking right down the middle of
[1:39:44] the store and here you are meditating on
[1:39:47] a promise of God and all of a sudden it
[1:39:49] drops right down and something just
[1:39:51] illuminates what is it you are in the
[1:39:54] pasture of the Lord and the Lord is
[1:39:57] speaking to you're not John not confined
[1:39:59] to a building but you are in his pasture
[1:40:03] feeding from him jesus said in verse 10
[1:40:09] the thief cometh not but for to steal
[1:40:10] and to kill and to destroy I am come
[1:40:13] that they might have life and that they
[1:40:15] might have it more abundantly I am The
[1:40:18] Good Shepherd is not saying that all
[1:40:23] that were before were false but I am bad
[1:40:27] the truth
[1:40:28] all others were types I am that true
[1:40:31] Shepherd I am The Good Shepherd where
[1:40:34] all the other shepherds could Karen and
[1:40:36] you know how God would set down among
[1:40:38] Israel and they would doing with a care
[1:40:40] a desire you know where David would have
[1:40:42] for the people of God but yet we see
[1:40:45] that imperfection even that lays there
[1:40:47] within man but here this is the Good
[1:40:50] Shepherd his whole intent his whole
[1:40:53] purpose it's never been about him it's
[1:40:56] been about you the whole plan of
[1:41:00] redemption it's been about him coming
[1:41:02] for you he I'm coming to clean you he
[1:41:05] I'm coming to take you he counted not
[1:41:10] his own life dear he laid his own life
[1:41:12] down he didn't have to he wasn't forced
[1:41:17] to remember he says I have been given
[1:41:20] commandment of my father
[1:41:22] I thought commandments were passed no
[1:41:27] Commandments are our divine utterance by
[1:41:29] God we're not talking about just
[1:41:32] Commandments things that are engraving
[1:41:33] and stone we're talking about a divine
[1:41:35] utterance of Almighty God
[1:41:37] here he is we've been given commandment
[1:41:39] of laying down his life it wasn't
[1:41:41] something that he that as far as within
[1:41:44] did not want to do the outside man
[1:41:46] listen to me now the outside man asked
[1:41:49] if it's possible let this cup pass from
[1:41:52] me come on friends where was when we see
[1:41:57] this in the garden of when we see this
[1:41:58] in the garden of gethsemane a struggle a
[1:42:01] battle was going on he had been
[1:42:06] submissive to the Father all the time we
[1:42:12] can look at many of the wonderful things
[1:42:13] here he goes down and the miracles that
[1:42:15] are performed it he goes here and he
[1:42:16] goes there but listen this was the
[1:42:18] climax right here
[1:42:21] where the purpose had reached right now
[1:42:25] he's come into the fullness of the
[1:42:27] purpose and right there in the Garden of
[1:42:32] Gethsemane every demon was gathered
[1:42:34] together
[1:42:37] tempting him you don't have to go
[1:42:39] through with this you don't have to keep
[1:42:40] going on you don't have to keep going
[1:42:41] through this you don't have to he felt
[1:42:45] that pool if it's possible let this cup
[1:42:50] pass from me John 12 my soul troubles
[1:42:54] right Hebrews 5 7 he was heard in that
[1:42:58] he was with fear and strong crying fear
[1:43:02] fear oh yes he experienced fear in the
[1:43:06] book of Mark the word that it uses right
[1:43:09] there when the midst of the time that
[1:43:10] he's in the garden the very word that it
[1:43:12] uses were that he is overcoming
[1:43:14] overwhelmed that very word speaks to the
[1:43:16] apex of depression that's exactly what
[1:43:18] that word means he experienced the
[1:43:20] greatness of that but he made a choice
[1:43:24] he loved the sunsets
[1:43:27] he loved the time with his brethren but
[1:43:31] he knew that he could not save them
[1:43:37] unless he gave himself away his love was
[1:43:43] so great that he did not keep himself
[1:43:45] back and his love led him to Calvary for
[1:43:54] you and me here he stands the tree of
[1:43:59] life the man tree those two trees in the
[1:44:04] garden were set for birth purposes here
[1:44:08] stands this man tree when he's here upon
[1:44:10] the earth this tree of life he says
[1:44:13] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:44:15] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:44:17] in you
[1:44:17] what's he talking about partaking they
[1:44:20] had partaken of the other tree now in
[1:44:23] order to receive life you must partake
[1:44:25] of this tree how could they partake of
[1:44:28] it we could not get back to the Garden
[1:44:30] of Eden but it must be the tree of life
[1:44:32] had to become one of us
[1:44:35] Oh glory be to God what was God's desire
[1:44:44] here when you think for example let me
[1:44:50] just kind of have just a few more
[1:44:52] moments God and his coming is he is
[1:45:00] coming is to breed back sons and
[1:45:05] daughters of God again a lot of things
[1:45:08] I've seen him down the road here
[1:45:09] harvesting soybeans when they came in
[1:45:11] today no doubt many of these plants that
[1:45:17] they've planted along through here
[1:45:18] probably most of them are hybrids right
[1:45:23] hybrid can only produce hybrid when they
[1:45:27] have taken you know a part of that of an
[1:45:29] original and they have tried to
[1:45:30] genetically you know constructed here
[1:45:32] there or whatever more you see all of
[1:45:34] those things continues to break down
[1:45:36] it's brought us to a place even where we
[1:45:38] are in in our humanity right now things
[1:45:42] have been broken down naturally the
[1:45:44] foods we eat and everything else but to
[1:45:48] see how that within that you can never
[1:45:50] come back to an original the only thing
[1:45:53] you can produce is a high breeding but
[1:45:55] there must come an original and in
[1:45:58] coming an original the reason of that
[1:46:00] original there must be an original seed
[1:46:03] come that's able to raise up sons and
[1:46:08] daughters of God are you with me
[1:46:12] it's got to be seed that's here beneath
[1:46:15] this hybrid this first birth there's got
[1:46:20] to be seed there that's able to be
[1:46:22] raised up this is why where the
[1:46:25] scriptures would set it forth and I'm
[1:46:27] just I'm just phrasing and referring to
[1:46:29] a now this is where Paul would say that
[1:46:32] see that that first man that came was
[1:46:34] natural but the second man spiritual the
[1:46:37] first man was of the earth that first
[1:46:39] Adam but that second Adam it was a
[1:46:42] quickening spirit him was the Lord from
[1:46:45] heaven
[1:46:46] become that he might quicken and bring
[1:46:50] to life now notice within this here of
[1:46:54] how that God coming down and becoming
[1:46:57] one of us how that here we were in in in
[1:47:02] Paul refers us in the in the book of
[1:47:04] Galatians of how that we were in verse
[1:47:07] three we were in bondage even though we
[1:47:09] were children we were under we were in
[1:47:11] bondage under the elements of the world
[1:47:13] but when the fullness of time was come
[1:47:15] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[1:47:18] made under the law to redeem them what's
[1:47:21] redeemed by back what belongs to you to
[1:47:26] redeem them that were under the law that
[1:47:29] we might receive the adoption of sons so
[1:47:33] there must come one God become one of us
[1:47:37] to take his own laws and live by him let
[1:47:44] me just drop this real clear he was the
[1:47:48] Virgin born son of god the Spirit of God
[1:47:53] sought him out in perfect obedience
[1:47:57] quicken that word and it became the word
[1:48:00] made flesh you with me now
[1:48:04] so here the Spirit of God moving down
[1:48:09] and quickening and raising up is the
[1:48:12] righteousness of God moving in there the
[1:48:15] Lord Jesus listen he was tempted in all
[1:48:17] points such as we are without sin he had
[1:48:22] dead listen he there had to be a perfect
[1:48:25] life and there's no way it could be a
[1:48:27] perfect life without God himself
[1:48:30] perfectly coming inside of him but
[1:48:37] notice the keeping of the law where he
[1:48:39] wasn't just that he did this and he did
[1:48:41] that and I don't do this and I don't do
[1:48:43] that it was by the righteousness where
[1:48:46] the desire on the inside I delight to do
[1:48:49] thy will o God daddy is the
[1:48:52] righteousness of God that is raised up
[1:48:57] you understand what I'm saying if you're
[1:49:00] looking at your life and trying to
[1:49:01] compare it to his life and say he was
[1:49:03] tempted without sin but I still make
[1:49:05] mistakes so that's not that's not your
[1:49:08] part the part is is the righteousness of
[1:49:12] God the holiness of God that has raised
[1:49:15] you up from within the desire has been
[1:49:19] quickened it's been raised up and he we
[1:49:23] have an advocate with the father we're
[1:49:25] not talking about a compromising
[1:49:27] defeating life we're talking about he
[1:49:29] had to be the perfect lamb there could
[1:49:32] not be one spot on him but couldn't be
[1:49:35] one thing notice when he said before God
[1:49:38] allowed him to come before the tribunal
[1:49:40] of the world I find no fault in him but
[1:49:44] religious people of that day they were
[1:49:46] they broke their own law by meeting in
[1:49:49] the Sanhedrin at that time they broke
[1:49:51] the law in trying to condemn him they
[1:49:55] couldn't find no fault in him so they're
[1:49:58] trying to bring false accusations
[1:50:00] against him but he was the perfect Lamb
[1:50:04] of God that was to be offered up and you
[1:50:07] and I were identified in that sacrifice
[1:50:13] when he went to Calvary we went to
[1:50:17] Calvary in it hello when he raised up on
[1:50:22] that resurrection morning we raised up
[1:50:25] with him glory be to God I need more
[1:50:34] time to drive that down but I'm not
[1:50:35] gonna I'm not gonna take it you say
[1:50:38] brother salmon why you say that cuz
[1:50:39] sometimes we get caught up in the
[1:50:41] righteousness of God and looking at this
[1:50:42] flesh I do this and I do that that's not
[1:50:45] the rights another god that's yours the
[1:50:48] righteousness of God is the seal of the
[1:50:50] Holy Ghost he hath made us he has made
[1:50:55] us accepted in the beloved sometimes
[1:51:04] friends is very important it's you mean
[1:51:06] to be careful on how you getting your
[1:51:07] eyes set cuz you can be looking at some
[1:51:09] one's character that's being transformed
[1:51:11] and you're saying this and saying that
[1:51:13] and not recognizing there's a son and
[1:51:14] daughter of God living right there well
[1:51:18] why they still doing this why they're
[1:51:20] still doing that why are you still doing
[1:51:21] that you're cocklebur stinks just as bad
[1:51:27] as theirs come on somebody
[1:51:30] you see that's something that
[1:51:32] self-righteousness that's the very thing
[1:51:34] the Prophet stood right in God in
[1:51:36] simplicity he addressed that thing we're
[1:51:38] not talking about self-righteousness he
[1:51:42] alluded to it people wearing just gonna
[1:51:44] wear white shirts and long-sleeve shirts
[1:51:46] he said that and I didn't say that
[1:51:51] self-righteousness that's not what the
[1:51:54] word come to produce it produces a holy
[1:51:57] desire the righteousness of God on the
[1:52:02] inside he calls you to himself
[1:52:08] you love him this morning this is where
[1:52:12] he said except a corn of wheat fall into
[1:52:13] the ground and die it abideth owned if
[1:52:16] it die it bringeth forth much fruit here
[1:52:23] in quote here I want to I want to finish
[1:52:26] reading this part here and certain the
[1:52:30] Simonian church age they're right under
[1:52:33] yeah right there the Prophet said before
[1:52:37] I close this subject I know there is a
[1:52:38] question in your minds you want to know
[1:52:41] if I believe in the doctrine of pre
[1:52:42] existence I don't believe in that Mormon
[1:52:45] doctrine of the pre existence of souls
[1:52:47] any more than I believe in reincarnation
[1:52:48] or transmigration of souls be careful
[1:52:52] and see this it is not the person that
[1:52:55] comes predestinated eternally from God
[1:52:57] it is the word or seed that is it now
[1:53:04] you catch that apply that back to weeks
[1:53:06] ago when the Prophet was saying now I
[1:53:09] can't believe that adultery is a
[1:53:11] predestinated seed what's he talking
[1:53:14] about
[1:53:14] the act
[1:53:17] are you with me the act because we
[1:53:23] showed brought in Rohan
[1:53:25] Ruth brought in Rahab brought in Kaleb
[1:53:29] there were curses on all of them Kaleb
[1:53:33] was a kin in sight
[1:53:34] his great great granddaddy Esau all
[1:53:39] right
[1:53:40] but the grace of God knew there was a
[1:53:42] seed down there
[1:53:46] do you understand it's not the person
[1:53:48] now listen
[1:53:49] let me to work with this a minute does
[1:53:50] the person himself does God know how
[1:53:53] that you would come your color your hair
[1:53:55] your color of your eyes and all those
[1:53:56] things sure but remember this has got to
[1:54:00] be changed just as this has changed
[1:54:04] that's why in things that are to be the
[1:54:07] Prophet let's you know that in the body
[1:54:09] change we're not all gonna pass through
[1:54:10] a miracle Weight Watchers and we're all
[1:54:12] gonna be different over there and we're
[1:54:15] gonna all of a sudden pass through and
[1:54:16] we're gonna get our noses straightened
[1:54:17] out and we're not going to have you know
[1:54:18] the big nose or this or that or that's
[1:54:20] not what it is are you with me I I would
[1:54:32] say that that that admonishment in our
[1:54:34] hearts and lives ought to be you know
[1:54:35] what Lord just let me focus on me not
[1:54:38] being selfish but let me just focus on
[1:54:41] the word becoming in my life I might see
[1:54:44] something might see another brother
[1:54:45] another sister I can pray for him I can
[1:54:48] want to encourage them and want to lift
[1:54:49] them up but remember you and I are just
[1:54:52] in need of the grace of God as much as
[1:54:54] anybody else
[1:54:55] the moment that we drift away from that
[1:54:57] and we do at times both saying I don't
[1:55:02] you're lying right now you do this is
[1:55:05] where the scripture said over and over
[1:55:06] paul tells them over and over in
[1:55:09] different places of the letters a man or
[1:55:12] not to think more highly of himself any
[1:55:14] off to think but think soberly
[1:55:21] compliments are wonderful but don't get
[1:55:23] intoxicated with them
[1:55:26] it's not the person that comes
[1:55:28] predestinate eternally from God it's the
[1:55:30] word or seed that is it way back there
[1:55:33] too far back for the human mind to grasp
[1:55:35] the eternal God with eternal thoughts
[1:55:38] thought and decreed Jacob have I loved
[1:55:42] but Esau have I hated and neither was
[1:55:46] born neither had done good or evil see
[1:55:49] it was the thought and then that thought
[1:55:51] become expressed and God bought back
[1:55:54] Jacob because Jacob alone was seed well
[1:56:00] look at this Jacob alone had the seed
[1:56:02] that is why he had respect to the
[1:56:05] birthright and covenant of God
[1:56:09] Esau had no desire he had no respect for
[1:56:18] the birthright ah you could see the
[1:56:22] difference setting in if you are true
[1:56:24] seed you will hear that word the spirit
[1:56:27] will baptize you into the body of Christ
[1:56:29] filling you and empowering you and you
[1:56:33] will receive the word for your day and
[1:56:35] age see how clear the true evidence
[1:56:37] becomes when the word is revealed to you
[1:56:40] now watch this how you and I come he
[1:56:44] came the same way your God creates a
[1:56:49] body to come and live in and bring
[1:56:54] Redemption he always was the word is
[1:57:00] that right when he stood there at the
[1:57:02] temple that day and he has a 12 year old
[1:57:05] boy he reasoned and so forth with those
[1:57:08] Pharisees the Bible also says in the
[1:57:13] Book of Luke that this child grew in
[1:57:16] wisdom the word he was always the word
[1:57:22] now watch this Jesus was the Royal seed
[1:57:26] he lived in a human body
[1:57:28] and when the spirit called to him O Lord
[1:57:32] he didn't always have the spirit
[1:57:36] you know the spirit called to him the
[1:57:44] word manifested thought he went to
[1:57:47] Jordan and was there baptized in water
[1:57:50] upon obeying the word the Holy Spirit
[1:57:55] came upon him what is this Redemption
[1:58:00] Redemption this is the same thing for
[1:58:03] you and I always was the word but now
[1:58:06] walking up out of the water it is the
[1:58:08] word made flesh and the voice said this
[1:58:11] is my beloved son hear you him the voice
[1:58:13] did not say this has become my son Jesus
[1:58:19] was the son the Holy Ghost positioned
[1:58:23] him as that son before them all then
[1:58:27] having been filled thus the same pattern
[1:58:29] holds at Pentecost in or after he went
[1:58:32] in demonstrated power receiving the full
[1:58:34] revelation of God and from God for that
[1:58:38] day the scripture let me just refer to
[1:58:47] this scripture here I'm trying to get to
[1:58:50] a place here brother Branham takes this
[1:58:54] in Galatians 4 and he takes this in
[1:58:58] Galatians 4 and he refers this part in
[1:59:00] the word that this is our triumphal
[1:59:03] capstone on the baptism of the Holy
[1:59:06] Ghost great victory over throwing
[1:59:12] doctrines and traditions in it this is
[1:59:15] our triumphal capstone on the baptism of
[1:59:18] the Holy Ghost and he brings it down
[1:59:20] into Galatians 4 verse 4 through verse 7
[1:59:23] but in verse in verse 6 there it says
[1:59:26] and because ye are son God hath sent
[1:59:32] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:59:34] hearts crying Abba Father because you
[1:59:39] are not having me come on he sent for
[1:59:43] the spirit to do what raise up
[1:59:47] that which was always within you so you
[1:59:53] don't buy the breeding back we don't
[1:59:55] bear the image of a church we don't we
[2:00:00] don't bear the image we're not we're not
[2:00:01] bearing being the image of a founder
[2:00:04] they meant the Lord Jesus is come right
[2:00:07] here among us we're not bearing an
[2:00:09] unearthly image we're reflecting a
[2:00:12] heavenly image they meant God's did you
[2:00:17] know it's wonderful for God to have a
[2:00:19] life to be cleaned up that God wants his
[2:00:21] image reflected through us the Spirit of
[2:00:26] God coming it's like that where the
[2:00:28] Prophet would give that example of how
[2:00:31] that here we come into this earth he's
[2:00:37] like that talks about how that farmer
[2:00:40] took that egg story we've heard a lot
[2:00:46] but the farmer took the egg out out of
[2:00:49] the eagle's nest he did not he taken
[2:00:53] that egg it was always an eagle but he
[2:00:58] took it and he put it under a hen the
[2:01:03] head had the atmosphere then this year
[2:01:06] it hatches it comes forth but that Eagle
[2:01:11] was always an eagle why was it acting
[2:01:15] like a chicken it was only acting at the
[2:01:18] image that was set before it that's why
[2:01:22] it must be the image of Christ that is
[2:01:26] set before us not the image of a man not
[2:01:29] the image of a church the image of
[2:01:32] Christ he walked around he lived like a
[2:01:42] chicken for a long time but one day one
[2:01:48] day mama Eagle she knew that there was
[2:01:54] another egg
[2:01:57] I want you to notice how the Prophet he
[2:02:01] places it right here in this same
[2:02:02] portion I'm reading from he said mama
[2:02:05] Eagle spied that little eagle on the
[2:02:08] ground she saw him first
[2:02:14] God always knew where you were at her
[2:02:18] brother said no I was out there in the
[2:02:20] nominations but I just knew there had to
[2:02:22] be something more I didn't wait a minute
[2:02:24] well why was it why was there a longing
[2:02:27] because God was dealing with your heart
[2:02:31] God was dealing with your heart he was
[2:02:34] tearing something up
[2:02:35] you weren't content you you tried to go
[2:02:38] along with everything else but she spied
[2:02:43] that little eagle and when she spotted a
[2:02:47] little hell the prophet plays he says
[2:02:48] she swooped down with tremendous speed
[2:02:51] Oh glory breaking out of eternity she
[2:02:56] swooped down with tremendous speed and
[2:03:00] she began to scream out she began to
[2:03:04] call out and it was that voice that
[2:03:07] directed his head for way from the
[2:03:10] chickens it was something in him that he
[2:03:13] was raising something up in him he
[2:03:15] desired to be that what was it because
[2:03:19] that's what he was but the voice came
[2:03:23] knowing who he was the Weisse came and
[2:03:26] she told him he was but notice he said
[2:03:29] I'm afraid but she said just spread your
[2:03:35] wings
[2:03:40] hey man it's already there was in you
[2:03:43] believe catch on long the draught of the
[2:03:46] wind catch on the wind and be carried
[2:03:49] away from the chicken yard all he had to
[2:03:53] do was Freddie's wing and the Prophet
[2:03:54] said it just like this he said something
[2:03:57] had stirred within him all he longed and
[2:04:00] he launched out toward that all he was
[2:04:02] afraid to try but he said all of a
[2:04:05] sudden beating his wings he hurled
[2:04:07] himself into the wind I love that it
[2:04:12] wasn't something graceful it wasn't
[2:04:14] something that maybe looked pretty when
[2:04:17] he first took off but he hurled himself
[2:04:19] where towards the voice the voice was
[2:04:22] calling him beyond what he always knew
[2:04:26] something had to come to let him know
[2:04:30] who he was and the voice released within
[2:04:35] him now know something he always
[2:04:40] wondered about why my feet are different
[2:04:42] than their feet why I've got this beak
[2:04:45] like it is why I can't fit in he thought
[2:04:51] something was wrong with him it was he
[2:04:54] was in the wrong place but there was one
[2:04:57] who came of his own one who he was of
[2:05:00] and was able to place him where he
[2:05:05] needed to be walking down there with the
[2:05:07] chickens he really couldn't be
[2:05:08] recognized as an eagle but when he got
[2:05:11] up in the sky oh then he's recognized as
[2:05:14] an eagle and he begins to recognize more
[2:05:18] and more the more he soars
[2:05:19] this is Who I am now you know what he
[2:05:22] can look back and he knows where he come
[2:05:25] from he knows he's been lifted up and he
[2:05:28] knows he's in the image of the one who
[2:05:31] has brood over his life what does he
[2:05:34] have to do keep flying
[2:05:38] keep soaring sure things will try to
[2:05:43] weight you down sure they'll be drafts
[2:05:44] but you know what your let him teach you
[2:05:47] he'll teach you how to move within the
[2:05:50] thermals he'll teach you how to wear
[2:05:52] that when you come into service that all
[2:05:54] of a sudden you just don't blow
[2:05:55] everything out and don't got nothing to
[2:05:57] go forward with he'll teach you how to
[2:06:00] harness that you'll teach you how to how
[2:06:03] to how to grow strong he'll teach you
[2:06:06] how that in the midst of tests and
[2:06:07] trials how how to move through it
[2:06:12] because he's faithful he's faithful the
[2:06:16] new birth it raises you up raises me up
[2:06:21] ask that ego if you ever want to go back
[2:06:23] to the chicken yard again never he's
[2:06:28] found something so much better
[2:06:30] as a matter of fact he hunts chickens
[2:06:32] now he eats him his beak no wonder he
[2:06:41] couldn't pick up that crack corn he was
[2:06:45] eating that stuff he was eating that
[2:06:47] stuff oh my he needed fresh meat so you
[2:06:51] know what what was it the voice gave him
[2:06:54] strength he comes out but now has he's
[2:06:56] come out and flying now what is it his
[2:06:58] diet his diet is gonna change try to get
[2:07:03] that boy to go back he can crack corn
[2:07:04] again
[2:07:04] no sir he's eating fresh meat from then
[2:07:07] on he's a ripper of the beak and he
[2:07:09] realizes this is why I am made this way
[2:07:12] this is why I got long talons it was
[2:07:16] made to catch those big old salmon
[2:07:28] there's no one that can tell you and I
[2:07:31] who we are outside of him and listen
[2:07:37] friends that's why it's important that
[2:07:39] you feed your experience God the new
[2:07:44] birth did not call you to a movement
[2:07:47] that that gets old this is not a
[2:07:53] movement it is the ministration of the
[2:07:58] Spirit of God the Holy Spirit and has
[2:08:02] come to seek out those which to lift you
[2:08:09] from this realm into that other realm
[2:08:13] that place that now becomes a reality to
[2:08:17] you you understand what I'm saying

[2:08:31] drag this guy sometimes but I'm talking
[2:08:34] about this on the inside I'm talking
[2:08:38] about the new birth on the inside I'm
[2:08:40] talking about him raising you up and
[2:08:44] giving strength and you subdue that guy
[2:08:48] it gives you strength to subdue that
[2:08:50] outer man and bring him
[2:08:55] from cocklebur we I trust that God will
[2:09:01] just developer and the whole thought for
[2:09:03] you a lot of things that are here but I
[2:09:09] trust that it's clear to you the clarity

[2:09:14] you did not become sheep on a certain
[2:09:17] day you did not become sons and
[2:09:19] daughters on a certain day you always
[2:09:21] were
