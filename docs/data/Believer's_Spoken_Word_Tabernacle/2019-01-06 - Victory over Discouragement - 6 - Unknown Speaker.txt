thank you for your mercy in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen if you turn with me in the word of the Lord we want to look at first Peter chapter one and read a few verses of scripture there while you're standing I want to make mention this Lord willing this coming Thursday we want we're going to kind of dedicate the service to some testimonies and singing and Lord willing there's a few things that I'll share on my heart and I thought I was going to do that this past Thursday but it wasn't really planned out that well so I wanted to let you know well ahead of time I just my heart was just has just been sold I'm always rejoicing in the word of the Lord and I just always thank God for the simplicity of the word because of the Holy Spirit it's come here in this hour the Word of God the Bible is just it's a brand-new book amen it's a it's an ancient book but it's become a new book to us and we just thank God for that and just so thank God for His mercy so we want to look here at verse three well we read a few verses scripture and then we'll let you be seated verse three said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations look at that verse 6 again wherein you greatly rejoice for what God has done and for what he has brought us to that realization by the indwelling of His Spirit we have a body reserved in the heavens and in that we greatly greatly rejoice then it unfolds and after that comma though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than a gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory very important it didn't say that ye rejoice with happiness happiness comes and goes joy remains joy is in the depths of our soul in that wonderful happiness is something you can be up and it can be down but joy itself it comes from knowing in whom we have believed and that's where when all there's no other ground to stand on we stand in him no wonder Paul could say having done all to stand stand therefore having you know your loins Girt about with truth and he goes on through that notice let's read verse 9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow may God bless you bless the reading of his word your being seated I want to just draw your attention here brother Brian I don't know if it's the base or what it's a little bit I'm getting a little bit of rebound up here it's not a ring it's just a little bit maybe much on me right now don't don't necessarily take these things down so much but it might be the base the scripture I want you to notice here the verses that we've read it's it declares to us of what God has done for us through the Lord Jesus Christ where that he has brought us to himself and through this birth within our life it brings us to the realization that we were always a part of him and it makes us aware that we have a body reserved in the heavens that body is undefiled it's uncorruptible that body was not made by man that body was made by God it's eternal with God it is our representation before the throne of God another term that we use and to know it is our theophany our word body it is that that is not terrestrial but a celestial body and to know that how that God hasn't has already prepared and God coming in dealing with our lives was no accident it was not something that you II just happened upon but God knows and knew where each of us were at and when God became flesh he took on flesh remember the purpose of redemption was not of a wholesale affair the purpose of redemption he became flesh the Bible says the Son of man has come to seek and save that which was lost so he come Redemption is to bring back what belongs to him and that's the heart of the scriptures that's the heart of the gospel there's many that will believe in the purchase that was made but never come to the full realization of what it's all about because redemption is for the elect of God the predestinated in mind it doesn't mean that everything comes easy it doesn't mean that everything's gonna be handed to us on a on a cake platter but what it simply means is is that God himself has ordained and chosen us and God will be the one and he is the one that brings us to himself by the way that he has made I think we gather that and understand that and Peter it goes on to speak here within these scriptures of the receiving you'll make this statement in verse 9 receiving the end of our faith even the salvation of our souls so to think of how that even he goes on to speak in verse 10 in verse 11 of how that the prophets of old they prophesied and they spoke of this of this coming time and they were not just speaking of just the advent and the coming of the Messiah but with an awareness that he would come and then to restore the kingdom and so they're looking for this knowing that this this is to come and has Peter's picks picks this up the prophets prophesied by the Spirit of God that was upon them though with the Spirit of Christ within them they themselves did not know when it was going to occur or when it was going to happen but what they knew is that what God had given them even that which we pointed to the leading up of the Messiah and even that which had been spoken that would point to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit even that which would point to that of the Gentile bride as you see that many times in the Old Testament even to that which points to the rapture even that which points you know into the Millennium in the future home and so forth all of that is there within the Old Testament here you have with in the Old Testament everything that's laid out but yet those the prophets when they were speaking they did not know the time the Spirit of God through Peter here says in verse 11 or in verse 12 the salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come to you they were looking you see when the Spirit of God dealt with their lives they were looking for this to come they were expecting and it goes on in the very next scripture searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified before the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow you see they didn't know when everything was going to transpire they did not know when everything was going to happen but they stood upon the word that God had given them to stand upon and to think that how that Peter would you know pick this up here within these scriptures and he would go on to further speak of our conduct and I'm not going to read it for sake of time but Peter would go on to speak of this and he moves to this place in the scriptures and he says if we can in the in the verse 18 he says for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by the tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot I want you to notice this we have been redeemed and Peter remember who is speaking to even as remembered when brother Jason DeMars was here he pointed this out here were Jews that were scattered throughout and here the Holy Spirit is making this known you have been redeemed back to God and you are redeemed here and and from the vain conversation of traditions that you've received from your fathers and in in in how that God has brought you and I not to dead works but to a living works remember living works is by a living faith and so then the work those things that are declared and are brought forth out of our life the Prophet would call it like this and works his faith Express he says it is a holy faith bringing forth holy works so it's not our works it's the Spirit of Christ working in us and through us now think of this here he goes on to make this statement he says who verily was foreordained look at this now verse 20 who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever for all flesh notice I picks this up now for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord and do it forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you there is a part of us we've been born again of the Spirit of God that is eternal it does not fade away but it comes more into view in our lives and yet our outside there is a fading away there is we see it just in our natural bodies the everything we feel different things that we never felt before we see the things of aging but yet on the inside on the inside of the inside there is no weakness but rather it gets more glorious and we find that it's Christ Himself being formed in our life and more and more as we walk with him our lives are to be reflecting Christ more and more just like as it came through the church ages it's the same way that it is coming even within our lives as individuals so Peter within the whole portion even of these scriptures Peter is bringing such a relativity or such a reality that the glory of man it fades but the word of the Lord endures and this in itself is brought to light through the unfolding of the life of Christ think of this Peter could not have even spoken these words had it not been for the revelation of the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ and that of redemption whereby Peter himself becomes a partaker of that sane life this would not be something that Peter could even declare but Peter is standing here declaring this with an assurance that this life is not all there is this life is just merely a passing that's it it passes by so quickly but yet though this life our journey everything is so vitally important and how God is working in our lives and this is where that in the time that as we deal with things go through certain things as we've been looking on this victory over discouragement there's things that can come our way that can be very discouraging all things all around us to try to discourage us sometimes even when it comes to infirmities and sufferings and things within our body sometimes there's things that you've prayed about and here it is a week weeks months and things themselves it seems as it continues to linger you know you can become very despondent or Vera or discouraged but yet within it all where Peter directs our attention within this suffering that takes place is to know what God has done for us and to know that then either suffering that we're going through is just as temporary as this life is right now it's only for a season and we have a body that's waiting there brother bantam places it like this pardon me he places it in this manner in the message who is this Melchizedek and he speaks of their in in Corinthians 2nd Corinthians if this earthly body be dissolved this earthly Tabernacle we have another one we have bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin you know it's very simple if you think of it in this way let's say that there are brakes that they're going they need to put on a 747 all right that's a jet let's just say that those brakes now let's say that the engineering of those brakes and they make them and then they bring it into their test lab and the guys are designed to say no no don't test it no don't test it I would say well you already sound like you have doubts but you see the part of the testing is only to prove what is strong and what is weak the testing does not take away from it being brakes the testing does not make it breaks that's that's exactly how it is and I hope we've got that example when it's gold the proving doesn't make it gold the proving only reveals the gold that's all the testing does it only brings to light what is already there so it doesn't change anything it doesn't add to it just simply brings to light what's there so then this is where the profit is he saying we bypassed that we came straight from God the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin but when testing of his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skip to come right around down here to be tempted and tested he said if we're to come through that there'd have been no temptation we didn't know it all things that's the reason Jesus knowed all things because he was the word before he was flesh then we become the word and he says here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning so it is as he goes on to talk about that spark of life that which was hungry that which was in you already that was desiring was looking for God it was looking for that counterpart it was desiring and how that God Himself by the deposit here is the seed of God within our life and then by the deposit of his seed life coming and quickening that seed and raising it up remember the seed within it has everything already and it just has to be quickened and come forth once it's been quickened it grows in the atmosphere and the presence and the image of Christ is being formed and coming forth in our life that is the forming into the word image let me just drop this here and I'm not gonna labor on this when we are born again of the Spirit of God in our soul we are fully adopted in our soul fully but after this now brings way for us to have a Dominion to have a life within us that the desire that we live by we no longer are living by their old at dimming nature but we're living by the nature of that second atom and our desire is please the Lord that's why that we bring our lives in subjection to the word amen that's why we submit our lives in humility because our desire is to please the Lord not to think of this this testimony that Peter himself he shares this now I want you to think about this for a moment here you have where the scripture would speak in the Gospels of how that Peter was one when the Bible says that Jesus would begin to speak to them concerning the suffering that the Son of Man should suffer remember it was Peter who took him by the hand and the Bible says begin to rebuke him and say it shall not be so Lord and remember the disciples themselves you see the disciples they they recognized who the Lord Jesus was by revelation and yet they also did not see they did not see the necessity of suffering in order to bring Redemption they did not see a price had to be paid and in reality the Pharisees didn't see that either the Pharisees did not see that neither did the Pharisees relieve or recognize there had to come a change in their lives they believed they were free you see what they declared as freedom is what I'm able to do and conform outwardly to I'm able to conform to all of the traditions all the oriole I'm able to conform to that but you see were not to be conformed were to be transformed conforming can take place by good morality strong demeanors and many things like that but a transformation requires the power of Almighty God to lift you and I from the condition we were born in and bring us into a place in the kingdom of his dearly beloved son that's what the purchase of the blood did for you and I it now released the power of God that's able to bring us into a place of reality where we are living by his power his strength by a living faith and what a contrast this is to what Peter has has where he has been before Pentecost remember Peter spoke many bold things before Pentecost but he didn't have what it took to back up what he was saying but you see now that his faith has been quickened watch this in 1st Peter 3:18 the Bible said for Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit what I want you to see is Peter here is clearly pointing out the suffering was not in vain it was for a purpose you see because when the disciples out when the Lord Jesus had been taken they were distraught what has taken place here it's like everything has been ruined the whole thing has been messed up we thought he was the one that was going to redeem Israel he is the Redeemer but there must be suffering and here this is something that we find so clear within the scriptures here as Peter is pointing out this suffering was with a purpose he went there with you and me in mind and we were in him God did not come down haphazardly and wonder is somebody going to feel sorry for me he went with a purpose there was a purpose for what he endured the Bible says in Hebrews 12 that he endured the cross if it's something delightful you don't have to endure it are you with me those words don't come up endurance comes up when there is great opposition when there is great pressure when everything all types of discouragements can kind of try to come your way but sinn here Jesus chose to focus not on the cross but on the joy he was an example for us so this was a purpose that had to be remember he had to go to Calvary there had to be an offering up a suffering of purchase had to be made for us so it was with the purpose in 1st Peter chapter 4 verse 1 and verse 2 pardon me verse 1 for as much than as Christ had suffered for us in the flesh no look on the scripture it's dealing with this where he went to Calvary for us he hath suffered for us in the flesh who is he suffering for for us see this is Peters dealing with this depth this suffering here that the Lord Jesus Christ he was not just suffering but this suffering that he was enduring was for us so you realize a great principle and suffering suffering is not just always about us and the molding of our character but suffering itself is also for the benefit of others arm yourselves look how Peter says arm yourselves this this word arm is just a very powerful word arm yourselves likewise with the same mind it means to have that same military expedition arm yourself with likewise with that same mind for he then hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin this is where Peters letting us know he that have died to sin when it's laid the old and old man down when in it come to God and said Lord I no longer want to walk this way I want to accept the salvation of the Lord Lord I want to receive your life and me I want to be sanctified I want to receive that life that token that assurance and this is what Peter is speaking of because remember with this suffering of the Lord Jesus he did not lose power he gained power he stood in the midst of the disciples and he says all power in heaven and earth is given unto me he gained power through his suffering oh my that he look at this that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men you help a birth of birth is a painful thing a birth does not listen a birth is not schooled into you the Holy Ghost is not schooled into anybody it's predestinated experiences with God it's not something you can teach in it it has to be something that's a call it's a yearning for life that's what it's calling for it's not calling for a display it's yearning for life because that's what the Holy Spirit is it's life you recognize if that life that same spirit if it's not moved down into the soul where there now becomes a life that beats in pulsation and harmony with Almighty God it'll fade if it's just on the spirit it'll fade like the grass fades it will fade and wither just like our bodies do but when it comes to the owner of the soul when the Holy Spirit makes its way to that of the owner of the soul it is just as good tomorrow as it was two years ago or 50 years ago because it cannot corrupt nothing is wrong with the manna it's the location that it's held in that's why we don't want to just hold this Holy Spirit in our minds yet he wants our minds we don't want to hold it just in our spirit but we want it to be held in our soul to where we can say it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and this is what Peter is bringing to us here what this suffering here there's a need for a suffering there's a need for a dying out that leads to the suffering for his namesake for he said that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God so now once this life has entered in we recognize that there is suffering according to the will of God Peter goes on to say in first Peter 5:1 the elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed Peter is lending note I'm a witness many suffered but I'm also also a witness of the glory that shall be revealed so have received of that life will read have been received of him and I recognize his suffering was for me he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for mine iniquities this is what Peter saying that realization that the sacrifice of Calvary I am a partaker of that live by a reality that I am free you see when that revelation strikes the heart of a person where you realize it's personally for me right there sin is dead it's done it's dead right there you recognize that that life it was for you you are the very reason that he gave his life for you and you recognize that he who is the judge became our attorney he went to Calvary and he took all the documents and riding and Horten it says that was against you and I and he blotted it out you know what he blotted out he didn't do away with the law he simply changed our nature so that we're no longer represented by that first Adam who sold us in the sin but we are represented by that second Adam unto righteousness we're under new representation repartee kurz of this Peter goes on to say at first Peter 2:21 for even hereunto were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth that's deceit who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not you can go ahead and raise your hand and say help me Lord when he reviled he reviled not what we're looking at when we look at the word you recognize the life of the word when it's moved inside of you you no longer desire the world the love of the world is gone it's Christ and Christ alone and this is where we desire to police and this is where that the Spirit of God within us will bring conviction and strike our hearts and rather than whether something said or not even our thinking being wrong he was reviled he reviled not again when he suffered you see this is for you and I to have strength within it a faith that when we approach the word that you and I can look at that and say that though not in the same quantity but the same quality of life is in me you realize that when you take one drop and you've heard this before you take one little bit out of this lake and you take one little teaspoon within that one teaspoon it still has the same molecular structure and all those things all the components that's within the quantity there of that Lake brother saying you would know that more than me you have those things within there like that you see the Holy Spirit that part where God subdividing himself and give us that part of his life it has within it the same quality that was in the fullness of the Godhead bodily that is why that Paul could speak to us as the elect children of God and say put on has the elect of God put on sink into and then he goes in two circumstances that come our way that will require us to lay down that other garment what's what he did this is this this scripture is just so phenomena tremendous one leadership here when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened threatened not again look what he did but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously do you understand that the Lord Jesus was not suffering as being called a drunkard he was not being called well this guy running around with he's not that that's not he was standing for the word and when he was standing for the word that's why they hated him they said that would be a man make yourself God but look here in them very even in the pressure I want you to catch this here Peter here having an insight to be able to look and even through the stages where the Lord Jesus himself is even coming to this place through pilots Hall you know there in Herod's court and so forth here he is there before them all what did he do he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously that's something there that the only thing and the greatest thing that we can ever do in the midst of suffering and that will actually give us a release from discouragement to say Lord you're the judge of all this this scriptures pertains when you know listen you know standing for the word you're not going to be patted on the back you're gonna be misunderstood I'm not saying that we make ourselves misunderstood I'm saying that even to make a stand on the word of what God has made known to you it's not going to come without suffering it comes with suffering so this is a this is an angle this is a part within that suffering who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned under the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls he goes on to this here so here we are as sheep sheep we need to be led first Peter 5 verse 8 Peter said be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour or destroy that's what he's doing whom resist how resistant steadfast in the faith so our resistance is by the power of God of the residing of God's faith in our life remember faith is not being able to explain what's going on faith is not being able to understand it and neither does faith require you to come back at the devil and throw the quote book at him and all the scriptures he's a liar you don't want to give time to a liar are you with me you come to a place in life that you recognize my time is too valuable to give you know I'm saying you can have situations where you run around the bush with a person and you finally come and say I ain't going around the bush no law we don't travel this bush we've done water pass in the ground ain't going there no more the Bible said when he came against them in the book of Jude a bringing railing accusation for him against that of Moses body the Bible didn't say that he went on this was going to be him that's going to be in that rate he said the Lord rebuke you in the Bible said it didn't bring railing accusation don't waste your time the satan already knows his outcome the purpose of him even talking to you is to try to discourage you Satan never comes to encourage you and believe me he'll use the word he knows the word yes he does he knows it he knows the quotes he knows how also to use them but I'll tell you when God gets a hold of it you watch the devil could run you down with scriptures and quotes and put it on such a way but you let a man of God surrender to the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost take a hold of that word you watch it'll bring out a total different real light about it and it actually will back the devil right up you know why it matters who's handling the word so don't try to even handle the word with your mind amen just stand there steadfast in faith I know this is simple but sometimes when it's coming you just simply have to say thank you Jesus he comes again thank you Jesus he comes again thank you Lord he's a liar whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing this was important knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your that are in the world you know what he's saying you put that devil on the run that says you're the only one this is happening to you because of you he said you need to be aware that the same afflictions they might come in different avenues but it's all working for the same purpose and this is where you need to stand that I'm not alone you know Jesus when he was going to Calvary he told him there in John 16 you're going to leave me alone but I'm not alone I'm not alone he said the father is with me I'm not alone the things that are happening you know the devil would like to make it out that you and I are odd balls the things that are happening to us oh it's so strange nobody else deals with that he's a liar he's alive that never come from God hmm nah but the grace of but the God of all Grace who has called her son to eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish you strengthen you settle you to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen now watch our Paul we'll pick this up here in 2nd Corinthians 4 verse 13 he said we have in the same spirit of faith according as it's written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you so you're going to be presented and we're going to be presented with you by the Lord Jesus after all of testing and proving is done he will raise us up with you and present us together for all things look at this in verse 15 for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving a many read down to the glory of God for which cause we faint not for that cause you see for that cause Paul is establishing here as Peter has been laying out here is a purpose in suffering remember the Prophet takes us in that in many of the messages that he'll deal with from the resurrection proof of Resurrection and fallible proof grace newsflash in history there you know so far he'll go through all that and he's dealing with to where he says they come to a place they're walking on the road of Emmaus and they look at it just like it was like a waste what happened to him how could this have happened marketers you see their understanding was not opened within that as we've spoken there they didn't see that they looked at all of a sudden it's just like what what was the purpose of this they didn't see that and if we're honest there's many times most of the time we don't understand the purpose of what's going on we don't know that the tests and trials that we go through now we have no idea of what it is preparing us for we know and have an assurance it's a molding of our character we know that it's not accidental but it is predetermined by God but we don't know where one is God preparing us for oh brother Samuel he's preparing us for the other side I agree with that but remember there are things that God when he molds and shapes you and I he can mold and shape our life for just a moment's service he can mold and shape us for something further on down the line you see sometimes there's things you know pardon me I never forget when you know I had only been teaching for my second year and so I was very close to graduating with my masters are going to be going to I want to be a principal one of the things that you know one of the reasons that I wanted to be a principal because I knew I'd get more money and money was a need what I started out right out of college with was $23,000 as a teacher you think you begin to think man I went to school all this time but I never forget a gentleman that I had as the mentoring he was a prince the principal at the building a student taught at and you know I had had people that had I had not put my name in but I'd had people that I had associated with there in the school building where I taught and then others that had known me they put my name before the superintendent over there and they had given me words of commendation regarding that so as I called up you know the principal that was there at that school and I told him I said um I said Montez I said yeah I saw I said you know I said there's the principal opening I said it's coming here at my at my building and I said I know I said um I was wondering I said would you write me a letter of recommendation he said no I didn't say no harshly so I asked him again we talked for a little bit so I said Montez I said by the way I said um do you think you'd be able to write that for me said no he said Sam he said what I've told you is this he said you've only been teaching for two years he said you need to teach at least five years before you can ever be prepared to start learning what a principal does I want to be honest with you that's stung man that's stung but you know what he was right he was right because he even threw out the time after the five years was passed and I had the different ones assistant superintendents from places that I had went and did internships with them and they're out why where's your resume at where's this and where's that I said I just at that point time then I said I just don't feel led to do it I don't see how I could do it but you see where to come down to even in the last some of the closing years before I stepped away from teaching I wanted to do it but you know I wanted to do it I could care less if they did gave me any increase in pay whatsoever I looked at the effect of being able to influence a building what I've seen is is being able to affect that culture and be able to bring out of people what's there that's what mattered I didn't matter if they paid me anymore or not what I'm trying to tell you is is that what I thought I was ready for I wasn't God knows win this was even in your jobs you're not God knows you see your tests and trials are not some erroneous things out here they'll come through the appointments where God has you the doors that he opens for you those things you experience the testings and the trying's right there because it's not God doesn't separate or compartmentalize things but God prepares you and I for what he has for us sometimes do we experience disappointment like the thing that I just mentioned for maybe you put in for a different position or whatever more but you see God knows God knows you know don't don't look at it and I pray you know you understand what I'm saying don't take it that they passed up the best one in the crop buddy they don't know what they did when they bypass me but take it that you've committed everything to the Lord and if that was God's will there wasn't enough CEOs or whatever more to keep that from you but remember God does not bring you into position and then you fail but he molds you so you're ready for that Joseph though it was prophesied of his life he wasn't ready to step on the throne but the brem tells us in prisoner Jesus Christ a very small remark that's made in there he had pride in his life and it had to be dissolved what's pride self so there had to be the prison was necessary he was necessary greater humility that what God had already declared you see God's plan for Joseph's life it couldn't be altered but God knowing the plan he had for his life all of these appointments were suffering that was molding and shaping him for what God had for his life hi this is why Paul says here for which cause we faint not watch cause it goes on to say here but though our outward man perish it does doesn't it our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day so the outward man is perishing but yet Bini inner man is being renewed refreshed our youth is being renewed as an evil the inner man is the outward man is perishing for our light affliction which is but for a moment you catch this in the scripture it's a season for a while a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal now think of how this Paul would you know declare as God revealed himself to Paul there on the road to Damascus he told him in verse 16 of Acts 9 I will show thee or show him how great things he must suffer for my namesake how many of you know there's things that we suffer sometimes it's not for his namesake it's very important to catch that and to discern that you know it's like somebody doesn't study for a test and they get an F oh I'm suffering you are suffering self-inflicted well I prayed but you didn't apply yourself you didn't study the Bible says study to show thyself approved come on now so there's times when they're suffering now that's suffering itself it's not in vain if we learn from it you might suffer and it stings awhile but you say Lord by your grace Lord I'm not gonna do that again I'm gonna be prepared you love him this reality look what this reality did for Paul Inlet Paul to suffer for others suffering on behalf of you realize that Paul suffered many things he didn't have to suffer he didn't have to suffer those beatings he didn't have to suffer and being let down in a basket he did not have to suffer that you realize Paul could have lived a godly Christian life which he did and he would not have had that suffering but his suffering the things that he suffered is because of what God had called him to carry the gospel and it was not for him it was for others Paul could have said you know what it's just easier for me I'll just stay home will facetime they didn't have him but you see it was something God put that burden in his heart not only had God revealed I want you to catch this as he's bringing this not only had God put a steadfastness within pulse with impulse heart that Paul could not be removed from the love of God Paul declares that doesn't he in Romans 8 who shall separate us right but it also he put a burden in Paul's heart for the Gentiles a burden doesn't mean you always want to do it but you do it for the love of God the love of his people that's a burden I believe with all my hearts that's what we really in our lives and I just hold it in for us as an assembly really need to pray and say God what do you want me to do it's easy for you know two or eight or just 10% of the people to carry it but God don't want 10% of the people to carry the church but it's a ask Lord what would you have me to do what's the burden Lord for my heart you see that's why many times I don't like asking for volunteers you know why that gets old you can volunteer out of feeling condemned I don't want you to volunteer how to feeling condemned it's got to be a burden on your heart because when it's a burden you do it even when you don't feel like doing it that's a burden it's easy to say I don't want to do that I want to do this this come but when it's a burden you do it and they don't have to worry and look around and say or am I so and so on and they're suppose we got this or we're there okay I know that's hard but if you say Amen it helps we want to have this is the Scriptures we're to be people of a burden when you have a burden sometimes you suffer through things you suffer through opinions you suffer through comments you sup you suffer for him you see so this purpose here my goodness without reading these scriptures let me just refer to him for time sake Peter picks it up here you can read it later in acts 2 when he is speaking on the day of Pentecost after the quickening powers come I want you to notice the contrast as he says it here in acts 2 it's contrast to what they thought walking with him when they didn't even understand remember the Bible says in mark 9 when they came down from the mountain they begin to question one another what's he mean rise again you know what it meant rise again and when they came on the road to Emmaus Luke 24 are you a stranger you don't know what's happening here these days how did the chief rulers in chief priests they took him and they crucified him and they did this but you see once the real of the revelation has struck Peters heart and they recognized this suffering was not in vain it was with a purpose then Peter could say in acts 2:23 him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God ye have taken and my wicked hands have crucified the slain I think of how Jesus declares that they're standing in pilots Hall when he said unto them he said thou could have no power over me except it be given thee from above jesus knew the appointment he he recognized this suffering he even as he recognized it so clearly he said my cup he told she told Peter from Peter with the cut off the ear shall I not take my cup that which is intended for me did he pray if it's possible but you see what he's doing he's enduring the cross a man the Prophet tells us so clearly it was there at Gethsemane is where the real death took place that's where the real death happened there is when he died there too will so think of this a vow that Peter would bring this down we recognized this was not something that just happened by chance but trials rather ARF ordained and purpose by God for our perfection and his glory being revealed and reflected in us 2nd Corinthians 4 verse 8 says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair you know what this is Paul is speaking of that dual person the inner man is renewed the outer man perishes the outer man's fading feels the pressure but the inner man has joy in the Lord persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always look at this always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body always not just sometimes always bearing it about that dying in our body who is it that gets in the way it's us there's a part of us that gets in the way you know brother Graham will always say let william branham step out of the way you hear brother Branham will open up in prayer I was loving an invisible Union he said now Lord let the man part step aside see it's recognizing this part we see that you see this is why would we look at one another we don't we're so sad for come on man you don't have no reason to be sad you might be sad as far as you're feeling the pressure in here but there's joy in your soul it's joy you can sense sometimes you sense discouragement fears can come and other but in your soul there's joy that joy is is that I don't know this is gonna come out I don't know it's gonna be unfolded here I don't know when the season is over all I know is is that he is holding my hand he's the one that's directing me through this tests and trials are not random they're not just oops you got mine how did God give you mine no they are specific that's why even in your appointments and my appointments of where we are even in this time God will take the circumstances and things that surround and they're used as tools to shape and mold and make you and I through testings through trials from your job from your schooling from all those things it is right around to mold and shape you and I all of that I trust that that's very clear I look at it from my life I'm not out in the workplace as some of you are but my testings my trying it comes with what God has called me to so it's not that I have been removed from testing and trials as a matter of fact I feel like it's been added sure but you see God uses the surroundings and you say well I can't wait to get out of this well I can't wait to get out that I can't know if God opened the door for you stand stand and let God mold and may you and shape what he has for your life he's not the author of confusion for which we live look at this for which we live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh I'm just going to read a few places here brilla Brown tells us here at the familiar reading place on the Cimmerian Church H where the Lord Jesus is looking there upon the Simonian age you know some Myrna means bitter they were suffering here the Lord Jesus as I know he said there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stim the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all and mindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people a stumbling block is what an offense they're offended by this by and by they're offended one why haven't you moved why haven't you done this I've been praying about this for a long time what a stumbling block this is too many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them think of this when brother drowned I went through the greatest travel his life Satan could not tell him there wasn't a God what he trying to tell him is he don't love you listen what he said boom BAM said he came up next to me and he said look at all the people you prayed for and they got well and he goes through and gives him an account and then he lays out the suffering the sacrifice where he would come home get changed and go out on the field as far as working come back in and you know go and pray for the sick he lays out all the suffering that he has done and then he comes around and tells him he don't love you this was something the Prophet is speaking to you and I not out of knowledge but we have read it from the scriptures this morning is not knowledge it's not theology this is life experience as a believer this is an experience what the Prophet is laying out right here is an experience from his own life where Satan himself has come to accuse him and remember all of those two outer realms was in agreement with what Satan was saying well that ain't around that faith on the inside it held it couldn't be moved what is that that's the real love of God it rose up in the midst of that time he said when I was about ready to say if that's how he's going to be but he said oh think if that typos had been there think of that new birth hadn't been there it holds you in the Missis I did the Prophet understand that in that time he did not understand it he did not understand you see sometimes it's one thing God will tell you and say it's because you failed to go out when I called you that's one thing God will tell you but for us to really come to a place to let everything go and allow him to mend our lives you think he wasn't hurtin he was even after that was spoken remember he wanted to take his life but it couldn't end it there was a purpose to be fulfilled and that experience would be an experience that he would relate to you and I and says don't ever fail to do what God has called you to do he would even relate to you or not listen to me now sometimes there's things that we even suffer after that God has made known to us our disobedience and yet we still suffer let me give you an example standing in Christ the mystery of God revealed the Prophet begins to speak about how he's feeling physically in his body what did he say he said you know he always makes it hard on me when I come back here and he said he did does that because I failed to go out in the first place I thought he got over it he did he learned but sometimes that suffering is needful to say remember remember remember Lord I want all that gone but remember remember even meet he's sitting there that day when they wanted to reopen the tax case this same message and a flash across the wall come back to Arizona and she had said to him bill I know God told you to go out there but he did he tell you to come back right see he's suffering he even suffered for decisions when he went ahead and went even though he told the Brethren in Africa on that trip were not to go here were to stay here you note that that's an example for you and I to recognize let every day be unfolded by God no go try to plan everything out let it be unfolded by God let God order our lives let me come down here what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that is what they asked in Malachi 1 verse 3 1 1 through 3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I loved you sayeth the Lord yet ye say wherein has - loved us what's not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his heritage weighs for the Dragons of the wilderness he says see they could not figure out God's love they couldn't figure it out so because they couldn't figure it out it causes him to stumble they thought that love meant no suffering that's this age you realize that it's this age love meant no suffering they thought love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened come that's a big statement no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen under salvation because God had chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did Joe that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace he's the author of peace the Bible clearly declares he's not the author of confusion God's got a purpose the purpose of his suffering the purpose of our suffering and yet the love itself love it has nothing to do we're in hostile loved us his love is that of election that he chose us and he brought us to himself that in itself is proof enough of his love that is the love of God manifested to you and I and to think of this how that Paul would speak and express this than I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his suffering the stand you know frustration is a it's a it's a bad thing it's a result of a series of unexpected events that provide no work toward a common goal in other words seems without purpose that's how the disciples looked at what had taken place they didn't understand but after Pentecost it's different they understood suffering is for a purpose it's for a purpose peace peace is the result the series of unexpected events things we haven't expected that provide work toward a common goal in other words it's with a purpose and we can look at that and say I don't know what is going to come from this but I know at the end I will be stronger I will be stronger if you focus where we focus on the test on the trial on the suffering to be very discouraging but if you focus to him who's the author of peace and committing everything into his hands I mean committing it not trying to mitigate it and do this and arrange this but commitment say lord help me to be patient and to gather out of this suffering what's needed for your glory I tell you God knows what he's doing god knows what he's doing I you know I've stood here and I've testified to you many times many times there even when I was teaching school you know what yes I was teaching but there was so many things that I needed to learn I didn't need to learn how to multiply and divide in fractions that's not what I needed to learn but there were things that God allowed from co-workers and from kids that certain ways that I would handle certain things God was there okay now how you gonna handle it you bring someone in there on a behavior plan severe behavior handicap known to throw chairs I'll just tell him sit down and you can't touch you have to make in the document accommodations god knows what he's doing things within those times like that God showed me what sweetness will do to where it'll take a heart that really is raging and that heart can come right there and you gain favor was that necessary it was for me it was for me I needed that as I need all of his continual mouldings from my life you needed that when you have people teachers and different ones you know challenged you and want to you know the poked at you for certain things I'm saying this because the things I trust that we gather from here sometimes we can be so occupied with running from what God is using two motifs now you hear me we can run from it you know God will mold us even with the people that surround us you will he molds us he'll shape us the molding and the shaping is about us dying that he might live God knows what he's doing if we can just rest within that part of it rest in him then we can have victory over discouragement we can have victory you believe that have joy in the midst of the trial and the joy the midst of the suffering I say like this Lord help me and I can learn even of things that have been self-inflicted let me learn because you said you'd make all things work together for the good you didn't say all things were good he'll make all things work together for my good according to those who are called according to his purpose we're just passing through here this time but God is in control it's with a purpose let's pray Lord Jesus Lord Jesus you are our life Lord Lord Jesus as we Lord examine our lives by the word the lordís with such clarity the Lord we can see suffering is for purpose we don't always see it or do we don't when we're in the midst of it we don't but the thing Lord that I know from my heart and perhaps it's been the same thing that struck other's hearts that I realized that the things Lord that even that I've been through went through where you've spoke to my heart has not just been for me it's been Lord at different times where I'm able to sit down and I'm able to help others not me but being able to be yielded that you can come right through that gift that you're placed in my life and Lord where it reaches out to that person or sometimes not only here but times Lord when I've sat down Lord and retreats and camps Lord with young people been able just to set their one on one Lord with things that they're facing they're dealing with Lord it's never it's always the Lord God been so tremendous how that there's things that you'll bring right along these things the Lord many times that I've went through and all my and just see how that Lord their accountants begins to change when there's things the Lord God began to be spoken that father begin to make known things that's been spoken in their mind oh god you are so merciful Lord this is not about us it's not just for us but I asked Lord God that you would help us that like Peter Peter and the rest of the disciples then seen the value of suffering they seemed that it was not something that necessarily would bring rejoicing yet they would have joy in you they would have joy in you Lord they recognize that nothing was by chance Oh father help us Lord help us Lord but knowing that God you you and your infinite wisdom you permit these things to come around [Music] what sometimes maybe here I'm speaking Lord two hearts who have that remembrance before them Lord and there wasn't something that Lord that brother branham when he would come back into town that he was grudging against but it was just a reminder and you allowed that to remain father I pray that Lord that you would help us help each and every one father that's here under the sound of my voice or God may there's one Lord that doesn't know you may they know you may they come to surrender may they come Lord to suffer to let go of their life and realize the Lord Jesus that there is a life that Lord has been given a life that Lord can take their life that is surrendered and through that life the will of God will be unfolded brannad Lord Jesus may our lives be a clearer a pure and a true reflection of your glory mold us and make us Lord Jesus that we might not in everything bring glory to you I pray that you'll touch those Lord that are sick in their body Lord God may you just move Lord for these needs some that are here some that are not with us this morning Lord because of sickness father we just pray that you'll just minister now to every need that's there Lord Brandon Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen [Music] gives me peace mister
