had in mind for us everything will be perfect amen not only will we love everybody will like everybody oh my personalities and everything else will just so come together in such a harmony I'm glad that's what the love of God is doing right now in our lives and I just think about we're singing this course right here retrieve brother Timothy today and we're on their way back and brother Timothy was just looking around the fields he's looking around the corn and Tim's they said man he said you know just the amount he said of corn that you have here and he's looking all the crops and I just got to think and I was looking at some of those combines as it was in the field and shooting out and something just struck me you know it I said you know here was somebody that planted that seed and the power within that seed let it up through all of those different stages and now I said here comes another power to move upon it and bring it into a place of harvest of where it needs to be it's God himself the whole time he who planted our life he who's maturing our life onto a full stature and then finally he says it's time to come home isn't that wonderful he knows exactly when to send the combine right by and so I believe we're living in the time of the right I believe that with all my heart water glorious expectation amen that's broken our hearts amen you know you heard the statement my wife had made mentioned to me while I was away regarding with sister Mary Ferguson and some of you know her no doubt many of you knew her and you know her and you also knew brother Karl and I just can't help but think about it I we don't know when her crossing will be but to think about it brother n tells us God sends our loved ones down to meet us she's not only gonna meet the love of her life she's gonna meet the love of her life amen the Lord Jesus Christ it's been the love of her life and also brother Karl she's gonna be united back together again amen certainly we will miss you know our sister on on this side no doubt brother Randy and then they'll miss they'll miss her the Saints over there but you know we know soon and very soon we're gonna be seeing them again amen I'm so glad that we don't sorrow as others we sorrow we grieve we missed the presence of one another but we're not sorrowing without hope we know we shall meet again amen so we just want to invite brother Timothy as shown in where the Timothy has been a few years since brother Timothy had been here and of course it's been a lot less time that he's since his last time since I was in Ghana and he reminded me of that today so we just want to invite brother Timothy shown and ask that you just the Lord I just just take our brother and you see also I want you to keep in prayer brother Giovanna Prakash he had sent Pat he asked me to greet you and to thank you for the offering that was sent his way by God's grace we were able to send I think was close to 2500 dollars in support there of everything with brother brother gia von / cash and you some of you don't know this but brother Giovanni he had come here he's come here year after year but over the past few years he had taken and applied for a green card and when he applied for a green card the reason he did it is because or maybe it was a visa green card or visa one of those my mind freaked me it just gets all scrupled with that but he every time when he was going through customs he said I just he said of just like harassment every time and he said brother Samuel he said I don't need to tell you what kind of people those people are in those places like that and he said you know he said it's just not he said something he said that I went to do to be able to try to obtain that but he says Here I am waiting and I'm waiting and I'm waiting on it he and he was when he was here with us we were sitting around the fire than one night and he said his heart each time he talked about it he just he just wept he said I feel like I'm trapped and he said would you pray with me said God will make a way back for me to get back home so with in the meantime with him he left here on October 25th and he's went back to India and right now who knows if he'll ever gain and be able to have entry back into the states again because with that since that process was lingering him leaving like that he forfeited it so let's just pray for our brother and let's pray for him he is his whole heart he said I don't want to stay here he said my heart is back in India I want to be there on the ground and working and and so let's just would you pray for brother Giovanni you know I know you've kept him in prayer before but please keep him in prayer and God knows the Lord knows how to supply all of our needs when you have situations like that you wonder and say well that just seems impossible but remember we serve of God of impossibilities so God knows and we just want to pray that God would just God brother giovanna's he's over there in order just be with him in a very special way amen and the work that's going on there as brother Timothy comes brother Timothy as he comes to us for the Timothy is an evangelist but Timothy works very much with the people that are there throughout Ghana throughout Nigeria Leo's the Togo in the different places that around burkina faso all of the difference in rounding countries and right now

we thank God for a day like this to be in the house of the Lord to be together while we have this opportunity let's do all that we can let's save the Lord let's come to church let's pray let's read the word let's read the Bible let's read the messages let's order to that which has been given to us let's read this evany from the second book of Samuel chapter 5 and we just try to say some few things from the scriptures and the message that has been given to us ii sandwich of the 5 let's read verse six and seven and the King and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites the habitants of the land which spake unto David saying except now take away the blind and the lame - I know cam in either Eden thinking David cannot come in either nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion the same is the City of David may the Lord bless the reading of his word shall please be seated so as the scripture admonishes us to do to keep encouraging our search as Peter said as long as I am in this flesh I wish to stir up your pure Minds and the Bible says let us hold fast hold it fast the face that we are fed so that it will not slip out of our hands so not that we don't know but we are reminding ourselves because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the unchangeable God with unchanging ways Alleluia and so just be God de les nevertheless Debbie took the stronghold of Zion the same is the City of David when they speak and accept nevertheless you know it's a and she say yeah maybe some issues or problems or challenges and I said never nevertheless or maybe this agreement somewhere but nobody less you know there's an issue but nevertheless nonetheless despite despite yeah despite all that all that was said odd rhythmically all these coffins nevertheless though there was issue no no it was a challenge nevertheless he just like when Elijah was to leave a lecture and he said ask what you win what do you want me to do for you and then Elijah said I want double portion of your spirit like I said you have acts something that is had Nevada less so when there is an issue there's a problem there's a challenge there is difficulties someone is nonetheless nonetheless a you are never delicious nonetheless you are not Elise you can make it hallelujah and so we thank God for the main that we read about and the screeches have told us this things are written for our example for our lineage and the scripture also made us to know will we hear about David and we hear about Elijah and we hear about Abraham and women like Sarah and like Ruth and the SS in the scriptures and the knowledge they were people of like passion as we are they were not a Jewish there were people of like passions people of challenges people of Phyllis people of witnesses just as we are nevertheless they were just like us you talk about Elijah was a man like us Abraham was a man like us oh those that are written in the scriptures there were men and women like us nevertheless resolute they had the service but that has nothing to do with what God has done for me that he foreknew in predestination and as we have been touched and though that he previously that he called and though that is God he justified and not only does before he gratified he did that for them and he has done the same thing for us mean of like passions oh praise the Lord you talk about our father Abraham I will love him with Franco so much for him yet he was a my luggage he has his fears in his worries he was the man that's some time he was scared when he was going to get her and and he church don't any people that I am your husband just telling that I am your brother he said it was Jerry that they might kill him thank God but when the spiritual powers right it is Bob Rafi the Bible said he did not stagger at the promise of God [Applause] God and that took for him God routes it is settled the accuser might have turned to accuse him but God change the password so certain had no assets again resolute the policy was well we were built by the prince of the power there once he had access to us and he pushes here and he can assess us and you do this and you do that and do this and push in there but one day come and change the access code the code was changed any Kannamma assess you he tried and it reduce and Etrigan say wrong is error he tried it again say is error and then the nested is sudden it's a lot finish you cannot assess this woman again you cannot assess this my son again you do have masses because as we change we are new creation we are different people he has not access to a Strother he doesn't rule as number he doesn't contrast another he cannot push us here and pushes that number praise be to our God nevertheless David took the stronghold the Bible tells us that when it came it became clean oh praise the Lord you know the enemy fought so much against him becoming a team because of the plan that God had for him the enemy fought him so much nevertheless he tried everything he tried to kill him everything to discourage it here and there nevertheless God's purpose for his life was not defeated Noah challenges nevertheless God using it was a man after God's own heart hey stop looking down upon yourself look unto Jesus look unto the Lord it is listen whatever anybody thinks about you it does not matter what do you think about yourself as a man thinketh in his heart that's what it is Oh what do you think about is that a Susilo a what do you think about yourself we are the redeemed of the Lord [Applause] our lives yes REE written it our testimony exchange we are nucleus you are a nucleus a David after our struggles and shafte came and added one even came to meet Juliet to fight they didn't even believe him he some brothers did not believe him that they did not believe him but never believed I can do our French through God that strength is me that God is sep the God that delivered me from the paw of the lion and of the bear the same God that brought me through yesterday that has brought me this far that's a God with that be true not matter the mountain no matter the difficulties no matter the challenges I will break heat fresh the Lord so we read about them in here listening life is a series of problems that is what life is life is a series of problems either you are a one now or you are getting out of one or you are preparing for well that is life from the youngest to the oldest everybody has challenges everybody has trash none of us is immune nobody and it is the desire of God it is the word God has planted the short summer Peter said can't it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happens to you in all the trials America ladies did he want to see our actions what you are going to do but remember the prophet of God said God as a purpose were allowed try us to come on our way he want to develop Kurata and our God is not interested in our character than our comfort this man interested in you Carlotta got you covered he wants Kurata heavy told us Kurata is not made with that suffering so the scripture said he has left a stretch a measure of suffering you have a measure you cannot run from it I cannot run from it no one can run for me because if this just is a promise is a promise when the disciples what doesn't we have left all and we are following you what are we going to get is I'll give you mothers I'll give you fathers I'll give you this help mmm persecution is a promise we don't quote it a match we don't say it much but it's a promise and remember he keeps all his promises you believe that oh he keeps all is that the promise that he will fulfill his word to the letter give the letter what am i promised about us it was fulfilling to the letter and if they promise joy peace healing services and we say Amen to it we must say amen to the promise of persecution and tribulation and trial because we believe you believer you believe ensured all things work together for good the tribulations and the class or in the joy and the poll happiness at all and the healings and I will get together for good to those that love it praise God whoa hallelujah we believe we believe on the word oh we believe all you believe amen and he said I am watching over my word and I will perform it I will keep it the professor for any promise of God to face is a God we have to bankrupt heavy he will go to em unless he will go to lemon ice you do everything everything everything to fulfill everything that yes a for he said heaven and the earth will pass away but my word will never pass away hallelujah you know what challenges and fish come and we hear people say this and people say that you have a choice to make of what to listen to because this this my voice is there remember there is the black dog and a white dog backyard it's world world world war what he said which one of them wins the battle he said the one you are listening to more the one you listen to more they want you feed more the one you attend tomorrow so what are you listening to you go what you listen you have such your life it is your life but David did something in his life he ignore all that will be spoken against him you can choose to listen to what they say or look at the things before I say about you or people laughed at me and all those things you have a free choice you can focus on your purposes or you can focus on your problems it's a choice everybody has problem so in the person where you focus which one are you feeding because when David came and he is the Jebusites then they hold Jerusalem it was this place go give to Israel and this size were on the land they were world like people fighters solo many touch they don't have anything to do with them but where they are was part of the Promised Land but God is giving you have been given a possession oh the Prophet said God could have driven the hardest Amalekites and drove them out of that place and put his right there but he didn't do it that way the promise set is chemic buses through a pipeline and pick you there and say you are a nova , what did you overcame you got something to fight for the promise said is not easy to go to hell instead to go to hell you have to fight they said if it's not easy you don't go to an easily you've got to fight so where to go that you suggest like somebody driving on the road and then and Donna and though you break the traffic rules when the lysis stop you don't stop he said what is it you are fighting your way to this it's in the same way God give the pasta go give the prophet god sings the songs he said their aims is in the word we preach and you bypass all you ignore all he said what you are doing you are fighting your way to hell if you gotta fight to go to here what am I going to have you must I be coming to heaven or framily better peace this I must fight if I must rain increase my courage Lord so here then he came to Jerusalem he has been another killing and he just look at that lesson in success no this is part of the promise of God and he set his eye towards Jerusalem the Jebusites where day but when God gave the promise he gave the land to do with everything that is that it is your possession it is for us and one listen listen and Jerusalem it was under here and you know somebody on the hill yes advantage and so did you precise said the lead and the cripples these have much confidence they had the lead and the creeper said you cannot give it to me you can come here don't waste the time minutes tried and they failed many have tried and they failed and so what are you coming to do you cannot make it but remember this also the weapons of our warfare are not Anna they are mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds whatever as a street in your family in your life you can pull it down and so Lord is a place that is fortified it's a power base but we have been given a weapon to fight and break it down the project of God said go give us this weapon Capri and he said Prada is more powerful than the atomic bomb you believe that is essential whether you believe it or you don't believe it he said prayer is more powerful than the atomic bomb so he gave us each word he gave us a weapon the Prophet taught us and he said in the beginning when God knew there'll be an enemy he equipped his people with the best weapon you don't need to improve upon that weapon the weapon that was given to Adam in the beginning is the same weapon that have been given to us so does love the Belfort discovered you and destroy your confidence in the word of the Lord [Music] and so then it came to Jerusalem and and and and the jebusites were there and they say hey don't ride the cripples and the lives and don't ride you commit it thinking that then it could not come either nevertheless nevertheless get me to destroy hold them in person again Devon fought against them he found a way he told his soldiers if you cannot come up you go through the gutters find a way find a way to overcome the problem must be solved there is no mounting that we cannot lie that is not enemy that we cannot defeat that is not temptation that we cannot imagine the professor said no Joe Lewis can stand the church no power love us so we must know who we are because our power lies in recognizing in opposition and being at your post he said even if you added that to the last one the diversity under your feet hey it is not just for us we have to accept the word how we know the mysteries and the DS and that and that yes when we it will recognize we must add brother Brant preach a message hearing recognizing and Artie you gotta fight you got hold the world you gotta push sell it nevertheless debit to this world he fought for it anybody he stood here mind heaps good offense a wall of Ronnie's he dislodged them he pushed them out of that place he took possession he took control they thought he could not but he did it and you can do it listening don't you want your own nevertheless it was written in the bagua fee of David nevertheless I wanted to be my own record too no matter what I flesh I wanted to be said nevertheless human young woman mothers and fathers sense of God it is our day it is our time to add our own never delays praise be to God no wonder you know you know today this this celebrate Jerusalem day Israel today to celebrate Jerusalem day when the city you know was reunited the old city and the new city when they took in the fought for it they fought for it and to today blaster fighting Israel in the natural is this fighting today and Israel in the spiritual might fight today until all that has been spoken about us all that I've been given to us will possess it never wish you remember that always there will be challenges the other challenges everyone every day as we are generally as we are journey as we are traveling as we are working this way there will be challenges a mossad you want to do something good you want to move the obits and barriers trial and this the children of Israel in the days of Mahima they wanted him I came for the world to review the world they had challenges the enemies of Israel came against them and begin to scuffle what are these people doing what they cannot stand but they did it some balance Tropius different they came against them I
