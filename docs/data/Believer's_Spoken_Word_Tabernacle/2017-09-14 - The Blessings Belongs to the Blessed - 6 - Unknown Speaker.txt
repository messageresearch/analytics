there Moses had a promise I'll bring you back to this mountain amen that that's an absolute Moses didn't know how he was going to get through that Red Sea he was crying just like us he didn't know how

tonight Lord we pray Lord we love you we thank you Lord we give ourselves to you Lord in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let's read in Genesis chapter 28 tonight we'll read a few vers of scripture then we'll just let you have your seats in Genesis chapter 28 verse one and Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan arise and go to pandam to the house of bethu thy mother's father and take thee a wife from thin of the daughters of laan thy mother's brother and God Almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a multitude of people and give thee The Blessing of Abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which God gave unto Abraham and Isaac sent away Jacob and he went to padam onto laan son of bethuel the Syrian the brother of Rebecca Jacob's and Esau's mother may God bless the reading of his word bless as you're being seated you know sometimes you we come into times and you as I've said often to you sometimes the journey the way that God will take us into the scripture I I don't desire even though there might be wonderful things within the word I I don't desire to labor in an area that God would desire us to move on because it's true every little point we could labor on and there is so much within each within in each point in every verse but what's significant and what's important is that God we allow God just to be able to give to us what he knows that we have need of at this appointed time and when I I look at this and you know we've been just thinking of this of being led beside the Still Waters and there's just been many things over even through the year and just looking at how God would so lay in just the real truth and reality of of what real true election is and then to be able to look into the word and be able to to see ourselves in the word and then to see how that God would direct us here with looking at at Jacob's life and you know brother Bram will make the statement throughout the message in the earlier parts and the Masterpiece as well and he said anybody reads about Jacob you can see God's grace you know it's God's grace and when thing that when we look at the grace of God grace is is that which is not merited by anything it's not anything that could ever be merited but Grace itself is is that which God he provides that that for us that we might know what is the acceptable way and how that we might walk pleasing to him that's Grace that's the grace of God provided but then to receive that Grace is another thing because to receive receive it is then to become a partaker of it and then to become an expression or a trophy of that Grace because it's to let God's grace have its work in our life and we know that the grace of God is Not powerless it contrary to what is been painted not just in this day but you know in time but you know the the scripture picked this up right away in Jude chapter 1 when it said that there were certain men who crept in unaware it didn't say Brethren crept in it said certain men crept in unawares and it said it turned the grace turning the grace of God into lasciviousness into where it be where the God's grace is no longer something that is pure and righteous and holy and and has power in it but rather it's just something that is just maybe looked at as just extended that you can continue on in the way that you are and God doesn't see you and God just loves you but if God loves me so much surely he will won't leave me in the condition I'm in surely he'll deal with my heart and draw me to a place to where that I can come into that place that he is longing for me and that's what God's love does God's love reaches out to me to speak to me and then when his love has come to a place to where his love can do no more his grace steps in because Grace is that part of God's love that moves forth to bring into manifestation what love has called for I tell you friends there's no way for us to come into expression outside of God's grace reaching down in our life and to think of it how in this hour where it it speaks that in this time where they showed the candlesticks there you know to to that of uh there when Zachariah and is asking Zachariah what do you see Zachariah and Zachariah said I don't know you tell me what I'm looking at uh you know and that's the thing that I believe that in this hour that God has come to do is to speak to a group of people who don't want to try to take their own idea about things but they're willing to say Lord you tell me what I'm looking at you tell me and help me to see what I'm seeing I I see this these candlesticks I I see this but you know us what are these things and God begins to speak to Zachariah and one thing that we can see within it is God is letting Zachariah know that all things that are to be done and will be done from the very laying of the foundation stone to the bringing of the Cornerstone it is entirely a work of God himself it's Sovereign work of almighty God it's God moving everything right into its place right in its time it's not something where God is dragging you and I or pushing you and I but it's God by his spirit that moves Upon Our Life to move you and I into the place and position that he has desired and intended for us us to be I tell you it's no chance it was no happen stance it's nothing that just by chance that we're here tonight we're here tonight being being made known and ordained by God that God is declaring his mind to you and I over and over God lets you and I know you were in my thinking you were always a part of me it's God confirming his word friends we can't hear the word and the word come forth and not confirm that the preacher of the word it confirms it over and over of where we were who we are and where we are going that's the ministry of the word because the ministry of the holy spirit always works in continuity with God's word in election always so it's God it's God moving everything I I I look at things so much down through the word and and you see things that even it's just uh you know as I begin to look at it here of how that when there that second world war how it stopped within a certain time you know and to think of how everything nobody can explain it but it was God who stopped it it was God who arranged it let me tell you something missiles and bombs and tanks and governments there is nothing that can stand before the presence of almighty God there's nothing can move in upon his children but God already is aware of it like the prophet said about that great eag that was was looking at its youngans that was down there said if a coyote would start toward one of them he would swoop down and fog it to death what is it it's God who's got his eye upon all things he knows what he's doing when he lets a trial come your way when he lets the test come your way when you might be in thick grass and Tall Grass and you can't see what's coming on next but he is watching over you he hadn't lost track of you you might have lost sight of him but he ain't lost sight of you he knows exactly where you're at he knows exactly what you're going through and it's no coincidence it's not an accident it's not a mistake but God himself allows the things that will permits it to come by his per his his will to test us to try us you say what about even our own bad choices and our own bad decisions if we can submit it to the Lord then God can make come to past his word where he'll make all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord and are called according to his purpose not that everything is good but it can work to the good is that right so we have this confidence and when we're looking at this within Jacob's life I want to just just deal with this just a few moments here in Jacob's life and and just seeing how that God has given such a a charge here to to Jacob from Isaac how that you know it was here where Jacob is led to go and and get all the preparations if I can just save time all the preparations he's LED of what to do and to bring this the blessing is be getting ready to be pronounced and so as here Jacob is ready he's realizing my time of departure is in hand it's time to to to pronounce this blessing if I could say it like this Jacob or Isaac pardon me Isaac is letting it be known the evening time of my message is here it's time to pronounce the blessing it's time for the blessing to be pronounced so here he's realizing and in the word itself is going to go forth within the season and the time and here Rebecca she catches it we know and and she begins to make this known to Jacob and Jacob comes under that pronouncing of the blessing and when he comes under the pronouncing of the blessing of the birthright we know that even though that he has paid and you know he or he has acquired that of the birthright with Esau you know uh despising it thinking little of it and when that that Jacob yet within his life he's come under the pronouncing of it he's heard the blessing of it but yet he's not been fully quickened yet he's had the blessing put over his life he's had a hunger for the blessing but yet he's not been fully quickened yet are you with me he's heard the gospel of his salvation but you know just hearing it is not the quickening knowing it's the truth is not the quickening but it must be that something resonates first to declare this is truth because what is truth then you walk in that and toward that which is truth to do what become one with it so the pronouncing of the blessing and I I just feel constrained of the Lord to really really move and deal with these things because you know many times the prophet said it like this he said in the message come follow me in 1963 when he's preaching to the graduates there he said you know he says you can come along and he's talking about the Rich Young Ruler he said and you can learn this message this is his words you can learn this message he said but that is not the person of eternal life you have to receive the person of eternal life what the message is itself it is god making his promise his Covenant that he has reserved and has making it known to his children and when God makes that promise known it's there for the believer to become one with that promise because before that time the word can be disputed the word can be questioned is that right they can say this has passed and this has passed and that's for this and that's for that but when God moves on the scene God doesn't move on the scene to make himself known to everybody the light doesn't come to Quicken the rocks it doesn't come to Quicken the dirt the light comes to Quicken the seed and that's why the promised word when it comes it's god making his word known the Covenant that God has made and God is making that word live and real real that the people of God in that hour know that God is alive and God is real and I can have that same experience amen hallelujah this is a working of where in Jacob's life we see that how that within it you know Isaac has given Jacob a charge and he tells he tells uh uh you know Jacob what to do in the very first verse he tells him that he's got to leave this place and he's got to go find a wife but not just anywhere he's got to go to a certain land now that wife's not going to come to him he's got to go to her you see the uniting he's got to put forth an effort to be United so here the word has come to to deal with his life the word now notice watch out watch how everything changes now remember Isaac was crying out when Esau walked in and said oh thy brother you know he has supplanted thee and and and and every thing but notice the word is no longer calling Jacob in an Essence deceiver I hope you're with me now because even though Jacob needs a real change of nature but the word has got to speak to him and call him up high so the word it comes and listen friends as the word is coming when that presence of almighty God comes down it makes it brings conviction in lives it convicts you and I it deals with lives it deals with hearts it causes the children of God to say I'm not where I need to be I need to rise higher I need to move deeper I need to rise up the word does that what good does it do just to focus upon the situation it's one thing to point out the sin but God just don't point out your sin and leave you there he points you to the kill he points you to the remedy there's always that room for repentance how big the space is I don't know but there's always a space of repentance is that right so to find how that Isaac you know he sends Jacob away there's a charge and you know it's important we have to do what the word says do you know the think of it there's a a contrast I want you to look at here just a little bit a contrast between Esau and Jacob here the scripture goes on to say in verse six when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away Pam to take him away from th and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to pandam notice this this is this is depicting and showing here that God how he's dealing with Jacob as we said moments ago and you know whereas Isaac was at one time speaking oh my what has happened here what has taken place but we recognize there's there had to been to where that Isaac has moved in a place to recognize there's something great here that's taking place you know it's just like that you know when Jacob remember as we talked the other other Thursday night about the hands being crossed the covenants belong to the Jews all of those things belong to the Jews but they were crossed and through the cross and came upon the Gentiles and when Jacob was was speaking and Joseph went to correct him but Jacob said I can't do nothing but what God has had me to do Jacob went to bless him like this but God moved on the scene w if it hadn't been for God move on the scene and a cross come in if it hadn't been God move on the scene and come and stand in the breach amen when it seemed like all hope was lost and John was crying there ain't nobody but all of a sudden John weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah he has prevailed what is it that call refers him back to the atonement that is made for you amen not just in the Redemption of your soul but the taking of that book it leads to the very Redemption of your body amen is being orchestrated by almighty God are you with me tonight I believe I'm preaching to Believers tonight amen where there was a strong angel that was crying there in Revelations 5 oh if there is one worthy let him come or forever hold his peace amen but there was one who stepped on the Forefront amen it was a son of man revealing the son of man amen as he stood there he said it wasn't what I knew it wasn't me it was him am man it isn't my message it's his message glory be to God all friends to think of it the hour that we are living in when every one of these promises God make it everything so rich and precious to you and I to energize our faith why does he come like this to lift you and I he knows the conditions you're in he knows the circumstances but it's God providing the lift that you need glory be to God here it is the scripture says of how that Jacob I like how this this is worded here it just pressed on my heart so deeply that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother I tell you I've read this I've read through these chapters over and over and over and over I've had fits B on the airplanes when I've been reading it I look at at things putting things down studying and so oh my it's just so precious to see God's Divine oversight within it all it's God orchestrating it and how that here this depiction where Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to p uh to to pad around notice this he obeyed this word obeyed I want you to catch this here this word you can't you can't obey something if you can't hear it how can you obey what you can't hear is that right but to be able to hear to give heed to it to consent agree to listen to to yield to to obey to be obedient that ability to be able to hear is a very very precious thing now remember in the scriptures in in the Book of Matthew Matthew 13 it speaks as well as in the in Luke as well of the sewing of the seed that the son of man that seed which he has sown and how that he would come sewing that seed and how that the seed some of it would fall among Thorns some would fall among the Wayside that right some would also fall on Stony ground but there was others that fell on good ground now I want you to catch this the ground itself it was not ground that did something as far as within itself to make itself acceptable this is talking about the dep and the prophet picks it up like this in the Rapture he picks it up like this in works as Faith expressed brother B says see it was ground that was pre-prepared preprepared why it was predestinated ground it was ground that was already prepared what ground are we talking about we're talking about a bedding ground a womb that was ordained to be able to receive the seed all four heard it so we're talking about a a a a different depth of hearing here we're not talking about a hearing that where it's able just to hear something but we're talking about a hearing that translates into an understanding we're talking about an understanding here that translates into a change of life is that right it's not something that anybody can school into you is that right but it's predestinated our experiences are not schooled into US you're not taught into it it is predestinated does the word have to be preached sure the word has to be preached does leadership have to be given sure it has to be given but we're not being schooled into something gold is where you learn it amen but when it's by experience it will you are ordained for this moment to receive the word of God in this hour you ordained to express Jesus Christ in this hour amen that's exactly the truth think of how you know the prophet he deals with them very words I've just given to you in Satan's Eden he goes on to say how he says you know it's not just hearing hearing as far as somebody hearing the word he said because somebody can hear it and remain a prostitute they can hear remain a drunken he said you can hear them and you could ask them do you believe that's a truth they said sure it's a truth he said but that ain't the hearing we're talking about the word he that heareth is he that understandeth and when he understandeth it's when a change it leads that person to a real transformation in their life because it is the very mystery of their life what it is that has been moving upon their life and they may not recogniz and didn't recognize it all of these times but God himself begins to make his word known and the Mystery of God begins to break over our lives and as the mystery of God is breaking over our life The Secret of our life begins to unfold the more Abraham walked the more his the more the seals of Abraham's life were unfolded oh yes and Abraham's life was a church ages and Abraham's life was the seals in your life is a church ages in your life is seals you with me it's taking off it's peeling back the seals what is what do the seals reveal inside of it that's where the Prophet said he is those seals and under and in the midst of your life as he's revealing un covering little by little and removing away what are we coming to see Christ in you the hope of glory my goodness we keep preaching like this so seem like there are no battles but you know what this is what gives you strength God ain't going to take away our battles he just wants to give us courage and strength to go face them because in that he's glorified yes sir I strength is not in our ability our memorization and how all our strength David said the Lord is the strength of my life he is my salvation Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah that ain't just talking about when you gave your life to the Lord every day he is our Salvation when you are down and see seems like you're lower than the padding in the carpet he is your salvation he comes and ministers to you he comes and speaks to you what is he the Lord is my salvation glory be to God he is my salvation my mind this ability to hear so the word itself the word it's got to come forth it's got to be spoken and ministered I want to just look at this thought because Jacob would not have known what to do except God would speak to him is that right now notice how that Paul picks this up very familiar passage of scripture to us in verse 12 for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then now watch this how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed how can they call on him if they have not believed in him how could Jacob go to this land if he doesn't know about it to go there you with me he knows where his mama come from but you see he needs Direction let him know you need to go there you know what it is it's God providing for you and I let me say it like this when you came along upon this Earth your mama and daddy were not scrambling around to find Pampers or to find whatever kind of bird eye or diapers or whatever you wore or milk bottles or or bassinets or cribs or whatever more you say what are you getting at they were expecting your arrival yes yes sir they knew your arrival was coming and the closer it got they kept on making preparation for your arrival and God knew that you and I would be here in this hour and God has made preparation for this hour amen there is no test or no trial or nothing where that how that Paul said think it not stranger Peter said that Paul said there is no nothing that has come your way amen but God has permitted it God's already made preparation amen so to think how that God himself making a preparation for you and I to come forth he prepared that there would be a word in this hour that you and I were fitted to that word hallelujah amen where it was something in us that the threads in US match the nut of the hour Hallelujah it was ordained by God you didn't put the threads on yourself I didn't put the threads on myself but the threads were already there and here God's nut came in this hour and the threads that were there that word that was being preached it's something that resonates in our heart like the prophet said that little eagle and when he screamed out he said that little Eagle said it was like a glove that fit my hand why the threads match some of you Brothers know what I mean you go into a store and you're trying to find a screw you know a screw's falling out of a door screw's falling out of a sweeper and you've got the ultimate task of going and trying to find the exact same one you've got to try to find how it's threaded my Lord sometimes you go and look and you know and sometimes everybody says more is better is it really I stood there in Lowe's and Home Depot and I'm looking around where's the first guy with an orange or blue one I don't like just killing time I I to me I want to get moving there's time is time is of the essence here but you're looking around for things of how to thread that in God already has ordained all of that yes sir amen now notice this how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard that's why friends in this hour the great accountability in this hour is us who hear this word he's already been turned out of the church world the great accountability is among us there they have put him out remember as we looked at it a couple weeks ago they didn't put out a Doctrine he said behold I stand at the door and knock they put out the person of the word the lifegiver they put him out of their midst they put out him who pronounces the blessing and he who is the blesser they put him out only he can do that that's what Isaac told Jacob even after the blessing he said God Almighty bless thee it's only God by one Spirit we're baptized into one body only God can do that that's why it's important friends the word that we are hearing and it's not just something that God I want you to understand this not just something that bringing fear no no no no no it ought to be a rejoicing in our hearts when you know from within that you've been set free by God's Amazing Grace when your life has been quickened it's matching up with the word and lining up of the word you've got that peace on the inside the love of God is moving in your heart that's a great joy in this hour that's something that is God's grace that we did not provide that God provided that to tell you the truth when the word itself comes it's against our own makeup that's exactly the right it's not it's not with our makeup but that's why we must have him to come down and get in the middle be the will in the middle of the will amen so that it's no longer our temperament under the control of the first birth but now it becomes surrendered under the new birth is that right God never made Paul like Peter Peter like James he left him the way they were because he had a work for them to do that's not an excuse for god well you know Brother Sam you've got to accept me the way I am you know how I am brother Samuel you know no no no no no we're not talking about that well we're not talking about saying well you know this know how it is no no it's God deals with each of Our Lives it's him molding us him shaping us him making us but you know what the beauty of it is God don't want everybody like me and he don't want me like you thank God you should have said praise the Lord to that before and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher how shall now watch this how shall they preach EX except they be sent now there's a lot of preachers Paul identified Satan had ministers is that right so it's not just preaching but it is that which has been sent by God remember when Jesus he said in John 6 as the living father has sent me and I live by him so you shall live by me also as he has he has sent me so send I you he commissioned them go ye therefore and preach the gospel right but he let him know this is your charge this is the charge Isaac charged Jacob but you need to receive him who is the preacher he who is the sender why because he knows where his children are are glory be to God oh Hallelujah don't you love him amen that's why Peter goes on I love how Peter puts it he said that we preach this gospel with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven not not to be preached any other way it must be preached by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven listen friends there's there's people that can be very anointed we're not just talking about anointed preaching here we're talking about men of God that have met God face to face in the sacred SS of God's grace and have met God personally in the promise of that hour why because they if they're proclaiming that word and preaching that gospel they have to have been somewhere met somebody and know the very Authority and power of who they met because when that gospel is preached in that reality from the heart then it's an able minister of the gospel Hallelujah as Paul said the Revelation ye are that epistle that's written in our heart what was Paul saying I'm not preaching something different than what is written in me what's written in me is exactly what's issuing forth an able minister of the Gospel so notice he goes on to say but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who hath believed our rep report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so once again it needs and requires that hearing of the Lord notice this we know that we need Faith within it in the message I perceived that thou art a prophet brother B says you couldn't heal him no other man could heal him they have to accept their healing as God's God's free gift to them he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed then you see there's nothing at all that you can do towards salvation or Divine Healing it's the individual's faith in Christ now to bring up this faith in Christ there's ministers that's the most important thing of the day is a God good godsent preacher once again not just a preacher a good godsent preacher not just a preacher a good godsent preacher I admire them not just admire preachers a good godsent preacher is that right well as a preacher I admire good godsent Christians right not just church members not just people who come to church but you admire people there is a quality within the life receiving that word and they walk with a fervency in that word they take that word hold on to that word their life is not dependent as far as their Victory is not dependent upon the pastor how deep he preaches or how how how you know excited he gets or how settled he is but their Victory is dependent upon Jesus Christ it's Christ that set before and it's Christ that they seek to be unveiled in and their gift is far beyond anything could be done in anything else as a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of God now let's look at this here just a moment here in time here I have just a few moments in Galatians 3 you see what God is is doing even after the dispensation where the Lamb of God has come on them seene they shed his blood he's paid the price sended back up into glory and now as he steps forth in his mediatorial work as high priest sends back the Holy Ghost and they begin to go forth and declare the gospel of the atonement they begin to go and preach the good news well you know they weren't the first preachers God himself is a preacher you believe that God is a preacher Galatians chapter 3 even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preached before for the gospel unto Abraham God preached the gospel preached it unto who unto Abraham did he preach it unto lot no he preached it unto Abram lot heard it but it didn't have a hold upon lot's life for lot it was secondarily he was following along with Abram but for Abraham it had something within his heart that meant something something to him is that right so God preached before the gospel unto Abram saying in thee shall All Nations be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham Hallelujah now think of this here just a moment think of how that down through the scriptures here in the book of Acts how that when philli here he is preaching in Sam Mara I'm just going to I'm not going to read from him I'm just going to skip but paraphrase him but how that Phillip he's caught by the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord tells him that you know he catches him away and he tells him that he's to arise and go down south let me just go ahead and read it verse 26 the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip saying arise and go toward the South unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is Desert I was going to go right by that but this is what I want you to catch in here faith is not knowing every step of the way faith is knowing him who's speaking to you amen Philip didn't say hey where what's going to happen after this where do I go exactly God did not give him just like putting a point on a GPS map drop a pen right there no he told him go it down from jerus unto Gaza which is Desert where at in Gaza he didn't have to worry all he had to do was surrender to God and God would take him the direction that God was calling him to go God was in control God was directing him you know how God could do that because he was surrendered you realize friends many things that God brings you and I through tests trials situations sometimes we're in the mid of things we were almost like a basket case we're nervous what do I do here what do I do there what do I do there but you know what God brings us into these places so that he might show his grace to you and I that not not for us to say oh brother say I don't want to get back to that place again I don't want to be nervous do you think I want to be nervous every time every time before I preach sometimes I'm so nervous before I preach I feel like my stomach's all turned upside down I Lord I don't know how you're going to bring all this together I don't know how you're going to put it all together and you got all sorts of thoughts coming your way thoughts thoughts coming here thoughts coming there thank God for the grace of God to be able to discern those thoughts oh yes sir Satan firing in thoughts people don't want to hear that people already heard that people already come along this line I know that ain't of God I know that for sure I know that that's not of God it's of one of two it's either from this flesh right here or it's from the devil oh yes sir but in the midst of all of that what does God bring us to places that you and I learn to rest and trust him it would have been easy if there would have been no Red Sea so we think it would have been easy if there wouldn't have been any Giants so we think but you see what the Red Sea did and what the Giants did is Manifest the faith that was there and allow the faith to be able to grow in the midst of those circumstances so what's God doing God is Not the author of confusion God himself allows and arranges that you and I come into places that we don't even know what to do even to where the pages on the Bible might get stuck together and a Catholic priest comes up and says here be be still my son the Lord is doing something glory be to God what is it God is directing we find that H all of a sudden how that Philip is able to hear that there is a unic that's reading a scripture evidently he didn't have his earbuds in you know evidently this guy was reading I don't think he was yelling him out see brother Samuel what was it God needed to direct Phillip so when Phillip would begin to hear this reading of the scripture the spirit of God said told him go and join thyself to this Chariot oh my what kind of cellular communication is this he joins himself to this Chariot and he begins to hear the reading of Isaiah oh my you can imagine what it did die to Philip's heart the same thing it does to your heart and my heart it's something begins to rise up because here is Philip one who's holding the promise of what Isaiah spoke about but now it's come into manifestation and the scripture says that when the mic notice the unic asked Phillip who's the prophet talking about now here he had the word is that right but the seed life itself travels through the body is that right the prophet taught us that we see it through the scriptures in spoken word's Original Seed brother Bram tells us that you cannot serve god without receiving the servants whom he sends is that right he sends by what his word his Revelation is that true God sends his word sends the light of the age and the prophet tells us in the saman age that that same pattern that Paul had picked up that the Lord Jesus had laid out that same pattern applies in every age that that Revelation the light of the age that Covenant being made known for the age It Goes Forth but then there are others who pick up that and are ordained to be able to preach that now listen to me now not just preach it here but you're called to preach as well that's right oh brother Samuel now you know been know out man some of the sisters love to find this out man oh man I can burn my Facebook up now no no no no that's what we're talking about we're talking about preaching with your life preaching with your life preaching with your life amen think of how that God I want you to think of this look this up when you get home of how that God thought so much of Aquilla and Priscilla and they were known to be helpers in the gospel so much was the testimony of Jesus Christ in their life that Paul when he would write to other Saints he would include their names and greet the saints of God even with their names included why because the testimony in their life was so radiating and effectual that should be surprising to you and I there's many people that'll never receive a message book there's people that'll never stand still for God sent a prophit but they will stand still and take notice when they see your life because they can't see or put that together you know what that is that's the manifestation the word that the prophet has spoke now made flesh yes sir oh my you love him how do I what what what is the Prophet saying here and the scripture begins to tell us here of how that Phillip he he be to open his mouth in verse 35 then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus isn't it amazing he was looking at this scripture but Phillip anointed and filled with the spirit of God had met that very Christ and knew that that part of the word that he had met God in that part of the word what did he do he began not just to read the word he began to preach that word oh friends don't we see reading it it's not just reading the word it's preaching the word it's preaching it preaching it what's preaching it it's the divine inspiration of God coming upon the word and as I said That's you living it as well you and me both notice here and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the unic said is't this something Philip never had to say ain't that nice view over there how you like that water the unic said what was it the word was touching his heart the word was dealing in his heart and as Phillip was preaching in what Phillip was preaching was that making known of the Messiah the Lamb of God and letting it be known that the life of the atonement has come forth and has been poured out in this hour and what's he do because the way must be open David said thou Wilt show me the path of life and here it is God revealing his way in that hour and it's dealing with the unic all the while here is a lamb nature that's hidden down in there threaded to that prophecy it begins to rise hey here's water Stop The Chariot here's water what's hindering us what's he doing what the word has said do he's doing it Jacob go to panoram I'm going I'm going I'm on my way do what the word says do and notice how that God put it forth that after this God caught away Phillip and the unic went on his way one thing that we know is that for sure that God did a complete work of what was needed in the unix's life is that right didn't mean that that unic didn't go and and get into you get under a pastor and so for that's not what I'm saying here what I'm saying is is that God himself did a complete work within this man's life amen now notice how that even when you see it in the scriptures there of how that that God would place it even in Cornelius and you're familiar with this portion of the word of how that Peter here you know you would look at it and think man Peter God ought to be send in somebody else down there this guy is really troubled but Peter God visits him while he's visiting Cornelius you see God works on both ends it's just like before a service God works on both ends it must be God work on both ends it's God coming to minister to the very needs in our lives and here is Cornelius I think of how that he acknowledges it and he says in verse 30 four days ago I was fasting until this hour at the ninth hour I prayed in my house and behold a man stood Before Me In Bright clothing and said Cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine arms are had in remembrance in the sight of God see there was a longing in cornelius's heart it was a longing that was already there but it was coming forth why as a deep calleth unto the Deep after noise of thy water spot if there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond when you're Desiring more of God it shows there's more of God for you absolutely and hear when he sends for him he says Corel and sin I said therefore he said sin therefore here's what the angel said send therefore to japa and call thither Simon whose surname is Peter see God never intended the angels to preach the gospel God never intended that he is lodged in the house of one Simon a Tanner by the seaside who when he cometh shall speak unto thee now the angel already knew what he was going to say but the angel was there to tell him go down there sin and get this man down here go get him and when he comes he'll tell you what you need to hear what is it God's way notice how such direct such Precision you believe God is still the same I believe that I believe God I know him to be the same I know him to be punctual just like that yes he he's still the same God that directs just like that Cornelius wasn't a Prophet come on somebody Cornelius wasn't the prophet he was a man that loved God a man that God could speak to that he didn't think he was going crazy come on somebody how many times that the prophet you heard the Prophet The Prophet himself no matter how many times he heard the voice there are times that the prophet even on his way down to Israel that time he stepped in the hanger and said Lord is that you why because he wanted to be sure there was something in him that wasn't William bradam there was something in him you can't go there now that's not your place glory be to God oh friends I believe with all of my heart that that is God's desire for our lives is that our own choice is so surrendered to him to where his will his Redemption is so reflected through our lives over and over no wonder Paul said that I Die daily why it's dying getting rid of Samuel's Choice Samuel's way you can put your name in there too feel free to immediately notice what Cornelius said I called for a fast we prayed about this no immed immediately you know what it was Oh Glory this was a man who was in contact with God yet he didn't have the promise in his life but it was a Desiring to come forth an expression it was just like that within Abraham's life the prophet said when Abraham saw those three men coming down he said he recognized because Abraham was spiritual he recognized God is here and he said he ran in the tent grabbed Sarah by the hand went out there in the flock and he got a calf he said it's time to end entertain the Lord why he had been in contact with God fellowship with God you want to hear from God get in fellowship with God stay in fellowship with God the things of this Earth are here to try to take away your time listen friends there's many of us who sit in this room that all kinds of strains in our life there's some of us sitting right here and whatever more tonight they're the kind of people that you start on something you've got to get it done you've got to get it done it don't matter if you're working at 4:00 in the morning you got to get it done but listen friends listen listen listen be mindful of the Lord yes sir yes sir what's God reward you what's God reward you y'all believe that don't you you believe that watch God rewards you make place for him you might be tempted you might be tempted the first thing in the morning that you're the kind of person you're tempted and before you know it your whole day is rolled away then set yourself and say Lord I'm starting right here brother Samuel that'd be that'd be awful hard for me that'd be awful hard for me now maybe you're not a morning person but what I'm just trying to tell you you might say I'm not a morning person but make sure sure that you're giving your time to the Lord because it's so easy for the toils and the tasks of this day to all of a sudden you get to the evening time and you think Lord have mercy how did I get here how did I get here let's stand immediately therefore I sent to thee and thou Hast well done that thou art come now therefore are we all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God Peter goes on to speak of the atonement he begins to speak of this the Holy Spirit comes in right through the word and falls right upon him as they heard the word there was something about it that resonated in their heart within the the preaching of the word they had come into a place to where God himself recognized their faith and sealed them why because the word itself holds leadership holds Direction it's life even when Paul came to the upper coast of Ephesus he comes into that place and he asks him have have you received the Holy Ghost now these are good clean people good clean living people but he said if you received the Holy Ghost s you believed they said we ain't never heard whether there be any Holy Ghost he said how was you baptized see Paul knew wait wait wait there's something wrong how were you baptized see he's starting with first things first Paul didn't ask him if they knew this or knew that he started with first things first you see friends it's we're living in a time and an hour people know Mysteries they have a lot of knowledge but it's got to come first things first we you never can get away from the Simplicity of a surrendered heart that's what makes the doctrine come off the shelf and become bark on your tree become protection around your life amen that's God's desire so he addresses that but think of how that God would speak even to to Jacob I want to I want to read just a a statement here to you they might brother Brian it's on things that are to be it's right under Isaiah 28 there it's on down quite a ways but I want to read this to you and leave this with you tonight different things I've referred to out of things that are to be when brother brand memories talking about the preparation that's been made for you in every age God has sent forth his word and that word has been building in our life God sent forth his word here the just shall live by faith that was a part Sovereign work of the Holy Spirit reaching out to minister that by believing you can be justified then here come here comes God coming on the scene and pointing out that there's a blood that cleanses see it's letting them know where where all Creeds had covered over the blood but it it brings the blood back in view the blood comes back into view there's a blood that sanctifies you Hallelujah cleanses you puts you aside and ready for service then the spirit of God comes and moves again and lets it be known that there's a a real true baptism of the Holy Ghost to let it be known that there's a there's a real finishing work that leads to full maturity is that right so in every in every age God himself when he speaks in every age every seed that God had for every age had within it the attributes of his divine nature that was to be expressed in that hour so God provides a word to do what release the virtues that that are laying dormant in your life every Apple every leaf you don't grow to become more apples more apples and more leaves and I got to get these leaves no no all of those things are laying there in that seed is that right but the spirit of God has you come under the word for this age because it won't just be believing in this age is not enough that's right right the prophet addresses that in the token just to believe God sent a prophet he said is not enough see not just to believe the message is not enough it's to obey the message to come in under get under the blood not just to know and see the blood but to get under the blood the prophet says it like this and things that ought to be and I close here therefore tonight if you just come and you say I offer Jesus Christ my life and you've never received the Holy Ghost come into it you must do it you must grow into it listen to this Simplicity ask God to pile word on top of word like that until you become the full stature of a Son of God or a daughter of God what Simplicity he he shows all the way through this in this message the spirit of God lets us know you grow you come into that real true birth and as you come into that birth you grow to where you step into that new body it's growing you never stop growing but we have to hear that that word it gives us Direction gives us leadership right we looked at maybe even the percentage sitting here tonight that God has sealed away you know but still in our life that even those that have been sealed by the spirit of God God is working in our life to do what the perfecting we're already under the Perfection of his blood but the perfecting is the Furnishing him moving in our life him calling to us him letting us know you got something to do is that right you have something to do so we say Lord let me grow into that Lord help me Lord the prophet said how many of you here he said desire more of God and the people ra by as I'm listening and reading they raised their hands brother ra said see there's more of God for you am the Lord does that if it was just a man a man wouldn't do that but there's something that raises up in us that's why I love the ministry of the word that God comes down and deals with with our lives I love when I listen to the message of the hour it deals with my life then when I can read in the Scripture it deals in my life I love that amen but what we want to do is surrender surrender that's the difference between Esau and Jacob let's pray Lord God lord I I'm so thankful dear God for your leadership Lord I'm thankful Lord God what Comfort it is Lord to see not only have you provided knowing that we would be here in this moment in this hour but father you you come down lord and you make yourself known to us in these special ways Lord ways that Lord God that well the world would look at it Lord and scoff at it it's like Lord as it said in the scripture that you chose to to save man through the foolishness of preaching my Lord as Paul said Lord to that of the men the Greeks and things it's foolishness he said but unto us is the power of God and the Salvation Lord we just want to Lord so surrender Lord our lives and our hearts aresh to you tonight Lord we see your oversight and direction in our life that Lord all things being lined up Lord God to the counsel of your will and Lord we want to surrender and submit Lord even more to that Lord as Paul said I Die daily father here tonight God Among Us Lord father there would be one that

Lord God in our lives and our hearts Lord father for truly Lord you have all of the vitamins all the nutrients all that's needed in this age Lord God you are the diet of our life you have provided for us Lord that necessary diet Lord that we might Lord God day by day Lord growing maturing and as Enoch Lord one day taking that final step Lord oh God granted Lord we want to walk and we want to receive this Grace that's extended to us Lord I pray that God you'd help each and every one Lord help us tonight god father that through the preaching of your word the counsel you've given to us Lord how you've ministered to our hearts Lord God may we hold it dear to our hearts Lord every one of us oh God and Father that each and everyone Lord God lord to realize that father as this as Lord it would declare to us preach and when necessary use words granted Lord God may all of our Lives Lord be an expression may all of our Lives Lord preach a sermon Lord may it preach of your righteousness

situation Lord if there be one in the midst of a test or trial father in some way or way Lord they feel like they've just lost sight of you Lord they know you're there God I pray that father tonight Lord May their heart just find that Comfort Lord oh God coming Lord and just abiding under your wings Lord to know know that father that there is nothing that has taken them by chance Lord you know right where they are Lord you orchestrate you guide you direct Lord there'll not be one that'll be plucked out of your hands Lord we give you praise for that Lord we ask God that your comfort and your peace Lord would just ride in Lord and move in Lord on that heart and life God as they're just looking to you say Lord I commit my life in your hands I commit this situation Lord I commit Lord that
