[32:41] brother Jerry here with us and uh
[32:43] certainly not the circumstances but U
[32:46] nonetheless glad to have him here and uh
[32:49] with um as he's here I think we just use
[32:51] the
[32:52] gift so he's going to minister for us T
[32:55] tonight and then uh on Sunday Sunday
[32:58] morning the Lord willing and I didn't
[33:00] know if he'd be up to it tonight or not
[33:02] but um he's going to minister here for
[33:04] us and uh so we just want to pull on the
[33:07] gift of God God knows what what we have
[33:09] need of tonight anden knows just how to
[33:12] speak so directly to our hearts and I
[33:14] know we know that but I just know how
[33:17] God is able to so take a service and so
[33:19] design it to speak directly to our needs
[33:23] and we that's that's the kind of God we
[33:25] serve he's that personal and uh um so
[33:29] also I just want to make just a couple
[33:31] announcements as brother Jerry's coming
[33:34] um this coming Friday and I already sent
[33:36] that out to our youth at uh the uh
[33:39] tomorrow evening that that Bible study
[33:41] there at our home that's cancelled uh
[33:43] for the Youth and we'll try to get that
[33:45] rescheduled here for this sometime here
[33:48] hopefully in this month um and then
[33:51] posted on the bulletin boards in the in
[33:53] the restroom as well as it was sent out
[33:55] in the email so if you don't have an
[33:58] email or you don't read your email or
[34:00] you don't know what email is you can
[34:02] take a picture of the announcement on
[34:06] the bulletin board and that has all the
[34:08] information you need for sister Linda's
[34:11] viewing and
[34:13] funeral that that is there and the
[34:15] viewing is tomorrow night from 6:00 to
[34:17] 8:00 p.m. and then the service um will
[34:21] begin at 11:00 a.m. on um Saturday
[34:26] morning so we certainly they just ask
[34:28] you to remember that in prayer the
[34:30] family as well the Lord will just uh
[34:33] continue to minister to them there's
[34:36] there's one less Among Us and I know
[34:37] that sister Linda as after she came into
[34:40] that time of the surgery and prior to
[34:42] that a few years ago she wasn't able to
[34:44] make it on the Thursday nights but um
[34:48] she nonetheless many times was here and
[34:51] I I go went back through over the texts
[34:54] that she had sent me over the times
[34:56] after service was over and then even
[34:58] just recently and uh we're one less but
[35:03] uh Heaven's that much
[35:05] sweeter and uh she certainly stepping
[35:08] from this Veil into that there's no more
[35:12] suffering we're not praying for lung
[35:14] acceptance we're not we're not she
[35:16] doesn't have to worry about all of the
[35:18] conditions of this life any longer and
[35:20] I'm glad that not only that heaven is a
[35:23] real place but I'm grateful that we have
[35:25] that reality in our hearts of that that
[35:27] land and what he's done for us that we
[35:30] know that when our journey here is over
[35:33] if it's prior to the Rapture or in the
[35:35] rapture we have a body that is waiting
[35:39] amen reserved in the heavens not made
[35:41] with the hands we we that's a real peace
[35:43] to our hearts and our lives and she was
[35:45] ready to go uh not just ready
[35:47] spiritually but she was ready to go uh
[35:50] and we can see that so we're so thankful
[35:52] for that just continue to keep the
[35:54] family in prayer we'll certainly miss
[35:56] her but we we know this right here that
[35:59] we'll see our sister again and uh so
[36:02] let's just if we could stand here maybe
[36:04] change our position amen as we just want
[36:06] to maybe sing that course one more time
[36:09] as we just invite brother Jerry and so
[36:11] glad to have him here with us and uh so
[36:15] we just want him to take his
[36:18] Liberty have your
[36:24] way oh
[36:26] just
[36:29] [Music]
[36:32] away oh
[36:34] holy
[36:36] spirit fill our
[36:40] hearts and have your
[36:45] wait as we wait oh and as we
[36:50] wait we wait on you
[36:54] Lord and as we pray
[36:58] pray we pray unto you speak your word
[37:06] into our
[37:08] hearts and have your
[37:13] [Music]
[37:26] way
[37:46] you know when a when a
[37:49] Christian someone
[37:56] born
[38:02] um
[38:04] they you know it's actually a joyous
[38:06] time it's not really I mean we we grieve
[38:10] because we miss their presence
[38:13] here but it's actually a joyous time uh
[38:18] they went to a
[38:20] homecoming you know there was those
[38:23] there ready to greet them and meet them
[38:26] immediately actually
[38:28] to as soon as they went to leave this
[38:30] body there was already Saints greeting
[38:33] them to you know to take them on over to
[38:36] the other side remember brother brandham
[38:38] uh testifying uh what hope said when she
[38:41] was dying and he went in there and and
[38:44] she says I don't he called her back he
[38:46] said I don't got much time and oh
[38:48] they're coming I've got to go you know
[38:51] and uh so you know it's a joyous time
[38:54] for them and they're not grieving no
[38:58] right and uh you know remember hope I
[39:02] always think about it she had two
[39:04] babies and but when he called her when
[39:06] brother brandom called her back she said
[39:08] why did you call me back she didn't want
[39:11] to come back to this life it's so joyous
[39:14] that's right you know so uh so it it you
[39:18] know we say unfortunate uh circumstances
[39:21] to come together but it's actually it's
[39:23] a glorious time among the Believers you
[39:26] know
[39:27] so uh I'm happy to see you and let's
[39:31] just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly
[39:33] Father we thank you Lord tonight dear
[39:36] God and Lord I I see this message that
[39:39] you laid in my heart father as I was uh
[39:43] Gathering and my thoughts Lord from the
[39:46] long trip father I I wasn't even putting
[39:50] together why you were dirting me this
[39:52] way it wasn't connecting until I got up
[39:54] here in the pull pit Lord but God I ask
[39:57] that you'll just guide me now father
[39:59] anoint me father to bring this message
[40:02] Lord to be a a help to the people I pray
[40:04] in Jesus name
[40:07] amen amen if you would turn with me in
[40:09] your Bibles is 2 Corinthians chapter
[40:13] 5 um as you might have noticed I said
[40:17] when I was praying I you know uh it was
[40:21] a long trip up and uh I U I spent
[40:26] yesterday
[40:28] uh most of it getting my things together
[40:30] to come and then I I tried to lay down
[40:34] and and sleep and I I just couldn't get
[40:37] to sleep and so finally I just got up
[40:40] and and left about 10:00 last night our
[40:43] time which be 11:00 here and I just
[40:46] drove straight through and uh so uh I
[40:51] got a little sleep this afternoon but
[40:53] Samuel had called me earlier and asked
[40:56] if I'd speak so I said well let me just
[40:58] pray and let me take a look and see what
[41:01] the Lord would have and and I I just
[41:04] felt pulled to this message tonight and
[41:07] but I wasn't making the mental
[41:09] connection to why God was pulling me to
[41:11] it and until I got up here in the pull
[41:14] pit and felt the anointing so let's read
[41:17] from 2 Corinthians chapter 5 for we know
[41:20] that if our Earthly House of this
[41:22] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[41:24] building of God and house not made with
[41:26] hands Eternal in the heavens for in this
[41:30] we groan earnestly Desiring to be
[41:32] clothed upon with our house which is
[41:35] from Heaven if so be that being clothed
[41:39] we shall not be found naked for we that
[41:43] are in this Tabernacle do groan being
[41:46] burdened not uh for that we would be
[41:50] unclothed but clothed upon that
[41:52] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[41:55] amen you may be seated
[42:01] you realize when God uh was addressing
[42:05] through uh the John the Revelator about
[42:10] th this age this last Church age that
[42:14] when God addressed this last Church age
[42:17] one of the things he he said about it
[42:20] about the people and you realize when
[42:23] God's addressing the age uh when of each
[42:26] age you realize
[42:28] that U he he's not actually if you read
[42:30] there in the book He's not actually
[42:33] addressing uh people that have no
[42:38] profession he is actually addressing the
[42:41] church and he's addressing people who
[42:44] have a profession of
[42:47] Christianity and and so uh when you look
[42:50] at him addressing them here in
[42:53] Revelations 3 and he's talking about
[42:55] this last Church age
[42:57] uh he actually addressing these
[43:01] professed Christians he tells them you
[43:04] you're
[43:05] naked and and you don't know it and and
[43:10] and he says uh uh I I counsel you to buy
[43:13] me gold tried and the fire thou mayest
[43:15] be rich and white rment that thou mayest
[43:18] be clothed that the shame of thy
[43:20] nakedness does not appear so they you
[43:24] know uh naturally you know we say
[43:26] they're close they they they're clothed
[43:29] with uh man's Creed spiritually they're
[43:31] clothed with their Church teachings
[43:34] spiritually but in God's eyes they're
[43:37] naked because they're actually not
[43:40] clothed with his word and and so uh you
[43:45] know and in Hebrews it tells us the word
[43:48] of God is quick and Powerful sharper
[43:50] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[43:53] dividing the sun Soul and Spirit and
[43:55] other joints of Marl zerner of the
[43:57] thoughts and intents of the heart
[43:58] neither is there any creatures not
[44:00] manifest in sight but all things are
[44:03] naked and open to the eyes of him whom
[44:06] we have to do and so God looks at them
[44:10] and and just like when when Jesus was
[44:12] here on Earth you know the the Pharisees
[44:15] and the priests and all they were
[44:17] clothed in in in their teachings of the
[44:20] law they were clothed in all their
[44:22] traditions and that but Jesus said you
[44:25] know uh hourly got this appearance but
[44:28] inwardly he said you're full of dead
[44:30] men's bones so Jesus actually called
[44:32] their hand on the whole thing and he's
[44:34] showing them you're you're actually not
[44:36] clothed and so uh you know so uh those
[44:41] that that that that actually don't come
[44:44] into Christ and you know a lot of people
[44:46] think well you know well I believe Jesus
[44:48] died for me I accept him as my savior
[44:50] and and that's all it takes but but it's
[44:52] not actually uh you you you actually got
[44:55] to actually accept that and become part
[44:59] with that and actually accept Christ
[45:02] into your life to actually uh uh make a
[45:06] change in you to to you know there has
[45:09] to be a a spiritual change that happens
[45:13] to an individual before there can ever
[45:15] be a a a physical change without that
[45:19] spiritual change there won't be a
[45:21] natural physical change and and you know
[45:24] so uh and then I I think about then
[45:27] talking about the body this body that uh
[45:30] that Paul was speaking of here in
[45:32] Corinthians this uh this building of God
[45:35] that's not made with hands and and and I
[45:38] thought about you know even in the Book
[45:40] of Genesis there at the beginning that
[45:43] uh after Adam and Eve had partook of the
[45:45] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you
[45:47] know they they realized they they were
[45:49] naked they said you know and so uh they
[45:53] they tried to make them something to
[45:55] clothe themselves but then they heard
[45:58] the voice of God walking and when they
[46:01] heard the voice of God why they uh uh
[46:05] they they realize no matter what we've
[46:07] done we are going to be naked before him
[46:11] but but the thing what I want to point
[46:12] out to you was that actually that it
[46:15] says they heard the voice of the Lord
[46:18] God walking you know now you can't hear
[46:21] a voice
[46:23] walking so the Lord God was actually
[46:26] actually in a had was in a body that
[46:30] came down in the cool of the evening and
[46:33] fellowshipped with Adam and Eve in the
[46:36] cool of the evening they had fellowship
[46:38] with him before the fall you know and
[46:41] and so after the Disobedience to to God
[46:45] then there they were naked and then
[46:48] after this time God no longer came down
[46:51] and and and actually fellowship with
[46:53] them like he had done because man had
[46:57] put himself out of fellowship with God
[47:01] and and so but uh so he but God actually
[47:05] had come down he was walking in a body
[47:08] you know that when uh Abraham was in the
[47:10] plains of memory that that we find that
[47:13] that he he looked and and saw three men
[47:16] come walking and and when and you know
[47:19] and you know when there was two angels
[47:21] that went down to lot then later and lot
[47:23] said my lords but Abraham looks sees the
[47:26] three but there's one that's more
[47:29] prominent to him and he says my Lord
[47:32] singular you know and it was God that
[47:34] had come down and hear two angels with
[47:37] him and friends they weren't Spirits
[47:39] floating around they were walking in
[47:42] bodies and the body that they were
[47:44] walking in Abraham said if I found favor
[47:47] in thy sight come and sit down with me
[47:50] let me feed you let me give you some
[47:52] milk let me slay make some meat and
[47:55] bread for you to eat and they sat and
[47:57] they ate with
[48:00] Abraham God was in a
[48:03] body sir Hallelujah good preacher
[48:06] Hallelujah yes sir and so Paul says if
[48:09] this Earthly house this flesh which we
[48:11] know this flesh after the fall we
[48:14] realize then this flesh started it it
[48:17] dies you know and and so there there's
[48:21] look I'll tell you what you can pump
[48:22] this thing full of vitamins you can put
[48:24] it on all kinds of diets you can do
[48:26] everything you want you can drink Health
[48:28] drinks and everything else it's still
[48:30] dying that's right that's right because
[48:33] it's under the curse of sin and death
[48:35] that's right that's right we know that
[48:39] Jesus Christ came to pay for our
[48:42] Redemption but what that actually does
[48:44] for us here and now it actually it's the
[48:47] Redemption of our
[48:49] souls the body we're living in friends
[48:52] is not in a redeemed
[48:55] state
[48:57] yes
[48:57] sir it fails us it's getting old it it
[49:01] changes and and it's dying and
[49:04] eventually it's not going to be able to
[49:05] hold us any
[49:08] longer it's a corruptible home but but
[49:12] Paul said but the thing is when this
[49:15] corruption is dissolved he said we've
[49:18] actually got a body
[49:23] waiting yes sir we're not going friends
[49:26] look brother R said some people thought
[49:29] well you know when they die you know
[49:31] they just float around they just go
[49:32] they're remain like in his Spirit no
[49:34] there is a body according to the
[49:36] scripture and it's not a body we got to
[49:38] wait for it to be formed it's waiting on
[49:41] us remember when brother Bram said when
[49:43] you hear this message and you recognize
[49:46] it to be Eagle food he said you have
[49:49] actually heard from that
[49:52] body the
[49:55] theophany
[49:58] remember when brother bam said Jesus
[50:00] went and talked to the woman at the well
[50:02] and and he had went down to the priest
[50:04] of the temple and brother bam said what
[50:06] was the difference between the priest at
[50:07] the temple and the woman at the well he
[50:09] said the woman at the well had
[50:14] representation she had representation in
[50:17] heaven what was it it was the theophany
[50:20] and when Jesus come down there and spoke
[50:22] to her at the well she heard from that
[50:25] body that was waiting for
[50:28] [Applause]
[50:33] herall now Paul says you know flesh and
[50:36] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[50:38] he said but I show you a great mystery
[50:40] we shall not all sleep that means we
[50:42] shall not all die right but whether you
[50:46] die or whether you're alive he said
[50:48] we're all going to be
[50:50] changed we're going to receive a new
[50:55] body Hallelujah
[50:57] now and and and you know Philippians
[50:59] said the Lord Jesus Christ who's going
[51:01] to change our vile bodies to be like to
[51:04] his glorious
[51:06] body so when a when a saint dies uh
[51:11] there is there is a tabernacle a body a
[51:14] house a building waiting on them already
[51:17] for their their soul to go right into
[51:25] sir but it's not a glorified body
[51:28] brother bam said when he went beyond the
[51:30] curtain of time and he he saw them there
[51:31] he said they were in uh theophany bodies
[51:35] he said but they didn't need to eat they
[51:37] didn't need to sleep they didn't need
[51:38] these things and that you know he said
[51:40] but they were real he said I could touch
[51:43] them they hugged me I could talk they
[51:46] could talk I could hear
[51:47] them you said it was
[51:50] [Applause]
[51:52] real but now when the resurrection
[51:56] happens
[51:57] then it said you know uh the dead in
[51:59] Christ shall rise first and then we
[52:01] which are alive and remain shall be
[52:02] caught up to to meet uh together with
[52:05] them to meet him in the air but the
[52:07] thing that happens is they've got to
[52:09] come back and brother bam says that
[52:12] theop body therein it comes back and he
[52:15] says and it picks up flesh again and and
[52:18] but in a glorified
[52:20] [Applause]
[52:22] State and and we which are here friends
[52:25] look you think about it say in a moment
[52:27] in twinkling of eye how quick is that
[52:29] that's quick you know what happens is
[52:32] your friends look the theophany and and
[52:35] and that comes to meet you here and and
[52:39] this this these 16 elements that you're
[52:41] made up out of the molecules of this
[52:43] body friends there it's changed in a
[52:46] moment in twinkling of an eye and the
[52:48] theophany that glorified just comes
[52:50] together that
[52:55] quick oh
[52:57] my
[52:59] hallelujah oh what a
[53:02] Time Hallelujah when Jesus died on the
[53:06] cross and and the Bible tells us he
[53:09] descended into hell and he went and he
[53:12] preached to the souls that were in
[53:15] prison Jesus what happened when Jesus
[53:18] died on the cross he went into a
[53:21] theophany body the the body of Flesh
[53:23] that was hanging there that was the body
[53:25] of a man friends look it's it was the
[53:28] same kind of Flesh that you walk around
[53:30] in that flesh got old that flesh got
[53:33] tired that flesh at 33 looked like it
[53:35] was 50 and and and you know and it got
[53:38] tired and and and and and and and it he
[53:42] he had to uh struggle with the flesh yes
[53:46] sir right but they took that flesh down
[53:49] and put it in the Tomb but Jesus wasn't
[53:52] in that
[53:53] flesh he had already left that corrupt
[53:56] that was a corruptible body I want you
[53:57] to realize that that was not an immortal
[54:02] body it had to be a body just like ours
[54:05] because God wanted to come down and feel
[54:07] what we
[54:09] feel the Bible tells us that amen yes
[54:13] sir and so they took that body to a tomb
[54:16] but Jesus he had immediately went into a
[54:19] theophany body brother brandom said and
[54:21] descended into hell preached to the
[54:23] souls that were imprison that repented
[54:25] not in the days of
[54:28] Noah and then LED captivity captive came
[54:31] back up and remember he said when he he
[54:34] met uh them there in in in in in the the
[54:37] the the where the cemetery there was by
[54:40] the tomb and he said don't touch
[54:44] me he hadn't been R into that glorified
[54:47] body
[54:49] yet but then Jesus comes back look David
[54:53] said uh um I I have this uh hope in my
[54:58] flesh My Flesh has hope because he will
[55:02] not uh allow his holy one to see
[55:06] corruption he will not leave his soul in
[55:09] Hell or let his body see
[55:11] corruption but on the third day he rose
[55:14] again that thean he came back up and it
[55:17] picked up that flesh the molecules
[55:19] changed in that body you say what are
[55:20] you talking about the molecule change
[55:22] think about it friends go back into the
[55:24] Book of Genesis and look what happened
[55:26] to the
[55:27] serpent that's good that's good God
[55:31] cursed the serpent what happened to him
[55:33] his form changed his whole molecular
[55:37] structure instantly changed and he went
[55:40] from being a a beast to to to being a a
[55:46] like a reptile we look at today he said
[55:48] you're curse from now on your on thy
[55:51] belly Thou shalt crawl and the dust
[55:53] shall be thy
[55:55] meat
[55:58] that's so that's how the body change
[56:01] happens these molecules there brother
[56:04] bam in another place brother bam
[56:05] actually Likens it to a a solar system
[56:08] and he says it it's got out of orbit
[56:11] it's Planet our planets are out of orbit
[56:14] and he said you know like the Earth uh
[56:17] got off its axis and so it changed
[56:20] everything and that's the way it is with
[56:23] us but one day it's going to be set back
[56:25] right
[56:32] now second Corinthians 5 where we're
[56:35] reading if you look in verse 10 it says
[56:38] for we must all appear before the
[56:40] Judgment seat of Christ that everyone
[56:43] may receive the things done in his body
[56:45] according that he ha done whether it be
[56:47] good or bad knowing therefore the terror
[56:50] of the lord we persuade men but we are
[56:54] made manifest unto God and I trust trust
[56:56] also are made manifest in your
[56:59] conscience now
[57:02] there's there's there's actually seven
[57:06] dimensions the first three dimensions is
[57:09] light matter and
[57:12] time and you know you uh you our sight
[57:16] contacts the dimension of light our uh
[57:20] our feelings contacts the dimension of
[57:22] matter and and that and then there's the
[57:25] dimension of time but then there's a
[57:27] fourth dimension and uh that fourth
[57:30] dimension is a dimension of Science and
[57:34] and brother B said the proof of it is he
[57:35] said you know look there's there's uh
[57:37] radio waves and television waves and all
[57:40] this passing right through this building
[57:42] he said but if the right receiver's
[57:44] there it can pick up those waves and and
[57:46] and bring it in where it can be viewed
[57:49] but it's here so he says he says I I
[57:52] can't really explain to you he said that
[57:54] that fourth dimension of science but it
[57:56] it they've proved that it's there but
[57:58] then brother Bram says The Fifth
[58:00] Dimension is where the sinner the
[58:02] unbeliever when he dies that's where he
[58:05] goes that Fifth Dimension he says is
[58:08] kind of a horrible
[58:11] Dimension and and and I thought of that
[58:13] when I thought of what Paul said there
[58:15] when he said the terror when Paul said
[58:19] talking about those that that died uh
[58:22] that uh that you know were not in Christ
[58:25] he said the the terror you know and so
[58:28] brother Adam says that that Fifth
[58:31] Dimension is where the center goes it's
[58:33] a horrible Dimension he says when a
[58:35] Christian dies he goes to the sixth
[58:38] Dimension remember when brother brandom
[58:39] went beyond the curtain of time he asked
[58:41] where was Jesus they said oh he's on
[58:43] up you know we've got to wait for the
[58:46] time of the Rapture and everyone
[58:47] gathered together and then we go to meet
[58:50] him and and that so brother R said that
[58:54] Jesus is actually in the seventh
[58:57] Dimension now there was a story that
[58:59] brother brandham tells about in in
[59:03] 1965 uh of an incident that happened and
[59:06] it was wrote in Tucson paper and brother
[59:09] said a a woman was driving out across
[59:12] the desert he said about 50 m an hour or
[59:15] so and he said uh There Was An Old
[59:17] Gentleman in an Overcoat that was
[59:19] walking on the side of the road and he
[59:21] stepped out and she struck him with her
[59:24] car and his and when she hit him driving
[59:27] that fast he was thrown up into the air
[59:30] and and landed flipped over and landed
[59:32] out in the desert there was cars back
[59:34] behind her with people in it that
[59:36] actually witnessed it happened saw the
[59:38] lady got stopped her car got out went to
[59:40] look for the man you know and and the
[59:43] people behind her stopped got out they
[59:44] all went to go look for the man they
[59:46] couldn't find him they called the police
[59:48] the police come down there they search
[59:50] they couldn't find
[59:51] anybody but then what they said was they
[59:54] said well years ago there had actually
[59:57] been an old man that that with that
[59:59] description that had been hit by a car
[1:00:02] there and killed and brother said look
[1:00:05] what it is he says when they when a when
[1:00:08] a sinner dies they don't have a body to
[1:00:12] go to they don't have a body waiting on
[1:00:15] them he said so he says what happens is
[1:00:18] he said they they've got no body to go
[1:00:20] to this body has died so they got no
[1:00:23] body to come back to he said so kind of
[1:00:26] caught in between and he said they're in
[1:00:29] a
[1:00:33] nightmare and and he says here this this
[1:00:36] sinner had died and here he's stuck in
[1:00:39] that in that Fifth Dimension and here
[1:00:42] that Fifth Dimension actually can be
[1:00:44] contacted touched from this Dimension
[1:00:47] that we live in wowow
[1:00:50] wow that hear these people living in the
[1:00:53] first three uh four dimensions you know
[1:00:56] they the car actually hit somebody they
[1:01:00] saw him fly up in the
[1:01:02] air but the whole time he was already
[1:01:05] dead he was already gone he wasn't even
[1:01:08] in a
[1:01:12] body he was stuck the terror brother
[1:01:17] says when a man has a nightmare he's not
[1:01:19] altogether asleep neither is he awake
[1:01:22] he's between asleep and awake that's
[1:01:24] what makes him he said have a horrible
[1:01:26] shaking and screaming because he's not
[1:01:28] asleep but he's not awake and he says
[1:01:30] and take that and that shows where a man
[1:01:32] goes when he dies unconverted he's lived
[1:01:35] his time up he's dead on Earth he can't
[1:01:38] go into the presence of God because he's
[1:01:40] not fit to go there without the blood
[1:01:43] and and he's caught and he cannot come
[1:01:45] back to the Earth because his time's
[1:01:46] finished here and he's caught between
[1:01:49] he's in a nightmare he can't go into the
[1:01:52] presence of God to rest he can't come
[1:01:54] back here to Earth because his time is
[1:01:56] up he's in a
[1:01:58] nightmare and there he stays until the
[1:02:02] day of judgment he said what a horrible
[1:02:11] thing so you think about every soul that
[1:02:14] was unconverted that has died back
[1:02:17] through
[1:02:19] time nobody to go to and all this time
[1:02:24] they've actually been in a nightmare
[1:02:30] wow a horrible time brother R said their
[1:02:34] soul is actually caught between Earth
[1:02:37] and
[1:02:40] hell he said they're caught between the
[1:02:42] two things in The Fifth Dimension he's
[1:02:45] got a soul but he can't go in the
[1:02:47] presence of God but because he's not
[1:02:49] covered with the blood he's a sinner he
[1:02:51] can't wake himself up because his time's
[1:02:54] up here on Earth he said so he's there
[1:02:56] in a
[1:02:57] tormented
[1:02:59] nightmare he's caught between Earth and
[1:03:05] hell now in the Book of Revelations it
[1:03:09] speaks about the voice of many
[1:03:13] Waters and brother bam actually says
[1:03:16] that that voice of many Waters he says
[1:03:20] it it's people he said but it it is the
[1:03:24] the Ministers of the gospel that these
[1:03:27] people uh that lived in their time and
[1:03:30] he says that uh when the Judgment comes
[1:03:34] and he says the book of The Sinner is
[1:03:36] open and he says the The Voice he said
[1:03:41] that they sat in those services and they
[1:03:44] heard the word preached and they went
[1:03:47] out and left or friend you say well
[1:03:49] there was people that that had that that
[1:03:51] never maybe was in our services but the
[1:03:54] thing about it is Friends the voes is
[1:03:56] here it's the voice of God the voice of
[1:03:58] many Waters it's many Waters but it's
[1:04:00] singular
[1:04:02] voice yes
[1:04:04] sir and they get and and so they're held
[1:04:07] accountable right and on that day that
[1:04:10] that voice th those that voice of many
[1:04:13] Waters brother ra said from the the the
[1:04:16] services they set in it'll play back to
[1:04:19] them I think about those friends that we
[1:04:22] have saw over recent years that have
[1:04:25] actually set and and heard the message
[1:04:28] and and and some of them even claiming
[1:04:31] to have preached the message and they've
[1:04:33] turned their backs on it they've turned
[1:04:35] their backs on the message they've
[1:04:37] turned their backs and and you know they
[1:04:39] call Brother Brenham false and
[1:04:41] everything else and and you know they
[1:04:43] can't just go on their merry way but
[1:04:45] they got to post things on the internet
[1:04:47] and they and they've got to uh make
[1:04:49] videos and everything else trying to
[1:04:51] discredit
[1:04:53] it right Jes think about when they show
[1:04:58] up on the day of
[1:05:02] judgment they're going to hear the voice
[1:05:04] of many
[1:05:05] Waters the one that they turned their
[1:05:08] back on brother B said what is his voice
[1:05:10] it's the Judgment the voice of the
[1:05:12] ministers through the holy spirit that
[1:05:14] cried out to the people in every age
[1:05:16] standing there the voice of many Waters
[1:05:18] cried out he says the preaching the
[1:05:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost he says what
[1:05:24] will it be to know that they sat in the
[1:05:26] meetings and he said you sat in the
[1:05:28] meetings and heard that you should get
[1:05:30] right with God and receive the Holy
[1:05:32] Ghost and refuse to do it right he said
[1:05:36] a drifting soul to hear that voice speak
[1:05:38] out in that meeting that that you said
[1:05:40] in and heard the Judgment of God
[1:05:42] preached and refused it the great fall
[1:05:44] is just below you the great cataracts
[1:05:47] that'll take you to Eternal Doom the
[1:05:49] voice of many Waters he says how you
[1:05:52] going to do when it's recorded in glory
[1:05:54] when The Voice toight night is recorded
[1:05:56] he said your voice is recorded he said
[1:05:59] your thoughts are recorded as a man
[1:06:01] thinketh in his heart so is he notice
[1:06:03] your heart your your thoughts are louder
[1:06:05] in heaven than your voice here is on
[1:06:08] earth oh what will it be in that day
[1:06:10] when that voice Thunders out of many
[1:06:13] Waters many Church ages he said forming
[1:06:16] out and he said now a a drifting Soul a
[1:06:19] poor Drifter that's drifting over the
[1:06:22] great cataract Yonder be careful it'll
[1:06:24] be a horrible thing when you know
[1:06:26] there's no saving for you then you can't
[1:06:29] get saved you know your doomed lies
[1:06:31] before you when you know within a few
[1:06:33] minutes you'll hear that voice speak out
[1:06:35] depart from me you workers of iniquity
[1:06:37] into Everlasting fire which is prepared
[1:06:39] for the devil and his angels and you'll
[1:06:41] know when you hear that great FSE
[1:06:43] roaring of those voices of those
[1:06:44] meetings while you passed out of this
[1:06:47] and oh that horrible thing what a
[1:06:49] nightmare oh he says and door to the
[1:06:51] heart he said let let me give you a
[1:06:54] sight that's sickly he said how many
[1:06:56] people have sunk beyond the regions of
[1:06:59] Mercy into the devil's hell and torment
[1:07:02] of a nightmare how they'd love to come
[1:07:04] back and have one more chance if they
[1:07:07] could do it tonight if Jesus would come
[1:07:10] uh uh to hell and knock on their door he
[1:07:14] said but you know he said oh oh Robert
[1:07:17] says he's a good God he said he is a
[1:07:20] good god he he said he said he's a god
[1:07:22] of Mercy he said and he's also a God of
[1:07:25] Justice
[1:07:26] judgement he said every sinner that that
[1:07:30] that dies he said a nightmare a death
[1:07:32] that's due every sinner every sinner is
[1:07:34] subject to death and deserves it because
[1:07:38] he's a sinner he deserves the death he
[1:07:40] deserves that great
[1:07:45] horror
[1:07:47] wow you think about all these famous
[1:07:51] people over the years actually some uh
[1:07:54] Within the lifetime of some of you
[1:07:56] sitting here that that were famous you
[1:07:59] know and and they they sold out for
[1:08:01] popularity and and fame and and of this
[1:08:04] life and everything else and and brother
[1:08:06] renam said like that talking about Elvis
[1:08:09] Presley selling out his Birthright and
[1:08:11] that you know and they sold out and you
[1:08:13] think about it today they're in a
[1:08:16] nightmare tonight and they've been stuck
[1:08:19] there since they'd left this
[1:08:24] life
[1:08:26] now we know that the Rapture is going to
[1:08:28] take place but we know there's uh when
[1:08:30] the Rapture takes place there's three
[1:08:31] and a half years of tribulation here for
[1:08:34] those that are left behind here on this
[1:08:35] Earth uh the brides in glory for three
[1:08:38] and A2 years and then you know comes the
[1:08:41] the the battle of Armageddon and we come
[1:08:43] back down to this earth and and take
[1:08:45] over and then we set up the millennial
[1:08:46] reign of a thousand years here on this
[1:08:49] Earth friends look uh that resurrection
[1:08:51] that happens prior to the uh Rapture in
[1:08:54] that only the Saints only those that are
[1:08:57] born again that have died in Christ
[1:08:59] they're the only ones that come up in
[1:09:00] that
[1:09:01] Resurrection all the others who have
[1:09:03] died they're still stuck in that
[1:09:05] Nightmare and they're in that nightmare
[1:09:08] during the whole thousand years of the
[1:09:10] millennial Reign that will be
[1:09:12] in and it isn't until actually after the
[1:09:15] Thousand Years Millennial range Reign
[1:09:18] when the the white Throne judgment is
[1:09:21] and that's when the Bible says that the
[1:09:23] the sea will give forth it dead the
[1:09:26] Earth will give forth its dead and all
[1:09:28] the dead shall
[1:09:33] rise brother and sister when they rise
[1:09:36] they they when they died a sinner they
[1:09:38] had no body waiting on them to go to
[1:09:41] like a Believer does he says when they
[1:09:43] come back here they've got to stand the
[1:09:45] Bible says in a body before the Judgment
[1:09:48] seat and he said the body they're going
[1:09:50] to stand in is the body that they lived
[1:09:53] in here the body they Ed in here and the
[1:09:56] things they done and and and they won't
[1:09:59] be able to say no I never had an
[1:10:00] opportunity I never heard because
[1:10:02] they're going to be standing there in
[1:10:04] the very body that they had lived in
[1:10:10] here
[1:10:14] hallelujah they won't be able to to deny
[1:10:21] anything now I told you that uh you know
[1:10:25] the uh the story that brother man
[1:10:27] relates it was out of the Tucson paper
[1:10:29] about the man walking the old man
[1:10:30] getting hit by the car and that and he
[1:10:32] said you know it was a he was in a
[1:10:34] nightmare it was a a sinner he was lost
[1:10:37] you know and and here he was stuck in
[1:10:39] that Fifth Dimension stuck between Earth
[1:10:41] and hell and and you know hear a car in
[1:10:44] this Dimension that we live in actually
[1:10:47] contacted him touched him affected him
[1:10:49] threw him back up in the
[1:10:53] air remember when brother
[1:10:56] brandham uh remember he said he didn't
[1:10:59] know whether it was a dream or what it
[1:11:00] was in that but he he relates remember
[1:11:02] his his wife and his his daughter hope
[1:11:05] uh and and Sharon Rose had died and and
[1:11:08] so brother bandam said he was walking
[1:11:10] and he said uh that that that he saw
[1:11:13] this young lady and she said hello Daddy
[1:11:17] and and and he said well I'm not old
[1:11:20] enough to be your daddy you know brother
[1:11:22] BR was just a young man back then and
[1:11:24] she said Daddy she said I'm your little
[1:11:26] Sharon Rose she said there's no we're no
[1:11:29] babies up here you know and and and see
[1:11:33] she she had received that body she had
[1:11:35] been changed and and there she was and
[1:11:38] and so she spoke to him and and she says
[1:11:40] I'm going to wait here on Billy and she
[1:11:42] said uh Mama's on up at the house and
[1:11:46] there was a house and so brother brandom
[1:11:49] went on up to the house now brother bam
[1:11:51] begins to relate this story about when
[1:11:53] he and hope you know hope was alive and
[1:11:55] and you know they didn't have much money
[1:11:58] and and they were very poor and and
[1:12:00] they' went out and and they had
[1:12:01] purchased him a chair uh uh you know an
[1:12:05] easy chair to sit in at the house and
[1:12:08] they were making payments on it and I
[1:12:10] can't remember the figure right now off
[1:12:12] top of my head but it was a very low
[1:12:14] amount if you think about it today but
[1:12:16] they they got to where they got behind
[1:12:17] they couldn't meet the payments and that
[1:12:19] and so the furniture store came back
[1:12:21] down and got that chair and repossessed
[1:12:23] it and and took the chair back
[1:12:25] and remember brother Brandon was coming
[1:12:27] home and and hope was uh she made him a
[1:12:30] a pie and made him his favorite uh meal
[1:12:33] and she got the little boys in the
[1:12:34] neighborhood to go out and dig up some
[1:12:36] worms and things and he came in she
[1:12:38] didn't want him to go in living she said
[1:12:40] let's just go
[1:12:41] fishing I got the boys to dig you some
[1:12:44] worms and things let's just go fishing
[1:12:45] she didn't want him to go in there he
[1:12:47] said no I don't feel like doing that
[1:12:48] finally then she goes and she broke down
[1:12:51] and she was so sad said they've took
[1:12:52] your
[1:12:54] chair well brother Brandon relates when
[1:12:56] he went there and he was goes on up to
[1:12:58] the house and he goes up to see hope and
[1:13:00] and and he greets hope and and there he
[1:13:02] is and hope said do you remember that
[1:13:05] chair he said yeah she said that chair
[1:13:09] is
[1:13:10] here and she said they can't take
[1:13:14] [Music]
[1:13:15] [Applause]
[1:13:17] it
[1:13:19] now you know if you're aware at all have
[1:13:22] ever heard about brother Perry green I
[1:13:24] I'll tell you brother Perry green he was
[1:13:26] here with brother brandom and that and
[1:13:28] after the death of BR brand he actually
[1:13:30] went out and he located all these
[1:13:32] different things out in the desert the
[1:13:33] mountain everything that brother bam
[1:13:35] gave a witness to and talked about that
[1:13:37] brother Perry green actually you know he
[1:13:38] was very uh uh creative and inventive of
[1:13:41] finding these places than that there was
[1:13:43] one place brother randam talked about it
[1:13:45] came into a pyramid in that and brother
[1:13:47] Perry uh got hired a a little private
[1:13:50] plane to fly him out there in in in in
[1:13:53] in the desert out there in Arizona and
[1:13:56] he was looking for that where the
[1:13:58] mountains brother Bram said it came
[1:13:59] together like a pyramid and so he was
[1:14:02] looking for it and and he couldn't find
[1:14:04] it and he's flying around he's looking
[1:14:06] all of a sudden the thought hits him and
[1:14:07] he asks the pilot can you turn this
[1:14:09] plane upside down and so the pilot said
[1:14:12] yeah sure so the pilot rolls that plane
[1:14:15] like that and when he rolled that plane
[1:14:17] like that right there the mountains
[1:14:19] coming down this way was what formed
[1:14:22] that pyramid that brother Ram talked
[1:14:24] about yes sir brother Perry see he was
[1:14:26] he was real good and about finding these
[1:14:29] things and that and all that so brother
[1:14:31] Perry gives a testimony of when brother
[1:14:32] brandham died you know and and they they
[1:14:34] had the car for a while that was in the
[1:14:37] the wreck and everything and all that
[1:14:39] you know and and that and so brother
[1:14:41] Perry got to thinking about that chair
[1:14:43] so brother Perry you know he was going
[1:14:45] to he he was he was going to go get that
[1:14:47] chair and so he he he goes down over to
[1:14:50] the F the the furniture store down there
[1:14:52] to find that chair and that and when he
[1:14:54] goes they said they looked for it and
[1:14:56] that in their their warehouse said we
[1:14:58] can't find the chair and so they they
[1:15:01] look through the records and that and
[1:15:03] they had never resold the
[1:15:05] chair and so they couldn't find it and
[1:15:07] so brother Perry gives testimony and he
[1:15:10] goes back to this testimony brother
[1:15:11] Bam's given where hope says the chair's
[1:15:13] here and they can't take
[1:15:18] it so I'm telling you friends a chair

[1:31:41] wasn't I wasn't praying to none of those
[1:31:42] people and they didn't need to hear what

[1:31:48] myself while I was standing there by her
[1:31:49] bed holding her hand and I said Lord if
[1:31:52] there if everything is okay okay between
[1:31:54] you and sister

[1:32:00] going into your presence I said don't
[1:32:01] bring her back to I said take her on out
[1:32:03] of here Lord and so I I got done praying
