[0:00] that but it's something that's going on
[0:01] there's a shout there's a voice as a
[0:03] trump when we were looking at adoption
[0:04] adoption is model clear back from Jesus
[0:06] Christ we see adoption in Christ we see
[0:09] adoption in the sons and daughters of
[0:10] God and we see adoption in the church
[0:13] and I'll come back to how I know just
[0:14] laid a lot out there but I'll go ahead
[0:16] and qualify this in a moment amen but
[0:18] when we look at Jesus Christ brother Ben
[0:20] talks about God's masterpiece and he had
[0:23] a masterpiece it was so perfect he had
[0:25] to smile him is that right he smoked
[0:27] that master precinct right out speak is
[0:29] that right and why was he smoked that
[0:31] God could have another masterpiece amen
[0:34] now it's not a different look or a
[0:36] different spirit is that right it's
[0:38] different bodies different parts of the
[0:39] earth but it's the same spirit amen
[0:42] just like in the original atom though
[0:44] evil was a separate body though she was
[0:46] a byproduct as far as the creation was
[0:48] concerned yet brother BAM says it was
[0:50] the self same spirit and so today we've
[0:53] received not just the spirit of a holy
[0:55] man or have a prophet but of the only
[0:57] begotten Son of God
[0:59] a son of God that come to an adoption
[1:01] now listen when he was born he's born a
[1:04] son is that right I didn't become a son
[1:06] when the Holy Ghost come down in the
[1:07] river Jordan but he was always a son is
[1:10] that Alright but when the Holy Ghost
[1:11] come down on the river Jordan through a
[1:13] prophet he identified him as a son and
[1:17] then now Jesus is always a son but not
[1:19] he's identified thou aren't my son
[1:21] Andrew Lyon please supply a man so the
[1:25] Holy Ghost comes to identify his sonship
[1:28] that he already has is that right
[1:29] description tells us that the Holy Ghost
[1:31] comes to us for the same reason because
[1:34] we are sons the Bible says God has sent
[1:37] his spirit unto us whereby we cry Abba
[1:41] Father and there would be one thing to
[1:43] just say that God's your father said
[1:45] nothing when the Holy Ghost comes into
[1:47] the human heart and he bears witness he
[1:49] is giving us a voice in a generation
[1:52] when other voices are speaking we've got
[1:54] every kind of opinion and every kind of
[1:56] politics never kind of
[1:58] yeah there's a voice of God in this
[2:00] generation and he is coming to Claire
[2:03] not that you will be not that you could
[2:06] be now are we the sons of God do you
[2:13] want to wait years and not recognize it
[2:15] yet you were a son your daughter that's
[2:17] who you always were but when the Holy
[2:20] Ghost comes he brings an identification
[2:21] this is my son this is my daughter they
[2:25] might not look like much to the world
[2:27] they might not look like a great
[2:29] somebody or be esteemed
[2:31] in the halls of Congress but in the eyes
[2:33] of God they're perfect God sees that
[2:36] photo he took you before the world again
[2:43] we many times we were looking at the
[2:45] wrong thing hey man we're looking at our
[2:48] flash and we're trying to be made
[2:49] perfect and the Apostle Paul says in
[2:51] Galatians 2 if you've begun the spirit
[2:53] are you now going to be made perfect or
[2:56] mature in the flesh
[2:57] I miss you we try to we try to fix this
[2:59] pest house it's not your job to fix it
[3:01] it's your job to outgrow it it's your
[3:04] job to mortify it and then we're gonna
[3:06] put off this thing I'm not taking this
[3:09] with me but that thing that God put on
[3:12] the inside is gonna change the atoms and
[3:15] quicken this mortal body and get shall
[3:17] be swallowed up in life corruption shall
[3:24] put on incorruption amen
[3:26] now we're talking about Christ as a son
[3:30] when we look at the book of Galatians
[3:32] the third fourth chapters it tells you
[3:34] what was the purpose of the law it was a
[3:35] schoolmaster we were we were just doing
[3:37] our home school the other day and we
[3:39] were studying my wife was doing the
[3:40] history of the Greek culture and the
[3:43] Athenians when they're sent come of age
[3:44] he received what's called a pedagogue or
[3:47] a child instructor or what the King
[3:49] James calls a schoolmaster and his job
[3:52] was to oversee the learning of that
[3:54] child he wasn't to oversee everybody's
[3:57] learning he had one child and he oversaw
[4:00] his learning and no matter what his
[4:01] curriculum was or what he thought was
[4:02] taught it was the duty of this
[4:05] of the pedagogue or the schoolmaster to
[4:07] make sure he was being trained right in
[4:09] whatever it is he's supposed to be
[4:10] training and so for the RAM talks about
[4:12] how we have a schoolmaster like that
[4:14] brother man says this is spiritual
[4:16] adoption he said I'd rather have a man
[4:18] that didn't know his ABCs to teach my
[4:21] child that had the Holy Spirit then all
[4:25] the professors in the world
[4:27] that didn't have the Holy Spirit for he
[4:28] speaks of the Father and the Holy Spirit
[4:32] speaks of the father and then it'll
[4:33] teach the child one not to be tossed
[4:36] about with every wind of doctrine as I
[4:40] read the scripture says don't be
[4:41] children tossed to and fro he's trying
[4:43] to bring you to a place where I this
[4:45] person says this about the message this
[4:46] person says that about the Bible and we
[4:48] can stand there and say that go loves me
[4:50] I'm not shaking up listen brothers and
[4:53] sisters there's a lot of nonsense I've
[4:56] received a kingdom it can't be moved you
[5:02] don't pray because I'd rather have that
[5:35] I'm not saying you can't learn your ABC
[5:38] he's not saying that I'd rather have a
[5:40] man that knew what the mind of the
[5:42] father was then to have the rest if you
[5:44] had to choose just one amen hey man he
[5:47] said that tossed to and fro with every
[5:49] wind of doctrine but they accept and
[5:51] believe the principles that the father
[5:54] has laid down now the Bible as I was
[5:57] saying here in Galatians 3 and 4 it's
[6:00] telling us if you read through it that
[6:01] the law was a schoolmaster or a teacher
[6:03] and at first it seems like it's saying
[6:05] something different than what the
[6:07] prophets saying but I want you to
[6:08] understand Paul is speaking to a group
[6:10] of Jews about the Jewish dispensation
[6:13] they were given the law as a teacher or
[6:16] a schoolmaster
[6:17] until the fullness of time had come and
[6:19] then what does God knew he sends his son
[6:21] notice he's born of a woman born under
[6:25] the law the Bible says so when Christ
[6:27] when he comes he's born under a law or
[6:30] he has that as a schoolmaster amen so
[6:33] even though he comes to the Jordan River
[6:34] even though the Holy Ghost comes down he
[6:36] lives a life subject to the law of Moses
[6:39] why the show that are you sinless the
[6:42] show that he had come into full
[6:44] obedience is that right though he were a
[6:46] son yet learned he obedience through the
[6:50] things he suffered and being made
[6:52] perfect
[6:53] amen amen being napery he becomes the
[6:56] author of eternal salvation amen so
[6:59] there comes a day we're familiar
[6:59] hopefully whether the Prophet says but
[7:01] under that dispensation he comes to
[7:04] Mount Transfiguration one day and God
[7:06] takes him up there on the mountain with
[7:07] Peter James and John and the cloud
[7:08] overshadowed and testifies now listen
[7:11] the Holy Ghost has already testified
[7:12] that this is a son of God and then he's
[7:15] gonna but he's gonna do two things up
[7:17] here one he's going to reaffirm the
[7:19] witness this is my son but now he's
[7:21] going to give a commandment or a
[7:23] commission with that he says this is my
[7:26] beloved son hear ye him and then in
[7:30] other words now he's come to a position
[7:31] where he can enact the father's business
[7:34] here's a name on the checkbook it's as
[7:36] good as mine and then his de because his
[7:39] name is the family name it's the whole
[7:41] name by which the family of heaven on
[7:43] earth his name amen
[7:45] this is why after the Transfiguration he
[7:47] goes down to Jerusalem and he begins to
[7:49] speak to his disciples and he says
[7:51] henceforth he asked nothing in my name
[7:54] but now I want you to ask in my name and
[7:57] I will pray the father and he will give
[7:59] it to him why what happens his name what
[8:02] does the Bible tell us that he by an
[8:05] inheritance has what obtained a more
[8:07] excellent name than the Angels he men so
[8:10] was not just gifted but as an
[8:11] inheritance now I want to serve in the
[8:13] Bible tells us in Galatians 4:1 an heir
[8:15] is a child he differs nothing from the
[8:18] servant there's no distinction there
[8:20] though he's a son that he's been
[8:22] identified he's playing with the
[8:24] servants and he looks the same and he he
[8:26] serves the will of the Father
[8:28] he comes to maturity he gets an
[8:31] inheritance he's identifying the father
[8:34] plates and he places him as a son he
[8:37] gives him a position and he shows this
[8:39] is my son he's his name I can either
[8:41] give him a signet ring I think they
[8:42] talked about and the old testement to
[8:44] give them a ring because they couldn't
[8:45] all right
[8:45] and you take that ring and you stamp
[8:47] that paper whatever
[8:48] that's as good as the father doing it
[8:50] cause it's the same name so notice my
[8:52] virtue of his adoption he receives a
[8:55] name which is above every other name and
[8:58] then he tells his church or his
[9:00] disciples I want you when you pray to
[9:03] pray in this thing because there's an
[9:04] authority that's greater than everything
[9:07] in heaven on earth every other name is
[9:09] subject to this name and so when you're
[9:13] praying you're praying in the name of an
[9:14] adopted son Jesus Christ he has the
[9:18] authority a men that's why he could say
[9:20] when he returns that all power is given
[9:22] to me in heaven and earth now one should
[9:26] consider that for a second he says all
[9:28] part of that means he he left nothing
[9:29] off and man there's nothing that you're
[9:32] going through today there's no
[9:34] circumstance in your life or things in
[9:36] your past that are above the name of
[9:39] Jesus Christ and it's the family name
[9:41] and so he's trying to impart sonship now
[9:44] notice what Jesus is crucified at
[9:47] Calvary then it's not just a son of God
[9:49] on the cross
[9:49] it's an adopted son of God on the cross
[9:52] that's why the Bible Romans 8 says that
[9:55] we receive what the spirit of adoption
[9:57] so we're not just receiving a spirit but
[10:00] the spirit that was in him an adopted
[10:02] son of God has come back and become the
[10:04] teacher or the schoolmaster not just to
[10:07] the Jew but also to the Greek that's my
[10:10] Paul can say in the second book or
[10:12] second chapter of Romans that they that
[10:14] didn't have a lot they had become a law
[10:16] unto themselves through what through the
[10:20] circumcision not made with hands by the
[10:22] Holy Ghost or the spirit of adoption and
[10:26] then I just think God you know brother
[10:27] branham's listen to him in adoption how
[10:29] about mule religion a man it's for the
[10:30] meal he don't know his mommy is you
[10:32] don't know who his daddy is he says but
[10:33] he's a hard worker that's the only thing
[10:35] he's got known for he's a hard worker he
[10:37] can work harder than the rest me says a
[10:39] real thoroughbred he said this the thing
[10:40] with me
[10:41] you gotta beat him all the time you
[10:43] gotta be there you gotta beat him
[10:44] they're looking they're gonna make him
[10:45] work and then that's about how many Old
[10:48] Religion is amen
[10:49] what I gotta make them do this and don't
[10:51] steal don't kill no I you gotta tell me
[10:54] you gotta force him you gotta make them
[10:55] but a real thoroughbred he did crack the
[10:57] whip once and off they go it's not what
[10:59] I write it is and then Prince I thank
[11:02] God that I don't have to get up here and
[11:03] beat people just serve God but there's a
[11:07] law in their heart that's written that
[11:08] will make them serve go further than
[11:10] stony tables could ever produce listen I
[11:13] thank God for Mosley thank God for those
[11:16] tables that were written on my side of
[11:18] it that could never produce
[11:19] the life but the spirit in Christ the
[11:22] life of Christ can produce
[11:24] the law of love the law of Christ in the
[11:27] heart of believer so now it's come by
[11:30] the spirit that's the law of life amen
[11:32] and that's what we own today that's why
[11:34] it's a tutor or a schoolmaster for us
[11:37] same in the Holy Ghost amen
[11:38] praise the Lord so the spirit of
[11:41] adoption as I said Paul said because you
[11:43] are sons he's given to you his spirit a
[11:46] minute so we talked about this in Christ
[11:47] Christ is born he's a son he comes of
[11:49] the River Jordan
[11:50] he received the Holy Ghost but there
[11:52] comes a time of maturity or adoption
[11:54] because every son must be proved when he
[11:56] comes to God Amen everyone God always
[11:59] has a time-tested memorial God's not
[12:01] slack in his business he's not careless
[12:03] no matter who it is no matter who we are
[12:06] he's got to test the material that's in
[12:09] that memorial and if he did it in Christ
[12:12] he's going to do it enough amen so now
[12:14] notice he does it this way he identify
[12:16] him and then adopts him he learned
[12:17] obedience through the things that he
[12:20] suffers amen
[12:21] my mom so now this is an adopted son of
[12:25] God as I said he's yield up his spirit
[12:27] this couldn't happen under Moses it
[12:28] could not happen under Isaiah it had to
[12:31] be the life that was in Melchizedek the
[12:33] life of God was the only thing that
[12:36] could bring this a spirit of adoption
[12:39] amen now what you think about this
[12:41] because Ephesians 1:5 talks about the
[12:43] adoption of sons
[12:44] we've been predestinated we use that
[12:45] word a lot how many's predestinated and
[12:47] you all raise your hand well hopefully
[12:48] you do I mean people are doing their
[12:51] predestinated where's the hand
[12:53] see anywhere here but you know how some
[12:55] people don't like that we're
[12:55] predestination brother in sense but it's
[12:57] in the Bible we talk often about being
[13:00] predestinated but what are we
[13:02] predestinated - that'd be like me sent
[13:05] on the air on the air what is the air of
[13:07] I'm the air of you know you could be
[13:11] there of Trump Tower you could be the
[13:13] air of my bank account that has two
[13:15] different connotations altogether hey
[13:17] man what we're Aries look free destined
[13:19] unto what Ephesians 1:5 tells you are
[13:22] you've been predestinated unto the
[13:25] adoption of sons that's what your
[13:27] predestination is I said the book of
[13:29] Romans says then that he foreknew he
[13:31] predestinated to be conformed to what
[13:33] the image of his son up adopted a
[13:37] predestined son amen so much the most
[13:40] predestination your your destination or
[13:43] your dusties predetermined and we think
[13:45] about that often but many times we fail
[13:46] to look at what is it we've been
[13:48] predestinated - unto maturity under this
[13:51] perfection listen God left something for
[13:54] us in this age hey man is that right the
[13:57] bucket the book of Hebrews tells you
[13:59] about J pepsin Simpson all these
[14:01] different ones and the Bible says that
[14:03] they though they had faced a man yet
[14:06] they died because God had left something
[14:08] better for us that they without us
[14:11] should not be made perfect so I'm coming
[14:15] out of the Church of God or the body of
[14:17] Christ amen
[14:18] because I want you to think about this
[14:19] today your identification we talked
[14:21] about being the Bride of Christ and then
[14:23] I'm not the bride of Christ and you're
[14:25] not but we as a body or the Bride of
[14:27] Christ amen
[14:28] it's not individual brides it's one
[14:31] bride it's a body and so how God treats
[14:34] his church or his bride is different
[14:36] than how he treats you as a son or
[14:37] daughter it's an individual affair he
[14:40] grows his church but he grows
[14:41] individuals within that church the same
[14:44] way so God's pattern never changes they
[14:47] men so we look at the book of Romans
[14:49] 8:23 and it tells us there's an adoption
[14:51] as to it the redemption of the body he's
[14:54] talking about the changing of the body
[14:56] but Paul talks about in the Bible for
[14:58] Scruton is 15 and in 1st Thessalonians 4
[15:01] they that are asleep in Christ God
[15:03] suffering with
[15:04] amen and then we which are alive I mean
[15:07] we'll be caught up in there will be
[15:08] changed in a moment or the twinkling of
[15:11] an eye it's the redemption of the body
[15:14] and I like to throw this in here real
[15:15] quick Paul says it's the redemption of
[15:17] the body not bodies but one body the
[15:19] whole body is redeemed at once now you
[15:22] each get new bodies in it which is great
[15:24] it's like I said I'm tired of this pest
[15:26] house but it's the redemption of the
[15:28] body of Christ his church or what is now
[15:31] called his bride
[15:32] hey man praise the Lord he got over
[15:35] seven churches and I hope well probably
[15:38] settled on this all right so I'm looking
[15:39] to lay this out real quick because you
[15:41] shall probably know this I'm sure but
[15:43] God through the Holy Ghost he is well
[15:46] didn't want by the spirit of adoption
[15:48] he's building a church through seven
[15:51] Church ages amen so we know that about
[15:53] the church is faith virtue knowledge
[15:55] time you look at these things what he's
[15:57] doing he's building a body of Christ
[15:58] amen praise the Lord now they were given
[16:02] promises the Bible says that we are
[16:03] partakers of the divine nature how many
[16:06] knows how you particular to my nature
[16:08] second Peter tells you how through his
[16:10] exceeding great and precious promises so
[16:14] the promise for your day determines what
[16:17] the nature of God is that you partake of
[16:19] if you lived in Wesley's day you'd have
[16:22] been a partaker under the message of
[16:24] Wesley on the sanctification but we've
[16:27] come to an age of the fullness the
[16:29] Prophet does it's the capstone prophetic
[16:31] ministry in other words the same adopted
[16:34] son that died and rose again his
[16:36] headship has come down you're not
[16:38] partaking of just a measure but the
[16:40] fullness of the revealed word that's why
[16:43] I probably could say this message is
[16:45] Christ because when you partake to this
[16:47] message the only thing it can produce is
[16:49] Christ it has to produce adopted sons
[16:53] and daughters of God he come through
[16:55] Luther he'd come through us say but
[16:57] maturity or adoption wasn't for their
[16:59] age it's for the end time it's for this
[17:02] hour you've got something great or not
[17:05] that doesn't leave off justification but
[17:07] you've got something
[17:08] later justification has done something
[17:10] It's Made away the problems a
[17:12] justification
[17:13] made a way for sanctification
[17:14] sanctification
[17:16] made a way for the baptism of Holy Ghost
[17:18] and many people stop there with the
[17:20] problems that the baptism the Holy Ghost
[17:22] made a way for the Holy Ghost at south
[17:24] to come in perfection he said what are
[17:29] you talking I'm getting ahead of myself
[17:30] a little bit but he said what do you
[17:31] mean what's the difference it's one
[17:33] thing to be born it's another thing to
[17:35] produce a child and that's one thing to
[17:38] be born again nothing to reproduce the
[17:40] light of Christ in its maturity listen a
[17:44] child can't reproduce that life it takes
[17:46] a mature son or daughter and so what
[17:49] we're looking for is that the original
[17:50] seed and spoken word it's the original
[17:52] seed there's a separation that comes
[17:55] between the shock or the Pentecostal
[17:56] amen amen
[17:58] now the capstone it comes it comes down
[18:00] with what crimes of grace grace romances
[18:03] it's a rapturing grace for the
[18:06] perfecting of the church amen
[18:08] in other words he's going to produce it
[18:09] listen you can't produce the changing of
[18:11] a lot amen would it be nice to go to the
[18:13] doctor if you could have such a such
[18:15] amount of money and big twenty years old
[18:17] again you that are older than that some
[18:20] of you know my son would be okay he'd be
[18:21] ready to go drive well either you let
[18:24] her own or wouldn't be ready to go to
[18:26] that now listen you you're getting
[18:27] enough money you can go to plastic
[18:28] surgery and you can bow top you can do
[18:30] all these things but you can't change
[18:32] the body it's the work of God is that
[18:35] right it's something that God is going
[18:37] to do in his church in the ordained yet
[18:40] for a certain season it couldn't happen
[18:42] under looser it couldn't happen under
[18:44] Wesley it couldn't even happen under the
[18:46] Pentecostals but when the maturity of
[18:48] the capstone has come because the only
[18:51] perfect love can produce this that will
[18:54] produce the changing of a body it's the
[18:56] Holy Ghost itself in perfection amen
[19:01] praise the Lord it's the culmination of
[19:04] the of the adoption of the church
[19:06] there's an adoption for the church or
[19:07] the body of Christ and it comes at the
[19:09] end time under a prophetic ministry and
[19:12] then there had to be something to bring
[19:14] it all together to top
[19:15] loose ends and brothers and sisters I
[19:17] believe we're here today I'm not looking
[19:19] for it to come I'm gonna ask if it's
[19:21] gonna be another but I believe that the
[19:23] same Elijah that same spiritus that part
[19:26] of the Jordan River that same spirit
[19:28] that was in John the Baptist that same
[19:30] spirit is coming our generation that
[19:32] same spirit by the Holy Ghost he spoke
[19:35] as squirrels in the existence he moved
[19:37] back storms he discerned the thoughts
[19:40] and intents of the heart I believe we've
[19:42] had a prophet messenger brother William
[19:44] Branham it's come to fulfill the
[19:46] adoption of the body of Christ there's
[19:51] only one prophesied to come it couldn't
[19:52] be another it didn't come by me or by
[19:55] you but it comes from God through his
[19:57] ordained vessel the Bible tells that men
[20:00] shall not live by bread alone but by
[20:02] every word every word that proceedeth
[20:07] out of the mouth of God now what you
[20:11] think about it he didn't say every word
[20:12] of God everyone that proceeds out of the
[20:14] mouth of God because God has a
[20:17] mouthpiece and when the Prophet tells
[20:20] the churches today they've become their
[20:22] own mouthpiece they speak to their own
[20:24] spirit they speak of themselves but
[20:26] there's got to be a mouth on the voice
[20:28] of the earth for you to partake of the
[20:30] warning out there's got to be a mouth or
[20:32] a voice somewhere that declares every
[20:34] word of God and I believe he's already
[20:37] spoken and I believe he's speaking again
[20:39] because the spirit the bride under there
[20:42] messenger will be the final voice to the
[20:45] final age what is the voice speaking his
[20:51] I'm just speaking about blessings he's
[20:53] not just speaking my justification he's
[20:55] speaking about adoption the changing of
[20:58] a body he's speaking about the maturity
[21:01] of the sons and the daughters of God
[21:04] amen
[21:05] so I thank God for profit where would we
[21:08] be I think so many times we'd be trying
[21:11] to figure it out and we'd be there's so
[21:14] many denominations amen
[21:15] I get in trouble for saying that some
[21:17] places then that's like climate change
[21:20] or whatever they were for well first it
[21:22] was a global warming that was cooling
[21:23] whatever it is and they give you this
[21:25] now and I'm not against pollution or for
[21:28] or whatever
[21:28] I'm against pollution I'm not making a
[21:32] political point but here's what I'm
[21:33] trying to say they give you this line
[21:35] 97% of scientists believe in this I'm
[21:38] thinking you can't get 97% of anybody to
[21:41] believe anything unless you tell them
[21:44] the skies blue or something and even
[21:45] there to get some smart Moscow to argue
[21:48] it's ready right now all right whatever
[21:51] you can't get that many people to agree
[21:53] on anything if I take tenure here and
[21:56] ask you what you want on your pizza
[21:57] I'll get 10 different answers hey man
[22:01] how are we gonna come from the charity
[22:03] is that right what was the purpose the
[22:05] Bible toasting Ephesians 4 God gives
[22:08] some apostles some prophets some
[22:11] evangelists some pastors some teachers
[22:14] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[22:16] work of the ministry - we all come into
[22:19] the unity of the faith not a faith or a
[22:23] cream the unity of the faith this is not
[22:28] something that you can produce that's
[22:30] the Catholic chick what we all need to
[22:32] be one not that kind of one but the
[22:35] oneness that can only come from the
[22:36] voice of God in a final generation only
[22:40] God can bring that to pass I can't bring
[22:42] it to pass you can't bring you the past
[22:44] with the Spirit of God in you it's the
[22:47] same spirit that was in a prophet as the
[22:49] same that was in Wesley that was in Paul
[22:53] that Spirit can bring it to pass he said
[22:56] how do you know cuz he's doing it right
[22:58] now
[22:58] he's doing through the message of the
[23:00] hour hey man see God gives them gifts is
[23:04] that right I want you to think about
[23:05] that first begotten son hey man think
[23:07] about Christ where the rest is God's
[23:09] wrapped gift and then he was a wrap gift
[23:12] is for the people messin about if
[23:15] somebody loves you and they give me a
[23:17] gift
[23:17] listen if a father to son asks for bread
[23:20] he ain't gonna give him a stone amen if
[23:23] he asked for for uh for an egg he gonna
[23:25] give him a scorpion if you ask for
[23:28] fishing give him a serpent all right if
[23:30] he gives you a gift it's for your good
[23:32] that's of that rat gift no he was
[23:35] despised by the world
[23:37] no one was calling there is above and
[23:38] the Ellen
[23:39] legitimate child and every other kind of
[23:41] name why because it didn't look like
[23:43] what they were looking for see it was
[23:46] God's wrapped gift he was wrapped in the
[23:47] manger the swaddling cloth listen that
[23:49] gift was wrapped in humanity that's why
[23:53] they couldn't see it
[23:55] amen listen you couldn't see the lives
[23:58] but you can see this flesh which
[24:00] declares it programs that you've never
[24:01] seen me and you'll never see me but
[24:04] you've seen this body which declares the
[24:06] life think about that you've never seen
[24:09] it I've never seen you but we've seen
[24:11] the life though we've known Christ after
[24:13] the flesh yeah henceforth we know him no
[24:16] more we know no man after the flesh see
[24:19] that was the problem they were looking
[24:20] at the man hands and said well I thought
[24:22] he was gonna do this and I thought he's
[24:24] gonna come be a Pharisee or be a
[24:25] Sadducee or tear down the Roman
[24:27] government God's wrapped gifts hey man
[24:37] imagine if I come up to you and I said
[24:38] hey I bought your gift brother I got a
[24:41] box I can't to you and my wrapping job's
[24:43] about like this it looks like a three
[24:45] you'll push together the flaps are
[24:47] sticking up most tape everywhere put a
[24:50] little bow on there it's got like hair
[24:52] and glue and macaroni noodles sticking
[24:55] on it you get that gift you say I don't
[24:59] want to ask this looks terrible I'm not
[25:02] taking the gifts because of what they're
[25:03] wrapping paper looks like and then you
[25:06] take the gift because of what's on the
[25:08] inside
[25:09] they say that person loves me and
[25:11] would've give me a guest it's what's on
[25:13] the inside that determines the value
[25:15] you've got the wrapping paper not on the
[25:18] outside and people they look at Christ
[25:20] as a man and they said well that's an
[25:22] illegitimate child that's a that's the
[25:24] son of Joseph that's a carver and their
[25:26] son that's why they couldn't see the
[25:28] gift what does the gift of not it's
[25:31] eternal life they took eternal life and
[25:34] hung it on a cross because they couldn't
[25:37] see what was on the inside of God's
[25:38] wrapped gift it's all they've done in
[25:41] this generation God sent us a wrap gift
[25:43] in that you know
[25:45] and then there's a gif that come down to
[25:48] the Church of God
[25:49] 19 online I like home over the crew and
[25:51] testified not that he's the son of
[25:53] Charles Ella Branham not that he's a
[25:55] bootlegger Samantha needs a Kentuckian
[25:57] the light come to testify this is my
[25:59] gift to this generation this time not
[26:03] just talking about the discernment I'm
[26:05] talking with the life of Christ before
[26:07] he was in the belly before he was formed
[26:10] he was our digging the prophet to the
[26:12] nation's see it's God's gift to us I can
[26:20] you imagine go up someone gives you that
[26:21] gift you reject all you are but I'd be a
[26:25] little upset I wouldn't spend a lot of
[26:28] money to pull us off I got you this gift
[26:30] because I wrapped it like a
[26:31] three-year-old you don't want it you're
[26:32] just gonna tear it off anyway it's not
[26:35] made to last listen this thing's not
[26:37] made to last why do you worry about it
[26:39] so much it's what's on the inside
[26:44] [Applause]
[26:45] why my listen when crisis center he give
[26:49] gifts unto men it's for your dead I mean
[26:53] not look at the outside don't look at
[26:55] your hey man the humanity look at what
[26:58] it's come to produce its come to produce
[27:00] a unity in the faith one Lord one
[27:03] baptism one faith one God and Father of
[27:07] all who is above us all and through us
[27:09] on in you all
[27:12] Haemon education cannot produce this
[27:15] unity Amen a man's intelligence cannot
[27:19] produce this unity a man's charisma or
[27:21] psychology cannot produce this unity
[27:24] it's impossible with men with men these
[27:27] things are impossible but with God but
[27:31] with God all things are possible one
[27:36] what's he coming to do with the Bible
[27:38] says to bring us into the stature of the
[27:41] fullness of Christ into a perfect name
[27:44] amen not perfect men not perfect sons
[27:47] ours he's talking with the body now one
[27:49] a perfect man
[27:50] that's why prophet is saying it is the
[27:52] rising of the Sun that she has now she
[27:54] is bone of his bone
[27:56] of his word spirit of his spirit powers
[27:59] power
[27:59] she is him they're no longer Twain
[28:03] they're one they've been united by an
[28:07] invisible Union by a marriage covenant
[28:10] the United that's what produces the
[28:12] unity there one spirit yeah it's come to
[28:19] brings into the stature of the fullness
[28:20] of Christ
[28:22] it's Christ amen that's why I said the
[28:24] message is Christ if you receive God's
[28:26] wrapped gift because you can't separate
[28:28] the messenger from the message if you
[28:29] receive God's wrapped gift and what it
[28:32] has to say into your heart it will
[28:33] produce the same thing it asks you
[28:36] because every seed brings forth after
[28:39] its own kind
[28:40] how many have claimed or they say or
[28:42] they associate with the message and
[28:44] that's being able to read but once you
[28:46] receive that gift into your heart it can
[28:49] only produce Christ in other words it's
[28:52] predestinated to come to Christ it has
[28:55] to amen
[28:58] why that we're not children tossed to
[29:00] and fro by everyone to doctrine that's
[29:02] why I said when critics they get all
[29:03] whatever in this now I'm not shaking by
[29:05] that stuff because every something
[29:06] received something greater than a man's
[29:07] opinion I received something rather than
[29:10] just a good teaching I have received a
[29:12] kingdom that cannot be moved objects is
[29:18] that right that's my Paul could say that
[29:20] none of these things move me results
[29:24] familiar friends that turned away didn't
[29:27] move him he knew in whom he had believed
[29:31] he was persuaded there was no height
[29:35] depth nothin present nothing that could
[29:38] poke nothing could separate that man
[29:41] nothing can separate you from the love
[29:44] of God which is in Christ Jesus
[29:48] because it's progressive because of the
[29:51] seed hey man so that's what I'm saying
[29:54] I'm not shaking by I know what the gift
[29:56] of God wasn't my generation cuz I know
[29:58] they'd give me it did what I could not
[30:01] do you can testify this one God has done
[30:05] something in your life your mommy
[30:07] couldn't move daddy couldn't do
[30:09] psychology couldn't do a preacher
[30:11] couldn't do God has done something in
[30:13] your life only God could do and you know
[30:16] is gone and you're not was the message
[30:18] you know what you're talking about you
[30:21] know where you're standing you're on
[30:23] Christ you can't be shaking off of it
[30:26] you plant your feet on the rock he
[30:29] brought you out of the miry clay and set
[30:31] your feet on the rocks
[30:33] when everything's falling apart and the
[30:35] words falling apart you receive the
[30:37] kingdom you're not falling down you're
[30:40] rising up you lift it off the face of
[30:43] the earth not toss to throw we're not
[30:49] you're not all this other stuff
[30:51] this madness and this message will not
[30:54] condemn the Church of the Living God who
[30:56] condemn what calls itself church but
[30:59] it's not coming to destroy God's people
[31:00] it's not coming to cast them off it's
[31:03] not come to give them a partial victory
[31:04] and a hopes on the maybe it has come to
[31:07] reproduce the fullness of Christ in
[31:10] people in this generation not another
[31:15] generator not another message to come in
[31:17] this age if they don't do what this says
[31:21] there's no other one to come it has to
[31:23] be this age hey man his faith his virtue
[31:29] his tent knowledge temperance patience
[31:31] godliness brotherly kindness greater he
[31:42] was looking at last Doorly but now the
[31:43] light or the vindication has come to
[31:46] reveal its to sing Christ oh my all his
[31:50] power of his glory so he ordains nothing
[31:54] less for us has about it hidden the
[31:57] manifestation of Christ in his people
[32:01] no sass his church is that right
[32:02] predestinated individuals that come to
[32:05] the Holy Ghost and they're identified as
[32:08] sons and daughters the church is
[32:09] identified in every age the message is
[32:12] identified the true church and the false
[32:15] because every revival produces twins so
[32:18] the Word of God comes to make a
[32:20] distinction or a separation amen so he's
[32:24] identified the virtue he changed the
[32:26] promise to be changed that his true
[32:28] church he distinguishes now you and I
[32:31] couldn't do that but at the end time
[32:34] according to Matthew 13 it was
[32:35] prophesied that the wheat and the tares
[32:37] they would come to a maturity and in the
[32:41] maturity he makes a distinction listen
[32:43] Wes Eden knows they Luther in Calamba
[32:45] but in this age the voice has identified
[32:49] the true and the false
[32:51] it shows you it's the maturing time
[32:54] because it can't be identified until the
[32:56] maturity hey man so what's the
[33:01] difference between the world and us hey
[33:03] man let's see you're not different
[33:05] because you're smarter than the next
[33:06] person you're not different because you
[33:08] were born into a certain natural home or
[33:10] even because you go to a certain church
[33:11] but what makes you different it's the
[33:13] leadership of God in your life
[33:15] progresses this morning church change
[33:18] says you see the one difference between
[33:20] Israel and the rest of the nations was
[33:23] God put God to one side in Israel was
[33:26] just like any other news listen that's
[33:30] that's why I don't get about these these
[33:32] men maybe they want to preach the
[33:33] message and walk away I said the message
[33:35] made you who you were yeah you think
[33:37] well I can preach without it you have
[33:39] nothing without it you're just like the
[33:41] rest of the world listen I'm not up here
[33:45] that because I'm just so eloquent we're
[33:48] so clever I studied so well God made the
[33:51] difference you're not here today because
[33:54] you're just a good socializer
[33:56] urban Pharisee God made the difference
[34:00] that's the only if without God it's just
[34:03] like the rest of the world
[34:04] he said when Samson cut off his hair he
[34:07] was like any other man boss what he says
[34:11] here put the leadership of the Holy
[34:13] Ghost aside and the church is nothing
[34:16] but the world with God's name attached
[34:18] to it Shh hey burn somebody we're in the
[34:24] devil anyway it's nothing but the world
[34:28] with his name attached to it the world
[34:32] in the church think about is the world
[34:34] in the church or of the same lump listen
[34:38] your lump of clay ain't no better than
[34:39] your neighbors and it's the same along
[34:42] just like Jacob and Esau for the same
[34:45] parents but the Spirit of God makes the
[34:49] difference I want to touch one again
[34:52] what makes a difference he says the
[34:53] Spirit of God makes the difference but I
[34:55] want you knows that's not the only thing
[34:56] you said he said it's the leadership of
[34:58] the Holy Ghost if you put the leadership
[35:01] aside so it's not just the Holy Ghost or
[35:03] an anointing because there's anointed
[35:06] ones even the false Church has
[35:08] anointings
[35:09] and it has gifts the difference is not
[35:11] just the Spirit of God but it's the
[35:13] leadership of the Spirit of God or the
[35:16] leadership of the Holy Ghost amen
[35:18] Esau and Jacob they're the same lump is
[35:20] that right it's what I said
[35:22] think about is out Esau was not an
[35:24] unbeliever hang there for a second Esau
[35:30] was not an unbeliever King brother Brent
[35:33] said was a believer all right Balaam was
[35:38] a believer he even prophesied he was
[35:41] just as fundamental as Moses the Prophet
[35:45] said but he couldn't follow the
[35:47] leadership and God said I want you to do
[35:50] certain things that I'm gonna do my own
[35:51] thing when God told Cain you'd do what
[35:54] your brother did and I'll receive you he
[35:56] couldn't follow the leadership he
[35:59] refused to follow it see he couldn't
[36:02] learn obedience
[36:03] Christ could learn obedience we can
[36:06] learn obedience but they couldn't
[36:08] comment over obedience why so it's the
[36:12] leadership that makes the difference
[36:13] they might have had a blessing Brill
[36:15] Graham talks about Pentecost Pentecost
[36:17] had the baptism the Holy Ghost he said
[36:19] was a type of Esau they had the
[36:21] birthright but they rejected the
[36:23] birthright they sold out Esau had the
[36:26] birthright at one point Pentecost had
[36:28] him at one point but they so much Esau
[36:31] sold out for a mess of pottage amen
[36:33] they sold out to gift from money or fame
[36:36] or popularity or wandering or whatever
[36:38] it is they used to have something but
[36:40] it's not the n-word but it has moved on
[36:42] in the Church of God but Pentecost what
[36:45] they used to have a type of Esau think
[36:48] about this bro Graham says this everyone
[36:50] talks about I was just reading this it
[36:52] is sounding you read these quotes we
[36:53] were talked about he went down and he
[36:55] visited Elvis Elvis Presley's pastor is
[36:58] they talked to his pastor and they said
[36:59] yeah that boy he got the baptism the
[37:01] Holy Ghost of my church said he spoke in
[37:04] tongues program says what is it
[37:06] see he has he had something he had an
[37:09] experience but his experience lead him
[37:12] to the word he was blessed with a gift
[37:15] and anointing but he couldn't submit it
[37:17] to the leadership of God that makes a
[37:21] statement I want you to think about this
[37:23] when a man has a gift like that or
[37:25] something and they don't submit to God
[37:26] it becomes a curse but I said he sent
[37:29] more son or more people to hell than
[37:31] than a bootlegger Joyner something I got
[37:33] all them little girls tearing off their
[37:35] clothes and this and that what was it
[37:36] something that could have blessed the
[37:38] Church of God but because it wasn't
[37:41] under the leadership of God had become a
[37:43] blight or a curse or a reproach
[37:46] he's also not for mesopause brother and
[37:49] so he sold Judas a lot of thirty pieces
[37:50] of silver elvis produce a lot for a
[37:52] fleet of Cadillacs see somewhere they've
[37:54] got a price though but the Church of God
[37:57] the true believer don't have a price
[37:59] they've already been bought with a price
[38:01] they've already been paid for there's no
[38:03] price you can buy them for they've been
[38:06] redeemed
[38:08] the RAM preaches in California preached
[38:10] a message called leadership and I want
[38:12] you to consider how he says this he says
[38:14] this many of you think I got the baptism
[38:17] of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven he
[38:20] says that don't mean one thing that
[38:21] you're going to heaven what he says no
[38:25] sir you can you can have the baptism of
[38:27] the Holy Ghost every hour in your life
[38:30] and still be lost and go to hell now
[38:33] this seems contrary to what we're
[38:36] thinking about but what he's talking
[38:37] about he's having an anointing where the
[38:39] Holy Ghost comes onto people why was a
[38:42] prophet say when he preaches anointed
[38:44] once the end time this could not come to
[38:46] this age because this is the age of
[38:48] maturity that endtime anointing could
[38:52] only come in the time of the harvest
[38:54] there's always been false anointed ones
[38:57] but what he's talking about here at the
[38:59] end of time there has to be a maturity
[39:01] or a harvest to bring in time anointing
[39:04] so it's in that season there's false
[39:07] anointing ones they claim they've
[39:08] dropped the back to the hallways they've
[39:10] got gifts they can prophesy they can do
[39:12] all that jesus said they would he said
[39:15] that comes there where we prophesied
[39:16] your name we did mighty miracles we
[39:18] healed the sick we cast out devils he no
[39:20] naam amen
[39:25] the sorceress catch with this this quote
[39:27] the anointing cannot produce a son or
[39:30] daughter of God amen
[39:32] but it's the control tower or the seed
[39:35] the anointing on that will produce a
[39:38] leadership that will produce a son or
[39:40] daughter of God the anointing by itself
[39:41] will always manifest life but the seed
[39:44] determines what kind of life it is I
[39:47] mean if it rains and it's been raining
[39:49] all day if the season started if we're
[39:50] in spring it sort of grown your weeds
[39:52] would grow up just right with all your
[39:54] whatever you're trying to cultivate the
[39:56] anointing always produces a life or
[39:58] maturity but what kind of life is not
[40:01] determined by the anointing but by the
[40:04] seed that falls on hey men program says
[40:08] this and things that are to be he said
[40:10] if you love the world or the things of
[40:12] the world the love of God is
[40:13] even in there see if she still have the
[40:15] love of the world what to act like the
[40:16] world and do you like the world he said
[40:18] yet you're in church but a cockle burr
[40:21] and the patch with the we shot with the
[40:23] rest of them rejoice with the rest of
[40:25] them all the spiritual blessings is
[40:27] right upon you you say well I promise I
[40:29] so did Caiaphas so did Balaam he says I
[40:33] has nothing he says I got the baptism
[40:35] the Holy Spirit he said that still has
[40:37] nothing to do with it
[40:38] this is powerful watch he says there
[40:39] that's just only a temporal gift for you
[40:43] what he says the real gift is your soul
[40:47] down in there what's the real gift eats
[40:51] your soul down in there see that was
[40:53] born of God and that controls the whole
[40:56] thing to the Word of God and the will
[40:59] that's seen the leadership makes the
[41:01] difference not just anointing but the
[41:03] leadership or the obedience when a
[41:05] person is born of God he's there you
[41:07] grow up said I'll call you to go into a
[41:10] son or daughter hey man I'm mature son
[41:13] or daughter hey man there you grow up
[41:15] see then you're a son or daughter of God
[41:18] your child about these things you come
[41:19] up
[41:20] he's like the mother now you're in the
[41:21] bowels of the earth kind of come forth
[41:23] you're a son of God coming forth and you
[41:26] see the word says I should do this I
[41:28] should be born again amen so what he's
[41:30] talking about this this life or the seed
[41:32] he says that's the real gift amen praise
[41:37] the Lord now listen that determines that
[41:39] you were always a son or daughter of God
[41:42] that's what makes the difference a man
[41:45] now when the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:47] comes he didn't come just to make you
[41:48] speak in tongues although that's fine
[41:50] he didn't come just to make you shout he
[41:52] didn't come just to make you dance he
[41:54] didn't come to make you excited he comes
[41:56] to identify you as a son or daughter God
[42:00] that's what he's come to do today he's
[42:03] identifying you you are now the sons you
[42:06] know the daughters of God that's why can
[42:08] we come with a purpose he didn't just
[42:10] come to entertain us
[42:11] I'll help us people let me never get to
[42:14] a place where were just entertained to
[42:16] be Christians we just come to church to
[42:18] be entertained please come to identify
[42:20] you as a son or a daughter of God
[42:23] now if you're a child if you're a child
[42:26] of God though your son
[42:28] the distinction comes in the maturity
[42:30] amen praise the Lord what's going to
[42:35] produce it the spirit of adoption brings
[42:37] adoption and we talked about adoption in
[42:39] the church what is it it's it's
[42:41] fulfilled in the changing of the body
[42:44] but it's about spiritual adoption
[42:46] Ephesians 1:5 that's not in the rapture
[42:50] sorry honey what listen that's not in
[42:53] the changing of the body that's none the
[42:55] Mullane but before the rapture before
[42:57] your changing the body before these
[43:00] things come to pass there's got to be a
[43:01] spiritual adoption come to church you
[43:04] don't need it in the morning it's not
[43:06] it's this hour right now in this house
[43:10] so how do you know that we've had one
[43:12] come upon a Christmas I won't come to
[43:16] maturity and adopted son of God there's
[43:19] a wave sheaf testified what there's more
[43:21] like him coming right behind it the way
[43:24] she's don't come up in the spring in the
[43:26] rest of the fall it comes up at the time
[43:28] of maturity the Harless we've had an
[43:32] adopted son of God come on the earth and
[43:34] come back and preach the seal to us to
[43:36] let you know this is the hour there's
[43:39] not another one to come this adoption
[43:42] that was prophesied Ephesians 1:5 Romans
[43:45] egg this adoption of the sons of God by
[43:48] the spirit of adoption now is the time
[43:51] it's not out there somewhere else it's
[43:53] not produced by a man's eye these
[43:55] produce right now I see you going for
[43:59] the message believers and you said you
[44:01] believe it's gonna be rapture I believe
[44:02] the shots already come I believe it's
[44:03] taking place right now but you ask them
[44:05] if they can believe for an adoption well
[44:07] I don't know if God could use my god I
[44:08] don't know if I have that kind of
[44:09] character listen I'm not saying if you
[44:11] got faith that there's gonna be a
[44:12] rapture if you're believing that you've
[44:15] got to have faith for a spiritual
[44:17] adoption because one produces the next
[44:20] there's got to be an adopted people he
[44:23] meant somebody the sons and daughters
[44:26] have to come kill my son ship to bring
[44:29] perfection to the rest of the valley
[44:32] what does adoption it's the placing of a
[44:35] sign Amen listen the Holy Ghost when you
[44:38] receive the baptism the Holy Ghost it
[44:39] identified you as a son but the adoption
[44:42] or the placing the son comes you declare
[44:44] your position amen the BAPS of the Holy
[44:48] Ghost declares your position as a part
[44:50] of the body or in the body of Christ but
[44:52] within that body the adoption or the
[44:55] place user shows where you are in that
[44:57] body
[44:58] Amen what your position is in that by
[45:00] just like Joshua Ephesians is paralleled
[45:03] by Joshua when he comes with the people
[45:05] into the Promised Land there in the
[45:07] promised land brother ed said a type of
[45:09] the Holy Ghost
[45:10] there's still Wars Amen somebody listen
[45:13] now they're still getting some ores
[45:14] there's still gonna be some fight you're
[45:16] still gonna have trials but yeah it's
[45:18] your promised land now you're not
[45:20] fighting to get into the Promised One
[45:22] you're fighting for the part that
[45:24] belongs to you
[45:27] this might be my brother's here this and
[45:29] that but I wanna belongs to me I don't
[45:31] want his field I don't want her position
[45:33] God give me like Caleb killed had a
[45:36] possession he knew we belong to him
[45:38] under the prophet Moses and he told
[45:41] Joshua I don't care from 75 I'm just as
[45:44] strong today I'm just as able today I'm
[45:48] just as ready as I was 40 years ago we
[45:50] are still more than able to take the
[45:53] land I don't care if 20 in 30 40 50
[45:57] years of gone live the spirit of
[45:59] adoption is here he can still take you
[46:01] to your possession it's more than just
[46:04] your promise saying he's come to give
[46:05] you your Mountain
[46:07] it's calmly give you the portion that
[46:09] you are identified with hey before all
[46:16] these things listen I don't need don't
[46:18] need adoption the millennium I don't
[46:21] need a new heavens new earth but now in
[46:23] this hour there's got to be a voice of
[46:26] God that's come to maturity there's got
[46:29] to be sons and daughters of God on the
[46:30] road coming up into a spiritual adoption
[46:33] what is it when their voice is the same
[46:35] as God speaking they've got the sample
[46:38] order that keep still they can speak and
[46:41] when they speak it speaks with an
[46:43] 40 because their name on the check it's
[46:45] just as good as daddy's mama the spirit
[46:53] of adoption is bringing individuals the
[46:56] adoption of sons it's bringing it into
[46:58] the church right now praise the Lord
[47:01] so if you have faith for a rapture you
[47:03] should have faith that God will place
[47:05] you it has to be that okay that's what
[47:08] it's what listen the whole creations
[47:09] waiting on it it's growing a travailing
[47:12] weary our selves are going travailing
[47:15] waiting for what the manifestation of
[47:18] the sons of God hey man we're all it's
[47:25] all waiting on it amen
[47:26] but I probably could say that your birth
[47:28] is not your adoption like I said the
[47:31] birth positions you in the body of
[47:32] Christ but within the body the adoption
[47:35] places you as an individual within the
[47:38] body of Christ amen that's why I said oh
[47:41] it's one thing to be born into a family
[47:42] that's another thing to give birth it's
[47:45] another thing to reproduce the same life
[47:47] in the maturity that's when that comes I
[47:50] only say this way Abraham was told that
[47:52] he would be blessed he would be a
[47:54] blessing a mess one thing to be blessed
[47:57] it's knowing when you become a blessing
[47:59] see the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[48:02] life will make you a blessing
[48:04] unlike Elvis Presley the leadership is
[48:06] what makes you a blessing it's one thing
[48:09] to be in the family something to come to
[48:11] maturity praise the Lord
[48:13] where the RAM says this the servant
[48:16] spiritual adoption are you falling all
[48:18] right I hope hope I'm not trying to go
[48:19] too fast but you could you kid well
[48:21] brother been preached for parts on this
[48:23] you could make this you could do this
[48:25] all day long but just trying to kind of
[48:27] hit the highlights but brother Ram says
[48:28] this is spiritual adopt she said if the
[48:31] child had not been obedient when it
[48:33] becomes of maturity the age of maturity
[48:35] and I want you think about this no
[48:37] matter how old be this would mean that
[48:39] that child is he's growing all the time
[48:41] and man your son becomes 18 whether he's
[48:44] learning to be a man or not he's an
[48:46] adult on the eyes of the law we've got a
[48:48] lot of kids run around 30 40 years old
[48:50] they're still kids
[48:51] they've never that's true you got more
[48:54] room in there now than ever
[48:55] and six I'm gonna get trouble for this
[48:57] one sixteen-year-old boys used to storm
[48:59] a beach the overflowed over fight
[49:02] overthrow tyranny in Germany they used
[49:05] to strongly be sixteen years old
[49:06] I know a man messes preacher he lied
[49:08] when he was a little boy about his age
[49:10] just to go fight the enemy and now you
[49:12] got to give him safe space you don't
[49:14] know what gender he is you don't know
[49:15] this you don't know if he's a boy or
[49:17] girl he's up or down
[49:18] she's a meal I don't know I don't know
[49:20] he is man they're so conceited it's the
[49:23] age it's the spirit of confusion but I
[49:26] want you to remember God is not the
[49:28] author of confusion he's the author of
[49:30] peace there's got to be a voice with the
[49:33] vindicated identification that comes
[49:37] into maturity a man so there's an age of
[49:39] maturity it's not Luthor or Wesley this
[49:41] is the age of maturity it's in the age
[49:44] of maturity you determine whether that
[49:46] sons gonna inherit or not see Pentecost
[49:50] can inherit it fell off Wesley can't
[49:53] hear it Luthor can't inherit all these
[49:54] that they can't inherit but in the age
[49:56] of maturity there's some predestinated
[49:58] sons they're not your legitimate
[50:00] children now but they can they can
[50:02] receive chastisement because it's for
[50:04] their good because it's going to produce
[50:07] the listen let me say this right the
[50:09] leadership of the Holy Ghost will
[50:11] produce the character of Christ
[50:14] character is not a gift it's a victory
[50:17] but the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[50:20] will produce the character of Christ of
[50:22] you that's why when you go through
[50:24] trials you don't respond like the
[50:26] restaurant that's why when you're
[50:27] tempted you can resist temptation the
[50:29] leadership of the Holy Ghost produces
[50:31] the character of Christ he says this and
[50:36] the age maturity says the son is always
[50:37] a son certainly but it loses something
[50:40] and here's the point I want to drive
[50:42] home may the Holy Spirit take it to
[50:45] every heart of you believers just
[50:47] because you're a believer certainly have
[50:49] everlasting life God said so but would
[50:51] you just want to get in as Jobe said by
[50:53] the skin of your teeth what you just
[50:55] want to come before the Father in the
[50:56] town that he's given every one of you as
[50:58] being negligent you just didn't use it
[51:00] or let something else stand your way you
[51:02] let little petty things that meant
[51:04] nothing to you after all little fusses
[51:07] and stews and arguments and church
[51:08] differences
[51:09] take the meekness and gentleness from
[51:11] your life would you want to stand before
[51:13] the father like that he says I don't
[51:15] believe you would I don't believe it you
[51:17] would do it neither would i amen
[51:19] see they could get away when a child I
[51:22] was using this example that my son had
[51:24] to go I was saying this example that I
[51:27] said I've got a four year old son and he
[51:30] the other kids they're older than he
[51:32] wanted why does he get away with so much
[51:34] and I have to remind him you got away
[51:36] with that when you were his age but
[51:38] you're more mature now listen if if my
[51:41] son if he's four and he makes a mess
[51:43] it's not the same as if my 11 year old
[51:45] makes the mess say at some point if he
[51:48] doesn't mature in his character if it
[51:50] doesn't match his growth there's
[51:52] something wrong so there's got to be a
[51:54] character to match the level of maturity
[51:56] that we're in today if my son's 11 and
[52:00] he acts like he's five we got bad news
[52:02] but if he was 11 he acts like he's 11 or
[52:05] 12 or 13 we were looking for the
[52:07] character of maturity because at some
[52:09] point he's gonna have to be able to say
[52:12] this speak the word and say it just like
[52:14] I said you take over the father's
[52:15] business as you would a men so he's
[52:18] looking to see if they that's why I
[52:20] listen that's why I Luther could get
[52:21] away with persecuting the Jews and and
[52:23] smoking that's why I could get away with
[52:24] these things under Wesley
[52:26] it wasn't the age of maturity you don't
[52:29] expect as much from a little child but
[52:31] in the age of maturity we have to come
[52:33] to the fullness of the word it's no
[52:35] longer optional it's so longer just a
[52:38] measure but we've come to the maturity
[52:40] of it amen that's why he says like I
[52:42] love up for the bread news example job
[52:44] there by the skinnier teeth I think
[52:46] about job listen God was boasting on
[52:49] Joad his character and what happy one
[52:53] God boasted on jobs character
[52:55] he went through the worst trials life
[52:57] that seems so contrite us we just
[53:00] thought he'd been flying around their
[53:01] big old palace and this not but it's
[53:04] when gob became to Moses character he
[53:06] went through the tribes life but God
[53:09] give him a consolation in the midst of
[53:12] that trial
[53:13] he knew the
[53:14] my flesh I shall see God though the skin
[53:17] worms eat up this body yeah I will see
[53:20] him stand upon the earth
[53:22] he needed the sacrifice the he had
[53:25] offered was right no matter what people
[53:28] said or they accuse enough he knew that
[53:30] he'd come into meetings of the world and
[53:32] he imagined I probably said this before
[53:35] but he imagined joke knew ahead of time
[53:37] what God was saying about you might have
[53:38] you read Joe one before he went through
[53:40] his trials his treatise tries a lot
[53:43] different here the hold man God's
[53:46] on me I got him up there in
[53:48] Heaven's and go son go he'll not reject
[53:50] me he'll not denominator thing he didn't
[53:53] know all that he had no idea that the
[53:57] worst trials of his life was because he
[54:00] had the right kind of character and then
[54:03] not making it by the Skinit and that was
[54:04] his consolation got restored tuefel to
[54:07] him everything let him know never a
[54:09] demon but what a consolation you and I
[54:11] have in this age to know that God has
[54:14] said not just that he's going to bless
[54:16] us or forgive us some great anointing
[54:19] but he's bringing us to the adoption of
[54:22] sons and daughters of God big trials are
[54:25] not just there to make you feel bad
[54:26] they're not there to make you down it's
[54:29] there for the perfecting of your
[54:30] character this is something you might
[54:33] have went through things this year you
[54:35] never thought you'd want through in your
[54:36] whole life you might have dealt with
[54:38] things I don't know everybody's
[54:39] situation but you might be going through
[54:40] the trial of your life right now and
[54:42] said what is it all bad but I want you
[54:45] to consider there's a god up in heaven
[54:46] he's boasting today on the sons and
[54:49] daughters of God these are my sons
[54:53] these are my daughters they believe the
[54:56] message they've not been shaken by
[54:57] detractors they've not been carried
[54:59] about by winds of doctrine they're not
[55:01] moved with everybody else in the world
[55:02] they say the word they identify with
[55:05] sword and no matter what they go through
[55:07] they're not
[55:09] they're not coming just to reveal where
[55:11] they cannot be shaking off this rock
[55:15] [Applause]
[55:18] they believe that ah God can make away
[55:22] from them even when there's no way
[55:23] because they've seen God far they've
[55:26] seen a manifest in his word they know
[55:28] he's the same
[55:29] oh what a conservation you know the
[55:40] God's up there saying this is my son
[55:43] this is my daughter here you him hear
[55:47] what they had to say I'm going to put a
[55:49] voice of spiritual authority in them I
[55:52] can give them the kingdom listen God has
[55:56] whole hallelujah I meant what's the real
[55:58] gift it's that soul in there that
[56:00] control that's what God's got confidence
[56:02] in today he didn't have confidence in
[56:04] the stony tablets they were produced the
[56:06] life amen
[56:07] here's have confidence in Ezekiel
[56:09] Camilla tour these are that but the life
[56:11] of Christ in you who has confidence of
[56:14] saying I can give you my kingdom and I
[56:17] know you'll have the character I want
[56:23] you think about this because we get this
[56:24] this comic book superhero idea of
[56:26] adoption amen and then we think well I'm
[56:29] gonna adopt it somehow I'm going to do
[56:30] this and I'm gonna move back storms i'ma
[56:32] speak school well you might do all that
[56:33] but I didn't know one thing's for sure
[56:35] you're gonna have trials you're gonna go
[56:38] through things listen when Jesus when he
[56:39] goes up on Mount Transfiguration what's
[56:41] the very next thing he does he comes off
[56:43] the mountain he starts heading towards
[56:45] Jerusalem now he's ready to be offered
[56:48] and then listen here's an adopted son
[56:51] and he goes up to Calvary his own
[56:55] disciples that rejected him the cipher
[56:58] dishes betrayed him the father has
[57:01] forsaken him and turned his back on him
[57:04] so much that he sweat great drops of
[57:08] blood for you and I
[57:09] but yeah there was a character on
[57:11] display that he would say not my will
[57:15] but thine be done that's what pleases
[57:21] the father he could have called for
[57:24] angels he could have done all these
[57:26] things not my will whatever really
[57:29] forsaken him what he was suffering like
[57:32] no man had ever suffered it would even
[57:34] the father for sayin
[57:35] not my will that I will be done I mean
[57:42] you think about a prophet we talk about
[57:43] miracles we can talk about prayer lines
[57:45] but here's an adopted son of God they
[57:48] come back from out west and what's he
[57:50] doing preaches the opening senses I'm
[57:52] probably lose almost all my friends for
[57:53] this here's an adopted son of God he's
[57:56] dealt with stomach trouble most of his
[57:58] life student deals another one here and
[58:00] a half two years stomach trouble his
[58:01] life hidden opposite of God going on to
[58:04] out less Arizona tell the people airing
[58:07] the door open for me to preach air
[58:09] here's an adopted son of God rejected at
[58:12] the end of his ministry in so let's say
[58:15] he even got a complex and lost his
[58:17] feeling for the people this time time
[58:21] I've got my mature son yeah its
[58:23] complexes with trials with rejection see
[58:28] we thought we were all gonna get away
[58:29] from all that stuff not in this body or
[58:32] no hush it was at that time he goes to
[58:35] the greatest rejections is like the
[58:37] greatest trials the greatest suffering
[58:39] yet though is a character in him God had
[58:44] rested with him and then that he had had
[58:46] to always make new things always had to
[58:47] lead them but he there's a character in
[58:49] that man that he could get to a place
[58:51] where God could testify a back son
[58:53] because you have chosen you chose the
[58:58] hard way it was your choice you made
[59:01] that decision
[59:02] cuz the right leadership is in you
[59:04] therefore great portion of heaven awaits
[59:06] you
[59:09] beside know a lot of people there's a
[59:12] couple making out on the front row like
[59:13] of the prophets means and the voice book
[59:15] said whatever you say it'll be
[59:18] they'd blow up or catch on fire turn to
[59:20] tones or something but there was a
[59:22] character in that man's life what's
[59:25] gonna watch this now what does he say
[59:27] Father forgive them
[59:34] that's what the son said on the cross as
[59:38] it always produces the same thing Father
[59:41] forgive them they don't know what
[59:43] they're doing
[59:44] hey man I'm coming down to eat listen
[59:47] adop's is more than just signs and
[59:48] wonders and miracles you can have that
[59:50] with an anointing and not have the
[59:52] leadership the leadership will produce
[59:55] as I said the character of Christ every
[59:57] time it has to he can't lead you
[1:00:01] anywhere else
[1:00:02] he didn't predestinate several options
[1:00:04] to you he pretend they said
[1:00:06] predestinated one son conform to one
[1:00:09] image that's why the Bible says that he
[1:00:11] gave these gifts in the manner that we
[1:00:12] would grow up into him in what all
[1:00:15] things somebody say that would be all
[1:00:17] things not just a portion not just a
[1:00:21] measure but all that wasn't God we
[1:00:23] poured into Christ and all that was in
[1:00:26] Christ he has now poured into this ride
[1:00:29] everything that Adam lost has been
[1:00:32] restored to you in that life and that
[1:00:37] seat is there everything you need for
[1:00:39] your journey is in you in the Holy Ghost
[1:00:42] why because he's quick in the scene
[1:00:44] every leaf every branch every bit of SAP
[1:00:47] it's all in the scene even the rapture
[1:00:50] oh my prophet says this his adoption
[1:01:00] placing positionally where are they at
[1:01:02] show me where they're had God calling
[1:01:05] his children aside by manifestation they
[1:01:09] don't have to say one word about it you
[1:01:11] see something's happening I like that
[1:01:13] they don't have to tell you know I can
[1:01:18] tell when a man or a woman
[1:01:20] listen I've managed the restaurants
[1:01:21] before in this that I can tell another
[1:01:24] manager something they get in sync here

[1:01:26] everybody hang on the boss here I'm the
[1:01:28] manager listen if you got Authority

[1:01:32] five minutes here no I'm a son of God
[1:01:34] I'm a believer listen your life will
[1:01:36] testify hey man when God identified
[1:01:40] Christ he was a man approved of God the
[1:01:43] father's by signs and wonders your
[1:01:45] testified of his gifts God testified who
[1:01:47] he was
[1:01:48] she said I'm not done that bore witness
[1:01:50] of myself the father has borne witness
[1:01:52] of Who I am
[1:01:53] listen if you've got a maturity if you
[1:01:56] know where your sin you ain't got to
[1:01:58] tell everybody who I'm gonna darken so
[1:02:01] I'm the best believer in church man I
[1:02:04] wish everybody get on my level
[1:02:08] yeah that's maturity around the boss
[1:02:11] here listen you got to tell somebody it
[1:02:13] means you don't believe yourself that's
[1:02:16] what I means Amen listen when you know
[1:02:19] where you're at and you said God
[1:02:20] identifies you got to brag to everybody
[1:02:23] it will bear witness of itself you don't
[1:02:27] have to broadcast it amen it's like as a
[1:02:29] minister if I've got it if I'm called as
[1:02:31] a minister and I've got a gift my eye I
[1:02:33] shouldn't have to convince you

[1:02:52] groundcar pastor
[1:02:54] praise God that's God's gift to you hey
[1:02:58] men praise the Lord
[1:03:00] listen obedience is the duty of the son
[1:03:03] and an option but the placing of a son
[1:03:06] or adoption that's the father's duty
[1:03:08] amen
[1:03:08] we're not here because some people
[1:03:10] preach adoption that way we got to do
[1:03:11] this and do that that's not what we're
[1:03:13] talking about but I should recognize
[1:03:15] this is the season for it you think the
[1:03:17] things you're going through and the
[1:03:18] things that you deal with the blessings
[1:03:20] in your life and the trials in your life
[1:03:22] they're bringing forth a maturing you
[1:03:24] that's not been seen on the face of the
[1:03:25] earth since the 60s in one man since the
[1:03:29] before then the shores of Galilee it's
[1:03:30] gonna produce it not in just one but in
[1:03:33] a body of believers
[1:03:36] amen so what's the real gift it's that
[1:03:39] song I'm talking about God's wrapped
[1:03:42] gifts amen leave God sense a right to
[1:03:44] give for this generation I'm not talking
[1:03:46] about just the discernment I'm not just
[1:03:47] talking about prophesy that man's life I
[1:03:50] mean he sent some apostles prophets he
[1:03:53] didn't send them us the gift of apostles
[1:03:54] and the gift of prophets the gift of the
[1:03:56] man is the gift that man is a gift to
[1:04:02] you for your maturity amen
[1:04:06] your pastor is a gift to you for your
[1:04:10] the man is it yes and then if the man
[1:04:13] says in this publish that God called man
[1:04:14] that's a gift to you for you it's to
[1:04:17] dress the bride is that right now listen
[1:04:19] I know they're athlete's paper don't
[1:04:20] look like much but if the gift is there
[1:04:23] it's for your good a man but what I want
[1:04:25] you understand
[1:04:26] that's not just the ministry that's not
[1:04:28] just William Branham he's talking about
[1:04:30] you this is where I want to come down to
[1:04:32] today
[1:04:32] God's wrapped gifts God's got many gifts
[1:04:36] that solely placed in you if you're
[1:04:38] believer this morning he predestinated

[1:05:07] gift to this 2019 generation they sure
[1:05:10] don't deserve it it's not a reward
[1:05:12] you're a gift that's why there's mercy
[1:05:15] here today God will not judge the
[1:05:18] unrighteous with the righteous so
[1:05:21] there's mercy today because God's got
[1:05:23] some rap gifts now I don't know what

[1:06:26] generation God's had other abuse but
[1:06:28] you're the wrap gift that God sent in

[1:07:02] same life and listen you've got to come

[1:07:52] special Olivia so they've at or whatever
[1:07:55] many times people in church they have

[1:08:57] but the real gift that real gift is that
[1:09:01] soul that person that's who the real
[1:09:04] that that's not the wrapping that's not
[1:09:05] who there it's the one on the inside
[1:09:07] it's an attribute of God that's been
[1:09:10] quickened to come to maturity along with
[1:09:14] you so why don't you stand your feet I
[1:09:16] won't preach part
