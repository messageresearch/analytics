[36:21] um I don't know who asked that but I

[36:42] doing things I was looking at my notes
[36:43] this morning and stuff and and then I
[36:45] looked at this I thought well this just
[36:46] ties in beautifully so it it's it's the
[36:49] mind of Christ and I just thank God for
[36:51] it and so I'll try my best
[36:54] um my throat's been a little
[36:56] raspy here the last couple days and so I
[36:59] had some hot coffee this morning and
[37:00] stuff and I know you're interested in my
[37:02] life story so I'll tell you this real
[37:04] quick
[37:05] um you know when I started out I
[37:06] actually started out song leading before
[37:08] I started preaching and I would get up
[37:10] and sing and I was just as nervous as
[37:11] could be and I've made such a fool of
[37:13] myself so many times now it doesn't
[37:15] bother me anymore but
[37:17] um
[37:19] um I would get up to sing and my throat
[37:20] would just close up like oh that's awful
[37:22] I can't hardly get anything out of my
[37:24] voice and so I would start I before I
[37:27] get up to song that I get this big cup
[37:28] of ice water first I start with the
[37:30] water fountain got some cold water and
[37:31] then I'd get a big cup and the more of
[37:33] this water I chug before I'd sing it the
[37:35] worse so again I just of course I'm an
[37:37] idiot I don't know nothing so
[37:40] um and so I went to a wedding one day
[37:42] and the brother's getting ready to sing
[37:43] and this other brothers tell me yeah his
[37:45] throat's been bothering he's been
[37:46] drinking hot water and tea all morning
[37:47] I'm like what's he doing that for he
[37:49] said well it opens up your throat I said
[37:51] oh I didn't know that I said yeah you
[37:53] never want to drink a much cold water
[37:54] before you sing
[37:58] all right you live and learn I guess so
[38:02] um so I made sure to do that here and so
[38:04] you you know you learn as you go on but
[38:05] anyway we'll try to sing this song this
[38:07] morning Lord help me and I I don't know
[38:09] I think we're gonna do it in a flat I
[38:10] don't know what you if you do it in
[38:11] something normally a flat
[38:13] I don't
[38:15] pray that well hopefully you know this
[38:16] one
[38:17] here we go
[38:18] amen pray the Lord bless you today
[38:21] as I kneel in the darkness in the middle
[38:27] of the night Lord I'm praying for

[38:34] everything's gonna be all right
[38:38] Lord I see another battle

[38:46] I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go
[38:51] down in defeat but he said and do you
[38:56] remember
[38:58] it's where I brought you from won't you
[39:03] take a look behind you and see how far
[39:08] you've come
[39:11] and every time you ask me did it I
[39:16] deliver you
[39:18] so why would you be thinking that I
[39:23] wouldn't see you through
[39:29] [Music]

[41:49] days is not that long

[42:38] wouldn't fall and didn't I leave all of
[42:43] Heaven just to die before your sins I
[42:49] searched until I found you and I do it
[42:54] all again and did it I walk on the water
[42:59] and I calm the Raging Sea
[43:04] I spoke to the wind and it hushed and I
[43:10] gave you peace and
[43:15] I heard you where you called oh I walked
[43:21] right beside you just so you wouldn't
[43:26] fall and didn't I leave all of Heaven

[43:45] oh thank you Jesus Oh Hallelujah he's
[43:49] worthy today just give him praise amen
[43:54] I made sure to lose the top button there
[43:56] before I started that one so praise the
[43:58] Lord no God is gracious I love that song
[44:00] it just has so much meaning because uh
[44:03] we've all been there and that's why
[44:05] we're here amen thank God for that amen
[44:07] we thank God for his grace and mercy if
[44:10] you have your Bibles this morning I
[44:11] invite you to stand with me for the
[44:13] reading of the word
[44:15] we're gonna look at the Nehemiah the
[44:17] sixth chapter
[44:21] Nehemiah the sixth chapter
[44:24] and before we read I just would like to
[44:26] ask you to Bow your heads with me as we
[44:28] look to the author of this word let's
[44:31] just pray
[44:33] gracious Heavenly Father you're worthy
[44:36] today we cried in our hearts Abba Father
[44:38] we thank you that you've been a father
[44:41] to us you're a father to the fatherless
[44:43] you're a you're a brother to those
[44:45] without a brother Lord when we were in
[44:47] our need when we were in that situation
[44:49] when our ship was sinking in the storms
[44:52] of life you were there for us Lord we
[44:55] didn't realize that the whole time you
[44:56] were in the ship but one day we heard an
[44:59] eagle Scream one day we had a revelation
[45:01] it was Christ in us the hope of glory
[45:04] and Lord your desire in each of Our
[45:06] Lives that you would be glorified and we
[45:09] just asked today Lord that we as we come
[45:12] and we submit ourselves to this purpose
[45:15] that you would indeed be glorified in
[45:17] each vessel here
[45:19] Lord we love you with all of our hearts
[45:22] and we just ask Lord that you would just
[45:24] be blessed in the midst of your people
[45:26] Lord you've done so much for us may we
[45:29] just give our our hearts and our
[45:30] attention now and and just punctuate
[45:33] your word with the amen and and believe
[45:35] with all of our hearts Lord everything
[45:36] you've done you've done for us you've
[45:38] been gracious to us and father I just
[45:41] ask now this scripture as it's read may
[45:44] you give inspiration May the spirit of
[45:46] wisdom and Revelation and understanding
[45:48] may it bless these people Lord maybe
[45:51] there's one today that's going through
[45:52] the storm of Life Lord it seems like
[45:55] many times we go from one trial to
[45:57] another trial but Lord You've ordained
[45:58] us to be changed from Glory unto glory
[46:01] and we're trusting as all things work
[46:03] together for our good that you would
[46:05] take preeminence in each situation here
[46:07] today and each life and that you would
[46:10] magnify Your Great Name to people that
[46:12] love you and they've submitted to you
[46:14] Lord without you we can do nothing
[46:18] but we're not without you today you
[46:20] promise to be with us you promised that
[46:22] if we would abide in you that you would
[46:24] bring these things to pass and we we
[46:26] confessed today and we believe for each
[46:28] believer here that we can do all things
[46:31] through Christ who strengthens us and
[46:35] now we just ask you to bless this word
[46:37] bless this time may you may you be a
[46:40] dissolver of doubts today
[46:42] may you answer the unanswered questions
[46:44] today may you lend strength to the weak
[46:46] today may you strengthen the weak hands
[46:49] may you confirm the feeble knees and
[46:52] following all these things we ask that
[46:53] you would come and do that which only
[46:54] you can do Lord you're a God that does
[46:57] the impossible and we believe you're for
[46:59] it now and we thank you in Jesus
[47:01] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[47:04] Nehemiah the sixth chapter
[47:06] we're just going to read the the whole
[47:08] chapter so praise the Lord for that I am
[47:12] uh let's see here Nehemiah the sixth
[47:14] chapter
[47:16] I I probably make I probably make this
[47:18] statement every time but I really like
[47:19] the book of Nehemiah that's probably why
[47:21] I named my first child Nehemiah but um
[47:23] it's a really good book you should read
[47:25] it actually the whole thing's really
[47:26] good if you haven't read it so I'll
[47:29] praise the Lord uh Nehemiah the sixth
[47:31] chapter it says here and so
[47:33] um for those that are not familiar maybe
[47:35] just to catch us up real quick of course
[47:37] Nehemiah has returned to Jerusalem he's
[47:39] there to rebuild the walls he's gathered
[47:41] the people together and he's encountered
[47:43] some opposition and the opposition has
[47:44] been unsuccessful thus far in stopping
[47:48] the work so now they resort to the same
[47:52] thing the devil tries to resort to he
[47:53] knows he can't stop you so he just tries
[47:54] to scare you away from it
[47:56] so the end is going to try to put some
[47:57] fear in Nehemiah here and uh verse 1
[48:01] here it says now it came to pass when
[48:03] sambala and tobiah and guess from the
[48:05] Arabian and the rest of our enemies
[48:06] heard that I had builted the wall and
[48:09] that there was no breach left therein
[48:10] though at that time I had not set up the
[48:13] doors upon the gates Sandlot and gesham
[48:16] sent unto me saying come let us meet
[48:18] together in some one of the villages in
[48:20] the plain of Ono but they thought to do
[48:23] me mischief
[48:24] and I sent Messengers unto them saying I
[48:26] am doing a good a great work so that I
[48:30] cannot come down why should the work
[48:32] cease whilst I leave it and come down to
[48:35] you you gotta learn to prioritize amen I
[48:38] don't have time to argue with the Enemy
[48:39] I'm doing something really important
[48:40] you're doing something important right
[48:42] now hey man this is not our work this is
[48:44] a great work this is God's work we spend
[48:46] too much time fussing with the Enemy
[48:48] just tell me you know I ain't got time
[48:50] for this and nobody got time for that
[48:52] amen praise the Lord so he just just
[48:55] turns him down yet they sent unto me
[48:57] four times after this sort
[49:00] and notice what he does and I answered
[49:01] them after the same manner
[49:04] praise the Lord then since samblot his
[49:06] servant unto me in like matter the fifth
[49:08] time with an open letter in his hand
[49:10] wherein was written it is reported among
[49:12] the Heathen and gasmus saith that thou
[49:15] and the Jews think to Rebel for which
[49:18] cause thou buildest the wall that thou
[49:20] mayest be their King according to these
[49:22] words and thou Hast also appointed
[49:24] prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem
[49:27] saying there is a king in Judah and now
[49:30] it shall be reported to the king
[49:32] according to these words come now
[49:34] therefore and let us take counsel
[49:36] together
[49:38] then I said unto him saying there are no
[49:40] such things done as thou sayest but thou
[49:44] faintest them out of thine own heart
[49:46] just making it up and you know it
[49:50] notice for they all made us afraid
[49:52] saying their hands shall be weakened
[49:54] from the work that it be not done now
[49:58] therefore o God strengthen my hands in
[50:02] other words if he don't want me to do it
[50:03] I'm going to pray God helps me do it
[50:04] anymore
[50:06] hey man that's just how I feel about us
[50:07] how he felt about it amen afterward I
[50:10] came under the house of shamaya the son
[50:12] of Delia the son of Matthew
[50:15] who was shut up and he said so notice
[50:18] he's got somebody else now let us meet
[50:20] together in the house of God within the
[50:22] temple and let us shut the doors of the
[50:24] temple for they will come to slavey yay
[50:27] in the night will they come to slavery
[50:29] and I said praise God and I said should
[50:33] should such a man as I flee and who is
[50:36] it that being as I am would go into the
[50:39] temple to save his life I will not go in
[50:42] and lo I perceive that God had not sent
[50:45] him but that he pronounced this prophecy
[50:48] against me for tobiah and sambot had
[50:51] hired him there's the hireling amen
[50:53] therefore was he higher than I should be
[50:55] afraid and do so and sin and that they
[50:58] might have matter for an evil report
[51:00] that they might reproach me my God think
[51:03] that upon tobiah and Samba according to
[51:05] these their works and on the prophetess
[51:07] no diet and the rest of the prophets
[51:09] that would have put me in fear they
[51:11] would have
[51:12] that means they were unsuccessful praise
[51:14] the Lord
[51:15] notice now they're they're trying to
[51:17] scare fear-mongering it doesn't work
[51:19] verse 15 so the wall was finished Amen
[51:22] in the 20th and fifth day of the month
[51:24] ilu ilu in 15 two days and it came to
[51:28] pass when all our enemies heard thereof
[51:30] and all the Heathen that were about us
[51:32] saw these things they were much cast
[51:34] down in their own eyes for they
[51:37] perceived that this work was wrought of
[51:40] our God moreover in those days the
[51:43] Nobles of Judah sent many letters into
[51:45] tobiah and the letters of tobiah came
[51:47] unto them for there were many in Judas
[51:50] sworn unto him because he was the
[51:51] son-in-law of Shekinah the son of ARA
[51:54] and his son johanan had taken the
[51:56] daughter of Miss shulum the son of
[51:58] barakaya and they reported his Good
[52:00] Deeds before me and uttered my words to
[52:02] him and tobiah sent letters to put me in
[52:06] fear may the Lord bless their reading
[52:07] this word you may be seated
[52:11] so propaganda is not a new thing
[52:14] amen that stuff enemy's been doing that
[52:18] for thousands of years but you know what
[52:19] when you know where you're at in the
[52:21] Lord You're not moved by those things
[52:22] amen
[52:24] um I'd like to take for my thoughts
[52:25] today
[52:27] I'm trying to tie this all in together
[52:28] the herald of a greater world of course
[52:31] I preached a different couple parts
[52:33] about the greater world but I want to
[52:34] talk today about the herald of a greater
[52:36] world and as I start out here I I think
[52:39] it's important to go back to the
[52:40] beginning and look at what something we
[52:42] talk about a lot but uh you look at um
[52:45] the first uh book of the Bible in the
[52:47] first chapter you look at Genesis and
[52:49] and when God made man he made him for a
[52:51] great work amen he purposed them for a
[52:53] certain thing that he was to have
[52:55] dominion over the works of his hands he
[52:57] was to multiply and to replenish the
[52:59] Earth and God makes the decree let us
[53:01] make man in our own image after our own
[53:04] the likeness let him have dominion over
[53:07] the Earth and that brother Ram talks
[53:08] about this at length many different
[53:09] places he talks about his Revelation
[53:11] Series in 1961. he talks about it later
[53:14] when he's preaching the seals but he
[53:16] makes this point Adam he he knowingly
[53:18] and he willingly forfeits his right to
[53:20] life and his fellowship and his
[53:23] inheritance in the Bible tells us that
[53:25] through one man sin entered into the
[53:27] world and death by sin and so Brother
[53:30] Bear makes the point it was Satan that
[53:31] held the keys of hell and death amen for
[53:34] for thousands of years he had the keys
[53:36] of hell and death but Satan never
[53:38] actually had dominion over the Earth or
[53:40] he never possessed what we would call
[53:42] the book of redemption why because only
[53:44] a man could take the book of redemption
[53:46] it wasn't ordained to be in the hands of
[53:48] a spirit or an angel and so when when
[53:51] man fell from his position of dominion
[53:54] brother Brown makes the point that book
[53:56] of redemption it goes back into the
[53:58] hands of the original owner amen
[54:01] so brother Brown makes the point that's
[54:03] no disregard to the angels Gabriel was
[54:05] maybe worthy or Michael but the Earth
[54:07] was never given to Angels it was given
[54:09] as part of the inheritance to men to you
[54:12] and I amen so that's why Satan could
[54:15] never take it it had to be a man that
[54:17] possessed it now Satan's not ignorant of
[54:19] this he understands that he can't
[54:20] possess it himself so this is the very
[54:23] reason he chooses to work through the
[54:25] agency of a serpent to engineer the fall
[54:28] of Man because he knew if he could
[54:30] inject himself into Humanity
[54:33] the one that was ordained to have the
[54:34] book if he can inject himself into
[54:36] humanity and keep them from possessing
[54:39] the book he doesn't have to possess the
[54:41] book himself he just has to stop man
[54:43] from possessing it as long as he can as
[54:46] he can stop man from possessing the book
[54:48] if he can stop God's promise from coming
[54:51] to pass that's as good as he needs
[54:53] so Satan knows he can't possess it but
[54:55] he's he's trying to stop man from taking
[54:58] it because remember in the beginning it
[55:00] was his desire not to usurp a kingdom
[55:03] but to set up his own kingdom he wanted
[55:06] his own kingdom he wanted to be like the
[55:07] the sons of the most high he wanted to
[55:09] set it up on the North Hill and do all
[55:11] these things so the brother Brian makes
[55:13] the point that uh you know Satan was
[55:15] almost co-equal with God and everything
[55:17] but as a creator
[55:19] and he actually makes the point in 1958
[55:21] if if Satan was a Creator he would just
[55:24] go speak his own world in existence and
[55:26] go live on it
[55:27] so he he lacks this creative potential
[55:30] which by the way you have today
[55:33] remember that you have it it's in your
[55:35] tongue death and life are in the power
[55:37] of your tongue you can create an
[55:39] atmosphere you could actually go create
[55:41] a world if there wasn't a law of faith
[55:43] that was stopping you so God didn't
[55:45] ordained for us to go rule another world
[55:47] any more than he ordained for this world
[55:50] to belong to Satan he ordained this
[55:52] world for you to live in him and that's
[55:54] why he's not going to let you make
[55:56] another one or speak another one God
[55:58] said this is yours this is your
[56:00] inheritance this is your possession quit
[56:03] having a Wishful idea that I'm gonna go
[56:05] live somewhere in the buy and buy and
[56:07] I'm going to do this God has ordained us
[56:09] to rule and Reign on this Earth
[56:11] when you and I pass on if the Lord would
[56:14] tarry and we go to another dimension
[56:15] we're not just staying in heaven we're
[56:17] going to return one day to this earth
[56:19] not in the condition it's in now but a
[56:22] renovated Earth not the not a different
[56:24] love of clay but the same one done over
[56:26] the same one redeemed and a new heavens
[56:29] and a new Earth and that's where we're
[56:31] going to live we're going to abide with
[56:32] Christ in the New Jerusalem
[56:34] the Earth is going to push up and that
[56:36] City's gonna come down and Heaven and
[56:39] Earth unite and guess what you and I
[56:40] live at the very focal point of it
[56:44] amen because it was always God's purpose
[56:48] so Satan knowing this of course he he
[56:50] knows that they can influence the
[56:52] leadership of men a little squatter
[56:54] today actually if anything he's more of
[56:55] a squatter today because at least back
[56:58] then he had the keys of hell and death
[56:59] but he don't even have the keys of hell
[57:01] and death today Christ has descended
[57:03] Christ has defeated him Christ has
[57:06] humiliated him and made a show of him
[57:08] openly he is risen he led captivity
[57:11] captive and he today possesses the keys
[57:14] of death and hell and the grave
[57:18] so if anything seems even more powerless
[57:20] today before the believer
[57:23] amen that what was the work of God the
[57:26] the for this reason the Bible says was
[57:28] the son of God manifested that he might
[57:31] destroy the works of the devil
[57:34] knowing that Christ died and knowing
[57:36] that he rose he knows he cannot subvert
[57:38] the purpose of God
[57:41] so what's he gonna do he's going to do
[57:43] it here like Tobias sambla he's just
[57:45] going to try to make you afraid
[57:47] he's not going to tell you that it won't
[57:48] work out or that God didn't do these
[57:50] things or just say it's not for you
[57:52] because if you get you to be afraid if
[57:54] he can get you to disbelieve if he can
[57:56] get you to back down that's as good as
[57:57] he needs to do
[58:00] amen
[58:02] so he's just looking to stop you from
[58:06] realizing the work's already done
[58:08] amen
[58:10] you think about the Book of Revelation
[58:11] why was John weeping when he found that
[58:14] no one was worthy to take the book from
[58:16] the right hand of him that sat on the
[58:18] throne but the ramp says because the
[58:20] whole creation would have been lost
[58:23] so notice he doesn't have Satan doesn't
[58:25] have to get the book he just has to keep
[58:26] it out of your hand keep it out of the
[58:29] hands of man and this is why John is
[58:31] weeping if nobody can possess it that's
[58:34] as good as it Satan needs we're all
[58:36] defeated but thank God a voice and we're
[58:38] not John
[58:39] don't wait John
[58:41] it might look bad but I want you to
[58:43] recognize the lion of the tribe of Judah
[58:45] he hath prevailed to take the book and
[58:48] to open the book and to loose the seals
[58:50] thereof you don't have a reason to cry
[58:53] you might have had one but Christ come
[58:55] along and Christ has prevailed and
[58:57] Christ in you he has prevailed today
[58:59] this is our victory that overcomes the
[59:02] world even our faith
[59:04] God's not asking to suffer and die in
[59:06] the cross it didn't rise again you
[59:08] actually already did that in him by his
[59:10] Spirit that's in you you identified with
[59:13] him when he suffered you identified with
[59:15] him and he died but praise God you're
[59:17] identified when he rose again on the
[59:19] third day
[59:20] when he sat down and the Majesty on high
[59:23] he sat down at the right hand of God the
[59:25] Bible says you have been made to be
[59:27] seated with him in Heavenly places
[59:34] why am I
[59:36] so I say all this to make this point
[59:39] we look at the Book of Genesis in the
[59:40] original purpose of man and I make this
[59:42] point salvation is is peripheral to
[59:45] Redemption you say what do you mean by
[59:47] that what I mean by that is it was
[59:48] necessary for God to save men it was
[59:51] necessary for God to to to offer
[59:53] salvation to men and women but the
[59:56] purpose was Redemption
[59:58] amen it would be one thing just to save
[1:00:00] you from a certain fate or to save you
[1:00:02] from condemnation but he wants it to
[1:00:04] look like it was in the beginning
[1:00:06] because the whole order of the Earth has
[1:00:09] been distorted by the fall of Man so in
[1:00:12] order to restore or redeem the whole
[1:00:13] earth man must come back to his position
[1:00:16] he must come back to a place of dominion
[1:00:19] amen
[1:00:20] so salvation is a means to an end the
[1:00:23] end is redemption
[1:00:25] which is to bring back to the original
[1:00:26] condition in other words when you were
[1:00:27] in the pawn shop you you belonged to
[1:00:30] somebody before you were there and the
[1:00:32] one that you belonged to before is the
[1:00:33] one that come to buy you back
[1:00:36] listen you didn't belong to Satan in the
[1:00:37] first place he can't buy you back
[1:00:40] so when it comes along he tries to put a
[1:00:42] lien in your life say listen you can't
[1:00:44] serve God and you can't overcome you've
[1:00:46] got this problem and you've got this
[1:00:48] situation you come from this family you
[1:00:50] just remind him I didn't come from you
[1:00:52] in the first place
[1:00:53] I come from God and I'm going back to
[1:00:56] God
[1:00:57] this Earth didn't come from Satan it
[1:00:59] come from God and it's gone back to God
[1:01:01] it's going to be the way God wanted it
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:06] so that means there's something in you
[1:01:08] that could be redeemed not everybody's
[1:01:09] got that
[1:01:11] Ram talks about it many places he talks
[1:01:13] about in the future home what was the
[1:01:14] difference between that that woman at
[1:01:16] the well oh my think about it now if she
[1:01:18] come to church today we'd be looking at
[1:01:19] her weird well shame on us amen that's
[1:01:22] God's daughter
[1:01:23] well listen she'd been married this many
[1:01:25] times and the man she's with now that's
[1:01:27] not her husband but you know what she
[1:01:29] had something the priest never had he
[1:01:32] might have sat under doctors he might
[1:01:34] have went to school he might have
[1:01:36] memorized the Bible but she had
[1:01:38] something he didn't have representation
[1:01:40] with God
[1:01:41] God looked at her before the foundation
[1:01:44] of the world said that's my daughter and
[1:01:46] no matter what situation she's in that
[1:01:48] was always my daughter and I'm gonna buy
[1:01:50] her back
[1:01:52] Satan's got no right to purchase her I'm
[1:01:54] the one that paid for it
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:01:57] [Applause]
[1:01:58] Hallelujah
[1:02:01] she's got representation you if you're a
[1:02:04] son or daughter of God you're always
[1:02:05] represented in that amen what do you say
[1:02:08] his Spirit to you it identified you
[1:02:10] that's what you always were
[1:02:13] yeah
[1:02:14] you know the Lord really dealt with me
[1:02:16] about this when I was studying this you
[1:02:17] know God did all these things not just
[1:02:19] and I want to remind you this today God
[1:02:22] did all this not just out of an
[1:02:23] obligation his word now he is obligated
[1:02:25] to his word that's true but it's more
[1:02:27] than just obligation
[1:02:29] and then when Adam fell he should have
[1:02:32] come running for God
[1:02:33] he should have been looking for his
[1:02:35] father said father Where Art Thou but
[1:02:37] who was doing the running
[1:02:39] God wasn't sending angels God wasn't
[1:02:42] Meandering he wasn't saying well if I'd
[1:02:45] get killed if I've got time here come
[1:02:47] running brother Brandon said saying Adam
[1:02:49] Where Art Thou
[1:02:51] he was looking for Adam he wanted to
[1:02:53] find him it was him running for him and
[1:02:56] so I want to remind you I want to
[1:02:57] encourage you today that this whole Plan
[1:02:59] of Salvation that was done by God he's
[1:03:02] not just trying to finish his honeydew
[1:03:03] list he's not trying to cross off a
[1:03:05] check mark on the bucket list but you
[1:03:07] are the reason you are the purpose you
[1:03:10] were why he did everything
[1:03:13] it's a great love for you and I is what
[1:03:15] compelled him to run looking for Adam
[1:03:19] because you were in Adam when he fell
[1:03:21] but praise God you were in Christ when
[1:03:22] he rose
[1:03:23] we're no longer identified with that
[1:03:25] first Adam we're identified in Christ
[1:03:28] Jesus the first man Adam was a living
[1:03:30] soul but that last man he's a quickening
[1:03:33] spirit
[1:03:33] it's the power to bring out of the Grave
[1:03:35] it's the power to bring you out of sin
[1:03:37] it's the power to break Addiction in
[1:03:39] your life it's the power to heal the
[1:03:40] sick
[1:03:44] amen
[1:03:46] we didn't go looking for him he came
[1:03:49] looking for me praise the Lord I feel
[1:03:51] like singing again already amen he came
[1:03:53] looking for me he made a way when there
[1:03:56] was no way
[1:03:57] when your life wasn't just kind of bad
[1:04:00] you know when you were enemies of God in
[1:04:02] your mind you were alienated from God he
[1:04:04] come looking for you
[1:04:06] and maybe you run a little bit then even
[1:04:08] but you know what he chased you down
[1:04:09] anyway because God's got a plan when God
[1:04:12] makes a plan God sticks to the plan
[1:04:15] there's no plan being the kingdom
[1:04:17] there's no alternative if you're a son
[1:04:19] if you're a daughter of God God will not
[1:04:22] repent of that he will not change his
[1:04:24] mind about you it's settled in the
[1:04:26] heavens forever
[1:04:28] listen to The Very stars in the heavens
[1:04:30] testify
[1:04:32] of your purpose of your ordination
[1:04:37] listen I think I preached about this
[1:04:38] last time the architect but you brother
[1:04:40] M talks about The Clockwork of the
[1:04:42] heavens how everything was laid out in a
[1:04:43] certain place and the whole thing works
[1:04:45] we couldn't make a clock that perfect
[1:04:47] and listen if every one of those stars
[1:04:49] and their gravitational constant and
[1:04:51] every every every light and everything
[1:04:53] has a purpose how much more the Sons and
[1:04:56] Daughters of God
[1:04:57] the kingdom doesn't work without the
[1:04:59] people you're the people
[1:05:01] listen that's not being arrogant you're
[1:05:03] not taken from God let this mind be in
[1:05:06] Christ that was in Christ being you who
[1:05:09] didn't get a robbery
[1:05:11] we think we're world listen I'm trying
[1:05:13] to I don't want to Rob Glory from God
[1:05:15] you are the glory of God
[1:05:17] what is the glory of a man it's a woman
[1:05:18] his wife his bride
[1:05:20] for the glory of God on display in this
[1:05:23] age you're not taking anything from God
[1:05:25] he give it to you
[1:05:28] so when I say listen we can't have the
[1:05:30] kingdom without you I'm not saying that
[1:05:32] presumptuously I'm making a point if
[1:05:35] you're ordained it's part of that bride
[1:05:37] that elected body we can't do it without
[1:05:40] you
[1:05:42] this is all there is to it
[1:05:44] there you go
[1:05:46] so God's not looking just to save you or
[1:05:48] patch you up or put a Band-Aid on you he
[1:05:50] wants to bring you back to the original
[1:05:52] condition what's the original condition
[1:05:55] Adam spoke and it moved he could speak
[1:05:59] to waves if there was waves I don't know
[1:06:01] and then stop he could speak the
[1:06:02] mountains he could chuck him around
[1:06:04] whatever
[1:06:05] he's an amateur God
[1:06:10] so how is God going to do this you know
[1:06:11] it's interesting the answer is actually
[1:06:13] throws me
[1:06:15] how's that going to bring Redemption to
[1:06:17] pass well he made a promise to Abraham
[1:06:19] when he was still called Abram he said
[1:06:20] I'm going to call you Abraham
[1:06:22] you're going to be a father of Nations
[1:06:23] and in you Abraham the father of Nations
[1:06:26] All Nations will be blessed he made a
[1:06:29] promise to David and to his seat after
[1:06:32] him that they would Reign upon the Earth
[1:06:34] forever therefore the plan of God to
[1:06:37] exercise Dominion to bring restoration
[1:06:40] to bring Redemption was government
[1:06:42] oh my God
[1:06:44] I thought I'd get a few more
[1:06:47] listen we all do with the government
[1:06:50] the government and the government you
[1:06:51] make money the government shows up you
[1:06:53] pay money the government shows up you're
[1:06:55] born the government shows up you die the
[1:06:56] government shows up
[1:06:58] you buy property the government you sell
[1:07:00] property the government the government
[1:07:01] the government there's a problem
[1:07:04] how's this the solution
[1:07:06] well listen human government has failed
[1:07:09] thus far amen I'm not gonna get
[1:07:13] political on you but I mean
[1:07:16] I want to
[1:07:18] that's the problem then I said they will
[1:07:21] listen here well listen it's gonna fail
[1:07:23] no matter what
[1:07:25] some of it just fails a lot more
[1:07:26] epically than others
[1:07:28] some of it like falls out of the sky and
[1:07:30] some of it like blows up and catch some
[1:07:32] fire and falls into a Chasm and the
[1:07:33] train hits at the same time as a bomb
[1:07:34] and it's like wow
[1:07:37] just when you think that I don't know
[1:07:39] why I'm doing this now just when you
[1:07:40] think the government couldn't get any
[1:07:41] worse
[1:07:42] they surprise you every time praise God
[1:07:44] learn something new today
[1:07:47] that's in human government has failed
[1:07:50] because of the phone condition but this
[1:07:53] promised one the Seed of Abraham the
[1:07:55] seat of the seed and the son of David
[1:07:57] Isaiah prophesies about him he says For
[1:07:59] unto us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:08:02] given and the government shall be upon
[1:08:04] his shoulder and his name Shall be
[1:08:07] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[1:08:10] God the Everlasting father the Prince of
[1:08:12] Peace
[1:08:14] I mean he's the Prince of Peace
[1:08:16] of the increase of his government and
[1:08:20] peace I'm gonna come to this idea of
[1:08:22] peace is the Prince of Peace amen of the
[1:08:25] increase of his government and peace
[1:08:26] there shall be no end upon the throne of
[1:08:29] David and upon his kingdom to order it
[1:08:32] and to establish it with judgment with
[1:08:34] Justice from his Force even forever the
[1:08:38] Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform
[1:08:41] this
[1:08:42] so there is a kind of government coming
[1:08:45] that will rain forever and it's a good
[1:08:47] kind we haven't seen it yet trust me
[1:08:50] and I've looked amen praise the Lord
[1:08:52] Hallelujah Brother Band says this the
[1:08:54] world falling apart or the falling apart
[1:08:56] of the world rather 1962. he said man's
[1:08:59] plans is falling apart
[1:09:02] God never offered us a Creed he never
[1:09:04] offered us a denomination I want
[1:09:06] somebody to show me in the Bible where
[1:09:08] he did I can show her you where he told
[1:09:10] you not to do it
[1:09:12] you show me where he said to do it you
[1:09:14] say well then brother Branham what did
[1:09:16] Jesus offer man a kingdom
[1:09:19] yeah hey man he's not just offering them
[1:09:21] redemption or salvation I'm going to
[1:09:23] save you he's offering it for the
[1:09:25] purpose of government for Redemption a
[1:09:27] kingdom
[1:09:29] that's what Jesus offered man a kingdom
[1:09:31] Hallelujah he and he is the king king of
[1:09:34] saints Lord of lords he offered us a
[1:09:37] kingdom not a politician denominational
[1:09:40] system but a kingdom pilate said are you
[1:09:43] the king of the Jews he said you said it
[1:09:46] he said if my kingdom was of this world
[1:09:48] my men would fight for me but my kingdom
[1:09:52] is of above
[1:09:54] right now I want you to think about this
[1:09:56] for a moment because all the prophets
[1:09:57] until John they preached of this coming
[1:10:00] Messiah they preached about this one
[1:10:01] that was to come Moses spoke about a
[1:10:04] prophet like unto them under Moses one
[1:10:05] that was going to be like him and all
[1:10:07] these prophets there are Heralds there
[1:10:10] are messengers of a coming Messiah
[1:10:13] but Jesus not the herald of his own
[1:10:15] coming
[1:10:16] amen
[1:10:17] he's not the herald this great one's
[1:10:19] going to come he's going to do this and
[1:10:20] that he's the one that's going to do it
[1:10:22] when he comes he's going to make his
[1:10:25] enemies his footstool
[1:10:27] so it's not until Christ comes that the
[1:10:30] kingdom is actually offered this
[1:10:31] government that Isaiah prophesied about
[1:10:33] the prophets could not offer it but the
[1:10:35] king of it the prince of it had to be
[1:10:37] the one to make the offer this Kingdom
[1:10:39] this government this rulership is what
[1:10:41] would usher in restoration or Redemption
[1:10:44] amen
[1:10:45] Luke 16 verse 16 the law and the
[1:10:47] prophets were until John since that time
[1:10:50] Hallelujah since that time the kingdom
[1:10:52] of God has preached and every man
[1:10:54] presseth into it
[1:10:56] so you don't get in the Kingdom by just
[1:10:58] uh you know signing up for a ticket or
[1:10:59] something it's not like a meal ticket
[1:11:00] you've got to press in you got to dig in
[1:11:03] a little bit amen there's something in
[1:11:05] you
[1:11:06] left that little Eagle in that egg or
[1:11:08] like a chicken or whatever you want
[1:11:10] there's something in you has to break
[1:11:11] out of the shell
[1:11:13] hey man if somebody does it for you it's
[1:11:15] not enough but God Knows by putting you
[1:11:17] in a situation you would gain the
[1:11:19] strength to overcome because you've got
[1:11:21] to press into this Kingdom
[1:11:23] amen amen
[1:11:26] so Jesus like I said he's not the herald
[1:11:27] of his own coming he's the herald of the
[1:11:30] Kingdom he's the herald of a greater
[1:11:32] World he's the herald of his own kingdom
[1:11:34] because it was necessary according to
[1:11:36] the word of God for Jesus to offer the
[1:11:38] kingdom unto the Jews first amen
[1:11:41] so this is the thing and this is where
[1:11:43] the Jews missed it he's not simply
[1:11:45] offering them a better alternative to
[1:11:48] Roman government
[1:11:49] well listen that's how the Romans do it
[1:11:51] but we're gonna do a better way well
[1:11:52] here's communism here's capitalism here
[1:11:54] no he's not offering just a better way
[1:11:56] he's offering the only way that actually
[1:11:59] works that produces Redemption
[1:12:02] amen they were looking for a political
[1:12:04] way they were looking to overthrow the
[1:12:06] Roman government they were looking to
[1:12:08] prop themselves up but Jesus didn't
[1:12:09] offer them that and when we look for
[1:12:11] that well we're going to be a better
[1:12:13] group of people we're going to be a
[1:12:14] better Church we're going to be a better
[1:12:15] class of people that's no different than
[1:12:17] what they look for
[1:12:19] no what he's looking for is a people
[1:12:21] that will give him the total preeminence
[1:12:25] and then he's not here today to endorse
[1:12:27] you because you supported his campaign
[1:12:30] he's not here today to you know hook you
[1:12:33] up with some insider trading because you
[1:12:35] believe in his campaign you work for his
[1:12:37] campaign no he's looking for a people
[1:12:39] that will submit 100 to him because
[1:12:43] that's the only kind of rulership that
[1:12:45] Redemption can produce
[1:12:49] amen his by offering this Kingdom he is
[1:12:53] offering them the issuing in of all
[1:12:56] things that pertain to Redemption
[1:12:58] amen you know Jesus talks about the uh
[1:13:02] the parable of the vineyard the vine
[1:13:03] dresser are you familiar with this
[1:13:04] Parable Jesus said there's a certain
[1:13:06] Vineyard and a husbandman let it out and
[1:13:09] uh and people took it over and they were
[1:13:10] working at it and stuff so he sent
[1:13:12] Messengers he said Harold he said
[1:13:13] prophets and they they would beat him
[1:13:15] out and throw them out and this and that
[1:13:18] and finally the husband says I know what
[1:13:19] I do I'll send him my son I'll send them
[1:13:22] the air surely they'll respect him and
[1:13:24] when that air got there they said this
[1:13:26] is the man's Heir let's kill him and
[1:13:28] then we'll take it
[1:13:30] and Jesus asked the question he says
[1:13:32] well what do you suppose they'll do what
[1:13:34] are you supposed to husband's going to
[1:13:36] do when they kill the son he said well
[1:13:38] he'll he'll utterly destroy those men
[1:13:40] they didn't know they were talking about
[1:13:42] themselves
[1:13:43] they'll utterly destroy these men and
[1:13:45] he'll set up new Vine dresses he'll set
[1:13:47] up new people over here thou has said it
[1:13:50] hey man
[1:13:51] in other words what you're saying it had
[1:13:53] to be offered to you but since you've
[1:13:55] rejected God Jesus says it's going to be
[1:13:57] given to a nation it's the Greek word
[1:13:59] ethos it's a people it's not actually
[1:14:01] America or Italy or whatever a people a
[1:14:05] nation can I say it this way a holy
[1:14:08] nation a chosen people a royal
[1:14:11] priesthood
[1:14:12] our government is not a certain
[1:14:14] government of man we are ruled our
[1:14:17] headquarters is in heaven
[1:14:19] and our Sovereign is the Lord Jesus
[1:14:21] Christ the one they rejected
[1:14:23] and let me remind you as Paul remind you
[1:14:25] God in his wisdom allowed blindness to
[1:14:28] happen to them
[1:14:30] so it wasn't just that you were smarter
[1:14:31] than them but God allowed blindness to
[1:14:33] happen to them that you and I would have
[1:14:35] this Grand opportunity that we have to
[1:14:38] be here today because if they had
[1:14:39] received it that would have been the end
[1:14:41] that would have been Redemption and so I
[1:14:44] hope that hits home for you just a
[1:14:45] little bit today that those people were
[1:14:47] blinded so you and I could believe this
[1:14:49] message today so you and I would have
[1:14:51] this opportunity amen God got a lot of
[1:14:53] people to go my think about this God a
[1:14:55] lot of people to be in captivity and to
[1:14:58] suffer and to be oppressed and go
[1:15:00] through a holocaust all the horrible
[1:15:02] things that have happened this people
[1:15:04] but he allowed it not only to bless them
[1:15:06] but for you and I
[1:15:08] so when you sit there and think well
[1:15:10] does God really love me look at what he
[1:15:11] allowed people to go through look what
[1:15:13] he let his son go through for you and I
[1:15:17] I can't have the kingdom without you
[1:15:21] because you're Kings and Priests unto
[1:15:24] God
[1:15:25] you have a part you're listen if if
[1:15:28] Christ is the air your joy airs with
[1:15:30] Christ
[1:15:32] so he can no more have it without you
[1:15:33] than he could with Christ because you
[1:15:35] are part of the inheritance that Adam
[1:15:38] lost Christ has received it he's got a
[1:15:41] more excellent Name than the Angels
[1:15:43] today amen
[1:15:46] so the nations were blinded so we could
[1:15:48] have
[1:15:49] this this blessedness of the Gospel amen
[1:15:53] you know we just got through the uh
[1:15:55] the holiday season I tell you what what
[1:15:58] praise the Lord
[1:15:59] I went to church here I don't know why
[1:16:01] I'm telling this story I'm gonna get
[1:16:02] myself in trouble went to church here a
[1:16:04] while back and uh I I was my one of my
[1:16:06] first times preached there and we got
[1:16:07] done afterwards I was talking about how
[1:16:09] I bought my daughter a BB gun here a
[1:16:10] while back and I said yeah I got it for
[1:16:11] for Christmas and because I said I
[1:16:14] thought oh boy
[1:16:16] and to be fair to actually I got it like
[1:16:18] in November but I just said it I'm like
[1:16:20] oh man oh that's a problem well Merry
[1:16:23] Christmas
[1:16:25] well the brother laughed at me and he
[1:16:27] had a problem with it so hope you
[1:16:29] forgive me but anyway I just bought it
[1:16:30] for because I liked it but we know we we
[1:16:32] celebrated this season and you know uh I
[1:16:35] think about it because the very night
[1:16:36] Jesus was born which wasn't December
[1:16:38] because it would have froze but uh the
[1:16:40] very night Jesus is born there were some
[1:16:42] Shepherds out in the country I think I
[1:16:44] preached about a while back but these
[1:16:45] Shepherds they're out there and the
[1:16:46] angels of God appear one night and I see
[1:16:49] fear not for I bring you good tidings of
[1:16:51] great joy which shall be to all people
[1:16:56] not just you and I but all people not
[1:16:59] just the Jews that were there that's
[1:17:00] that was the thinking of the Jews well
[1:17:02] he's here to bless the Jews no he's here
[1:17:04] for Good Tidings for all people all
[1:17:07] nations
[1:17:09] see the Heavenly Host is testifying what
[1:17:11] is coming out to his heralding and then
[1:17:14] the host appear they say glory to God in
[1:17:17] the highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[1:17:20] toward men
[1:17:23] now this heavenly host now I'm saying
[1:17:26] this for a reason they did not declare
[1:17:27] there would be peace on Earth because
[1:17:29] people that take it in the holiday
[1:17:31] season the U.N they take it say oh
[1:17:32] listen there's going to be peace on
[1:17:34] Earth that's not exactly what they said
[1:17:36] they said on Earth peace
[1:17:38] you say What's the difference brother
[1:17:40] well this is what it is they're saying
[1:17:41] on Earth there's gonna be peace not that
[1:17:43] the whole earth is going to have it
[1:17:44] necessarily amen they were not
[1:17:46] testifying that now on the whole earth
[1:17:49] there'd Never Be Another War there'll
[1:17:51] never be another disagreement there'd
[1:17:52] never be another problem
[1:17:54] they weren't testifying that men were
[1:17:56] going to achieve this peace on their own
[1:17:58] but what they're saying is on Earth
[1:17:59] there is now a means of peace
[1:18:01] in other words God is now offering peace
[1:18:04] it's not the peace between nations it's
[1:18:06] not the peace between family members or
[1:18:08] churches it's the peace between God and
[1:18:11] Men
[1:18:12] because that's the thing they'll act
[1:18:14] amen now on Earth God is offering peace
[1:18:17] or an olive Rich by Christ that's what
[1:18:20] the Kingdom's about
[1:18:22] amen
[1:18:24] so it's peace between God and man he's
[1:18:26] the Prince of Peace So what is it that's
[1:18:28] why I'm coming to if he's the herald if
[1:18:30] he's heralding a government why what's
[1:18:32] he The Herald of peace
[1:18:34] shalom in other words the the messenger
[1:18:37] has come to offer you something you
[1:18:39] didn't have peace with God
[1:18:42] because that's what you needed you say
[1:18:45] well I've got this problem I've got this
[1:18:46] in my past what you need is peace with
[1:18:48] God because when you make peace with God
[1:18:50] you can make peace with yourself you can
[1:18:52] make peace with your past you can make
[1:18:54] peace with your enemies amen
[1:18:57] because until you have peace between you
[1:18:58] and God you'll never achieve lasting
[1:19:00] peace anywhere else
[1:19:03] amen praise the Lord Romans 10 the
[1:19:05] Apostle Paul says how then shall they
[1:19:08] call on him and whom they've not
[1:19:09] believed and how should they believe in
[1:19:11] him and whom they've not heard and how
[1:19:13] shall they hear without a preacher and
[1:19:15] how shall they preach except they be
[1:19:17] sent as it is written how beautiful are
[1:19:20] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[1:19:22] of peace
[1:19:25] and bring Glad Tidings of good things
[1:19:28] the same thing the Angels talked about
[1:19:29] the gospel of peace how beautiful are
[1:19:32] the feet
[1:19:33] amen he's quoting Isaiah says how
[1:19:35] beautiful upon the mountains are the
[1:19:37] feet of him that bringeth good tidings
[1:19:39] that publishes peace that brings Good
[1:19:42] Tidings of good that publishes salvation
[1:19:45] so the gospel is peace
[1:19:47] to them that receive it
[1:19:49] that's why them that carry it their feet
[1:19:51] are beautiful
[1:19:52] perhaps you didn't know this about me
[1:19:55] I've got really pretty feet
[1:19:58] I I once considered a career I was gonna
[1:20:01] model my feet but I thought it wouldn't
[1:20:02] be modest so
[1:20:04] no I've got pretty feet now honestly if
[1:20:07] you look at them they look like like
[1:20:08] whales they're swollen or something but
[1:20:11] bubble says they're pretty
[1:20:12] you say why does it say they're
[1:20:13] beautiful they're not beautiful
[1:20:15] Aesthetics of it
[1:20:17] I'll just probably need to clean
[1:20:18] something up down there little hairy
[1:20:21] they're beautiful because of what they
[1:20:23] represent
[1:20:24] when you see these feet coming and
[1:20:26] they're carrying Good Tidings of Peace
[1:20:28] that's what makes it beautiful is what
[1:20:30] it represents
[1:20:32] so I'll just save you the trouble of
[1:20:34] rubbing my feet hey man they're not
[1:20:36] pretty because of how they look they're
[1:20:37] pretty because of what they represent
[1:20:38] the gospel is peace amen Christ is peace
[1:20:42] he brought peace but he is peace the
[1:20:44] book of Ephesians says he is our peace
[1:20:47] who has made us both one and has broken
[1:20:50] down the middle wall of partitioned
[1:20:52] between us having abolished in his flesh
[1:20:54] the enemy enmity even the law of
[1:20:56] Commandments contained in ordinances for
[1:20:58] to make it himself of Twain one new man
[1:21:01] so making peace
[1:21:04] so he is peace and then he makes peace
[1:21:07] and that he might reconcile both unto
[1:21:10] God and one body by the cross having
[1:21:11] slain the enmity thereby and came and
[1:21:14] preached peace
[1:21:16] to the to you which were afar off into
[1:21:20] them that were nigh
[1:21:22] so he is peace he makes peace he
[1:21:25] preaches peace says all things peace
[1:21:27] it's shalom that's why brother random
[1:21:29] says when the light of this day the
[1:21:31] light of his hour shine upon this church
[1:21:33] this bright in the last days it was
[1:21:35] Shalom to you
[1:21:38] he said it's a new year he said if if
[1:21:40] you don't have the word it's a bad year
[1:21:42] you say a house is 2023 going to be as
[1:21:44] bad as 2020 or 2021 or 2022. well it
[1:21:48] depends on who you are
[1:21:50] right and then if you're without Christ
[1:21:52] it's the worst year yet
[1:21:54] I can about guarantee now you're sitting
[1:21:56] there going I didn't think it'd get any
[1:21:57] worse oh yeah that's one thing about us
[1:21:59] as human beings we think we've made a
[1:22:01] big mistake out of things we've messed
[1:22:03] it up we just find a way to make it
[1:22:04] worse
[1:22:06] well praise the Lord a couple of us are
[1:22:08] on us here amen
[1:22:09] that's the truth hey man but listen if
[1:22:12] you have seen the light of this message
[1:22:14] he said it's a good year for you
[1:22:17] you're going to have a good year it's
[1:22:18] shalom it's peace for you
[1:22:22] it's not the piece that you can go buy
[1:22:24] at a store it's not the peace that men
[1:22:26] try to find at a bar or in a needle amen
[1:22:29] it's the peace between you and God only
[1:22:32] God could give it
[1:22:33] if God give it no man can take it from
[1:22:36] you
[1:22:37] hey man we try to let everything take
[1:22:39] our peace if God give it to you no man
[1:22:42] can take it from you
[1:22:46] he come and preach peace listen he
[1:22:49] that's what he did with his own
[1:22:50] disciples and when he raised from the
[1:22:51] dead the Bible
[1:22:53] talks about them on the road to Emmaus
[1:22:55] and how they saw him and the scripture
[1:22:57] says they told what things were done in
[1:22:58] the way and how he was known to them and
[1:23:00] breaking of the bread I believe we live
[1:23:02] in a day like that amen I believe the
[1:23:04] word's been open to us I believe we've
[1:23:06] had a road to amaze experience we we
[1:23:08] thought it was William Branham we just
[1:23:09] thought was another preacher but it was
[1:23:11] Christ veiled behind the man
[1:23:13] not that William branham's Christ but he
[1:23:15] was hid behind that Ministry
[1:23:17] and when our eyes were open we
[1:23:19] recognized it was Christ in our midst
[1:23:21] that was doing these things
[1:23:23] and these men they testified the same
[1:23:25] thing and it says as they thou spake
[1:23:28] Jesus himself stood in the midst of them
[1:23:31] and saith unto them to them peace be
[1:23:34] unto you
[1:23:39] John 20 then the same day evening being
[1:23:41] the first day of the week as here we are
[1:23:43] amen when the doors were shut where the
[1:23:45] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[1:23:47] Jews then came Jesus and stood in the
[1:23:50] midst of them in the midst rather and
[1:23:52] saith unto them peace be unto you verse
[1:23:56] 20 and when he had so said he showed
[1:23:59] them his hands and his side then where
[1:24:02] the disciples glad when they saw the
[1:24:04] Lord
[1:24:05] then Jesus says to them again
[1:24:08] peace
[1:24:11] peace be unto you
[1:24:13] as my father hath sent me even so send I
[1:24:16] you verse 26 after eight days again
[1:24:20] his disciples were with him and Thomas
[1:24:21] with them then came Jesus the door is
[1:24:25] being shot and stood in the midst and
[1:24:27] said Peace
[1:24:29] listen here he opens this way every time
[1:24:31] peace be unto you why because I had a
[1:24:34] lot of reasons to be afraid
[1:24:36] they had a lot of reasons not do not
[1:24:38] have peace but he said I'm going to give
[1:24:39] you one to have peace Because I Said So
[1:24:41] peace be unto you why has he appeared to
[1:24:45] them so they would have peace
[1:24:47] why did the message appear to us in this
[1:24:50] day peace be unto you shalom it's
[1:24:54] breaking day don't be afraid don't fear
[1:24:57] my peace I give to you not as the word
[1:25:00] gives so I give
[1:25:02] listen in this world you're gonna have
[1:25:05] tribulation
[1:25:07] I I think one of the biggest things that
[1:25:09] people do as a Christian a big
[1:25:10] disservice brother Brown says you know
[1:25:12] we paint it real smooth like it's always
[1:25:13] going to be Joy it's always going to be
[1:25:15] happy but listen you're going to go
[1:25:16] through trials you already have amen
[1:25:19] give me a show of hands anybody been
[1:25:21] through a trial you ought to praise God
[1:25:22] listen you've got strength in your body
[1:25:24] you can testify I've been through trials
[1:25:26] but you know what he's brought me
[1:25:27] through trials
[1:25:30] you're gonna have trouble but fear not
[1:25:33] I've overcome the world
[1:25:36] that's why you can have peace
[1:25:42] listen he wanted to give Jerusalem peace
[1:25:46] the Bible says praying for the Peace of
[1:25:47] Jerusalem that's him he's the one
[1:25:51] they're not gonna have peace until he's
[1:25:53] there
[1:25:57] he is the desire of Nations
[1:25:59] and he wanted to give that he said I
[1:26:01] would have gathered you
[1:26:03] he offered them peace
[1:26:05] but they rejected it
[1:26:08] but he's offered us the same thing why
[1:26:10] because he's the herald of our greater
[1:26:12] world he performed a sign before them
[1:26:14] and the purpose of that sign was to
[1:26:16] offer that people peace and in this
[1:26:18] generation
[1:26:19] in this age we've seen the same thing on
[1:26:22] display we knew who Melchizedek was back
[1:26:25] there but who was this Melchizedek in
[1:26:28] this hour it was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:30] the son of man doing the same thing
[1:26:33] offering to a people one last time I
[1:26:37] would have gathered you if you'd come
[1:26:38] out of denominations it could come out
[1:26:40] of your own thinking I would have
[1:26:41] gathered you but you would not but
[1:26:44] praise God there's a people
[1:26:46] Ashland had a resurrection out of dirt
[1:26:49] denomination there were some disciples
[1:26:51] gathered together and when he showed up
[1:26:53] to you it wasn't to invite you he
[1:26:55] indicted the world but to you he says
[1:26:58] shalom
[1:26:59] God's peace be upon you
[1:27:04] I'm not ordained you to be condemned I
[1:27:06] have ordained you for peace
[1:27:09] [Applause]
[1:27:12] the prophet says now we see when God
[1:27:13] gives a man an invitation and to do
[1:27:16] something or to receive that invitation
[1:27:17] that he's given he returns it down then
[1:27:20] there's nothing left
[1:27:21] after Mercy is spurned but judgment if
[1:27:24] you step over the boundaries of Mercy
[1:27:27] there's only one thing left and that's
[1:27:28] judgment
[1:27:30] that's the world today amen
[1:27:33] but that's not you and I today
[1:27:35] amen God spoke something to ah listen
[1:27:38] God declared his intention in an
[1:27:40] indictment but he declared his intention
[1:27:41] to you and I peace is my intent in case
[1:27:45] you weren't sure in case you weren't
[1:27:47] certain I want you to know why this
[1:27:49] message come to you and I peace
[1:27:53] now you might not have realized it but
[1:27:55] that's what it was about getting didn't
[1:27:56] realize it either
[1:27:58] the Book of Judges the book talk the
[1:28:00] Bible talks about Gideon he was there
[1:28:01] hiding behind the wine press he was the
[1:28:03] least of his father's house and the
[1:28:05] angel of the Lord shows up to him and
[1:28:08] the angel Lord says get in you're a
[1:28:09] mighty man of Valor
[1:28:11] here he is hiding now
[1:28:13] Gideon saw the angel of the lord I want
[1:28:15] you to remember this when he saw the
[1:28:17] angel of the Lord he despaired
[1:28:20] he said alas O Lord God for I have
[1:28:23] because I have seen an angel of the Lord
[1:28:25] face to face he thought the Angels
[1:28:27] showed up I'm gonna die
[1:28:30] oh the angel of gods appeared to us in
[1:28:32] this generation we're all done for
[1:28:35] but the Lord said unto him peace
[1:28:38] be unto you
[1:28:40] peace be unto you fear not Thou shalt
[1:28:43] not die praise the Lord I tell you what
[1:28:45] I don't care what happens if 50 years go
[1:28:48] by and you hear one day brother Alex
[1:28:50] passed away he went on and died don't
[1:28:51] you believe him
[1:28:53] and I'm not dead I'm just somewhere else
[1:28:56] and then I shall not die but I shall
[1:28:59] live to declare the works of the Lord
[1:29:02] this is the Lord's doing and it's
[1:29:04] marvelous in our eyes
[1:29:06] if you live and believe that he that
[1:29:08] believeth on me though he were dead yet
[1:29:10] shall he live and if you live and you
[1:29:12] believe in this word he shall never die
[1:29:16] you shall not die
[1:29:18] you're not here to perish under the
[1:29:20] hands of midianites
[1:29:22] the angel of the Lord appeared to you
[1:29:24] not for your destruction but to tell you
[1:29:27] peace
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:32] I love this thing getting built an altar
[1:29:33] there into the Lord and called it
[1:29:35] Jehovah shalom
[1:29:39] it's one of us redempting Jehovah Shalom
[1:29:41] what made him Jehovah Shalom when a man
[1:29:44] thought he was going to die God said no
[1:29:46] I've come for peace
[1:29:48] that's what makes him Jehovah Shalom
[1:29:50] God's purpose when you deserve to die
[1:29:53] when you octave that when you feared
[1:29:55] death God said no you misunderstood I've
[1:29:58] come for peace
[1:29:59] not peace with the midianites I'm here
[1:30:02] to give peace with you be at peace
[1:30:04] I'm not here to make terms with the
[1:30:06] midianites I'm not here to negotiate I'm
[1:30:09] here to give you peace I'm here to give
[1:30:11] them trouble
[1:30:14] amen
[1:30:15] you say how can he be Jehovah Shalom if
[1:30:17] a people reject him and he's our peace
[1:30:20] one simply needs to look at the terms
[1:30:22] that he offers
[1:30:23] hey man see he's come to make a deal
[1:30:26] amen the Bible tells you about I said
[1:30:27] the stone this rock he said if you fall
[1:30:30] on this rock you'll be broken but if
[1:30:32] this rock falls on you you will be
[1:30:34] ground into dust
[1:30:37] he's going to ground The Rock and The
[1:30:39] Rock's gonna ground its enemies into
[1:30:40] dust hey man so here's his terms you can
[1:30:43] either surrender to me or I can defeat
[1:30:45] you
[1:30:46] hey man he's going to have peace even if
[1:30:50] he has to make it himself
[1:30:53] amen you know I I love this uh in the
[1:30:57] Bible I believe it's in second Samuel
[1:30:58] chapter seven I guess I should have
[1:30:59] wrote it down but I believe it's in
[1:31:01] second Samuel chapter seven you know the
[1:31:03] Bible talks about David when he had
[1:31:05] peace from all his enemies he had rest
[1:31:07] from all of his enemies and I think I
[1:31:08] mentioned this a while back but you know
[1:31:10] the reason he had rest from all his
[1:31:11] enemies is because he beat them all up
[1:31:14] and then he didn't sit there and
[1:31:15] negotiate my paperwork he defeated them
[1:31:18] all they come out against him and he
[1:31:20] beat him and more coming against him he
[1:31:22] went behind some trees and the mulberry
[1:31:23] bushes began to move and he defeated
[1:31:25] them he beats them off that's why nobody
[1:31:28] wants to fight him
[1:31:30] hey man praise God
[1:31:32] did you kill him we're on fire for that
[1:31:34] one amen praise the Lord we're not here
[1:31:36] today to negotiate we're gonna win we're
[1:31:38] gonna have peace one way or the other
[1:31:41] the world's not going to give it to you
[1:31:42] but you might be able to take it away
[1:31:43] from them
[1:31:44] well praise the Lord somebody listen
[1:31:46] David had peace through Supremacy
[1:31:50] the Bible tells us Christ he's going to
[1:31:52] come back with tens of thousands time
[1:31:54] ten thousands of his Saints that's us
[1:31:58] that's you and I what's he coming back
[1:32:01] to do to execute judgment on all the
[1:32:04] ungodly for their ungodly Deeds which
[1:32:06] they have ungodly commanded he's coming
[1:32:08] to subjugate anything that won't submit
[1:32:11] to him
[1:32:13] so this is the blessing of the Gospel
[1:32:15] but it's also the consequences of
[1:32:17] rejecting it
[1:32:19] and this is why Paul says that you and I
[1:32:21] we are ambassadors for Christ
[1:32:24] for the ram says if you're an ambassador
[1:32:26] from Heaven All Heavens is behind you
[1:32:30] and Heaven is consistent of the word
[1:32:34] amen praise the Lord
[1:32:37] that's why I said earlier our
[1:32:38] headquarters brother Ram says it is in
[1:32:40] heaven
[1:32:41] I know some people differ on that they
[1:32:42] think this certain place in Indiana is
[1:32:45] their headquarters or this certain
[1:32:46] Church my headquarters
[1:32:48] can't speak for anybody else my orders
[1:32:50] come from heaven
[1:32:52] amen here's my orders right here that's
[1:32:55] all I need if a man don't like it if a
[1:32:58] man don't agree with it that's on him
[1:33:00] amen but this is my peace offering right
[1:33:02] here
[1:33:03] Christ was a peace offering for you and
[1:33:05] I listen I love you all I love listen I
[1:33:08] love people I'm not real maybe the best
[1:33:10] shown it sometimes
[1:33:12] but I love people amen but listen not a
[1:33:14] one you died for my sins I didn't die
[1:33:17] for yours amen you are loyalty to one
[1:33:19] man the man Christ Jesus
[1:33:22] there's your peace there's your joy
[1:33:24] there's your Redemption
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:29] in this age he offered a pardon
[1:33:33] remember pardon's not a pardon unless
[1:33:35] it's received as a pardon
[1:33:36] it's only peace as you if you receive it
[1:33:38] as peace that's up to you
[1:33:42] he offered pardon through this message
[1:33:44] why because the church is no longer his
[1:33:46] voice it's no longer his mouthpiece in
[1:33:48] other words the church was no longer a
[1:33:50] Herald of his coming
[1:33:52] which is ironic because brother Ram
[1:33:53] talks about that that publication The
[1:33:55] Herald is coming listen he's not coming
[1:33:58] he is coming but spiritually he's here
[1:34:01] that's what the message come to identify
[1:34:04] he's here now declaring himself
[1:34:07] it's not just that he's coming he has
[1:34:10] come through the full revelation of the
[1:34:12] word today and what was it it was peace
[1:34:14] to us
[1:34:17] so if you're troubling today I want to
[1:34:18] remind you the message didn't come to
[1:34:20] give you trouble some people get trouble
[1:34:21] when they hear the message I don't I
[1:34:23] think praise God that's for me that's my
[1:34:26] peace that's what settles me when when
[1:34:28] people rise against you when you've got
[1:34:31] sickness in your body when you don't
[1:34:32] know how you're going to pay the bills
[1:34:34] that's where my peace comes from it's
[1:34:36] not a bunch of zeros at the end of my
[1:34:38] bank account it's not that I jog 12
[1:34:40] miles a day which I don't
[1:34:42] so that I'm in the best health or I you
[1:34:44] know I'm popular my peace your peace is
[1:34:47] in Christ
[1:34:50] because those things come and those
[1:34:52] things go but this Prince of Peace of
[1:34:54] his government of his peace there is no
[1:34:58] end
[1:34:59] [Applause]
[1:35:03] God come and spoke to Gideon
[1:35:06] getting looked like a coward look like a
[1:35:09] listen Gideon looked like the least of
[1:35:11] his father's house but God said no
[1:35:13] there's a mighty man of Valor listen let
[1:35:15] me say it this way that's a dangerous

[1:35:33] not going to preach it here today but
[1:35:35] he's listen giving himself doesn't
[1:35:37] realize how dangerous he is
[1:35:40] hey man think about that now listen when
[1:35:42] Jesus is in Simon the Pharisees house
[1:35:44] and they've got him shoved in the corner
[1:35:46] and some woman's washes feet and they're
[1:35:48] sitting there ridiculed that that was a
[1:35:50] dangerous man they didn't realize it

[1:40:25] rejected peace 1956 they rejected the
[1:40:28] gospel it was peace
[1:40:30] we look at the world today we say how
[1:40:32] can it be so bad I would be shocked if
[1:40:34] it wasn't because they rejected the only
[1:40:37] peace that they could ever find
[1:40:40] it has to happen but it doesn't mean it
[1:40:43] has to happen to you and I
[1:40:46] amen

[1:41:17] because God is he's good at it amen
[1:41:20] doesn't matter what the chaos is in your
[1:41:21] life sickness poverty nervousness and
[1:41:25] the Bible says that he's going to rule
[1:41:27] the nations with a rod of iron
[1:41:30] amen if they rise up he'll Dash them
[1:41:33] with a rod like The Potter's vessel
[1:41:37] listen if you can rule the Nations what
[1:41:39] can you do in your life

[1:41:43] Nations do you believe of his peace and
[1:41:45] his Reign there's going to be no air
[1:41:47] doesn't even rule the Nations he can
[1:41:49] handle what you're dealing with today
[1:41:52] whatever you're going through lesson

[1:42:12] quit trying to manufacture your own
[1:42:14] peace let him do it
[1:42:18] brother man tells the story I love it he
[1:42:19] said he was car he was in Carlsbad New
[1:42:21] Mexico one day and he was in this cave
[1:42:23] they had a big old bat Den down there
[1:42:25] and all these bats were hanging around
[1:42:26] in there and he said it was spooky
[1:42:27] looking we got down there and this man
[1:42:29] he he gets down there the guy and he
[1:42:30] shuts the light off and there's a little
[1:42:32] girl and her her brother there and she
[1:42:33] starts to get scared milligrams so
[1:42:36] that's just about the way the times are
[1:42:38] getting when you see the church that
[1:42:39] fails to recognize God's word when you
[1:42:42] see our daughters of Zion going the way
[1:42:43] they're doing when you see our brothers
[1:42:45] that smokes and drinks and tells dirty
[1:42:47] jokes and things and still trying to
[1:42:48] hold their confession in Christ oh my
[1:42:50] it's dark it's pitch dark
[1:42:54] we see the sign of his coming It's
[1:42:57] always darkest just before the day then
[1:43:00] the Morning Star comes out to Hell the
[1:43:02] day and to Herald it
[1:43:06] to show its coming notice he said when
[1:43:08] they turn that light off that little
[1:43:10] girl she screamed to the top of her
[1:43:11] voice
[1:43:13] maybe you feel that way sometimes
[1:43:15] straight to give up just read a crown
[1:43:17] despair
[1:43:18] hey man let that little boy stand by the
[1:43:20] guy he's seen that guy switch the light
[1:43:22] off he looked at his sister she's having
[1:43:24] a fit she was screaming going up and
[1:43:26] down oh what's gonna happen next what's
[1:43:28] the matter what's the matter
[1:43:30] you know what he screamed he said Don't
[1:43:32] Fear little sister
[1:43:34] there's a man here
[1:43:36] turn on the light
[1:43:38] [Music]
[1:43:40] I don't know what each one of you is
[1:43:42] dealing with today but maybe you're like
[1:43:43] this little girl let me be that one like
[1:43:45] that boy to remind you there's a man
[1:43:47] standing right here and maybe he's not a
[1:43:49] million miles away he's just a few feet
[1:43:51] away listen he's as close as you'll let
[1:43:53] him be
[1:43:53] if you allow him if you let him come in
[1:43:56] listen the Bible says the words nigh you
[1:43:58] it's in your mouth it's in your heart
[1:44:00] he's as far or he's as close as you let
[1:44:03] him be
[1:44:04] let me testify there's a man here today
[1:44:07] right now in Sheffield Ohio there's a
[1:44:11] man here in your heart he can turn on
[1:44:13] the light
[1:44:15] he's come to Herald a greater world and
[1:44:17] he's here to turn on the light amen that
[1:44:19] light is your shalom
[1:44:21] that life dissolves the darkness and
[1:44:23] pushes back the darkness
[1:44:27] he said listen little sister
[1:44:29] you might think we're small
[1:44:31] and in a minority but don't fear there's
[1:44:34] a man here who can turn on the lights
[1:44:39] one brother's like I don't know if
[1:44:41] you're gonna get back to Nehemiah I'm
[1:44:42] here
[1:44:44] I got it okay it's under control thank
[1:44:46] God
[1:44:48] don't be tossed to and fro Nehemiah in
[1:44:51] the Bible that we read He Walked on
[1:44:53] heedless of the threats of his enemies
[1:44:56] he was not deterred from his purpose he
[1:44:58] was not moved to the left to the right
[1:44:59] he was not tossed by discouraging words
[1:45:02] he was not moved about by negative
[1:45:04] circumstances amen he was unmoved by
[1:45:06] gangsters because Nehemiah didn't look
[1:45:09] at what his enemy said
[1:45:11] let me just give this to you for a
[1:45:12] second Nehemiah wasn't looking at their
[1:45:14] words on the paper or what they said he
[1:45:15] was looking at their attention
[1:45:17] hey man don't look at a person's words
[1:45:20] people can say anything
[1:45:22] what was the intention behind it amen
[1:45:26] he didn't say oh we're all going to die
[1:45:27] and listen they're trying to help me out
[1:45:29] why are they saying that
[1:45:32] they're saying it because they want me
[1:45:33] to stop
[1:45:35] God doesn't want me to stop God wants me
[1:45:37] to go on therefore why should I value
[1:45:40] their opinion
[1:45:41] hey man
[1:45:42] they are wanting me to stop so I'm going
[1:45:45] to press on Amen
[1:45:46] they start spreading rumors you're
[1:45:48] trying to make yourself a king you're
[1:45:50] trying to take over you just want to
[1:45:52] position Nehemiah you just think you're
[1:45:54] special and listen Nehemiah like I said
[1:45:56] earlier he doesn't waste time trying to
[1:45:58] prove him wrong because it's not up to
[1:46:00] them anyway
[1:46:02] listen I know that the Bible said this
[1:46:04] in the message said this but this person
[1:46:06] says that some mommy thinks this about
[1:46:08] me and Daddy thinks this about me listen
[1:46:10] it doesn't matter what anybody says it
[1:46:12] matters what God is saying
[1:46:14] Nehemiah understood God put him there
[1:46:16] God ordinated for a great work you're
[1:46:20] ordained for a great work the work in
[1:46:22] your life is greater than just you
[1:46:26] the kingdom that you and I are a part of
[1:46:28] it's greater than just you it doesn't
[1:46:30] survive or fall just based on you the
[1:46:33] god that we serve is greater
[1:46:36] if you stay in the purpose of God it
[1:46:39] doesn't matter what anybody else says
[1:46:40] about it don't be moved by circumstances
[1:46:45] I love it they try to get him to hide in
[1:46:46] the temple hide a church let's just come
[1:46:48] out here listen to him either coming to
[1:46:51] kill you you just hide here you can you
[1:46:53] can do your job listen you can be a
[1:46:55] Christian here at church and just stay
[1:46:56] here and that's fine you don't have to
[1:46:58] go out you don't have to live that kind
[1:46:59] of a testimony anywhere else just just
[1:47:01] stay here keep your Christianity in this
[1:47:03] poor wall building and you'll be saved
[1:47:05] they might not like you out there if you
[1:47:07] go out there and I'll love his answer
[1:47:09] should a man like me flee what kind of
[1:47:11] person you take me for
[1:47:13] what kind of man do you think should a
[1:47:16] man should have people like you and I
[1:47:17] should have people like this flee
[1:47:20] we're gonna hide our lamp under a bushel
[1:47:25] yeah I love it amen
[1:47:28] who do you take me for
[1:47:31] who do you take this people for this is
[1:47:33] the most dangerous people
[1:47:35] on the face of the Earth
[1:47:37] listen when trouble troubles them they
[1:47:39] trouble trouble
[1:47:40] don't like coming their way because when
[1:47:42] Trouble Comes their way trouble comes
[1:47:44] out one way and it flees seven
[1:47:46] trouble don't like messing with the
[1:47:48] bride of Christ amen because the more
[1:47:50] you trouble the bride the more they just
[1:47:52] rise up
[1:47:53] they ordained to rise above every
[1:47:56] circumstance every storm and your Eagle
[1:47:59] wings they're more than sufficient when
[1:48:01] when When Storms Come and Trouble Comes
[1:48:04] you're built to fly over it
[1:48:07] I'm not fleeing from that I'll go right
[1:48:10] into it if that's where God leaves me
[1:48:11] I'll go right into it because I'm built
[1:48:13] to handle the pressure you're built to
[1:48:15] handle the pressure you might not think
[1:48:17] getting didn't think he was built for it

[1:49:31] Brown he's the same God that's here
[1:49:33] today for you and I and he's given us a
[1:49:35] Shalom he will not abandon me because of
[1:49:38] the empty threats of some backsliders

[1:49:46] in you even until the end of the age

[1:50:13] not going to serve God or they're going
[1:50:14] to stay home they're going to do this
[1:50:15] and I'm thinking listen those people
[1:50:16] they didn't save me it's like I said
[1:50:18] earlier they didn't die for me they
[1:50:20] didn't raise again for me God never did
[1:50:21] anything wrong to me why would I take it
[1:50:23] out on God who's been faithful the whole
[1:50:25] time
[1:50:27] yes
[1:50:28] hey man you stand for god listen God is
[1:50:32] not looking at your enemies today that
[1:50:34] are arrayed against you and considering

[1:52:15] that's why the Bible says he he's he's
[1:52:17] raging today like he is he knows he's
[1:52:20] got a short time there's nothing he can

[1:54:41] was a man out there on the boat that
[1:54:42] night when it was pitched around like a
[1:54:44] little bottle stopper on the sea when
[1:54:46] ten thousand Devils of sea swore they
[1:54:49] would drown him him out there asleep
[1:54:52] he was so weak
[1:54:54] oh my
[1:54:57] God I'm just so weak listen Christ was
[1:54:59] so weak The Virtue went out of him and
[1:55:01] he was so tired from healing and going
[1:55:04] on that day until maybe the devil said
[1:55:07] we got him out here asleep now
[1:55:10] see that's what the enemy does he waits
[1:55:11] till you're in your worst condition says
[1:55:12] oh I'll get him out of their week I'll
[1:55:15] get him now they're tired I'll get them
[1:55:17] out they're discouraged
[1:55:19] we got him out here asleep now we'll go
[1:55:21] drown him
[1:55:22] was laying back there the waves didn't
[1:55:24] even disturb him
[1:55:26] hey man I love it the disciples they're
[1:55:28] like
[1:55:31] sleeping
[1:55:32] listen they thought he was unconcerned
[1:55:36] sometimes they say well God Karis thou
[1:55:39] not that we perish we're fixing to die
[1:55:41] there's still sleep wake up what's it
[1:55:44] take to wake you up listen all you got
[1:55:45] to say something
[1:55:46] I already told you we're going over we
[1:55:49] also scared him anyway
[1:55:52] don't you care Lord
[1:55:56] not worried about it why are you
[1:56:01] the ways didn't even disturb him he was
[1:56:03] a man when he was laying on that boat
[1:56:04] asleep but when he walked up there when
[1:56:06] they woke him he put his foot upon the
[1:56:08] barrel that boat said Peace
[1:56:11] peace
[1:56:13] be still
[1:56:15] and the winds and the waves obeyed him
[1:56:17] that was more than a man that was God
[1:56:21] speaking through mortalips his son
[1:56:24] Hallelujah
[1:56:25] you see I love that next sentence and
[1:56:28] what Christ was then we have

[1:56:57] disturb them how do you make peace for
[1:57:00] him he still the problem
[1:57:02] he took care of it

[1:57:06] professional fishermen they've been on
[1:57:08] that sea um maybe dozens hundreds of
[1:57:09] times they've been on that seat but
[1:57:11] they're going across the middle but one
[1:57:12] night in the middle of the night they
[1:57:14] didn't seem like a good time to cross
[1:57:15] over did it
[1:57:17] Jesus wasn't worried he said oh no I I'm
[1:57:19] fixing to get my nap in oh I can't wait
[1:57:21] till I get mine today
[1:57:23] thank you wife for driving me home

[1:57:32] them
[1:57:34] and then you might be going through
[1:57:35] problems today you might be going
[1:57:36] through trials but you've got somebody
[1:57:38] in the boat today and listen all you got
[1:57:40] to do is call on him you ain't gonna

[1:57:52] through maybe the storm of my life but
[1:57:54] you know what listen it's not just him
[1:57:56] it's him in you the God of Peace will
[1:57:59] put Satan under your feet

[1:58:48] you can just take it for yourself then

[1:58:52] it to you in the first place God gave it
[1:58:54] to you
[1:58:59] we live in an erotic age
[1:59:02] there's all kinds of anxiety and
[1:59:04] uncertainty and depression and different
