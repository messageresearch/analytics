[35:29] [Music]
[35:31] [Applause]
[35:35] [Music]
[37:05] in prayer
[37:07] and that the Lord would just continue to
[37:09] to comfort them and give him strength I
[37:12] was able to listen to the message that
[37:15] brother Brandon spoke and I just so
[37:18] appreciated that to me he spoke my heart
[37:21] and a lot of the same those are year at
[37:26] the funeral we we went through some of
[37:28] the same points but in in some direction
[37:31] but you we understand that there's a
[37:33] little bit more of a Liberty even among
[37:35] believers to speak things that we can
[37:38] see within the scripture but what a
[37:40] comfort that God has given us through
[37:42] the word I I just I'm so thankful to the
[37:45] Lord and how God is so mindful of it to
[37:48] me when I looked at that and think of
[37:50] how that God would direct brother
[37:52] Brandon my what love and care amen I
[37:56] take you want to see the love and care
[37:58] of God God's love and care to direct and
[38:01] then that our so we just appreciate that
[38:03] with all their hearts and just when it
[38:05] reminds you of the memorial service
[38:09] there with brother for brother John
[38:12] LaFontaine tomorrow we've sent out the
[38:14] announcement back when it came out I
[38:17] think back at the end of January and
[38:18] then also sent it out I had it sent out
[38:21] again the first part of this week it
[38:23] starts at 4:00 p.m. there's details on
[38:26] the email and if you don't happen to
[38:29] have that and you want it to go just
[38:31] check with sister Roseanne she would no
[38:33] doubt be able to look that up for you
[38:35] and and have those details there where
[38:38] it's at and things and so we just want
[38:41] to just want to thank the Lord amen for
[38:45] for for the life of brother Johnny
[38:46] Fontane and so there's just so much that
[38:49] that could be said with that of brother
[38:53] John and we're just looking forward to
[38:54] that tomorrow we want to turn our
[38:57] attention into the word of the Lord this
[38:59] is this evening and just just want to go
[39:03] back into the word here and we've been
[39:06] dealing with healing and there's been a
[39:07] part of this that I've just been there's
[39:10] so many different
[39:13] well I don't want to say angles but yet
[39:15] there are and there are also so many
[39:18] different parts to it and the prayer
[39:21] that that I would have here is that God
[39:25] will just not only would speak so
[39:28] personally to our hearts to give us
[39:29] direction within his word and if there's
[39:33] anything that's out of place or out of
[39:34] line if there's any thinking that's not
[39:36] right well we want to be lined up with
[39:38] the word we certainly we are a people
[39:41] that are of the truth of God's Word and
[39:45] we we are to call to walk in liberty in
[39:47] this hour and we know what it means when
[39:50] the word comes and it brings liberty and
[39:52] even to where probably throughout this
[39:54] building we could testify of certain
[39:56] things beliefs that we have held and yet
[39:59] the word will come by the Spirit of God
[40:01] and we realize wait a minute that was my
[40:03] belief that wasn't the word and God just
[40:05] opens up a part on it you think wow man
[40:08] this is this is Liberty I'm grateful
[40:11] that God that the Spirit of God the
[40:13] promise where the Spirit of the Lord is
[40:15] there is Liberty and we just thank God
[40:18] for that one thing I I like you know has
[40:20] it was placed I heard it place years ago
[40:22] one time it said if if there is
[40:24] something you have and you place it
[40:26] right besides you if God allows you to
[40:29] keep it then go on with it but if God
[40:31] takes it from you let him take it from
[40:33] you and that's what we won we know that
[40:36] God is in control so we want to just
[40:38] take the reading from the word here and
[40:40] there's so much within this scripture
[40:42] reading and I just encourage you don't
[40:44] let it become just a part of what we're
[40:47] reading on Thursday nights but there's
[40:49] so much that's within here and it speaks
[40:51] to our journey in Exodus 15 and verse 22
[40:56] and and the scripture begins in this
[40:59] manner says so Moses brought Israel from
[41:02] the Red Sea and they went out into the
[41:05] wilderness of Shur and they went three
[41:07] days in the wilderness and found the
[41:10] water and when they came to Marah they
[41:13] could not drink of the waters of Marah
[41:15] for they were bitter therefore the name
[41:18] of it was called
[41:20] Marah and the people murmured against
[41:23] Moses saying what shall we drink and he
[41:27] cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed
[41:30] him a tree which when he had cast it
[41:33] into the waters the waters were made
[41:36] sweet and there he made for them a
[41:39] statue and an ordinance and there he
[41:42] proved them and said if thou wilt
[41:46] diligently hearken to the voice of the
[41:48] LORD thy God and will do that which is
[41:51] right in his sight and will give ear to
[41:54] His commandments and keep all his
[41:57] statutes and I will put none of these
[41:59] diseases upon thee which I have brought
[42:03] upon the Egyptians how many say Lord I
[42:06] just want a willing heart that's the
[42:09] greatest defense against every disease
[42:11] is a willing heart amen for I am the
[42:15] Lord that healeth II let's just ask his
[42:19] blessing on the word Heavenly Father we
[42:22] thank you Lord Jesus for your mercy and
[42:25] grace tonight thank you Lord that you
[42:27] have made a way for us and thank you
[42:29] Lord that you have bidden us to come
[42:32] Lord there are no doubt needs that are
[42:35] gathered here tonight
[42:37] questions on hearts Lord and lives Lord
[42:40] that we're in need of direction Lord we
[42:43] ask that you would come and you would
[42:45] take your word Lord and by the
[42:47] leadership of the Holy Spirit through
[42:49] the word guide us and direct us Lord we
[42:52] just pray that you'll anoint a speaker
[42:54] and hear together and in all things
[42:56] receive glory Lord unto yourself we pray
[43:00] we ask it all in the name of Jesus
[43:02] Christ amen
[43:04] and then they god bless you as you're
[43:06] being seated I want to speak to you
[43:09] tonight and take a little a little part
[43:11] here on on on a thought of inspiration
[43:17] and characteristics of healing when we
[43:21] look at Moses here of what had taken
[43:24] place
[43:25] Moses was moved upon by the Spirit of
[43:28] the Lord in the in the present bitter
[43:32] situation he Moses did not know what to
[43:36] do he indeed was the prophet of God for
[43:38] that hour but here is where being the
[43:41] prophet of God for that hour and let me
[43:44] just say to you and I as believers in
[43:46] this hour is to be a vessel that is
[43:49] available to God is to always looking to
[43:52] him knowing that God is the answer for
[43:54] every situation is to know that there is
[43:57] nothing that that transpires or comes
[44:00] about that catches God unaware but God
[44:03] indeed he is the answer not just has it
[44:07] he is the answer and to think of how
[44:09] that when Moses would approach this if
[44:12] we can look at it in this way and the
[44:14] Lord would help us it would be very much
[44:16] like you and I in situations when we
[44:18] come and we face a situation we do not
[44:21] know how the situation is going to
[44:24] unfold but when we can look to the Lord
[44:27] and just when looking to the Lord it
[44:29] comes down to a simple word and that's
[44:32] the word trust it's to trust him in
[44:36] simple childlike faith you know the
[44:39] scriptures will tell us suffer not the
[44:43] little child the little children to come
[44:45] unto me Jesus would take another part in
[44:47] the scripture in Matthew 18 and said and
[44:50] said except you be converted and humble
[44:53] yourself as a little child you shall a
[44:56] know us in SC or enter into the kingdom
[44:59] of heaven
[45:00] we recognize that yet what a contrast we
[45:03] are to mature and and the maturity of a
[45:06] believer does never bring us to a place
[45:09] of of independence but a real maturing
[45:12] of a believer it brings us to a greater
[45:14] dependence we recognize our
[45:17] him more and more we recognize our enemy
[45:21] that we pack around with us and we
[45:24] distrust his thoughts we distrust those
[45:27] voices of and we're able by the help of
[45:30] the Lord to discern that voice and say
[45:32] wait a minute this did not come from the
[45:35] Lord because the Spirit of the Lord
[45:37] brings peace
[45:39] it gives direction it does not bring
[45:42] anxiety and tension but it brings peace
[45:45] and rest so we're able by the Spirit of
[45:48] God to discern the situations that come
[45:51] up and Moses being just like any of us
[45:54] when the situation were happened these
[45:56] waters were unbearable they could not
[46:00] drink from these waters if I can say it
[46:02] like this it was a situation that do you
[46:05] would realize they needed nourishment
[46:07] you know the body can go a long time
[46:09] without food but you cannot go without
[46:12] water you need water we can go a long
[46:16] time you know without that but we need
[46:19] water and this was an unbearable
[46:21] situation water being even that of a of
[46:24] a source of life and refreshment and to
[46:27] think of how it being unbearable and
[46:30] when a situation would become unbearable
[46:33] to look to the Lord and the mercy of the
[46:36] Lord moves down and takes a situation
[46:40] that looks so unbearable and God shows
[46:44] Moses there is a tree and to take this
[46:48] tree and cast that tree into the waters
[46:51] now I know we've looked at this a lot
[46:53] but I want you to catch Moses I don't
[46:56] believe in any way it was just something
[46:58] just casually it was just done but I
[47:01] believe the Spirit of God when he showed
[47:04] Moses a tree and everybody else could
[47:06] have been looking at that tree and they
[47:08] were not under the same channel of
[47:10] inspiration that Moses was under Moses
[47:13] came under the inspiration of God for
[47:17] that moment and for that moment he was
[47:19] directed by the Spirit of God for a
[47:22] people in an unbearable situation take
[47:25] this tree and
[47:27] into the waters and there the waters
[47:30] became sweet he was moved by divine
[47:33] inspiration we are made as people to be
[47:38] moved as believers to be moved upon by
[47:41] the Holy Ghost you see the Scriptures
[47:44] will will speak to us and it monitors us
[47:47] how God will give God alone will give
[47:51] inspiration we can receive a lot of
[47:53] things and somebody tells us this and
[47:55] somebody tells us this and somebody
[47:58] tells us this now listen it isn't that
[48:00] God cannot speak through other channels
[48:02] but there's one thing about it when God
[48:05] speaks there is peace that accompanies
[48:08] his word that's something you can take
[48:11] to the bank
[48:11] peace accompanies the will of God amen
[48:15] and we are thankful for God's grace
[48:17] within that hour you see the Bible would
[48:20] say to us in this manner in 2nd Timothy
[48:23] chapter 3 it would say continued Paul
[48:26] speaking to Timothy continued now in the
[48:29] things which thou has learned and has
[48:31] been assured of knowing of whom thou
[48:33] hast learned them and that from a child
[48:35] thou Husson thou hast known the Holy
[48:37] Scriptures which are able to make thee
[48:41] wise unto salvation through faith which
[48:44] is in Christ Jesus all Scripture is
[48:48] given by inspiration of God how dare men
[48:55] take out portions of the word and say
[48:58] it's not inspired if they would just be
[49:01] truthful they would have to stand there
[49:03] and say I don't believe he does the same
[49:06] things it would be more tolerable for
[49:09] them to say that then it would be to say
[49:12] well this part of the words no longer
[49:14] inspired him it give behooves us to
[49:17] remember it is not us that made God but
[49:20] God made us it is not us that directs
[49:23] caught but it is God that directs us and
[49:25] God has given every bit of Scripture it
[49:29] is that of an is inspired by God and
[49:33] it's profitable for doctrine for reproof
[49:35] for correction for instruction in
[49:38] righteousness that the manner
[49:40] God may be perfect thoroughly furnished
[49:42] unto all good works in the Bible that
[49:46] goes on to say in 2nd Peter chapter 1
[49:48] verse 19 and Peter speaking of the
[49:51] fulfillment of the promise of the Lord
[49:53] Jesus we also have a more sure word of
[49:56] prophecy where until you do well that
[49:58] you take heed as unto a light that shine
[50:01] is in a dark place unto the day star and
[50:03] the day unto the day dawn and the day
[50:06] star arise in your hearts knowing this
[50:08] first that no prophecy of the scripture
[50:11] is of any private interpretation that
[50:16] means it's not isolated if God did it
[50:19] once God will do it again hallelujah if
[50:25] he did it one time he'll do it again why
[50:28] cuz he is the same yesterday today and
[50:31] forever in Malachi 3 I am God and I
[50:35] changed not he is the same Amen so it's
[50:40] not of what he did back there in the Old
[50:44] Testament was only a type and a shadow
[50:47] of what he would do in the New Testament
[50:50] it is only a continual unfolding of the
[50:54] same God his characteristics his
[50:56] character never changes his attitude has
[51:00] never changed his attitude toward sin is
[51:04] the same tonight as it was before and
[51:07] his attitude toward deliverance is the
[51:09] same tonight as it was before his
[51:12] attitude toward healing is the same
[51:14] tonight as it was before for the
[51:21] prophecy I love this for the prophecy
[51:24] came not in old time by the will of man
[51:30] but holy men that word holy it was not
[51:34] that the men themselves were any better
[51:36] than anybody else that word holy means
[51:38] they were separated and set apart unto
[51:42] the Lord they were available and I
[51:45] believe that's the greatest compliment
[51:48] that we can have is that we would be
[51:50] available if God would choose to use us
[51:54] or how God would inspire us we want to
[51:57] be available and notice but holy men of
[52:01] God spake as they were moved by the Holy
[52:05] Ghost so it was not remember these men
[52:08] were speaking things that would be
[52:11] against all science when Isaiah would
[52:14] speak behold a virgin shall conceive
[52:16] there was nothing on record and there
[52:20] was no possible way for that to take
[52:23] place
[52:23] scientifically but what it was is Isaiah
[52:26] being yielded to the Spirit of God he
[52:29] was lifted up out of his senses because
[52:33] if he would have remained in his senses
[52:36] in that or allowed his senses to affect
[52:38] him he'd have reasoned it right out but
[52:41] God in His mercy lifted Isaiah up and
[52:46] Isaiah would speak under the inspiration
[52:49] of the Spirit of God the same Spirit of
[52:52] God that would come and move upon Mary
[52:55] and speak to her that indeed that your
[52:59] womb I'm going to borrow your womb and
[53:01] that which would be conceived in you
[53:04] which you asked how can it be it will be
[53:07] conceived in you by the Holy Ghost it
[53:09] will be a work it will be my work the
[53:13] same Spirit of God that spoke there
[53:15] through Isaiah he announced the way that
[53:18] he would come and God the way the Spirit
[53:21] of Truth it will come it will always
[53:23] come through the channel of his word God
[53:26] can do anything he wants to do but if
[53:29] he'll just stay in the word he's got
[53:31] enough in the word and I'm content with
[53:33] that he'll never go outside of his word
[53:38] it didn't come by the will of man it
[53:42] wasn't men make that statement with
[53:45] Isaiah because it was not as a ax it was
[53:48] not these men who were wanting to I want
[53:51] to say something astounding I want to
[53:53] say something that's gonna all the
[53:55] people as a matter of fact much of their
[53:57] ministry would be upsetting to the
[53:59] people aside from revelations that would
[54:02] be given for the millennium future hold
[54:05] gathering of Israel and yet all through
[54:07] all that there was rebuking of sin that
[54:09] was present it was not something that
[54:12] those men would have chose and legislate
[54:15] to you like this there's a lot of things
[54:17] and pathways and directions and leadings
[54:22] that you and I would never choose we
[54:26] would not choose it in terms of even
[54:30] thinking it to be glorious but yet God
[54:35] receives glory through every situation
[54:40] through every leading through every
[54:45] sickness he receives glory and amid just
[54:49] go on and say in every death he receives
[54:52] glory here is Joe you're in the book of
[55:00] Job here is le hui' or Elihu however you
[55:06] want to pronounce it sometimes you know
[55:08] I've listened to brother Branham and I
[55:10] can't even hardly I can't order to say
[55:12] you your uring to him I say your I'm
[55:14] someone it's just easy for me to say it
[55:16] that way so we just say it that way you
[55:18] know but notice here is you know I who
[55:23] or le who however you want to say it it
[55:27] was that where he remember after all the
[55:30] men had spoke Bildad and he life has all
[55:34] the rest of those guys that were
[55:36] supposed to be comforters and they came
[55:38] accusing Joel all this stuff has
[55:41] happened to you cuz you're a secret
[55:43] sinner if you were more fervent believer
[55:46] this kind of stuff wouldn't be happening
[55:48] let me just tell you something those men
[55:51] right there
[55:52] you know what do you know the reason
[55:54] that they could see those things cuz
[55:55] that was the depth of their revelation
[55:58] they did not that was where their depth
[56:01] stopped right there
[56:02] they did not have and recognize the same
[56:05] depth of God's redemptive grace they
[56:09] didn't have that but it took in this in
[56:11] the time for a lihue to come in that
[56:14] measure and notice what is said in verse
[56:16] 6
[56:17] he says and edited the son of brocco but
[56:20] boos not answered and said I am young
[56:23] and ye are very old wherefore I was
[56:26] afraid and does not show you my opinion
[56:29] I said days should speak and multitude
[56:32] of years should teach wisdom notice the
[56:35] humility hella who did not come in and
[56:37] say why don't you rest y'all just shut
[56:39] up and let me have my turn no humility
[56:41] let it speak God let God let the ages
[56:45] speak out and then he comes he's working
[56:48] in every age but God knows what he's
[56:50] doing you see he hadn't lost control he
[56:53] knows why didn't he send Elly who at
[56:55] first God knows what he's doing
[56:58] hallelujah just like in our lives and
[57:01] many times the beginning of a situation
[57:03] in our lives
[57:04] old Bildad shows up holy laughs ass
[57:07] shows up come on somebody it knocks on
[57:09] your door and wants to save this and say
[57:12] that and say that but thanks be to God
[57:14] there is a visitation from Ella though
[57:18] that can come to our hearts and let us
[57:20] know the real wisdom of God in every
[57:24] situation job was waiting on this I
[57:33] liked when Ella who came he said I am
[57:36] clay as thou our clay
[57:38] I am your request in the stead of God
[57:42] what was he representative it was
[57:44] representative of Jesus Christ look at
[57:49] the scripture but there is a spirit and
[57:53] the inspiration of the Almighty giveth
[57:57] them understanding
[58:00] did you catch that the almighty giveth
[58:03] them inspiration or the inspiration and
[58:05] Almighty giveth them understanding we
[58:09] don't have to work for it we don't have
[58:11] to say oh god I'm just gonna do this and
[58:14] I'm gonna work myself in it you remember
[58:16] you can't work yourself into faith faith
[58:20] is sovereignly given and faith will
[58:25] always find the source it'll always find
[58:30] the perfect will of God there can be a
[58:34] lot of hindrances but when faith finds
[58:37] the source and the perfect will of God
[58:38] faith don't know no hindrance it's
[58:45] something that you or me in our mind
[58:47] can't explain but it's something that's
[58:49] moving us deeper than our mind look at
[58:54] this great men are not always wise
[58:56] neither do the age you'd understand
[58:59] judgment therefore said I hearken to me
[59:03] I also will show non opinion so we we
[59:08] need and I believe this with all my
[59:10] heart that in every situation I believe
[59:13] that we need inspiration from God I
[59:16] believe that I believe we need
[59:18] inspiration when we're coming and we're
[59:20] dealing with our families I believe we
[59:23] need inspiration with the church I
[59:24] believe we need inspiration when it
[59:26] comes to taking direction in our lives
[59:30] whether it be on the job I believe we
[59:32] need inspiration when it comes to
[59:34] approaching healing and I believe
[59:36] there's only one source where
[59:37] inspiration will come and that's through
[59:39] the Word of God that's through the Word
[59:43] of God many times where we make our
[59:46] defeat is when we start looking to other
[59:49] resources but we need to look to the
[59:53] Lord it first starts out with committing
[59:57] committing our lives and the situation
[1:00:00] into the hands of God and if a person if
[1:00:02] you've not I just saved this for
[1:00:04] anybody's here or we'll hear it if
[1:00:05] you've not turned your life over to God
[1:00:08] if you've not turned your heart over to
[1:00:10] God how can you have faith
[1:00:12] to stand for healing all of this extra
[1:00:16] work T works together within the
[1:00:18] continuity of God's Word and I believe
[1:00:20] that every situation if we can just be
[1:00:23] sensitive as believers that the
[1:00:28] inspiration of the Almighty
[1:00:29] the breath of God this word inspiration
[1:00:32] that I just read here out of job 32 six
[1:00:35] that is the same word that in the
[1:00:37] beginning the Lord God breathed into his
[1:00:41] nostrils the breath of life it is God
[1:00:44] who breathes an inspiration it comes
[1:00:47] upon the Word of God it is inspiration
[1:00:50] that comes to guide and direct us in
[1:00:52] approaching the promises of God we must
[1:00:55] have the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:58] amen the breath of God will give us
[1:01:02] understanding faith and peace to direct
[1:01:05] the issue I love the scripture in Psalm
[1:01:08] 68 62 verse 8
[1:01:10] trust in him at all times
[1:01:14] look what it says ye people pour out
[1:01:18] your heart before him
[1:01:21] that word before means in his presence
[1:01:23] God is a refuge for us now this is where
[1:01:32] God he comes God will come in a service
[1:01:37] God will come maybe when you're reading
[1:01:41] in the scriptures and it God will come
[1:01:44] while you're listening to a message
[1:01:46] maybe it will be while you're listening
[1:01:47] to a song or there's something that has
[1:01:50] struck your heart from what you heard
[1:01:52] and you're just kind of ruminating on it
[1:01:54] you're thinking on it you're praying
[1:01:56] about it and about that time when you're
[1:01:58] getting ready on your job to drive the
[1:02:00] nail in or whatever it is inspiration
[1:02:03] strikes within that and you know as well
[1:02:05] as I do there is an accompaniment of the
[1:02:08] presence of God with the inspiration of
[1:02:11] God it is real it's tangible
[1:02:17] we looked at naman here the last time I
[1:02:21] spoke on a Thursday night with healing
[1:02:23] and remember naman came to Elijah by way
[1:02:28] of the little Israelite girl who was
[1:02:33] there serving as a servant in his
[1:02:35] household when naman heard about it
[1:02:38] naman was coming to approach and he
[1:02:42] thought that this is what will take
[1:02:44] place the man of God will come forth
[1:02:46] he'll put his hand upon the area in my
[1:02:49] life and that'll be it and yet when he
[1:02:52] came the man of God didn't even come out
[1:02:54] and greet him the man of God sent the
[1:02:57] messenger DeHaven said go tell him to
[1:03:00] dip seven times in the Jordan
[1:03:02] well that alone was already seemingly
[1:03:05] insulting but you see what naman had
[1:03:08] thought was going to take place remember
[1:03:11] he was Roth he was upset and as we were
[1:03:13] looking at that if it had been up to you
[1:03:16] and I probably any doctor's office they
[1:03:18] too kicked us out then it just said you
[1:03:20] know what you're not gonna take the the
[1:03:22] plan adios well you know and we're no
[1:03:25] longer gonna doctor you is that right
[1:03:27] now so when we see this here it was
[1:03:31] Mehmed he was wanting it to happen a
[1:03:34] certain way but you see God we and I
[1:03:37] cannot it's not by the will of man to
[1:03:40] determine the pathway that healing is
[1:03:43] going to come it is in the hands of God
[1:03:47] to inspire us or what pathway that he is
[1:03:51] going to lead us for healing for one
[1:03:53] thing is for certain
[1:03:55] I am the Lord that heals all that
[1:03:58] diseases he's never ever lost a case the
[1:04:07] very center the center of God's will the
[1:04:11] very center of the King James Bible is
[1:04:13] Psalms 103
[1:04:17] the very center of the Bible Psalms 103
[1:04:20] I bless the Lord O my soul and all that
[1:04:24] is within me who forgiveth thee of all
[1:04:27] thine iniquities who healeth II of all
[1:04:31] that diseases it is the center of his
[1:04:33] will he is the same yesterday today and
[1:04:37] forever we want to know what his will is
[1:04:39] his will has declared that it is the
[1:04:42] center of his will how perfect is the
[1:04:46] will of God
[1:04:57] how's they'e 59:19 of scripture we're
[1:04:59] familiar with when the enemy shall come
[1:05:07] in like a water drop like a trickle like
[1:05:15] a little stream like a like a cool
[1:05:19] refreshing River no like a flood notice
[1:05:26] how it's described it like a flood it's
[1:05:30] encroaching and moving over its
[1:05:32] boundaries it's coming and encroaching
[1:05:37] and God sees the encroachment and that
[1:05:41] flood cannot come unless God permit it
[1:05:44] and just as God would give there the Sun
[1:05:48] and remember now the moon the moon is to
[1:05:51] stand guard in the absence of the Sun it
[1:05:53] is the moon that would control the tides
[1:05:56] to tell the TAT you've gone far enough
[1:05:58] it is the moon that would release it and
[1:06:01] say move up it is that working of the
[1:06:03] reflection of that light in the phases
[1:06:06] of the Moon or as the scripture says the
[1:06:09] ordinances of that moon so when we look
[1:06:14] at this when the enemy shall come in
[1:06:16] like a flood the Spirit of the Lord
[1:06:19] shall lift up a standard against him the
[1:06:26] Spirit of the Lord takes it personally
[1:06:29] when the enemy wants to encroach upon
[1:06:34] the banks of your life he might catch
[1:06:37] your spirit he might touch your body but
[1:06:40] remember when that soul has been sealed
[1:06:42] he cannot touch that soul he can try to
[1:06:47] encroach but remember remember has the
[1:06:50] prophet told us when Satan takes after
[1:06:52] one of God's children
[1:06:54] he's got God on his hands he's got the
[1:06:58] Living God on his hands hallelujah here
[1:07:03] when he he touches you who is the apple
[1:07:05] of his eye
[1:07:07] he's watching over our lives and the
[1:07:11] Spirit of God raises a standard he makes
[1:07:14] his word more sure I wanted look at this
[1:07:20] here just for a moment these are some
[1:07:22] things that just some years ago just in
[1:07:25] fellas shipping and just was some with
[1:07:27] brethren and we were just just to me it
[1:07:30] was things that just rejoiced my heart
[1:07:32] and I want to just bring it in this in
[1:07:33] this light we find in Revelation chapter
[1:07:36] 4 how that the scripture would go on to
[1:07:39] say in verse 1 after these this I looked
[1:07:43] and behold a door was opened in heaven
[1:07:45] and the first voice which I heard was as
[1:07:47] it were of a trumpet talking with me and
[1:07:50] said come up hither and I will show thee
[1:07:52] things which must be Hereafter
[1:07:55] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:07:58] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:08:00] one sat on the throne and they just said
[1:08:03] to it let me just say it like this in
[1:08:04] this manner you see John was available
[1:08:09] are you with me he was available where
[1:08:12] was John act he was not on a lazy boy he
[1:08:15] was not sitting in a living room he was
[1:08:17] not he was on the Isle of Patmos maybe
[1:08:20] he has just lifted his foot from a
[1:08:22] scorpion maybe he had just moved from
[1:08:24] that of a poison a poison serpent he was
[1:08:28] in a condition that was a bitter
[1:08:30] condition but in that place he was going
[1:08:33] to receive a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:08:37] of his coming in the church and the
[1:08:40] folds of his coming clear down to the
[1:08:43] coming of the Gentile to grap sure and
[1:08:45] to the Jews and then returning again in
[1:08:48] Armageddon and there to the Millenium
[1:08:50] into the future all he wouldn't receive
[1:08:53] that and it would give John strength he
[1:08:58] was available for the word to speak to
[1:09:01] him let me just say to you like this
[1:09:04] Willets be honest you and I there's
[1:09:06] times we haven't been available but
[1:09:08] God's grace has come maybe through a
[1:09:10] song service or something's taking place
[1:09:12] because we were lacking Elijah we were
[1:09:14] not ready for the Spirit of God to move
[1:09:16] on us come on don't get feeling down
[1:09:18] look at God's grace for our life you see
[1:09:20] when God when God is going to do
[1:09:22] something there ain't nothing gonna stop
[1:09:23] him
[1:09:25] you can't stop God's will are you with
[1:09:31] me think of it where the Prophet would
[1:09:33] tell people laying there he said if you
[1:09:35] don't get up off that cot you're going
[1:09:37] to die what was that why would he make
[1:09:39] that statement it was to let them know
[1:09:41] it is not your time you have not come to
[1:09:44] the boundary of your time and that
[1:09:47] spurred spoken in due season it would
[1:09:50] inspire them to let him know reach up
[1:09:53] and take a hold of the promise of God's
[1:09:55] Word God's will cannot be defeated he
[1:10:02] don't alter his will his will is perfect
[1:10:08] John was available and because he was
[1:10:11] available
[1:10:12] he heard the response come up hither and
[1:10:14] as he listened look at this as he
[1:10:17] listened immediately
[1:10:19] I was in the spirit as he was just
[1:10:22] listening to the word well what what
[1:10:25] message should I listen to just put him
[1:10:27] one on and immediately I began to speak
[1:10:33] to me and immediately I was in the
[1:10:35] spirit
[1:10:36] glory glory glory and behold a throne
[1:10:39] was set in heaven and one sat on the
[1:10:42] throne you see when you're really
[1:10:43] getting the spirit you don't see three
[1:10:45] gods you don't see three persons when
[1:10:49] you get in the spirit the Spirit of
[1:10:51] Truth who is the word you don't see
[1:10:53] multiple you see one and he that said
[1:10:59] was to look upon like Jasper and a-star
[1:11:03] sardine stone and there was a rainbow
[1:11:05] around about the throne in sight like
[1:11:07] unto an emerald you know what John was
[1:11:10] looking at John is looking at the same
[1:11:12] thing when you and I can look and see
[1:11:14] him revealed in the word he is the
[1:11:16] author and the finisher of our faith and
[1:11:22] around about the throne were four and 20
[1:11:26] seats and upon the seats I saw four and
[1:11:28] twenty elders sitting clothed in white
[1:11:29] raiment and they had on their heads
[1:11:31] crowns of gold and out of the throne
[1:11:34] proceeded lightnings thunderings and
[1:11:36] voices I remember as brother Ram would
[1:11:40] tell us that's lives of holiness being
[1:11:43] lived here and there were seven lamps of
[1:11:48] fire burning before the throne which are
[1:11:52] the seven spirits of God same spirit
[1:11:54] because God is one is that right but
[1:11:57] it's God unfolding himself remember like
[1:12:00] that of the rainbow it's every one the
[1:12:02] characteristic you cannot tell me and
[1:12:04] say well I love I love rainbows you do
[1:12:06] yeah like I like red well red is not the
[1:12:09] only color of the rainbow neither is the
[1:12:12] attribute of grace the only the only
[1:12:14] attribute of God he's also a deliberate
[1:12:17] he's also a judge come on somebody every
[1:12:20] one of these are attributes of the same
[1:12:23] God
[1:12:24] aren't you glad that judgment broke upon
[1:12:27] the situation in our life to lift the
[1:12:30] curse that was on our life and remove it
[1:12:33] from us and put it back on the devil and
[1:12:35] bring deliverance and change us aren't
[1:12:38] you grateful for the attributes of God
[1:12:40] grace provided that and not all that was
[1:12:43] unfolded all of these things Oh glory be
[1:12:48] to God well we're trying to get
[1:12:50] somewhere verse 6 and before the throne
[1:12:53] there was a sea of glass like unto
[1:12:55] crystal notice this was not flaming fire
[1:12:59] shooting out of this one this is the
[1:13:02] representation of the Church of the
[1:13:04] Living God where the clarity of the Holy
[1:13:07] Ghost is reflected perfectly through her
[1:13:10] life it's a perfect reflection bone of
[1:13:15] his bone flesh of his flesh you know and
[1:13:17] in the midst of the throne and around
[1:13:21] about the throne were four beasts full
[1:13:23] of eyes before him behind remember this
[1:13:25] is symbolic I'm going to touch on this
[1:13:27] now and whenever they were full of eyes
[1:13:29] before me and behind
[1:13:31] amen and the first beast was like a lion
[1:13:34] the second beast was like a calf and the
[1:13:38] third beast had a face of a man and the
[1:13:41] fourth beast was like a flying eagle and
[1:13:44] the four beasts look at this and the
[1:13:47] four beasts had each of them six wings
[1:13:49] about him and they were full of eyes
[1:13:52] within and they rest not day and night
[1:13:55] saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty
[1:13:57] which was and is and is to come and when
[1:14:01] those beasts give glory and honor and
[1:14:04] thanks to him that sat on the throne who
[1:14:06] liveth for ever and ever the four and
[1:14:08] twenty elders fall down before him that
[1:14:10] sat on the throne and they worship Him
[1:14:12] that livin liveth for ever and ever and
[1:14:16] cast their crowns crowns before the
[1:14:18] throne saying thou art worthy O Lord to
[1:14:21] receive glory and honor and power for
[1:14:25] thou has created all things and for thy
[1:14:27] pleasure they are and were created
[1:14:29] notice when these poor and living
[1:14:32] creatures as it said in verse 9 when
[1:14:35] they begin to give glory and thanks it
[1:14:37] has an effect that is also felt clear
[1:14:41] into the heavens to where it radiates
[1:14:45] out and it brings glory and honor not to
[1:14:48] three separate people it brings glory
[1:14:50] and honor for thou art worthy when this
[1:14:55] inspiration strikes the life it brings
[1:14:58] glory and honor to the Lamb of God now
[1:15:03] brother Branham would pick this up in
[1:15:05] the revelation series and he would take
[1:15:08] this of your notice we will refer a
[1:15:11] little bit tonight possibly to Ezekiel
[1:15:14] very briefly tonight but you'll notice
[1:15:16] it's foreign living creatures and notice
[1:15:19] within it they are guards of the ark or
[1:15:23] of the mercy seat do you not have been a
[1:15:27] Benjamin do you have that one slide give
[1:15:28] me the slide that is that is there why
[1:15:31] read this to John Saul four of them he
[1:15:37] saw four living creatures now watch he
[1:15:40] said now they both seen the same vision
[1:15:42] he's talking about Ezekiel and he's
[1:15:45] talking about John he said now for
[1:15:48] remember four is an Earthling number
[1:15:51] four means it is an earthly number it
[1:15:56] means deliverance are you with me now
[1:15:59] you see when we look at deliverance
[1:16:02] there were three Hebrew children that
[1:16:05] went into the fiery furnace but when the
[1:16:07] fourth one coming he brought deliverance
[1:16:11] are you with me now Lazarus was in the
[1:16:14] grave three days but when he came the
[1:16:17] first one
[1:16:18] it brought deliverance inspiration came
[1:16:23] the Hebrew children not by the will of
[1:16:26] man the Hebrew children went in there
[1:16:28] not knowing we don't know if God's gonna
[1:16:31] deliver us
[1:16:32] I don't know how God's gonna heal me I
[1:16:34] don't know what pathway he's gonna take
[1:16:36] he might just take me on home and heal
[1:16:39] me on the other side either way I'm
[1:16:41] gonna be healed but there's one thing
[1:16:42] for sure I'm
[1:16:43] renouncing the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:16:46] I ain't bowing down to no devil what God
[1:16:51] has said is true let every man's work be
[1:16:55] a lie
[1:16:55] and let God's Word be the truth they
[1:16:59] stood on that word and what happened
[1:17:01] here came the fourth man here came
[1:17:04] earthly deliverance probita God for he
[1:17:12] said he's God's a number of deliverance
[1:17:14] so it shows that these beings must have
[1:17:17] been something about the earth and
[1:17:19] remember for people who are new I've got
[1:17:22] some that are young even much younger in
[1:17:24] the faith and it's money and listen to
[1:17:26] me very closely as your pastor this is
[1:17:28] symbols the book of Revelation is
[1:17:31] symbols it takes one sent from God it's
[1:17:36] not the mind of the man interpreting
[1:17:39] it's the Spirit of God through the
[1:17:41] channel and office that he has chosen in
[1:17:44] his season of time it takes a prophet to
[1:17:47] reveal the symbols in the days of Daniel
[1:17:50] and the writing was on the wall all the
[1:17:52] wise men came and could not interpret
[1:17:55] that writing but remember that was one
[1:17:57] who said I remember in the days of the
[1:18:00] Pentecostal fathers I remember there is
[1:18:03] one who could interpret the writing and
[1:18:05] they call for him and here comes Daniel
[1:18:08] and Daniel interprets what is there not
[1:18:11] Daniel's mind
[1:18:12] Daniel was a prophet of God a vessel set
[1:18:15] aside that the inspiration of the old
[1:18:18] Mahdi could move down and interpret
[1:18:21] judgment is at hand the book of
[1:18:26] Revelation is a book of symbols for
[1:18:34] beasts it says they have four faces now
[1:18:39] let me just read a little bit out of the
[1:18:41] Book of Ezekiel there's much scripture
[1:18:42] we can go into here in the Book of
[1:18:45] Ezekiel
[1:18:47] hallelujah now look at this what knows
[1:18:51] some of the characteristics in ezekiel
[1:18:53] chapter 1 verse 12 then could you go to
[1:18:56] that for me please I know I've got you
[1:18:58] back there multitask and you're doing a
[1:19:00] wonderful job and they everyone went
[1:19:07] straight forward notice the
[1:19:08] characteristic here when they moved they
[1:19:11] went straight forward whether the spirit
[1:19:14] was to go they went and they turned not
[1:19:18] when they went now put that slide back
[1:19:20] up here now buddy you can talk to when
[1:19:28] we get home but I'll be in bed before
[1:19:29] you talk to me
[1:19:40] well I'm not going to him and it had
[1:19:41] special because you'll probably have it
[1:19:42] up here in a moment
[1:19:43] you just through keynote just just
[1:19:51] all right can you all see that okay
[1:19:53] enough when you look at this this is
[1:19:56] where this is a descriptive not as long
[1:19:58] as she wants you to see it's all symbol
[1:20:00] it's the same Holy Ghost but it's the
[1:20:06] characteristic
[1:20:07] he takes it's the characteristic in the
[1:20:10] situation it's the need for the hour so
[1:20:14] when it is that they were coming in a
[1:20:16] certain direction and obviously handed
[1:20:18] up there before they queue you and maybe
[1:20:20] have it in your mind if I'm standing
[1:20:22] right here and we're looking at that one
[1:20:24] right there that that second one over
[1:20:25] there we're standing over here you don't
[1:20:27] see all four faces when you're standing
[1:20:29] here all that you would see coming at
[1:20:31] you is the man anointing you see where
[1:20:34] you're standing the position that you're
[1:20:36] in if you're over here if I was over
[1:20:40] here facing this way
[1:20:42] what on what I would see is that uh on
[1:20:45] the other side would be the Ox you can
[1:20:46] see the horns all I would see is the Ox
[1:20:48] anointing coming at me what's in the
[1:20:51] center that is the Ark of the Covenant
[1:20:54] which what does that speak of its that
[1:20:56] is of wood wood speaks of humanity it is
[1:21:00] covered with deity when you look at that
[1:21:03] particular art it's got a crown on the
[1:21:06] top of it but remember they had to put
[1:21:09] blood on that crown and when the Holy
[1:21:12] Ghost has come into your heart and wrote
[1:21:15] upon the tablets of your heart it has
[1:21:17] taken that blood and applied it to your
[1:21:19] life and we are encompassed about with
[1:21:23] Christ if you're standing on this side
[1:21:27] all you see coming at you is the eagle
[1:21:29] anointing you see it's the position
[1:21:33] you're in for your day the position
[1:21:38] you're in but there it puts you in a
[1:21:40] place to receive the inspiration for the
[1:21:43] hour you see where your sandy it puts
[1:21:46] your brother Joey ready to receive the
[1:21:49] inspiration for the hour so when we look
[1:21:53] at this keep it up there out and keep it
[1:21:54] up there bin when we look at this here
[1:21:56] the Bible would say in Ezekiel 119 that
[1:21:59] when the living creatures wilt the Wills
[1:22:02] went by them we remember
[1:22:04] what were the wheels those that touch
[1:22:06] the earth will speak of what movement
[1:22:08] the Spirit of God moving right the Word
[1:22:13] of God moving there is a destination
[1:22:15] when they came out of Egypt it was to
[1:22:17] bring him out and bring him into the
[1:22:19] land of promise so notice now and when
[1:22:22] the living creatures were lifted up from
[1:22:23] the earth the wheels were lifted up
[1:22:26] whether soever verse 20 the spirit was
[1:22:29] to go they went thither was their spirit
[1:22:33] to go notice whether so ever these
[1:22:35] spirit was to go their spirit was to go
[1:22:38] you recognize that it is our faith God
[1:22:42] comes to inspire our faith our faith
[1:22:45] comes in there under the inspiration of
[1:22:48] his leadership and that's why brother
[1:22:51] Graham said if God he said if God can
[1:22:54] get my faith and get your faith lined up
[1:22:56] he said then God's faith will come down
[1:22:59] and step behind our faith together and
[1:23:02] back up the promise what grace to even
[1:23:06] get our faith in order
[1:23:08] I couldn't get my faith in order but we
[1:23:12] can if we look to him and say Lord if
[1:23:14] there's anything out of line
[1:23:16] we Lord if I said something wrong if I
[1:23:18] got a grudge somewhere the Lord I love
[1:23:20] that person really God gives us grace to
[1:23:23] do what get ourselves in line so the
[1:23:26] inspiration to come what is that that is
[1:23:29] his love and mercy somebody with me
[1:23:35] tonight her glory and the wheels were
[1:23:40] lifted up over against him for the
[1:23:42] spirit of the living creatures was in
[1:23:45] the Wills Wendy when those went these
[1:23:47] win so you're not just gonna go and you
[1:23:50] know hear this one going you know here
[1:23:54] coming to eagle and ninth-inning
[1:23:55] well the restroom and just gonna you
[1:23:57] know they're just going to sit there no
[1:23:58] it all moves together every direction
[1:24:03] God gives us in his word it might come
[1:24:06] contrary than the way were wanting it it
[1:24:08] may not come the way we're thinking
[1:24:10] about it but one thing about it if we're
[1:24:13] standing upon his word remember all of
[1:24:16] heaven
[1:24:17] is backing up and colorimeter God you
[1:24:21] might be like the little policeman that
[1:24:23] couldn't stop a runaway Pony but you
[1:24:25] have Authority you got the badge of
[1:24:28] believer but tokens showing I wish I
[1:24:33] could run but I got a preach and when
[1:24:37] these were to lift it up from the earth
[1:24:39] the wheels were lifted up over against
[1:24:41] her for the spirit of the living
[1:24:43] creatures was in the wheel now in the
[1:24:45] scripture here and I'm just gonna skip
[1:24:47] over this in the scripture jumping on
[1:24:48] down to verse 26 27 and 28 it speaks of
[1:24:52] the firmament above that of the four
[1:24:54] living creatures they looked and saw a
[1:24:56] man one who sat on the throne they saw
[1:24:59] one who was who with blow from the loins
[1:25:02] downward and the loins upward what is
[1:25:05] that speaking of it's speaking of the
[1:25:07] church that is clothed in the
[1:25:09] resurrection power of Jesus Christ amen
[1:25:13] they have come under the blood of Jesus
[1:25:16] Christ under the word for their day it
[1:25:18] is Christ being reflected in your life
[1:25:25] and in the life of Christ there were
[1:25:32] times it was the lion in the life of
[1:25:36] Christ there are times it was the ox and
[1:25:40] I'm not the same Holy Ghost remember
[1:25:43] what Jesus said John 5:19 it brings us
[1:25:45] back to this place
[1:25:46] it shows the maturity of the hour the
[1:25:48] Sun can do nothing but what he see the
[1:25:50] father doing that do it the son likewise
[1:25:52] brother Branham would quickly keep
[1:25:54] continue to point out to us over and
[1:25:56] over and over and over
[1:25:56] he said the prophets didn't do what they
[1:25:58] wanted to do he said Jesus didn't heal
[1:26:00] he said he was led by the spirit to do
[1:26:04] what the father showed him and that
[1:26:08] inspiration can't think about the people
[1:26:10] who were laying there
[1:26:11] the man who was impotent for 38 years if
[1:26:13] you and I have a condition for I don't
[1:26:16] know how many years it doesn't matter
[1:26:17] what it is but it's nothing too great
[1:26:20] for the Lord you know when I read that
[1:26:23] situation you know and it tells me it
[1:26:25] tells me there's nothing that's too
[1:26:27] insignificant for the Lord
[1:26:30] it tells me brother joy that God don't
[1:26:32] st. now you can live with it go ahead
[1:26:33] and live with it that ain't how God
[1:26:34] looks at it this man in order if 38
[1:26:37] years brother Graham said he had a
[1:26:38] condition that wasn't gonna kill him
[1:26:42] but here God came down and he let his
[1:26:45] son write in the book of John as an
[1:26:50] eagle are you with me now in the book of
[1:26:56] Mark I think maybe I in the book of Mark
[1:26:59] here we have that you know the wisdom of
[1:27:01] man and seeing these things come about
[1:27:03] now this is where I want to just bring
[1:27:05] us into this place here tonight in the
[1:27:08] fifth seal brother Branham this quote is
[1:27:10] these things that just just always it's
[1:27:13] wrung out to my heart and been so dear
[1:27:15] to me brother Graham talks about each of
[1:27:18] these ages remember these four living
[1:27:21] creatures it's the same spirit of God
[1:27:23] that there is a characteristic that is
[1:27:26] to be made manifest among the people of
[1:27:29] God there have been seven Gentile church
[1:27:32] ages which you can read in the Book of
[1:27:34] Revelations where God has been calling
[1:27:36] and taking a people for his namesake it
[1:27:40] has always been the holy spirit that has
[1:27:42] been calling to the people but remember
[1:27:44] God just does not call people into a
[1:27:47] church he is summoning his people and
[1:27:50] gathering them into himself the word he
[1:27:54] will lead us to himself by the word and
[1:27:58] to think that that inspiration that
[1:28:01] would fall upon upon the ages throughout
[1:28:03] of how that God would begin there with
[1:28:06] that of the lion anointing they would
[1:28:08] come out of the Upper Room where the
[1:28:10] lion had roared and here they came out
[1:28:12] roaring they roared for those three ages
[1:28:15] and then it moved over into the next
[1:28:17] stage there and then it comes forth with
[1:28:20] that of the Ox were they loved not their
[1:28:22] lives unto death were they surrendered
[1:28:25] and they submitted their lives and then
[1:28:27] it moved from there into that of a man
[1:28:29] anointing God raising up a man by the
[1:28:32] name of Luther and begin the Reformation
[1:28:35] what's God doing he's building back his
[1:28:37] church not by might not by power but by
[1:28:40] my spear
[1:28:41] it says the Lord this mountain shall be
[1:28:43] removed and even worked under that man
[1:28:46] anointing and then it comes to the Eagle
[1:28:48] anointing that is broke upon this last
[1:28:51] day why would it be an eagle anointing
[1:28:53] at the last because the promise is the
[1:28:56] coming of the Lord it is the promise of
[1:28:59] rapture and that of an eagle and eagle
[1:29:02] swoops down and lays claim and it lifts
[1:29:06] up it takes out it lifts and takes unto
[1:29:11] its abode and that's what the Spirit of
[1:29:14] God is doing in this hour
[1:29:17] that's the culmination it's the rapture
[1:29:19] of xix
[1:29:20] that's upon the Church of the Living God
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:30] the brem said they were under the
[1:29:32] inspiration of the Spirit of God
[1:29:35] let me just read it to you he said how
[1:29:38] could they do anything else besides the
[1:29:41] power of God that had been released to
[1:29:44] them
[1:29:46] so now I'm going to set this up to
[1:29:48] represent something if God sends a
[1:29:51] certain spirit among them that's the
[1:29:54] only thing that they can work by is the
[1:29:58] spirit that works among them
[1:30:03] that's humility to let him work that's
[1:30:11] humility
[1:30:16] blow dam goes on to say he says now the
[1:30:19] church they responded to that anointing
[1:30:23] and they couldn't do nothing else but
[1:30:26] responded that anointing he talks about
[1:30:28] the line just for sake of time let me
[1:30:30] just skim over this for tonight the lion
[1:30:33] roared here they came out they they they
[1:30:36] they responded to that anointing they
[1:30:38] were made to respond to that anointing
[1:30:40] it's just like your phone if I dial your
[1:30:43] number you were hooked up to a network
[1:30:46] that's made to respond to that signal I
[1:30:48] could I could say I could take brother
[1:30:51] Drake's number and say I'm gonna call
[1:30:53] brother Shane
[1:30:54] I could call and say this is who I'm
[1:30:56] trying to call this is what I'm gonna
[1:30:57] call if brothers shamed us and have that
[1:31:00] number and he's not tapped into that you
[1:31:02] doesn't matter how much I say I want to
[1:31:04] contact him I'm not gonna be getting in
[1:31:07] contact with him what it shows is the
[1:31:10] Spirit of God is released by the word of
[1:31:12] God and there are those who are ordained
[1:31:17] to receive that anointing of the word in
[1:31:21] this hour you may have a problem seeing
[1:31:28] yourself in it but God ain't never
[1:31:31] changed what he sees about you you might
[1:31:34] need some divine assistance like we all
[1:31:37] have needed and we need but God is able
[1:31:40] to show you you can look at something
[1:31:42] and say it's truth but I don't know
[1:31:44] about me that inspiration is here in the
[1:31:48] building tonight to open your eyes
[1:31:50] that you might be able to see yourself
[1:31:53] in the back we can never by our own will
[1:31:57] see ourselves
[1:31:59] it takes a surrender of our little and
[1:32:02] the inspiration comes to lift us from
[1:32:06] this defeated state it comes to lift us
[1:32:10] into a realm that we've bumped into
[1:32:13] throughout our life and it lifts us into
[1:32:16] that place
[1:32:20] what does that the mercy of God you know
[1:32:29] what I'm talking about you try to run
[1:32:31] from and get away from it you can't you
[1:32:34] know what you're a danger this life
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:39] gotta let you go so far sir four enough
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:45] you question whether I was interested in
[1:32:48] you you question whether I let you you
[1:32:51] question whether you was a part of this
[1:32:53] [Music]
[1:32:55] it's the mercy of Almighty God his
[1:32:59] inspiration comes to you and I owe the
[1:33:07] Lord Jesus
[1:33:14] when a king time for them to give their
[1:33:19] lives unto death he had the anointing
[1:33:24] marriage of church and state in the
[1:33:26] pergamus age a uniting of this then here
[1:33:32] we find right after in that time right
[1:33:34] after that here moves into the ox
[1:33:36] anointing were then now it moves from
[1:33:40] that of the lion and northing same Holy
[1:33:41] Ghost but it moves into that place well
[1:33:45] here they are they're taken and they
[1:33:48] have to give their lives they're giving
[1:33:53] their lives I'm not going to spend a lot
[1:33:56] of time on this tonight they could only
[1:33:58] respond to the anointing that was on let
[1:34:01] me just move ahead to this and this is
[1:34:03] where almost stopped tonight these four
[1:34:07] anointings it's the same Holy Spirit
[1:34:12] it's God inspiring our faith in Him
[1:34:16] empowering us to meet the challenge the
[1:34:21] waters of Marah that are before you
[1:34:24] God inspires us to meet the challenge
[1:34:27] now in every one even though under the
[1:34:29] characteristic in this hour we are under
[1:34:31] the eagle anointing but yet in our
[1:34:35] everyday walk every one of these
[1:34:37] characteristics are made manifest in our
[1:34:41] marriages every one of these
[1:34:42] characteristics are made manifest
[1:34:44] there's times to Aurora like the line
[1:34:47] there's time to sacrifice your idea
[1:34:49] there's times to raise and rise above it
[1:34:52] like an eagle there's times to use
[1:34:54] wisdom to know this is the right time to
[1:34:56] bring it up wrong time to bring it up
[1:34:58] it's time these we work under these
[1:35:01] anointings because they are in earthly
[1:35:03] deliverance every face let me just say
[1:35:08] like this every face is an aspect of the
[1:35:11] same Holy Spirit and his power of
[1:35:13] deliverance as we pray God responds to
[1:35:18] our faith by looking our way with a
[1:35:21] facet of his deliverance now if we had
[1:35:26] our choice we would take certain facets
[1:35:29] certain phases to look at us there'd be
[1:35:33] certain characteristics we want we would
[1:35:35] Satan probably many of us would say I
[1:35:37] always want the Eagle looking when I'm
[1:35:38] praying for healing I want to see the
[1:35:40] Eagle but God might show you the Ox God
[1:35:45] might show the lion but it's all God and
[1:35:50] they just say this without reading cults
[1:35:52] that I've read to you before all healing
[1:35:54] comes from God but the brand had a
[1:35:57] doctor said brother Bantam do you
[1:35:59] believe that you really get medicine
[1:36:00] heals brother brems says sure he said I
[1:36:02] believe God heals by medicine he said
[1:36:05] God heals by love God heals by music God
[1:36:08] heals by surgery God heals by he goes on
[1:36:11] and on he said but remember it all
[1:36:13] depends on what kind of healing you need
[1:36:14] he said after all it's everything it's
[1:36:17] God heals cuz I'm the Lord that he loved
[1:36:20] all that diseases are you with me so
[1:36:26] when the lion anointing would empower
[1:36:28] your faith
[1:36:30] he comes forth with a boldness and a
[1:36:33] great courage
[1:36:34] tenacious fight for healing or you never
[1:36:39] backing down you might say that's why I
[1:36:42] want to approach this God may not be
[1:36:44] anointing you as a lion in this one are
[1:36:48] you with me
[1:36:49] come on now we remember we're made not
[1:36:52] by the will of man but they came they
[1:36:55] were set aside and moved by the Holy
[1:36:57] Ghost
[1:36:58] remember it's the spirit that come into
[1:37:00] the Wills are you with me which wherever
[1:37:03] the spirit was to go their spirit went
[1:37:06] also see we are lambs to be led but the
[1:37:12] other the other banner is the Eagle and
[1:37:14] the Eagle anointing is a miracle let me
[1:37:17] just put it like this all healing and I
[1:37:19] want you to hear me clearly
[1:37:21] all healing is a miracle listen I know
[1:37:28] it's also had to go through surgery I'm
[1:37:30] getting to that anointing in a minute
[1:37:32] all healing comes by God it's no less
[1:37:39] faith than another matter of fact I can
[1:37:45] read out read you here problem coming
[1:37:46] weeks brother Bram said it he said if
[1:37:48] God come down and positively healed you
[1:37:50] right now he said you know he would
[1:37:51] actually take greater faith to take a
[1:37:53] promise and stand on it and look for it
[1:37:56] to come to pass than that but our mind
[1:37:58] says man it's a miracle it's aren't you
[1:38:01] glad God just comes and says doctor said
[1:38:06] hey brother name is sister name and let
[1:38:08] me friends I'm glad for me I don't know
[1:38:12] about you I'm glad for me but on my
[1:38:13] heart these things are just waiting and
[1:38:15] looking to it that it would be a help to
[1:38:17] us be an eagle anointing brother Joey it
[1:38:20] comes by and picks us up well one moment
[1:38:23] we're sick one moment were I mean there
[1:38:26] is no wait the saint of gradual the
[1:38:28] eagle anointing is my gradually becoming
[1:38:31] you know day by day step by step did you
[1:38:33] pick you up right away
[1:38:34] it's gone
[1:38:38] then we have the man anointing but it's
[1:38:42] still God how many are glad for Luther's
[1:38:46] message
[1:38:47] Wesley's message do you look at Luther's
[1:38:49] message and say well you know Luther's
[1:38:51] know Ava's God the man anointing is
[1:38:54] still God it's God healing through the
[1:38:58] intelligence of man woo Amen God uses
[1:39:04] surgeons and medicine with knowledge
[1:39:07] that came from him for his healing work
[1:39:12] so what are you saying well a person
[1:39:15] could say you know what I went up and I
[1:39:17] was prayed for for an ulcer and you know
[1:39:19] what hit left me another person can say
[1:39:21] how when and you know what had an ulcer
[1:39:23] and they operate on me I'm healed this
[1:39:27] person has no glory over this person it
[1:39:30] was God who gave me inspiration all
[1:39:35] healing comes from God and then the last
[1:39:39] one we don't like to maybe talk about it
[1:39:41] too much but the ox' anointing
[1:39:44] if the ox' anointing looks our way
[1:39:47] it's death surrendering giving life
[1:39:54] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[1:39:58] death of his Saints God heals even in
[1:40:03] death
[1:40:11] I went up next to that little casket I
[1:40:13] stood right there right next to
[1:40:14] Liliana's casket I stood right there
[1:40:16] with my wife I looked at her on that bed
[1:40:18] when we went up there to pray on that
[1:40:20] Friday night I came home and told my
[1:40:21] wife I said I don't know if she's still
[1:40:24] in that body or not her she's already
[1:40:25] crossed to that other body I said I
[1:40:28] don't know I said I don't know how where
[1:40:30] where it's just at right there because I
[1:40:32] said they might be keeping that that
[1:40:34] body alive I said but you know brother
[1:40:36] Richard I think Rachel had sister Rachel
[1:40:38] I mentioned that we just had no longer
[1:40:40] walked out of the room
[1:40:42] she comes to for a moment says it's okay
[1:40:48] you say what was that all about well I'm
[1:40:50] not trying to interpret everything but
[1:40:52] if you've seen what she saw you'd say
[1:40:55] it's okay I couldn't act like this in a
[1:41:04] funeral home but I'm free to act like
[1:41:06] this now if you two saw what she saw
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:14] program said before that age of
[1:41:17] accountability he said that child cannot
[1:41:19] it's innocent he said it doesn't matter
[1:41:22] if it's the Andria's parents or whatever
[1:41:23] more behold the lamb of God that taketh
[1:41:26] away the sin of the world it was the
[1:41:28] blood of the Lamb that pay for that
[1:41:31] atonement brother Branham said as soon
[1:41:35] as that child passes out of this life it
[1:41:38] goes into the arms of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:42] he said the very moment it gets there it
[1:41:45] recognizes the cross of Calvary and what
[1:41:48] Calvary cared for it hallelujah she
[1:41:57] didn't want to come back to that body
[1:42:01] I'm telling you even though here she was
[1:42:04] seven years old right brother Richard
[1:42:06] she was seven years old but she had
[1:42:09] already crossed into a dimension that
[1:42:11] I've preached about him I've lived from
[1:42:14] the life of that dimension but she
[1:42:16] already had crossed there God's Word was
[1:42:22] not defeated
[1:42:25] it may not have been when we were
[1:42:27] looking for of a line anointing or an
[1:42:29] eagle anointing or a man Ananta but an
[1:42:32] oxen intent if she stood her testimony
[1:42:35] throughout it all she states those
[1:42:37] treatments day after day without
[1:42:40] bitterness or resentment I'm telling you
[1:42:42] I wasn't it was an anointing that was
[1:42:45] there I'm free to preach now she stepped
[1:42:53] from that body into a body somewhere
[1:42:56] between 18 and 25 years old and the
[1:43:06] presence of the Lord had come in the
[1:43:08] room I don't know if she opened her eyes
[1:43:11] I don't know what but she was enough to
[1:43:13] say it's okay if they knew what she was
[1:43:17] seeing they would say it's more than
[1:43:18] okay well does it tear the heart yes I
[1:43:26] think of brother Richard and sister
[1:43:28] Maria that's her grandbaby but you see
[1:43:30] as a believer we have a hope sure we're
[1:43:36] sorrowful surely more sure they're gonna
[1:43:39] need our prayer and our comfort but
[1:43:41] they've gotta hope they know it's not a
[1:43:43] mystery to them they that are alive and
[1:43:48] remain shall not hinder you got another
[1:43:56] one to come to you don't worry I don't
[1:44:00] got my glasses on but I can see both of
[1:44:01] you you got one to come to you another
[1:44:03] one don't worry you'll know and you
[1:44:07] won't need no iPhone with face let me
[1:44:09] see what you look when you're 18 years
[1:44:11] old you'll know the glory of God God
[1:44:20] rich in mercy
[1:44:32] even in death God heals I think I'm my
[1:44:37] daddy he got to a place moving him
[1:44:39] shuffling feet he's in pain
[1:44:42] couldn't hard to sleep he's sugar all
[1:44:44] over the board and he fought like crazy
[1:44:46] to keep those things in line wouldn't
[1:44:47] eat after certain times what's this
[1:44:49] what's that and all those things like
[1:44:51] that but you know what that morning he
[1:44:58] doesn't need no cane over there brother
[1:45:03] Carlos he went from shuffling to running
[1:45:06] [Applause]
[1:45:10] he had the aneurysm and the brain bleed
[1:45:13] on this side right here but you know
[1:45:15] what it was just the time and the
[1:45:18] inspiration moved upon him little Sammy
[1:45:21] did you all try to pray for him and you
[1:45:24] prayed that God would heal him we sure
[1:45:26] did
[1:45:26] the joy I prayed all the way to the
[1:45:28] Cleveland Hospital but in my heart there
[1:45:31] was a piece that I know if this is your
[1:45:34] Time Lord did that stop the waves and
[1:45:36] everything from coming it did not stop
[1:45:38] the waves of grief from coming it did
[1:45:40] not stop when there's a certain smell a
[1:45:42] certain sound when there's a certain
[1:45:44] thing it did not stop that but you know
[1:45:46] what it gives me grace to know I see you
[1:45:49] in the morning you love the Lord may God
[1:45:56] help us as we would look at these things
[1:45:57] through his word tonight amen healing
[1:46:01] it's simply healing taking place the Ox
[1:46:04] anointing it's healing in another
[1:46:06] dimension and whatever way that God
[1:46:10] responds he's the Lord that healeth all
[1:46:15] our diseases this I mean what should I
[1:46:21] do
[1:46:21] don't be anxious don't be anxious just
[1:46:25] look to the Lord Simon I don't know
[1:46:27] whether I'm to take this path or that
[1:46:29] don't be anxious what should I do
[1:46:31] I would just pray I'd stay in the word
[1:46:34] and I'd expect the spirit to move on my
[1:46:38] spirits
[1:46:39] because the spirit will move in the
[1:46:42] Wills
[1:46:43] to direct us let's pray father we love
[1:46:47] you tonight Lord we appreciate you
[1:46:51] one mercy that you had given to us Lord
[1:46:55] what I thought about Lord these things
[1:46:59] for quite some time lord Hallett's it's
[1:47:06] meant so much to me and didn't know
