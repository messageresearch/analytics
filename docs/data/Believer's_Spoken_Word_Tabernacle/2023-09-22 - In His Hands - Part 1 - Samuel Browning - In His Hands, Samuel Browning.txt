thought of that the scripture we were ending with apologize for that on Sunday I just meditated throughout on that scripture where the lord taketh pleasure in his people and he will beautify the meek with salvation dude you realize every step of the way when God was even dealing with your life and my life God it was God taking pleasure in dealing with our lives even when it didn't seem like anything was taking place if you would have asked our family or anybody else around us they would say I don't think anything's taking place but God was taking pleasure and God takes pleasure in working with our lives and bringing us to a place of surrender filling us with his life walking inside of us every step of the way God takes pleasure God takes pleasure when we reach up to him and say Lord I need strength he takes pleasure it takes pleasure Paul said that's the pleasure according to his good will I'm so thankful for that aren't you glad that there's somebody holding you that's greater than you amen even before we were aware of it but but how precious that is let's just go to him in prayer father we just have so much to thank you for Lord how we thank you oh God for the testimony Lord of sister a to their Lord we thank you for moving Lord Lord God as we're just Lord giving you thanks Lord as you continue to move Lord on that behalf Lord what a miracle Lord father how we thank you God for Lord every touch the Lord in every life Lord every other testimony Lord standing Lord right here tonight Lord no different ones Lord that even from Sunday Lord and the testimonies

you Lord you show Lord in situations that it's just absolutely impossible Lord with man there's no possibilities there's no way that's when Lord that you show up and it's undeniable that it's you Lord God how did you come and you make yourself known you have ways of getting Lord the attention of every one of your children Lord oh God how thankful we are for that Lord that there'll not be a one Lord that'll slip away Lord God father Lord before there has been that appointment with you Lord God how we rest in that Lord it brings a rest to our lives and our hearts Lord oh God as we pray Lord calling out for our loved ones Lord co-workers neighbors Lord different ones Lord because this song that we just sung all that Thrills my soul is Jesus Lord that's what you are in our lives what you've done for our lives Lord if you did it for us you'll do it for anyone Lord and oh God how our hearts desire that Lord that all might know this same Joy this same Liberty Lord this same thrill Lord what it means Lord to live for you to serve you to walk with you Lord be United with you almighty God may you just continue Lord to just have your way Among Us Lord I ask that you'll just guide us the Lord here tonight anoint Lord I pray my lips Lord anoint my heart oh God anoint Lord your children Lord father for lord it's it's what we have need of Lord that's what we are that's what you're interested in Lord that's what you come to minister to us and that's what we're here to receive I pray that Lord that you just help us Lord May Beyond every circumstance May there not be any barrier Lord but oh God what would be broke down and father your word might have the right of way we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] and God bless you thank you musicians amen I want to go to job 23 and I've been reading from this portion of scripture and uh here tonight I I didn't know if I would come back and touch this or not but uh uh just a little a thought and I I'm not going to try to get all the way through it here but I spoke this the Lord laid it on my heart to speak on the Sunday evening at brother Nathan Bryants and I just it was something that God began to deal with my heart on you know times when you take a scripture and you meditate on the scripture and I I personally believe that I've watched how God will come around and give answer and give direction for this and I always credit it that lord it's not me trying to figure something out but it's you that's laid that scripture on my heart and then God has a time when he'll come around and just just speak to that scripture and just you know bring forth what what it is that he wants for us and to minister to our hearts and so I just want to draw from job 23 in verse 8 and the reason I say I I'd love to be able to preach it all here tonight but I it's not like when I preach out I know I'm not pastoring I have to move get through a subject and just try to hit skip Like a Rock skipping across the the water so I that's one advantage I have as a pastor I can just it's a slow drop and drop but these are things that we would look at here I believe God's been speaking to our hearts on just even the Practical Parts in our life because I believe the word it is to live in our flesh amen it's not just when we're at church the reality is our molding in our character is what actually takes place outside of church we receive the word in our hearts right here it's changing us it's giving us strength for even the molding that's taking place through the tests and the trials that we go through so verse 8 behold I go forward but he's not there and backward but I cannot perceive him and on the left hand where he does work but I cannot Behold Him he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knows the way that I take when he had tried me I shall come forth as gold I'd like to just begin just to take a thought on this in his hands in his hands amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated brother Brown would say it like this and the message the Seal of God he says I've often said God help the day when men will be what they ought to be if I was against him I'd say I was against him it'd be again I'd be against him in everything I could be but I'm for him and I love him and I believe him and my life is in his hands to do with whatever he wants to because I believe that Christianity is the truth is that how you feel my life is in his hands to whatever he wants to do however he wants to use me whatever Avenue my life's in his hands and the message be certain of God brother REM says when you openly confess that God is the same God and your life applied in his hands to be Lord I'm the clay Thou Art the Potter then ask what you will and Faith Will Never Move it'll stand right there those circumstances will seem to fall from right and left but that faith never moves because you're certain that he's gone and of his God he keeps his promise he can't make a promise and break it if he's God he's got to keep his promise oh I love that he's got to stay with it so to think when we have openly conflict confessed and your life is applied in his hands in that of I'm the clay you're the Potter you know there's one thing for sure that a Potter and there might be you might find somebody out there on YouTube I'm not asking for any videos on it but you might find somebody that maybe is you know uh just you know in some way has only reused one hand I but I've never seen a Potter with just one hand I've seen everything the when I've studied over the years and whether I was going to minister on that of of a Potter I would sometimes I'm reading and reading just on things outside and then I'll look at certain videos that we can maybe you know you can try to tap into and I've never seen a Potter with just one hand but I've always seen it with two hands and where there are always one hand that's studying it there's another and but sometimes both hands are shaping it together then there's other times where that that Potter will put his hand down in it and he's working from the inside out and my is just a tremendous thing that both hands and I just want to say it like this we're in his hands and God has two hands job said on the left hand he worked but I can't Behold Him and on the right hand but I can't see him so job recognizes that there is a uh two parts and how that God himself will move and operate within our lives and you know I I would definitely say even here tonight that we would look at that and when we just can think just very temporarily without dwelling on it in this moment of it but we all enjoy the right hand of God and my the power and the expression the miracle the manifestation but there's also the need of the left hand as well and so God works on our lives with both hands and it's so important that right hand and left hand and we understand that God is a spirit and that these terms that even when it would say the arm of the Lord in the hand of the lord it's all figurative of God himself coming down and dealing with Humanity God revealing and making himself known to you and I think about that even in those uh terms where God would uh they use the term personification where God would even extend himself the arm of the Lord is extending his hand that God would so relate to you and I because you and I even within that have trouble relating to God but God would so come down and make himself known to you and I in those manners that I am the ever-present god and so you know we realize that even even here tonight as job would write about it that in whose hand is the soul of every living thing in the breath of all kind remember when Paul would stand there on Mars heel and he said uh here we live and breathe and have our being in him Paul was declaring that our lives that everything that is taking place there is nothing outside of the hands of God and yet not every life has been fully delivered into the hands of God think of it in this terms that even when that world war had started and then you know when uh everything was preparing to just wipe the world over but yet here they can't figure out we're coming up on it in November the 11th of Armistice Day they still do not know what is it that caused that that ceasing of fire but it was God who has it in his hands and he told the angels in the Book of Revelations hold the Four Winds until I've sealed my servants so the whole purpose is is not just the sealing of Israel but in this time the 11th our worker was to come and that 11th Hour worker is you and I who has received the same wages as the first hour the same experience that they had on the day of Pentecost the same son of man coming in his fullness and his power restored back to the Church of the Living God it's the moment of the 11th Hour worker and it's in God's hands a lot of things have went to where the world has been on its Brink and you know even when you think of coming into October and when the Cuban Missile Crisis and all these things but nothing could take place and nothing can finish it out until that last one has come in and that God himself has got all Israel in their place which I believe that they are and God will take his people in Rapture in rapturing grace before one bomb hits this the bride will be gone god holds the Reigns in his hands even as the prophet could say it like this he said you ever been in an accident and you wonder when you look back at that accident how did I walk away from there he said that's because the hand of the Lord was upon you oh my see God's mercy his our life is in his hands and so to think of it that you know within this time that what an opportunity that we have to make a choice in this hour God he doesn't make the choice for us and you might say well am I not in the choosing of God well when God's choosing what God chose and saw before the foundation of the world it only is an act that is taking place now if you are part of his choosing there you'll be part of the choosing now because you will recognize him and choose him in this hour as his influence moves across your life that's God himself he he comes to seek and save what was lost well you can't be found if you never was lost I mean you know I don't go find a you know a keys or look for keys to a you know a Cadillac I don't own a Cadillac so I didn't lose no Cadillac keys but God when he came he said Remember the son of man has come to seek and save that which was lost so God himself has come God wasn't lost we were and God came down and sought you and I out amen his presence coming by our lives think of this in John 10 27 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand oh what a promise Amen in his life where in his hands I give them eternal life and they shall never perish why because if we were able to perish I'm not talking about this outside this outside part right now this outside part it ages it's outside part gets weary it gets tired but that's not the part we're talking about we're talking about that inward part that seed of God that part of the word of God that's what God came to Quicken that's what God came to get a hold of because just as it takes there of sperm and egg father and mother that seed on the inside was the womb the bedding ground it was the womb that Christ might place his life and that his life might be expressed so you're not just a church member walking around with oh these blessings oh these blessings with out of power to live an overcoming life but when that overcoming life comes down and that seed is God's Throne his seed his Temple and when God sits there in that place his rightful place then you are rightfully pleased in Christ Jesus then you have authority then you have Victory and they're an Express through your life and that's the greatest blessing that works out to other blessings what a privilege it is to know our life is in his hands no man can pluck them out of my hand My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand God's word God's Will and we're a smack in the middle of it you say well brother Samuel I'm seeking for God's will right now now listen to me the will of God the the most Supreme will of God is that you be born again is that you be filled with the life of almighty God that is the will of God and then from that in your life that's where everything itself begins to move through that's the thinking man's filter begins to filter out it when you got decisions coming up and things are coming your way you're looking at it saying Lord what do you say about this what do you see within this why because you have a filter you have a strength there is the will of God in your life and you're looking for his will in every day living gives a real rest doesn't it it gives a rest because we don't have to we're not fighting and wrestling with that we just Lord I I'm looking to you I I may not see it it may get down to a time when you're ready to start biting fingernails but just hold on don't don't bite them just look to God God let me just say something like this I don't want to say God has habits but I'll just say there's sometimes there's a lot of patterns in things to where that you find God showing up at the last moment to us as humans we're the ones who start sweating bullets but not God God knew he had to wait for Pharaoh's Army for them horses to start they could feel the breath on them God had to wait for that moment why because he needed to destroy what was after him God knows what he's doing it seemed like all all hope was lost when you know Naomi would say you you both of you uh Ruth and orpha going back to your your your your your your your Homeland going back but you see if they had went on back who would have brought Naomi back to her estate you say well Beau has had it but it had to come back it had to pass through that of a gentile bride to come back to her that same truth remember it was what Ruth received the seed of Boaz and through that life that came back then when it's handed back to the Jews to Naomi Naomi became a wet nurse what is it it will be an infant truth that he died from my sins that he became me he God came down he is the messiah oh mine through that infant truth it'll revolutionize their life hasn't it it hasn't revolutionized our life oh my they covered the grace of God so we look at this and I want to just say in his hands you know whatever little that we could have or whatever little that you think when you put it in his hands God can do something with it but when you put it in his hands you know it'd be like if you ever had people where they give you something then they want to tell you how to do it right now don't look around don't look around don't look next door I don't want you know they tell you you can use it but they're going to tell you in your mouth say well go ahead and I'll drink the sweet tea while you do it and then you can but we all know that right but you see with God putting it in his hands I want you to think like this that here when Jesus in Matthew 14 there was a little boy the prophet said was truant from school I guess this was the only time it'd be all right to be truant from school you know it's like when when our boys have to go for it maybe when Zachary had to go for a doctor's appointments everyone goes oh you're out of school early I don't know he's homeschooled he's just taking a break to come here right now but this little boy was truant and when he showed up they met there was a need that came up little did he know that that little lunch that he packed that day was going to become a miracle in the hands of the Messiah many times we left out of the day we don't think don't think prayed and and and all of that is important we prayed we we've looked we've had a devotion we've looked to the Lord and said Lord just guide me today Lord bless me today guide my footsteps today how little do we know that it's a moment and a day where our lives being placed in his hand and a situation that looks so Bleak but then when in his hands then it is multiplied this is where Jesus and I think this is important in verse 17 of Matthew 14 it says we have here but Five Loaves and two fishes he said bring them hither to me as long as you keep it you can't do nothing with it you know it's like trying to say you're trying to teach somebody how to write and they want to hold the pencil let me see it I said no no I'm gonna do it no you got to put it in his hands you got to put it in his hands sometimes that's the really and no matter how old we are sometimes that's what we struggle with is putting things in his hands because we want to we will have requests that we make known to God and then we want to tell God how to be God oh Lord help us Jesus notice this he commanded the five to sit down in verse 19 on the grass and he took the Five Loaves and the two fishes looking up the heaven he blessed break it gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude and they did eat and were filled and they took up the fragments that remained 12 baskets full and they had eaten were about five thousand men beside women and children so it's beyond five thousand but it just shows you I want you to notice it wasn't just enough it was more than enough he's God's Not Just Enough he's more than enough he's not just enough for your situation he's my more than enough this happened twice in the gospel it happened in Elijah's day the same God it happened when they were building the Temple and the people were to bring offerings and the finally they had to stand up and say tell the people Moses don't bring no more offerings we've got more than enough I'm not saying that here but I'm saying this it's more than enough is that all right notice it wasn't very much in that little Lads that little I could pack that thing around maybe a brown paper bag you know if you were like we were like most of us when we went to school or you were one of the cool kids that had one of those tins that could be dented with the Therma Senate you know that could hold about a shot of Kool-Aid in it you know but you know it wasn't very much in his hands it was it was just enough to take care of him but when it got when it was put into the Master's hands giving him to God's hands when it was given to his hands you might say brother Samuel I'm in his hands but if you'll give whatever situation whatever need it is give it into his hands and say lord it's just as little right here tonight I can't see a way out but put it in his hands oh brother random setting and the message it is on 1960 how God can multiply what we put in his hands in our hands it's not much in his hands he multiplies it by the thousands if we could only let him have what little we have our time our Attention our faith may not be too much but I say God let me just put my little time my little attention whatever it is whatever you say it's just a little bit put it in his hands [Music] huh but Brian says it like this I want you to think of this this to me is just a powerful quote Billy Graham said that little faith in the message preparation that little faith You've Got Tonight just enough to get you out to the church turn it loose put it in his hands and say Lord I don't care if they call me Holy Roller backwash whatever they want to I'm accepting the baptism of the Holy Ghost right now God Kindle fire in my heart let me come forth watch what it'll be in an hour from now you'll be going down the street singing I got the old-time religion notice how simple it is it's Satan that wants to complicate it but you see what it is is coming in tune and energizing that little faith that you had to even come to the house of God tonight if you just can put that into his hands how do I do that his word as he's revealing himself he's revealing his hands to you he's making himself known and if you just put it in his hands and say Lord I accept the baptism of the Holy Ghost I accept whatever your need is I accept that Lord God and he says watch what it'll be an hour from now when these five fishes and two loaves got put in Jesus hands he didn't have to tell them give me a month to Sunday so I can create a hatchery I need to develop a fish hatchery here I need you also to give me a couple Fields so I can plant some seed we can Harvest that seed we can beat that out and get that gluten whatever it is out of there and begin to make some bread he did not need that you see he bypassed everything else that you and I would know let me just say this God when God moves God will bypass all of our human reasoning God doesn't need our help as far as us telling him what to do he just needs us to take whatever it is and put it in his hands and say you know what I'm too small to carry this so I'm gonna put it in my Big Brother's hands on you cause you care for me these burns are too big for me I can't bear them but Lord God you said that if I would place them in your hands you would bear me up thank you Jesus in the message if God be with us wears all his miracles remember how Gideon when Gideon himself he had to act on the word he put the broth he put the uh the offering all on the Rock and hear the angel of the Lord veiled there uh you know in that of of of a human vessel he touched it with the rod and it went up and then you know of how that God led him along with the the you know the Sheep the skin of the sheep and on one time it was the dew on there and the next time Gideon said all right let that be dry and let do fall around it let me just say this to you right now I do not look down on Gideon whatsoever you can that's why we cannot compare one another's experiences we cannot I can't compare my experience to you you can't compare your experience to me because look at David you never find David going the Month of Sundays before David finally got convinced but you find Gideon where God is dealing with Gideon God's dealing with Gideon but you know what it didn't bother God whatsoever God as a matter of fact said let me tell you something son you need to get down there and hear this dream and if you're afraid to go take your armor Bearer with you because I need you to hear what's being said you know what God was interested God was not going to shame Didion because that would have never encouraged Gideon shaming us will never encourage us how does God encourage you and I encourages Us by his word by making himself known he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me that's why I'm glad I don't got to pull him into him push me into him just lift him up Hallelujah now watch this act upon his word remember I'd be ashamed if I had to put the fleece down and then I turned around out why it's you and God personal let me tell you God ain't hitting and missing even in the service but if you just will just take the attention that he himself has so dedicated to your life that he would direct and studying and giving lame these things not only upon my heart but the way the inspiration would travel in this service if God is so mindful of you I say it's time to just reach out and take a hold of him like touching the Hem of His Garment and say if it means for me to lay the fleece down here and do to fall on it and then tomorrow I'll take the fleece up and say it let it be dry and let everything else around it be filled with do why that's between you and God you got to do something about it you have to act on the word of God notice what brother Ram says act upon his word and you'll see a real Miracle something will take place when you act upon his word like Gideon did he did what he told him to do like Noah did he did what he told him to do like Moses did he did what he told him to do now remember before they did it there was no Miracle right that's why the Bible said in Hebrews chapter 6 you have need of patience after you have done the will of God that you might receive the promise I've done the will of God well don't get impatient if you've done the will of God just wait for the fire to fall is that all right he said throw down your stick now watch out watch how brother Graham takes this with Moses he said throw down your stick in other words get rid of everything's around you and let me have it you say I got an awful temper give it to God he knows how to quieten it you mean there ain't a book in the bookstore no just this is very simple you don't have to spend no more money on Amazon you don't have to get another Kindle book on how to be uh you know a happy mad guy you don't have to get another book on how to be that the happiest Grump in town you don't have to do that I got an awful temper you see what it is just being honest with God lord I've got this and I I need help give it to God he knows how to quieten it I got a lot of lust he knows how to take it away just put it in his hands and watch what a miracle can do glory be to God how many want a clear future I do a clear future remember how brother Brandon when he had that parasite when he came back from Africa mandatorre him up you know with six months tore him up but then finally was wanting to know at that part when things were coming down into that and he was still dealing with still suffering from it had different effects from it and it was just something on his heart he wanted to know Lord what is my future he just pondering meditating on that and here the presence of the Lord came down like that of a typewriter and typed out a note where brother Graham could see it by vision and on that typewriter it was typed out your future is clear and the Hand reached down and took that that that out of that typewriter that was their Envision and just flung it out there and said your future is clear so not only did God write it God announced it and that's the same God that announces it for you and I [Applause] am I mean we're not meditating on other people's problems we have other burdens on our hearts for our brothers and sisters is that right but there's needs there's things that we have on our heart things that maybe we've got questions or things we're praying about things within the scripture and let me just tell you something God is mindful when you begin to think on him God himself will answer according to his word I want my future to be clear notice in Psalms 31 15 I love this scripture my times are in his or in thy hand don't you love that Lord have mercy if we can just put that all in right there it takes all the anxiousness out if David if David who did not have been the privilege of having the experience of the rest in our soul and David can have this kind of a testimony under the law where the Holy Spirit would come and remove and come and move and he could have that kind of a confidence my times are in thy hand so in other words the timeline everybody I remember remember that from school timelines right probably sister Anita still has to walk him through that I used to hate making timelines you know why I never could get them right I'd have this big old wide open thing at the at the beginning I've never I never get it spaced out right you know I really had to watch that when I was teaching tried to use you know a computerized things but because everything would be so so you know not not spread out exactly but notice God knows every little Junction every little thing along the way you might sit brother Samuel I'm afraid I'll miss this you can't miss it when you're seeking after him when you put God first how can you miss a Divine appointment in his word it's impossible that's why David could say in Psalms 1 1 19 that how a young man would cleanse his way now think of this our future you know I don't know what the future holds there's a lot of things that happen in the past years we did not expect certain things happening like it did I don't know what the future holds and I'll just be honest with you I don't sit around trying to put a prediction on it I know what judgment is looming I know where we're living in the end time we see things around us but you know what my objective is not to be caught up in predicting it I know it's here but I've been given a direction when you begin to see all these things lift up your head cause your redemption's drawing now is that right so God I don't know what the future holds but I know who holds the future I'll tell you I can't tell you how many times when there's been things that come along that come along my way even from teaching and everything else even before I got out of teaching college and you know you got to have a certain grade point average to get into the teacher School the last last part of it and man I'll tell you there's thoughts can come and worry you to death and you know a little if you let them thoughts linger man I'll tell you fear can grip a hold of you anybody with me tonight I mean you let certain things linger and you start pondering well what if this and what if that and what if this and what if that and what if this and pretty soon you're so much down the what if and what if Trail you're like where was that Crossroad where where did I leave the main road in my mind come on now friends I'm talking real life now there's things that come around we start trying to look at and we start trying to figure it out and we're trying to look for ways and trying to look for those things but you know when it comes back when we can come back to that place and say God you who got a hold of me and I'm in your hands Lord I need you to take a hold of my mind right now I know that my mind is given for me that I'm to rule over my spirit but Lord I really need some help right now there's some strength right now Lord when this anxiousness has wanted to rise up I'm not I'm not big to call on Jesus I need his savings strength because the Bible said he is the saving strength of his anointed amen amen hallelujah oh glory be to God oh brother Samuel I don't ever get down oh you're not being truthful brother Branham who stood there himself in perfect faith and then he comes back around and works made Faith expressed and he tells the people in perfect Faith he said I'd get gloomy times too right I get gloomy times too but he said here's what I do when I get them gloomy times I reach over and start reading Romans 4. he said that's what every time I do when I start feeling blue so don't go to New Orleans just just pick up Romans 4. you don't need to be singing the blues you need to be something that'll actually lift you amen lift you out of there right amen amen so notice in the message Shalom brother said do as David did put your future into his hands oh my you know I often said this like with the young people and things like that and mentioned in different places I said can you imagine how that when Samuel went down there to the house to anoint David to be king you know David if you understand it David was the young youngest of the of the family so he didn't have a younger brother that he could practice being a leader on so nobody thought to bring him in but God knew what lay in there because God needed somebody that he could lead and so when David you know Saul said Saul opened up the flask he said surely to the Lord my mate is here he opened up the flask and went to pour it on the first one said this got to be the one nope God said to the second one got to be the one nope gotta be no no no no no finally Samuel just sat down go get him he said you got another one you haven't done the fifth Samuel sat down and said go get him because we ain't going no further until you bring him what are you saying I'm saying don't accept nothing less than the will of God 's revealed something to you don't accept anything less than the will of God let me tell you something as a young person a young lady a young man you don't have to settle for anything less than a real experience you don't have to settle for anything less than a real man of God a real daughter of God you don't have to settle for anything less than the will of God truth well that was free David do like David put your future in his hands what is he he is revealed to me he is the revealed truth and my time is in his hands my time belongs to him I am his I am in his hand because he holds the time I don't know what the future holds but I know who holds the future so he who holds the future holds me why why should I think about setting forth this and that and the other other for the new year how many times we we know everybody first part of the year you want some good exercise equipment just wait till everything's broken I'm not talking about the equipment because it may not even be out of the box it may not have been used just wait till the Midway went to the garage sale in the summer then you could pick up some good equipment everybody make the New Year's resolutions no more Debbie cakes no more this oh man you say brother Samuel with that that that's kind of silly well listen I hear brother Brandon pray for a sister in the adoption part one and he asked God to help her to be able to lose weight so how you know what I've had to pray that many times we got quiet in here tonight he got quite I'm not saying that to be funny I transition to me when I hear things I'm listening to that that God cares about everything that sometimes the things that you might look at it may not be the well I need to really get down to size this and so it may not be that it might just be for the health part of it that in your life you might be in more control to surrender more to the Lord but God cares about those things so how do you know I've proved him and I know it so why should I think about setting forth this that and the other so I hope I didn't make nobody feel bad about your New Year's resolutions everybody today gonna go home tonight get that treadmill out honey get that elliptical out honey get that out make sure you're requesting it for yourself and not for your honey and we're praying for a different way for you I just put myself in his hands and walk like David did you realize that's what we have to do isn't that right brother Dave sometimes we can talk about putting situations in his hands but really the main thing that we need to put in his hands is the situation the need but we need to put ourselves because it's us that does the worry it's us that does the fretting it's us that does but but but what if this or or looking at it like this but if we can just put our self in his hands God knows our situations I just put myself in his hands and I walked like David did my time is in his hands knew that God held his future David didn't know what the future was but he know God had the future and I don't know what the future is none of us do but we know who holds the future listen David knew he had been anointed to be king he knew that that was a secret coming in his life he knew that the presence of God had moved down in his life and David knew that and he knew he's been anointed to be king and there's nothing going to take him away until that's been manifested let me tell you something you've been anointed for rapture you've been anointed you might say well what if I go before before the rest let me tell you you've been anointed blessed are they who die in the Lord they shall be of whom the second Death Shall Have No Power Over blessed are they who have part in the first resurrection what a blessing it is to be in Jesus Christ let me tell you something whether I go in Rapture or whether I go before it's just a blessing serving the lord and a joy to know him so what are you saying I'm saying I've not been defeat or Anointed with the spirit of fear of defeat or maybe but they're the spirit of God has anointed our lives with the certainty I can't lose I can't lose listen are you saying you haven't made no mistakes that's not what I'm saying I'm saying I can't lose because the most important battle has already been won and I have received a Divine impartation of that battle the victory has been released when he ascended up on high he gave out gifts what was those gifts he was imparting it was that part of himself as a Victor is coming on a Victorious parade we have received his life as it's been dispersed so God is a spirit and when we consider that these terms his hands it's God's dealing with us as Humanity his children in the Fulfillment of his word think of it this way in the message of personal experience with God brother Brahm says he has no hands but ours now when he walked on the shores of Galilee God came down created a body and God manifested himself through that body and what God did through Christ was displaying what God intended for every son and daughter of God to be a full-fledged child of God free from the world to be able to walk in a world of perfect faith remember like brother Daryl was reading from perfect Faith the last time how perfect Faith Masters every circumstance to me those quotes never get old they never get old it was just to me it's just inspiring how how the Lord was just bringing it last week and because how many times we've looked at things on the how and we don't know the how you're looking at a situation you think how right but perfect Faith does what it Masters the how it's not that how can come into a mountain but there is a Mastery over it puts it back in place my life's in his hands God's got this under control amen amen just like when that the situation when brother Brian senior came and knocked on the office last week and came in and the situation and you see and you hear of where things are at and I tell you the thing the burden that was so upon my heart was not just for her healing but the most important thing was I said God make a way that they can there could be that rest to where that soul can have that opportunity and so that's even on Friday night I was praying throughout the the time and then on Friday I had the young people we were praying together praying for that need before we started the Bible study ah to God be the glory amen oh my that there that God how everything just converts I don't have time to go through it it's a wonderful testimony but God has a way of lining everything up you know and so I just say it in this way he's here in spirit form no eyes but ours no ears but ours no tongue but ours so let's let him have everything The Secret of this is submitting yourself with Godly love into the hands of a loving father and letting him take you over Lord there's a situation on my job to submit yourself into his hands and let him take you over remember when brother Daryl came out and he gave the example and I've you know we it's one of those things I enjoy enjoy not just enjoy quoting it but you see the reality of it with a man he was trying to cast That cast that what he it was a spirit upon his wife that you know would start razzing him about going to a Pentecostal meeting and when you know he talked about what he was trying to do get her out in the middle of the floor and trying to cast the devil off of her and brother Brahm just told the brother his brother you're going about it all the wrong way brother Graham didn't say it won the spirit right right see he didn't say it on the spirit he just said you're going about it the wrong way why because look at the results look at the results was there a need there was a need but there is but The Way It Was going about it it would seem like that was the way never forget when you know you you hear um uh T Osborne give the testimony when brother Brown when the maniac came to the uh the platform and then we're all different you know I've prayed with a lot of brothers some brothers you know like I had one brother stood behind me in a prayer line he apologized to me so I'm sorry he said I beat you in the Back Eyes okay it's all right victories being won you know everybody's I mean everything's different you know you just you're going home but here's brother Brown I'm standing right here and T Osborne we're looking at this when this Maniac came up and they and and and here when when the Holy Spirit accepts that challenge and you know the story of where it goes down across the prophet's feet and then the liberty that comes in that building because the chief of that tribe of demon Saul that it's where the demons saw their Chief had been defeated not the physical man but the chief was in there right and they saw it been defeated and immediately when that they fled and when they fled notice brother Brown never had to come up and say you get off the cot you get out of the wheelchair you no what happened is when they saw that defeated then the rest of those demons scattered because see even in ranks there's rankings they knew they were defeated and the people just begin to get off the and everything else a different this is me and not just I don't just look at them as testimonies I look out on the house has God's desire to work through our lives then maybe you and I would look at it oh I gotta get this one off the car I gotta get this one out of the wheelchair I gotta get this no that didn't have to happen it's break that Spirit first and then I let God have his way brother Brown told that man he said go get it the next time get her a box of chocolates now I don't believe that you know was some special chocolates there's a lot can go through my mind right now some chocolates Lord help me I don't believe it was some special formula ingredient you say what was it it was the expression of love care that's what defeated the enemy let me tell you something you want to know what a defeat to hear me in your family in your home and on the job and everything else what will that be the expression of love and I would not be too big to ask God lord teach me how to love the right way help me Lord to see that in the right way because you know maybe someone didn't have that example but God ain't too big that he won't stoot down and teach you and I and say here let me put my hands on your life to show you I'm glad about that aren't you I'm glad he ain't too big brother Rocco I'm glad that God don't look down and say that's juvenile that's kindergarten I'm glad that God comes down he's still concerned about the ABCs I'm glad he's he's not too big that he'll come now and begin to take things or we can look at and say Lord I thought I had this figured out but I realized that I ain't even close Abraham says when God in the message greatest Valor fought when God can get a man in his hands so he can get his senses conscience everything cleaned out until it stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a devil in the world can poke a doubt in there that's right he can come around and say you don't feel any better but what's behind there Faith a life that is in God's hands and I'll tell you God's hands are active God operates with his hands God molds us God shapes us God upholds us with his hands oh don't you love him tonight oh my think of that in job 23 and let me just close here we'll just stop here tonight Lord willing that we'll start picking up those hands but notice job said here and what our text was verse 9 on the left hand where he does work but I can't Behold Him I cannot proceed what's taking place he hideth himself on the right hand I'm not seeing any manifestation that I cannot see him but nonetheless I'm in his hands came back I may not know what's going on I may not even understand it I'm just reading just going over some more of the quotes you remember how we've read that about with the stats Cliff when the angel of the Lord told Brother Brown Don't Go Over There that's the hand of the Lord you know how it is sometimes you read across a quote here this evening just just looking at some things and remember when that was told don't go there don't rebuke it it's the hand of the Lord and brother Brown goes on to tell on tape in different places if you just look up hand to the Lord he begins to talk about what he speaks to the stancilar family he said look he says you don't know what would have laid down later in life but the brand even talks about that for his own children little Sharon when she was taking what what what what might have come later down in life for her maybe a road that she would have crossed in it but if God knows what's best a lot of things don't make sense to us and brother Brahm says it like this if I can remember the exact words Ram says like this when the angel of the Lord told him that don't touch it it's the hand of the Lord but remember say oh this is going to go over real good think about you have to tell the mother where the doctor has let that baby stay there for two days and you have to be the one to call and say it's the hand of the Lord I'm not to come there I don't just look at the one to have to be there to stand and tell it to me and when I think of that right now it causes my toes to curl up and I don't just say that it's true but I think about on the other end of receiving that to be able to receive that that's right and this is where the member sister stats Cliff asked the question and she was so troubled I must not have had faith for the Branham if I'd have had faith God would have raised her up raised up my baby I love I'm so glad this was put in the message amen I'm glad this was put on tape but he told sister staff with no you've got great faith because even when God decided to take your baby you've stood Hallelujah why I'm in his hands I don't know when I can't hold myself he's holding me because sometimes I feel I feel in control I feel pretty good but I've realized I'll just tell you I've realized that's the most dangerous time for Samuel Browning when I feel like that I'm I'm in control you might feel like you're on a Mountaintop but that's the time I need a most because it's no Marvel I need him when I'm down in the valley but it's the part about when I feel that I'm up here that's when I really need him most that's when I'm the most vulnerable aren't you glad your life is in his hands [Applause] amen hallelujah musicians come amen Benjamin if you could play that song my life is in his hands amen just thinking of that song I'll tell you tonight if your life's not in His Hands it'd be a good time to put it in his hands it'd be a real good time it just remember whatever little you have don't let the devil shame you because of your little faith or little this or little that let me tell you something there's a God here that can take little things and turn them into big things Matthew remember when we were out there last week out there Gathering little Twigs on fire remember that we had that little fire the fire going in our fire pit Matthew and Zachary came out there and helped me handed some things off to Matthew pulling out little little you know when you do trimmings around your house and stuff like that you put a little I put a little pile so I can get it little twigs and stuff grab the hold of that man I told Matthew I said you know I a big piece of wood in there they ain't catch a fire and they're not about to catch one but you know what you know what a fire starts with he starts with little things and I told him on the way back up there I said now that'll preach it just takes Little Things brother Brown says you want a Revival he said you'll be the Revival you let Revival start in Europe you want to see change well I want to see changing my own let it start in you whatever little it is put it in God's hands don't be ashamed let me tell you something that's what Satan would want to do he wants to try to shame you it is in God who makes you feel ashamed it's Satan that wants to try to make you feel ashamed brother Samuel what can I do the greatest honor to take him at his word and say Lord this is so small and I put it in your hands tonight and make that decoration if you don't if you're not giving your life to God give it to the Lord tonight put it in your sins Lord I need the Holy Ghost I need more than just a Justified life to where I'd accept you as a savior but all kinds of habits in my life I need Lord a real cleansing a real Deliverance Lord I Need the Holy Ghost don't struggle with it he said if you ask the father he said if a son goes to a father and says give me a piece of bread he said the father won't turn around to that son and give him a stone look at that and if we in the natural know how to give good gifts how much more the heavenly father when we ask him and that's where Jesus said if you ask him for the Holy Ghost you don't have to beg him you don't have to plead just asking say Lord I'm ready to accept the Holy Ghost and just let him move down in your life that's the testimony and watch where your life will be watch what'll take place maybe you've got a need here tonight something that's before you maybe it's on the job maybe it's in your home right now it's before you it's in the Forefront of your mind why don't you put it in your sins say God I I've tried this all this A Million Ways of Sunday I can't do it keeping me up at night I'm wrestling with Lord I I I I feel like sometimes maybe the fears and cold sweat but I just put it in your hands tonight Lord and how you gonna put it in your sand I'm gonna put everything that I am in here saying my mind my spirit my all put it in his
