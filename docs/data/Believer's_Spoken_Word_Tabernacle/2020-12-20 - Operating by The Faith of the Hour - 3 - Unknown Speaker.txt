you and amen your your faces part of them and uh you you know you have to do accordingly I know sometimes those things get a little bit annoying and things like that so I don't want nobody passing out in here but um I than you we we know what to do and we just you know the thing is we're just thankful that God would permit us to come back together amen we have faith in only one thing and that's in him that's where our faith and our trust lies it's it's just that's it right there it wouldn't matter how it would not matter how effective or how good of no matter you know if you were sick and medicine and we appreciate that you wouldn't want the doctor to give you sugar pills but you know when it all comes down to it it it it isn't our faith is not resting in that our faith is resting solemnly and completely in the Lord Jesus Christ amen and you know it's just like God he spoke it over and over in his word and we you remember back in the first part of this year we were we were ministering for some Thursday nights and never got all the way finished with it but on healing and how that at the Waters of Mara he was right there and I I there's one scripture that I love it it it follow follow through the whole whole Cannon of scripture but God said in Exodus 23 when he brought them out he said I will bless your bread and your water and I will take sickness from among you he never said it wouldn't come he never said we wouldn't get sick he never said that so where is our faith our faith is in what he said I'll take it away I'll take it away s how will we deal if this comes about or this comes about in our life he said he will take it away healing itself is already it's a finished work and that's where our trust is at it's completely in the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm so glad about that aren't you I mean it it just gives us a real rest and a real trust and and a real peace in the midst of that amen God bless you I want to make mention we won't have service here this Thursday um so you just do accordingly and uh sure many some of you may be traveling in in other places but um let's just let's look to the Lord today what God would have to say to us this morning amen I I need your prayers this morning as as every time that God would help me to get out of the way because that's what that's what we need we need him we need him to come that I can get out of the way you can get out of the way that that he can have that Jesus could have a good time and that's that's our desire God help us help us to be able to get out of the way could we pray together Heavenly Father dear Lord Jesus how we love you Lord we appreciate your goodness and your mercy appreciate God the faithfulness Lord and how that God you just so Minister your word Lord to our hearts with such Assurance father we've come here Lord de God as the people have come together Lord we love seeing one another this is our brothers and sisters Lord we are love like Precious faith and we love to see one another it's something in our heart oh God that just longs to see one another but dear Lord our purpose of coming here is we want to see you we need to see you Lord dear God I'm asking that you would help us Lord together because it's it doesn't rest it doesn't rest in me I I want to yield I want to get myself out of the way I need help Lord father the people they need help there's needs upon their heart there's lives that need to be changed doubts that need to be dissolved Lord we can't do this without you coming so Lord we as the songs have went forth of Zion in our hearts Lord we just want to make you welcome here this morning may you help us Lord to take every care every bird Upon Our Hearts and place them oh God before you this morning and may we trust you give it to your hands that you'd make yourself so real Among Us this morning come and heal those that are sick Lord God May the angel of the Lord just move down oh God and Father drive away oh God sickness Lord Drive Away depression Drive Away anxiety Drive Away oppression drive away oh God every hold oh God we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God Amen let's look in the word of the Lord this morning thank you musicians amen James chapter 2 I want to go back there we could this morning and I'm just going to read just go in begin at verse 20 here this morning James writing by the spirit of God wilt thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead now evidently there were individuals even potentially Believers or those who were there that they believed I mean they were gathered with the church but see the the goodness and the grace of God the love of God would reach down and help them to see that Faith itself that has no works is dead and so he's speaking of O vain vain means empty so there is that that God would be encouraging them to that's something greater than what they would have we understand intellectual Faith as far as human Faith there's a beginning right there and in order for that to even be stirred up even in our hearts in going in the right direction it takes God coming down and stirring that up and drawing us to that PL oh vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar seest how thou how Faith wrought with his work and by works was Faith made perfect now James is not writing about works of the law Paul separated that out that is not what James is speaking as though that a person is trying to make themselves pleasing or to perfects but he's speaking of The Works which is the work that is done by the faith of God operating in the light so notice the scripture seest thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Faith made perfect so what a union and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the the friend of God you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way remember she never met Joshua but she received those who carried the word from Joshua glory be to God and sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead Also may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated brother Brandon would say it like this some of these quotes I I don't have in there because I've just got so much in front of me here he would speak and admonish to the believer I want you to get built up in the whole these holy Oracles of God the oracles is that which is spoken by God it's no this word that God has sent to you and I this is not the thoughts of a man it's the word of God God has spoken it's the holy Oracles of almighty God and when God speaks there are lives that are to be moved by that word and come into expression you see it clear back from Genesis 1 the word was spoken and then you see the word come to pass the manifestation itself let there be light light came forth that was the interpretation manifesting what was spoken it was God manifesting his word so God just doesn't speak his word and then leave the God who speaks his word is present to fulfill it so it's the holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing Faith to be taken out so he says we want you to believe in all that you have seen heard the word being preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done notice he's taking all of this together all of this has been working for one purpose that faith that Faith might come Faith might be built it's God who's doing it me just say it like this brother Brandon would say it clearly in um uh false anointing was at the end time he said it wasn't me that appeared down there on the river he said I'm not the one who does these things I just happened to be standing there when he came and did it how many can say the same thing about your life it isn't what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to so he says we want you to accumulate all this together in your heart now in John 6 verse 28 Jesus here is expressing here to them them when they saw Miracles taking place and he says they said to him what shall we do that we might work the works of God now I want you to just catch this here they're asking this question now what they've seen they've seen miracles in this in this particular passage they have witnessed the loaves of bread being multiplied they've witnessed the phenomenon the Supernatural and they came to seek after him but Jesus tells them you're not coming after me because you saw the Miracles it's because you ate and were full it it you know when you look at this it almost is so much for your mind to think how could they not be taken more with the miraculous than the bread they were more taken with the bread than they were the miraculous that was only to let them know and identify who is the one who is present who can do these things but God but they're asking even when Jesus would say labor not for meat that perisheth but labor for that that meat that which God gives labor for that which that of the son of man giveth for him hath God the Father sealed the father has sealed him and his put the witness the stamp his Vindication that this meat is the meat that you need to receive what shall we do that we might work the works of God they're not all they're thinking about is is these things happening Miracles taking place or I can do this that this can be done and I it was this this question had nothing to do with the purpose of God but Jesus taking this this question because in their heart remember the the word of God discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart God's word comes into heart that having the right motive and right objective and let me just say this to you this is the mercy of God you or I if not for him coming and moving upon our midst we wouldn't have the right motive or right objective but he has come and that same God who veils himself in the pillar of fire he has come to change our objectives he he came to change and and move around in our life than even Ambitions that you and I had in life those Ambitions he begins to remove that from being the priority of our life to where now it's him coming into be the Center focus of our life that's him doing that so what shall we do that we might work the works of God and Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he has sent they're wanting to know what do we do to work the works and he says this is the work of God alight what is the work of God that you would believe on him whom he hath sent now brother Brown will pick this up and he'll speak about the works of God and he says he'll say it like this he says now the works of God has many phases to it he says as for example he said even he said in building a church he said that would be be a work of God evangelism that would be a work of God healing that's a work of God above all the salvation of souls that's a work of God and he's here he is he's elaborating these are all works of God healing and many many different things gifts of the Spirit they're all different Outlets or phases as brother bam called it but you see now when we come into this here it's not just of of of the phases but now brother Bram hones into it and he says now let's look he said at what the prophet spoke that there should be light in the evening time what is light the Bible says God is light God spoke in the beginning and he says let there be light his word became the very source of of energizing and bringing forth life God is light they that were in darkness you know the scripture they were in darkness Isaiah prophesied of it and here it is fulfilled in the ministry of the Lord Jesus and it's going on yet today they who were in darkness saw a great light spring up among them what light is this this is a light that comes as it did in Genesis 1 to bring seeds to life push back the waters it is the same light of the Gospel that comes to bring forth for those seeds that he already planted in this Earth so he brings it to a place to we must identify the hour and the Fulfillment of the scripture he says we've had enough light for people to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior notice enough like two believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior we've had enough enough light to turn out great Ministries he said we've had enough light to do charitable work but yet notice he's identifying this here in 1959 but yet he says we've not had or seen the light like like it was at the beginning speaking of when it fell on the day of Pentecost until just recently this is the promise there shall be light in the evening time we are at the end of civilization we're at the end you see God in his Mercy is announcing this in his word this is the evening time not maybe not perhaps this is the evening time we have arrived oh my so that same light as he would go on to say that same light that same holy spirit that moved there in the same characteristics in that first church this same gospel is come now in the fullness of the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ we're living in the setting of the Sun and he ties this together and I want you to catch this here because we are living in a time when we've been down Through the Ages this is why uh John under the inspiration would say beloved try every spirit and see whether it be of God or not this is why Jesus could say in Matthew 24 that there would be many false Christ not false Jesus false anointed ones because here the miracles of god being done and yet it's an unclean vessel a life that is not being lived by the word is that right the what are they doing it by it's not the men doing that it is there that anointing that is upon them but notice the the Miracles are done but yet it is not a life that corresponds with the word in other words the love of the world is still in them I'm just going to preach you might say well they don't drink or they don't smoke let me just tell you something Deus forsook Paul and he did not go out into nightclubs but Deus having loved this present World why because the love of the father was not in him Hallelujah so the here we've seen so many different you see Minds Hey listen if I can say this like this and you understand right here among the bride is not the only place where Miracles are happening I mean there's there's different testimonies and different reports okay but here's the thing here's what's different what separates from everything else is the sign of the Messiah the sign of the Messiah is that word in a man now that word is in a body of Believers watch time brother Brandon places this he said we're standing here in this Messiah sign remember this is what he prophesied in Luke 17 was that as it was in the days of Noah taking us clear back to the tent door of Abraham it's a messiah sign here was a man standing before the tent door and this man showed up and Abraham wrecked recognized that this is God this is the one I've talked to and that same God that's spoke to him by word now stood before his tent door he fed him a calf fed him bread and milk and that same one was standing right there and called them by the name that he had revealed in Genesis 17 Abraham where is thy wife Sarah he never even regarded Hagar as a wife see it's passed he's not looking upon the churches it's time for the bride it's time for the wife are you with me you see I just let me just say and point this very clearly because when he says this here it's a messiah sign now listen just he says Healing The Sick wasn't exactly the sign of the Messiah anyone knows that Healing The Sick is not the sign of the Messiah for the prophets healed the sick years before the Messiah come is that right many places in the scripture but he says and in the last days Healing The Sick in this great Revival of Divine Healing is not one of the outstanding signs of the coming of Jesus notice it's not one of the outstanding signs of the coming of Jesus yet many ran and run after it you understand what I'm saying it is it is a signification it is a sign that the Living God is there but notice notice it goes on to say for we've had Divine Healing through the 2,000 years since the going away of the Messiah at Pentecost or Jerusalem and the returning of him again but there was a sign and that was the sign of the Messiah and the closing of the age and he goes on to say now he came he's he's bringing this down he came to his own his own received him not so he went to the Gentiles you see Jesus will come to those who's looking for him those who BL would say wanting to be saved he'll save them those who desire healing he heals them he makes this statement he never pushes himself you have to do that you're on the basis of a free moral agency now back into the scripture of John 6 what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus answered and said unto him him this is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he has sent let me just pause I just feel this being pressed on my heart what we just read in right here with the Messiah sign by no way by no means does that do away with healing of the sick you should be balanced in that by now he still heals the sick we still rejoice in that but what is being announced is is that was not an outstanding sign of the coming of the Lord Jesus it's been done for 2,000 years yet the sign of the Messiah to be able to discern that thought which is in the heart to see that God and let me just say this to you right now there's not been for 2,000 years one ministry that's paralleled to the Lord Jesus Christ as the ministry of William brandham not parallel brother brandom said it in the message token he said he had more success and he said notice said he had more success in my Earthly Ministry than his [Applause] own hallelujah amen healing is the children's bread but the sign of theiah to recognize who is this Among Us who is this that knows my name who is this who knows about me it's as though they're telling the story of my life that I never knew but yet it's fitting my life perfectly who is this this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent brother Bram would say it like this the Son of God himself he said believe me for the very work sake he put an emphasis on his own Works while here on Earth The Works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him the works of God were ordained to inspire faith in him Nicodemus comes to Jesus we know that thou art a great man thou art a man come from God for no man can do such things Miracles except God be with him well we could preach on that one that's Joshua 1 I'll be with you that's what God told Moses I'll be with you is that right God's promise of being with that in itself even what can you the say even the things that was coming out of their mouth was also going to stand in judgment against them they knew this was of God is that right his own Works testified who he was notice Jesus could say in in John 10:37 if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do though you believe me not believe the works that you may know and believe that the the father is in me and I in him John 14:9 Jesus said have I been so long with you yet thou Hast not known me Phillip he that hath seen me has seen the father how sayest then show us the father oh my show us the father he said believest thou not that I in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I'm in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake he that believeth on me here we come the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father you see here we are in a time and notice brother Rand would picked this up and he talks about what is taking place there and what has been in the ministry here in works of Faith expressed he says now that don't heal you talking about the vision that just identified that's the works that identifies the faith of the presence of God his word made manifest so the faith of the presence of God is his word made manifest it identifies his workings identify the faith of the presence of God his word made manifest so God's desire remember you or I cannot fulfill this word even when the Bible says Abraham believed God but the opening part of that scripture in James says that it might be fulfilled God when he speaks a word it's not just good enough that we say well I believe that word brother B says you can actually entertain it and you're looking at it and says my that's good makes sense yeah you know it just seems right he said but yet you will never identify yourself with it but you see there's something about it to the believer that goes beyond our ability to even comprehend it's something that begins to move in our life what is it it's the faith of God that is present that is actually moving upon what God has already sown in our life it's to make you I or to get our attention listen theology will never do it it'll never do it intellect ual will never do it but it must be him by his works that he would come and stir up that part that lays within us now let's look at this here Jesus could say in that time in John 8 to to those Pharisees religious men in that time he said I said therefore unto you that you shall die in your sins for if you believe not that I am he ye shall die in your your sins he just told him if you are Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but he says you're of your father the devil your his works is what you're doing because the word is standing among you the word the same one that came to Abraham and he said before Abraham was I am he was the I am standing right there in his Temple of humanity and there they were they were resisting it rejecting it Jesus said my word it has no place in you you have not the love of God in your heart but look at this little woman down here by the well she was written off from society there were nobody have thought anything laid there but that's why Jesus said do not judge according to the outside appearance but you must judge what's on the inside there's only one way that can come it takes the perception and discernment of the Holy Ghost to discern what's down there on the inside oh glory be to God you see we must as the scripture said this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he has sent brother BR would say it just this way so simple in spoken words Original Seed he says in order to serve God you must receive the servants he sends on Earth with his word that's scripture we've been through that so it takes God manifesting himself in his promised word to set the church in motion and when I'm talking about the church I'm talking about the believer notice this how that it would it would take God moving in that way think of this in Paul would write if I can refer to a couple of these places Paul would write to the Galatians in Galatians 3:1 oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you he's calling them back to that experience that set their lives in motion you see Jesus Christ was set forth evidently among you this word I love this word it means to depict or portray openly it's that which is written before the eyes of all that others can read it's to portray or paint before the eyes so here God become visible before them it was God operating by the Revelation that he gave Paul it was God moving in that time sure the sick were healed Devils were cast out but the word as it was going forth it was a word that was changing their lives it was a reality that the Believers sitting there that they were witnessing and they were seeing Jesus Christ revealed in his power and in his glory as a matter of fact let me just say it like this the ministry of Paul Paul was the canvas that God chose to manifest himself on Elijah was the canvas that God manifested himself through Elisha there's got to be a canvas that's ordained of God that God might portray His Image his likeness brother it's not the canvas of our first birth but it's that canvas of that seed germ on the inside that is the ordained canvas of God and there's only one one that can place that image there by the stroke of his brush and that's him oh my you're talking about masterpieces look at it here what an art gallery what an art gallery by The Stroke of the master no wonder Paul could say I was with you in weakness and trembling but that your faith might rest in the power of God just referring to these places Paul would talk about even in 2 Corinthians 4 of how that he says the minds of the world is blind but God has shined into our hearts how does Minds become blind by dogma and Creeds of man they believe that they have the word but what they've got is dogmas and Creeds and dogmas and Creeds have no power there's only one that has the power and that's God the word listen now when God gets into that word that word has the power to bring Liberty and to set you free and to bring you back from where you came from that's the authority of this word being revealed this is why Paul could say you are our epistle written in our hearts before it could ever be given out Paul God revealed this to Paul and what happened right evidently set forth before them as the word was being ministered not written and engraved you know chipping away and oh my got to get this and oh my got to get this like as there when they engraved there the tables of stone no Paul said you were written not with ink you were written by the spirit of God it was the spirit of God ministered to your life and that word begin to move in your life things begin to break away maybe not all at once but little by little things are Falling Away hallelujah oh my it's The Treasure of God the testimony of Jesus Christ that is right here Among Us you see the believer is the only one that can receive this testimony this is why Paul would write by inspiration and God would give the ministerial gifts the gifts as it sets forth in Ephesians 4:13 are till we all come in the unity of the faith notice not a faith the faith the wisdom of man does the same thing it did back there in the Trap at at the moabites feast Israel was undominated National but there was a false prophet that got hired he had the wrong motives and wrong objectives he kept asking God why did he keep asking God because in his heart was the root of evil the love of money he loved popularity is that right and notice he was not able to curse Israel B got him up there and said curse him but it just let me just say this to you it shows that even what Satan would want to try to do or to try to stop he canot stop it he cannot th it Oh Glory I don't care how down you might feel you can't stop that you can't stop God's work in your life this is God's work it's not a man's work it's not a Church's work it doesn't need propped up by man it is God's work a man's Works need so many promises will you promise to come to church here promise to do this oh if you do this we'll make you this nonsense the work of God calls to that person it calls to that life on the inside let me just tell you something that is not the power of man at work it's the power of God that's moving down and taking a hold of your life Hallelujah till we all come in the unity of the faith up with that moabit his Feast he got Israel up there they got to Mixon we're all one we're all the same it was a spirit of the enemy listen now he was preaching integration in an ecclesiastical realm I hope you're with me that Spirit moved over into the natural realm as well it's Spirits at work right now God desired that his people would be separated to him and he is the word the only unity and the only thing the unity is the unity and Oneness of God inside of you to the unity of the faith so in order for this to come about this Unity of the faith God would send ministers brother says to bring this Faith up God has ministers that are Gods sent not just ministers God sent they met God the Revel the unction the inspiration that they're preaching from is an experience where they've met that God it's not calling you to a church or an idea it's trying to bring you to a place of unity in Jesus Christ and no man could do it I don't care if he preaches soft or he preaches hard his voice has nothing to do with it it's the voice that's inside that voice glory be to God this is a sovereignty of God this is why the scripture would say who hath believed our report and to whom is the armor of the Lord revealed faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God God sends the gifts in the church to manifest his presence with his people and his attitude towards us that we might see him Hallelujah glory be to God in the highest the gifts are to Magnify Him to unify the people I want you to catch this it's to Magnify Him and unify the people unifying with what the word now listen the word will come and it speaks against sin is that right the word calls sin out sin is not to be in the account it's not to be in your life amen now maybe even the person who's guilty of it they may never ever come to a place with God that that's between them and God but you see God don't want that in the camp that's why God will call out against it it's not just calling out against sin I hope you understand me it isn't just calling out against sin sometimes people hear the word say well you shouldn't cut your hair or you shouldn't wear pants or you ought to come to church and then and it becomes something to where that they feel well I they feel a little bad or why do I do this or why do I do that or yeah maybe I shouldn't do that and they missed the whole point what God is identifying is there is a condition there that needs to be greater than what is there you say well how does that happen you realize a person could stop cutting their hair they could start wearing dresses and men and everything and on and on and on we could go people start coming to church and everything else you realize and yet still it not be where it needs to be it's got to be a condition that changes in the heart of the individual because if it's just something on the outside it will fade eventually in time it'll never hold it only becomes a ritual and a doing and let me just say this to you that is not the emphasis of the Gospel but yet if it is there it will present itself on the outside it will declare itself in works is that right you see sometimes you saywell why would you have to tell people to come to church cuz sometimes you need to encourage them just like people who get hard-headed and think they don't need to go to the doctor oh I got this on my own and I can do this and I can do that well bless God I've got faith the faith of God is not something you use like a cheap toy that all of a sudden when you don't want to be inconvenience you just slap it on there that ain't Faith that's called hope that's intellectual Faith that's not Faith that's hope faith finds the perfect will of God and moves in it now I don't know about you there's times I don't feel like going to the doctor anymore the thing that I don't like about it I don't like waiting oh but the same it seems like you need patience well you know when it's there at 11:00 and you don't get to see your doctor till 2:30 thank God you know I've learned my screen on my phone's big enough that I can still study my iPad is still big enough to has my keyboard where I can still study I can still listen to the word but you understand what I'm saying there are times that where when we're looking at this that with faith that of how that it's to unify us together a real gift does not seek to separate us from the body of Jesus Christ it does not seek to separate let me just say this it's to separate from the body of Jesus Christ is to separate from the word it comes to unite Us in the word now notice this this reality of how that God would so work because God it's God moving through the gifts that he would place within his body and even as brother Bram would tell us he said it's God embodying in that gift and he also has gifted you to believe and he said between the two corresponding parts that's the secret food now Hebrews 11:1 let's try to look at this here just a moment faith is the substance of of things hoped for be evidence of Things Not Seen now let me just let me just lay this in R says what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God am in works as Faith Express faith is a revelation from God faith is a revelation he says now he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did what did Abraham do for God to call him nothing as a matter of fact he was making Idols he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work work yourself up into Faith you ever have faith it's give to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon the Revelation this is how healing comes how does healing come it comes by God revealing himself to you now let me just labor on this this is not my notes it'll be free sometimes the way we look at this or that statement that is made not just here I've heard but now I see other places through the message we take and canonize that that statement yeah healing must be a revelation and somehow we canonize it as though it's got to be an instant Miracle that's error that does not mean that at all but healing being a revelation is simp that I don't know how God's going to do it but God's already healed me you might be on your second dose of medication but your faith is resting in the Revelation maybe God has allowed the surgery to come about or maybe you know when you say well other times he's touched me like this and sometimes people are waiting on things to be revealed oh I want that to be revealed why hasn't God revealed it to me why hasn't God doesn't oh look at just even going through the land of promise God never took every city the same way but yet it was God but somehow or another we get this feeling as though that if we got to go to the doctor we're weak in faith where did you get that from I'll tell you where you got it from if it wasn't from a tradition or setting underneath the preacher you concocted it your own self and if you'd let the Holy Ghost help you he would release you and give you greater Liberty so you're not walking under condemnation and bringing everybody else under condemnation too woo Lord have mercy faith is a revelation faith is not just something we throw out there and say well have faith no faith is a revelation and it is that Revelation moving behind our faith that moves us forward this is why when it drops in your heart oh that I'm going to be well that God has made me well you might God can drop that right here in the service and maybe after this service maybe you're riding in an ambulance maybe there's something else that comes along but you realize when that Revelation is dropped you might look at it and say I didn't think it was going to be this way I didn't think it was going to be that way but look at the power of Revelation the power of Revelation is just in you the same way it was in John the Baptist when John the Baptist said this is him Behold the Lamb of God it has come exactly how God identified and then he said go ask him if he's the one or do we look for another but you see the p is revelation cannot be overthrow but revelation will direct you in the rest and the peace in the will of almighty God it will say you know what I thought it was going to be this way but it ain't that way but that don't change the Revelation Oh Glory misunderstandings of the promise do not change that Revelation and the devil says you thought it was going to come that way and it didn't yeah my peab brain thought it was going to be that way but I'm so glad devil oh stay stay around don't run I'm so glad that the Revelation it is not resting in my intellect it's resting right here I know what he has said how he's going to put the RAM on the mountain I don't know but he said it'll be there same way with the Rapture how many sitting right here that you might have thought I thought years ago or this or that or this or that a lot of things themselves I predict that maybe did not come according to how we thought but that don't change the Revelation aren't you glad you're not resting upon your predictions we're not presuming we know where we're standing glory to God I feel like running oh my if you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God works this faith Express in an audience of people where a prayer line comes through and there are all good people will'll say there's some that's trying hard to believe it trying to work themselves into it some just can't do it at all and others it's just by Grace it's just given to them let me just let me just address that devil right now if that devil is standing on your shoulder and telling you even on the internet that you don't understand this you don't understand that you're trying this and you're trying that let me tell you first of all those of you that's passed from Death unto life that's the ground that your understanding comes on you're able to look right there the devil right in the face and say I may not be able to put it all together but I know the God who put me together I know the God who changed my life and let me just tell you something God will never ever tell you that you don't belong to him as a matter of fact let me give you some word he said whosoever cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out Jesus never even ran Judas away he treated him just the same as he did the rest of them so let me just tell you right now God will never tell you well you must be one of them spies you must be a Judas you must be a that why don't right now you just tell that devil shut your mouth you're a liar you've been a liar from the beginning and I am not going to live under your oppressive lies oh my and others just by Grace it's just given to them there's the difference that's the real Revelation because faith is a revelation from God it must be revealed first now watch brother Ram will pick this this part up in the scripture Jesus clear clearly expressed this when he said no man can come to me except my father draws him first or reveals me to him first he asked the people a couple different times in this message to read these scriptures we're going to read here in John 6 now notice he says they didn't know who he was they didn't know who he was remember what remember what even the elect thought the elect even when they looked at John the Baptist they said why are they saying that Elias must first come right but when they got in the presence of the Lord Jes Jesus and he began to talk to him he didn't even mention John's name but when the word was being revealed it identified who John was who did that the Lord Jesus it was necessary for them to see that because it's all a junction you see how the word itself all coming together it was necessary at that time for them to see that they did not know who he was even when they walked in Luke 24 we thought he was the one we thought he was the one that should have redeemed Israel once again it didn't happen according to their thinking oh glory be to God they did not know who he was but God's grace came aren't you glad for that they thought he was just an ordinary man they thought him just to be as people does today some Prophet see people don't have no problem with a prophet but once you begin to identify and bring this together with the promised word of the hour that's where the problem is some prophet he was the prophet he was he was an ordinary man but there was more than that now let's read here in this scripture here John John 6:44 no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him that word draw means to impel by an inward power it's the same word that describes when Peter and them let down the net and they were trying to draw up the catch that was in that net they needed there had to be strength to draw what was beneath the surface they felt it but there had to be strength to pull what was beneath the surface above the surface and you see this is where that as he said no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him so it takes God drawing you an eye above the surface Hallelujah you are a little p Lily and you didn't know it but you know how a pond can be so M Mucky and gunky and man it's green and nasty ain't nobody would think about jumping in that pond saying W my I want to go swimming you I don't want to touch that man even want to water your roses with that kind of water you how about you and me there was a lot of mud and duck Gunk packed around in our life but what was it he let down his word at Thy Word word he let down the net what was he doing drawing up from our lives what was hidden down there that we were trying to satisfy it's like we couldn't figure out why don't I fit in why am I not happy here why isn't this enough maybe you went to church and you're like but there's got to be more I'm asking you who put that hunger inside of you I'm telling you who did it your father did it he put that hunger in you and there is nobody can satisfy that but God and I will raise him up in the last day the power of the Holy Ghost working verse 45 it's written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God see the spirit of God when it comes he comes to speak his word the speaking of his word is the revealing of his word it's the teaching of his word teaching of his word wherein that he is unveiling or unfolding his word Paul said I was taught this by the revelation of Jesus Christ so every man notice how this is worded every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me so who has heard and has learned where it's it's taking place so quickly how has this happened it wasn't that it was you know let's say necessary that my you know teaching seminars that's not what he's talking about or we can explain it or we can bring it no it's where God himself the spirit of God is there the spirit of Truth he's there to teach he's there to unfold he's there to make real he he's the one that brings the word to life otherwise the word is just a letter do you realize it takes him coming in these Services just like this the same God this same message and what does it do it comes along and discerns the Very thoughts and intents of our heart it discerns situations it discerns maybe battles We're In It deals with feelings we're feeling it deals with issues it deals with habits it deals with sin it calls Souls IT issues forth the baptism of theol ho ghost it heals the sick who is that that comes and inspires that word and makes it alive and real and calls to you and I it's him it's our father not that any man have seen the father notice what happens Whoever has heard and learned comes unto me not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hasth seen the father Jesus said in John 5:24 he he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me notice what hearing the word is to lead to real hearing of the word is to lead to believe on him that sent me so you're hearing through a human voice but who what you're hearing is not the human voice there is a connection that's going on than just between humans it's a Divine connection of the heavenly father speaking to his children he's calling to his children he's drawing Our Lives now notice you see this is why in the scripture notice let me read it again he that ha heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life this is what the real working of the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost it comes by the word it comes by the word now listen it might be why you're Minister it might be why you're sitting right here but when I'm talking about coming by the word remember the Holy Ghost is not a different person he is the word he is the experience that's being made manifest and is preached and is calling too it listen it's him it's it's him the word it's the holy spirit it's him outside of that notice Jesus said no man cometh to the father but by me he said the Holy Ghost the father will send it in my name what is his name is his word revealed right notice oh my I love how brother Bram I love this quote in Satan's Eden brother R picks it up and he's talking about scientific knowledge let me just refer to it he says notice they'll make such a scientific understanding and say all you got to do is believe just you know you heard the word and my you just believe on him and that's it but the one thing as he points out he says the one thing that they that they leave out but these signs shall follow them that believe see he fails to put that there she believed on Jesus Christ she is saved if these signs follow the believer oh he says it's he that heareth my word not just makes out not to hear it with his ears but understand it understand it brother Samuel I do good to spell my name that ain't what I'm talking about that ain't what Jesus is talking about when he's talking about hearing it's understanding is to recognize him this is my mate explain it how I don't know how but I just know amen I just know there's there's something this is him this is what I've been searching for in reality it wasn't you searching it was him drawing oh he that heareth my word not just makes out and hears it with his ears but understand it anybody can hear it a prostitute can hear it and remain a prostitute a drunkard can hear it a liar can hear it and still remain a liar but he that understandeth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and no man can do that except God for ordained him well let me ask you since you've heard it have you remained the same when you really hear it and understand it you cannot remain what you were now who does that that's God that's a for knowledge and sovereignty of God working on our life now you might be sitting here this morning and you may not be all the way where you need to be there might be things within your life but yet one thing that you do know is I'm not what I used to be I'm not what I used to be brother Samuel what do I do keep keep gleaning keep taking in the word don't try to work yourself up but listen give yourself to the word how do I give myself to the word obey the word obey the word in Simplicity ask God to continue to reveal himself to you until God brings a full transformation can I have just a few more moments now notice how brother Bram would say this I'm just going to skip some scriptures here I want to just lay this in here brother Ram is talking about here in works of Faith Express he's dealing with this betting ground and he deals with these same scriptures that he's told the people over and over in that message to read and we just read them he said now no man can understand who he is or how it is except it be revealed to you by the revelation of God and then faith in that you act accordingly he talks about how that no other man can do it it don't matter how good you are who you are it's got to be revealed to you now in paragraph 12 before let me just lay this in here everybody all right now here is where the predestinated plan is in view just as other seed the word of God is a seed and must have the ground prepared beforehand if you seed seed and just throwed it out there on the ground it would do no good the birds would pick it up you throw it among thistles and Thorns it'll choke it out pretty soon this is the Gospel Matthew Jesus talking about The Parables there is way there's places where you would select right when you're going to plant a garden you don't just say hey you know what let's just plant a garden right here a garden is a select place where you plant certain plants those of you that know that plant certain plants you plant certain plants based on the drainage of your soil what's it like in this area of the soil is it better drained right here how's the Sun come in this area and all you've got certain things that you scope out because you know I don't care how beautiful you think a particular thing is it might be the most gorgeous hydrangia bush in the world but if you don't plant it in the right place it doesn't matter how beautiful it is the place where you planted it will not yield the beauty that's there so it's got to be scoped out of where it's going to be planted now notice let's just let's just look at this here as we're coming down he said you throw it among thin thistles and Thorns it'll choke it out pretty soon Jesus parable said so so the ground has to be made ready first so God in Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age amen amen he fornew You by his forn knowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you now notice in this particular quote what he's just said here first let me go back to that statement so God in Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first now what is the betting ground that God is coming for it's that seed that which is of him that is laid dormant or as Paul would write you were dead in sin and trespasses it's not the old man that had to be raised up the old man had to die and it's that man right there that needs to have the resurrection that happened on that Easter morning right that raises a dead a dead one to life is that right so here God prepares the heart first God dealing with the heart God dealing with your life God's speaking to that heart oh my maybe that heart or that life is just resisting I don't want nothing to do or I don't this or that and God's dealing with the heart God starts drawing the heart to where what happens the heart itself it begins to feel guilty you begin to feel guilty why am I doing this I don't want to live this way I shouldn't be living this way oh I I I I I need help what is that that's working it's God preparing the heart first well brother Samuel I thought you said he already prepared me to receive he did he did but he is preparing your heart to make way for him to come to that seed just as a person would go and you would scope out ground where you're going to plant that Garden you don't just even though it could be the most Choice spot this is the spot oh the Sun comes right here oh it's well irrigated you just don't walk out there and just start throwing seed you don't walk out there and just dump tomato plant it is a spot that you have chosen and when that spot that choosing what makes that choosing real is when you start going along there maybe you take the paint Canon Oh Glory I feel like preaching now when God comes down around your life and goes it's already been marked out he's letting you know you have always been a place marked out I've never lost sight of you I don't care what kind of a mess and what kind of a trouble you were in you were always a chosen place that belonged to me you see he's got to make it known to you and I it's not enough that he has faith that same faith that he has in his word must come and pulsate and energize in our life that it would reciprocate back to him in the same measure I believe you papa I believe you papa I believe you papa once you get it marked out staked off what do you do get around the edge you know that edging tool then you can work scrape that get that grass out of here why you don't want that grass coming up in your plants so first of all justification he's already marking out you belong to him sanctification he comes he sets the mind in order for Holiness when you look at I don't want to do that I I don't want these things around my life I I don't want that and what's he doing he's he's clearing out the space that's already laid out for him what's going on he's making knowing is choosing he's choosing is moving upon this ground that he prepared beforehand then he sends it down there maybe you know whether you scrape the grass up or you plow it up you know you got to break up fow ground you got to break that ground up because you just can't put seed on hard ground that's why God's got to get you get it get it replace that Stony heart with a heart of Flesh come on now somebody he gives that I'll give you I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit where all of a sudden where you were so hard I don't want nothing to do with God I don't want this or I don't want that or I don't want this and then God begins to move in that place and things begin to change your mind your thinking begins to change what's happening it's God himself working upon that ground that he has prepared beforehand and he's bringing it to himself he breaks the ground up and finally as the ground itself is broke up then he begins to plant he begins to plant he begins to place within that ground what needs to come forth and that ground that I'm talking about that ground is that seed of God that lay within you that was the prepared ground of almighty God that is when the scripture said in The Parables was the good ground it was good ground it was word notice nothing wrong with the word some fell in Stony places some among thorns and thistles some fell over here and then the word fell in good ground nothing was wrong with the word what was it what made the difference the ground that the word fell in the ground that the word fell in is what actually declared amen the word itself that it had received can I read you this in closing I love how brother Brown words this I just got to read it he says let me let let me let me read that in that last part again I I can't leave that off you you know it'd be like to me be like eating cake without icing BL I don't want it I like cake with icing so God in Sovereign Grace prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he fornew You by his forn knowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you that's the reason you staggered out of these things and staggered into what you have now did you catch how he word said I I you know for me I'm just I'm just kind of simple but I looked at that this morning after I've been looking at this for weeks and I thought staggered what does that mean staggered means you know you're just kind of you really don't know what's going on you just just you don't know what's taking place I mean you just I don't know what it is I just you know I've been thinking about going to church see there's nothing you could look at that and say wow that's real Faith No but what's happening is you're staggering out of staggering out of this where are you going I don't know I mean see it really doesn't look like anything real sure it doesn't look like anything you would put your garden in right there that's staggering out but God knows what he's doing you don't even know what's taking place you don't even know why in the world you ended up here right you don't even know why in the world how in the world I get connected with this how in the world I end up here why in the world did this happen why in the world would this get R see you don't know but you see God knows that's what's important and God being being you staggering here God who always knew you he's letting you know I've always known you I've known about you my you stagger out of these things and you stagger into what you have now so don't don't listen to me now don't don't don't take it don't don't get offended when people are staggering out of and staggering into well brother Samuel I want to see people quit staggering how long did it take you to quit staggering right as a matter of fact if you'll be honest you still stagger just like I do right there's certain things come on now there's certain things in how God would deal with our life we have no more knowledge about it than nothing right God grounds a plane in Memphis Prophet didn't know why he did it he didn't say wow there's something Supernatural here no he didn't make nothing out he didn't have to everything was no it was just you know brother Joey just just everyday life I'm going to go down and mail these letters I got letters I need to I need to mail and and here he is just going down through there you see the Staggering part within it even sometimes where you and I come into places we do not know how God's going to answer his word boy I tell you what we could really preach right here sometimes we're we're looking and we're waiting well Lord I don't know what you want me to do Lord I don't want you to do Faith itself is subconscious now there's certain things in the word that God tells you to do you don't got to pray about it is that right I mean when the Bible says come to the house of God you don't have to pray and say is it your will Lord that's wrote in the word there's a lot of things that are wrote in the word you don't got to pray about it just got to have faith in The God Who said it now notice this here staggered out of and staggered into look he said it's God leading you to the place where he ordained for you to be if this ground isn't prepared beforehand it can't grow that's the reason this seat of faith when you're preaching Faith you see the discernments of the Lord and see what takes place and all the gifts of the Bible working people work themselves up oh Hallelujah I believe it and come out and they find themselves disappointed see the ground has to be foreordained and you know when it strikes it let me just read this I I know we've heard this so many times but I just I just love it like my little Eagle last night he knew when he heard that scream of that mother Eagle there's a lot of difference between that and the cluck of the H see because he was an eagle from the egg if you had have looked down in that barnyard you would have looked at him and said what in the world is that ain't a chicken in there but nobody there knew what he was but his mama knew and his mama knew there's an egg that I had in my Nest it's been lost but I'm coming to find it coming to redeem it I'm coming to claim it so Mama Eagle sweeps over you see he wasn't he wasn't made an eagle right then he was always an eagle and a Christian always was that's the reason he said with divorce when you divorce because you were trapped into it by your first parent Adam and Eve you become a sinner by Nature listen you didn't want to be brother Brian who's the you he's talking about the real you the real you not the you that you've always thought was you but the real you that laid down on the inside that God knew if I just and get him into my presence when I can get him into my presence presence and make myself known to them they did not want to be trapped in that but he comes he spreads his Wings by his power he begins to move over list stand you didn't want to be that but now you heard the gospel and Faith cometh by hearing Revelation comes by hearing there is a little something inside of you another man sitting right by you could say I don't believe that stuff nonsense I don't believe that nothing to it but like they did on the day of Pentecost they laughed said these men are full of new wine they know it was it was a great thing to those it was happening to isn't it a great thing why it was God revealing himself to the individuals While others laughed these were rejoicing it was an individual Revelation which is faith faith that's revealed faith is the substance of things hoped for expected Revelation is Faith brings Faith what is it it places within us that deposit of an expectation that faith that comes by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the earnest of our expectation that revelation of faith that comes maybe there's a situ sitation going on in your life healing whatever it might be it still requires a revelation from God it's the evidence of Things Not Seen and it tremendous it's the evidence just what James had said by the spirit of God without faith without works faith is made Vo so faith and works are husband and wife the wife expresses to whom she belongs and the husband expresses this is my wife he reveals himself to her as her husband she yields herself and makes herself known I am your wife she declares remember remember remember through her life proverbs 31 her husband is known in the gates where transactions take place where lives are set free holds are broken healing takes place Deliverance comes her husband is known in the gates he's the same yesterday today and forever it's an Evidence it's an Evidence in our life you know think about it brother Brown would put it so simple he said a person could say they're married he said if they say they're married and they can't show their husband or their wife you doubt them you say you're married but you don't where's your husband at or where's your wife at well you know but when you see their husband War the husband's claim you see his wife then you know you there there there's the evidence right there that's the same way right now when Jesus said Philip said show us the father have I been so long with you when you have seen me you have seen the father now there's not one of us that contain the fullness of the godhead bodily but that portion that lick of fire that light life that's went into that bedding ground of that seed in your life then that little licks of fire it joins together that's the godhead bodily made manifest in its fullness among us because we are a part of that body of Jesus Christ by this same Faith the Bible says by it they obtained a good report how was it it was that faith that Revelation that Revelation that came into their lives it further taught them it showed them it directed them in every part of their life and this morning no matter where you're at I like how Paul would write this here I just just want to read this this to you Paul said in 1 Thessalonians 2:13 for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when ye receive the word of God which he heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe effectually worketh it shows itself operative in your life he's working his word being spoken is what freed the prison bars from around our life remember brother brandham when they're asking he sees all these people behind prison bars brother Braham he looks at himself he looks at his arms he says I'm not strong enough to get him out of there but he stepped back and he said House of hell yeah give way in the name of Jesus Christ begin to Creek pop maybe your life today is creaking and popping what is that it's the word going to work it's the word loosening creaking and popping and breaking away the things of the world House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ and those bars fled away from that life it was removed and the people who were in there were good people now what was inside of their life could be expressed you know what that house of hell was it's our first birth yeah it's the organizational systems of man that keeps man bound tells him just come to church be a good guy you'll be all right but there's a longing inside of your heart as an eagle there's there's got to be more than programs there's got to be more is there's something not satisfying me what is that God prepared that ground before him to receive him so when you would walk people are not saying are you Methodist are you Baptist are you Pentecostal but there's something about it that they'll say I don't know what it is about their life but I know they're a Christian I know there's something different about their life it's a presence do you realize it isn't just even our outward adornment although that will reflect itself but there's a presence of God that comes with your life when Moses came off the mountain he had to cover his face his face Shone with the glory of [Music] God your life shining with the glory of God the Bible said the glory of the Lord shall be seen upon thee I say this morning in the name of Jesus Christ House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ Satan you're a liar and you've already been defeated amen hallelujah it's not my word but it's the word of my father that dwells inside of my heart it says speak [Music] it I'll just go ahead and say it in the name of Jesus Christ it's time for prodal to come home it's time months ago when God dropped that in my heart is this is the time this is the hour this is the season for lives to be changed Hallelujah this is the time for shackles to be broken this is the time for the captive to go free Hallelujah this is the time this is the hour the closing moments glory be to God run to him with all your heart run to him with all your heart let that word keep working in your life as it's been working in your your life look what it's doing in your life not only did it bring about a change and a transformation it's still working in your life your life's not a tomb you're a temple not a tomb dead people go in tombs he's not dead it's a living God inside of Living Stones living out his word glory be to God in the highest Hallelujah glory be to God in the highest let's pray Heavenly Father you know the needs Lord Jesus you know Lord our hearts Lord as we come here you would speak to our Our Lives Faith operating in the faith of the hour Lord Jesus how we thank you for healings thank you for the gifts of the Spirit all of these are parts that belong to and in the body of Jesus Christ but lordu in this hour the work of God the sign of the Messiah oh God the revealing of the son of man Lord Jesus you came and you manifested that in your promised word and Lord Jesus that same one you're the same one who descended in Revelations 10 the same God who made himself known to John in Revelations 5 descended that Mighty Angel Lord God as a people of God called as it were the 11th Hour workers the 11th verse go take the book eat that book eat that word except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you to become a partaker of that word you're the same one the same MDC who met Abraham on the LS of memory gave him Bread and Wine you gave him what was needed after the battle was over lord Jesus right here this morning dear God there's battles that's raging lives hearts that you're speaking to calling to yourself you're marking out this hate this is ground that belongs to to me dealing with their heart calling them Lord maybe the cracking and the popping dear God of holds that's been upon their life dear God as you come along it isn't the word of a man it isn't Lord God it isn't the word of a man but God how that you would come it's the faith of the presence of God identifying himself in his word made manifest and that corresponding part within their life to believe Lord God how could they except Lord God you would come and stimulate their faith by your faith Lord Jesus may they fully believe you may they Lord God no matter where a person or a life might be this morning Lord I pray that they'll continue to yield yielding to the voice Lord they might be staggering around right now but may Lord God I pray that they would continue to stagger out of where they're at staggering into the place that you've ordained for them not even realizing what's going on but they realize Lord you're changing them you're changing them oh God you're changing them Lord things that they once loved you're causing them Lord to look at it in disdain now they abore it they no longer want to be a partaker of it Lord lives that you oh God betting grounds right here in our lives that you have moved fully into Lord dear God this is not the word of a man that we've received it's the word of God it's effectually working in our lives dear God lord Jesus you're the one Lord moving in our lives that Lord God that little Betty ground what is it it's a place that the word can grow that the word can grow make itself manifest Lord Jesus granted Lord God may we be faithful Lord to make sure that weeds stay out of this Garden oh God that our minds would stay clear our Spirits Lord uncontaminated no wonder Paul would write to each one of the churches in each one of the letters that he would preser you blameless Soul spirit and body until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ granted Lord Jesus May Our Lives Lord God Be Free Lord if there's any ensnarement as Paul would write to the galatian church Stand Fast in the Liberty where with Christ had made you free be not entangled again with a Yol of bondage he would go on to tell them how was this done among You by The Works of the law how were the Miracles done or was it by the hearing of Faith Lord Jesus I pray this morning may we lord God I pray you find ground may we lord God like gardeners tend to these Gardens Lord if there's things in the mind things Lord God that Lord may be feelings feelings of resentment maybe it's a grudge maybe it's things Lord God that have come our way hurt other many other things Lord complexes father may we take the word of God yielding Lord that our ground we don't want anything to take away from that image of Christ granted Lord I pray help us Lord help us Jesus oh in the name of Jesus Christ amen aren't you glad he made you the Christian that you really always were he made you the Christian that you really always were you didn't look like a Christian didn't think like a Christian you didn't act like a Christian but down on the inside but he came Church couldn't do it but God can use and he uses gifts he uses vessels God moves through his word to get his get the attention of his children and then what is expressed a real Christian a real believer glory be to God oh I just love him don't you oh my how many can identify with
