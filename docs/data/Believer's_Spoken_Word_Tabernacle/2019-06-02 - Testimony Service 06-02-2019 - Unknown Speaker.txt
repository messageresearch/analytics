========================================

into the bedroom opened up the top of that roll desk and there was his Bible and those open workbooks where he had cross-referenced back and forth tweet so the message it just it opened up a whole new life for him too I just want to thank the Lord and also to the Tuesday night prayer meetings I just can't say how much of a blessing it's been and last Tuesday we came I had such a pain in my left eye before we left the house I thought well maybe I better not go no I'm gonna go it's just a devil so I got here and it was still there all through the prayer meeting things but the prayer meetings are just there so mostly they're just like supernatural it's just such a presence comes in here and so it's a longer a little bit longer so I was out side waiting on the rest of the family to come out and I just felt the unction to walk back in here and say just pray for my eye it was hurting so bad I just wanted to cry and the brother I don't know who all came back in I think some of the young people and other Samuel I don't know came back in but it touched me and when I left here I had no pain in that left eye so I thought Devon will give you this one more black guy so I called my doctor I went to a doctor the next morning and he said I could see something was trying to happen there but it's not there [Applause] please God God still moves doesn't he Amen let's just sing that little course again I wanna that's so much of thanking for look round and see the good things and he does for me well I know I'm unworthy of them all his blessings he freely gives now I owe my life to Him and I've got so much to thank him for help me sing a church well I've got so much they owe so much to praise and for well you see now God has been so good to me then when I think of what he's done and where he brought me from I've got so much the thing for the day Crescent you come at this time listen I want to thank him oh I wanna thank him for letting me see this last day in time mystery now I know then my name is Oliver well the seals they have been revealed someday soon that body changed with bune I've got so much today and for more time I've got so much pain I've got so much bang hope so much brain zoo for well you see he has been so good to me I think Oh [Music] he bro clearly and now I've got so much [Music] may have let you Saints I did have to take a few notes here so don't get nervous just a couple notes oh I don't lose my thought but I just I just want to thank the Lord for there had been a question Satan had been posing to me for years now it basically just said how can the Holy Ghost filled believer you know make such big mistakes how can you be filled with Holy Ghost and still have such faults and failures and things that are lingering on even before you had the Holy Ghost and I didn't really have an answer for that tell you the truth not that I'm prone to feel that I had o Satan and explanation or anything but within myself I just knew I just did not have an answer and it might be rather kind of elementary but um got you're dealt with me during these meetings and show me so testimony me miss sheriff y'all so I I knew I've been filled with the Holy Ghost and brother Sam you've been hit on this morning you know when she crossed your you know God brought the children of Israel there at a certain season when the waters were deep and he parted the waters you know so that's a symbol you know going into the Promised Land you can fill with the Holy Ghost and the only way they that's you know once you're sealed your co2 the day or your Redemption because the only way you're going to get back is a few parts of water and let you back again and that's not happening so I knew I was you don't feel what the Holy Ghost so I just didn't have an answer for for that and then as brother Samuel was saying this morning I Holy Ghost is like a button or or a door to see so when you get it it just goes in you to the texture small and then it starts growing but you still have a lot else that's still hanging on from from your previous birth and you know if that's still prone to faults and failures and so as the seed grows you know the Holy Ghost does give us power for service but we're still living in these bodies with faults and failures and so brother Tim X he started going into this and saying well how can you be you know your sins be gone but yet you still have to die daily basically you know and so it just it just kind of came to me you know like this you know he was saying how is your sins totally taken away and then but then you still have to repent your sins every day and it just kind of came to her you know the Holy Ghost gives up does give us power for service but we're still gonna make mistakes but there's a higher power than our mistakes and that's the blood of Jesus Christ and that's what the blood is for so we have you know the Holy Ghost for service and power and that's going to put us in service but we're still going to make mistakes and then the blood covers what we can't we can't cover it you know just and how a brother 10:1 just saying hey we you know what we walk with Him we make mistakes we die daily we repent of our sins we get up we dust ourselves off and we walk on with Jesus so I guess that that was just huge to me to to see the difference between okay yes I do have power but I don't have power for it's there it's just not in full maturity yet it's growing so as it grows it pushes out more of me and the last mistakes and things I'll have and you know the prophet of God did teach us you know very clear that all the all the vices and all it all Satan and demons and and all that they're just tools in the hand of God and when you think about that you know that way wise are the tools because you know God has a work to do and he needs tools to do this you know so he gives us these you know we have we have these things that hang on and oftentimes you know it as myself you know when he gave me the Holy Ghost like a lot of the tools but you know a lot of these things fella rave right away you know and it's like brother Sam was preaching this morning it that's because that's what he needed to get me there like the prodigal son to just for me to get desperate enough to receive the Holy Ghost I had certain things that he had and then he just let him all away but not all of them so the rest it's a process he'll when he's done with that tool you know he'll put it back in the tool box he's done you know work in progress and so that's why I believe that the the scripture can say so distinctly that no weapon formed against you will prosper you know it's gonna you know may be successful first season we're born is saying shaped in iniquity but once you receive the Holy Ghost at some point he says okay he's got it I'm done with this and then there's the final conclusion you know one day yeah it's gonna be done with all these tools and we'll say you know demons and Satan and he's gonna put that back in the tool box which which is death and hell and he's going to take them and just throw them on to see you guys for getting fullness or throw them in the lake of fire sorry because he's done with this work then we'll live with him so all our faults and our failures and all these things are only for a time God's gonna let him there until he's he's done with them until then the Holy Ghost is for power the blood is for you know the things that where we haven't overcome yet so I justify if I could just you know encourage you just don't walk with the Lord claim you know feast on the word that the Holy Ghost grow in you and for the rest not the let's eat and beat you up on that as I am NOT going to play it safe beat me up on this I'm gonna claim the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen I like the same except this morning I got tired of being myself I'm a nice it's a matter that this boy praise him until then my heart will go on singing [Music] we'll carry on until the day my knives we hope that city until the day God come there whether it makes gonna give us some I see it one more time until then but until then for my heart will go singing with joy I'll carry you praise God till the day - be home city [Music] until the day god bless y'all everybody put your seat belt on brother Samuel told me to go ahead and take much time as I needed I just want to give you a little bit of background about myself some of you know me and I've shared some things about myself but I really felt a need to share a little bit about me before I shared what happened to me this past weekend from a very young age I've got on the middle so I've got an older brother always been stuck in the middle and from a very very young age people have told me that you're different you're different than your brothers you're different than the rest of your family are different didn't really make sense to me today it makes a whole lot of sense [Applause] my kids are very blessed to be they have parents like us because I didn't have parents like that I know they loved me but the things I was exposed to at a very young age wasn't acceptable it's not acceptable to me but it brought me to where I'm at it brought me to where I'm at the things I did as a youngster I would never ever ever want alcohol drugs things like that the road I went down was not and I could sit here and say that I shouldn't be here I should not be here today the accidents there's ekits I could see it I could keep you all here for hours and tell you things why I shouldn't be here car accidents in trees that were missed in the car accidents like feet away if we would hit that tree we'd all been and that was just one accident there was many accidents but I was very very troubled as hyoga stir very troubled the testimony that brother Tim was talking about Oh brother branham just drive for three hours reading his Bible in the driver's seat that was God there was many times I woke up in my bed and I looked out into the driveway to see if my car was there because I had no idea how I got and I drove home it wasn't me driving because if it was me driving and it's such a blessing to think back on how rough it was but the tender hand of mercy all the way down all the way down because it wasn't me I'm not worthy of any any of this I'm not worthy other so I went through the system state of Ohio told me what I had to do which pretty much did or I spent a lot of time in jail in during this time stainable to the state of Ohio I had to go do certain things I could go to meetings to help the problem that I had well that's kind of where in alcoholics Anonymous they give you they tell you that you have to find a higher power I believed in God I believed but was I a true believer no I was it he believed in me did I believe in him at the time No so I'm praying I'm praying that Lord would bring me her my wife I was born in Florida she was born in Lorraine who brings us together who brings us together her mother and father that's been walking with the Lord a long time he brought me her she brought me here amazing how amazing is that the day I saw her I'd been praying and we were at Brian and my brother played basketball together there's another how does that brother Mark told my wife we need to write a book perhaps we will they were playing basketball together we're sitting in a gymnasium the lights are brighter than you can imagine I look across the gym there sits Amanda the gym goes dark and there's a light right there shining on her there she is there she is I knew it I knew it she was the one for me we may not have done things exactly the way they should have been done but God knows he knows so moving forward there came a day we had come to church we were we were the seasonals you know Christmas and Easter and stuff like that and uh so came a day I'm terrible with dates and stuff like that but there came a day brother Samuel came into my life sister Kim came into our life I got a phone call you'll have to forgive me uh no brother salmon it's a really good about remember these kind of things but he called me up says hey let's go have breakfast go with the blue sky went to blue sky place was packed we're having breakfast he's talking to me about the Lord in a he says are you ready to give your life to the Lord and I didn't even think about it there was no thought process yes this is okay let's pray in the middle blue sky place is packed I start hauling trying to pray brother Samuels praying with everything he's got I opened up my eyes look at me it just looks different the ketchup looks really red the walls look really blue because they got like the clouds in there painted and stuff he says okay now if the next step is going to be bad you have to be baptized and this was a Saturday so that's next day we came here he was sounding text I think it was brother Richard used to get them the baptism will go in here and that was a very emotional day for me very emotional day and brother Richard can attest to that and uh I've always been an emotional person but it has it had a different meaning it wasn't just oh man it wasn't oh man like my dog died or something like that because something was happening something was happening and I didn't know what it was so it was kind of like scary but it was good scared so yeah I get baptized in just a little nugget my wife and I his first date was that blue sky that wasn't planned that wasn't in my plan I didn't have like a journal saying okay this is what I want to happen this is how it happened so we're coming to church last year and a half some of you know we have a bed here we back slid but the Lord still has had a plan he wasn't he wasn't giving up [Applause] so about four weeks ago my wife was talking to sister Kim she came in she's like Sammy wants to talk to you it naturally of like ready to run the back door so it says you brother are you ready to come back home and I said yes I'm ready to come back home there was something in my stomach from that day we stopped coming it was like a brick something in my stomach I just didn't feel right I didn't feel right let me tell you something today I feel right so my uncle was getting married the Saturday of the meetings that we have so I'm really torn because my family's coming into town I want to see my family I want my family to see my kids but when we were coming we came back to church on a Tuesday was the prayer me and even brother Richard said he said I was really surprised to see y'all come back on a Tuesday we have things we had to get straight so we were supposed to go to this this this wedding you know and I'm torn because I want to see my family but yet something's telling me you got to be here you got to be here I got something for you I got something for you and I was even talking to brother Bryan here like you know I've never prayed like I have in those days leading up to that to the I've never prayed like a something come over something's gonna happen something's gonna happen my expectations were through the roof I knew it something was gonna happen he has got something for me so we went from Saturday we were talking well uh we're probably going to miss the service we'll go Friday miss Saturday will come Sunday that's closer God it went to all right we're going to go to the service Saturday and then we'll just go to the reception after service well we let him go to the wedding because my wife and I talked like we already know what's gonna happen with the language drinking whatever else and we're like no that's not the atmosphere but that's not the atmosphere we need again that's not the atmosphere my children need to be he's got something for me and I need to be here I need to be here so there was a few scriptures that were brought out in a you know reading our daily strength devotionals the prayer meetings Friday service Saturday service you know that confirmed where we needed to be and that was at the fellowship that's where we went and I knew that some of the family members were gonna just draw their own conclusions well he's not here he's too good why aren't they here versus kids we're all up here were they out why I talked to my dad my dad's pretty understanding person I said dad there's a pretty good chance that we're gonna be late I got to be a church I got to be there I've got a really strong feeling that we he's got something for me and I gotta be there I don't know what it is but I he's got something for me so then after the service Saturday I sent a text to my mom I'm sorry but we're not gonna make it everything's okay we're just not gonna be there well she was disappointed in you know it kind of got me down a little bit but if she knew what I do she wouldn't be disappointed she wouldn't be disappointed she would want to be here too so Saturday or Sunday service was like nothing I've ever experienced in my life I've never experienced anything like that with all the things that I've done and in sports I've done this I've done that whatever I've had really like ultimate adrenaline rushes and let me tell you something that doesn't even hold a camp - what happened here doesn't even hold a candle to I was sitting I've been struggling with something for a really really really long time it's been holding me back and I know it's been holding me back and that stick should addiction to cigarettes and I was sitting right there about halfway through the service and I said Lord I'm done I'm done with it just take it from me I don't want it I don't want it he took it right there [Applause] turn I turn my back to it the devil has been trying to get to me this thing right here that shield right there then them darts that the Prophet talks about their darts and arrows it's like doink don't toy don't think you can have it back don't won at the end of the service I'm standing up here it's something hit me like I stuck my finger in a light socket like I got electrocuted he filled me up he filled me up I know he did he filled me with the Holy Ghost and I have not been the same I'm a different person I walked out of the doors a different person completely different he deserves all the glory thank you thank you for all the prayers to because I was sitting in my kitchen table before we came back and I looked at my wife and I said everybody's praying for us everybody's praying for us I can feel it and that was the next day when sister Kim was on the phone and then I talked to brother Samuel so how does that happen amen praise the Lord Amen praise John and I play it I played a lot of sports when I was and I was in high school but I was usually on the bench so I don't know what that feels like but I'm glad he let me know that what I'm experiencing when I come the house of God is better than winning a chick a man when he was on the cross I was on his mind praise God I came by my own you see that Ben Ben's got a testimony for us but when he was on the cross was on his mind for he knew me Ben baby come Oh yeah [Music] Florie mates hitting a child [Music] so so unworthy of his mercy hallelujah but when he saw the crows [Music] amen Ben's got a testimony for us prison sure I'm nervous but I'm gonna go ahead and go for it so just wanted to start with like background to like since I was 4 years old my heart was always very tender towards the Lord and I remember him dealing with me I think my mother I don't remember it but my mom remembers it I was watching a video Christian homeschooling video and then the teacher on there have made an invitation if you want to accept Lord Jesus as your Savior then you know just pray with us and I did I was only four years old but I remember it but yeah that's that's what it happened to me at 4 years old and then God dealt with me up again at 8 years old to get baptized and I didn't really know when I got baptized I don't know I thought I was good I thought that was the last step but then at age 11 I God I think it just had to be him dealing with my heart because I can remember there was one night I don't know if mom remembers it or not but there was one night where I was in my bed and I started crying for like almost I want us I wanted to say for no reason but it was just I was crying and then I went you know mom trying to help me almost like I was like I just don't know what's going on I was like I thought you know I was good you know I've been baptized I thought I I was okay and I didn't really know if there even was a Holy Ghost you know I mean III heard the word but I know really what it was at the time but that Mont I was like why is their wedding church so happy I was like I understand that and moms like well you know that's the Holy Ghost and everything and everyone loves each other you know it makes the one you know together puts everyone together so then at age 11 through 15 I trade you know seeking the Holy Ghost but I think you know the reason why I hadn't received it you know for a while it was because I tried to I had like a plan of how everything was gonna have in my life but it's like the most unexpected thing no it's not at all it's not at all with people you don't make it out to be it's just it's so different then you know I tried to see camp like I said I just I got discouraged and then and about I don't know I'm just gonna you know I said you know about was about 16 years old and I was just tired I was just I was tired I was tired of seeking it I was so discouraged and I just wanted to get out into the world I was I was tired I told Dad I mean I can remember about maybe three or four weeks ago I had made a threat to my dad that I was gonna do much of stuff I was like you don't want me to go to campus I said I'm just gonna live it up or whatever and I said what to bring a bunch of stuff in the house and he said no you're not he said the Holy Ghost will tell me if you're gonna do that and I was so discouraged I was like how I was like look I mean yeah you people might laugh when I say this bells like me I got my temps I kind of I got I've got I've got everything you know I've got I can make purchases without cash well I kept my debit got a phone and everything so I thought I had everything and I was like I was tired I was like dad I was like what'd I do to deserve this I'm like I keep trying to find a satisfaction I was like nothing's nothing's working I've tried everything and then dad's like you just gotta said you know the answer and I was not like to accept that answer because I'd know what it was gonna Intel I didn't know what was gonna happen to me then God had dealt with my life at last week at a prayer meeting need that with my life and I started her back to him and I still had things in my life that I that wasn't surrender and I had habits and different things but and then I could just remember Friday the whole weekend the devil was just punching me so hard he was discouraging me you know like his brother Tim was preaching on spiritual transportation and you know and then living under eternal life law I was like look these services are not for me I was like I just want to leave I was like this is just not for me and then I can remember Saturday night I got so discouraged I was like I'm never gonna have the Holy Ghost strike another ten years I said there's too many things in my life I was like that's never gonna happen and then Sunday I didn't even have the attention I'm getting the Holy Ghost I was like I want this weekend to be over with so I can get back to doing whatever I was doing but God had different plans for my life and I remember it was just so strong and then I I was just trembling and I brother Richard he helped you know and I can remember I think brother Adam too they helped pray for me and then I went over here and then holy goes just like numb to me and I never experienced anything like that my whole life but then after that I didn't know like through the week I was like is it just a feeling or what happened and then I just noticed I tried to persuade myself almost and then the devil tried to persuade like nothing happened because i-i've I've been the camp last year I remember like the prince the Lord fell down and I shouted so loud and I was like I hope it's not another one of those times but it was real it affected my daily life and I thought it was I can remember telling mom and dad I said that's fake I said I said the life that I told Paul to I said the life you guys live is just fake I remember telling him that and then they said no Ben it's real and I didn't know that until I've been there and it's just everything is different your diet is so different everything everything you do is so different and even the things you love are just so different and listening to the messages and even hearing my dad preach it's just like a numbing fire it just keeps like keeps burning but what I would say right now to anyone especially especially a young person who's wanting to receive the Holy Ghost I would just tell you to not get discouraged and just keep seeking it and then ask God to give you a hunger for it and then to allow him to ask him to draw you to himself and then when you feel the presence of the Lord I know it's tempting because you're not exactly a part of it so I know it's tempting you just run a run away because your app if you don't understand the power of something you're apprehensive about it that's how I was but instead of doing that just I would tell you to run into it you know just run into it and allow God to do it because you know he has to do it his way because I thought I was like this is gonna happen that's gonna happen and won't true at all he just he took all that stuff from me just I know sometimes because he told the devil told me this is a lot of times young people they think that they have to go out and experience the world and stuff and I tried I did everything was to the limits that mom and dad would let me do I tried everything you know but just don't you don't have to do it you don't have to even desire it you don't have to do it you just ask God to take those and a lot of times they also they think that the Holy Spirit will take away like oh he'll make me just like not even what pleasure but what he does is he changes your definition of pleasure that's just what happened to me this week that's just what happened to me and it's real I know if it's not very you know if you don't feel that yeah but it's not about what you feel and there's just like even like a you know there's there's times you make mistakes and stuff like brother ever saying you know you make mistakes to know they're saying you make mistakes but that's what the what's and you realize where you came from where you don't willfully walking into that I never thought this life was possible to be quite honest I'm like how did I get here I just I know y'all were praying for me even when I didn't know it you all for prayed for me and I appreciate that and just may God bless [Applause] everyone say so mr. Brown he wanted me to give a testimony but today all I wanted to do was bask in the testimony what happened son I want to add something when we were here mostly people front Euan come up he was right next to me I grabbed the whole that I knew it was I knew because you know I'm not muted this way and something kept saying it's finished it's finished and holding him up and how we just so grateful because being a deacon I sit in the back being around I've been around for a long time and sometimes you know who has it or don't have it and one day I told my wife I says you know if we had a testimony service I'm wondering how many people could really come up and say I have the Holy Ghost so this was a tremendous service and and I knew that Benjamin was struggling I knew it even though I didn't talk to him I knew it and he was just tremendous for me he was one so I just want to add I knew what's going on god I'll never be able to take that away from God gave it to him enemy on they'd be able to take it away from and my god is real insane they have a little bit man with Brian's cousin before us oh my god is real he's breathing my soul my god it's real for he has most made me whole his love for me it's like your goal my god is real oh I can feel him in my soul more time oh my yes my god is real he is reeling my soul my God is real Hori as most babyhood for his love for me it's like oh my god is real [Music] amen Bush y'all just one arm give a quick toast the morning then I'm gonna sing but um just want to give God thanks for everything he he did for me this uh during those services especially Sunday I know what God did at work in my life but probably back in 2009 2010 when brother Sam I was talking about our youth meeting that we had you know God spoke to me at work one time I had a question in my heart cuz during that time there was a lot of ministers saying you know you can only have the Holy Ghost if you have a seed in your heart you know to be quickened so I always had that question Lord do I even have a seed you know to be quickened and and he spoke to me one day sorry he said you were my seed that's always stuck with me but you know I just kept holding on to things to the world and you know God just started taking things one after another and but there you know I believe God did a change in my life and I had the Holy Ghost but with my past saying just always kept condemning me condemning me and I can never just worship the Lord I've always wanted to you know I just wanted to let loose and let God take control you know of my whole heart and when brother Samuel read from the book of Joshua you know sanctify yourselves prepare yourselves you know even at the prayer meeting like Aaron was saying something just hit my heart I can't even explain it I told my family I told my girlfriend I said something's gonna happen I could not I could not explain it something was just like over top of me I knew something was gonna happen but I didn't I don't know if it was gonna be the whole assembly or I don't know and I just told everybody I was like I haven't told my cell phone I felt like shame guard my whole life you know just living underneath the privileges you know just felt like Satan has robbed me you know I never was able to surrender and just letting the Philistines we don't always take what shame guard grew you know I just always lived underneath my privileges and I lost my joy too and I always felt like you know it was a chore to read the Bible or listen to a message and you know I just asked God to give me back my joy this this weekend you know I just wanted more of him to just live for him completely you know and just everything that I've done in the past I just wanted it to be under the blood you know and not be hit with it all the time sinking always punching me and stuff just be sitting there and the words coming forth and I want to get up and shout but you did this you did that you know remember you know you better not shout you better not whatever and just the whole the whole weekend just and brother singing I said sanctify and prepare I've never like Aaron said I've never prayed as much as I ever have in my life and just haven't even fasting that whole time Friday I I was never hungry you know fasting and praying I was never hungry and brother Brett you know how brother Bram said you know when you're desperate enough God will God will show up and I was desperate you know I wanted I don't want the Bible to just be a letter I want it to be a reality I wanted God to live in me become flesh again and that was my heart's desire and that's just what was really speaking to me you know the Holy Ghost is a person you know and and just Sunday just hearing the word and just being in that atmosphere but just something struck me I was able to just select loose you know I'm just worship God like I always wanted to like you know I I ran around and I've never felt so afraid in my life you know well Karen said we we played sports and basketball you know there's been many times you know the adrenaline rush but I want to trade that for nothing in the world I just like to yeah and just what Ben was saying you know just ever since I haven't been able to put my Bible down I haven't you know just just listening the message after message just God speaking to me and like you know I may not understand everything but brother's saying I said you know I'm just keep filling the water pots they'll turn the water into wine you know you know saying always you select to battle with me you know you know what's this mean we'll just mean what's this mean you know and I could just never you know I just you know would ponder on that you know what let God have his way but well I just want God to take control reveal what he has for me every day he knows what I need so just like to end um one more thing a couple years ago when I was dealing with a lot of things in my life brother say Merle spoke I was speaking on a Thursday night I'm not sure what message it was but he spoke something I believe was a prophesy over my life you know that really struck to me and I went back and

lives I know my Redeemer here's our part let all creation testify let this lie within me cry because I know my redeemer well that sounds real good one more time as our brothers get ready I know my redeemer don't ready Oh [Music] creation testify let this life would be me crying hi [Music] back in I'm currently in my last year of residency so to practice and back in January I had put in some job applications and such and and I'd asked the church to pray graciously I know many have continued brother Sanchez even sometimes before the church they've brought it really appreciate that and thank you the as far as the process it took you know January the starting practice takes a it's a significant amount of legal legalese and yet to be very careful with the practices you consider inside so there were a lot of options that came about one of the desire that we had is we want to always seek you first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you so wherever wherever we've considered the main our primary concern is that the environment were is one where we could continue to grow in Christ so when we when we looked at different areas the there were quite a few opportunities and the best one the best ones ended up being elsewhere the most most viable option being in Knoxville Tennessee but throughout the process Kristin and I we you know we kept asking the Lord for we actually had kind of developed love for for you all and being in this area and and we felt that this was this was a place where we we are growing it was truly our heart's desire to stay here for the season also when if you if you start that and if you go into actual practice that you're you're pretty much locked in for you know five years to a decade so it's it's a big time period that you that you commit to essentially so we we continued to pray this whole time that we we continued working with this opportunity in Tennessee and there were financially at work it was a very good one but there were a lot of legal you know legal courses you have to go through where they review and then they they bring back a contract and then you have your your attorney review and then get back with them and so there's a there's all this waiting and the whole time we were praying you know can we have another opportunity happen here or and or somewhere that we that we really felt was was where we wanted to be spiritually so during this time period brother Samuel was preaching a series of messages out of First Samuel where where Saul is is waiting for Samuel and the Philistines and he's gonna you know encounter the Philistines shortly and Saul ends up being if he frets in his mind and he he becomes impatient and that he acts without without out of order out of God's order so part of what I'm thankful for is that even though we weren't entirely comfortable with the opportunity I probably would have gone with it had it not been for His grace allowing further revisions to the contracts and everything to continue so but as as this process was continuing I I realized that there's a scripture in Philippians where be careful for nothing and I hadn't I realized even though I felt or I thought that I had committed my my ways to God I realized that there was a deeper level of trust that I hadn't come to yet and and there was one one of my one of the opportunities I had most hoped for that would work out here they ended up saying unfortunately it wouldn't work out this year and I remember just feeling very despondent about that not it was it was not not what I had wanted but as I was disappointed eventually I realized that you know what it's all in God's hands and and I kind of reached the place where between Saul and David the great difference was David had faith and he just had complete and utter trust in God and so when when I reached that place it was like you know what I know that I know it's gonna work out this was the last door I'd hoped for but whatever you know whatever is your will if I'm about to go to Tennessee I'll I'll go but even but I know that if it's your desire for us to stay here you can make away and that was on a Friday and I remember actually on Sunday brother brother bill came up and he said the Lord told me to tell you to keep the faith and that week and I ended up hearing rumors that something may actually be available they called a fellowship which is that was actually what I had originally planned to do this year or this coming year but it hadn't worked out just do a couple factors but but the next Monday I was supposed to receive the final contract to sign to go to Knoxville and that evening the contract still hadn't come I guess and they said I'm sorry our lawyer had one more revision or they still hadn't gone back to us so it'll probably be tomorrow and then that evening the director of a fellowship actually in the Cleveland area called me up and he said you know we actually do to some very unusual circumstances our fellowship opened up so we're we're thankful and I'm glad that God used it as a learning opportunity for me because I haven't reached you know and I thought I trusted him but I there was a deeper level I could reach and then you know he was faithful he knew our the desires of our heart and in fact we had committed I'm so thankful for God doing that and also for unusual circumstances don't that sound familiar [Laughter] praise God hey let's do of course I stay and redeemed by the blood of the Lamb but Matthew special forces were all right they get ready I stand ready by the blood of hostility for greater I know and he looks at me he sees the nail-scarred hands they're both my Liberty hoste a Michigan DNR stand routine has standard e-team by the blood of the lamb

you know what I don't feel like testifying and then like the Lord spoke to my heart testify and so here I am I get stage fright really easily and so you know I just not a stage person okay and so I I didn't praying this week and I was you know Laura what would she like for me to testify about I don't know and so as the week went by my baby really she had a really really high fever so just broke my heart and like you know what it's just a double attacking her you know just pray for her claim her healing she'll be well she'll be a well in the morning so you know now I went by two hours three hours four hours and she still wasn't well and so I was starting to get nervous like what's going on I heard she didn't better like you're you're like really really hot you're not getting disappearing and then so you know I got really frustrated this morning and and so you know I I try to you know get her to go back to sleep she wasn't sleeping like she kind of went it to like you know like a shock bow like she just you know she just got really still and she began to kind of felt in her arm to get it to roll back and it freaked me out cuz she was having a seizure and so I was really panicking I was like I had him please pray for her pray for her do something she's she's really stiff she's not moving she's motionless you know I just broke my heart we rushed to her to the ER and you know they were just doing all kinds of blood work on her and they just kept drawing blood from her and it was getting me so scared and nervous okay I was really really nerve wracking to see her throw all that crazy you know craziness because I was just you know she's gonna be alright I think it but then I guess she doesn't look alright because she beginning to kind of turn yellow and she was really pale and I was just crying lower please have mercy on her please have mercy on her please lower please heal her you said by your stripes we are healed and I just kept saying that again and again while I was in the ER just holding her lifeless stiff body okay I was really scared and so you know after you know much blood work and you know much cultivating and you know checkups and everything you know the doctor was like you know she doesn't look good I think I'm gonna have to you know draw some you know some some spinal fluid from her brain and so they wanted us to stick around a little longer for them to you know to do that to hurt I'm just like oh my lord no please don't do that and so I tell my husband let's keep praying for her keep praying her that the results would come back clear she doesn't have to go through this I just can't stand to see her you know and so we prayed and we just kept praying and praying you know like hours went by and you know the doctor came back and the doctor was like you know she you know her results came back and she doesn't look too bad I don't think we're gonna need to go to plan Plan C and draw fluids from her brain and I [Applause] really no no no you know just just stick around a little longer let's get her all cleared up make sure everything's good before we let you guys go oh my god it was a scary but it was such an it was such an empowering experience to me because I'm just being a new parent having all that parent syndrome new parents in the room it was such an amazing feeling you know just to walk out of there and just feeling confident that like you know God took care of everything just to keep us there overnight and maybe maybe for a whole week praise God we didn't have to you know you know go through all of that because you know I was you know my husband and I we we love coming into church and like you know you really wanted to be here for the testimony service and by the grace of God we made it tonight and we're just so so happy to be here and I have another testimony to like a couple months ago you know my husband and I we've been having a lot of problems with our little eating weenie little car we

even know which one if I've been I've been listening to other brothers I really appreciate brother testimony I know Brian since Brian was this this middle I came in 1989 89 from Puerto Rico and I was going through a lot of things in Puerto Rico I couldn't even explain why at the age of first of all let me say that I came to this church here me my wife it's been about a year or so we've been really happy and I thank you for the love that you showed us and really I feel like at the beginning when I first started I was my hello but now it's just like I've become one of you I really appreciate it thank you very much brother Carlos I mean he already said he went to Puerto Rico I was going through a lot of things there at the age of 16 I was 16 well my parents you know he kicked me out from the house I was living I don't know what to go I had no place to stay at the age of 16 imagine oh wow I didn't understand why then I dare say there was a family Torres family the radio stay my brother Willie so Billy - Billy Billy jr. he was there he was staying there by himself I remember there was a service when a Pentecostal church after a careful I used to play the guitar there I couldn't understand I mean why my dad the way he was acting sometimes we don't know the things that happen in our lives and and it sometimes we is the Lord working moving you know placing the stuff you know my home they are kicking me out from the house anyway I I was living with the village I was staying on that house on that year he decided come back over here to visit visit experience from it was his by the school break he came here and that's what they maybe Ricardo's birthday no Danny's here but anyway they went to Puerto Rico and I remember brother Carlos and one of the treachery was going I don't know where we was going brother Carlo but what color was in the front seat passenger and I was in the back and he was he was talking about the Lord but these things that I hear now the message thing he was talking I find I find I hear those things like kind of weird to me because I don't understand nothing and even he was talking about the baptism and I was asking the Lord because I was pretty Castille and I believe I pray so I was praying or chitchat his mouth please do not want to hear this stuff and the more was praying he was talking more and it wasn't working the prayers wasn't working dude I'm gonna I'm gonna pray again can you please shut his mouth Lord and he kept on talking talking I'm talking and I was I was a Pentecostal remember and and then he was talking about the Lord and I was listening and for some so for some reason he chose everything by the Bible by the scriptures and I I my heart even though I was in the denomination's I had a very sensitive heart for the Lord I was believing his world but nobody showed me the baptism the water baptism the way he proved to mean by these creatures and when I saw it here I just saw it that's a at the very place I used to go remember but Carlos have water right there beautiful I used to go there just just to have fun I died right there I remember right there he did a heap that I decided say yes I'm gonna go to the water a lot of people wasn't I agree with me because Father Son and Holy Ghost you know that's the name for them but through the wife while I find out that those three is just one the Lord Jesus Christ you know and they will try to put in my mind a lot of things when I came from Puerto Rico to here I was still you know I was new I don't remember one time I was gonna leave him go away how always remember that well ray Hernandez you talk I don't know if you remember he told me just give yourself time don't leave if he wasn't because of you brother I would have been back in Puerto Rico so let you know that that now so you know I never told you that so anyway I decided to stay here how did things went through my life a lot of things then one day I said father son holy God how can I understand that I want to see it I know I hear it but I believe it but I don't understand it and then one day one day I went to sleep our sprained is I start having a dream and the dream you was I was in one of the brother brands services and it was all full place where he was preaching and he has this question who of you in the audience believed it the Jesus is the Holy Spirit nobody really raised a him but I said I go like this yes me I was the only one and then when I lift up my hand I remember I felt back floor and I saw a light coming from heaven and it was a square light in front of my head my face and he was shining like this you know and then I was talking like a drunker and I was like praise Allah like a drunkard I wanted to talk but I couldn't I couldn't talk and that vindication right there since that day they showed me and I go wow it's more clear than the water and I was like wow it was a beautiful dream until today so that was it it's like for me I mean I know you hearing these things everyone has its own experience but me you know knowing the God is one and understanding with all my heart I just don't have it here I just have it here you know in my heart because somebody explained how the how the three are one a pastor do you know that oil the three or one oil you know the three this this is there's three but there's well the weirdest thing I ever hear my life and he will and then history explained in the hint in India he just he'd messed up he couldn't understand it cleaner and it's just leave a like I just praise the Lord I just wanna check I mean they stopped I mean how the Lord he got me from Puerto it the story is long but to patrol I mean the Lord has been really merciful with me because I don't deserve anything you know it's just like he said I don't deserve

strange something is different yeah I couldn't put my finger on and I'm trying to work and I think just keep going through my head and it's not been one evil thought and like I said who wants to be holding the only thing I can say I it it wasn't anything I'd done darling I can say that did too and we all did she says do this in remembrance of me and it lasted to the next day I didn't even know what was happening I mean I couldn't understand that scripture I mean you know you get a interpretation you have being your holder well you know the book says you and all that but you know I experienced it I mean I my supervisor he walked in the building I was at and I probably cried three or four times that morning just from their presence but he walks in he usually got always got something to say her straighten me out or something he walks in yes I mean I I couldn't really understand the scripture be holy it's just just even now without that feeling right there is kind of really hard to understand that but it's not in me and it's not at you mr. Lord he were special bless people I don't know of any other group of people who could ever ever she have a testimony like what we've got you know it's it's more than a denominational thing or a religious thing I'll just share something I had in fact I wanted to tell brother Humes I never got the chance but I was reading a message brother Bram said up he says you might think now the greatest gift to the church is Christ he says but it's not just the Holy Ghost he says jesus said whatever you say or do to me will be forgiven say one word against it and the reason I say we're special people is if you can't say that new denomination that he has come I mean you really can't grab ahold of what I just said that the greatest gift is the Holy Ghost you can have gifts the gifts won't change your life it takes that person it takes it takes the person the greatest gift this the Holy Ghost that's just you know I hope it helps somebody about you know because we all fight we all fight you know our flesh and the word says be holy I mean how do you even put that in place you just you really came but it's him he took you into himself and that's where it comes from and I just want to say ever since we had those special meetings I mean you know the we was talking about this man one feeling many reef fillings and stuff you know and you know nobody's perfect I ain't perfect nobody perfect you know and I I kind of sometimes you just sing a song and you just kind of go through the motions and it just kind of you know sing it and somebody else gets blessed you feel glad for them you know tells the song leader I look out and I'm not feeling so good and I see somebody else get blessed I'm just happy to see them get blessed you know but ever since we had these special meetings it feels like every single song that we're singing it's like every word in on every line there's just like poof popping out at me you know meaning something different than it's ever met before I just I just thank God for the refilling you know as a Christian thank God for the refilling of the Holy Ghost amen with some plastic I know the Lord has made for me I know the Lord has made a way just for me if I live holy Sh under all and to the right [Music] has made a way for me to get an alert view I can live a holy life I know Lowe has made a way for thank the Lord I know the law has made a way now I can live now I can live holy life I'll shut the road and I'll do the ride because I know the Lord has made Oh [Music] amen as they continue to play that song with anyone else ever if anyone else has testimony just a man's open floor time amen you didn't write it down you that you feel maybe somebody inspired you maybe their testimony inspired you you want to give a testimony little Lord bless you I just want to thank you all and I want to say thank you for your testimonies and brother bless me yeah so I'm I'm blessed with all of you and just wanted guys over here they bless me when I see him over here and my husband like he said we all go to banks and stuff like that Oh [Music] I just wanna give a little testimony on so they the Lord was dealing with being involved saying something I was fighting with her and I said I don't know I don't know I said no I don't know if I want to say it or I was praying and I said oh Lord I said what if you want me to say something when I have to tell me don't tell me something about it and then the brother said what I gift the Lord protect that gift in the church and you do you don't want them how are you you know you do with them what you want to do whatever you want to do with them so I say okay all right Lauren so I just want to say that how the Lord is the son it's here the Lord is here in there is an another testimony um I got a lot of supernatural things that the Lord is doing here and in the midst of us but I'm not gonna say more but um when the brother the brother the Lord was dealing with him in the back I I went to the back and when I was coming this way I just I grabbed teachers issues i ground two of those a night and I had to hang keys there so I grabbed him and I said I just grabbed them and so when I was when I was there then the brother was right there by me and it was just the Lord had those tissues for him so I just want to share that in them I also want to share also on another supernatural for him too there was a couple years I think before he started playing a guitar in the back I was sitting there and I started hearing that their music I started hearing a guitar music and I was so beautiful ready I'm I never you know it was so beautiful and I said I wonder if somebody could music in the back and then it was one brother Sammy was preaching after he preached they started talking that's when I started hearing their music and and nobody was playing and then after thereafter after dad and that's when I heard him and I said that's the music test that's how the music I heard it was his music so the Lord already he said he was going to trials and he's going through all this but the Lord was already come play for us so I just just wanna share those and I just want to thank you appreciate that you met anybody else god bless you Saints it's emotional you don't got me up Jason 2006 and I had been making trips off to New York helping my brother you know I doing something you know trips out to Dominican Republic that wouldn't work all these other places I know you and you the Lord was dealing with me because there was a void in my life that just couldn't be filled I had the love of my husband my family but there was just the point nothing made me happy anymore I knew that that time was coming and I also knew that my brother evil had been praying for me since like 1980 something that I would come serve the Lord I remember the day that I got baptized there were seven of us that got baptized only one planned baptism but I know as we came back for the second service I really you know I went up and I said okay in fact everybody had left the church everybody had left the church and they wind up calling everybody back because I decided that I was gonna get baptized so they filled up the tank and all that all I know is that five followed after that and there was a total of seven of us and I remember my brother he bought um you know I think that you know we never had to talk about the Baptism and everything and he had told me right when I had gotten into the baptismal he says Doris he says do you know what you're doing and I looked at him and I says I know that I'm not turning back I said there's no turning back even I know that so to make a long story short all these years have gone by in this last year it was trying to take care of my parents trying to do the right thing and God knows the look that I have for my parents because this has been going on for years with their care and I remember them and I believe it was like in January or December I got to the point where I just knew we couldn't do it anymore I was really battling and um and called brother Samuel few times and talked to him about it and everything cuz you know you want to know in your heart that you're doing the right thing and it's not the devil trying to talk you out of doing things you know and so um I called my brother he won and I said I can't do it anymore my heart wants to do it but my body's not like me do and you know I wind up going through high blood pressure I lost a tremendous amount of weight I mean oh that's any other time I'd be ecstatic I wasn't weak but when you're losing weight and you don't know why you're losing it you know it's not a good feeling you know because you know you're becoming sick so anyway um I you know my brother Yvonne I called them and I said I can't do it anymore he says well Doris he says you know then you know if I bring mom here then the other siblings you know um they won't be able to see mom they'll have to come down here and Isis law I don't know at this point I don't know what to tell you but you know mom's been living with me for a year nobody's come to see her so you know am I supposed to stopping everything I'm doing right now to consider them I said I can't I says because I can't take the risk of putting myself in the hospital and my children having to take care of me because I'm I suffered from a stroke or a heart attack or something so anyway um you know you've all agreed to take mom and I asked the Lord I said Lord if it's meant to be then mom if it's in your will that mom be with my brother you know with your son they don't allow everything to happen the way it's supposed to happen everything goes smoothly what you did so when it she came when I came back from New York I stayed seven days because I wanted to make sure she was adjusted and everything was gonna go okay I told her make my flight so I could change it if she's not adapting well then I'll stay longer you know because I was determined I wasn't gonna leave her if she wasn't happy so everything went smoothly everything I couldn't have asked for a better day you know her better week and everything went smoothly and I came home and it was like I couldn't I didn't even know what to do with my life I'm not complaining because I gave them everything I possibly cook but I did III knew in my heart that I did everything that I could but then I came home and I didn't know what to do with my life and I went to see my follow up with my doctor and he said Doris he sucks you know um how you been feeling and I said and I was crying sometimes I feel like I gotta go back to school or go get a job just to get my life started and he looked at me and he said Dorsey says lay back he says I'm gonna be your psychiatrist today he says and I'm wasn't gonna charge you he says but I'm thing you know he says going to get a job and going back to schools have been fix things he says your body needs rest he says you have to allow yourself to have some rest so then my husband had to go out for training up to Miami and the kids wanted me to go with him it was gonna be gone for two weeks I said that's a long time you know there was a time there Mark was taking me everywhere and I was gone you know week two weeks three weeks at a time and didn't think anything of it but have been so long since I had gone anywhere cuz I was afraid to go anywhere I didn't know if something was gonna happen the mom and I could get on a plane you know and get there on time you know so anyway um here I wound up going with him when I'm sitting there I'm sitting by the pole and I'm thinking to myself I says Lord how did I even get here how did I even get to this place Lord you know where I don't know what to do with my life and then I started thinking about how old I was it was four years ago you know where did four years ago I don't even know were four years but I think God because you know what you know the devil starts talking to you you know and you know you're a Miami Beach you know they've got all these bars and everybody you know jamming and everything else and I thought and that thought came to me there's no turning back there's no turning back 2006 I had told brother Samuel this a long time ago in 2006 I was so I was so lost in the world and I had been for so many years that when he told me from the ground he just pulled me from the ground he pulled me from the gutter he pulled me from the cover and when I think back and all the mercy you know and he gave me the faith gave me the hope to stand you know and I wonder how this last year I even made it through and I think to myself you know that was you God that was you you know and I thank God I thank God I think God for giving me the strength to stand even now you know and yes did I miss Thursday said I missed this but believe me I know where my heart was you know it was just rain sometimes you know and I'm just trying to find myself and it's like Lord you know without you without you I wouldn't be standing here you know and so you know I'm sitting there and I'm thinking to myself should I get with testimony or should I give a testimony shoot your show tonight because you know we all know that you give a testimony that was but you know what for me I owe all of you things and the Lord just because you know and and and to think that he brought that up back to me you know there's no turning back you know and it reminds me you know there's a reason there's reminders that come back at little things that happen you know and when I look back I was telling one of the sisters this morning I was telling you know that one of the biggest things that I think that I got get out of serving the Lord as how he's allowing me to look back at where I was for so many years so lost in the gutter and he reminds me he reminds me of where I was and where I am now and I thank the Lord for that I think I think there's just not enough thanks god is good he's so so so good anyone that ever prayed for me during this last year God knows thank you so much for your prayers and for keeping me with it's been wonderful to be here tonight give God thanks for all the beasts done I mean I remember I was just no brother to say he said sometimes the testimony service because sometimes God may not be doing something giant in your life right that at that moment but just seeing what God's doing in somebody else's life he's working in the body a man you can give God things you can rejoice but the same of the jebbie thing you were singing let's sing that song when I look round and see good things thus for me well I know [Music] but is blessings freely can't I own all my life to him I've got so much I've got and I've got so much they can for so much praise for will you see now he has been so good to me when I think what he's done and where that he broke me from I've got so much third verse I want to thank you I wanna thank him for letting me see this last state in time history and I know that my name is Oliver hold the seals they have been in it some may sue the body changeless I've got so much here for one more time I've got so much hand I've got so much thank you for so much rays yes being so good to me when I think one way oh this has been a wonderful time it's been a wonderful time amen I'm not gonna add to his testimony I'll wait and preach on it but you know the one thing I can tell you and I will say this right here is even in the midst of times of discouragement you still treat him as a son of God that's with everybody as a son of God and a daughter of God it's God that does the work and I'm so thankful to the Lord Jesus Christ I I know once said when I said I think I'm the happiest man in the world after last week and it wasn't just because of been you know I've been praying for Ben and we all both had a lot of many of you I think God I want to say this I really appreciate the discernment and the observation of the saints of God I really really appreciate that that touched me so much because what touch means that you could see it and you knew just take it to the Lord in prayer that's what touches me alone if ever is anything that I've strove for even in the gospel is that we take it to the Lord that's one thing I've strove for because he's the one that makes a difference in every situation and in every life well this got a little bit of juice on it Brian back this mind back a little bit I will close out on this we'll just ask a word of prayer and then Zack and I will sing a song and we'll will sing out of here so we come over here sometimes the boys they like coming over here with me sometimes and they come in here and they just have a jam session and they're up here singing and taking turns and of course acts up your singing - so we're just gonna sing I those of you know it was young people I'm not much of a practicer I just like to get up and sing I it makes me nervous when I think I have to sing a special or you know one time I had to sing at a wedding and then the brother said oh no bro Sammy you got to take it up right here and let it down right here that right there I'll guarantee I get that messed up when I go to sing that special just let me sing it how I sing it and they're matter-of-fact just let me just get up and just sing it I don't even need to practice it not that I'm good I just makes me nervous you know it just it just does but I know that I just so appreciate what the Lord is doing in our midst I I just love the Lord and I'm just so thankful amen I'm grateful to God amen for for his children I'm just glad to be a part of what what God is doing and I mean that with all my heart I I love you all not everybody's here tonight you know but I certainly I certainly love each and every one of you and I certainly hey you're my family that's just how it is you're my family my table was longer you come meet Ataturk but that's really how I feel and I mean that with all my heart that's why I said as a happiest man because of what God is seeing God answering prayers and when I was just praying you know with different needs and things like that that we've been praying for and I just see God just come on the scene and you know what a testament I could go on and on but we we I don't want to do that we'll know that it'll spill over and some of the messages to come but I just want to say I love you appreciate you in the Lord and I just love you so much and thank you I'm grateful you know that we have one another's back in the Lord I'm so glad about that amen I'm glad about that amen don't ever don't ever feel like that you have an insignificant part your part is just as vital as any other part in the body of Jesus Christ amen I believe that with all my heart so Zack and I are gonna sing a little song y'all know this song if you want to know where I'm going so you can you can stand with us before we before then crank set up there let's let's just offer the Lord a word of Prayer and then we'll just start singing you all want to go ahead and shake hands with one another that'll make me feel nothing less nervous so let's just let's just pray
