[34:28] my heart.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father.

[34:55] of my heart. Sing it again. Let your
[35:01] word [singing] be born.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; In the manger [music]
[35:07] of my heart,
[35:10] let it [singing] live.
[35:13] Let
[35:17] live [music and singing] inside this
[35:19] house of clay
[35:22] molded every day. [singing]
[35:27] Let your word be born
[35:30] in the manger [singing]
[35:33] of my heart. Could we sing it one more
[35:37] time?
[35:37] &gt;&gt; [music]
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Let [singing] your word
[35:40] be born
[35:42] in the [music] manger of my heart.
[35:47] Let it live in me. [singing]
[35:50] Let it start.
[35:53] [music] Oh, live inside this house of
[35:57] clay.
[35:59] Come hold it every day.
[36:03] And let your word be born
[36:07] in the manger [singing]
[36:09] of
[36:12] my heart.
[36:16] Praise the Lord Jesus. Let's just go to
[36:19] him in a word of prayer.
[36:22] Heavenly Father, how how thankful we
[36:25] are,
[36:26] Lord, for this moment.
[36:29] We're very thankful, dear God, for the
[36:31] real meaning of this time, this season.
[36:33] Lord, we're so thankful, dear God, that
[36:36] you came down to become one of us.
[36:39] That's the That's the beginning right
[36:41] there, Lord, that would bring about the
[36:44] pathway,
[36:46] Lord, that we can come into full
[36:49] fellowship with you. How we're so
[36:52] thankful, dear God. We so appreciate,
[36:55] Lord, your mercies, Lord. And father, as
[36:57] the words of that song has said,
[37:01] Lord, not only would our requests be
[37:03] that the word would be born in our
[37:05] hearts,
[37:07] but Lord,
[37:09] may we grow,
[37:11] &gt;&gt; may that life within us grow,
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, as we would yield and surrender,
[37:17] oh God, give us the grace, Lord, to know
[37:20] how to apply the word to our lives. But
[37:24] Lord, we can see Lord that which is
[37:26] truth and you will direct us to be able
[37:28] to see those things. But oh God, how we
[37:31] need
[37:32] &gt;&gt; the discernment in every situation for
[37:35] Lord, we want to be overcomers,
[37:39] &gt;&gt; oh God, and we know that Lord, it's the
[37:41] overcoming by your life that dwells
[37:44] within us, Lord. And then through there,
[37:48] Lord God, every battle that we face, the
[37:51] submitting, the emptying out of our
[37:53] lives and the submitting, Lord, that our
[37:55] character might be so molded,
[37:58] &gt;&gt; oh God, to your image is reflected
[38:01] perfectly.
[38:03] Oh father, may you just, oh God, take
[38:06] every one of us here this morning, Lord,
[38:09] in your hands. May you minister, Lord,
[38:11] very personally, Lord, to each and every
[38:13] need. You know, Lord, and Father, we
[38:16] just commit ourselves into your hands,
[38:19] Lord. We thank you and we love you in
[38:22] the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[38:25] Amen. And amen.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:29] Amen. If you would um turn with me in
[38:32] Ecclesiastes chapter 3, [clears throat]
[38:35] uh
[38:37] I'm gonna read you a little quote before
[38:39] I get started here. Um just listened to
[38:42] this early early this morning and um
[38:47] always always I love brother Ram's
[38:48] balance and approach with these things.
[38:51] He says it's always good to come to the
[38:53] house of the Lord
[38:55] &gt;&gt; but much better it seems like in the
[38:57] Christmas and New Year's and holy days
[39:00] &gt;&gt; seems like it has a special little
[39:02] blessing left for us. It's just too bad
[39:05] we can't have this Christmas feeling all
[39:07] the time. people waving at you and
[39:09] saying the Lord bless you, that's good.
[39:11] That's one thing I like about Christmas.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, uh, if I don't get a
[39:17] chance to as the service comes, I want
[39:19] to wish every one of you a merry
[39:20] Christmas. Amen. May God bless you
[39:23] richly. Amen. During Amen. during during
[39:26] this time. And uh, so we want to just
[39:29] take here uh, a look here in the
[39:31] scripture. I want to say God bless you,
[39:32] brother Brian. You and Sister Gracie.
[39:35] Amen. And uh so we also want to remember
[39:38] I I don't think that it was wrote down
[39:41] um we had put it on the text thread
[39:44] about brother brother Danny Lewis. He's
[39:45] still in the Cleveland Clinic um with
[39:48] the pneumonia, the flu and uh his his
[39:51] sugar was really really bad the other
[39:53] day on top of everything. And that's why
[39:55] we sent that text out on Friday. And so
[39:57] we were just um texting back and forth
[40:00] here um this morning. So, just please
[40:02] let's remember him in prayer as well.
[40:05] And um also know sister Caroline, she's
[40:08] on her way to Costa Rica. And so, uh we
[40:11] just pray God just really just blesses
[40:13] her time and the flights going down
[40:15] there. I also want to say thank you.
[40:17] When I I came in there, um I appreciate
[40:20] the gifts. I did not even we did not uh
[40:23] uh tear into them. So, whoever is
[40:26] responsible for that, God bless you.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Uh next Sunday, I'll I'll be looking for
[40:30] something different.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[40:32] &gt;&gt; There you go. There you go.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; You know, it's like brother Brandon when
[40:36] brother Brandham would talk about it, he
[40:37] said, "Oh," he says, "I would just like
[40:39] a kid looking around the Christmas tree
[40:40] on the morning." You know, and and so,
[40:43] you know, he was just uh he was so so
[40:46] just so precious. So, I want to say
[40:47] thank you. God bless you. Amen. And um
[40:50] but let's look here in the word in
[40:52] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse one and
[40:55] verse 5.
[40:57] To everything there is a season and a
[41:01] time to every purpose under the heaven.
[41:06] A time to cast away stones and a time to
[41:09] gather stones together.
[41:12] A time to embrace and a time to refrain
[41:17] from embracing.
[41:19] So everything has its season and its
[41:23] time and its purpose and it's not
[41:27] contradictory. It's just finding the
[41:29] season that we're in
[41:32] &gt;&gt; and what what is to be applied within
[41:35] that season. And so when you you could
[41:36] read through the whole chapter, which no
[41:38] doubt as a Bible reader, you'd be
[41:39] familiar with, there's there's always
[41:41] that a time to cast away stones and
[41:44] times together them. Um when the time to
[41:46] cast them away is when it would come
[41:49] against your brother. The time to gather
[41:51] them is when you when you're facing the
[41:54] enemy.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; So there's there's the right time.
[41:56] There's a time to embrace and a time to
[41:59] refrain from embracing. Let loose of
[42:01] things, forsake it, and embrace what's
[42:04] what's true. Absolutely.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; So with all of this, when this comes
[42:08] down, there's one thing that's a real
[42:11] key point is that it we require the
[42:14] discernment of the Holy Spirit.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; And so we certainly need God's God's
[42:18] discernment in our lives every day. And
[42:21] that's what the message of the hour has
[42:22] brought back to us, the discernment of
[42:25] the spirit. That brought it right back
[42:27] into the church to discern the word and
[42:30] discern that the word is true. Amen. So
[42:33] you may be seated. God bless his word.
[42:35] As you are being seated, I want to speak
[42:38] on this thought. Embracing deity.
[42:41] Embracing deity.
[42:44] When you take the word uh embrace, it
[42:49] means obviously to hold someone closely
[42:54] in one's arms. It's a sign as a sign of
[42:56] affection.
[42:58] It is also to accept or support um a
[43:03] belief or something willingly and
[43:07] enthusiastically.
[43:08] That's what it is to embrace. And we
[43:10] know we want to be uh found on the right
[43:14] side and embracing the right thing. We
[43:17] want to be found embracing deity,
[43:20] embracing the word of God in our bosom
[43:23] because that's what will change our
[43:25] life. And it it continues to change our
[43:27] lives. The more as God will reveal
[43:30] himself, the more then it leads us to
[43:32] empty out and the more that God steps in
[43:35] and that there's overcoming grace in our
[43:37] lives. And so I want to read just to lay
[43:40] a few scriptures as we're coming into
[43:42] this place here and looking here in the
[43:45] scriptures in John 14 where the Lord
[43:48] Jesus he really begins to lay in the
[43:52] focus of what is to come the purpose
[43:55] even in the ministry and and where the
[43:57] Holy Spirit is to is to uh come in after
[44:02] that of Calvary. I don't want just let
[44:03] me read just a few places in scripture.
[44:06] Philip said unto him,"Lord, show us the
[44:08] Father, and it sufficeth us." And Jesus
[44:12] said unto him, "Have I been so long time
[44:15] with you, and yet hast thou not known
[44:18] me, Philillip?
[44:20] He that hath seen me hath seen the
[44:23] Father, and how sayest thou then, show
[44:26] us the Father?" I want you to just take
[44:29] even just looking in that first few part
[44:31] there. What grace have I been with you
[44:34] so long a time and you've not known me?
[44:38] &gt;&gt; They they could recognize
[44:41] there's something different. Remember,
[44:42] brother Brandham said they would see and
[44:44] they would they would hear him speak and
[44:46] they would ponder and they would wonder
[44:48] and yet then they would look and say,
[44:50] "Well, this is this is different. No one
[44:52] has has spoke like this." and the
[44:54] miracles and all that was they were
[44:57] seeing taking place that it was it was
[44:59] something that they could not explain
[45:01] fully but yet how that the grace of God
[45:04] and I want to say that even to our own
[45:06] lives that sometimes a person or an
[45:09] individual can set around where the
[45:12] father is being revealed for some time.
[45:15] Your family can see the father being
[45:17] revealed for some time. That's so good
[45:20] &gt;&gt; because remember it's a portion of our
[45:22] heavenly father that comes to dwell
[45:24] inside of us to reflect his life. He is
[45:27] the vine. We're the branches.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; And so within this how how have I been
[45:33] with you so long and yet thou hast not
[45:35] known and recognized? Because we
[45:37] understand that there's many times when
[45:39] people will come and they'll ask you
[45:41] where do you go to church or what do you
[45:42] believe? And they're they're asking to
[45:44] try to fit you, categorize you and and
[45:46] what is it? And because there's
[45:47] something that's that's different and
[45:49] they realize there's something different
[45:50] about your life. It's even when when
[45:52] people would come here into the church,
[45:54] they they come into a service, they
[45:56] don't know they don't realize what
[45:59] exactly is, but there's something that's
[46:00] different than what they've experienced
[46:02] before.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; It's not music. It's not it's not
[46:05] people, but it's the Holy Ghost himself.
[46:08] And there's a there's a presence about
[46:10] it that even though that they may not
[46:12] fully understand at that time or at that
[46:14] moment, it might be months, it might be
[46:16] years, whatever the time is until
[46:19] finally that revelation drops like it
[46:21] did with Sarah. Sarah didn't catch what
[46:24] was going on at the time. But remember
[46:26] the prophet said in that quote, he says,
[46:28] uh, some of you are disagreeing with
[46:30] this right now. He said, but I can see
[46:32] further than you. And one of he says,
[46:35] "And I can see one of these days you're
[46:37] going to be believing it."
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; That's the grace of God. So when we look
[46:42] at this, have I been so long a time with
[46:44] you, yet hast thou not known me? Uh
[46:47] Philillip, he that hath seen me hath
[46:50] seen the father. And how sayest thou
[46:52] then showest the father? Believest thou
[46:55] not that I am in the father, and the
[46:57] father in me? The words that I speak
[47:00] unto you, I speak not of myself, but the
[47:03] Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
[47:07] works. Believe me that I am in the
[47:09] Father and the Father in me. Or else
[47:12] believe me for the very work's sake. So
[47:15] the the works, as the prophet would say
[47:17] it like this, and taking that up, he put
[47:19] emphasis on his own works while on
[47:22] earth. and the works that he did were
[47:24] ordained of God to inspire faith in him.
[47:29] So the the very the very manifestation
[47:33] of God's word because we realize that
[47:37] where the sick were healed my there was
[47:39] just you know there had been miracles
[47:41] throughout you know with there of the
[47:43] within the prophets and and different
[47:45] ones down through the time but never a
[47:47] man spake like this. Never had never had
[47:50] there been anything like this with this
[47:53] with this miraculous and ministry. But
[47:56] it's the promise that God made that he
[47:58] would raise up a prophet like unto Moses
[48:01] from among your brethren. And so we we
[48:04] see that the works itself was was that
[48:08] which was in complete uh unity and
[48:11] fulfillment with the word of God because
[48:14] when inspiring faith in him who is the
[48:17] word, it's inspiring the the the the
[48:20] faith in the promise that God has for
[48:23] you. Because when God begins to reveal
[48:26] himself, God is not, remember the
[48:29] prophet will take us through this all
[48:30] through the message that he said Jesus
[48:33] does not clown for anybody.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; He doesn't show off. He doesn't have to
[48:38] prove himself. The devil tried to get
[48:40] him into that. He he did not have to
[48:42] prove himself. He stayed with the
[48:45] father's word. And so within this that
[48:48] he was walking right in step with that
[48:51] word. And then that that fulfillment of
[48:54] that word is what would actually to
[48:57] inspire the faith of the believers in
[49:01] his life. I mean think about the men.
[49:03] Think about the disciples that were
[49:05] called from their ways of life. Friends,
[49:08] these would have these were not who's
[49:10] who of society.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Are are you with me? These were not uh
[49:15] church members that had five stars on
[49:17] their apron.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? These were people that
[49:21] were the the offcower. These were indivi
[49:25] IN OTHER WORDS THESE ARE THE KIND OF
[49:26] PEOPLE THAT we can go without spending
[49:29] all the time that that that no one would
[49:32] have even given them a chance.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; But you see they were in God's mind the
[49:37] whole time.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; And so when God he COMES DOWN THINK
[49:42] ABOUT WHAT LIFE Matthew is called from
[49:44] being a tax collector. Peter and and and
[49:48] his brethren called from being
[49:49] fishermen. They I mean they don't they
[49:51] didn't just do this for a living. They
[49:53] enjoyed what they did.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; They were good at it.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE WAS something that that took A
[50:00] HOLD OF THEIR LIFE, ANDREW'S LIFE,
[50:01] BARTHOLOMEW'S LIFE. SOMETHING WAS BEING
[50:05] REAL TO THEM THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM GRACE
[50:08] TO FORSAKE THE THINGS THAT THEY ONCE
[50:12] HELD TO OR WHAT WOULD BRING THEM
[50:14] SATISFACTION. RIGHT.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS DOING THAT? IT WAS THE EFFECT
[50:21] OF THE WORD BEING REVEALED, THE PROMISE
[50:24] OF THE HOUR. AND THEY WERE A PART OF IT.
[50:27] THEY DIDN'T FULLY KNOW IT. THEY DIDN'T
[50:28] UNDERSTAND IT. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
[50:30] GOING ON. But it's JUST LIKE A MAGNET
[50:33] ATTRACTING something that is magnetized
[50:35] TO IT. IT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT FORCE
[50:38] FIELD, BUT THERE IS A POWER THAT IS
[50:40] BEING EXERTED upon it. AND THAT'S THE
[50:43] SAME WAY THIS WORD HAS AND DOES HAVE
[50:45] UPON OUR LIFE. IT IS A POWER, A
[50:48] SUPERNATURAL POWER. IF I CAN SAY IT LIKE
[50:50] THIS, IT'S A DEFINED FREQUENCY OF THE
[50:53] WORD. WHAT FREQUENCY AM I TALKING ABOUT?
[50:55] THE SAME FREQUENCY THAT SAID, "LET there
[50:58] be IN THE BEGINNING." GOD HAS BROUGHT
[51:01] THE CHURCH BACK IN TUNE AND IN LINE WITH
[51:04] the original seed with his original
[51:06] word.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; John 14:1 15. If you love me,
[51:14] keep my commandments,
[51:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:17] &gt;&gt; And I will pray the Father, and he shall
[51:20] give you another comforter, that he may
[51:22] abide with you forever.
[51:25] Even the Spirit of truth,
[51:28] whom the world cannot receive, because
[51:31] it seeth him not, neither knoweth him.
[51:35] Now watch this. But you know him,
[51:38] &gt;&gt; FOR HE DWELLETH WITH YOU.
[51:41] and shall be in you.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; See, the transition must go from with
[51:48] &gt;&gt; to in.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE REMEMBER, BROTHER RAM TELLS US
[51:51] JUST TO BE AROUND WHERE IT'S AT IS TO
[51:54] MAKE YOURSELF WORSE.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[51:58] &gt;&gt; HE HE TELLS US WE'RE NOT JUST TO COME
[52:00] TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT THE MESSAGE,
[52:03] &gt;&gt; to get into it.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Right? So within YOU SAY, WELL, SETTING
[52:08] AROUND IT, HOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF
[52:09] WORSE? IF IF A PERSON IS JUST SITTING
[52:12] AROUND AND THERE'S NO THERE'S NO
[52:14] ANCTIONIZING, THERE'S no uh
[52:18] STIRRING EVEN WITHIN THEIR HEART. AND
[52:20] listen friends, I I'm looking at the
[52:22] grace of God here, even in the word of
[52:24] God that I BELIEVE THAT GOD is the one
[52:27] who is mindful to stir our hearts that
[52:30] even when we would get lazy, even when
[52:33] things THAT THE ENEMY WOULD BOMBARD THE
[52:36] MIND, THE ENEMY WANTS TO SET TRAPS. HE
[52:38] WANTS TO TRY TO BRING DISTRACTIONS WHEN
[52:41] SATAN SEES THAT A PERSON IS GETTING
[52:44] READY TO BELIEVE. HOW MANY TIMES BROTHER
[52:46] RANDOM SAID RIGHT IN THE MEETING HOW
[52:48] SATAN WOULD WANT TO COME AND TRY TO
[52:50] AFFLICT. WHY? HE IS AFRAID WHEN A
[52:53] BELIEVER BEGINS TO BELIEVE. HE'S
[52:56] POWERLESS. [cheering]
[52:59] &gt;&gt; HE'S POWERLESS. THAT'S WHY HE PUTS SO
[53:01] MANY DIFFERENT DISTRACTIONS BECAUSE AS
[53:03] SOON AS YOU BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT WORD
[53:06] AND ACCEPT THAT WORD, THAT WORD HAS
[53:09] DYNAMIC POWER [screaming] WITHIN IT TO
[53:12] ACHIEVE AND BRING FORTH IN YOUR LIFE.
[53:15] [cheering]
[53:16] [applause]
[53:18] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I'M WITH YOU." BUT THAT'S
[53:19] NECESSARY. HE HAD TO BE WITH US. HE HAD
[53:22] TO BECOME ONE OF US. AMEN.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY TO ENTER INTO THE PROMISE
[53:27] OF GOD WITHOUT [screaming]
[53:29] FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE PROMISE HIMSELF.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY THAT A PERSON CANNOT SAY,
[53:35] "WELL, I RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST IN THE
[53:37] PENTECOSTAL CHURCH." YOU MIGHT HAVE
[53:39] RECEIVED THE BAPTISM, BUT YOU NEVER
[53:40] RECEIVED THE WORD BIRTH. YOU HAVE GOT TO
[53:43] FELLOWSHIP WITH THE REVEALED WORD TO BE
[53:46] BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD BECAUSE
[53:49] THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH
[53:51] AND HE LEADS AND GUIDES you into all
[53:53] truth.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; HE DWELLETH WITH you and shall be you.
[54:00] I'm so thankful for that.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; I'm grateful. LISTEN, GOD KNEW he didn't
[54:04] cut the messengers. He didn't cut
[54:06] brother Ram's time too short.
[54:09] It wasn't, oh, he he he needed to PREACH
[54:11] THIS. IT WAS ALL LAID OUT WHAT WE HAVE
[54:13] NEED OF.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE HAS, LET ME JUST SAY IT LIKE
[54:19] THIS, LIKE THE PROPHET SAID, "And on the
[54:21] wings of a SNOW WHITE DOVE, THE MESSAGE
[54:23] HAS GOT THROUGH. IT'S COME INTO THE
[54:26] CAMP." AND THE MESSAGE IS THE HOLY
[54:28] GHOST, THE DOVE, THE EVENING LIGHT, THE
[54:31] TOKEN.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; IT'S CHRIST HIMSELF. IT HAS COME INTO
[54:35] THE CAMP. AMEN.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; SURE, there's a great battle on, but the
[54:39] Bible says when the enemy comes in like
[54:41] a flood, I the Lord will raise a
[54:43] standard against him.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; And that standard is Christ in you.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; It gives you confidence. God's listen,
[54:50] God's revealing is to give you
[54:53] confidence in the promise for your life.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Watch this. I will not leave you
[55:00] comfortless. I will come to you. These
[55:02] things have I spoken unto you, being
[55:04] present with you. But the comforter,
[55:07] which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
[55:10] will send in my name, notice, send in my
[55:12] name, in the revealed word, in the
[55:15] character, he shall teach you all things
[55:18] and bring all things to your remembrance
[55:20] whatsoever I have said unto you. John
[55:24] 16, he also goes in John 15 as well. How
[55:27] be it, when he, the Spirit of truth, is
[55:29] come, he will guide you into all truth.
[55:32] For he shall not speak of himself, but
[55:34] whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he
[55:36] speak, and he will show you things TO
[55:38] COME. SO, HOW DO I KNOW THAT THAT IS THE
[55:40] TRUE SPIRIT OF GOD? CUZ IT WILL NEVER
[55:44] GLORIFY THE vessel it's working through.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THAT THE PROPHET SAID WITH
[55:50] SIGNS AND WONDERS THAT COME, I WANT TO
[55:52] HEAR THE VOICE THAT'S BEHIND IT. AMEN.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; WHERE IS THAT VOICE TRYING TO TAKE ME
[55:57] TO?
[55:59] &gt;&gt; IF IT'S TAKING ME BACK TO SOMETHING IN
[56:01] THE PAST THAT IS NOT THE PROPHET SAID IT
[56:03] LIKE THIS, THAT DIDN'T COME FROM GOD.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; THE THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL ALWAYS ALWAYS
[56:12] GLORIFY THE WORK OF THE LORD JESUS
[56:15] CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT IT DOES IN YOUR
[56:17] LIFE. IT GLORIFIES THE REDEEMING AND
[56:20] ATONING WORK BY IT BY GOD HIMSELF TAKING
[56:24] THE UPPERMOST SEA BY THE NEW BIRTH AND
[56:26] REFLECTING THROUGH YOUR LIFE THAT HE IS
[56:30] THE LORD OF ALL YOUR LIFE. HE'S THE
[56:32] LORD. HE'S OVERCOME IN EVERY AREA OF
[56:35] YOUR LIFE. HE'S THE LORD OF YOUR
[56:36] ATTITUDE, THE LORD OF YOUR EMOTION. HE'S
[56:39] THE LORD OF YOUR NATURE. HE IS THE LORD
[56:41] OF LORDS.
[56:44] [applause and cheering]
[56:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; LET ME GO BACK one one scripture here
[56:51] that verse 17. I WANT TO JUST capitalize
[56:53] here. Whom the world cannot receive.
[56:57] Now think ABOUT THIS IN THE SAME
[56:58] CHAPTER.
[57:00] Have I been so long with you, Philip?
[57:03] &gt;&gt; You haven't known me.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; But you see, there was an awareness that
[57:07] there was something there WAS THERE WAS
[57:09] THAT PART THAT WAS ABOUT THEM THEY WERE
[57:11] GOING TO COME TO. BUT THEY HAD NOT COME
[57:14] TO THAT UNDERSTANDING AS OF YET.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; BUT LISTEN, GOD'S NOT REQUIRING
[57:21] UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INSPIRATION
[57:23] hasn't dropped for.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GRACE ACCOMPANIES THE WORD TO
[57:28] OPEN OUR EYES.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE WALKING RIGHT WITH THE WORD.
[57:32] THEY FISHED WITH IT. THEY ATE WITH IT.
[57:34] THEY SLEPT AROUND THE WORD. THEY THEY
[57:36] THEY WERE RIGHT THERE WITH THE WORD.
[57:37] WHAT BETTER PLACE TO BE? LET ME TELL
[57:39] YOU, WHAT BETTER PLACE FOR OUR FAMILIES
[57:41] TO BE? WHAT BETTER PLACE FOR THAT TO BE
[57:43] IN YOUR LIFE AND IN YOUR HOME FOR THE
[57:45] WORD TO BE PRESENT AND LET THE WORD
[57:48] FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LIVES OF YOUR
[57:50] FAMILY?
[57:53] &gt;&gt; THEY NEED TO SEE THE WORD.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, I love that. I love that
[58:02] so much.
[58:04] So,
[58:05] let me have one final portion here of
[58:08] scripture.
[58:10] Jesus here in John 17 just one chapter
[58:13] after another neither pray I for these
[58:16] alone but for them also which shall
[58:19] believe on me through their word
[58:23] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them
[58:25] &gt;&gt; that's good
[58:26] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[58:27] &gt;&gt; this intercessory prayer you say where
[58:29] did this intercessory prayer it reaches
[58:31] clear back to the lamb's book of life
[58:35] &gt;&gt; hallelujah this IS WHAT THE WORD MADE
[58:37] FLESH is calling for
[58:39] &gt;&gt; is that right I love Now, I love how
[58:41] Brother Ram says it at the end of
[58:42] indictment. He says, "Lord," he says, "I
[58:45] I'm asking." He said that they said
[58:47] before the going away, there'll be such
[58:49] a revival that is poured out AMONG THE
[58:52] ELECT. HE SAID, "IT'S NOT HARD TO ASK
[58:54] THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE
[58:56] PROMISED."
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And we understand that. WE'VE ALREADY
[58:59] WATCHED THE GEESE. WE'VE WATCHED THE
[59:01] BIRDS. THEY HAVE A REVIVAL BEFORE their
[59:03] migration.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS BROUGHT US. WE'VE NOT BEEN
[59:08] ASSEMBLED TO ANY MAN. WE'VE BEEN
[59:10] ASSEMBLED UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE
[59:13] HOLY SPIRIT, THE REVEALED WORD OF THE
[59:15] HOUR, THE SON OF [screaming] MAN.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED UNDER CHRIST. MY
[59:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT A PRIVILEGE.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT IT. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
[59:28] ONE WHO TURNED THE WATER INTO WINE. I'M
[59:30] TALKING ABOUT THE ONE WHO TOOK A LITTLE
[59:33] LAD'S LUNCH AND HE FED A 5,000. WHAT
[59:35] ABOUT IN YOUR LIFE? WHAT ABOUT IN YOUR
[59:37] HOME? HE IS GOD, THE [screaming]
[59:39] CREATOR. HE KNOWS HOW TO TURN YOUR
[59:41] CHILDREN'S HEARTS. HE KNOWS HOW TO MELT
[59:44] DOWN THE WILL OF A SPOUSE. WE'RE
[59:46] [screaming] TALKING ABOUT LIVING UNDER
[59:48] THE PRESENCE OF THE SON OF MAN.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND
[59:54] FOREVER.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; We are his witnesses.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; That they may be one
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; as thou, Father, art in me. and I in
[1:00:07] thee, that they also may be one in us,
[1:00:09] that the world may believe that thou
[1:00:12] hast sent me. And the glory which thou
[1:00:15] gavest me, I have given them,
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; that they may be one, even as we are
[1:00:22] one, I in them, thou in me, that they
[1:00:26] may be made perfect and one, that the
[1:00:29] world may know that thou has sent me and
[1:00:32] hast loved them
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; as thou has loved me. Hallelujah.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; See, when the Holy Spirit is come, it
[1:00:40] shows the same degree of love that was
[1:00:44] for the son.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Like, like, you
[1:00:49] know, I love you know, you love
[1:00:51] children, but you don't love children
[1:00:52] the same way you love your own.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; That this is simple. That that's the
[1:00:58] same thing. God so loved the world, but
[1:01:00] God the degree for the elect, it
[1:01:03] surpasses. Amen.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; But but STILL I I REJOICE IN THAT GOD SO
[1:01:07] LOVED the world.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; I REGRET I'M SO GRATEFUL that the
[1:01:11] elective LOVE OF GOD BEING POURED OUT
[1:01:13] UPON THE ELECT OF GOD that was truly if
[1:01:17] you get TO LOOKING AT IT the elect.
[1:01:19] REMEMBER THE PROPHET STRESSED THIS HE
[1:01:21] SAID ESAU WAS A MUCH better man than
[1:01:26] Jacob.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; That's before the Holy Ghost came.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; I said that's before the HOLY GHOST
[1:01:32] CAME. MORALLY SPEAKING, MY THE scales
[1:01:36] were tipped, man, in Esau's FAVOR. THAT
[1:01:39] GUY HAD SUCH HIGH MORALITY AND HE WAS
[1:01:42] SO, you know, UH JUST MAN, JUST RIGHT
[1:01:45] ON, MAN, WITH EVERYTHING. BUT WHEN THE
[1:01:47] HOLY GHOST CAME THAT was different,
[1:01:50] brother,
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; that changed Jacob.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; IT BROUGHT A PRINCE OUT OF HIS LIFE. IT
[1:01:56] TOOK A SHYER AND A DECEIVER. IT TOOK A
[1:01:59] MAN THAT, YOU KNOW, THE WAY THAT HE WAS
[1:02:01] IN HIS LIFE. WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE?
[1:02:03] THE HOLY GHOST, THE PROMISE, THE
[1:02:05] BIRTHRIGHT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. AND LET
[1:02:08] ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. IT WASN'T
[1:02:09] ENOUGH THAT HE HAD THE BIRTHIGHT. HE HAD
[1:02:12] TO BECOME ONE WITH THAT BIRTHRIGHT.
[1:02:16] [cheering and applause]
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; HE WALKED WITH THE BIRTHRIGHT AND
[1:02:19] DECEIVED his father-in-law.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME NOW?
[1:02:25] THIS IS WHY IT CAN'T JUST BE WITH OR
[1:02:29] AROUND WHERE THE MESSAGE IS AT.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS THE PERSON OF JESUS
[1:02:35] CHRIST. YOU HAVE TO GET IN HIM
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU CAN WALK AROUND WHERE IT'S AT.
[1:02:42] AND THE SAME NATURE IS STILL THERE AND
[1:02:44] YOU'RE STILL GOING ABOUT DOING THE SAME
[1:02:46] THINGS STILL THE SAME WAY THAT YOU
[1:02:48] ALWAYS. OF COURSE MAY BE MORE RELIGIOUS,
[1:02:50] ABLE TO QUOTE SCRIPTURES, ABLE TO DO
[1:02:53] THIS AND ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT STILL THE
[1:02:55] NATURE OF THE WORLD IS STILL THERE
[1:02:58] BECAUSE EVEN LISTEN ONE OF THE WAYS THAT
[1:03:00] Satan tempts the people the prophet said
[1:03:03] in Satan's Eden is with intellectualism.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; But this is the powerful thing. When God
[1:03:17] comes into our life, God takes control.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; It ain't about our smarts.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; You may not even be able to pronounce
[1:03:25] certain words.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; You may not know the definition to a
[1:03:30] certain word.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; That don't make you any more of a
[1:03:33] believer, any less of a believer.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; The Bible says study to study to debate.
[1:03:39] No, it says study to show thyself
[1:03:42] approved. It means a relationship with
[1:03:45] God.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Where you're taking the word in and
[1:03:48] feeding on it.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Not studying it just to pivot.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; That's not a relationship.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; So embracing
[1:03:59] deity. Embracing deity. When when Jesus
[1:04:02] spoke this in John 17, the disciples had
[1:04:06] WALKED WITH HIM, yet they were still not
[1:04:08] one with him. Right?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And the only way they could become one
[1:04:11] with him would be through his life
[1:04:13] coming into them through the sacrificial
[1:04:15] offering of his own life. Now I want you
[1:04:18] to think in Luke 24 you find even prior
[1:04:22] to Luke 24 I mean you know Peter said
[1:04:25] LORD I WILL DIE for you.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; I'm embracing this. I WILL DIE FOR YOU.
[1:04:32] Jesus said before the
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; crows three times.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; You'll deny me. I want you to listen
[1:04:39] very carefully. Peter took his own
[1:04:42] feelings of his own heart above what the
[1:04:44] word was saying about his heart.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Can I repeat that?
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Peter took his own feelings
[1:04:53] about his own heart above what the word
[1:04:55] was discerning in his heart.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, search me.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Search me.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Search me, Lord.
[1:05:08] And here they we understand the
[1:05:09] scripture smite the shepherds scattered
[1:05:11] the sheep. BUT NOTICE THEY THEY WENT
[1:05:13] BACK TO THEIR FISHING. THEY WENT BACK TO
[1:05:15] everything they had been doing. I mean
[1:05:16] they WERE DISHEARTENED. BROTHER JOY. IT
[1:05:18] WAS LIKE THEIR IT WAS LIKE THEIR LIFE
[1:05:19] WAS RIPPED OUT.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET CALLED IT BEWILDERED.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; WE JUST KIND OF WALKING AROUND in a
[1:05:25] days.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; We've all been there with different
[1:05:28] things that didn't happen OR DIDN'T GO
[1:05:30] HOW WE THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS EVEN
[1:05:34] WHERE uh of different calculations and
[1:05:38] predictions and this and that. IT HASN'T
[1:05:40] HAPPENED THE WAY THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT
[1:05:42] FIGURED OUT BECAUSE GOD'S NOT INTERESTED
[1:05:44] THAT WE HAVE THINGS figured out.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO TRUST HIM AND WALK BY
[1:05:51] FAITH.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; MOSES COULD NOT REMEMBER WHAT THE
[1:05:54] PROPHET SAY. IF MOSES WOULD HAVE EVEN
[1:05:57] TOOK one of those leaves and tried to
[1:05:59] analyze it, his even his motive in doing
[1:06:03] that would have shut down the
[1:06:04] supernatural
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WASN'T ABOUT ANALYZING.
[1:06:09] THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT HAD BEEN HIS
[1:06:10] PROBLEM ALL ALONG. THAT'S WHY HE ONLY
[1:06:12] DEFEATED ONE STINKING EGYPTIAN BECAUSE
[1:06:15] IT WAS AN ANTILITICAL
[1:06:17] WAY TO HIM. HE KNEW THE PROMISE, BUT NOW
[1:06:20] HE NEEDED TO MEET THE PROMISE HIMSELF.
[1:06:23] [screaming] THE GOD WHO MADE THAT
[1:06:25] PROMISE AND WHEN HE GOT WITH THAT GOD
[1:06:28] THEN GOD GOT IN HIM.
[1:06:32] [cheering]
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID WHEN JUST
[1:06:34] THAT MOMENT THERE GOD ALREADY HAD THE
[1:06:37] EQUIPMENT IN MOSES he only needed that
[1:06:39] moment to light it off.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in Luke 24 here the great arms
[1:06:47] of the Lord Jesus of deity himself
[1:06:50] reaches out and begins to draw them back
[1:06:53] in through the fulfillment of the
[1:06:56] promised word.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; They're drawn from their bewilderment,
[1:07:00] drawn from their disappointment. We
[1:07:02] thought, we thought, I thought, we
[1:07:04] thought. They're drawn from that. And
[1:07:06] the word is there just to set them in
[1:07:10] motion.
[1:07:12] And they embrace that promise of the
[1:07:14] fulfillment of the message. I love it.
[1:07:17] Even with Peter said, "Go tell Peter.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; He's going to need his name personally
[1:07:26] mentioned because he's going to be
[1:07:28] feeling lower."
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; The others walked away. But but you
[1:07:34] know, Peter, you know,
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; SO HE SAID, "GO TELL PETER AS WELL." YOU
[1:07:40] SEE, WHAT WAS THE WORD DOING? IT WAS
[1:07:43] GATHERING. IT WASN'T LOOKING AND SAY,
[1:07:45] "OH, PETER, HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE
[1:07:46] THIS, PETER?" IT KNEW. THE WORD KNEW. IT
[1:07:49] ISN'T ABOUT, "OH, HOW COULD YOU HAVE
[1:07:50] DONE THIS AND DONE THAT?" WE'RE NOT HERE
[1:07:52] TO TRY TO REFORM SOMEBODY.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; IT'S TO GET HIM IN CONTACT WITH JESUS
[1:07:58] CHRIST.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE WHO STABILIZES YOUR LIFE.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THEY EMBRACE THE
[1:08:07] FULFILLMENT. THEY WALKED WITH HIM IN
[1:08:09] LUKE 24 and here they are. He makes as
[1:08:12] though he's going to go on by and they
[1:08:13] say, "Hey, hey, hey, hey." They
[1:08:14] constrained him.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Come in.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And when he got in there, he be to do
[1:08:20] things
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; right
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; in that little secret place.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; He It wasn't a public show. He began to
[1:08:26] reveal himself there in that little
[1:08:29] place and and begin to undo what he had
[1:08:32] always done.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; And it brought their attention to this
[1:08:36] is him. Yes.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram will say it like this.
[1:08:39] HE SAID THEY HAD a little idea all along
[1:08:42] that it was him.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Sam. No, no, no, no. They
[1:08:47] they had a LITTLE IDEA. BUT SEE, GOD
[1:08:48] JUST DON'T WANT YOU WALKING with a
[1:08:49] little idea. Maybe. I don't know.
[1:08:53] POSSIBLY. GOD DOESN'T WANT YOU PRESUMING
[1:08:55] BECAUSE YOU YOU YOU CAN NEVER OBTAIN ANY
[1:08:58] PROMISE AS LONG AS YOU'RE WONDERING. IF
[1:09:00] THE DEVIL HAS YOU WONDERING, WELL, I
[1:09:02] WONDER IF THIS IS FOR YOU. THIS MAY NOT
[1:09:03] BE FOR YOU. AND IF YOU ENTERTAIN THAT,
[1:09:06] THE ONLY THING THAT WILL DO IS PARALYZE
[1:09:08] THE FAITH THAT GOD HAS ALREADY BEEN
[1:09:11] INSTILLING IN YOUR HEART. WHAT DO I DO?
[1:09:14] CAST OUT EVERY SPIRIT, EVERY WORD, EVERY
[1:09:18] THOUGHT THAT SPEAKS CONTRARY TO THE WORD
[1:09:21] AND BELIEVE THE WORD ABOVE YOUR OWN
[1:09:24] THOUGHTS, ABOVE WHAT YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT
[1:09:26] YOURSELF. BELIEVE WHAT THE WORD IS
[1:09:29] SAYING ABOUT YOU. AMEN.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; So the word itself
[1:09:38] assures us of THE PROMISE. THE WORD
[1:09:40] ASSURES US of the promise because it is
[1:09:43] THE PROMISE. SO THE word walking with us
[1:09:47] IN OUR MIDST IS THE PROMISE. THAT'S WHAT
[1:09:50] WE'RE BROUGHT IN CONTACT WITH. THAT'S
[1:09:52] WHY I SAID THAT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT
[1:09:54] WHEN SOMEONE COMES IN AND AND HERE THEY
[1:09:56] ARE. THEY SIT HERE AND YOU YOU KNOW THEY
[1:09:58] THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFERENT. AND
[1:09:59] I'LL JUST SAY IT LIKE THIS. JUST AS GOD
[1:10:01] WAS PATIENT WITH US, WE HAVE TO LET GOD
[1:10:03] WORK EVERYTHING OUT. IT CAN BE LIKE
[1:10:05] THIS, FRIENDS. IT CAN BE A PERSON THAT
[1:10:07] SAT FOR 40 YEARS IN A MESSAGE CHURCH AND
[1:10:10] THEY'VE BEEN WITH THE WORD, BUT NEVER IN
[1:10:13] THE WORD.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT NOT STUDYING THE
[1:10:16] WORD. I'M TALKING ABOUT THEY'VE NEVER
[1:10:18] COME INTO the place of a real
[1:10:19] relationship with God.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; We don't want TO JUST BE WITH, we want
[1:10:24] to be in because that's rapture.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word assures us of the
[1:10:29] promise because it is the promise. The
[1:10:31] word is the promise and the word is God
[1:10:33] and the word is ours. And we become the
[1:10:35] word and the word becomes us. IF YOU
[1:10:37] ABIDE in me and my word abide in you.
[1:10:39] See it just becomes one great big
[1:10:41] family. It assures us because why? It's
[1:10:44] a part of us. It becomes a part of us.
[1:10:46] What a text. It assures us of the
[1:10:49] promise.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Now I want to say the prophet would
[1:10:52] continue to place this and going in the
[1:10:55] seals. Brother Brandon would very very
[1:10:58] very clearly and begin to say in the
[1:11:02] opening of going into those seals,
[1:11:04] God-hiding and simplicity, he'll use
[1:11:06] these two words together, revelation and
[1:11:09] vindication.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; He said it must be vindicated. NOT ONLY
[1:11:14] REVEALED, BUT IT MUST BE VINDICATED
[1:11:17] BECAUSE GOD WILL NOT VINDICATE anything
[1:11:19] other than his word.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And what he vindicates is what he's
[1:11:24] revealed.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THAT WORD IS REVEALED AND IT
[1:11:28] NOW COMES INTO A PLACE OF PREEMINENCE IN
[1:11:31] THE HEART AND LIFE OF THE BELIEVER, THEN
[1:11:32] THAT WORD IS VINDICATED.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; And God, LISTEN NOW, WITH THAT WORD
[1:11:37] BEING VINDICATED, GOD also is
[1:11:39] vindicating a people.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE A PART OF HIS WORD.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. My my my. The fourth seal,
[1:11:48] the prophet said it like this. He said,
[1:11:49] "Oh, this is how it was on the day of
[1:11:52] Pentecost." He said the spirit poured
[1:11:54] out upon them and when the vindication
[1:11:56] of the revelation took place then
[1:11:58] stimulation was upon them. Oh, he said
[1:12:01] it steamed them up right good too. Right
[1:12:03] in the streets they went. They weren't
[1:12:04] afraid. They they were afraid before
[1:12:07] they had the door shut. They were out in
[1:12:09] the streets where they had been afraid
[1:12:10] of a group of people preaching the
[1:12:12] gospel to them. But something had
[1:12:14] happened because the true word of
[1:12:15] promise was vindicated. HE SAID, 'NOW
[1:12:19] WATCH IF THAT BROUGHT SUCH POSITIVE TO
[1:12:23] THEM MEN. You see what the Holy Spirit
[1:12:26] does? It brings the positive promise
[1:12:30] inside of your heart
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; to where that you walk with a
[1:12:34] positivity.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; YOU WALK WITH AN ASSURANCE. YOU WALK
[1:12:38] WITH A CONFIDENCE IN THAT I KNOW WHO I
[1:12:41] AM.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; I KNOW IN WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED. I KNOW
[1:12:46] MY ELECTION COMES FROM GOD. AND I KNOW
[1:12:49] WHAT I WAS AND I KNOW THAT HE'S CHANGED
[1:12:51] MY LIFE.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT MY LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGED.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST MY THINKING. MY [screaming]
[1:12:59] LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGED. MY DESIRES HAVE
[1:13:02] BEEN CHANGED.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; I didn't GO FROM READING NOVELS TO
[1:13:06] READING THE BIBLE. THAT'S VERY ALL
[1:13:08] THAT'S ALL AND GOOD. BUT BUT ON TOP OF
[1:13:10] ALL OF THAT, WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS IS
[1:13:12] THAT AND I BELIEVE THE HOLY SPIRIT,
[1:13:14] IT'LL GIVE US A HUNGER FOR THE WORD, BUT
[1:13:15] [screaming] OUR LIVES, OUR NATURE HAS
[1:13:18] BEEN CHANGED.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY. And you know what? You can't
[1:13:21] explain that.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; It's something that God reveals to you
[1:13:26] personally.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; And it brings a positive to your life.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; It just settles you. It settles you with
[1:13:34] with God.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. And you know the word
[1:13:39] it's a relationship. It's a love affair.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; You long to hear the word. It's you're
[1:13:43] ready, you know, for when the word
[1:13:44] comes. If the word, you know, brings
[1:13:46] correction, my ready to to come right in
[1:13:49] and to come under that word. Why? You're
[1:13:50] recognizing the word as your mate.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Now watch." HE SAID,
[1:13:57] "IF that brought such a positive to them
[1:13:58] to every nearly every one of them sealed
[1:14:00] their testimony with their own blood, no
[1:14:02] matter what come along, as long as they
[1:14:03] lived, they never got over it. It stayed
[1:14:06] there because it was the true word of
[1:14:08] promise vindicated and the revelation
[1:14:11] become of vindicated.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; He said look at the promise of these
[1:14:15] LAST DAYS RIGHT BEFORE US THAT'S
[1:14:18] VINDICATED THE PRESENT coming of the
[1:14:20] Holy Spirit and the works that he's
[1:14:22] supposed TO DO AND WE FIND IT right
[1:14:25] among us.
[1:14:27] You see, just stopping right here. When
[1:14:29] you want to know why that a person could
[1:14:31] take and say this is brother Bram's
[1:14:33] opinion, this is brother Bram's thought,
[1:14:35] they've missed this.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; This is not DL Moody.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; This is not this is not this is not
[1:14:44] man's thoughts.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; This is this AND THIS IS WHAT WHEN THAT
[1:14:50] REVELATION COMES, IT BRINGS YOU REST.
[1:14:53] YOU BECOME A feeder
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; on the word.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; You feed on the word.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; There's a difference in just, you know,
[1:15:01] just just listen to it and feeding it.
[1:15:03] And when you feed it, it it's
[1:15:04] ministering to you. YOU YOU YOU OPEN THE
[1:15:06] WORD. YOU OPEN THE BIBLE. THE WORD'S
[1:15:08] BEING PREACHED, MAN. THERE'S IT'S A
[1:15:09] CHANNEL AS THE PROPHET SAID IT LIKE
[1:15:11] THIS. HE SAID THE GIFT HERE AND THE GIFT
[1:15:13] IN YOUR LIFE. HE SAID IT OPENS UP A
[1:15:15] CHANNEL AND THAT BECOMES THE SECRET FOOD
[1:15:17] MOVING THROUGH THAT CHANNEL. YES.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; SEE, YOU'RE IN TUNE WITH GOD IN EVEN
[1:15:23] WHEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH.
[1:15:25] YOU'RE IN TUNE WITH GOD COMING INTO
[1:15:27] FELLOWSHIP HERE IN THE CHURCH. IT KEEPS
[1:15:30] US LINED UP. IT KEEPS US IN FELLOWSHIP.
[1:15:32] IT KEEPS US IN TUNE WITH GOD'S VOICE.
[1:15:35] THAT'S GOD'S GRACE TO YOU AND I. SO THAT
[1:15:38] WHY IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL WALK WITH GOD,
[1:15:41] YOU ARE walking
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; with him.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; He's walking in you.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:48] It's God watching over his word.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, he said, "And when that it
[1:15:56] right among us." So to vindicate
[1:15:58] something, I love this definition. It
[1:16:00] means to clear someone of blame or
[1:16:02] suspicion.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Show or prove to be right, reasonable or
[1:16:08] justified.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS COME, SEE,
[1:16:11] LISTEN. THE MESSAGE MUST BE REVEALED.
[1:16:14] THIS IS TRUTH.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But now once it's revealed that
[1:16:19] this is truth, it now becomes the
[1:16:21] responsibility. Let that word be
[1:16:23] vindicated.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Let it be proven to where you become a
[1:16:27] part
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; of that word.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So listen, that's
[1:16:32] important. You can't we can't go any
[1:16:35] further. The disciples couldn't have
[1:16:36] went to Acts 2 without Luke 24. Luke 24
[1:16:40] was the revealing of the resurrected
[1:16:43] LORD JESUS CHRIST, THE FULFILLMENT OF
[1:16:46] THE PROMISE. WHAT DID THAT DO? BUILD
[1:16:48] FAITH
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; FOR THEIR PART.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE REVEALING OF THE WORD
[1:16:53] DOES. THAT'S WHAT THE REVELATION DOES.
[1:16:56] IT CALLS UPON YOU AND I FOR US TO
[1:16:58] surrender our lives
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; that we might embrace deity.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Glory. So this is why brother Random,
[1:17:07] you know, when he speaks out of a super
[1:17:09] sign, I just been just enjoying those
[1:17:11] messages over the the past little bit
[1:17:13] here, some weeks. But brother Ram would
[1:17:15] would say it like this. He said, notice,
[1:17:17] he said, he said, "This is my beloved
[1:17:19] son. Hear you him in whom I'm well
[1:17:20] pleased." HE SAID, NOTICE HE SENT FORTH
[1:17:23] HIS apostles and they burnt up the earth
[1:17:26] in their days as God being one WITH MAN.
[1:17:30] THEY BAPTIZED THE people in the name of
[1:17:32] that God Jesus Christ. And they live so
[1:17:35] CLOSE TO HIM TILL HE MANIFESTED HIMSELF
[1:17:38] THROUGH THEM through signs and WONDERS
[1:17:41] AND GIFTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, GOD WITH
[1:17:44] US. THEY PREACHED THERE WAS ONE TRUE
[1:17:47] LIVING GOD. NOW REMEMBER, IT'S IN THIS
[1:17:50] HOUR IN THE EVENING TIME WHERE GOD
[1:17:53] RESTORED THE REVELATION OF THE GODHEAD.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:00] HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; WHERE GOD RESTORES THAT BACK TO WHERE
[1:18:04] GOD AND MAN ARE ONE. TO WHERE THE JESUS
[1:18:07] WAS NOT A SECOND PERSON. AS BROTHER
[1:18:09] BRANDON WILL SAY IT IN SUPER SIGN. HE
[1:18:11] SAID SOME WANT TO MAKE HIM A SHORT GOD.
[1:18:14] HE SAID HE WASN'T A SHORT GOD. HE WAS
[1:18:17] GOD.
[1:18:19] [applause and cheering]
[1:18:20] YOU KNOW WHO DOES THAT? THE DEVIL DOES
[1:18:22] THAT. THAT'S THE DOCTRINE OF [screaming]
[1:18:24] DEVILS TO TAKE AWAY THE REAL EXPERIENCE
[1:18:28] OF THE DEITY OF JESUS CHRIST. THE REAL
[1:18:30] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT'LL CHANGE
[1:18:33] A MAN AND PUT A NEW MAN INSIDE OF THAT
[1:18:36] OLD GARMENT. IT BRINGS THE LIVING GOD,
[1:18:39] EMMANUEL, GOD, WITH US. [cheering]
[1:18:43] [applause]
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; SATAN HATES THIS REVELATION.
[1:18:52] There's more I could say upon that, but
[1:18:53] I won't here this morning.
[1:18:56] Ram talks about, he'll say, I love how
[1:18:58] he uses these phrases, the evening light
[1:19:01] people. The evening light people, he
[1:19:04] said, take heed. The message is revived
[1:19:06] again. This same message in the last
[1:19:08] days. He said, what message? God and man
[1:19:12] are one. Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; He says, "And who it appeals to is the
[1:19:19] evening light people."
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Does it appeal to you?
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; The evening light people.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory be to God. So this is where
[1:19:29] when we walking where the word is at.
[1:19:34] Brother Brandon will use this in
[1:19:36] multiple places in the message about
[1:19:39] that of a young man looking and seeing
[1:19:44] real potential, seeing real true
[1:19:46] attributes inside of a young lady. And
[1:19:50] he says, "Here's a woman standing here.
[1:19:53] I'm a young man waiting to get married.
[1:19:55] She meets my specifications in every
[1:19:58] way. She's a lovely Christian. She looks
[1:20:02] like one. She dresses like one. She acts
[1:20:05] like one. She lives like one. I'll admit
[1:20:08] she'd make me a good wife, but she isn't
[1:20:11] mine till I take her from mine.
[1:20:15] That's the way the message is. You can
[1:20:18] sympathize with it and say it's right.
[1:20:21] But you've got to take it yourself to
[1:20:24] become part of it.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Then you and the message become one.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Then the anointings with you as it is
[1:20:33] with others.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends how this is this
[1:20:38] is what's important is because as the
[1:20:40] prophet would say it like this in what
[1:20:42] house will you build me at 65. He makes
[1:20:45] this he makes this statement within just
[1:20:47] a just a brief message. And he says the
[1:20:50] message that God has given us in this
[1:20:52] hour is not only to be the flame of the
[1:20:55] hour. It's to be the flame that burns in
[1:20:58] our hearts.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; And he said if it doesn't burn in our
[1:21:01] hearts, we can't rightly present it
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; because it's not our oration, our great
[1:21:11] oratory skills, our ability to pronounce
[1:21:14] words. That's not what does it.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus said flesh and blood.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; The flesh and blood that was standing
[1:21:21] there did not reveal it.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOD BEHIND THE VEIL, BUT IT WAS
[1:21:27] GOD REVEALING HIMSELF THROUGH THAT VEIL
[1:21:31] TO BE GOD.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; PETER CAUGHT THAT REVELATION.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; He couldn't GET AWAY FROM THAT
[1:21:39] REVELATION. BUT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST,
[1:21:41] THAT REVELATION BECAME A VINDICATION.
[1:21:44] WHAT DID THAT REVELATION DO? IT BROUGHT
[1:21:46] SINCERITY. WHAT DOES REVELATION DO? IT
[1:21:49] CAUSES YOU TO RELEASE, LIKE THE PROPHET
[1:21:51] SAID, many great pearl truths. But he
[1:21:54] says, when you FIND THE PEARL OF GREAT
[1:21:57] PRICE, YOU'RE WILLING TO LET go of all
[1:21:59] the other PEARLS
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU FOUND THE PEARL of great
[1:22:03] price. YOU SEE GOD, LISTEN, GOD WILL NOT
[1:22:06] TAKE SOMETHING FROM YOU AND GIVE YOU
[1:22:08] SOMETHING LESS. WHAT GOD DOES IS HE
[1:22:11] REMOVES FROM OUR LIVES WHAT IS NOT HIM.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; AND HE WHAT DOES HE DO IN EXCHANGE? HE
[1:22:18] TAKES OUR GUILT. HE TAKES OUR SHAME. HE
[1:22:21] TAKES EVERYTHING THAT THERE IS ABOUT US
[1:22:24] AND IS SURRENDERED AND HE POURS himself
[1:22:27] in.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You know what's beautiful? He continues
[1:22:29] to pour himself in. All right.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz the song, the more that I surrender,
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; The more that I surrender
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; this relationship.
[1:22:39] Hallelujah. So, just to sympathize with
[1:22:41] it, just to say it's right. It's the
[1:22:43] truth. That's that's a that's a very
[1:22:45] important thing. But it's got to become
[1:22:47] one with this word. That's the only way
[1:22:49] it can happen is by the holy the Holy
[1:22:51] Spirit. And so notice these this is why
[1:22:54] brother Bram used the term she isn't
[1:22:56] mine until I take the responsibility of
[1:22:59] her being my wife because be the
[1:23:00] responsibility is going to be forsaking
[1:23:02] other things
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; and your priority. You don't just you
[1:23:06] don't just hem and you don't just go and
[1:23:07] you don't just when you're single you do
[1:23:09] what you want to do right even when
[1:23:12] you're courting even engagement you
[1:23:14] still have your times but you go back to
[1:23:16] your own house
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; and you have your own me time
[1:23:22] I'm just saying friends
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; but there becomes a responsibility
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; now let me just tell you if if the word
[1:23:30] if it's looking at oh it's burdensome oh
[1:23:33] it's a well you you've got what it is.
[1:23:35] FIRST OF ALL, YOU'VE GOT TO SEE him for
[1:23:37] who he is.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU'VE IT'S GOT TO BE REVEALED WHO
[1:23:40] HE IS AND what he wants to do for you.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; See, Jesus don't want to be a boyfriend.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; He won't be a boyfriend.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THE PROPHET SAID IN CHRIST the
[1:23:48] mystery, HE SAID HE'S NOT REVEALING this
[1:23:50] secret to flurers.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT IT.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE SINCERITY. IT'S GOT TO BE
[1:23:57] SAYING LIKE THIS. GOD, LET MY HEART BE
[1:23:59] LINED UP. LET IT BE SINCERE AS I NEED TO
[1:24:02] BE IN THIS HOUR. THIS IS A SERIOUS HOUR.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; YES, IT IS.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT GIVEN UNLIMITED CHANCES.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME, FRIENDS?
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET PUTS IT VERY CLEARLY. WE'RE
[1:24:14] NOT GIVEN UNLIMITED CHANCES. WE TAKE THE
[1:24:16] SEAL OR WE TAKE THE MARK.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; And the prophet brings that right in
[1:24:21] with these statements within your about
[1:24:23] just sympathizing. So many don't want
[1:24:26] to, you know, others will COME IN
[1:24:27] CONTACT. THEY DON'T WANT TO ROT AWAY.
[1:24:29] THEY DON'T WANT TO DIE AWAY. They don't
[1:24:30] want to they don't want to get away from
[1:24:32] things. They don't want WHEN IT COMES
[1:24:33] DOWN TO IT. LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU.
[1:24:35] EVEN GOING SO FAR WITH THE WORD AND THE
[1:24:37] WORD BEGINS TO TOUCH PET DOCTRINES THAT
[1:24:40] ARE not the word.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; God can allow that to go. And here he
[1:24:47] is. He's trying to deal with that,
[1:24:48] trying to address that because it's got
[1:24:50] to be that of a fullness of the word.
[1:24:53] Now, are there things THAT YOU AND I
[1:24:55] have believed, have thought, and we
[1:24:58] thought wrong?
[1:25:00] I know there's probably some angels in
[1:25:01] here that everything you've ever thought
[1:25:03] was wrong. Donuts with angels and I get
[1:25:05] it.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; But you ain't fooling with me
[1:25:09] [panting]
[1:25:10] cuz brother Bram didn't even live like
[1:25:11] that like that.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; But but what what what came what was it
[1:25:16] that came and touched your heart? The
[1:25:17] spirit of truth.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; AND SEE SHOWING WATCH NOW SHOWING THAT
[1:25:21] THAT LIFE IS ALREADY THERE. YOU YOU
[1:25:24] FOLLOW THAT TRUTH OF THE WORD. YOU LET
[1:25:27] [screaming] GO OF THAT BECAUSE YOU
[1:25:28] REALIZE WHAT IT IS YOU'RE HOLDING ON TO,
[1:25:31] THE UNDERSTANDING YOU'RE LEANING ON,
[1:25:33] RESTING ON, WHAT YOU'RE RESTING UPON,
[1:25:36] AND YOU REALIZE THIS IS A HINDRANCE.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT MY POSITIVE. IT'S NOT MY
[1:25:42] CONFIDENCE. IT'S A HINDRANCE.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; IT'S SOMETHING I'VE RESTED ON. OH, I get
[1:25:46] this feeling. Oh, I GET THIS. IT'S
[1:25:48] SOMETHING I'VE RESTED ON. I'M NOT GOING
[1:25:49] TO LEAN TO MY OWN UNDERSTANDING. I'M
[1:25:51] GOING TO LEAN AND REST IN THE WORD OF MY
[1:25:54] HUSBAND.
[1:25:56] AMEN.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; That's why you cannot even rest and lean
[1:25:59] upon your feelings.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you went by your feelings, many
[1:26:02] of us would not even been here today.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Probably I wouldn't have been standing
[1:26:08] right here and have a whole lot of rest
[1:26:10] and things. But you know, we got to go
[1:26:13] beyond OUR FEELINGS. WHAT DRIVES YOU TO
[1:26:15] GO BEYOND YOUR FEELINGS? The love of
[1:26:17] God.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; The love of God. The prophet SAID, "THE
[1:26:21] LOVE OF GOD TAKES FAITH AND DRAGS IT OUT
[1:26:23] to the battlefront.
[1:26:26] So to becoming one, Moses became one. It
[1:26:29] was going to cost Moses.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; But he kept on looking through that
[1:26:32] window. And finally one day, Moses, he
[1:26:37] kept on seeing what he was seeing. And
[1:26:39] he made a choice. I'm not going to
[1:26:42] sympathize no more.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Now, you might say, well, he fell flat
[1:26:47] on his face, but at least he was making
[1:26:49] steps forward.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. because he went from falling flat
[1:26:52] on his face with a dead Egyptian to
[1:26:55] getting on his face before THE BURNING
[1:26:56] BUSH. GOD WAS GETTING HIM right where he
[1:26:59] NEEDED TO BE. SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT
[1:27:02] THINGS AND FRIENDS, WE MAY NOT
[1:27:04] UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS COULD GO SO LONG.
[1:27:06] AND LISTEN, IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME THAT A
[1:27:08] PERSON, OH, they would go 30 YEARS OR
[1:27:10] WHAT. THAT DON'T BOTHER ME. WE'RE NOT
[1:27:11] HERE RATING ANYBODY. THE WHOLE OBJECTIVE
[1:27:14] IS UNTIL THAT LIFE HAS BEEN CHANGED AND
[1:27:17] MADE READY FOR RAPTURE AND CHRIST
[1:27:20] BECOMES PREEMINENT.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Because that battle of
[1:27:25] preeminence, it's every day in your life
[1:27:27] once you have been born again of the
[1:27:29] spirit of God.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; It's constantly laying down our will.
[1:27:35] This is where the scripture said, you
[1:27:38] know, within our lives, it talks about
[1:27:41] these that went on in Hebrews 11. They
[1:27:44] all died in faith, not having received
[1:27:47] the promises, but having seen them far
[1:27:49] off. They they it was revealed to them
[1:27:53] and were persuaded of them and embraced
[1:27:56] them and confessed them that they were
[1:27:59] strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For
[1:28:02] they that say such things declare
[1:28:04] plainly that they seek a country.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Their lives had been affected by the
[1:28:11] word that had BEEN REVEALED.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; IT CHANGED the course of their life.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; It took Abraham FROM BEING A GOD MAKER
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; to becoming a God himself,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; son of God.
[1:28:24] [laughter]
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. From making lifeless, DUMB
[1:28:27] IMAGES THAT HE HAD TO PACK AROUND.
[1:28:30] That's right.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; AND GOD TOOK ABRAHAM AND GOD. DID GOD
[1:28:34] DO? GOD MADE A LIVING image out of
[1:28:36] Abraham. Brother Brandham says it like
[1:28:37] this. You are God's idol.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS SHAPED YOU AND FASHIONED YOU BY
[1:28:45] HIS WORD. AND YOU DON'T HAVE EARS THAT
[1:28:47] YOU CAN'T HEAR. YOU'VE GOT EARS YOU CAN
[1:28:49] HEAR.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE A MOUTH THAT YOU CAN'T
[1:28:52] SPEAK. YOU'RE NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT'S
[1:28:54] AN OUTLINE OR A FIGURE OR JUST, YOU
[1:28:56] KNOW, JUST AN OUTLINE OF A MESSAGE. YOU
[1:28:58] ARE THE EXPRESSION OF THIS MESSAGE. THE
[1:29:02] BREATH OF GOD [screaming]
[1:29:04] HAS BREATHED UPON YOUR LIFE AND CHANGED
[1:29:07] YOUR LIFE.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T A CHURCH PACKING YOU AROUND.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; COME ON, FRIENDS.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE MORE THAN, WELL,
[1:29:16] SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PACK ME HERE AND PACK
[1:29:17] ME THERE AND PACK ME THERE. IT'S GOT TO
[1:29:19] COME TO A PLACE IN TIME TO WHERE YOU LET
[1:29:22] GOD [screaming] HAVE CONTROL OF YOUR
[1:29:24] LIFE AND LET GOD PACK YOU. AMEN.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; LET THE WORD PACK YOU THROUGH CUZ THAT'S
[1:29:29] THE ONLY THING THAT'LL EVER TAKE YOU
[1:29:31] THROUGH.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE PROMISE OF THE COMFORTER.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; This is why faith is a long range
[1:29:39] vision.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Faith when the Bible would tell us that
[1:29:45] we don't look at things which are seen
[1:29:46] because they're temporal.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; They're temporal.
[1:29:50] But the things which are not seen with
[1:29:52] these eyes are eternal.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:57] Faith is the substance
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; of things hoped for and the evidence of
[1:30:01] things not seen. It affects you.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; You know what faith is? It's a
[1:30:05] revelation of the will of God.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; You know what caused Abraham to go to
[1:30:08] the hospital and make payments? Faith.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; It wasn't hope. It was faith.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Faith gave him hope and expectation.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; He didn't know how it was going to be.
[1:30:20] He didn't even know when it was going to
[1:30:22] be. He just said, "I'm here to make
[1:30:23] another payment."
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:30:26] You might have think, you might have
[1:30:27] thought that you got a room where things
[1:30:29] are stored up. They had the diapers
[1:30:31] stored up.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; You know why? They were preparing.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Abraham had they had embraced that
[1:30:40] promise. Even though Sarah hadn't come
[1:30:42] to it yet, they embraced that promise.
[1:30:44] IT WAS BY FAITH. AND WHEN YOU HAVE
[1:30:46] FAITH, your works will declare your
[1:30:49] faith.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Right?
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; It will declare cuz what everybody was
[1:30:55] saying, you know, when Abraham walking
[1:30:56] around, we're going to have a baby.
[1:30:57] We're going to have a baby. The prophet
[1:30:58] said that was invisible to everybody
[1:31:00] else except Abraham.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; He said, but one day what was invisible
[1:31:04] to Abraham became visible to everybody
[1:31:06] else he had been testifying to.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE POWER OF CONFESSION. THAT'S
[1:31:11] HOW THEY WALKED. THEY THEY SEEN IT. THEY
[1:31:14] WERE PERSUADED OF IT. THEY EMBRACED IT.
[1:31:17] AND THEY CONFESSED IT. AND WHAT THEY HAD
[1:31:20] SAW AND THEIR LIFE BECAME WRAPPED IN.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; It became visible.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; You say, "When did it become visible?"
[1:31:29] At the door of paradise. THAT'S HIM.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HIM.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; AND THEY UP THEY CAME ON THAT
[1:31:36] RESURRECTION MORNING WITH HIM, THE
[1:31:38] MIGHTY CONQUEROR, AND ASCENDED INTO
[1:31:42] HEAVEN.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; THEY ASCENDED INTO THAT CITY. THEY WERE
[1:31:46] PART OF THAT. OPEN UP THE GATES. HE
[1:31:48] EVERLASTING GATES. OPEN [screaming] UP.
[1:31:51] WHO IS THIS? THE LORD OF GLORY,
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; MIGHTY [screaming] IN BATTLE. THE ONE
[1:31:56] WHO HAD DEFEATED SATAN, BROKE THE
[1:31:59] BACKBONE OF THE DEVIL, THE ONE THAT HAD
[1:32:01] CONQUERED SIN. THE ONE THAT HAD
[1:32:03] CONQUERED SATAN'S TRINITY. HE HAS AROSE.
[1:32:05] HE IS ALIVE. HE HAS OPENED UP THE WAY
[1:32:08] [screaming] BACK TO FULL FELLOWSHIP
[1:32:10] WHERE GOD AND MAN ARE RESTORED ONCE
[1:32:12] AGAIN. EMMANUEL, GOD WITH US.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:18] [applause] HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; This is why the focus in our lives,
[1:32:23] whatever you focus on will affect
[1:32:26] you
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; and it'll affect the others in your
[1:32:29] family.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; If you want to know if you've got the
[1:32:31] right focus, look at your family.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You got to be dial
[1:32:39] dialed in because your focus will will
[1:32:42] invite God's presence into the home to
[1:32:46] effect. Now listen, you never, you
[1:32:49] don't, it's not you nor me that changes
[1:32:52] our children,
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; but it's the presence of God.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; It's inviting him in.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; IT'S BRINGING GOD in skin right next TO
[1:33:02] HIM.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S LETTING THEM SEE WHAT EMMANUEL is
[1:33:06] like.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? KEEPING THEM UNDER THE
[1:33:10] PRESENCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. THEY THEY'RE
[1:33:12] NOT THEY'RE NOT PUTTING TOGETHER BECAUSE
[1:33:14] EVEN IF AS A CHILD THEY CAN REPEAT
[1:33:16] doctrines if you say it long enough 2
[1:33:18] plus 2 equals 4 2 plus 2 equals 4 and I
[1:33:20] get it GOD CAN GIVE EVEN UNDERSTANDING
[1:33:22] BUT LISTEN FRIENDS THERE'S times as I
[1:33:24] told you before there's quotes I you
[1:33:27] could start I could finish
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; sitting on a bar stool
[1:33:33] it's not about that
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; you've got to meet the God of this
[1:33:36] message
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; you've got to meet because the God of
[1:33:39] this message is the message it is Christ
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; amen and have a personal experience with
[1:33:43] him.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my, when I can read those quotes and
[1:33:46] read that now, it's entirely different
[1:33:48] in MY LIFE BECAUSE WHY? MY LIFE HAS BEEN
[1:33:51] CHANGED.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; I WASN'T QUOTING THEM AS THOUGH TO PROP
[1:33:54] MYSELF UP. IT'S JUST I HAD HEARD THEM.
[1:33:56] THE TAPES WERE PLAYED IN MY HOUSE. I HAD
[1:33:58] HEARD IT PREACHED. THERE'S QUOTES I HAD
[1:34:00] THINGS I HAD HEARD PREACHED. ALL RIGHT.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; But one day,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; one day,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; what I knew to be truth became
[1:34:10] vindicated.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; See, this is why with the focus of our
[1:34:19] lives, I know it isn't this isn't real
[1:34:22] popular, but this is where where the
[1:34:24] crosshairs get put on the devil that
[1:34:25] wants to try to take from people from
[1:34:28] God, from the people of God, the
[1:34:29] application of the word. Right?
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Satan's business is to try to distract
[1:34:33] from what God is revealing. Do you
[1:34:35] realize the prophet said it like this in
[1:34:36] Christ the mystery? He said what God has
[1:34:40] revealing, what he's trying to reveal.
[1:34:41] Now watch this. What he's trying to
[1:34:43] reveal, what he's trying to get to you,
[1:34:46] he said you let your job take it out of
[1:34:49] you.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; You let
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; he said your pastor take it out of you.
[1:34:53] He's talking about the ministries after
[1:34:54] people in the meetings they go say you
[1:34:56] let you let your boss you let your
[1:34:58] co-workers you let this you let that it
[1:35:00] like it leeches out. See this is why
[1:35:02] what's been revealed you you you have to
[1:35:05] protect that.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; How do you protect that? By embracing
[1:35:08] it.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; By how do I embrace it? That's why the
[1:35:11] prophet says it like this in the
[1:35:12] Pergeamian church age. Don't let
[1:35:14] anything get between you and that word.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Nothing gets between you and that word.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; OH, I WANT MY FAMILY SAVED. THEY'LL
[1:35:22] never see Christ if you let them get
[1:35:24] between you and Christ.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; If you WANT TO SEE HIM SAVED, THEN YOU
[1:35:29] HAVE TO SAY, "GOD, it's me and you." And
[1:35:32] Lord God, let my life be so reflected to
[1:35:35] where it's Christ the influence. IT'S
[1:35:36] WHERE IT'S EMMANUEL
[1:35:38] reflecting his life.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Right? This is our prayer.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; God, let it be with him that way. Let it
[1:35:46] be. Let it be God with us. SO HERE THAT
[1:35:49] FOCUS AND WE BY THE SPIRIT OF God as
[1:35:52] Paul said there in Colossians set our
[1:35:55] affections
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; on things above. If you're raised he
[1:35:58] said if you're raised set your
[1:35:59] affections on things above
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; right
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; see we the enemy wants to try to take
[1:36:05] things from us BUT THIS IS WHERE WITHIN
[1:36:07] it you listen you GOT TO UNDERSTAND THE
[1:36:09] DEVIL'S TACTIC. HE'S TRYING TO TAKE FROM
[1:36:11] YOU WHAT GOD IS WANTING TO PUT IN YOU
[1:36:14] and then let that word WORK IN YOUR
[1:36:16] LIFE. LISTEN, ONCE IT'S REVEALED, THEN
[1:36:19] [screaming] WHAT FOLLOWS IT?
[1:36:20] VINDICATION.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; And vindication is where the Holy Spirit
[1:36:24] comes down and ignites that word. It
[1:36:27] brings out a positive life.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; It brings out a life of stability. It
[1:36:31] brings out a life that's free from sin.
[1:36:34] It brings out a life that can look right
[1:36:36] in the face of sin and everything else
[1:36:38] can walk right by everything and can
[1:36:41] take the word of God fully. And there's
[1:36:43] not one thing in the word where your
[1:36:45] soul won't punctuate it with an amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So it be it begs us and
[1:36:53] behooves us for these questions to pass
[1:36:56] FOR US TO PASS THINGS THROUGH IN OUR
[1:36:57] MIND BECAUSE PAUL SAID, "STAND FAST IN
[1:37:00] THE LIBERTY THAT YOU'VE BEEN MADE FREE
[1:37:02] IN CHRIST. DON'T BE ENTANGLED." HE'S
[1:37:04] LETTING US KNOW YOU COULD BECOME
[1:37:06] ENTANGLED AGAIN,
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'VE GOT TO STAND FAST.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT A WAR. YOU'VE GOT TO BATTLE.
[1:37:12] [screaming] YOU'VE GOT TO MAINTAIN YOUR
[1:37:15] POSITION IN CHRIST.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ONCE YOU HAVE BEEN POSITIONED IN
[1:37:20] CHRIST, YOU DO NOT BECOME ON A PICNIC.
[1:37:24] YOU'VE ENTERED A BATTLEGROUND.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; AND THAT BATTLEGROUND IS WHERE YOU
[1:37:30] SUBMITTING OF OUR LIVES AND OUR
[1:37:32] CHARACTER BEING MOLDED. CHARACTER IS NOT
[1:37:35] A GIFT.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; It's a victory.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; It's an overcoming process that first
[1:37:42] even begins with overcoming when it's
[1:37:44] revealed to you even the error or what
[1:37:47] in our life. And when I say error, I'm
[1:37:49] talking about maybe it's an action.
[1:37:50] Maybe it's something in your life that
[1:37:52] you realize the Holy Spirit brings it up
[1:37:54] at that time and how that you interact
[1:37:56] or HOW THIS AT THAT MOMENT WHEN HE'S
[1:37:58] REVEALED IT. IT DOESN'T MEAN AT THAT
[1:38:00] TIME THAT OH, IT'S GONE AWAY. WHAT IT
[1:38:02] MEANS IS WHEN HE'S REVEALED THAT PORTION
[1:38:04] IN YOUR LIFE, THAT'S THE TIME TO EMBRACE
[1:38:06] DEITY AND SAY, "OH GOD, LORD, TEACH ME,
[1:38:10] SHOW ME, GIVE ME DISCERNMENT. THERE'S A
[1:38:12] WEAKNESS IN MY LIFE, LORD. YOU KNOW
[1:38:14] THOSE WEAKNESSES, BUT THERE'S NO
[1:38:16] WEAKNESSES IN THE GENE SEED OF GOD.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WEAKNESSES IN YOUR WORD,
[1:38:23] LORD.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; I EMPTY MYSELF OUT, LORD,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; THAT you might feel.
[1:38:31] That's embracing deity.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; It's embracing it. Taking it to your
[1:38:35] bosom.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; And so you have the questions that there
[1:38:41] are lives things must pass through. How
[1:38:42] will this draw me closer to the Lord
[1:38:44] Jesus?
[1:38:46] How will this affect my home?
[1:38:49] Will this hinder my walk?
[1:38:55] Our whole life.
[1:38:58] Brother Brandon would make statements
[1:39:00] and I I just love I I'm going to read
[1:39:02] one of them to you, but there's multiple
[1:39:05] that over the weeks as I'm just studying
[1:39:07] and meditating on these two words with
[1:39:10] and in. And brother Brown would say,
[1:39:13] "Lord, our whole life is wrapped in this
[1:39:15] token.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Our whole life is wrapped in it. It's
[1:39:18] everything.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; He's become my everything."
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; He's my all and all.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; And you know what? that becomes more
[1:39:27] real to us.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; The Rem says, "May our hearts be
[1:39:34] continually set on thee." We know, Lord,
[1:39:37] that money, property, things of the
[1:39:39] world have no meanings. They're just so
[1:39:42] temporal. All of them must go. Our jobs,
[1:39:46] our places, our friends, everything must
[1:39:48] go. No matter how rich, how poor, how
[1:39:51] popular, or unpopular we are, we are, it
[1:39:54] all must go. But there is only one thing
[1:39:56] that our being here is centered around
[1:39:58] and that's Jesus Christ.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; So God let us lay aside everything as
[1:40:04] secondarily
[1:40:06] and hold to him.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; I don't care how solid your company is.
[1:40:14] And I know God provides for his
[1:40:15] children.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; I don't care how solid your company is.
[1:40:19] I don't care how solid your skills are.
[1:40:21] I think all those things are wonderful.
[1:40:23] I mean, look, it's it's wonderful where
[1:40:25] you can have a peace of mind to go into
[1:40:26] a weekend and you don't have things
[1:40:27] being talked about, right?
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Like when I was teaching school and
[1:40:31] sometimes they'll talk about, oh, we're
[1:40:33] looking at maybe a strike or what more.
[1:40:34] I thought, dear God, I'm just is my
[1:40:36] first year of teaching. The people
[1:40:38] working at the counter of McDonald's are
[1:40:39] making more than me.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; I I need every single dollar.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; And any other dollar anybody will give
[1:40:46] me strike? I can't strike.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Right. Those kind of things can it can
[1:40:52] it can get in your mind.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; And you know what that's where we have
[1:40:56] to follow the word and bringing in
[1:40:58] subjection.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; You know what God does there in some of
[1:41:01] those early times. I look back in my
[1:41:02] life some of those early times and early
[1:41:04] battles. There were only preparation.
[1:41:06] And you know what it does? It doesn't
[1:41:08] take away that the battle's still not
[1:41:09] real. It just builds your patience
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; and your expectation. He did it before.
[1:41:14] He'll do it again.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Lion, bear, Goliath, he's the same God.
[1:41:19] SEE, IT JUST IT'S BUILDING FAITH AND
[1:41:21] patience in God.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Everything else
[1:41:27] the prophet goes on to say in spiritual
[1:41:28] food and due season, he said, "It's like
[1:41:30] Elisha of old. If God be God, then serve
[1:41:33] him."
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; And if Jesus is the center of all things
[1:41:36] to the Christian, then I think we ought
[1:41:39] to let loose of everything else and
[1:41:42] cleave to him.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; He's the center. He's the northstar.
[1:41:46] He's the ultimate. He's the absolute.
[1:41:48] He's the north star. And it will always,
[1:41:51] that one thing that's pointed to that
[1:41:52] north star is your compass. And that
[1:41:55] compass, he says, that I'm trying to
[1:41:56] sail with is this word.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just let me close
[1:42:03] here.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; I have a lot more hay on my fork, but
[1:42:12] we're getting there.
[1:42:14] It's one nice thing about being a
[1:42:15] pastor. You can just continue.
[1:42:20] Here's the promise of Isaiah
[1:42:23] and it's being declared. The people
[1:42:26] which sat in darkness
[1:42:29] saw great light.
[1:42:32] And to them which sat in the region
[1:42:36] and shadow of death light is sprung up.
[1:42:43] We were not just in darkness. We were
[1:42:47] darkness.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; We didn't find him. He came to us.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; We didn't find the message. The message
[1:43:00] found us.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; It was God. GOD COMING. THE LIGHT IN THE
[1:43:10] LIGHT BEING THE FULFILLMENT OF HIS WORD
[1:43:13] AND IT BEGINS TO TAKE A HOLD OF OUR
[1:43:14] LIFE. AND THINK ABOUT IT, FRIENDS, JUST
[1:43:16] LIKE EVEN MANY THAT WERE EVEN SITTING
[1:43:18] THERE THAT CONTINUED ON IN THE
[1:43:19] TABERNACLE, EVEN AS REAL BELIEVERS, THEY
[1:43:21] SAT THERE, THEY KNEW SOMETHING WAS REAL,
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; But they didn't THEY DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY
[1:43:29] WHAT WAS GOING ON. I I shared with you
[1:43:30] many times IF YOU JUST IF YOU haven't
[1:43:33] you read through Osborne in the memorial
[1:43:36] service. I have been going through that
[1:43:38] here over the past few months of
[1:43:39] different things when you read things
[1:43:42] that TL Osborne said and yet what you
[1:43:44] realize IS THE SO THE THINGS THAT TL
[1:43:46] OSBORNE said within there in brother
[1:43:48] Brandon's memorial service that they had
[1:43:50] there at the tabernacle months later
[1:43:52] after HIS PASSING THERE'S STATEMENTS
[1:43:55] THAT are in there that you look at AND
[1:43:57] YOU THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH
[1:44:00] BECAUSE HE WAS CATCHING THIS WAS THIS
[1:44:03] WAS DIFFERENT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT
[1:44:05] THIS IT IT WAS GOD. IT WAS GOD MAKING
[1:44:08] HIMSELF KNOWN. AND HE SAID, "I'M NOT
[1:44:10] GLORIFYING BROTHER BRANDHAM, BUT LOOK,
[1:44:12] LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK." AS THOUGH
[1:44:15] OSBORNE COULD SEE THIS. MANY OF THE
[1:44:17] PENTECOSTALS ALSO SAW, MY WHAT A WHAT A
[1:44:21] WHAT A GREAT THING. AND YOU EVEN HAVE
[1:44:23] PEOPLE NOW THAT GO TO THE VERY SAME
[1:44:26] PLACES IN ARIZONA AND SAY, "THERE IS A
[1:44:29] CERTAIN FORCE field here. OH, THERE'S
[1:44:30] SPECIAL THINGS HERE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A
[1:44:32] GREAT MOVE OF GOD." AND WHAT IT IS,
[1:44:34] THEY'VE MISSED. YEAH,
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; THEY'VE MISSED IT. THAT'S WHY THE
[1:44:38] PROPHET SAID THAT THOSE IN WRITING THE
[1:44:40] VOICE OF HEALING, HE SAID THIS IS WHY
[1:44:42] YOU THEY WON'T WRITE ANYTHING EXCEPT
[1:44:44] FAST AND PRAY, FAST AND PRAY. I'M NOT
[1:44:46] KNOCKING THOSE PEOPLE, FRIENDS. I'M
[1:44:48] TRYING TO SHOW YOU GOD'S GRACE THAT'S
[1:44:50] COME TO OUR LIVES.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAID THEY'RE WRITING PRAY
[1:44:53] AND FAST, PRAY AND FAST, PRAY AND FAST.
[1:44:55] A GREAT REVIVAL IS COMING. AND HE SAID
[1:44:57] THEY HAVE MISSED IT. BUT BY BEING
[1:44:59] CHRISTIANS, THEY FEEL THE pull of the
[1:45:02] hour. Yes.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; But by not being of that elect, they
[1:45:06] miss it.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; It goes over their head to recognize
[1:45:10] what it's about.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; What about when what about standing in
[1:45:16] Chicago
[1:45:18] at the breakfast
[1:45:20] when every one of them
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; it wasn't those men? When you see those
[1:45:25] kind of things like that, religious
[1:45:26] traps, I'm not saying that those men
[1:45:28] were evil, but I'm saying there's an
[1:45:29] anointing coming from somewhere. Oh
[1:45:31] yeah.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; It was the same anointing was on the
[1:45:32] Pharisees trying to trap the Lord Jesus.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; That's why, listen, even when you're
[1:45:38] talking with someone, witnessing with
[1:45:39] someone, and you catch it. If they go
[1:45:42] into debate and argumentative mode, just
[1:45:44] back off.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; It's a wrong anointing.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Just back off. You don't have to prove
[1:45:50] nothing to nobody.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; There's there's a difference, friends.
[1:45:53] There's a difference when when you can
[1:45:55] speak to people and you can talk to
[1:45:57] people and you want to share things. I
[1:46:00] was fellowshipping with a brother the
[1:46:01] other the other other night. I said,
[1:46:02] "Here's a difference." I said, "When
[1:46:04] there's things to me, I would want
[1:46:05] somebody to share something with me from
[1:46:07] the message if I'm not if I've not seen
[1:46:10] something." I would welcome that.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? I would welcome
[1:46:13] that. But when you begin to share
[1:46:15] something with someone say, "Well, I
[1:46:16] don't believe that. I don't want to
[1:46:17] receive that." That's a problem.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; There's a problem somewhere. You know
[1:46:21] what the problem is? The problem's not
[1:46:22] with man. The problem's with the word.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Because this IS NOT BROTHER RAM'S
[1:46:26] THOUGHTS, BROTHER RAM'S IDEAS. THAT'S
[1:46:28] WHY I SAID IF SOMEBODY'S GOING TO SAY,
[1:46:29] "WELL, WE DO THIS AND WE DO THAT." I I'm
[1:46:31] just going TO SIMPLY ASK YOU, I'M NOT
[1:46:32] I'M NOT PRIVILEGED. I COULD PREACH MY
[1:46:34] OWN THOUGHTS, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT
[1:46:36] WON'T CHANGE YOU.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; SO, I just simply say, do you have a
[1:46:41] quote?
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Well, sometimes that gets But I'm
[1:46:47] asking, do you have a quote? Do you have
[1:46:48] something you're drawing from? Because
[1:46:50] don't try to bring Jehovah's Witness and
[1:46:52] mix it in here.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Don't try to bring, OH, THE APOSTOLIC,
[1:46:55] THEY HAD. DON'T TRY TO MIX THAT IN HERE.
[1:46:58] YOU CAN'T MIX OLD LEAVEN WITH THIS AND
[1:47:01] IT REMAIN PURE. [applause and cheering]
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S A PURE MESSAGE BY A PURE SPIRIT
[1:47:06] THAT BROUGHT A PURE LANGUAGE, THE
[1:47:09] LANGUAGE OF DIVINE REVELATION. GOD HAS
[1:47:12] RESTORED THE LANGUAGE TO THE church of
[1:47:15] the living God.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; The language of atonement, the language
[1:47:19] of reconciliation. God has restored that
[1:47:21] language
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; to the world. Remember, it's there. As
[1:47:26] the prophet said, it went and it was
[1:47:27] unwritten, but God revealed what was
[1:47:29] written.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; A great light has sprung up. Aren't you
[1:47:32] glad that light found you?
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; We were in darkness.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT LIGHT DID? THE
[1:47:39] LIGHT DIDN'T JUST COME AND SHINE RIGHT
[1:47:40] WHERE YOU WERE AND SAY, "HEY, HOW YOU
[1:47:42] LIKING AROUND HERE?" THE LIGHT COMES TO
[1:47:44] DO WHAT? LEAD YOU OUT OF DARKNESS INTO
[1:47:48] NOT JUST LIGHT, [screaming] BUT HIS
[1:47:50] MARVELOUS LIGHT.
[1:47:53] NOT JUST A LIGHT THAT WILL LIGHT YOUR
[1:47:56] SPIRIT WHERE YOU CAN BE LIT FOR
[1:47:58] JUSTIFICATION, LIT UP FOR
[1:48:00] SANCTIFICATION, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE
[1:48:02] OIL [screaming] DOWN IN THE VESSEL.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; AND THAT OIL IS A WISE VIRGIN. IT'S THAT
[1:48:08] OF HIS MARVELOUS LIGHT.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JUST TO HAVE A LIGHT OF
[1:48:12] JUSTIFICATION, it'll go out. Just to
[1:48:14] have a LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT OF THAT OF
[1:48:16] SANCTIFICATION, IT'LL GO OUT.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; But it takes the light.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:23] the oil of God down on the inside, which
[1:48:24] is the confirmation of the word.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; That's a vindication.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; It comes to bring you out.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; And you know what? It's still leading
[1:48:33] you out.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; It's still leading me out. That's why
[1:48:37] the prophet when he preaches greatest
[1:48:38] battle ever fought, he says, "Abraham,
[1:48:41] Abraham's seed,
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; come away and live with me.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Separate from your seed, taste, feel,
[1:48:48] smell, hear. Separate from your
[1:48:50] reasoning, CONSCIENCE, MEMORY,
[1:48:51] AFFECTION. SEPARATE ABRAHAM YOURSELF
[1:48:54] FROM YOUR KINDRED. COME LIVE WITH ME.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THAT'S THE PRIVILEGE. WHEN THE
[1:49:00] PROPHET WENT AND SPOKE TO THE STORM,
[1:49:02] WHAT DID WHAT DID THE ANGEL OF THE LORD
[1:49:04] TELL HIM? COME WALK WITH [screaming] ME.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; What a privilege, friends.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you, you can't walk
[1:49:15] with him and your life not be affected.
[1:49:19] Amen.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; He's a real father.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; He's a real comforter. He's right there
[1:49:29] alongside our coming right alongside us.
[1:49:32] He's there to teach us and he shows us
[1:49:33] things. You say, "Oh, father, forgive
[1:49:35] me. I didn't Lord, I I see that. I see
[1:49:37] that flaw in my character." He said,
[1:49:38] "Here, my son. Remember, greater is he
[1:49:40] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:49:42] world. Just submit yourself to me.
[1:49:43] Father, give me the discernment I need.
[1:49:46] Help me to recognize it. Show me how to
[1:49:48] apply it in my life, LORD. WELL, WHAT IS
[1:49:49] IT? IT'S HIM, THE COMFORTER. HE WHO IS
[1:49:52] CALLED ALONGSIDE TO GUIDE US INTO all
[1:49:55] truth.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord?
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; This is why Peter said,
[1:50:06] "We have a more sure word of prophecy,
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; where unto you do well that you take
[1:50:11] heed."
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; That's good. Yeah.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say this so everybody
[1:50:15] can relate to this.
[1:50:18] There were meetings that I had to set in
[1:50:21] even when I was a teacher that I had to
[1:50:24] battle.
[1:50:26] I had to battle just sat there and pinch
[1:50:30] myself.
[1:50:33] You know, [laughter] you get up standing
[1:50:35] in the back of the room if you could and
[1:50:37] it was just like h just
[1:50:40] But you know, this is different.
[1:50:44] It's different even in certain things
[1:50:46] that you would perk up about. Maybe your
[1:50:48] hobby,
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; your certain thing that is kind of like
[1:50:50] your groove. This is my groove.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; This is greater than your groove.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Good preacher.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; This is your position.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; And to take heed unto this word, to be
[1:51:06] attentive to it,
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; to embrace the word to h how do I
[1:51:10] embrace it? Start with an open heart.
[1:51:12] Amen.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Start with an open mind.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Start with an open an openness to the
[1:51:17] Lord. Lord, I open my life to you.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; I open be it unto me, Lord, according
[1:51:23] and and and it continues in that way.
[1:51:25] What? Take heed unto it as unto a light
[1:51:27] that shineth in a dark place
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; until the day day dawn and the day star
[1:51:34] rise in your hearts.
[1:51:37] Brother Brandham says it like this in
[1:51:39] God's wrapped gift.
[1:51:41] He said, "Precious Lord, there's many, a
[1:51:44] few women, some young girls that's
[1:51:46] raised their hands.
[1:51:48] They don't want to be condemned with the
[1:51:49] world. They want to receive you now at
[1:51:52] this Christmas time to look into God's
[1:51:54] package and receive eternal life."
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Grant it now, Lord, that you'll open to
[1:51:59] them the forgiveness of their sins. that
[1:52:01] you'll open to them a fountain in the
[1:52:04] house of David that's open for sin and
[1:52:06] uncleanliness where sinners plunge
[1:52:08] beneath the flood and lose all their
[1:52:10] guilty stains. Go home with them with
[1:52:13] them and abide with them tonight, Lord.
[1:52:15] Make life for them what it should be,
[1:52:18] Lord.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Go home with them. How many say, "Yes,
[1:52:21] Lord. Go home with me."
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Make life what it should be, Lord.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heal the sick and afflicted among
[1:52:30] us. You're the help of the helpless. I
[1:52:32] love that. Ye are he, Lord, who can do
[1:52:35] where others cannot do.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE ABIDING GRACE. You are the
[1:52:39] gift of God. And we humbly believe you,
[1:52:41] Lord. We follow the day star. We follow
[1:52:45] the light until it leads us to that
[1:52:48] perfect light, the gift of God, eternal
[1:52:51] life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:57] See, what the word does is lead us to
[1:53:01] that promise
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; of who he is.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; God with us,
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; God in us.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Emmanuel,
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; that portion of God, that which comes
[1:53:14] into your life and changes your life.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; I want you just to think of it here as
[1:53:22] as as I close within that.
[1:53:25] Many looked upon this. Even the
[1:53:27] shepherds that came, they looked.
[1:53:32] The angels had made aware to them of
[1:53:34] what they were to behold and see.
[1:53:38] And after it was done speaking,
[1:53:42] they gathered themselves and said, "Let
[1:53:45] us go see what the angels have
[1:53:47] proclaimed."
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; You know what they did? They accepted
[1:53:51] that word. Yes,
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; they believed that word and they acted
[1:53:56] upon it.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; It it it it was settled. They it now
[1:54:00] they were coming and you know the first
[1:54:02] thing they did when they got there is
[1:54:04] they worshiped.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; They they they worship
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; they begin to worship and that
[1:54:10] announcement that that was given. And I
[1:54:13] want you to find I want you to see it
[1:54:14] like this. This is where we look into
[1:54:17] our own lives like brother Brian if the
[1:54:18] musicians would come like brother Brian
[1:54:20] was leading us in that song before I
[1:54:22] came up here to minister and that song
[1:54:26] Lord let your word be born in the manger
[1:54:28] of my heart
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; let it live in me
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; that's why when we look into our lives
[1:54:34] the prophet said he said my my pilgrim
[1:54:37] brother and sister believe that sign
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; this end time this evening light look
[1:54:43] into the manger
[1:54:45] of your heart and see if you're able to
[1:54:48] say within yourself, see the sign that
[1:54:50] the shepherd's seen.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; God in flesh dwelling among the poor,
[1:54:55] the needy, the offcast.
[1:54:57] See if you can understand it. God in
[1:54:59] your heart, God in here. And watch and
[1:55:01] see if he manifest himself right in
[1:55:04] sweetness and meekness
[1:55:07] as he did.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; It's personal,
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; right? is to look into our own hearts.
[1:55:14] And let me just say, if if you can't be
[1:55:18] honest with God, you won't be honest
[1:55:20] with nobody.
[1:55:22] But to be honest with God, and you know,
[1:55:25] maybe in your life, you can look in your
[1:55:27] life and say, "I've not had that
[1:55:29] experience yet." But let me ask you this
[1:55:32] question.
[1:55:34] Have you seen
[1:55:36] the light? Have you have Have you
[1:55:38] recognized God, there's something
[1:55:41] there's something different?
[1:55:44] And if you've really recognized that
[1:55:45] there's something different here than
[1:55:48] what you've experienced other places,
[1:55:50] then here's what here's what to do. Say,
[1:55:52] "God,
[1:55:54] reveal yourself to me."
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Reveal yourself to
[1:55:59] me. Or brother, I want to surrender. I'm
[1:56:02] trying to help you.
[1:56:04] You sense his presence, something that's
[1:56:06] real. Now ask him to reveal himself to
[1:56:11] you. Lord, show me the father.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; And as you and then with that revealing
[1:56:20] and just now listen,
[1:56:23] you got to give yourself to it.
[1:56:25] Remember,
[1:56:27] Satan's going to try soon as soon as you
[1:56:28] even come out of these doors. What he's
[1:56:30] going to try to do, you know, when you
[1:56:32] take a you take a magnet, we did it when
[1:56:33] I taught fourth grade. You could take a
[1:56:35] magnet and if you took that magnet, I've
[1:56:38] got a whole study on it, but you pound
[1:56:40] that magnet, throw it on the floor,
[1:56:42] throw it on the floor, throw it on the
[1:56:43] floor, and pound it. You know what'll
[1:56:45] happen?
[1:56:48] The molecules start getting the
[1:56:50] arrangements and it's not as strong. You
[1:56:53] maybe could pick up
[1:56:56] 10 nails and you mess them. You mess
[1:57:00] those molecules around in there and
[1:57:01] they're not lined up.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; You may only be able to pick up three
[1:57:05] barely.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; So you say h how does that magnet get
[1:57:09] aligned? Well, this is what we would
[1:57:10] have to do. We would take it and I would
[1:57:11] teach we were teaching my kids on that.
[1:57:14] You take a another magnet, what they
[1:57:15] call a parent magnet. And you take that
[1:57:18] magnet and you rub it the way it should
[1:57:20] go.
[1:57:22] And when you rub it on that magnet the
[1:57:23] way it should go, it takes all of those
[1:57:25] those parts molecules that are out of
[1:57:27] line and it gets it lined up.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; See, that's what God that's what God
[1:57:34] does for us, friends.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Sometimes there's a hard trial. It'll
[1:57:37] literally knock the molecules in your
[1:57:39] life. It'll it'll send you around in a
[1:57:41] spin and you and you DON'T YOU'RE NOT AS
[1:57:42] STRONG AS YOU YOU WAS ONCE AND ONE TIME
[1:57:44] YET. THE HOLY SPIRIT HASN'T LEFT YOU.
[1:57:47] BUT what it is, sometimes we get a
[1:57:48] little bit out of line. Maybe we have
[1:57:50] from the trial or the test we get out of
[1:57:52] line. Our our prayer life gets a little
[1:57:53] weak. Our our attitude or our feet all
[1:57:56] these other things. It gets a little bit
[1:57:57] out of line. But isn't it isn't it isn't
[1:57:58] it tremendous how just coming in the
[1:58:00] presence of God and the great parent
[1:58:02] magnet begins to come down on our life.
[1:58:04] He begins to bring his word and he
[1:58:06] begins to line up our life and we begin
[1:58:08] to find strength coming back in our
[1:58:10] life. Hallelujah. You know what it is?
[1:58:12] You're becoming reacquainted with the
[1:58:13] God who's already in the manger.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. becoming reacquainted with
[1:58:18] the God who is already dwelling there on
[1:58:20] the inside.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Now listen,
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; he wants to be the Lord of all.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; He wants to be the Lord of all.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; So ask him to reveal himself.
[1:58:34] So God, make yourself real. Don't don't
[1:58:36] get in a hurry and don't look at nobody
[1:58:38] else. Just ask him. Lord, like the
[1:58:40] angels came to the shepherds, I'm one of
[1:58:43] your shepherds, Lord. Lord, send your
[1:58:46] messengers to me, Lord.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Send the angels to me, Lord. Will you
[1:58:50] say angels? Oh, yes. All the way through
[1:58:52] the New Testament. Oh, yeah.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. All the way through the Old
[1:58:55] Yes. Yes. Lord. Lord, reveal yourself to
[1:58:58] me. God God knows how to get the message
[1:59:00] to you.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; See, when you what you you know what
[1:59:02] you're doing when you're saying that?
[1:59:03] You're embracing.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; You're opening your heart to it. Lord,
[1:59:07] reveal yourself to me. And then as he
[1:59:10] reveals and you find that word just, you
[1:59:12] know what the word begins to do? It's
[1:59:13] like
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; it begin to draw you in. What do you got
[1:59:20] ON THE OTHER END OF THAT? AIN'T a
[1:59:21] minnow.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; I like walleye, but it ain't a walleye.
[1:59:27] What do you think that is?
[1:59:29] Seems like by the response it's a
[1:59:31] rainbow trout. [laughter]
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:35] It
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; just seems to be just kind of, you know,
[1:59:37] taking in the word. And you know what it
[1:59:40] is? It's Christ. This is what he did in
[1:59:42] Luke 24. He was gathering.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Was gathering. Don't allow the enemy to
[1:59:48] knock the things out of you.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; You You're going to have to fight,
[1:59:50] friends.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; And I know we're all we're all in
[1:59:52] different places here. This is not what
[1:59:55] I'm speaking here of just, oh, surrender
[1:59:57] your heart to God and receive the Holy
[1:59:59] Ghost. That that's that is the most
[2:00:01] important thing. But that's not what I'm
[2:00:02] that's that if that's all you heard
[2:00:03] today, you've not heard at all. I'm
[2:00:06] speaking to every one of us.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Because once he's been born in in the in
[2:00:11] the manger of your heart,
[2:00:13] he can't stay a baby in the manger.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; He's got to He's got to grow.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Before other things can BE PRESENTED TO
[2:00:24] HIM, he's got to grow.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; Got to go from a baby to a young child.
[2:00:28] Come on now. I can't go there anymore.
[2:00:30] BUT HE'S GOT TO HE'S GOT TO GROW. AND
[2:00:32] THEN THAT'S WHY THE WORD, THERE'S PARTS
[2:00:34] OF THE WORD NOW as you're taking in the
[2:00:36] word, my it's it's changing you.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; You're looking in a mirror and saying,
[2:00:40] "Man, I'm not wow. Wow." And you know
[2:00:43] the things that God's doing, it's
[2:00:44] greater than any miracle.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; The greatest miracle is a new birth.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; But the miracle that God is changing
[2:00:51] your character for you to even recognize
[2:00:53] and submit to it and then for his
[2:00:55] overcoming grace to work in your life,
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; what a miracle. Because you know why
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; that can never be taken away from you.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord?
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:08] I want to go all the way.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; I want to embrace
[2:01:12] deity. I want to as the prophet said,
[2:01:16] his return to this earth will be a
[2:01:18] welcoming
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; of the spirit.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; I want I want my heart the cry to be
[2:01:25] welcome Holy Spirit. Welcome Holy
[2:01:28] Spirit.
[2:01:29] So ask God here this morning, friends.
[2:01:31] Let be very serious. Be very honest with
[2:01:34] God and ask God, Lord, make yourself
[2:01:37] real because
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; when he begins to reveal himself, it'll
[2:01:42] affect your walk. It'll it'll start
[2:01:44] affecting decisions you're making in
[2:01:46] life. It'll affect it'll affect
[2:01:50] everything. Start affecting choices in
[2:01:52] your life.
[2:01:55] And then from there say, "God, vindicate
[2:01:59] this in my heart.
[2:02:02] Vindicate it. Make it real, Lord. Make
[2:02:05] it positive in me
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; that I'm a part of it, Lord."
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; But it all starts with revelation.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said,
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; "You can never overemphasize
[2:02:18] the importance of revelation."
[2:02:22] And a closing statement in that portion
[2:02:25] of the book, he says, "May God give us a
[2:02:29] fresh revelation
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; and by that revelation, we become the
[2:02:35] living word of God made manifest."
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? No longer
[2:02:41] God in a manger.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; It's God in you.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; It's God in you. God wants to be fully
[2:02:49] in each of our lives. Let's say Lord
[2:02:52] welcome Holy Spirit.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. Heavenly Father,
[2:03:00] oh
[2:03:02] how we
[2:03:04] Lord in our hearts are so appreciative
[2:03:08] for your grace that Lord that you have
[2:03:10] extended to our lives. Thank you Lord.
[2:03:14] Lord, so much has been
[2:03:17] said. So much Lord, you've spoke to our
[2:03:19] hearts. And Lord, bringing it down that
[2:03:23] your desire is to reflect what the
[2:03:26] prophet called the original sign, the
[2:03:29] eternal sign, the super sign.
[2:03:33] That's the promise. God with us, God in
[2:03:38] us, God reflecting his own life through
[2:03:40] us.
[2:03:43] Oh Lord Jesus,
[2:03:46] would you just Lord hear this morning
[2:03:49] maybe out of John 14 there were those
[2:03:52] who said yeah that's me Lord they were
[2:03:56] Lord your prophet
[2:04:00] I've never got over this and Jehovah
[2:04:03] Gyra Grass Valley
[2:04:06] he made this statement he says Lord I
[2:04:09] have seen such honesty among these
[2:04:11] people.
[2:04:13] He said,
[2:04:15] "It's no telling what you can do where
[2:04:18] there's honest hearts."
[2:04:22] Lord, we're in the presence
[2:04:26] of our heavenly father.
[2:04:29] You're here to change
[2:04:32] change our thoughts, change our lives.
[2:04:36] Maybe there's one here this morning that
[2:04:38] say, "Lord, that's me. Show us the
[2:04:41] father. Show me, Lord. Let let me let
[2:04:44] let me see it.
[2:04:46] Let it Let let me see, Lord. What I What
[2:04:49] I know is real. What I sense it's more.
[2:04:51] Let Let me see you, Lord. Oh, God,
[2:04:54] reveal yourself to me.
[2:05:00] And Lord,
[2:05:03] as you would reveal yourself, Lord, may
[2:05:05] you come and vindicate your word in me.
[2:05:09] vindicated through my life.
[2:05:12] Lord, as your prophet, as he said it
[2:05:17] to that little sister who was troubled,
[2:05:21] where an evil spirit was trying to
[2:05:23] anoint her mind to tell her that she was
[2:05:27] not able to completely surrender.
[2:05:30] And the prophet said, "It's just an evil
[2:05:32] spirit that wants to anoint your
[2:05:34] thinking."
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; But he says,
[2:05:39] you haven't or else you would not even
[2:05:41] have have you wouldn't even desire that.
[2:05:44] But he said, "Here's what to do. Say,
[2:05:47] Lord,
[2:05:49] I give my all to you.
[2:05:52] All that I am, just as I am, I give
[2:05:56] myself completely to you." We trust you,
[2:06:00] Lord. It's you. We're in the presence of
[2:06:03] Elohim. Amen.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; We're in the presence of our malesc.
[2:06:08] We're in the presence
[2:06:11] of the deity
[2:06:13] of almighty God. We're in your presence,
[2:06:16] Lord.
[2:06:18] I pray, heavenly father, for every need.
[2:06:20] There's some of your children, Lord,
[2:06:22] that even are not here. They're they're
[2:06:24] battling sickness. Others
[2:06:27] may be here this morning and they're
[2:06:30] Lord our
[2:06:32] it's like they add the monu molecules
[2:06:34] have been knocked around
[2:06:37] but Lord would you come the great parent
[2:06:39] magnet you're here
[2:06:42] Lord God may you just I pray just take
[2:06:45] Lord and just line everything back up
[2:06:48] maybe just Lord even sweeping across
[2:06:50] hearts and lives that maybe even the
[2:06:53] enemy Lord would want to try
[2:06:55] Lord, condemn them for even Lord, maybe
[2:06:58] the way that maybe they've they've went
[2:07:00] about or lived or Lord, maybe a lack of
[2:07:03] faithfulness, Lord. But I pray right
[2:07:04] now, Father, may the light of God spring
[2:07:07] up, Lord, right where they're at. and
[2:07:10] Father to to declare and move upon their
[2:07:13] hearts to let them see your care for
[2:07:15] their lives,
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; your care for each of our lives, Lord,
[2:07:20] oh God, to lead us, Lord, into that
[2:07:22] place of real stability. And I pray,
[2:07:25] God,
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; just come through our lives, Lord.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; We want to be lined up completely with
[2:07:30] you, Lord.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; We want to be lined up with you. We want
[2:07:34] our lives, Lord. It's an individual
[2:07:36] affair. We want to be lined up, Lord
[2:07:38] God. Maybe the cares of life, maybe the
[2:07:41] trials, maybe things, Lord, have tried
[2:07:43] to just knock things out of us, Lord.
[2:07:45] But I pray here this morning as we're in
[2:07:47] your presence.
[2:07:49] There's just an alignment that's taking
[2:07:51] place. And it all begins even from our
[2:07:54] heart to say, "Yes, Lord." The mind
[2:07:58] accepts the word, then it's believed in
[2:08:01] the heart, and then it moves throughout
[2:08:04] the body. Grant, Lord, set every heart,
[2:08:08] Lord. right in line. Set every one of
[2:08:10] our thoughts. Set everything all about
[2:08:12] us, Lord. And Father, even as we're
[2:08:14] standing here in this this Christmas
[2:08:16] season, Lord,
[2:08:19] Lord, we reflect back upon some of these
[2:08:22] points and these places, but
[2:08:25] Lord, we're thankful every day of the
[2:08:28] year
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; because Lord, if you had not become one
[2:08:32] of us,
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; where would we be, Lord? Amen.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; But that's that super sign. You became
[2:08:42] one of us.
[2:08:44] That original sign that every son and
[2:08:46] daughter of God
[2:08:48] would have that same life.
[2:08:51] Lord, I want to say thank you. I want to
[2:08:54] say thank you, Lord, that you came. I
[2:08:57] want to say thank you, Father, that
[2:09:01] you bore our infirmities.
[2:09:04] I want to say thank you that you bore
[2:09:06] our stripes. I want to say thank you for
[2:09:09] taking the crown of thorns from my mind
[2:09:11] battles. I want to say thank you father.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; for Lord Jesus for all that you have
[2:09:18] done. You are our complete atonement
[2:09:21] Lord.
[2:09:23] Thank you Lord Jesus. And thank you for
[2:09:27] sending back the Holy Ghost. [music]
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. which is not another person but
[2:09:31] it's the same God. Thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you Father for coming into our
[2:09:37] hearts.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[2:09:41] I love how your prophet takes that about
[2:09:43] a manger. He says it was a a filthy
[2:09:46] place,
[2:09:48] a place that was unfit for a king to be
[2:09:50] born.
[2:09:53] And he ties that right into where our
[2:09:54] lives were. Our lives were a stinking
[2:09:56] mess.
[2:09:59] But you came.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord,
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; we couldn't straighten our lives up,
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; but you came, Lord,
[2:10:11] you come to us, Lord. And Father,
[2:10:17] we worship you, Lord.
[2:10:20] May every one of us, Lord, that are
[2:10:21] gathered here, those that would be
[2:10:23] streaming over our archive, may every
[2:10:25] one of us, Lord, be able to look in
[2:10:28] and to behold in our own lives the
[2:10:30] promise of the word for this hour.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you for what you did in
[2:10:41] Brother Brandham, but that was only to
[2:10:42] point
[2:10:44] your desire to live in a people.
[2:10:47] Well, not to do the same things that
[2:10:48] brother Brandt that Lord that the
[2:10:50] ministry was for that purpose. It was
[2:10:52] the prophet himself was a sign, but it
[2:10:56] was to call us into union with you.
[2:11:00] Lord, I thank you, Father. I thank you,
[2:11:03] Lord, that you've anointed our eyes to
[2:11:04] see.
[2:11:06] Now, Lord God, I pray right here this
[2:11:08] morning. I'm asking God for your
[2:11:10] protection upon every heart, Lord, as
[2:11:13] this word has been delivered here, Lord.
[2:11:16] How the enemy would like to try to knock
[2:11:17] it out, but I pray, Father, there's
[2:11:20] hearts, Lord, that God, that you would,
[2:11:22] you've touched and spoken to and are
[2:11:25] just saying, "I don't want to be a
[2:11:26] sympathizer. I want to be one with this
[2:11:29] word. I want to be one with this message
[2:11:32] that the anointing is with me as it is
[2:11:34] with others. I want to be one." Grant
[2:11:38] it, Lord. I pray, God, your protection,
[2:11:41] Lord, over their hearts and their lives.
[2:11:44] May you, Lord, as they take this word,
[2:11:46] may you, may you go with them, Lord,
[2:11:50] and may that light lead them to that
[2:11:54] perfect light,
[2:11:56] Lord, to the day star, till that Lord
[2:11:58] has so rose in their hearts to where
[2:12:03] death has passed away. It's a passing
[2:12:07] unto life. Their lives have been
[2:12:10] changed, but they're they're seeing that
[2:12:12] change, Lord. Grant it, Lord. And for
[2:12:15] every one of us, Lord,
[2:12:17] changing from glory unto glory,
[2:12:21] Lord, there's things in our character,
[2:12:23] my my,
[2:12:25] as we, Lord, journey
[2:12:28] up the stature of a perfect man.
[2:12:32] This is our mountain. Like Caleb said,
[2:12:34] give me my mountain.
[2:12:37] This is our mountain.
[2:12:39] Giants on this mountain, but give me my
[2:12:42] mountain.
[2:12:44] Oh Lord, we thank you for your mercy.
[2:12:48] God, may our faith increase,
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; virtue, our patience, knowledge,
[2:12:54] temperance, brotherly kindness. Oh God,
[2:12:58] grant it, Lord,
[2:13:00] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:13:03] Won't you love him?
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Just appreciate him. Brother Brian, lead
[2:13:09] us, brother, if you don't mind.

[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we've not we've not come to
[2:24:41] a manger.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the east.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; We have seen the supernatural light
[2:24:50] arise.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; We have witnessed Christ reflected
[2:24:55] through Malachi 4. Amen.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; And that reflection through Malachi 4
[2:24:59] lets us know who we are.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; That's what gave us the courage
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; like the 7,000 to stand up and say, "God
[2:25:06] is still God.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; The promise is mine."
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; So, we're not just we're not looking
[2:25:11] back to what God did through Brother
[2:25:13] Brandham. Now, what we're seeing is
[2:25:16] Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; What we're doing, we're not we're
[2:25:20] worshiping Christ. We're seeing Christ
[2:25:22] in his bride body. Emmanuel, the eternal
[2:25:26] sign,
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; the super sign.
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; Because it's God living out his life
[2:25:32] through you and I to where you are not
[2:25:35] your own. You belong to him.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; And you realize it's not I that liveth,
[2:25:40] but it's Christ that liveth in me. Oh,
[2:25:42] come let us adore him.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Not I that liveth, but Christ that
[2:25:46] liveth in me.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. So, we're not
[2:25:50] worshiping Christ in a manger. It's
[2:25:52] Christ in our heart.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. We're worshiping the
[2:25:57] living God. Now, let me tell you, YOU
[2:25:59] MIGHT WORSHIP HIM FOR SAVING YOU FROM
[2:26:01] your sins, BUT KEEP WORSHIPING HIM.
[2:26:04] WORSHIP HIM UNTIL HE CLEANSES YOU AND
[2:26:06] SANCTIFIES YOU. KEEP WORSHIPING HIM
[2:26:08] UNTIL HE FEELS YOU. KEEP WORSHIPING HIM
[2:26:10] BECAUSE HE ALONE is worthy. He has made
[2:26:13] unto us redemption, sanctification,
[2:26:16] wisdom, all things.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:19] Hallelujah. Do you love him?
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many could say amen? This word
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; has power, has power, has glory, has
[2:26:28] authority.
[2:26:30] [applause and cheering]
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; EMBRACE THIS DEITY. THE DEITY OF JESUS
[2:26:33] CHRIST. EMBRACE THE HOLY GHOST. EMBRACE
[2:26:36] THE WORD made flesh.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; And now you are the word
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; made flesh in this hour. Amen.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; You want to know why God sent the
[2:26:47] message?
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; This is why God sent the message.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; When you stop and think just for a
[2:26:56] moment how the message found you, you'd
[2:26:58] think it's a paradox. How did the
[2:27:00] message find me? How did it ever make it
[2:27:02] to my doorstep? How did it ever get to
[2:27:03] me? How did it ever come across my path?
[2:27:05] It's because God came looking for you.
[2:27:08] AMEN.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT LITTLE
[2:27:12] EAGLE.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; You might HAVE BEEN IN A CHICKEN YARD,
[2:27:16] but he knew you were always his. And
[2:27:19] that's why the word, this word means
[2:27:21] something to you that's different from
[2:27:24] anything else. THIS WORD HAS AN EFFECT
[2:27:27] ON YOU THAT YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM
[2:27:30] BECAUSE IT'S THE INSPIRATION [screaming]
[2:27:32] OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THIS HOUR. IT'S
[2:27:35] EMMANUEL, God with us.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, I worship him for CHANGING LIVES.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; I WORSHIP HIM FOR CHANGING MY LIFE. I
[2:27:46] WORSHIP HIM FOR CHANGING my character. I
[2:27:49] worship him.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; My goodness. GLORY BE TO GOD.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD JESUS.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; WHAT A PARADOX.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; WHAT GRACE HAS COME TO US. AMEN.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AS SEVEN ANGELS CAME TO THE
[2:28:07] PROPHET, THE ANGELS OF GOD THAT
[2:28:09] ACCOMPANIED THIS MESSAGE HAVE COME TO
[2:28:11] STIR OUR HEARTS AND DRAW US INTO
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; THIS WORD.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful?
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Say, "How did I get here?"
[2:28:26] The same angel that beat Eleazar there a
[2:28:28] half hour
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; before he got there and began to stir
[2:28:31] Rebecca's heart. God has the angels
[2:28:34] dispatched in this hour.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "You could
[2:28:38] sit here hearing the word preach." And
[2:28:39] he said, "You're hearing this. You
[2:28:40] really, you really ought to surrender.
[2:28:42] You really ought to." He said, "What
[2:28:43] that is is an angel nudging you."
[2:28:47] [laughter]
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. May we take this word with us.
[2:28:58] Embrace.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; It's worth fighting for.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. It's worth fighting, battling
[2:29:03] through, not fighting your neighbor.
[2:29:05] It's worth fighting your own will.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; It's worth PRESSING THROUGH. IT'S WORTH
[2:29:09] IT because that barrier is only a sound
[2:29:11] barrier. You can get beyond that
[2:29:12] barrier, you're sailing free.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; But that barrier self and say, Lord, I'm
[2:29:17] going to take your word and let the word
[2:29:19] bring down the walls of Jericho.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take your word and let the
[2:29:22] walls fall.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Why? He's Emanuel. He's
[2:29:28] God with us.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:29:31] Amen. I love you in the Lord.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't God so good to us?
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you. May God be with you
[2:29:41] even as you go with your families. I say
[2:29:43] to you again, merry Christmas. And may
[2:29:45] God bless you. Amen. May God's blessings
[2:29:47] be upon you. Lord willing, we'll we
[2:29:49] don't have service here on Thursday, but
[2:29:50] we be here on Sunday and uh look a
[2:29:54] little bit more at this. Amen. But God
[2:29:56] is so good, ain't he?
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; So good. [snorts] So good. Amen. God
[2:30:00] bless you. Amen. Greet one another in
[2:30:02] Christian Christian love. And it's been
[2:30:04] so good to be together. Amen. Lead us
