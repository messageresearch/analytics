[41:13] Hallelujah
[41:14] glory be to God
[41:17] Hallelujah amen let's turn in our bibles
[41:20] if we could to Job chapter 22 and
[41:24] it's just so good to be in the house of
[41:26] the Lord tonight
[41:28] good to be gathered together
[41:32] and I'm just going to read a couple
[41:34] verse of scripture before we allow you
[41:36] to or ask you to be seated
[41:43] you want to just read just those first
[41:45] two verses where we've just been drawing
[41:46] from
[41:48] on the thought of a useful life
[41:54] and here as in verse 1 this is one of
[41:57] the one of job's friends and
[42:01] as he speaks and he says in verse 2
[42:06] a question is presented can a man be
[42:08] profitable unto God
[42:10] as he that is wise may be profitable
[42:14] unto himself may God bless you bless the
[42:18] reading of the word as you're being
[42:19] seated
[42:21] we look at this thought of a
[42:24] of a useful life and taking into
[42:27] account when we're looking at job's life
[42:30] and
[42:31] as we've referred you to a quote that
[42:35] we've read from many times and I just
[42:37] just to refer to that of where much of
[42:42] the inspiration and where a lot of it
[42:44] come from is how that
[42:46] brother Branham words it in a manner
[42:48] that job's life he knew that his life
[42:51] had influenced people
[42:53] and he also was one that as brother
[42:56] Brandon would take in that quote and
[42:58] admonish us that he had been a useful
[43:00] life and I tell you when it all comes
[43:02] down to it there's a lot of things that
[43:05] we can do
[43:06] but if what it's all all that matters is
[43:10] what we've done for the Lord
[43:13] a person an individual we could have a
[43:16] lot of accolades a lot of things that
[43:18] we've accomplished
[43:20] but all of that is not going to matter
[43:22] in the end what's going to matter
[43:25] is what we've done for the Lord
[43:28] that's because we're here in this Earth
[43:30] for one purpose and that's to serve God
[43:34] we're here in this purpose Solomon would
[43:37] lay it out over and over that the
[43:39] beginning of wisdom is to fear the lord
[43:42] is to reverence him and to serve him
[43:44] and that's the whole purpose that our
[43:46] lives that as we come here that where
[43:48] lives would be dramatized by the spirit
[43:50] of God and that we would serve the
[43:53] purpose that God has called us to serve
[43:56] and everything and every time that what
[43:59] God calls you and I to do
[44:01] when God makes the call Upon Our Lives
[44:04] we certainly never feel like that we're
[44:06] capable of doing it and that's all part
[44:09] of the program of God because if we ever
[44:11] felt like that we could do anything then
[44:14] right away we know that we're not the
[44:16] instrument that God's chosen because
[44:18] every man who ever thought he could once
[44:20] he got in the prince of God then all of
[44:23] his weaknesses all of the inabilities
[44:25] everything begin to come out of him all
[44:28] of the reasons he could say Lord you
[44:31] just passed me on over go to this person
[44:33] brother Brown remember when the angel of
[44:35] the Lord spoke to him and told him this
[44:37] is what's going to be you were born for
[44:39] this purpose and on and on and went
[44:41] through all these things and brother
[44:42] Brown remember he told him he says I
[44:44] told him I will not be able to do this
[44:47] but notice what notice what the Lord did
[44:50] the Lord did not set there to confer or
[44:54] to reason or to debate with the prophet
[44:56] God just brings his word because it's
[44:59] his word that dismantles all fear and
[45:02] brings a trust and a confidence in him
[45:04] that's how God does it you know God
[45:06] doesn't you know as we would maybe try
[45:08] to you know say to one another oh yes
[45:10] this and yet but God has a way and I
[45:13] think that's such an example that we can
[45:14] always base because that's what faith is
[45:17] always based upon and should be what
[45:19] real true faith is based on the word of
[45:21] God and I just say it like this when you
[45:23] think of being an influence that's a
[45:25] that's a pretty big word in the hour we
[45:27] live in you know where people being
[45:29] influencers you know on uh in the
[45:32] internet and so forth and I realize for
[45:34] some of us that are older I the only
[45:36] reason I know that term is because I
[45:38] have had to study some of those things
[45:39] when I go to minister to young people
[45:41] and I begin to look at certain things
[45:43] that are out there in the present and
[45:44] and that's a that's a really high
[45:47] industry to be an influencer to try to
[45:49] influence people in a certain way but
[45:52] you know I think when it all comes down
[45:54] to it I wonder how many of them just
[45:56] like Elvis Presley will give an account
[45:58] of how they've influenced lives because
[46:01] remember we we're influencing lives
[46:03] whether we like it or not and I I tell
[46:06] you if there's one thing we want to be
[46:07] is we want to be an influence that
[46:09] influences people to Jesus Christ that's
[46:12] what we want to be that's the greatest
[46:14] thing that we can ever be in our life
[46:16] and that's what Joby was useful to the
[46:18] program of God and I say we think of
[46:21] this thought a useful life and as you
[46:24] look at where job is at In This Moment
[46:26] The Very things that job was
[46:28] experiencing in this trial that he was
[46:32] going through even where his friends and
[46:34] the accusation accusations are being
[46:37] made in all those things everything
[46:39] itself everything that God permits is
[46:43] with a purpose
[46:44] and God's purpose was in it is that job
[46:47] would become even more useful
[46:50] job had a testimony before this he had
[46:53] been a useful he had been a useful
[46:55] vessel unto God he had been useful to
[46:58] the rest to many others he had
[46:59] instructed others he had comforted
[47:01] others he had ministered to them who
[47:04] were weak in their life job was a useful
[47:07] vessel unto God in that hour to
[47:10] influence lives and hearts to God and
[47:13] you know when we see it in the scripture
[47:15] job was used in many in many different
[47:18] ways and I believe that speaks to how
[47:20] that the holy spirit will use and work
[47:23] through a many-membered body because it
[47:26] all comes down to it there's no big eyes
[47:28] or little use it's all Christ's
[47:30] ministering in his body
[47:32] so when it all when we look at it
[47:34] brother Brown will make certain
[47:35] statements throughout when he talks
[47:37] about job and he says job was not being
[47:40] chastened of God and what God God was
[47:43] not correcting job job had not done
[47:45] wrong but what God was doing and you
[47:48] hear the prophet bring this out time and
[47:50] time again he was purging job so that he
[47:54] might bring forth more fruit it's just
[47:56] like on a fruit tree an inspector goes
[47:59] out or who takes care of those trees
[48:01] they have to cut those trees in such a
[48:04] way you know it's just like maybe maybe
[48:06] you and your Landscaping at home you
[48:08] know maybe you've went out and you
[48:09] thought boy I'm really going to do a
[48:11] number and you did a number on those
[48:12] bushes you did a number on everything as
[48:14] a matter of fact you did a number where
[48:16] the only thing left to do is cut it all
[48:18] down you've butchered it up is that
[48:20] right we've been there in those times I
[48:22] remember one time you know I worked on
[48:24] the when we moved into the house we're
[48:26] in now and I seen that weeping cherry
[48:28] tree and my wife she keep pulled in the
[48:30] driveway and she looked at it and I had
[48:31] never cared for you know I just thought
[48:33] this thing is hanging down every which
[48:35] way and you know it looked like I gave
[48:37] it a it looked like I gave it a Beatles
[48:38] haircut when it was done and my wife she
[48:40] pulled up in the driveway I knew without
[48:42] her saying anything just by how she
[48:44] looked I had messed up
[48:47] would help to fight a rat about that
[48:49] weeping cherry tree before I did it so
[48:51] you know what I did for every year since
[48:53] I do the best thing I can do honey I'll
[48:56] hold it I'll put the oil on the trimmer
[48:58] and you can trim it
[49:07] the purging itself is to remove suckers
[49:10] it's to remove uh things that could be
[49:14] of a hindrance in order that life in
[49:16] order that more fruit would come forth
[49:18] purging is not a correction purging is
[49:21] not a disciplining purging is removing
[49:24] so that more of that life can be
[49:27] displayed
[49:28] and that's the same way Brother Brad
[49:30] will also make a statement regarding job
[49:32] I love this statement he said what God
[49:34] was doing in that time was he was
[49:37] actually going to bring out the
[49:39] qualities of a believer that was in job
[49:42] and God knows how to bring out the
[49:44] qualities that are in you and I
[49:46] sometimes we think the qualities would
[49:49] maybe come out when we're on a
[49:50] Mountaintop but yet in reality the real
[49:53] qualities are actually born and come
[49:55] forth in that of the valley so when we
[49:58] would think of it and we would say I
[50:00] want to be more useful I'm sure that we
[50:02] would never equate or think of a trial
[50:04] as that which would afford you and I to
[50:08] become more useful into the hands of God
[50:11] brother Brahm says this in the message
[50:13] of prisoners is one of the last before
[50:15] he prays and he says what God to my
[50:18] opinion will do and must do and will do
[50:21] in this last day is to find a tool for
[50:25] the Harvest he's got to find a tool tool
[50:29] to thrash the floor now remember what
[50:32] he's dealing with is what will separate
[50:34] seed from chaff
[50:37] so brother bams opened this service on a
[50:40] prisoner and he opens it and brother
[50:43] Bram will even give the example of how
[50:46] that our lives living in the world with
[50:49] the light of God shining forth is to be
[50:52] a witness is to be a display is to be a
[50:56] declaration that Jesus Christ is the
[50:59] same yesterday today and forever that
[51:02] that's what this message came to do and
[51:05] produce is Christ in The Believer
[51:10] to open up that true that pathway that
[51:13] Clarity to where it's Christ dwelling
[51:15] within within the life Christ expressing
[51:18] himself through our lives and so to
[51:21] recognize of even when we see it that
[51:23] Jesus could say you know I I'm in the
[51:26] world but I'm not of the world and
[51:28] that's how when you think of it brother
[51:29] Bramble kind of used the example in the
[51:31] beginning of this message of how that
[51:33] you could put oil many of probably the
[51:35] sisters could think of this when you put
[51:37] oil in water oil does not mix with water
[51:40] it separates you can see it on the stove
[51:43] and brother Branham Likens that to the
[51:45] believer in the midst of this age it is
[51:47] to be that which dwells in the age yet
[51:50] it is separated from the world and so we
[51:55] look at our lives that oil amongst all
[51:58] of the water of the multitude and it's
[52:00] by Christ it's not our doings that we
[52:04] have separated ourselves we haven't made
[52:06] ourselves odd or different remember the
[52:09] warning of the Holy Spirit through the
[52:11] prophet when he preaches the seventh
[52:12] seal he says don't make yourself on
[52:18] we can preach on that a month or Sundays
[52:20] it just comes on it's not something that
[52:22] we have to make ourselves anything
[52:25] all we have to do is submit and
[52:28] surrender ourselves to God God makes out
[52:31] of us what he's ordained and
[52:34] predestinated
[52:36] so it's to be a tool to thrash the floor
[52:39] any farmer when he goes to his Harvest
[52:42] he has to have a tool to do it with
[52:44] certainly he's got to have a sharp
[52:46] sickle or something some instrument to
[52:48] thrash out the Grain and the Harvest is
[52:51] right I want you to catch that a tool or
[52:54] an instrument now notice God take us in
[52:57] your hand make us Bond Servants of Your
[53:01] Love use us for tool to bring the
[53:05] realization to this sinful cursed Earth
[53:08] that we're living in today that Jesus
[53:11] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[53:14] forever now what shall he says this this
[53:16] is here an instrument a tool that's
[53:19] speaking for myself God let me be a
[53:23] prisoner yeah
[53:27] if all my brethren turned me down
[53:31] if all my friends turned me down
[53:35] I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[53:38] and his word that I might be harnessed
[53:42] to his word by the Holy Spirit to see
[53:45] the Holy Spirit make the word of God be
[53:47] confirmed by the same things he said
[53:49] would be done I want to be a prisoner of
[53:53] Jesus Christ
[53:55] now the prophet speaking this here in 63
[53:58] he's already experienced a lot of
[54:01] misunderstanding concerning the gift in
[54:04] his life
[54:05] he's experienced that he's experienced
[54:07] criticism he's even already experienced
[54:10] when his Pastor Dr best of that told him
[54:14] Hey listen you need to forget all that
[54:16] stuff that's nothing but of the devil is
[54:19] that right and brother Brandon remember
[54:21] he himself prayed I don't want to see
[54:22] this no more I don't want the other one
[54:24] anymore of these whatever you call them
[54:25] these spells and things like that
[54:27] because it's what he thought he was but
[54:29] notice God had a purpose
[54:33] and God's purpose could not be defeated
[54:36] though he wasn't under a teaching at
[54:39] that time or Ministry that could open
[54:42] him to a place to have faith in the way
[54:45] God was wanting to deal with him yet
[54:48] God's purpose can't be defeated
[54:52] are you hearing me
[54:53] so notice here he has God meets with him
[54:57] in a personal way and notice what the
[54:59] Holy Spirit does it makes sense of
[55:02] what's taking place by the word and it
[55:05] tells him don't pay any attention to
[55:07] those ministers to those preachers now
[55:09] the Holy Spirit never tore them down but
[55:11] I want you to catch this here once God
[55:14] speaks and confirms his word to your
[55:16] life
[55:18] are you hearing me now that's where we
[55:21] stand in that place and renounce every
[55:24] other tongue that has spoke contrary to
[55:28] that
[55:29] when God's deal with your heart when
[55:32] God's calling your life when God's
[55:34] moving upon your heart it's God that's
[55:36] doing that what do I do renounce every
[55:39] other lying tongue that has said
[55:42] anything against the word of God
[55:44] concerning your life
[55:46] it's God that's bringing clarity
[55:54] we talk about worthiness certainly
[55:56] worthiness nobody would have chose based
[55:59] on worthiness
[56:01] brother Branham and the family he come
[56:03] out of
[56:05] nobody would have chose that
[56:08] but you see it just goes to show how we
[56:10] as people are
[56:12] you hearing me open the same I'm a
[56:14] Christian you still got your Humanity
[56:18] sometimes the things that sometimes the
[56:20] things that people can get to looking at
[56:22] and they and they think the token and oh
[56:24] and I believe the token produces right
[56:26] dressing I believe the token produces
[56:28] things of you know and and and different
[56:31] things oh they carry the Bible oh they
[56:32] they love the message but I believe it
[56:34] produces a life
[56:36] I'm not just looking at what's out here
[56:39] some friends I've been around the block
[56:40] too many times I've seen too many things
[56:42] I've been through too many prayer lines
[56:44] I've been through too many things that's
[56:45] why it's not just out here that I look
[56:47] at and say hey it's all right
[56:52] God knows what's there and it's God
[56:54] moving upon lives and hearts God never
[56:57] comes to shame anybody he comes to bring
[57:00] Deliverance
[57:04] Hallelujah so I say it like this notice
[57:08] this was a familiar scripture to us and
[57:11] where the disciples remember there had
[57:13] already been a question uh from the
[57:15] mother of the sons of Zebedee a good
[57:17] requests let one sit on the right let
[57:19] one stand on the left and Jesus goes
[57:21] through and he answers that his answer
[57:23] calls his indignation to rise among
[57:27] these who are with him
[57:29] and and you know then they begin to come
[57:32] under you know that that of a gentile
[57:34] spirit and well you know who's going to
[57:37] be the greatest and all this reasoning
[57:39] and and things like that and and you
[57:41] would think my goodness that couldn't be
[57:42] could that be among the revealed word
[57:45] could that be among where the son of man
[57:47] is at could that be among where that was
[57:49] working it was working right there sure
[57:52] yeah
[57:53] but notice whosoever verse 26 will be
[57:57] great among you let him be your minister
[57:59] that servant
[58:02] whosoever will be Chief among you let
[58:05] him be your servant even as he lays a
[58:08] pattern here as the son of man came not
[58:11] to be ministered unto but to minister
[58:15] and to give his life a ransom for many
[58:19] I want you to think of his testimony how
[58:22] God operated through the body of Jesus
[58:25] Christ
[58:26] he could say I can do nothing but what I
[58:30] see the father doing
[58:34] he can also say I've not come to do my
[58:37] own will
[58:38] but I've come to do the will of him that
[58:40] sent me
[58:42] is a declaration that that is being made
[58:45] so his coming in his life was not about
[58:47] himself
[58:49] didn't have a place to lay his head
[58:52] he had nothing
[58:55] he didn't come for himself
[58:58] everything he went through when he
[59:00] ministered to the needs of others
[59:03] brother Branham will pull out of that
[59:04] the prince of the House of David and he
[59:07] pulls out of that writing of how that
[59:09] when when the woman you remember she had
[59:11] her son who was in the beer which is you
[59:13] know that which they carry the body in
[59:15] for a funeral procession and remember
[59:18] when the Lord Jesus he was moved with
[59:19] compassion he spoke and that young man
[59:22] was raised to life and brother Brahm
[59:24] says it's recorded in the scriptures of
[59:26] then after that or he didn't say in the
[59:28] scripture he said it's just recorded he
[59:29] said maybe it's not exactly true or so
[59:32] forth but he said it's something to
[59:33] think about where he goes over and he
[59:36] would set on a rock and groan in himself
[59:38] with a headache and Brethren said why
[59:40] would he have to do that
[59:44] for you and I
[59:46] not for himself
[59:48] he did it for you and I think of the
[59:51] needs that he ministered to
[59:53] think of it the multitudes who were
[59:56] there
[59:57] that actually ate a miracle
[1:00:04] they ate it think of those when the
[1:00:06] baskets here as was coming around it
[1:00:08] goes from a little large lunch and we
[1:00:10] know it was spread out how far and you
[1:00:12] know how hard it is sometimes to see
[1:00:14] things in a distance but to think how
[1:00:16] they had to look at this and hear they
[1:00:19] know it's it just keeps on producing and
[1:00:21] let me just tell you something the last
[1:00:23] person didn't get a crumb each time this
[1:00:26] was done there was 12 baskets left over
[1:00:30] you know 12 years worship
[1:00:34] after what he has done it is a time of
[1:00:37] worship
[1:00:38] it's more than enough
[1:00:41] [Applause]
[1:00:43] he's more than enough when God does
[1:00:45] something it's more than enough it ain't
[1:00:47] just barely enough for the job God
[1:00:50] didn't sin barely enough in this hour
[1:00:52] East more than enough
[1:00:55] [Applause]
[1:00:57] many of them ate of those Miracles and
[1:01:01] walked away true they even followed a
[1:01:04] little bit they came around a little bit
[1:01:07] oh yeah they made a sacrifice to go to
[1:01:09] the other side of the sea for what
[1:01:11] purpose
[1:01:12] to eat Fish and Loaves
[1:01:14] what was that about them
[1:01:18] they weren't thinking about their soul
[1:01:19] that's what the son of man came to point
[1:01:21] them to is that to recognize there is a
[1:01:23] meat that you need to labor for and meat
[1:01:26] that will not perish but endureth
[1:01:30] but they went on about their lives
[1:01:32] but still
[1:01:34] it wouldn't have changed the course
[1:01:36] Jesus notice God already knew what
[1:01:39] choice they were going to make but he
[1:01:41] came to minister to their needs
[1:01:45] but there was a purpose and that purpose
[1:01:47] was greater than all the Miracles there
[1:01:50] were many miracles that were done the
[1:01:52] healing of the sick the death the blind
[1:01:55] all of that he was declaring God was
[1:01:58] declaring himself God was present in
[1:02:01] Christ
[1:02:02] [Applause]
[1:02:03] yeah are you hearing me he was declaring
[1:02:05] that that when itself was misunderstood
[1:02:10] he was called Beelzebub
[1:02:13] he was criticized he was ridiculed
[1:02:17] but what God was declaring that here God
[1:02:20] and man have been now reconciled God was
[1:02:23] declaring of what he was going to do
[1:02:27] when he would pour out of his own spirit
[1:02:31] it would be God living in the people
[1:02:33] once again
[1:02:36] to think about it he came for a purpose
[1:02:38] to pay a ransom for many
[1:02:42] is that what the scripture said give his
[1:02:43] life a ransom for many that means there
[1:02:46] were some being held
[1:02:48] and he came as the ransom
[1:02:51] glory be to God he didn't he didn't send
[1:02:53] a ransom he said I am the ransom
[1:02:56] I am your way out
[1:02:59] I am your Waymaker
[1:03:01] now getting along all the journey I want
[1:03:03] you to think of this now along the whole
[1:03:05] journey
[1:03:06] all the healing all the great Miracles
[1:03:09] all the deliverances that were done all
[1:03:12] the physical needs that were cared for
[1:03:15] yet the greatest
[1:03:17] of all
[1:03:19] was when the lamb
[1:03:22] surrendered his will
[1:03:24] to go to Calvary
[1:03:28] there have been many Hill many delivered
[1:03:30] but here at Calvary Satan's head would
[1:03:34] be bruised once and for all
[1:03:39] like Samson Samson he killed many
[1:03:42] Philistines but when he was there there
[1:03:45] in that Coliseum and he said lead me to
[1:03:49] what everything is resting upon
[1:03:51] supporting on
[1:03:53] and right there
[1:03:55] what the support of all of that was
[1:03:58] broken and more Philistines died
[1:04:02] in that moment
[1:04:04] when what Samson had surrendered all of
[1:04:07] his life
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:10] it's the same thing in our lives
[1:04:12] it's a full surrender that's the
[1:04:15] greatest thing that that head was ever
[1:04:16] done he surrendered nevertheless not my
[1:04:19] will thine will be done that here the
[1:04:22] lamb wouldn't mean come and move into
[1:04:25] that of the high priest of faithful and
[1:04:28] merciful one one that had walked down
[1:04:31] here one that had experienced Temptation
[1:04:33] one who knew what it felt like under the
[1:04:37] pressure of obedience one who could
[1:04:39] understand you and I one who then could
[1:04:42] be the right kind of a mediator inside
[1:04:45] of you and me
[1:04:46] one that when we talked to him it does
[1:04:49] that he's able to say I understand and
[1:04:51] I'm here to move on your behalf there is
[1:04:54] one you can talk to he understands what
[1:04:58] you're going through
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:02] I say that was the greatest
[1:05:05] of all moments a prayer was offered up
[1:05:08] it was a prayer to be useful
[1:05:12] nevertheless not my will
[1:05:15] thine will be done
[1:05:17] in Hebrews 5
[1:05:19] verse 7 who in the days of his flesh
[1:05:21] when he had offered a prayers and
[1:05:22] supplications with strong crying and
[1:05:24] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:05:26] from death and was hurt and that he
[1:05:28] feared though he were a son
[1:05:30] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:05:34] which he suffered
[1:05:38] don't get nervous
[1:05:40] he learned obedience you see obedience
[1:05:43] is is not something that is easy to the
[1:05:48] flesh
[1:05:50] but obedience itself to obey the word of
[1:05:54] God there's going to be pressures
[1:05:55] there's going to be suffering but
[1:05:57] obedience is greater than sacrifice
[1:06:01] [Applause]
[1:06:03] you can have all kinds of sacrifices but
[1:06:05] if there's not obedience obedience is
[1:06:09] the greatest thing
[1:06:12] you can do everything I'll do this I do
[1:06:15] this I do this I do this and it might be
[1:06:17] wonderful things that you could even do
[1:06:19] for the church I say thank God for that
[1:06:22] but remember God is not looking for that
[1:06:26] I believe in being helpful I believe in
[1:06:29] looking around here and saying what can
[1:06:30] I do what can I do for the church what
[1:06:33] can I do but to understand the greatest
[1:06:36] thing is obedience
[1:06:40] obedience is a cost it ain't cheap it
[1:06:44] costs something
[1:06:45] to obey the word of God it costs
[1:06:47] something what will it cost it'll cost
[1:06:49] my will
[1:06:52] it'll cost me
[1:06:54] but he learned obedience he he came to
[1:06:56] an understanding notice God who is the
[1:06:59] omniscient one the all-knowing God but
[1:07:01] he came down and he experienced what it
[1:07:05] is
[1:07:07] in humanity
[1:07:09] to obey
[1:07:12] he experienced that
[1:07:14] God so subjected himself to a place to
[1:07:18] experience
[1:07:20] obedience
[1:07:22] and this is where the scripture says
[1:07:24] being made perfect
[1:07:26] he became the author of Eternal
[1:07:27] salvation unto all them
[1:07:30] that obey him
[1:07:31] they say God grant us the grace that we
[1:07:33] can become more useful
[1:07:36] but the Brand's talking about in his own
[1:07:38] life
[1:07:39] the gift that's given to him
[1:07:41] preaching the gospel the Divine gift
[1:07:44] declaring how the desire is to use that
[1:07:47] just for God's glory
[1:07:50] and in the message faith in the Son of
[1:07:51] God he says it like this
[1:07:54] so each day
[1:07:56] I want to live
[1:07:58] not for myself
[1:08:01] if I live for myself
[1:08:03] I live a selfish life
[1:08:06] I want to live for others
[1:08:09] and give what strength I have
[1:08:11] not to myself
[1:08:13] and to my own pleasure
[1:08:15] but for the benefit of others that'll
[1:08:19] build
[1:08:20] the kingdom of God
[1:08:24] there's a lot there's a lot of density
[1:08:26] right here a lot to weigh with what's
[1:08:28] put on the scale
[1:08:30] what to benefit others what benefit to
[1:08:33] others
[1:08:35] well you know brother Samuel I want my
[1:08:37] boss to win the award this year I want
[1:08:39] him to win the award of the greatest
[1:08:41] slave driver
[1:08:42] so I I'm just signing up for I just
[1:08:45] sacrificed I sign up for all the
[1:08:46] overtime and this and that
[1:08:48] but listen to me now listen listen
[1:08:52] that might benefit your boss
[1:08:54] and it might benefit your pocket take
[1:08:57] some years off of your life
[1:08:59] but is it building the kingdom of God
[1:09:03] see everything that we look at there's
[1:09:05] got to be an evaluation I pray to God
[1:09:07] that there's sometimes that we start to
[1:09:09] look as we look at things and evaluate
[1:09:12] what's this going to do for the kingdom
[1:09:14] of God
[1:09:17] I mean this applies across our families
[1:09:19] it applies across children it applies
[1:09:22] across everything that we do what we're
[1:09:24] doing there should be an advanced
[1:09:26] vestment in our families in our homes
[1:09:29] but it should never be at the expense of
[1:09:32] the Gospel of Jesus Christ because God
[1:09:34] will not lead us
[1:09:36] that way
[1:09:39] that's why he said except the man is
[1:09:41] willing to forsake father and mother and
[1:09:43] all and follow me
[1:09:46] that doesn't mean that we leave our
[1:09:48] family hanging but it means that
[1:09:50] everything that we do it's prioritized
[1:09:53] in how does this benefit others and the
[1:09:57] kingdom of God looking at for your
[1:09:59] family how does this benefit your lives
[1:10:01] in the kingdom of God
[1:10:06] brother Samuel sometimes those can be
[1:10:07] some hard decisions somebody's got to be
[1:10:09] the adult in the room
[1:10:13] they preach
[1:10:15] I will
[1:10:17] for the benefit of the other nobody
[1:10:19] wants to be the adult in the room
[1:10:21] but the benefit of others think about it
[1:10:23] I'm not saying you but don't it's the
[1:10:25] benefit of others I don't want you to
[1:10:26] pound on me but for the benefit of
[1:10:28] others that you'll build the kingdom of
[1:10:30] God that's what we want to look at
[1:10:31] because notice what Paul said here I I
[1:10:34] love this I believe it's more than just
[1:10:36] words I believe this is a declaration
[1:10:38] from our life for the love of Christ
[1:10:40] constraineth us because we thus the
[1:10:42] judge that if one died for all then
[1:10:45] we're all dead and that he died for all
[1:10:47] that they which live should not live
[1:10:50] should not henceforth live unto
[1:10:52] themselves but unto him which died for
[1:10:55] them and rose again
[1:10:57] you just say it like this if we're going
[1:10:59] to sacrifice anything don't sacrifice
[1:11:02] the things of God and expect godliness
[1:11:05] [Applause]
[1:11:07] you can't can't cut Corners with God and
[1:11:10] then it turns down the road we know what
[1:11:12] happened with this I wonder what
[1:11:13] happened here wonder what happened you
[1:11:14] can't cut Corners why there's a pattern
[1:11:17] that God has given
[1:11:18] [Applause]
[1:11:21] Hallelujah
[1:11:23] God when God comes it's God vindicating
[1:11:26] his pattern true
[1:11:30] so what matters at the end of the day
[1:11:34] I know some of you you know at times I
[1:11:35] want you I want to make Clarity I
[1:11:37] thought I know sometimes we're living in
[1:11:38] a time where you know you're asked to do
[1:11:40] more where there's less
[1:11:42] I know many of you did I don't want that
[1:11:43] over timer I don't want this I don't
[1:11:45] want that I want you know you're looking
[1:11:46] at those things and you know you realize
[1:11:49] that within it sometimes those are
[1:11:50] things you have no control over
[1:11:52] you can pray about it we've got
[1:11:54] witnesses right through here but prayer
[1:11:55] has been offered up you know what
[1:11:56] there's things say Lord You're Still God
[1:11:59] to move on the schedule for this Lord
[1:12:01] You're Still God to open up and make a
[1:12:03] way
[1:12:04] Hallelujah I'm telling you I'm a witness
[1:12:06] of that
[1:12:08] there's Witnesses of this throughout
[1:12:10] this room we're not helpless I'm telling
[1:12:12] you when a heart is determined it says
[1:12:15] listen ain't let nothing stand in my way
[1:12:17] you look at what's standing there and
[1:12:19] say it's a lion vanity
[1:12:22] it's a lion vanity
[1:12:25] there's Witnesses throughout this room
[1:12:27] I'm a witness of that as well it's not a
[1:12:29] witness to condemn you but you ought to
[1:12:31] think of it as a witness to say that's a
[1:12:33] truth it might seem like a big obstacle
[1:12:35] but there's a great big God on my side
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:40] because all that matters at the end of
[1:12:42] the day is what we've done for the
[1:12:44] kingdom of God
[1:12:46] brother Branham when he's talking to Dr
[1:12:48] Sam Adair his friend there in
[1:12:49] Jeffersonville brother Batman they just
[1:12:51] come through an examination and brother
[1:12:53] Ram is making this statement in the
[1:12:55] Revelation series he said the greatest
[1:12:57] thrill I have is living for others
[1:13:01] and he said that's what life is this is
[1:13:04] what Dr Sam Adair said that's what makes
[1:13:06] life real is you know and what not what
[1:13:08] you can do or accomplish for yourself
[1:13:10] but what you can do for others that's
[1:13:13] kind of doctor I'd like to take care of
[1:13:14] me
[1:13:16] right I'm not the doctor it says you
[1:13:19] know what let me see here
[1:13:22] yeah I need a bigger yacht I'll tell you
[1:13:24] what you need this surgery
[1:13:25] I don't want that guy
[1:13:27] I don't want that guy
[1:13:29] I don't want him I just give me what I
[1:13:31] need
[1:13:32] come on we all know it no matter where
[1:13:34] you work at I don't care what profession
[1:13:36] and whatever more we all know people
[1:13:38] that are there for the wrong reason
[1:13:42] is that right and they're the ones that
[1:13:44] get the complaints on I don't want that
[1:13:46] one I don't want that one a nurse no
[1:13:48] give me the janitor I'll take the
[1:13:49] janitor take care of me
[1:13:52] you know it's the truth
[1:13:54] same way within teaching and whatever
[1:13:56] more
[1:13:57] right now in everything
[1:14:00] notice that's when you're really living
[1:14:02] if there happens to be someone Among Us
[1:14:04] who has never did that try to live for
[1:14:06] somebody else give that a try and just
[1:14:09] see how much more life holds for you
[1:14:11] when you will not live for what you can
[1:14:13] get yourself out of life but what you
[1:14:15] can give someone else in life now watch
[1:14:19] how Brother Band Breaks us down you'll
[1:14:21] find it's more blessed than riches or
[1:14:23] anything that can be thought of is what
[1:14:25] you can do for someone else to make
[1:14:27] life's burdens because life in itself is
[1:14:31] a burden can I get an amen on that one
[1:14:33] life in itself is a burden
[1:14:37] everybody's burdened and it will make a
[1:14:40] little lighter for someone else
[1:14:43] but you see listen think about this has
[1:14:46] always been but it's even more so in the
[1:14:49] day you and I are living in
[1:14:51] because the spiritual condition of this
[1:14:53] age says I'm rich and I don't have need
[1:14:56] of nothing it's all about I
[1:14:59] that's what this age it's an age of I
[1:15:02] it's an age of self-love it's an age of
[1:15:05] speak your truth it's an age of do you
[1:15:07] it's an age that's all about self
[1:15:10] glorification of self
[1:15:13] that ain't Godly
[1:15:16] there's only one truth that we're to
[1:15:18] speak and that is the truth of God's
[1:15:21] holy word
[1:15:24] everything else is alive
[1:15:28] it will make it a little lighter for
[1:15:31] someone else
[1:15:32] and sometimes we have to understand it's
[1:15:34] true even the busyness of Life can try
[1:15:36] to work and try to get to us and we just
[1:15:38] get caught like spinning around
[1:15:44] you just know the joy unless you've
[1:15:46] tried it wants to do something for
[1:15:47] someone else
[1:15:50] but that brings me to thinking of 31
[1:15:52] years
[1:15:54] see these are certain things I'm just
[1:15:56] going to drift on this a little bit as
[1:15:57] it comes to me these are certain things
[1:15:59] right here of certain sacrifices that
[1:16:02] are made even when it comes to
[1:16:03] fellowshipping with one another
[1:16:07] and I've said this before and I
[1:16:09] I believe it it's all the way through
[1:16:10] the scripture it's through the message
[1:16:13] I believe that I don't understand why we
[1:16:16] wouldn't want to fellowship with our
[1:16:17] brothers and sisters
[1:16:21] come on now
[1:16:23] I appreciate the sacrifices that are
[1:16:25] made to have whether it's breakfast or
[1:16:27] whatever those things to be able to get
[1:16:29] together and do all this well brother
[1:16:31] Sammy is sometimes that's not always
[1:16:32] convenient for me I know been there
[1:16:35] well I'm gonna preach I'll come down
[1:16:36] there if I've got to
[1:16:38] but see what it is it's not about doing
[1:16:42] something that's convenient for you
[1:16:44] or that fits you
[1:16:47] it's doing something for others because
[1:16:49] if it just happens to work with you or
[1:16:52] work with me it don't fit
[1:16:56] come on Friends there's a lot more than
[1:16:58] preaching the gospel or witnessing to
[1:17:00] somebody saying there's a lot more that
[1:17:03] goes to living for others than that
[1:17:05] because a lot of times for you can never
[1:17:07] get that you've got to get favor and
[1:17:09] show somebody you care about them
[1:17:11] [Applause]
[1:17:13] and that takes a little bit of prep time
[1:17:17] sacrifice
[1:17:23] that brings me to thinking of 31 years
[1:17:26] will be soon of the ministry for the
[1:17:27] Lord and I guess every man thinks of
[1:17:30] sometime when he has to come to his last
[1:17:31] service and come to his last hour and
[1:17:33] look back down the path and see what has
[1:17:35] been accomplished and see what's on
[1:17:37] have you did anything
[1:17:39] and I've said it's what you do for
[1:17:41] others
[1:17:42] that counts
[1:17:44] Now watch how brother Brown words this
[1:17:46] same quote he says I wonder what would
[1:17:48] be when I got to the end of my road
[1:17:51] which we don't know what time that's
[1:17:52] going to be none of us do and I was
[1:17:54] thinking about looking back down along
[1:17:56] the trail
[1:17:57] where I've come through life and seen
[1:18:00] the different Hills and Briar patches
[1:18:02] and rocks and hard places and smooth
[1:18:04] Runnings
[1:18:06] all them smooth Runnings are nice
[1:18:09] but I see a lot of hills
[1:18:11] Briar patches rocks hard places there's
[1:18:15] a lot more hard than there is smooth
[1:18:18] right when you just you look back across
[1:18:20] down lights pathway
[1:18:25] I did this is important what I did in
[1:18:29] those kind of times
[1:18:33] when I will look back down through there
[1:18:35] what did I do in the Rocky times in the
[1:18:38] Briar Patch times
[1:18:40] did I just uh
[1:18:42] I just you know my flesh might say I
[1:18:46] can't take another I can't but what did
[1:18:48] I do in the midst of that time
[1:18:51] see that's a question each one of us
[1:18:53] have to answer
[1:18:54] because everybody has their Briar
[1:18:56] patches we got to go through Briar
[1:18:58] patches aren't fun to go through it's
[1:19:00] there I don't care what you have on it's
[1:19:02] hard to walk through them you can almost
[1:19:03] trip
[1:19:05] I've been through them and hunting you
[1:19:07] can almost trip fall on your face you're
[1:19:09] getting scratched you're trying to move
[1:19:10] things away what about the rocky places
[1:19:12] where things that doesn't seem to be
[1:19:14] real on our footing and what about the
[1:19:16] hills where we're going up
[1:19:18] coming down
[1:19:21] smooth places are nice but you also got
[1:19:24] to be worried weary of smooth places
[1:19:26] because they can be slippery
[1:19:31] but what did I do in those kind of times
[1:19:33] it'll show up one of these days at the
[1:19:35] hour of my going away as it'll do for
[1:19:37] each of us
[1:19:38] notice in second Timothy 2 8 let me just
[1:19:41] read a few scriptures here watch out
[1:19:44] Paul and we're dealing with this of a
[1:19:45] useful life
[1:19:47] and I want you just to think of it in
[1:19:48] this way
[1:19:50] how a useful life itself
[1:19:53] as we're looking at Job Trials come
[1:19:56] because of a useful life
[1:20:01] why that we might be more useful
[1:20:05] I'm talking to the believer now
[1:20:07] okay I'm talking to the believer
[1:20:09] remember that Jesus Christ of the seed
[1:20:11] of David was raised from the dead
[1:20:13] according to my gospel wherein I suffer
[1:20:16] trouble as an evil Doer
[1:20:21] was Paul an evil doer no
[1:20:24] but that's how he was looked at
[1:20:27] he was regarded as one as a matter of
[1:20:29] fact they called him out there in the
[1:20:31] temple about the seventh day hey the
[1:20:34] Jews from Asia this is the guy that's
[1:20:36] teaching against the law of Moses
[1:20:41] misunderstood
[1:20:43] the Jews threw out
[1:20:45] misunderstood not all of them because
[1:20:47] there were many who believed
[1:20:50] but I suffer why are you suffering
[1:20:52] trouble because of what I'm standing for
[1:20:54] and what I'm ministering
[1:20:57] as an evil doer even unto bonds but the
[1:20:59] word of God is not bound
[1:21:02] therefore
[1:21:03] I Endure all things
[1:21:06] for
[1:21:08] the elect's sake
[1:21:11] so Paul recognizes the trials what I'm
[1:21:14] dealing with I wouldn't even have to
[1:21:16] deal with this
[1:21:19] I wouldn't even have to have this
[1:21:21] trouble that I'm going through but the
[1:21:23] reason that this trouble has come is
[1:21:26] because of the Gospel which I didn't
[1:21:28] even sign up to preach but he has called
[1:21:32] me as a prisoner and I for what he has
[1:21:35] done for me and made known to me against
[1:21:38] my own will a dispensation of the Gospel
[1:21:42] is committed unto me
[1:21:44] so he's endured it
[1:21:47] for the elect's sake
[1:21:50] you know I got to thinking of that as I
[1:21:52] would just meditate and even on some of
[1:21:53] these things today and you get to
[1:21:55] looking at suffering when the Bible says
[1:21:57] love suffereth long enduring and
[1:21:59] suffering that does not mean that we are
[1:22:01] building up steam like a pressure cooker
[1:22:04] well I'm suffering
[1:22:05] bless God they keep rubbing that ain't
[1:22:08] suffering
[1:22:10] that's called you're about ready to blow
[1:22:12] a gasket
[1:22:13] that's not enduring because oh Lord
[1:22:17] don't let somebody touch you at the
[1:22:18] wrong moment you explode all over them
[1:22:21] well I've been suffering for so long
[1:22:24] no you haven't been suffering you
[1:22:27] haven't been enduring
[1:22:28] you've been getting bitter
[1:22:30] and bitter
[1:22:32] and bitter instead of taking what come
[1:22:34] your way and really placing It Before
[1:22:37] the Throne of God and say Lord clean it
[1:22:39] out of me cleansing them don't let
[1:22:41] nothing get stuck Lord in my life
[1:22:44] because remember our suffering even what
[1:22:47] comes our way think of it Friends The
[1:22:49] Suffering that comes our way you and I
[1:22:52] have a choice you and I have both we
[1:22:54] have all met people that you can get
[1:22:56] around and you're like oh my Lord it is
[1:22:58] so bitter because bitter is just
[1:23:00] exasperating it just it's everything all
[1:23:03] around everything it's so negative and
[1:23:05] you're like oh Lord have mercy it's just
[1:23:07] like that juice that gastric digestive
[1:23:10] stuff that comes up in your throat and
[1:23:12] you know you can't hardly get the taste
[1:23:13] out of it once it comes up you're like
[1:23:15] Lord have mercy I don't want to be
[1:23:17] around that stuff what is it it's not
[1:23:19] the trial that's done bad it's the lack
[1:23:22] of going to the source of our strength
[1:23:25] in the midst of the trial oh brother
[1:23:27] Samuel so and so said this so and so did
[1:23:30] me wrong I think this or I think that
[1:23:32] but you've got a source that you can go
[1:23:35] to so that you don't become bitter
[1:23:39] are you hearing me friends
[1:23:41] you can never help anybody if you become
[1:23:44] bitter
[1:23:45] as a matter of fact you affect everybody
[1:23:47] else around you
[1:23:50] and if you become bitter you become
[1:23:52] discouraged you need to ask the heavenly
[1:23:54] father Lord cleanse me and get me get my
[1:23:58] eyes off myself because I'm too selfish
[1:24:01] it's all about what's going right here
[1:24:03] what's going right now is this going
[1:24:05] good is this going good is this coming
[1:24:06] that's still about us
[1:24:12] Paul said we've been made a spectacle I
[1:24:15] just have to move on here he talked
[1:24:17] about being a fool for Christ's sake
[1:24:21] he spoke of hound that he had identified
[1:24:23] with Christ notice in Hebrews 10 32
[1:24:26] caller remembered speaking to us as
[1:24:28] Believers the former days in which after
[1:24:30] ye were illuminated you endured a great
[1:24:33] fight of afflictions
[1:24:35] so the enemy's after you
[1:24:37] after you're illuminated
[1:24:39] you watch even after a service watch
[1:24:41] after a good time a good week maybe a
[1:24:44] good few days of mine it just feels like
[1:24:46] man you've just been having donuts with
[1:24:48] the angels hell the time my the
[1:24:50] visitation and then you watch just right
[1:24:53] after that how it will be tested
[1:24:56] we will be tested
[1:24:58] right that's the thing we will be tested
[1:25:01] but remember it's not to look around and
[1:25:03] say oh my Lord where's this test coming
[1:25:05] from no receive the strength that God is
[1:25:08] ministering to us at that moment
[1:25:10] afflictions will come but they will only
[1:25:13] bring to manifestation what God is
[1:25:17] already done and is doing in our life
[1:25:22] don't run from them just give yourself
[1:25:24] to God
[1:25:26] partly notice you endured a great flight
[1:25:28] of Affliction partly while you were made
[1:25:30] gazing stock both by reproaches and
[1:25:32] afflictions and partly while you became
[1:25:34] Companions of them that were so used
[1:25:37] my mama
[1:25:40] second Timothy 3 12 and Yea all that
[1:25:43] live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:25:47] persecution
[1:25:49] the closer you get to God
[1:25:52] the more trials will come
[1:26:00] I know that's not like very flattering
[1:26:01] or very like
[1:26:04] oh that's that's not even something
[1:26:05] we're willing to raise our hand for
[1:26:06] we're just saying yep I agree with that
[1:26:08] amen amen
[1:26:10] because our flesh doesn't want trials
[1:26:13] I don't care who you are your flesh
[1:26:15] doesn't want trials we don't like them
[1:26:16] right the flesh is weak
[1:26:19] we do not like that but notice all that
[1:26:21] live Godly in Christ Jesus giving
[1:26:23] ourselves to God as God is moving God is
[1:26:26] speaking and moving in our life listen
[1:26:28] sometimes you can't even see the ways
[1:26:31] that God is dealing with in people's
[1:26:32] lives and I'll just say for the whole
[1:26:34] congregation because you know what
[1:26:35] there's a lot of times that even as a
[1:26:37] pastor I don't know until there's
[1:26:39] certain things that gets spoke to me
[1:26:41] mentioned to me and you begin to see
[1:26:43] what you cannot see may be out here how
[1:26:45] God is dealing within people's lives and
[1:26:47] hearts and you say oh Lord God just keep
[1:26:50] moving in a certain way but you also
[1:26:52] realize every time that God deals with
[1:26:55] the life and the life will give
[1:26:56] themselves to God you'll always be
[1:26:59] tested on the grounds that God has given
[1:27:01] you what do I do at that time don't turn
[1:27:03] and run that's the time to stand and
[1:27:06] face the devil down and say God has
[1:27:09] given this to me God has placed me here
[1:27:12] and I ain't going back from it
[1:27:15] [Applause]
[1:27:17] oh my let me just try to move it down
[1:27:20] into this here first Corinthians 9 19.
[1:27:22] watch out Paul speaking of being a
[1:27:25] servant
[1:27:26] notice how in words this year for though
[1:27:28] I be free from all men
[1:27:31] yet have I made myself servant unto all
[1:27:35] that I might gain the more now notice
[1:27:37] I'm free from all men in other words I
[1:27:38] have no obligation at one time Paul was
[1:27:41] obligated to you know that of of those
[1:27:43] carrying out things you know against the
[1:27:45] Christians he had obligations to other
[1:27:47] men but now Paul could say I'm free from
[1:27:50] all men not only do I not work for
[1:27:52] anybody or under that obligation but I
[1:27:54] am free I am God's free man but through
[1:27:58] this freedom and this Liberty that had
[1:28:00] come to Paul Paul realizes the purpose
[1:28:03] upon his life that through this Freedom
[1:28:06] it has gifted Paul with the ability and
[1:28:09] the grace to make himself a servant unto
[1:28:13] all people God didn't make him a servant
[1:28:15] he made himself a servant to all people
[1:28:18] he was God's serving him that he was an
[1:28:20] apostle he was a prophet is that right
[1:28:22] God made him that Paul didn't make
[1:28:24] himself that nor any other man but when
[1:28:27] it came to working among the peoples
[1:28:29] that he would be sent to God entrusted
[1:28:32] Paul with that part to make himself a
[1:28:36] servant in other words God said I have
[1:28:38] condescended and I have ascended back up
[1:28:41] I have sent the Holy Spirit down into
[1:28:43] your life I have descended down into
[1:28:46] your life that you might also condescend
[1:28:50] as well
[1:28:53] Oh Glory now Paul didn't become a
[1:28:56] compromiser
[1:28:59] he didn't become a compromiser
[1:29:01] he walked right among them but Paul was
[1:29:04] not a partaker of their unbelief
[1:29:07] right he didn't make himself odd he
[1:29:09] didn't go and spray you know off all
[1:29:11] over him
[1:29:14] he didn't make himself odd Paul had
[1:29:15] confidence in the Liberty he had in his
[1:29:17] life he had confidence in that
[1:29:20] are you with me
[1:29:22] notice First Corinthians 9 20 and unto
[1:29:25] the Jews I became as a Jew
[1:29:29] now wasn't he already a Jew
[1:29:31] sure
[1:29:33] he was but why did you become as a Jew
[1:29:37] that I might gain the Jews to them that
[1:29:41] are under the law as under the law that
[1:29:44] I might gain them that are under the law
[1:29:46] they kept Paul when he went even when he
[1:29:49] went outside of Jerusalem he gathered
[1:29:51] with them on what they called the
[1:29:54] Sabbath day
[1:29:56] Paul didn't say huh buddy we're going
[1:29:58] we're gathering on Sunday if you want to
[1:30:00] hear me you wait tomorrow
[1:30:02] Paul knew this is when they're gathering
[1:30:04] on what they has been given to them as
[1:30:07] the Sabbath day Saturday so they're in
[1:30:09] the synagogue I'm going to go and gather
[1:30:10] with them what was it making himself a
[1:30:14] servant
[1:30:15] when he came into Jerusalem remember
[1:30:18] when he was there and how that when they
[1:30:21] came around there in that moment
[1:30:22] remember how Paul even himself would
[1:30:25] enter into purification at the
[1:30:27] discretion of James and the rest of them
[1:30:29] and said Hey listen there's a lot of
[1:30:31] believing Jews right here in Jerusalem
[1:30:33] there's a lot of believing Jews and in
[1:30:35] order for you to have because they've
[1:30:37] heard a lot of things they've heard that
[1:30:38] man just There's No Holds Barred out
[1:30:40] there among the Gentiles but and there's
[1:30:42] a lot of things but in order for them to
[1:30:44] hear you why don't you go with these
[1:30:47] four men that have vowed themselves with
[1:30:48] the vow and Paul went with them he
[1:30:50] shaved his head and Paul would go into
[1:30:52] that time of purification you realize
[1:30:55] Paul was stood other things coming into
[1:30:57] the church but at that moment the wisdom
[1:31:00] of God he realized in order to reach
[1:31:03] these Jews it might require me shaving
[1:31:06] my head entering back into purification
[1:31:08] according to under the law that Paul
[1:31:11] knew he was God's free man what was it
[1:31:14] he made himself a servant to all
[1:31:18] I think of how Paul when he stood there
[1:31:20] I mean think of how it must have been
[1:31:22] when Paul stood there that day that here
[1:31:24] when Paul was brought before the
[1:31:25] audience of Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:31:27] remember that Paul surveying the
[1:31:29] audience he said oh Lord I got Baptists
[1:31:31] here got Pentecostals here I got let me
[1:31:33] see oh I got more Pentecostals glory to
[1:31:35] God I believe speaking in tongues
[1:31:37] what was it he'd have one side on his
[1:31:40] part
[1:31:41] right what did he say at that time I
[1:31:43] believe in the resurrection from the
[1:31:44] dead Sadducees didn't believe that but
[1:31:46] he had the Pharisees on his side
[1:31:48] is that right what was it listen you see
[1:31:50] the wisdom of God if you listen to the
[1:31:52] message very carefully you can tell the
[1:31:55] congregation the prophet is preaching to
[1:31:57] you can tell if he's preaching to them
[1:32:00] who lean in a calvinistic slant or those
[1:32:02] who lean in Armenian slant he what will
[1:32:05] he do he's not going to try to upset him
[1:32:07] he's going to minister the word that'll
[1:32:10] reach their lives
[1:32:12] if you listen carefully to it he deals
[1:32:15] with it in the Hebrew series he deals
[1:32:17] with those things it is not just random
[1:32:19] things being done it is the wisdom of
[1:32:21] God what not to stop the people up but
[1:32:24] as a servant have a prophet in this age
[1:32:27] made himself a servant in order to win
[1:32:31] lives to the Lord
[1:32:35] foreign
[1:32:36] I'll tell you that in itself is not skim
[1:32:38] milk
[1:32:39] and I'm not saying because I'm preaching
[1:32:41] I'm saying because it's the word of God
[1:32:42] it ain't skim milk it really requires
[1:32:44] the wisdom of God it requires prayer it
[1:32:46] requires getting before God because you
[1:32:48] know what as a Believer we're not
[1:32:50] walking into situations guns blazing I
[1:32:53] dare it I'm going to pull out the six
[1:32:54] shooters and I'm going to shoot them
[1:32:55] down that is not the spirit of Christ
[1:32:58] because the spirit of Christ is a spirit
[1:33:00] that is of life
[1:33:03] are you hearing me amen that's even when
[1:33:06] it comes to witnessing so notice how
[1:33:08] Paul he would do this in order to gain
[1:33:10] them I think of Timothy you know
[1:33:12] probably Timothy thought after a while
[1:33:13] like man you know Paul you know how
[1:33:15] equal-minded and how but oh how Paul you
[1:33:18] know he he really loved Timothy but then
[1:33:20] how Paul had to call Timothy aside one
[1:33:22] day and say Timothy look we've got to go
[1:33:24] among some in some synagogues and
[1:33:26] there's Jews here you're a Greek and
[1:33:28] they know your daddy's a Greek so I need
[1:33:30] you to be circumcised
[1:33:32] now I wonder if Timothy would have stood
[1:33:34] there and said Paul but remember when
[1:33:36] those false Brethren came to galatia and
[1:33:39] they were trying to tell everybody
[1:33:40] you've got to be circumcised or God
[1:33:43] won't have nothing to do with you but
[1:33:45] you see Timothy was yielded to God and
[1:33:48] he realized what this was all about it
[1:33:51] was not about that that sign in his
[1:33:53] flesh through a circumcision In the
[1:33:55] Flesh that somehow that was going to
[1:33:56] make him acceptable to God Timothy
[1:33:59] realize I'm going to get the hindrances
[1:34:01] out of the way so the gospel can have
[1:34:04] free course
[1:34:05] [Applause]
[1:34:08] because you see what Paul was saying
[1:34:10] Paul said if anybody's going to be
[1:34:11] offended there's one thing that can be
[1:34:13] offended him that's the gospel but it
[1:34:15] ain't going to be me
[1:34:20] Lord let that sing to the fifth real
[1:34:24] glory be to God to them that are without
[1:34:27] the law as without law being not without
[1:34:31] law to God but under the law to Christ
[1:34:34] that I might gain them that are without
[1:34:36] the law
[1:34:37] so when Paul went among the Gentiles you
[1:34:40] you know this you understand it you've
[1:34:41] read it in the scriptures when Paul went
[1:34:43] among them Paul had an understanding in
[1:34:45] his life Christ is the Fulfillment of
[1:34:47] the law Paul never became sinful Paul
[1:34:50] did not practice and those in the things
[1:34:52] that would be sinful but notice Paul was
[1:34:55] there and my he was enjoying you know
[1:34:57] BLT a bacon sandwich and you know he
[1:34:59] enjoyed you know some spare ribs and he
[1:35:01] was enjoying all these things and Peter
[1:35:03] got to look and say Lord have mercy
[1:35:05] these ribs are good man and these things
[1:35:08] are good but then Brethren came down
[1:35:10] from Jerusalem and Peter said oh Lord I
[1:35:13] got to get this bacon grease off of me I
[1:35:15] need the Listerine to cover the rib
[1:35:17] breath on my mouth what was it Peter was
[1:35:19] shaken but you see God had ordained
[1:35:22] Peter to be a minister to the
[1:35:25] circumcision
[1:35:27] is that right now remember Paul was
[1:35:30] stood him on that say look you got a
[1:35:31] double standard here right but Paul when
[1:35:34] he came among that Paul had that Liberty
[1:35:36] God had ordained him for that he never
[1:35:39] became sinful but he was able to make
[1:35:42] himself a servant to move among the
[1:35:45] people of God now to look at this to the
[1:35:47] week verse 22 to the weak became I
[1:35:51] as weak
[1:35:52] that I might gain the weak
[1:35:55] what does Paul mean by weak
[1:35:57] remember Paul took chapters on it
[1:35:59] through all the other letters there were
[1:36:02] some who didn't believe in eating this
[1:36:04] quarter meat or this coming out of here
[1:36:06] or some certain Liberties and Paul said
[1:36:08] to those that are weak hey I became weak
[1:36:12] not putting my Liberties before them but
[1:36:14] neither of my Liberties being taken away
[1:36:16] but to the leap I became as weak did he
[1:36:18] have to do that no did God tell Paul I
[1:36:22] want you to become weak Paul wants you
[1:36:23] to become as a Jew Paul I want you to be
[1:36:26] as without the law God never told him
[1:36:28] that
[1:36:29] but the spirit of Christ within him
[1:36:32] let him
[1:36:33] to subject himself
[1:36:35] in order to win some
[1:36:39] I want you to think of this here in this
[1:36:42] manner let me finish this I made all
[1:36:44] things to all men that I might by all
[1:36:46] means save
[1:36:49] some
[1:36:51] and this I do for the gospel sake that I
[1:36:53] might be partaker thereof
[1:36:55] with you
[1:36:58] can I read these next few places to you
[1:37:01] in the message a new ministry
[1:37:04] brother Branham was speaking of how
[1:37:07] in his life the greatest privilege that
[1:37:09] he's had
[1:37:10] this was to serve the Lord
[1:37:14] and he speaks of Brianna if you just go
[1:37:16] to that third quote under my new
[1:37:17] ministry
[1:37:19] and he's talking about I just I was born
[1:37:21] for this purpose to serve the Lord I
[1:37:22] just want to serve him that's my heart's
[1:37:24] desire and what I ask of you would be a
[1:37:26] prayer for me before you lay down
[1:37:27] tonight that God would keep me humble in
[1:37:30] my heart
[1:37:31] and would help me and bless me so that I
[1:37:33] could be a blessing to you people I
[1:37:35] found that's the greatest blessing in
[1:37:37] life is giving something out not
[1:37:40] receiving in but giving out what you do
[1:37:44] for others is what means so much
[1:37:49] let me just try to
[1:37:50] drop it down here on this and to end it
[1:37:52] you see with what we've read
[1:37:55] the life of the Lord Jesus even in
[1:37:58] Paul's life
[1:38:00] one thing you can always you can always
[1:38:02] count on
[1:38:04] when being used of the Lord
[1:38:06] is you're going to be misunderstood
[1:38:10] you'll be misunderstood
[1:38:12] gonna be criticized
[1:38:14] those are two things that come
[1:38:16] Paul was misunderstood brother Bram
[1:38:18] tells us Jesus was the most
[1:38:20] misunderstood person there ever lived
[1:38:23] his disciples they even looked at him oh
[1:38:25] now now we know who's speaking
[1:38:29] every Spirit-filled believer
[1:38:30] misunderstood
[1:38:33] because it's it's for the mind to
[1:38:35] comprehend why decisions are being made
[1:38:39] as they are because it doesn't make
[1:38:41] sense to the carnal mind
[1:38:45] it doesn't make sense to the carnal mind
[1:38:47] to turn down a job or something that oh
[1:38:51] my you can make this and this and this
[1:38:53] and yet you look at and say but if I do
[1:38:55] this and this and this
[1:38:57] I'll be out of church
[1:39:00] I won't be able not just coming to
[1:39:02] church I won't even be able for God to
[1:39:04] use me to minister to anybody else in
[1:39:06] the body
[1:39:09] how many all tied up
[1:39:13] and to the carnal mind
[1:39:15] that doesn't make sense
[1:39:18] but to the spiritual mind
[1:39:20] that's led by the spirit of God and you
[1:39:22] can apply this across the board
[1:39:24] it comes down to say wait a minute
[1:39:26] this is the decision according to the
[1:39:28] word of God
[1:39:30] and you'll be misunderstood sometimes
[1:39:31] you're misunderstood by family
[1:39:36] job was being misunderstood right now
[1:39:39] misunderstanding is a hard thing
[1:39:43] because job because even with Paul all
[1:39:45] of this was taking place Paul was
[1:39:47] misunderstood he wasn't an evil Doer
[1:39:49] Jesus was misunderstood you come to
[1:39:52] destroy the law he said no I come to
[1:39:55] fulfill it
[1:39:57] Paul even said it said he even said it
[1:40:00] straight he had come that the law itself
[1:40:02] the Holy Spirit has come that it might
[1:40:04] be established in the heart of the
[1:40:05] people
[1:40:06] but it's misunderstood
[1:40:08] now let me just say this to you
[1:40:11] because we all have been there maybe
[1:40:12] here tonight maybe you'll come to it
[1:40:15] but I want you to just to think of this
[1:40:17] for a moment
[1:40:19] even as the son of man came to be
[1:40:21] ministered or not minister to
[1:40:24] to minister and to think of it in this
[1:40:26] way
[1:40:29] when we are misunderstood
[1:40:31] when we are criticized
[1:40:34] how do we look
[1:40:35] at the source from where the
[1:40:37] misunderstanding and criticism is coming
[1:40:39] from
[1:40:40] because it can be dead wrong
[1:40:43] how do we look at it
[1:40:45] do we look at it of
[1:40:47] oh I'm righteous
[1:40:49] I'm righteous
[1:40:51] oh this is all this they're so
[1:40:53] misunderstanding they're so they're so
[1:40:56] critical they're so and listen we live
[1:40:58] in an age it's
[1:41:00] perpetrated with criticism
[1:41:05] I mean it's you know that but it's
[1:41:07] always been
[1:41:09] they criticized the Lord Jesus even as
[1:41:11] he hung on the cross
[1:41:14] said come down
[1:41:15] come down if you be the son of God
[1:41:19] he indeed is the righteous one but
[1:41:21] notice what he said father
[1:41:24] forgive him
[1:41:25] because they don't know what they're
[1:41:28] doing
[1:41:31] he said brother Sammy what what should
[1:41:32] we do don't try to fight the
[1:41:34] misunderstanding don't try to fight the
[1:41:36] criticism
[1:41:38] the way to approach that is is realize
[1:41:40] God permits that in order for us to be
[1:41:43] more of a useful tool
[1:41:46] what are we going to do with it because
[1:41:48] it's that's a part of the flesh these
[1:41:49] are I'm speaking of Battlegrounds right
[1:41:52] here tonight
[1:41:53] I'm talking about Battlegrounds that
[1:41:56] come in our lives into our lives
[1:41:59] and you could we could spend our time
[1:42:01] fighting against misunderstanding and I
[1:42:03] was misunderstood let me just tell you
[1:42:04] something when brother Brown spoke and
[1:42:07] remember
[1:42:08] uh in in works as Faith Express remember
[1:42:10] that lady that came in that dream and
[1:42:13] she told Brother Branham in that dream
[1:42:15] she said here are these people Behind
[1:42:17] These Bars and you just you hear all
[1:42:19] these things that they're saying
[1:42:21] and she said brother Branham these
[1:42:23] people have misunderstood you
[1:42:27] what was the bars
[1:42:28] misunderstandings
[1:42:32] and brother Brahm said he looked inside
[1:42:33] those bars and he saw flickers of light
[1:42:38] and he said and realize at that moment
[1:42:40] he says he walked up he looked at those
[1:42:42] bars he said I couldn't break him with
[1:42:43] my arms
[1:42:45] I couldn't do that I didn't have the
[1:42:47] strength to do it
[1:42:48] something rolls up in him at that moment
[1:42:51] I said brother Brown you must you must
[1:42:54] and he rose up and he said in the name
[1:42:57] of Jesus Christ
[1:42:58] House of Hell give way
[1:43:03] do you realize Satan's in the business
[1:43:05] of creating misunderstandings
[1:43:10] are you hearing me he's in the business
[1:43:11] of doing that
[1:43:13] but don't look at the source of the
[1:43:15] misunderstanding as far as the vessel
[1:43:18] here's here's what you look at is Lord
[1:43:20] temper me
[1:43:22] temper me because the Lord Jesus the
[1:43:26] greatest event of all time was when he
[1:43:28] went to Calvary and he offered up his
[1:43:31] will
[1:43:34] I want you to think as we're closing
[1:43:35] here I know I'm over time here
[1:43:39] I remember how many remember in the
[1:43:41] message images of Christ where brother
[1:43:43] Brown says
[1:43:44] while the Tabernacles having a Revival
[1:43:47] I want a Revival
[1:43:49] he said I walk I walk I try to walk
[1:43:52] after God he said but I want to be
[1:43:54] closer to him
[1:43:56] I want a closer walk with him
[1:43:58] he said while they're having Revival I
[1:44:00] want one in my own life I want to revive
[1:44:03] it and this is what brother Branham as
[1:44:05] he as he goes into this he says you know
[1:44:08] it's going to take I want to be more
[1:44:09] like him and it's going to take the Holy
[1:44:11] Ghost to do that
[1:44:13] and as he he goes on and he makes this
[1:44:15] statement he says it's going to take
[1:44:17] it's not going to take seminaries it's
[1:44:18] not going to take a crucifix it's not
[1:44:20] going to take all these things it's
[1:44:21] going to take more of the Holy Ghost and
[1:44:22] he says it like this I'm interested in
[1:44:25] one thing and that's more of the Holy
[1:44:27] Spirit to take over William Branham
[1:44:31] now listen to this statement I'm not
[1:44:33] interested in joining a greater Church
[1:44:34] than what I belong to I belong to the
[1:44:37] real Church of the Living God the
[1:44:38] firstborn I was born into it so brother
[1:44:41] Ram realizes in order in order for him
[1:44:43] the Holy Spirit take over more of me I
[1:44:45] don't need to go and run and looks at
[1:44:46] what it is I need more of me taking over
[1:44:50] because it isn't the building that I'm a
[1:44:51] part of I'm already in if I've been born
[1:44:54] again of the spirit of God I'm in the
[1:44:55] Church of the firstborn
[1:44:57] right that's the greatest Church there
[1:44:59] is I belong to the real Church of the
[1:45:02] Living God the firstborn I was born into
[1:45:03] it I want more of the holy ghost in my
[1:45:07] life to reflect Christ who I love how
[1:45:10] many say Amen to that
[1:45:12] now watch what he says here I'm closing
[1:45:14] I
[1:45:16] or level
[1:45:17] I have to come on to to get it
[1:45:20] I don't care if I have to go here or
[1:45:22] there or be called fanatic Hollow roller
[1:45:26] whatever it might be
[1:45:29] I want more of his life to be reflected
[1:45:32] I'm interested in the plane I have to
[1:45:34] come in I'm interested in the Holy Ghost
[1:45:36] why so I can be more of a servant
[1:45:40] like he was
[1:45:42] he was the Lord's servant he never come
[1:45:45] to be served or to minister to he never
[1:45:47] come for him to be ministered to but to
[1:45:49] minister he took the place of a sermon
[1:45:52] and that so struck me there weeks ago
[1:45:56] I'm not interested in a plane because
[1:45:57] many times we were praying we pray Lord
[1:46:00] I want more and we should I want more of
[1:46:02] him
[1:46:03] but to realize some sometimes the way
[1:46:06] for more of him to come into our life is
[1:46:10] going to require
[1:46:12] maybe we're going to be called Holy
[1:46:13] Roller we're going to be called fanatic
[1:46:17] we're going to be certain things that
[1:46:18] will be said and it's going to see
[1:46:20] how do our feathers react in that time
[1:46:25] why do we respond
[1:46:28] but you see this is something Lord I
[1:46:30] want more of you but in order for him to
[1:46:33] be more more of him it's got to be less
[1:46:35] of us
[1:46:38] sometimes these are the things that we
[1:46:41] certainly don't sign up for but remember
[1:46:44] misunderstanding
[1:46:45] and criticism
[1:46:47] it comes
[1:46:49] if it isn't it comes and it will come
[1:46:53] but remember it's all to temper us
[1:46:56] because when you're being used of God
[1:46:59] you're going to be misunderstood
[1:47:03] right
[1:47:04] why are you making that decision why are
[1:47:07] you waiting this long why are you going
[1:47:09] to be misunderstood
[1:47:12] all down Through the Ages
[1:47:14] listen even among us but this is where
[1:47:16] we have to say Lord in the midst of that
[1:47:18] time
[1:47:19] help me to die to my will
[1:47:21] help me to die to myself
[1:47:24] help me to die to where all because it's
[1:47:26] a natural pool within us to defend
[1:47:28] ourselves there's a natural pool to lay
[1:47:30] everything out it's a natural it's
[1:47:32] natural part but oh I don't want to live
[1:47:34] by the natural
[1:47:35] I want to live by this Supernatural
[1:47:38] I want more of God in my life I want
[1:47:40] more of him and God knows what's needed
[1:47:44] for you and me to become more useful
[1:47:47] but Shane we never would choose that we
[1:47:49] would say to be called names Lord I'm
[1:47:51] praying for more of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:47:53] not and Lord says
[1:47:55] but this is what needs to be done
[1:47:58] because there's Avenues and channels
[1:48:01] that need to be opened up
[1:48:03] I say God help me
[1:48:05] how many say Lord help me
[1:48:07] Lord give me that Grace that I need Lord
[1:48:10] amen amen let's pray tonight
[1:48:14] Heavenly Father
[1:48:18] Lord thank you for the Simplicity in
[1:48:20] which you deal with our lives Lord amen
[1:48:23] there's not Lord there's not but one of
[1:48:26] us that would say Lord from our hearts

[1:48:32] that Lord as we walk upon this Earth the
[1:48:36] days that we tread here Lord this is our
[1:48:39] desire is that Christ would be reflected
[1:48:42] Lord and that our lives would influence
[1:48:45] Lord someone else to you that would Lord

[1:48:52] hearts Lord even those Lord as Among Us

[1:50:06] purpose here Lord
[1:50:07] and that's to serve you Lord

[1:50:17] when we walk on Briar patches or rocky
[1:50:20] places they Lord are not easy places to
[1:50:24] rock to walk but I think of the song
[1:50:27] that says through many dangerous trolls
[1:50:29] and snares we have already come but your

[1:50:35] safely carry us home

[1:50:59] Lord give us Lord of Grace that we might
[1:51:02] submit ourselves that we might be more
[1:51:05] of a servant to you Lord and that's not
[1:51:08] something Lord that we can do of our own
[1:51:10] self Lord but God you give us Grace Lord
[1:51:14] and that's the grace that we need Lord
[1:51:17] each moment Lord and father when

[1:51:57] sister against some Lord may we cast
[1:52:00] those things down lord may we not
[1:52:02] entertain it Lord I pray that God May
[1:52:05] Our Lives be so filled with your past
[1:52:09] that life of the Passover Lord that our

[1:52:50] amen
[1:52:52] I don't know about you I'm challenged
[1:52:56] I'm challenged
[1:52:58] the Lord began to deal with my heart and
[1:53:00] more that began to open a lot just just
[1:53:02] wept said God help me
[1:53:04] help me Lord help me
[1:53:06] help me Lord
[1:53:09] so often so many times we can look at
[1:53:11] things good Brian get something in your
[1:53:13] heart that you want to sing so many
[1:53:15] times we can we can look at things and
[1:53:16] we can look at it just from this Avenue
[1:53:18] and we look at it from the perspective
[1:53:20] of I'm the innocent one I'm the
[1:53:22] righteous one I'm the
[1:53:25] is that right
[1:53:27] but yet in the midst of that time say
[1:53:29] Lord
[1:53:30] this is a moment
[1:53:32] that I can become
[1:53:33] more of a useful tool
[1:53:36] where he's purging you it allow him to
[1:53:38] purge
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:40] little things that have
[1:53:43] because you know what a little sucker is
[1:53:44] on a tree it's something that'll never
[1:53:46] produce
[1:53:47] fruit
[1:53:48] but it's like it takes away from the
[1:53:51] life
[1:53:52] and so he comes along and he'll take
[1:53:54] away all them little suckers on that
[1:53:56] fruit tree
[1:53:57] he looks at certain branches he looks at
[1:53:59] certain places in our life and he'll
[1:54:01] trim it away and you know what a real
[1:54:03] fruit grower does when they trim
[1:54:06] if you ever look at the apple trees and
[1:54:07] look at them as you drive along the
[1:54:09] roads if you ever look at them you'll
[1:54:12] notice inside of the apple tree they cut
[1:54:13] it so that the light can go down into
[1:54:16] the apple tree now I'm not talking about
[1:54:18] ones that we people just let grow in
[1:54:20] their backyard like crab apples I'm
[1:54:22] talking about when they're raising the
[1:54:23] Honeycrisp the gala apples the Jonathan
[1:54:26] apples all of those
[1:54:28] apples they will actually they study
[1:54:30] that tree and there is someone who comes
[1:54:32] in there and they'll cut it so that the
[1:54:34] light will reach the center of that tree
[1:54:38] why
[1:54:39] so that it would produce fruit
[1:54:42] I'm glad he knows how to get to the
[1:54:44] center of my life
[1:54:45] he knows how
[1:54:47] say Lord help me just just help me help
[1:54:49] me to surrender my will
