[Applause] god is so faithful so mindful each of our needs i just want to greet each and every one of you certainly certainly thankful for each and every one of you testimony stand thank think very much you know when we we look over proverbs 31 and uh i know that there's a there's a great spiritual application within there but you know it's it's just something about it that it's a beauty that god has placed within your heart as a mother something as a father and so forth it's an attribute that god put in there it's an attribute that in its own time in its own season it comes out and there's things that you just can never mother can never turn off nor can a father turn off it's there and just to see that that working you know and just how important it is you'll find through the scriptures and i know you're aware but you'll find in the scriptures where paul would speak to timothy he would you know admonish him remembering what was placed within his heart even from his grandmother eunice and his mother you know god has a way how god deals with hearts and lives even when you look at this you know you think of moses mother brother brown would say it in this way that how that god dealt with her heart that she knew that there's nothing could happen to that child brown said it like this he said that when moses was put there in that little basket and he said she was so certain god would keep his word to where she was standing waiting for pharaoh right at his steps to beckon knowing that god there's a promise that god has made no sometimes we look at things it's like when you think of mary willie will speak a little bit of her this morning but you know god would speak through his prophet to our hearts in this hour and he said and he would dramatize it and say as mary would speak back where the enemy was trying to come against her she would say my mother has planted the seed in my heart it takes god to come and quicken amen but the seed was planted [Music] and you know it's nothing that we we have done but it's all working in god's great economy so we just thank god for that this morning i also want to remember brother joshua spoke with him yesterday evening spoken on the phone he just wanted to say thank you for remembering him in prayer he's been dealing with a lot of pain and discomfort because he had the surgery there on his leg supposed to leave the hospital yesterday morning when the therapist and those had come in he was in just a lot of pain so they wanted to try to get all that under control and so lord willing he'll be discharged here on monday so we just had prayer and we want to just continue to remember our brother in prayer that god will just continue to move for him because the whole process is where he'll have a control on the outside of his leg to cause that leg to straighten out and come in line a lot of work one millimeter in the morning one millimeter midday one millimeter before he goes to bed he has to do all of that from the outside so that that femur bone the rod in there i'm just praying in this way god will take that body and cause it to receive that to become one to take that substance god will just bring that right down in life hey if god took a piece of wood and raised up an axe head yeah he's god he's gone amen so we just want to remember our brother in prayer let's just let's just look to him right now you have a need on your heart i know prayer requests have already been taken but god knows he knows that he cares heavenly father lord as we just approach your throne of mercy right now this morning your god we are aware and we become more aware of our littles [Music] our inabilities stand before us but lord by your grace we don't make excuses we surrender we ask the lord that for each and every request lord there's been many and there's requests upon hearts that lord that are here lord we just lord want to invite you to come and minister to these needs i pray that god that you would just continue to move for brother joshua lord you know lord the need that's there your god you're the same god who multiplies selves lord i pray that god that you'll just move upon the bones and the tendons lord the ligaments the muscle that's there oh god the nerve i pray that god that you'll just move for our brother lord may there be a releasing of the opium from the lily of the valley who'll may you just touch our brother lord strengthen him lord and i pray that god that you'll just cause everything that leg to come right in line with the other leg oh god granted lord there is nothing too hard for you father for each request now as we look into your word and pray that god that may the holy spirit just take it to every heart right where it needs to be because we need to hear from you lord we just give ourselves to you now father in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and god bless you this morning you'll turn with me in the scriptures to john chapter 19 verse i'm 30. going to read just one verse of scripture and then we'll just let you have your seeds when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost it is finished all that was needed all that was to be fulfilled in order that redemption plan could go forward and come to completion he could stand at that moment and say it's finished that's the reality with everything in our lives in our hearts healing salvation deliverance the holy ghost it's a finished work it's already been for it's already all what has needed to be accomplished has been accomplished may god bless the word as you're being seated i just want to speak continue just for a few moments on that thought of the finisher and when we look here at this this very phrase that is uttered out from the very heart of the lord jesus here is the lamb of god that's offered up and not only was the body offered up that alone wouldn't bring redemption but but the soul being offered up he shall make his soul an offering for sin the body offered up so we not only would receive healing within our soul the spiritual part but we receive healing in our body it is finished and you know when that when that same voice that same reality rings in our heart that is where it comes into the heart of the art of the believer that the sin question then is set you're finished with sin finished with unbelief finished with the world it's finished and when we look at this and you think of where he is standing here in this moment and it's and the words it is finished i want you just to remember and let's look here just for a few moments of how that his life as he's as he's journeying on in the fulfillment of his word i want you to be very much aware of this this morning and much very intentional even starting here this morning that in each part of the life of the lord jesus and every other scriptural character in the bible and in your own life there was a purpose that was given by god it was not something that just at that moment was being spoken but it was god coming and god fulfilling what god thought and god spoke and god caught the prophets up into and they uttered or repeated what god spoke and now the word is coming into fulfillment so this this is an acting out of the word that has already been spoken and anytime god speaks it's finished when he said it is finished here it's now the fulfillment the manifestation of what was already thought and already spoken now it's been acted out but from the very inception right there when god spoke it it's finished there's nothing can detour nor change the course nothing jesus said in john 4 34 my need is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work john 5 36 i have a greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness to me that the father hath sent me i have glorified thee john 17 4 i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do now there was a lot of other people on the earth and have lived on the earth that they've had their purpose but then not everybody's purpose is an eternal purpose some purposes like just raising up pharaoh pharaoh was raised up for a purpose in order that the glory of god might be made known because god would raise up a ruling power which knew not joseph in other words knew not the god of joseph whose heart would be hardened he served a purpose but pharaoh's purpose was not a purpose that was found on the right side of prophecy pharaoh's purpose was a purpose that would be against prophecy that would stand against the fulfillment of the word but it wasn't man fulfilling it it was god fulfilling the word amen and this is where the lord jesus is here he's declaring that the what what has been allotted for him to do him this is what he's focused on this is what he's given to this is what he even draws strength from in his life do you recognize that even in the fulfillment of the word he's actually as he says my meat is to do the will of him to send me the finish the word there is there is even a strengthening in finishing and serving the purpose of almighty god and so when we look at this we recognize that this is a very important part in this of what was prophesied and what was even there from the mind of god where the lamb would would suffer before the foundation of the world but if we could like a like a drama or let's say just like a lens that is that is set out before us and sometimes we can get so zeroed in and we're focused in and there's times for that and then there's times where the actual picture itself it's got to be pulled back the limbs in order to see everything else that's all around it and what's taking place and so when we would take this lens back here we move from from this uh very fulfillment to say it is finished we bring the prophetic lens of god's word back and we come into isaiah 9 and 6 and i know this is not the first mention of it but we come to this part of it where it speaks unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever that's still going on amen let me just announce to the devil you can't stop right amen you can't stop it it's going on once the word the word's been spoken it's set in motion let every devil of hell rise up can't stop him are you hearing me notice the very last phrase the zeal of the lord of hosts we'll perform this amen does god use actors he does but he doesn't use their strength it's god performing his word it's the zeal of the lord of the host when you consider how they were looking and waiting for the messiah let me just tell you something that was god that put that in their heart that was god that already a seed was so there and that word was pulsating in their heart of waiting for the coming of the messiah because they knew when the messiah comes there not only would be an offering up but there was another promise that was connected to the coming of the messiah and that was the outpouring out the holy ghost [Applause] the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this isaiah 7 14 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel very important the lord himself amen amen this is him amen completely hill if it's part even one percent or even nine tenths of a percent it's not the fulfillment of that verse but the fulfillment of it the lord himself without the instrumentality or the aiding of man god doesn't need your help he doesn't need my help he he's the one who spoke his word all he needs is for believers to believe it so as we zoom back zoom back from your life and you recognize how that god in this myth brother branham would say it like this and proving his word he caused the virgin to conceive to prove his word god caused the virgin to conceive in order to prove his word mary was already ordained but god calls her to conceive in order to prove his word god doesn't prove his word through debates are you hearing me that still calls the word into question god don't prove it by debates he don't prove it through arguments god proves his word through believers the bible says prove all things and hold fast to that which is good amen to prove it is to receive god's vindication god coming and god proving his word by making it alive by making it real and then in order to hold fast to that you have to turn loose of everything else [Music] god knows how to bring us to that because there's things that we have as human beings as a safety blanket yeah right come on now linus ain't just a character in charlie brown there's a lot of linuses they got safety blankets but you see all god all god has to do is come back one of his children and when his word is being vindicated there is a power within that word that reaches beyond our understanding to turn loose of things that we thought were absolutes and we release them for a true absolute that lays hold upon our lives you see as we come back even a little more i want you to think about what we just read with isaiah never never has this ever been done upon the earth where a virgin shall conceive amen never has this taken place you have to trace this clear on back even to the very first creation of man but god didn't use a woman then are you with me god didn't borrow a womb all right but you see in order to do away with the very curse of the serpent and that first birth that first birth is condemnation are you with me in order to undo that that's why the question should resonate in your heart why did it have to be a virgin birth why did it have to be an act that was separate from man and woman why did it have to be that way so that our real true birth would not be tied to a man to a woman to a system to an organization but there's nobody else and no other place that we can rest upon but upon god and to stand there and say i am a son of god i am a daughter of god i have been born of god i've been born again [Music] imagine isaiah the brown would say it like this think of this the embarrassment when he heard god say i'll give him a super sign isaiah embarrass me because a prophet he's here he is caught up into a realm and what he's going to speak god's already spoke so he's caught up into that ramp and god moves him beyond his senses and he speaks a word i think this is very fitting he speaks a word that is beyond sensible realms and what that prophet and that prophet himself says was embarrassed but he knowed god would keep his word he would prove it there was a part of him that was embarrassed but there was a part of him that believed it the part that was embarrassed was not a believer he could never ever believe but the part on the inside that was a believer that said though this is impossible but god has said it and god will keep his word amen [Applause] thank god for isaiah god had to have isaiah on the scene but remember isaiah was not a superhuman what was it he was in his position at that moment surrendered to god to sp to speak things that were declared to be impossible isaiah how would you look at this group of people to believe in this hour for the impossible when the very atoms and molecules of your body are going to be changed when the rapture were the sweet of the holy spirit coming over the earth let me just drop this here just for a moment do you understand when you look down through you see all these things that they're making a lot of really detailed issues about all these ufo sightings there's been more in the first part of this year throughout you know what that is that ain't foreign intelligence those are investigating angels those are lights in the heavens the same angels that went down into sodom to investigate it for judgment it's the same lights now there's things i know they're trying to talk it away oh this is sleeping underneath our radar oh this is doing this but let me just tell you what the prophet said one of these days one of those lights are going to drop down and pick you up [Applause] we're living in the hour of a fulfillment to say that to the rest of the world let me just say this even among christians and i use the term loosely you can almost consider a kook a lunatic and not because you believe in a transforming work of almighty god you know why you believe that because you've already experienced the change of your soul you've already experienced a supernatural spiritual resurrection and you're standing in a double portion not only for the spiritual resurrection there shall be a physical resurrection this is the hour of grace grace the hour of the [Music] glory to god generations pass talk about how the families would buy the children their daughters every hebrew kind of they were looking for it you know is my daughter going to be the one is my daughter going to be the one i say what an awesome expectation i mean what what more could a you could preach a real family service on this what kind of an expectation of where this should be it's ultimate cultivating expectations in the world is it okay right if it's not i'm going to preach anyhow sometimes we we appreciate other things we want to see maybe our children to be successful this but i've said this over and over and i mean with all my heart i don't care if they were pushing i don't want to really see them that they're pushing a broom but i would rather their soul be so filled with the holy ghost god let it be that that's the expectation that i set before beyond any career beyond anything else i don't want them to depend on their own efforts i want them to know god isaiah spoke this word it circled it circled the earth it kept going hundreds of years hundreds of years till finally the time got just right and here upon the earth here was the vessel that god was going to use god was watching over mary's life for a whole time let me just say this her mother anna when she had conceived mary god was watching over that there was a part that she had to play let me just say this there wasn't enough devils in hell that could take mary out so here comes a time in her life 18 years old here she is she's espoused to joseph god has everything right in his time knowing that this must be first and here the angel gabriel he comes to a certain city see god's specific god is not a general god amen right somebody in here has a headache who it great but god when he sends a word he's got your address on it amen when god sends a word he knows your name god knows exactly the heart god's very specific he sent the angel gabriel with the word of the lord to the city of nazareth to a virgin that was espoused to a man by the name of joseph who was of the lineage of david look at all the specifics that had to be in line amen but god had it that all the specifics of where they had to be he would all be in line at the right time amen and he lets mary know thou art highly favored of the lord amen the lord is with me even when mary was a young girl the lord was with her god watched over the whole time no doubt she felt a lot of temptations and a lot of pulls and a lot of pressures and she had a lot of things come her way no doubt maybe she had different offers and other things that would come her way but there was a part about it you see god gave grace that she might be reserved to the part that god had for her to serve let me just tell you let's pan let's zoom in a little bit god has watched over your life god has made sure that nothing can take your life not even your own despair of your own life could hinder god from working when you feel like there's no use no use in going on but god because he's got an appointment for you grace is given for your life and let mary you're here because god made a promise in his word [Music] wonder like mary america said huh now i see why there were things in my life certain roadblocks were put here and certain guidance was put here all those things god was orchestrating for this moment amen she goes let me just try to move upon this and zoom back out from this coming from it is finished on the cross and here you see her coming on a monday morning and here she is going to the well normal pattern and here the angel here the light appears and in that and in that light here the form of an angel comes forth it's gabriel and gabriel speaks to her in verse 30 of luke 1. fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god amen what did she do was it because she read the scrolls and she prayed she did that but favor was given before any had done good or evil the favor of god is not something that is merited nor is it deserved the favor of god is god unfolding himself to his children in that season and that hour man i'm highly favored i'm out of the city and city nazareth hey there's a there's a lot of cities that's bad cities all around but just like in every city there's good and bad yes are you with me but nazareth didn't have a good reputation come on you don't have to look too deep in your family tree it didn't have a good reputation but god wasn't calling you based on your family tree because god don't want to see that tree blossom he wants the tree of life to blossom in your life he wants to graft you into that real reality by an experience to where you're no longer bringing forth the fruits of this earth of this world of that first birth but your life it bears the fruit of that new birth of that tree of which you really are a part of the lord i want you to listen these words i know you're familiar with them but behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus shall is not maybe are you hearing me shall is not maybe blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be healed shall is not maybe shall is in his church when when it's time for the word to be fulfilled the word that it would be fulfilled in the hearts of the subjects that are intended for that word to be expressed through there's got to be a certain sound that comes through the word and the word itself gives a sound that reads in the heart of the believer a certainty that they can stand upon supernatural experience notice he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end amen then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing that i know not a man the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee no questions it's certain amen it's a time when the word is to be fulfilled it's a time where darkness might have obscured it but question marks are over it presuming about it maybe it means this way look over to this commentary maybe it means this but there comes a time when now it's god who wrote it who supersedes commentaries little bits of inspiration that can come off of it and now it comes a time where god says this is my word amen amen therefore the holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god notice how he draws her attention to her cousin elizabeth now she's known about elizabeth elizabeth who was also called baron that wasn't a real quality term to be used in that time that's right to be known as his barren remember hannah prayed that that reproach would be taken away is that right now notice how god comes with the word already letting her know six months ago there's been an event take place and you've known about zechariah's and elizabeth but she is with child and he makes a statement to her for with god nothing shall be impossible amen amen what's he doing what is all this that's going on he's causing her to look at the word he's causing her to look away from her own self he's letting he's controlling her focus to i'm the god who keeps my word i'm the god who who specializes in the impossible you can never face nothing in life that's right if you get your eyes on anything except god you can you can't do it you get pulled right into it you trying to put it together you trying to straighten it out you trying to do this and you know what happens you only get frustrated god don't need your help [Applause] he don't need my help he is the one who comes and fulfills his word oh god help us notice what she says behold the handmaid of the lord she just presents herself behold the handmaid here is the vessel here is the lyrics what is intended in this work behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word notice mary is coming into a place within the drama and in in this right here it's a word position so being that it's a word position she can only be brought in position in the word by the word so then where she's standing is upon the word now you see within it brother brown would make this statement i want you just to just to catch this mary knew it was going to because god had said so look at this just for a moment think of the promises that god has made for us they shall their hands on the sick and they shall recover is that right take him at his word don't doubt anything go right on believing it'll be all right god promised it god will perform it god watches over his word to keep it and to answer prayer amen it's just you see it comes down to the same way of a real genuine experience a real genuine experience with god is not based on any works it's not based on a sensation it's not even based on lights it's based on the word of god where you know in yourself that there has been a passing from death unto life so your faith is based in the word of god it's based on the sensation you're in trouble because a lot of times you don't feel god and you don't feel like a christian but your experience is not based on sensations and feelings it's based on the word of god you might have feelings there can be sensation but you cannot faith cannot rest on those things all of this when we come back this is god's doing let me just remind you the scripture in psalms 118 23 this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes it's speaking of the whole work coming to pass here not only of the redemptive work of the lord jesus but now the outworking of this and the phil and the finishing up of this work in our lives let's look at this just for a moment the bible says in psalms 37 23 the steps of a good man what's a good man we need to know what a good man is what's a good man it's a righteous man amen it's one who believes in god that's a good man the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way now let me just try it just trying to move into these pieces here let's look at another part that was taking place so brother samuel what's going on from the cross it is finished but when you come back you recognize there's all these other parts that are having to take place that are integral parts here is zacharias let me just say it like this zacharias as the scripture said it was a certain priest that the angel gabriel the same angel that visited mary that same angel came to zacharias what you think of this here is zachariah standing here for sake of time i'm not going to read it but here he is standing here his his his wife elizabeth first cousins with mary they are old and well stricken in age they've been praying for children i wonder if every devotional time they were praying they weren't every time that when he was no doubt in the temple he's offering up the prayers of others he's no doubt offering up that prayer oh god that you would bless our home lord with a child he's been praying this for years and years and years and years you think there one time said that the devil didn't try to whisper in his ear and say god doesn't care about you sure there was surely there were times and no doubt there might have been other barren ones who were in the community but them barrenness only lasted maybe a year or two years or five years or ten years their barrenness was not in the same time frame as god are you hearing me they've got a choice they can either count on god and complain and say god you want to answer it why don't you care but there's something within them that they keep praying they keep believing these aren't superhuman people these are believers that are encompassed about with infirmities they have to battle and cut through the darkness of discouragement just like you and i do they don't only see things but they had to stand there and cut through the eyes the lies of the devil that would try to whisper in their ears come on somebody he's that devil slip right up next to the prophet and what did he want to tell him when his child was dying he never told him well you know that god god didn't do this and god didn't do that but what he wanted to let him know was is he don't care about you you see you've got to know god cares about you that he loves you and burying enough devils out of hell that is able to stand on a promise when you operate by the love of god because love produces pain but when the prophet was standing there and he said i was about ready to say if that's the way it's going to be it had already come down and almost there was almost a conception in the mind he was getting ready to come out but there was a greater revelation there was a greater power over the inside what was it god gave grace this was part of the fulfillment part of that position brother let me tell you something this is why there is nothing as great as the prevailing power of the revelation of jesus christ in your life amen hallelujah for even when you have trouble seeing yourself that doesn't alter what god thinks praise the lord god made a visit to zechariah here he is in the temple right now they were just and devout and you know they had a home that could invite god is that right but when sometimes when you read these things don't make it off as though it was their efforts that brought this to pass right it was god moving in their lives they were just in love with the lord let me tell you the secret of how that they got through all their times of discouragement because they were just giving themselves to the lord amen amen are you hearing me now they were giving themselves to the lord you've got to draw strength from somewhere right let me tell you something going and shopping and running up your credit card ain't going to give you strength it's going to give you stress it'll perplex you it'll put tension in your marriage come on preach with me now he's on the scene he all those other things will never satisfy you can get a new car you can get a new house you can get all that it'll never ever satisfy there's only one source of real true satisfaction that'll stabilize you and that is the word of god zacharias here the angel comes and he makes himself known to zephorize here's what he says in verse 13. i want to read this one fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard how long they've been praying long time you got that right they wrote it so long song leader didn't even need it no more just knew are you hearing me what does this say to you and i don't ever give up on god's word if god's made a promise you stand on that promise because heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall never fail you might feel inspired sometimes you're right and you might feel lower than dirt the other times it doesn't matter the word's not based on feelings lord tell me what i did was it that i read the right right scroll did i do it just right no it's my time amen it's my time you see the experiences of god are predestinated moments even when you receive the holy cause it wasn't just but i got to a place and it happened that was a predestinated moment from the hand of god whether he's in the church whether it's in a car whether you're at your home no matter where it's at it's a predestinated experience with god amen amen hallelujah that prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear a son and thou shalt call his name john praise the lord boy boy i'm just trying to behave myself here zechariah asks the question whereby shall i know this i'm an old man my wife is well stricken in years let me just say this to you if we were putting zechariah and mary together zechariah probably knew more of the word as far as than mary did right zachariah he could only remember which he knew about sarah well stricken right hannah well stricken come on somebody yeah all of these conditions that were deemed impossible but there's a great difference in knowing the word amen glory and knowing the god of the word amen god used a woman who was not a priest was not trained in the temple but all it was it just took the word and for her to hear it and say how's this going to be because i don't know man and god laid out his word it'll be the holy ghost and what did she do she just presented herself behold the handmaid of the lord here's zacharias and he's asking what's going to take place i want to read this verse 19 i am gabriel that stand in the prince of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these glad tidings and behold thou shalt be dumb that means not able you know to speak or to hear and not and not be able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believeth not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season it didn't matter if zacharias he couldn't understand it it didn't even matter at that moment if he didn't believe it he had already prayed his prayer by pay has been in the presence of god and god said because you don't believe it right now you're going to be gone but i'm going to fulfill it anyhow let the world call us crazy let them say we lost your mind carries a let them say there's no real true baptism of the holy ghost there is a true holy ghost that brings a change let him say he don't heal the sick no more he's still healed for sin let him say he don't deliver he's still delivered he still casts out there he doesn't make any difference but about their own belief god rides right over the top when the devil said you'll never make it you'll never be a believer but god already saw you as a believer it didn't matter all your unbelief you didn't matter all yours excuses god made a promise to himself and god's word from that word to bring it to pass [Applause] it sounds like god's determined i'd say you're right god's determined and he's going to perform it amen when god spoke anything he performs it don't let these just statements just go by when god speaks it there's nothing can take god's word away amen when god speaks it all heaven records it it's got to happen no matter how funny it seems how unreasonable it seems it's going to happen anyhow amen so now here we have elizabeth here we have mary remember coming back from it is finished here they are boy you get two believers together got the same kind of experience [Laughter] look out man look out yes when mary here she is coming to elizabeth elizabeth sees her coming when mary greets her and expresses to her what has taken place in her life as mary rehearses that promise there's a reality in that rehearsal it's not just words it's a salutation where the very name of jesus is spoken elizabeth here she is that baby she hadn't felt no movement it's been six months and felt no movement but here when the salutation of mary comes think of this it couldn't happen in any other time god arranging things just in this very manner what was it that set mary in motion to go to elizabeth the word amen and now as she comes to this place and she expresses the working of the word in her life by the holy ghost what does it do it causes a dead baby to come to life hallelujah where there was questioning the baby is not moving now here the baby is brought to life she feels movement in the womb oh god let it be that hearts and lives feel movement in the womb amen and elizabeth makes this declaration i love this scripture and i luke 1 45 and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord let me just say this i know these are simple statements but sometimes we get in the heat of the bible battle and we forget right i'm not condemning i'm preaching to every one of us we forget the simplicity god never is wrong [Music] he's always right though you can't understand it believe it anyhow amen god is the one who interprets his word he interprets it by bringing it to pass to sincere and honest hearts if you're sincere and honest you got a question god god will come and he will answer that question think of this here here is joseph here's another part in this drama you see before what we read let's just move back up to our text before we could read what we read it is finished in our text each of these parts had to be fulfilled you can't go back and do somebody else's part it's the part of the word that we're called to fulfill it's the part of this hour this time this day our message where we're at right now and here is joseph a man that the scripture would speak is a just man he did not want it when he found this news from mary i like how brother branham would tell it because when you look here in the scripture you realize that joseph was also a man of integrity right she's 18 he's 45 years old quite a difference i mean that's kind of the parallel you look down through scriptures it was quite an age gap and all the way down through scriptures a lot of times between husbands and wives but here god has all this arranged at this time and here is joseph he has a question in his heart brother brown says mary would come to him and he could see in her an honesty and a sincerity he didn't see it at that moment he didn't even recognize he didn't know what was taking place he didn't even know if i can say it this way that he was part of the promise his name was not mentioned it was not said of how that would be of a husband but it would but here it was identified in that part of the world he didn't know that it was necessary that his life would be a shield for her life because if they have not been espoused already you see the timing of god is so precise if there hadn't been a spouse that had been no deliberation she'd have been taken out and stoned that's an unclean woman right man but god already had the basis covered can you imagine what joseph thought what have i got myself into amen come on now there's times that you start second and question yourself amen right there's times when there's things in here you can receive and you you've got to settle peace on it you say you know i believe this is the will of god you're not inserting yourself but you really got a peace about it because the peace of god will always cut me the will of god but it's sometimes where it comes and your tribe when situations or conditions arise and you look at it and say what in the world is going on but god's perfection is not our perfection his perfection is the perfection of his life working and performing his work this was necessary and because joseph he stood there as a sincere man in an honest heart he thought about these things joseph just didn't check out after church he encrypted right he pondered he prayed about this god what is this i thought for sure i had your leading i thought for sure on this spouse i thought for sure i don't understand what's going on here right i don't know what's happening she's so sincere she's so honest let me tell you the story mary couldn't persuade i don't care how much that mary could quote the scripture and say this happened to me this happened to me this happened to me it took god to come and meet joseph amen individually why as a young person older person it takes an individual experience and meeting with god it can't be a mother's experience a dad's experience pastors experience prophet's experience you've got to have your own experience with jesus christ amen amen but the angel of the lord made a visit wasn't a prophet on the scene at the time so god visited by dream and god told him within it fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife he walks joseph all the way through the scriptures everything being done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet think of this how that then joseph once he woke up out of that dream he was convinced amen he knew the angel of the lord had visited him amen he had questions when he went to sleep he woke up with answers amen oh glory be to god he did he wasn't he didn't answer them god put him to sleep and answered his questions that says a lot to you and me god doesn't need our intellect god only needs us to rest to relax to yield oh i'm gonna get the holy ghost i'm gonna get the holy ghost no you're not you need to rest and relax and say god come feel this tabernacle this is your word this is your promise it's not our efforts it's not our pressing it's not our struggling it's our yielding yeah my mind there comes time for john to be dedicated now when they come into the temple to dedicate john remember the custom is the calling after the daddy's name he can't hear and he can't speak but let me tell you something god keeps his word amen amen that boy wasn't gonna have no other name that's name was gonna be john the priest went to call his name zacharias and his mother spoke up not so right is that right then they they said well there ain't nobody in your family named john god ain't interested in continuing on our family genealogy the gospel ain't a family thing it's a god thing ain't nobody in your family name this way but god's doing a new thing amen amen so they motioned to zechariah you know the story they give zacharias a slate he begins to write on his name shall be called john and as soon as that name is called out they read it off of there god loosens his hearing god loosens his tongue and it begins to prophesy under that of the holy spirit you know what he begins to declare as soon as the holy ghost loosens his tongue oh my from a state where his ears couldn't heal and his tongue couldn't speak but as soon as the time and the moment of the word to be fulfilled his tongue is loose his ears are hearing and it comes open and it begins to identify this is the moment what the prophet says spoke up this is the time this is the hour this day the scripture is fulfilled this is a time where god has made promises promises but now is the time of god fulfilling his promise amen it was a time of fulfillment let me just say it like this when you look at this here comes that taxation these are all familiar things but now here comes time three months later for the lord jesus for his birth but it can't be born in nazareth that's right god allows he causes caesar to get an urge to tax the people sends them back and says you got to go back to your land of your nativity joseph oh it just happened to be no it wasn't it just happened to be it was ordained by god he was of the lineage of david he was from judea and it was going back to bethlehem true man are you with me i hope y'all you're with me on this sometimes there's things that happen in our life there's really two there's really almost two problems sometimes there's distractions distractions are things sometimes that we allow satan to distract us from the real purpose amen they aren't trials they're distractions and sometimes we can get caught up in those distractions are you with me and sometimes we'll call distractions oh i'm going through a trial no you're wrapped up in something that you got wrapped up in yeah it's not a trial you got distracted i'm gonna preach it anyhow then there are trials trials are predestinated appointments by god that he will take and really use to mold our character shape us and get us in position amen now distractions can be used when we learn from them all things work together for the good right not all things are good right [Music] are you with me this is where as a believer where we're looking this is where even the monitoring the guiding and looking to the lord in our life i tell you yeah we're looking to the word brother if we're we're zeroed in on that word we don't have to be focused hard oh i don't want to be distracted i don't want to be distracted how can you be distracted when you're attracted are you hearing me now how can you be distracted when you're attracted but satan does his best to get us distracted this taxation they could have grumbled about it could have complained about it could have done all those things it'd been logical for human i mean which one of you would say hey i'll pay more taxes right not me buddy i don't want my hand up in here i'm not looking to pay more taxes it's not something you would look at but this is something that god is using to get them in position it's all in the plan of god sometimes you don't understand why certain doors have been shut it's god's ordained plan to get you in position god knows how to get his children's attention god can close things down he'll send detours he'll put everything in order to get his children in position where they need to be because his word can't fail god's made a promise and god performs the conditions had to be just right we wouldn't have looked at those conditions and said man them are they're more a premium condition no we would have said my goodness what a hardship what in the world is going on what in the world but if you'll notice every time when there's a fulfillment of the word it's when the conditions are the bleakest the darkest and the most opposite of what is called amen that's on design god designed that he can't make that happen but god allows that to happen man's choices as it comes into that place to come to that let me close with this here's a man by the name of simeon anna is there there's a handful of believers that's been waiting on the promise of god i didn't say there wasn't many jews there was many jews but jesus church when he came was a handful right that was really looking for him and the holy ghost visited simeon and he told him you're not going to die until i seen the lord's christ you know what simeon could walk he didn't want walking with arrogance but simeon knew he already has a believer he knew nothing can take me until god's finished right now right he didn't know before that time that his eyes was going to see the salvation of the lord but when that was spoken you think the devil didn't try to go to work on that you think the devil didn't try to send everything his way to try to deter let me tell you something when god speaks the devil comes against that to try to hinder that word dumb devil you've never been able to stop the word you'll never stop it you can't stop it when the word has been spoken it shall be fulfilled [Applause] there wasn't a sickness to take him off the earth until he had seen the lord's christ i don't care what they would have whispered to simeon simmons you better watch this hey you know you're an old fella now you better watch it it just takes one little sniffle buddy and you can be gone but simeon said but he said i'm not gonna die till i see the lord's christ give me a little bit of cough medicine but i shall not die can i see the lord's christ his faith was in the word and god's word can't be defeated until the purpose is served [Music] and when the purpose is served when it's finished then god brings his children on home those that's gone on before in this age that we're living in we've got a promise there's not another message to come that's right true there's not another age there's not another messenger amen that part that part has been fulfilled amen god don't need it reenacted now it's time for the word that's been spoken by god through his servant in a certainty and put a certainty in our hearts this is our time this is your moment this is your time to where you can stand right there in the face of the devil and say you can't touch me right until god's finished amen sometimes we're so busy trying to get things you know trying to make it just so perfect well this wouldn't happen if so-and-so wouldn't have done this if so-and-so hadn't done this so and so when they've done that someone said you know what maybe you should have been on the council board in heaven man god should have hired you as the director of human resources god doesn't need our help the only needs are yielding to him there are trials along the way all the trials are molding and to get us in position nothing's out of order amen the background the setting sometimes the setting changes for us but even if you change the setting on a believer you can't change a believer put them in nazareth put them in babylon put them in satan's e you change the setting on them you don't change a believer a believer is a believer is a believer no matter where they're at they're a believer [Applause] amen amen let's pray heavenly father this is your word god just these moments lord of just individuals here word that was spoken they lord themselves they were not aware that they were the people the person of whom that word was going to be acted out through the god in the moment in the season you had on the scene who was supposed to be on the scene grace was given lord to get every every part in position lord i believe your grace is given right here to our lives grace that's given lord to get us in position grace that's been given lord to bring us into the place of fulfillment lord in your word a place of god to just to recognize and to yield lord to you who's the finisher god you gave strength to life some just a portion of lies that we looked at here this morning gone under your direction we could see we know by experience that lord there were times in their life they were discouraged times that they prayed for things and they just didn't seem to they didn't see any results but father as you spoke to zachariah thy prayer has been heard lord every word is sure there's an appointed season [Music] mary left that that moment that encounter and she began to testify she didn't feel nothing yet there was no sensation [Music] she didn't feel anything but she left from there with the word of the lord lord it was finished it was settled behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to that word god i pray right here lord in this congregation this morning [Music] lord may the holy spirit that's just been sweeping lord through the congregation just speaking to our hearts lord just just lord encouraging our hearts lord in faith know that god that there are predestinated moments there's events lord there are things lord where the enemy tried and he tries his best to try to stop you but he can't stop lord god i know speak to hearts and lies that even lord as they would sit here this morning they never thought lord that they would be here never thought lord that how that you've moved in their life something they could have never imagined lord even thoughts have gone too far but god you reach down you move beyond what was thought to be too far and you reach down oh god and drew their hearts to you now father i pray as we read about this with zacharias with mary with joseph with each one of them lord as that part was being fulfilled they served their purpose they finished their course now lord i pray grant it this morning [Music] if there's one heart lord god that's without you may you just move that heart and may they move with the real sincerity maybe they've had questions lord but may they not just keep those questions but may they put them before you lord may they ask you lord may they invite you o god that you would come down and visit them you still visit the same way you visited joseph you still visit in a personal way it may not be through a dream but god you'll always come where there's sincere hearts that are looking to the promise are just honest you'll come lord may you come lord fill every empty heart may hearts be emptied that they might be filled may you encourage those that are discouraged lord may you give strength to lies lord to stand lord god against all feelings against all thoughts of doubt against thoughts about themselves may they turn those down lord may they lord take your thoughts of your word into their heart for your word it cannot fail to grant it lord for every single need lord we ask in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] she was [Music] overshadowed her four years and said that you'll conceive a
