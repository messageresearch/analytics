things that are behind us and reaching forth to the promised Lord that lays before us Lord annoying at any moment at any day Lord God will be caught away or Jesus we ask tonight the Lord that you would just come just take your word Lord help me to get out of the way and ask you to strengthen my body Lord also each and every one of your children there's many that are sick among us they need a touch from me so I ask that God that you'll strengthen us you touch his father for Lord we will hold that promise in our hearts you're the Lord heal all our sins we thank you for your mercy now father we ask it all Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ would you stand with me tonight you want to go right into the word and they have to bring me some hot tea up here with honey that's what I've got in my office so that I may have to actually have to do that so if you see a cup come up here it's not coffee I actually haven't had coffee in a few days believe it or not I just need the help of the Lord here tonight seems like each time after I get done with a winter youth retreat on boys kind of struggling with that we just we just want to look to the Lord tonight and I want to read Psalm 62 certainly thank you for your prayers Lord just just moved wonderfully in the services we had there I had a couple of the mornings brother Andrew took the first two nights and then I had the first two mornings just teaching laying things in with the young people and then for the very coffee took the last morning their teaching and brother Paul really really preached a real tremendous service their own vessels of Honor and spoke about the pressures of this age that are up on young people and really got into something very personal and I think it was just I tell you what I just told by the pause that has you a preaching I said I just it's almost like you could hear change just fall off off of lives of things that even where the enemy would tried to hold condemnation over people's lively just was falling I've just seen just powerful and then we what helped us to come around the last knighting and just Minister there and they in the closing service and so I I just appreciate your prayers I if I expend too much energy right now talking about it I may not get through the message here tonight but to know that your prayers I don't always get a chance to share with you the reports in and I'm not one to always talk about the Lord did this and the Lord to do that if God puts on my heart to talk about a healing or something like that I'll do it but I just there's just so many things that the Lord does in a meeting like that you see so many needs being met those needs and the spiritual and those in the physical as well I just I think God for being so merciful and so mindful he's just such a person of God and you know what to see it that you look at that with the young people you know brother Brian had such a burden to teach the young people to actually train not just preach to him but brother Brown would actually in his early days but grandma she says it's in the Hebrew series he would actually take the young men one one Sunday and teach them about pressures that was upon them then he would take the young sisters the next Sunday afternoon and he would teach them and train them on certain things so we need that I just I think the young people are really really blessed within that to have that teaching of the wording and the ministry so we want to go here in the scriptures and I want to read this set of scriptures here in verse one Psalm 62 it says to the chief musician well I'll skip that name psalm of David truly my soul wait if upon God and once you snow 'test these words truly my soul waiteth upon God from him and cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved now if he makes a statement like this i shall not be greatly moved it shows that there is going to come pressures that would try to move him from what his soul is waiting on you know like the saying is true a faith that cannot be tested cannot be trusted how long will you imagine mischief against a man he shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall you be in as a tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from his Excellency they delight in lies they bless with their mouths but they first inwardly save my soul wait thou only upon God notice that my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him and wonderful to have an expectation where did you receive that expectation from from him so when God gives a word and that word is revealed to our hearts he releases to us the strength even an expectation to wait on that word to be fulfilled my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god amen may God bless you as you're being seated I just want to take just a few moments probably I won't preach tonight I just don't have their I don't have the strength but I just can exhort it to teach on some things here or just to give a little exportation on the word my soul waits on the Lord is what I'd like to talk speak to you about this morning you know when you look at it David along with all the Old Testament Saints the the elect of God remember there was always an election even in the Old Testament when the Bible says there in the book of Matthew the 24th chapter you may have to give me a little bit more volume because I'm not gonna pry raise my not for me but for them can you all hear okay or you need you need a little higher thank you I figured that probably in some other time people wish they could turn me down what will get back to there you pray for me tonight would you do that you pray for me tonight but in the Bible it says in excuse me in Matthew 24 that many of the saints which slept in the earth arose not and by the bran would draw our attention that he said see said it didn't say all the Old Testament Saints many of them those who were died in faith they were believing they were holding to that promise they were offering the lamb by divine revelation and so we see that there's always been an election the elect saints of God in the Old Testament you'll see where David will break over in the spirit of prophecy and David and many times will move in even in the Psalms and he'll move from something that is present to even move to the future restoration of the 144,000 and David Banda the Spirit of God will move to that because remember not one of God's words can fail sometimes it you know things look a little shaky but rest assured what God has spoken he will surely bring it to pass and we can rest in him so when we see this they were all looking forward to the coming the election was looking forward to the coming of the Lord there was an awareness within their heart they were looking for that and they were waiting on the outpouring of the Holy Spirit they were waiting on that that's why when you read many times in the Old Testament Saints and they were not swerved aside from the purpose of which they had been called to you read in the Bible where it talks about in Hebrews 11 and then you come to the end of that chapter it speaks of how many were sawn asunder many of them endured great afflictions they were stoned to death they did not have it easy they a matter of fact brother branham would refer back to them and refer back to the New Testament church that was starting out and brother Branham would use the term over and over and says where are the rugged Christians where are the rugged Christians and he would tie that into the place that that ruggedness of Christianity it deals with having that faith rooted and grounded in our hearts and there must be a trying of that faith to be rugged it means that there's not going there's not always going to be situations that make it easy there's gonna be situations which you know how speaking to veterans here tonight as well situations that I'll try you and shake you to your very core but it's in those situations that God proves to you not him to you and me what he's placed within us when we get to looking at it that way we say lord thank you and we get to looking at that way you know where the Wayman makes the whole bitterness of the trial just just go aside because we see God is letting us know what he's placed within us Jesus would make this statement in Luke 21 19 he would say in your patience possess ye your souls notice not my patience but your patience he has patience and we must also have patience our patience must match his patience amen and it takes his patience to release to us what we need for our patients but in your patience possess you take take a hold of your souls here is John in Revelations 1:9 I John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the isle that is called Patmos for the word of God for the testimony of Jesus Christ as he said before what John would receive here what a glorious revelation of the kingdom of God coming into power John would witness the coming of the Lord in the unfolding of the Holy Spirit in every age he would witness the coming of the Lord where in the second coming for the claim of the Gentile church that bride that he's redeemed he would witness the visitation there to the Jews in the 144,000 he would see them standing with victory he would see us standing with victory on the sea of glass clear with a complete reflection of the Holy Ghost in our life as an overcomer he would see the complete he would see clear through the Millennium and through the future home but this revelation did not come without a price it was not something that was what we would see favorable conditions you would think such a revelation like this that maybe he should be in on a velvet bed you know a very nice comfortable place with people waiting on you but you see God God so places it like this that it's not just about John this was for John's perfection but this is also for our admonition to show us within this time that to a true believer though we feel the discomfort of circumstances around us the light John and like Daniel we can stand by God's grace as an overcomer no matter where we're at were an overcomer no matter what situation we're in we're an overcomer why because greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world that's why we're an overcomer so here in the patience of Jesus Christ not to think of this remember on when they would come when John would say repent for the kingdom of God is at hand and you would see where the kingdom of heaven is at hand and it would seem at hand that it should come right there but at hand would simply mean to prepare yourselves for it is coming and you see if God were to give it away has to say I'm gonna come at this day and this hour and this moment it would not produce a patience in our lives or awaiting it would produce a laxness we're in that we would be then become hurried in our lives to somehow but you see within it all let me just say like this as believers it's something that within our hearts that our desire is looking for his coming staying on our toes every day and waiting for his coming looking for the fulfillment of this promise I I know there's been many that's been around been around us even before us they've had this figured out draw this out on the chart this is gonna happen this way it's gonna take place this way all of that is a lack of patience patience says God has spoken he will bring it to pass because when something is figured out then it no longer requires faith you're walking by your reasoning but when it is by faith it's not something that you have all figured out and waiting for stages to happen but you're looking to the Lord and knowing that if there is a progression for fulfillment God is there to guide and direct you until it all comes to pass that's like brother Branham it's a huge little little sentence but it has a big statement we could preach months on it the rapture is a revelation and yet to understand the rapture is a continual unfolding that rapture of the revelation is why no matter how long you've been serving the Lord that's why every message has been preached that's why every exhortation has come why the rapture is a revelation it's God unfolding to you and encouraging you and I it's continuing to quicken us quicken us quicken us why that's his work until finally the final moment of that comes in these bodies are changed that's the patience of Jesus Christ he's not worried is his patience we're in the kingdom were in the patience of Jesus Christ we also have as John would say tribulation I want to draw your attention also to another scripture in Revelations 3 verse 10 it says because thou hast kept the word of my patience so once again here is the patience of God thou has kept not I've kept it thou has kept it see God deposits a word in our heart it's up for us it's for us to keep it water it make sure weeds do not encroach on it that's it that's a full-time job isn't it have you ever noticed around your house I never cease to amaze me that the plants that I have around my house whether it's my hydrangea whether it's my roses whether it's my hostas whatever it is it's amazing why do the weeds grow near that plant or close to it that have the same leaf formation as that plant first of all I didn't plant those weeds and who put that there I mean seriously you know what I mean you have to get down on your you have to get down on your knees because sometimes you I don't want to pull up the high drain I mean we've you know worked so hard to get these snow balls to come on this thing you know you're on your hands and knees many times that's where we have to be in making sure weeds if weeds were there and weeds weeds were coming but when you see that just it's our duty to take care of this garden of our life because our life is a garden a bride the term garden in the Hebrew is figurative of a bride we are his garden where he comes to find rest a man in that room the Holy Spirit comes to find rest in our life he can find no place to sit down like the Dove but he finds place amen in our hearts I'm grateful for that aren't you because thou hast kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation and that wonderful in that hour of temptation but the RAM talks about is where he said the pressure comes to say you don't need to stand against this system you can serve God in this system as well as you can apart from it but see holding fast to that word even when you don't understand everything but you know what's important is you know who has spoken to you and when you know who has spoken to you it holds you in the hour of temptation for we truly are tempted we are tried we are tested God does not remove the temptation but he gives us the strength to endure it all of that which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth now brother Branham picks this up and he says what does he mean by the word of his patients he says Hebrews 6:13 through 15 for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply me and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise and notice what it said after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise where I really could preach on that this is Abraham's life Abraham has given this promise when he's down in the earth of cow B's remember Abraham brother branham and faith is our victory to take us into a place to say Abraham knew that the Lord God had spoke to Noah he came to a place in his life he said Abraham one day prayed and said lord will you speak to me like you spoke to Noah in the powerful to have living examples so not just a word but a living example to see there was a word that come and it was not Noah that fulfilled it it was God to fulfill it through Noah and he said I so God comes speaks to Abraham and I think of this I don't know perhaps Abraham just got finished with making an idol he was a God maker he was an idol he was an idol worshiper he made gods yeah so then after he obtained the promise he patiently endured he he doesn't fully obey at first then his father dies he finally comes to a place coming into the land he's doing his lot of rounding it comes to a place he forsakes in the land and the pressure runs out of the land and here he comes back into the land he almost loses his wife all these things you know as it goes on and on but here's what I'm saying after he patiently I'm sure you know Abraham had a patiently endure even through all his mistakes Oh his mistakes because the word had already been spoken they you and I we don't have to have his life that it took a lot of grace it also took his brother Bramblett tell us and a message look he said where Abraham had to focus out all the misunderstandings on the promise what was one of the misunderstandings Ishmael he had a constant reminder before him of his own self-will see there were things that all around Abraham that the enemy could have poked at him to try to cause him to step aside but he received strength and patience from the Lord he continually received from God strength within his life we we don't read it in the scripture but we know Abraham we read points where Abraham prayed but you know it was not just in those portions of scripture Abraham prayed and he would call out to God like we call out to God like we pour out our hearts before God after he received the promise he patiently endured I wonder how many of we could have been watching he bring me to say scratch this gal never make it but to remember what God was calling was the word he already sold in Abraham all it takes is that word to come into the presence of God and the Word of God coming it brings transformation because this coming to pass of Isaac in his life was to say like this was the coming of the Lord God bringing his word to pass in his life you see when a word is given that's God's promise and when that word is fulfilled you do not reckon that word as somebody else but you say when the word is fulfilled you say that is the Lord is that right we are looking for his corporal coming but until that moment every other word that comes to pass is God coming in his word it's his coming to us personally glory be to God the brand goes on to say he says the spirit here is speaking about the Word of God which is given to us that's what this is is speaking here the word of my patient if the spirit is speaking about the Word of God which is given to us to wait for the fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham he endured as seeing him who is invisible how many of you have prayed or are you you are praying about something and you're looking for and and and you you have in the past there's things that you've prayed for and you've waited on you've looked to the Lord the testing and the trying comes in the time of waiting I would asked is there anybody that undoubtedly when you pray you'd like to see it happen I can put both of my hands over yeah I mean you take for example or you know sometimes we can have we can have a meeting and you can see miracles being done remember there's gifts of healing gifts of miracles whether that would separate the two as Paul did in the scripture times after you see miracles that'll take place no matter what the meeting that's a meeting here whether it's a meeting you know in other places our faith is never to expect for a miracle when we pray but our faith is to expect according to God's Word sometimes sometimes after you'll see things happen you know you you can begin to pray and because of how what you've seen happening you can pray almost with the thought that it it's gonna happen you know sometimes we get into that atmosphere and the atmosphere is not bad you understand the atmosphere is not bad it's just like pardon me I'll just go out here on maybe on a limb but you know when I've had brothers in the past and years gone by when they I wanted to challenge me on the church age book and they thought they had points on that and I'm not a I'm not an arguing but you're not going to that book right there you're not gonna take that book from me there's been a lot of scarecrows put up around that and shame on the people who's done it but it's just one of those things they sometimes they can only say what they've been taught and taught and Taunton but here's the point when they made a statement brother branham's made said I predict I said what's hard with that I mean you said it's a private student of the word I said what's hard was that he's under the inspiration God has not showed him that I said but how many times and I asked the brother I said how many times have you been in service and you thought a certain thing was going to happen and it didn't happen I said once your prediction or your thought wrong I said see you thought under that atmosphere I said but the thing of it is I said is to realize we can stand right on God's Word I mean when we in bringing that to the point of we can come into an atmosphere and we should come into that atmosphere but the atmosphere don't let it take us into an atmosphere of that that well Lord I mean I'm expecting a miracle we don't have a promise of a miracle but we have a promise on the Lord that he left all that diseases if it comes by miracle caused by a miracle that comes by divine healing it comes by divine healing however it comes it's gonna be God bringing and when it comes I'll say that's the coming of the Lord it's God coming in fulfillment of his word in my body is that okay I mean I want to get I want to get in the atmosphere I want to get into that when it's coming forth I might say hi you know I wake up the next morning or this or that and things get worse but you know if things come as believers were taught to realize we come right into the word and say well Lord forgive me for I had a little thought about this but I leave it in your hands because you're worried cannot fail he was patient with rum said he was patient the next paragraph there and then the word finally was fulfilled notice he was patient and then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people patience why if he fulfilled his word in physical manifestations the very instant you pray kinda like instant pudding you would never learn patience but would become even more impatient with life think about that impatient with life so when we take a promise of God and we pray over it God he teaches us patience when we've prayed remember James said we are not to pray with wavering faith we are to pray and ask God with faith believing brother bana would put it like this in the prayer letter remedy all doubts in your mind let it all be set aside is how do I do that to know first of all that God made the promise and if there was an ever nother mortal on the face of the earth he made that promise for you so there's not listen it's not a question is it the will of God no God's Word is his will so it's not a question is it God's will to heal me that's not a question it is his will to heal me it is his will so then now we begin to look and see it differently then we wait on God to fulfill it the Bible says by faith Abraham and 11 Hebrews 11:17 by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises the Word of God offered up his only begotten son there it is Abraham was tried after he received the word of promise he said most think that as soon as we pray in Jesus name over the good promises of God that there could be no trial but here it says that Abraham was tried after he received the promise and in all points Abraham was continually tried all the way till it come to Genesis 22 offer up the only begotten Son in what took place on Genesis 22 God already knew about it you understand God already knew about this this was Abraham's faith being expressed in God's Word he offered up Isaac and God let him God let it be known when he come down Abraham thou has obeyed me in all things thou hast not withheld even thy only Son I wish I could preach on that for a little bit that right there is a mystery of the rapture right there in Genesis 22 in that life of Abraham his brother Bram says we like Abraham walk to Mount Moriah he said for what God has done in our hearts by the quickening power and changed our nature we walk to that promise and God will surely fulfill that promise he brother BAM picks up again here in Psalms 105 he picks up about Joseph look at this word this scripture we've read this but to think of it in this until the time that his word came the word of the Lord try do you realize that from the time that Joseph had the dream in Genesis 37 he dreamed a dream his brothers got envious of him everything that took place it would it be 15 years until he would set on the throne he would be rejected not by foreigners or strangers but his own brother he would be thrown in a pit they would sell him there into Egypt all of this we would see this it's going on he's out of place no God's getting him in place you see sometimes tests and trials in our life we would think as though it's taking us out of place our flesh and our spirit gets vexed it gets out of place but God is bringing us into place this is why you get a chance at some time read in Genesis 39 maybe I'm one of your devotions or something you're going through a test you're going through a trial it just was so dear to my heart Joseph when he's here he's in you know the prison then he he comes up where he comes to Potiphar's house you know then as he comes to the prison so forth every one of those times these are the phrase you'll see in Genesis 39 as you read through it the Lord was with him it says it multiple times in there the Lord was with him in the prison in the prisons the Lord was with you you see God has said I will never leave you nor forsake you I will be with you even unto the end of the age this I will say David spoke at Paul picks it up by inspiration this I will say the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man can do unto me I will trust in the Lord what am what a time that had to go to take place but you see what it was the word it tried Joseph he didn't understand what was going on in his life but character was being molded many times we pray and we have prayed and this goes from where were a young person middle-aged person or an older person no matter what the promise is there's times that we pray and we're looking for the fulfillment sometimes the waiting can also scriptural term that can be used and it will say delay but God doesn't delay you say so brother Samuel what what is it from the time that we pray until the time that God answers what takes place it's not a nothing time God is Moldy character throughout this time it's like as a young person prays and says oh I've been praying for a mating I'd been praying but really could say this is what I've prayed for that's the will of God that belongs to me so what should I do Lord that my life be made ready let me be made ready see all of these promises it all comes together as scriptural principles when his first coming remember his first coming they missed him because they had it all figured out and because he did not come the way that they thought he should come they rejected him are you as he didn't come the way they thought they rejected him instead of at that time they should have let their character be molded by that word cuz God listened what God does he molds our character to fit that word when it comes to past cuz that word has within it the virtue and the strength what's needed to more our character because after all the word is not coming to passed out here the word is coming to pass in us it's God bringing his word to pass so sometimes wonder what's going on why hasn't this happened I've been praying about this and this that covers a hole that covers a whole thing and you know what we are all oh I don't care how how long you serve the Lord we're all tested upon that sometimes I know when I think that man when I even had been in pain sometimes in my back and last winter youth retreat I had to you know my wife had to help put my socks on me and things you know because my back my goodness and you're praying you think I can't even matter what it felt like to feel normal it only been a few days and sometimes as it as it lingers and goes on you know all the thoughts there's all kinds of thoughts ago three of mine will I ever get back to normal again well ever hey that don't mean you're not a believer the word of the Lord is being tested yeah it's a testing but see your patience in this is his promise he made to me and he cannot fail my soul waiteth only on God notice not on my thinking about this no I'm waiting on God brother brems goes on to say don't you just appreciate the message of the hour my he said God give us exceeding great and precious promises he has for promise to fulfill them he will he will but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer oh boy from the time we pray until how long son till until Peter we thank you you think we've been here long enough no no he said until you've endued with power from on high until how long son until said Lord yeah that's not Lord forgive me don't let that impatience creep in cuz we're living in an age we're writing a reading about this MP you know we're living in an age an age of impatience I mean a couple years ago we're sending in the Amherst McDonald's and please don't put me out of the message for unit McDonald's but had to have my organic little cheeseburger and we're sitting there you know and and you know a and this guy walks in and night you know there's so much insanity and dance it's insanity everywhere this guy walks in and he just starts mouthing off and everything in the walk he said I put my order in and he said it has been five minutes I thought this guy's taking fast food a little too literal he was and you know then he just really starts spouting off and so I went to get up and you know at the same time you're like well do I get up or not but I don't like I don't want my family hearing all that nonsense there was two other men you know that kind of corralled it things but it just what I'm saying is that we're living in an age of impatience it's all around I mean people are patients when they are a patient when you drive oh it's all impatience I told brother oil in the Philippines I said with all the traffic and you all don't have traffic lanes that's it but what I've noticed about all of you all your more courteous your more courteous we've got traffic lights I said him there's not courtesy it people are upset but it seriously they don't traffic likes you who AM you kind of know how this is you know it's the horn the horn says look out I'm coming you know I'm baby I'm coming in but I noticed that I said what to me is what is that I said what character I said because they'll yield and it just go ahead and go I said what courtesy I couldn't do that here I mean it's true but from the time we brain until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience look at that we must learn to receive patients in our source I may say Lord I want to receive patients for only inpatients do we possess life brother Ram goes on in the latter latter quote if the last part in there he says they talk about those Christians and that Philadelphian age he said the last line of that says they were so patient and quiet and today we are all but overcome in over-over impatience what a word over not just impatience over in patience I mean you know look at it today I mean I graduated high school I should be the next CEO of Apple tomorrow over impatience but you see that's a spirit of this age and listen that spirit of this age is a spirit that comes even to attack the gospel all of this like brother Ram talks about in the message countdown he talks about people hurrying going here going there he said people is there is such a rush such a rush such a pressure don't have time to get here don't have time to get here and this and that and all of that bits pressures that adds up its pressures pressures that come upon the people and we don't there's no way to do away with the pressure but we do have a place to go to where we can let off the pressure is everybody okay Hebrews 6:12 I'm just going to go through some scriptures here Hebrews 6:12 that ye be not slothful this lawful means really just just stationary it's become kind of relaxed about it that you be not slothful but followers of them who through patience and faith inherit the promises Hebrews 10 36 for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he shall come he that shall come will come and will not tarry Paul would write in Hebrews 12 and he wouldn't had Mohnish us to lay aside every weight and every sin that does beset us you notice Paul gives the authority of the word as it comes to the believer just see that's the authority of the word when the word comes isn't when the word is coming in a service you realize what that is we're not standing in the outer court we're not standing in the middle court but like Esther we are standing in the Kings Court and the scepter is extended to us when the word is coming you take that word and you stand upon that word amen and with the authority of that word listen you have the authority and with all heaven backing you laying aside lay it aside and let us run with patience the race that is set before us this is not a sprint it might be a good sprinter sometimes you see a lot of good sprinters people can sprint you know for a few years it's not a sprint this is a race with patience I don't know if you've ever kind of noticed it or not sometimes those pictures witness will pop up and and you you look at a lot of those guys that win the marathons those Boston Marathon's and other things you look at those guys they look like beam pose hi ingress it have fun they look as skinny as Paul how many summer so skinny they don't look like sprinters you know what sprinters look like those guys are built in there all stocky and built but you see it isn't about how much built out here it's about how much are you for the endurance because this is not just short quick little Sprint's it's a race of endurance the things you know is you've got to run through and you seem to get weary you you have to keep running this is why Paul would say in Colossians 1 11 that shoe his prayer was that you would be strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness in Luke 8:15 remember the types of ground that the seed comes in the Bible says but the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience how did they bring forth food with patience it isn't something as just turning its with patience this is why James 5:7 would say be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draw with night as I said before it's character molding that takes place that's what's been happening with and that's what will happen with all of our lives once God has placed his life within our hearts from that moment on here we are looking for the coming of the Lord that's that's what we're waiting on we're not waiting on the next best job open for this to happen that's all those things can be fine but our sights are not set on that our expectation is the coming of the Lord that's what the Church of the Living God has waited on down through the ages Paul would write it as though that it was going to happen in his time did you see what it is it's how that that word when that word it comes to pass we are a part of that promise that's why you make the decisions that you make you've got choices that's why you make the choices you make why because of the coming of the Lord that's why brother Brennan would say and how can overcome he says that he is coming for those who are living for his coming living for it so there's a character to be molded through all the tests through all the trials through everything that comes our way there's a character and this is why brother Brown would ask the question he said we must have a character that is fit to stand before God what will be the choice he said will it be a character like his own glorious character that was molded through the fiery affliction of suffering he said or will it be this soft characterless lady of seon age we see that this was this was a quote that the Prophet made in the churches but we see this now we see and listen you can look at government you find people characterless that are completely that that's out there you find these these you find out but here's the choice that we have will we allow God to shape our character in the midst of this time I want God to save mine and in the shaping of it Lord help me just to be patient when I don't know what's going on but just to trust you you know he knows what he's doing you see this is where the scripture it says in James 1:2 my brother encountered all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be entire and they may be perfect and entire wanting nothing I didn't notice that I I've noticed that over the years but let you let patience have her perfect work not his/her/its submission he's working he's working I don't know what all it but Lord you're working I don't know how it's all winded but I know you're working and this is why remember and um pardon me I need another coffee on this is why that that don't mean I'm gonna go another look at the time like what I just went but it's not a button I can tell you buttons don't taste like this just a few more moments this is why when we look at the seven virtues in the Statue of a perfect man these are all virtues that are sealed within the heart of the believer in other words it is the quality that is already in the seed that the life being present within you it will bring forth in the hour of trial those virtues manifest himself under trial they're not just you know you're not just out there exerting well here's patience here is this temperance here no no these are all under trial its alms one the man planted by the rivers of living water they all come out patience where does patience come out when you're being tried this is where patients come up where does temperance come out self-control where does that come up you're being tried sometimes when we have not exercised self-control then we have to repent oh we've got impatient but you see within at all what's happening there is there is an outworking and an abounding of that life working through us for the brem said if you've got faith it will work patience if you've got faith it will work patience you have to have patience toward God he said he said we pray for something he says you know and God says anything genuine faces God's gonna bring it to pass not well I prayed last night for my healing and look at me I'm so I'm sick on the dog right now you know oh my what patients is that but patience is looking at the word of the Lord and who made the promise patience is looking at him Abraham I mean he spoke of that already to know with Abraham and here I want to just I want to leave this this last little part with you out of the fat tyrant age notice what God says and I think I gave you this quote the fat iron age God says I know your faith now he does not say here as he did to the church in Pergamos you hold my faith you realize God is separating your faith from his faith he is not talking about his faith now but he is commending them for their faithfulness you know faithfulness is something you it's shown you showing like what the Bible says forsake not to assemble yourselves together God does not pick us up and do it for us faithfulness displays itself and being in the house of God when the doors are not just because to be regarded as faithful but as be faithfulness is to the Lord for what the Lord will do it's faithfulness to the Lord see God works with faithfulness the Bible says in Revelation is 19 has he comes upon the white horse with as you know after he's already made himself known to the hundred forty-four thousand he slips back up here we are gathered up from the wedding supper and we're coming back down with him and revelations 19 - the Battle of Armageddon the Bible speaks that they who rode with him were chosen and faithful faithful God rewards faithfulness faithfulness is not easy there's times when you don't feel but faithfulness is to the Lord he's not talking about his faith now but he's commending their faith them for their faithfulness and as he or does he also mentions their patience known as their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness and a quotes James 1:3 the trying of your faith worketh patience look at this statement there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of our faith there's no other way it's got to come by the trial of our faith you see this is why I can look around even the assembly here or you know you know with others you know just we just had a meeting here Tuesday night their brother Royce and I seen brother Shawn Martin and his daddy was there brother Martin and I just got a chance to talk with both of them but I got a chance to talk with brother Martin I had met him I was down at the meeting years ago brother Martin and I look at him and I think also none of him but also of others that I can look across this assembly that to know there's been a lot of trying of your face there was many I could point out you served the Lord longer than I have and to know there's been a lot of trying of faith and a lot of patience that has been accumulated over that time you know what happens with every trial in every test as we're waiting on the Lord even it's sometimes when we you just almost feel like you're coming apart hey the Bible said the patience of Joe you know how the tests and trial even with Joel the Bible said his breath was even strange to his wife I mean it there was a lot of things that took place with their underneath that trial but yet Jobe brother Graham would say it and I have her but now I see job stood flat-footed on the promise he said even then he didn't win didn't know what was gone he stood and here's the thing the patience that you have in the trial you're in now is because of the patience that's been accumulated in previous trials those are experiences that's why the Bible says patience then experience comes hope see because now in the trial that you're in or the testing you're in or while you're waiting once you've prayed there is a hope and expectation of patience because of experience it all works together and it's yours personally you love the Lord how highly God regards this outworking of our patients and I by the Browncoats at Scripture in James 1 for this last pair of graph theory says God's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God how many times we see in the scripture where people have done things for God Eve tried to do it for God Sarah tried to do it for God is that right and things were they tried to do it for God and missing but to wait here's the thing if we're waiting on God then we can rest assured if we're waiting on the Lord and just looking to him you will not miss when he brings his word to pass this is the process of character development look in Psalms 37 7 rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prosperous in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself and any wise to do evil for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait on the Lord they shall inherit the earth even in the trial you're going on and it's going on remember to inherit the earth me who speaks of what the inheritance of peace so even in the midst of that trial this is why sometimes as we're looking at it and when we do we do this naturally out of our humanity at this boss or this one or that but to realize God has placed that there why his character development it's character development God molding God's shaping God refinery so this is what I'm saying as I've said to some in the past I'm not saying that a person if they feel that of the Lord to pray for for another job but I would say this right here when the Bible says fret not thyself because of him here's what it's saying don't miss the moment of character development for God to prepare you instead of focusing on on the negative and everything that's coming around but give yourself to God say Lord I don't understand and you know I'm fixed in my spirit or my mind or my body Lord help me Lord help me to stand faithful in the midst of this time help me to be patient in the midst of this time this is why brother Branham could say you know even in the midst of it of how our patience is to be looking even with one another and just a few more scriptures here I'm from closing I had fainted David said I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living oh that's a truth in it I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the the living verse 14 wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord notices wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart the first part be a good courage is stand on that word this is what God has said and I will stand right here and by standing on that here's the promise and he shall strengthen your heart so as the next day come you have you have strength to stand with courage and even there looks like greater opposition and maybe greater symptoms display themselves that you have a good courage to stand on the word you stand your stand on the word he strengthens our heart the joy of the Lord is our strength it comes through the word of the Lord this is why when here we are in Romans go to Romans 15:4 here we are in the midst of tests in trying time this is why we need one another this is why we even we come to where as we come to the house of God this is just one or one of the one of the reasons that we might receive encouragement and strength keep pressing on not to where we become lats or you know disheartened with things but we're encouraged to take hold of the promise this is why in Romans 15:4 for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus that you may be may with one mind and one mouth glorify God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ think of this the god of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another the rapture is for the body of Jesus Christ we have heard the shout the Living bread of life the quickening power has come to get the people of God into a place in Christ like our Goshen in order to be delivered we are waiting in Christ and expecting this and Paul would say as we are waiting the god of patience the god of patience and consolation help us to be like-minded one toward another two to be able to be patient with one another but the bram deals with that virtue of patience in the statute of Rome and he says and that patience is also to be patient with one another sometimes there's things that you're praying about in brother Branham alludes to his own self he said for 30 years I've been preaching things right here in the tabernacle and I don't see certain things they're the bannermen the whole Eagle series he talked about how God showed him even a vision whether it be some fish they go right away and all of us have our challenges when it comes to patience but here's the thing God's Word cannot fail you might be the vessel that God will use so if this becomes a birdie things become a burden upon your heart like well I don't see this so I don't see this and I don't see this though why don't you say Lord what would you have me do is patience it's waiting on the word of God to come to pass and please don't misunderstand me I you know I hold my tongue a lot I'm out in different meetings and you come face-to-face with different ones and I unless the Lord has me to say something I don't ever say things to try to I when I when I and I hope you you would see this even when you fellowship with me I don't try to come and listen to and things are taught over you didn't finish this statement right or you cuz any fellowship I mean it to me is not fellowship when you it's all together with somebody's correct and this one correct and that one or you got any fellowship that to me is run a ship run away you know but so many times you you know you hear statements well I'm gonna go over this church because it seems like that they have more young people or I'm gonna go over this trick and you look around and you say you know the thing that it comes down to and if God gives you the wisdoms they say wait a minute what about your heart where's the patience of the Lord in your heart there's got to be a burden in every one of our hearts and in order for God's Word to come to pass it's going to require patience there's a patience we must have among one another we're going to hey let's face it we see we can see one another's shortcomings maybe not outright lay like maybe our spouses or the rest of our family but we can we can see we can see at times maybe ups or downs or or what-have-you but you know what within and all it written requires the grace of God with patience to be able to look beyond it I would rather I would rather be guilty of giving somebody the benefit of the doubt than to come right out against them I've done that even recently with we even reasoned with even a situation in the past few months just with you just within that right there I'd rather give somebody the benefit of the doubt maybe their thinking isn't real clear on these things I just rather give the benefit of the doubt within things or some things you you almost don't want to believe that are taking place but you want to give the benefit of the doubt be patient with one another and being listen because being patient with one another is also being patient with the Lord it all works together the person says I don't know I can't have no more patience then can you be patient for his coming see it all works together you can't separate it it all comes together and this is why say God if we could stay here tonight and I'm done I trust it's been a blessing to your heart I know I've had to go in a different gear tonight I don't mind this gear I don't sweat as much she'll feel just as anointed as ever but I would say tonight how many of us could say to the Lord Lord renew my strength renew my stream maybe you've gotten maybe it's gotten a little off on on something say Lord just renew my stream they that wait on the Lord he shall renew your strength he's faithful to do that let's pray dear Lord Jesus father you you see requests upon all of our hearts my soul waiteth on the Lord father for every every prayer there's prayers that have gone up before you I think of as it says in the Book of Revelations chapter 5 that the prayers of the Saints were offered out in Revelations 8 it speaks of the prayers being offered up Lord prayers where they have been praying for the coming of the Lord and they have waited they have looked forward in their generation and many have fallen asleep in their watch but they were faithful and with patience in that watch here we are in the seventh watch in the promised God of the fulfillment of the coming of the Lord the rapture of the Church of the Living God Lord were every promise all that is before us lord as I said there's many prayers that have went up there's personal personal prayers upon hearts ooh personal requests that's been made Lord even even tonight maybe a heart that is here that's desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost on their soul that promise holds true to them after having done the will of God they've repented of their sins they've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and after you have done the will of God receive with patients receive the word of promise Lord let them know that that promise is for them for every other prayer father we ask old God for a renewing of strength Lord in our lives a refreshing by the Holy Spirit Lord in our hearts roll God with patience and faithfulness then Lord we might stand as a witness Lord in this generation God you are faithful who made the promise you will not fail though you tarry it shall surely come to pass thank you Lord for that word of consolation I pray tonight God may our hearts just be strengthened the Lord and refreshed we give our hearts our lives the Fresh to You Lord asking it all now in the name of Jesus Christ amen come on in lead us in a few
