[21:24] operator then

[22:00] for his reader in that a wonderful
[22:14] reality a man that we walking by the
[22:17] grace of God by his precious blood what
[22:20] a reality that we can rest you know
[22:22] that's the that's the whole of our life
[22:24] as a believer it's resting in a finished
[22:27] work that can even that can bring
[22:32] ourselves from this point to this point
[22:34] but he alone is the one that brings us
[22:36] from this point to this point you know
[22:39] even in all of our efforts of what we
[22:41] could do we're still standing right
[22:43] there but he came that he might open up
[22:48] the way that he might bring us back to
[22:53] that relationship with God that we had
[22:56] at one time a man and then through all
[22:59] of that our everything it's him bringing
[23:01] all things working in after the counsel
[23:04] of his own will that's a reality isn't
[23:06] it I'll tell you what more and more is
[23:08] every day goes by and just it doesn't
[23:11] it's not great big things I think God
[23:13] for that but that's not that it's the
[23:15] little things that you witness how God
[23:18] is moving and orchestrating and putting
[23:21] things just in place and sometimes it's
[23:23] something you might have come across
[23:25] months ago and then the Holy Spirit will
[23:28] inspire it to you just when you have
[23:30] need of it that's so precious how God
[23:33] knows just exactly what we have need of
[23:35] and when we have need of it in it it's
[23:38] just every little detail within our
[23:40] lives I'm so grateful as he reminds us
[23:42] through these things I've got it all in

[25:32] don't know exactly what all that God's
[25:34] gonna do with it all you know is you

[27:43] for you to receive all glory from this
[27:45] service in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[27:49] while you're standing if you could turn
[27:51] in your Bibles to judges chapter 6
[28:14] judges chapter 6 verse 11 and 12 there
[28:20] came an angel the Lord and set under the
[28:22] oak which was at Ofra that pertained to
[28:26] joash the a Birzeit and his son getting
[28:29] in thresh tweet by the winepress to hide
[28:32] it from the midi knights an angel the
[28:35] Lord appeared in him and said unto Him
[28:36] the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of
[28:39] Valor a man you may be seated I want to
[28:44] preach on valor tonight for just a
[28:47] little bit
[28:48] when Gideon was there and the Lord spoke
[28:53] to him of course Gideon didn't feel like
[28:55] no mighty man of our he was hiding and
[29:01] he was fearful of the Midianites that
[29:08] they would come because every time that
[29:10] Israel would reap in their crops or
[29:13] whatever then the middie Knights would
[29:15] come and descend upon him and take
[29:17] everything and so he was trying to do
[29:21] this in secrecy he wasn't doing it out
[29:25] in the open and so when the aims of Lord
[29:28] spoke to him and said mighty man of
[29:30] Valor he didn't feel like no mighty man
[29:32] of Valor if he was to look at himself in
[29:35] his mental mirror he would he would have
[29:39] he said to the angel the Lord he didn't
[29:42] feel like no mighty man of Valor he said
[29:45] he told the angel Lord he said if if you
[29:48] be with us why is all this befallen us
[29:51] many times that's a frame of mind that
[29:56] we'll get into when we're going through
[29:57] things and seems like things aren't
[29:59] going our way and things are looking
[30:03] kind of grim sometimes we get into the
[30:07] mind of why is this happening to me well
[30:11] who better for it to happen to
[30:15] would you draw their be happening in
[30:17] somebody else I've I've experienced and
[30:23] been through things which I told my my
[30:26] wife I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy
[30:28] you know but Gideon then begin to speak
[30:37] to the angel and said you know why is
[30:39] all this and fallenness didn't God
[30:41] deliver our people out of the Egypt back
[30:45] years ago and why where is all the
[30:51] miracles and many times we look around
[30:56] and wonder where the miracles are but
[31:03] they're here they're here I I never
[31:12] thought that I'd ever have Michael it
[31:17] sure didn't look like it the way things
[31:18] were going
[31:19] but God performed a miracle in his
[31:23] daddy's life and set him free and then
[31:28] you know then along comes Michael and
[31:32] he's been a blessing in my life as well
[31:35] as my other grandchildren Michael I've
[31:39] had a first hand in helping raising but
[31:46] the Lord the Lord said to him surely
[31:50] I'll be with thee that's all we need to
[31:55] know it did the Lord be with us that's
[32:00] all that we all the assurance we need is
[32:03] that he's with us we shouldn't have to
[32:07] worry if we know he's with us
[32:10] we shouldn't have to - question how is
[32:14] he going to happen or house this one -
[32:18] how am I going to be delivered here he
[32:22] said I'm gonna deliver the people by
[32:24] your hand
[32:28] many times we feel like we're in
[32:30] situations where we think well there's
[32:32] no way I could deliver myself but God
[32:34] through you can bring about the
[32:37] deliverance Gideon had to have faith
[32:45] that God said he was going to be with
[32:48] him because all of the things that was
[32:51] going on that's what get he was saying
[32:53] it doesn't look like you're with us so
[32:57] he had to believe when the Lord told him
[32:59] I'll I'm with you then he had to just
[33:02] accept that believe that well we know
[33:09] that then the Lord began to deal with
[33:13] Gideon on how he was going to bring
[33:15] about this deliverance and you know
[33:18] there was thirty two thousand Israelites
[33:21] it seems like a lot doesn't it
[33:24] thirty-two thousand Israelites that went
[33:26] down to to go up against the Midianites
[33:30] and to fight against them and when they
[33:34] got down there thirty two thousand and
[33:37] in they were outnumbered and the Lord
[33:43] said you've got too many with you
[33:48] because God wasn't going to deliver them
[33:51] by numbers but God was going to be the
[33:55] deliverance God working through his
[33:59] people was going to be the deliverance
[34:01] and God knew that there was some of them
[34:04] their heart wasn't in it they had
[34:08] gathered there with the others but their
[34:10] heart wasn't in it they were fearful
[34:13] they were thinking maybe we better just
[34:15] leave things the way it is Gideon I mean
[34:18] you could just make it worse maybe we
[34:24] should just accept it like it is and and
[34:27] let it go at that they were fearful and
[34:35] so the Lord told him he said
[34:37] say to whoever is fearful and afraid let
[34:40] them return to their home and 20 mm 69
[34:47] almost 70% of the people returned back
[34:52] to their tents so here they were left
[34:55] with about 30 31 percent of the people
[34:58] left and Lord said you still got too
[35:02] many you still have too many then he
[35:10] told him said go down and said those
[35:14] that get down and lap like a dog set
[35:16] them aside those that get on their knee
[35:18] and lap from their hands set them aside
[35:22] and so then he set him aside and
[35:24] numbered him and there was 300 of them
[35:26] that knelt on a neat one knee and
[35:30] laughed out of their hand and God said
[35:33] this 300 that's the ones I'm gonna
[35:36] deliver you buy that's 1% of what they
[35:41] started out with 1% of what they started
[35:48] out with numbers doesn't mean that God's
[35:55] with you there's people that have picked
[36:01] their church they're gonna go to buy how
[36:03] big the church is how many people go
[36:05] there they wouldn't want to go to a
[36:08] small group they wouldn't want to go
[36:10] where there was empty pews they won't go
[36:16] to a big church I've talked to
[36:19] individuals who have left a message and
[36:24] one of the things that I hear them say
[36:26] well the church 1 2 now it's a big
[36:28] church so what what does that mean are
[36:35] you any more dedicated than you was when
[36:37] you were here
[36:39] no gain in numbers he deals with man in
[36:51] different numbers he deals sometimes he
[36:53] deals with them in large great numbers
[36:55] but sometimes he deals with him in small
[36:57] numbers and it's not the number that
[37:02] means anything it's the attitude in the
[37:07] number that you have you realize how
[37:12] much your attitude would affect a
[37:15] service and I'm not saying you actually
[37:19] have to have a bad attitude about church
[37:21] in order to affect the service you can
[37:23] have to be having a bad attitude about
[37:25] something else and you come in here you
[37:27] say well because you have this bad
[37:28] attitude about something else that's
[37:30] going on while I don't really feel like
[37:32] getting into the service I don't feel
[37:35] like amen
[37:41] I've seen people sit in church and pout
[37:48] there's ain't no place to coming about
[37:52] we don't want powders and dollars we
[37:58] want believers event we want worshipers
[38:07] churches get reputations I've told my
[38:10] church sis they get reputations by how
[38:13] easy or how hard it is to preach when
[38:16] you go there and evangelists I've been
[38:20] on the field myself and evangelists will
[38:22] kind of pass on word one to another
[38:25] oh you'll enjoy that church boy you'll
[38:26] have a good time there it's easy to
[38:28] preach or I'll tell you what I had to
[38:30] plow all the whole service at that one
[38:33] church or maybe they won't even say it
[38:36] they'll just say you're going there well
[38:39] god bless you brother
[38:44] I'll be praying for you I tell you what
[38:52] I love to preach where it's easy to
[38:54] prove whether people want to hear the
[38:56] word were the people the Bible says that
[38:59] if we hunger and thirst after
[39:01] righteousness we shall be filled and if
[39:05] we come in here hunger and in thirsty
[39:07] then God is going to come and fill us
[39:09] he's gonna meet those needs if we take
[39:13] those needs and lay them out I think a
[39:16] lot of people don't even get prepared
[39:17] for church they think getting revered
[39:19] search is figuring out what they're
[39:20] gonna wear it's not about what you're
[39:25] wearing it's not about how good you
[39:28] dressed or how poor you dress prepared
[39:34] to come to service if you got a need be
[39:37] praying and keeping that mindful and
[39:39] keeping that before the Lord that God
[39:41] will move he is a God of miracles
[39:50] keeping the good right attitude very
[39:58] attitude is a very important thing your
[40:02] attitude toward God affects your family
[40:10] your attitude about church affects your
[40:14] family I remember when I was just a
[40:21] young boy and we were going to church
[40:26] and my mom's family was coming in to
[40:28] visit us and they were gonna arrive
[40:31] while we were at church well my mom just
[40:35] left a key out for him and told him
[40:39] we'll see you when we get home from
[40:41] church that was a testimony that I grew
[40:46] up under not all mine my family's coming
[40:49] in well I guess on this church
[40:52] are you trying to get them to church or
[40:55] not get them to church you need to show
[40:59] them how important it is in your life
[41:02] what does church mean to you what is
[41:05] coming here mean to you
[41:06] is it dissing social gathering or are
[41:11] you coming here because it means your
[41:13] life divided down to 300 men 1% Benny
[41:27] begin to the Lord began to instruct
[41:28] getting on what he was going to do told
[41:31] him now you divide these these 300 men
[41:34] divide him into three groups and said I
[41:39] want the beach to take a trumpet and
[41:41] each to take a picture and he began to
[41:45] give him the instructions and get in
[41:47] then came and gave the instructions to
[41:50] the 300 men that were with him and said
[41:53] now we're each gonna have a trumpet and
[41:57] we're each gonna have a picture and so
[42:02] what we're going to do is we're going to
[42:04] Bowl on these trumpets when I give the
[42:07] signal not before not on your own time
[42:12] not whenever you feel like it but at the
[42:18] appropriate appointed time you're going
[42:21] to blow on your drum and you're going to
[42:23] break this picture okay that's all fine
[42:28] Gideon but how no word are we going to
[42:30] conquer these people there's less of us
[42:33] than they are then how are we going to
[42:35] be able to physically overcome them he
[42:38] said no listen to what I'm telling you
[42:40] we're going to we're going to blow on
[42:42] these trumpets and we're going to break
[42:43] these pictures and then we're going to
[42:45] we're going to shout with the loud voice
[42:46] and say the sort of the Lord and of
[42:50] Gideon y'all know the story when they
[42:58] did this it was such a clamor around
[43:00] they went on three sides of the company
[43:02] of the many knights and it was such a
[43:04] amer the Midianites thought that
[43:06] thousands were be falling on them and
[43:10] the Bible said that they the hosts of
[43:13] them cried and fled and they they
[43:19] dropped their weapons they dropped
[43:21] everything and just fled who was it to
[43:29] meet him who put the fear in their heart
[43:31] it was God and it only took him three
[43:36] hundred men to do it and some pictures
[43:40] and some trumpets they they never had to
[43:45] raise a hand imagine them coming back
[43:51] after this and telling the ones those
[43:56] 22,000 that were afraid and turned back
[43:59] so how did y'all do it
[44:01] we blew on trumpets and break pitchers
[44:06] what you mean you didn't have to fight
[44:10] oh boy I should stay you know we didn't
[44:15] need you because there was one other
[44:19] ingredient we had we had to have faith
[44:22] that this was what the Lord said to do
[44:25] and that in doing that he was going to
[44:28] deliver us so we didn't need no
[44:33] faithless ones down there with us
[44:42] the Branham says God always sends a
[44:46] prophet to bring deliverance to his
[44:49] people and I believe there's a bit of
[44:52] deliverance brought to us in this day
[44:59] the RAM said of modern-day prophet was a
[45:03] preacher
[45:03] I believe God sends preachers to bring
[45:07] deliverance and what do we have to do do
[45:12] like those 300 did with Gideon just
[45:15] listen to what the Lord has instructed
[45:17] them what the Lord gives them to say
[45:20] didn't listen to it how am I going to
[45:24] overcome this disease listen to what the
[45:27] Lord's got to say how am I going to
[45:30] overcome this sickness listen to what
[45:32] the Lord's going to say the real man of
[45:40] God will always point you back to the
[45:43] word you know that real man of God he
[45:49] many times you don't know what all he
[45:51] goes through and suffers in order to to
[45:56] be there to be before the Lord to bring
[45:59] you the word of the Lord
[46:01] Paul I think of the Apostle Paul he
[46:05] suffered many things Paul said that he
[46:10] was thrice beaten with rods once he was
[46:14] stoned thrice he was shipwrecked day and
[46:18] a night had been in too deep he was in
[46:21] journey often perils of water and pearls
[46:26] of robbers and perils of countrymen in
[46:28] peril of heathens and peril in the city
[46:31] and perils in the wilderness perils in
[46:33] the sea perils in the false brother
[46:35] Willard weariness and painfulness in
[46:38] watchings often in hunger and thirst in
[46:41] fastings often in cold and necklace
[46:43] nakedness
[46:44] and he said there was one place that the
[46:48] governor had sent out a degree to catch
[46:52] Paul and they had to let Paul down
[46:55] I'm a skewed out of the city that he get
[46:58] extinct and Paul said in all this when
[47:05] he talked to the Corinthians he says I
[47:07] have not been a burden on you
[47:21] gideon as i said didn't feel like a
[47:24] mighty man of Valor when he looked at
[47:27] himself he said he didn't look like no
[47:29] mighty man
[47:37] valor
[47:41] means that courage boldness bravery he
[47:49] didn't feel like this maybe you look
[47:54] tonight and say well I don't feel like
[47:56] no mighty person of Valor I don't feel
[47:58] like no mighty Christian how often do we
[48:05] ever feel like a mighty Christian we
[48:13] don't ever want to get to a place where
[48:14] we get lifted up and think I've got this
[48:17] took care of I've got this under control
[48:21] we always want to be dependent on him it
[48:32] wasn't
[48:37] we have not I sent the brother branham
[48:40] said he spoke to Gideon get him was a
[48:42] little surprised he said now mighty man
[48:45] of Valor he didn't know he was maybe you
[48:50] don't know you are you might be one of
[48:54] those mighty men of valor tonight
[48:56] sitting here you you say in this little
[49:00] church this small group yes it's not in
[49:09] numbers
[49:11] there was only two there him and his
[49:14] daddy
[49:15] and there's only has to be 2 here you in
[49:19] Christ that's all it takes to be a
[49:22] mighty man of Valor you and Christ
[49:29] you're not facing the world alone
[49:33] you got Jesus with he said I'm never
[49:37] leaving them forsake you even to the end
[49:39] of the world
[49:49] how do we know God's with us Gideon said
[49:54] if God be with us words all the miracles
[50:06] where the Brenham said it knows about
[50:08] all things he said now are we the sons
[50:17] of God not will be we are now and you
[50:25] people that's born again and you let the
[50:28] devil kick you around like a football
[50:32] how many how often we let the devil kick
[50:35] us around get to feeling like we're all
[50:40] alone well I'm the only one that's going
[50:44] through this particular trial oh poor
[50:47] you
[50:49] sometimes people get to thinking with
[50:52] their trial is worse than in each other
[50:54] trial anybody else is going through you
[50:56] just wouldn't understand
[50:57] you sound like a teenager grow up
[51:10] realize we all face things we all go
[51:13] through things and it's the same Lord
[51:17] Jesus that delivers me is the same one
[51:20] that delivers you same one to deliver
[51:23] the next person it doesn't matter what
[51:27] the problem is
[51:28] we've got the same Lord and he's
[51:33] Almighty there's nothing it's too big
[51:40] for him don't that there's nothing too
[51:44] small that's beyond his concern he cares
[51:48] about the least little bitty thing but
[51:51] concerns you the Lord allows us to go
[52:01] through things so he can prove his love
[52:05] to us so he can prove he's there for us
[52:12] he wants to be near us he wants us to
[52:17] have faith and courage that he's the one
[52:20] that's going to bring us through he
[52:23] wants us to have faith in Courage look
[52:25] you can do all you want to try to reach
[52:28] your family but it's not your efforts
[52:32] it's your testimony
[52:41] it'll take God to reach them but your
[52:44] testimony is the greatest thing that God
[52:47] speaks through what is your family to
[52:55] think about how do they consider what
[52:59] you think about Church like I said
[53:01] earlier where's all the miracles
[53:14] now is a time of healing now it's the
[53:18] time of miracles but how bad do we want
[53:23] the miracle I think about the Shunammite
[53:31] woman
[53:32] remember heard her husband he prayed for
[53:34] his son and the Prophet blessed them and
[53:40] they had a son and the woman told her
[53:46] husband said make build a room on to our
[53:50] house that when the man of God passes
[53:53] through he can tarry in this room he can
[53:57] pray in this room he can sleep in this
[53:58] room
[54:00] so he did and the boy grew and one day
[54:07] the boy was out in the field with his
[54:08] father I don't know the financial status
[54:14] of this woman and her husband but they
[54:18] did have servants I know that and the
[54:24] boy was out there and the Bible said
[54:26] that all of a sudden he said my head my
[54:29] head and fell over and the father told
[54:34] one of the servants says take the boy
[54:35] back to his mother so they took the boy
[54:39] back to the mom and she held him in her
[54:44] arms no doubt you know the way of mother
[54:48] would do petting his his head trying to
[54:52] see what is wrong and he had a fever
[54:58] cheating him what to do and then very
[55:03] little bit of time he passed
[55:10] according to the story in the bottle the
[55:12] woman did not become all shook up she
[55:16] didn't become all frazzled and fall
[55:18] apart but instead she took the little
[55:21] boy lady men on the bed in the room that
[55:24] they've prepared for the man of God then
[55:29] she told her husband I've got to make a
[55:31] journey I've got to get the man of God
[55:38] and this journey I don't know how long
[55:42] it took but it wouldn't have been a
[55:45] smooth journey they saddled up a little
[55:51] mount and begin to take her across the
[55:55] the road on her journey just to find the
[56:00] man of God and the servant of the
[56:07] Prophet said here comes that woman that
[56:10] you prayed and they had a son he said go
[56:15] ask her house all with her husband and
[56:19] house houses everything with her son
[56:23] you know her reply reply was all as well
[56:29] that's why I say she wasn't all tore up
[56:34] she wasn't all worried all was well why
[56:39] because she had faith God had spoke
[56:44] through this prophet and give her the
[56:46] son and she had faith that God would
[56:49] work through the Prophet and bring back
[56:51] her son she was in need of a miracle I
[56:59] don't know how long the journey took her
[57:01] but her son was laying there dead she
[57:05] had need of a miracle from God
[57:12] and she wasn't struggling with doubt in
[57:15] the story well I wonder you know whether
[57:18] I'll get this miracle or not no all is
[57:25] well he said take my staff from go lay
[57:33] it on the boy she said no no I ain't
[57:41] going to that ain't going to work you've
[57:45] got to come and so the Prophet wind and
[57:52] when he arrived there why he went on
[57:55] into the room where the boy laid he shut
[57:57] the door
[58:00] here was a mother and father out there
[58:02] waiting maybe many of you some of you
[58:08] have been there before waiting out in
[58:11] the area of the hospital why something's
[58:13] going on behind closed doors with your
[58:15] loved one you know and that God needs to
[58:20] work a miracle if they're going to make
[58:23] it and you know what's going on back
[58:27] there woman their husband they didn't
[58:32] know what the Prophet was doing back
[58:33] they didn't know what was going on they
[58:38] waited and they waited no sound was
[58:43] coming from the room and they waited
[58:46] some more maybe might have been the dad
[58:51] might have been pacing the floor a
[58:52] little bit I don't know what you're
[58:54] doing back there but maybe mother was
[58:57] like well it doesn't matter what he's
[58:59] doing back there he's here now
[59:03] they don't matter what he's doing back
[59:06] there he's gonna do it I just know when
[59:07] he walks out that door my boy it's gonna
[59:09] be alright cuz I prayed and I believe
[59:15] and he's here now God's here now see how
[59:25] how is it gonna work about this miracle
[59:28] my life it doesn't matter
[59:33] he's here now
[59:46] he prayed over the boy nothing happened
[59:51] then he laid down on the boy nose to
[59:54] nose mouth to mouth his hands on the
[59:58] boys hands and he breathed three times
[1:00:03] and the boy came to live imagine when he
[1:00:09] come walking back out of that room with
[1:00:11] that boy alive again
[1:00:16] she had need of a miracle and God
[1:00:19] provided a miracle he said I'm the LORD
[1:00:23] thy God that provided all of my needs

[1:00:45] been things that I know about there's a

[1:01:45] were approaching the end time but now I
[1:01:48] look around to things that happen in the
[1:01:50] government the things that happen around

[1:02:09] to utter in the time of the tribulation
