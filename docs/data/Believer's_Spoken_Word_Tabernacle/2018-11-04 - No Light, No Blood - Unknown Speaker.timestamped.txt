[33:48] as we sung here just moments ago like
[33:51] Enoch that type will be fulfilled one of
[33:55] these days you might be getting up and
[33:58] getting ready for work it might have
[33:59] been one of those morning's where you
[34:01] push the snooze button twice seem like
[34:04] you just didn't get the rest that you
[34:05] needed last night the chamomile tea
[34:07] didn't work for you but that's the
[34:10] morning that there was a host a caravan
[34:13] that's visiting us on that day I believe
[34:16] that's I believe that's as believers
[34:18] that we live in that kind of an
[34:20] expectation that's what the that's what
[34:23] the message that God has sent to us the
[34:25] angel of the Lord coming to us in this
[34:27] hour has brought to us a living
[34:30] expectation amen don't you love him this
[34:33] morning Amen how many just enjoyed the
[34:36] word of the Lord last night
[34:43] or the presence of the Lord is just so
[34:46] so precious so sweet I just love him

[35:08] of brother John Keith had taken place
[35:10] and brother Joe had to cancel there and
[35:13] at the end of May but you know what God
[35:14] knew God knew how everything has been so
[35:19] divinely arranged by him even to where
[35:22] of this weekend and how God is so set
[35:25] that I believe that with all my heart
[35:27] and I believe there's such a witness
[35:29] that the Holy Spirit has set right
[35:31] before us what a continuity that how
[35:33] that God has taken vessels and it's
[35:36] almost been like the same person has
[35:38] preached for weeks because in actuality
[35:42] the same person has been it's the

[35:52] of our needs aren't you I'm glad about
[35:54] that

[39:22] keep it simple I'm gonna read from two
[39:26] places in the scripture this this
[39:29] morning hungry from the book of Hebrews
[39:32] the tempter starting at verse 25 and
[39:36] 2228 never read at first John not st.
[39:40] John first John 1 verse 5 through 8
[39:49] Hebrews the temperature Kaptur and I'm
[39:53] gonna restart it
[39:54] verse 25 to 28 and here is like this not
[40:03] forsaken to somehow self together as a
[40:07] matter of some is but exhorting one
[40:11] another and so much the more as you see
[40:14] the Day approaching for it wishes if we
[40:18] sin willfully after we had received a
[40:21] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[40:23] no more sacrifice for sins but a certain
[40:27] fearful looking for the looking for of
[40:34] the judgment and fiery indignation which
[40:35] shall devour the amateur he that
[40:39] despises Moses law died without mercy
[40:42] under two or three witnesses first John
[40:52] first John first chapter
[40:55] Henry five through eight it says
[41:08] since then is the message which we have
[41:11] heard of him
[41:12] and declared unto you that God is light
[41:17] and in him is no darkness at all if we
[41:22] say that we have fellowship with him and
[41:24] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[41:29] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[41:34] is in the light we have fellowship one
[41:37] with another and the blood of Jesus
[41:41] Christ His Son cleanses us from all sins
[41:45] if we say that we have no sin saying we
[41:50] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[41:54] in us that's birth agressors father help
[41:59] me one more time to hear my body my
[42:05] spirit my soul to you Oh father help me
[42:09] to get myself out of the way Lord if the
[42:12] peoples can hear from you Lord father
[42:15] God I give you all my scrip for this
[42:16] service use my body for your glory in
[42:19] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen god
[42:24] bless you you may be seated thank the
[42:25] Lord for the reading of the word of God
[42:26] this morning hello to God is that hungry
[42:30] God is light and in him there is no
[42:33] darkness at all halli I like to wear
[42:36] this studying you saying you know that
[42:38] what we've seen endless long walk in the
[42:40] light as he is in the light Holly won't
[42:43] let her do drops of mercy and bright
[42:45] shine all around us by day and by night
[42:47] Jesus is the light of the world hundred
[42:50] I took this scripture this morning him
[42:53] and I begin to talk I want to tell him
[42:55] when to speak on a little subdued I kind
[42:57] of just started a few weeks ago hello
[43:00] when I deal with a subject no light no
[43:04] blood no light no blood how do you weigh
[43:09] another where we begin to realize you
[43:10] you say brother do what you're trying to
[43:12] say I'm trying to say if you ain't in
[43:14] the light there's no blood or coma for
[43:16] you holidays nothing
[43:18] they play because it takes light to
[43:20] bring life so that I begin to look here
[43:23] I begin to realize here and I'm gonna
[43:25] talk a little bit on that light right
[43:27] here because with God when God created
[43:29] it in God the Bible say the earth would
[43:33] that the Bible say the earth will win
[43:34] void and darkness was upon the face at a
[43:37] deeper Derb how do we do we realize how
[43:39] old is Satan why you think they're going
[43:41] to death saying it had been keep down to
[43:44] the earth under God because you realize
[43:47] you just don't just never come from God
[43:49] this God God just came from the devil
[43:51] hello in every garden made of Earth in
[43:54] the earth we would have born with void
[43:56] and for me is a way that was seizing her
[43:59] but none was grow be called darkness had
[44:02] paralyzed that seat honey but God had a
[44:05] purpose in his mind
[44:06] helooo Godhead he had a purpose in his
[44:09] mind so God says having me to break the
[44:11] powers of Satan
[44:13] how do Satan no doubt he thought he had
[44:15] this herb under his Dominion ship Holly
[44:17] but God said what these words let there
[44:21] be light honey the power dawned is no
[44:25] longer hold back because could hold it
[44:28] any longer when God said let there be
[44:30] light the power Gardner would broke
[44:33] under garden when he said let it be like
[44:36] Holland like Hitler the earth begin to
[44:39] give birth to ever see that was in your
[44:42] defeat redistricting up holida Barney
[44:46] like every day begin to come alive
[44:47] because is light and in him there's no
[44:50] darkness at all so God spoke words I
[44:53] learned that light hit that light hit
[44:56] the earth right there and there come a
[44:57] manifestation of the power God and I
[45:02] begin to realize you then God did we
[45:04] realize you that God took you here and
[45:06] he for man I didn't think God put man in
[45:10] his own image in God that man that God
[45:12] put in his image
[45:13] that man was a man Adam was a son of God
[45:16] and he also and it was the light that
[45:19] was in God with dwelling in Adam there
[45:21] was no sin at all in her I don't walk in
[45:25] the light
[45:27] and they Adam was woken in delay he was
[45:29] a son of God he walked in the life there
[45:32] was no power talking to him at all
[45:34] I begin to think of new things when I
[45:37] was looking at this here I'd say oh god
[45:39] I said it was such a perfect fellowship
[45:41] with God
[45:43] hallelu how did the father lights come
[45:45] down and gave birth to a son of light
[45:47] how do you know her here go out of here
[45:50] you know what he saying that word that
[45:51] was no saying that was not there was no
[45:53] worries that was no signals now it on
[45:55] Sarah Holly he was just a son of the
[45:57] life how did that dwelleth God breathing
[46:00] out and light holiday the word did not
[46:03] begin to look here but we realize here
[46:05] and I went that night so Satan only he
[46:07] could do Holly we could not Satan is not
[46:10] a creator he is a perversion ally he got
[46:14] at him and every member that was no way
[46:18] for Satan to get there no way Shana had
[46:24] no power over anywhere it was it was
[46:29] impossible because God had divided the
[46:32] light from the darkness
[46:34] [Music]
[46:35] so daughters had no power and only way
[46:40] to Satan you get to Adam he could not

[1:14:17] at that light that was in here but Jesus
[1:14:19] began to testify I am the light Holly in
[1:14:21] me there's no darkness at all that what
[1:14:23] Jesus couldn't go to a further service
[1:14:27] Tina couldn't even go to a further
[1:14:29] service be going every time he walked in
[1:14:31] front and down
[1:14:32] that light would bring it back to life I
[1:14:36] lose that power that was in him but done
[1:14:39] that earth that laying there dead he

[1:15:03] to come and see where and already Jesus
[1:15:05] kept going like he didn't pay no
[1:15:07] attention you know he didn't he he just
[1:15:10] like he didn't know what to say
[1:15:12] lives down today and after about four
[1:15:15] days he showed up he had a reason for
[1:15:17] doing it just because the Jews at that
[1:15:20] time they believed that the spirit hung
[1:15:21] around the body for three days if Gina
[1:15:24] would have read Andrade lines it up in
[1:15:25] the third day they would say well his
[1:15:27] career was to run so they whent held to
[1:15:29] their tradition but he waited he broke
[1:15:31] their tradition and he showed up on the
[1:15:33] fourth day just measured this method is
[1:15:37] not based on tradition and based on
[1:15:39] Revelation not as man is going to the
[1:15:47] tune Eliza's his flesh beginning to get
[1:15:50] like any man started weeping
[1:15:58] but don't tell you what he did he will

[1:16:11] Jesus lay here raised she said we know
[1:16:14] here raised in the general resurrection
[1:16:17] Jesus looked at us are you this brother

[1:16:24] the resurrection and the life
[1:16:26] show me what you later may know what
[1:16:30] gift of the power darkness had took him

[1:16:55] call my sheep my name because if he
[1:16:57] wouldn't have called in my name it would
[1:16:59] have been a general resurrection and he
