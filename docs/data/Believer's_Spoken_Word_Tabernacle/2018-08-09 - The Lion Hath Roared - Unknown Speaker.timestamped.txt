[31:22] certainly don't know how much longer but
[31:24] one thing that we do want to have our
[31:25] heart so set on is that every moment
[31:28] that God gives us we want to be found
[31:31] ready and making ourselves ready amen
[31:34] that's the greatest thing that we can do
[31:35] and you know making ourselves ready is
[31:38] not something that is just of our own
[31:40] strength but it's our will being yielded
[31:42] to God's will
[31:43] amen being clothed in the final inning
[31:46] of his righteousness and his will our
[31:49] will being surrendered that's the great
[31:50] you know that's the greatest victory and
[31:52] that victory it takes it's one victory
[31:55] that takes place on the inside and then
[31:57] you have power and strength then to be
[32:00] able to bring and surrender your will
[32:02] constantly how many know what I'm
[32:04] talking about before so many things so
[32:07] many situations you're facing dealing
[32:09] with things that you're even thinking
[32:10] about but once it just something just
[32:12] kind of drops in your heart and you
[32:13] recognize wait a minute
[32:15] it's me that needs to get out of the way
[32:17] as soon as I get out of and that's the
[32:18] victory right there the victory is
[32:20] already what takes place after that is a
[32:23] manifestation of a victory that's
[32:25] already happened within I'll tell it's
[32:27] the greatest thing the greatest victory
[32:28] is over ourselves it's the greatest
[32:31] victory amen we're just so happy to be
[32:34] here tonight him so glad for that

[32:53] time and they're going to in
[32:55] Pennsylvania this weekend we've got
[32:57] meetings brother Darrell and I know he's

[33:40] bunch of nuts he said but you know the
[33:41] only thing we know to do is just come
[33:43] and surrender ourselves he said because
[33:45] it's hard to tell what God will do I

[33:49] greatest thing you know brother Brent
[33:51] told us there's three things and who is
[33:52] this Melchizedek he said when you come

[38:29] Jackie and bless his heart he's getting
[38:32] feeble now and it just just breaks your
[38:34] heart to see him but he wanted to sing
[38:37] greetings to the church and and tell
[38:40] y'all hello and we praying for the
[38:42] services I'm going to tell you that he
[38:45] loves you a man sure love brother Jack
[38:48] yeah I tell you me me two year ago I my
[38:52] back went out on me
[38:54] anybody's ever had back trouble you know
[38:56] I I crawled on my hands and knees for
[38:57] six days I believe it was you know it's
[39:01] it's so funny how your house looks from
[39:04] that position you know my those legs
[39:08] need to be wiped off on that chair but
[39:12] anyway I had kind of got over it a
[39:13] little bit and still wasn't completely
[39:15] over there nah I had a meeting down in
[39:17] Alabama and brother Jackie course he's
[39:20] evangelist himself you know and but he
[39:22] he didn't go out that weekend but he put
[39:24] me in his car and drove me to Alabama
[39:26] and helped me get down there to help me
[39:28] get back and I just always appreciate it
[39:30] brother Jackie for that because you know
[39:32] he could have been out preaching himself
[39:33] that weekend but he gave up that weekend
[39:35] to help me get out and get back in and
[39:37] so that's just the kind of man that
[39:38] brother Jackie is and spent some time
[39:41] with him down in the Philippines he's a
[39:42] real prayer warrior I say he certainly
[39:44] knows how to get a hold of God when he
[39:46] prays and so we just really love
[39:47] appreciate brother Jackie and a man and
[39:50] just counted one of the great heroes of
[39:52] faith if you have your Bibles tonight
[39:54] turn with us to the Book of Amos we want
[39:56] to read from Amos chapter 3 verse 7 and
[39:59] verse 8 I just finished up a little
[40:02] series down home on the Satan's devices
[40:06] and some of the things that Satan the
[40:08] uses in last night we preached on that
[40:10] how that Satan will mimic a roar in line
[40:13] he's certainly not a roar in line but
[40:15] he'll try to act like a roaring lion so
[40:17] that's not we was looking at how Satan
[40:19] will try to impersonate a roar in line
[40:20] and how to stop his attack but tonight
[40:23] with the help of the Lord I want to look
[40:24] at the real roaring life hey man amen I
[40:31] want to look at this Loren line tonight
[40:32] and so we want to read now from Amos 3:7
[40:35] and while you're turning there listen to
[40:37] these quotes and it's kind of where we
[40:38] got the thought for this message this is
[40:40] the way of the true prophet in sixty-two
[40:42] brother Branham says this he says
[40:43] old-line of the tribe of Judah rise up
[40:48] and roar for thou art roaring in this
[40:52] last day Oh God
[40:54] let your prophet roar Lord roar out your
[40:58] message God and let every creature of
[41:01] your kingdom
[41:02] take heed amen
[41:05] he also says this says I like to take
[41:10] for a text of here he him after all he's
[41:14] the voice of authority God himself
[41:17] witness so at this time hear ye him
[41:22] there are many voices in the world today
[41:24] there are many things going on many
[41:27] doctrines and many isms but here ye him
[41:31] he's the voice of final authority he's
[41:34] the one that'll speak he's the one that
[41:36] said the heavens and earth shall pass
[41:38] away but my words shall never fail so
[41:41] hear ye him he's the one to listen to
[41:48] and now Amos 3:7 and he the Bible says

[43:34] contrary to your voice and may we only
[43:38] hear what you speak to the church the
[43:42] Lord we realize the first church age
[43:44] made a mistake but they did not listen
[43:47] to the spirit but they listened to man
[43:50] but you said Lord in the last days that
[43:53] will be another group rise up and they
[43:57] will listen to the spirit that speaks to
[43:59] the church and with the pure word they
[44:03] will return to the power of Pentecost to
[44:06] welcome back the Lord father we believe
[44:10] that we are a people tonight who are
[44:12] under the umbrella of the Pentecostal
[44:14] blessing Lord the things you said would
[44:18] be in your church we believe we are
[44:20] those people tonight father made a lion
[44:23] roar forth and may we hear what's being
[44:26] spoken Lord and the author may we be as
[44:28] James said not just hearers of the word
[44:31] but may we be doers of that which we
[44:34] hear Lord blessed brother Samuel father
[44:36] bless the officers of the church bless
[44:38] this church in a mighty way let it be a
[44:41] light Lord in the midst of darkness here
[44:43] in this area Lord make great signs and
[44:46] wonders be wrong at the hands other
[44:48] believers have made this community know
[44:50] that thou art the same yesterday today
[44:52] and forever because they see you
[44:55] manifested through your people Lord heal
[44:58] our sick tonight encourage the
[44:59] discouraged father that when we leave
[45:01] the building may we say dinner on our
[45:03] hearts burn within us because the lion
[45:06] has roared in the midst of the
[45:08] congregation tonight granted Lord God
[45:10] for we ask these things in Jesus name
[45:13] and the bride says
[45:15] you may be seated tonight it never fails
[45:24] my coat back there there's a hanger
[45:26] always on the pulpit so I thought I'd
[45:29] look first Amen may the Lord bless you
[45:32] tonight who's gonna help me preach good
[45:34] good
[45:35] amen now the lion roared now - roar -
[45:40] roar the word roar there are
[45:42] interchangeable words that you can use
[45:46] for the word roar and yet project the
[45:50] same thought that you can take the words
[45:53] and exchange these words with one
[45:55] another and not change the meaning of
[45:57] the context of the subject that you're
[46:00] bringing forth so you can sync the word
[46:02] roar or you can take the word blast the
[46:05] word roar and the word blast has the
[46:07] same meaning and blast is the same word
[46:11] as voice and voice is the same as roar
[46:17] and roar is the same as report or
[46:20] roaring is the same as roar or even
[46:24] noise is the same interchangeable word
[46:27] as roar so when Isaiah said who hath
[46:32] believed our report you can actually say
[46:35] who has believed the roar and to whom is
[46:39] the arm of the Lord revealed you can
[46:42] actually say who have believed the roar
[46:44] and not change the meaning of the word
[46:47] only brother granted was on sunset
[46:49] mountain he said he heard a blast but
[46:53] you can actually say that he heard a
[46:55] roar and not changed the meaning of the
[46:58] context of the subject that he's
[47:00] bringing forth let me show you what I
[47:02] mean in size'
[47:03] it's a is this the sign of the end time
[47:05] served said as soon as they left the
[47:07] constellation of larger birds came and
[47:09] they looked like doves sharp pointed
[47:11] wings kind of great color little lighter
[47:13] color than what these first little
[47:14] messengers were and they were coming
[47:16] eastward swiftly and no sooner than they
[47:19] got out of my side he had turned again
[47:20] to look westward and there it happened
[47:22] there was a blast that actually shook
[47:26] the whole earth now don't miss the
[47:29] then you won't take me sure you get this
[47:31] right first the blast and I thought it
[47:33] sounded like a sound barrier whatever
[47:36] you would call it when prey when planes
[47:38] cross the sound the sound comes back to
[47:40] the earth it just shook like roared
[47:43] everything it just shook like like
[47:49] roared everything I never heard such a
[47:52] terrific blast just shook the rocks row
[47:55] down I thought I must have jumped 5 foot
[47:57] off the ground it just scared me and all
[47:59] at once something said look up with the
[48:05] roar came the voice to look up and there
[48:09] it was and then he told me it's the
[48:12] opening of the seven seals turned home
[48:20] saints of God tonight the seven seals
[48:23] have been opened you see we're not
[48:29] building the wall brother Samuel we're
[48:31] building a building and there comes
[48:33] times when you build a building you come
[48:36] to a corner and when you come to the
[48:38] corner you make that turn if you start
[48:43] here you go there go there go there but
[48:45] when you make that turn you're heading
[48:47] back to where you come from as the
[48:50] opening of the seals where is it turning
[48:52] it's turning our hearts towards home the
[49:01] lion has roared who will not fear the
[49:04] Lord God has spoken
[49:05] who can but prophesy no prophecies the
[49:10] foretelling or prediction of what is to
[49:12] come a divinely inspired utterance or
[49:18] revelation amen
[49:22] now in the animal kingdom there are four
[49:25] main big cats The Lion the Tyger the
[49:30] leopard and the Jaguar now each of these
[49:33] four big cats they have especially
[49:35] adapted larix which enables them to roar
[49:40] your kitty cat is a cat but it don't
[49:43] roar it purrs amen but these cats are
[49:49] built in such a way that their learnings
[49:52] is especially built that gives them the
[49:54] ability to roar but the thing about the
[49:58] lion even over the leopard and the
[50:00] Jaguar is the lion his Lenox is longer
[50:03] he's got the longest Irish in other
[50:06] words she's a special built cat which
[50:12] means he can produce by far the loudest
[50:15] roar the roar of a sudden the reason Oh
[50:21] feeling good
[50:23] he'll is the line able to roar like that
[50:26] me because his larynx is made in a
[50:28] special way he's built by his creator to
[50:32] have the ability to roar other big cats
[50:35] can roar but not like the lion it
[50:39] reminds me what the Prophet said there's
[50:41] been churches churches Brides Brides
[50:43] churches Brides but there's got to come
[50:46] a real bride have this cries hallelujah
[50:50] her blue blaze our spirit given it's a
[50:53] special build through the people and
[50:57] this people has the voice they have the
[51:00] ability to speak a little a man he's
[51:08] built by the Creator to have this
[51:10] ability to roar other cats can roar but
[51:14] none like the lion
[51:16] amen amen
[51:20] hallelujah now once the Prophet said
[51:23] this there's a special built church how
[51:27] did he bring Christ here
[51:29] by the word of the prophets is that
[51:32] right and how will he bring his bride
[51:35] here by the words of the prophets amen
[51:43] how did he have indicate Christ is
[51:45] coming how did he have indicate that
[51:49] Christ was on the earth by a man with
[51:52] the spirit of Elijah about him
[51:55] how will he have indicate his bride on
[51:58] the earth there'll be a forerunner with
[52:01] the spirit of Elijah upon him but same
[52:04] word speaks for the group speaks also
[52:07] for the bride
[52:08] she's bone of his bone flesh of his
[52:10] flesh spirit of experience blood of his
[52:12] blood life of his life she is him
[52:14] expressed on the earth and as he was the
[52:18] fulfillment of the prophetic words of a
[52:20] prophet the bride is a prophetic
[52:22] fulfillment hallelujah of the words of
[52:25] the prophets so she is a spoken word
[52:28] bride the bride's actions her character
[52:37] everything about this bride will be the
[52:39] result of prophetic utterance a spoken
[52:43] word bride why because Christ is a
[52:46] spoken word groom Amen hallelujah do you
[52:53] love him
[52:55] Amen he promised in the last days he
[52:59] would send Elijah before he destroyed
[53:01] the earth like it was in the days of
[53:03] Sodom he promised it that he would turn
[53:05] the hearts of the children back to the
[53:07] faith of the fathers now like the
[53:09] lioness of the lion has built the roar
[53:11] the bride is built by the word to not
[53:14] only receive the word but she's built to
[53:16] speak that word hallelujah a spoken word
[53:22] bride now how loud is a lion's roar a
[53:26] normal human shout is around 70 decimals
[53:31] anything about 120 decimals it becomes
[53:34] physically painful to the human ear so
[53:38] if you're 80 somewhere around somewhere
[53:40] 70 is about a somebody yelling at
[53:42] all gave 70 decimals anything higher
[53:45] than that when he gets around 120 it
[53:47] becomes physically painful to your ears
[53:50] but a lion his roar is from around a
[53:54] hundred and ten to a hundred and
[53:56] fourteen decimals oh gosh that's twice
[54:01] as loud as a human voice the roar of the
[54:05] lion can travel five miles my god that's
[54:11] almost back to the hotel room
[54:18] five miles now why does the landlord to
[54:24] establish their territory to scare away
[54:27] rivals they're also thought to roar to
[54:32] communicate so the roar of the line is
[54:35] the communication to the private you
[54:41] know while I know crew like a crew cuz
[54:44] he ain't trying to talk to a crew he's
[54:45] trying to talk to another lion and Jesus
[54:49] said my sheep hear my voice it's a form
[54:54] of communication the cheetah don't
[54:56] understand it the bear don't understand
[54:58] it the squirrel don't understand it but
[55:01] the pride understands the roar of the
[55:03] lion
[55:04] [Music]
[55:08] booyah the roar is a form of
[55:11] communication a pride of lions could
[55:15] have a huge territory up to a hundred
[55:17] and sixty square miles so the roaring of
[55:20] the line helps maintain the territory
[55:23] without having to cover the whole
[55:26] distance
[55:27] in other words you don't have to be
[55:29] everywhere and at all times he can just
[55:32] run he could just sit down a roar and
[55:36] let's still know he's around it reminds
[55:41] me what the Bible says in Psalms 107
[55:43] he said his word he sent His Word and
[55:47] healed them and delivered them from
[55:50] their destructions how can two walk
[55:56] together except they agree the Bible
[56:01] says this will align roar in the forest
[56:04] when he's taken no prey will a young
[56:07] line cry out of his death if he's taking
[56:10] nothing what's the Bible saying there's
[56:13] simply this a line don't roar just to be
[56:15] roaring and God don't speak just to be
[56:19] speaking a lion only roars when he's
[56:23] trying to accomplish something or
[56:25] something's getting ready to happen Oh
[56:29] God
[56:31] the brother said when he roars in these
[56:33] last days
[56:34] let's take heed and know something's
[56:37] fixin to happen know that God never does
[56:39] anything that was that first he roars it
[56:42] forth
[56:43] [Music]
[56:43] [Applause]
[56:46] hallelujah when he roars for something
[56:50] did something follows that roar when God
[56:53] gives on the roar something's coming for
[56:56] tanky pay attention amen when the word
[57:02] has been spoken for a certain generation
[57:04] there's going to be somebody on the
[57:05] scene that will fulfill that word
[57:07] because God spoke it
[57:09] it's a vindication of the spoken word
[57:13] amen
[57:15] that's the harmony between Jesus and the
[57:17] father he never did anything till he's
[57:18] seen the father do it first or the
[57:20] father that was the harmony between God
[57:22] and Christ
[57:23] so will the bride he shows her his word
[57:26] of life he shows her and she receives it
[57:29] and never doubts it had nothing can harm
[57:32] her not even death forth the seed be
[57:37] planted the water will raise it up
[57:40] here's the secret the word is in the
[57:43] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[57:45] what he wants done with the word and she
[57:48] does it in his name she does it in his
[57:51] name while there is power in the name of
[57:54] Jesus she has thus sayeth the Lord
[57:58] then it's journalize so the Holy Spirit
[58:01] waters it until it's grown and serves
[58:04] its purpose Hey amen they do only his
[58:10] will
[58:11] no one can persuade them differently
[58:13] they have dust saith the Lord or they
[58:15] keep still
[58:16] how does she have dust saith the Lord
[58:18] for the Lord has already spoken and she
[58:21] says what did he say she's saying under
[58:23] that prophet messenger saying what the
[58:26] Spirit says spoken word it's not just
[58:35] that well what am I going to speak into
[58:36] existence today it's not that but it's
[58:38] when he speaks and you say what he says
[58:41] like when the Prophet was something and
[58:43] God said what are you hunting he said
[58:45] squirrel God said how many you need he
[58:49] said the Linnet
[58:50] God said speak it
[58:54] I was telling at home the other day down
[58:59] in down in Mexico then a few ago a man
[59:01] was telling me this story he come over
[59:03] to Colorado to plant some trees on a
[59:05] green card to come over here to work in
[59:07] the country and so he Dave gonna fair
[59:09] they had sprayed this this weed killer
[59:11] stuff to kill all the undergrowth and
[59:12] they were planting these seedlings to to
[59:14] build back this area that they had
[59:15] lumbered and so they hired these
[59:17] Mexicans to come in and they had to
[59:18] plant a hundred tree saplings a day that
[59:20] was their job any of you forgot to fill
[59:22] up his canteen that day and while he was
[59:24] working he got thirsty run out of water
[59:26] and there was a creek running through
[59:27] there and he drank the water out of the
[59:29] creek but it wasn't long after he done
[59:32] that that he realized he poisoned
[59:34] himself because the spray that had
[59:36] sprayed the kill had gotten into the
[59:37] water and he had drank that weed killer
[59:39] into his body and he told me said
[59:42] brother I know I was dying I knew that I
[59:45] was dying said I had a buddy with me and
[59:46] he said I'll stay here so I can tell
[59:48] your family what happened to you he said
[59:51] I was sitting there on a I believe he
[59:52] said a stump where they kind of treat us
[59:54] he said I was sitting there and I could
[59:55] feel my life leaving my body
[59:58] he said all at once something spoke
[1:00:01] inside me and said I need a lemon and
[1:00:05] when that spoke he said I said what that
[1:00:08] said I said I'd need a lemon and he said
[1:00:14] brother Daryl God is my witness I looked
[1:00:16] beside the stump was a lemon
[1:00:22] he said I hate it I hate everything I
[1:00:25] believe I would - he said I hate the
[1:00:27] Rhine I hate to see I hate the whole
[1:00:29] inning he said after a while I felt my
[1:00:33] strength coming back and just a little
[1:00:34] bit I was able to go back to work and
[1:00:36] when I got up to leave he said my buddy
[1:00:38] been sitting down the whole time he said
[1:00:40] where did that lemon come from he said
[1:00:45] brother Daryl where did that lemon come
[1:00:48] from I said he Charlotte Jarrah God will
[1:00:51] provide himself a lamb they have dust
[1:01:02] settle hoarder they'll keep still they
[1:01:04] will do the works of God for it is
[1:01:06] himself in them continuing his word to
[1:01:09] fulfill it as he did not complete in his
[1:01:11] days all face when he was here he did
[1:01:13] not complete all when he was here for it
[1:01:15] was not yet time but now it is time for
[1:01:18] the fulfillment of the Ministry of Jesus
[1:01:20] Christ where will he complete that
[1:01:22] ministry and use the pride does the
[1:01:26] pride of the ministry yes sir it'll be a
[1:01:29] great ministry amen
[1:01:35] Isaiah said I said 55 my thoughts are
[1:01:38] not your thoughts neither are my ways
[1:01:41] your ways saith the Lord God said I
[1:01:44] don't think like you think my thoughts
[1:01:48] are not your thoughts neither are my way
[1:01:51] through ways so God's thoughts and my
[1:01:56] thoughts are not the same thoughts
[1:01:57] unless I was the casting on my thoughts
[1:02:04] and think his thoughts then if I thought
[1:02:08] only his thoughts then his thoughts in
[1:02:11] my thoughts would be the same thoughts
[1:02:16] well you did some of you didn't eat man
[1:02:18] there but if I can show you in the Bible
[1:02:21] we a minute now don't lie you're in
[1:02:24] church do that not nice if I can show
[1:02:31] you by the Bible that a son of God can
[1:02:33] get the mind of God and speak God's mind
[1:02:36] okay here goes who created the animals
[1:02:40] it's not a trick question remember
[1:02:44] Sunday School God created the animals
[1:02:47] but who named them out of this how did
[1:02:52] Adam know what to name the animals Adam
[1:02:58] said you're a monkey you're a bear
[1:02:59] you're a cheetah you're alive and God
[1:03:01] said that's exactly what I was thinking
[1:03:06] hallelujah Adam had the mind of God and
[1:03:10] when we get the mind of God concerning
[1:03:12] this our lives will be restored the
[1:03:15] third pole will manifest among us and
[1:03:17] our bodies will be changed because
[1:03:19] that's Gloria
[1:03:22] that's God's taken for this hour is that
[1:03:24] our bodies will be changed this ain't
[1:03:29] lose the stain
[1:03:30] this ain't Westley's day this is broad
[1:03:32] day this is rapture our whoo when you
[1:03:45] speak God's words you are speaking God's
[1:03:48] thoughts concerning healing concerning
[1:03:52] salvation concerning prophecy concerning
[1:03:56] you amen hallelujah
[1:04:04] let's God thoughts and he expresses it
[1:04:07] it becomes his word and when a son of
[1:04:11] God by faith takes the Word of God into
[1:04:13] his heart and speaks it back upon his
[1:04:15] lips it's just the same as deity
[1:04:18] speaking
[1:04:21] because the Sun is not speaking his
[1:04:23] thoughts he's speaking the father's
[1:04:25] tongues hey man you see it's got to the
[1:04:34] place you can't listening to nobody
[1:04:36] anymore CNN says Fox is fake Fox says
[1:04:44] CNN say everything you turn on it's fake
[1:04:48] news and a fact checking everything even
[1:04:52] while the man's talking they've got
[1:04:53] somebody back there looking it's got to
[1:04:58] the place people don't know what to
[1:04:59] believe when they hear the news they
[1:05:04] don't know if Trump colluded or not it
[1:05:06] depends on who you're listening to when
[1:05:09] I was a boy it wasn't that way when you
[1:05:11] heard the evening news you heard the
[1:05:12] evening news but we're living in an hour
[1:05:16] that people spend things and twist
[1:05:19] things and work things around that you
[1:05:21] don't even know what to believe the
[1:05:25] brothers said it's got to the place you
[1:05:26] can listen to nobody so there's only one
[1:05:29] voice that I know that sure there's only
[1:05:31] one thoughts I know that's food and
[1:05:33] that's what God said for conscience and
[1:05:36] every man's worth me a lot and let my
[1:05:38] word be true so I'd rather take what God
[1:05:40] said over what anybody else said a man
[1:05:49] he said let every man's word be a lie

[1:07:35] Jersey in a Jewish home went through all

[1:07:59] in a Jewish family but one day somebody
[1:08:01] come to the door with an open book and
[1:08:05] in that book was his name and it showed
[1:08:08] him he was not a Jew he was actually a
[1:08:11] Sioux Indian from ulta Rosebud Indian
[1:08:13] Reservation who had been adopted by a
[1:08:16] Jewish family and when this man found
[1:08:18] out his truth his true roots when he
[1:08:20] found out what his real DNA was he went
[1:08:23] back to what he was

[1:08:27] Indian
[1:08:28] well we thought we was a drunk we
[1:08:31] thought we was a Baptist but one day the

[1:09:05] leave it at that right there
[1:09:10] you talk about a Heinz 57 I'm one of
[1:09:13] them but I found a quote the other day
[1:09:23] they said God was my father
[1:09:24] then I found a quote the other day that
[1:09:26] said we was born by the breath of God
[1:09:28] and the Prophet said God is my mother so
[1:09:32] God is my father Donna's mother they
[1:09:34] lead by standard DNA tests knows you get
[1:09:36] 50 percent from your daddy and fifty
[1:09:38] percent from your mama so if I got 50
[1:09:40] percent from my mama spiritually and 50
[1:09:42] percent from my daddy spirit what does
[1:09:44] that make me an attribute of God 100
[1:09:53] percent

[1:10:06] God has gave us his thoughts all I gotta
[1:10:09] hurry God has gave us his thoughts
[1:10:10] concerning us then don't hear nothing
[1:10:13] else but him listen to no other voice
[1:10:18] not even your own if it's negative hear
[1:10:29] ye you he's the voice of authority amen
[1:10:36] hallelujah
[1:10:38] there's many voices in the world they
[1:10:40] many things going on many doctrines many
[1:10:41] isms but hear ye him he's the voice of
[1:10:46] final authority he's the one that'll
[1:10:49] speak he's the one that said heavens and
[1:10:51] earth shall pass away but my words shall
[1:10:53] never fail so hear ye
[1:10:56] the lion has roared when a lion roars
[1:11:01] the prophet said he said I've hunted in
[1:11:03] the jungles when a lion roars everything
[1:11:06] shuts up the monkeys the Cheetahs the
[1:11:12] hyenas even the beetles
[1:11:14] shut up said even the beetles will keep
[1:11:19] still it's a deadly hush why the King
[1:11:22] has spoken
[1:11:26] with the lion roars everything is scared
[1:11:30] pups never heard one in the jungle it'll
[1:11:33] scare you to death you'll never die from
[1:11:35] the Lions back his roar was scared you
[1:11:37] to death before he gets to you the belt
[1:11:43] comes out of his lungs he throws that
[1:11:45] head back it's like a cannon going off
[1:11:48] the big roar in his lungs who couldn't
[1:11:51] be scared the Bible says if a lion roars
[1:11:56] who will not fear all the suit says all
[1:11:58] the false prophets they run for cover
[1:12:00] when the lion roars every other voice is
[1:12:03] silenced when God speaks who can keep
[1:12:06] from prophesied what's God has spoken it
[1:12:12] then we can say what God said in
[1:12:14] prophecy for example God has spoken this
[1:12:18] day and said thus saith the Lord
[1:12:21] California will be beneath the sea and
[1:12:25] tonight I can stand here and tell you
[1:12:27] thus saith the Lord California will be
[1:12:31] beneath the sea how can you say that
[1:12:33] because God's already said it I'm only
[1:12:36] telling you what he said the lion has
[1:12:39] roared who can be professor saying
[1:12:45] what's already been said when the angel
[1:12:48] come to Mary what did he tell us our
[1:12:50] highly favored of God you're not I shall
[1:12:54] conceive and bring forth the child shows
[1:12:56] name something called Jesus and Mary
[1:12:59] said how shall this be seeing I know not
[1:13:02] a man and the angel answered and said
[1:13:04] unto her Holy Ghost shall open shall
[1:13:06] come upon thee and the power of the
[1:13:07] highest shall overshadow thee therefore
[1:13:09] also that holy thing which shall be born
[1:13:11] in thee shall be called the Son of God
[1:13:13] and behold that cousin Elizabeth has
[1:13:15] also conceived a son in her old age and
[1:13:17] this is a six month with her who was
[1:13:19] called barren for with God nothing shall
[1:13:23] be impossible
[1:13:26] and then Mary says this behold the
[1:13:30] handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[1:13:33] according to the word and the age of the
[1:13:39] parted from her why did the angel leave
[1:13:41] because Mary received his message a man
[1:13:52] be done to me according to thy word the
[1:13:57] word that word means that which has been
[1:14:01] others by a living voice not a written
[1:14:05] word not a recorded word but a living
[1:14:09] word according to thy word Mary saying
[1:14:13] by the breath that's come from your body
[1:14:16] that has formed these words I will
[1:14:18] receive the living words God says so
[1:14:25] that settles that no question it God
[1:14:27] said so that makes it right that's the
[1:14:29] final voice of authority he is all
[1:14:32] authority God has supreme authority and
[1:14:38] Mary goes and sees Elizabeth as soon as
[1:14:40] she begins to speak what the angel has
[1:14:42] said Mary which Elizabeth had said I'm
[1:14:45] with child also and she told her what
[1:14:48] the angel said and as soon as she spoke
[1:14:51] those prophetic words the baby leaped in
[1:14:53] Elizabeth Elizabeth said to Luke 144 for
[1:15:02] lo as soon as the voice of the
[1:15:04] salutation sounded in my ears the baby
[1:15:07] leaped in my womb for joy why Mary was
[1:15:11] rehearsing what the angel had said
[1:15:18] listen to this Jim that's laying in the
[1:15:20] scriptures here verse 45 Elizabeth says
[1:15:24] this and blessed is she that believeth
[1:15:27] for there shall be a performance of
[1:15:29] those things which were told her from
[1:15:32] the Lord
[1:15:36] there shall be a performance of those
[1:15:39] things which were spoken the light has
[1:15:43] roared who will not fear the Lord God
[1:15:46] has spoken who came but prophesy she
[1:15:49] began to proclaim the angel what the
[1:15:52] angel had said about her and when she
[1:15:54] begins to proclaim what the angel said
[1:15:56] about her she began to manifest what the
[1:15:59] angel says she was manifesting it more
[1:16:04] and more and more what was he doing the
[1:16:09] very words that she had received had
[1:16:12] become manifested in her she was
[1:16:14] actually manifesting the angels message
[1:16:18] what was she doing not proclaiming her
[1:16:20] own words she was saying what the angel
[1:16:23] said why Mary are you with child I
[1:16:25] didn't know you Joseph I didn't know you
[1:16:27] women when was the wedding oh I'm not
[1:16:29] married to Joseph yet were just as

[1:17:54] the children to this mountain as far as
[1:17:56] God was concerned the children was
[1:17:58] already on the mountain because he'd
[1:17:59] spoken so anything that stood in Moses
[1:18:01] way he had the commission by God to
[1:18:03] speak it out of the way and when they
[1:18:05] got out there to the Red Sea you know
[1:18:07] the story he'd begin to cry and God
[1:18:08] spoke to Moses said Moses why cry to me

[1:18:25] election what he said about overcoming
[1:18:27] what he said about the third pole it's
[1:18:29] time we take that word into us and begin
[1:18:31] to speak it back up on a limb that it
[1:18:33] may bring forth the manifestation who a

[1:18:45] brother Branham was that Malachi 4
[1:18:47] messenger because we will become the
[1:18:49] words he spoke and will manifest that
[1:18:51] word upon the earth the devil walks
[1:19:03] around we preach last night like a
[1:19:05] roaring lion acting like a lion but he's
[1:19:08] not a you know what his Rory is it's
[1:19:10] nothing but a bunch of noise I was in
[1:19:15] the army 18th airborne up at Fort Bragg
[1:19:18] North Carolina I fired a 155 out sir in
[1:19:21] those days I was young and I was silly I
[1:19:22] thought was invisible were they that's
[1:19:24] the way they taught us they taught us we
[1:19:25] is invincible
[1:19:26] so I never wore ear protection and I
[1:19:28] fired those big houses round after round
[1:19:30] after round we testified the one-niner
[1:19:32] eggs when they come out with those new
[1:19:33] guns we fired round after round after
[1:19:35] round and now today I have a condition
[1:19:38] called tinnitus perhaps some of you have
[1:19:40] it it's a ringing in your ear
[1:19:42] getting your ears ring my ears ring all
[1:19:44] the time I've answered phones I don't
[1:19:46] know how many times that really wasn't
[1:19:47] ring is because it was the ringing in my
[1:19:49] ear at night in the hotel room in about
[1:19:51] drives me crazy driving down the road
[1:19:53] and about driving me crazy
[1:19:55] and that's the way the devil is you know
[1:19:56] what it is it's just the noise in my ear
[1:19:58] and that's the way the devil is he's
[1:20:01] just the noise in your ear when it comes
[1:20:03] to trying to tell you take the Word of
[1:20:05] God and cut into pieces
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:11] brother the real line that's roared in
[1:20:14] this hour and when the real eye roars
[1:20:16] everything else shuts up it's time to

[1:20:20] nothing but a bluff you have no power
[1:20:22] over me I am a son of God I am a
[1:20:25] daughter of God the lion has roared and
[1:20:28] has told me my inheritance he's told us
[1:20:35] his thoughts concerning us taking the
[1:20:39] Word of God and defeat Mary to me you
[1:20:42] know brother deaf Smith sent me a little
[1:20:43] story here not long ago really blessed
[1:20:45] my heart I like to preach him share and
[1:20:47] he found this I think it was Luther that
[1:20:48] had preached on it and he sent it to me
[1:20:50] and the story goes that this I believe
[1:20:53] in his Lucifer that was preaching he's
[1:20:54] talking my sham guard and he said one of
[1:20:56] sham guards never coming over here said
[1:20:58] Sam Garth there are 600 Philistines

[1:21:03] worry we're leaving right now we're
[1:21:05] gonna rally all the farmers we'll come
[1:21:07] back we'll help you whooping and Luther

[1:21:13] neighbor just pass on don't worry about
[1:21:16] it
[1:21:17] they're 400 short because the Bible says
[1:21:22] one will put a thousand of the flies and
[1:21:24] there's only 600 of them so there's 400
[1:21:26] of them sort I'll take care of it myself
[1:21:28] that's the kind of attitude we need to
[1:21:30] have that's the kind of faith we need to
[1:21:32] have that's the way we need to stand up
[1:21:34] on the Word of God we need to take that
[1:21:36] promise and make it mine it needs to be
[1:21:38] a personal revelation to you
[1:21:39] God has gave me this revelation that I
[1:21:42] could put a thousand to flight
[1:21:47] speak to them health to speak for the
[1:21:49] store speak to the fear just speak

[1:23:16] we can't accept it by faith for God hath
[1:23:20] spoken it
[1:23:22] the lion has roared let everything else
[1:23:26] shut up simply say what the father has
[1:23:31] said my daughter Jessica said Mike I
[1:23:35] will disclose I I got a bunch more but
[1:23:37] it's getting late I know the kids go
[1:23:38] school all that my daughter Jessica's
[1:23:42] sitting back there she's one who was in
[1:23:43] the accident struck by the train
[1:23:45] left her in a wheelchair had to feed her
[1:23:48] through her stomach told us she'd never
[1:23:50] talk again never see again never walk
[1:23:52] again never eat again if she even live
[1:23:54] they said she'd be nothing but a
[1:23:55] vegetable
[1:23:58] but I was sitting in the waiting area
[1:24:00] and I heard all the things I worked with
[1:24:03] the doctors my wife's a registered nurse
[1:24:04] worked in surgeon for years I was a
[1:24:06] surgical technician worked in surgeon
[1:24:07] for years did assistant doctors did all
[1:24:09] kinds of operations I didn't do the
[1:24:11] operation but I helped do the operation
[1:24:17] so I worked with these doctors and so
[1:24:20] they they told me with friends so they
[1:24:23] told me what they was looking at that of
[1:24:24] course you know working in surgery and
[1:24:26] seeing x-rays and MRIs you you learn to
[1:24:28] read them the doctor sometimes they'll
[1:24:29] say this is what this means and that
[1:24:30] what that and just looking at them and
[1:24:32] working day in and day out you begin to
[1:24:33] pick up those things you know and so I
[1:24:35] could look at the MRIs myself I could
[1:24:37] look at the at the scans the x-rays you
[1:24:38] could see it yourself the things that
[1:24:40] they were telling us and so I gave
[1:24:44] Jessica to the to the Lord I said Lord I
[1:24:46] can't do anything to help her so I
[1:24:48] simply give her to you
[1:24:49] if you take her life I love you as much
[1:24:51] so ever loved you but if you let her
[1:24:52] leave I'll I'll do my best to try to
[1:24:53] tell the world what you've done for her
[1:24:54] so we went to the day to the funeral
[1:24:56] some of you maybe saw her video that
[1:24:58] they put out down in Louisiana a few
[1:24:59] years ago if you took the time to watch
[1:25:00] it thank you for that I appreciate it
[1:25:02] and so I went to the funeral that day
[1:25:04] and his Shirl stayed with the folks that
[1:25:06] had come to the funeral there at the
[1:25:07] house and I slipped on back to the
[1:25:08] hospital I was sitting in the waiting
[1:25:09] area and all the doctors had spoke and
[1:25:12] they took me all their prognosis and
[1:25:14] they told me all that was going to
[1:25:15] happen but sitting in that waiting room
[1:25:17] that afternoon around 2:30 something
[1:25:18] like at 2 o'clock somewhere right in
[1:25:20] there all at once a warm feeling come
[1:25:22] over me and the line begin to roar Lord

[1:25:29] shall live
[1:25:38] Hey
