hallelujah amen would let you have your seats amen amen just so thankful for god's amazing grace you know the simplicity there of the of the song you said it it is done because he said it if a man said it we could question but god has spoken who can but prophesied hallelujah every word of god is yea and a man in him every word of god is sure god said i'm not a man that i would lie or have to repent everything that god has spoken he fulfills it and whatever the need is tonight we've all gathered here in a time of a special meeting and you know it's special because you're here we've invited him here it's a special time we may never be gathered quite like this again some might slip on and go on ahead of us it's a special time it's a time for our hearts and our lives to be refreshed to be strengthened in this journey for lives and hearts to be touched for god to move in a special way i believe this meeting it was not just something that we came up with i believe it was arranged before the foundation of the world and it's just god giving us grace to come under that influence that this all the parts would come together and i say god just like where the glasses had to be and the handkerchief in that vision for it to be fulfilled let every part of me be right where it ought to be that the word can be fulfilled for every need that's right here among us god is greater than your need as a matter of fact before you ever had that need he already was the answer before there was ever a sin or a sinner he was already the savior hallelujah he's the remedy for every problem for every situation he's the answer to every question who is it it's our lord jesus amen the lovely one that's right here in our midst i want to read just a scripture that we're all familiar with as we prepare for brother benny to come and just to minister the word of the lord and the prayer line that will follow i'm going to read a scripture here with you brother brian opened with that song who hath believed our report you know that's what isaiah wrote by inspiration being picked up from beyond his natural senses that who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed and this scripture in verse 5 says but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities this was before this was before he was ever manifested in flesh isaiah was caught up in the mind of god it was already finished the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed brother brian will you pull that up isaiah 53 verse 5. you know there was a man one time on a ship and he began to ask he said would you read that bible to me and this little boy he took the bible and took this scripture right here and he says pardon me he says but i've just got to read it the way that my mama wrote it to me and how it means to me and he said he was wounded for willie pruitt's transgression [Music] you see that's what the revelation of jesus christ is to you that's what the holy spirit right here tonight it makes it real this is report with your name in it and where it says our you read your name where it says my you read your name because if you were the only one he was coming for you hallelujah oh glory can we read it together and where it says our where it says my you put it personal that's your name let's read it together but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen [Music] this report is higher than every doctor's report [Applause] hallelujah this report is higher than whatever your track record or your past has been this report is greater hallelujah this is the report of the mighty conqueror [Applause] whatever your need is tonight just let it start pulsating in your heart tonight tonight's my night tonight's my night like the woman with the issue of blood she said if i can just put touch to him of his garment i know i shall be made whole [Applause] hallelujah he's here he's here hallelujah oh let's just let him have his way amen as the brothers would come to take the evening offering here we're going to pray over

girls god bless you my that blessed us amen the sisters my you come up here and sing from south carolina lord have mercy i was having a time back there amen god bless you thank you for yielding your talents to the lord amen to be a blessing hallelujah you know special singing is important in one day in a battle when they didn't know what to do god sent out special singers to sing beauty to the holiness of his name it brought such confusion among that that camp of enemy they fled they left their spoils so all that had to be done is israel had just had to go out and claim what was rightfully mine amen what a song for tonight as well believe for it that's all god asked us to do is to believe oh glory hallelujah heavenly father we just sense lord your august presence right here this evening

father you would move lord and drive back every unbelieving spirit lord and for every need lord of healing lord may they receive that virtue of the son of the living god lord in their body for it's by your stripes we are healed and we stand as believers that your report is greater than every doctor's report it's greater than every lie and every whisper of the enemy for thy word is true o god and we stand upon your word tonight lord as believers the lord we ask that you'll just bless the remaining part of the service bless the offering tonight lord and anoint your servant no god strengthen him

here jesus is here and he said with two or three are gathered together in his name there he be in the midst how many believe he's here gloria the word said so praise god so we want to thank god for each and every one and we have that prayer line tonight and the prayer but i want to say a few things if you will praise god that will help us how many have had experience with god i know you i know you're here because you had an experience with god so i'm gonna share you so share with you some of mine but if we go to the word if you will and and uh let's turn our bibles praise god praise the lord i used to listen to brother ernie how many remember brother ernie bill and wavers he's a good friend of mine he said i'm naturally supernatural how many in here is naturally supernatural amen they're part of you're part of god you come from god and go back to god if you if you if you have your bibles acts chapter 2 verse 15 and then we'll go to saint john acts chapter 2 verse 15 and these are not drunken that you suppose seeing is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet joel since have come to pass in the last days said god i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters still prophesied and your young men shall see visions and your own men shall dream dreams let's go to saint john it's just for reference if you will saint john chapter 1 and let's start at verse 20. just speaking of john and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ and they asked him what then are thy lies and he said i am not art thou that prophet and he answered no then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what saith thou of thy self he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness making straight the way of the lords as said isaiah the prophet and they which were sent were of the pharisees let's buy him heavenly father we thank you lord for your us being here again lord but most important thing that you were here and lord god you're a healer you're a redeemer you're our savior and father no matter what the world is doing what's going on god we thank you for your saving grace and your love and your unmerited grace toward your bride and we thank you lord for your loving us we pray that you will heal the sick cast out devils let your spirit come down lord any man can turn the pages of the bible as your prophet said but it takes you to interpret the word father we move our self out the way in the name of jesus christ that you have the preeminence amen amen praise the lord you may be seated i want to for a thought glory uh being affected by your prophecy praise god being affected by the prophecy praise the lord glory to we we are affected by so many things we're being affected by uh uh right now with the war in in in ukraine being affected by the virus and all this here where man but guess what those people that was in the word when the prophecy came they was affected by the prophecy of their day and hour god and i want to tell you something glory when god says something go you can rest on it the world will fall apart everything's been falling apart you can see how it's going now but the true genuine church the bride they're the elected of god they are being affected or moved by the revelation of the word of god what what got what got peter them and in the bible and acts what that what they were looking at they said when they he said listen this we are not drunk we're not oh no we're just not beating at the air we've been affected what's bothering us what's moving us what is moving us george said glory that god will pour out his spirit and i'm being affected by the word let me tell you that god promised god that he have a bride and you have a church and what i'm affected by not by the chaos in the world but i'm affected by malachi 4 luke 17 30 and hebrews 13 today this is my day my message your message you will not have another one you better let this here message have the effect in your life praise god hallelujah glory hallelujah glory you are part of the word you are walking you and i are walking in the predestinated ordained word for the hour and it's your day let me just say don't let the devil try to downplay it to you oh we just in the church and in the message and people go to but this had to be orchestrated by god there was no way i could be here you could be here at this time this hour this day this hour that you're living in this day these scriptures are the revelation is being fulfilled in your ears it's not them this is yours take it glory take possession of it are you listen don't ask for your healing take your healing don't ask for your joy take your joy the joy of the lord is a strength glory ask the devil can i can i get healed you know the lord said he says with his stripes i'm healed i'm gonna tell you something brother branham said he said if jesus christ was standing here tonight in flesh right now he could no more heal you he's already done it he's already done it you were by his stripes you were healed now listen where he put it he put it in your lap he put it in my lap if we don't get what we wanted it ain't god's fault god put it in your lap put it in my lap listen the centurion soldier i'm gonna take a few before i get to the centurion soldier he was not a believer he was a centurion soldier he was sent there to watch jesus because jesus had a big crowd following him all the time so the romans wanted to make sure that he didn't do no insurrection y'all heard that word beforehand all right so they had it there and he was watching and while he was at jesus service he saw as he spoke the word things would happen he healed the sick he was casting out devils and this century because you know when when you when you uh what they call that a security guard which i'll call those agents that he'd be around for around the president or secret service so he was a secret service guy so he actually kept his eyes on what jesus was doing and so when people would come he would just say speak the word and the person would be healed he'll say something and whatever he said it came to pass now this secret servant agent which is a centurion soldier was not a believer but he paid close attention to what jesus was doing i hope you pay close attention to what jesus is doing in this day glory and while he was on duty he got a report that one of his servants where he at the house got sick was about to die and he came running to the centurion told him said look your servant that you love he's at the point of death he's about to die lord and the servant said listen he got up he went to jesus he says lord my servant is at the point of death he didn't say come heal him he said can you heal him he said jesus now jesus said i will come and i go to your house because the servant wants that to meet like a lot of people they don't be at the meeting but they want to be healed but i want to tell you you're on live screen girl if you have faith you can be healed too glory because god is not limited after this service is going to be three weeks later god's still going to be doing what he did in his service he will still be doing it three weeks later the angel of the lord would be going around taking care of business and so when the centurion said he says uh jesus said i'll cover him he said oh no oh no i've been affected by i've been watching it all right let church say amen can i say something i ain't been affected by the gospel in the message i ain't been affected by what's going on i've been affected by the prophecy and that word you need lord he said jesus said i'll come he said no you don't have to come i've been watching you a long time speak the word only and my servant will be made whole in other words he was affected by jesus christ as the word was going out he knew that if that word could create the heavens created earth it couldn't say what it what it do it will come to pass he said you don't have to come to my house hallelujah why because what he was affected some people are affected by the negative things of the message no you must be affected by the positive supernatural part of this message because it will produce christ already god they thought that was over lord jesus said i had to find this kind of faith no not one my own people oh it seemed like it was over and then they came and told them said listen your servant was a men he was healed we say oh praise the lord that's it he said what time was it what time was why because he know the word is accurate it's dust said the lord the vision got to be right the hat got to be in the right place the word has to be built and if it's right it will come to pass exactly like god said it would he says about the ninth hour he said that's exactly time you spoke to me listen they asked john who are you are you in luther's message he said no are you that prophet muhammed he wanted to be that prophet but he wasn't that prophet are you uh who are you see if you don't know who you are you don't know where you're going and you don't know where you come from what difference it make if you lost you got to know where you come from and you got to know where you're going you come from god and you got to know that you're going back to god hallelujah jesus said what if you see me ascend up in which i came and they looked at him said listen we know his daddy his mama mary and joseph said what is he talking about and setting it up is he going to kill himself see they never understood his message and i want to tell you make sure you understand your message it is a supernatural message and inside i don't care if it don't look like it's going to work but if god said it going god will make it work everything for the good to them that love the lord who are the call according to his purpose glory [Music] listen brother branham talks about that lady in memphis tennessee how to he was getting ready going back home and the plane you know god diverted the plane but something he said was really distracting to me he said that he says she said i am like that sugar night woman but if i'm like the schumannite woman then where's the elijah in other words god can't be wrong god can't lie god cannot be wrong i'm in the same shape as she is then where's elijah and god in his soviet grace were to make sure my word take faith i can't lie elijah is on his way and guess what he's going to louisville kentucky but i'm going to change him out i got somebody that's been affected by the prophecy and i want them to know gloria that my word will not go out boy and he turned the plane around you know what memphis tennessee at y'all close to louisville kentucky right you know what meant is that memphis is way down on the other side over there it ain't nowhere near where you all at glory and what god had a plane landing way down there go ahead it'll be easy could have landed in cleveland he could have landed in dayton this was closer but what was it god wanted no listen he's jehovah gyra god will provide for himself and he took it all the way down to memphis tennessee and got up and he knows something how many like to be led by the spirit [Music] you know i found my traveling you know most people when they led by the spirit they always led to do something that they wanted led to go to another church they led to go to this list but they'll be led to take god at his word sometimes all y'all got quiet oh man good they that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god god will lead you and guide you to all the truth i say i'll leave that lord i told glory glory and when he got down there she had already seen the vision god had already spoke to her she got up she was praying he's got what people don't hardly do no more they pray five or ten minutes and popcorn prayer got up to lord i hope you do it lord now let me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep if i should die before i wake and sometimes they don't even finish that they get up they're going to work what we need glory is the old-fashioned holy ghost revival where people take the time with god take their time to listen i know we're busy but it's just like pharaoh when when god's word came pharaoh put more and more and more and more work on the people while to try to keep them away try to keep them away from god glory but you gotta listen you gotta take your time you gotta take what you need you gotta take your prayer time you gotta take your read your bible i don't care how many jobs you got you gotta say listen this is my portion lord gave this to me and glory how many know salvation is free come without money without price you don't have to pay nothing for it all you got to do is go in there and get what you want out of it it's free don't cost you nothing remember when got down there god told her that he's going to send him he didn't say he's going to send elijah he's going to send somebody by but he described to him what he looked like what he had on what he would be carrying glory and so when brother branham come and win it went inside the hotel and uh probably you know like dude put the briefcase down i ain't okay i'm gonna go for a walk something telling me take a walk so just walking for nothing you'll need a briefcase that's right he's walking so he got to walk walking walking said what lord keep going didn't say just keep walking what lord and why is that that's why it's very important lord when you when you your healing is a revelation glory no matter how much you feel sick when god revealed to you that you're healed i don't care how many doctors give up on you glory you were healed you just got to hold to it faith takes it away and doubt bring it back and she standing there lord what lord what lord and all of a sudden she saw her vision come into maturity here come a man walking down the street and she was checking him out he didn't have to be i didn't see the briefcase with her and she says listen she was absolutely sure she said good morning parson and she had been standing there four o'clock in the morning waiting all that time why because you know god don't fail when he tell you something when god tell you something even in this generation when god tell you something i don't care how many people try to downplay it how much the devil tried to do it how much the government changed everything will work the word will be fulfilled just like god said he put everything in place and all of a sudden yes good morning pastor brother brown said how you know i was a preacher because she said he told me he was coming [Applause] he he told god and you know what he's the same he's the same yesterday that then let me tell you about chris christie listen if you don't get anything else at this message i want to tell you this here when god moves on you and something have an effect in your life i don't care what comes if god didn't dead it affected your life it don't matter if you be like job you lose everything what you say the lord give it and the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord uh people don't say sometimes people think that everything gonna go good all the time sometimes god like to put a life through such suffering and brother brandon preached a message

it's going but he went through all that hard test and trust and yet god he never doubted god not one bit and that's what we need today in a church a message in this end time you're going so up and down up and down up and down you are super church you are super right you have something that no other generation has no other age thanks brother brandon will believe what you live in if it was laid out to you what age would you want to be and he said this age right here it is the most glorious age it's the best age and we let the devil fight think this is the worst age glory is the worst to the

did not have much she may not had much money she may not had all the great things in the world but she had something that every believer in the country needed in our house she had god vindicated among them that's what we need god that's what the church needs that's what individuals need laodicea is a spirit that makes you think that you're rich increase with good and don't even know nothing about god that's the lay of the ca we god call us out of that when we come to a place we let let god be first i like that i don't care what is every man alive let god be first let god be truth and he said she had something in the house and every person in jeffersonville gloria hallelujah and the united states need amen oh don't get quiet don't get quiet you know you know the church sometimes you know glory is this the power let me let me let me show you the power of god is in how much you surrender to god it's in how much you give to god power without character is satanic and a lot of times you could you can't serve two masses i get all my grade children all the time you know i said listen you can't serve two masters you're either gonna hold the one i hate the ugly you can't say i love god and didn't play with the world and then love god this week and play with the world though go you got to make a choice and listen that don't mean god to get rid of god will love you just to say whatever you give to god that's what god released to you lord listen brother branham said samson gave his strength to god but he gave his love to the life oh let church say amen some people go they give their lifetime and everything to the world and then come give god something that god don't you don't really need it god wants your body mind soul and spirit he want all of you not some of you all of you [Applause] you know young people say you mean to tell me we don't have no fun it all depends on what you call fun glory praise god glory glory all depends on what you call glory foreign god is already very you know god has a sense of humor glory he loved he loves it god god loves fellowship do you believe that listen when the angel of god spoke to brother branham when he was a young man he's five seven years old it had such effect on his life in life there he says listen don't drink now listen a young boy carried back some water from a liquor still or something like that but he said don't drink nor smoke nor defy your body in any way for i have a work for you when you get older i don't know how five seven years old listen he kept that promise he stayed to it didn't god have a work for him glory god used him in such a mighty way why because the prophet made an effort to listen glory i'm not going to let nothing affect my body because what the holy ghost want to use [Applause] [Music] and it had such an effect in his life when he got 16 years old he tried to smoke a cigarette they thought he was a he's a you telling young people that well i don't want to wear them you know all the other kids they can wear pants and we look funny you ought to look funny realize we are oddballs you may not realize it or not but you can lead all the world all you want to but the world thank you generalized christians they thank you in the oddball [Applause] praise god the super church you got to let the word have the effect on you it's your prophecy listen i'm just going to take a couple more and we're going to get to let church say man i'm on but i want to get to the impact of the point because a lot of us we let we be affected you know sometimes in church we deal with we let individuals affect us that's right sister so-and-so gave him 50 so i ain't got to do all that because she don't do all that brother sword so he he comes once at six at once two or three times a week don't you say nothing to me if i don't come up two times a week but people they let things like that okay oh don't get quiet let me can i preach brother branham said every church has a spirit glory my church had one your church and you got to feel like what's going on but what you need we want the holy spirit we want god holy spirit inside of us regardless of what the church do what individuals do we want to do what the holy ghost want [Applause] we want to be affected by the holy spirit glory because the life that you now live you live it by the revelation of the son of god glory jesus says who do men say how the son of man am yeah psalm says john the baptist or or elijah's or one of the prophets but jesus said who do you say that i am praise the lord he's a dad of the christ the son of the living god he said blessed are you simon jones amen i'd like to say it like this even i didn't reveal it to you flesh and blood has not revealed it jesus was standing there he could have said peter thank you you know i showed you what that is no no no and the pentecostal brother brown said they had it wrong they said it was upon the rock it was fun jesus christ he said it was not it wasn't built upon jesus christ it was built upon the revelation of jesus christ and he said peter glory upon this revelation i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it in other words it's built upon god revealing to you what he want done with the word glory hallelujah it's not built upon any individual organization it's built upon the revelation god come by glory hey listen god come by could be a a drunk alcoholic come out you say he ain't no could be a bomb on the street you say i don't know if he'll ever make it next time you look around he's the son of god why because god have mercy on who we will we look at things one way but god always he has the power to transform and it don't make no difference how bad a person is what day life is when god has a revelation and he can decide to reveal to them who he is god nothing can separate [Applause] that's the glory brother branham says this here when the healing he says in mark 16 16 says these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover period are you listening he said if a thousand of them died and he laid hands on what he'd do he said i still be laying hands on you know why because that's not my problem that's he i'm doing what he said he's the one got to take him and it's the same thing today he's the one got to give you your healing but we gonna do what he's saying are you listening sorry been effective let this message let this word i got some more there but i want to talk about them i love makai people don't like makai makai is one of those prophets that you know seemed like glory anyway makai you know think about it he was affected by elijah's prophecy sometimes when you're affected by the prophecy it ain't good it wasn't good but elijah told told uh uh he prophesied that the dogs would uh you know elijah uh eat uh what's his name ahab nigga's blood and jezreel and god got ready to fulfill that and when he got ready he was two brother he called jehoshaphat and ahab and jehoshaphat was a believer he's supposed to know better but i'm just going to say this here he was not reading the spoken word but micaiah was reading the spoken word so jehoshaphat we all brothers ain't nothing wrong with it god love us all but was reading what the prophet said elijah had said what was going to happen so when they ahab got ready to go to war he was affected by the prophecy he was not affected by the feelings of how they get all we so close together ahab and jehoshaphat he wasn't the fact that what was removing him what was moving him was can i say it brother branham's message [Applause] what was moving him was a message of the hour so it might so with mackay he got up there and they have and you know it's amazing they got all the preachers you know how they do they lead a little message preached out even though y'all kind of they have a big gathering they don't call brother they don't call brother bro they know he here don't think they don't know he's here a big denomination they have all the great the intellect they call it but they didn't no don't leave them alone they kind of separated them people don't know what's wrong with them they leave you out every city they know it glory and they knew it when mackay was there because they invited all other preachers glory to god and when they invited all the preachers there ahab and joshua was on the throne gloria and all the preachers oh shall we go up the rim of gilead that belong to us let's take it and all other preachers oh praise god we depend we got the president on our side he's looking at us we got we got our ddds we got our lsd we've been to school and everybody and we got invited to the president's house oh that's going up good they got so excited that uh what's his name jedicad put a little horn on him he start dancing in the spirit running back and forth getting the people all emotional worked up and everything running up and down we're going to drive him out and everybody oh god hallelujah but little did they know they were not watching elijah's prophecy [Applause] listen same thing today they can make up all kind of things they want to but it will be as he said it would be as he said if all the rest of it runs right then this got to be right [Applause] and elijah and when johnson fed he got feeling kind of strange you know praise the lord i remember when i was first i got to watch the time when i was first i was i wouldn't even believe it here and this man he was real nice to me real nice i didn't have nowhere we had just we was moving somewhere right and i didn't have nowhere to put my friends in the mag he come got it put it down everything treated me right he was a nice man and then i went to christian he said you need to serve the lord and i would hear my baptizing you know and so i said yeah i need to be baptized i said well i had to be baptized he's how you could be he said i can baptize you he said you could be baptized in your own name you know what that lost our friendship right there he he didn't have to say no more for something me said that ain't right all the nice stuff he did all the moving the furniture everything he killed it right there i said if i could be baptized in my own name i'm in bad shape go ahead i need somebody god that's done something i need life and i'm what neither christian did god oh sir gloria i said something ain't right praise god i knew that wasn't right bad bad as i was i ain't going and he called himself a christian praise the lord and i didn't know nothing about christians but i'ma show you predestination god was watching over his children when you were in the world the devil tried to do all he could to you god was watching over you when you were when you went to the catholic church or the methodist church of the battle they put you on the board they gave you all kind of things made you feel good but god was watching over you god no i got a message come you can stay there for a while but i'm gonna call you out come out of her my people be not partakers of their sins that you don't receive their play are you listen what did they play the children are being killed with spiritual death glory jezebel the entire church brother brandon said they're being killed her children with death he said spiritual death glory and they have you know i just thank god for joshua fatty christians sometimes you get a little off and the holy ghost come back and say that that's what you need that's what we need we all do we get a little fold off sometime and the holy ghost come and check us back we hold lord please forgive me i think that's what happened to jehoshaphat he got amen all these preachers said and go up and everything something ain't right something's not right i don't know what it is but something ain't right and he looked over they have he says have you got any more preachers i can imagine they have so i got 400 priests here you got you asking for some more ministers i got 400 here joseph i said yeah but is there any moment he says yeah we got one but i hate him he said don't say that you're supposed to be a believer me and you brothers you talking about you hating another brother all right bride don't persecute pride [Applause] don't do that no sir he said let not the king say so so when he sent the kitten uh makai and they said all you know the big the big wheels in the church because they're going to talk to makkah but they didn't know mackay you know he he listened to what the lord said whether he cut his head whatever he had to say what god said glory and he went down into my car got down to this house it's in my car now you know we having a big fellowship and everything in the kings and the king down there and uh i forgot we forgot to send you an invitation but uh they they want you to come uh can you come we forgot see i come but now when you come there's stipulations on your company you come don't disagree with nothing just all the key all the preachers all of them saying that this is the thing that the lord wants to do you know and yo you prophesy nice if you want to get along with the rest of the society can i preach if you want to get along with all the preachers in cleveland you know just go along the way they do things oh glory i ain't talking about message now i'm talking about the denomination so we find that when they got mccarty kept talking to us and now and everybody said good to the king oh yes god said you know what the lord speak that's what i say so they had continued talking to him talking to him so when he got there at the meeting they asked mccarthy you prophesy he said yeah well go on up king god is with you you'll succeed and they have to what you ain't never said nothing good about me every time he prophesied he prophesied against me and he said something good about me now right in other words he was a liar and a hypocrite and a bad person but yet he know that mackay was just being what they call that in court being coerced to make sure to make the kids feel good that's what it is what's that is curse that they get you in court to try to talk to you and they had cursed him now all the way down to he got to the palace he said grown up god is with you and they have said oh no how many times i want you don't tell me nothing but what dust said to the lord let me tell you something a lot of people don't really want to hear what exactly what god wouldn't say sometimes glory they want you to water it down smooth it over you know put something on it make it make you feel like but if god says something let god word be true forget it hallelujah and then it says he said how many times i mature you just tell me what god said that's all i want but he lied my machine had been affected by the message he had the message in his heart you got the message in your heart you may not think you do but god did put it in your heart [Applause] that's why some people they want to quit church and they go go home and they do more testifying out of church than they do in church try to get away from it god like jeremiah said like fire shut up in my bones i'm tired of these people going to let church amen and then what they said in the message hey these people hey they write this wrong they argued in church that's going on they fussing with this one this will talk about another and all of a sudden they say i'ma quit the next day you know you see them walking back in the door oh don't get quiet he said what's wrong with them what happened cause something on the inside there's a deep calling to the deep and there's a deep calling to your heart there has to be a deep to respond god said i don't care what they did you get in there and praise god i don't care how bad it is you go there but it's not you and them it's me and you and not you and your sister is you and god it's not you and the pastor it's you and god [Applause] [Music] oh don't get quiet it ain't you and your wife if your wife quit you gonna quit if your husband quit you won't quit it's between you and god [Applause] oh yes glory glory it's an individual glory and they have just i want to hear nothing but the truth i like makai he says give me about this time tomorrow all right i'm gonna go pray he didn't say well the lord showed me this he said give me about this time tomorrow i'll be back and he went home and he got to praying all kind of spirits come on castle spirit said i go take care gloria let church say i'm dramatizing that glory all kind of demons say let me go i'll get him let me go please let me go then the devil said listen i ain't never feel i've been a lying spirit he said i'ma tell you lying spirit said let me go down i'll be a lion spirit listen not in the mouth of one but i'll be a lying spirit in the mouth of every last one of them prophets all that had a lying spirit on now listen my my michael was in a vision so he's seen the vision so we go so now he's got the he's got to enter into that vision and come back and prophesy oh i hope you think brother branham job was easy no sir he had to tell people things that they didn't want to hear but if they want to get back with god glory hallelujah [Applause] glory they want to get it right they had to listen to what the spirit had to say to the church i get in a lot of things but makaya he goes back and everybody playing music everybody's happy oh glory makaya come back and all other preachers are there glory and all of a sudden ahab said what you say what did god take i mean shall we go up to battle or not he says listen i saw israel like sheep having no shepherd glory and he said listen ahab sorry all these preachers you got here glory i'm just using this for example got here sitting down talking about go go go get they've been anointed with a live spirit from god listen the live spirit comes from god but make sure that they make make sure that the prophecy that i have said would happen to ahab god it's ready to be fulfilled and they say wait a minute zelda kind of said what he went over there and he took my car and slapped him in the face which way the spirit of god went from you to me he said you're gonna find out one of these things [Applause] can i preach a lot of people gonna find out about this message one of these days as it was in the states but noah had to work in the face a lot so should it be in the coming of the son of man glory indeed they said listen put him in jail feeding bread and water affliction and don't until i return my card turner says if you return it all god had spoken to me it's scared it's scary uh a half so bad he went to his brother he said i tell you what brother i love you what i'm gonna do i'll disguise myself you put on your king role that's what he did he he actually had jehoshaphat to dress up like a king and he dressed up like an ordinary person why because what he was so scared of the prophecy because he know god if god said it does set the lord it was going to come to pass and they got glory they was out there fighting the battle fight the battle and everybody and the king of syria whichever the king was he said listen don't fight with nobody else but the king of israel kill him i don't care what you do god had already a date for for ahab to be killed all the evil stuff he'd done and they would just fight and fight fight and joseph was running for his life oh lord please help me lord they thought jehoshaphat was they have that's why don't be no false impersonators you might not know who you're impersonating [Applause] glory amen you wanna you wanna be real you want to be real and all of a sudden go and they said a man just took an arrow at a he just shot the arrow gloria and ahab was going under the arrow traveled right there and hit ahab right when it's in his side and he went over there his arm hurt i'm hurt and he went over the jerry parker's chariot there and he bled to death according to the elijah's prophecy hallelujah nobody could be that accurate listen brother bradley i can see between here in the camp there ain't no silver tip grizzly nowhere he said i don't care he's jehovah gyra he can put one there of course all of a sudden and he saw that brothers at him shooting shoot him he said no i shot him with one shot and he fell at my feet what it was because god is concerned about his word and god watching over his word to the haitians dramatized sometimes they were down there crying in the boat oh lord help us to care about me perish he said jesus got up he walked on top of the boat put his foot up onto him he said he looked at the storm he said peace i want to have you finish reading it he said he turned around and went back and laid down what it was he was absolutely sure that the storm had to obey his voice and you have to be absolutely sure that when you get your healing god heal you whatever just go back lay down and forget about it they say i'm healed i'm healed [Applause] when you start dreaming and start thinking when is it right and the devil reads it through it reason is one of our worst enemies that's that's for every christian because you're built like that how many know the greatest battle ever falls it's in the mind lord you have to fight you you think you fight somebody else but actually you fight your own mind thank you brother bradley said in that message said this he says if you could get on one accord in one mind it's a great valuable fault something like that he says every person could be healed something on that order okay and and if you get on one mind on the court you come up with you can be healed not because i say it because the word promised you praise god gloria let me give you a few testimonies and i'm gonna get ready we have a prayer line this is just for me we have a lot of things bro the reason why i say this because we believe this message and i i've seen the effects of this message i've been affected by this message gloria and that's why i glory i hold to with all my heart glory i love it brothers come oh brother brandon made a mistake i don't care i don't see nothing you know that that's up to you that's the way you feel about it gloria but let me tell you if he wasn't out there with the cloud you know what are you listening god could have had him out there and you couldn't even see it that's why people are so colonized glory what day people just get all worked up in carnal things god is your you know what god is right here now do you know god is over in africa right now gloria he's here he can do god does what he want to do one time i was getting ready to go to mission trip and i was going to africa the brothers actually from the bible about 35 40 bibles and this has been a while back and because i didn't have that kind of money today and trump's got to pay the ticket to go to africa and buy 35 demo uh what you call those not it was the king it had to be king james bible anyway long time and so it was like we come and we preached i never forget it we preached the service that brother mike sievert and while i was preaching in the service we had drove up to was coming from that was the camp then we preached for brother sivir and we gonna had to go back home and on that tuesday i had to fly to africa so we came coming back and i actually for some bibles brother sieber gave me one bible that's all he had brand new bible and i had maybe two bibles something like that so anyway as we was coming home driving my wife was there a couple of brothers in the church was with me and we were driving and we pulled into a gas station amen now this was a gas station and as we got pulled into the gas station the clerk was in there we went in to get gas and that was a big bookcase right in the front of the window of a gas station and the bookcase had a lot of bibles lined up on the bookcase nothing no other books but bibles and so when i when i walked in there i looked at it from my gas and i looked at the clerk i said i said uh but these bibles said its signs said free bibles i said these bibles free he said can't you read it said free bibles praise god i took i took all those bibles packed them in my car correct and i took took them all three bibles [Applause] and god had god had provided this was a gas station with potato chips and sodas for bookstores praise the lord and you know what i've been back here but several times up and down i found a gas station yet i tried i tried to find it i'm serious coming back i tried to find that place but never could find it no more praise the lord god god can heal god god can heal we've seen we've seen people you know uh i had a sister not too long ago two sisters in the church one of them working the other kind of work so we've headed to we've headed to england and it's going to paris you know different places so i was just talking so of which one where when i wanted to go i think it was charity and her sister's oldest sister named grace so i was just preaching and i afterwards i said i looked over at grace i said grace why don't you pay charity ticket and god gonna double your money i'm just thinking you know that dude's glory you're in church then most of you heard it so i didn't think that about race so grace said charity said i'm going that's why she said grace went on to pay my ticket so her sister paid for a ticket to go listen we were in england we hadn't went to paris yet we was in england grace called her and said oh guess what somebody account i don't even have direct deposit but direct deposit exactly amount for double two tickets was in my account she she still testified at that today the money got in there nobody couldn't put it in there no that cause she don't have no direct deposit but he's jehovah jairus god provides for himself a sacrifice [Applause] cancers healed see the healers this message will produce the supernatural people don't care about what you say oh brother yeah brother branham showed us read the wife said only believe only believe that's right because see if you don't believe you can't you

i went to the service i got in the service brother was preaching and i kind of fell out went dizzy in the office so the brothers came back there and prayed for me but i said lord if i'm dying you had

that sunday morning i said man my i think that uh was that saturday saturday night whatev but anyway yeah saturday night but so friday after the service friday i left and i went home and i always like to clean my car before i this is in broad daylight so i got home after service i drove back from atlanta from me drove home got in my car and then i was out vacuuming my car cleaning cleaning my car backing it out getting ready because i was going back to atlanta to the meeting that night while i was in the in in vacuum of a car a mosquito about that being came and bit me on my neck you might say it's a paradox but it's true anyhow this is in the broad daylight when he bit me on the neck blood started coming down you know what i went back to the hospital too so you know where he bit me at he bit me right on the blood clock [Applause] [Music] they didn't have to dissolve no blood clot to this day and i figured i said lord i'm going to say lord your soul and god the boy spoke to me and said if i could protect david with a spider i can protect you god used animals he used whatever you want to that musketeer and when i went back to the doctor the lady the nurse when he went there look at she said why that big old knot right there on your glory they took all the tests over not no blood clots no nothing in my whole body and you talking about what he but you got to let this message have the effect in your life got to have effect in my life praise god listen you get ready to come to the prayer line i don't care what kind of sickness you have you believe god praise god i had a had a brother brother joey he had a stroke he was out completely blood matter of fact him and my deacon one of my deepest best friends and uh matter of fact they call him uh uncle joe anyway joey he had a stroke it was so bad they thought he wasn't gonna make it he was bleeding out his mouth knows everything but this is his testimony while he was in there they were taking him to be you know worked on he said the lord spoke to him and said you're going to be all right he said i could hear everybody crying and everything there he said you're going to be all right but let me let me just say this here they said you weren't going to walk wasn't going to do nothing we're going to be able to drive in less than five they said you can't drive for six eight months a year he got out of the hospital three days he was at the hospital and he came to the house pastor i said what you're doing driving he's oh i can drive one week i said brother joey and his wife she called me said he won't listen he don't need to be driving and i said well he'd be all right but when i rode with him i said he don't need to be driving lord after after i took a ride with him i realized he didn't he didn't need to be driving but the stroke had a little effect on it but he he had that kind of faith he really moved glory praise the lord glory you can have whatsoever you believe if you don't doubt you can have whatever you say god god got mad with brother branham about to give him all the power i said a little angry i'm using the word man but when he got down there he was relying on vision to rely on he says why are you crying out to me i have given you all of this power brother branham had all the fish all the trees everything it was in it was in his hand and he said now he tells moses gave more to say they're speaking things in existence you could speak squirrels into existence you just swore that dropped in your hand you said why are you trying to speak the word now the word well is in you the word is in the bribe god bless you listen no matter what it is tonight that's just a few testimonies i don't i don't like too much telling too many jokes people i want you to you know lord jesus christ one time i was preaching i don't know who was here i was preaching just for years and we started the church we had some supernatural things and i went up tempting about i used to run tent revivals too but we had a we was in church and one day i was preaching and as i was preaching i was holding a pulpit like this and something pushed me over so i moved over i know what it was and the spirit of god just sent it down like a dove and just pushed over and somebody in church took a picture and i realized they took a picture they saw a light and the light was the spirit of the dove after that i went to a minute saver witnesses and i showed it to a lady in there and said look we got a picture of the dove you know just talking she said i'll get a bird in the church how y'all get a dove it was so real that she saw it was a dove the lady started coming to church the spirit of god descended out like a dog i still had the picture in my office i don't talk about it much but i still had a picture in my office but uh miss oh i forgot the lady name anyway but anyway she came to church for that testimony so this message ever since i've been in this message god has supernaturally done things not just here and you have it here at your church a lot sometimes we get we get try to get don't get used to it but take god at his word when the pastor says up don't let it get so common to you go ahead god said go ahead go ahead and possess the land go possess it at once be one of the be uh what's that joshua and caleb moses had an effect on them joshua said gloria caleb without that we're more than abel someone said but we got giants out here they said what gives you did you see what he saw no i see no giants let's go possess the land at once because they were looking at what was prophesied what was spoken and what was saying and this message glory that you're in that i'm in that we believe everything god said will come to pass and it's a scripture identification all right listen and one of god's characteristics let me know what one of god's characteristics is god is identified as characteristic one of god characteristics is supernatural not natural supernatural may god bless you as we get ready listen let this message have the effect in your life in your family in your home on the job let god have the effect in your life may god richly bless you god wish you bless
