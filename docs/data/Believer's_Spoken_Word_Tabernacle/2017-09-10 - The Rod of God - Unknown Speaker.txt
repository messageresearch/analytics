praising you and having my moments with you because I know where I'm going in the end again I'd like to thank this church and Pastor Samuel [Applause] amen thank you thanks be to Jesus for that amen amen we could all we could all stand up and give a similar testimony couldn't we thank you Lord for saving my life thank you for changing my life Hallelujah thank you thank you Lord amen brother Crest come on forward brother brother David press has a testimony for us this morning as well and then sister Mercy he's going to bless us with a special so she get ready as our brother gives us testimony how about we Give the Lord a good hand clap of Praise this is hallelujah that's the only thing I miss about using a microphone is I don't get to clap anymore man God bless you all I want to thank you all for your prayers and your love and for the cards and everything and and all this time you know you're going through these battles of life and we all do it's good to know that there's someone praying you know sometimes when you're going through it your faith just sometimes is not as strong as those that have maybe even been through a similar situation are just concealed your your needs and pray so I just want to thank you and Shirley wants to thank you and give you all her love and I Believe by God's grace when she gets enough strength she'll be back in amen and I got a couple of things on my heart so bear with me a minute I I feel this I need to tell you this okay and uh for one after this surgery and God blessed us and brought surely through it she couldn't move her left leg she couldn't do nothing with it I was having to put a build on it and when she wanted to go somewhere with the Walker I had to move that leg and so she kept trying kept trying never could move it nothing it was numb it was dead so this Thursday before church uh brother Samuel gave us a call and he said brother Dave he said I'm on uh we'll talk just a little bit and he said I want to pray with Shirley just go over there and lay your hands on her so I said I'll turn the phone on speaker too so he was again to pray and as he began to pray the presence of Our Lord just moved into that room and I could hardly hold the phone and I I know God was doing something answering prayer answer in all of your prayers for he's faithful and and so the next morning surely had been trying to trying to move that leg and I was sitting over my shirt and she's sitting out on the couch and she started to try to move that leg and he went right up hey man that's good hey man Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change his word Can't Fail amen and so so she kept getting stronger and and walking and this morning she was walking around in the kitchen without any help of a walk or cane or anything God's good and I just alone for the time we can take our walks together we'd do a couple miles around the track and talk about the Lord and I just loan for that time I now believe God will bring it it's just he gives us he can give us our hearts desire we have the right motives and objectives and to be back in church and serve him another thing that's been on my heart and I I told Brother Samuel about this and I'm kind of and it's hard for me and I'm kind of ashamed of this but I want to tell you for for six years I went through a hard time with my nerves not just nervous this was different this was a nervousness that you had no control and that you you was like in a tunnel you couldn't get out you know you were saved everything was okay there but these nerves were coming apart and I hope if somebody's going through this this might help them and at times I thought my mind was going to snap not that I wasn't saved I just couldn't control this and they ended up sending me to Cleveland I was like an outfall in some and so forth and and the doctor there said David it's it's not your heart they was checking all that he said it's your nerves and he gave me some medicine and it helped but it didn't take it away and I and I was taking this medicine and doing the best I could and we lived at Norwalk at the time and I was on my way to work and I stopped at this light and it's really something it it was the light that was on my road that I Live Now 250 and Robert Road you say that's a coincidence no God God don't do just coincidence he knows exactly what he's doing he's in control and I'm waiting on the light to change and that was bothering me and that still Small Voice Spoken Here I wished I could hear it more you know but he knows what he's doing and he spoke to me and he said this isn't going to bother you anymore and it left [Applause] and it's never bothered me since and that's been years ago and it won't because he said he wouldn't man [Applause] one other thing I want to tell you and I I this is hard for me and I think of the woman that was in the prayer line on that deep call of the deep to the film and she said he she was all tore up and he said someone told a lie on you I said you were a witch and he said sister that's why your heart's like this and you're all to her but you know what God knowed and it was over and he's also let me know about this it's been hard for me but there was a trouble I told on me and it hurt me so much and it's hard and I prayed and I know that I couldn't defend myself if I did that I would take it out of God's hands and I want it in his hands and I realized he knows all about it he let me know and I'm so what comforted me was that he knows the truth of everything see Satan will do those things and you know I'm sorry that I was ashamed I should have been asking my brothers and sisters to pray for me that's God's way the body of Christ but I I you know I just wanted to let you know that like the other evening it was always about three in the morning or something I was praying and I thought I had fully forgived I had tried but I hadn't and God helped me by his grace to fully forgive and I pray that whoever told that lie and whoever believes it would be forgiven with all my heart that it'll be gone and not not held against him so I I thank God it took a long time but he brought me to that place that I could really really forget with all my heart amen God bless you thank you for your prayers love you and appreciate it [Applause] just seen that little course he's laughing well as sister Mercy is going to come and sing a special for us [Music] he's alive and well living in me to tell [Music] the world [Music] same yesterday to today and forever Is Us and we're so we're we're still getting used to this new Bluetooth thing so we'll sing that one more time as she gets a for uh Ben back there he's alive [Music] [Music] [Music] awesome testimonies bless our God and I just think the Lord put the song in my heart this morning and I think the top off those wonderful testimonies of Our Lord I just think that this will also bring glory and honor to Our Redeemer so pray for me foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] my God [Music] my God is [Music] vision [Music] the words [Music] more than anything you've done [Music] oh my God my God [Music] my God is Mercy [Music] [Music] worship you

knees [Applause] praise God amen oh my goodness it's been such a nice song Seriously oh right the best part's still coming praise God hallelujah amen is Brother Sam who gets ready to come it was requested we sing this one this morning it's cold I'm so glad he found me it's in the a newer songbook man how many say Amanda that's more I'm so glad Jesus found me amen [Music] oh I was on a mountain wandering from The Fountain and I heard my savior calling me he said come to me relenting [Music] you foreign so glad he found me [Music] led me to that shelter [Music] his own [Music] Halloween [Music] walk on the streets [Music] love him ever [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] the joy [Music] ful someday [Music] my homie [Music] with your rescue see one more time [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] through my own Glory foreign [Music] Hallelujah when I believed I received the deed but I still had all leans against me but once the abstract has come then all liens have been stricken off another way of placing it is that when one of the times I was going to go to the first time I was going to Ghana I didn't realize they needed a Visa I didn't know I needed a visa to get into Ghana so I had to do all overnight within a week but you know God was determined to go for me to go so the Lord made a way through all of my ignorance and when you look at it I could had a passport I could have flown and come to there but I would not have been gained entrance into the country without a Visa and the prophet said the passport that's your belief your Visa is your token [Applause] you can have a passport but they don't mean you're going to get in you must have the Visa and the Visa is God himself confirming and accepting your faith that you were indeed with him before the foundation of the world amen and the Visa you know when I applied for Visa there was the first one it was only for I think 30 days so then I had to apply for the next one because they wanted me to come the following year when I applied for the next one then it was for 60 months now brother Samson then we're rejoicing they're like he's got to keep coming keep coming keep coming but this Visa it's a seal until the day of redemption there is no expiration because in full reality you are always saved [Music] but the Holy Spirit has come upon you to make you aware of this amen oh glory be to God oh my isn't it wonderful right through the scriptures all we see is redemption Redemption Redemption amen wonderful story amen that we're so thankful that it's a reality within our hearts amen we're so glad to have brother Daniel here with us and see some other visitors here God bless you amen we welcome you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen it certainly is good to be gathered together here we're going to lift the mission offering today and I'm not going to make any other announcements I want to just turn it right after this have the young people if they'll go ahead and make their way up they're going to sing the special here for us um I think what what is it but you're not Ebola yeah I've talked about the language they they know what I'm talking about I just sing along with them when they're at the house but there I believe it'll bless you just as a wonderful wonderful thing and I know brother Daniel when my wife was playing it last night brother Daniel heard it and his ears perked up and so we wanted to them if they'll sing that and you all just I know it's kind of spare the moment but you all just pretend like we're in the basement having a good worship time I tell you what we had some we had some tremendous tremendous youth meetings the last service we came up after two hours it's them it's not me two hours them before they let us up I

just welcome I tell you what it's the safest Street you could be on the safest place you can live it isn't because it's Amherst either amen so we love the Lord as the brothers are coming also to take up the mission offering I also there was mention many requests about praying for the saints of God throughout the Caribbean and throughout Florida um I know I was looking at a picture last night I have a grouping where I speak and collaborate with Ministry and brother Danny steaman posted on there for us and their Church there in Sarasota they have made it a shelter so it's a shelter right now and um you know I don't I don't know I'll find out more after the services over here when I go back in and look with all of them and see how everything is taking place but let's just continue to lift them up in prayer there's not not only Saints but so many lives and uh you know it it truly is something a time that we're living in uh is a lot of things that are taking place before the believer even in the midst of when there's times of kind of Destruction and heartache there is a great hope and a consolation that helps us and directs us through those things so we I tell you what friends

Revelation chapter 4 verse 5 to 11 and let me quickly say once again God bless you once again for having me here with the church I appreciate that amen Revelation chapter 4 verse 5 to 11. and out of the throne proceeded Lightnings and tenderings and voices and there were seven lambs of Fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like unto Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne where four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the dead bees had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and the four Beast has each and the four beasts had each of them six wings above him and they were full of eyes Within and the rational day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was Ernest and is to come and when those bees give glory and honor and tongues to him that said on the throne who lived forever and ever the Four and Twenty Elders fall down before him that sought on the throne and worship him that leave it forever and ever and cause their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created let's have a word of Prayer dear Lord we thank you again for this moment oh this moment oh God when you are giving us a day like this and Lord Jesus you said we should live in it and rejoice we are rejoicing because of the word that you have been manifest into our lives we are thank you very much oh God for the ability to read this but Lord we know it takes your presence to bring the word forth to your children I therefore commit myself into your Mighty and this morning I commit your children into your Mighty and this morning father let thy Spirit come and guide us Lord explain this word of father that it may bring some goodness into our hearts it may bring joy of Salvation oh Father it may heal us from every sickness and diseases in the wrong burdens and problems away from your people it will liberate us oh God from the cases of this world we are praying looking unto thee this moment of father that you bless us this morning father we remind the brothers and sisters who Lord Jesus Christ who are living in this hurricane prone areas father we are praying your protections we are praying your guidance we pray Almighty hand O Lord Lord Jesus deliver them from anything oh God that will be a disaster we thank you Lord and we're looking forward Lord for all that in Jesus Christ name we pray with Thanksgiving amen shall we take our seat I want to agree with David this morning he said let I was happy when they said let's go into the house of God yes because in the house of God there is Liberty in the house of God that is joy in the house of God that is freedom Hallelujah in the house of God you feel the presence of God coming around you and even within you that is why I agree with David this morning and I'm always happy to come into the house of the Lord because there is no way I can have my joy only in his presence amen well this morning we want to continue the rest where we left last Thursday those of you will not hear Thursday I'm sorry I cannot go back we are going forward thank you Hallelujah but uh I think the topic of the sermon was come up either amen um I wish I have time to do the part two the part three before the path forward uh the Lord just told me that bring the path forward this morning so that is all I can do amen we have to talk about the door opening the the throne and all that but he said go straight to the part four so I just want to obey the spirit Hallelujah so that is it come up Peter part four and uh I've just subtitled it worship of the elders so we are going to dwell more about the worship of the elders this morning I believe you love worshiping God amen and amen if you don't love worshiping God I don't know why you claim that you have the Holy Spirit yes sir because that is all the holy spirit makes us to do we worship God we worship God we worship God that is why alieners I wish that the brothers and sisters will stand here and they will sing and sing and sing and sing again Hallelujah the worship of the elders now beloved uh we want to go by this is that uh if God was calling John to come up we established last Thursday that it meant that his work on Earth was finished and for that matter his Spirit was no longer going to be on the side and John representing the bride was the only one that had the Holy Spirit that is why the moment the Rapture took place there wouldn't be any Holy Spirit on this side the holy spirit is here to operate in the Sons and Daughters of God it is because of you the holy spirit is here therefore if God take you from they said what will be the essence of the Holy Ghost again on the side so it got to a time God was calling the church the bride Jesus Christ was calling uh John come up and come and be with me here hallelujah it's just like a young man you know meeting a young lady and you know perhaps whatever they would say we we don't know the the loving word the love words that maybe he will tried later and then oh I love you and I do date and her dad well they can do all that who didn't know anything about it but there will come a tie it will no longer be just letter writing open out now we use foams it's easy to test you'll be sending you know just let you know where's just like that now how many of us write letters nobody write letters most of that when we passed we send through the you know waves and it will it will come to a time it will no longer be that but then the man the young man will make sure that you bring that lady to himself when everything is done according to marriage principle and that is where God also rich when he say that my wife can no longer be far away on this Earth whilst I'm over there so he was calling the Bride come up and come and be with me amen and amen but then he said that and I will show you things that are coming to be you see the the the wife must go to the husband to know exactly what that man is made up of Hallelujah you must live with that man or the lady must live the man must live with the lady also to know exactly what that person is made up of but we thank God he has sent the Holy Ghost to to to to bring everything that is within us out Hallelujah you see the point so now we are living with Christ but then it might manifest that their Rapture must take place there should be a manifestations of it so now he said come up to my Abode and I'm going to show you things that are going to be hereafter and John says that that's fine and out of the throne proceeded lightenings and thunderens and voices and there were seven lumps of the fire of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God lightenings thunderance I remember the prophet saying that it's because the Redemption work was over so if the Redemption work was over then that Mercy Seat tend to be judgment seat that is why you hear that panderings hallelujah voices enlightenings to do what to scare but then the bride was safe in the hands of God and you see the Salvation Spirit okay burning the seven lamps of of of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seventh spirit of God there is a place that he made us to understand he said this Savage spirit they are just the character of God you know all this this Sovereign Spirit you see they represent the colors the colors of God it depicts you know the motive okay it brings God's purity among his people it shows what God is made up of the design the way and manner he operates it's embodied in this service spirit all this the seven fire that was burning around all over the throne praise be the name of our God Hallelujah verses he said and Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like unto Crystal and the mess of the throne and run above the throne where four beasts full of eyes before and behind Hallelujah you catch it now now in the old Tabernacle this sea of glass like onto Crystal John he said I saw in the order we saw it there but then it was known as sea of brass that was the water that they used to wash the sacrifice because you cannot take the sacrifice straight away to the altar to be you know killed they have to ascertain they have to assess and prove that that sacrifice is qualified you couldn't take any any animal with a runny nose excuse me uh perhaps one year is off and maybe the leg is not even no you don't present that to God so they will assess the sacrifice now when it is proven in accepted then they wash it in the sea of brass they wash it before it will be presented on the on the on the on the altar and the same applies to us as Sons and Daughters of God one way we are presented as sacrifices and we are being assessed Day by Day and Night by night we are being assessed by the Holy Spirit the word of God is what is changing us every day the world come to do something in our lives other an elderly brother back home in the church one time he came as a pastor any day I come to the church and I I preach and the word don't touch my body I don't feel well I said brother God bless you continue to Avail yourself because God's word come for a purpose and the purpose is to straighten up his sons and his daughters and why that it is being experienced in US it means we are being washed Hallelujah we are being watched brother we must be washed by the word of God Hallelujah there are seven times here you see some beloved Brethren when they are at fault and they need to be rebuked and then when they are rebued they become so I mean they want they don't want to rebuke no if you don't want rebuke can you call yourself a child of God if you don't want to be corrected can you call yourself a son of God because the bible say that day that I love I rebuke and I trust you be Zealand therefore and repent so we need to be washed by the word I don't care how hard my Minister my pastor will preach to me so long as the preaching is affecting my life I'll open up myself let the word of God come into me and let it Wash Me Up I remember when I was there a school boy yeah age in the primary school far away then you know our character sometimes as a boy you go and play soccer I'm not talking about football because I know if I say football I'm going to confuse you play soccer and we do everything in the sand and perhaps you go home without buffing and then go and sleep it was not quite long then we develop some rashes on our skin it was very itchy it's on rushes came all over the body and but then I was not living with my mom my mom was far away somewhere in the village and then when we vacate we go and be with with them and so that time when I I got to the village and my mom saw me and you saw she saw there right she said what went from you what happened to your body I couldn't I couldn't tell her that well I refused to Bath some time that is why I didn't say that but because she she's an elderly she got to know that that was the the the the reason why those flashes Has Come On Me and my mother went to the market the following day bought an antiseptic soap and you know we use something we call sponge I don't know whether you know of it there is some rauli can tell you what it's about okay that's what we used to Bath and there are other that they are very rough some are smooth some are rough my mother went in for the rough one oh my God and you put fire I'm sorry water on fire well I don't remember the the temperature but I realized that it was boiling then she pointed the bucket and call me hey come here and my mother started to buff me oh no mercy she wasn't Wicked she was trying to make sure that those pain rashes go out so she started scrubbing and I was shouting I mean you can imagine the way and man or my body tend to be blood because the surface all peeled up and then she poured the hot water on me oh [Music] I couldn't move I was just screaming just like that and then after she applied the same antisective soap into those things but I tell you within three days it was gone within three days it was it vanished from my body and brother don't you think that if we are using the word of God also in the same way can you imagine the Purity and Holiness and righteousness that will be in the church Hallelujah because brother we need to be watched by the word of God we need to be washed by the righteousness of God Hallelujah read the scripture quickly before I continue Hebrew chapter 10 . Hebrews chapter 10 and I think verse 22. he says let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water and a pure water here beloved represent the word of God that is the only way whereby we can't be washed and be washed well so right now I am happy brother that we are Washed by the word amen When You Believe you were baptized it's a sign of washing watching the sacrifice before it's presented and the house of God we do worship we wash our bodies we wash our minds we wash our paintings we wash our attitudes we want everything that we do we wash it so that we can present it well before our creator amen and amen he continued to say that wrong about the throne wherefore be is full of eyes before and behind there were four beasts someone who said they are living creatures and all that what were they doing the prophet made us to understand that they guide the Throne of God they were thrown guards but they were very smart their character was their power Hallelujah and they have eyes before and behind so in this sense there is no way that they go backward because they are first year they were they have eyes here and they have eyes there so when you're going this way they go forward Hallelujah yes sir and when you're coming this way they come forward that is wonderful works of God you understand that you know that is why the prophets whom God used they have those instincts in them all the prophets of God the alphasis here I'm sorry they have eyes here and they have ICA Hallelujah you said brother prove it I'm going to prove it to you right now when God created Garden of Eden Moses was not there but Moses came and told us the way a man of the creation went by Hallelujah the time that he told Noah to build the ark Moses was not there but Moses came and told us vividly everything that transpired at that time he was a man but he was a prophet he got ice here and he had iced here Hallelujah one day he called the Israelites and told them your lord your God will raise a prophet light unto me and he was talking about Jesus Christ long years before Christ was born why did he able to see or why was he able to see the future because he had eyes here to see Hallelujah then we have someone also by name William Marion Brown well I don't know how you take him to be but I take him to be a prophet of God in this end time of course in this audition he was the one that first made me to know that job leave so many years before Abraham was born before then I always open the Bible and I read job in the middle of the Bible with that Creation in my mind that even Moses and the rest lived before him but I have that mind that prophet of God to tell me that job live so many years before even Abraham was born what was that he had eyes behind him that can go to the Past to bring peace that happened over there into us one day also he got up and he says that I see Mussolini taking over Ethiopia and who fall on his own steps it happened he said I see somebody called Adolf Hitler he'll come to a mysterious end it happened he's saying that I see the morals of women going low and low and lower it has happened amen and communism coming together and communism will swallow them up Hallelujah he said I see an automobile without a steering wheel he did he said all these things hadn't they come to pass they are all here with us we have a testimony that this man indeed had eyes before him and eyes behind him and these were the qualities of those four beasts who were at the throne the prophet that they were protecting the bride amen now let me read after seven quickly again he says and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the ten bees heard the face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle amen now when you go back to the Old Testament you see that it came to a Time God divided the tribes into four amen amen one was calling the army he divided them into four groups today we call them first Battalion second Battalion Ted Battalion and fourth battalion and uh in all those four groups they had leaders in the certain group Ruby was the leader and I think they had a sign was the first uh an ox in the East was Judah okay and Judah also had an inside of a lion in the in the West Was Ephraim and they also have a sign of a face of a man then in the north was done who has an eagle as they are inside now but when we come to the Book of Revelation John say that he saw these characters around the throne what were they doing there now we go back and see exactly what the prophet put it he said these beasts were there to protect the bride Hallelujah because without this character without this Powers the Antichrist could do anything but he says that the elect cannot be deceived so at all times Gods make a provision to guide and protect his people and the prophet was talking about um a horse rider you know a horse rider with a with a white collar came down and even before we didn't know that it was the same man that was changing himself like that The Same Spirit was changing colors only to deceive but anytime you bring a color then one of these beasts will call John John come and see and then John will see and John will be ready for any eventualities Hallelujah he came with white then he came with the red then he came with black then he went back and mixed all the colors you know anytime the character will prevail that same power of God brings anointing also upon the Believers so while he was doing that in the beginning is with a white color Paul was using the spirit of the Lion to conquer the Antichrist and it follows suit when it came to the time of Arena's mountain and Coloma we saw what happened over there the ox when it came to Martin Luther and the wesleys we know that God was using the spirit of man to conquer the Antichrist and then when I got realized that any way he tends he is known by the spirit of God that he go trying to come and deceive so he wants to mix all the colors now he came with a pale color you cannot determine what it is but little did he know that it was the same time God was using the flying eagle Hallelujah whether you can never deceive the eagle because the eagle have got perfect eyes that can see as far as it goes Hallelujah so he realized that there was no way he could deceive the bride Hallelujah so that was a purpose where God placed this four living creatures amen and amen now verse 8 here he says and the four beasts had each of them say swings about him and they were full of eyes within and they arrest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was Ernest n is to come Hallelujah and these are the power that guy you see anytime anytime the inner serving Church ages these four bees they have their Ministry fulfilled every Church age through the seven churches when God was using the spirit of this Beast you'll find out it was a perfect wealth of salvation a very perfect book of salvation so then when this work is manifested it brings glory to God in heaven and the angels themselves could not sit still but they begin to praise and worship God because the ministry of these four bees have been made manifest among the sons and daughters of God on Earth Hallelujah so there's no holy holy holy Lord God Almighty it was a time for worship so the 24 Elders were worshiping God why were they worshiping God then why they removed their crowns and they fell at his feet and praise him and worship him it was because you have been saved [Applause] that is all that is all it was because you have been saved let us forget about the things that is happening let us forget about it but let us look to the things that God have prepared for us we cannot stop anything from happening the only thing we can do is to make sure that we are in the will of God that is all sometimes it is pathetic brother sister to see so many natural disaster here and there people suffer and we feel because we are human we feel hurricane this hurricane that hurricane this hurricane not he put burden upon us because we have to pray for the loved ones we have to pray for the children of God to be protected but many attacks we forgot that is the same Human Nature human character human behavior human disrespect to God's word that causes all these things when man get to a place that they don't they don't have no respect for God again what do you think will happen Hallelujah when when when when the world reach a place he said put God aside let us stop our freedom you can have your freedom now but when you get to Hell there you see that you don't have any freedom there so their behavior and the attitude of human powers God make all these things to be but then it brings bedding we pray for one another oh Lord protect your sons and daughters over there amen and certainly we know God is capable of protecting his sons and daughters Hallelujah so the angels have nothing to do but to worship God because they realize that the ministry of these four beasts has completely manifested among his people when the believer stands for the word of God there is only one sound perhaps right now you don't have ear to hear but it sounds only anything that you do to honor God's word there is a sound of Holiness around you you don't have ears to hear right now but the angels in heaven they hear it that is why they worship God Hallelujah that's nine and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who live at forever and ever the 420 Elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that live there forever and ever and cause their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created oh Hallelujah that was so I was feeling well when that building was singing foreign [Music] oh brother sister this is the time of worship Hallelujah this is the time of worship amen because everything has been done already now God is calling you come up hither [Music] come up hither from this world come up here from America come up with that from Africa from Europe come up from all over the world it is time of assembly in heaven over there Hallelujah we are waiting for that day when our bodies are going to be changed but brother let me tell you this morning the process of your body change is already in you [Music] the process have started already but we are waiting for that day when it shall be made complete when you are coming all over the place right now you see green green corn on the fields you see uh what we call the other one soya beans green very nice beautiful by the time is coming you'll not see it to be green again it will tend to be Brown meaning is matured meaning it's time for Harvest but let me tell you that brown color is already in that green substance that brown is already in the green substance and day by day day by day that Brown is looking forward to manifest [Music] my son and my daughter before the foundation of the world daddy your change started Hallelujah your chain started and it has been in process till this time but I don't know how many days has left for you to turn brown but certainly you are going to turn bro one of these days and that is where your body will be changed and we say we will not prevent dogs that are asleep for they shall come out first and we shall cut up together and meet the Lord as sure shall we ever be with the Lord it is worship time and brother we should not be like miserable people should not be like people who don't have any hope we should worship and praise our God for this is the time of worship Hallelujah if those elders if those elders were worshiping God if God's Elders cast out their crowns and bow down and say holy holy Lord God Almighty because of you coming to believe the Lord what should you be [Applause] do you understand that question God because of you what should you be You Must Praise also hallelujah amen brother it's time for us to worship God it's time for us to praise God my sister it's not time to think about your problems Hallelujah yes you cannot handle your problem you cannot solve your problem if you can solve that problem why do you sit till today why should you save to today and you have not solved your problem yet and because of that you don't have the Liberty to worship God it's a setback Hallelujah forget about it and think about the worship of God [Applause] Hallelujah God will take care of those things now what you require from you is to worship Him amen oh praise be to the name of our God I am putting for Gabriel instruction to Daniel he says the first to the 14th verse of the fifth chapter of Revelation reveals the time for the lamb to be worshiped both in heaven and in Earth so the Angels should not only worship God but we who are here right now also must worship God that is it Hallelujah he says the seven seal book the world the kiss my redeemer oh my and from the eight verse through the 14th Angel worship Him Elders worshiped him living creatures worshiped him and John worship Him so much till he said every creature in heaven and in Earth underneath the Earth heard me saying blessed Glory power wisdom might be to the lamb he said that worship time for the king oh praise be in the name of our God the worship time for the John was praising God and there was only one reason why he praised God the prophet says that that book that was in the hand of the one that started the truth with seven things when John saw it he realized that there is something in that book for him but nobody was ready to open that book nobody was worthy to even take that book so don't have to cry oh you can imagine that you are losing your precious something Ma you begin to cry you get the shirt tears because of your love for it he cried and cried and cried until one of the others said that John why are you crying don't cry stop crying but I know you are crying because of that book by the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and he is coming to take the book and open the skills thereof so John came to look to see a lion he saw a land Hallelujah full of blood yeah and that was the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world for our freedom for our Redemption Hallelujah he was full of blood why was he full of blood because you could not take that book you cannot handle that book without blood in your hand the sin that happened in the Garden of Eden it was not the sin of Apple it was not blueberries neither was it blackberries it was not Peach it was sin of blood amen when a man and a woman meet It produced blood that was the sin that occurred in the garden so when God came down to see that thought he didn't use apple he didn't use peaches he didn't use blueberry that I lacked so much Hallelujah but you use blood of a lamp to cover it it couldn't take it away to cover it but then he needed the the righteous blood but Brown said that he needed the god what do you call it he said he need the blood of God amen that is what he was the lamb of God that was laid before the foundation of the world so the other called attention of John that John stop crying and look behind you [Music] [Applause] now that Lamb with blood has prevailed to the throne and with the blood in his hand he took the book Hallelujah he took the book and he opened the seal he opened a fair seal he opened the second seal he opened the 10th seal he opened the fourth seal he opened the fifth seal and then you opened the seventh seal oh my then all of a sudden John started to shout Hallelujah [Applause] the bible say that he shouted until the things in heaven the things on this Earth and at this beneath the Earth had done Shout what was he doing he was worshiping God he was praising God hallelujah because he have seen his name in the Redemption book Hallelujah God will contain your name you have your names in that book Hallelujah that is why nothing can deceive you oh brother I said nothing can deceive you you cannot even deceive yourself because your names are in the book oh brother my brother Hallelujah if you have your name in that book Rasta Shield that it is finished amen now when you if you come to the Book of Revelation uh let me read quickly also to compare notes do I have time chapter 20. and uh there's this number 12 perhaps let me see okay let me start from verse 11 and I saw a great white throne and if that sat on it from whom from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found so place I'm sorry and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great son before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life Hallelujah their books were opened and another book was open that book singular book well that book of redemption and you have your name in that book I have my name in that book John saw his name in that book but the other books the Bible says that the world were judged from the books Hallelujah so therefore it was not one book but many books yeah the world reject from those books by you and I we are judged from this book The Book of Life the Bible said that judgment must first begin in the house of God and that is exactly what we are doing right now amen what are the books if you go if you go to the prisons right now there are so many inmates over there that with various different kinds of of uh uh what we call it crimes but they are all over there some are seven one year some are 73 years some are even seven three months some life imprisonment some have been sentenced to death but when you come to look to their to their crimes they differ you understand those who went for robbery those who needed people and so many kinds of atrocities so when the Bible is talking about the books perhaps the book of fornicators the book of adulteress and adulteresses the book of drunkards the book of Madras the book of witchcraft the book of everything that the Bible speaks against there are many you say the unbelievers were judged out of those books but the Bride of Jesus Christ because you have your name in the book of righteousness Hallelujah your name is only mentioned in the Lamb's Book of Life so when John saw the name in it the bride or the wife of Jesus Christ's name in that book he shouted for joy and you are the wife of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so it is time for you to worship God right now this is the worship time [Applause] this is the time of worship oh brother Once Upon a Time we didn't have enough to mention the name of God Hallelujah we didn't have time to mention the name of God because of perhaps our character and because of the thing that we did and we were condemned you know there was nothing oh my then he come back he said you are my son come out I'm going to treat you like The Prodigal Son you remain at my son only you became Steve naked come and take your position now come and go to wash you and the Lord wash us I'm going to rob you and the Lord give us a garment he took our old chartered government and threw it away and he gave us a rub of righteousness today we must praise our God we must worship our God when I get happy like this I cannot keep quiet I sing and I shout and I know the devil don't like it but I don't want the devil to like it yeah oh Hallelujah amen can I continue a little and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy listen what a worship this was the elders the Beast everything fell right before him like that when he met his complete plan it is time of worship now brother sister the plan of God towards salvation is complete it's complete hallelujah it's complete God has finished his work and that is why he's calling us right now to come up now we don't no longer believe into this system no problems here and there is no hope in the world we are living the worldly politics to the world we are living unbelief to the world we are living with anything that stands against God in this world and we are going it is time of worship that prophets say that the complete man of God is finished it is worship time so you see a new head and he sang a new song saying to take the book and to open the sales thereof but that was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred thongs the people the Nations Hallelujah the green the white the black the yellow the brown all over the countries he has redeemed his people Hallelujah and thou has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth and that is the billion when we come we are going to take the possession of this world Hallelujah brother sister don't look far don't never look far because we are living in the rains or the regions of the rapture as we are saying the other day that look at what the Jews are doing right now on the Temple mount it presupposes that something is going to happen very soon amen we don't know what it's going to be but we know that Abomination that make it desolate standing in the Holy place it must go away and those two Prophets Moses and Elijah must appear to the Jews to preach the seals Hallelujah the message that revealed Jesus Christ to them that is what they are going to present but you and I before Joseph revealed himself to his Brethren the wife and the children were in the palace so this tells you that before those things will be you and I must be over there so now do you hear the sound of calling come up either come up hither amen and amen oh brother my sister he said how we love you how we praise you How We Worship You Lord myself here behind this sacred desk with my hands up today I worship thee my God I worship thee you are my healer my savior my king my provider you are my

complete amen amen like the prophet said we are only waiting for the last Blood member to take his position it is not today that God is working on him he has already finished Hallelujah but is it like we always say even when we are walking there are others who can work faster than others having to take notice of it oh yes you have people can they work faster and when we are going to race also that our people can run faster than others so perhaps some of us we have run faster than those who are yet to come so they are coming we are waiting for the last bride member but whether you come today or tomorrow let us continue to worship our God Hallelujah we are only working for them [Applause] let us raise our Victory Banner because Satan the devil and it's black flock have been chased out

is that if you don't have that Joy within and you sense that tug you sense that presence this is the very presence of God the very one you don't have to be afraid you can enter right in and say Lord I'm coming Lord yes I I want to come home Lord Jesus there's something about it that resonates in My Heart Lord God with you that presence Lord that's real he's the Living God I tell you I think the way that God brought all these things and I listened to that last little part there everything is just so rich but did you catch those little things how to me how that the prophet is pointing those things out when he says I praise you for my friends that's right Hallelujah you know he's talking about his brothers and sisters that's right that's what he's talking about God I praise you for that because to know that it is God that working and giving us brothers and sisters of Life precious Faith to fellowship with to be encouraged with Hallelujah I'll tell you brother and sister I know that when the the time here that struck our our family and there's been many others it's went on before this before we ever experienced it in this degree but I know this that Sunday after God had given me strength to stand here and to speak to you that Sunday and then as I was out there I just wanted to come out there and then to see the different brothers and sisters different ones making their way you know what I was receiving strength from my friends that's right amen oh yes sir I was receiving strength you said brother Sammy what was that to me as I was receiving the strength from them I was receiving strength from the Lord amen yes sir man amen absolutely yeah absolutely I was receiving strength from the Lord because that is my brother I'm part of that great Pillar of Fire all those within them and God is moving them and motivating them to minister to me within this time yes sir I believe that with all my heart thank God for the body of Jesus Christ amen amen thank God for a place that we can come Fellowship amen and hear the word of God that deals with our hearts and changes us yes aren't you thankful for that Calvary was not was not an act of condemnation it was condemning sin he was pointing out no longer to dwell from that condition I have come to loosen you and to set you free so the real message of Calvary is is you are free you must accept the liberty and throw down all of those instruments of the world and walk in his Liberty amen because he has given us the authority to walk free Hallelujah he has that sounding and blessed are the ears to hear that oh glory be done you realize what that sound does the beginning in the future weeks now amen that sounding has a power within it that you can cast those things down that once you were enslaved to glory be to God I've heard the Jubilee we have a right to be happy amen do we go through should we go through things in this Earth shall we go through things in this world absolutely but the things that were as the brother was speaking today is that how that God within the midst of our life we have a hope we have a blessed consolation that even in the midst of situations that we don't know how it's going to all come out you don't know how it's all going to come out but you know God provides faith for you to even stand where you're standing Hallelujah God's provided that Faith amen for you to even stand there and say you know what I don't know how it's going to work out but Lord I'm trusting you God provides Faith to stand in that measure amen yeah oh my friends we have so much to praise him for and you know what you know what I love about it is our praise and worship doesn't stop with a certain key on the piano it doesn't have to be a certain beat it doesn't have to be a certain certain uh tempo of a song you know our praise and worship is even in the conduct of our life amen there's a praise and a worship that goes up to the Lord the prophet told us in the Hebrew series he said you can come right next to someone he said and you testify even in this way you come up next to him and say and the Lord blessed us with a beautiful day he said that's testifying that's right amen true it's a wicked and a gross day but there is light in the midst of ghosts yes sir yeah amen over and over we are out to be the happiest people the scripture said happy is the people
