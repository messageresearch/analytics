[30:33] service Lord we're coming giving
[30:36] ourselves to you Lord that you may come
[30:39] and work or through the gift to be able
[30:41] to speak to the hearts lives of the
[30:44] people tonight we ask your God for your
[30:47] guidance part in for you to receive all
[30:49] glory in Jesus Christ name Amen
[30:52] [Music]
[31:02] I'd like to read tonight from first
[31:05] Thessalonians chapter 5 verses 1 through
[31:10] 11
[31:17] I like the title this as a thief in the
[31:19] night
[31:27] but of the times and seasons brethren we
[31:31] have no need that I write unto you for
[31:34] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[31:35] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[31:38] night for when they shall say peace and
[31:41] safety then sudden destruction cometh
[31:44] upon them as travail upon a woman with
[31:46] child and they shall not escape the ye
[31:50] brethren are not in darkness that the
[31:52] day should overtake you as a thief
[31:54] you're all children of the light and the
[31:58] children of the day we are not of the
[32:00] night nor of the darkness therefore let
[32:03] us not sleep as others do but let us
[32:05] watch and be sober for they that sleep
[32:08] sleep in the night they that be drunken
[32:10] are drunken in the night let us who are
[32:13] of the day be sober putting on the
[32:16] breastplate of faith and of love for in
[32:19] helmet the hope of salvation for God had
[32:22] not appointed unto us wrath but to
[32:24] obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[32:26] Christ who died for us that whether we
[32:30] wake or sleep we shall live together
[32:32] with him wherefore comfort ye yourselves
[32:37] together and edify one another even as
[32:39] also you do may be seated
[32:42] I at the graveside the other day I
[32:49] mentioned some things and definitions on
[32:52] them the word sleep and it's used here
[32:57] in the first 10 as where it says whether
[33:02] we wake or sleep and that word sleep
[33:05] there means to be absent from this body
[33:07] but in verse 6 it says therefore let us
[33:13] not sleep and that's a different greek
[33:17] word that's used there but it means to
[33:21] yield to sloth and sin to be indifferent
[33:23] to one salvation
[33:26] so it's even though the same words used
[33:29] in the English language is two separate
[33:32] words in the Greek we I mentioned the
[33:35] other day that as the scripture in the
[33:41] previous chapter of first Thessalonians
[33:43] 4 that it mentions about those that are
[33:48] asleep in Christ and we mentioned about
[33:54] when Jesus had came to wood - the man
[34:00] come to him ask him to come and pray for
[34:02] his daughter he said that she's dead and
[34:05] the word dead there means has come to an
[34:08] end
[34:09] and Jesus said she's not dead she has
[34:14] not come to an end but she sleepeth and
[34:19] he we I said we use the words in the
[34:24] scripture sleep and asleep and sleep
[34:26] with them and these words because when
[34:29] you die or if when you depart from this
[34:32] body you're not dead you're alive
[34:35] somewhere and we that believe this
[34:40] message is sent I'm message we have a
[34:43] revelation of that that many don't have
[34:46] we
[34:47] there are many if you talk to the
[34:50] nominal Christians as I have there's
[34:52] many of them that they have questions on
[34:55] what what where do you go when you die
[34:57] they they know heaven but they don't
[35:01] know what it's going to be like and and
[35:03] they wonder if they'll know each other
[35:05] or whether they'll know one another or
[35:08] know their their father mother or their
[35:11] husband or wife or or these things you
[35:13] know but we have a revelation in this
[35:17] end time and we understand that realm a
[35:20] little more than what those that are
[35:23] without the prophet can understand we
[35:27] know that there is a dimension that's
[35:31] beyond what brother Bentham called the
[35:33] curtain of time and in other words that
[35:36] dimensions not dependent on time
[35:39] and I was thinking today that how many
[35:44] years that brother branham's been gone
[35:46] and I thought but in the dimension where
[35:50] he's had there is no time it's they've
[35:54] already stepped into eternity but coming
[36:02] back to this verse six therefore let us
[36:06] not sleep as others do but let us watch
[36:09] and be sober there are people that you
[36:12] preach to you talk to and they seem to
[36:16] be indifferent about their own salvation
[36:19] they seem to be so wrapped up in
[36:22] whatever whatever pleasures of this
[36:25] world that they have succumbed to
[36:29] they're so wrapped up in that and so
[36:31] wrapped up in what this body can feel
[36:33] and what this human spirit how it makes
[36:36] it feel and you know how it works on
[36:39] their brain or whatever else that are so
[36:41] wrapped up in that that they totally lay
[36:44] aside their own salvation other Benham
[36:51] said the way people live today is like
[36:54] as if Jesus is going to send them angels
[36:57] down to broadcast when he's coming and
[37:00] it'll be put in the local newspapers and
[37:03] on the news so that they'll have time to
[37:05] get ready but the thing is the Bible
[37:09] says he comes as a thief in the night
[37:11] and it's a it's a secret catching away
[37:17] I've seen pictures of graves split open
[37:21] planes crashing cars crashing always
[37:23] that doesn't sound very secret but the
[37:27] Bible says this is going to be as a
[37:28] thief in the night it's a secret come
[37:31] brother Branham said it's a secret
[37:33] catching away
[37:39] second Timothy chapter four
[37:47] someone bring me the water
[37:53] second Timothy chapter four verse eight
[37:57] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[37:59] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[38:02] the righteous judge shall give me at
[38:04] that day and not only not to me only but
[38:07] to all them that love his appearing I'm
[38:12] looking forward to the appearing of
[38:14] Jesus I'm looking forward to that day
[38:17] when he shall appear and we'll be caught
[38:20] up to meet him in the sky amen
[38:24] but you talk to sometimes two different
[38:27] people and when you mention to them
[38:30] about the coming of the Lord of the
[38:33] Lord's appearing they they look on it as
[38:36] a horrible thing you mean the world's
[38:37] coming to an end
[38:38] they don't want to hear about the world
[38:40] coming to an end to them that's a it's a
[38:43] horrible thing and I say tonight that in
[38:48] your heart if it's something that when
[38:51] we talk about the coming of the Lord if
[38:53] it's something that scares you then the
[38:56] thing is you're not ready if you're
[39:01] ready to go there's nothing scary about
[39:03] the coming of the Lord we look forward
[39:11] to his appearing
[39:21] those people are just living for the
[39:23] present day you're living from day to
[39:27] day just for the present life I remember
[39:32] brother branham talking about these
[39:34] different celebrities and so on that
[39:37] have all these mansions and all those
[39:39] things and everything and he said don't
[39:42] look at that he said they're having
[39:44] their millennium now but ours is yet to
[39:48] come and it's going a man and it's going
[39:51] to be a wonderful time of peace a man
[39:55] there's not going to be any worry and
[39:57] you know I say this today they've got it
[40:01] all over the news about this virus and
[40:03] all these things I'm not worried about
[40:05] that because the Bible says the plague
[40:09] shall not come nigh thee those plagues
[40:13] aren't for me they're for this world
[40:17] because they have rejected the Word of
[40:20] God the plagues never hit Goshen but it
[40:28] hit Egypt 1st Corinthians chapter 15
[40:39] verse 51 behold I show you a mystery we
[40:46] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[40:50] changed amen
[40:53] we shall not all be separated from this
[40:56] body there will be some that are those
[41:00] that are alive and remain as the
[41:02] scripture in 1st Thessalonians chapter 4
[41:05] says and but though were in this body
[41:10] they come back a man in a different body
[41:13] we are changed we're all changed and it
[41:18] said in a moment in a twinkling of an
[41:21] eye at the last Trump for the Trump side
[41:24] and the dead shall be raised
[41:27] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[41:30] for this corruptible must
[41:33] on incorruption this mortal must put on
[41:36] immortality so when this corruptible
[41:39] shall have put on incorruption and this
[41:41] mortal shall put on immortality then
[41:44] shall be brought to pass the saying that
[41:46] is written death is swallowed up in
[41:48] victory
[41:49] bow death where is thy sting o grave
[41:52] where is thy victory in the Old
[41:55] Testament Satan thought he had victory
[41:58] in death because the price of redemption
[42:02] had not yet been paid the blood of bulls
[42:06] and goats could not accomplish that and
[42:09] so and this is where the Catholics I
[42:13] believe would get their doctrine of
[42:16] purgatory is because there was a place
[42:19] called paradise where they were they
[42:23] were held captive the Bible says because
[42:27] the price of redemption had been paid
[42:29] but once Christ died then spilled his
[42:34] blood then he paid for their Redemption
[42:37] and that's why he had the authority to
[42:40] go into paradise and set them free he
[42:45] had the authority he already had the
[42:48] power but he needed the authority and he
[42:52] got the authority by shedding his blood
[42:55] giving his life a man he paid a debt he
[43:02] didn't know I ordered that I couldn't
[43:05] pay I needed someone to wash my sins
[43:09] away amen now I sing a brand new song
[43:13] Amen what is it
[43:15] Amazing Grace
[43:18] a man that can reach down and touch and
[43:23] pull up a sinner such as eyes amazing
[43:27] grades that out of families that never
[43:34] heard the word you to find their be one
[43:37] or two or or whatever they come out of
[43:39] that family that God opened up the truth
[43:42] to election you here tonight because God
[43:52] selection or the venom said this is how
[43:58] quick the rapture will take place
[44:01] because it'll be in a moment of
[44:03] twinkling of an eye he said just try to
[44:06] time how long it'll take your ID to
[44:08] twinkle that's just how quick the
[44:11] rapture of the church will take place I
[44:17] remember when I was a just a young
[44:21] teenager and I wasn't I didn't have my
[44:25] life dedicated to the Lord
[44:27] I used to if I couldn't find my mom I
[44:30] get scared maybe the rapture took place
[44:32] and I got left
[44:36] but if you have that fear it means you
[44:41] need to get ready this is the only
[44:47] morning you're ever going to get is
[44:49] right now on this side that he's coming
[44:53] there's not going to be a warning 30
[44:56] days out that because the Bible says no
[45:03] man knoweth the day nor the hour that
[45:06] the son of man cometh but you should
[45:10] watch and be ready live every day like
[45:14] his coming the next moment you know in
[45:25] when Pearl Harbor was attacked you know
[45:30] that they tried to portray this being
[45:34] like it was a surprise
[45:37] but they had already been warned that
[45:41] the Japanese fleet was coming together
[45:46] and was drawing near but they ignored
[45:50] the warning they they didn't believe it
[45:56] brother Branham talks about how they had
[45:59] a big shindig the night before a big
[46:03] party and highly celebrated and all that
[46:06] you know and and then by the next
[46:11] morning he said those that were supposed
[46:13] to be on watch
[46:14] they've been out partying and they were
[46:16] asleep on the job and so when the attack
[46:20] come they weren't able to give out
[46:22] warning then because it was too late
[46:25] they were found asleep and brother
[46:27] Branham says that's the problem with a
[46:29] lot of churches they're going to be
[46:31] found to sleep on that day they're going
[46:34] to be found in a sleep of not really
[46:37] concerned about their own salvation they
[46:40] say they are but the way they lived
[46:43] shows you they're not and it'll be too
[46:48] late to cry out there we had a storm
[46:54] several storms down in Middle Tennessee
[46:58] here recently there's supposed to be
[47:00] storming tonight again
[47:03] but in that storm over on the north side
[47:06] of the city I lived in there was balls
[47:11] of hail that fell down out of the sky
[47:14] and they were about the size of a
[47:17] softball and my daughter that lives over
[47:22] in that area her and her husband got one
[47:25] and took a pitcher oh it's a week and
[47:27] held in his hand so we can see the size
[47:29] of it
[47:31] and I thought one day they're going away
[47:35] a hundred pounds falling out of the sky
[47:37] and you know when that begins to happen
[47:42] it's too late there's there's no time
[47:49] then
[47:55] you know in the Bible speaks about a
[47:59] rich man who had plenty of wealth he was
[48:07] clothed in fine linen and he lived very
[48:12] wealthy and it speaks of a beggar that
[48:16] sent in his gate begging by the name of
[48:19] Lazarus
[48:22] and he ignored that man he ignored that
[48:27] beggar
[48:29] then a time come both of them died
[48:31] passed from this life
[48:34] and the Bible says the rich man in hail
[48:37] lifted up his eyes being in torment and
[48:41] he said these flames are tormenting me
[48:46] he said have Lazarus because he saw him
[48:50] in the bosom of Abraham said have
[48:52] Lazarus dipped his hand in water and
[48:54] touch my lips because I'm being
[48:56] tormented in these flames never Adam
[49:00] said he likened him to the rich young
[49:03] ruler and said he had his opportunity he
[49:08] was given opportunity he had a desire he
[49:13] was looking and he wanted eternal life
[49:18] but he was more concerned with this
[49:22] wealth and couldn't let go of it
[49:25] he made his investments brother branham
[49:28] said down here on the earth instead of
[49:31] making his investments over there on the
[49:34] other side beyond the curtain of time
[49:36] and so when he come payday he got his
[49:42] payoff of what he had done in this life
[49:46] and that's why it said in hell he lifted
[49:50] up his eyes and remember he said said
[49:53] send somebody back I got five brothers
[49:56] since send Lazarus back from the dead
[49:59] the don't tell my brothers that they'll
[50:02] change their ways and not come to this
[50:04] place
[50:08] and the Lord said let he has Moses and
[50:14] the prophets let them hear them and he
[50:17] said but if one comes back from the dead
[50:20] they'll hear him and he said no if they
[50:25] wouldn't hear Moses and the prophets and
[50:27] they won't hear one though he comes back
[50:29] from the dead but he streamed out he did
[50:32] he said don't let my brother's come to
[50:35] this place of torment and I say tonight
[50:37] that's not where you want to go that's
[50:42] not where you want your life to end up
[50:48] say well you're trying to scare us
[50:52] the Bible says in Jude 22 and 23 it says
[50:57] then if some have compassion making a
[50:59] difference on others save with fear
[51:01] pulling them out of the fire so if I can
[51:05] save you with fear it's alright
[51:07] it's scriptural
[51:14] it's not enough to join church brother
[51:21] branham said that rich young ruler was a
[51:25] churchgoer
[51:26] he said he kept the commandments from
[51:30] his youth and he said he still wanted to
[51:35] hold his profession when he was in hell
[51:37] because he called Abraham's father
[51:44] brother M said he might have had a grand
[51:47] funeral but it had some dignitary to
[51:50] speak for his funeral he had maybe the
[51:53] the best of the other town to be his
[51:57] pallbearers
[51:59] but in hell he lifted up his eyes
[52:08] James 5 19 20 brethren if any of you do
[52:14] err from the truth and one convert him
[52:16] let him know that he would convert the
[52:19] center from the air his ways shall save
[52:22] a soul from death and this word death
[52:25] here means the miserable state of the
[52:27] wicked dead in hell
[52:30] and shall hide a multitude of sins
[52:34] pardon me
[52:44] you know we're living in a time over the
[52:50] last days the Bible give us a prediction
[52:57] of what the last days would be a
[52:59] prophecy a promise of what the last days
[53:01] I would be he will be heady highminded
[53:04] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[53:07] God
[53:10] said there'd be Janney's and Jam breeze
[53:13] raise up
[53:15] and there's a spirit of the last day
[53:19] that's on the people
[53:24] there's an anointing on the people in
[53:27] this last day there's two anointings one
[53:32] is from God the other is from Hell and
[53:39] the spirit of this last day you watch it
[53:43] work in politics and watch it work in
[53:47] the world watch it work within our laws
[53:53] it's this evil spirit of the last day to
[53:59] where it's it's making it to where if
[54:02] you say anything against you know gays
[54:04] or whatever why your hate speech that's
[54:11] that's that's hate Haiti
[54:15] but the Bible clearly declares that that
[54:18] is an abomination in the eyes of God and
[54:22] yet we see it gaining preeminence in the
[54:28] world and they're passing laws to make
[54:33] it legal and they're passing laws to
[54:37] make it against the law for you to say
[54:40] anything or not accept them into your
[54:43] myths
[54:46] some of these laws I speak of have
[54:49] already been passed out in the state of
[54:51] California
[54:53] it's the spirit of the last days brother
[54:57] Adam said if God doesn't judge this
[55:00] nation for that type of sin then he'll
[55:04] have to raise up sodom and gomorrah and
[55:07] apologize to him because that's what he
[55:10] destroyed him for it takes more than
[55:21] just hearing a good message from your
[55:23] pastor oh you can say all that was good
[55:27] brother Sam I really enjoyed that but
[55:30] did you take it to heart are you willing
[55:37] to become one with what was sad because
[55:42] as the Bride of Christ we're supposed to
[55:44] take the book and eat the book become
[55:48] one with it in other words and the Bible
[55:51] said that he would write his laws upon
[55:53] the tables of our hearts that is not
[55:58] just carried in a book bound one leather
[56:00] but it's carried him behind a veil of
[56:04] clash revelations 19 and seven says
[56:13] speaking about the Bride of Christ said
[56:16] she has made herself ready we've got to
[56:22] make ourselves ready sure God uses the
[56:26] pastor to get his church ready God uses
[56:31] the songs to get his church ready
[56:34] and God uses you to get the church ready
[56:40] and you know brother madam said if our
[56:45] pastor didn't seem to be doing right why
[56:48] would get us a new pastor and if the
[56:51] song service wasn't going just right
[56:53] well we'd say we need a new song leader
[56:55] he said but what about you as an
[56:58] individual how does your life tally up
[57:00] what are you doing to get ready amen
[57:06] God can use the past brother madam said
[57:10] the pastor words were deigned of God to
[57:13] see you through to the rapture
[57:18] God can use the pastor as long as people
[57:21] will listen and yield to what said
[57:29] sometimes we got to preach the same
[57:31] messages over again slap another title
[57:35] on there because they didn't get it the
[57:37] first time sometimes we got to no matter
[57:43] what the title is no matter what the
[57:45] text is seems like we keep dealing with
[57:47] some of the same things it's because
[57:50] God's trying to get you straight now
[57:52] God's trying to get his church ready
[57:59] and I always tell my church I said
[58:01] there's you know you might as well get
[58:03] used to one another because you're not
[58:06] going to have your own little corner in
[58:08] heaven we're all going to be together
[58:12] we're going to be together during the
[58:14] Millennium we're going to live together
[58:15] eternally so you might as well get used
[58:21] to one another now amen
[58:32] but LeBron said don't make a mistake
[58:36] that that rich young ruler made he said
[58:41] Lazarus laid his gate as a beggar but he
[58:45] said when the rich man was in hell he
[58:48] became a beggar and he was begging that
[58:51] he would just let his lips be touched
[58:55] with water
[58:57] where the BAM said you're going to beg
[58:59] some time or other everyone he said so
[59:04] why not beg God for His forgiveness now
[59:08] why not beg God
[59:12] he said to get all the starch in all the
[59:16] world out beg for mercy if you don't
[59:20] you'll end up like the rich young ruler
[59:34] the Bible says that Jesus spoke and said
[59:40] besides all this there's a great gulf
[59:43] fixed
[59:45] between me and these talking about the
[59:48] rich men in hell he says no man can
[59:52] cross that gulf either direction
[59:58] around said there is no repentance after
[1:00:02] death the time of repentance is now the
[1:00:09] time to get ready is now once you leave
[1:00:14] here you leave this body you're gonna
[1:00:17] raise back up the way you went down
[1:00:20] death doesn't change you if you go down
[1:00:25] righteous you'll come up righteous but
[1:00:29] if you go down unrighteous that's the
[1:00:31] way you'll come up and don't depend on
[1:00:34] your own righteousness because the Bible
[1:00:36] says that that is filthy rags in the
[1:00:39] eyes of God that was the problem that
[1:00:43] Paul had were talking with the Jews was
[1:00:45] the Jews had made their own
[1:00:47] righteousness
[1:00:50] there's some people that make their own
[1:00:52] righteousness by saying well I'm not as
[1:00:54] bad as that guy
[1:00:59] God doesn't have a scale or arms of sin
[1:01:07] sin is sin there's not a scale on lies
[1:01:19] the brother branham said the devil just
[1:01:24] twisted God's Word just a little bit to
[1:01:27] tell Eve a lie
[1:01:29] just one thing he said made the whole
[1:01:34] thing alive
[1:01:46] you know you were you were born with a
[1:01:51] thirst in your life
[1:01:55] david says as the heart panna that
[1:01:58] through the water Brooks soap in my
[1:01:59] heart after the Oh God
[1:02:02] as the deer pants for the water room
[1:02:08] brother right I'm gonna talk about being
[1:02:11] a hunter
[1:02:12] said you know the deer has been shot if
[1:02:15] he can get to the water brook why I can
[1:02:18] revive within seconds
[1:02:22] and he says that the hounds may be fast
[1:02:26] on his heels but if he can make it to
[1:02:29] the water he'll survive
[1:02:34] and that's what we need tonight
[1:02:37] we need to be like David there's no way
[1:02:41] I can survive without making it to
[1:02:43] Christ the living water of life
[1:02:52] he says the hounds are on the heels of
[1:02:55] every individual
[1:02:58] so you need to make it to the water
[1:03:01] Brook
[1:03:09] people say I don't want to go to hell
[1:03:15] but they're not yelling willing to yield
[1:03:18] themselves to Christ say I surrender at
[1:03:21] all
[1:03:31] come to the source of life
[1:03:43] there's a secret coming of the Lord
[1:03:47] we're waiting for it with anticipation
[1:03:51] because there's something in the air
[1:03:56] we've heard amen and you know I say this
[1:04:02] with all humility I mentioned earlier
[1:04:06] about those that are in the message have
[1:04:10] this revelation of the beyond more than
[1:04:13] anyone else
[1:04:15] you that have ever heard brother
[1:04:16] Browning's testimony you have a second
[1:04:22] look and what was beyond the curtain of
[1:04:26] time
[1:04:30] I believe their greeting I believe
[1:04:34] there's a greeting party waiting when
[1:04:38] someone crosses over and you know I
[1:04:44] think about when hope Branham was dying
[1:04:51] and you know she had two children two
[1:04:58] babies
[1:05:04] but when brother branham called her back
[1:05:06] she said why did you call me back
[1:05:09] she had a husband and children she
[1:05:13] didn't want to come back to this side
[1:05:15] after seeing the other so why did you
[1:05:19] call me back you know she loved her
[1:05:24] husband you know she loved her children
[1:05:27] but friends there's a love on that other
[1:05:29] side that goes beyond this filial love
[1:05:31] that's here filial love can get you into
[1:05:38] trouble oh but I got the love is pure
[1:05:43] amen hallelujah
[1:05:46] I've seen people hinder their children
[1:05:50] hinder the work of the Lord in their
[1:05:52] lives because of their filial love but
[1:05:56] if you're gonna Doppel of them you'll
[1:05:58] let God do whatever it takes to get them
[1:06:01] ready
[1:06:07] the Bible says be ready when such an
[1:06:11] hour's you think not the Son of man
[1:06:13] cometh
[1:06:17] all that don't go in Christ will come
[1:06:24] under the God's wrath and judgment
[1:06:31] please don't let that happen to you
[1:06:33] I don't want his judgment I don't I
[1:06:37] don't want justice I want mercy amen
[1:06:42] I want the mercies of God
[1:06:51] I'm not making a contingency plan for if
[1:06:58] I miss the rapture I'm setting my mind
[1:07:02] on making no contingency plan I want to
[1:07:11] go I want to be ready I want to make it
[1:07:14] I want to be there with all my brothers
[1:07:18] and sisters that I fellowship with in
[1:07:21] this life amen
[1:07:25] what a wonderful time that's gonna be
[1:07:30] the day of resurrection it's gonna be
[1:07:34] such a wonderful day I don't want to
[1:07:41] miss it
[1:07:45] hallelujah
[1:07:49] and I like that body changed too
[1:07:58] this over stinking rotten house I'm
[1:08:02] living in subject to diseases and
[1:08:05] sicknesses and so forth them things we
[1:08:09] have to deal with brother ma'am said
[1:08:13] sometimes people are crippled up with
[1:08:15] all these things in their spirit were
[1:08:17] crippled up because they've got cancer
[1:08:20] or they've got this disease or that
[1:08:22] other disease but God is here to bring
[1:08:25] deliverance he is a healer the Bible
[1:08:31] says he's the LORD thy God that healeth
[1:08:33] all thy diseases that didn't leave any
[1:08:37] out but I've witnessed strange things
[1:08:43] before
[1:08:45] I prayed for an individual one time the
[1:08:49] head cancer
[1:08:51] they had just started coming to church
[1:08:53] maybe they started coming because they

[1:20:52] by grace salvation
[1:20:58] slowly
[1:21:02] every
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:06] you know brother journey as he was
[1:21:08] ministering tonight my you know I can
[1:21:12] remember what it was like to set in
[1:21:15] services before the Lord really got
[1:21:19] ahold of my life and you know when we
[1:21:21] talk about that of getting ahold of our
[1:21:23] life you know the reality is just like
[1:21:27] what was spoke through the scriptures
[1:21:29] today God doesn't come down and take us
[1:21:33] by the shirt collar and drag us up to
[1:21:35] the altar because that would be God
[1:21:38] using force to get us to him but God's a
[1:21:43] gentleman he wants us to yield to his
[1:21:48] love that's being expressed he wants a
[1:21:51] heart that's yielded to him now there's
[1:21:53] things that God sometimes will do
[1:21:55] because of his love that he will not
[1:21:58] lose one that you have to get their
[1:22:00] attention in some way God will not lose
[1:22:03] one but what a what a what a thing to
[1:22:07] wear sometimes as I was saying I
[1:22:10] remember in years where my goodness
[1:22:13] there was something quite services I
[1:22:15] would set in fear would strike my heart
[1:22:18] I'd be afraid I'd look at those services
[1:22:22] and I thought many moments the Lord's
[1:22:24] gonna come and it's it's just hearing I
[1:22:26] remember those days but you know God
[1:22:30] made a provision because even in that
[1:22:33] God doesn't want us coming out of fear
[1:22:36] but he wants us even as it was said here
[1:22:39] tonight that we're aware there can be a
[1:22:41] yielding to him and say Lord I want to
[1:22:45] be ready now there's not one of us here
[1:22:48] that could make ourselves ready you
[1:22:51] realize that what a person anyone could
[1:22:53] come to this altar you could be in your
[1:22:55] seat and if there's one speck aspect
[1:22:59] that is as tiny as even the hair on one
[1:23:01] of my fingers
[1:23:01] if there's one speck that's not
[1:23:03] surrendered in that life it's not a
[1:23:05] total surrender
[1:23:07] but God draws us and he comes to bring
[1:23:11] us even to a place of total surrender
[1:23:14] then when it's total surrender then he
[1:23:16] moves down to complete that work that he
[1:23:20] started God fulfills every word can you
[1:23:24] say man what God promised in his word
[1:23:26] when God made the promise repent and be
[1:23:29] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:23:31] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:23:33] Ghost that is certain every promise of
[1:23:36] God is certain
[1:23:37] so there is nothing that could ever be
[1:23:40] wrong with God's promises there was
[1:23:42] anything at all wrong I would say lord
[1:23:45] help me to see whatever it is that's
[1:23:48] hindering me from having having the
[1:23:50] promise portion that belongs to me
[1:23:54] because that is our allotted portion
[1:23:56] that's what the Holy Ghost is it's God's
[1:23:59] life amen that deposit that's placed
[1:24:02] within us it brings a full complete
[1:24:05] change and you know how it is I could
[1:24:10] never understand stand that I couldn't
[1:24:11] understand what it is that made a mom
[1:24:14] and daddy what it wasn't made him do how
[1:24:17] in the world could they they they they
[1:24:19] did what they did I thought surely
[1:24:22] they're they're neglecting themselves
[1:24:24] but you know what it was there were
[1:24:25] desires that I had within me because of
[1:24:27] an old man because of that old sin
[1:24:30] nature that was still there but all it
[1:24:33] takes all it took was God coming and
[1:24:36] drawing upon that into where that the
[1:24:38] focus became upon Jesus Christ and
[1:24:42] everything else there ain't nothing else
[1:24:44] that mattered nothing else mattered no
[1:24:48] friends mattered no pleasure mattered
[1:24:50] nothing else mattered
[1:24:52] when it got to that point right there
[1:24:55] God bringing me to that point where I
[1:24:58] didn't want nothing else I only wanted
[1:25:02] to be saved then that's what God come he
[1:25:08] started to work in my life and you know
[1:25:11] what he's completed it and yet he's
[1:25:13] still working on me I believe with all
[1:25:17] my heart these are things that we know
[1:25:20] we're living in a time we see here right
[1:25:22] now and I'll tell you I said this to the
[1:25:25] family the other night and we were
[1:25:26] together even at the dinner and then
[1:25:27] again at devotion I said you see the way
[1:25:29] people are acting right now people are
[1:25:32] fearful you say brother salmon ain't you
[1:25:35] afraid no I'm really not afraid I've got
[1:25:40] rest you say what happens if you get the
[1:25:43] revived iris I've got promises I got
[1:25:46] promises that doesn't mean I'm gonna be
[1:25:48] ignorant with things I mean I always
[1:25:50] wash my hands if you don't wash your
[1:25:52] hands you need to start I mean you know
[1:25:56] but but you know what I'm 44 years old
[1:25:58] and a long time I've lived a long time
[1:26:00] before they ever had hand sanitizer I
[1:26:04] lived a long time before they ever had
[1:26:06] Purell right whites think about right
[1:26:11] now what's it gonna be I'm glad I don't
[1:26:14] have to entertain that thought what it's
[1:26:16] gonna be when the tribulation strikes
[1:26:19] because right now the Spirit of God
[1:26:21] because the people of God are still upon
[1:26:23] this earth it's held intact but as soon
[1:26:26] as you take out in rapture it all turns
[1:26:28] loose and you this right here these
[1:26:33] little things like this they're doing
[1:26:35] they don't know how to control but you
[1:26:37] know why that virus it ain't something
[1:26:39] in a petri dish we're talking about a
[1:26:41] demon when we talk about a flu and they
[1:26:45] create a vaccine and they try to take
[1:26:47] care of this one we're talking about
[1:26:48] spirits those are spirits that mutate in
[1:26:53] those things that take place right there
[1:26:55] but we have a promise God made promise
[1:27:02] after promise he said I will put none of
[1:27:04] the diseases upon you that I put up on
[1:27:07] Egypt walk in my word said I'm the Lord
[1:27:11] that he'll
[1:27:12] I think God for a piece and this is what
[1:27:16] the this is what the Holy Spirit brought
[1:27:18] to us tonight if you don't have that
[1:27:20] piece don't leave out of here tonight
