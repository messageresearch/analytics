[53:13] we give ourselves to you we give you
[53:15] praise and things
[53:17] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:23] let's turn to John chapter 3 certainly
[53:30] appreciate that I don't know who put
[53:32] them up to that but that's one well
[53:34] preach on today my birthday that's what
[53:41] I'm gonna preach on my birthday today
[53:43] and preach on your birthday too
[53:53] this is the greatest birthday amen
[53:59] John chapter 3 verse 9
[54:05] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[54:08] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[54:13] came to Jesus by night and said unto him
[54:16] rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[54:19] come from God for no man can do these
[54:23] miracles that thou doest except God be
[54:28] with him now I want you to notice these
[54:30] things that he's pulling together thou
[54:32] art a teacher come from God he ties it
[54:35] together with no man can do these
[54:38] miracles that you're doing except God be
[54:42] with him hmm
[54:45] now watch how Jesus turns right through
[54:47] here and he lets him know this is the
[54:50] greatest miracle of all jesus answered
[54:54] and said unto Him verily verily I say
[54:56] unto thee except a man be born again he
[55:00] cannot see the kingdom of God we know
[55:04] that C is to is to understand him
[55:08] Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be
[55:10] born when he is old can he enter the
[55:13] second time into his mother's womb and
[55:15] be born jesus answered verily verily I
[55:19] say unto thee except a man be born of
[55:23] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[55:25] into the kingdom of God
[55:28] notice right there in verse 4 Nicodemus
[55:31] serious the Lord Jesus is speaking
[55:33] but Nicodemus is confined to earthly
[55:37] thinking how can a man enter back in to
[55:42] his mother's womb a second time even if
[55:45] a man could do that it would only
[55:47] produce the same birth that's already
[55:50] condemned that's all it would do it'd be
[55:55] the same thing all over again Jesus is
[55:58] not talking about the same thing all
[56:00] over again he's talking about a
[56:02] different birth except a man be born of
[56:07] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[56:10] into the kingdom of God so must be born
[56:13] of the water of the spirits I'm talking
[56:15] about the pool of water he's talking
[56:18] about the word God sends his word and
[56:22] the word that he sends the Spirit of God
[56:24] travels through that word to get a hold
[56:27] of the lives of the elect of God and to
[56:30] bring birth to their life notice how
[56:33] Paul said it so precisely he speaks of
[56:36] how that after you heard the word of
[56:38] truth the gospel of your salvation see
[56:43] every age has had the gospel preached to
[56:46] them and it has been peculiar to that
[56:49] generation always always identifying the
[56:53] true atonement you with me but it is the
[56:57] word that's coming and the Spirit coming
[56:59] through there to bring life verse 7
[57:04] Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must
[57:07] be born again the wind bloweth where it
[57:12] listeth now look at this mystery I
[57:14] probably won't deal so much with this
[57:16] scripture today but verse 8 the wind
[57:19] bloweth where it listeth and thou
[57:21] hearest the sound thereof but canst not
[57:24] tell whence it cometh and whither it
[57:26] goeth so is every one that is born of
[57:30] the Spirit being born of the Spirit of
[57:34] God it is not something that you can
[57:37] explain it's a paradox it's the greatest
[57:42] miracle
[57:44] the greatest miracle it's something that
[57:48] not a church could do not a man could do
[57:51] it only Christ Himself can bring this
[57:55] birth about and it is a paradox one
[57:59] thing that is the same among every child
[58:02] of God is that there is an experience
[58:08] that is true to the word and they just
[58:11] let me just capitalize this on just a
[58:13] moment your experience as far as what
[58:17] you recall and how things transpired
[58:19] when God did the final work in your life
[58:22] might be different than how it was for
[58:25] me but there is one thing that is the
[58:28] same it's the same father doing the same
[58:31] experience so it'll produce the same
[58:33] life and the same fruit and the same
[58:36] works that's what is important wish I
[58:43] had time just to labor I don't have time
[58:45] to labor on that today maybe we can just
[58:46] have an evening service today
[58:50] y'all mind that at all okay we'll do it
[58:54] then after all this is my birthday right
[58:59] [Laughter]
[59:05] Nicodemus answered and said unto him how
[59:09] can these things be jesus answered and
[59:14] said unto Him art thou a master of
[59:16] Israel and knowest not these things
[59:19] aren't you glad it doesn't take great
[59:22] learning to understand this
[59:24] it only takes a willing heart it's all
[59:27] it takes amen may God bless you and
[59:31] bless the word as you're being seated
[59:35] this portion of scripture that we just
[59:38] read no doubt to many of us are very
[59:41] familiar passage of Scripture and yet
[59:46] here is the it's a promise of the coming
[59:50] of the holy spirit that the Old
[59:54] Testament Saints and all of those who
[59:57] were looking down through time that were
[1:00:01] moved upon by the Spirit of God as the
[1:00:04] elect of God to worship God in the gate
[1:00:10] where he chose to place his name they
[1:00:13] were looking forward to two things in
[1:00:16] their day and those two things they were
[1:00:18] looking forward to was the coming of the
[1:00:21] Messiah but then in the coming of the
[1:00:23] Messiah of how that then the Spirit of
[1:00:27] God would visit not just to visit but
[1:00:31] would come and be poured out so they
[1:00:35] were looking they were looking forward
[1:00:36] to this and they had glimpses of it
[1:00:38] there there was glimpses of it that that
[1:00:40] would cause them to look with
[1:00:43] anticipation for what is coming it's
[1:00:46] just like what has repeated down through
[1:00:49] the Gentile Ages where you had those
[1:00:51] that have gone on before us they knew
[1:00:54] there was a day coming they were looking
[1:00:57] forward to that day they they worked
[1:00:59] with the strength and the enlightenment
[1:01:02] of the gospel of what God had done and
[1:01:05] was doing in their life and they
[1:01:07] fulfilled their part of the race yet we
[1:01:11] find that in this part of the scripture
[1:01:13] here that this is the very first time
[1:01:15] that within the scripture that we're the
[1:01:19] new birth is not just set forth in a
[1:01:21] type but it's it's it's mentioned the
[1:01:24] very not just mentioning but here this
[1:01:28] very essential doctrine which is the
[1:01:31] very basis it's the most important
[1:01:33] doctrine this is this is more than just
[1:01:37] a doctrine this is the life because
[1:01:39] without this the everything else doesn't
[1:01:42] matter but when we look at it the life
[1:01:47] itself there had been a
[1:01:48] types that was laid down in the
[1:01:50] scripture of the new birth and we we see
[1:01:53] that we dealt with that quite a bit here
[1:01:55] on you see the new birth beginning in
[1:01:57] Genesis 1 God even lays out that plan of
[1:02:00] redemption so it's all been laid out in
[1:02:02] tight all the way through the scriptures
[1:02:06] many different places but now the Lord
[1:02:09] Jesus makes this this declaration in
[1:02:12] this time that it's necessary that one
[1:02:15] must be born again and we know that that
[1:02:18] that that new birth is not just it's not
[1:02:21] just the same old life repackaged you
[1:02:25] know what I mean it's like things you
[1:02:27] know your your your parents you know
[1:02:30] kind of play a trick on you and you know
[1:02:32] you they give you they get this present
[1:02:35] out there for Christmas or for your
[1:02:37] birthday and you're looking at that and
[1:02:38] the man I can't wear that it's gotta be
[1:02:39] a good one and you open it up and it's
[1:02:41] an old pair of socks so you're all
[1:02:44] excited about something and all it was
[1:02:46] the old pair of socks it's something you
[1:02:48] already had that's not what the new
[1:02:51] birth is it's not something that you
[1:02:54] already have it's what it's needed and
[1:02:58] only he can give it so it is not a
[1:03:02] repackaging but it's a remaking it is a
[1:03:06] new creation in the same old temple got
[1:03:10] any worried about giving you beautiful
[1:03:12] wrapping you get the wrapping paper that
[1:03:14] matches the gift on the outside in the
[1:03:16] meantime he wants the gift on the inside
[1:03:19] that'll eventually lead this wrapping to
[1:03:22] the wrapping that he intended for it to
[1:03:23] have that's the paradox in itself is
[1:03:26] that here God has such a glorious gift
[1:03:28] inside of such wrapping paper that we
[1:03:32] might look at and say oh how could there
[1:03:35] ever come such and such out of Nazareth
[1:03:37] how could there ever come such and such
[1:03:40] hey listen friends you can apply that
[1:03:42] and put the name of your family tree and
[1:03:44] that's the very thing with every one of
[1:03:46] us
[1:03:46] how could there come any good out of
[1:03:49] that well as far as in the natural
[1:03:51] genetics there is nothing that would be
[1:03:54] good equal to that of God's own life but
[1:03:58] hidden beneath
[1:03:59] fault of that various gods choosing an
[1:04:02] election that he knows where each and
[1:04:05] every one of his children are now in the
[1:04:12] message questions and answers here in
[1:04:14] 1964 this is one of the only places I'm
[1:04:17] just gonna take my time a little bit and
[1:04:19] I hope that don't make you nervous but I
[1:04:20] want to make sure these things we drive
[1:04:22] them down when we're looking at this
[1:04:25] this quote I'm just going to touch it
[1:04:26] this to this morning but when we look at
[1:04:29] this here this is one of the the only
[1:04:31] places where brother vana will take the
[1:04:34] term kokuboro and who eat and describe
[1:04:37] it in this manner he says how can I take
[1:04:40] a cup o Burrell and make a grain of
[1:04:42] wheat out of it
[1:04:43] it's impossible for me to do it
[1:04:46] I no doubt I'm speaking maybe it's um to
[1:04:50] farmers and some expert gardeners and
[1:04:52] whatever more you don't plant a tomato
[1:04:54] seed and expect to get green beans now
[1:04:59] that's everybody can understand that the
[1:05:02] only way it can be is because inside
[1:05:05] that cockerel inside that Kaka bra
[1:05:08] inside that Tucker Burrell has been
[1:05:11] transmitted from a kookaburra to a germ
[1:05:15] called wheat life that's the only way so
[1:05:21] the change doesn't change the kokuboro
[1:05:23] it simply takes out cocklebur a life and
[1:05:27] injects wheat life you with me see when
[1:05:34] brother ran it without me going into
[1:05:36] many of these quotes let me just let me
[1:05:37] just refer to a few things that you see
[1:05:39] of wheat and a cockerel because all of
[1:05:42] us there is nothing when you look across
[1:05:44] the spectrum of humanity we all come of
[1:05:47] the same as far as one blood one nation
[1:05:50] so forth and so on we can go in and
[1:05:52] trace all these things on back but the
[1:05:54] reality of it is is that what is down
[1:05:56] there beneath the shell of a capybara is
[1:06:00] what makes a difference remember the
[1:06:04] days of the Lord Jesus he was looking at
[1:06:06] some good-looking cockle burrows then
[1:06:09] guys kept the law perfectly but what he
[1:06:12] say
[1:06:13] you're of your father the devil so he's
[1:06:16] looking at a different what a life on
[1:06:18] the inside he's not ready what did he
[1:06:20] tell them he let him know you you do not
[1:06:22] have righteous judgment you're judging
[1:06:24] what's on the outside wife cuz that's
[1:06:26] the only thing they knew Jesus is trying
[1:06:29] to take them to a deeper life a deeper
[1:06:31] meaning then it's not you don't know
[1:06:33] somebody by the outside you know about
[1:06:36] who they are on the inside and who you
[1:06:38] are on the inside will come out to the
[1:06:40] outside
[1:06:41] that's what Jesus looking at him and
[1:06:43] said you are whited Sepulcher who it was
[1:06:47] dirty to touch a dead man come on
[1:06:50] somebody
[1:06:51] they couldn't even come in the camp but
[1:06:52] he's letting them know you are filthy
[1:06:55] yet you couldn't put a finger on the
[1:06:58] kokuboro oh but the inside was not that
[1:07:04] of Widger why because it could not
[1:07:08] recognize the visitation of God in that
[1:07:13] day oh my so it has to be transmitted
[1:07:19] from a cocklebur to a germ called wheat
[1:07:23] life that is just so precious in it it
[1:07:25] has to be as a brother Ram picks it up
[1:07:27] in 1965 trying to do God a service he
[1:07:30] picks up this cooker bro and weed again
[1:07:32] and he says I notice he says as the same
[1:07:35] thing we've said throughout the kokuboro
[1:07:37] and we both can rejoice in the same rain
[1:07:39] he said but it's what's down there on
[1:07:41] beneath is the soul kokuboro so see now
[1:07:45] we're looking at the nature because as
[1:07:48] far as on the outside we're all kokuboro
[1:07:53] hmm it's the live now notice this this
[1:07:57] word let me just deal with this word
[1:07:59] transmitted a little bit this word
[1:08:01] transmitted means caused something to
[1:08:04] pass from one place or person to another
[1:08:07] so to cause something to pass from one
[1:08:10] place or person to another so it's got
[1:08:13] to be transmitted from kokuboro to a
[1:08:16] germ called wheat life now you know a
[1:08:18] mode of transmission is like even in
[1:08:20] diseases and things like that you got to
[1:08:21] come in contact where it's at right you
[1:08:25] got to be there where
[1:08:26] where the diseases are at and so forth
[1:08:28] and then you know even how you know
[1:08:30] sometimes they're asking you before you
[1:08:32] go here and there get your shots and
[1:08:34] this and that and do all these things
[1:08:35] trying to do what build immunity man I
[1:08:41] can't even go there
[1:08:45] but God within within everything there
[1:08:50] is this this transmission because even
[1:08:53] like coming through this room right here
[1:08:55] Here I am I'm wearing a belt pack
[1:08:56] there's no wires that's attached to this
[1:08:59] sound system right here but yet what is
[1:09:01] taking place in this microphone there is
[1:09:04] a signal being sent from this belt pack
[1:09:06] to that receiver process through wires
[1:09:09] and it's coming out through all the
[1:09:11] signals and the things that's going over
[1:09:12] the internet and so forth you don't you
[1:09:14] don't see the signal you know when I
[1:09:16] step over here some of you don't all of
[1:09:17] a sudden on this side of the church go
[1:09:19] well part away we've got to let that
[1:09:21] signal come through the signal is
[1:09:22] passing through you signals are passing
[1:09:26] through this room is that right that's
[1:09:30] why the proper could say the very words
[1:09:32] of Jesus Christ and it's true they're
[1:09:34] still here circling around the around
[1:09:36] the earth and and he said if we had a
[1:09:39] device we could pick that up but you
[1:09:41] know it's not necessary that we pick up
[1:09:44] so much the natural words but it's
[1:09:46] necessary that we pick up the words of
[1:09:50] the fulfillment for our day and our
[1:09:53] generation and for that we're going to
[1:09:56] need something that is tuned in to the
[1:09:58] network amen we're going to need
[1:10:01] something that has a card inside of it
[1:10:04] that can be activated are you with me
[1:10:06] you can carry around the phone but if
[1:10:09] any inactivated no calls no service
[1:10:12] under set you can come into a building
[1:10:14] and get Wi-Fi whoo Oh glory to God you
[1:10:16] can get Wi-Fi but when you go out among
[1:10:18] the world you have no signal but if that
[1:10:22] phone has a card within it that has been
[1:10:24] activated
[1:10:27] Benny consent calls receive calls he can
[1:10:31] send messages receive messages it is
[1:10:34] right there you are in contact wherever
[1:10:36] you go it might be on a roaming fee
[1:10:38] there might be things you come in
[1:10:40] contact with that you've got to go
[1:10:41] around and navigator out but yet there
[1:10:44] is something that you know this has been
[1:10:46] navigated my signal bars might get real
[1:10:49] low but one thing I know my phone has
[1:10:51] been activated I might be in a place
[1:10:53] right now I need to move I might need to
[1:10:55] get away from some things right now if
[1:10:57] there do what in order for my signals to
[1:10:59] come back where they need to be you
[1:11:01] understand what I'm talking that's
[1:11:02] talking about a Christian life so the
[1:11:05] new birth is not we're all of a sudden
[1:11:06] you're always got five by five Power
[1:11:08] Bars glory to God I tell you boys got no
[1:11:10] no that's not that's not what a new
[1:11:12] birth is the new birth is where you
[1:11:13] recognize who you are and sin has become
[1:11:16] dead to you and so here you are you're
[1:11:19] looking and if you sense anything in
[1:11:21] your life if it's to move away from
[1:11:23] certain things you move away from it why
[1:11:25] why do you move away from it because the
[1:11:27] signal is what you value you value being
[1:11:32] led by the Spirit of God y'all know what
[1:11:34] I'm talking about sometimes people would
[1:11:36] call me I'll be right right down the
[1:11:37] basement um hey hold on hold on if I
[1:11:39] drop you I'll call you back when I get
[1:11:40] up why all that aluminum from that
[1:11:42] ductwork down there it makes it hard to
[1:11:44] even have the call so there is must be a
[1:11:47] mode of transmission now brother Ram
[1:11:50] goes on to say then you bury that caca
[1:11:52] burrow and it'll produce a grain of
[1:11:55] wheat because there has been a life of
[1:11:59] wheat but in the cocklebur I don't know
[1:12:02] if you're catching this here is the
[1:12:03] clears the kokuboro inside it is put
[1:12:06] wheat germ life but when you bury the
[1:12:09] kokuboro
[1:12:10] the outside rots away and what is on the
[1:12:14] inside is what comes forth he's talking
[1:12:18] about you and you both use and the life
[1:12:25] notice and the life of the kokuboro has
[1:12:28] been taken out thank you lord but the
[1:12:31] nature of the coupler Burrell is still
[1:12:35] sticky
[1:12:40] sticky that's why it's easy to if it's
[1:12:43] sticky
[1:12:44] that means it's easy to stick to things
[1:12:46] and you have to get it unstuck how do
[1:12:50] you get it unstuck by the life within
[1:12:52] you will pause on that today and it will
[1:12:59] be until this new life has fully been
[1:13:04] developed out of the ground and raised
[1:13:06] up again Porton will be until this new
[1:13:11] life what new life you see am I trying
[1:13:14] to make my a burl any better but if
[1:13:16] I'm feeding that man on the inside that
[1:13:18] man on the inside has strength to subdue
[1:13:21] and reflect the glory of God through a
[1:13:24] badger skin or a cockapoo
[1:13:28] he says win it when it comes forth it's
[1:13:31] no more Cocker burl
[1:13:32] butwe while it's here on earth in and
[1:13:34] out of the earth a cocker bro it's still
[1:13:36] sticky and it's got the nature on the
[1:13:40] inside of a week wow what a complex
[1:13:42] person you are and I am as long as
[1:13:46] you're in this life you're going to be
[1:13:48] sticky and have a carnal nature that's
[1:13:51] going to bother you as long as you live
[1:13:54] there's a key at one time it never
[1:13:57] bothered you because the nature within
[1:14:01] was synonymous with the kokuboro
[1:14:03] but now there's been a change any bother
[1:14:06] shoot this coupler burl bothers you
[1:14:12] gonna beat a god that's going to bother
[1:14:15] you as long as you live so if you're not
[1:14:18] bothered something's wrong but the
[1:14:21] inside of you notice the inside of you
[1:14:23] you're born again and when you're raised
[1:14:26] up you're in the likeness of Christ and
[1:14:28] all the sin is gone from you that's the
[1:14:32] thing now let's let's look at this here
[1:14:35] just a little bit through the word I
[1:14:37] want to just begin speaking to you on
[1:14:39] from Puckle burl to wheat life
[1:14:40] and let's look at this in the word is
[1:14:43] God has laid this out of because we can
[1:14:45] never it's important in recognizing of
[1:14:50] we are where we've come from and the
[1:14:53] great plan of redemption it is
[1:14:55] absolutely necessary that we have our
[1:14:58] feet upon solid ground and I don't think
[1:15:02] we can we can ever ever get beyond that
[1:15:04] we should never that is never we're
[1:15:06] never to get beyond that the message of
[1:15:08] redemption because that's what it's all
[1:15:10] about
[1:15:13] notice how God comes along here in
[1:15:17] Genesis verse 3 and he speaks now to a
[1:15:20] condition that has arose upon the earth
[1:15:23] among his family his children and the
[1:15:26] Lord God said unto the serpent because
[1:15:28] thou has done this thou art cursed above
[1:15:32] all cattle and above every beast of the
[1:15:34] field upon thy belly shalt thou go and
[1:15:37] dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy
[1:15:39] life so here here an upright being is
[1:15:42] now cursed and now he must go up on his
[1:15:46] belly and I will put enmity between thee
[1:15:50] and the woman and between thy seed and
[1:15:53] her seed it shall bruise thy head and
[1:15:57] thou shalt bruise his heel now god when
[1:16:01] we've looked at this many times in the
[1:16:04] word God is committing that of
[1:16:09] redemption is solely in the hands of
[1:16:13] Almighty God it's completely in his
[1:16:17] hands and he and he says I will give her
[1:16:20] a seat then we know the woman does not
[1:16:22] have a seat the woman is a bedding
[1:16:26] ground is that right
[1:16:27] so God is committing himself to supply
[1:16:32] and remember with seed seed has a germ
[1:16:35] of life with on the inside of it so God
[1:16:38] is committing that his life is going to
[1:16:42] come back into the human race but not
[1:16:45] just come back into it but with the
[1:16:47] purpose of for redemption
[1:16:51] so God let lets it be known here that it
[1:16:56] shall bruise this is what the seed will
[1:16:58] do this is one this is what it will do
[1:17:01] he's announcing it it shall bruise
[1:17:04] the head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:17:07] God lets it be known that the head
[1:17:10] notice what he's dealing with the head
[1:17:12] here's the effect of the life of the
[1:17:15] seed it goes to the root of the problem
[1:17:18] it deals with the head it doesn't you
[1:17:21] know it's like many times when you look
[1:17:23] at it if if if I was being attacked you
[1:17:26] know by a bear or something or you were
[1:17:29] you don't want to I don't want you to
[1:17:31] cut its arm off you're gonna make it
[1:17:34] matter I don't want you to cut its leg
[1:17:37] off you're going to make it more mad but
[1:17:41] if you will hit it in the head if you
[1:17:44] will take its head off then every other
[1:17:47] thing every other limb everything else
[1:17:49] will die because the head has been
[1:17:53] removed from the body so the head is
[1:17:57] that source of life so God is letting it
[1:18:01] be known that I'm not going to come and
[1:18:02] remove arms and remove limbs I'm gonna
[1:18:05] come and take off heads I'm gonna I'm
[1:18:08] coming in and this see that's coming
[1:18:10] that look to see that's coming is not
[1:18:12] gonna look like a mighty warrior but he
[1:18:15] is a mighty warrior hey man it's gonna
[1:18:18] be such a humility to wear that be the
[1:18:21] the the the people of that day were
[1:18:23] looking and the despised and rejected
[1:18:25] and how that here he will you know about
[1:18:28] his life going the bow will look just
[1:18:29] like and as far as in his looks and
[1:18:32] everything just like any ordinary man
[1:18:34] upon this earth but what is packed
[1:18:36] behind that vessel and behind that veil
[1:18:39] Oh glory you're talking about light and
[1:18:43] electricity that can light up on a city
[1:18:45] this light that is packed inside of that
[1:18:48] vessel is the very same light that said
[1:18:51] in the beginning let there be light
[1:18:53] is that same light in that vessel in
[1:18:56] that beginning that lights up every man
[1:18:59] that have come into the earth that true
[1:19:02] light what that light that's behind this
[1:19:05] vessel this was an ambush
[1:19:13] the devil didn't know it he was ambushed
[1:19:17] on Calvary he was ambushed how many
[1:19:23] times the Prophet said when he was
[1:19:24] walking up that hill and he said it how
[1:19:26] the blood spots was getting bigger
[1:19:27] he said the devil said this guy can't be
[1:19:30] the Son of God he said there is no way
[1:19:33] he would they would take that kind of
[1:19:35] stuff take that kind of punishment oh
[1:19:37] but I hear the words of the Prophet say
[1:19:40] but a son of God will put up a son of
[1:19:44] God will put up he will take the
[1:19:46] criticism how how can he take the
[1:19:48] criticism it wasn't because he was a
[1:19:51] Superman he took the criticism because
[1:19:53] his faith his focus was in the purpose
[1:19:57] that God had revealed to him who he was
[1:20:00] and why was here upon this earth I tell
[1:20:02] your friends have we let that purpose
[1:20:04] predominate and have preeminence in our
[1:20:06] life everything else around us it seems
[1:20:09] as nothing we're able to cast it down
[1:20:12] we're able to hold to do not allow it to
[1:20:14] get us down because why there's a
[1:20:16] greater purpose than my feelings there's
[1:20:18] a greater purpose I don't want this
[1:20:23] cocklebur getting in the way of that
[1:20:25] wheat life so I have to bring my a
[1:20:28] burl into subjection because my Oh
[1:20:31] bro can get his a bull feelings
[1:20:33] hurt and he gets his feelings hurt he'll
[1:20:39] hinder sweet life from expressing like
[1:20:41] it off - is that right Amen so here this
[1:20:49] is dealing with with the head
[1:20:52] the ruling part no one shouldn't watch
[1:20:54] this habit brother brown lays this out
[1:20:57] in the fees in churches I'm gonna read
[1:20:58] just a little bit here and I think this
[1:21:02] is just so precious he said we've come
[1:21:06] this far
[1:21:07] let me try to christian and crystallize
[1:21:09] your thinking on this subject so you can
[1:21:12] see the necessity of our going into the
[1:21:14] serpent seed doctrine as I have we start
[1:21:17] with the fact that there were two trees
[1:21:19] in the midst of the garden there by say
[1:21:21] men or two trees there
[1:21:24] no doubt in that the tree of life was
[1:21:27] Jesus remember when Jesus come he said I
[1:21:30] am the way the truth and the life the
[1:21:39] other tree is definitely Satan because
[1:21:42] of what came forth of the fruit of that
[1:21:45] tree amen
[1:21:47] now then we know that both of those
[1:21:50] trees had a relationship and once now I
[1:21:52] want you to just put on your spiritual
[1:21:54] thinking caps when we know that both of
[1:21:56] those trees had a relationship to man or
[1:22:00] they would never have been placed there
[1:22:09] when we read the rest of this here now
[1:22:13] if we take this word and apply it to our
[1:22:16] lives personally to know that God has
[1:22:19] not allowed things to come around and
[1:22:22] things for us to be in in certain places
[1:22:25] a job and whatever more it's not
[1:22:27] something that God said oh no what in
[1:22:29] the world he's watching over our lives
[1:22:34] he knows what he's doing and let me just
[1:22:39] tell you right now there is a truth in
[1:22:41] the scripture where it says let every
[1:22:43] man be able to give my reason of hope
[1:22:47] that lies within him but you know what
[1:22:49] there's times when you're not to say
[1:22:51] nothing I've got a whole study I haven't
[1:22:57] been having brought it to you yet but
[1:22:59] there's things were from years ago I got
[1:23:00] to looking at it with the Lord Jesus you
[1:23:02] find there's times they said something
[1:23:04] to the Lord Jesus he just walked away
[1:23:06] you know what they would have said it
[1:23:08] this guy's rude no no he ain't gonna
[1:23:10] argue
[1:23:14] there's times the answer and there's
[1:23:16] times not to answer
[1:23:19] you only got so much time up on this
[1:23:22] earth you only got so much time use it
[1:23:25] wisely
[1:23:27] but we're not careful that kokuboro
[1:23:30] wants to get in the way and prove but
[1:23:36] the proof is in the pudding
[1:23:38] whoo now give you some good banana
[1:23:41] pudding right now with in vanilla
[1:23:44] whispers don't worry I ain't lost where
[1:23:49] where I'm having a good old time this is
[1:23:52] my birthday no better place to be
[1:23:56] brother Dominic than a house of God on
[1:23:58] my birthday
[1:24:00] all right notice he says now then we
[1:24:05] know that both of those trees had a
[1:24:06] relationship to manner they would never
[1:24:08] have been placed there they must have
[1:24:11] had a part in the sovereign plan and
[1:24:13] purpose of God in their relationship to
[1:24:15] mankind and to himself or we could never
[1:24:18] impute a misson son to God this is all
[1:24:22] true so far is it not now the word most
[1:24:26] definitely sets forth that from before
[1:24:29] the foundation of the earth the purpose
[1:24:32] of God was to share his eternal life
[1:24:35] with man now in Ephesians chapter in
[1:24:40] Ephesians chapter one I'm not going to
[1:24:45] have you turn there because of for sake
[1:24:46] of time but it features chapter 1 if you
[1:24:49] want to write it down and read it later
[1:24:50] it's verse 4 through 11 and appall moved
[1:24:53] by the Spirit of God
[1:24:54] notice here the first as he's laying
[1:24:59] this down you were chosen in him before
[1:25:03] the foundation of the world he goes into
[1:25:06] the choosing there and he brings it down
[1:25:08] to how then can we come back into or
[1:25:12] come back to what he has chosen will you
[1:25:15] never get away from his choosing but he
[1:25:18] makes a way that what he has chosen
[1:25:21] through the written
[1:25:23] chin of his blood that what he has
[1:25:25] chosen then can come back into
[1:25:28] expression he didn't choose you and I've
[1:25:34] said this and I'm gonna repeat it again
[1:25:36] the election of God is not like you and
[1:25:40] I playing kickball and recess we're all
[1:25:44] of a sudden you know we get everybody
[1:25:45] lined up against the wall and we're out
[1:25:47] here picking teams what we do carnality
[1:25:59] you understand you see that's the
[1:26:01] carnality of church church wants to pick
[1:26:04] people God ain't picking now he already
[1:26:08] chose but what he chose is back from his
[1:26:11] own loins identified these guys are my
[1:26:16] boys they're good-looking they look like
[1:26:18] their daddy but they came they and they
[1:26:21] come from from the genes it's right here
[1:26:23] you see and there's a love that I had
[1:26:25] for I didn't go out and pick somebody up
[1:26:27] and make up my Sunday or mine because
[1:26:29] they came of me that is the choosing of
[1:26:31] God you and I were down in this kind of
[1:26:35] a condition and now thinking about it
[1:26:37] how did we get in this kind of a
[1:26:38] condition you seen we're talking about
[1:26:40] Redemption now why do we need to be
[1:26:42] redeemed ooh
[1:26:45] you see it's good ask questions about is
[1:26:48] like when when people want to talk about
[1:26:49] the virgin birth well is the virgin
[1:26:51] birth why is it got to be the virgin
[1:26:54] birth why is it that's the point why
[1:26:57] because whatever God is doing its
[1:26:59] undoing something else so and answer
[1:27:03] that question it will go back to
[1:27:04] cerfancy now I've used that many times
[1:27:11] now notice this revelation is certain
[1:27:13] I'm gonna read this one revelation 13:8
[1:27:15] all that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:27:16] worship Him Satan whose names are not
[1:27:21] written I remember Isaiah 14 Satan's
[1:27:24] desire ambition I will ascend above the
[1:27:28] stars of God there write that phrase
[1:27:31] stars of God is messiahs brothers
[1:27:35] I will ascend above them but God keeps
[1:27:41] going and says but thou shalt be brought
[1:27:44] down so here
[1:27:48] oh but upon the face of the earth shall
[1:27:51] worship Him Satan no we're not talking
[1:27:52] about them that guy's name Alexander
[1:27:55] Crowley or whatever his name is
[1:27:57] we're not talking about that we're
[1:27:58] talking about a religious realm whose
[1:28:01] names are not written in the book of
[1:28:04] life of the lamb slain from the
[1:28:06] foundation of the world
[1:28:08] oh my mind here the prophet said goes
[1:28:12] into this statement but that life
[1:28:14] talking about that life that comes out
[1:28:15] of the lamb could not and would not be
[1:28:18] shared in any other way then through the
[1:28:21] way of God manifest in the flesh now
[1:28:26] what's he talking about shared is he
[1:28:29] talking about shared as far as any
[1:28:32] mission and a returning yet emitting
[1:28:34] prophecy would come it comes back or is
[1:28:40] he talking about when that life moves
[1:28:42] and lays a claim upon a vessel how many
[1:28:51] believe that the Spirit of God the
[1:28:54] scripture tells us in the book of Peter
[1:28:55] the prophets are overed were moved up on
[1:29:01] by the Holy Ghost you believe that they
[1:29:07] were moved upon by the by the Spirit of
[1:29:09] God alright and what to do what did the
[1:29:12] Spirit of God speak through them it
[1:29:14] identified his coming it identified
[1:29:18] parts of who he is
[1:29:23] but identifying in parts did not produce
[1:29:26] Redemption all of that has to come
[1:29:30] together this was part of his eternal
[1:29:37] and predestinated purpose this plan was
[1:29:39] to be to the praise of the glory of His
[1:29:41] grace it was the plan of redemption it
[1:29:44] was the plan of salvation now listen
[1:29:46] closely he said God being a savior it
[1:29:48] was
[1:29:48] necessary that he predestinated a man
[1:29:51] who would require salvation in order to
[1:29:54] give himself reason and purpose of being
[1:29:57] that's a powerful statement God couldn't
[1:30:00] make that man fall he couldn't do it and
[1:30:04] be just that is 100% correct multitudes
[1:30:10] of scripture very doubtless does a very
[1:30:11] pointed verse of Rael Romans 11:36
[1:30:14] for of him and through him and to him
[1:30:16] are all things to whom be glory forever
[1:30:18] amen watch this now man could not
[1:30:22] directly come and partake of that tree
[1:30:24] of life in the midst of the garden that
[1:30:26] eternal life of the tree had to become
[1:30:29] flesh first all right
[1:30:32] the cherubim was placed there at an at
[1:30:36] the gate these two at the gate right and
[1:30:38] he was placed there with the flaming
[1:30:40] sword
[1:30:40] - do I keep the way to the Tree of Life
[1:30:44] so I listened to close it off but it was
[1:30:48] to keep the way and the only way that
[1:30:53] that way could be unfolded to you and I
[1:30:56] is for the tree of life himself to
[1:30:59] become flesh he who was there had to
[1:31:05] come where we are but before God could
[1:31:11] raise and save a sinner he had to have a
[1:31:14] sinner to raise and say man had to fall
[1:31:16] the fall which would be caused by Satan
[1:31:20] had to have flesh to make fall Satan
[1:31:25] can't do nothing unless he's got flesh I
[1:31:28] don't know about you but I want my
[1:31:30] cocklebur reserved for the Lord to
[1:31:32] express himself through is that right
[1:31:36] Lord Jesus help me Lord that's why Paul
[1:31:39] could say let all bitterness malice let
[1:31:43] all those things be put away from you
[1:31:46] there right Paul would go on to say
[1:31:49] mortify therefore the members of your
[1:31:53] body right what why is he speaking that
[1:31:56] because I'm wheat life still inside of
[1:31:59] kokuboro
[1:32:01] but greater is sweet life in you than
[1:32:05] cocklebur out here so I had to come in
[1:32:12] flash Satan you know
[1:32:15] oh my we're gonna come back here's the
[1:32:20] world tonight Satan had to come through
[1:32:24] flesh also now watch this
[1:32:25] but Satan could not come through human
[1:32:28] flesh to make the fall as would Christ
[1:32:31] come in human flesh to restore the
[1:32:33] fallen but there was an animal the
[1:32:37] serpent so close to man that Satan could
[1:32:41] not get to that that Satan could get to
[1:32:44] that beast and through that beast
[1:32:45] remember it didn't say he was a reptile
[1:32:50] the Bible called him in verse one beast
[1:32:54] of the field most subtle of all the
[1:32:57] beasts of the field they're right but
[1:33:00] notice here there had to be a way that
[1:33:02] he could get into the human flesh and
[1:33:04] caused the fall and inject himself
[1:33:07] thereby into the human race so Satan's
[1:33:11] desire was to inject himself into the
[1:33:14] human race that's his desire this is why
[1:33:21] as we said moments ago that the Lord
[1:33:23] Jesus could look upon the Pharisees and
[1:33:25] they could prove Abraham is my father
[1:33:29] they could go back and back and back and
[1:33:31] back and back and back and back and back
[1:33:33] and back but yet jesus said you're of
[1:33:35] your father the devil why he ain't
[1:33:38] looking at a natural seed this is a
[1:33:41] spiritual seed and what did he say your
[1:33:47] daddy your father was a murderer from
[1:33:51] the beginning what was he a murderer of
[1:33:54] the revealed Word in flesh that's always
[1:33:59] been that Satan manifesting himself a
[1:34:02] murderer of the revealed Word in flesh
[1:34:05] and listen friends that's where the
[1:34:06] prophets said in the in the church age
[1:34:08] book he said when they cannot withstand
[1:34:10] the
[1:34:11] work that God is doing through that man
[1:34:14] he said because they cannot deny it
[1:34:17] they cannot withstand it they go to
[1:34:19] start attacking the vessel in whom God
[1:34:21] is using that's a characteristic of
[1:34:24] Satan that's why you can see the
[1:34:28] anointing listen friends these are not
[1:34:30] these are not just minds of men just
[1:34:33] coming up with questions and innuendos
[1:34:35] or whatever more this is demonic
[1:34:36] anointing it's spiritual alleging but as
[1:34:41] they are anointed shell is the bride of
[1:34:43] Jesus Christ anointed they men when that
[1:34:49] anointed to listen to chatter were
[1:34:50] anointed to fly blu-ray and they're
[1:34:55] gonna try to straighten out the chipmunk
[1:34:57] chatter that's not my purpose my purpose
[1:35:00] is flying into the heavenlies hey man
[1:35:04] there's more Eagles there's Eagles that
[1:35:06] will fly into the heavenlies then the
[1:35:09] San friends we're not talking about
[1:35:11] converting people by proving things all
[1:35:13] right very one of you and I that can
[1:35:15] prove it it has to be God that can prove
[1:35:18] it if it can't be proven it's a man but
[1:35:22] when it can't be proven it's a surety of
[1:35:25] God amen
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:29] the scripture said prove all things and
[1:35:32] hold fast to that which is good he is
[1:35:33] not speaking of our intellect proving
[1:35:36] all things is looking with spiritual
[1:35:39] discernment identifying the
[1:35:41] characteristic and the spirit all the
[1:35:43] way through that's why it must be the
[1:35:46] word coming that uncovers Satan oh my
[1:35:52] inject himself thereby into the human
[1:35:55] race even as Jesus would one day come
[1:35:59] and inject himself into the human race
[1:36:02] Kyle repeater God my lord this is better
[1:36:08] than an apple crisp
[1:36:10] into human bodies even to the extent of
[1:36:15] a resurrection wherein we would have
[1:36:17] bodies locking to his own glorious one
[1:36:20] notice notice notice the instant the
[1:36:22] extent of this injection is not just to
[1:36:26] produce a new you a change on the inside
[1:36:30] but it leads you to a completion of what
[1:36:34] it's all about and that is back into the
[1:36:37] image that he in the beginning said
[1:36:39] smile and took the picture and put you
[1:36:45] in his family album that image is
[1:36:48] developing in you not like the
[1:36:50] instantaneous of your little iPhone
[1:36:52] camera no it's more like a Polaroid it
[1:36:54] is there it's being developed you're
[1:36:56] looking at that great thing it's been
[1:36:57] shot out look look look look at this
[1:37:00] look at this that's how you are in your
[1:37:01] life when you're seeing more of wheat
[1:37:03] life express through cocklebur oh-ho my
[1:37:05] glory to God I'm seeing more of that
[1:37:07] image of my look at that there and
[1:37:09] you're looking at things you're seeing
[1:37:11] it what is it this life is a darkroom
[1:37:14] our lives are developed for his glory
[1:37:18] hey Manny where do we we have the
[1:37:22] negative what's the negative you can't
[1:37:23] get a negative unless there's a positive
[1:37:25] somewhere in order to be a negative
[1:37:27] there has to be a positive where a
[1:37:29] picture was taken off and the picture
[1:37:32] that was taken
[1:37:32] the negative is placed right down in our
[1:37:35] lives and then as we come under the
[1:37:37] light of the hour
[1:37:38] what does it begin to do develop what
[1:37:41] that negative bringing forth that image
[1:37:43] that was there the whole time
[1:37:44] what image the image that was in his
[1:37:47] family album
[1:37:52] don't worry yeah in this family album
[1:37:56] you got all your hair you got your real
[1:37:59] teeth - absolutely
[1:38:02] but better than that we've got a we've
[1:38:04] got a real true disposition that's
[1:38:09] exactly right
[1:38:10] thank you Lord because when you get to
[1:38:13] the other side you can say praise God
[1:38:14] brother so-and-so is gonna be changed
[1:38:16] but now they're gonna be changed but
[1:38:17] that part about you that they bother is
[1:38:19] going to be changed also
[1:38:22] my goodness there will be husbands and
[1:38:25] wives walking down the streets of code
[1:38:26] together had to say that I love my wife
[1:38:31] to pieces that's the truth I don't know
[1:38:34] what I'd do without her notice this when
[1:38:38] Satan had brought about that which was
[1:38:40] necessary to the purpose of God been man
[1:38:43] could not get to the tree of life in the
[1:38:45] garden certainly not it wasn't time but
[1:38:47] an animal animal that calls the fall had
[1:38:49] it not let animal life be shed was taken
[1:38:52] in his blood shed then God had communion
[1:38:54] with man again then there was to come a
[1:38:57] day when God would appear in flesh and
[1:39:00] by means of his humiliation he would
[1:39:03] restore fallen man
[1:39:04] and make him a partaker of that life
[1:39:07] eternal oh my once you see this you can
[1:39:09] understand the Serpent's heed and
[1:39:11] knowing that it was no apple Eve ate it
[1:39:14] was the degradation of humanity by
[1:39:16] intermingling deceit the prophets were
[1:39:23] all a part of him Hebrews chapter 1 the
[1:39:27] Bible tells us that God in sundry times
[1:39:32] spake unto the father's through the
[1:39:37] prophets but in these last days notice
[1:39:40] Paul is bringing a distinction but in
[1:39:42] these last days he has spoken to us by
[1:39:45] his son whom he hath appointed heir of
[1:39:48] all things but whom also he made the
[1:39:51] world's wandering in the separation that
[1:39:55] this was not just another prophet this
[1:39:57] is the god prophet this is he who us
[1:40:01] before all things who being the
[1:40:06] brightness of his glory the Express
[1:40:09] image of his person and upholding all
[1:40:12] things by the word of his power when he
[1:40:14] had by himself purged our sins sat down
[1:40:17] on the right hand of the Majesty on high
[1:40:18] now think of this the prophets as we
[1:40:22] said moments ago were moved upon by the
[1:40:23] Spirit of God they were able to receive
[1:40:27] transmission from God built-in receivers
[1:40:30] they could receive a transmission and
[1:40:33] would speak in utterance as the spirit
[1:40:36] would give him but then the Spirit of
[1:40:37] God would move back off of him then the
[1:40:40] Spirit of God would move on then the
[1:40:43] Spirit of God would move back upon him
[1:40:45] but here in this time when he became
[1:40:50] flesh there's a difference it's no
[1:40:53] longer just is not just a spirit the
[1:40:56] Spirit of God moving upon prophesying
[1:40:58] handing in and leaving but the Spirit of
[1:41:00] God is gonna come and remain here with
[1:41:05] me we're talking about Redemption
[1:41:09] Redemption this expressed image this
[1:41:12] expressed image as as it lays it right
[1:41:15] here it's the term you and I know
[1:41:17] character character a character of life
[1:41:22] your life is molded by the character
[1:41:23] inside of you and the expressed image is
[1:41:27] that which is an exact expression of any
[1:41:31] person anything immortan likeness of
[1:41:33] precise reproduction in every respect
[1:41:36] its effect simile a fax Jesus was God
[1:41:42] faxed to earth God faxed his image to
[1:41:48] earth here be behind that vessel behind
[1:41:54] that veil here was the very image of God
[1:41:56] I want you I want you to catch this now
[1:41:58] God did not send down another law or
[1:42:01] admits to a law he didn't need to do
[1:42:04] that what he needed to do was he come
[1:42:08] himself who is the Lord who is the
[1:42:11] lawgiver he didn't either come down and
[1:42:15] say oh man this is a rose
[1:42:16] let's make amendments to this oh this is
[1:42:18] a rose let's make amendments to this no
[1:42:20] no we're not talking about a
[1:42:22] continuation we're talking about one who
[1:42:25] is coming to do the work that he alone
[1:42:28] can do and needs to be done if he is
[1:42:32] saying you must be born again then he
[1:42:35] has to provide the way is that right
[1:42:40] now let's examine this because when we
[1:42:42] look at it when he came there's a
[1:42:45] different anointing
[1:42:46] it's the same holy spirit but now that
[1:42:48] the Spirit of God moving here it's
[1:42:50] coming as Redeemer anointed you see he's
[1:42:53] coming in Redemption he's coming to
[1:42:56] redeem it's a redeemer anointing notice
[1:42:59] how that the scripture says in the book
[1:43:01] of in the book of Galatians here in the
[1:43:04] book of Galatians here how that it
[1:43:07] speaks that we were an error in verse
[1:43:10] one yet we were children but we differ
[1:43:12] nothing from a servant though we'd be
[1:43:14] Lord of all having power and authority
[1:43:17] within you but yet that power and
[1:43:19] authority has not been expressed it's
[1:43:23] like a seed having within at all these
[1:43:26] bushels of tomatoes that you can make
[1:43:30] salsa out of you can make tomato and
[1:43:32] dumplings you can make spaghetti sauce
[1:43:33] but yet the seed itself has not been
[1:43:37] able to release what it is yet it's all
[1:43:41] in there that was you and I but is under
[1:43:47] tutors and governors until the time
[1:43:49] appointed of the Father even so when we
[1:43:52] were children were in bondage under the
[1:43:56] elements of the world we were always
[1:43:58] children but we were in bondage under
[1:44:04] what the elements of the world the first
[1:44:06] birth had us imprisoned it had rule and
[1:44:11] authority over us
[1:44:22] but when the fullness of time was come
[1:44:25] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[1:44:29] made under the law to redeem them that
[1:44:32] were under the law that we might receive
[1:44:34] the adoption of sons this tree of life
[1:44:39] had to become flesh had to be made of a
[1:44:44] woman but it could not be it could not
[1:44:47] be God simply supplying life to a human
[1:44:52] egg but it had to be God creating both
[1:44:57] egg and sperm why because otherwise it's
[1:45:01] still polluted Satan still has a hold on
[1:45:05] it it is a blood that's tied in with the
[1:45:07] rest of it but it's got to be a blood
[1:45:11] that is different from all other blood
[1:45:14] and is not a blood that's Padian to
[1:45:17] where we are now ah it's got to take a
[1:45:18] blood that can loosen us that can break
[1:45:21] the hold of sin and change a blood
[1:45:24] that's able to say the person that
[1:45:26] generation the curse is broken it's
[1:45:29] gotta be a blood that why I can't speak
[1:45:31] there's gotta be one speak for me
[1:45:34] [Applause]
[1:45:38] hallelu any man the made of a woman made
[1:45:43] under the law now think of this in
[1:45:47] Romans 8 verse 3 Paul said for what the
[1:45:51] law could not do in that it was weak
[1:45:55] through the flesh God sending his own
[1:45:59] son in the likeness of sinful flesh what
[1:46:02] love sending his own son in the likeness
[1:46:06] not sinful flesh but in the likeness of
[1:46:10] it sinful flesh would to be a birth like
[1:46:16] has been but this is a virgin birth
[1:46:22] and because he is of the virgin birth
[1:46:26] then he can announce it's time for new
[1:46:29] birth below could not do it now watch
[1:46:36] now it was weak through the flesh but
[1:46:40] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:46:41] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[1:46:45] sin in the flesh that the righteousness
[1:46:47] of the law might be fulfilled in us
[1:46:50] notice the righteousness of the law not
[1:46:54] that you become mr. and mrs. perfect the
[1:46:58] righteousness of the law is where God
[1:47:00] deals with the life on the inside he
[1:47:04] deals with the germ life were you with
[1:47:07] me he's dealing with that on the inside
[1:47:09] that's a real righteousness not a
[1:47:12] righteousness that you can put on and
[1:47:14] take off this is not a righteousness
[1:47:16] that you keep this is God's own
[1:47:18] righteousness no man could produce this
[1:47:22] this is God's righteousness this is to
[1:47:25] him be glory in the church throughout a
[1:47:27] league all ages who do I walk not after
[1:47:32] the flesh but after the spirit
[1:47:36] so God came down and he took his own
[1:47:43] laws and lived by him he took his own
[1:47:53] laws and live by how was he able to do
[1:47:58] that because that's who he is
[1:48:01] but the law was stone his nature in
[1:48:05] graven in it come on somebody the law
[1:48:11] the law itself Paul likens in one place
[1:48:14] the ministration of death
[1:48:18] how long did was this just a little bit
[1:48:20] here because the reality is let me just
[1:48:24] make this statement there was and there
[1:48:27] is nothing wrong with the law of God
[1:48:33] but something you just said it was
[1:48:35] engraving in stone that's right but
[1:48:37] that's not what God wanted to do God let
[1:48:43] it be known in that manner but his
[1:48:46] desire was to write it in you it meant
[1:48:54] wrong with the law it's our nature that
[1:48:56] needed changing they're right but you
[1:49:01] see this is why when the scripture says
[1:49:04] that the word in Gen in John 1:14 once
[1:49:07] made flesh the tree of life made flesh
[1:49:11] and dwelt among us and we beheld the
[1:49:15] glory right full of what grace and truth
[1:49:23] full of not just a little tinkling
[1:49:26] little bit full let me just drop this
[1:49:29] this is the gathering together for
[1:49:32] redemption the ministry of the son of
[1:49:36] man in the end time it's gathering
[1:49:38] together the ministry of the son of man
[1:49:40] and redemption for what it's the bride
[1:49:43] coming of Christ its Christ now dwelling
[1:49:47] behind his bride the same Jesus in bride
[1:49:51] form the parallels opened the side took
[1:49:59] out the elements comprise men of the
[1:50:01] church
[1:50:02] now here the bride stepping forth what
[1:50:04] is it
[1:50:05] it's that say that bride that words come
[1:50:07] from him she his bone of his bone flesh
[1:50:10] of his flesh life of his life she is him
[1:50:14] who is she the Son of man revealed a son
[1:50:19] of man was here revealing feasts on a
[1:50:21] man but the Son of Man is revealed
[1:50:23] behind human skin you know but it took a
[1:50:30] son a man with a call to go out by wire
[1:50:32] to do what bring you an act to the place
[1:50:35] of a union
[1:50:37] very men to let you and I know hey this
[1:50:40] is the time this is the union time this
[1:50:43] is a time that all creation has longed
[1:50:46] for this is a time of redemption
[1:50:50] everybody else's that it's foolishness
[1:50:52] we don't need all that but to the
[1:50:54] electors something expires it scares us
[1:50:57] into position what is it we are part of
[1:51:00] Redemption amen we're not a type it's
[1:51:10] all tights gathered together ester
[1:51:13] Rebecca on and on and on and on and on
[1:51:15] and on and on and on and on full of
[1:51:20] grace God providing for you and I but we
[1:51:26] could not do grace full of grace
[1:51:31] shoutings of grace full of truth not
[1:51:36] just part through these are the true
[1:51:37] sayings of God full of truth what is
[1:51:44] truth truth is not a doctrine Pilate
[1:51:49] said what is truth hey Jesus said for
[1:51:53] this cause was I born to bear witness
[1:51:56] not of a truth but the truth what is the
[1:52:00] truth the truth from before in eternity
[1:52:03] reflected in the garden the truth is the
[1:52:06] person of Christ himself life I am come
[1:52:12] to bear witness to the truth my
[1:52:14] existence here was to be that perfect
[1:52:18] sacrifice that lies the web God himself
[1:52:22] injected back down into humanity
[1:52:34] Paul said the law was holy and the
[1:52:38] commandment holy and just and good
[1:52:40] romans 4 7 14 4 we know that the law is
[1:52:44] spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin
[1:52:48] nothing wrong with the law but it needed
[1:52:53] to be away to where this could come into
[1:52:55] man but what God the only way it could
[1:53:00] happen it would be by God himself coming
[1:53:03] down and taking his own laws and living
[1:53:07] by them how could he take his own laws
[1:53:10] by the very life itself being lived out
[1:53:15] through him what was being lived out the
[1:53:18] fulfillment of the law the fulfillment
[1:53:22] of the law was I do this I don't do this
[1:53:25] I don't do that I do this that's not
[1:53:27] what the fulfillment the fulfillment was
[1:53:29] from an inward work that desire to do
[1:53:33] only those things that please him
[1:53:36] he's the first of this new race that's
[1:53:38] the characteristic of every new birth
[1:53:42] desire to do only those things that
[1:53:44] please him glory be to God man so here
[1:53:53] in Redemption now let me just work with
[1:53:55] this just a little bit here I'm not
[1:53:58] going to ask you if you're getting tired
[1:54:01] Redemption but look at this redemption
[1:54:03] of his don't remember the leaves they
[1:54:04] thought injection of himself into the
[1:54:07] human race so he's got look Satan had to
[1:54:10] find a vessel that he could inject
[1:54:13] himself into right so God God is not
[1:54:18] looking over the span of humanity and
[1:54:20] trying to find wonder who'd be a good
[1:54:22] one hmm see Abraham David no no man was
[1:54:32] worthy
[1:54:33] are you with me see when we're not
[1:54:37] talking about bringing a continent
[1:54:38] continuation of this here but God
[1:54:41] himself provides for himself a body he's
[1:54:48] got to provide a body that he can step
[1:54:50] in to inject himself into not just move
[1:54:53] upon him prophesy and move back
[1:54:58] redemption is he comes to his own claims
[1:55:03] his own remains in his own on his own
[1:55:07] with his own i will walk in them you
[1:55:13] with me now John 1:32 and John bear
[1:55:17] record saying I saw the Spirit
[1:55:18] descending from heaven like a dove and
[1:55:21] it abode upon him and I knew him not
[1:55:25] John you didn't you mean to tell me you
[1:55:27] didn't know you all related daddy what
[1:55:29] he's talking about
[1:55:30] he did know him in this way if some of
[1:55:37] us knew one another before we know one
[1:55:39] another how we know one another now come
[1:55:42] on somebody you don't know me like you
[1:55:44] used to know me I don't know you like I
[1:55:46] used to know you what's happened I know
[1:55:48] you in a different manner why there has
[1:55:51] life on the inside what we'll send out
[1:55:55] with the church on my life so I'm
[1:55:57] talking about you can have a church life
[1:55:59] I'm talking about when Christ is your
[1:56:02] life that's the difference where it is
[1:56:04] actually a pulsation it's a reflection
[1:56:07] of Christ it's not a okay we go to
[1:56:09] church this time the week and we do this
[1:56:10] we do that and we do this that's not
[1:56:11] what we're talking about we're talking
[1:56:13] about our life brought by a love affair
[1:56:15] brought by relationship and I said I
[1:56:19] drew him not but he that sent me to
[1:56:22] baptize with water the same said unto me
[1:56:25] upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[1:56:28] descending and remaining on him well
[1:56:35] here's the difference now this separates
[1:56:36] him from the prophets the prophets that
[1:56:39] would descend and move back but now it's
[1:56:42] remaining God
[1:56:44] injecting himself into the human race it
[1:56:48] was always the word and his birth he was
[1:56:52] the word he stood as a 12 year old boy
[1:56:54] no you're not I must be about my
[1:56:56] father's business he wants to live but
[1:56:58] when he walked into the River Jordan and
[1:57:00] he walked up out of the River Jordan
[1:57:02] here the Holy Spirit from God comes down
[1:57:05] and what does it do it quickens him to
[1:57:08] the word you know what God was doing
[1:57:15] he's showing an example of every son and
[1:57:18] daughter of God being born again Jesus
[1:57:23] didn't have a nature that needed
[1:57:25] changing come on somebody
[1:57:28] come on that had to be quickened he had
[1:57:32] to have the promises quickened to him
[1:57:35] i'ma tell you if the promises ain't
[1:57:38] quicken you can have a lot of knowledge
[1:57:40] about them but when they're quick and
[1:57:41] there's something in you that spans
[1:57:46] knowledge will not stand friends of me
[1:57:48] tell you something knowledge is no match
[1:57:50] for the devil it makes me a quickened
[1:57:54] word inside of you that this has become
[1:57:57] alive inside of me it is my life about
[1:58:05] whom thou shalt see the spirit
[1:58:06] descending and remaining on him the same
[1:58:09] as he which baptizeth with the Holy
[1:58:11] Ghost this is the Redeemer anointing
[1:58:15] different from all the prophets this is
[1:58:17] the and this is the anointing that had
[1:58:19] come like the rainbow parts of upon the
[1:58:21] rest of the prophets but now it had come
[1:58:23] together God is light
[1:58:25] he was standing this light that lighteth
[1:58:27] every man here was this light behind the
[1:58:29] vessel behind the veil come on somebody
[1:58:34] and it light was not shown again and
[1:58:36] coming out again he went in here and it
[1:58:39] wasn't shown again until Klaus saw it on
[1:58:42] the road to Damascus and when Paul saw
[1:58:45] their life he said who are you lord he
[1:58:47] said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us
[1:58:55] God took the corporal body home but left
[1:58:57] himself here with us doradito god oma
[1:59:05] think about this the most glorious event
[1:59:09] happened right there at the River Jordan
[1:59:12] the most glorious event was not the
[1:59:14] birth wonderful that that virgin birth
[1:59:17] OMA how wonderful but you know the
[1:59:19] Prophet even says it like this and I
[1:59:21] believe you can agree that the the new
[1:59:23] birth is even more miraculous than the
[1:59:25] virgin birth but the greatest moment in
[1:59:33] history God and man coming together here
[1:59:38] is a vessel here is a body that has been
[1:59:41] prepared and this body that has been
[1:59:44] prepared the word remember Mary said how
[1:59:46] can this be seeing I know not a man Mary
[1:59:49] the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee is
[1:59:53] that right and the body God created a
[1:59:59] body for himself to come and dwell in
[2:00:02] God injecting himself into the human
[2:00:06] race Oh glory be to God he got to breed
[2:00:10] his back he's got to breed his way back
[2:00:12] so God injects himself into as you might
[2:00:16] remember here he is coming here in Jena
[2:00:18] Luke chapter 3 verse 21 when all the
[2:00:21] people were baptized it came to pass
[2:00:22] that Jesus being baptized and praying
[2:00:25] the heaven was opened and the Holy Ghost
[2:00:27] descended in a bodily shape like a dove
[2:00:29] upon him and a voice came from heaven
[2:00:31] which said thou art my beloved son in
[2:00:34] the a my well pleased louis god say here
[2:00:39] he was he was coming down from the
[2:00:42] heavens he was screaming down from the
[2:00:44] heavens the fullness of God the fullness
[2:00:47] of God he's going to visit the earth why
[2:00:49] there's a body on earth that the
[2:00:52] fullness can come into let me say this
[2:00:55] to you right now
[2:00:56] the bride of Jesus Christ is the body on
[2:00:59] earth that the fullness has
[2:01:01] - hey man it's Redemption the bride
[2:01:05] coming of Christ what did it do here the

[2:03:51] I'll tell you this is not just something
[2:03:53] we're just looking at in church and just
[2:03:55] well we're getting done when we're not
[2:03:56] talking about churches I'm here we're
[2:03:59] talking about eternal life we're talking
[2:04:01] about things right now the way your
[2:04:03] attitude and things could be could make
[2:04:04] the difference for you right now you can
[2:04:06] say lord help me Lord God - Lord receive

[2:04:17] weary - you may not think so but I'm
[2:04:20] tired and weary but you know there's a
[2:04:22] word that God has given right here and
[2:04:24] I've asked God in my heart wine preached
[2:04:26] and I've had to do it now had to do it
[2:04:28] many times help me and give me the
[2:04:29] strength Lord - just say what you once
[2:04:31] said Lord here he comes here is this
[2:04:36] body that's prepared in the in Psalms 40
[2:04:39] verse 6 sacrifice and offering thou did
[2:04:41] us not desire now did is not desire did
[2:04:45] not he require sacrifice he did but that
[2:04:48] is not what he desired mine ears look at
[2:04:55] this this is a key my nears has now
[2:04:58] opened that word open me noosed a
[2:05:02] channel has been opened the heavens have
[2:05:06] been opened there's one who's no longer
[2:05:09] just walking by a letter but one who is
[2:05:12] in contact with the author himself and
[2:05:15] the
[2:05:15] is to be expressed he that hath an ear
[2:05:19] to hear let him hear what the Spirit
[2:05:22] says what's he doing this being able to
[2:05:25] hear is delivering him from what has
[2:05:27] become church anity burnt offerings and
[2:05:30] sacrifices and everything and just they
[2:05:32] say it's delivering him from just church
[2:05:35] Hannity that's what the real Holy Ghost
[2:05:39] does it delivers us from being just
[2:05:42] carnal church members but we become
[2:05:44] spirit new by the Spirit of God where
[2:05:49] God speaks with divine option divine
[2:05:51] inspiration and it's glorious because
[2:05:59] the inner man has to tell the kokuboro
[2:06:01] sometimes shut up the devil can get on
[2:06:06] that Kaka Braun say you just think that
[2:06:07] way but the inside man said this is what
[2:06:09] God told me shut up
[2:06:14] you can even either come along with me
[2:06:16] peaceably or I'll drag you your choice
[2:06:20] but you're going come on now how many
[2:06:26] times I got to drag my a bronze
[2:06:28] stand right here and you got to drag
[2:06:30] your a bro right there oh there's
[2:06:32] wonderful those times in mind that with
[2:06:34] everything also are three parts and my
[2:06:36] goodness I really feel like going to the
[2:06:37] house of God man tyrant and then there's
[2:06:39] other times where you are having to tell
[2:06:41] yourself come on get with it yeah my my
[2:06:53] this is gonna be good
[2:06:55] not just now but if God carries burnt
[2:06:59] offering and sin offering hast thou not
[2:07:01] required
[2:07:02] he didn't require this he did he did but
[2:07:06] this was not his desire this did not
[2:07:09] fulfill his longing you know how it is
[2:07:13] when you get a hunger for something in
[2:07:14] your house well you think it's in your
[2:07:17] house then I got a taste for something
[2:07:18] watch this what about this yeah what
[2:07:20] about this
[2:07:22] [Music]
[2:07:25] go to bed why nothing's being mentioned
[2:07:29] that that seems to appeal to you it
[2:07:34] about said the problem all the brothers
[2:07:36] staying quiet they want to say nothing
[2:07:38] some of the single ones raising their
[2:07:40] hands you won't be doing that longing
[2:07:42] buddy but there's something that's
[2:07:47] craving there's something that's long
[2:07:50] but they tell you something you think
[2:07:52] you were wrong
[2:07:53] you think creation was longing he was
[2:07:56] longing
[2:07:57] he's been longing to bring this
[2:08:00] Redemption plan before that was Adam sky
[2:08:04] that's your molecule he's wanted to hear
[2:08:08] your praises breathe from your lips from
[2:08:12] your life he's wanted this well he's
[2:08:16] been longing and you think you're
[2:08:18] longing for the rapture you're thinking
[2:08:20] you're longing to see his face he's
[2:08:22] longing to see you more than your only
[2:08:25] to see him and that is so great because
[2:08:28] sometimes with the perplexity of life
[2:08:30] and cares we can get down but the
[2:08:33] longing that he has and his place within
[2:08:35] us will not allow us to succumb to
[2:08:38] Kookaburra lism
[2:08:47] then said I know I come in the volume of
[2:08:53] the book it is written of me look at
[2:08:57] this I delight to do thy will who my god
[2:09:01] yea thy law is within my heart I have
[2:09:06] preached righteousness and every
[2:09:08] congregation preached it there not only
[2:09:13] did he say it but there's times he
[2:09:14] preached without words
[2:09:18] that's what I've said to you before
[2:09:20] preach every one of you preach and some
[2:09:24] of you are ordained to use words but
[2:09:27] every one of us are deign to preach what
[2:09:30] righteousness preaching laches of my
[2:09:33] wife your life though I have not reflect
[2:09:36] my lips o Lord thou knowest I have I've
[2:09:40] not hear thy righteousness within my
[2:09:42] heart I have declared thy faithfulness
[2:09:44] and that salvation
[2:09:46] I have not concealed by loving-kindness
[2:09:49] and that truth from the great
[2:09:51] congregation I have declared thy
[2:09:56] faithfulness he told me to come back to
[2:09:59] this and I'm going to the faithfulness
[2:10:03] it's one thing when you experience God's
[2:10:05] healing touch you experience an answer
[2:10:07] right then and there but it's another
[2:10:09] thing when you're in the midst of a
[2:10:10] trial in the midst of a temptation and
[2:10:12] the pressure is coming the pressures on
[2:10:14] the Lord Jesus himself here God allowed
[2:10:18] him to get as far as the mortality to
[2:10:21] the weakest point are you with me in
[2:10:25] temptation and here that devil came to
[2:10:28] him and said that's hungry turn these
[2:10:32] stones into bread there was a natural
[2:10:37] craving that wanted that he's dealing
[2:10:43] with repulsion of natural cravings what
[2:10:51] did he say here is I have declared thy
[2:10:53] faithfulness I have declared my
[2:10:57] faithfulness
[2:10:58] get thee behind me Satan for it is
[2:11:02] written thou shalt not live but by if
[2:11:17] every word of God he was standing on the
[2:11:21] father's word he wasn't overcoming
[2:11:26] because he didn't feel tempted and he
[2:11:28] was tempted temptation is not desire you
[2:11:36] miss me his resistance against the land
[2:11:39] there was a life from the inside that
[2:11:41] resisted against it this was filling the
[2:11:44] pool
[2:11:45] but on the inside what was he doing
[2:11:49] standing on the father's were not using
[2:11:52] any of his great supernatural powers no
[2:11:55] no he stood on the word he was offered
[2:12:01] position he stood
[2:12:09] I'm there remember in the word where
[2:12:11] Paul says neither height nor depth
[2:12:13] remember that neither height nor depth
[2:12:17] you know - depth deals with your
[2:12:20] perception your perception you know it
[2:12:25] is get on Google map and you look down
[2:12:27] even on this area right here
[2:12:29] some of you then hunting deer what will
[2:12:30] we do we'll get on them we'll get on the
[2:12:32] map will look down we'll try to find
[2:12:33] trails trying to find pinch points try
[2:12:35] to find certain things where we can get
[2:12:36] those deers they're coming in what are
[2:12:37] you doing you're at a different vantage
[2:12:38] point things look differently you're
[2:12:42] able to make different calculations
[2:12:44] different things and that is exactly
[2:12:45] where the enemy notice he takes him up
[2:12:48] onto a high place what's he doing
[2:12:51] showing different perceptions of things
[2:12:53] come on somebody well the enemy will try
[2:12:57] to bring a lot of perceptions our way
[2:12:59] but what's important that we stand on
[2:13:01] the word sometimes we can see something
[2:13:04] in a different way it's a different
[2:13:06] perception but remember the word remains
[2:13:08] the word neither height nor depth Satan
[2:13:17] did the first splice job he cut together
[2:13:19] and placed it together all the kings of
[2:13:21] this world sure it in the moments time
[2:13:24] but what he forgot to do he put all the
[2:13:26] glory spots in it you know it's like
[2:13:28] taking a shot of the Capitol building in
[2:13:30] Washington DC and not taking a shot of
[2:13:32] what lays behind it come on the hood and
[2:13:36] everything else that lays back there
[2:13:37] everything that lays back there all the
[2:13:38] projects and everything else it's like
[2:13:40] taking home ah this glorious Capitol
[2:13:42] what's behind it but that Satan as he
[2:13:46] presents all the glamour but I want to
[2:13:48] know what's behind it and the Spirit of
[2:13:52] God came to John and John was looking
[2:13:54] upon this woman and he wondered with
[2:13:57] great amazement but the Spirit of God is
[2:14:00] committed to his word and John is a part
[2:14:02] of that word
[2:14:03] and the Spirit of God did what took the
[2:14:05] cover off of her wool she's an evil
[2:14:09] woman
[2:14:21] and Hebrews 10 verse 7 I'm coming down I
[2:14:25] really am this is Paul referring to this
[2:14:32] then said i lo how come in the volume of
[2:14:37] the book it is written to me to do thy
[2:14:38] will O God above when he said sacrifice
[2:14:41] and offering and burnt offerings and
[2:14:42] offering for sin that would us not
[2:14:44] neither has the pleasure therein which
[2:14:47] are offered by the law there offered by
[2:14:50] the law see God's you see God God didn't
[2:14:54] want you or me serving him by duty I
[2:15:01] mean how you know you don't want
[2:15:04] anything but duty you don't want things
[2:15:06] by duty in your own home like Paul
[2:15:10] Raydor you know he kissed his wife run
[2:15:12] out the door he got down the solid
[2:15:15] sidewalk and got to thinking about her
[2:15:16] he ran back in and grabbed her and laid
[2:15:18] a good old smack on so one of the roles
[2:15:20] are different second one had a lot of
[2:15:22] feeling in it
[2:15:25] God don't want you and I doing things by
[2:15:28] duty listen friends that that's not
[2:15:30] maintainable I don't care how good
[2:15:33] intentions you can say oh god I promise
[2:15:35] our promises fail that's the god of
[2:15:40] gunny looking for a pledge Lord I'll be
[2:15:42] a church honey looking for no pledge god
[2:15:46] I that's not what God wants he just
[2:15:49] wants you he'll do the rest that's all
[2:15:55] he wants
[2:15:55] that's all ones he don't want promises
[2:15:58] he wants surrender offered by the law
[2:16:06] then said helo I come to do thy will o
[2:16:09] God he taketh away the first that he may
[2:16:13] establish the second by the which will
[2:16:16] we are sanctified through the offering
[2:16:17] of the body of Jesus Christ once before
[2:16:21] a law he takes away the first that he
[2:16:25] may establish the second he took away
[2:16:29] that life he took away
[2:16:33] that nature he took away that you and I
[2:16:36] walking in that measure he took that
[2:16:39] away that he might establish the second
[2:16:42] he establishes the second this is where
[2:16:48] Paul could say in Romans three the law
[2:16:51] has not been done away with but rather
[2:16:53] it's been established it's established
[2:16:57] what is it it's come to its rightful
[2:17:00] position in the hearts of his people
[2:17:07] like the ark setting down in the Old
[2:17:09] Testament it sets down sockets
[2:17:19] when the Bible says in Colossians to him
[2:17:21] I'm coming
[2:17:22] y'all still with me verse 2 Colossians
[2:17:28] 2:13 you being dead in your sins and the
[2:17:31] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[2:17:33] quickened together with him having
[2:17:35] forgiven you all trespasses so the devil
[2:17:45] wants to bring up your past God don't
[2:17:49] bring your past up when you've met his
[2:17:52] requirements it's been putting to see if
[2:17:54] forgetfulness oh yeah brother Sam
[2:17:56] there's no fishing why do you have to
[2:17:58] put a no fishing sign you don't remain
[2:18:02] you can't remain in the blood it ain't
[2:18:06] like your sins are stuck in the sea of
[2:18:08] forgetfulness oh that's a big bass so
[2:18:11] that's a smallmouth that's a big mouth
[2:18:13] that no no no no no no the blood
[2:18:19] dismantles it it separates it from you
[2:18:24] and it puts it back up on the one who
[2:18:27] brought the inspiration in the beginning
[2:18:30] that's what the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:18:32] does that's why when the blood of Jesus
[2:18:36] Christ is preached it is the Word of God
[2:18:39] for that hour the Spirit of God taken
[2:18:42] that word and the blood of God going
[2:18:44] forth what does it do it brings
[2:18:45] separation notice what he did blotting
[2:18:51] out the handwriting of Ordinances that
[2:18:54] was against us which was contrary to us
[2:18:57] and took it out of the way nailing it to
[2:18:59] the cross
[2:18:59] blotting it out he didn't do away with
[2:19:02] the law he changed you and I that's the
[2:19:06] blotting out that was necessary he
[2:19:08] condemned sin in the flesh by what by
[2:19:11] the righteousness of the spirit of life
[2:19:13] dwelling behind that vessel that here is
[2:19:16] a life that lives pleasing under the
[2:19:18] Lord it took her out took it out of the
[2:19:21] way when people say oh he did oh we're
[2:19:25] in grace he did away with a lot no grace
[2:19:27] establishes the law
[2:19:30] grace establishes it he puts it in its
[2:19:33] place hallelujah James 1:21 wherefore
[2:19:40] lay apart all filthiness and superfluity
[2:19:45] of naughtiness and receive with meekness
[2:19:49] the engrafted word which is able to save
[2:19:54] your souls the engrafted word the
[2:19:58] engrafted is inborn implanted by nature
[2:20:03] implanted by others instruction he
[2:20:07] injected himself created a body injected
[2:20:11] his life into that body took his own
[2:20:13] walls lived by it paid the price went
[2:20:17] down bore our sins as the burden bear
[2:20:19] into hell deposit him there
[2:20:22] ascended back up released those in
[2:20:23] paradise that were waiting and rose with
[2:20:25] those arose with those Saints appeared
[2:20:28] and walked upon the earth for forty days
[2:20:29] that right and went on up in the process
[2:20:32] of that time appeared and then as he
[2:20:34] come back down moving around there among
[2:20:36] them with forty days then here there's a
[2:20:38] secret going away those Saints that had
[2:20:40] been resurrected now are caught away
[2:20:43] have you been resurrected if you've been
[2:20:46] resurrected you shall be caught away it
[2:20:50] was a secret God nobody else knew about
[2:20:52] it but they were being caught up and
[2:20:54] here he comes doing what he becomes the
[2:20:56] high priest of his own word and he sends
[2:21:00] back that same life to us enough there
[2:21:07] on the day of Pentecost what is it it's
[2:21:11] the new birth it's being born again of
[2:21:14] the incorruptible Word of God
[2:21:16] receiving the engrafted word implanted
[2:21:19] into our lives by nature God a great
[2:21:22] mystery God taking a color ball and
[2:21:27] putting wheat life on the inside
[2:21:31] of that talkable same old temple but a
[2:21:38] new creation on the inside the Sims I
[2:21:43] used to do I do them no more The Sims I
[2:21:49] used to do I do their no more the sins I
[2:21:53] used to do I do them no more it was a
[2:21:57] glad day when I was born again I don't
[2:22:05] want to do it grieves me anything that I
[2:22:08] do that displeases him it grieves me
[2:22:13] when I have a wrong thought about
[2:22:14] something sure that I'm telling you the
[2:22:18] truth friends well my attitude gets a
[2:22:21] little bit out of line it grieves me it

[2:22:27] sweet life things be to God they're
[2:22:32] sweet life
[2:22:33] that's the stream of the Tree of Life
[2:22:36] and that string of the Tree of Life is
[2:22:40] greater than any strain from the
[2:22:43] genetics of our natural birth
[2:22:45] greater is He that is in you than he
[2:22:50] that is in the world now you could say
[2:22:56] like Paul collations

[2:23:11] liveth in me Paul sir you mean you're

[2:23:39] himself for me in the middle of that

[2:31:33] away but God I believe Lord that hearts
[2:31:37] that have gathered here they've not
[2:31:38] gathered to leave out of your farther
[2:31:40] away hands that have been lifted up Lord
[2:31:42] God Lord throughout the building from

[2:32:10] God that Lord there was something within
[2:32:12] them Lord that would cause them Lord God
[2:32:14] to move that hand Lord showing the
[2:32:17] daughter heart had been touched Lord and
[2:32:19] the desire or God that they have Lord
[2:32:21] that you have pricked Lord that you have
[2:32:23] moved upon Lord God that you might come
[2:32:26] Lord and quench Lord and feel Lord
[2:32:28] through a satisfaction Lord to where
[2:32:31] everything Lord that they would have in
[2:32:32] their mind of thinking I gotta get rid
