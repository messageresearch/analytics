[0:00] but our bill is my witness
[0:02] sister mary brenna bill they will make
[0:05] sure
[0:06] that
[0:07] they do shopping for us
[0:09] and what i remember
[0:11] uh when
[0:12] brazil and i go to the
[0:15] in our shops and we come back
[0:17] sister merrick will ask
[0:19] bill
[0:20] did you get something for the wife
[0:23] bro bill would say yes he said is it
[0:25] enough go back go back go back
[0:28] oh brother when i remember all these
[0:30] things
[0:31] i thank the lord
[0:33] that the lord took care from this earth
[0:35] as a believer of this message
[0:38] and so no doubt
[0:39] we know if jesus started
[0:41] we are going to continue
[0:43] and
[0:44] that very day we shall see here
[0:48] we shall see here not in in cleveland
[0:51] hospital any longer
[0:53] which i see here not with infirmities
[0:56] and troubles of the body
[0:58] but we are going to see the real mary
[1:01] over there
[1:02] we pray that the lord will help all of
[1:04] us to keep the faith
[1:07] now when that day comes
[1:08] all of us will assemble
[1:11] so
[1:12] god bless you for your love for her your
[1:15] prayers and the help that you offered
[1:18] we say god bless all of you amen
[1:24] now
[1:25] we'll go back to business
[1:28] yes
[1:30] because in the beginning was the word
[1:33] and the word was with god
[1:36] and the word was god
[1:39] there was nothing made
[1:41] without the word
[1:44] so if you are living today on this earth
[1:47] without the word
[1:49] then you are nothing
[1:53] that is why we believers
[1:55] we eat the world
[1:58] we drink the weight
[2:00] we sleep the weight
[2:02] we dance the weight
[2:04] we do everything the work
[2:06] we walk the way we run the work
[2:09] everything we do is a way
[2:11] and i know that is the reason why we
[2:13] have gathered this evening
[2:15] amen so without wasting time
[2:19] i want us to turn our scriptures
[2:24] to luke chapter 4
[2:29] as
[2:32] we be on our feet at this moment
[2:38] luke chapter 4
[2:49] and verse 16.
[2:57] and he
[2:58] came to nazareth where he had been
[3:00] brought up
[3:02] and asked his custom was
[3:04] he went into the synagogue on the
[3:06] sabbath day
[3:07] and stood upon for to read
[3:10] and they were delivered unto him
[3:13] the book of the prophet
[3:15] isaiah
[3:16] and when he had opened the book
[3:18] he found a place where it was written
[3:21] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[3:24] because he had anointed me to preach the
[3:26] gospel to the poor
[3:29] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[3:32] to preach deliverance to the captives
[3:35] and recovering of sight to the blind
[3:38] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[3:41] to preach the acceptable year of the
[3:43] lord
[3:45] and he closed the book
[3:47] and he gave it again to the minister and
[3:49] sat down
[3:51] and the eyes of all them that were in
[3:53] that synagogue were fasting on him
[3:56] and he began to say unto them
[3:58] this day is this scripture fulfilled in
[4:01] your years
[4:03] and all bear him witness
[4:05] and wandered at the gracious west which
[4:08] proceeded out of his mouth
[4:12] and he said
[4:13] it's not this joseph's son
[4:17] let's
[4:18] pray
[4:20] father we thank you and we bless your
[4:22] name that
[4:23] you've given us opportunity this moment
[4:26] to turn the pages of your scriptures to
[4:28] read it we pray our father
[4:31] that you come
[4:32] and put something out of it into our
[4:34] hearts will lift our faith to a higher
[4:36] ground we ask you this in jesus christ's
[4:39] name amen
[4:41] let's take our scene beloved
[4:45] tonight we want to look on this subject
[4:48] look on jesus
[4:56] look on jesus
[4:59] now when we look on jesus
[5:02] what do we see
[5:08] when we look on jesus because there are
[5:10] so many
[5:12] you know
[5:14] people
[5:15] with different kinds
[5:18] of ideas
[5:22] concerning jesus christ
[5:27] some take him as
[5:30] a religious leader
[5:33] some take jesus
[5:35] as one of the prophets
[5:39] some tell jesus
[5:41] as
[5:42] ordinary miraculous worker
[5:45] but tonight the question is
[5:47] when you look on jesus
[5:49] who do you
[5:50] see
[5:52] praise be the name of our god
[5:56] now
[5:57] this was
[6:00] a fulfillment
[6:02] of the prophecy of isaiah
[6:07] that the spirit
[6:08] of the lord is upon me because he had
[6:10] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[6:13] poor he has sent me to heal the
[6:15] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[6:17] the cutting and recovering of sight to
[6:19] the blind
[6:20] you set a liberty them that are bruised
[6:24] to preach the acceptable year of the
[6:26] lord
[6:28] isaiah prophesied this down
[6:31] but are they
[6:33] jesus christ got to the synagogue
[6:37] and all the people were sad
[6:43] waiting to hear from him as he speak
[6:50] there were so many questions
[6:52] in the minds of the people concerning
[6:54] jesus christ already
[6:58] hallelujah
[7:00] some
[7:02] i mean
[7:03] you cannot
[7:04] understand even the way they thought
[7:07] about jesus christ
[7:10] and this is the question i always ask
[7:12] myself that if the people did not trust
[7:15] jesus
[7:17] as god made him to be
[7:19] why did they hunt or handle this scroll
[7:24] that you should read
[7:28] it should have some power pushed them to
[7:31] do that
[7:33] because whether they like it or not that
[7:35] scripture needed to be fulfilled
[7:40] and so in a synagogue
[7:42] the bible said that they handed the book
[7:44] to him the book of the prophet isaiah
[7:47] and he read that prophecy
[7:52] and after he read it
[7:54] he gave it back to them
[7:58] and the bible say that and all the
[8:00] people
[8:01] look on him
[8:03] and he declared
[8:05] this day
[8:07] this scripture is fulfilled
[8:11] now
[8:13] it
[8:14] brought some detention i mean
[8:16] among the people
[8:18] and uh
[8:20] they begin to agitate
[8:23] they begin to ponder they begin to ask
[8:25] so many questions
[8:28] why should this man read this scripture
[8:31] and tell us that it is fulfilled
[8:36] we know god is the messiah that has to
[8:38] come and do this
[8:41] so who is this man
[8:44] they look on the man according to the
[8:46] bible but they didn't see the messiah
[8:50] they look on him they didn't see that he
[8:52] was the one that used to come to fulfill
[8:54] that
[8:56] and they said
[8:58] and all
[9:00] bear him witness
[9:02] and wounded at the gracious ways which
[9:05] proceed out of his mouth
[9:07] and they said
[9:08] it's not this joseph's son
[9:13] so it means they look on him
[9:16] and they only saw joseph's son
[9:20] i remember when uh he was he was on the
[9:23] ass
[9:24] marching through to jerusalem
[9:27] and the women pulled palm branches and
[9:30] some through their clothes and they were
[9:32] shouting hosanna hosanna hosanna is the
[9:34] highest
[9:36] to fulfill amirah scripture there were
[9:38] people pharaoh seas and elderly people
[9:41] they went across and asked who is this
[9:45] they still didn't see the one that was
[9:48] he was
[9:51] but beloved
[9:52] tonight we want to take these few
[9:54] minutes to see who jesus christ is
[9:59] in our lives
[10:01] today
[10:02] look at the condition of the world
[10:06] problems here and there troubles here
[10:08] and there
[10:10] people have lost hope
[10:12] but will the believer lose hope
[10:14] no
[10:15] because we are not looking to the system
[10:18] we are not looking to the condition of
[10:20] the world we are looking to the one that
[10:22] have given us a promise
[10:24] hallelujah we are looking onto the one
[10:26] that have life
[10:28] we are looking on the one that can save
[10:30] hallelujah we are looking onto the one
[10:33] that can speak to the storm on the sea
[10:35] be silent and immediately there was calm
[10:38] on the waters
[10:39] he is the one that we are looking onto
[10:42] no matter what happened beloved
[10:44] we are the yes god
[10:46] amen
[10:48] so now he came to fulfill that scripture
[10:52] but they look on him
[10:53] and they didn't see the fulfillment of
[10:55] that scripture
[10:56] and the bible said that because there
[10:59] was so much math
[11:01] about his proclamation
[11:04] they had wanted to throw him into a
[11:06] ditch
[11:07] to finish him
[11:09] but the power
[11:11] of god
[11:12] pushed me push him out and you walk
[11:14] through them and he went away
[11:17] amen
[11:18] this is the people or this
[11:21] where the people who supposed to have
[11:24] studied the bible
[11:28] they were scholars
[11:30] they believed what moses told them
[11:33] but they believe it intellectually
[11:37] they didn't believe it with revelation
[11:40] because it is almost a revelation that
[11:43] will lead you to the truth
[11:46] not what you study
[11:48] not what you think you know
[11:50] the the word leonard people
[11:53] hallelujah caiaphas
[11:55] the rest they were all there
[11:58] they knew what they believed
[12:00] but when they looked on jesus they
[12:03] didn't feed their messiah
[12:05] oh praise the name of our lord
[12:08] but i remember one day
[12:10] that same jesus
[12:13] after they have insulted him after they
[12:16] have called him belgium after they are
[12:18] calling all kinds of names
[12:21] he went to samaria
[12:24] and there and then
[12:25] he met a woman
[12:28] who was at the well
[12:30] preparing to fetch water
[12:33] and jesus said woman
[12:35] can you give me some water to drink
[12:38] but the woman noticed something that
[12:40] jesus was not a sumerian
[12:42] but a jew
[12:44] so quickly
[12:45] she said but i'm a samaritan and you
[12:47] were a jew
[12:49] why do you ask me for
[12:50] water no we don't have things in common
[12:54] and jesus said well woman
[12:57] if you know the one standing before you
[13:01] if you know
[13:03] meaning jesus christ was calling the
[13:06] woman
[13:08] to look unto him well
[13:11] to ascertain
[13:12] who was standing before her
[13:15] he said if you know the one that is
[13:17] standing before you you would rather ask
[13:19] me of water and the water that i'll give
[13:21] to you you will not come back again to
[13:24] this way to draw
[13:30] the woman was so much shocked
[13:32] see who is this saying this to me
[13:36] then jesus christ started he said no
[13:38] remember you don't have a water you
[13:40] don't have uh what the bucket to draw or
[13:43] how are you going to get the water
[13:45] the woman was thinking about fiscal
[13:47] honor but jesus christ was thinking
[13:48] about the spiritual water
[13:50] oh hallelujah
[13:52] he said you don't want to know the
[13:53] bucket that i'm going to use
[13:55] first of all go and call me your husband
[13:58] the woman said well i don't have any
[14:01] jesus said that you are talking the
[14:02] truth
[14:04] you have six of them i'm not five of
[14:07] them and the one that you are still
[14:09] living with right now is not even your
[14:12] husband
[14:13] the woman was
[14:15] this man
[14:17] this man
[14:19] how can this man know my secrets
[14:22] how come this man know my secret
[14:24] he said well
[14:26] we know that our father jacob built this
[14:29] world for us
[14:31] and he drank from it and his cattle and
[14:33] his family
[14:35] and that's what we are drinking also
[14:36] from
[14:38] and you jews you jews say that it is
[14:41] only jerusalem that we should go and
[14:42] watch it
[14:44] jesus told her and i love that
[14:48] he's a woman
[14:49] a time is coming
[14:52] and this is the time
[14:55] that those who worship god will not
[14:58] climb the mountain
[15:00] hallelujah they will not go to jerusalem
[15:04] they will not travel to any place
[15:06] wherever they are they will worship god
[15:08] in truth and in spirit
[15:11] oh hallelujah
[15:14] and the conversation went on
[15:16] and while it was going on the woman was
[15:19] looking for something
[15:21] he was looking at the man who was
[15:24] spoken to her who might this man be
[15:28] hallelujah
[15:30] then immediately
[15:32] he left her bucket
[15:34] okay
[15:35] because jesus christ gave her a punch
[15:39] the woman said
[15:40] i know the messiah will come
[15:44] and when the messiah comes he will be
[15:46] the one to tell us all these things
[15:49] and jesus said word i am telling you the
[15:52] one that is standing before you right
[15:54] now i am
[15:57] wow
[15:59] the woman left her bucket
[16:01] and rushed to the town now she became an
[16:03] evangelist she went and called all the
[16:06] people he said hey people of samaria
[16:08] come over and see a man that i've met
[16:13] is this not the messiah
[16:17] hallelujah
[16:18] is this not the messiah no the pharisee
[16:21] intellectuals they look on jesus christ
[16:23] and they saw abusable
[16:27] you look on jesus christ and they saw an
[16:29] illegitimate child
[16:32] but the women
[16:34] whom they call a prostitute
[16:36] met jesus and she saw the messiah oh
[16:40] hallelujah
[16:42] beloved tonight
[16:43] when you look on jesus who do you see
[16:48] who do you see
[16:50] after all the condemnation
[16:52] of who jesus christ was
[16:55] after all the disgrace of who jesus
[16:58] christ was
[16:59] one time he was walking on the street
[17:03] there were a whole lot of people around
[17:05] around him
[17:06] and there was a woman also
[17:09] another woman also
[17:10] the bible said that he had infirmities
[17:14] 12 years
[17:15] he has been to one hospital to another
[17:18] physicians were making good use of her
[17:20] money
[17:21] because of her sickness
[17:24] the pharisees were around
[17:27] the pharisees have told their people not
[17:29] to go and listen to jesus christ
[17:32] because if they see you conforming they
[17:34] will excommunicate you from their
[17:36] synagogue
[17:38] but this woman
[17:41] when he
[17:42] when she got close to jesus
[17:45] she didn't see an illegitimate child
[17:49] she didn't see unbelievable
[17:52] but she saw the power that could set her
[17:55] free
[17:57] so the bible said that she said if only
[18:00] i can touch a garment or his garment i'm
[18:03] sorry i'll be made whole
[18:06] and you need this one crawl among the
[18:08] people
[18:09] and touch the hand of jesus christ
[18:11] garment
[18:12] and immediately
[18:14] had trouble for 12 years vanished
[18:18] the power
[18:20] of that discernment
[18:22] the power of that revelation
[18:25] pull
[18:26] that you out from jesus christ
[18:30] and jesus said
[18:32] someone has touched me
[18:38] and peter
[18:39] and the rest were
[18:41] laughing at jesus or master
[18:43] we know
[18:44] a lot of people have touched you when
[18:46] we're on the way and we
[18:48] he said peter i know
[18:50] a lot of people have touched me
[18:52] but those touches were ordinary touches
[18:55] but this particular touch is a touch of
[18:58] revelation
[19:00] because it has pulled a virtue out of me
[19:05] then
[19:06] the woman could not
[19:08] hit her feeling and her joy
[19:11] she owned up
[19:12] he said well i am the one
[19:15] jesus christ look at him
[19:17] he's a woman
[19:19] your faith
[19:20] has made you free
[19:24] people look on jesus
[19:26] and they didn't see anything
[19:28] but this one saw jesus and saw american
[19:30] worker
[19:34] she saw the great physician that could
[19:37] solve her problems
[19:40] and indeed jesus christ performed it
[19:43] today
[19:44] brother sister what are we seeing
[19:49] the whole world
[19:51] has become something
[19:53] that nobody knows what's going to happen
[19:55] tomorrow
[19:57] there is so many uncertainty
[20:00] there's no so much confusion
[20:03] there's so much disturbance that people
[20:06] are entertaining fear
[20:08] but it shouldn't be you the believer
[20:11] because you have a greater hope
[20:13] you are something that we don't have
[20:16] hallelujah because we are not looking to
[20:18] the system we are not looking to the
[20:19] circumstances but we are looking to the
[20:21] lord jesus christ
[20:23] he is still the same yesterday today and
[20:25] forever
[20:26] hallelujah
[20:28] oh brother sister
[20:31] today
[20:32] yes today
[20:34] you can also see something supernatural
[20:37] in jesus christ
[20:39] now
[20:40] the prophet says something here and i
[20:41] quickly want to quote it
[20:44] he said now
[20:46] some people
[20:47] when they look to jesus
[20:50] they look and see him
[20:52] they look at him
[20:55] and when they see him
[20:56] they see
[20:58] in him only a church founder
[21:01] i am quoting from looking unto jesus
[21:05] or a church organizer
[21:08] or maybe a creed for a church oh god of
[21:11] mercy
[21:12] that is what many people look to jesus
[21:14] to see
[21:17] he is just a new creed that was added to
[21:19] an old doctrine
[21:21] god forbid that
[21:23] now many people look and see him like
[21:25] that
[21:27] some look
[21:28] and see him as a myth
[21:31] santa claus
[21:33] or some of them look to him as some
[21:35] historical act that god did many years
[21:38] ago
[21:39] god forbid that
[21:42] some of them look to him yet as a baby
[21:44] in a ninja
[21:47] so
[21:48] christ is still a baby in the manger in
[21:51] the mind of some people
[21:56] hallelujah like today
[21:59] some people
[22:01] are still looking at jesus christ in
[22:03] their denominations
[22:05] oh brother is very pity
[22:07] christ has moved on
[22:10] hallelujah and they are still looking
[22:13] for him over there in a ninja as a baby
[22:17] right
[22:18] and they are still buying flowers to go
[22:21] to the uh the ninja to present it
[22:25] all beloved brothers and sisters we are
[22:27] beyond that
[22:30] we are beyond that
[22:32] he said but the question is
[22:35] what do you see when you look on
[22:38] jesus that is the question the prophet
[22:41] is asking all of us
[22:44] do you see the second person of a
[22:46] trinity
[22:48] or do you see a trinity
[22:50] three in one
[22:53] you will only see him as you look at him
[22:56] through the word
[22:58] that is what the only way you will know
[23:01] it
[23:01] because he is the word
[23:04] it will reveal himself
[23:06] depends on what you are looking for
[23:11] and brother says that anytime you are
[23:13] looking for something special
[23:16] in the eye of jesus christ jesus christ
[23:19] will provide that
[23:22] anything that you look unto by the name
[23:25] of jesus christ he will provide it
[23:28] and turn in memorial he has been doing
[23:31] the same thing at all times
[23:33] and one typical example is the woman
[23:35] that i quoted right now the woman with
[23:37] the infirmity he looked on jesus christ
[23:40] for healing and he he receive it
[23:43] hallelujah remember that black woman in
[23:46] memphis during the time of william
[23:48] branham the prophet
[23:50] when the son was sick so much and the
[23:53] doctors have rejected this boy to die
[23:57] the woman said no
[23:58] i will look on jesus christ and the
[24:00] woman looked on jesus christ and he said
[24:04] lord send me
[24:06] the elijah to my house
[24:10] i need elijah in my home right now
[24:13] send him
[24:15] my son is dying
[24:17] amen
[24:18] you say you think that the woman didn't
[24:20] know what he was doing
[24:23] at that moment
[24:24] she was not looking at anything
[24:26] surrounding
[24:27] the only hope was to look on jesus
[24:30] christ
[24:31] and you look on jesus christ and you
[24:33] call on jesus christ because he saw the
[24:35] healer
[24:37] he saw the problems over
[24:41] and once you look on him like that he
[24:43] said lord send the elijah right now to
[24:46] my home
[24:48] and can we imagine
[24:50] the fate of a woman
[24:52] can cause an airplane
[24:55] without any problem without any fault to
[24:57] develop force immediately
[25:01] for the plane to come down
[25:03] for service
[25:05] and for that matter
[25:07] the prophet got the chance by god
[25:10] god said that he was going this way and
[25:13] he said the voice would go that way
[25:16] so
[25:16] he turned around
[25:18] and went away of the voice
[25:22] can you imagine this brother sister
[25:24] and where
[25:26] he was going he said the voice continue
[25:28] to tell her go continue go ahead go
[25:30] ahead
[25:31] till
[25:33] he came
[25:34] across this woman
[25:38] putting her hand
[25:40] upon her fence from 2 30 am
[25:44] when
[25:45] she prayed
[25:47] that elijah should come into her house
[25:51] the moment she saw the prophet coming
[25:54] she said are you the person
[25:58] that the prophet said how did you get to
[26:00] know that i am the person
[26:03] he said well
[26:05] do you know the woman in the bible
[26:08] that woman who had a child in a child
[26:10] was dying and elijah went and prayed for
[26:12] the child
[26:13] do you know that you remember that he
[26:15] said yes
[26:16] and she told the prophet that i am that
[26:19] woman
[26:23] i am that woman
[26:25] my son is dying
[26:27] i have i have refused
[26:29] to to listen to what the doctors are
[26:31] saying
[26:32] because i look on them and they have
[26:34] failed me
[26:35] now i've turned around and have focused
[26:38] on jesus christ and i jesus bring me the
[26:41] elijah to my home
[26:45] the prophet look at the woman
[26:47] now the prophet understood
[26:49] why the voice told hey i'm sorry why the
[26:53] voice told him he should go that way
[26:56] the prophet saw where is the son he said
[26:57] he's in the room
[27:01] the prophet entered into the room
[27:04] he said well
[27:05] the room was uh
[27:08] so much a poor home
[27:10] but he saw an inscription
[27:12] that he laughed
[27:14] he said it read god bless our home
[27:18] and when he entered into the room
[27:21] this boy was groaning
[27:25] on his way
[27:27] today
[27:29] the boy have reached the origin of the
[27:32] lost
[27:33] there was no light
[27:35] only groaning and pains
[27:42] and the prophet
[27:44] told the woman
[27:46] let's pray together for your son
[27:49] they all know they prayed they said the
[27:51] woman prayed a prayer and you read that
[27:54] yes she was looking on jesus christ
[27:58] and after all that the prophet made a
[28:00] short prayer then all of a sudden the
[28:03] guy got up he said mama i can see light
[28:07] mama i can see light in the room mama i
[28:10] can see light in the room and that was
[28:12] the end
[28:15] the power of god descended because the
[28:17] woman looked on the lord jesus christ
[28:21] hallelujah
[28:22] brother today the prophet is asking you
[28:25] and i a question he said when we look on
[28:27] jesus what do we see
[28:31] oh my
[28:32] he said it depends upon
[28:34] what you are looking for
[28:36] if you look to him to argue
[28:39] then you are looking wrong
[28:42] he didn't argue
[28:44] it wasn't meant for him to argue
[28:47] remember
[28:49] you see him as you look at him through
[28:52] his word
[28:53] and recognize him
[28:55] now
[28:58] now you cannot see him until your eyes
[29:00] is open to the fact
[29:03] oh hallelujah you cannot see him until
[29:07] your eyes is open to the fact
[29:10] the fact that he's a messiah
[29:13] the fact that he's the kingsman redeemer
[29:15] the fact that he's our savior the fact
[29:18] that he's our redeemer and everything
[29:20] king of kings and lord of lords
[29:22] that is what when we look on him we see
[29:26] nothing disturbs our faith
[29:28] nothing disciple our feeling
[29:30] whether whatever happened to this act
[29:33] brother sister whatever happened to any
[29:36] country we don't look on that but we
[29:38] look on to the promise of jesus christ
[29:40] our lord
[29:43] amen
[29:47] now listen
[29:51] he said
[29:55] what we want to look at then
[29:58] if jesus has raised from the dead
[30:02] can we see him
[30:04] oh my
[30:05] now
[30:06] there is only one way to do
[30:08] and that is go and see what kind of a
[30:12] person we will look for
[30:15] if you are going tonight to see jesus
[30:20] if jesus was in this shuffle villager
[30:24] great
[30:25] if jesus was in shuffle village tonight
[30:28] what type of man will you look for
[30:32] will you go and look for some fellow
[30:35] that was way up in some great high
[30:37] cathedral with rare priestly looking
[30:39] clothes
[30:43] amen
[30:44] will that be the kind of jesus you were
[30:46] looking for
[30:49] god if it is
[30:51] he is certainly changed since he was
[30:53] here on earth the last time
[30:56] you will not see jesus christ like that
[30:59] for he dressed just like ordinary man
[31:03] he went in among men
[31:06] in and out among men
[31:08] and they didn't even know him because he
[31:11] looked so common like other men
[31:15] there was nothing in him
[31:17] conspicuous
[31:18] about the lord jesus to look at him
[31:22] he will do a certain thing that is the
[31:24] only way they will know him
[31:27] by his miracle
[31:29] and the signs that he did on the road to
[31:32] emmaus
[31:33] after his resurrection do you see it
[31:37] hallelujah and the prophets were talking
[31:39] about cleopas and his friend
[31:42] after all the promise that jesus christ
[31:44] gave to them
[31:46] he died
[31:47] of ramadan they killed him
[31:50] he was buried
[31:51] and he resurrected
[31:53] they teddy
[31:54] but
[31:55] there was the confusion
[31:57] among the people
[31:59] there was the confusion among his own
[32:01] disciples they were doubting after mary
[32:03] magdalene came to tell them that hey
[32:06] jesus christ is risen
[32:09] peter and john remember they run to the
[32:11] sepulcher
[32:12] because they didn't believe it they want
[32:14] to go and see for themselves
[32:16] meanwhile jesus christ told them what
[32:18] were they looking on them
[32:22] and after all this confusion
[32:25] cleopas and his friend were going back
[32:27] home
[32:29] and the bible said that they were
[32:30] talking about this issue
[32:33] anyway it's good to talk about jesus
[32:35] christ
[32:37] any place that you are talk about jesus
[32:39] christ
[32:40] and when you talk about jesus christ he
[32:42] will come around you
[32:43] oh hallelujah
[32:46] they were talking confused how can this
[32:49] be true
[32:51] well
[32:52] then the bible said that all of a sudden
[32:56] jesus christ walked with them
[32:59] and he asked them a question
[33:01] say what are you discussing and you are
[33:04] so much
[33:06] sad and
[33:09] and he asked me a question
[33:11] that i always believed that that
[33:13] question was so much
[33:15] are you a stranger in jerusalem here
[33:19] they could not even look on him and see
[33:22] who he was are you a stranger here don't
[33:25] you know what has happened this during
[33:27] the last three days
[33:28] there is a man called jesus
[33:31] who performed miracle indeed we were
[33:33] witnesses
[33:34] he died and was buried
[33:36] some of our companies have just come to
[33:38] tell us that he is risen
[33:40] he said oh you're fools
[33:45] jesus christ told them you are fools
[33:49] and anybody that don't look to jesus
[33:51] christ he's a fool
[33:54] anybody that looked to jesus and don't
[33:56] see jesus christ is a fool
[34:00] hallelujah
[34:02] jesus said it he said you're fools for
[34:06] not believing what the prophets have
[34:08] told you
[34:10] amen
[34:11] and the bible say that he picked the
[34:13] word and started telling them about the
[34:16] prophecies from time in memorial till
[34:18] the time that they were standing there
[34:22] and while they were doing that
[34:25] they got to the village
[34:27] and the bible said jesus christ
[34:29] pretended to continue the journey
[34:32] and cleopas and his friend convinced him
[34:35] so all master this place is dangerous
[34:39] it's not good for you to go just come
[34:41] and pass the night with us
[34:43] and uh tomorrow morning you can continue
[34:45] your journey
[34:47] they didn't ask him where he was going
[34:49] but thank god
[34:51] when they got that time food was ready
[34:55] on the table and everybody liked food
[34:59] don't you
[35:01] everybody like food you like food i like
[35:03] food
[35:04] we are always happy one food is ready
[35:06] so they were equally happy when the food
[35:08] was ready
[35:10] and they invited jesus christ to
[35:13] offer prayer
[35:15] before they ate
[35:16] and that was the sensible thing they did
[35:20] you know why they did that
[35:22] the bible says that on their way
[35:25] when jesus christ was speaking to them
[35:27] something was telling them in their soul
[35:30] to believe
[35:32] but their eyes were holding
[35:36] and now heard jesus christ open your
[35:37] eyes
[35:38] the bible said that he picked the food
[35:40] and offered prayer on the food the same
[35:44] old way
[35:46] he didn't change it
[35:48] and that is the reason why nobody can
[35:50] change the bible for us
[35:53] nobody can change the bible for us
[35:56] even the message of this hour nobody can
[35:59] change it
[36:01] the reason why god made the prophet to
[36:04] put this message down for us he knew
[36:06] that some people will come and begin to
[36:09] change certain things but i say nobody
[36:11] can change this message for us
[36:14] hallelujah because we are not looking to
[36:17] man
[36:18] we are looking to jesus
[36:21] the bible said immediately when they
[36:24] said amen then their eyes got opened
[36:27] that jesus tried to vanish from among
[36:29] them
[36:30] then clear parts of the person wow
[36:33] didn't our heart bend within us
[36:36] when he spoke to us by the way
[36:38] no can we imagine brah brian
[36:41] these same people who were telling jesus
[36:43] not to continue because the area was
[36:45] dangerous
[36:46] they forgot about the danger
[36:49] and now they themselves started running
[36:50] back to jerusalem
[36:52] with the good news that indeed the lord
[36:55] has risen
[36:57] oh hallelujah at that moment their eyes
[37:01] have been opened and when your eyes open
[37:04] you will see nothing but you see jesus
[37:05] christ
[37:07] oh praise be the name of our god brother
[37:10] sister i tell god that i am one of those
[37:13] people whose eyes are open
[37:15] today we know who jesus christ is when
[37:18] we look on jesus christ we don't see a
[37:21] santa claus when we look on jesus christ
[37:23] we don't see the world system when we
[37:25] look on jesus christ we don't see any
[37:28] person that won't film for himself but
[37:30] when we look at jesus christ we see the
[37:32] king of kings and the lord of lords when
[37:34] we look at jesus christ we see that
[37:36] kingsman redeemer when we look at jesus
[37:38] christ we see that great counselor when
[37:40] we call jesus christ we see the prince
[37:42] of peace when we call jesus christ we
[37:44] see the groom of the bride oh hallelujah
[37:48] when we see on jesus christ we see the
[37:50] great almighty god
[37:54] oh hallelujah
[37:56] amen and amen and amen that is why
[38:00] the world
[38:01] is so much confused
[38:03] because they don't have jesus christ
[38:08] the world is confused brother sister
[38:11] the world is so much confused
[38:13] and when
[38:14] a man come to that state
[38:18] when you are confused
[38:20] in your mind it means you are not stable
[38:22] in your thinking
[38:24] you entertain fear
[38:26] you don't know what is going to happen
[38:28] because they don't have jesus christ in
[38:31] realness
[38:32] and brother don't forget
[38:35] that this condition was spoken by the
[38:38] prophet daniel
[38:40] that it will come to a time that the
[38:43] world will come to that condition
[38:45] at the going down of end
[38:48] of time
[38:50] when nebuchadnezzar saw that image
[38:56] daniel explained
[38:59] and at the feet
[39:01] he said part was clear
[39:03] and pot was iron
[39:06] and they tried to mingle themselves with
[39:09] mankind
[39:10] meaning the system of the world tried to
[39:13] mingle but because clay
[39:15] and iron cannot mix together it could
[39:18] not cleave
[39:20] and so there was confusion
[39:22] and that is what is manifesting right
[39:24] now
[39:25] the world system
[39:27] they're various presidents the various
[39:29] leaders in nations they are always
[39:32] talking about peace
[39:34] they are always talking about peace
[39:36] they are always talking about peace but
[39:39] where is the peace
[39:43] how can you talk about peace when you
[39:45] don't have the prince of peace in your
[39:47] system
[39:48] it cannot be well
[39:51] the world can never talk on peace
[39:54] without having jesus christ
[39:57] so the confusion will continue
[40:00] brother i said the confusion will
[40:02] continue to the stone very soon is going
[40:05] to be cast
[40:08] but before that
[40:10] before that beloved you and i
[40:14] because we are looking on jesus christ
[40:16] will be in glory
[40:21] you remember when ice
[40:27] when they met they were talking about
[40:29] peace what happened confusion
[40:33] confusion
[40:38] your general assembly
[40:39] was an artist to do it somewhere
[40:42] you remember when nikita krishna removed
[40:44] his standards and hit it on the on the
[40:46] desk
[40:47] confusion
[40:49] what did they meet they were meeting
[40:52] to talk about peace
[40:56] but you can never succeed
[40:59] when you are not looking on jesus christ
[41:01] for peace
[41:03] you can never
[41:04] succeed
[41:06] when you talk about peace
[41:08] and jesus christ is not a chairman of
[41:10] the peace
[41:12] you can never succeed beloved brothers
[41:14] so tell the world they will not succeed
[41:16] because they don't have jesus christ
[41:20] hallelujah
[41:22] and recently look at what is happening
[41:23] over there
[41:26] russia attacking ukraine
[41:28] confusion
[41:31] now america don't know whether to go in
[41:33] to support ukraine
[41:35] because they are afraid that the moment
[41:37] they try
[41:38] russia perez will release chemical
[41:40] weapons to destroy the earth so they are
[41:43] careful
[41:45] where is the
[41:46] peace
[41:48] did somebody know
[41:49] that that thing was going to happen
[41:52] no
[41:53] but thank god
[41:55] we
[41:56] have something that we are looking on
[41:59] and the prophet did one
[42:02] he said
[42:04] after the seventh division
[42:06] he had a blast
[42:09] behind him noah
[42:11] and when he came to look
[42:13] there was no nation like america
[42:19] is that
[42:21] bad beloved brothers and sisters
[42:24] this is the blessed assurance
[42:27] he said there is no weapon chemical
[42:31] ballistic
[42:33] you can name it
[42:35] chemical
[42:37] atomic
[42:40] hydrogen
[42:42] ballistic monistic
[42:44] ballistic
[42:46] or fatalistic you can cut all the
[42:48] listing
[42:49] it will never land on this place until
[42:53] the blood of jesus christ is rotted
[42:57] that is why we don't entertain anything
[43:00] because we know the one that we are
[43:01] looking onto
[43:03] and that is jesus christ
[43:06] our savior
[43:07] jesus christ our healer jesus christ our
[43:10] redeemer jesus christ that peaceful
[43:13] redeemer jesus christ the
[43:15] group of the bride
[43:18] he is the one that we are looking onto
[43:21] brother
[43:22] the prophet said
[43:24] because of that
[43:26] we should look on russia
[43:30] he said look at the king of the north
[43:34] look on him
[43:36] watch him
[43:37] from that
[43:38] day
[43:40] and because we are looking on jesus
[43:41] christ
[43:42] we are watching that
[43:45] today
[43:47] if rocha
[43:50] we have to watch
[43:51] russia
[43:53] rochester is not sick
[43:58] whether he say excuse me or not we will
[44:00] watch it
[44:02] today
[44:03] if rachel wants to go and buy pizza
[44:06] from pizza hut
[44:07] we'll watch russia
[44:10] if russia go to buy ice cream we'll
[44:12] watch russia anything russia is doing
[44:14] watch russia you know why because we are
[44:17] looking onto the lord jesus christ
[44:20] amen and amen
[44:22] brother my sister
[44:25] too close
[44:26] let us see this thing the prophet said
[44:28] here
[44:33] he said look at cleopas
[44:37] and then after the resurrection
[44:40] jesus identified himself the way he
[44:42] broke that bread
[44:45] he did it just the way he did it before
[44:48] he was crucified
[44:50] and then that identified his
[44:52] characteristics
[44:54] because that is the way
[44:56] he did it
[44:59] now
[45:00] if we were here if he was here tonight
[45:04] how will he identify himself
[45:09] just like he did yesterday
[45:12] for his the same yesterday today and
[45:14] forever
[45:16] that is his identification
[45:20] hallelujah he will never change
[45:23] and because he doesn't change we also
[45:25] don't change
[45:28] what he has needed has to be
[45:30] that is what he want us to be
[45:33] by filling us with the holy spirit
[45:36] we look on him
[45:39] for our victory
[45:41] we look on him
[45:42] for our success
[45:44] we look on him for our healings
[45:47] we look on him for everything
[45:49] that we can think of
[45:52] the storms may raise
[45:56] problems they come
[45:59] troubles may rise
[46:01] but look on jesus
[46:04] when we look on him beloved brothers we
[46:07] are more than conquerors
[46:10] hallelujah
[46:11] remember
[46:13] on the sea when he started walking on it
[46:16] and the disciples saw him
[46:18] they said peter said lord is that you
[46:21] he said yes be it's me
[46:24] i want to walk and come and meet you he
[46:26] said come on come on board
[46:30] peter look on jesus
[46:32] and he started walking on the scene
[46:35] why did he begin to sink
[46:38] because he lost the focus
[46:41] and look around himself
[46:43] hey peter
[46:45] i'm also walking on the sea oh there
[46:48] you say
[46:49] then you shut the lord have mercy on me
[46:52] and send me
[46:54] brother he should have focus on jesus
[46:57] and when you focus on jesus brother
[46:59] without thinking about your position
