a testimony meant to be a witness of that in our lives we're not we're not quoting of something of history we know that by an experience amen that he is he is alive it's not a story we've been told it's a reality that's in our lives there's a testimony because we have raised amen in our own self we've raised it's raised us from the deadness of the life and the world of where we walk and he's raised us into the real newness of life amen we're so thankful to god for that reality amen i'd rather have that than anything else in the world amen because with that i'm more than a conqueror no matter what comes our way we're we are more than a match for whatever it is that comes our way as paul could write we gain a surpassing victory in everything you believe that this morning amen i want to just uh mention to you we had prayer here for brother samson shetty on thursday night with his for his mother and his brother-in-law and i just spoke with him we had texts and things like that regarding it and they're still dealing with it is mother she's at home now uh she's still dealing with the covid a lot of the symptoms and things like that and so she's at home and now so and he asked that we would just continue to keep not only his mother in prayer his brother-in-law that has dealt with just some paralysis from a stroke but also all the ministers and the believers there in india he asked that we would just just continue to keep them in prayer so we just want to we just want to remember them in prayer different ones around the world i think of many many places you know that some sometimes you don't even realize just how privileged that we are that we can come to the house of god because we're living and i thank god for that here of america the where that we still have we have a choice it's not like it is even in the nation right above north of us here for months they can't go to church at all it's it and it's just it's just a very sad thing and we're living in a time in an hour that fear is soaked grip upon the hearts of people and we've said it over and over but it depends on in this hour this is a time that when we look at everything we want our we want our attention to be upon that which builds strength it's reality it builds faith within our life because whatever you look at or you give yourself to it doesn't come without spirit are you with me whatever you give yourself to it it can start to dominate your life and these are things that within these parts of it that in this hour we we just want to just absorb from god in this hour god has given us the strength he's given us leadership in this hour amen and so we thank god for that i want you just to continue to remember the different saints of god in prayer also i did not have a chance an opportunity that to be able to show you but when i went to north carolina thanking musicians i won't hold you here any longer when i went to north carolina there the first week of [Music] april and when i went there i i had actually had on my heart for some time because we're things that we're looking at from the missions here within the church and certain things certain operations that we had been behind and looking at i really haven't had any responses from those areas and so i'm not exactly sure where those are at right now with the books and things but what i can tell you is is that when i went there to north carolina i took i took with me a check for four thousand dollars and put that in the hands of brother barry coffey because of the work that is going on right now with books being printed because there is such a need for books in these other countries they do not have the tablets don't work those things do not it doesn't work out there among these places they they it doesn't work they they they need books it just doesn't work i mean we can look at it here and think well a tablet should work and this and that it doesn't work when you get out into those other places very remote and so they had asked even a few years ago and and brother barry we've had things out here that has been laid out as far as within uh i don't want to say a magazine but it's been a pamphlet and they themselves any brother berry had expressed me said every time brother samuel when there's been a request that's come in he said i've just i've moved by faith on it and we're talking of projects that thousands of dollars at a time getting bibles and getting books printed and brother barry some of you don't know this but brother barry from way back was very instrumental in the very early stages of the message of getting the books in the hands of the people because he himself is a is a printer and so they've worked collaboratively collaboratively with another brother and they actually are getting books printed the church age book that brother george smith you know had re had had revised as far as to space things out in that church age book and it to me i want to share with you pictures because i'm on a thread that goes a thread that covers pastors not only here but also in places around the world and when you see these people standing there in zimbabwe you see them see them in honduras nicaragua you see them where they here they are receiving a shipment of books and they are praying over those books and you see them start just dancing and just rejoicing i watched there's a group in zimbabwe they were handed bibles because they didn't even have bibles and to have message books put into their hands it's it's a need you and i don't see that part of it because we have so much access to so many things here there's the need for the books and the things there so on behalf of the assembly through the missions part of it i took just a just a small part of that there and and i really felt on my heart that we need to this vision that god has put and there's there's just i know there's churches and different ones also just just funneling behind just to really support this vision and it's going forward and i actually i actually looked at some of the books that are pla printed in the other languages i sat there in the office and my heart just rejoices when i see that that the word is is being put there and i hope to share some of these things with you in the future where you see the brothers like there was a picture in colombia brother george smith was just in colombia where a shipment was received on the dock and then getting it into the people's hands and i want you to keep this in prayer because a lot of a lot of a lot of things takes place between getting it from when it lands at the dock brother barry described it it lands right here but just to get it to where paul is setting that's money that's money to get it from here just just to right there that's money and so you just pray that god would just you know continue because it's been a real smooth thing and god has opened up the doors and you know in certain places like when you take like russia and other places like that that's so tightened down but god has made a way so that a lot of the printing and things that needs to be done in there it's being done inside so we're not you know it's not a lot of worrying of those things that's coming in there like that or from other places so there's a lot of work that's being done and i i want to show you because you're that's your giving that you're giving you're a part of that with what's going on in the missions and i want you to see that because uh to see those things that are taking place and i can tell you that's it's just a you know just a small part but i wanted to stand behind that and i believe we do as a church to see that this that message and the bibles are getting out into people's hands and it's just a real something they're really rejoicing in i also want to remind you if you would to keep brother joshua in prayer brother josue this coming uh he's not here he's in kentucky here this weekend but he has the lord willing on this coming wednesday when i had spoke with him the other day this coming wednesday brother joshua is going to be having surgery on his leg so it's been a it's been a process it's been a long time they've had to wait on certain things to with the part and and really is it honed in is it just right you know and coming from have they got as the manufacturer in different ones are they honed in on it so all of those things we know that everything is in god's time and you know we know this sometimes things don't come according to our timeline and we get our hearts set on things and it doesn't happen in that time but remember god is in control and so these are just some of the things when we've just prayed about that and looked at it and i want you to keep brother joshua in prayer because lord willing this coming wednesday and i had asked him would it be okay to mention the church and he does he wants you to stand and pray with him for for wednesday that we would just also be with him the other thing i want to mention in regards to missions and i don't mean to take up some time at the time but there's nobody else this is part of pastoral duties but brother daniel uh from from ghana west africa and you know brother daniel there's a need that he texts me about and brother let me just give you a little background brother daniel is never a brother that's ever asked me for one thing i've had individual a lot of these brothers they it's very rare that they've ever asked me for one thing and then i've had people i don't know from from adam that's all of a sudden they've sent me an email here or there and this and that and you know what i do with those things i pray about it but i have individuals that i know of in other countries that i say who is this person because you have checkpoint you have czech people you know because anybody can throw around lingo and and everything else you know so at any rate with brother daniel they had purchased a piece of property uh years ago but when they purchased that piece of property there were certain logistics and things that really came about that they never could build on that property and there were certain things he said that you know he said some things that weren't checked all the way out and so they never able to build on it where they are currently meeting they're renting and they're only able to have service once a week so you know how it is when you're under a situation of renting you're you're at whatever they say and it has nothing to do with the covet it's just simply that this is how it's been so brother daniel has asked he's if he asked he said samuel if there's any way that you could help their they're looking at securing a property over there so that they can uh build a place of worship so i told brother daniel i said i will bring that before the congregation we'll we'll look at what you know we have and i wanted you to pray about it you just you give us unto the lord and what we'll just try to do here over over the time uh brother richard is there is it just go right in that box back there is it just mark missions on there is that what it is okay so if you just mark missions on it and you put it there in the box so that and i think that's what's been happening with things anyhow even when you mark missions on it it goes strictly it goes straight into the missions and the and and the account there and and so let's just let's pray about that we want we want to be a blessing uh you know and and we just we just want to be a blessing as i know brother daniel it's when it's something that just to have that and have that been where they're able to meet and and those things so if you just pray about that and then over the course uh let's say maybe of this month because we're just starting into the month of may and then perhaps by the first part of june and brother richard you can keep me right on that part of it that perhaps then by the first part of june we'll we'll be ready uh to to see what house what we can we we can be able to send over there and we'll do that so i'll let brother daniel know about that is that okay so just be in prayer about that i'll try to keep you reminded of that and i will also show pictures here of things that that's going on that i mentioned to you about brother berry i'm sorry i don't have them here before you today i've got so many of them in videos that i just got to put them all together because i want you to see it i know you'll be blessed when you see that so we just want to turn our attention to the word of the lord and i want to say it's good to see each and every one of you i see some of them see some visitors and i see you know just welcome in the name of the lord jesus christ and then god bless you amen and we just trust that the lord will just really really speak to our hearts in a very personal way this morning because we need to hear from him we need to hear from him so if we could let's just stand and just just go to the lord in a word of prayer here and if you have a need on your heart maybe just by an uplifted hand and just ask of the lord just to lord speak to my heart lord move for my knee lord heavenly father lord jesus as we stand here lord this morning oh god we are standing lord jesus with a full awareness lord that we need you and lord we believe that you're here father that's a witness lord in our hearts oh god and i'm just praying and asking lord with this congregation lord jesus as you see every need that's behind every uplifted hand lord you know father questions that are on hearts you know lord each life so intricately lord and we just pray that lord that you would help us together lord for these next few moments to just step aside lord and lord that you'll just come and just lord as it were fill these shoes lord just take the gift and speak to our hearts lord minister to our needs lord to the depths of our lives and lord for each of these requests lord for brother samson sheddy lord for brother joshua lord i pray that god that you'll just lord move lord for lord the saints of god they're in india lord for those different needs lord we see father the circumstances we see these things lord we just ask that you'll just lord move may the angel of the lord just move lord for his mother and his brother-in-law oh god in a special way and lord for brother daniel lord just providing for the saints of god right there lord for the property and the building lord we just ask oh god that lord for brother joshua as well the lord you just guide and direct lord the doctors lord jesus we believe lord that everything is lord in your time lord and father this is what we rest in lord and we just ask that god you'll just strengthen our brother lord just keep your hand upon him lord and i pray that god as you would bring him through may his body just receive it lord may it just become lord god just as part lord and work and operate just like the original lord we pray lord we ask it o god that as we look lord in your word this morning we invite you lord to come lord speak to our hearts we pray lord we just ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen amen i'm going to invite you to the scriptures in john chapter 19. just been a subject here that or a thought i should say that has been on my heart for just i don't know i'd say months and just how the inspiration of the lord just come and i won't always i pray that he'll help me to get out of the way that it can just come the way that he brought it and he could bring it to us in john 19 30 and i always love because you don't know what he's going to do when he comes and that's what i always i love that john 19 30 when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost if you turn with me to revelations chapter 1 and verse 8 here we find john on the isle of patmos and here is being revealed the coming of the lord now we know that the coming that was promised when the lord jesus even before he was here and then it's just going away he said if i go away i will send the comforter to you so there is a coming of that same life that lived and operated in the body of jesus christ that same jesus would come and would now take upon the body of his church in revelations 1 8 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty verse 17 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death amen may god bless the reading of his word as you're being seated i'd like to speak this morning on a thought just simply titled the finisher the finisher when you think of how that the lord jesus when he was here upon the upon the upon the earth and many didn't know who he was it was very strange to them it shouldn't have been but it was very strange to them it and yet when he stood there he in matthew 16 he's asking of the disciples who do men say that i the son of man am and he's asking them in many they're they're rehearsing of what many had said some say you're jeremiah some say or isaias and on and on and on they the people knew there was something different about this man called jesus they didn't know exactly what it was but they knew there's something different about this rabbi there's something different about this teacher there's something different about him than others they could now when jesus asked them this question then you find where peter will express and here's the very depth of what is inside of peter this is beyond peter's capacity his mind this is not his intellect that's responding here it's that seed that god had sown in peter's life and here in the presence of the living word of god the seed just expresses who it is that is standing there before him and he says this says thou art the christ the son of the living god and the lord jesus said blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and here's what he said i will say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it now notice the announcement i'm going to build my church there's been no speak no speaking of this prior to but he is letting it be known that this church is going to be built on the revelation of who he is personally to the individual it's one thing for you to recognize he's the savior of the world but it's got to come down to where you recognize he's your savior it's one thing to recognize he's the redeemer it's different when you recognize he's my redeemer it's one thing to say he's a deliverer but when you say he's my deliverer you see god this god's desire is that it would become personal because this is the real work of of of the lamb of god is that what god has done it would become personal to you and i he did it for me i was in mind when he did it it was it was for me that that that he died for me that he was crucified it was for me that he got back up there on that easter morning it was for me he ascended on high and the scripture says i will build my church and it expresses that the gates of hell would not prevail against it showing that all hell it would be against this revelation because this revelation when this revelation takes hold in your life i'm telling you there could be floods there can be sickness there's distress all sorts of things that would consume the natural mortal person i don't care how strong the fibers of their genetics how how the constitution of their mind it doesn't matter there's nothing that can stand against the gates of hell except the revelation of jesus christ and that's his own life it's him it can't be overthrown [Applause] and i'll say it this way what god starts he always finishes he finishes everything he starts in luke 14 28 it says for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it lest happily after he had laid the foundation is not able to finish it all that behold it began to mock him saying this man begin to build and was not able to finish i remember some years ago when we were still traveling from sandusky there was a place right there off of route 6 where used to be an airport in sandusky a small one there were some things they went to build a hotel it was supposed to be a country inn and suites a man purchased the property he began to build and what they got up they got the foundation they got the cinderblock walls all of that was right there but there was never a roof on it and it came to a place it came to a halt and it never moved beyond that as a matter of fact it came a time years and years later matter of fact it wasn't until about i think maybe five years ago or so that somebody took the property then and they tore that the remnants of what was there because you couldn't do nothing with it and now there's an actual structure there there's a business there my point was every time i would go by that i always thought of this scripture here's a person that started out with a very good intention they started out with with a program of you know if you had asked him can you see you know families coming here and staying here for cedar point and everything else they could say oh yeah we've got all this planned out and this is going to be it never made it to that so here the scripture says that when it speaks of a person beginning and it says conde they would set down and they would consider whether they have sufficient to finish let me just bring this down to you god is sufficient to finish what he started he's already counted the cost brother he doesn't have to go back and say my i missed the investment on that one or my messed up there should have never chose that one my goodness god is sufficient to finish what he started you are his workmanship in our own we don't have any self-sufficiency but god has already laid it out in his mind he finishes what he starts and he's able able who began the good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ hebrews 11 39 and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise through faith they obtained a good report they finished their course but god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect there's a completion of this you see as the old testament they were looking from there from the fall forward they were looking for the coming of the messiah there was some there was a reality that there were those who offered the lamb and it was just going through the ritual but there were others that as they offered that lamb it was more than a ritual there was something that was that was real about that there was a testimony that of faith that's what it come down to faith that when they offered it was it was by faith they didn't see all of these things they didn't see everything laid out before them but there was a witness of the holy spirit i hope you're hearing me this morning they weren't offering the lamb and said oh yeah one day there's going to come calvary and here the lamb of god is going to come on the scene they didn't see that some of the prophets that god would pick up and inspire the prophets but many of the times here's where they were at they were walking with the word that god had given them in that season and they took that word at times when they didn't feel spiritual at times when they didn't feel like i don't know what's going on but they put their faith in the word that god had said and it was god that gave them achievement through their lives when you read about the heroes of faith these were not people that walked on clouds these were not people who were free from tests and trials but these were people that all hell came against us these are people that in the midst of situations they subdued kingdoms and they did it without the holy ghost but they had faith in what god said that they would step out there in a place and say i don't know how it's going to happen i don't know how this is going to come to pass but god said so you see that's what's most important and that's where we can stand up on his word god has said so amen god has spoken who can but prophesy amen faith faith takes hold i want you to remember that faith is not what you feel amen amen faith is not even what you're conscious of faith is a settled something in your heart faith is an unconscious it's an unconscious reality you're not thinking when you go out here i wonder if the car's going to start and i wonder if i'm going to be able to drive home you're not thinking about that there's a that's a measure of faith but this this faith is even so much greater it's a faith you're not even aware of what's what's taking place because it's not conscience it's just simply it's a settledness that even when what's in front of you you can say there's no way possible your senses around you can say there's no way but there's a settledness on the inside that just drops there and you know you can't explain it but you know that's faith i would rather have that then know everything out in front of me because that right there will give me grace to conquer and go through every circumstance there's a completion of this world what what was started there what was laid out with the prophets and all you know the patriarchs and all them down through time there was there had to be a completion of that work and when the lord jesus himself as he came and here he raises from the grave you see they're all waiting on them remember they're being they're held in paradise they're they're under the blood of the lamb they can't go they can't go into heaven because the price hasn't been paid yet but when he comes and he leads captivity captive right down there in the midst of hell right in there with paradise he goes in there deposits sin the dead of it he unloads it and he begins to sin back up as he raises on that easter morning he is the keystone or what joins together the old testament saints that have been waiting on the promise he joins them into the promise and paradise is emptied out there's no more paradise and they ascend on high with him once you remember not all the old testament saints got up not all of them were elect the bible says many that slept right not all many who slept because there are those who walked with that revelation in their heart so he comes to cap this off then he comes back on the day of pentecost and in the form of the holy ghost as the son of god and he comes into a body of believers and it doesn't diminish with him going from the resurrected body that corporal body taken up on the right right hand of god now the same god the same jesus who dwelt in that body that saved jesus same life now comes and moves into a body of believers that are gathered there in the upper room what brought their gathering his resurrection what was his resurrection it was promises that lay in the word for that hour it would have done no good to build an ark that wasn't the promise of the hour that was a tithe that was fulfilled and the true ark was the lord jesus the body of jesus christ the holy ghost and they were gathered by that word and here he steps in [Music] the same son of man whom stood before peter and said who do you say i am the same one same power same fullness he stood in a bright body in that moment on the day of pentecost revealing himself that he's the son of man we know in the scriptures that there was promise that lay in there or where we see there would come in we see it in the beginning of the gentile ages of how that satan would come in getting the people off track started out with that nickelodeon spirit came in with a white horse that right real innocent satan doesn't come in like the big bad boogeyman are you with me satan doesn't come on and come in and come into your life and say i'm gonna make you lukewarm and cold and powerless i'm gonna you don't come in that way he comes in things clothed in whiteness innocency are you with me the things that you look at and say oh there's no harm in that and there's no harm in that let me just tell you something this is why it takes a holy spirit brother and sister if you don't stay in the word and stay before god like you're up to you'll find yourself in trap after trap after trap and you're wondering why why don't i have any victory in my life why don't i have this in my life we go through tests and trials that's true but there's a time we have to evaluate and say god are you the first priority in my life that's where it comes down in you the first priority you see you find how the enemy he rides in to where he comes to a place that the that that the body of the bride little by little how it's just it's just been eating away like those four stages of the of the insect that speaks there in joke it just starts a little by little you realize how the devil you'll eat a little bit away at your testimony a little bit and a little bit and a little bit you know the little bits itself you can take a great big chocolate cake you can take a little bit a little bit a little bit a little bit a little bit and you think you're getting by with it eventually somebody comes in and says hey who took this big old piece i didn't take a big piece you did little by little by little by little it's little foxes that's pearl divine the moment you think i got everything in control that's the moment of backslidden [Applause] we don't got everything under control it's under his control [Applause] so how we find this this little just trying to eat away but god made a promise our restore and we see that how the bride body how that there had to be there he would go in those dark ages go in a time there in the very dirt of denominationalism it would that seed of life would be buried but god made a promise i will restore because god has made a promise upon this rock i will build my church and he has sufficient to finish the work the devil thought he had it but you can't stop the life the life started working up come a sprout here and then come and shoot then comes a tassel then comes into the place now where we stand right back to the original grain seed the same god that can that was there that walked in flesh the same god that came in fullness on the day of pentecost is the same god who sent the message and night after night demonstrated that it is not a man that i'm the same lord jesus i'm the same god of my word i'm a god who made promises in my word it is not justice it was not a show it was not just a gift but this is a reality of the same living god let me tell you what it was announcing it's the same god that has come on the scene to cap a bride [Applause] this is where we stand he came and a bride the old testament bride was capped off they were taken that right now for the gentile bride he's come in his fullness of his life the same life has come to cap off this is the marriage of the land and i say and i say very impurposely it's not enough to recognize that god coming on the platform every night it's not enough even to just recognize that god right here in our services but it's got to come down to you recognize it's that same god in you expressing himself through adopted sons and daughters of god amen hallelujah think of this in acts chapter 1 verse 1 have as it speaks the form of treatise have i made o falafelus of all that jesus began both to do and to teach he began what god started in that body he's finishing in the bride bob glory be to god the way that he was in the group is how he is in his bride amen what he began in the initiation of redemption on the cross now is the finishing up of redemption in the body of the bride amen this is the final outpouring of the holy spirit there's not another age that's after we're living in the time of the finish this is not the time of the of the in between this is the time of the finish is that right the announcement in revelations 10 that that the mystery of god should be finished and the mystery of god is not something you learn in a school the mystery of god is the baptism of the holy ghost it's the finishing the capping off of his own life amen hebrews 12 1. wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great cloud of witnesses and we are yeah we are we're not just talking about witnesses that are back there i'm talking about witnesses right among us testimonies and lives let us lay aside every weight and the sin which just so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us very interesting as it's as it's wrote here with patience it deals with a constant endurance yes just in case you don't know or haven't experienced it everything's not hippie skippy sorry those are only words i have all right because there's times you have to press when you don't feel right with patience running this race it's not a sprint this is not a sprint that's right you know how it is you see people sometimes they'll start off you know and you know i remember back in the days you know when we have field days at school and things like that never signed up for any running events but you remember how they would you know and you'd see guys start out and when when i played football you'd have certain timed runs that we had to do in the in the summertime and things like that you remember that brother dave you have certain timed runs that you'd have to do or whatever more you see guys start out you know the lineman had to run this amount in this amount of time in the backs and everything else i don't think i could say i'm glad i'm not a bad but they had to run it in a certain amount of time you'd see guys man they would start out right away like that pretty soon by the time the fifth lap come here they are the ones walking you know why they started out without thinking of sufficiency to finish they didn't consider amen and see this is this is the part it's not how fast it's the steadiness that's right amen we're not in it god's not interested in how fast somebody it's a steadiness are you with me folks are not interested in somebody all of a sudden one once and once a month they they deem themselves and they appear very spiritual god's not interested in that he's interested in lives that are steady weak in steady doesn't mean you're always on the top of the mountain but it's a steadiness because you know as a believer there's times where you feel like lower than the valley but here you are [Applause] there you are pressing on you don't maybe feel like getting up but here the leg comes out of the bed and here you might feel like my i i feel discouraged but there's something down on the inside a little something that'll reach and hold what is it it's the steadiness of the finisher he finishes what he starts [Applause] so just because you can you know don't let the devil try to put anything on your wealth you're not a spiritual so-and-so or you're not you don't compare yourself with that way you've seen you and i've seen people all through the years all of a sudden they come in mine they've got a tongue or they've got a great prophecy for the church and they've got this and you want to say where have you been when the going has been taught where faith has needed to be manifest where have you been so whatever you have it's for you if there's a word that word's for you go look in the mirror and rehearse rehearse it to yourself brother samuel that's free it comes with whipped cream on top it's the truth god's not interested this is not an hour of display this is an hour that requires steadfast steadiness that's just walking on notice we're not running to the beat of onward christian soldiers we're marching to the beat of onward christian soldiers taking promises one by one but one by one [Applause] a lot between the lines there looking unto jesus the offering the finisher of our faith so this is how we run it looking unto jesus amen amen the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god you can't look anywhere in the scriptures and not see and recognize that god is over it all he said here he would reveal himself to john put his right hand on john and say fear not he was revealing himself as the mighty conqueror he was letting john know you don't have nothing to fear i've conquered sickness i've conquered death i've conquered hell i've conquered the grave i've conquered it all and he's revealing himself to john i am the mighty conqueror and you're in me and i'm in you you have nothing to fear he reveals it's a finished work if you've ever been healed at any time in your life it's not because god himself has come and had to pay a price or had to do something for you it's where your faith sometimes even be um it's unbeknown right here but your faith would rise into that place and here now virtue comes there from the reality of a finished work hallelujah amen sometimes i know we we want things sometimes like this sometimes those are times where things come like that right other times there's times when we have to stand and you have to battle and you have to just stand there on the word you're not defeated you're standing on the word it'd be better to stand there than be in heaven or upon this earth because heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail peter spoke by inspiration the word of the lord endureth forever you see this is why to be standing upon the word standing in him look unto jesus [Music] this word look here it's a word that deals with looking away from one thing and add another man see it's looking it's looking beyond when jesus could say through isaiah look unto me all the ends of the earth is that right the word ends of the earth brother brown picks it up he said what that is he said it says ends of the earth he said it what it is it's ends of world civilization where you have ends that have come ends that have taken place there's been ends and it's always at the ending is where he steps in at his fullness look unto me all your ends of the earth so to look from one place to another so there would have to be in this in the hour that we are living in it would have to be that god would supply and he did supply eyes because a prophet is a seer and to be able to catch that to catch where the church is at where the church must be in order for rapture so it has to take eyes to be able to see that not these eyes but spiritual eyes and to be able to express to you and i this is who you really are it it brings us beyond just looking out and looking at calvary just to look at an event that took place but to also see that through calvary and through the resurrection you were included in this he came with the purpose to set us free he came to bring deliverance he came to break the hold of sin he came that that same life might come back to you and i as believers that's the life that belonged to you and i am it's to see that and to get into the blood get into the blood to where you stand as a redeemed son and daughter of god you stand there with a reality of where you stand there that he is the author and the finisher of my faith the same god who started to work in my life is the same god finishing that work in my life let me tell you the holy spirit when god has deposited that of his own life inside of you everything you have need of including the rapture is already inside of you you're healing it's already inside of you healing's not an external thing healing is what already lays in you i want brother sam how do i release that drink drink drink take in take in just just be an absorbent of that amen is that right so as a christian we a christian doesn't look at what he sees abraham could not be focused on what he saw because what he saw he kept on getting weaker and weaker and weaker who against hope believed in him what was going on but he looked to what god had said if you were to ask abraham how's this going to right let me just bring it down if it was up to you and i to choose and you and i would look and say let me see let me see we'll be a good person i mean we need we need a you know we can't choose anybody who's barren i mean surely that wouldn't bring the promise forth you and i would try to choose out and look out somebody that would be able to fulfill the promise but god doesn't choose based on that his choosing's not in time he already knew before the foundational world you can look at all of your own inabilities well i've got this and i've got that and i've got this but god himself specializes in taking lives that with all of our weaknesses and all of our inabilities can surrender it all into his hands and say lord i need you lord this is what you said in your word and i'm looking to you to fulfill that and god says yes now we're getting into the right place he's a finisher and a finisher is one this very word in this scripture means one who is perfection he is the perfection of the church he is our perfection the scripture would say in hebrews 6 1 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god paul is dealing with that that there would be a progression in the life where god has started and how god and we know we've looked at this how god has started to work but to see there is a going on into perfection and this very word perfection is the word finisher let us go on to the finisher just stay with me a few moments let's go on to the finisher you see he's the high priest of his own word and the high priest is one who's been chosen to minister on our behalf to minister of the word to you and i it's not the it's not the man samuel browning it's the high priest himself ministering to our life just what you and i have need of he's been set aside to minister to move upon our life you see it's god calling you and i to perfection we know we've got to be perfect in order to stand there is that right but that perfection is not a perfection in ourself of our own efforts they'll never be able to be achieved on our own the law could make nothing perfect and the law was based on the will of man the will of man can make nothing perfect even when it came to the garden of gethsemane when the lord jesus stood there he said nevertheless not my will thine will be done he had to surrender his will to the will of god which was the word when he did that then now comes forth the victory victory right there in his life right there in the garden of gethsemane that's where the lion prevailed that's the very place that he prevails in your life is when you lay down and say not my will thine will be done i'm trying to be a good christian right trying to do this but just lay down your will and accept what he's already done he is the finisher you've got a finisher on the inside you've got a finisher it's calling you and out of perfection this is why you and i you can't settle down right amen you just say it's not it's not just something to where you can just settle down and well i've got it made her we've got this material it's a call to perfection amen there's a longing within our life like paul could say i count not myself to have apprehended i count not myself to be perfect meaning that i've got it all made but he said i press toward the mark amen i'm pressing towards the finish line amen everything that's within me so nothing we're perfect in him nothing can be taken away from him in the in the new birth the work of the holy spirit in our life a complete experience where the old man has died the new man there's a new man on the inside the desires of the world are gone there's a desire it's it's him it's him that you're in love with it's him that you want to please you know you're not the same person that you used to be there's a reality on the inside there's a life there's it's a part of him that's being revealed from in your life i want you to i want you to catch this here but our character our character itself is what's molded through the test and the trials remember what he said it's finished he paid he paid the price the work the fulfillment of what had to be done was done in order that this work could come into our life yes through tests and trials our lives are molded amen that he in his infinite wisdom allows to come to pass but the work of the new birth is what brings us into the perfection of god amen and we stand perfect in him this is why he can see no sin once that life has passed there underneath the blood and you're standing there with a confidence that you know i didn't do this god's done this you know what you used to be and what you are now amen and you know what god has done within your life yes are you are you with me there's tests and there's trials that come there's things that you learn and you grow from there's traps yes that's been said that you look back and have to say father forgive me there's things that that that we that you experience within your life and through test and trial even in the midst of tests and trials our humanity at the very times of tests and trials our humanity shows the weakness and the frailty you would think if god if somebody was going to put an awesome treasure into something you would look at and say what could i put this treasure in you would want to search out the best maybe the best vase or the best cabinet or whatever more you know what is when somebody has maybe a piece of glass or or they have a something and they they want to make sure they put it in something that that it expresses the value of it it's something that you know can hold it right there in view but god himself did not choose something of concrete something a mortar but god chose earth and vessels vessels that if you drop them they shatter but god chose earth and vessels that it may be that it's not of us it's of his power [Applause] it's not us it's him god chose it that way you and i maybe would have put it in concrete but god said i don't want an organization in life i want a life that's able to be moved with it being an earthen vessel sometimes our feelings get hurt sometimes our spirit gets low come on somebody there's times where our spirit has got wounded as much as our body has got wounded but it doesn't take away from the treasure of the holy ghost from the inside if it hadn't been for god on my side oh i think of that old song if it hadn't been for the lord tell me where would i be it's a confidence that we have in him let me just try to wrap this up here he revealed himself we read there in the book of revelations he reveals himself in revelations 3 14 he's the amen be man is the soviet amendment the amen is the end of the statement amen the new birth is the amen in your life it's a man it's god amen it's a finished work are you with me do we have to have me molded yes we're molded but it's a finished work on the inside notice how he speaks this these things sayeth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god this is standing as he would reveal himself as the author of this new creation now i want to say this to you as he would reveal himself as the author this is what beginner means if the author is present then it means the finisher is here if the author is present then it means the finisher is here he's not re the mystery is he's not revealing himself in a new thing he's not revealing himself well he's something different he said i am alpha and omega he which was which is and which is to come saith the lord almighty so he is the one who started the church he's the one who finishes the church he's the one that authored the life that you and i now have in him he's also the one that will bring us to the perfection of the redemption of our body amen amen oh i feel like giving up you can't give up amen come on now you can't stop something you didn't start come on now you're no different you're no different than anybody else that ever lived and walked upon the earth and you feel like you know what i don't know if i can take another step i don't know if i can make make another step but you can't give out it's calling you to perfection to a redemption of the body it's calling you to the body change to the rapture to the millennia to the future home it's not the power of man it's the power of god the finisher that's right here working in our midst the same good that revealed himself as the offer and stabilize the church is the same god in the evening talent that has revealed himself i'm the finisher to stabilize the church for rapture don't fear little sister there's a man here that turned on the lights [Applause] [Music] hallelujah i want to say it like this when they came into the place when israel coming back out of babylon remember they were down there for 70 years and here there came a time of them coming back into the land and how god would reveal himself through zechariah you have the different prophets and i i don't have time to labor upon these points of where i was but you'll look even at zechariah and has the prophets and has they stood there let me read this in zechariah 4 6. then he answered and spake unto me now remember the angel of the lord has zechariah as a prophet and he has him looking at the seven golden candlesticks and he asked zechariah what is this zechariah said i don't know you know and here's what he speaks of this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you this type of zerubbabel it's a type of christ amen because it would go on to say even in the book of haggai that he would speak regarding cerebral i will make him as a signet meaning a seal and you know what a seal is it's a finished word this is what i will make here so this was a type a shadow of something that was pointing to the work of christ that christ himself upon this rock i'll build my church down the foundation that would be laid is that of jesus christ what did paul say no other foundation can a man lay is that right it would also be expressed through the word of god there was a man who built his house on the sand one who built it on the rock the floods came made no difference they got the same kind of beating of wind rain storms but the one on the sand was washed away but the one upon the rock stood through all the tests and all the trials and all the wind and all the rain oh my you might have felt like the tricking and you can hear the cricking of the boards and everything but it was founded on the rock this is a this was laid out to show that the church of the living god would be built think of all the scriptures we direct it would be built by the power of the living god it would be god a symbol his children god building remember as paul would write we are built for a habitation of the spirit but then we would find there was a time in here that in the midst of this time when they came back and some of you perhaps recall there's times when we've ministered on these things but it just there was a time that came here that they stopped working all right now they were commissioned to build this temple right they laid the foundation but then there's accusations that started to come their way right lies right that started to be told right are you hearing me this is in ezra nehemiah haggai but you find lies started being told all right we could really preach on this satan is the father of lies he'd like for you to believe the lies that he's telling about you are you with me he's got a lot of things to try to say and wants to try to put out but this is why as we've been looking at you're walking with a real confidence you know i know in whom i have beliefs and satan would like to put things in and try to hinder they were 15 years the work of god ceased right and look what happened in this 15 years they became occupied on other things it became occupied on so many other things so god listen this shows something here god is a finisher he came back around and here was those men jerubal standing right there and the rest of them and haggai comes and he begins to speak to him the bible says when haggai the lord's messenger spake in the lord's message and the first words that he told him i am with you i'm with you they were so discouraged they were so despondent they didn't even know where do i even start right now it's been 15 years are you hearing me where do i even go they felt so discouraged they listened sometimes their discouragement come and then you're discouraged that you were discouraged then you were discouraged somebody go help me preach now you get you're getting discouraged you're down at your time of discouragement right yeah case you haven't realized you're a human still [Applause] you're you're not you're not superman and superwoman not that you want to be but you understand what i'm saying there's times when you get down in your humanity and satan kept coming at him with the purpose the bible says was to frustrate the work of god means to break the purpose of it he wants to break the purpose he's tried to discourage them by lies and accusations and coming at them but here comes god on the scene he begins to remind them of their purpose of where god brought them from what does god come do god comes with the truth and the truth cast out the lies there's nothing as powerful as the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the truth comes and it dismantles satan's lies and his accusations these people weren't guilty of that they weren't guilty of what they were being accused of but here came god god said i'm with you and the bible says the prophets through the ministry strengthened the hands of the people they begin to work you know what they did they had to go back to go up to the mountain and get wood they just had there's got to be a starting spot right right so the word of god encourage them just just take the steps going back up get started getting the wood bringing the word wood down start building start assembling yes and then when it was all said and done and here stand the temple and the glory of god filled the temple that temple was in no comparison to the first temple that solomon built but the elders wept because this temple was a fulfillment of prophecy that god said where you've went away i'd bring you back home again i'd bring you right back here it was a testimony of the finishing work of the lord jesus christ to you amen when he looks at you you see the word when it comes like you think of how god was even bringing it right here last last sunday and this is how the word comes the word comes to let you know of who you are it's something that raises within you it raises in a life that even if a life in itself let's say a person they don't have the baptism of the holy ghost but that word it has to tell you who you are has to tell you what belongs to you and you rise to that place to say lord jesus i receive what belongs to me it's got to be the standard of the word to let you know who you are it's him that lets us know who we are and to think of how that here when paul could write that whom he's called we predestinated he called and who he called he justified who he's justified he's already glorified i would say that here throughout this building there's not one of us that would think of ourselves as a finished work right amen but god already sees you as a finished product he's not looking down here in time but he looks from eternity to eternity remember he is sufficient to finish what he started he knew all of this would come in here in between and it's god himself who is moving in our lives yes it's god dealing with our lives we just leave you with this but it's not god picking us up and moving us right amen remember and i know i keep rem i keep coming back to this services after services it's just something that's so precious and brother branham was sitting there in that house he could not tell so-and-so nor could he go and put things where they needed to be put right he couldn't say hey you need to be sitting over there no no no no somebody take the chair away from they don't need to be there hey the glasses need to be over here or the handkerchief or somebody's they gotta come in that door that's right let me just leave you with this the vision is sure amen nobody could put that handkerchief or that person there or those glasses there that all had to come about in the time that's right if you and i can put ourselves up maybe you're the handkerchief maybe i'm the glasses when the word is coming forth as we take that word in listen friends it's got to be us for taking that word in amen it's not about what she's i don't understand all this i don't it's just take it in and be and be prayerful with it take it in and let it be one with your life let it just say god move me in position let the world just move in my life with things in position where they need to be and let god bring things into position so that you can stand i can stand yes like paul stood and paul could stand brother aaron at the end and say i finished my course i've done i've run what god's asked me to do the lord jesus could say in john 17 i finished the work thou gavest me to me but that was only the beginning as acts 1 says that which he began to do he finished what he was supposed to do each and every one of us have a part have a purpose there's a course everything within it and it takes the word itself moving in our life let's just laying ourselves open to the word and let the word have the right away amen i said this to you over and over but it's true if listen friends god's not going to accept excuses if i don't understand it when you can come to him just like zachariah said thou knowest what this meanest what does this mean and god himself will always come he'll reveal himself remember they walked with him in luke 24. cleopas and a friend walked with him in luke 24. but then they invited him amen come in yes amen come here and when he came in he did something that made it known this is this is who it is yes it's him it's him and just it's taking the word in let the word let it change our lives you realize friends it wouldn't matter how much of like the word where they could set
