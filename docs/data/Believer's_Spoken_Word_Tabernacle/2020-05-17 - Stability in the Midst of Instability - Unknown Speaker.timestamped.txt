[43:41] service there and just good to see each
[43:45] and every one of you and we certainly
[43:48] are here under in somewhat different
[43:51] circumstances but I'm glad that we're in
[43:53] the presence of one who doesn't change
[43:56] amen no matter what what circumstances
[44:01] take place or what goes on I'm grateful
[44:04] that God is still the same and he's in
[44:07] control amen
[44:09] so we just want to say it's so good see
[44:11] some some more faces here this morning
[44:14] and so good to see each and every one of
[44:18] you and those of you that that are
[44:20] streaming even though we can't see your
[44:22] face may God bless you richly we just
[44:26] want to turn our attention
[44:27] amen to the word of the Lord but before
[44:30] we do let's just look to the Lord in a
[44:32] word of Prayer and ask that he'll just
[44:35] come he knows what our needs are he
[44:37] knows just how to speak to us and I'm
[44:40] counting on him I know you are too that
[44:42] he would come and deliver the word to
[44:45] our hearts
[44:46] father as we just wouldn't come in that
[44:51] and precious name that you have given to
[44:54] us Lord the precious name of our Lord
[44:57] Jesus Christ you said ask the Father
[45:00] anything in my name and I'll do it Lord
[45:05] what a reality this is to our hearts
[45:10] Lord we we are standing here this
[45:14] morning whether we're here those that
[45:18] are streaming there are needs Lord that
[45:21] are among us Lord we need more than just
[45:26] just a word we need a word from you Lord
[45:31] we need you to come and to speak to our
[45:35] hearts Lord you're the one that we're
[45:38] looking to this morning no matter what
[45:41] the need is no matter what the situation
[45:44] may right now God it just be set in our
[45:48] hearts Lord speak to my heart let my
[45:55] eyes be open to see you know father I
[45:59] ask that God that you'll draw near you
[46:03] said if we were drawn on to you you
[46:06] would draw man to us Lord as your profit
[46:10] would take that scripture over and over
[46:12] again he would deal with it Lord how it
[46:15] begins even with our thoughts to where
[46:18] that even in our thinking
[46:20] to cast aside any thought any negative
[46:25] thoughts any thumb that would arise
[46:27] against the word any thought that would
[46:28] come to say that I'm not worthy any
[46:32] fault that would come Lord that is
[46:35] indirect contrary to your voice we ask
[46:39] Lord that you would just come Lord in
[46:43] our midst
[46:44] speak to our hearts may you do a work in
[46:47] every life this morning those that are
[46:50] sick in their body God may they receive
[46:52] a touch from you Lord we just ask Lord
[46:57] that you'll minister to every life now
[46:59] help us to get out of the way that you
[47:03] could be the glorified one among us Lord
[47:05] we pray in Jesus name Amen amen
[47:10] [Music]
[47:12] let's turn in our Bibles if you have
[47:15] them to Hebrews chapter 12 and I just
[47:21] want to just to express or to speak some
[47:26] things that God has really put on my
[47:30] heart here you are in the first part of
[47:33] the week and just of where we are even
[47:38] in the setting of the world and the
[47:41] setting of time and knowing the things
[47:45] that we are facing we must face and I
[47:50] just I just feel just such a function of
[47:53] the Holy Spirit just to begin into
[47:57] looking at this here this morning so
[48:02] here in verse 25 Paul writes see that ye
[48:07] refused not him that speaketh for if
[48:11] they escape not who refused him that
[48:15] spake on earth much more shall not we
[48:18] escape if we turn away from him that
[48:20] speaketh from heaven whose voice then
[48:24] shook the earth but now he hath promised
[48:27] saying yet once more I shake not the
[48:30] Earth only but also heaven
[48:34] and this word yet once more signifies
[48:38] the removing of those things that are
[48:42] shaken as of things that are made that
[48:47] those things which cannot be shaken may
[48:50] remain look at this in verse 28 what a
[48:55] comfort wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[49:00] which cannot be moved let us have grace
[49:05] whereby we may serve God except ibly
[49:10] with reverence and godly fear for our
[49:13] God is a consuming fire may God bless
[49:18] you bless the reading of the word as
[49:21] you're being seated I want to begin to
[49:28] look out here this morning and I know
[49:32] there's no way that will I'll get
[49:33] through and in any way the thought but I
[49:39] want to begin to look at this thought on
[49:43] stability in the midst of instability
[49:48] stability in unstable times and that's
[49:56] exactly where we are it has already been
[50:01] unstable times because no matter where
[50:06] when man thinks that everything is just
[50:10] right or it's good but yet God shows
[50:13] that just all it takes is one little
[50:16] thing and it can take away something
[50:19] that is thought to be so strong we've
[50:22] we've heard that you know and over the
[50:26] months and things like that of where the
[50:28] economy was at and all these things and
[50:32] I'm not going to get into all the the
[50:35] parts behind that because there's a lot
[50:37] of things that that we could say but I
[50:41] want to deal with it even in the part
[50:43] that you can see that here comes
[50:45] something along
[50:47] to the naked eye it's unable to be seen
[50:52] it's invisible and something like this
[50:56] that can come along in such a measure
[50:58] like this and then to see not just here
[51:01] within our nation but around the world
[51:04] the whole economy of the world and
[51:07] everyone else and really from the things
[51:10] that when I just conversing with some of
[51:14] the brethren from overseas that stood
[51:16] here in this pulpit you know there are
[51:20] things that you know where they
[51:22] certainly are not even tapping in or
[51:26] having some of the things that we would
[51:28] have perhaps available here within the
[51:30] states and things and you find there's a
[51:34] lot of things to go into within that but
[51:36] I want to say that in this manner we
[51:40] recognize that within the time that
[51:43] we're living in that we've got to have a
[51:46] place that we're resting in because I'm
[51:52] going to tell you right up front there's
[51:54] a lot of things that are being spoken
[51:56] and be expressed that people have no
[51:58] grounding of what's being said we know
[52:04] no more today than what we knew in the
[52:06] beginning and that's from the
[52:10] professionals now when we look at this
[52:15] this is where that our our lives and our
[52:18] hearts we we thank God just as you know
[52:21] we're the brand said the doctors they're
[52:23] God's agents thank God for them and we
[52:26] you know yes we we pray that there would
[52:29] be something of a treatment vaccine
[52:32] what-have-you but that's not where our
[52:34] faith is that and I'm just going to say
[52:37] it like this that that that that in
[52:39] itself
[52:41] would be only temporary but there is a
[52:45] real stabilizer that is present because
[52:50] we are we are facing and in unstable
[52:53] times but we do have a sure foundation
[52:58] and so I think of this statement that
[53:03] the Prophet makes here in Christ is
[53:05] revealed in his own words and I want you
[53:08] to listen this this which were familiar
[53:10] with but I want you to listen what he is
[53:13] speaking to us he said now the
[53:15] stabilisers has been put on the ship
[53:21] don't nobody get scared see we're
[53:25] already in unstable times I thought
[53:29] about that the other day dear Lord let
[53:30] nobody sneeze I always have a cough but
[53:38] you see what it's caused your Lord don't
[53:42] let nobody sneeze in a store much less
[53:47] than this church building now I'm not
[53:50] making light of anything what I'm trying
[53:52] to show you is is the realities of these
[53:56] things that are all around us there is a
[53:59] stabilizer present the stabilizers have
[54:06] been put on the ship great
[54:10] fearful ways are out here before us but
[54:14] we know just beyond that wave yonder
[54:17] we're nearing the shore we're nearing
[54:20] the shore just stay stabled just stay in
[54:25] the word stay with God no matter how you
[54:29] feel oh my no matter how you feel no
[54:35] matter how you feel what anything else
[54:39] stay right with the word let it stay
[54:45] stable when you see all these great big
[54:49] old clouds around us and storms coming
[54:51] and atomic bombs and everything else
[54:54] there
[54:54] talking about but our stabilizer he is
[54:57] right straight in the word God said it
[55:01] would be here he made a promise in
[55:04] Malachi 4 it would be here and that
[55:08] promise as we see its unfolded in the
[55:11] Gospels and even through the Old
[55:13] Testament into the new God promised that
[55:15] it would be here the stabilizer
[55:18] will crest look at this will crest every
[55:22] one of them will go right over the top
[55:25] of them yes indeed they can't sink us
[55:29] they can't drown us what's where he goes
[55:32] you put us in the grave
[55:35] we'll come out again what this is not
[55:39] the real me this is not the real me this
[55:44] is only a possession this is not my
[55:46] inheritance
[55:47] it's my possession I have received the
[55:50] earnest you have received the earnest of
[55:53] our inheritance Joshua has come and
[55:57] divided to us our portion we have
[56:01] representation in the heavenlies
[56:06] you put us in the grave we'll come out
[56:08] again that's just all there is to it
[56:11] there ain't no way in the world to keep
[56:14] it down here we'll crest
[56:16] every one of them cuz our great chief
[56:18] captain is calling at the other side now
[56:23] I don't know if you've ever looked at it
[56:27] or thought about what a stabilizer is
[56:30] but I have I got to looking at it
[56:33] included a link here when our notes
[56:35] would go out you know the ships
[56:38] especially theirs they have active and
[56:40] passive stabilizers and the reality is
[56:43] especially when you get into a big ship
[56:45] cargo ship or you know cruise ship and
[56:48] whatever it is when the waves themselves
[56:51] when the waves are coming and they in
[56:54] the you know the higher they get that
[56:57] starts affecting that ship and I want
[56:59] you to think about it the way they
[57:01] placed it in there when you're on one of
[57:03] those cruise ships which I never plan on
[57:04] being on one they just said that you
[57:07] know you want to make sure that your
[57:08] glass of water your glass of pop or
[57:11] whatever they referred to that it's not
[57:13] going off there you know the table
[57:15] that's why you have stabilizers what the
[57:18] stabilizers do they have those that are
[57:20] fixed that's one time it's called
[57:22] passive and it sits underneath the
[57:25] waterline you you can't see these
[57:27] stabilizers above the surface but
[57:29] they're actually beneath the surface of
[57:31] the water and they're actually there
[57:34] they're there to kind of catch and if
[57:36] the wave is coming this way you know
[57:38] that if the ship would go up kind of
[57:40] like this well that is there to kind of
[57:42] balance it out and kind of give a little
[57:43] bit of equilibrium and bring it back
[57:45] into the center of gravity but in these
[57:48] bigger ships and brother this ain't no
[57:51] this ain't a little boat us four no more
[57:54] this is the old ship design and we don't
[57:59] whinny more than just fixed stabilizers
[58:03] we need the active stabilizers and an
[58:06] active stabilizer is one that is
[58:08] actually controlled by a gyroscopic
[58:11] system that's a big word for me even to
[58:13] say but what it means is that there is
[58:15] something on the inside brother Joey
[58:17] that sense
[58:18] is that even the strength or the force
[58:21] of that wave and it's able to move that
[58:24] stabilizer so that it rolls and balances
[58:28] out that way so that the ship remains
[58:30] steady in the midst of that time oh I'm
[58:35] glad that we've got a stabilizer in the
[58:39] old ship aside I'm glad we got a
[58:42] stabilizer in our life it's not a fix
[58:45] but brother it's a living person this is
[58:48] not a good song he said he when he the
[58:51] Spirit of Truth has come he will lead
[58:53] and guide you stabilize you through
[58:55] every storm we're never promised that we
[58:58] were going to be exempt from storms god
[59:02] never promised us that we would be
[59:04] exempt from sickness as a prophet put it
[59:07] he said we're not immune from these
[59:09] things but he did saved us right here
[59:11] when it comes I'll take it from the
[59:14] midst of you he promised over and over
[59:17] again I'm telling you you could stand
[59:19] right here and preach the atonement of
[59:21] divine healing oh my the scripture after
[59:25] scripture after scripture where God has
[59:28] said spoken that when sickness comes
[59:31] when disease comes the Lord will heal
[59:34] thee come on somebody you say what about
[59:40] if a wave takes somebody that wave in
[59:43] might there might be it seemed to be a
[59:44] sinking or drowning but remember we're
[59:46] believers are not kept from death
[59:48] believers are kept in death yea though I
[59:52] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[59:54] death thou art with me I will not fear
[59:59] nor glory be to God this is our this is
[1:00:03] our refuge this is stability in unstable
[1:00:07] times I think we can agree and I don't
[1:00:14] want to dwell so much on this but I
[1:00:16] think we can agree that even on your
[1:00:20] phone run your computer or whatever
[1:00:22] you've got there are headlines
[1:00:26] that lack they are like drip lines of
[1:00:29] fear but the stabilizers are put in
[1:00:42] place to keep this ship from capsizing
[1:00:45] what's what look here
[1:00:47] what Jesus said in Luke 21 verse 25
[1:00:50] there shall be signs in the sun and in
[1:00:54] the moon and in the stars so in the
[1:00:58] heavens there's going to be signs there
[1:00:59] are and upon the earth here's the signs
[1:01:03] on the earth distress of nations that's
[1:01:09] been going on for years Russia has come
[1:01:14] right across right not just not just a
[1:01:16] few little bit but right next to our
[1:01:18] shoreline with their submarines flying
[1:01:21] with their planes over our airspace
[1:01:24] that's been going on these things have
[1:01:28] been taking place there's a distress
[1:01:32] among nations a perplexity among nations
[1:01:37] notice with perplexity the sea and the
[1:01:41] waves roaring we know he's fine think
[1:01:44] about over the years how many times we
[1:01:46] talk they're talking about tsunamis I
[1:01:50] mean in case you know you know if you
[1:01:53] haven't caught them let you know maybe
[1:01:54] one of the latest headlines that they
[1:01:56] just want to you know it just happens to
[1:01:58] be let's throw it in here with all the
[1:02:00] rest of these these headlines right now
[1:02:01] the weather prophets that's what brother
[1:02:04] BAM called them meteor mountain
[1:02:05] meteorologists they never repent for
[1:02:09] their false reports either come on now
[1:02:13] you know the weather prophets are saying
[1:02:16] this year's hurricane season is going to
[1:02:18] be awful bad
[1:02:23] now it ain't that weren't ignoring it
[1:02:25] but my stock isn't in a man's prediction
[1:02:33] we have been instructed by God when we
[1:02:37] begin to see these things lift up your
[1:02:42] heads because your Redemption draweth
[1:02:45] nigh
[1:02:46] oh yeah men's heart look at this
[1:02:51] men's hearts failing them for fear for
[1:02:56] looking after those things which are
[1:02:58] coming on the earth for the powers of
[1:03:01] heaven shall be shaken matthew 24:4 and
[1:03:07] jesus answered and said to them take
[1:03:09] heed that no man deceive you for many
[1:03:12] shall come in my name saying I am Christ
[1:03:14] and shall deceive many
[1:03:16] their anointed all right but their
[1:03:19] teaching is not according to the word
[1:03:21] notice this is coupled as a sign and in
[1:03:25] this ye shall hear verse 6 hear of wars
[1:03:29] and rumors of wars What did he say
[1:03:34] see that ye be not troubled you know
[1:03:42] that tells me don't be feeding on it
[1:03:46] don't be digesting it because once you
[1:03:51] feed on you think on what you think on
[1:03:54] your talk on and you know all of that
[1:03:57] comes on that's what you live on I'm
[1:04:01] talking about stability in unstable
[1:04:04] times come on now for all these things
[1:04:10] must come to pass but the end is not yet
[1:04:14] for nation shall rise against nation
[1:04:18] Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall
[1:04:21] be famines and pestilences not just one
[1:04:27] pestilences and earthquakes in diverse
[1:04:31] places
[1:04:33] Nevada Utah the one in Nevada that
[1:04:39] they're saying this week they're saying
[1:04:41] hey that that that fault line is you
[1:04:43] know they're they're comparing it to the
[1:04:45] San Andreas and how much it's overdue I
[1:04:47] mean these things for years you know you
[1:04:51] get little messages about the different
[1:04:53] seismic activity that are taking place
[1:04:55] because there's there's sites that you
[1:04:56] can you know that'll let you know the
[1:04:58] different things that are taking place
[1:05:00] but you look even the part of it here I
[1:05:03] can remember even a few years back and
[1:05:06] even just sometimes we had earthquakes
[1:05:07] right here I remember one time you know
[1:05:10] it woke me up laying in my bed it woke
[1:05:14] me up man either somebody pick on my
[1:05:16] house up and moving it around or there's
[1:05:19] ground moving divers places different
[1:05:22] places understand they're looking they
[1:05:26] got everything focused in here
[1:05:27] but things are happening all around why
[1:05:31] man cannot control it they can try to
[1:05:38] predict this and predict that and
[1:05:40] predict that man can't control it let me
[1:05:44] tell you something all of that is
[1:05:46] nervous frustrations the earth is in
[1:05:51] birth pains the earth is groaning and
[1:05:56] travailing hallelujah what a time that
[1:06:05] we're living in nation against nation
[1:06:07] when have you seen it back over the past
[1:06:10] years we've seen the things this nation
[1:06:12] and this nation where was left alone now
[1:06:15] you have somebody goes in they remove
[1:06:17] this dictator they removed this one they
[1:06:19] removed that when they removed that one
[1:06:22] and we're becoming the police of the
[1:06:24] world you know why we're a puppet Rome
[1:06:33] has no army of their own come on
[1:06:38] somebody
[1:06:39] they have no army of their own the Bible
[1:06:43] talks about how that they can make
[1:06:45] miracles how that he speak of blasphemy
[1:06:48] Essenes make miracles take place that's
[1:06:50] calling atomic bombs down out of the sky
[1:06:55] you see these are things that knit not
[1:06:58] let you know I'm not a conspiracy I'm
[1:07:00] not a conspiracy that same anointing is
[1:07:04] the same anointing that's led people
[1:07:05] away because they start challenging
[1:07:09] everything how do I know what's right
[1:07:11] how do I know what how do I know how do
[1:07:13] I know certainly it keeps on going I'm
[1:07:16] not a conspirator the reality is this is
[1:07:19] settled within the scripture we realize
[1:07:25] the time that we are living in the hour
[1:07:28] that we're living in but it's not what I
[1:07:30] want you to understand I want you to
[1:07:33] understand this right here of what's
[1:07:36] being spoken in the scripture is by no
[1:07:38] means calling for you nor should it
[1:07:41] cause somebody to walk around well it's
[1:07:44] just gonna get worse it's just going to
[1:07:47] be bad no our addictions drawing nigh oh
[1:07:51] brother Samuel who knows you know I may
[1:07:54] never get married
[1:07:55] I may never dis and I may never have
[1:07:57] children and I may never have quit
[1:07:59] dwelling on all that that you don't even
[1:08:01] have no control over no man knoweth the
[1:08:04] day nor the hour well what should I do
[1:08:08] keep planting potatoes if you knew he
[1:08:16] was going to come to this morning guess
[1:08:19] where you'd be right here the rapture is
[1:08:29] not gathering people down at Cape
[1:08:30] Canaveral you understand these are thing
[1:08:37] this is the Enoch was not taken Enoch
[1:08:40] did not all of a sudden get an e-zpass
[1:08:42] and now he's on the turnpike home now
[1:08:45] this is my day I'm no longer taking the
[1:08:48] backcountry roads I'm gonna take the
[1:08:50] turnpike he walked the same way every
[1:08:53] day come on now he had a testimony that
[1:08:59] he pleased caught he didn't get his
[1:09:01] e-zpass or his token on a certain time
[1:09:03] in this all of a sudden take a certain
[1:09:05] Road he already had it he had been
[1:09:08] walking with God what are you saying
[1:09:12] brother say no I'm saying but even while
[1:09:14] you're cutting the grass you can be
[1:09:16] taken come on now I mean God has all
[1:09:24] this stuff in control he has everything
[1:09:27] in control but look what the scripture
[1:09:29] says all these are the beginning of
[1:09:32] Sorrows
[1:09:39] this is just like it was in the days of
[1:09:42] Noah it speaks of the condition of the
[1:09:45] owl we're living and you realize the
[1:09:47] scripture it tells us it gives in the
[1:09:50] day in Luke 17 in the days of Noah and
[1:09:52] in the days of lot
[1:09:54] it speaks of these two times in the days
[1:09:57] of lot in the days of Noah why because
[1:09:59] there was a call to come out of and go
[1:10:03] into it's Redemption so we're living in
[1:10:09] the time where the people the spirit of
[1:10:12] destruction is upon the people
[1:10:17] people just don't disagree with you
[1:10:20] anymore they want to destroy you
[1:10:22] they can't just walk away from truth
[1:10:25] they want to destroy it you know what
[1:10:28] they're anointed with the spirit of
[1:10:30] destruction come on now this is the
[1:10:35] spirit about the end time that was
[1:10:38] spoken here you have people that are
[1:10:41] disobedient look what Paul wrote in the
[1:10:43] last times it will be true rebels
[1:10:46] sometimes what's the first thing he
[1:10:48] talks about everything will be selfie me
[1:10:52] me me me me mean levers of self levers
[1:10:56] of pleasure
[1:10:57] it's all about self where does that
[1:10:59] inspiration come from it comes from the
[1:11:04] one who led the rebellion in heaven in
[1:11:07] the beginning because when God became
[1:11:11] man it was not all about me he said I
[1:11:13] had the son of man is not come to be
[1:11:16] ministered unto but rather to serve he
[1:11:20] came to minister to our knees so the
[1:11:23] condition of this world the spirit of
[1:11:25] destruction is disobedience
[1:11:28] covenantbreakers forms of godliness
[1:11:30] heady and high man minded lovers of
[1:11:33] pleasure more and then than lovers of
[1:11:36] themselves oh my but at the same time as
[1:11:42] much as it was in the days of Noah where
[1:11:45] there were vessels you realize the
[1:11:47] scripture says
[1:11:48] the earth was filled with violence
[1:11:50] through them
[1:11:54] Satan was getting influenced and there
[1:11:57] was inspiration coming through vessels
[1:12:00] but at the same time God's always got
[1:12:04] the answer
[1:12:06] there was vessels on earth that was
[1:12:09] recipients of the righteousness of God
[1:12:12] there's vessels on earth that just even
[1:12:16] has these demons have been released in
[1:12:19] Revelations man when the lid has been
[1:12:22] taken off a hell but I want you to
[1:12:24] remember the beginning of Revelations 10
[1:12:26] starts with a conjunction and I saw
[1:12:30] another mighty angel of Hell all the
[1:12:38] demons have been turned loose against
[1:12:41] the bride of Jesus Christ and when the
[1:12:43] bride is gone it'll turn against Israel
[1:12:46] every nation will be gathered against
[1:12:48] Israel are you with me Satan is drawing
[1:12:54] that even right now just as he's drawing
[1:12:57] the ecclesiastical card of the
[1:13:01] denominational systems you realize the
[1:13:04] forming of those systems is the howling
[1:13:06] of Satan at the revelation taking hold
[1:13:10] in the bride that ecclesiastical card
[1:13:14] it's all being set up
[1:13:17] people are compromising their values I'm
[1:13:21] talking about church leaders churches
[1:13:26] are compromising every virtue they've
[1:13:29] got hmm man we could really preach on
[1:13:37] this for a little bit I just say it like
[1:13:41] this we are living in a mess this is
[1:13:46] unstable times the world is unstable
[1:13:51] nations are unstable but in the midst of
[1:13:55] it
[1:13:56] we have stability the stabilizer has
[1:14:01] been put on the ship he didn't say
[1:14:03] brother Carlos that there wasn't going
[1:14:05] to be waves it said great simple waves
[1:14:07] would come but takes Peter Claud
[1:14:11] there are stabilizers on the ship that's
[1:14:14] evil winds Satan blows his poisonous
[1:14:18] breath and he wants to try to sink that
[1:14:21] ship Saints Peter cloth but enjoyed
[1:14:24] their stabilizers beneath the waterline
[1:14:26] on the inside that's able to catch it
[1:14:29] sometimes you and I we're not ever able
[1:14:32] to catch it we don't see it but the
[1:14:34] stabilizer is old glory I'm glad it's
[1:14:37] not up to you and I to keep ourselves
[1:14:40] stable I'm glad that if we stay in the
[1:14:43] word there stabilizers there to keep us
[1:14:48] because after all we're not in a
[1:14:51] controlled tank we can't spend the rest
[1:14:56] of our lives in a controlled pink I hope
[1:15:01] you're with me now we can't spend the
[1:15:03] rest of our lives in a controlled
[1:15:05] controlled environment you with me Oh
[1:15:14] glory but it calls us out the Spirit of
[1:15:18] God it calls us out of Sodom calls us
[1:15:22] out of the mess of her religious system
[1:15:24] into this Ark of safety I want you to
[1:15:27] notice here this scripture that the
[1:15:29] Prophet he would read in his text for
[1:15:32] the rapture familiar Scripture but I'm
[1:15:35] gonna read it in verse 1 of Psalms 27
[1:15:39] the Lord is my light just say it like
[1:15:44] this personally you say the Lord is my
[1:15:47] light you were sometimes darkness but
[1:15:51] now are you light in the Lord we were in
[1:15:56] darkness it was manifest in our life we
[1:15:59] were influenced by darkness but light
[1:16:01] has come and life I don't care if it's
[1:16:04] just a little you can put this place so
[1:16:06] dark if you strike a match in here that
[1:16:09] match that light will press the darkness
[1:16:12] brother
[1:16:13] how much greater in this hour
[1:16:16] we are living in the promise of Isaiah
[1:16:18] when it said that of the Sun in the moon
[1:16:21] it shall shine in its seven-pole
[1:16:24] strength we are living in this hour of
[1:16:28] strength when the lights of God's Word
[1:16:31] is shining with such other strength let
[1:16:34] me tell you something it's greater than
[1:16:36] your strength and my strength it's
[1:16:38] greater than your mind and my mind the
[1:16:40] strength of this light as we're living
[1:16:42] in this life it's changing us it's
[1:16:45] bringing forth Christ in our lives even
[1:16:48] when you don't feel like it
[1:16:50] even when you can't even see it but the
[1:16:52] light is bringing forth the Lord is my
[1:17:03] light the footsteps of the righteous or
[1:17:09] what ordered of the Lord and my
[1:17:15] salvation aren't you glad he's my
[1:17:19] salvation I'm not just talking about
[1:17:21] past tense I'm talking about how many
[1:17:23] things he saved me out of come on now oh
[1:17:31] brother Simon you must be talking about
[1:17:33] coronavirus knots all my things are even
[1:17:35] deadlier than that come on now
[1:17:42] so many things that we don't even know
[1:17:45] about but yet God has saved us and other
[1:17:47] times we didn't know about it
[1:17:49] other times afflictions or things came
[1:17:51] our way and God saved us he saved us
[1:17:56] notice what does that build one that's
[1:17:58] what Paul talks about that that in
[1:18:00] itself it continues to build and abound
[1:18:02] our hope whom shall I fear the Lord is
[1:18:06] the strength of my life of whom shall I
[1:18:08] be afraid when the wicked even my
[1:18:12] enemies and my foes came upon me to eat
[1:18:15] up my flesh they stumbled and fail you
[1:18:24] can put that one on your refrigerator
[1:18:29] when when disease has showed up and said
[1:18:32] I'm gonna take you come on now this
[1:18:35] flesh has got to be redeemed but inside
[1:18:38] of it is a son a daughter of God
[1:18:39] but the devil can't patch until the
[1:18:42] purpose has been sure the devil I said
[1:18:47] food devil when the wicked even my
[1:18:55] enemies and my foes came upon me to
[1:18:58] consume my flesh they stumbled and fell
[1:19:03] though our host should encamp against me
[1:19:10] my heart shall not fear the war should
[1:19:17] arise against me in this will I be
[1:19:21] confident what are you going to be
[1:19:23] comforting in the Lord is my light
[1:19:25] he's my salvation brother Simon what
[1:19:30] happens if he don't get me out well no
[1:19:31] he always gets us out what happens if
[1:19:35] you don't get through
[1:19:35] oh no he always brings us through
[1:19:37] remember though the waves we try to sink
[1:19:41] or drown
[1:19:42] can't can't the can will rise right back
[1:19:47] up are you with me Oh glory be to God
[1:19:52] but Simon what do you say our lives are
[1:19:55] in his hands it does not mean that we
[1:19:58] are foolish or ignorant but neither are
[1:20:00] we to live in fear one thing have I
[1:20:05] desired of the Lord that will I seek
[1:20:09] after that I may dwell in the house of
[1:20:12] the Lord all the days of my life to
[1:20:15] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:20:17] enquire in his temple this is not just
[1:20:19] talking about the spiritual body of
[1:20:21] Jesus Christ notice what he brings it
[1:20:24] back down to read here in verse 4 think
[1:20:27] of for deliverance right here in verse 4
[1:20:29] we can preach even a further evidence of
[1:20:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the
[1:20:34] seal of the Living God notice what the
[1:20:37] desire is the desire is not for the
[1:20:39] things of the world the desire is I want
[1:20:43] to be where he is after I want to dwell
[1:20:46] it is presence I want to behold his
[1:20:49] beauty I want to enquire inquire means I
[1:20:52] want to proceed I want to see what is it
[1:20:56] as the word would shine back in my life
[1:20:58] what are the areas Lord that I need to
[1:21:02] pick up what are the areas that need to
[1:21:04] be smoothed out Lord Jesus I want to
[1:21:08] dwell in your house if you don't feel
[1:21:13] that way that's ahead so that's a real
[1:21:15] big concern
[1:21:19] verse 5 for in the time of trouble he
[1:21:31] shahad me in his pavilion you know how
[1:21:41] that has to be because I wouldn't know
[1:21:43] how to get into his pavilion I hope
[1:21:47] you're with me his pavilion couldn't
[1:21:49] stare me right in the nose right here
[1:21:51] come on now
[1:21:52] his prevent we're talking about a person
[1:21:55] we're talking about a dwelling place
[1:21:58] come on now when I was growing up with
[1:22:00] my parents when I was in the car or were
[1:22:03] there in the house they're playing the
[1:22:04] message or when I was sent right here in
[1:22:06] trench you know what it was the pavilion
[1:22:08] I was bumping into it I didn't realize
[1:22:13] that's what it was the place of safety
[1:22:15] that was trying to tell me you're not
[1:22:17] safe where you're at the condition
[1:22:20] you're in it's not safe what was it
[1:22:22] doing it was God's mercy and grace oh
[1:22:26] but thanks be to God he makes known the
[1:22:31] way who doesn't he does it in the secret
[1:22:38] of his Tabernacle shall he hide me oh
[1:22:44] I'm glad aren't you let me tell you
[1:22:47] something we are more safe right here
[1:22:51] I'm talking about what the scripture
[1:22:53] says we have reached the place of safety
[1:22:59] we are safe
[1:23:01] in him we are safe in his word
[1:23:05] we are safe in his will one brother I
[1:23:13] won't call his name
[1:23:15] but here he was he was over there with
[1:23:17] brother Stephen tabali you know brother
[1:23:19] Stephens preached right here brother
[1:23:21] Stephen told the brother the brother had
[1:23:23] no idea that throughout right there in
[1:23:25] Uganda in that big meeting they were
[1:23:27] having had no idea the disease that was
[1:23:29] amongst the people and brother Stephen
[1:23:33] told him said when you walk up there to
[1:23:34] the platform I don't want you shaking
[1:23:36] nobody's hand I don't want you touching
[1:23:38] nobody I want you to walk straight there
[1:23:40] and you deliver what God's put on your
[1:23:42] heart right he knew better than just to
[1:23:47] tell him say hey don't touch nobody this
[1:23:49] or that you see that he just said don't
[1:23:51] you don't have to do that but brother
[1:23:53] walked right there and he ministered the
[1:23:55] word of the Lord you know what happened
[1:23:57] people were healed
[1:24:00] situations he didn't even know about a
[1:24:02] disease plague right among the people
[1:24:05] they were healed God came right among
[1:24:08] them and touched them
[1:24:10] I hope you understand and don't get off
[1:24:14] line even those of you better streaming
[1:24:16] I'm not talking about being ignorant I'm
[1:24:19] talking about that we've got a great big
[1:24:22] God there's a stabilizer in this ship
[1:24:25] [Applause]
[1:24:33] hallelujah in the time of trouble let me
[1:24:36] tell you this is a time of trouble
[1:24:42] this is a time of trouble and now shall
[1:24:48] my head look what he says in verse six
[1:24:49] and now shall mine head be lifted up
[1:24:52] above mine enemies round about me notice
[1:24:55] what this placement does it lifts up the
[1:24:58] head above it but Ronnie didn't say that
[1:25:02] it took away it just said my head's been
[1:25:05] lifted up above it he didn't say that we
[1:25:08] said oh no there's no enemy out there
[1:25:10] I'm going to cover my eyes no the
[1:25:11] enemy's out there but my head's been
[1:25:13] lifted up above it are you saying that
[1:25:18] you're above it no no I'm not saying I'm
[1:25:20] above it but I'm saying in him I am
[1:25:22] above it Oh brother Samuel what are you
[1:25:26] saying I'm saying in him is my place of
[1:25:30] safety oh my we are living in unstable
[1:25:41] times
[1:25:44] unstable times therefore will I offer in
[1:25:48] his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy
[1:25:51] I will sing yay I will sing praises unto
[1:25:54] the Lord notice what it says in the Book
[1:25:58] of Isaiah verse 32 he said behold a king
[1:26:04] shall reign in righteousness and princes
[1:26:06] princes shall rule in judgment and a man
[1:26:09] shall be as a hiding place from the wind
[1:26:13] and the covert from the tempest there's
[1:26:21] a there it's things all around us let me
[1:26:23] just say it let me tell you something
[1:26:25] there's things that's worse than
[1:26:26] diseases I'm not making light of these
[1:26:29] things I'm saying there's things that's
[1:26:31] worse than that every day you fight
[1:26:34] head-on with demons every day there's
[1:26:39] Devils all around let me just tell you
[1:26:41] something
[1:26:41] did the diseases are not demons with
[1:26:45] pretty little bonnets on every day
[1:26:49] they're all around every day these
[1:26:54] things are all around us it doesn't mean
[1:27:02] that we walk in let me just be let me
[1:27:04] just be very honest with you it does not
[1:27:06] mean that we would walk in nor would I
[1:27:08] walk around in to a unit that has all of
[1:27:11] that of coronavirus if God didn't tell
[1:27:13] me - it doesn't mean that I'm gonna walk
[1:27:17] in where there's leprosy if God didn't
[1:27:19] tell me - that don't mean I'm fearing it
[1:27:23] but if he says do it I do it you
[1:27:28] understand me
[1:27:29] but you see listen this is where it
[1:27:31] comes down to we've got to look at what
[1:27:34] we're feeding on
[1:27:39] the point said right here the Prophet
[1:27:41] gave exhortation stay in the word stay
[1:27:45] stable in the world get around somebody
[1:27:51] long enough and you can tell what
[1:27:53] they're feeding on I mean just say it to
[1:28:00] you in case nobody knows the media is
[1:28:04] manipulators it's nothing but
[1:28:10] manipulation control you know what it's
[1:28:16] called propaganda they drop that in
[1:28:20] times of war they'll drop those leaflets
[1:28:23] down to try to do what bring fear it's
[1:28:28] propaganda now listen I don't despise
[1:28:31] those people you say that what he does
[1:28:33] I'm not gonna listen to her you want to
[1:28:37] live in fear go ahead and live in fear
[1:28:39] I'm not gonna live in fear you
[1:28:43] understand we have a word to be directed
[1:28:47] by hey listen you know what
[1:28:52] there's things and guidance that they
[1:28:53] had given us or had things that they
[1:28:55] requested and you know what
[1:28:57] I don't despise that even of things that
[1:28:59] you know even that I I can stand and say
[1:29:02] here right now they know no more about
[1:29:03] it now than what they did in the
[1:29:05] beginning their theories have been blown
[1:29:08] out of the park I don't despise it I
[1:29:11] thank God that there's more people that
[1:29:13] didn't die you understand but the thing
[1:29:18] that what we're looking at you said
[1:29:19] let's enter what do you say and what I'm
[1:29:21] trying to say is we can't stay in a
[1:29:23] building all the rest of our life
[1:29:30] I got a lot more but we ain't gonna get
[1:29:33] there this is to help us what God would
[1:29:40] drop on our heart to help us in this and
[1:29:44] I can tell you this right now there's
[1:29:46] things where the Prophet dealt with
[1:29:48] these cases the anger of the Lord dealt
[1:29:50] with them right a crunk coming across
[1:29:52] the platform where people experienced
[1:29:54] things in their life
[1:29:55] but they had to be relieved of it in
[1:29:58] order to continue their normal life a
[1:30:02] man shall be as a hiding place from the
[1:30:05] wind and a covert from The Tempest
[1:30:08] that's protection as rivers of water in
[1:30:12] a dry place ho ho so when there's a need
[1:30:14] when we're thirsty he is also rivers of
[1:30:18] water in a dry place as the shadow of a
[1:30:22] great rock in a weary land he is our
[1:30:26] protection brother Brandon gives an
[1:30:29] example in power transformation of one
[1:30:33] of the how the chaplain you know was
[1:30:37] asked by a sergeant to ride out to the
[1:30:39] battlefield over there in France you're
[1:30:41] familiar with the story no doubt but
[1:30:43] they ride out there and you know the
[1:30:45] chaplain things they said he talked
[1:30:47] about how he was feeling because when
[1:30:48] they rode out on this battlefield the
[1:30:50] sergeant was going out there to survey
[1:30:53] how many tanks had been lost how many
[1:30:59] have been blowed up well that had been a
[1:31:01] real edifying job wouldn't go and count
[1:31:05] how many tanks have went out of business
[1:31:08] that have been a real head of fine job
[1:31:10] with it
[1:31:11] he had to go out there and survey what
[1:31:14] had happened the mustard and poisonous
[1:31:16] gas bill artillery that had come in the
[1:31:20] midst of this war this war that had come
[1:31:25] about think about it
[1:31:28] his brother Graham says how did that
[1:31:30] Chaplin described it he said there was
[1:31:32] not a blade of green grass around it was
[1:31:38] bare it didn't look like brother and it
[1:31:42] didn't look like it all the luck it
[1:31:45] looks so much different but he said
[1:31:48] there was something that spoke to him
[1:31:51] said go over to that rock and when he
[1:31:54] went to that rock
[1:31:55] he said lift up that rock and what he
[1:31:58] found underneath that rock there was a
[1:32:01] lily our actual flower that had been
[1:32:05] preserved under the rock there was an
[1:32:07] agreement you know a green is life there
[1:32:11] was in life nowhere else but there was
[1:32:14] life hidden under the rock there is no
[1:32:19] other place of life but in Christ Jesus
[1:32:25] everything else is death all around
[1:32:28] Satan has shot his mustard gas his
[1:32:32] poison gas come on mouth he has got
[1:32:37] great big octillery's now it's called
[1:32:40] the World Wide Web why to get people cut
[1:32:45] he shoots it all around
[1:32:48] Satan shooting his poisonous gas his
[1:32:52] teaching and everything that comes along
[1:32:54] with it but in the midst of it all
[1:33:00] there's a bride there's an overcomer
[1:33:06] there's a lily that's hidden underneath
[1:33:09] the rock in the midst of all this and
[1:33:13] the instability and chaos all around
[1:33:16] there is a bride Daniel 12 verse one at
[1:33:28] that timing now this is this was going
[1:33:31] in dealing with the 144,000 but it's a
[1:33:34] parallel of revelations five Michael
[1:33:39] Christ in theophany form angelic form at
[1:33:43] that time shall Michael stand up the
[1:33:47] Great Prince which standeth for the
[1:33:49] children of that people and there shall
[1:33:51] be a time of trouble such as never was
[1:33:55] since there was a nation even to that
[1:33:58] same time talking about Israel now and
[1:34:00] at that time thy people shall be
[1:34:02] delivered every one that shall be found
[1:34:05] written in the book I want you to notice
[1:34:07] what Michael is doing he's standing
[1:34:13] Stephen how did you seem I looked up and
[1:34:16] I saw him standing why was he standing
[1:34:20] homecoming time homecoming town he's
[1:34:24] standing up you know where that
[1:34:25] reflection of the stand of the Lamb that
[1:34:28] is standing in this hour it's reflected
[1:34:30] in the bride the bride is making her
[1:34:32] stand its Christ standing in his pride
[1:34:38] come on now this is the time we're
[1:34:41] living in and to think just as Michael
[1:34:44] Christ in angelic form will reveal
[1:34:46] himself into the 144,000 in the in their
[1:34:50] hour the holy ghost' classful message
[1:34:54] that you and i have been partakers up
[1:34:56] they will receive by but two witnesses
[1:35:00] of revelations eleven Moses and Elijah
[1:35:03] and Satan will cause all the world to
[1:35:06] turn against him they'll turn against
[1:35:08] him
[1:35:10] it's in that time in that time of
[1:35:13] tribulation where men will begin to call
[1:35:17] for the rocks of the mountains to fall
[1:35:18] on they will hate that move that's going
[1:35:24] on see the attention is on the bride
[1:35:27] right now yet listen though all the
[1:35:32] world turn against him yet he is with
[1:35:36] them thinking about us now
[1:35:40] the angel of the Lord the Covenant one
[1:35:42] he will stand with them in that hour
[1:35:45] which one the same one that opened the
[1:35:47] Red Sea the desire within their life in
[1:35:53] Isaiah 52 53 he calls out Isaiah 51
[1:35:56] awaken or arm of the Lord awaken o
[1:36:00] strength of the Lord that part of the
[1:36:02] Red Sea
[1:36:04] you see it's expressing to us as
[1:36:07] believers that the angel of the Lord
[1:36:10] that has come to us in this hour in the
[1:36:13] form of the word he's manifest himself
[1:36:15] for a body of dust as he did before the
[1:36:18] tent door of Abraham and Sarah prior to
[1:36:20] the change of the body so is that same
[1:36:23] age of the Lord with this body of
[1:36:25] believers there's no devil no demon
[1:36:29] power that can rise and destroy his
[1:36:32] working there's been some cancers come
[1:36:40] took them there's been others cancer
[1:36:44] come God raised him up explain to me in
[1:36:50] the book of Acts why Peters release and
[1:36:52] James was beheaded
[1:36:54] you can't Hey and then you're really you
[1:36:58] mess up even trying to look for what is
[1:37:01] it showing it's in the hand of God
[1:37:08] they knew the enemy was after him come
[1:37:11] on now they didn't just walk out of
[1:37:14] their house you know and just walk out
[1:37:18] to the car or wherever they're going
[1:37:20] they had to kind of look twice come on
[1:37:25] now they didn't have a Costco membership
[1:37:27] and had to wear a mask what they had to
[1:37:29] look for was is there a sign of a
[1:37:31] Christian here come on now
[1:37:35] well you'd be saved under center what do
[1:37:38] you say I'm saying that all the way down
[1:37:40] through the ages they were doing with
[1:37:42] dealing with that in persecution brother
[1:37:45] branham tells us in the same message
[1:37:47] they could see their physical enemy they
[1:37:51] could see it but to think about it they
[1:37:54] stood and in the midst of that our
[1:37:57] remember the gospel went on no they were
[1:38:05] not going by their own works or their
[1:38:07] own imagination or other well I'm gonna
[1:38:10] go out and do this no you see what kept
[1:38:13] them is is because they were yielded to
[1:38:15] the Lord you know but the Colonel's they
[1:38:19] didn't go other house will say I'll
[1:38:20] prove I can come to your house and the
[1:38:22] Romans don't catch me that would have
[1:38:24] been the wrong attitude are you with me
[1:38:26] they actually might have got caught and
[1:38:28] they might have got some stripes you
[1:38:30] with me there might have been some
[1:38:32] things come up because their attitude
[1:38:33] was wrong in it but if they had a need
[1:38:36] brother Carlos to go to your house and
[1:38:38] get some bithday then if they went over
[1:38:41] there they would look around and you
[1:38:43] know looking around and seeing where
[1:38:44] things were act
[1:38:47] there was a need that's what it comes
[1:38:51] down to in our lives it's me God
[1:38:56] directing our lives the same angel the
[1:39:04] Lord he has one foot upon the land and
[1:39:07] one on the sea and the prophet of God in
[1:39:11] this hour would announce it to us and I
[1:39:14] want you just to stay with me I'm trying
[1:39:16] to bring a few things together and the
[1:39:19] prophet of God would announce it to us
[1:39:21] in this hour I think in 1949 he said the
[1:39:27] angel of the Lord is on earth tonight
[1:39:30] getting 144,000 gathering them up
[1:39:35] he's on earth tonight doing that
[1:39:38] performing that and that same angel the
[1:39:41] lord was standing there night after
[1:39:44] night after night he came with this
[1:39:47] message Abraham told Eliezer he said I
[1:39:52] sinned
[1:39:53] I sent angel the launch that is send his
[1:39:57] angel with you the angel of the Lord
[1:40:00] accompanies the message not way out
[1:40:08] there he's accompanying this message
[1:40:11] he's accompanied every life not just the
[1:40:15] ministers every believers life
[1:40:22] hallelujah he's gathering the Jews back
[1:40:25] in that same angel the Lord has come to
[1:40:28] set the church in order for the rapture
[1:40:31] it came to minister the seal of the
[1:40:33] Living God to us call us into a place of
[1:40:35] safety now I want you to think of this
[1:40:38] here in the scripture in 2nd Corinthians
[1:40:41] chapter 4 verse 17 for our light
[1:40:44] affliction which is but for a moment
[1:40:47] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[1:40:52] eternal weight of glory
[1:40:55] while we look not at the things which
[1:40:58] are seen but at the things which are not
[1:41:01] seen for the things which are seen are
[1:41:05] temporal but the things which are not
[1:41:08] seen are eternal that blow scientists
[1:41:15] mind this is the kingdom of God
[1:41:23] the Bible goes on to say we walk by
[1:41:28] faith and not by sight what does that
[1:41:31] mean
[1:41:33] this word walk means that our life is
[1:41:36] regulated conducted by faith if faith is
[1:41:43] a revelation faith brings what is
[1:41:49] invisible even though we can't see it
[1:41:53] when it makes it real to us
[1:41:55] somebody says explain I can't
[1:41:58] but I'm settled it's dropped you might
[1:42:02] be sicker than a dog but it's dropped
[1:42:04] she said you can't explain it the
[1:42:08] symptoms and everything else around you
[1:42:10] might speak contrary but when faith
[1:42:13] drops it says it says just like brother
[1:42:21] Branham would after he preaches the
[1:42:23] message the sixth sense and super since
[1:42:26] he said Oh God I want more of that faith
[1:42:29] that's what I want that's what we need
[1:42:32] in these unstable times that's the only
[1:42:35] thing that's going to stabilize us is
[1:42:37] more faith notice the Bible says in
[1:42:41] Hebrews eleven twenty seven how that
[1:42:43] Moses himself he forsook Egypt not
[1:42:46] fearing the wrath of the King for he
[1:42:48] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[1:42:54] brother branham goes into this and we
[1:42:56] were aware the dimension that is around
[1:43:02] us
[1:43:04] brother Brown goes in to talk about it
[1:43:06] of this of this dimension that's around
[1:43:09] us and he says now maybe you will never
[1:43:12] see it see such but you believe it
[1:43:16] anyhow remember brother Branham would
[1:43:18] stand here and he would say oh he says
[1:43:21] here they injure the Lord just reveal oh
[1:43:24] oh yeah I see you kneeling next to a
[1:43:26] bread uh I bed and that or I see in a
[1:43:29] doctor's office and this and that and so
[1:43:30] forth sometimes going clear back into
[1:43:33] their life sometimes things so simple
[1:43:38] that was in their life that had been
[1:43:40] paralyzing them not here physically but
[1:43:44] inwardly and the angel of the Lord would
[1:43:48] go right down into that area as a matter
[1:43:50] of fact brother Anne would stand there
[1:43:51] he said now you had asked about your
[1:43:53] prayer he said I'm hearing the words
[1:43:55] that you prayed in a land called prayer
[1:43:59] the words were going sometimes you feel
[1:44:02] like your words are going up and hitting
[1:44:05] the ceiling and coming right back down
[1:44:06] on you it's okay I'll be honest for you
[1:44:09] sometimes you feel like it's coming
[1:44:11] right back at you
[1:44:13] but you know what just as he told Daniel
[1:44:18] when he arrived Daniel from the first
[1:44:22] day thou did is set thy heart heaven was
[1:44:27] listening
[1:44:28] [Laughter]
[1:44:32] what stability in unstable times Oh
[1:44:37] glory notice he said but you believe in
[1:44:41] anyhow how much greater is their reward
[1:44:43] who has never seen and yet believe but
[1:44:45] some of us were born for that God places
[1:44:49] that in the church that's a profit from
[1:44:52] a baby birth profits are not just put in
[1:44:54] by man its gift born and he speaks of
[1:44:59] that let me just say it like this
[1:45:01] there's been things that even those of
[1:45:03] you who've had witnesses I have you know
[1:45:05] things of where they've seen the same
[1:45:08] lights here even you know through the
[1:45:10] time that we were in and then even
[1:45:12] before that and other and other times
[1:45:14] and seeing that now others might just
[1:45:16] like brother branham brother Graham
[1:45:17] talks about he said remember when we
[1:45:19] were there and that you know in the
[1:45:21] seven churches and he came down and drew
[1:45:23] it on the wall and how many of you heard
[1:45:25] you've heard my and you heard brother
[1:45:26] browning tell about it over and over he
[1:45:28] said he went up there when he and mom
[1:45:30] went and got baptized her brother
[1:45:31] Neville they just thought bill joy
[1:45:32] everybody saw it and brother never had
[1:45:35] time say brother brownie he said not
[1:45:37] everybody saw that he said brother
[1:45:40] Brennan talks about it as though
[1:45:41] everybody saw it not everybody saw it
[1:45:44] now let me just say it like this we may
[1:45:49] not be gifted to see into that realm God
[1:45:58] sent a prophet in the body to make us
[1:46:03] aware that God is here when man wanted
[1:46:08] to put him away in a gray God said I was
[1:46:12] in this hour to let us know he's not
[1:46:15] away he's right here hallelu he's right
[1:46:22] in his word he keeps his promise
[1:46:27] what was that stabilizers being put on
[1:46:30] the ship let me just say it to you like
[1:46:36] this the other day it was windy outside
[1:46:39] right I might say which they wasn't but
[1:46:42] you and you get you get what I mean it
[1:46:44] was windy the other day outside my
[1:46:48] brother Brian I didn't see the wind but
[1:46:51] I seen the leaves flopping in it
[1:46:53] I seen brother Joey the stuff I had cut
[1:46:57] out of my bed if there were leaves or
[1:46:58] little dried up straws of stuff
[1:47:00] I seen it blowing around you know what
[1:47:03] that let me know it was a visible of
[1:47:05] that wind that was blowing and if you
[1:47:08] asked me and said which waves that wind
[1:47:10] blowing let me see how many leaves are
[1:47:13] go up it's coming from this way so is it
[1:47:16] with every man that's born of a spirit
[1:47:19] of God it's the same wind of the Holy
[1:47:22] Ghost brother as may not see it but you
[1:47:27] see it in my life you see it reflected
[1:47:30] in that life that life begins to move in
[1:47:34] the current of the wind God makes
[1:47:40] himself visible the rest of the world
[1:47:46] canikin gumpa right in the nose and they
[1:47:49] miss it but God makes himself known
[1:47:51] remember Judas not Iscariot he asked how
[1:47:55] wilt thou manifest thyself to us and not
[1:47:58] unto the world how are we gonna see you
[1:48:02] in the world we'll see you he would
[1:48:09] reveal himself in his way to be the same
[1:48:13] yesterday today and forever I'll say
[1:48:16] blessed are your eyes that see and your
[1:48:20] ear
[1:48:21] that here what stabilizers in the midst
[1:48:25] of this hell
[1:48:26] [Applause]
[1:48:28] we've gotta wear come along but the
[1:48:34] joint that word is calling us home the
[1:48:39] devil's won the blow is breath but
[1:48:42] there's a word that's given us courage
[1:48:48] it's a same God that came down or not
[1:48:52] caramel and he gave courage to the 7000
[1:48:55] when they seemed that living God come on
[1:48:58] the scene brother they stood up with
[1:49:01] courage
[1:49:04] how you gonna face tomorrow courage from
[1:49:08] the Lord are you gonna face next month
[1:49:15] carriage from the Lord we're not being
[1:49:24] ignorant
[1:49:25] I'm not despising anything I tell you
[1:49:30] the burden of that God dropped on my
[1:49:32] heart I couldn't get away from I
[1:49:36] couldn't get away from her brother Joe
[1:49:38] he dropped into my heart I couldn't get
[1:49:40] away from there was completely something
[1:49:42] else that even yesterday I already had
[1:49:45] was already moving and just kind of
[1:49:47] touching some things up and the Spirit
[1:49:49] of God I couldn't get away from him I
[1:49:50] told the boys I said I can't go out
[1:49:53] there on that walk right now there's
[1:49:55] inspiration that's come ha ha I will
[1:49:58] have to do it later you know why because
[1:50:02] I realize that I want you to understand
[1:50:04] me and please don't read into anything
[1:50:07] or misunderstand me I realize that even
[1:50:10] from this moment forward there's no
[1:50:13] doubt changes and things that have come
[1:50:16] coming our way and everything else but I
[1:50:19] realize right now yet we need a god to
[1:50:21] come on the scene because listen to me
[1:50:25] there's different ones you you you
[1:50:27] didn't mean some of you you never took a
[1:50:29] break from your job and then there's
[1:50:30] others of you they're calling you back
[1:50:32] to your job
[1:50:34] it's going to feel as odd walking in
[1:50:36] that job the first day as it felt
[1:50:38] walking in here the first time come on
[1:50:41] that's just your flesh the reality is
[1:50:44] this just these parts that are around
[1:50:46] I'll tell you and what does a Joey if
[1:50:48] felt odd the first time I went out into
[1:50:50] the grocery store I won't go in I mean
[1:51:01] I've seen people
[1:51:02] I never seen people like that before you
[1:51:06] know you wondered if you missed the
[1:51:08] hazmat suit shipment you understand you
[1:51:15] get to looking at that stuff right there
[1:51:16] can start affecting you just as faith
[1:51:24] produces faith fear produces fear that's
[1:51:29] why God told them in Deuteronomy 20 he
[1:51:32] said if there's any man you're getting
[1:51:33] ready to go into battle if you fear or
[1:51:35] you're faint-hearted go home because
[1:51:38] that's contagious fear is contagious
[1:51:44] that's God's Word even after the water
[1:51:48] has went forth in the opening of
[1:51:50] Deuteronomy 20 don't be a terrified
[1:51:52] don't be afraid but yet notice the word
[1:51:55] said if you're afraid or frightened go
[1:51:57] back home hallelu but there's a people
[1:52:05] of God I'm talking to you all across to
[1:52:08] you not just here but coming right
[1:52:10] across from that stream there's a people
[1:52:12] of God that are batting in the ship of
[1:52:15] Zion brother
[1:52:16] there are stabilizers that are put on
[1:52:18] that ship not gonna get my eyes off on
[1:52:23] no man's word I'll keep my eyes on that
[1:52:25] saith the Lord
[1:52:27] yes sure ground the grace of God will
[1:52:32] never lead you a cannot keep you hallelu
[1:52:37] [Music]
[1:52:40] glory be to God in the highest
[1:52:43] hallelujah let me just try to come down
[1:52:48] with this I'm on the jump line is that
[1:52:51] would you call the brother joy when
[1:52:52] you're over there getting ready to jump
[1:52:53] on the plane I'm on the jump line it's
[1:52:57] probably the only time I'm not afraid of
[1:52:58] heights these are the heights I like
[1:53:04] [Applause]
[1:53:06] second King 6 verse 13 and he said now
[1:53:12] remember here's what's happening there's
[1:53:14] a prophet in the name in the Land of
[1:53:16] Israel Elijah had gone on home but
[1:53:20] Elijah was there now with another
[1:53:21] message that Elijah was there living out
[1:53:24] in the commission that was given to
[1:53:26] Elijah God not a different one oh yeah
[1:53:32] it's now through a mini member body but
[1:53:35] it's still the same God on the scene you
[1:53:40] see what in there it made a last show
[1:53:42] where God is present and the Syrians
[1:53:46] couldn't figure out every time we go
[1:53:50] down this way there they are waiting on
[1:53:53] us
[1:53:55] wonder what kind of satellite system
[1:53:57] they got it was Star Wars before they
[1:54:03] ever knew about it God already had a GPS
[1:54:07] system in knew every move of the enemy
[1:54:11] that's why we got a watchman on the
[1:54:12] tower the whole ego is there
[1:54:16] yes what the enemy is doing checkmate
[1:54:20] devil boo hey man there's a holy ghost
[1:54:25] on the scene
[1:54:29] hallelujah glory be to God a watchman on
[1:54:33] the tower I'm glad about that I'm a
[1:54:37] witness of it there's some mistakes and
[1:54:41] decisions I could have made had it not
[1:54:43] been for the Watchmen brother Brian call
[1:54:45] it out certain little thing be awarded
[1:54:47] to me brother Joey why I'm sitting right
[1:54:49] in the house of God or maybe I'm in
[1:54:51] prayer or listening to a message or
[1:54:52] reading there in the scripture the
[1:54:54] morning and the Spirit of God was just
[1:54:56] all of a sudden Here I am reading I
[1:54:58] maybe could have finished that passage
[1:55:00] or finished how brother branham said it
[1:55:01] with the fluctuation of voice I maybe
[1:55:04] could have done that but the Spirit of
[1:55:05] God would come down how many times does
[1:55:07] that happen it's like I never heard that
[1:55:09] before I'm hearing it in a manner that
[1:55:12] brings down divine application to the
[1:55:16] situation I'm in what is that stability
[1:55:20] for him the midst of instability we're
[1:55:26] sheep we need a shepherd so I was told
[1:55:29] I'm saying behold he's in Dothan oh my
[1:55:33] god was just remember villain their
[1:55:35] every move every time the enemy would go
[1:55:39] to make this move right here God already
[1:55:41] knew that move this was a dangerous man
[1:55:48] brother Joey one man one man I said one
[1:55:54] man Elijah and look what they did
[1:55:57] they sent horses chariots and a great
[1:56:00] host for one man you want to know how
[1:56:04] afraid the devil is of you he sends a
[1:56:06] great host after you
[1:56:09] he ain't afraid of me and he ain't
[1:56:12] afraid of you per se but it's the one we
[1:56:15] represent but it just so happens when he
[1:56:20] touches one of God's children
[1:56:24] you've got Papua on your hands
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:30] hallelujah oh yeah he just right up
[1:56:33] there watching us we're playing on the
[1:56:36] metal he's watching oh we're playing
[1:56:40] around you see that's why we've got a
[1:56:43] right to be happy why how can you have
[1:56:46] joy because he's watching over me he's
[1:56:52] not talking about being careless but
[1:56:54] neither is it talking about being
[1:56:56] worried and fearful are you with me it's
[1:57:00] because he's watching over and if
[1:57:02] there's the slightest little thing that
[1:57:04] maybe we can't see because the grass's
[1:57:06] is so so deeper we're at but he can see
[1:57:10] he's got the angle on the enemy he can
[1:57:14] see him coming in and there he lets out
[1:57:17] one of those bellows the screeches
[1:57:21] little each let's take a rise he's a
[1:57:32] wakes up
[1:57:36] he's an early riser was out he said no
[1:57:43] doubt looks at mana I guess I need
[1:57:47] coffee this morning
[1:57:48] I should have my coffee before I went
[1:57:50] outside this morning I'm a little dab of
[1:57:52] heavy cream in there Megan I'm what I'm
[1:57:54] seeing right now this don't look right
[1:58:00] come on now you know how it is you say
[1:58:04] you know what I'm just gonna have my
[1:58:05] coffee for our face today first but you
[1:58:08] know what your coffee don't have no
[1:58:09] miracle work in it to change what's
[1:58:11] before you
[1:58:11] I don't care from what star it comes
[1:58:17] from you don't have the ability to
[1:58:19] change the problems ahead of you
[1:58:21] are you with me the haze that goes out
[1:58:26] there and he looks as a good gracious he
[1:58:30] sees the Syrian host is all around him
[1:58:34] he goes and wakes up there lasha Elijah
[1:58:38] comes out
[1:58:39] he looks all around washes seasoned well
[1:58:44] Joe he sees him he's seeing all of it
[1:58:47] but I want you to watch approach will be
[1:58:51] Elijah verse 16 fear
[1:59:01] for they that be with us are more than
[1:59:06] they that be with them and Elijah prayed
[1:59:14] and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes
[1:59:17] that he may see
[1:59:22] brotherbrother put it just like this in
[1:59:24] the message looking through the unseen
[1:59:27] he said what it was he said it wasn't
[1:59:30] that he calls it Elijah it wasn't that
[1:59:33] Elijah seeing those angels there but he
[1:59:37] said Elijah had already had contact with
[1:59:40] God and he said what God said in the
[1:59:43] white was enough for Elijah that Elijah
[1:59:46] beliefs almost 34-7 the angel of the
[1:59:49] Lord in campus round about them that
[1:59:52] fear him and deliver them
[1:59:55] it alasa wasn't praying for his own eyes
[1:59:58] he was praying for the servant Silas why
[2:00:01] because what he was seeing what he was
[2:00:06] hearing they was shaking him he wasn't
[2:00:12] able to go about and conduct his
[2:00:14] business come on now the God look how
[2:00:22] God steps on the scene then Elijah prays
[2:00:25] and alasa said God opened his eyes that
[2:00:30] he can see because once he sees just
[2:00:33] exactly what you said in your way it'll
[2:00:35] stabilize him he'll lose sight of the
[2:00:40] Syrian army
[2:00:42] may God so open our eyes that we lose
[2:00:46] sight of the world we lose sight of all
[2:00:50] their height we'll lose sight of all of
[2:00:55] their tactics of intimidation we lose
[2:00:58] sight of that you say brother Samuel are
[2:01:05] you just telling us to walk out and act
[2:01:07] like nothing I didn't say that you're
[2:01:09] misinterpreting it altogether
[2:01:11] what I'm trying to say is is that there
[2:01:14] are some people then no doubt from here
[2:01:16] or wherever it's at then when you work
[2:01:19] and you've got to go back and do
[2:01:21] different things you're not gonna be
[2:01:22] able to call him up and say I ain't
[2:01:24] coming ain't you coming well because you
[2:01:28] aren't on and this and that and this and
[2:01:29] that you know what they'll say
[2:01:32] here's your pink slip brother Chanyeol
[2:01:35] that scares me to death you're looking
[2:01:37] at the wrong my prayer is God let her
[2:01:40] eyes be opened
[2:01:42] let her eyes be open here we're not
[2:01:44] walking around arrogantly ignorantly
[2:01:47] this virus has already touched our local
[2:01:50] body and more more than just image
[2:01:54] you're more than just a few
[2:01:56] this thing's has already been around
[2:01:59] we're not making light of this as though
[2:02:01] that these things are nothing but
[2:02:04] friends our urge within our hearts
[2:02:07] it's not about and don't misunderstand
[2:02:09] me it ain't about getting people here to
[2:02:12] the church if that's what you're
[2:02:13] thinking
[2:02:14] you're you're mistaken the Lord did not
[2:02:16] lay that on my heart for that but upon
[2:02:21] my heart because I realize there's our
[2:02:23] things that we are being bombarded with
[2:02:26] constantly figures that are not even
[2:02:31] true figures that are not even true
[2:02:39] where do we stand for the Vivian where
[2:02:42] do we stand that where do we rest that
[2:02:46] do we rest on the news networks or do we
[2:02:50] rest in the Word of God that doesn't
[2:02:56] mean that I hadn't read medical reports
[2:02:57] from different brothers whether joseline
[2:02:59] different ones would send me different
[2:03:01] things they're looking at within
[2:03:01] treatments and I would read through
[2:03:03] those things just as much as brother
[2:03:04] Branham would be aware of the Salk
[2:03:06] vaccine and other things like that
[2:03:07] because some of those things right there
[2:03:09] interesting I you never know where I'll
[2:03:10] get inspiration from it's just
[2:03:14] interesting but the reality of it is it
[2:03:17] all comes down to we need stability in
[2:03:20] the midst of instability because we do
[2:03:24] not have a promise or a hope when we're
[2:03:26] going to wait till the phone or we're
[2:03:28] going to wait till next year or we're
[2:03:29] going to wake to this or we're going to
[2:03:31] wait till that we don't have that
[2:03:34] promise what are you saying to us I'm
[2:03:37] saying don't stake your faith in that
[2:03:39] I'm saying Lord let my eyes be open
[2:03:44] to recognize that the angels of God
[2:03:47] brother BAM said brother Brian they
[2:03:49] never move away from their right there
[2:03:52] as a matter of fact he said in the midst
[2:03:54] of a meeting when your heart starts
[2:03:56] being turned towards the things of God
[2:03:57] you might set as a sinner you might set
[2:04:00] indifferent but as soon as your heart
[2:04:01] starts to turn he said here comes the
[2:04:03] angels of God that'll start to move
[2:04:05] around that life and they begin to
[2:04:07] encamped around that life and begin to
[2:04:09] minister to that life and say raise your
[2:04:11] hand raise your hand
[2:04:13] hey y'all go born up for prayer it
[2:04:15] begins to minister to that life the same
[2:04:18] angels of God that are encamped around
[2:04:20] about our life Satan knows they're there
[2:04:26] he called him a hedge when he talked to
[2:04:30] God about Joe you got a hedge around him
[2:04:35] Satan can't cross over that hedge he has
[2:04:40] to get permission oh let's just stop
[2:04:45] here I keep saying I'm stopping and I
[2:04:48] keep going and I keep going you're
[2:04:53] probably already used to it by now he
[2:04:54] said don't don't believe already saying
[2:05:03] but I want you to understand this and I
[2:05:05] want everyone to understand this don't
[2:05:08] take this word whether you're here
[2:05:10] whether you're home whether you will
[2:05:12] stream it or whether you will archive it
[2:05:14] whatever don't take this as a word of
[2:05:17] condemnation you've missed it if that's
[2:05:21] the way you've taken it one thing it
[2:05:24] shows is you're not in fellowship with
[2:05:26] God the way you ought to be because when
[2:05:29] you're in fellowship with God the way
[2:05:30] you ought to be there's a lot more grace
[2:05:32] and things is he meaning a single is he
[2:05:34] taking is he taking this single is it
[2:05:36] hey listen I went even when I said and
[2:05:39] listen to the word sometimes I want to
[2:05:40] know where where's a man going where's
[2:05:42] he going
[2:05:44] but I say this right here the things
[2:05:47] that we realize in this here if we are
[2:05:49] waiting as a people for everything to
[2:05:54] all of a sudden go back to normal I
[2:05:58] think we're waiting on the wrong
[2:06:03] the salmon what do you say I say let let
[2:06:06] him stabilize you
[2:06:07] and if you're a little fearful I listen
[2:06:11] this is why brother Brent say when a
[2:06:13] doctor's report comes or something comes
[2:06:14] along he said he said why did he give us
[2:06:17] the Holy Ghost he said why did he give
[2:06:19] us these promises so that we would have
[2:06:22] a rest in the time of trouble
[2:06:24] he said when those things come our way
[2:06:27] he said fear wants to set in he said it
[2:06:29] shouldn't shame on us but what does he
[2:06:31] do he refers this brother Aaron back to
[2:06:34] the ground that we need to stand on how
[2:06:36] we gonna face this how we're gonna face
[2:06:38] next to your next month or next week or
[2:06:40] whenever how we're gonna face it in him
[2:06:42] in him no matter what wave comes there
[2:06:47] is stabilizer sits that's able to catch
[2:06:50] it aren't you glad it ain't and then
[2:06:53] dead it didn't like dead roots to thee
[2:06:55] these aren't fixed stabilizers they're
[2:06:57] able to move brother I'll say if you're
[2:07:04] not in him this morning get any let him
[2:07:11] take you there to that place of safety
[2:07:13] let's bow our heads father how we just
[2:07:19] appreciate you this morning Lord your
[2:07:22] God my heart Lord not just only goes to
[2:07:27] the congregation here the Lord I look
[2:07:31] around I look around Lord the different
[2:07:36] places I've been around in the city
[2:07:38] sometimes you hear things Lord among
[2:07:40] people and just seeing them just Lord
[2:07:44] even sensing it there's a tenseness
[2:07:46] that's in the air but I pray
[2:07:53] that you would help us sword I feel
[2:07:57] sorry Lord for others perhaps Lord how
[2:08:01] that in this hour you would give us
[2:08:03] grace to be able Lord to minister to
[2:08:06] their hearts
[2:08:10] Lord God that there might be lives that
[2:08:12] would come to that place of safety in
[2:08:15] you not just out there but here is well
[2:08:18] Lord among us as an assembly dollar moon
[2:08:24] among Lord God the believers around the
[2:08:27] world through the churches Lord Lord
[2:08:30] there's many that said Lord throughout
[2:08:32] they need to get in Lord to a place of
[2:08:35] safety and not pray father Lord as we
[2:08:41] know that there are things about it that
[2:08:44] even as they're reopening and this one's
[2:08:48] opening this one's not opening this
[2:08:50] one's doing this and this was doing that
[2:08:52] all these things
[2:08:54] why is things in such a way Lord
[2:09:03] we see this tenseness among the people
[2:09:10] the Lord we ask that God as our hearts
[2:09:16] may our eyes be opened Lord if any eyes
[2:09:21] have got bloomed if become desensitized
[2:09:25] by things around us to where Lord God it
[2:09:30] becomes walking more by our reports than
[2:09:34] walking by the word Lord it's not that
[2:09:38] we want to be ignorant I think as much
[2:09:43] as we listen to the message the Prophet
[2:09:45] was not ignorant he would listen to
[2:09:48] different things but yet father
[2:09:51] we were pointed and given a stabilizer
[2:09:55] in this out
[2:09:57] we see things that are around us that's
[2:10:00] true we don't make light of those things
[2:10:03] Lord Father we know that there are parts
[2:10:06] of our lives that in some ways Lord for
[2:10:11] many of your children that are not
[2:10:13] option they're not optional these are
[2:10:17] things that they will have to resume
[2:10:19] places they'll have to go if you tarry
[2:10:23] they'll be teachers going back to school
[2:10:25] in the fall there'll be kids going back
[2:10:29] to school the Lord Jesus you've given us
[2:10:35] your word or God you help us and you
[2:10:40] stabilize us we just Lord we want to
[2:10:46] rest in you not to get focused on
[2:10:49] tomorrow we want to live and rest in you
[2:10:53] today Lord I pray if there's one Lord
[2:10:57] that's outside of the fold outside of
[2:10:59] the ship I ask God that you would move
[2:11:03] for them right now
[2:11:05] God just in the simplicity of their
[2:11:07] heart that they would Lord Jesus just
[2:11:09] from their heart to say Lord I want to
[2:11:12] move to that place of safety that place
[2:11:15] or God in you Lord Jesus our Lord I'm
[2:11:20] free from the pressures and the waves of
[2:11:23] this world
[2:11:24] I'm free from the influences and the
[2:11:27] love of this world but Lord God where I
[2:11:30] receive more god that's stabilization in
[2:11:34] my life when tests and trials and storms
[2:11:37] and things come our way there's a rock
[2:11:39] that were founded on lord help us you're
[2:11:43] gone throughout the nation throughout
[2:11:45] the world I think the Lord God on many
[2:11:47] of the pastors or even your God just
[2:11:50] different ones Lord that I've spoke to
[2:11:52] Lord nor them asking certain questions
[2:11:55] and looking at things Lord God I pray
[2:11:59] that Lord you'll help each and every one
[2:12:00] help every congregation help your
[2:12:03] children Lord God help the believers the
[2:12:05] Lord even as they would head back into
[2:12:07] the work place some Lord have already
[2:12:08] headed back others will be going back
[2:12:10] this week Lord others Lord God in the
[2:12:12] next week and on and on and on or Jesus
[2:12:16] help us your prophet said it like this
[2:12:20] he said when a man has ever come in
[2:12:23] contact with the unseen with the Living
[2:12:28] God he said there's something about that
[2:12:30] man that stabilizes that man when
[2:12:34] trouble arises when things come around
[2:12:38] he said to try to drown him there's that
[2:12:41] which rises within him and causes him to
[2:12:46] lift his head above it all all that's
[2:12:50] not a passive that's not a passive
[2:12:53] stabilizer that's an active stabilizer
[2:12:57] that's the Holy Ghost moving in our life
[2:13:01] that would draw our heads to say look up
[2:13:07] there's more with us than there is
[2:13:10] against us or Jesus we can walk with a
[2:13:17] stabilized walk help us lord I pray you
[2:13:21] know that we are but flesh Lord God here
[2:13:24] within these bodies things come our way
[2:13:26] the Lord God we lift our hearts and our
[2:13:29] eyes we lift our lives to this unstable
[2:13:34] time Lord you are our stability we love
[2:13:40] you for Jesus well don't you love you oh
[2:13:48] my just just so appreciative
[2:13:51] so thanking for its mercy to our lives
[2:13:55] oh my what loving kindness aren't you
[2:14:00] grateful for that to me when I when I
[2:14:03] looked at this and God just began to
[2:14:05] drop these things on my heart I thought
[2:14:06] Lord what mercy
[2:14:08] what grace you know Billy Brian I
[2:14:11] thought of it like that that there is
[2:14:12] something here I am going to move on
[2:14:14] this pathway and I thought sure's the
[2:14:16] world here's where we're going and the
[2:14:18] Holy Spirit says no
[2:14:21] this is direction right here oh I'm so
[2:14:26] glad for him I'm so glad he knows he's
[2:14:28] the one directing his friends it's not a
[2:14:31] man that's directing us I'm glad it's
[2:14:33] him we can rest in his word leaders if
