[33:38] to be praised.
[33:41] Amen.
[33:43] Amen.
[33:44] Thank you, God, for your blessings.
[33:46] Amen.
[33:48] Hallelujah. It's good to be in the house
[33:49] of the Lord with you tonight. Good to be
[33:52] here. We're just gathered together with
[33:54] people like faith. Amen.
[33:57] Hallelujah. Amen.
[34:00] Praise the Lord. It's been a few days
[34:01] since we see some of you, but we're
[34:04] still keeping on keeping on. Amen. And
[34:06] pressing on. And I feel like we're just
[34:08] we're just moments away from we can just
[34:10] have all the fellowship we want anytime
[34:13] we want. No time restrictions on it.
[34:16] Amen. Amen. Amen. Just greetings from
[34:19] the home church back home at True Word
[34:21] and the family there. And just want to
[34:23] thank brother Samuel for the opportunity
[34:24] to speak to you tonight. If you have
[34:25] your Bibles, turn to the book of Isaiah
[34:27] the 25th chapter.
[34:29] Thank you for the songs and worship
[34:32] tonight. And man, we just feel right at
[34:35] home. Praise the Lord. Amen. It's not
[34:38] sometimes it's not easy, you know, for a
[34:41] worship leader to come in on a midweek
[34:43] and he's got his own struggles and he's
[34:44] tired and got his own thing, but just
[34:46] get it out of the way. And man, it just
[34:48] changes the atmosphere when everybody
[34:49] can just lay aside the cares, but takes
[34:52] a few songs to get there, you know.
[34:54] So, we thank God for the for the men
[34:56] that God has has dedicated to be the
[34:59] worship leaders in our churches that we
[35:01] could just, you know, uh we don't
[35:03] realize sometimes how much they they
[35:05] push back the spirits that we carry in,
[35:07] you know, and even in their own life.
[35:09] And so, we thank you, brother Brian, for
[35:11] clearing the path tonight. Amen. Isaiah
[35:14] the 25th chapter in the first verse. Oh
[35:17] Lord, thou art my God. I will exalt
[35:21] thee. I will praise thy name for thou
[35:23] hast done wonderful things. Thy councils
[35:26] of old our faithfulness and truth. For
[35:29] thou hast made of a city and heap of a
[35:32] defense city a runa a palace of
[35:34] strangers to be no city. It shall never
[35:37] be built. Therefore shall the strong
[35:39] people glorify thee. The city of the
[35:41] terrible nations shall fear thee. For
[35:43] thou hast been a strength to the poor, a
[35:46] strength to the needy in his distress, a
[35:49] refuge from a storm. How many can say
[35:51] amen to that? A shadow from the heat.
[35:54] When the blast of the terrible ones is
[35:56] as a storm against the wall, thou shalt
[35:59] bring down the noise of strangers, as
[36:02] the heat in a dry place, even the heat
[36:04] with the shadow of a cloud, the branch
[36:07] of the terrible one shall be brought
[36:08] low. And in this mountain shall the Lord
[36:10] of hosts make unto all people a feast of
[36:13] fat things, a feast of wines and leaves,
[36:15] a fat things full of marrow, and wines
[36:18] and leaves well refined. And he will
[36:20] destroy in this mountain the face of the
[36:22] covering cast over all people and the
[36:25] veil that is spread over all nations. He
[36:28] will swallow up death and victory. And
[36:30] the Lord God will wipe away tears from
[36:33] off all faces. And the rebuke of his
[36:36] people shall he take away from all the
[36:39] earth. For the Lord hath spoken. And it
[36:43] shall be said in that day, lo, this is
[36:44] our God. We have waited for him and he
[36:48] will save us. This is the Lord. Amen. We
[36:51] have waited for him. We shall be glad
[36:53] and rejoice in his salvation. Amen.
[36:58] Praise the Lord tonight. Amen. We just
[37:01] like to speak for a title tonight if we
[37:03] have one. Abide in the field. Abide in
[37:06] the field. Father, we thank you, Lord,
[37:07] for your grace to us tonight. Father,
[37:09] for your mercies are inexhaustible.
[37:11] Father, we thank you that you've given
[37:13] us this opportunity to come before you,
[37:15] Lord, that you might speak to us, Lord.
[37:17] We just ask that you would just have the
[37:19] preeminence in the room, Father, as we
[37:20] lift you up, Lord, and we worship your
[37:22] name, Father. Lord, may you just come by
[37:25] our way, Father. Continue to be, Lord,
[37:27] amongst your people, in the midst of us
[37:29] here tonight, we pray as we dedicate
[37:31] this time to you in Jesus name. Amen.
[37:33] Amen. You may be seated. Amen. So, uh,
[37:37] what an encouraging, uh, passage of
[37:39] scripture we read there that we have
[37:41] waited for this this our Lord. But the
[37:43] time has come. We're not waiting any
[37:45] longer. But this scripture has been
[37:48] fulfilled before us in our ears in this
[37:50] age that this is the Lord and he has
[37:53] spoken these things. And this is the
[37:55] time that we see all of the culmination
[37:57] of things coming together that that that
[37:59] the the earth is moving into her
[38:02] position. The world systems are moving
[38:04] into their position. The there's there's
[38:06] uh kings and kingdoms moving into their
[38:08] position. And of course, we know there's
[38:10] there's wars and there's there's rumors
[38:12] of wars and uh you know, I just was
[38:14] talking to a few people out in the in
[38:16] the public space over the last few days
[38:18] and everybody's got a question on their
[38:20] mind. Will we go to war? Will we not go
[38:22] to war? And you could just feel the uh
[38:24] the stress on the people's hearts. And I
[38:26] thought, man, I really am the oddball
[38:28] here because this is this is exciting to
[38:30] me. It's not stress, but I've been told
[38:32] that these things must happen since I
[38:34] was a little child that I've been told
[38:36] that these people would move into these
[38:37] positions. And you know, I think about
[38:39] it when brother Brandon was talking to
[38:40] us about who would be in charge and who
[38:42] would move into positions back, you
[38:44] know, 70 years ago. Uh, no one imagined
[38:47] that it would be China or that, you
[38:49] know, Israel didn't even have its own
[38:50] country when he first was prophesying
[38:52] these things. And I imagine people back
[38:54] then probably thought, well, you don't
[38:55] know what you're talking about. But then
[38:56] you just fast forward 60 or 70 years and
[38:59] you see that a prophetic eye can see
[39:01] what's down the road ahead of us when
[39:02] there's not even those names in the game
[39:04] yet. He's already seeing the position
[39:06] that they're going to fulfill. And I
[39:08] think if the world can move into their
[39:10] part of the prophecy, then I believe
[39:12] there's another part of the prophecy
[39:14] that's being moved into fulfillment. And
[39:15] that's you and I, the church, tonight. I
[39:17] I believe that Isaiah 60 says that the
[39:20] world would be full of gross darkness
[39:21] upon the face of the earth and and they
[39:24] would be wandering to and fro, wondering
[39:26] if there is a God or if he is real. But
[39:28] it also says, "Arise, shine, for thy
[39:31] light has come." And I believe that if
[39:32] they can fulfill their part of the
[39:34] darkness of the prophecy, then we as the
[39:36] light should be able to fulfill our part
[39:38] as well. where where fear is gripping
[39:40] the hearts of men across the world.
[39:42] There is a hope tonight for those that
[39:44] have have stayed in the word and have
[39:46] hid under the word and have gathered
[39:48] under the word. And let me just say
[39:50] tonight, friends, this is not a time to
[39:52] be distracted away from the prize, but
[39:55] you've been serving this whether you've
[39:56] been whether you've been in here five
[39:58] minutes or 50 years or or longer than
[40:00] that. This is not a time to get
[40:02] distracted away from the finish line
[40:04] because it's not that we're waiting for
[40:07] uh we're not waiting for hell to be
[40:08] unleashed, but hell is already been
[40:10] unleashed on the church. You're already
[40:12] fighting a fight to be here and now is
[40:14] not the time to be looking to the left
[40:16] or the right or to be discouraged or to
[40:19] be dismayed or to be intimidated from
[40:21] your victory. But now is the time to
[40:23] press the battle like we've never
[40:25] pressed it before. to be so sure that
[40:27] what we're under. But of course, we're
[40:29] under the attack of of of 200,000,000
[40:32] demons have been released upon you, the
[40:34] church. And and you're the focus of
[40:36] their very attack. So, of course, it's
[40:38] getting harder. And of course, it's it's
[40:40] it's an uphill battle. But you've
[40:42] already been prophesied to overcome in
[40:44] this age. And if they're moving into
[40:47] their part, it only tells me that we are
[40:49] also moving into our part of the
[40:51] prophecy. I believe the escalation of of
[40:54] the world's uh of the world's cosmos has
[40:57] accelerated so fast in the last few
[40:59] months. And it tells me, brother Ray,
[41:00] then what is the bride doing to move
[41:02] this along? It's her coming into her
[41:05] position and it's pushing the world into
[41:08] its position. You see, we're not we're
[41:09] not moving because of something
[41:11] happening, but we are moving and then
[41:13] something is happening. We're not moving
[41:15] because we're afraid of what the what
[41:18] the Russians will do or what China would
[41:19] do. But actually, you are in control of
[41:22] what President Putin does or what what
[41:24] what what the president of China does.
[41:26] It's actually focused in on the bride of
[41:28] Christ and how she's moving into
[41:30] position. And there are angels holding
[41:32] back those winds of the world. And
[41:35] they're all looking at you tonight to
[41:37] look at you moving into your position.
[41:38] And and the closer we get, the more they
[41:41] cause those things to come into play.
[41:43] And I believe we're just on the brink of
[41:45] a moment. Oh my. I mean, just a breath
[41:48] away where the world will never be the
[41:51] same as it was last week. You can say,
[41:53] "Well, this has happened and this has
[41:54] happened before." But we've never been
[41:56] in a day like this day. We've never had
[41:59] all of the things lined up like we are
[42:01] in this day. And the world will never be
[42:03] the same. Since since Israel moved in
[42:05] Iran, that changed everything. That
[42:07] changed history. And you can say, "Well,
[42:08] we don't base it on current events."
[42:10] know the bride causes current events.
[42:13] You see the natural t has moved in while
[42:15] the spiritual has already moved in the
[42:18] spiritual Israel church. Right? So you
[42:20] see the world is looking for something
[42:22] some kind of safe haven some kind of
[42:24] rest where they can they can they can
[42:26] get away from all the chaos. Right? But
[42:29] as the bride we're already tucked away
[42:31] from that. We already have been hid away
[42:33] from that. Brother man would say this in
[42:35] the message letting off the pressure. He
[42:36] is the rock in a weary land. There is a
[42:39] cleft in the rock for sinners. Unbelief.
[42:42] Just run into the rock and be saved.
[42:44] Christ is our rock. And people today run
[42:47] after everything else but Christ. They
[42:48] run after denominations. They run after
[42:50] sensations. Everybody's got blood, fire,
[42:53] smoke, or something. People have to run
[42:55] after it. Why don't you just take his
[42:57] word for he is the word. Run into that
[43:01] and you're safe. Cuz heavens and earth
[43:03] shall pass away, but my word shall not
[43:06] pass away. Hallelujah. Why don't we just
[43:09] run into the word? He says today it's
[43:11] always some some got to do with some
[43:12] creed or they'll run into a creed or
[43:14] join and unjoin and everything else from
[43:16] one to another won't try to take Christ
[43:18] but watch him as he vindicates himself
[43:20] and that all builds up a pressure and
[43:22] they must let it off and he says just
[43:25] believe his word.
[43:28] That's it church.
[43:31] Just believe his word. Just believe he's
[43:34] talking to you. And I believe I believe
[43:36] we're moving into a realm where it's
[43:37] becoming a reality to us that we
[43:39] recognize this is this is really
[43:41] happening. This is this is that movement
[43:44] of the third pole. We're not waiting for
[43:46] it to come, but it's already in the hand
[43:48] of the bride and it's already put into
[43:50] action. So when we were just we were
[43:52] just I remember just being a little
[43:53] little boy sitting in the front row
[43:54] hearing about these things that would
[43:56] happen. But I never I never thought that
[43:58] there would be a moment in my lifetime
[43:59] where it would become a reality where I
[44:02] would be walking in the fulfillment of
[44:03] the prophecies that I've been told about
[44:05] my entire life that that I would walk in
[44:08] the movement of the third pull power in
[44:11] the bride's hand. But this is where
[44:12] we're at, friends. This is the time that
[44:14] we've arrived at. Brother Ram says, "In
[44:16] an atomic age when the world is scared,
[44:18] each nation is shaking, the skies are
[44:20] trembling, all nature is crying out, the
[44:23] world itself trembling because it could
[44:25] be blowed to bits. But we have a kingdom
[44:28] that cannot be moved. And we have a city
[44:30] of refuge. We have a go where the sun
[44:33] will never go down. Grant it, Lord. Let
[44:36] us come to this rock now.
[44:39] Let us come into this rock now. Lord
[44:41] Jesus, I pray this morning, Lord, if
[44:43] some of those little creatures of yours
[44:45] that's wandered away from this safety
[44:47] zone, if they can feel the breath of the
[44:49] hounds of hell, young men, young women
[44:51] galloping right behind them, seeing
[44:52] their life breaking away at the other
[44:54] side. May they hurry this morning to the
[44:56] cleft in the rock. There is one, and the
[44:59] righteous run into it, and they are
[45:02] safe. Amen. Psalms 91 would say, "He
[45:05] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[45:08] most high shall abide under the shadow
[45:11] of the Almighty. And I will say of the
[45:13] Lord, he is my refuge and my fortress,
[45:16] my God. In him will I trust. Surely he
[45:20] shall deliver thee from the snare of the
[45:22] fowler, and from the noise and
[45:23] pestilence. He shall cover thee with his
[45:25] feathers, and under his wing shalt thou
[45:28] trust. His truth shall be thy shield and
[45:31] thy buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid
[45:34] for the terror by night, nor for the
[45:36] arrow that flieth by day. Church, we
[45:39] have a place that we can come underneath
[45:41] where we're we're hidden away from the
[45:44] time of trouble. We're hidden away from
[45:46] where the where the noise of the world
[45:48] can attack us. We're actually hidden in
[45:50] a place, you know, brother would say
[45:51] this. There's a place you can go in the
[45:53] word where the devil cannot follow you.
[45:56] And that's under the shadow of the
[45:58] Almighty that there's a refuge that we
[46:00] can run into. And the devil has to stop
[46:02] there because he doesn't have access to
[46:04] go where you can go. He doesn't have
[46:06] access to get into the word like you
[46:08] can, brother Shane. He can't hide away
[46:10] in the time of trouble like you can. You
[46:13] can run under the shadow of the almighty
[46:15] and the devil cannot attack you there
[46:18] because he doesn't have the authority to
[46:20] access that place. And I think it's time
[46:22] the bride recognize that we are covered
[46:24] in this age. We're not waiting for
[46:26] something to come, but the covering has
[46:28] already come upon the church. And if we
[46:30] just abide in the word, all things are
[46:34] protected from us. We will not be scared
[46:36] about what the world is doing, but it's
[46:38] an excitement to us because it tells us
[46:40] it's going home time. It tells us that
[46:43] our time has come to finish this race to
[46:46] finish this work. And he who has started
[46:48] a work in you shall finish the work.
[46:51] He's not going to leave us at the finish
[46:52] line, church. He's not going to leave us
[46:55] just short of the promise and say,
[46:56] "Well, you didn't have enough or I
[46:58] didn't have enough strength." But no, my
[47:00] God started a work in his bride. And my
[47:02] God will finish the work in which he
[47:04] started. He will see it through to the
[47:06] finish. We've just got to hold on to the
[47:08] word and stay under the covering of his
[47:11] wing. He's already given us the
[47:13] protection we need and the direction to
[47:16] set. We've just got to march forward in
[47:18] it. Just march forward in the word.
[47:20] Proverbs would say this in the 14th
[47:22] chapter. And the fear of the Lord is
[47:24] strong confidence, and his children
[47:27] shall have a place of refuge. Aren't you
[47:30] glad for that place of refuge tonight?
[47:33] Amen. I'm glad it's not a city that we
[47:35] have to run to somewhere like it was in
[47:37] the Old Testament. We have to we have to
[47:39] be faster than our pursuer to get to
[47:41] that city of refuge. But this city of
[47:43] refuge has come right to where you are.
[47:45] And it said, "Just get under me. Just
[47:49] get under me and you shall have my
[47:51] protection." We don't have to run to it,
[47:53] but it's already come to us. When I
[47:55] couldn't run to the city, the city came
[47:57] to me. I couldn't reach the city in
[48:00] time. My pursuers were too fast. I
[48:03] couldn't have reached it in time. So,
[48:05] the city came my way and gave me
[48:08] protection. That's how good our God is.
[48:10] This is not how how him that runth or
[48:12] him that willth, but it's God that
[48:14] giveth grace. It's God that shows mercy
[48:17] to us. It's God that brought the city to
[48:19] us when we didn't have the strength to
[48:21] get to him. The troubled water came to
[48:23] where you were. Hallelujah. Psalms 46
[48:27] would say this. God is our refuge and
[48:29] strength, a very present help in
[48:32] trouble.
[48:34] Therefore will not we fear. Though the
[48:36] earth be removed, and though the
[48:37] mountains be carried into the midst of
[48:39] the sea, though the waters thereof roar
[48:41] and trouble, though the mountains shake
[48:42] and the swelling thereof, there is a
[48:44] river, the streams whereof shall make
[48:46] glad the city of God, the holy place,
[48:48] the tabernacles of the most high. God is
[48:51] in the midst of her.
[48:54] God is in the midst of her. Who is that?
[48:57] You, the church. I see one in the midst
[48:59] of the candlesticks. Right? What is the
[49:01] candlesticks? That's you, the church.
[49:02] He's not out there. He's in the midst of
[49:05] her. And if he's in the midst of her,
[49:07] he's doing something. He's not
[49:08] slumbering in the midst of her, but he's
[49:10] moving on her behalf. He's in the midst
[49:12] of the bride. He's in the midst of
[49:14] believer spoken word tabernacle. He's in
[49:16] the midst of of churches across the
[49:19] world. He's in the midst of his bride
[49:21] moving on their behalf. He's not left us
[49:23] uh to dry somewhere. He's not left us
[49:25] and abandoned us somewhere, but he's
[49:27] right in the middle of our trial. If I
[49:30] can say, he's right in the middle of our
[49:31] storm. He's right in the middle of of
[49:33] this situation in the earth. This is God
[49:35] doing these things. This has nothing to
[49:38] do with Donald Trump or Benjamin
[49:39] Netanyahu. This is God doing those
[49:41] things. He's in the midst of his bride.
[49:44] He's causing all these things to come to
[49:46] order because we have a commission in
[49:48] this age. And it's there's not another
[49:50] age coming. This is the final age. And I
[49:53] believe we are the final people and all
[49:56] things are made ready. I say let him
[49:58] come. Even so, Lord, come. Even so,
[50:02] come. Well, I haven't made this uh this
[50:04] this achievement in life. Even so, come
[50:07] Lord. Even so, the bride hath made
[50:10] herself ready, and the spirit in the
[50:12] bride say, "Come." It's time to come.
[50:16] She shall not be moved, for God shall
[50:19] help her. The heathen rage, and the
[50:21] kingdoms removed, and this uttered his
[50:23] voice, and the earth melted, "The Lord
[50:25] of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is
[50:28] our refuge. Come, behold the works of
[50:30] the Lord. What desolations he hath made
[50:32] in the earth. He maketh wars to cease
[50:35] unto the end of the earth. He breakth
[50:36] the bow and cutth the spirit. He burneth
[50:39] the chariot of fire. Be still and know
[50:42] that I am God. I will be exalted among
[50:45] the heathen. I will be exalted in the
[50:46] earth. The L Lord of hosts is with us.
[50:49] The God of Jacob is our refuge. Say
[50:54] what a confidence tonight, church. We're
[50:57] not afraid of what the earth can do or
[50:59] the world can do. We're not afraid of
[51:01] rockets or bombs or we're not afraid of
[51:03] machine guns. We're not afraid of any.
[51:05] Why? Because we have been given a
[51:06] promise in this word that we are hidden
[51:09] in a city of refuge which is the word.
[51:12] While heavens and earth will pass away.
[51:14] They might destroy buildings. They might
[51:16] decimate lands. They might do whatever
[51:18] they can. But this word shall never
[51:20] fail. We're not looking to the left or
[51:23] the right. But now is the time to keep
[51:25] your focus straight down the middle of
[51:27] the road walking in the word. We're not
[51:29] balancing this out by the left or the
[51:31] right. Can you imagine if we try to
[51:33] steer this church based on every wind
[51:35] that came this way and that the problem
[51:37] with that is every time you turn a
[51:38] church based on this doctrine or that
[51:40] doctrine, you'll end up like that guy on
[51:42] the bicycle, right? Brother Brown tells
[51:43] that story about this wind bicycle and
[51:46] how they rode out that that line and a
[51:48] lot of them didn't make it or none of
[51:49] them made it but the one, right? And
[51:51] what did the one do that they didn't? He
[51:52] looked forward.
[51:54] You all know the story, right? So they
[51:56] they tried to ride down the the the rail
[51:58] and they got the free bike and everybody
[52:00] looked to the left or the right and fell
[52:01] off the rail, right? Well, we see a lot
[52:02] of churches, a lot of pastors, a lot of
[52:04] a lot of people that have walked along
[52:06] the way fallen off to the left or the
[52:08] right because they're taking their focus
[52:09] off the end of the line. Well, this
[52:11] brother offended me or this offended me
[52:13] or this doctrine offended me or this
[52:14] fellowship offended me. Don't take your
[52:17] focus off the end of the line. Just keep
[52:19] walking straight down the line and you
[52:21] will make it to the end. That's all
[52:23] we've got to do, friends. We don't need
[52:24] to look to the left or get offended over
[52:26] this or get bothered over this or say,
[52:28] "Why is this this way?" I have a
[52:30] direction set. I have a course in my
[52:33] life and it's the finish line. I'm not
[52:36] settling for anything less than the
[52:38] finish line. And I'm just going to keep
[52:39] my bearings straight on the end of the
[52:41] road and all things will work themselves
[52:44] out. But you see, if we try to balance
[52:45] ourselves based on the wind around us,
[52:48] we're going to find ourselves on shaken
[52:49] ground. Right.
[52:51] But we've got to have a promise to know
[52:53] that the word is true. And all I have to
[52:56] do is stay my bearing on that word.
[52:59] Psalm 61 would say, "Hear my cry, oh
[53:01] God. Attend unto my prayer. From the end
[53:03] of the earth, I will cry unto thee.
[53:05] Where my heart, when my heart is
[53:07] overwhelmed,
[53:09] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[53:11] I." My goodness. I'm sure none of you
[53:14] have ever been overwhelmed before, but I
[53:17] know I know I'm speaking to some real
[53:18] believers tonight. When your heart's
[53:20] overwhelmed, there's only one place you
[53:22] can go to that you can find a soloulless
[53:24] in, you can find a peace in, you can
[53:26] find a rest in, and that rock is the
[53:29] word. Lord, lead me to the word that is
[53:31] higher than I. Lead me to the rock of
[53:33] sure foundation. Lead me to the place
[53:36] where my feet can firmly be planted. Not
[53:38] on my opinion or how I feel or how good
[53:41] I how righteous I might look today. But
[53:43] Lord, lead me to the rock that is always
[53:46] sure. No matter what what the tempest
[53:48] rages, this rock will hold. This rock
[53:52] will remain because it's the word and it
[53:54] can't be moved. Hallelujah.
[53:57] R say this. Knowing everything you're
[53:58] doing, the intents of the heart, what
[54:00] you intend to do, he knows all about it.
[54:02] He knows whether you love him. He knows
[54:04] whether your intentions are right to
[54:06] serve him. He knows all about it. What
[54:08] will it be when you stand that day and
[54:10] if you stand there at that white throne
[54:12] judgment? God, deliver me from that
[54:14] place. Now, this is a prophet saying
[54:15] this. Amen. God, deliver me from that
[54:19] place.
[54:21] I don't want to see that. When an
[54:24] angered God walks out there and the fire
[54:25] flashing from his eyes with
[54:27] righteousness, the white wig over his
[54:28] head like that, his eyes flashing with
[54:31] fire that knows every thought of your
[54:33] heart and everything you ever intended
[54:35] to do. He says, "Oh, hide me over in the
[54:37] rock of ages. Cle for me." Hallelujah. I
[54:41] believe if the prophet of God was was
[54:43] afraid to go under that fiery judgment,
[54:45] then how much us the believer tonight
[54:48] ought to recognize our our our our
[54:50] faults, ought to recognize our
[54:52] inabilities to know that there's no way
[54:54] we could stand under a sovereign judge
[54:56] like that. But I thank God that we're
[54:57] not going to a white wig, but the white
[55:00] wig came to us. That the wig one came to
[55:03] us in this age and he has already judged
[55:05] the bride. And if you stay under the
[55:07] cover of his word, then that judgment
[55:09] has already been made. And said, I put
[55:11] my seal of approval upon this message.
[55:14] And if you could stay under it, then
[55:16] I've already approved you to go out to
[55:18] the finish line. You see, we're not
[55:19] going to a wicked one. But the wicked
[55:21] one came to where we were and looked
[55:23] over the land of the sea and said, "I
[55:25] approve this message. If you could stay
[55:28] under this, then you already made it
[55:30] over there. We're not waiting to be
[55:32] judged. We're already being judged. This
[55:35] Holy Ghost has already sealed us until
[55:37] the day of our redemption. Grieve not
[55:40] the Holy Ghost. Can I say it? Grieve not
[55:43] Christ in this age because you're by
[55:45] that you are sealed until the day of
[55:47] your redemption. It's already been
[55:49] approved. I thank God, Brother Ray,
[55:52] we're not looking to go to a white
[55:53] throne judgment where everything could
[55:55] be on display. But I've already had my
[55:57] judgment here. If I stay under that
[56:00] word, then it's already been approved.
[56:03] This word's already been commanded by
[56:04] God. She goes through. She passes
[56:08] through, right? She's hid away. When all
[56:10] the trouble is going on, she's hid away.
[56:12] Look at Joseph in the scripture. What
[56:14] did he do with his wife? When it came
[56:16] time for the trouble to begin with
[56:17] Israel, he took his gentile wife and he
[56:20] told her to go back into the palace
[56:22] while he handled business. Well, that's
[56:24] me tonight, church. That's us. We're the
[56:26] gentile wife of Christ. And he didn't he
[56:29] didn't put us right into the battle. He
[56:31] tucked us away in the palace right when
[56:33] the trouble was getting hot. So, let's
[56:35] not fear that we're going to go through
[56:37] some kind of some kind of war here, some
[56:40] kind of pressure here. But, Brother Bam
[56:41] said before one bomb falls,
[56:45] she'll be back in the palace. Oh,
[56:48] friends,
[56:50] the tribulation is not my goal. That's
[56:52] not the end of my finish line, but I'm
[56:54] going to go right over the bridge of the
[56:56] tribulation into glory because I've
[56:59] already been judged by the word. The
[57:02] word has said if you stay under this
[57:04] message, you are already approved to go
[57:07] on past that that that dispensation of
[57:10] time. I'll see you at home. I'll see you
[57:14] over there. If we never meet again on
[57:17] earth, my precious friend, I'll see you
[57:19] in the rapture. It's an event of his
[57:22] coming. It's the literal life coming of
[57:24] Jesus Christ in it abide a body of
[57:27] believers. That's us tonight, church.
[57:30] That's what he's coming for. He's coming
[57:32] to fulfill his promise in you.
[57:35] That is that is the breaking of the
[57:37] seventh seal. That is the coming of the
[57:39] third pole. It's not a complex thing.
[57:41] It's the literal life of Christ coming
[57:43] down into a flesh body and vindicating
[57:46] himself once again. Amen. Hallelujah.
[57:50] Only Christ could do that. Only Christ
[57:52] it could be. Well, only Christ it could
[57:54] be that has you still here tonight.
[57:58] Thank you, Lord Jesus. My goodness.
[58:01] Hallelujah. There's two million demons
[58:03] against you.
[58:06] They're not just coming. They're already
[58:07] against you. I know you can feel the
[58:09] pressure of them. There's more there's
[58:11] more pressure in the spiritual world
[58:12] than there's ever been. But I want to
[58:14] encourage you tonight. You're here.
[58:18] Which means if they would have they
[58:19] could have got you, they already would
[58:21] have. If they could have stopped you,
[58:23] they already would have done it. This
[58:25] pressure is not coming. The pressure is
[58:27] here. We're not waiting for the squeeze.
[58:29] The squeeze is already here. The squeeze
[58:31] is on the bride. But you're still here
[58:33] because there's something greater in you
[58:36] than he that's in the world. And that's
[58:38] the literal life of Jesus Christ that
[58:40] came in this age through the
[58:42] dispensation of the Holy Ghost. And
[58:44] that's the only thing that keeps us
[58:46] moving. If it was up to me, I would have
[58:48] given up years ago. But there's
[58:50] something within me, a pulsation of
[58:51] faith that says I must keep going to the
[58:54] prize. I've got to march on to the
[58:56] prize. I cannot quit here. I've got to
[58:58] get my shoes on. I've got to go to the
[59:00] house of the Lord because there is a
[59:02] commission for me in this age that I
[59:05] must fulfill the promise.
[59:08] It's your commission, church. It's it's
[59:10] your commission to fulfill these things
[59:12] in this age. This is not just any age.
[59:14] God didn't just randomly pick people,
[59:16] but he thought of you in his mind and
[59:18] you're here.
[59:22] And when God sent you here, he didn't
[59:23] send you to be a a
[59:27] a billboard for depression, right? Or a
[59:30] billboard for I can hardly make it. No.
[59:32] When God sent you here, he sent you in
[59:34] the age of an overcomer for a reason.
[59:36] Because in his mind, he thought of what
[59:38] an overcomer would look like. and you
[59:40] appeared in the back part of his mind
[59:42] and he cast you into this season into
[59:45] this time into this age because you
[59:48] represent an overcomer. That's who you
[59:50] are, church. God didn't just send you
[59:52] didn't roll dice with his people, his
[59:54] thoughts, but he placed you in this age
[59:56] specifically to be an overcomer.
[1:00:00] Let me say that you could not have
[1:00:01] survived the martyr's age. You could not
[1:00:02] have survived the dark ages. They had an
[1:00:04] anointing for that age. But we also have
[1:00:07] an anointing for this age that no other
[1:00:10] age before us could complete. And they
[1:00:12] without us cannot be made perfect.
[1:00:15] That's why God cast you into this age
[1:00:17] because he said, "I see an overcomer. I
[1:00:19] see an overcoming church. I see a bride
[1:00:22] without spot without wrinkle." What is
[1:00:24] he talking about? Our humanity? No, he's
[1:00:26] talking about our faith in the word of
[1:00:29] Jesus Christ. She's without wrinkle. She
[1:00:31] believes every word. She takes him at
[1:00:34] his word. Where e fail, this Eve will
[1:00:36] not fail. This Eve will stay with the
[1:00:40] word.
[1:00:41] Hallelujah.
[1:00:43] That's why we're here.
[1:00:45] That's the commission we've been given.
[1:00:47] Amen. I'm going to say this. Now, notice
[1:00:49] faith finds a source that others don't
[1:00:51] see. His word is the sword. Hebrews 4:12
[1:00:54] says, "The word of God is sharper than
[1:00:55] two-edged sword. Even discerns the
[1:00:57] thoughts and intents of our heart."
[1:00:58] That's the word of God. And the only
[1:01:00] thing that can hold that sword is the
[1:01:02] hand of faith.
[1:01:04] Hallelujah. That's why on a Sunday
[1:01:05] morning when you when you're holding
[1:01:07] that that sword of faith, the the
[1:01:08] minister will come straight to where
[1:01:10] you're at. Come right down your pew,
[1:01:12] come right down your address. Now, it's
[1:01:14] not brother Samuel, but he's wielding
[1:01:16] Hebrews 4:12. And by the hand of faith,
[1:01:19] the word is still a discerner of the
[1:01:20] thoughts and intents of our heart and
[1:01:22] still knows exactly where we're at and
[1:01:24] where we're going through, but it can
[1:01:25] only be held by a hand of faith. Right?
[1:01:29] See, when God sent us to this age, he
[1:01:30] didn't send us here empty-handed, but he
[1:01:32] sent something with us to make it
[1:01:34] through.
[1:01:36] Where did David get his sling?
[1:01:40] Well, God sent it to him. Where did
[1:01:42] Samson find the jawbone?
[1:01:44] Where did Where did Shamgar get an ax
[1:01:46] go?
[1:01:48] When God sent you to this age, he didn't
[1:01:50] just send you here with no protection or
[1:01:52] no weapon against the enemy. But he sent
[1:01:54] you to this age equipped with everything
[1:01:56] you would need to overcome every trial
[1:01:59] that would be before you in this age.
[1:02:01] And I think about a prophet who was
[1:02:02] there in a mountain one time and rose up
[1:02:04] his hand. And what was it that came in
[1:02:06] his hand? It was a sword. Where did he
[1:02:08] get that sword? Well, God brought down
[1:02:10] that sword, right? And he said, "This is
[1:02:12] this is my covenant with you. this sword
[1:02:14] that your message shall forrun what
[1:02:17] another sword.
[1:02:19] Let me just say that that sword didn't
[1:02:21] just fit brother Brandham's hand, but it
[1:02:23] fit every message believer's hand in the
[1:02:25] world to come that we would raise our
[1:02:28] hand of faith. And you know what we'd
[1:02:29] say, brother Ray? It fits. This message,
[1:02:32] it fits. It fits right like a glove in a
[1:02:35] hand. It fits. It fits exactly like he
[1:02:37] said it would. I don't have to try to
[1:02:39] mesh it. I don't have to try to force
[1:02:41] it, but it fits. And I say it's found a
[1:02:44] hand of faith again that can put it to
[1:02:46] use. And this is the coming of the third
[1:02:48] pole. It's not coming. It's here. It's
[1:02:52] arrived, friends. It's in your hand.
[1:02:54] What is that in your hand? Well, it's
[1:02:56] just a stick. Is it just a stick? Is
[1:02:59] this just a message in your hand? Or is
[1:03:01] this the coming of the king? Is this the
[1:03:03] Is this the king's message that's in
[1:03:05] your hand that every demon has to flee
[1:03:08] when this sword is presented? It has no
[1:03:11] power. That demon has no power when this
[1:03:14] message is presented because it's been
[1:03:16] defeated before.
[1:03:20] What sword was it that cast them out of
[1:03:21] heaven in the beginning?
[1:03:25] The same sword presented to the believer
[1:03:28] tonight. To think that the sword you're
[1:03:30] holding is the very same sword that cast
[1:03:33] Lucifer out of heaven when all this
[1:03:35] started. And to think that if he fell by
[1:03:36] that sword once, hallelujah. If you put
[1:03:40] that same sword in a hand of faith
[1:03:42] tonight, it will cast Lucifer out again
[1:03:45] where he has no hold, he has no power,
[1:03:48] he has no authority over you because
[1:03:50] you've been given a commission by the
[1:03:52] king and the king gave you his scepter.
[1:03:55] He gave you all the power that you
[1:03:57] needed. And just representation alone of
[1:04:00] that sword will cause the enemy to run.
[1:04:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:04:05] Hallelujah. By a hand of faith. Nothing
[1:04:07] else can do it. Nothing else. Ah, we see
[1:04:10] some otherwise scientific or
[1:04:11] scientifically educational. You can't
[1:04:13] hold on to that sword. You can't do it
[1:04:16] by education. It's too twisted, too
[1:04:18] complicated. You make it, it'll make it.
[1:04:19] You see, an educational uh an
[1:04:21] educational mind to this word would try
[1:04:23] to over complicate and say, "Well, it
[1:04:25] just couldn't work that way." But I
[1:04:27] would just like to ask a question
[1:04:28] tonight. If if go if God if it just
[1:04:31] couldn't work through you,
[1:04:33] then God's not God. That's right.
[1:04:37] Well, it just couldn't work through me.
[1:04:38] I'm just not that way or I just don't
[1:04:39] have the faith. That's what makes God
[1:04:41] God
[1:04:45] because God works through the impossible
[1:04:47] things. And you might be thinking, I'm
[1:04:49] the least among all these people in
[1:04:50] here. There's no way that this word is
[1:04:52] going to work that way through me. And I
[1:04:53] said, "Praise God." That's what makes
[1:04:56] God God because he seeks out the
[1:04:58] impossible things and he makes it a
[1:05:01] reality to them. You say, "There's no
[1:05:02] way to get out of my condition. I I
[1:05:05] think God is God. And if God is God,
[1:05:07] then there's a way for you to get out.
[1:05:08] Because God specializes in impossible
[1:05:11] things. You see, as humans, as an
[1:05:14] educational mind, we think in a linear
[1:05:15] motion. We think in time. We think,
[1:05:17] "Well, this has got to happen, and this
[1:05:18] has got to happen." We're serving a
[1:05:20] great big God who is looking at this
[1:05:22] from an array on high. And he's saying,
[1:05:24] "What is that to me to take that cancer?
[1:05:26] What is that to me to fix that mind?
[1:05:28] What is that to me to call that prodigal
[1:05:30] back home?" You see, with God, nothing
[1:05:32] shall be impossible.
[1:05:36] This is God we're talking about. And if
[1:05:38] you think a situation's impossible, I
[1:05:41] say praise God. I I think that's an
[1:05:43] opportunity for God to be God. For God
[1:05:46] to come on the scene and change it. It
[1:05:48] doesn't have to work out in the realms
[1:05:49] of three dimensions. But we're serving a
[1:05:51] supernatural God.
[1:05:54] And when it doesn't make sense to us, we
[1:05:55] think, well, there's no way for this to
[1:05:56] come around or there's no way for this
[1:05:58] to circle through. God's God.
[1:06:02] I think it's time we we lay aside the
[1:06:04] three dimensions. Let me say that your
[1:06:06] doubts will fail you. Like brother
[1:06:08] Bosworth said, don't believe your
[1:06:09] doubts. Doubt your doubts because they
[1:06:11] are unreliable. But put faith in the
[1:06:13] word of God because it has never failed
[1:06:16] you. And if God said you can make it,
[1:06:18] then I say, bless God, I'm going to make
[1:06:20] it. I say, "Praise the Lord. He has
[1:06:22] given me a promise in this hour that I
[1:06:25] am going to make it through. I'm going
[1:06:27] to make it." Why? because he already
[1:06:29] said I would. Hallelujah. And no demon
[1:06:32] can take that authority from you because
[1:06:35] it came from a higher place than where
[1:06:37] he's at. You see, that's why brother
[1:06:39] Brandon would call the devil a bluff cuz
[1:06:40] he's trying to bluff you out of your
[1:06:41] promise that he can't even reach the
[1:06:43] shelf of. And God took it down and
[1:06:45] handed it to you and said, "This is your
[1:06:47] promise." The devil would like to tell
[1:06:49] you, "No, you can't have that." But he
[1:06:51] doesn't even have access to see it on
[1:06:52] the shelf. And God brought it down to
[1:06:54] you and said, "This is your gift,
[1:06:57] church. This is your gift. I think it's
[1:06:58] time we take God at his word and say, "I
[1:07:00] take every blessing. I take every
[1:07:02] promise. I take every scripture. I take
[1:07:04] everything that you've given to the
[1:07:06] church and I wanted to put it action in
[1:07:08] my life. I wanted to put it into motion
[1:07:10] in my life. If you said that they shall
[1:07:12] lay their hands on the sick and they
[1:07:14] shall recover, I want to put that
[1:07:15] scripture in action in my life. If you
[1:07:18] said that there would be a a returning
[1:07:19] of the prodigals of the end time, I'm
[1:07:21] going to put that action into my life.
[1:07:23] Whatever promise the word gave to me, I
[1:07:26] want to put it in action.
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:29] Hallelujah. These promises are just
[1:07:31] amongst us looking for a hand of faith
[1:07:33] to manifest it. I say, "Lord, use my
[1:07:36] hand. Lord, use my situation. Use use my
[1:07:39] prayer. Use my my plea tonight." It's a
[1:07:42] supernatural God looking for someone to
[1:07:45] manifest himself in. I say, "Don't look
[1:07:47] no further, Lord."
[1:07:50] Amen. If you're blessing somebody in
[1:07:52] this season, which I know you are, Lord,
[1:07:54] stop by my way. Stop by my pew. Stop by
[1:07:57] my situation. Come by my home. Start a
[1:08:00] revival back among my family, among my
[1:08:02] home. And Lord, come back into my
[1:08:04] marriage. Lord, come back into my
[1:08:06] conversation. Lord, if you're coming by
[1:08:08] this way, stop by my pew, Lord. If you
[1:08:12] want to manifest yourself, Lord, here am
[1:08:15] I. Here am I. Oh my. Can you imagine
[1:08:19] tonight that maybe the the the the
[1:08:21] whoever runs the the state power ball
[1:08:23] was in here tonight and said we're going
[1:08:24] to pick one winner out of here. You
[1:08:26] thinking none of us would raise our
[1:08:27] hand.
[1:08:30] I've got whatever whatever million
[1:08:32] dollars to give away and I'm just
[1:08:34] looking for somebody to give it to.
[1:08:38] Well, man, I'm going to scratch my head
[1:08:39] for a second, but if I'm I'm looking
[1:08:40] around, I don't see anybody else raising
[1:08:42] their hand. Brother Brian, ain't going
[1:08:42] to take me very long.
[1:08:47] Amen. Right. Why? Cuz he's giving it
[1:08:49] away.
[1:08:51] And here we are serving a supernatural
[1:08:53] God that has healing, that has power,
[1:08:55] that has atonement, that has holy ghost
[1:08:57] filling, and he's trying to give it away
[1:08:58] to the church. And the church is
[1:09:00] apprehensive to raise their hand. But I
[1:09:02] say no more. I'm going to break out of
[1:09:04] that shell and say, "Lord, here am I. I
[1:09:06] want it all. I want everything you've
[1:09:08] got for the church. I want every
[1:09:10] blessing you've got for me. I want every
[1:09:12] promise that's in the book. Lord, hide
[1:09:14] me under that promise. hide me under
[1:09:16] that word. Let the let the world do what
[1:09:18] it's doing, but let me abide under the
[1:09:21] shadow of the wing of the Almighty.
[1:09:24] Hallelujah.
[1:09:26] You can't do it by education. Amen.
[1:09:29] It'll to try to deny itself. You cannot
[1:09:31] do it. It's hid from you. So, forget
[1:09:33] about it. You can't know it. It's hid.
[1:09:35] And when God hides anything,
[1:09:39] it's really hid. Amen.
[1:09:44] Amen. Man, I could take off and preach a
[1:09:46] lot of ways, but I just got to stay on
[1:09:48] focus here. That's the reason that you
[1:09:52] are so hid. If you are a Christian, you
[1:09:55] are dead and your life is hiding God
[1:09:56] through Jesus Christ and sealed by the
[1:09:58] Holy Ghost. How is the devil going to
[1:10:01] find you? He can't do it. You're hid.
[1:10:05] God hides you. Amen. What a hiding place
[1:10:08] in the bosom of Jesus Christ. What a
[1:10:10] hiding place tonight. The devil cannot
[1:10:13] find you. We're not playing
[1:10:14] hide-and-seek as little kids where we
[1:10:16] look for a good spot and you know we
[1:10:18] think nobody's going to find us out. But
[1:10:19] when God hides you,
[1:10:21] it's in another world.
[1:10:24] It's in another dimension. It's in a
[1:10:26] place where the devil doesn't have
[1:10:27] access to. You can say God is not
[1:10:29] playing by the rules cuz he didn't hide
[1:10:32] you down here where the devil can get to
[1:10:33] you. But when God ever hides you, the
[1:10:36] devil cannot find you because he has no
[1:10:38] way to access where you are. He's not
[1:10:41] tall enough to get there. He's not
[1:10:43] strong enough to break through it. He's
[1:10:44] not mighty enough to enter into that
[1:10:46] place. When God hides you, the devil
[1:10:48] can't even find you. He can't even see
[1:10:50] you. He doesn't even know where you're
[1:10:52] at. He can't smell you. He can't sniff
[1:10:54] you down. You are hidden in the bosom of
[1:10:57] Jesus Christ.
[1:10:59] Hallelujah. You're free. You're hid away
[1:11:02] in the time of trouble. But David would
[1:11:04] say it like this in the 27th Psalm.
[1:11:06] Psalm of David. The Lord is my light and
[1:11:09] my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The
[1:11:13] Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom
[1:11:16] shall I be afraid? This is coming from
[1:11:19] David who had his fair share of battles
[1:11:22] with the enemy, who had his fair share
[1:11:23] of battles with demonic oppression. But
[1:11:25] this is coming from David, a man who was
[1:11:27] given a revelation. Hallelujah. A man
[1:11:30] who was given a rock of revelation
[1:11:32] tonight. When the wicked, even my
[1:11:34] enemies and my foes came upon me to eat
[1:11:36] me up my flesh, they stumbled and they
[1:11:38] fell.
[1:11:40] Though in host should encamp against me,
[1:11:42] my heart shall not fear. Though war
[1:11:44] should rise against me, in this will I
[1:11:46] be confident. One thing have I desired
[1:11:49] of the Lord, that will I seek after.
[1:11:52] Amen. And that I may dwell. Hallelujah.
[1:11:56] David wasn't seeking after superpowers.
[1:11:59] He wasn't seeking after to be lifted up
[1:12:01] among all his brethren or to be lifted
[1:12:03] on high or to be glorified or magnified.
[1:12:05] He said, "One thing that I seek after,
[1:12:08] and that's that I may dwell in the house
[1:12:10] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[1:12:13] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:12:16] inquire in his temple. For in the time
[1:12:19] of trouble, he shall hide me in his
[1:12:22] pavilion." Hallelujah.
[1:12:24] In the time of right now, he shall hide
[1:12:27] the church in his pavilion. In the
[1:12:30] secret of his tabernacle, shall he hide
[1:12:33] me. He shall set me upon a rock. That's
[1:12:36] why David could say, "If I could just be
[1:12:39] the doormat in the house of God, I'm in
[1:12:41] the house. I'm in the rock. I'm in a
[1:12:44] place where the devil cannot get to me.
[1:12:46] Doesn't matter if anybody knows my name.
[1:12:48] I'm in the house." You might you
[1:12:50] probably heard this quoted before. You
[1:12:52] might be the bottom of of the of the
[1:12:54] skin on the bottom of the foot, but
[1:12:56] you're still above the devil.
[1:12:59] You're still higher than the devil. And
[1:13:01] where David would say, I might be the
[1:13:02] doormat at the front of the house, but
[1:13:05] I'm in the house. I'm in the place where
[1:13:07] I need to be. I'm in the rock. I'm safe
[1:13:10] from all harm. I'm in the house. It
[1:13:13] doesn't matter if if if I ever hold a
[1:13:15] microphone. I'm in the house.
[1:13:18] It doesn't matter if I can sing on key.
[1:13:20] I'm in the house. It doesn't matter what
[1:13:22] everybody else thinks about me. I'm in
[1:13:24] the house. If you could just be the
[1:13:25] doormat in the house of the Lord. You're
[1:13:28] safe. Yes, sir. He made it. He's in.
[1:13:32] Close the door. Seal it. Let's go. It's
[1:13:35] rapture time. Hide me in his pavilion.
[1:13:39] Amen. Amen. Brother Bam, of course,
[1:13:41] would take that scripture for his
[1:13:42] rapture sermon. What is he telling you?
[1:13:44] The rapture is being hidden in the word.
[1:13:46] All right.
[1:13:48] And if you can get so lost in this word,
[1:13:51] this mortal body will fall away because
[1:13:53] it cannot stand the pressure of where
[1:13:55] that word can take you. This word can
[1:13:58] take you places under the anointing of
[1:14:00] this hour that this body can just it
[1:14:02] can't stand. That's why sometimes you
[1:14:03] just got to shout. Sometimes you just
[1:14:05] got to dance. Why? Because something has
[1:14:07] overcome this mortal body and it just
[1:14:10] can't take it anymore. It's got to
[1:14:12] release. It's got to break through. It's
[1:14:14] got to get out of here. You see, one of
[1:14:16] these mornings, I believe there's going
[1:14:18] to be an anointing of God cuz sweep
[1:14:20] through this building, and we'll be so
[1:14:22] caught up with the anointing that this
[1:14:23] mortal body, it cannot stand it anymore.
[1:14:27] That theophony will have to come rescue
[1:14:29] this spirit. That theophony will have to
[1:14:32] come take this soul out of this old body
[1:14:34] and take it to another place where I can
[1:14:36] have joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:14:40] where I can tell the other half, where I
[1:14:43] can tell what's going on, where we can
[1:14:44] have genuine fellowship together, and
[1:14:46] it's not trying to express it, but we
[1:14:49] understand.
[1:14:52] It's a reality, friends. This is a
[1:14:54] destination.
[1:14:56] This is somewhere we're headed. It's our
[1:14:58] rock.
[1:15:01] He is my rock. Psalm 62 would say, "He
[1:15:04] only is my rock and my salvation. He is
[1:15:06] my defense. I shall not be moved.
[1:15:10] The rock of my strength and my refuge
[1:15:13] is in God.
[1:15:16] Of course, you know what a rock is
[1:15:17] referred to in the scripture. It's a
[1:15:18] revelation, right?
[1:15:21] Yeah. With Peter, he would say, "Upon
[1:15:22] this rock, I will build my church." Now,
[1:15:25] brother Brandham takes us and he tells
[1:15:26] us what that rock is. It was the
[1:15:28] revelation of who Christ was in front of
[1:15:30] Peter.
[1:15:32] The same revelation today is where
[1:15:35] Christ is building his church upon the
[1:15:37] same foundation to recognize where
[1:15:39] Christ is today.
[1:15:42] Well, some say
[1:15:45] some say it's this. Some say it's just a
[1:15:47] man. Some say you're just you're just
[1:15:49] wasting your evenings or you're wasting
[1:15:51] your Sunday mornings or you're wasting
[1:15:52] your life. Well, I don't really care
[1:15:54] what some say
[1:15:56] because in a few days it ain't going to
[1:15:57] matter what they say. That's right,
[1:16:00] friends. There's never been a time to
[1:16:02] press the battle like right now. There's
[1:16:04] never been a time to witness for lost
[1:16:06] souls like there has been right now. We
[1:16:07] say, "Well, there's got to be you got to
[1:16:09] be skillful when witnessing." But I
[1:16:10] believe the hour has changed when
[1:16:12] there's seed or there's not seed. And I
[1:16:14] believe we should present the word of
[1:16:16] God to the people and say, "This is the
[1:16:18] truth of the hour." And they either
[1:16:19] receive it or reject it. When when Jesus
[1:16:21] came to the final hour on the cross,
[1:16:23] there was two other thieves. There was
[1:16:25] two thieves on the cross, right? He just
[1:16:28] laid it out there. I'm the son of God.
[1:16:30] One accepted it, one rejected it. But
[1:16:32] the one that accepted it was with him
[1:16:34] that day in paradise. Friend, you see,
[1:16:36] you don't know. You don't know who
[1:16:37] you're talking to. Sometimes it may be
[1:16:39] the last seed that we're waiting for.
[1:16:41] So, I implore the church. Witness to
[1:16:44] them because I want to get out of here.
[1:16:46] Tell them the truth of the hour because
[1:16:48] we got to go. We should be trying to
[1:16:51] bring everybody in. Everybody in that we
[1:16:53] can't get in the ark. Get in Christ.
[1:16:56] Come under the shadow of the Almighty.
[1:16:58] Come under the wing of his covering.
[1:17:00] Amen. Amen. Come under this protection.
[1:17:03] Amen. We don't want to see anybody lost.
[1:17:05] It's up to him. It's God who who planted
[1:17:08] that seed. He's the swer. Amen. But we
[1:17:12] have to be responsible for what we've
[1:17:13] been given. And we've been given uh the
[1:17:16] greatest revelation that has struck the
[1:17:17] face of the earth that Christ is not in
[1:17:19] a tomb somewhere, but he's alive and
[1:17:22] he's well and he's moving in the midst
[1:17:24] of his people. Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] Matthew would say, "A wise man in the
[1:17:29] seventh chapter in the 27th 24th verse."
[1:17:31] Therefore, whosoever he hearth these
[1:17:32] things of mine and doeth him, I will
[1:17:35] liken him unto a wise man, which built
[1:17:38] his house upon a rock. And the rain
[1:17:40] descended, and the floods came, and the
[1:17:42] winds blew, and beat upon that house,
[1:17:43] and it fell not. Hallelujah.
[1:17:47] You're still here, friend. For it was
[1:17:49] founded upon a rock. Hallelujah. That's
[1:17:53] why it won't work if I can talk you into
[1:17:55] it. That's right. It won't work if I can
[1:17:57] have a therapy session with you and
[1:17:58] convince you that you're something.
[1:18:00] You've got to have a revelation of the
[1:18:02] same rock that I have a revelation of
[1:18:04] because the winds are going to come and
[1:18:05] the storms are going to come and
[1:18:07] somebody smarter than me is going to
[1:18:09] come and somebody's going to come shake
[1:18:10] you out of that. Unless you have a
[1:18:12] revelation that came from the same rock
[1:18:14] that mine came from that told me that
[1:18:17] this is way above your human intellect.
[1:18:19] My thoughts are above your thoughts. My
[1:18:21] ways above your ways. and I have elected
[1:18:23] you before the foundation of the world
[1:18:26] to be the fulfillment of this bride in
[1:18:28] this hour. I say, Lord, I'm not worthy,
[1:18:30] but I accept. Lord, I'm not worthy, but
[1:18:33] I want it. I want all that you've got
[1:18:35] for me. If you're going to tell me,
[1:18:37] service in and service out, that I'm the
[1:18:39] bride, I think it's time to accept it
[1:18:41] and say, "Lord, yes, I am. Lord, I've
[1:18:44] come to my moment. Yes, I accept that I
[1:18:46] am the bride of Jesus Christ. And
[1:18:48] therefore, all of the blessings that
[1:18:50] have been promised to her are mine.
[1:18:54] Every promise in the scripture is mine.
[1:18:56] Why are we running from something that
[1:18:58] he's trying to give us? He's chasing us
[1:19:00] down, saying, "You're my bride. You're
[1:19:02] my bride. Oh no, I'm unworthy. Oh no,
[1:19:04] I'm unworthy. Oh no, I'm unworthy."
[1:19:06] Yeah, he knows that.
[1:19:09] That's what makes him God because you
[1:19:11] weren't worthy, but he's worthy enough
[1:19:13] for you.
[1:19:14] He's worthy enough for whatever
[1:19:16] situation you've been through. And he
[1:19:18] said, "Just accept it tonight." Amen. Oh
[1:19:22] Jesus. I recognize you've come in my
[1:19:25] age. And I recognize you've called me as
[1:19:27] your bride and I choose to accept it. I
[1:19:30] think if God cared enough to send it in
[1:19:31] this age, and we ought to care enough to
[1:19:33] walk into it. Oh, come on, friends. if
[1:19:36] he cared enough to cause a man to to
[1:19:38] live his life above the world, some
[1:19:40] seventh grade education, Kentucky hill
[1:19:43] and raise him up. Not so we glorify a
[1:19:45] man or we drive fors. That was never the
[1:19:48] point, right? I drive a Ford, so I'm not
[1:19:50] mad. But that wasn't the point of this,
[1:19:53] right? If he cared enough to cause the
[1:19:57] sword to come down this age to open them
[1:19:58] seals, right? Then do you care enough to
[1:20:01] walk through it? care enough to walk
[1:20:03] through the opening of that word and
[1:20:04] say, "I take every promise that's mine.
[1:20:07] I I'm not looking back. I'm not a frog.
[1:20:09] I'm not looking back to my old ways."
[1:20:11] But I have a new destination. I have a
[1:20:14] new bearing. My bearing is
[1:20:15] straightforward in every promise of the
[1:20:17] word. His words are yay and amen. Let
[1:20:20] every man's word be a lie. And let God's
[1:20:22] word be the truth because he knows the
[1:20:24] beginning from the end. And he knows
[1:20:26] your outcome.
[1:20:28] You might say, "Well, it's not me."
[1:20:30] Well, it is you. I I want to I want to
[1:20:32] plead with you tonight to recognize who
[1:20:34] you are. This word came for you. This
[1:20:37] promise came to you. It came to declare
[1:20:39] you as a free bride of Christ in this
[1:20:42] age. You're free.
[1:20:47] Hallelujah. I got no prespter telling me
[1:20:49] what to preach. I ain't got no big
[1:20:51] bishop telling me how to act or what to
[1:20:53] why? Cuz I'm a free man. And free men
[1:20:56] can do what they want to do. And if I'm
[1:20:58] a free man, then I can praise him when I
[1:21:00] want to. If I want to stop in my truck
[1:21:02] on the side of the road and praise him,
[1:21:03] I can. Why? Cuz I'm free. If I want to
[1:21:06] dance in the house of God, I can. Why?
[1:21:08] Cuz I'm free. I got no label on me. I've
[1:21:11] been made free. Who the son has made
[1:21:14] free is free indeed.
[1:21:17] You see, we've got to get in the spirit
[1:21:18] of being the bride. It's got to become
[1:21:21] familiar to us to be the bride. Stop
[1:21:23] acting like you don't belong here when
[1:21:25] he called this meeting for you. He
[1:21:28] called this whole plan to come together
[1:21:30] for you. Hallelujah. Recognize you're
[1:21:32] the bride. Come in the spirit of it.
[1:21:34] Right. That's where brother said. First
[1:21:35] you got to get in the spirit of it
[1:21:36] before you can do anything. You can't do
[1:21:38] anything until first you get in the
[1:21:40] spirit of it.
[1:21:42] Well, if we're going to receive the
[1:21:43] bride's blessings, then we ought to be
[1:21:45] in the spirit of the bride.
[1:21:48] Right. Amen. And he said his bride's
[1:21:51] free. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:21:55] Free,
[1:21:57] no chains.
[1:21:59] There. There's no bondage on you.
[1:22:01] There's no reproach against you. There's
[1:22:03] no Egyptians that have a story on you
[1:22:05] because those Egyptians were killed in
[1:22:07] the Red Sea. They don't even know what
[1:22:09] happened. Those people, those stories
[1:22:11] died a long time ago because you're
[1:22:13] hidden somewhere where those voices
[1:22:15] cannot reach. They say, "Oh, well, if
[1:22:18] you knew my past,
[1:22:20] there's no way for me to know it because
[1:22:22] it never happened."
[1:22:26] It's as if you never did it in the first
[1:22:29] place. When you come under the bride's
[1:22:31] commission, you're taking every promise
[1:22:33] that's applied to the bride and she's
[1:22:35] hidden away under the shadow of the
[1:22:37] Almighty. It's as if she never did it in
[1:22:40] the first place. It's hidden. It's
[1:22:42] hidden Christ. And when God ever
[1:22:45] destroys something, let me tell you,
[1:22:46] brother, it's destroyed. That lake of
[1:22:49] fire doesn't have no return. It doesn't
[1:22:51] have no resurrection of your dead sins.
[1:22:53] It is destroyed in the sea of God's
[1:22:57] forgetfulness. It will not return
[1:23:00] because God hath annihilated it from
[1:23:02] existence because in his mind, it never
[1:23:05] happened.
[1:23:08] The only thing that's true is what God
[1:23:10] sees. The only thing that's true is what
[1:23:12] God proclaims. And he doesn't see your
[1:23:15] fault.
[1:23:18] There's somebody bigger between you and
[1:23:20] him.
[1:23:23] There's somebody there's a
[1:23:24] representation there. And when he sees
[1:23:26] that representation, that's all he sees
[1:23:29] is the blood of Jesus Christ who never
[1:23:31] sinned, who never had a bad thought, who
[1:23:34] never had a bad day, who never made a
[1:23:36] mistake, who who never turned the wrong
[1:23:38] direction, but he did nothing until
[1:23:39] first the father showed him to do it. So
[1:23:42] it was in ordination with the perfect
[1:23:43] word of God. And there's our example
[1:23:46] before us. You can hear me,
[1:23:49] but you can't see me. You can hear my
[1:23:52] praises, but you can't see me. You can
[1:23:54] hear me singing the songs of Zion, but
[1:23:56] you can't see me. Why? Because I'm hid
[1:23:58] in the blood. I'm hid under a place
[1:24:01] where you can't see my faults. You can't
[1:24:03] see my failures. And God doesn't see him
[1:24:05] either because he gave us a
[1:24:07] representation to stand under. And if we
[1:24:10] abide under this covering, then all that
[1:24:12] we are is hid away. Hid away. There is
[1:24:16] no past in God. He's an everpresent God.
[1:24:19] He's beginning and end and in the
[1:24:21] middle. There is no past. He's
[1:24:23] everywhere. You say, "Oh, my past."
[1:24:26] There's no past to God. Come on,
[1:24:28] friends. Invisible union, right?
[1:24:30] Speaking of a bride message. If there's
[1:24:32] ever a message that was ordained to the
[1:24:33] bride, it's the invisible union of Jesus
[1:24:36] Christ. It's as if you never did it in
[1:24:39] the first place.
[1:24:42] Friends, I'd be afraid if these were my
[1:24:43] words, but they're not my words. So, I
[1:24:45] can come underneath him and say, "That's
[1:24:47] the word of an almighty God coming down
[1:24:49] in this age, saying to his bride, "Come
[1:24:51] in, my bride. I have made a way for you.
[1:24:54] I have cleared the path for you. There
[1:24:56] is no sin held against you. There's
[1:24:58] nothing holding you back. You're free to
[1:25:00] go. You're free to come in and enjoy the
[1:25:03] splendor of my kingdom. You were made
[1:25:05] for such a time as this, bride. This is
[1:25:08] our time. This is our generation. This
[1:25:10] is our dispensation. Let's not wait for
[1:25:13] another day to come. This is our day.
[1:25:16] This is the fullness of times. This is
[1:25:18] when all things are made ready. We're
[1:25:20] here, friends. Yeah. What else are we
[1:25:22] waiting for?
[1:25:26] Wars, rumors of wars, leaderships of the
[1:25:28] world coming down against each other.
[1:25:30] Oh, come on, friends. We've had this
[1:25:31] pictured out for for 60 years. When the
[1:25:35] king of the north comes down and the
[1:25:37] bamboo curtain comes down,
[1:25:40] don't forget about the purple curtain.
[1:25:42] Never have we had a purple curtain from
[1:25:45] the United States before, but he said
[1:25:46] they would be tied together. And here we
[1:25:48] are living in the days Amen.
[1:25:53] Amen. Sure. Yeah, he could have met a
[1:25:55] different pope from the United States,
[1:25:56] but what about all the other current
[1:25:58] events that are happening? What about
[1:25:59] everything else that's being tied
[1:26:01] together at the same time? And what
[1:26:02] about the pull inside of me to say this
[1:26:04] is it. This is the finish. This is I'm
[1:26:07] not going to go by the grave, but I see
[1:26:09] a body change just around the corner.
[1:26:11] Over the next hill I look, I see
[1:26:13] victory. Why? Because this is my time.
[1:26:16] There's a pull within me that says this
[1:26:18] is it. This is rapture time. This is
[1:26:21] body change time. This is when he comes
[1:26:24] in fullness. There's a pull within the
[1:26:26] church to say, "I'm not giving up. I'm
[1:26:30] going to push like I've never pushed
[1:26:31] before. I give all my strength. I give
[1:26:34] all my money. I give everything that I
[1:26:36] am because we're so close to the finish
[1:26:38] line." Amen. Church, don't be distracted
[1:26:41] now. You've come too far. You've given
[1:26:45] up too too much. You you've won too many
[1:26:47] battles and lost too many battles to
[1:26:50] give up where you're at now. That's
[1:26:52] right.
[1:26:53] Don't look to the left or the right by
[1:26:55] every contrary wind of doctrine that
[1:26:57] comes our way. We're not a reed shaking
[1:27:00] about in the wind. But we've been given
[1:27:02] a prophetic promise in this age. Amen.
[1:27:04] And the only reason you see it is
[1:27:06] because you're prophetic class of
[1:27:07] people.
[1:27:10] The truth. He sent He sent you to
[1:27:12] receive.
[1:27:14] Amen.
[1:27:16] quarterback's not throwing that pass
[1:27:17] until that receiver comes into place.
[1:27:20] You know about a long bomb, he has to
[1:27:23] look way down the line for that for that
[1:27:26] long bomb touchdown. And that receiver
[1:27:29] is not even in the scene yet. He's still
[1:27:31] back behind the 25 yd line. But by the
[1:27:34] time that ball gets there, hallelujah,
[1:27:36] by the time that ball lands in 2025,
[1:27:40] there's a receiver there to catch it.
[1:27:42] And there was a prophet just a few years
[1:27:44] ago that forecasted a promise and it I
[1:27:47] wasn't on the scene yet. But by the time
[1:27:49] that that promise got to my scene, I was
[1:27:52] right on time. I was right there to cast
[1:27:54] the promise. And you know what? We're at
[1:27:56] the goal line, friends. We've just got a
[1:27:58] few steps to make and we're over in the
[1:28:00] glory land. I say, don't give up,
[1:28:02] church. Don't be discouraged. Don't be
[1:28:04] dismayed. Don't give up one inch of
[1:28:06] ground, but stand your ground in the
[1:28:08] word, for God has given it to you in
[1:28:11] this age.
[1:28:13] It's your possession.
[1:28:15] Stop trying to be the bride and be the
[1:28:17] bride. Stop trying to be the fulfillment
[1:28:20] of it and say, "It's me, mama. It's me.
[1:28:23] I'm the one. I'm the one he came for. I
[1:28:25] recognize it. Deity is not in heaven."
[1:28:30] Hallelujah.
[1:28:32] Well, God would have done some mighty
[1:28:34] things if he'd had picked the best
[1:28:36] righteous man. If he'd have picked the
[1:28:37] rich young ruler, that would have been a
[1:28:40] mighty thing. But you see, that's just
[1:28:42] not the way God does things. He looks
[1:28:44] for the impossible. He looks for the
[1:28:46] Zakius. He looks for He looks for the
[1:28:48] Peter. He looks for He looks for the
[1:28:51] Matthew and the Mark and the Luke. And
[1:28:52] you know what? He looks for the Saul.
[1:28:54] Amen. And makes him a Paul.
[1:28:57] Because if he could if he could have
[1:28:58] done something mighty, he could have put
[1:28:59] deity in that rich young ruler. But he
[1:29:01] didn't. Why? Because he wanted to show
[1:29:03] that his seed will come out no matter
[1:29:05] what the devil has put against them. If
[1:29:07] I have a seed in this age, there is no
[1:29:10] sin. There's no barrier. There's no
[1:29:12] depression. There's no anxiety. There's
[1:29:14] no nervousness that can hold them from
[1:29:16] coming to their final destination.
[1:29:18] Because my word is more sure than any
[1:29:21] feeling of any denominion, any feeling
[1:29:23] of any suicide, any feeling of any any
[1:29:26] spirit in this age. My word's more sure.
[1:29:30] Sure, he could have come to the rich
[1:29:31] young ruler. But the rich young ruler
[1:29:32] didn't have the seed. But Paul had the
[1:29:34] seed in him. Paul had the seed all
[1:29:37] along. Even when he didn't look like a
[1:29:39] Christian, he wasn't trying to be a
[1:29:40] Christian. He wasn't trying to be a
[1:29:42] message believer. He was so full of his
[1:29:44] own works. You would have thought God
[1:29:46] will never use that man. But God has a
[1:29:48] way. God has a way to get our attention
[1:29:52] to knock us off our high horse so that
[1:29:54] he might come to us in our moment of
[1:29:56] need and become light to us. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:00] And when the light comes, the darkness
[1:30:02] is already defeated. Hallelujah.
[1:30:05] You see, friends, we're not here just by
[1:30:07] circumstance.
[1:30:09] But we're here because Christ has sent
[1:30:11] us into this age. And yes, he recognized
[1:30:13] that it would be the most turbulent age
[1:30:14] that there ever would be.
[1:30:17] Amen.
[1:30:20] Did Brother Brandon fill up those vials
[1:30:22] on the on the seven ages? Did he color
[1:30:24] those in? No. The handwriting on the
[1:30:26] wall did. Remember when it came in the
[1:30:27] back of the tabernacle and it caused
[1:30:29] those those that monora to come with the
[1:30:31] seven ages there and it filled in those
[1:30:32] those dials. Who colored that in? The
[1:30:34] Holy Ghost did. He knew how dark the age
[1:30:38] was that we're living in. Just a little
[1:30:39] bit of light left. He knew how dark that
[1:30:41] this situation would be. But he still
[1:30:43] sent you anyway. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:30:47] He sent you because he's got confidence
[1:30:49] in you. Brother man would say this
[1:30:50] looking at the See, when a man once
[1:30:52] catches that vision of an invisible God
[1:30:55] and know that he's always present,
[1:30:57] there's something that stabilizes that
[1:30:59] man's thinking.
[1:31:01] He knows God is there with him. It
[1:31:04] stabilizes his actions. And in the time
[1:31:06] of distress and trouble, it'll still
[1:31:08] make him look upward and above the
[1:31:10] things that are happening around him
[1:31:12] because he's looking at the unseen.
[1:31:15] Hallelujah. Yet by a promise he's
[1:31:18] looking at the unseen. Yay, though I
[1:31:21] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:31:23] death. I will fear no evil, for thou art
[1:31:25] with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they
[1:31:28] comfort me. Hallelujah. Even though he
[1:31:30] didn't see him, he had a promise. He had
[1:31:33] a promise that he would not be walking
[1:31:34] alone through the darkest of hours, but
[1:31:36] God would be with him. Right? Now, we've
[1:31:38] heard that story many of times where
[1:31:40] Gahesy's eyes need to become open.
[1:31:42] Right. There he is against I think it
[1:31:45] was Elisha, right? or Elijah. Elisha was
[1:31:48] was there and the 100,000 Syrians
[1:31:51] were coming to kill him.
[1:31:54] Do you think you're not a danger to the
[1:31:56] enemy?
[1:31:58] Sis, you imagine the devil's so mad at
[1:31:59] you, he sends a 100,000 foot soldiers to
[1:32:02] kill you.
[1:32:04] You think, well, I'm just I'm just the
[1:32:05] lowest of the low.
[1:32:08] Well, the devil's pretty concerned about
[1:32:09] it.
[1:32:12] He sent a 100,000 footmen. You imagine
[1:32:15] what that sounded like. You imagine the
[1:32:18] noise that they made, the intimidation
[1:32:20] that that would have had. This the
[1:32:22] stomping and the marching of that iron
[1:32:23] age coming against them. And Elisha's
[1:32:26] not even bothered a bit. Right?
[1:32:29] What is that to me? Ghes saying, "What
[1:32:31] you did you hear them? Did you see them?
[1:32:33] Did you count them? I don't care how
[1:32:34] many there are. I've got an appointment.
[1:32:37] And if God made an appointment, then
[1:32:39] however we're getting out of here, you
[1:32:40] see, God is God and God specializes in
[1:32:42] the impossible." So Elijah didn't worry
[1:32:44] about how big his tax bill was. He said,
[1:32:46] "God is God and I'm going to get out of
[1:32:48] this situation because God promised me I
[1:32:50] could do it. And if God ever gave me a
[1:32:52] promise, then he has a way for it to
[1:32:54] come to pass. Even if he's got to break
[1:32:56] the rules, he's God. He's not bound by
[1:32:59] what we think, hear, smell, taste, feel,
[1:33:01] he's God. He works in another realm. He
[1:33:03] works beyond our understanding. And even
[1:33:06] though we've got him in a little box to
[1:33:07] say there's no way for this to happen,
[1:33:09] God's still God. God still makes ways
[1:33:12] when it seems that there is no way. God
[1:33:13] still turns around situations that seem
[1:33:16] that there's no way for them to come out
[1:33:17] on top. God's still God. Be still and
[1:33:21] know that I am God. And wherever God is,
[1:33:23] the supernatural takes place. Now,
[1:33:26] notice when when when
[1:33:29] he God opened that servant's eyes, first
[1:33:32] he was on the nay side, right? He was on
[1:33:34] the losing side. We're going to die.
[1:33:37] There's no hope for us. We're never
[1:33:39] going to make it out of this. We're
[1:33:40] never going to get out of this
[1:33:41] situation. Revival is never going to
[1:33:42] strike my home. So am I. Revival is
[1:33:45] never going to strike my heart like
[1:33:46] that. I'm just I'm I
[1:33:49] see he was walking in that cycle of
[1:33:52] defeat, right?
[1:33:55] And the prophet just asked the Lord,
[1:33:58] "Lord, would you just open this boy's
[1:34:00] eyes?"
[1:34:04] You see, nothing changed.
[1:34:06] The angels that he saw were there the
[1:34:08] whole time. Those angels of fire had
[1:34:10] always been there on every mountain.
[1:34:12] There was always more of them than there
[1:34:14] was of the enemy. But all it took was
[1:34:16] for his eyes to become open to the
[1:34:18] supernatural to see I am not here alone
[1:34:20] but he has sent representation here with
[1:34:23] me. He sent a force around me an
[1:34:25] innumerable company of angels which
[1:34:27] means there was a 100,000 Syrians but
[1:34:30] there was uncountable angels around
[1:34:32] them. Means you couldn't put a number on
[1:34:33] them. You couldn't count them. You
[1:34:35] couldn't tell who was coming and who was
[1:34:36] going. He said, "I see chariots of fire
[1:34:38] descending and ascending. There's
[1:34:40] there's angels all around us. There's
[1:34:41] angels on every tree." But notice those
[1:34:44] angels never did one thing.
[1:34:48] They didn't come kill the Syrians.
[1:34:50] But the recognization to know that God
[1:34:52] was with them. The recognization to know
[1:34:55] the revelation of the rock to know that
[1:34:57] God is with me in the middle of my
[1:35:00] trial, in the middle of my struggle. He
[1:35:02] has not left me. He has not forsaken me.
[1:35:04] But he is with me, even in me to
[1:35:07] recognize that you can't count the
[1:35:08] angels that have followed you to church
[1:35:10] tonight. You can't count the angels that
[1:35:12] are on your side. You can't number them.
[1:35:14] They are greater than the stars of the
[1:35:16] heaven. And they have come for one
[1:35:18] purpose, and that is to see you through
[1:35:20] to a finished day.
[1:35:22] There's more for us than there is
[1:35:24] against us. There's more for you,
[1:35:26] church, than there is against you. Now,
[1:35:28] you may not feel it. You may not see it.
[1:35:30] You may not hear them. You may just hear
[1:35:31] the march of the enemy's drums coming
[1:35:34] against you. But if we can just open our
[1:35:36] eyes to a supernatural realm to
[1:35:38] recognize that this promise came to me
[1:35:41] in this day to say you will overcome
[1:35:44] them by the blood of the lamb and the
[1:35:46] word of your testimony. You will be an
[1:35:50] overcomer of Leodysia. Amen. And to the
[1:35:53] overcomer of Leodysia, there's one more
[1:35:55] step to take. There's a there's a
[1:35:57] Revelations 4 step to take. All right.
[1:35:59] Your reward.
[1:36:02] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Friends,
[1:36:06] Praise the Lord. I don't know what time
[1:36:07] I started, but
[1:36:12] friends, it doesn't matter what you've
[1:36:14] been through. That's right. It matters
[1:36:16] what he said about you.
[1:36:18] Amen.
[1:36:21] Amen. Ruth had every obstacle stacked up
[1:36:24] against her. There was no way that she
[1:36:26] would ever be a productive believer in
[1:36:28] the house of God. She had everything
[1:36:30] working against her. A gentile, right?
[1:36:35] A widow.
[1:36:39] There's no way that God could use her.
[1:36:41] She had everything working against her.
[1:36:44] Coming back with Naomi, who had left the
[1:36:46] faith,
[1:36:48] right? Coming back with an outsider.
[1:36:52] Let's just turn this into our messes
[1:36:53] culture. Okay.
[1:36:57] Oh, well, praise God. But God will never
[1:36:59] use them. You see, he might be the She
[1:37:02] might be the one that God's been waiting
[1:37:04] for.
[1:37:06] There was a lot of women throwing
[1:37:08] themselves at Boaz. But he was waiting
[1:37:10] for the right one. He was waiting for
[1:37:12] the right one to come into his view. And
[1:37:14] when Ruth came into his kingdom, she
[1:37:16] immediately caught his eye.
[1:37:19] Oh my. What is this?
[1:37:22] Right. Who is this apple of my eye?
[1:37:27] It's the greatest love story ever told,
[1:37:29] friends.
[1:37:32] Amen.
[1:37:34] And Ruth, I could just see her. There's
[1:37:35] no way. I'm just I'm just ugly old Ruth.
[1:37:39] I don't even know what I'm doing here.
[1:37:42] And there the redeemer's telling telling
[1:37:44] her, "You're beautiful.
[1:37:47] I love you. You're the one I've been
[1:37:49] waiting for." No, it can't be me. I'm
[1:37:52] not the one. I just couldn't be the one.
[1:37:53] I couldn't I couldn't do it. I couldn't
[1:37:55] fulfill that. I've done too much. He
[1:37:59] doesn't know my past.
[1:38:02] He doesn't know what the mistakes I've
[1:38:04] made. He doesn't know the things I've
[1:38:05] thought. He doesn't know the times I've
[1:38:07] spoken against him.
[1:38:11] It didn't matter to Boaz. That's right.
[1:38:14] Who is this damsel?
[1:38:16] Where's she come from? Oh, that's
[1:38:19] Moabitis.
[1:38:21] You see, Boaz knew how powerful
[1:38:24] his his redemption was.
[1:38:28] So good. They thought, "Well, she's a
[1:38:30] Moabitis. He'll have to leave her in the
[1:38:31] field. He'll he'll just forget about
[1:38:32] her." No. He knew how powerful he was.
[1:38:36] He knew he had the authority in the land
[1:38:37] that whoever I say will come into my
[1:38:40] house. It doesn't matter what you think
[1:38:41] or what you think or what you think or
[1:38:43] what you think. Whoever I have elected
[1:38:45] to come into my house is already been
[1:38:47] chosen. And it doesn't matter what the
[1:38:49] world says. I've already chosen them. It
[1:38:51] doesn't matter what their brother says.
[1:38:53] I've already chosen them. Hallelujah.
[1:38:57] But she had to nail me to coach her on
[1:38:59] what to do. Amen. He's chosen you. No.
[1:39:02] Yes.
[1:39:05] Yes. You, church.
[1:39:08] This is what you do to gain his favor.
[1:39:11] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:39:14] I could just take off and preach for
[1:39:15] another hour.
[1:39:17] There she is working in the field.
[1:39:20] And her redeemer comes her way.
[1:39:23] Yeah, I know it's been hard. I know 2025
[1:39:26] has been hard.
[1:39:29] Reapers,
[1:39:31] angels,
[1:39:33] leave a double handful on purpose.
[1:39:39] Leave a double handful of purpose in
[1:39:41] their midst. make it a little easier on
[1:39:43] them that they could glean without
[1:39:44] working so hard. That they could glean
[1:39:47] without laboring so hard. You see, she's
[1:39:48] labored all day out here in the sun.
[1:39:50] She's been laboring since she's been
[1:39:52] here. Why don't you drop She's She's the
[1:39:54] one that's caught my eye. Why don't you
[1:39:55] drop a double portion on her? Why don't
[1:39:57] you drop a double handful of purpose on
[1:39:59] her tonight that she could know that I'm
[1:40:02] her redeemer and she has caught my eye.
[1:40:04] Why don't you drop a double portion of
[1:40:06] the Holy Ghost in this meeting tonight
[1:40:08] where we don't have to go through the
[1:40:09] same trial that we did today, but we
[1:40:11] would have an assurance to know that we
[1:40:13] have caught his eye tonight. We are the
[1:40:16] bride of Christ. We're not trying to be.
[1:40:18] We already have become. He's already
[1:40:20] elected you to be the overcomer. He's
[1:40:23] already elected you to be the bride.
[1:40:25] He's already asked you, "Will you?" You
[1:40:27] just got to say, "I do." and walk into
[1:40:29] the fulfillment of the promise. It's
[1:40:31] already you tonight, church. He's not
[1:40:33] waiting on anyone else. He's powerful
[1:40:36] enough to redeem you where you are. He's
[1:40:39] powerful enough to put his covering over
[1:40:41] you where you are.
[1:40:46] Ruth working.
[1:40:50] We've been working. Ruth's been working.
[1:40:53] Four phases.
[1:40:58] Ruth resting
[1:41:00] in the promise of the Holy Ghost. All
[1:41:02] right. To know that this is a finished
[1:41:04] work. His word is true. He has elected
[1:41:06] me. He has he has chosen me from before
[1:41:08] the foundation of the earth to be in
[1:41:10] this position. I cannot be lost any more
[1:41:13] than God can be lost. That's resting in
[1:41:16] the promise of his word. We're not cast
[1:41:18] on every side by this rumor of war or
[1:41:20] what might happen in this situation or
[1:41:22] what might happen to our wroth or our
[1:41:23] 401k. We're not worried on every side,
[1:41:26] but we've been given a commission in
[1:41:27] this hour to rest in the field, abide in
[1:41:30] the field until he returns. And there
[1:41:32] she abodeed in that field and long about
[1:41:34] the evening time when Boaz laid down for
[1:41:37] the night. You see, she had been given
[1:41:38] instruction by an instructor before her
[1:41:41] who knew what the redeemer liked. And he
[1:41:43] said, "When the evening time comes, you
[1:41:45] get underneath the covering. You lay at
[1:41:47] his feet, church. You lay at his feet.
[1:41:50] And if he really has elected you, he'll
[1:41:52] cover you with this blanket." and all
[1:41:54] your past is erased. Everything that
[1:41:57] you've ever done is gone. You no longer
[1:41:59] are a Moabitis, but you are Boaz's wife.
[1:42:02] You are the kinsman redeemer's spouse.
[1:42:05] You are the one that he has redeemed
[1:42:07] because you abided in the field. He has
[1:42:10] covered you with his blessing. He has
[1:42:12] covered you with his anointing. He has
[1:42:14] covered you with his blood. He has
[1:42:16] covered you with every promise that he's
[1:42:18] given to the church. Hide me.
[1:42:22] Hide me in your pavilion, Lord. Hide me
[1:42:24] under your blanket, for I'm unworthy,
[1:42:26] but under this blanket, I'm a new
[1:42:28] creation. I'm a brand new man. All
[1:42:31] things are washed away.
[1:42:34] And the devil can't find you under
[1:42:36] there.
[1:42:38] You are hidden under the blanket of
[1:42:40] Christ's redemption. The devil cannot
[1:42:42] find you there. Hallelujah.
[1:42:50] Resting in the field, abiding in the
[1:42:51] field of his grace. You're not here by
[1:42:54] your works or your merits. It was never
[1:42:55] about about how good you could be or how
[1:42:57] good of a Christian you could be. It's
[1:42:59] about his sovereign grace to an age to
[1:43:02] say, "I know that you couldn't do it,
[1:43:03] but I've made a way anyway. I know that
[1:43:06] you couldn't fulfill it, but I've caused
[1:43:08] I've caused the cosmos to set in order
[1:43:12] to clear a path for you to walk into
[1:43:14] every promise that's yours." Hallelujah.
[1:43:18] An abiding Ruth in the field will rest
[1:43:21] in his word, but the last commission to
[1:43:23] her is her reward.
[1:43:28] Ruth's reward.
[1:43:31] Ruth's finishing moment. She wasn't
[1:43:34] rejected.
[1:43:35] She was made the queen of the house.
[1:43:39] Hallelujah.
[1:43:41] Hallelujah.
[1:43:43] He says, Ruth, I got it wrote here. Ruth
[1:43:46] deciding to make her decision.
[1:43:49] Ruth serving.
[1:43:51] Ruth resting.
[1:43:53] Ruth rewarded.
[1:43:55] Ruth decided.
[1:43:58] Ruth served.
[1:44:00] Ruth rested.
[1:44:02] And then Ruth was rewarded.
[1:44:08] Some pretty pretty simple steps,
[1:44:11] friends. That's right. You've decided to
[1:44:13] follow Jesus. Amen. You first got to
[1:44:16] decide I'm his bride.
[1:44:19] I'm going to walk in the fullness of the
[1:44:21] word. I'm going to serve him with
[1:44:23] everything I've got. I'm going to give
[1:44:24] him everything. I'm not going to hold
[1:44:25] anything back. I'm going to serve him
[1:44:27] all my days. Let every breath go to
[1:44:29] serving the Lord. And then I'm going to
[1:44:31] rest in the promise that he is a
[1:44:32] faithful God. And if he said he would
[1:44:34] hide me away, then he'll hide me away.
[1:44:36] If he'll cover me, then he'll cover me.
[1:44:38] If he'll he'll hide me in his pavilion,
[1:44:40] then that's where I rest in. That's my
[1:44:41] rest. That's my hope. I'm not worried
[1:44:43] about what comes tomorrow.
[1:44:46] Hallelujah. And then you get your
[1:44:49] reward.
[1:44:51] Hallelujah.
[1:44:52] The music players would come. Did you
[1:44:55] ever walk out of the morning, he says,
[1:44:57] in that real fresh, cool feeling. Every
[1:44:59] man that comes to the pulpit ought to
[1:45:01] dwell alone first. Then comes the
[1:45:02] fruits, yielding forth his fruits. And
[1:45:04] every man that stays in the presence of
[1:45:05] God into this great secret place hid
[1:45:08] away will yield the fruits of
[1:45:10] righteousness, peace, love, joy,
[1:45:11] longsuffering, goodness, gentleness, and
[1:45:13] patience. Don't fuss about these other
[1:45:15] things. Get that in your life. And
[1:45:19] you'll never you'll never get it until
[1:45:21] you hide away with God into that land of
[1:45:25] adoption.
[1:45:29] Oh, church, aren't you glad that you're
[1:45:30] hidden tonight? Amen. Amen.
[1:45:34] Hit away from yesterday's mistakes.
[1:45:41] Hit away from tomorrow's
[1:45:43] uncertainties.
[1:45:47] Hid away from your present trials.
[1:45:51] You're hid away, friends.
[1:45:54] The Alpha and the Omega has covered you
[1:45:57] with his wing.
[1:46:00] He knows the beginning from the end.
[1:46:02] Yes, he does. And he's right here in the
[1:46:03] middle of our situation tonight.
[1:46:05] Friends, I believe he's worthy of a
[1:46:08] praise tonight. I believe he's worthy of
[1:46:10] thankfulness tonight. Know that there
[1:46:13] was no way I could do it. I didn't have
[1:46:15] the strength. I didn't have the ability.
[1:46:16] I didn't have the smarts. You did not do
[1:46:19] anything to receive this message of the
[1:46:20] hour, but it came to you. Whether it
[1:46:22] came through a so- and so or a so- and
[1:46:24] so, it came to you anyhow because God
[1:46:27] had this set up before the foundation of
[1:46:29] the world that you would come in contact
[1:46:31] with him, this reality of the living
[1:46:34] word, and you would never be the same
[1:46:36] because there was a seed ready to be
[1:46:39] activated inside of you.
[1:46:43] [Applause]
[1:46:45] Hallelujah.
[1:46:47] I'm ready to be an activated seed
[1:46:48] tonight.
[1:46:51] I know who I am. I know why I'm here.
[1:46:54] And I know the end of the story. I know
[1:46:57] how this thing finishes. I know that we
[1:47:00] win. We'll be gathered around the
[1:47:02] wedding supper table there. You see, the
[1:47:04] marriage has already taken place. I've
[1:47:06] already said I do. I'm already his
[1:47:08] bride. But we're on our way to the
[1:47:10] celebration. And what a celebration
[1:47:12] that'll be when we gather around the
[1:47:14] throne with those that have gone on
[1:47:16] before us and we're all the same age and
[1:47:18] we're all the same stature and we all
[1:47:21] have the same revelation and there's no
[1:47:23] fussing, there's no fighting, there's no
[1:47:24] biting. It's all just love, love, love,
[1:47:27] love. I believe that it's a real place
[1:47:30] and I believe we're on our way tonight,
[1:47:31] friends. I believe it's just a moment
[1:47:34] away, just another step, and we'll be
[1:47:36] walking into that perfect peace tonight.
[1:47:39] See what's on your heart. Hallelujah.
[1:47:42] Hallelujah.
[1:47:45] Hallelujah.
[1:47:47] Yes, Lord. Thank you, my Lord.
[1:47:51] Hallelujah. Spirit and the bride are
[1:47:55] saying come. Yes, Lord.
[1:48:00] the elect to be in stirred inside their
[1:48:05] hearts.
[1:48:08] Our uniting time has come.
[1:48:13] We and the father
[1:48:16] are one.
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:20] Soon we'll be with our Lord forever
[1:48:25] more.

[1:48:34] making preparations
