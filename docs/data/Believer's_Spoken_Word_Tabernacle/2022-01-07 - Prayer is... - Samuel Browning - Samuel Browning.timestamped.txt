[37:39] amen and amen
[37:42] amen
[37:43] i want to just read
[37:45] the text here
[37:47] this evening out of luke chapter 11
[37:50] in verse 1.
[37:52] i want to just
[37:54] perhaps mention a few things while i
[37:56] have you standing just for a minute and
[37:57] just
[37:58] just kind of some housekeeping things
[38:01] that we have to
[38:02] kind of do or visit even in this time we
[38:05] we we know that even in the area that
[38:07] we're living in uh there's been
[38:10] it's quite a
[38:11] quite a surge that's taking place
[38:14] um even right now and you know these
[38:16] things they eventually they spike and
[38:19] then it goes down
[38:20] but we just just want to
[38:22] just admonish you and ask you which
[38:25] you've done a wonderful job as an
[38:27] assembly i've had different ones have
[38:29] sent me text or you've called if you've
[38:31] had a question
[38:32] about coming if you didn't feel well or
[38:35] you were in contact with someone and we
[38:38] certainly appreciate all of that because
[38:40] we we want to be mindful
[38:43] of one another and so i just want to you
[38:45] know ask you because i've had to ask um
[38:48] even of different ones you know hey we
[38:50] need to get a test and so forth because
[38:53] it's it's a benefit for you as well as
[38:55] anybody else to know these things and
[38:57] these are just some of the protocols we
[38:59] have to go through
[39:00] and i can tell you for my own self as i
[39:02] stand here we've already had to do it at
[39:05] different times already through this
[39:07] year in order for me to stand here and
[39:09] minister not because i had i had
[39:12] something a symptom here or there but
[39:14] even with um our boys at times and so
[39:17] we'd we work to try to get a rapid test
[39:20] and i know right now
[39:22] it's the it's the hardest thing in the
[39:23] world to try to get a test
[39:26] uh you try to get the tests and things i
[39:28] remember back during december it was
[39:30] booked clear into i think the first
[39:32] parts of january who knows where they're
[39:34] at now
[39:34] and uh i know even with trying to find
[39:37] uh one of those little
[39:39] test kits or whatever they put out
[39:41] and
[39:42] it's just it's it's it's kind of a it's
[39:45] a place where we we're at and it's uh
[39:47] something we don't want to look at like
[39:49] a hardship
[39:51] i want to look at it in a manner and say
[39:53] lord just help me you just direct me you
[39:55] know one of the things we're looking at
[39:57] last week when daniel daniel was
[39:59] unaltered he prayed he did everything he
[40:02] did from before and there's things we
[40:04] can do we can we can stand on the word
[40:06] of god but we also remember standing on
[40:08] the word of god is also having patience
[40:10] in all things
[40:11] sometimes our patients can we're kind of
[40:13] thin and we can get frustrated and
[40:15] sometimes ah
[40:16] i'm just gonna but we want to go through
[40:18] everything in in the right way and we
[40:21] have been i want to commend you for that
[40:24] and i just say it like this if you're
[40:26] you know if you're sick or you're
[40:27] sniffles or whatever more or you're not
[40:29] feeling well and you've got a question
[40:31] about it please call brother gomez or
[40:33] brother richard because if chances are
[40:35] if you call me at some time and at any
[40:37] time and you don't get my phone right
[40:39] away that's because i'm probably i'm in
[40:41] the middle of even praying or i'm in the
[40:42] middle of a thought and sometimes i
[40:44] don't even break out of those channels
[40:46] even for my family they know i'm in a
[40:48] channel and just i'm going moving in
[40:50] that channel so it would be very very
[40:52] good just to call brother richard or
[40:53] brother gomez and uh you know if you've
[40:56] got questions about something but if
[40:57] you're sick just just be cautious about
[41:00] it
[41:01] whether you or someone in your family
[41:03] like i said i've stood here at times
[41:05] when i've had to make sure i had we had
[41:07] a test done so i know that one of the
[41:08] boys didn't have something before i came
[41:10] and stood here
[41:11] and ministered and
[41:13] if you have any questions it's just like
[41:15] the things i know i say follow the cdc
[41:18] protocol and you think which one
[41:21] you know
[41:22] it's you know it changes changes changes
[41:25] changes everything is changes but
[41:27] there's some things that's very clear
[41:28] even right now within the five to seven
[41:30] days and you know and just to say it
[41:33] it's it's very
[41:34] um very clear that's out there if you
[41:36] have questions without be laboring it's
[41:39] very simple if you you know if you're
[41:40] sick or you know or someone's in your
[41:42] family just
[41:44] um
[41:45] err on the side of caution you can call
[41:47] us you can talk to us and that's been
[41:49] done i know that i commend you as
[41:52] even those who are not here tonight
[41:54] that's been done
[41:55] uh to where you've done that very very
[41:57] well and i just want to encourage you
[41:59] even
[42:00] throughout
[42:02] this time
[42:03] so
[42:04] let's look here in the word
[42:08] and if i forgot something i'll pick it
[42:10] up lord willing on sunday
[42:13] but here on luke chapter 11 verse 1
[42:17] and it came to pass that as he was
[42:19] praying
[42:20] in a certain place when he ceased
[42:24] one of his disciples said unto him
[42:28] lord teach us to pray
[42:30] as john taught his disciples
[42:34] and he said unto them when you pray
[42:37] say our father which art in heaven
[42:40] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[42:45] thy will be done as in heaven
[42:48] so in earth
[42:49] give us day by day
[42:52] our daily bread
[42:53] and forgive us our sins for we also
[42:56] forgive everyone that is indebted to us
[42:59] lead us not into temptation but deliver
[43:01] us
[43:02] from evil
[43:04] amen may god bless the reading of the
[43:06] word as you're being seated
[43:09] i'd like to read a quote here out of
[43:12] birth pains i don't know if they have
[43:13] those things up okay so we don't have
[43:15] them you just have to listen to me then
[43:19] but i want to say i just appreciate
[43:21] brother alexander being here and
[43:23] ministering in the word of the lord of
[43:25] what god has spoken and
[43:27] you know i my wife told me she
[43:30] had received the link from down there we
[43:32] were at brother reyes and she said oh my
[43:34] goodness she said you read the same text
[43:36] that was that was read here and i
[43:39] i think was just a little bit of a
[43:40] different angle and some things and
[43:42] um but i just in it all we we thank god
[43:46] for his mercy and i really appreciate
[43:48] your prayers it's just always a
[43:49] wonderful time to get down there with um
[43:52] to be there with brother ray and the
[43:54] saints i always told them i said it's
[43:55] kind of like a second home
[43:57] i just always enjoy enjoy going there
[44:00] and being with being with those brothers
[44:02] and sisters there
[44:03] so much and the message birth pains and
[44:06] i want to just take a title here tonight
[44:09] and just some things just really
[44:11] um burning on my heart just some
[44:13] inspiration just from some messages and
[44:16] things i've been just going through and
[44:18] listening
[44:19] without even this intent but certain
[44:21] things just begin to drop at a certain
[44:23] time
[44:24] and i'd just like to speak on two little
[44:26] words prayer is
[44:28] prayer is
[44:31] in the message birth pains brother bram
[44:33] says you know we could sing too much we
[44:36] could shout too much till we got hoarse
[44:38] we could sing at the wrong time or shout
[44:40] at the wrong time but here's one thing
[44:42] we're never out of order when we're
[44:45] praying
[44:46] and we realized brother brown how many
[44:48] times when he would even come to the
[44:49] platform and he would speak to the
[44:51] people and give direction he said now
[44:53] even while the word is going forth you
[44:56] be in a spirit of prayer
[44:58] so it's moving into that place even as
[45:00] the word is going forth you're entering
[45:02] in it with a spirit of prayer the lord
[45:04] passed by my way lord speak to my heart
[45:06] lord direct the man of god and he quotes
[45:09] the scripture out of timothy i would
[45:11] that men pray everywhere lifting up holy
[45:13] hands without doubt
[45:15] father it is the greatest privilege that
[45:18] a mortal ever had was to close his eyes
[45:22] and open his heart and speak to you
[45:25] we know that you hear if you could just
[45:28] if we could just believe that you hear
[45:31] for jesus said if you ask the father
[45:33] anything in my name
[45:35] it'll be granted that was on conditions
[45:38] if we wouldn't
[45:40] doubt it
[45:41] and we understand there's all sorts of
[45:43] things that can try to come at us to
[45:45] doubt and there's sometimes where we
[45:48] don't in ourselves
[45:50] feel like as though our prayer is going
[45:53] anywhere
[45:54] but if i can get to it to certain places
[45:56] here tonight
[45:57] its faith itself is not based upon our
[46:00] feelings
[46:02] prayer being heard and prayer being
[46:04] answered has nothing to do with our
[46:06] feelings
[46:07] it has everything to do with our faith
[46:10] and this is where that when our heart
[46:13] and our life is lined up and just just
[46:16] settled with the lord then we can have a
[46:18] confidence that when we're praying that
[46:20] that prayer is going up and there's
[46:22] nothing can stand
[46:24] in the way of that prayer from being
[46:26] answered and being heard
[46:28] so i just want to take just a few a
[46:30] little a few things here on what prayer
[46:33] is and just say it in this way there's
[46:36] probably not a religion that and i and i
[46:38] say religion that is out there where
[46:41] there's not some form of prayer in it
[46:45] or where they do some sort of prayer or
[46:47] chants or something but to understand
[46:50] that prayer
[46:51] it's not a ritual i never forget when my
[46:54] uncle ronald he was there and we were he
[46:56] was marrying
[46:58] one of my cousins and he was standing
[47:00] there you know and here uh you had
[47:02] another
[47:04] man in that particular
[47:06] church where the cousin was getting
[47:08] married and you know he was all robed
[47:10] out and he had everything you know and
[47:12] they were practicing for the wedding and
[47:14] he looked over at my uncle and he said
[47:17] he said where's your prayer book at he
[47:19] said
[47:20] where are you going to pray and he said
[47:21] i don't have a prayer book
[47:23] and um my uncle ronald you know he said
[47:26] well you don't have a prayer book he
[47:27] said no he said well how do you pray so
[47:28] i just pray from my heart
[47:31] i just talked to him from my heart
[47:33] and that's prayer is is something
[47:36] it's very real it's not a ritual it's
[47:38] not even anything that
[47:40] should that we should even make a ritual
[47:44] or make a tradition this is why the
[47:46] scriptures would admonish admonish us to
[47:49] being instant in prayer to praying
[47:52] always because prayer is is a worship
[47:55] prayer is an atmosphere prayer is a
[47:57] place that we are able to live in it's
[48:00] not a ritual it's not something that
[48:02] well i have to do this
[48:04] prayer is a worship it's a time of deep
[48:08] sincerity and consecration in the
[48:11] presence of the lord
[48:13] i can i can say this as we go through it
[48:16] that there no matter what the situation
[48:18] is within a life no matter what you are
[48:22] feeling within your life
[48:24] hurt heartache disappointment
[48:26] discouragement whatever the feeling
[48:29] might be you can you can put it all
[48:31] together but there is nothing that can
[48:34] really minister to you and i when we
[48:37] come through those points in our life as
[48:40] prayer can
[48:41] and prayer meaning that it's just as you
[48:43] and i we would talk to one another and
[48:45] you know there's times when we talk to
[48:47] one another and maybe sometimes with my
[48:49] wife or she can say honey what's wrong
[48:51] and i oh i'm nothing she knows me enough
[48:54] by now that maybe there's something on
[48:56] my mind or something's wrong and you see
[48:59] if we can just in that moment with god
[49:02] god already knows what's on our heart
[49:06] and you're not in defeat when you say
[49:08] lord i'm hurting you're not in defeat
[49:10] you're there before the very one who's
[49:13] able to minister the remedy that you and
[49:17] i have need of for hurt there's not a
[49:19] prescription you can take for hurt
[49:21] there's prescriptions that will drown
[49:23] you or try to drown that hurt out but
[49:26] there is not a prescription that a
[49:29] mortal can take that will release hurt
[49:31] you can have stitches put in a in a
[49:34] wound here on your arm hand wherever you
[49:37] can even have that of a bone that is
[49:39] broken you can have that set but there
[49:42] is none that can heal the spirit a wound
[49:45] or a herd like the lord jesus can
[49:49] he knows what it is to be wounded he he
[49:52] took all of that for the chastisement of
[49:55] our peace and we can go to him in
[49:57] honesty you might say well i'm afraid
[49:59] the enemy will hear me you've got a
[50:01] channel that's open between you and god
[50:05] when you go to god in prayer you can be
[50:08] open and honest before god and invite
[50:11] him in to minister to your need
[50:14] god doesn't want us and he does he
[50:16] doesn't want us coming before him and
[50:18] pretending you know uh
[50:20] many things that we could talk about
[50:22] with hurt and you know we could start
[50:24] quoting things and quoting scripture but
[50:26] you know we just save our time if we
[50:28] just cut to the chase and say lord i'm
[50:31] hurting or lord this situation here this
[50:34] has been said or this has taken place or
[50:36] this is going on the job you know we
[50:39] know all of the we know the scriptures
[50:41] we know the quotes but prayer that
[50:43] doesn't nullify that prayer is the
[50:46] avenue to come in contact with god and i
[50:49] can tell you i know there's witnesses
[50:51] out here as well i'm a witness there
[50:53] comes a release in your life to be able
[50:56] to handle those things
[50:59] you could tell me you could tell anybody
[51:01] else but it'll never release it but when
[51:04] you get in prayer with god god's the one
[51:06] he'll release it many times when i can
[51:09] stand and talk with others and speak to
[51:11] them and point them into those places
[51:13] even in that time there's a relief
[51:16] that'll come but how can courage get on
[51:18] into prayer and you'll find as you put
[51:20] your heart out before god god will come
[51:23] on the scene prayer is a place of
[51:25] openness
[51:27] prayer is not a place to be closed off
[51:29] there's times where you don't want to
[51:31] know and let the right hand know what
[51:32] the left hand is doing even in the body
[51:35] is that right yet the bible would say
[51:37] confess our faults one to another it's
[51:39] having wisdom so there should be that of
[51:41] a love of god god will place
[51:43] relationships in the body so that you
[51:46] and i might have those that we can go to
[51:49] and pray and we will pray for one
[51:51] another yet there's times where within
[51:54] we don't let the left know what the
[51:55] right is doing we just go before god in
[51:57] prayer
[51:59] that's a channel that's given to you and
[52:01] i
[52:02] in prayer
[52:03] here in matthew chapter 6 verse 5
[52:06] when thou prayest now notice how jesus
[52:09] has
[52:11] expressed this when thou prayest thou
[52:14] shall not be as the hypocrites are
[52:17] for they love to pray standing in the
[52:19] synagogues and in the corners of the
[52:21] streets that they may be seen of men
[52:24] verily i say unto you they have their
[52:25] reward well what would their reward be
[52:28] wow man they can really pray
[52:31] they're really people of prayer
[52:34] but that doesn't mean they're people of
[52:36] prayer
[52:37] jesus remember he spoke to the pharisees
[52:40] the same ones he's speaking of now
[52:41] calling them hypocrites they would go
[52:43] into a widow's house and they would make
[52:46] a long prayer
[52:49] it was all about
[52:51] attention for themselves prayer
[52:54] is not about me
[52:57] prayer is not about you sometimes we
[53:00] start out with our needs we start out
[53:02] with these different things but prayer
[53:05] is really not about me prayer is about
[53:09] you and i coming into that contact with
[53:12] god and god releasing to you and i the
[53:15] strength that we have need of sometimes
[53:17] the answer doesn't come right away
[53:20] sometimes the situation doesn't dissolve
[53:23] but this is where the bible says that we
[53:25] receive
[53:26] strength paul writes of this in first
[53:29] corinthians 10
[53:31] in psalms 86 it speaks of it we go from
[53:33] strength unto strength
[53:35] it's strength that we receive from god
[53:37] now notice but when thou prayest
[53:41] enter into thy closet
[53:44] and when thou has shut the door pray to
[53:46] the father which is in secret and thy
[53:48] father which seeth in secret shall
[53:52] reward thee
[53:54] openly
[53:55] so remember within these scriptures i'm
[53:58] reading you remember within the three
[54:00] polls of brother adam's ministry
[54:03] we have the first poll you know the
[54:05] taking of the hand and here what would
[54:08] take place upon the hand would speak
[54:10] brother branham was instructed by the
[54:12] angel how to read that of what was
[54:14] taking place the disease that was going
[54:15] on in the body
[54:17] then it came there the discerning of the
[54:20] thoughts and intents of the heart is
[54:22] that right
[54:23] then the third phase of that would be
[54:26] the very opening of the word come into
[54:29] that place of a union to where christ
[54:33] and his bride would come together in a
[54:36] full union where the bride walks under
[54:39] the headship of the word of god
[54:42] when we're brought into that place of
[54:44] supreme and complete victory
[54:47] where we're walking in that place that
[54:49] as brother branham would see that in the
[54:51] vision and he wasn't understanding what
[54:54] was taking place but remember he would
[54:56] see this great gathering of people then
[54:58] he would say well there's going to be a
[55:00] prayer line and you know the prayer line
[55:02] how long it was and then his attention
[55:04] would be directed to this little room a
[55:08] little place that was there and remember
[55:10] brother branham was noticing within this
[55:12] as it was directed there how that there
[55:15] were people coming into that little
[55:17] prayer room on cots some on crutches and
[55:20] as they came into that place they passed
[55:23] through there and on the other side they
[55:26] were no longer on crutches they were no
[55:28] longer on a cop and there was a person
[55:31] asking them standing there with a
[55:33] notepad and asking them what happened
[55:36] what happened in there and this was
[55:38] their testimony
[55:40] i don't know what happened
[55:42] but they knew something happened
[55:45] see that's a reality of a word
[55:48] experience
[55:49] that you know something has happened in
[55:53] your life
[55:55] it's a word of god that is set down and
[55:58] it has changed us it's not some location
[56:00] out here that we have to go to it's the
[56:03] living christ that is among us
[56:08] the living god that is right here among
[56:10] us that when we can go to him in prayer
[56:13] then we find such a release i never
[56:15] forget that
[56:17] here you know and individuals were
[56:19] sitting here tonight and years ago i
[56:21] think maybe back in 2005 or four or
[56:25] three i don't know and i was preaching
[56:27] on those on the different within that of
[56:29] the little room and i'm just speaking on
[56:31] that in a sunday morning service and
[56:34] after the service was over here a
[56:37] brother got down and began to pray and
[56:39] the things that he was getting ready to
[56:41] pray about he was getting ready to pray
[56:43] about certain things god remove this
[56:47] lord dissolve this instead what began to
[56:50] come out of his mouth was we begin to
[56:53] thank god for the deliverance
[56:56] because it was already gone why we are
[56:59] right here in the presence of almighty
[57:02] god
[57:03] this is the presence of the living god
[57:06] it's me it's coming into his presence
[57:08] let me tell you something he's close
[57:10] he's right where you're at he comes
[57:13] right there to your heart all you have
[57:15] to do is enter in when you sense that
[57:18] how the spirit of god is moving in your
[57:20] life that's the water being troubled
[57:22] that's the time to move into it whatever
[57:26] he says to you move right into that at
[57:28] that moment in time let it be
[57:31] spontaneous as it comes to you
[57:33] move with that pulsation
[57:35] so i i want to say with this and i i
[57:38] trust that i didn't move too far off on
[57:40] that but when thou prayest notice he's
[57:43] telling he's instructing that to enter
[57:46] in to that secret place
[57:49] that doesn't necessarily mean that you
[57:51] have to go into a closet in your house
[57:54] what it means is it's a place because
[57:55] you'll find in the scriptures that even
[57:58] as they would resort to prayer by
[57:59] riverside
[58:01] is that right the bible tells us that in
[58:03] the book of acts prayer is a place where
[58:05] you and i can get alone solitude with
[58:08] god brother branham as you know i would
[58:10] hear
[58:11] different testimonies when i was in
[58:13] jeffersonville this past year i can hear
[58:15] these things on tape as well but
[58:17] sometimes you have certain insights that
[58:19] are given to you how sometimes brother
[58:20] branham himself he would just get out
[58:23] and drive
[58:24] just to talk to the lord
[58:26] just to get away just to break away
[58:28] sometimes you understand we know how it
[58:30] is sometimes it's just the monotony of
[58:33] the situation but there is something
[58:35] that propels our heart we want to speak
[58:39] to almighty god
[58:43] oh my now notice this
[58:46] he said when you pray
[58:49] in verse 7 and but when you pray notice
[58:52] he's not saying say a prayer but he says
[58:54] when you pray
[58:57] praying is just like if you and i sat
[58:59] down
[59:00] at a table for coffee
[59:02] or we sat down to talk or we're in the
[59:05] living room or wherever we're at we sit
[59:06] down and we talk
[59:09] i mean you don't want me approaching you
[59:10] with a bunch of puffed up language
[59:13] thou paul
[59:15] i love us though
[59:18] god doesn't interested in all the you
[59:20] don't have to have king james english to
[59:22] press god
[59:23] as a matter of fact you may not even
[59:25] know the words but you can send up the
[59:26] abcs
[59:29] like the little boy who just simply said
[59:31] to abc's he had confidence that god knew
[59:34] what he had need of and god would put
[59:36] the words together god's not interested
[59:38] in that you and i both i hope you do you
[59:41] appreciate people that are just real and
[59:44] genuine
[59:45] people that you can just simply be
[59:46] yourself around
[59:49] is that right you just you want to be
[59:51] there and that's what god wants he wants
[59:53] out of you and i he wants us to be
[59:56] ourself
[59:57] to let it all to let it down because if
[1:00:00] there's something in our life that's not
[1:00:02] right he's the one that can help us he's
[1:00:05] not the one we should be running from we
[1:00:07] ought to be running to him
[1:00:10] whatever that we have need of he's asked
[1:00:13] you and i over and over and over his
[1:00:16] word ask me
[1:00:18] ask me
[1:00:19] ask me
[1:00:21] oh my don't use vain repetition
[1:00:24] repetitions as the heathen do for they
[1:00:26] think they shall be heard for their much
[1:00:29] speaking
[1:00:31] but be you not therefore like unto them
[1:00:33] for your father knoweth the things you
[1:00:34] have needed before
[1:00:36] you ask him
[1:00:38] just just drawing out of this message i
[1:00:40] want to read this out of the message
[1:00:43] the supernatural
[1:00:46] and i just just just just listening just
[1:00:50] meditating on some of these things
[1:00:52] and brother brahma is talking about the
[1:00:54] hidden life and the life
[1:00:56] behind the veil and how god's made a way
[1:00:59] for us to come behind that veil
[1:01:01] he comes into that place of prayer
[1:01:04] he said prayer is not a perhaps
[1:01:07] prayer is a sincere thing
[1:01:11] prayer
[1:01:12] is talking
[1:01:13] to god
[1:01:16] prayer is not get down
[1:01:18] shut your eyes
[1:01:19] thinking about your washing or your work
[1:01:21] you're
[1:01:22] doing and we didn't understand brother
[1:01:24] simon i don't try i know neither do i it
[1:01:26] just comes
[1:01:28] we have to move beyond it right
[1:01:31] maybe it's thinking about a job that
[1:01:33] you're going to do and how do i do this
[1:01:35] to this and you're you know you've just
[1:01:36] been thinking about it but all of a
[1:01:38] sudden here you're in prayer and you
[1:01:39] find yourself thinking about don't get
[1:01:40] defeated just say lord help me to move
[1:01:43] beyond this barrier lord
[1:01:45] because me focusing on it never got it
[1:01:47] done before but i know that lord that
[1:01:50] all that i have need of including that
[1:01:52] issue i can find that answer in you lord
[1:01:57] prayer is a sincere thing it's talking
[1:01:59] to god it's not get down shut your eyes
[1:02:01] thinking about your washing or your work
[1:02:02] you're doing and say lord help me and
[1:02:04] john and he'll miss jones and so forth
[1:02:07] that's not
[1:02:09] prayer
[1:02:10] that's repeating some words
[1:02:13] but prayer is to come into an atmosphere
[1:02:16] where you realize that you're in the
[1:02:18] presence of god and you're moving to to
[1:02:21] then in the deepest sincerity now watch
[1:02:24] this approach
[1:02:26] first
[1:02:27] it's a worship
[1:02:29] o jehovah how i love you
[1:02:32] that's first notice teach us how to pray
[1:02:35] this is how he says when you pray say
[1:02:38] our
[1:02:38] our father who art in heaven hallowed be
[1:02:42] thy name that's worship
[1:02:45] thy kingdom come thy will be done notice
[1:02:48] i we want your will
[1:02:50] we want the influence of that that
[1:02:52] kingdom that which is in the unseen to
[1:02:56] affect this visible realm
[1:02:58] the unseen to contact the unseen inside
[1:03:01] of me that it might become visible in my
[1:03:03] life see it's placing ourselves prayer
[1:03:07] is placing ourselves under him
[1:03:12] so first it's worship
[1:03:15] because i i could we could ask you to
[1:03:16] raise your hands how many times where we
[1:03:18] go you go into prayer and you don't feel
[1:03:20] like praying
[1:03:23] come on this this this body does this
[1:03:25] the body doesn't say hey let's go pray
[1:03:27] no the body doesn't say the but you get
[1:03:29] down to pray oh have you paid this bill
[1:03:31] ooh have you looked at this oh have you
[1:03:33] noticed this oh have you know that
[1:03:36] it's you see what it is it's satan
[1:03:39] trying to distract it it's not that
[1:03:41] you're evil
[1:03:43] so just either lying it's not that there
[1:03:45] are receptors that are still in this
[1:03:48] flesh in that carnal part about you and
[1:03:51] i this is why we have to bring it to the
[1:03:54] lord in prayer and even when you go to
[1:03:56] god in prayer at times when you don't
[1:03:58] feel like it you feel like my i just you
[1:04:01] know i feel like i failed today or i
[1:04:02] feel like hey hey you can't even
[1:04:04] approach god in that way just be honest
[1:04:07] and say lord today you know what i
[1:04:09] really don't feel so great
[1:04:12] but lord i want to come and enter into
[1:04:14] your presence
[1:04:16] because lord you're a sanctifier you're
[1:04:18] a cleanser i want to talk to you lord
[1:04:21] yes
[1:04:24] oh my just be real
[1:04:27] prayer
[1:04:29] prayer is how and that worship and
[1:04:31] you'll find yourself just beginning to
[1:04:33] worship and you know sometimes the
[1:04:35] reason that we don't enter in and think
[1:04:37] of all of everything that goes on in
[1:04:39] life sometimes it's just like with
[1:04:41] prayer we're trying to fit prayer in
[1:04:43] just like we try to fit dinner in
[1:04:46] right
[1:04:48] if we try to we're just trying
[1:04:50] to say well where did it get to today or
[1:04:52] where did this get to today
[1:04:54] or where did this and we're working to
[1:04:56] try to fit prayer in
[1:04:58] i i know this that even when my wife
[1:05:00] when you know when we had our boys
[1:05:02] things changed my
[1:05:04] wife was one you know when she wasn't
[1:05:06] working before we had the boys for paul
[1:05:09] my wife was was you know she would be
[1:05:11] off during the day she would have her
[1:05:12] time and
[1:05:14] when she didn't uh wasn't working and i
[1:05:17] mean she would be off in in the one
[1:05:19] spare bedroom and you know she had her
[1:05:21] time but now all of a sudden when the
[1:05:22] kids come along you don't have
[1:05:24] everything's not controlled
[1:05:26] you don't have everything controlled but
[1:05:28] this is where
[1:05:29] prayer this is where we learn
[1:05:32] even in all of our lives that prayer is
[1:05:34] not a ritual so that does that means it
[1:05:36] doesn't have to be in an altar it
[1:05:38] doesn't have to be beside my bed i don't
[1:05:41] even have to be on my knees
[1:05:45] but prayer
[1:05:46] is a condition of the heart
[1:05:49] you can enter into a moment of prayer
[1:05:52] and i looked at that many times again
[1:05:54] for my wife over the ironing board over
[1:05:57] times when she was making you know uh
[1:05:59] you know things for the for for the boys
[1:06:01] and things and you know just
[1:06:03] everything's on such a you look at the
[1:06:04] schedule and everything's all sort so
[1:06:06] you know seems like it's all scattered
[1:06:08] but there are things i'll say it like
[1:06:10] this with prayer there's things that we
[1:06:12] can ask god even in our lives as
[1:06:15] brothers and on and on to say lord i
[1:06:17] want to be very intentional about this
[1:06:19] so lord help me and show me we're saying
[1:06:22] teach us to pray i'd say lord help me to
[1:06:25] see lord the the what would be the best
[1:06:28] time or where i can move into these
[1:06:30] times
[1:06:32] asking god and taking advantage of these
[1:06:35] moments and of these times and don't
[1:06:37] get
[1:06:38] beat down
[1:06:40] if some things come happening within a
[1:06:42] day's time but don't ever become
[1:06:44] complacent with that either
[1:06:47] it's the balance
[1:06:50] so first it's a worship
[1:06:52] sometimes you get lost you'll get lost
[1:06:54] in worship oh jehovah i love you just
[1:06:56] begin to you know what
[1:06:58] you can sing
[1:07:00] i mean you can sing even if you can't
[1:07:01] sing you can sing
[1:07:02] you can begin to sing
[1:07:04] you can begin to talk to him
[1:07:07] elisha wasn't in an atmosphere to bring
[1:07:09] the prince of god down so he said bring
[1:07:11] a minstrel
[1:07:13] sometimes put on some instrumental music
[1:07:15] put on some other music
[1:07:17] are you with me
[1:07:19] we're talking about what prayer is and
[1:07:21] how to approach these things prayer is a
[1:07:23] time of really being shut in with god
[1:07:25] and that should be the very focus and
[1:07:27] say lord i want to be shut away in your
[1:07:30] presence lord
[1:07:33] then
[1:07:35] after the worship of prayer
[1:07:38] then you come with a sincere heart
[1:07:40] asking
[1:07:43] if you abide in me
[1:07:45] not go out from behind the curtains in
[1:07:47] the world today remember he's talking
[1:07:48] about the tabernacle and run around and
[1:07:51] try to get back in the curtains tonight
[1:07:52] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:07:54] you otherwise if you're like aaron's rod
[1:07:57] that's pulled up to the shekinah glory
[1:08:00] by the golden pot of manna where you can
[1:08:03] eat it at any time
[1:08:06] and your soul is refreshed and blooming
[1:08:09] and yielding
[1:08:10] abiding
[1:08:11] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:08:13] you then ask what you will and it'll be
[1:08:15] given to you
[1:08:17] when we look at that in the in the word
[1:08:20] thy kingdom come
[1:08:22] thy will be done
[1:08:26] on earth even as it is in heaven
[1:08:28] i don't have to tell one of you tonight
[1:08:30] that you realize that we're still
[1:08:32] walking in a mortal body
[1:08:34] we get tired
[1:08:37] we get weary
[1:08:38] we still have that within
[1:08:40] our body
[1:08:42] and to recognize that that of the
[1:08:44] kingdom itself coming down
[1:08:46] it's not so much that the kingdom itself
[1:08:49] or that it's god coming down here rather
[1:08:52] it's god taking us up there
[1:08:55] it's that going into the realms going
[1:08:58] into his presence
[1:09:00] and
[1:09:02] i don't want to get into that tonight
[1:09:03] but there's
[1:09:04] all around the things that you can't see
[1:09:06] sometimes you can experience it you can
[1:09:08] see it sometimes in a service you can
[1:09:10] feel it even when you're praying you can
[1:09:12] feel it at different times it feels like
[1:09:14] an atmosphere you're trying to get
[1:09:15] through
[1:09:16] and it just seems like it's an
[1:09:18] atmosphere that's just wanting to just
[1:09:20] come upon things just remember what that
[1:09:22] is it's spirits that's out there
[1:09:25] it's trying to hinder
[1:09:27] but don't
[1:09:29] operate are you hearing me now
[1:09:31] don't operate by your feelings
[1:09:35] it's in that time where you've got to
[1:09:36] operate by faith
[1:09:38] jesus stood there before lazarus turns
[1:09:41] and said father i thank thee for i know
[1:09:43] thou hearest me
[1:09:46] always when daniel prayed he didn't get
[1:09:49] the answer for 21 days later
[1:09:52] i don't want to deal with that tonight
[1:09:53] but his prayer was heard
[1:09:56] the first time he prayed
[1:09:59] you say what happens if we go by
[1:10:00] feelings well you know what happens if
[1:10:01] we go by feelings
[1:10:06] well i don't want to be acting you're
[1:10:07] not acting
[1:10:09] you're standing on god's word
[1:10:11] and there's times we stand on god's word
[1:10:14] when we don't feel inspired
[1:10:17] when we don't feel you know like my
[1:10:20] goodness no we stand on his word because
[1:10:22] it's his word and his word is true and
[1:10:24] his word cannot fail
[1:10:27] and that's where we even want to say god
[1:10:28] even in that hour being honest lord help
[1:10:30] me i don't want to stand on my feelings
[1:10:36] braham said it like this prayer is not
[1:10:38] exactly bringing god down to man
[1:10:41] it's bringing man up to god
[1:10:44] as you pray
[1:10:46] you lose sight
[1:10:48] of these earthly things
[1:10:50] you sway out into somewhere else way
[1:10:53] beyond and on and on and on till you
[1:10:55] become
[1:10:56] into his presence
[1:11:00] and brother branham would take us there
[1:11:02] and show us
[1:11:03] think about standing before the presence
[1:11:06] of god and in his presence before his
[1:11:09] throne even for that person who has done
[1:11:12] wrong you can't accuse him before the
[1:11:14] throne
[1:11:17] now in any of the other places you can
[1:11:18] accuse them
[1:11:20] lord they've done me wrong and they've
[1:11:22] done but when you get before the throne
[1:11:26] you can't stand there and accuse him
[1:11:29] but what you find yourself doing is
[1:11:32] is entering in on their behalf and
[1:11:36] looking and saying lord they didn't mean
[1:11:38] to do that
[1:11:40] well by the same i don't know if they
[1:11:41] did or not but you see you're entering
[1:11:43] beyond the earthly atmosphere
[1:11:48] and god's letters god's letting us know
[1:11:51] even by way of this and we can take take
[1:11:53] many scripture but letting us know by
[1:11:56] way of this there is victory
[1:11:59] in prayer
[1:12:03] it's victory and prayer it lifts us up
[1:12:06] above the earthly confines our feelings
[1:12:09] and
[1:12:10] let downs and situations and on and on
[1:12:13] and i'll say it in this manner again
[1:12:16] that prayer itself brother branham would
[1:12:19] say it let me just add another it's a
[1:12:21] key that opens every door
[1:12:25] it's a key that opens every door and
[1:12:27] brother brahm thanks the people and he
[1:12:29] says regarding prayer he says that's the
[1:12:32] secret to all the mysteries of god
[1:12:34] that's the key that opens the door to
[1:12:37] everything of god is prayer
[1:12:40] it's the key
[1:12:43] it's more on that part but i want to
[1:12:45] just move on
[1:12:46] so prayer
[1:12:48] is staying in contact with the heavenly
[1:12:50] father
[1:12:53] it's staying in fellowship
[1:12:55] it's just like
[1:12:57] right here i'm not going to be too much
[1:12:58] longer but i don't want to
[1:13:01] i'm just going to be a couple more
[1:13:02] moments
[1:13:03] but prayer you know it's staying in
[1:13:05] fellowship
[1:13:06] how many times you sit down with
[1:13:07] somebody and say hey brother what's been
[1:13:09] going on let's let's have some coffee
[1:13:11] and catch up
[1:13:14] why
[1:13:15] because you had a lot of time did maybe
[1:13:16] you've seen one another
[1:13:18] but you haven't talked to one another
[1:13:21] you can come to church you see him
[1:13:23] working but maybe you haven't talked to
[1:13:25] him
[1:13:26] maybe haven't really been talked to him
[1:13:28] and really had that openness with him
[1:13:30] but prayer is fellowship
[1:13:34] if there's someone if i can say it in
[1:13:36] this way that you understand it if
[1:13:38] there's one person you want to be
[1:13:40] buddies with
[1:13:41] it's with the lord jesus
[1:13:43] if there's one person you want to tell
[1:13:46] everything it's him
[1:13:48] see somebody see you you get within
[1:13:50] things here and think about it
[1:13:53] you know you can have a situation going
[1:13:55] on and you go tell this person you go
[1:13:57] tell that person of course nowadays the
[1:13:59] way things are
[1:14:01] people just tell everybody on facebook
[1:14:05] is that right
[1:14:07] that's not what a christian does
[1:14:12] can we have an access to go to god in
[1:14:14] prayer
[1:14:17] and it doesn't you can you can you can
[1:14:19] you could tell other people they can't
[1:14:21] help you but god can help you
[1:14:26] you can tell them you're just as
[1:14:27] burdened when you leave from talking to
[1:14:29] them but prayer is is a place that you
[1:14:32] can stay in fellowship
[1:14:34] you stay in contact and it's necessary
[1:14:39] as an individual as a person you can say
[1:14:41] well i believe i've got the holy ghost
[1:14:44] then as you have the holy spirit in your
[1:14:46] life you must stay in fellowship
[1:14:49] you must stay in contact with god
[1:14:53] and and
[1:14:55] i say it in this way and it's not in a
[1:14:57] way necessarily to scold you but it's a
[1:14:59] way to say
[1:15:00] praying over our oatmeal is not prayer
[1:15:04] that's part of prayer receive all things
[1:15:06] with thanksgiving
[1:15:08] but that's not our prayer life
[1:15:11] but our prayer life is and where there's
[1:15:13] a time it's a way with god where we have
[1:15:16] time we're getting away with god and
[1:15:18] sometimes those things vary in our life
[1:15:21] sometimes you'll have more time in
[1:15:23] certain seasons of life certain times of
[1:15:25] life even during a week
[1:15:28] sometimes you'll have more time on this
[1:15:30] day or this day don't get all down
[1:15:32] because i don't have to have time this
[1:15:34] day or this day but look at the times
[1:15:37] and the days that you do have and make
[1:15:39] the most of it
[1:15:43] it's storing up
[1:15:46] prayer
[1:15:47] is storing up
[1:15:50] i'm going to read this statement here
[1:15:51] just a moment prayer is is extracting
[1:15:54] there from the presence of god and you
[1:15:56] you and i both know
[1:15:58] what it is when we are in god's presence
[1:16:00] you come out of god's presence
[1:16:02] and i tell you it doesn't matter what
[1:16:04] has been taking place or what's going on
[1:16:06] it's just you've got such a rest
[1:16:09] you've got a piece about it even how
[1:16:10] you're looking at things because you're
[1:16:12] no longer looking at it we're no longer
[1:16:13] looking at it through earthly earthly
[1:16:15] means
[1:16:16] think about the lord jesus
[1:16:19] you had to stay in fellowship
[1:16:21] now watch this it's not it's not supper
[1:16:23] person
[1:16:25] remember god became one of us
[1:16:29] where god came down
[1:16:32] and god
[1:16:33] so became one of us
[1:16:35] as he created and made his own
[1:16:38] tabernacle that he could dwell in
[1:16:42] so i want you to think of this
[1:16:44] hear the lord jesus in luke 6 12 it says
[1:16:47] it came to pass in those days that when
[1:16:49] he went out into a mountain to pray and
[1:16:52] continued all night in prayer to god
[1:16:56] on and on you can find to the scriptures
[1:17:00] that the lord jesus spent much time
[1:17:03] in prayer
[1:17:05] he was the bridegroom
[1:17:08] he was the keystone to the old testament
[1:17:11] the rapture of the old testament saints
[1:17:13] and here
[1:17:14] look where his walk was at
[1:17:17] he spent much time in prayer
[1:17:21] brother branham is taking us into a
[1:17:23] place on the healing of jairus's
[1:17:24] daughter
[1:17:26] and he refers back to this place in the
[1:17:28] scripture he says just in the previous
[1:17:30] of this chapter or i think it's a luke 8
[1:17:33] where he's speaking of jairus's
[1:17:35] daughter being healed we find there a
[1:17:37] place where the son of god spent so much
[1:17:39] time in prayer
[1:17:41] and if jesus had to spend much time in
[1:17:44] prayer to stay in fellowship with the
[1:17:46] spirit
[1:17:48] that was in him
[1:17:50] how much more do you and i
[1:17:52] have to spend in prayer
[1:17:55] much time
[1:17:57] in prayer
[1:17:59] if you only knew what time in prayer
[1:18:02] meant
[1:18:03] i'm just going to touch this here
[1:18:06] sometimes when you're in prayer
[1:18:08] god changes the complete destination of
[1:18:11] different things
[1:18:12] that's going to happen
[1:18:15] anybody felt like you were between a
[1:18:17] rock and a hard place
[1:18:18] you go into prayer and something and it
[1:18:20] seems like you know we could sit down
[1:18:21] and talk and say brother samuel there's
[1:18:23] just no way around this
[1:18:25] there's just no way around it
[1:18:26] and as humanly speaking as we could see
[1:18:30] we would be right there's no way around
[1:18:31] it humanly speaking
[1:18:33] but this is the access that we have in
[1:18:35] prayer
[1:18:37] we go to god in prayer and knowing
[1:18:40] having this consolation that god can
[1:18:43] change the whole situation
[1:18:48] moses spoke
[1:18:50] prophetically inspiration caught
[1:18:52] him there as he stood before the red sea
[1:18:56] we're between a rock and a hard place
[1:18:58] inspiration caught him but then you find
[1:19:00] the flesh part come out and he begins to
[1:19:03] speak to the lord first inspiration he
[1:19:05] spoke to the people then he comes to god
[1:19:07] and god speaks to him and says why are
[1:19:09] you crying unto me
[1:19:11] when you when you read that in the
[1:19:12] scripture
[1:19:14] when you read it i don't read it where
[1:19:16] it sounds like that he's crying
[1:19:19] but you see god hears what's behind
[1:19:22] our words
[1:19:24] and god could hear that within moses
[1:19:26] voice and it seemed like you know here
[1:19:29] inspiration spoke not moses inspiration
[1:19:32] spoke to the people of god to stabilize
[1:19:35] them but then god is looking down there
[1:19:37] in moses and it seems as moses is crying
[1:19:40] and god speaks to that inner man on the
[1:19:44] inside that one who's been equipped with
[1:19:47] that meeting of the burning bush and god
[1:19:50] speaks to that man and reminds him i
[1:19:53] have commissioned you
[1:19:55] i have equipped you what is this red sea
[1:19:59] between you and the mountain i said i
[1:20:02] would bring you back to
[1:20:04] glory be to god he had an intimate
[1:20:07] moment with god where he was open
[1:20:11] had to be an openness brother joshua to
[1:20:13] where god could look down in there and
[1:20:15] god could see i can be i can be myself
[1:20:19] with moses i can let him know i can
[1:20:22] speak to him in this way and he'll side
[1:20:24] with the word
[1:20:26] it was an open channel
[1:20:28] and he spoke
[1:20:32] god moved
[1:20:33] that red sea
[1:20:36] he didn't just move the water
[1:20:38] they weren't walking on squishy ground
[1:20:42] they walked
[1:20:44] on dry land
[1:20:47] it was the breath of the lord of hosts
[1:20:50] that went forth
[1:20:53] it was his name as isaiah records it
[1:20:56] being uttered out that caused that sea
[1:20:59] depart
[1:21:01] there's times when you need a sea depart
[1:21:03] you need god you're a waymaker i need a
[1:21:06] way here lord
[1:21:09] prayer
[1:21:10] is a place that you can go
[1:21:13] to god
[1:21:15] sometimes when you're in the complete
[1:21:16] destination of different things that's
[1:21:18] going to happen
[1:21:19] he said he said god changes pardon me
[1:21:21] the complete destination of different
[1:21:23] things that's going to happen
[1:21:25] he said do you believe it he said it
[1:21:26] might be something fixing to happen and
[1:21:28] your prayer
[1:21:29] could change the whole
[1:21:32] situation
[1:21:37] the realm goes on into that into that
[1:21:38] quote and i'm just going to skip over
[1:21:40] certain things here just for this moment
[1:21:42] he reiterates how jesus spent much time
[1:21:45] in prayer
[1:21:46] when you look at this in john 6
[1:21:50] the disciples went on without him
[1:21:54] that's a fly i would welcome that
[1:21:57] maybe babies let me know spring's coming
[1:22:00] buddy
[1:22:01] [Laughter]
[1:22:03] think of it
[1:22:05] think of it
[1:22:06] jesus spent much time in prayer to stay
[1:22:09] in contact
[1:22:11] to stay in fellowship
[1:22:14] it's just like between those of you that
[1:22:15] are married you know you can be in the
[1:22:17] same house and eating at the same dinner
[1:22:19] table and going through everything and
[1:22:21] sometimes you have to just say you know
[1:22:23] what we need to reconnect
[1:22:27] because even through the busyness of
[1:22:28] life you just have to say you know we
[1:22:29] need to reconnect
[1:22:31] you have some time we just we just just
[1:22:33] step away and just
[1:22:35] just just reconnect and you sense that
[1:22:37] that's the way it is with god
[1:22:40] there's times as you sense that you know
[1:22:41] what lord
[1:22:42] i just need to really reconnect
[1:22:45] and there's times that you may we've
[1:22:48] been in prayer but there's times where
[1:22:49] you say you know what i want to take
[1:22:50] some time this weekend or i want to take
[1:22:52] some i just i just want to get to god in
[1:22:54] prayer there's a lot of needs i don't
[1:22:56] know about you but there's a lot of
[1:22:57] needs
[1:22:58] there's needs there's different ones
[1:23:00] with paul and different things i write
[1:23:01] it on my calendar write it in notebooks
[1:23:03] write any different things trying to
[1:23:05] remember and it's not about that i have
[1:23:06] to remember at all neither is it to you
[1:23:08] to remember it all but we're a body
[1:23:11] god places things upon the hearts of his
[1:23:13] people
[1:23:16] i'm closing
[1:23:18] i'm going to close on this quote
[1:23:20] some of you think yeah right i am i'm
[1:23:22] not close here
[1:23:25] they went on without him
[1:23:28] brother adam said see he says
[1:23:30] they went on and i may not included this
[1:23:33] part on the display but he says
[1:23:36] they went on
[1:23:37] without him
[1:23:39] he said they were going in the absence
[1:23:40] of the holy spirit or christ then
[1:23:44] in visible form
[1:23:45] on the road over
[1:23:47] trouble set in
[1:23:49] usually if you start anywhere without
[1:23:51] christ
[1:23:53] trouble's on its roof
[1:23:55] just as soon as the devil sees you out
[1:23:57] of fellowship with christ
[1:24:00] right then he will set out for you as
[1:24:02] hard as he can
[1:24:04] just as soon as he sees you away from
[1:24:07] prayer
[1:24:08] away from consecration
[1:24:11] satan will catch you right then
[1:24:13] if he possibly can
[1:24:16] prayer
[1:24:17] prayer is
[1:24:19] prayer is our contact
[1:24:22] with god
[1:24:24] we stay in fellowship
[1:24:26] with god
[1:24:28] stay available
[1:24:29] as a channel of the living god
[1:24:32] it's a place that we can go to
[1:24:35] before the throne of god
[1:24:37] and talk openly
[1:24:39] with boldness can talk openly without
[1:24:42] any reservedness of speech
[1:24:44] and to know that he
[1:24:47] hears us
[1:24:48] and if he could hear moses
[1:24:50] and tell him not to cry
[1:24:52] how much more can he hear you and i
[1:24:56] and he's there to equip us
[1:24:58] with what we have need of
[1:25:00] and i'll say it in this manner if
[1:25:01] there's things that i could look at
[1:25:04] and say just even in this year
[1:25:07] i pray god help us even as a church
[1:25:10] that every one of us that our prayer
[1:25:12] life
[1:25:13] would deepen
[1:25:15] you know it's one thing we've had prayer
[1:25:17] meetings here at the church at times
[1:25:19] over the years
[1:25:20] but it's not just to have prayer at
[1:25:22] church
[1:25:23] it's to have prayer in her home and just
[1:25:26] ask god to
[1:25:28] just direct you and see the value as
[1:25:30] many other places i could have read to
[1:25:32] you tonight but there is prayer is is of
[1:25:34] such a value and just to think and think
[1:25:37] of it in that way to stay in fellowship
[1:25:39] to stay in contact with all mighty god
[1:25:44] it's a privilege that we've been granted
[1:25:46] brother brown called it the greatest
[1:25:48] privilege
[1:25:50] that we've ever been given is to enter
[1:25:52] in to his presence
[1:25:55] let's pray
[1:25:57] heavenly father
[1:26:01] lord jesus
[1:26:03] there's many
[1:26:05] things that i know over a very familiar
[1:26:07] subject lord
[1:26:10] that you would take us and there's many
[1:26:11] different avenues that more that we
[1:26:13] could go
[1:26:15] but we certainly only want to
[1:26:17] lord move in the avenues that you would
[1:26:20] see when we would have need of lord
[1:26:24] fathers we look into this tonight lord
[1:26:26] with prayer
[1:26:28] i pray oh god
[1:26:30] for every one of us lord i think as we
[1:26:32] start this new year out and i know we're
[1:26:34] already lord a number of days already
[1:26:37] into it
[1:26:38] but all god may
[1:26:40] just be what resonates in our heart
[1:26:43] just seeing that value of prayer
[1:26:47] and just to enter into that oh god
[1:26:50] just to take it lord into
[1:26:53] and to move into this channel knowing
[1:26:55] that not just when there's situations
[1:26:58] that come up
[1:26:59] like a red sea or a mountain but those
[1:27:02] are
[1:27:02] those are examples those are testimonies
[1:27:05] those are moments
[1:27:09] that where you convey to us by
[1:27:11] experience
[1:27:13] the power
[1:27:15] of prayer
[1:27:17] now lord you've placed this in our hands
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:22] help us lord
[1:27:25] i pray that god that you would forgive
[1:27:27] us lord
[1:27:31] and help us lord to be
[1:27:33] more dedicated
[1:27:35] more sincere
[1:27:37] [Music]
[1:27:38] in these things
[1:27:41] lord i i believe and i
[1:27:43] i know it lord for a fact
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:47] that god the effect of our services the
[1:27:49] effect of services the effect of lives
[1:27:52] being touched the effect or god of
[1:27:55] healing of deliverance the effect of
[1:27:56] these things oh god
[1:27:59] it's time that's spent in prayer
[1:28:02] it's not the ministry
[1:28:05] ministry is set forth to encourage
[1:28:08] to minister the word that our
[1:28:10] faith would rise within that finished
[1:28:13] as you would speak to us lord
[1:28:16] correct us where we're wrong so there
[1:28:18] will be no hindrance in fellowship
[1:28:20] and to encourage us
[1:28:23] to move closer move deeper
[1:28:27] lord i'm asking tonight that for
[1:28:29] every one of us lord
[1:28:31] myself lord included
[1:28:34] god i want a deeper prayer life
[1:28:37] in this year lord god
[1:28:40] a deeper prayer life
[1:28:43] that's the key
[1:28:45] over and over lord your prophet would
[1:28:47] say it in two different places that's
[1:28:48] the key
[1:28:51] that's a time that's a place of
[1:28:52] fellowship
[1:28:54] it's a place of openness
[1:28:56] it's a place of safety
[1:28:59] it's a place where
[1:29:02] lord we can
[1:29:04] be open with you
[1:29:07] and we can lord jesus move into a place
[1:29:10] to receive strength into our lives
[1:29:13] father i pray tonight
[1:29:15] no matter what that need is there might

[1:29:22] say what about me
[1:29:24] brother samuel
[1:29:26] i've not even come behind the veil yet
[1:29:27] but lord
