come quickly into unity God and help me to get out of the way the Lord I pray that you would speak in Jesus name god bless you this morning if you want to opening your Bible to the second Peter chapter 1 and our we okay brothers back there okay perfect wonderful while you're turning there I just reach you in the name of the Lord might not know me I'm not good with names so if we've met and I don't remember your name forgive me I can see brother Shawn as is correct and I saw brother Alex and just happy to let them down at the men's meeting and and you all made me feel very welcome and so I can tell brother Sam that he'd be proud of you and just a real warm spirit and I appreciate that and I know your pastor will too so if you got your word there opened up your sword we'll just start at let's start at verse 2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and if Jesus our Lord we're at 2nd 2nd Peter 1 in verse 3 according as his divine power hath given us all good things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue and I want you to just catch that because there's there's really important keys in here that'll give us believers a real rest and I want to I just want you to catch him according as his divine power his divine power have given us if I give you something I'm giving you a gift I'm not gonna expect it back I'm giving it it's yours all good things let's see has given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given given again that we're given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things as blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren giving diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye be if you do these things ye shall never fall the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word you can have your seats so my heart this morning is just to continue on it'll never be the same with your pastor being out but my heart is that he would find things in order and decently and my heart is that the sheep be fed the Sheep be fed sheep food I'm not interested in and you knowing me more though we want that also as fellowship but in in regards to the Word of God it's it's to connect your heart with the heart of God and not myself so I just appreciate the opportunity and bring greetings from back home also so we've read here in second Peter and you're all probably familiar with the message stature of a perfect man and I'd like to speak with you a little bit out of that this morning and in that message the profit keeps commenting and he in kind of laying the foundation and also towards the end he he's constantly saying the believers desire is to be closer to God the believers desire is to be like Christ and we can all say Amen it's a true believer that is our desires but the question we all have and the reason that we're here this morning is how do we get there what do we need to do what that's what we're striving for but how do we get there what do we do what is the secret to manifesting Christ's in our living and our everyday life because that's what that's what we desire the Prophet also says in the beginning of the statue of a perfect man he says my whole subject this morning is based on faith and that's going to be an important part of this my whole subject this morning is based on faith in another spot he says faith is the key it's the key to unlocking the door to stepping into that stature and he says all Christianity all you are all you ever will be is based upon faith in the word and how true it would be because in these in the opening of 2nd Peter here Peters telling us by these great and precious promises do you I guess I'd ask you the question do you see the Word of God as promises to you are they are they precious to you we they become precious and more and more as time goes on and maybe as we get older in our walk and older and life you realize that you realize the older you get the more you don't know and you would think it would be the opposite you know as a young man you would say well I don't really know anything but most times what we find as young men think they know everything and not no offense to my young brothers you know I've been there and and you know even even now there might be things that I I think I might know a little bit but but I come to know more and more I realized that you know I really don't know a whole lot and and that's actually a key that you know the opposite of this world the Prophet taught us you know I forget his exact words but he said just just don't know a whole lot just don't know a whole lot and so completely opposite to this world but we want to know these precious promises we we must know them because by knowing them and getting closer to God that's going to build our faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so as you as you hear these precious promises your faith something on the inside will reach out and grab a hold of them you might not feel like you're there yet this morning and you may feel the farthest thing from them and you say brother Brandon I don't I don't feel like these are mine yet just just just stand and wait be steady be steady stand still and so I just want to take it down and I always I always get a little fearful that I'll read too much but I just I just want to kind of give you in laying a foundation for this my mind set and in getting on this I've been preaching this back home when I'm called on to preach there and I just I was asking the Lord I just read you a couple quotes here the Prophet said and I heard a voice and this is out of rejected King and I heard a voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it now this is when he goes beyond the curtain of time I am more determined says than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never in in in their mortality could could never make you old and they could not cry it was just one joy and we're striving to to be Christ here on earth but we're striving for the redemption of our bodies for for that great combination of things that climax in in the rapture and that's our heart's desire and and I guess I see you know these young brothers on the front row you know there there is life ahead of you there is years ahead of you things you want to accomplish but I'll tell you there's nothing in this life that will compare to to what's over there waiting for us there's absolutely method so set your ambitions and work towards those things that's good we would encourage you to do that but don't ever let it cloud your vision so that to the heavenly vision but so the key to getting over there is perfect love nothing will enter here but perfect love and in birth pains he says because now this is the prophecy that was given over brother Branham because thou has chosen the narrow path the harder way thou has walked of your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee and now I you know you would think of that as as as landscape you know this plot of land over here is your portion but that's not what this is referring to I found in studying it's actually your portion of the word your portion of heaven your portion of huge portion of heaven of the word awaits thee what a glorious decision now has made this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory and love divine and another spot he says it'll bring to pass their tremendous victory and love their mind however it was said this that put yourself there put yourself there if nothing but perfect love divine love will enter them there but then these decisions this will bring a victory and love divine in our decisions and and I believe that that's not just a promise to the Prophet I believe as the bride that he was sent for we can latch on to that this is our tremendous victory in love divine so love divine character is a three amen so I asked the Lord and just trying to approach this this subject on love divine the Lord what's what's the starting place this just seems like such a such an important subject such a such a tremendous thing and I and then in prayer it just came back in and it was the stature of a perfect man because in verse seven after he lists these seven virtues he says and then charity and the Prophet says charity caps it charity caps the perfect man and so what's the foundation is is these virtues these things must be flowing from our life we must have them in them for that divine love for that victory and love divine to come forward the these you cannot have you cannot be lacking in these things so our nature is changed by receiving his nature so how do we get there our natures reciept change by receiving his nature then after we receive his nature we are to give diligence the scripture says to adding to our stature to becoming the perfect man Christ but the but there's something you must understand in our desire to become the perfect man Satan is going to fight you every step of the way that goes without saying I know but it's an important element because you make mistakes and you'll fall short and and you'll have shortcomings and and you'll you'll you'll have those times where you just sit there and put your hands over your face and say God how did I get here what did I what did I just do what did I just say why Lord and the believers gonna examine themselves where did that come from Lord why why did that manifest itself that way this isn't this isn't my heart but but Lord searched me Oh God then we then we we can we can step into that pray or as David prayed and it's not a it doesn't become a song it becomes our prayer search me O God and all my heart I pray you're a 3-part being two parts of that is unsaved so in the odds of say a sporting event we would we would want to play a little one-on-one okay well for whatever reason this is set up this way your your your partner that you're going to be playing against just invited a buddy over and now it's going to be two against one it seems unfair but the thing is is that when you receive the nature of Christ that's everything you need your skill level is going to be so far beyond those two parts you're gonna win the end of the game has already been determined amen and that's going to flow from the inner man not not the part not the part that you see okay it's not the part that you see it's the inner man that you don't see and you might not feel like you're there this morning you might feel so far away from it but I'll tell you if you have a desire to become the perfect man or perfect woman of Jesus Christ that's all that's what you need that's that should tell you that there's something on the inside of the inside so if you in the back there if that picture we can come up if you have that I just want to show you this so I'm sure many of you have seen this before but you know I wish so bad I could have been there in that in that service because he'll point to it and he'll refer to it the Prophet does and boy I just I wish I could see exactly what he's what he's pointing at but you get an idea and and you know God protects his word so I just believe that we can catch that by revelation so if you just leave that up just for a moment and then and then you could shut it off so notice it's a pyramid to this thing to this stature the Prophet uses a pyramid and it would seem peculiar to use this but again in studying this you know just asking the Lord why you know why is it this way you'll notice how a pyramid gets smaller up at the top and it becomes it becomes tighter it becomes more honed okay it's coming to a point to be capped now if you want to shut that off to preserve the the bulbs on that that's fine lots of people have faith in various things that foundation is faith you have to have that foundation a lot of people have faith there's there's we might not say it's the right kind of faith but they have faith in something and many people have faith in God okay we could say they have faith in God but so that's why I believe that it's such a wide base not only a wide base is good for building off of but I believe that there you could say that there's there's a greater category of a group of people that would fall into this if that's all right to say sincere people believing having faith because they believe what they say is right there their faith produces a sincerity just just like us okay so now we can put us all on the same playing field but there is a distinction between the bride as you move towards the top of the pyramid next is virtue and virtue the Prophet says his power or strength if you remember when the woman touched the hem of His garment he says I felt virtue go out of me it was strength he felt himself get weak it was it was it was power leaving him and she received her healing now another interesting thing about this is you have faith on the bottom in in love at the top to cap it and it and it seems like as you study this it's almost like faith and the Prophet says this he says it comes up it's like he says refers to the bride tree he said it just seems to come up through the whole thing but as faith is pushing up from the bottom it's almost like charity is reaching down from the top grabbing a hope and pulling it up and you'll notice you know the pyramid is so perfectly formed and I try to pay attention to the time my getting and getting excited now so so you'll see the the pyramid is is so perfectly is so perfectly honed and shaped that you can't even fit a razor blade through it and it's interesting I was thinking about this I'm just just here for this service and I and I thought you know each of these just just seemed to mesh so perfectly you almost can't have one without the other it's one again one's reaching up and the others reaching down and they grab a hole and just kind of pull up and cinch it tight and it's it's performed and it's because I guess is because it's performing one being its its building one being its it's gonna be one one perfect man one perfect body and so that's why I believe it's it's happening that way and so I'm saying all this for a purpose hopefully it's not just rambling here so and you'll see faith faith and then virtue these are so perfectly in order faith and virtue so faith is going to come up so that there's power to heal there's there's there's power behind the faith and a lot of people a lot of people can have power power power too you could say power to heal power to bring an anointing down in a service power to bring an anointing and then there's they're speaking in tongues and and many congregations are feeling the same thing we feel here this morning but the one thing that they're lacking is power to live in overcoming life and that's that's what we want virtue for and by you living an overcoming life the Prophet talks about a lily upon lily and he says you know the the passerby is they behold it and it's beautiful and that Lily gives of itself freely in it and it's its power you have to have power to give to others and by you living and overcoming life somebody's gonna look on your life and say hey I can live it - amen I can live it - so now it's not only power for yourself it's virtue for others it gives out to to others watching your life but you see that group gets smaller it gets smaller your manner of conversation is a pretty big giveaway I want to focus this morning on temperance when we get to it but I just these are so good I can't let all of them go so your manner of conversation and this will make sense in a minute is a pretty big giveaway for people to know whether or not they can draw from your life by what comes out of your mouth you know when when the scripture talks about conversation it's more than what comes out of your mouth it's a life virtue it doesn't complain when others draw from it it's there to freely give so next next is knowledge and knowledge to me it seems I found is a pretty important element here and but it also seems to be where many people stop is on knowledge you can talk to somebody and boy they can they can lay it out they can you know maybe they could lay out the mysteries better than you could and and there's just they have a way with words and they seem so intellectual but what what what came to mind and maybe I heard this before I don't know but I just haven't written down that there's three kinds of knowledge worldly knowledge or intellect and and really God doesn't need to be in that they can have that and be super smart you know we would say engineers and architects and and those kind of things but really whatever you do for a living you might have a knowledge in that that somebody else doesn't have so you have a form of knowledge there's another kind of knowledge knowledge of God okay now understand what I'm saying knowledge of God you might know who he is somebody might know who he is they know of God they've they've they've heard of this man called Jesus before okay you understand what I'm saying but there's a deeper kind of knowledge and I believe that this is what this kind of knowledge is and that's that's an a heaven-born knowledge it's it's knowing God by revelation you could say knowing knowing the scripture would say you know talk about a man and he and he knew his wife it's an intimacy and can you understand it's an intimacy and it's revelation there's a there's a group that'll be set aside again why we're getting smaller on this pyramid is because there's a smaller group that God's going to share his heart with and it's going to be an intimate communication amen job said I have heard but now I see this last one has love in it okay and you'll start seeing how love just just kind of starts trickling down in here to bring these up the Prophet there says it's it's knowledge to judge right from wrong to judge that the word is right to believe the Word of God when you could punctuate the Word of God with Amen something that's coming from your mouth okay from your heart but out of your mouth so we're up at temperance and it's getting smaller now there seem to be some kind of breach here again like I said many people can can fit into that knowledge category a lot of people have knowledge but there seems to be a breach and going forward on to on to temperance and let me just catch my place here forgive me so once it crosses once you once you start building off of knowledge you start coming into something that that it starts getting into a behavior okay then I believe this is important it expresses the nature of Christ you you you no longer you can have faith and and I believe it will manifest itself but it could be it's not really seen I don't see your faith virtue it might manifest itself in something visible but I don't see you have virtue I don't see you have knowledge but temperance I'm gonna notice okay temperance I'm going to notice it you'll start expressing it the breach I believe is that true revelation I believe it's true revelation has love and grace in it you'll never you'll never have a revelation and belittle somebody else who maybe doesn't have the revelation you have with revelation comes humility and and and you'll notice that starts separating categories now that starts separating people out of what true knowledge is they may seem like they have a form of it but it's not the truth and and I wonder if we can just turn with me here to first Corinthians 13 first Corinthians 13 and verse one are you getting something this morning okay amen first Corinthians 13 verse one watch this now though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am becoming a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal really if you don't mind me using the expression this person who who can do this and not have charity is just annoying and they're just what they're saying it just becomes annoying and though I have the gift of prophecy and listen now and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so we just covered the bottom of this pyramid and have not charity I'm nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing now I want you to just catch something and I'll make a point here and move on charity suffereth long and is kind now when you see that pyramid in in the stature what's in it brotherly kindness charity suffereth long it's patient so you start seeing over here in this love chapter can't remember how I got here those questions about love what is that I loved of mine you start seeing these things pop up in the stature of a perfect man but what the difference is and in this may or may not excite you just at this moment but over there in that stature these are all nouns okay if you look at them they're nouns okay a noun is just it's it's what it is it's it's a thing it's it's a it's a speaker it's it's a bench right over here and charity when in this love chapter when it's when Paul speaking of charity they're actually verbs it's an action ok so knowledge you can have knowledge and great but without chair it's it's just annoying right but there has to be a power behind it that's actually expressing it that's actually doing something for the kingdom of God so so we're at temperance and I just add a little something here and I'm just um just trying to decide whether to go into it now we're not your forgive me I'm a I'm a young minister I'm young in the ministry so just bear with me a lot of veterans who have paved the way I'm gonna go I'm will go ahead and go into it cuz this has been pressing on my heart and I just found this some time ago and I tell you it just it really says a lot to a body of believers where the random says and this is I believe it's Christ the mystery love one another above everything love one another don't no matter what the devil tries to say I want you to listen closely okay now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and set him down and because and caused him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it now just bear with me I do believe the Lord will help me tie this in he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man or that woman that he'll be saved too or that woman or whatever it is just pray for them and stick with one another and stay with your pastor see he's the Shepherd and you give him respects listen now he'll lead you through and cuz he's ordained of God to do so now I'm gonna get ahead of myself a little bit and I just want to read a little bit further but I just this has been pulsating on my heart and you know you forgive me but it's a sweet group of people so I don't know if this is for somebody for someone something down the road or what it is but he says you're your shepherd your pastor he's ordained to lead you through now we're talking about temperance and temperance is you would think of something as as temperance as in not not drinking temperance do you stop drinking you would think tempers but temperance the Prophet says is self-control but what interested me was there's a lot of things you know and he mentions you know controlling your temper and things but what he talks about the most is your tongue and your conversation and that and this is this is where I'm getting into my thought for the day finally because you watch is the Prophet here he says he'll he'll Satan he'll bring somebody in he'll sit them down they'll start fellowshipping and then they'll inject the poison and how is somebody going to inject the poison it could be with an attitude a little bit but eventually it's going to start spilling out of their mouth and I'll tell you one thing that I found is that that poison will start attacking the pastor because he's ordained to lead you through and so if Satan can attack the pastor and get you to look outside of that or get you to get something to raise up against him then you're defeated and and that you know we've seen divisions we've seen we've heard of them and in many think church splits and things and and many times probably it could be back to somebody talking too much can you say Amen and so you know maybe the older ones you're established and and you don't need this but for you younger ones you watch what you say especially towards the pastor but not just the pastor now this is the body of Christ so if you speak against one another you're actually speaking against Christ can you say Amen and so these are very very important things because they can cause so much detriment and you might have you might have knowledge you might have faith you might have a gift of healing you might have that virtue flowing through your life but if you can't control this little member the Paul says you're nothing so we want to be careful and you know I just I just say I just want to tell you I appreciate you you the pastor's office is beautiful and you know I believe I believe you made it that way for them and I just want to say thank you because it's important it is important it's it's something special so now do you remember that congregation says amen the enemy will come and when he does just clinch that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all pray for him don't never clan among you or talk make yourself clannish we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of the body stay right there and God wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another so you may feel little and insignificant don't feel that way you you might be in in the analogy here you might be a little tip of the finger but I like the tip of my finger you know we know people who have who have they've lost it you know whether it's through a door or whatever it is you know a saw there's a lot of construction I just pray the Lord keep the tip of your finger cuz we like him but the bigger picture here is is the body of Christ it's it's the body you know if one of you you notice one of you is kind of stepping back a little bit and there's a little bit of distance reach out to him reach out to him and try to encourage them try to bring them back amen all right I'm just gonna continue on because this has some good things and I think the pastor would appreciate it and now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the church how we got to come here together and sit together in heavenly places if you look at well let me just continue and then I'll make that comment if God don't stay at home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in there to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you get to praying if you look at coming to church is just coming to church it's just no I got to get up and go to church again you're looking at it wrong when we come the scripture says we're seated now in heavenly places right now right when you congregate together that's that's you're bringing a little lick of fire and you come together and you make one big bonfire we're coming into the colder weather and we like to be warm bring your lick of fire together that encourages you we just had a campout and you know the story of that that pastor I don't know it real well so I'm gonna paraphrase a little and if I get it wrong forgive me we'll catch the thought behind it and the pastor comes to this gentleman this brothers house who hasn't been around quit quit coming or not coming around much and the pastor comes in and they sit down and I don't think they said much they're just looking at the fire in the fireplace and when a piece of the log a coal or an ember fell out and it fizzled out it quit burning and it just kind of smoldering and smoking and the pastor got up and he picked it up with the tongs and put it back into the fire and when he did it caught it ignited the pastor went back and sat down got up and said god bless you and walked out it just preached the fireplace just preached the whole service everything he wanted to say was just said by the fire and so this happened at the at the campout we had this piece of law you know not not too thick but about like that falls out and immediately it goes out it quits glowing and it's just a little bit of smoke and then the smoke disappears and so I kind of grabbed it and I threw it back up in there and as soon as I did I mean as as soon as it it's like it almost got just close to the fire and it ignited and then I took a log that had it been on the fire okay you catching when I'm laying down here and I picked up a log to add to it and as soon as it got on the fire it sat there for a minute and it was it caught fire that quick and so it is important to come to church you you'll fizzle out just like that log that Ember you'll fizzle out and die spiritually keep coming to church the Fellowship of the Saints is important okay I think we'll just can we keep going in this do you mind okay because we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted much more as we see the Day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another this will all man know that you are my disciples when you have loved one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's wrong or the sisters say Lord don't listen now don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him it'll affect that brother it'll take Christ right out of my life that poison acid of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle here speaking of Christ it'll kill the Spirit of God or drive it away from here it'll hurt your pastor it'll do everything seed don't you do that you just wax that much closer together drop take the buckle as the brother testified of the other night just that buck was on the whole armor of God just pull her up tighten it up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow listen where he goes talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you interesting all from the little member here goodness time is going let's let's turn to James together I've got some encouraging things at the end here I want to get to but there's so much air left James chapter 3 will read verse 2 I told you what the Prophet said about temperance and I have it read it yet so hopefully you're with me are you there so you men amen verse 2 for in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same is what a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body now I'm gonna put this little drop this little thing and I'm not gonna read the next verse but it talks about bridling a horse and maybe somebody knows I don't have a horse so if you have I'm sure you know more than I do but as I was studying these things I found it interesting to find that a course is Bridal if that horse is trained correctly okay that that bit that's in the horse's mouth you know if you ever ridden a horse in in you know in ironing experience who don't write him much you might when you want the horse to turn you'll pull real hard you know you'll you'll kind of really pull back or however you want to do or when you want the horse to stop whoa and you'll kind of try to lift its head up but actually a horse the most sensitive part of its body is right around its mouth and it comes they kind of come through the nose the nerve endings and right around the mouth and so really you could turn that horse if it's properly chained and the in the writer is is knows what they're doing you can turn that horse by just lifting one finger and pulling that rein out a little bit that horse will feel that that touch and it'll turn and so James uses that as as I guess if I'm saying it right an analogy to get his point across it's it's by just a bit we're able to turn this whole massive body okay so let's let's read here verse 13 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual and devilish for we're envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy why because you can say something and that's not what's really on your heart and a lot of times you might be able to slip by but in the words of the Prophet by-and-by it'll manifest your heart will manifest and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace so it's interesting he's talking about our mouth he's talking about our words and and we can make peace okay that's I'm gonna have to skip some of this I believe you know there's there's there must be discernment in our conversation and I believe that this is a key element of temperance there must be discernment somebody might ask you a question but you need to be discerning of the spirit behind that question you need to discern your own heart of why you're saying what you're saying what's what's your motive what's your objective because it is important that's that's hypocrisy in your heart if you're saying one thing but in your heart you're meaning another and we all do it just be honest we're all in the flesh amen I raise both hands I'd do it we don't want to if a believer doesn't want to but but we do do it so Ephesians 4 and I was gonna read it but I'm just gonna skip it for time sake well I guess I'm gonna read it that don't corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace into the ears corrupt something that's corrupt is is it's of no use that's of no use edifying is building up let that which is edifying come out of your mouth you know you got you all have been doing beautiful work here I just admire and this is just gorgeous and you know as as you kind of board you may be you know you're gonna cut a board and put up the wall there and so you cut it and you have a little piece left over it's it's corrupt there's no use for it you throw it away but you're building you're building something and and Paul says here we want to build it and throw away the excess throw away what's not needed what's not edifying amen let me just um are you all doing okay okay I believe this this is important to hit also so in talking about our communication our conversation we live in the 21st century I think we're still there there's a lot of new forms of communication email texting I won't I'm gonna say social media and I'm gonna try and stay off of it because I I do see the benefit of it I do see the benefit of texting but if that's all you're doing you're losing you're missing an important element called relationship yes we text one another yes there's there's social media to you know stay connected in things but it's it's it's a false sense if that's all you're doing you need you need interaction you need to get together they meant it's an important part but so we can talk about the Prophet talked about our tongue but we're living here some I think it is 50 years later we need to bring it up to speed we need to bring it up to our time so now you can you can text and that person doesn't see your body language they don't hear the tone of your voice so it's a lot easier to try and sneak something in to manipulate to show yourself friendly but in your heart you can't stand that person it's a lot easier nowadays so we have to bring it up to speed we have to bring it up to our day and and don't get me wrong I I have like I said I have seen social media be a good tool but most of it the rest of it as a garbage can and we'll still be friends after that there should be some benefit from the conversation there should be some benefit from what you're posting on Facebook there should be some benefit or whatever other forms of social media I know there's snapchat and things you know that the you know young people hope that you that us older ones don't start catching on to the new what's new because then if we don't say it they can let it slide a little bit but there's snapchat Twitter all those things we'll just throw it all in so so you can't get around it there should be some positive deposit something edifying something that builds up we're gonna have listen we're gonna have we don't we don't have to how do I want to say this there's gonna be like conversation okay and you shouldn't feel bad for that the problem and where we need to examine ourselves if it's if it's always like if you can't go deep why can't you go deep you need to examine yourself why can't you go deep why can't you talk about deeper things why you know if someone says hey how you doing and oh good and then you you know you're throwing a joke why'd you do that it it may seem I'm not trying to go off on some psychology thing okay I'm asking you because nowadays there's so many there's so many hurts and things that that do affect our spiritual walk and and they do affect our our unity and so and I don't know I'm just letting it flow now so you know why why do you do that why do you put up a wall you should examine your relationships what what walls are around you and and and be prayerful what can we do to bring those walls down because I'm going to tell you this as we as you as you climb this pyramid what do we get into brotherly kindness we get into charity it's expressions you're gonna be in heaven with one another okay we're going to be we're part of the kingdom of God now but we're going to rule and reign over there with one another I don't think we should have the mindset that just because we know that one day we'll be over there and everything's perfect over there What did he say only divine love enters over there so if only divine love goes you must have something now right we must have love divine now and we want those things pulsating in our heart we want to be the stature of a perfect man and a perfect woman now so I just ask you a challenging question ask yourself how much would you have to talk about if you didn't talk about others or negative things and keep that in mind when we converse okay now I don't think I'm gonna get to reading in out of the stature of a perfect man where he talks about temperance but it go go if you get the opportunity go and look just for times sake I'm going to admit it here go look up where he talks about temperance where he introduces it it's real short it's some but it's it's solid it'll make you think okay but I just want to give some encouraging things now alright so in second Peter are you with me for a little bit longer in second Peter he says give diligence and add so if you're like me my personality is okay then then man I fail every day how do I add how do I give how do I give diligence to this thing what do I do watch these words giving all diligence add me Lee interest oneself more earnestly oh wait wait wait on the Lord interest oneself most eagerly you're seeking you're desiring your heart is to be the stature of a perfect man and woman desire earnestly furnish add or minister nourishment unto in other words feed your experience what do you do what do you do what's your part in building the stature what's your part to come into the image of Christ feed on the word feed on the word he says now remember the black bird with peacock feathers he says in the earlier on he said so you know some people can can have these things and they exhibit them and and they don't actually have the nature of Christ in them it's like a it's like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers so that's what he's referring to here don't forget them see don't try to add it till you're actually born again because it won't work you can't make it work it'll crumble somewhere but when you get down here a genuine born-again dove that you don't add nothing it adds to you and comes up all right coming into perfection now says this always put in before you remember it was he that made the promise and God is able to keep everything he promised if you see it in the Bible and you believe it then forget it that's all it's all over have patience if you've done what he said and it seems like it went wrong stand still be patient the key always set him before you and there's only one thing you can to tune up that's the scripture to tune you up the Holy Scripture in the scripture to you bring you directly into the target again that's right he says a living power coming from a living God making a living a living man a living image in the stature of God what are all these things it takes you completely out of the equation be patient stand still keep him before you if you're if you're do we have hunters in here any hunters a couple okay we'll say we'll make it we want to grab everyone here you're driving down the road you're driving down the road and we'll say we'll say there's a building a mile ahead and you're driving towards that building you need to keep that building in your sight and then your focus the whole time in order to get there drive towards that building like this and get there you know the the vehicle just the tires and things that'll throw you off you won't hit your target if you keep Christ before you keep walking forward keep your eyes on Christ you will succeed you will make it this stature will manifest itself in your life I want you to be encouraged this morning and then he says and I'm getting ready to close if the musicians want to go ahead and come on up you could stand to your feet and then we ourselves can prostrate ourselves give ourselves up until God takes his transfusion to the name of Jesus Christ because there's no other name under heaven whereby man can be saved and transfers the life of Christ into us then we have this kind of faith the faith that Christ had and then when we can get so transfused by his power that we die to our own thinking so the last party says give ourselves up this time he says die to our thinking and our faith becomes a genuine faith hallelujah then the life of Christ is transfused into us we become living creatures of God a dwelling place where the Holy Spirit can send his radiant blessings down through there and we're in the stature of Christ so it's Christ in you that it almost seems it almost seems hard to fathom but it's Christ in you manifesting himself through you all's you have to do is is you know brother Branham said a gift is getting out of the way that's all you have to do just get out of the way it's learning how to get out of the way die to your own thinking give up your own thinking when you see a promise in the word and it says or you hear the prophets say you are the sinless bride of Jesus Christ your thinking is gonna come in Satan's just gonna Satan's just gonna try to try to throw something out in front of you yeah that's everyone but me everyone else at church that's your promise that's yours by faith take a hold of the precious promise and it'll manifest itself in your life and if you say brother I don't have that faith this morning I'm struggling I'm struggling stand still be still it's so contrary to everything in this life be still be patient I brought I brought a little illustration for you I hope you don't mind standing while I finish up here but it just it just helps get the blood flowing so in here is dirt Potter dirt okay try and do this can you all see the pot somewhat okay this is the outer man okay you can't see what's inside of this I can't see you look in the mirror every day you don't know what you don't know you can't see yourself I mean you see you see the outer man but you don't see the inner man right so but if you take this and we in well most a lot of people like apples some might not and we're gonna examine the heart and maybe the apple you know it's got a little puncture hole over here it's got it's got a little bruise on it it's got it's got some spots where it might have fallen maybe they picked it up off the ground it was dirty and they washed it okay it's the outer part but in this Apple I can get it here in this Apple is a seed in this seed is all the virtues of the perfect man I mean in this seed is all the apples that will ever be produced by this scene now I'm gonna plant the seat in this dirt okay so I just put it into an atmosphere and I'm gonna bring a little water of the Spirit on it and now it's 1237 I don't know how long you guys usually go to but we're all gonna sit down until this starts growing we all know that we will never leave probably not even next year we'll still be sitting here waiting for this thing to grow this is a growth and this is what I want I want to bring this point out first of all in this seed is all the virtues of the perfect man the second thing you need to realize is that it is a growth and it's a process you would think I would was completely insane if I was serious and said let's wait until this grows because we know that it's a process it's a process why is it important to come to church because there's an atmosphere it's for your benefit why it's it takes an atmosphere on this seat it takes it takes the light of the word on the seat it takes being in the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit raining down on it to get to bring the life that's inside of it out so be encouraged stand still get in the atmosphere get quiet before the Lord and grow you might not see it we don't see this growing but maybe in a few days that seed would start to rot the outside and it would start to it would start to change its the transforming by the renewing of your mind you say man ah quit talking here can we just bow our bow our heads here a moment and maybe maybe here this morning maybe you see the promises of God you know you you heard this morning that there's a stature there's a life that God's looking for and maybe you feel far away from it maybe the devil comes up and he says you know what that's not for you you'll never obtain it I want to come together in prayer and ask that the Lord would help you to see past that all's we can do is believe there's nothing more with it it takes Christ so don't look at the outer man look to the look to your heart this morning that there's a desire to become the stature of Christ just hold that in your heart as we pray our dear Jesus I come before you Lord and father so many times Lord I wonder God after preaching your word Lord if I got out of the way and I wonder Lord if I just hope and pray father that I did and that your bride here was edified this morning Lord sometimes when we hear these things we can feel so far from the mark especially if we made a mistake during the week but father under the sound of my voice now God I just we want to bring those things before your throne if we made a mistake God we confess it now father and we pray Lord for your forgiveness if we fed on something wrong Lord during the week and it didn't edify us Lord but it opened the door for the enemy to come in forgive us father Lord our hearts aren't to do those things but Paul said that he finds that there's two laws working in him this is the law of sin where he does the things that he doesn't he doesn't want to do and he doesn't do the things that he wants to but there's another law and that's the law of the Spirit of Christ and by that law we can overcome father I pray God help us to overcome today Lord let your sheep have been fed let them see God that they just need to sit sit still be still keep coming the church keep supporting their pastor supporting one another Lord Father I pray that a unity would be amongst this congregation Lord like no other pretty father that if any visitors would come that they would see Christ that that power of Christ and overcoming lives lord help your sheep today my heart Lord is that they would be edified they would be encouraged that if they were corrected they would take the correction and that you would help them change Lord because we can't do it in ourselves give us power to change to control our tongues Lord we ask these things now be with each one Lord be with me with brother Sam Lord and this other brother overseas God bring them back safely and Lord protect their families here a home Satan attacks the hardest when when they go and I just pray a hedge of fire around him in
