given to us lord that we can be able to come together lord we just ask the lord in this time the moment that we have that god that you would just help us to lay aside all of the cares and the thoughts of the day and of tomorrow may we just put it all into your hands lord because father you're the one that we're looking to all of our thoughts about things could never change the situation they can't

peace lord such clarity it brings life oh god lord we just lord we desire oh god as we've come here when the songs of zion has been sung lord father and atmosphere lord has been created that you can come down in lord and just move among us in a special way the lord we need to hear from you tonight i need you lord i i need you lord god that you would come and just guide me lord i have before me lord things that you've dealt with my heart lord for some time but lord we need you to come and be the speaker lord your god i yield my body lord my lord all that i am lord to you and and this congregation oh god that you would just come lord and speak to our hearts in a very personal way lord may you just come here lord just move right down lord into every life and lord situations oh god

evening lord and just put things right in order lord god and just move in a very special way a very personal way lord in our lives lord you know every need lord that's here and we just lord god ask that you'll just now come lord and speak to us lord speak to us through your word we pray we love you and we thank you father in the name of jesus christ amen amen we want to invite you to the word of the lord let's go to first corinthians 13 i'm going to start there and then we're going to move move on and just as you're turning there i'm just going to read just two verses out of there but we see how that paul has said all of this here in the very first three verses that a lot of great exploits or things that could be done but yet if love itself is not present it doesn't account for anything as paul would say over and over i am nothing and so we recognize that this love is much higher than that filial love that we would have or a husband would have for his wife and wife or a husband we recognize that this this charity this love we're speaking of it's it's god's own love it's his own life it's his word it's it's who he really is and so this is this is what brings about as we looked at last week a real character within our lives it took the character of that life coming that you and i might receive life and that our lives might be molded and shaped by his life dwelling on the inside of us and here paul expresses this in verse 4 charity suffereth long it is kind it envieth not and it vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly it seeketh not her own is not easily provoked and think of no evil so we were looking at that a little bit last week and i just kind of put all those together and yet there's so many parts there but it doesn't act unbecomingly or rudely and it does not seek its own it isn't all about me and it also it doesn't it doesn't it's not easily provoked where it just quickly something comes up and it's quickly responding or spouting right back it's love is not easily provoked and it thinketh no evil it doesn't keep records of evil oh my god we need his help don't we amen amen may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to just take as the lord's been leading us on this for some time and we're looking at that part in there it does not behave itself unseemly and we find a lot of of those parts within it where paul was saying what charity is not and you know at one time and depending on how each and every one of us were natured in our first in our in our original makeup or temperament you recognize that there are things that many of you can look at even in the way that your makeup is and you can say wow what a difference since the lord has come into my life you find you find strength you find that the overcoming power is so real and how that it brings such a change on the inside and it's an overcoming because you're always going to be tested and you you'll find yourself that if you are not in the presence of god like you ought to be you'll find yourself very weak because he's our strength and that's what jude would say to building up yourself on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keeping yourselves in the love of god so it's there's there's an effect of a life that is in the presence of god and think how brother branham would talk about it when he would minister the different messages a hidden life with christ and what it takes to live in uh you know an overcoming life or why why uh you know why people are so tossed about he would deal with that refreshment of a life that is living behind the veil and this is something that within our lives that we recognize that every day as believers that we do we can't live on yesterday's experience we've got to have a fresh experience with almighty god it takes first of all a real experience with god where our nature has been changed and and god has brought a real dominion on the inside of our life and then from that once that that has come into our life well it's just a desire that we have there's no other joy outside of getting into his presence and that's where we realize this is my source of strength prayer then does not become something that's laborious or i have to read my bible or i have to pray or no no you recognize this is my strength and this is where god is god he he ministers to my heart and you just simply take it not even in a manner of of study you just you know you just have a time with him there's times for study but there's a time just with him to allow him just to speak to you and even in prayer where we're not the ones always doing the talking but where we stop and allow him to talk a little bit amen i think that makes a huge difference in our life and this is where we draw strength as as a believer and we look at this here with in in the part of in taking the contrast and that's really how the lord's been leading us on this in in in that of that when it says does not behave itself uh unseemly rather we want to say it is that of honor so our life is to be a life that looks and looks at things in honor holds things in honor esteems that in honor and to treat one another with honor and respect you know brother branham as we looking at this here in the scriptures and just taking this here over the last uh some some of these last few moments uh services how the lord was just dealing with us on that of order and authority that even to where what goes on even outside of these walls and the walls of our home that god himself has set all of those things in place and god values those who value authority and respect that authority because god's put it in place and we we recognize that's not always something that maybe is popular but you see brother brown i mean and i've i mentioned to you as a church if you haven't listened to the message respects in a while i've been living in that message for months now and just going through that message over and over because even within the part of when brother brown would tell us he said even if you can't respect the man you respect the office that they hold and to see how you know i just had a person you know just some time ago and here they were present when we happened to speak a few weeks back in one of the first services on that with how servants and masters and how we relate to every situation and the individual just they told me they said you didn't realize it but what god had you to speak that was for me because i just had a change in the supervisor and there's things that was going on at that time not even from here but how that you see god i don't believe it was just for that person i believe that was for all of us amen you see we we recognize that when we're looking at things in honor i want to just really set this here in the background because what i want to begin to speak on is some things has really just been pressing on my heart for just months and then see how god just brings this that to bring it right here and that is i want to speak on honor in the home brother bram says i think one thing is needed in the great universal church of god tonight is love we do not need other things as much as we think we do and all these other things our emotions and our gifts they're all wonderful and to god we give praise but if those gifts are not governed by love then they are not effective love should govern the home love is the greatest force that was ever put into the power of man how many believe that it's the greatest force that's ever been put into the power of man you're aware as a believer when you you listen to the messages on divine love and when love is projected and on and on you listen to all of those messages you will find a common thread that is throughout that when love has been projected then grace steps in and produces what love has called for so but first grace can't step in if love's not been projected so that that part is very very important so love is the greatest force that was ever put into the power of man a home that's not disciplined by love is not much of a home he's talking about the order of it if the husband and wife doesn't solemnly love each other they can't trust each other he says that's why i think that instead of resting our faith upon some emotion which is all right or some gift which is all right like shouting speaking with tongues or other things that we take for saying that we have the holy spirit when we do this or those things are all right now let me just pause here a minute don't finish reading the quote on me let me pause here for a moment you see when the message of the hour come let me just lay this in a little bit of teaching when the gifts were restored there out there in uh for at the beginning of the lady of seeing age here with that part that was not the long promised restoration back to the word but it was a restoration of gifts are you with me you find that then here the word comes behind that because every gift is to be judged by the word is that right every dream every vision every prayer everything nothing is to go beyond the word it's always to be tested by the word is that right this is where you find remember how brother brahma make a statement he talks about how he says you know when how that you know satan's he came there in a robe and he came and presented himself to martin and you know he says martin fall down and worship me and he's there in my great supernatural happening brother braham said many pentecostals would have fell for that is that right but he said martin looked at him and he saw this crown and he said get behind me satan because he knew the word said that his saints shall crown him didn't matter the experience didn't matter how good it felt didn't matter to all the emotions and this is what brother branham is bringing it back to is let me just bring it down even to our lunch box in our home we can have a lot of different emotions but what everything should be brought right back to and tested is the word no matter what it is in the church no matter what emotion it's got to come back to the word because that's where faith can really rest that's where all true honor comes from is the word is that right honor comes from the word think about the time that ahab in them you know when they called up and they wanted to go on down to ramoth gilead ahab wanted to do it so ahab didn't want any voice that was going to speak against it and this is why he had all his prophets that were around him you know the bible says in the multitude of counsel there is safety and that is true but this is where it has to be who is the council that's established around you come on somebody because real counsel is that which holds to that word and to think of here they were they outnumbered all all of them but jehoshaphat said is there not one more prophet of the lord ahab said i hate that guy he's always prophesying evil concerning me but jehoshaphat said let the king not say so you see among all of those prophets that were there here they were under an anointing but it was a lying spirit hey man they were emotional they know that they felt the goosebumps and whoa glory they felt all of that but the problem was it wasn't with the word and micah being a true prophet of god he just didn't lay aside and say my look at all of them my goodness what a meeting that's going on micah stood there and he knew what god had spoke through elijah and he knew this can't go this way because there's a curse upon ahab is that right and so you find that within this that god in this hour brings it around that not that gifts are done away with gifts are not looked at as well those are just little things or or though no the everything is put in its place and its order it's kind of like a young lady who has her uh shower or whatever more where she gets her gifts her pots and pans she might be just looking at them pots and pans for months but eventually there comes a time there's a home where they're going to be put in place and order and she's gonna need this stockpot when it comes to making pasta she's gonna need this one when it comes to making rice everyone has its purpose and that's how the gifts go in the body to be used by the lord jesus christ through his bride glory be to god so we're not out of line we know right where we're standing amen but if we come back to the principle look what he says love first and then those things i think our church would progress a lot faster if we would get god first and god is love now the scripture tells us here when we look at this of how love itself brother branham has laid this in love it brings trust it brings confidence it brings faith it brings respect and to think the home itself is just a small part that reflects what the economy of god is to operate or how the economy of god operates so the thing there is a there's a set order of which and i want you this is where i want to take you here tonight there's a set order here of which the leadership and the presence of god is to flow within a home god has a divine order and god will never depart from that order he set that order in place and so when we look at this here in the scripture i want to just move here and i just been kind of moving back and forth and let me just go to one scripture here in first corinthians 11 verse 1 paul is speaking here to to the corinthian church and to us as believers be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ and he says now i praise you brethren that you would remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god now notice how paul would would bring this in here he is paul being the first messenger there to that age paul paul was given this of which peter did not have peter paul was given this to set the church of the living god in order in that hour it was to paul was revealed the mystery that was hidden god and how that paul just as much as peter god wrought effectual in peter's ministry to the jews he wrought effectually towards the gentiles in paul's ministry and this was something that was established paul was letting it was taking it back and tying it back into the place of the fall that took place in the garden of eden where at that one time that man and woman were co-equal together with god but after the fall has come now here they are set within a dual covenant and god has a certain order and he refers there even in that place of how the woman let your desire be unto thy husband and he shall rule over thee now let me just i've got to just drag my feet here a little bit because that word rule does not mean to dominate over are you with me that word that word to rule it deals with so much more of a cultivate and how that that direction let me say this to you that speaks to us as as husbands as men within the home there is a great responsibility it will not be the woman that will answer it will be us as husbands as men that will answer it's like for this church i'll give an account on that when i stand there i will give an account for the word that i preach or what i have would have failed to preach there is an accountability that is held there but if i can say i have not shunned to declare the full counsel of god god you know i've told them i'd sent this they went and they did this anyhow but it's off of my hands i don't want anything on my hands when it comes to that day i'd rather somebody be mad at me now i'd rather you because you might get a little mad now but i got confidence in the holy spirit if you're a child of god god will deal with your life you can't stay mad at the word that's being delivered [Applause] the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god now notice paul goes on he says every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoreth his head is that right now notice just even in in the hair now that paul is speaking of that if a man have long hair and you know this in the scripture but moving down to it if he were to have long hair he dishonors his hand is that right but every woman that prayeth or prophesied with her head uncovered dishonoreth her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven the background of it is that it it would be it would be an unacceptable thing for a woman to be found out in public and now taking this in account of the time if her head was shaven it spoke of a form of adultery it spoke she was not under headship it spoke there was there was fault there was error and there was uncleanliness that was there all through the scripture a veil has been given and not just a veil here but the hair itself is the veil that of long hair that's given to the woman has her covering but for a man to have long hair he's a notice for a man indeed ought not to cover his fed head for as much as he is in the image of image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of man this is this is just a great part right here you see with that of the woman being the glory of the man the man recognizes this right here is my glory you wouldn't treat your glory wrong that's a reflection glory the word glory is honor she is thine honor is that right for man notice this for the man is not of the woman but the woman but the woman of the man the paul's taking it back here before the fall neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man so coming back to the beginning is that right so now when we see this for this cause off the woman to have power on her head because of the angels brother brown lays that down very clearly that of that of the long hair it shows that you have received and come under that messenger's message is that right now i know i know there's things in individuals you can know that they have long hair and they ain't come under nothing is that right but you see for those that have and really having that that real heart that is inclined to god's word what a great compliment because there's a character it's not that well long hair is in style no no if they're holding to that word but there's a character that's behind that oh i'm gonna preach for a little bit you see a person can have long hair but actually it's shaved off on the inside come on somebody you could have a man that's got short hair but he's a big on the inside he's a pushover come on somebody you see it it deals with a real character that's on the inside this is what god looks for this is god's desire is that there's real character that's on the inside now notice he goes on to say neither the nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of god judging yourselves is it comely that a man a woman pray unto god uncovered doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering let me just say this to you you've heard this and i've heard this and then you know you hear things well i'm just trimming the dead ends where does your hair grow from does it grow from the outside in or from the inside out preach brother samuel that don't even make sense that's a lie that the devil has told what is long hair you might there might be a sister then maybe her hair can't get very long because of just how her hair is long hair is uncut hair you might have the longest hair in the church tonight but if you took off a millimeter of it you've got cut hair short hair now i'm not condemning anybody but i'm condemning that spirit because when god look what god did jeremiah 7 29 when israel went away from following god because they wouldn't obey his voice jeremiah 7 29 god said cut off thine hair old daughter of jerusalem why because that she was rebellious and god said you might as well let it display on the outside of what's on the inside honoring the home i'm getting somewhere i'm getting somewhere so here when we come back to this here you see god has an order thing sometimes it's just that simple that just even what is there on the outside of how god has set that forth just of an honor that here a woman would she here in honoring god's word honoring her husband and the husband himself honoring that of his wife let me just assert this in this manner there is no other way to have honor in the home without the word the only way that where honor can come in the home is by the word other than that remember the honor itself that the pharisees had among one another is they did this and oh this one honored them because of you know their position and they were always trying to outdo one another instead of holding to the word when we hold to the word then it is honoring the word it's honoring god then honor can come into the hall oh my my my my look at this here tonight god has an order here in psalms psalms 133 verse 1 david said behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity now unity ain't just dwelling under the same roof are you here now listen now preach with me i'm gonna i'm just i'm in the mold just just the teeth just preach with me now don't get oh my brother samuel you don't know my situation but remember you can't fix your situation god's the one who can fix it and you don't want to sit there and say oh but you don't know this why don't you just invite him to your pew right now invite him and say god come take over in this situation and and don't sit there with the you don't know all the records why don't you just let him come and let him deal with that if that's what's here tonight order whole honor in the home notice for brethren to dwell together in unity god doesn't want disunity in a home he doesn't want disunity in a church is that right god does it because when you find that if you find that of disunity this is why brother branham could say even when he would speak to individuals and in church order he said when you feel like you're getting to know more than your pastor or he says or in that way he says that you just can't do that he said then it'd be best for you to find another church he wasn't commending them on that he was letting them know they've rose to a place they should never have rose to but in order to go on you better find yourself another place is that right so when we we see this it's it's important to dwell together in unity god likes unity he likes harmony he likes a oneness that is there a oneness of spirit this is god's desire i mean you know for let me just go on to preach here it is like the precious ointment notice what he describes this unity it's like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garment as the dew of hermann and as the dude descended upon the mountains of zion for there the lord commanded the blessing even life forevermore do was necessary in these areas in order to bring life because it can get really hot think of this who was it that put the anointing oil upon aaron it was moses the prophet the word in that generation and that our that anointing was poured out this is why that the word is not a letter the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life it must be the anointing of the word the presence of jesus christ upon that life and notice that anointing is poured out and then it moves and it flows from the head down through the body clear there to the garments clear down to the feet that's the presence of god upon the generation upon the people of god upon a church upon the families upon the homes are you with me you see god doesn't god doesn't work it in any other order you see then brother branham when he would take this in the message in the message wantness and he would deal with this and deal with the part of how that of family and things is to be won and brother bram says oneness itself it means to be one with or united and he's you know he says everything we do should be weighed by the word i think that's a very powerful thing because you know when you weigh things things can look right but when you weigh them they may not be right on is that right i mean you can look at two different balls and both of them say my goodness man they're the same but one of them might have a greater density than the other and when you weigh them or the bible says prove all things try is that right prove one is right there this is why brother branham when he's dealing with in in the choosing of a bride brother branham will take that of of character and he says it he say it of how that even in approaching of marriage or any of those things he said the man he said a person should study carefully for they could ruin their life is that right and he makes a statement just listening here to it this morning brother brown says character he says look for character first then love now you know character sometimes you can find a good person there's individuals brother branham when he preaches statue of a perfect man follows it with blasphemous names he takes those virtues that are laid out in ii peter and he said we know that there are people he said that they themselves have many of these virtues he said but the difference is is there is a nature given and there's one that is a spirit given and the spirit given is the one he said that we're talking about that's the one that has to come from god is that right so when we weigh things by the word now notice you know this is when we look at when you know we're looking at a home and we think of my you know what what our desire is you know i think of how brother braham says in in spoken words original seed and brother baby says if you want a church preach the word now he ain't just talking about a group of people but he's talking about a church one that that is filled with god what is really a life that's called out of the world and set aside with god preach the word and god the word itself will have an effect is that right so in order when we look at this here that every home itself that it should be place the word before anything else is that right i know we all agree on that now let's look here in genesis chapter 2 verse 15. very familiar passage here and i i'm just you know i'm not just speaking these things here to those of you who are married i'm speaking it to young people who are not married yet i'm speaking this to things you know i've got three or two young men and one on the way so there's a lot of things that that within this that for them these are certain things that they hear they hear all the time they had certain talks with daddy and they hear some of these things verse 15 and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it his responsibility now watch this and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eat is thereof thou shalt surely die and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him make a helpmate for him and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living thing that was the name thereof and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found and helped meet for him now i want you to notice eve's not even on the scene right now she's not on the scene god is speaking and giving his message to the man are you hearing me now god is speaking directly to adam and he's in charging adam this is the thing that the lord hath commanded this is what god has said so here god is delivering his word to adam and remember what is god's word it is his presence it is life so god is setting a pattern here that in order for there to be real honor in the home and let me just kind of step back just for a minute i know sometimes we're speaking in situations and i'll get there in coming services but not tonight of even how that when you have spouses that are not believing a god has laid it out within his word and all of these things so that there can still be that of a real honor that would be there even within the home brother branham would deal with it countless number of times peter dealt with it paul dealt with it and i still believe that god is the same god tonight god is the one that will just invite him if we want honor in our home then we need to invite almighty god on the scene it's like elijah when elijah stood there there on the mount carmel that day brother in order for the fire to fall he had to do things according to the word that had been revealed to him when he would respond and act according to the word then the fire would come he he put things in order according to the word is that right and the fire of god came there that day it's such a pattern it shows that in everything in our life in our homes we want the pillar of fire to come down we want god to be present then there is a water and it's according to his word it invites the presence of almighty god because you and i both know that a letter alone ain't enough it's got to be the presence of the living god because it takes him to come and give life to that word that that word would become flesh just like god would walk down in the garden of eden the bible says the presence of the lord came walking down that word had been given to the man you see adam had been abiding in the presence of almighty god he's secure in boundaries of the word that's been given the boundaries had been given within the word is that right and yet here eve was not even around at that time under now watch under under this authority abiding in the presence of god you see this is very important there's a reason has god even in that part of a delay that in this time he's preparing the man he's he's setting everything in a place the man is abiding in his presence he's giving him the word now god begins to bring animal life to him and ask him what will you call this and adam begins to name them it wasn't adam just thinking things up or adam just pulling things and saying i wonder this in the name means a character is that right and what adam was expressing was exactly what god's mind and god's heart was in the situation this was god laying out a pattern of where a man should be even leading into that of a husband and where a husband is to be in order to bring honor in the home that that man is so close to god living in the presence of god there is spiritual discernment about his life to be able to catch things and be able to pick them up and be able to pull this out and pull that out let me tell you something that doesn't come outside of the word and the word itself i ain't just talking about quotes the word is the very person of jesus christ are you with me i'm not just talking about being around the message i'm talking about being in the word there's a difference in being around the message and saying i believe the word and being in the word to be in the word is to be baptized in by the holy ghost is that right you are now in the safety in the boundaries of god's word oh my he began to discern the characteristics why because as a husband is to discern characteristics it's to sit there when things are coming not go by their feelings but god holds a responsibility because sometimes maybe a wife would say well what about this and i feel this way she's works on a higher emotional level it's true i mean it's true so here is gotta be a word that's there there's gonna be a standard that's there now i want you to look at this here with the presence of god let me just read a few scriptures first first chronicles 16 25 for great is the lord and greatly to be praised he also is to be feared above all gods for all the gods of the people are idols but the lord made the heavens glory and honor are in his presence strength and gladness are in his place this is where what is there in his presence glory and honor in psalms 37 23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way psalms 112 1 blessed is the man that feareth the lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments his seed shall be mighty upon the earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endureth forever notice all of this comes out of from a man who greatly delights in the commandments of god oh my it takes a whole lot more to make a home than just a man and a woman are you with me in order for it to really be a home and really be a marriage it's got to be a life that is established upon the word of almighty god oh my think of this now in psalm 16. notice here that david let me just skip to verse 11 thou wilt show me the path of life and in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forever more i mean who wouldn't want to be in the presence of god you see this is the responsibility of even of the man of the husband to where he's living in the presence of god and now it comes into a place eve's not even on the scene yet but you see he's already living in the presence of god there's a place that he's dwelling oh my it's not just important that he might have a place to take her but there should be one place that is more upset above everything else and that is to invite her into the presence of god that is upon his own life oh my can you say amen oh my this is where very important david think of how david when david would pray here the bible said david in first chronicles 29 10 david blessed the lord before all the congregation and david said blessed be thou lord god of israel our father forever and ever thine o lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine that is the kingdom o lord and thou art exalted as head above all both riches and honor come of thee and thou reignest over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thy hand is to make great and to give strength unto all so the presence of god of the living god now has made a way adam has has come into this place and now here the bible goes on to say now in verse 21 of genesis 2 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man notice god's order the man has been in the presence of god now when it's time god deals with he lays the man to sleep and god brings then that woman that he has prepared for adam to adam is that right and adam said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh you know brother adam you'll hear him make this statement in invisible union marriage itself being the oldest institution in the bible or the oldest institution it's instituted by god when god married the first couple let me just read here just a little bit brother branham as he's given these vows these are the same things that we we would read as ministers and brother adam and i'm just going to read the part there to the groom he said well you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife to live together in this holy state of matrimony do you promise to honor and love and cherish in sickness and health riches or poverty and will forsake all others and cleave the only unto her as long as you both live thinking of this in this manner because in every situation no matter what it is to love to honor and to cherish in the good times and in the bad times in the times of trial and in the times when there ain't no trial right it is it is companions it is that of a union that that god has brought together these are where things that you know there's testing times that come there's testings within in marriage and my goodness you know you you're two different people i don't care if you both are filled with the holy ghost you're two different people and the other thing that's very different i know not in this generation but it's very different the bible said god hath made a male and female sorry i don't think like a female my wife don't think like a male thank god be with me you see there's a different thought process there's different thinkings about things sometimes you know with with men sometimes we can tend to be a little bit more gruffer here there and and the woman team seems to be maybe a little bit more dainty you know with things and how she'll go about things you know and maybe you know they fall and get a cut and you know dad said get on in there and wash it out and put some you know peroxide on it mom said come here let me let me see that oh my look at hey honey you seen this you look at it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah hey go go and get the peroxide on and put a band-aid there they're right in there something you know i'm talking about [Laughter] so there's there's differences a lot of differences you know there's a lot of differences but all those things are apart and and they're all necessary they're all complementary just like among the body when god had every one of the tribes in israel you know if you brought every one of those heads together they would look at things differently you could take the same problem and they would all look at it a little differently they would come from a certain perspective of what was laying within their character god has things that way just for a reason now you know when brother batman goes through this here and he's dealing with this perfect harmony and i want to just i want to read this here out of the message oneness brother brad talks about he says this first man and first woman in the garden of eden was in perfect harmony with god so much that god could come down at any time he desired and talked lip to ear with adam and eve isn't that wonderful it was in that place now you might say well brother samuel it's just me it's just me that's in contact with god it's just me that has that oneness with god where his life is dwelling within me then you know what god's got a conduit a channel a place that your life you said no matter what's going on my life is reserved for a place if it hadn't been for me god wouldn't come to this home but because i'm here it's a channel for god to come down any time he was in such harmony god could just he could just come down at any time and just talk to him lip to hear what a fellowship notice he says that's perfect oneness god and his creation god speaking lip to ear with adam and eve and they were so perfect in harmony with god till they were one with god and god and his family was one and man in his family a correct good noble obedient family is one with another any family if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere they should all be one father with mother mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture that's god's desire is that that agreement that father with mother mother with father and and then as he says children now you and i all we know know that but that's not just something that somebody just waves the one and my we just all are in agreement it's like when i was teaching you okay now you tell someone so you're sorry you tell someone so you're sorry and this and that and one more you knew turn your back and put them on the playground they'll be fighting and fussing again right it's back to the same thing because just in that event that thing like that it don't resolve anything but in order for there to be an agreement come about don't want it for there to be agreement there's got to be concessions is that right there's got to be submitting that's and that's how the word works in our life the word doesn't come in our life and grab us you know in a headlock and god says now i'm your husband and this is what you're going to do god doesn't operate like that he operates over the church of the living god by his love by his spirit and that's how god brings you and i into harmony with what he desires in our life let me just say this to you god sometimes will deal with your life a week or weeks ahead of time to get your heart and everything ready for when the word will come forth here and god might bring correction in your life but god knows what's needed in order for you to receive it that's how attentive god is he loves to come down and talk with his children and there is an agreement that god likes to have a unity now the one thing we don't can we do not there's no concessions on the word are you with me we're not talking about concessions on the word the word is the standard we hold that of the word but i want you to remember the word itself just what we're preaching here the word is a display even in the home and in the lives this is why that even in the midst of it of how peter would write of it paul would write of it of even the testimony that would be present in the life of a husband in the life of a wife so much that titus himself would write of how things and the conduct would be and he would write it in this manner that the word of god be not blasphemed why because we recognize there's such a reality that god desires for our heart to be in agreement and to express his word i'm glad that god is mindful of our needs i'm glad that god desires that things would operate in agreement in our lives aren't you this is god's desire for our lives now let's look here he says that's god's purpose and his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family earthly family adam and eve and the only way they could be one with the family or with god was because god's nature was in them so that made them with god's nature in them then with each other and god they become all one well he said isn't that a beautiful picture god in his family father over all supreme no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never to have a heartache just one with god what a picture because the very nature of god was in those people and therefore what they did they followed just in line with god and god with them made them one god was invited in god think of this how adam adam dwelling in the presence of almighty god then here eve comes in of just the atmosphere that that that was there within that of the garden of eden how god had set all of that place you know when we look at this here you find that in in the scripture of how noah and let me just i'll just close on this one here the bible says in hebrews 11 verse 7 by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear and prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith once again just as god spoke to noah you find god speaks to abraham god speaks god delivers his word in that manner that here of what is taking place and then through that word that has come how that that noah in himself would be would be moved by the spirit of god to think here with his children and his family everything that was going on how it had an effect upon the whole household you see there wasn't things that no doubt there might be times that we could go back where you know noah might have had to say this to his son or say this or say that but you see there was an effect what was the effect that was in his life it was the presence of god that at times that even when his children or his family maybe they couldn't see everything but you see there was an effect of the presence of god that was within his life that it had an effect there in that home it was it brought honor that was there it brought on or invited the presence of god to come in there there was an honor that was between one another and it invited god's presence to come down you see when we look at this here in the word this is why when you look at how in the scriptures when it says when the holy ghost when he has come the spirit of truth he will lead and guide us into all truth is that right he leads us into all truth and you saw god god never he never intended anything outside of his spirit of his life to lead the church of the living god when things came in in the garden that was wrong and notice notice how the enemy came the enemy he did not come to adam he came to the woman is that right hey let's just look at it now as an entire bride of jesus christ where does the enemy he comes to try to tempt you he comes to try to say things against you he comes to try to bring all kinds of accusations is that right because the real man on the inside cannot be tempted the real man on the inside the real son and daughter of god is an overcomer born by that overcoming life amen is that right but you see god never intended for the woman to lead god intended for the man to lead god intended that's why even when we look at the very simple things of the marriage covenant who's the first one that enters the door the man comes in because he is the initiator are you with me it follows the same pattern that was there i'm talking about honor bringing honor in the home honor begins with the word the presence of god because just like david we read here in the scriptures glory and honor riches all everything joy it comes from the presence of god direction it comes from the presence of god it's the word of god it it's not something in our homes that we look for a different way how do i handle this problem we realize problems in every situation is to be handled by the word is that right sometimes it's not altogether a scripture that you can find it's the character of our life of how to handle that my goodness i'm just going to stop here there's just too much i can't i can't lay more of this in here but god intended god intended for the man and i know sometimes we look and say brother samuel you preach on the men an awful lot i'm don't worry we'll get we'll come on down but you see it's very important it's very important because in this in this hour i'm at my face i can put my glasses on so i can see you in this hour in this time we're living in it's hard to find men and i'm not just talking about somebody who you know prefers women i'm talking about a man sorry to speak so straight but i've got to speak straight it's hard to find a man that would that stands up and takes responsibility come on it's a man that is making preparations for life instead in this day and age that we live in this is very much scripture instead in this day and age we live in you find many times where men and there and here they are men and they can be ever so old and they're still boys it's a time of responsibility to take responsibility for things to to to make room for things that even that are coming in because it doesn't just happen with a light switch overnight things just don't take place overnight but it's making preparation it's laying all those things just as brother branham would tell us about he said we don't know how long god will tarry and he speaks to the fathers and the husbands and he says we must make arrangements for our children that are coming on because it's such a it's such an hour you and i know in this hour let me just tell you something you already know this we're out here the things that are even have been in our schools things that are coming into our schools and a lot of these things they want taught and everything else that's out there i tell you there has to be a standard that's in the home you cannot allow the schools to raise your children you can't allow those things it's got to be a presence that's right there that raises them up that lets them know this is what a man is this is what a real lady is it's honor in the home invites the presence of god invites him into the home amen i know that wasn't shouting from the rooftops but i it's okay sometimes there's things that's needed and correction i never get excited when i have to correct my own kids but they'll look at it
