[39:41] begin to meditate and think on him he
[39:45] says you begin to think on him and he
[39:47] let us know there's a lot of things that
[39:49] we can think about that our cares of
[39:51] this life and we do have to think about
[39:52] him but don't let him be the meditation
[39:55] think about it do it
[39:58] but then entertaining him and then he
[40:00] draws near ain't that wonderful it's so
[40:04] wonderful I want to before I read the
[40:06] scriptures here I want to thank the
[40:09] Sunday school kids and I got back from
[40:12] my trip had a lot of drawings there and
[40:15] a lot of letters of encouragement and I
[40:18] really appreciate that so much
[40:20] if any of the rest of you adults try to
[40:23] draw a drawing well we won't say nothing
[40:29] else but I really appreciate that and
[40:33] those are things and I just tuck away it
[40:36] just really means a lot
[40:38] amen Colossians 1 verse 12 giving thanks
[40:45] unto the Father which hath made us meet
[40:49] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[40:53] the Saints in light
[40:54] who have delivered us from the power of
[40:58] darkness and hath translated us into the
[41:02] kingdom of his dear son so we were under
[41:08] another ruling power at one time but
[41:13] when we have been delivered from that
[41:16] and then translated in to once we're
[41:19] delivered and then translated into the
[41:22] real you the real me can begin to be
[41:26] expressed in whom we have redemption
[41:31] through his blood even the forgiveness
[41:33] of sins
[41:34] who is the image of the invisible God
[41:38] the firstborn of every creature for by
[41:42] him we're all things created that are in
[41:46] heaven and that are in earth visible and
[41:49] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[41:52] dominions or principalities or powers
[41:55] all things were created by him and for
[41:59] him and he is before all things and by
[42:03] him all things consist
[42:06] amen god bless you we'll let you be
[42:08] seated here and like to keep on reading
[42:10] here just a moment in verse 18 there and
[42:16] he is the head of the body the church
[42:22] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[42:26] the dead that in all things he might
[42:30] have the preeminence to see how that he
[42:35] has gained this preeminence and I want
[42:38] you just to think of this and let this
[42:40] just stay with you just for throughout
[42:43] the service and then in the next that
[42:46] Rite of preeminence in the midst of our
[42:51] life belong to him but there's a way
[42:56] that he came to take his throne he did
[43:01] not take his throne and has not taken
[43:03] his throne in your life nor will he any
[43:06] under sound of my voice he will
[43:08] take it by force but he comes and he
[43:14] wins this battle by divine love because
[43:19] God's desire preeminence is not just
[43:23] where we as a person are doing those
[43:26] things which are right but it's where
[43:29] righteousness itself is reigning on the
[43:31] inside and it is not only the actions
[43:35] that we're doing but in every aspect of
[43:38] our life he is preeminent he's the
[43:41] preeminent one in our thoughts he is the
[43:45] center just like in a garden many of the
[43:50] times some of the gardens we have in in
[43:51] the parks and things like that and I
[43:53] think of that beautiful rose garden over
[43:54] there by the lake I'm glad that's close
[43:56] to me you go up through that rose garden
[43:59] that they have set up with all the
[44:00] different roses but there is a center
[44:02] most part and all the rest of it is just
[44:06] filler all of the paths in that garden
[44:10] point to one main focus so when a garden
[44:14] is being developed everything else the
[44:17] flowers are beautiful all those things
[44:19] are wonderful but all of those point to
[44:22] a focus that he who planted the garden
[44:24] wants the focus to be on that which is
[44:27] the center of all those things so we
[44:32] recognize that that is God's desire is
[44:34] that he would be the center of our lives
[44:37] and of our hearts and so as we keep that
[44:40] in mind to gain this preeminence that
[44:42] which is chief that which is first place
[44:44] he does not take this by force but it is
[44:49] by divine love verse 19 it said for it
[44:54] pleased the father that in him should
[44:57] all fullness dwell and having made peace
[45:00] through the blood of his cross by him to
[45:06] reconcile all things unto himself by him
[45:11] I say whether they be things in earth or
[45:15] things in heaven so when the purchase
[45:20] was made there at Calvary there was a
[45:25] reconciling that took place in in that
[45:30] where the debt itself was settled where
[45:35] that those who were gathered by the
[45:38] Spirit of God in looking forward for the
[45:41] Lamb that was to come all of those who
[45:45] died under that in the elect and were
[45:48] waiting for the fulfillment of this word
[45:51] they themselves we know that the
[45:54] scripture says that they were waiting in
[45:56] paradise but when he descends down there
[45:59] in paradise after the payment has been
[46:02] made
[46:02] he himself after the depositing of sins
[46:05] holds the authority then to loosen them
[46:09] paradise itself is done away with and
[46:13] those that as they were held in paradise
[46:16] now in his ascension they themselves are
[46:20] as they have been placed already in what
[46:23] what has been revealed to them now has
[46:26] become substance now and here they are
[46:29] being transported they are ascending up
[46:32] with him their sacrifice that they were
[46:37] looking forward to by eyes of Revelation
[46:41] and now here what has been revealed has
[46:45] now become substance and it is now
[46:48] lifting them out of the very hold of
[46:52] paradise and when we look at it to think
[46:57] of how brother Branham will tell with
[46:59] this particular scripture and he'll make
[47:01] a statement and stop there and I'm not
[47:03] going to dwell on this today but he'll
[47:05] stop when reading this for a text and he
[47:07] says look where that reconciliation goes
[47:12] because the reconciliation does not stop
[47:16] here in time it's not just us where
[47:19] there is a uniting to where there is a
[47:22] change within our nature but there is a
[47:25] complete salvation which is the matching
[47:29] of the body with what God has done on
[47:32] the inside
[47:34] and to wear that there is a complete
[47:36] reconciling to that of our our new home
[47:39] this is our this is our promised land
[47:42] that we see coming into sight and this
[47:45] is where we are dwelling as Joshua and
[47:48] Caleb stood there and notice as Brillion
[47:51] will place it Joshua and Caleb standing
[47:53] there he says as we see our Promised
[47:56] Land coming inside
[47:58] what is our promised land our promised
[48:00] land is not just that of the baptism of
[48:03] the Holy Ghost yet that is the token in
[48:06] the fullness in this hour but it is that
[48:09] to where we can look in my father's
[48:11] house are many mansions and if I go away
[48:15] to prepare a place for you I will come
[48:18] again so his coming I will come again
[48:22] and receive you unto myself so well the
[48:28] world is looking for a coming for him to
[48:30] step out on the clouds his coming is
[48:34] secret his coming has come in you and I
[48:39] when his life is coming you and I that
[48:43] this is the bride coming the coming of
[48:46] the Lord its Christ coming in his body
[48:49] that he has been building through the
[48:53] ages so then we begin to see where we're
[48:58] at
[48:58] even in time and why that even when
[49:02] we're looking at the seals we're looking
[49:04] at the word we realize it's not it's not
[49:07] adding something new but it's bringing
[49:09] to light what is always late here and
[49:13] when God begins to take what's always
[49:15] late here there is power and authority
[49:18] within this word when Christ himself
[49:21] gets a hold of it to be able to loosen
[49:24] you and I to be able to cleanse you and
[49:27] I and to be able to fill us and equip us
[49:31] to where our life is a reflection of
[49:35] what has been wrote god bless you god
[49:39] see brother brother Williams uncle god
[49:41] bless you sir god bless you appreciate
[49:43] having you here amen wonderful
[49:46] amen here we stand there's a need in
[49:51] this hour what God God made a promise
[49:54] back in Genesis 3 after the fall had
[49:57] taken place and he says to that he says
[50:01] of the woman thy seed shall bruise the
[50:05] head of the serpent and he said I'll put
[50:08] enmity between these two seeds we know
[50:11] that the woman has no seed the woman is
[50:14] a field was that right she is a garden
[50:17] and but yet within it so for her to have
[50:20] a seed it would have to be God himself
[50:22] that would give her a sea but yet this
[50:26] he could not just give her a seed and
[50:29] her supply the egg but it must be God
[50:32] himself coming down and become one of us
[50:36] it had to be a kinsman redeemer it had
[50:40] to be one who was born and the other
[50:43] human race one who where there would be
[50:45] a blood that was not a polluted blood it
[50:48] was had to be one to wear that Satan
[50:51] couldn't could not put any claim upon
[50:53] his life so there had to be one who was
[50:56] made in the likeness of sinful flesh but
[50:59] yet in his nature I want you to listen
[51:01] to me now in his nature
[51:03] there was nothing sinful about his
[51:06] nature Oh glory be to God this
[51:09] requirement was made for the virgin
[51:12] birth it was made and you know brother
[51:15] man we'll take it like this in the
[51:16] message of reach he said God will put
[51:19] requirements on my we could just spend
[51:21] months on this statement right here he
[51:23] said God will make a requirement he said
[51:26] and then there's nothing you can do
[51:27] about it it's all left up left up to God
[51:32] to fulfill that promise no matter how
[51:35] righteous or how holy or any of them
[51:38] were within the Old Testament and by the
[51:40] way any holiness or any righteousness
[51:43] that could be attributed to them was not
[51:46] because of their mere status or their
[51:48] genes within the natural but it was
[51:51] because a holy God had spoke through
[51:53] their hearts a righteous God had moved
[51:55] upon their life
[51:56] there's no sir
[51:57] as a holy mountain it's a mountain where
[52:00] a holy God comes down is that right so
[52:03] here we find that there's not one of
[52:04] them that could produce what was needed
[52:06] but yet their lives only pointed and was
[52:10] only testifying there's going to be a
[52:11] ram come on this mountain come on
[52:14] somebody their lives was pointing and
[52:16] testifying there's one who's going to
[52:18] come and they were all searching and
[52:20] they were waiting around they were
[52:22] looking but here God Himself is the only
[52:24] one that could produce this kind of a
[52:27] sinless character this kind of a sinless
[52:30] nature and God had a reason there's a
[52:33] there's a reason of how that His grace
[52:35] stepped in to overshadow that law and I
[52:39] began to look at this here when I just
[52:41] thinking you know and in this whole
[52:43] thought of reconciliation mind I'll tell
[52:45] you for some time it's just been so
[52:47] permeated and percolating on my heart
[52:49] and I began to look at it of how that we
[52:52] were starting in this last week or a few
[52:54] weeks ago and you know you find of how
[52:57] that the Lord Jesus himself here God
[52:59] found in sending because the Lord Jesus
[53:02] is not a second person he's not someone
[53:05] separate and you might say what little
[53:07] Sammy we already know that but you know
[53:09] there might be some that don't and I
[53:10] believe what needs to be emphasized and
[53:12] to recognize that it is no one other
[53:15] that has redeemed us but God himself
[53:19] coming down and becoming one of us and
[53:22] what if he's redeeming he's redeeming
[53:25] what belongs to him what belongs to him
[53:28] God's sons and daughters of God we are
[53:32] ships off that diamond we are parts of
[53:35] that masterpiece but we ourselves do not
[53:38] have within ourselves the ability to
[53:40] redeem but that little chip that's off
[53:43] the masterpiece when it begins to strike
[53:45] and everything begins to line up there
[53:48] is an expression of the word that can be
[53:51] played from the buckin sail like this
[53:53] from the vinyl of our soul that will
[53:56] actually begin to pick up the song of
[53:59] redemption
[54:00] the sounding it begins to play it out
[54:02] that little that little chip off the
[54:05] diamond begins to reflect the great
[54:07] diamond himself so to think of this of
[54:11] that the Lord Jesus himself coming down
[54:14] and becoming one of us I look at this in
[54:16] Philippians 2 verse 7 and this is a just
[54:20] a to me just an astounding thing that's
[54:23] just so gripped my heart he made himself
[54:26] of no reputation
[54:34] you know how brother Bram talks about he
[54:36] said the guy who invented false teeth
[54:38] made himself a reputation the guy who
[54:41] made a prosthetic leg he said they he
[54:44] put his name on it he made himself of no
[54:47] reputation when they tried to pull him
[54:50] out tried to get him to present himself
[54:53] and show himself even from after the
[54:56] temptation on the Mount clear to where
[54:58] it came amongst his brethren in John
[55:01] seven he made himself of no reputation
[55:11] this scriptures wound so tight that the
[55:15] very purpose of God I want you to
[55:18] understand because this pertains to you
[55:20] and I it shows the prevailing power of
[55:24] the very purpose and mystery of Christ
[55:27] working in our life but let me tell you
[55:30] something that it is God's prevailing
[55:33] power moving upon that which has already
[55:37] been wrote in our life that cannot be
[55:41] defeated because that is God and let me
[55:44] tell you something it's by that strain
[55:46] of predestination whereby the flow of
[55:50] redemption moves down and it is Christ
[55:53] himself
[55:54] raising up his own sons and daughters of
[55:57] God to where that the characteristics
[56:00] that are spoken the word of Christ to be
[56:03] manifests in this hour are reflected in
[56:06] the hearts and lives of the believer and
[56:08] you can't help but reflect it you can't
[56:13] help but reflect it just like the
[56:16] natural genes of your parents you can't
[56:18] help that I mean you know unless you
[56:22] want to be like some peoples lived and
[56:23] had a thousand nose job
[56:24] and everything else but the jeans are
[56:27] still there they're still there they're
[56:33] still there certain things you'll catch
[56:36] yourself and you'll think man I'm
[56:37] starting to act like dad about this
[56:40] I find myself that even this year I find
[56:44] myself and I catch myself and I just
[56:46] smile oh lordy you know my dad's already
[56:49] go over on the other side but Here I am
[56:51] these jeans keep coming and some of the
[56:55] things brother Dominic you know how it
[56:56] is there's some of things I used to pick
[56:57] with him about he's here you can say you
[57:02] remember but it's a prevailing of those
[57:08] characteristics that have laid in our
[57:11] lives
[57:11] house let's look at this here just for a
[57:13] little bit this morning and he took upon
[57:16] him the form of a servant and was made
[57:21] in the likeness of men being found in
[57:27] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[57:32] became obedient unto death even the
[57:37] death of the cross that's a very that's
[57:42] a very important statement he became
[57:44] obedient unto death we look many times
[57:49] just at the cross but remember before
[57:53] the cross was gasps M&E and in all
[57:58] aspects of his life he was tempted he
[58:03] was tested the Bible says this in all
[58:06] points such as we are he was tempted to
[58:09] be drawn to the tomb of Lazarus before
[58:11] it was time but God here was he was he
[58:15] was reserved to the will of the Father
[58:18] you know this is the thing when Jesus
[58:20] was speaking about rest he was speaking
[58:23] about that place for you and I to enter
[58:26] into to
[58:27] as we enter into through the atmosphere
[58:31] of that life not only permeating in our
[58:34] souls but also dwelling there it would
[58:37] bring you and I into a place of rest
[58:40] because the truth be known there's many
[58:43] times we are too strong there's many
[58:46] times where there's and see that here's
[58:48] God working the whole time and we don't
[58:51] have time to cover all this the God will
[58:53] work many times and he's moving in our
[58:55] lives even now to bring you and I into a
[58:58] place of greater trust to where that
[59:02] we're trusting it's he doesn't want us
[59:05] to submit to him out of fear he does not
[59:08] want that he wants submission he had
[59:13] brought me to his banqueting table and
[59:16] his standard his banner all for me is
[59:21] love my mouth we could go on with that
[59:26] but his love that's the standard this is
[59:29] the part he wants our hearts be brought
[59:32] in submission so he humbles himself this
[59:35] was not something that was just a given
[59:37] but I want you to notice here has the
[59:40] word is continually coming and being
[59:43] unfolded in his life he was always the
[59:46] word is that right but here we find that
[59:48] we're the word itself
[59:50] now the word the promises are quickened
[59:53] to him after he comes up out of the
[59:55] River Jordan and those promises being
[59:58] quickened to him here he is in his life
[1:00:01] every day is a life of humility now let
[1:00:06] me just say this to you and let's just
[1:00:07] leave this right out clearly a person
[1:00:09] can be ever so humble and you can see a
[1:00:11] person and say they're humble but that
[1:00:13] don't mean that they got the Holy Ghost
[1:00:15] there's a lot of good humble people but
[1:00:18] remember Cain was humble are you with me
[1:00:21] there's many people that have the Verte
[1:00:24] that have all of those virtues in the
[1:00:26] natural in their life and yet not capped
[1:00:29] are you with me so what is it it's a
[1:00:32] humility to the word it's a humility to
[1:00:37] Christ
[1:00:40] amen in the message desperation the
[1:00:43] Prophet said to take our shoes off will
[1:00:46] not be good enough he said but humility
[1:00:50] is a life that will bring forth the
[1:00:53] fruits of the spirit so it must be his
[1:00:58] fruit in his season it must be the fruit
[1:01:02] of his life coming forth in our life
[1:01:06] whereby that that is a testimony the
[1:01:09] fruit is a testimony of the life in the
[1:01:13] vine glory be to God but he became
[1:01:19] obedient this scripture it shows of even
[1:01:24] the the the warfare that went on between
[1:01:27] his will and God's will you know what
[1:01:33] I'm talking about as the Prophet lays
[1:01:36] the statement like this in the church
[1:01:38] age book here he is he said contending
[1:01:40] with himself who do you contend with
[1:01:45] beside me do you want me to start naming
[1:01:47] names no well you don't know so-and-so
[1:01:50] yeah but but really is it so-and-so or
[1:01:53] is it how so-and-so is or what so-and-so
[1:01:57] does that raises up something different
[1:02:02] in you to where then it brings you to a
[1:02:06] place to say Lord I don't want this in
[1:02:08] my life what are you doing contending
[1:02:13] with yourself and by standing on that
[1:02:16] and say this temple is reserved for my
[1:02:20] lord you're contending with yourself and
[1:02:25] at the same time you are humbling
[1:02:28] yourself and becoming obedient unto
[1:02:31] death because the Holy Ghost in your
[1:02:34] life it makes the word empower it brings
[1:02:39] the word from a letter a letter killeth
[1:02:42] but the Spirit gives life it brings it
[1:02:45] from a letter and giveth it power in
[1:02:47] your life you became obedient unto death
[1:02:52] what was looked at here within the
[1:02:55] garden of gethsemane here's a garden and
[1:03:03] I some of this was a little bit over
[1:03:05] from where we were at the last time but
[1:03:06] I want you to catch this here he was in
[1:03:09] the midst of a garden there was a fall
[1:03:12] in the garden back there but here in
[1:03:17] this time he comes to the garden and
[1:03:20] notice he leaves the disciples back here
[1:03:22] he says watch and pray that ye enter not
[1:03:26] into temptation he himself knows a
[1:03:28] little part from them and he begins to
[1:03:31] pray here is now where a great
[1:03:33] conference is to be set in in this
[1:03:36] conference there is a Specter spectators
[1:03:39] that show up much like it did for Samson
[1:03:41] when Samson was in the midst of
[1:03:44] everything Samson's strength he was able
[1:03:47] by his strength to slay many of the
[1:03:50] Philistines but it was when Samson came
[1:03:53] to a place after he had already been
[1:03:55] taken captive he was led by a little
[1:03:57] child to a place and he said lead me to
[1:04:00] the place upon which this temple rest
[1:04:03] you see God comes to the very root of
[1:04:06] the problem and here he leads him right
[1:04:09] to where you see the child knew where
[1:04:12] this simple place was it ain't something
[1:04:14] deep it's very simple
[1:04:16] God hides in simplicity but then he
[1:04:19] reveals himself in the same here here is
[1:04:21] Samson standing here in the midst of it
[1:04:23] you see what it was his heart to Delilah
[1:04:26] brought him in bondage but when it wind
[1:04:29] sensing himself was always a part of the
[1:04:32] Covenant and as he was there in bondage
[1:04:35] and under creeds and under dogmas and he
[1:04:38] was turning out meal and everything
[1:04:40] under the enemy's camp but but there
[1:04:42] began to grow out the seven locks and
[1:04:44] those that locks that hair that was upon
[1:04:47] me there he began to think and remember
[1:04:49] there's a covenant about my life oh my
[1:04:52] Samson was aware that there was a
[1:04:55] covenant and there was no Philistine
[1:04:57] that could strip that covenant away from
[1:05:00] him let me tell you something I don't
[1:05:02] care how far you've gone
[1:05:04] Carol deep you feel you are there is
[1:05:06] nothing that can strip away that
[1:05:09] covenant that God himself has made with
[1:05:12] you before the foundation of the world
[1:05:16] hallelujah
[1:05:17] Samson standing there in that time and
[1:05:20] here in the midst of this time in this
[1:05:22] hour he defeated more Philistines in his
[1:05:27] death than he ever did what he was alive
[1:05:30] what was it it was death that brought
[1:05:34] the victory his many surrendering all of
[1:05:41] this but notice when all of a sudden
[1:05:43] they began to think back here the God
[1:05:45] who made the Covenant begin to move upon
[1:05:48] his body and Samson was led to that
[1:05:52] place and then that midst of that time
[1:05:54] death itself
[1:05:56] it brought a defeat within that hour oh
[1:05:59] that's the same way it was with our Lord
[1:06:02] Jesus Christ here he is and disseminate
[1:06:05] there is a conference that's been called
[1:06:07] as Samson stood in that arena in this
[1:06:10] very garden right here every demon out
[1:06:13] of hell was gathered around they were
[1:06:15] filling all the seats they had it
[1:06:17] nosebleed seats they had front-row seats
[1:06:20] they had ten yard line seeds they had
[1:06:22] all of these seats all around and in the
[1:06:24] midst of it there was a conference going
[1:06:27] on and how that God Himself he turns
[1:06:30] around the Father he said are you
[1:06:31] willing to go through with it are you
[1:06:33] willing to go ahead are you willing to
[1:06:35] go to Calvary because he could not make
[1:06:37] him do he had to go willingly
[1:06:45] he couldn't be forced he couldn't be
[1:06:47] drugged Abel led his lamb he had to pull
[1:06:53] his lamb but this lamb this lamb didn't
[1:06:57] have to be pulled this lamb was going to
[1:07:00] be led to the slaughter they were not
[1:07:04] going to be led with fetters of man but
[1:07:07] this lamb was going to be led to the
[1:07:09] slaughter by the same doubt that had
[1:07:11] come down and raised up that word on the
[1:07:14] inside and that same dove that is sought
[1:07:19] you out that same doubt that's leading
[1:07:21] you is the same dog that will lead you
[1:07:24] and me into the rapture that same dog of
[1:07:29] the Holy Ghost what's he doing he's
[1:07:34] leading us to that face blessed be his
[1:07:43] name your love him this morning he
[1:07:48] became obedient unto death even the
[1:07:51] death of the cross he already died
[1:07:55] before he ever went to Calvary he
[1:08:04] already died before he went to Calvary
[1:08:07] but he he still was walking around life
[1:08:11] but he already died to his will he
[1:08:18] already died to his will but yet that's
[1:08:22] something that was taking place in
[1:08:24] secret see this was the third pull of
[1:08:28] his ministry he had been praying in
[1:08:32] secret come on somebody and what he had
[1:08:35] been praying about and what was now
[1:08:37] happening on the inside that was about
[1:08:39] to be manifested he reward thee openly
[1:08:44] this is a crowning of the ministry right
[1:08:46] here are you as me he already became
[1:08:50] obedient unto death that same principle
[1:08:53] friends this same principle is the same
[1:08:55] thing that applies to our lives across
[1:08:59] the board on everything it applies to
[1:09:00] our life in order for you and I to have
[1:09:04] been born again we first had to die and
[1:09:10] that's what I want to deal with a little
[1:09:12] bit no death no resurrection if there's
[1:09:17] no death there's no resurrection let me
[1:09:20] just set the stage very clearly body
[1:09:22] resurrecting
[1:09:24] the man who dies he's resurrecting the
[1:09:28] man who was dead but was alive before
[1:09:38] but it's in submission though it's in
[1:09:40] submission so all of this this pertains
[1:09:43] to all of us on everything everything
[1:09:46] that involves the assembly everything
[1:09:48] that involves our family everything that
[1:09:50] involves in the workplace listen we're
[1:09:53] not handling things you handle things
[1:09:54] out here first you can get in trouble
[1:09:57] handle it here first
[1:10:02] so even when brother Brandon water was
[1:10:05] made known to him of that trap that
[1:10:08] Satan was laying for him even God making
[1:10:13] that known to him the Prophet didn't
[1:10:15] take it lightly
[1:10:16] he prayed about that he didn't know when
[1:10:20] it was going to be he didn't know but
[1:10:23] then after it was taken place then God
[1:10:27] made it known this was that trap now
[1:10:30] look at this those young people and how
[1:10:33] that they were acting in that service
[1:10:34] that was totally inappropriate is that
[1:10:38] right but notice how the Prophet moved
[1:10:41] within that time and what he spoke
[1:10:43] within that notice the grace of God
[1:10:45] maybe they had never heard anything like
[1:10:47] this before you understand no doubt
[1:10:50] about it there's no maybe that something
[1:10:52] they had never even heard before but
[1:10:53] notice God's grace come down because at
[1:10:56] the same time how many was standing
[1:10:59] there when there would be prayer lines
[1:11:01] taking place and things going on and yet
[1:11:03] many was standing there even ministers
[1:11:06] that would not put their head down when
[1:11:08] that when the Holy Spirit was right
[1:11:10] there discerning those diseases and
[1:11:12] calling them out the Prophet himself
[1:11:15] could not even stand in the way of that
[1:11:17] he said because you would not bow your
[1:11:19] head now you have those disease and that
[1:11:22] ministry noticed the ministry and all
[1:11:24] that were under it notice they fell
[1:11:26] under that is that right it it shows
[1:11:30] within it in the midst of it within our
[1:11:32] hearts
[1:11:33] must in our hearts be reconciled unto
[1:11:37] God and in our hearts we must be
[1:11:41] reconciled it's just like if there's any
[1:11:44] any division in your home before words
[1:11:48] can come there's got to be a
[1:11:50] reconciliation on the inside are you
[1:11:54] with me this quote I love this quote God
[1:12:02] hiding in himself in simplicity he says
[1:12:05] now he hid his self in the death of
[1:12:08] Christ but manifested himself in the
[1:12:13] resurrection there had to be a death
[1:12:17] according to the will of God according
[1:12:22] to the will of God it was not all age
[1:12:25] were not so fast you with me
[1:12:28] old age wouldn't do it well he was the
[1:12:30] lamb but he had to be offered willingly
[1:12:33] had to be the lamb all the types full of
[1:12:38] an innocent one it had to be one that
[1:12:42] would offer his life so it had to be
[1:12:46] according to the will of God if he had
[1:12:48] to offer up according to the will of God
[1:12:50] in order to pay the debt and the price
[1:12:53] then there is also where we must come
[1:12:56] according to the will of God in order to
[1:12:59] be recognized and reconciled by his
[1:13:03] death hallelujah so there had to be
[1:13:09] there had to be the rejection had to be
[1:13:11] the death had to be the suffering
[1:13:14] everything I want you to catch he must
[1:13:16] willingly surrender his life listen now
[1:13:19] to the satisfying of the father to the
[1:13:25] satisfying of the father men could watch
[1:13:28] as he walked standing there in Pilot
[1:13:31] Sport that could watch as he walked down
[1:13:32] the way to Calvary men could watch the
[1:13:37] Prophet speaks to us of even how that
[1:13:39] Satan himself he said he said was
[1:13:42] looking at him at that time it said this
[1:13:43] just can't be the Son of God
[1:13:45] son of God wouldn't put up with this but
[1:13:49] brother BAM said sons of God will put up
[1:13:52] as long as they know they're doing the
[1:13:55] will of God you see what gives you
[1:13:58] authority it's not I'm not going to say
[1:14:00] it's being focused on his will if you
[1:14:04] get your eyes off of him and off of his
[1:14:06] will your mouth will start going Oh Lord
[1:14:12] pastor got back in town but his will
[1:14:19] this is where the Prophet could say many
[1:14:21] places identification he said that the
[1:14:24] Lord Jesus himself never paid any
[1:14:27] attention to the criticism it was all
[1:14:32] around me it didn't cease it got more
[1:14:35] and more and more and more understand
[1:14:37] when he's down here at the base of his
[1:14:40] life there's a many following but as he
[1:14:43] moves towards the crowning it's a
[1:14:46] narrowing down criticizing itself does
[1:14:51] not disease it increases but this is
[1:14:55] where if we're locked in into the
[1:14:58] program and plan of God and now you can
[1:15:00] see why that Satan worked so hard with
[1:15:03] things to try to bring things up in our
[1:15:06] life and even when it's things that you
[1:15:08] and I that we can't truly say this is a
[1:15:10] test or trial you just have to say this
[1:15:12] is just a dumb mistake that I made are
[1:15:15] you with me but in the midst of what we
[1:15:18] can say God teach me help me Lord help
[1:15:21] me because the Bible does say that he'll
[1:15:24] make all things work together for our
[1:15:27] good he can teach us things I we see
[1:15:32] that very clearly so been with so that
[1:15:35] within the midst of it here must be then
[1:15:38] a satisfying according to the Father so
[1:15:42] this is going to take one that maybe the
[1:15:46] rest of them could look and say hey hey
[1:15:49] let up he let up he's he's already met
[1:15:54] the requirement but the father's looking
[1:15:56] deeper
[1:15:59] the fathers are looking deeper beyond
[1:16:02] what we can see on the outside you with
[1:16:07] me it's got to be a death on the inside
[1:16:12] and that's a death that only the father
[1:16:17] can see and when that death happens
[1:16:22] don't worry the outside will be
[1:16:26] reconciled to the inside because when
[1:16:31] that of the RAM of the heifer was
[1:16:34] offered up they took it in to the
[1:16:36] innermost part of the tabernacle and as
[1:16:40] they sprinkled that blood on the altar
[1:16:41] then they took it in there the holy
[1:16:43] place and then you know as they worked
[1:16:45] from the innermost part they worked to
[1:16:49] the outer and the holy place and then to
[1:16:52] the outer court what were they doing
[1:16:54] they were reconciling all the courts
[1:16:57] together because the whole building was
[1:17:00] called the tabernacle of God and you and
[1:17:04] I are the tabernacle of God and God
[1:17:06] Himself dwells in a three-room house
[1:17:09] this is why when death happens on the
[1:17:12] inside then it gives you power to
[1:17:15] reconcile those flus or those gates it
[1:17:19] gives you the power to reconcile that
[1:17:22] human spirit that human spirit will
[1:17:25] never take the place of your theophany
[1:17:27] but you have with inside of you the
[1:17:29] deposit that gives you strength by the
[1:17:31] word to rule over those gates you with
[1:17:34] me Nehemiah
[1:17:36] you with me near mine and you've got an
[1:17:38] answer on the inside tooth and knows how
[1:17:40] to open up your understanding glory be
[1:17:43] to God in the highest and when he
[1:17:45] reconciles that s what everything on the
[1:17:47] outside starts looking right to dress
[1:17:51] starts happening open theirs even I mean
[1:17:53] not only in dress starts happening you
[1:17:55] know earrings truck falling off pants
[1:17:57] drop and you know not just pants you
[1:17:58] know we talked about for the sister but
[1:18:00] even these homosexual jeans they got out
[1:18:02] there now for the boys these skinny
[1:18:03] jeans you can save money and go to
[1:18:06] hardware store and get you a can of
[1:18:07] spray paint
[1:18:11] I'm telling you friends these things are
[1:18:13] real there's demons on them racks try to
[1:18:18] go in just a regular store and buy a
[1:18:20] suit nowadays it's a problem well I
[1:18:24] ain't gonna preach on that concern you
[1:18:26] know I just I'm not gonna do it but it
[1:18:29] anyway it is a reality that we need to
[1:18:32] take account about because they're
[1:18:34] sissies also making the clothes and they
[1:18:37] also are trying to accentuate things on
[1:18:40] men on the way you're going Lord but
[1:18:42] we'll go you see its reconciling all
[1:18:46] parts but if the Holy Ghost only follows
[1:18:54] on the spirit that's soul still in
[1:18:56] reconciling and that soul will say but I
[1:19:01] tell you what I can do this the Holy
[1:19:03] Ghost comes and falls on me but still
[1:19:07] not reconciled who see the father has to
[1:19:13] see it has to be satisfied in order for
[1:19:17] this life to be dispersed can we read in
[1:19:19] Isaiah 53 verse 10 verse 10 yet it
[1:19:28] pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath
[1:19:34] put him to grief when thou shalt make
[1:19:40] his soul an offering for sin his soul
[1:19:46] and offering for sin his soul you this
[1:19:52] was an innocent one innocent he shall
[1:19:59] see his seed notice within this I want
[1:20:02] you to catch this he shall see his seed
[1:20:05] isn't Isis he shall prolong his days he
[1:20:13] saw me and you
[1:20:16] through this suffering through this
[1:20:19] purchase he saw me in you this is what
[1:20:25] the purchase was about he shall prolong
[1:20:32] his days and the pleasure of the Lord
[1:20:35] shall prosper in his hand he's hiding in
[1:20:39] the death Satan doesn't know what's
[1:20:42] going on
[1:20:43] if Satan would have known what was going
[1:20:45] on
[1:20:47] Johnson and Johnson would not have been
[1:20:49] the band-aid manufacturer Satan listen
[1:20:53] to me
[1:20:53] if Satan would have known what was going
[1:20:55] on he would have tried everything to
[1:20:58] prevent this death
[1:21:01] it'll be preached from hell that is why
[1:21:04] Satan down through the ages he knows the
[1:21:07] power when death itself finishes him
[1:21:11] that's why he's trying to stop lives
[1:21:14] from coming to a place of death because
[1:21:17] before you can be born again you must
[1:21:19] die but he's hidden in the secret of
[1:21:26] death you see Satan can sit here and
[1:21:28] scan in this audience right here this
[1:21:29] morning you said well they ain't even an
[1:21:31] altar call going on but the kingdom of
[1:21:33] God cometh without observation hey man
[1:21:39] Christ in chat will radrat in on our
[1:21:41] lives in a white horse come on until my
[1:21:43] revelations 19 his name is called the
[1:21:46] Word of God till ran ran in and he'll
[1:21:49] they didn't to reveal and move past the
[1:21:52] vesture z' of our life and he begins to
[1:21:54] take over our life and the devil don't
[1:21:57] even know what's going on he can't do
[1:22:02] nothing about it because it's Christ
[1:22:05] drawing you
[1:22:09] don't you let that devil try to tell you
[1:22:12] that he's got power he's been stripped
[1:22:14] of every power when you and your heart
[1:22:18] begin to surrender and letting God have
[1:22:20] his way I tell you the Holy Ghost he'll
[1:22:23] come right to where you're at right to
[1:22:25] where your need is let me tell you
[1:22:27] something they don't have to wait till
[1:22:28] the end of the service the Holy Ghost
[1:22:30] the Prophet tells us hearing recognizing
[1:22:33] acting on the word he said right there
[1:22:35] when you yourself have come to that
[1:22:38] place of death you don't have to turn a
[1:22:40] new leaf he said the fire of God will
[1:22:42] come down and burn that thing up and
[1:22:44] your change right there but it's a death
[1:22:51] that the father sees church members can
[1:22:57] say hold Bob tell you what what a
[1:22:59] wonderful guy

[1:23:51] talking about that he has within that
[1:23:54] same life that ties him back and
[1:23:56] identifies him all the way through the
[1:23:59] book to where that have you lived in the
[1:24:03] days of not you'd have been working on

[1:25:44] about that one they'll say this they'll

[1:26:20] the critical Spirit and you get to look

[1:26:39] slewfoot he knows if he can get in here
[1:26:42] and get the attitude twisted just a long
[1:26:44] day it will prevent death
[1:26:47] you know why he does that because he's
[1:26:49] afraid it's too cold it's too hot it's
[1:26:57] too loud it's too quiet it's true this
[1:27:00] it's true that friends those things
[1:27:02] don't matter they don't matter they
[1:27:04] don't give you a rap string faith
[1:27:05] because if we make it too cold for you
[1:27:07] it'll be too hot for it'll be 2 to 2 mil
[1:27:10] warm for somebody else where they need
[1:27:12] to be warmer we're making one for
[1:27:13] somebody else and you're here you are
[1:27:14] sitting we make this quiet we make this
[1:27:16] loud just remember you're not the
[1:27:18] absolute he is who you're Jesus
[1:27:23] my my my mind it don't matter how long
[1:27:27] you've been in a message my question is
[1:27:29] how long has it been in you you can be
[1:27:34] born and raised in this and still it not
[1:27:37] be preeminent in your life this is not
[1:27:40] about doing things because what brother
[1:27:42] Brown said this here and we do it here
[1:27:43] because of that that's stealing
[1:27:44] preeminence
[1:27:45] that's law it must be a love affair I'm
[1:27:51] telling you straight out if it's not a
[1:27:52] love affair you need to get a heart
[1:27:55] checkup glory be to God let's go on now
[1:28:00] and shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[1:28:05] shall my righteous servant justify many
[1:28:09] how many of you know he knew what he was
[1:28:10] doing by his knowledge shall my
[1:28:16] righteous servant justify many so when
[1:28:23] he went to Calvary he knew what he was
[1:28:27] doing by his knowledge when we are in
[1:28:32] that place dwelling there you see God
[1:28:36] doesn't look it isn't come up here and
[1:28:37] reliable event says people say come up
[1:28:40] here and empty out your mind empty out
[1:28:42] your mind he said you better be careful
[1:28:43] about that cuz Satan will fill it up he
[1:28:47] said you get a spirit
[1:28:48] it won't be the holy ghost it's empty
[1:28:51] out the heart let the heart be willing
[1:28:55] to die got to be a death therefore will
[1:29:03] I divide him a portion with the Great
[1:29:05] and he shall divide the spoil with the
[1:29:08] strong who's the strong it's true
[1:29:14] because he hath poured out his soul unto
[1:29:20] death I have to go to be to God aren't
[1:29:25] you glad for that and he was numbered
[1:29:28] with the transgressors he bear the sin
[1:29:32] of many and made intercession for the
[1:29:35] transgressors he did not become sinful
[1:29:39] but your sin and my sin was transferred
[1:29:43] upon him for he made him to be sin who
[1:29:49] knew no sin that we might be made the
[1:29:53] very righteousness of God in him you see
[1:29:58] this type there was many types in
[1:30:02] reconciling but when you look at this
[1:30:06] even in Ruth and Boaz here when Boaz
[1:30:11] before he can ever take Ruth and be
[1:30:15] reconciled fully Ruth recognizes who he
[1:30:24] is then Boaz must go to the one who had
[1:30:34] a claim on the estate first and he goes
[1:30:40] to him who had a claim on the stake
[1:30:43] because he who had a claim on the state
[1:30:47] it was actually his property and you and
[1:30:52] I and then listen to me listen to the
[1:30:54] words closely you and I were the
[1:30:58] property of Satan
[1:31:02] what was his property
[1:31:04] our first birth our first birth we were
[1:31:12] his property but you see has the man who
[1:31:18] was there when boys came to him the man
[1:31:21] said I'm not gonna Mar my inheritance
[1:31:24] how can i Mar my inheritance
[1:31:27] I can't redeem that if I take Ruth it'll
[1:31:30] Mar my inheritance and this is where the
[1:31:32] Prophet lays it out he said see the
[1:31:35] devil he was already sin and he said
[1:31:40] that listen now listen to these words he
[1:31:41] said the devil could not be countin the
[1:31:44] devil in order to take away sin it had
[1:31:48] to be one who was innocent
[1:31:51] become our sin come on now forsaking all
[1:31:56] the Prophet tells us he said he could
[1:31:58] not remain a son and make sinners sons
[1:32:02] so he himself became a sinner died a
[1:32:06] sinner these are his words that he might
[1:32:09] take sinners and make sons but how can
[1:32:13] he make sons out of sinners because
[1:32:16] beneath that darkness is a
[1:32:19] representation that's laying there
[1:32:23] that's what redemptions all about but
[1:32:27] the devil could not take away that sin
[1:32:31] but God came down and was made man a
[1:32:36] kinsman redeemer that he might shed his
[1:32:41] blood notice he suffered without the
[1:32:43] gate he went to the gate and there were
[1:32:48] the elders gathered around there was a
[1:32:50] transaction gonna be made at the gate
[1:32:55] gates refer to transactions a place
[1:32:58] where things are sealed away a place
[1:33:01] where debts are settled the gates of
[1:33:05] Hell shall not prevail against it
[1:33:07] there's not a transaction of hail that
[1:33:10] can come against the child of God
[1:33:13] you with me in the head in the north
[1:33:15] sorry Satan does need stripped of his
[1:33:17] power brother Samuel you're preaching
[1:33:20] that all your preaching that off the ha
[1:33:22] who was it that was revealed in this
[1:33:24] hour it was not a church that was
[1:33:26] revealed it was Christ the mighty
[1:33:29] Conqueror that has come in plain view Oh
[1:33:34] God has to do is turn their heart and
[1:33:37] your heart begins to believe and seek
[1:33:39] after him and God will come right down
[1:33:42] to your need glory be to God we were
[1:33:48] that property but notice God came and he
[1:33:52] redeemed us I want you to look at this
[1:33:55] my let me just try to lay this in a
[1:33:59] little bit we'll see where we get to I
[1:34:02] want to come back here to this place of
[1:34:05] the River Jordan because what we find
[1:34:10] here so now we've moved away from
[1:34:13] Calvary and we're kind of coming back to
[1:34:17] a place right here at the River Jordan
[1:34:20] because the Spirit of God had come down
[1:34:25] in the past and the Bible tells us in
[1:34:29] the book of Peter that holy men of old
[1:34:33] spake as they were moved upon by the
[1:34:37] Holy Ghost David remember David would
[1:34:42] write take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1:34:46] none of them had been sealed because the
[1:34:51] ceiling is a manifesting of redemption
[1:34:55] it's laying what rightfully belongs to
[1:34:58] me we see that down through the Old
[1:35:02] Testament even where it went Tamar when
[1:35:03] she came and she was ready to be stoned
[1:35:06] but when Judah said stone this woman but
[1:35:12] remember in the transaction in the
[1:35:15] transaction she had asked for his staff
[1:35:18] and his signet
[1:35:21] and when she wins the stones were ready
[1:35:24] to fly
[1:35:25] she said the seed I have in me is of
[1:35:29] this man pray tell if thou canst discern
[1:35:32] this
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:35] hallelujah
[1:35:36] what was this that declared what was on
[1:35:40] the inside his staff and his seal he
[1:35:46] seeketh such to worship Him in spirit
[1:35:49] and in truth
[1:35:53] glory be to God so here at the River
[1:35:58] Jordan what we see is the lamb coming
[1:36:03] the lamb is coming the prophet he lays
[1:36:09] it out in this manner and we see how
[1:36:13] that here when John he walks out in the
[1:36:16] water and as a baptizing here as he
[1:36:20] comes up out of the water the scripture
[1:36:22] said the heavens were opened to him and
[1:36:26] that the Holy Spirit descended in the
[1:36:30] form of a dove and a voice spoke out
[1:36:36] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:36:42] pleased
[1:36:44] the Lord in Malachi 3 was suddenly
[1:36:48] coming to his temple lo a bali has doubt
[1:36:54] prepared for me he was claiming
[1:36:58] redeeming what belong to him are you
[1:37:02] with me
[1:37:02] he couldn't if that could not happen any
[1:37:04] other time but he redeemed because here
[1:37:07] was a lamb I like nature so the dog
[1:37:12] could come and redeem like nature now
[1:37:18] you're wondering now you're saying oh
[1:37:19] brother salmon you got yourself in a fix
[1:37:21] oh no I don't all of them were
[1:37:24] identified in the lamb but there was not
[1:37:28] a blood that had within it the power and
[1:37:33] authority to
[1:37:34] release them that they might die to
[1:37:37] themselves and receive his life
[1:37:42] so the had to be one cup of light nature
[1:37:49] pay the price there had to be that
[1:37:52] reconciling a great event after River
[1:37:54] Jordan in order for that death to take
[1:37:59] place that you and I might be redeemed
[1:38:04] had to be like nature's see Jesus when
[1:38:08] he went to the River Jordan he was not
[1:38:10] baptized like you and I when we come up
[1:38:13] here and we repent of our sins he had no
[1:38:15] sins repenteth he didn't he didn't have
[1:38:20] a sinful nature it was a lamb when he
[1:38:25] came behold the lamb of God it was
[1:38:30] already the nature was there see that
[1:38:35] nature was hidden down through the elect
[1:38:40] why did Satan hey Satan say this about
[1:38:43] everybody but sitting on it look at
[1:38:45] enable he's I got him I got him it come
[1:38:48] to Ezekiel I got him there were many
[1:38:53] others who were offering lambs many were
[1:38:58] offering lambs but not all had down
[1:39:02] beneath a lamb nature that was
[1:39:04] identified because that lamb nature
[1:39:08] underneath there you see a Jeremiah and
[1:39:09] Ezekiel all the elect down through the
[1:39:11] ages that was looking forward to that
[1:39:14] it's spoke of this time the Bible says
[1:39:20] many of the slate Saints arose not
[1:39:23] Oliver only the elect who were the
[1:39:27] overcomers in their day got up that's
[1:39:33] all right so here is this like nature it
[1:39:38] could not be think about
[1:39:42] the Holy Spirit has the Prophet dealing
[1:39:44] with this all the way down through the
[1:39:49] ministry the lamb and the death it keeps
[1:39:52] working with it keeps working with it
[1:39:53] and speaking to the people you were a
[1:39:58] lamb at one time but it says now you've
[1:40:02] become like a wolf how do you go from a
[1:40:05] lamb to a wolf see he says when you go
[1:40:09] to that when you go to even thinking
[1:40:12] then rather probably brings it when you
[1:40:13] go to thinking you've got a right to get
[1:40:16] even the Holy Ghost takes its flight
[1:40:20] ephesians grieve not the Spirit of God
[1:40:25] whereby you are sealed you're not a wolf
[1:40:31] in sheep's clothing
[1:40:33] you're a sheep in wolf's clothing you
[1:40:50] understand for the point that's made
[1:40:52] okay I'm you tried to visualize that now
[1:40:57] but this is where brother Brown takes
[1:40:59] this he spends time on this and the
[1:41:01] message the token he was a lamb when he
[1:41:04] came there he did not become a lamb at
[1:41:10] the River Jordan he already was a lamb
[1:41:16] you don't become a lamb when you're born
[1:41:20] again you always were a sheep but that
[1:41:27] old nature had to die that he might
[1:41:31] raise up that lamb yes sir
[1:41:36] it must be the lamb standing in you
[1:41:40] glory be to God that's the only kind
[1:41:44] baby then said let me just let me just
[1:41:46] kind of quote in here don't try to
[1:41:47] follow me on it he says it was a lamb
[1:41:50] when it come there it shows
[1:41:51] predestination that's the only kind
[1:41:54] Jodeci said he was born Alam raised up a
[1:41:57] lamb therefore that's the only kind of a
[1:42:01] true spirit that can receive the word
[1:42:03] that can receive Christ
[1:42:07] so it's God coming through his word to
[1:42:12] worry by his word to bring us on to
[1:42:16] himself to wear that that old nature
[1:42:21] dies that the two might blend together
[1:42:28] because the Holy Ghost will not sit down
[1:42:31] on a wolf
[1:42:36] remember this preeminence is not forced
[1:42:41] he draws us in obedience unto himself is
[1:42:47] that right he says when he found that
[1:42:51] nature it was one he could blend into
[1:42:56] this was a coming of the Lord he blends
[1:42:59] right into it and yet it happens so
[1:43:02] secretly that the devil don't know
[1:43:06] nothing about it but he blends right
[1:43:11] together oh and he says brother BAM goes
[1:43:14] on and it's a paragraph 64 he said I
[1:43:17] wonder today when God leads us to a life
[1:43:19] of complete surrender and service to Him
[1:43:21] I wonder if our spirits then sometime
[1:43:24] don't rebel kind of showing that wonder
[1:43:29] if we are lambs
[1:43:30] a lamb is obedient a lamb is self
[1:43:37] sacrificial it doesn't take claim its
[1:43:41] own you think about it 1st Corinthians
[1:43:43] 14 love it love seeketh not his own can
[1:43:46] lay it down and cheer the wool off of it
[1:43:50] now you remember we were in some one of
[1:43:53] the Thursday night services we were
[1:43:55] talking about that you don't ever see a
[1:43:58] sheep when they go to shear the wool the
[1:44:02] sheep just don't stand there
[1:44:04] and there take the shears and they just
[1:44:06] said now can you turn around this side
[1:44:08] this is not a haircut but there are
[1:44:14] people who are trained to know how to
[1:44:19] handle that sheep to be able to remove
[1:44:23] the war that's why in every test in
[1:44:28] every trial he's right there he knows
[1:44:36] just how to hold you so you don't hurt
[1:44:38] yourself he ain't interested in nobody
[1:44:42] else he's right there he is the Good
[1:44:46] Shepherd the Lord is my shepherd he
[1:44:52] knows how to hold you move you around or
[1:44:54] watch some guys do it they'll move it
[1:44:56] around the pulling up here man they're
[1:44:58] sharing that that will off and that lamb
[1:45:00] will just lay there this is the rest
[1:45:05] that we have in here I know when things
[1:45:07] come up sometimes in our life it takes
[1:45:09] us by surprise and that's where we look
[1:45:11] at the scripture and monitors thinking
[1:45:13] not streams the fiery trials that have
[1:45:16] come upon you but just know this that
[1:45:19] when God has permitted anything to come
[1:45:21] our way this is a time for us to rest in
[1:45:26] his hands and say Lord shear off what
[1:45:30] needs to be sheared off sure it away
[1:45:34] Lord God did get every part of the wool
[1:45:37] because I don't want to run around with
[1:45:39] just one big old patch of wool hanging
[1:45:41] on me somewhere like I'm thinking what
[1:45:42] you and now if somebody's running away
[1:45:44] with a patch of wool they slipped out
[1:45:52] but the Bible says in the book of
[1:45:55] Corinthians he will not permit something
[1:46:01] to come your way that he himself does
[1:46:05] not provide sufficient grace in order
[1:46:08] for you to bear it
[1:46:13] he is faithful once you love him this
[1:46:19] morning maybe we'll just try to descend
[1:46:24] on this point here this lamb he leads us
[1:46:29] to a life of self sacrificing this is
[1:46:34] where God Himself continuing to move the
[1:46:39] whole time in our life it's continuing
[1:46:42] to lead us onward into a greater
[1:46:47] sacrifice and once you just to think of
[1:46:51] this and let me close on this the book
[1:46:55] of Romans says in Romans 12:1 and 2 it
[1:47:00] speaks to us by brethren by the mercies
[1:47:04] of God that you would present yourself
[1:47:07] as a living sacrifice holy and it goes
[1:47:14] through all of these things
[1:47:15] how can you or me present ourselves in
[1:47:19] that way by receiving what he has given
[1:47:26] to us we are like Esther called by the
[1:47:32] love letter and the rest are telling hey
[1:47:37] GI hey guy we want this we want that we
[1:47:41] want this we want this we see it they're
[1:47:45] not dead hello somebody
[1:47:48] they're not dead we want this we want
[1:47:50] these jewels we want this we but Esther
[1:47:55] comes in all the Bible Bible said she
[1:47:59] had such a spirit upon her she comes in
[1:48:04] there and the Bible says she took
[1:48:07] nothing but what hey guy
[1:48:11] the Kings Chamberlain
[1:48:13] required hey guy
[1:48:18] the Kings Chamberlain is a very type of
[1:48:21] the Holy Ghost
[1:48:23] it's the Holy Ghost himself that has
[1:48:26] overseen the calling of his bride down
[1:48:30] through the ages he's had messengers and
[1:48:34] under messengers and it's been him
[1:48:37] making up his bride she's not dressed to
[1:48:43] reflect an idea
[1:48:45] her dress wear reflects who her husband
[1:48:49] is
[1:48:50] and that that dress we're reflecting who
[1:48:55] her husband is
[1:48:55] she's clothed in the fine linen which is
[1:48:59] the righteousness of the saints she has
[1:49:03] said I'll take nothing but what you say
[1:49:06] I need you see you see already in here
[1:49:11] she's already died she's ready to be
[1:49:15] united she's ready to be United because
[1:49:20] God can't marry if you still got a
[1:49:23] living husband who can't do it
[1:49:29] you make him an adulterer and all
[1:49:33] somebody has got to be a death then when
[1:49:37] there's a death he says she's free
[1:49:41] Abigail's mind now come on somebody
[1:49:44] preach with me a little bit
[1:49:46] Abigail's mine now he has authority to
[1:49:52] raise you up and marry you don't you
[1:49:58] loving
[1:50:03] I take only what you require Lord what
[1:50:07] you require not what I but what you
[1:50:10] require surrender and the whole time
[1:50:15] here is God he's watching he sees down
[1:50:19] beneath and when he sees that death he
[1:50:22] says no it's just like you wonder why
[1:50:31] certain things maybe haven't taken place
[1:50:34] he don't just leave this on a level of
[1:50:36] just we're talking about the new birth
[1:50:38] because that's every service and this is
[1:50:41] I want you to see that there's got to be
[1:50:43] a death before he can ever raise up what
[1:50:47] was alive once before right his thoughts
[1:50:52] are real and eternal but it's the same
[1:50:58] way with everything within our lives
[1:51:01] that we come in contact with everything
[1:51:05] we have to be willing to die and this is
[1:51:10] a question we've got to ask ourselves
[1:51:11] who do we want to be revealed in this
[1:51:14] situation us or him in order for him to
[1:51:21] be revealed we have to die to ourselves
[1:51:26] how has he been revealed to you how has
[1:51:30] he come to be revealed to you and me how
[1:51:33] because he died in order to bring this
[1:51:38] revelation to you and me so it applies
[1:51:44] in every part of our life sometimes you
[1:51:47] know as I said when it comes to things
[1:51:50] within a family comes the church comes
[1:51:53] with things on your job
[1:51:54] there's things it has to start here you
[1:52:00] know I'm not preaching now neither have
[1:52:03] I been preaching by letters this is
[1:52:06] experience
[1:52:08] it's got to be here sometimes you don't
[1:52:11] even realize when you've still got
[1:52:14] something in your heart when you get
[1:52:17] before God God can let you know you know
[1:52:23] sometimes sometimes you can thank you
[1:52:26] forgiving but if you're still talking
[1:52:29] about it you ain't forgiven when it's
[1:52:34] truly forgiven I'm talking about from
[1:52:36] your heart you're dead to it you're dead
[1:52:45] to it
[1:52:49] man I tell you this is this is rich in
[1:52:52] it and I'll say this that in our life if
[1:53:01] it is him that has led us and does lead
[1:53:05] us to this place to where we submit and
[1:53:09] die then how much more should we make
[1:53:13] ourselves of no reputation and take upon
[1:53:17] ourselves the form of a servant not one
[1:53:22] who is waiting to be served but to serve
[1:53:27] this is what the body of Jesus Christ is
[1:53:31] about one time I preached in another
[1:53:36] place and I preached on a priest on a
[1:53:39] situation I preached on dealing with
[1:53:41] some things prodigal son just came out a
[1:53:43] little bit in the service you know
[1:53:45] sometimes when you go places I you know
[1:53:47] you meet people and I have no idea what
[1:53:50] the background is you know sometimes
[1:53:51] somebody can tell you a story and and I
[1:53:54] look at it right away first of all I
[1:53:55] ain't your pastor don't wanna hear it I
[1:53:59] ain't your pastor because I know you're
[1:54:02] gonna give me your side of it your
[1:54:06] pastor he knows a whole lot more than
[1:54:09] what I know but sometimes you know you
[1:54:12] can take people they like like one
[1:54:13] opinion and the individual came to me
[1:54:16] and said I tell you this is exactly it
[1:54:19] was a husband I tell you Bruce a man
[1:54:21] ain't that the truth man they need to be
[1:54:24] forgiving they need to I heard what he
[1:54:27] says it I started looking for the pastor
[1:54:34] so I lookin for somebody else that I
[1:54:36] could say hey god bless you ain't seen
[1:54:38] you in a while
[1:54:39] I don't want to see that I didn't want
[1:54:45] to see the person not get help but the
[1:54:46] thing of it is is that they had taken
[1:54:48] what was spoken and they missed the
[1:54:52] thought of it
[1:54:53] they were looking at the forgiveness of
[1:54:56] that of the prodigal son and trying to
[1:54:58] mandate it as though this is what
[1:55:00] somebody needed to do for them
[1:55:03] needless to say you know I found out
[1:55:06] later on I didn't ask but come to find
[1:55:08] out that home just completely split
[1:55:10] right apart but you see it's an attitude
[1:55:13] I bring it to this it's an attitude that
[1:55:16] we take that's what's important we want
[1:55:20] to apply the word ha but some how do I
[1:55:22] know I'm applying in the right way well
[1:55:24] he's got to be received by Lamm nature
[1:55:26] you cannot receive the word with a wolf
[1:55:30] nature you can receive it in America it
[1:55:36] ought to be when we're coming here right
[1:55:39] here Lord you speak to me come and show
[1:55:44] me Lord how to apply this in my life and
[1:55:51] you watch not only within your marriage
[1:55:55] as you watch within everything else
[1:55:57] listen you watch within everything else
[1:55:59] how God will move on the scene when your
[1:56:05] heart is right
[1:56:07] first when your heart is mandating
[1:56:11] things your heart's not right that's not
[1:56:14] what he did now listen to me listen to
[1:56:17] me listen to me he calls us to himself
[1:56:20] but did we have to repent hello somebody
[1:56:25] did we have to repent sure we did well
[1:56:28] my dad was paid but my repentance shows
[1:56:32] I recognize that I am a sinner I need to
[1:56:38] be saved and that you have paid the
[1:56:41] price for me don't you see don't you see
[1:56:46] what it means not for you to demand debt
[1:56:49] of somebody else but for you to say I'll
[1:56:53] pay the price
[1:57:00] you okay this listen friends this is a
[1:57:05] mystery come right down into the
[1:57:07] simplicity of our life to where that the
[1:57:09] devil himself cannot have an inch God is
[1:57:15] hidden in the secret of death but he's
[1:57:19] manifest in resurrection and has the
[1:57:25] Spirit of God moves upon our heart what
[1:57:27] does it do he's mellowing us out by just
[1:57:34] anything wonderful he gave you and me a
[1:57:39] new heart and they gave us a new spirit
[1:57:45] because we couldn't even get along with
[1:57:50] ourselves then he placed his spirit
[1:57:56] inside of us and causes us to walk
[1:58:01] according to his ways what you never
[1:58:04] dreamed possible and as a mystery you
[1:58:07] see it happening from within and through
[1:58:12] your life so I say this and coming back
[1:58:18] to all of these examples of these things
[1:58:21] this debt is not a demand but I'll say
[1:58:25] this right here for every marriage
[1:58:26] that's here every marriage every home
[1:58:31] every life even there on the job you
[1:58:35] might say I've got the worst boss in the
[1:58:38] world but the Bible says in 1st Timothy
[1:58:42] 2 I would that you were praying for men
[1:58:47] everywhere
[1:58:54] Keane's boggles on because why he says
[1:58:59] it in the claw and then that latter part
[1:59:01] I believe at verse 3 that you might lead
[1:59:04] a quiet and peaceable life when you are
[1:59:09] in prayer with God the result of you
[1:59:14] hiding away and being in prayer with him
[1:59:17] is a quiet peaceable life but that
[1:59:26] requires dying gotta mow the grass gotta
[1:59:31] fix dinner gotta go here but just
[1:59:35] remember prayer is not just the position
[1:59:40] of your body more importantly it's the
[1:59:44] position of your heart the Prophet
[1:59:50] himself spoke about the times even when
[1:59:52] he went hunting and he said many times
[1:59:56] he said I'll get in the car he says I'll
[1:59:58] Drive down and find a road turn off this
[2:00:02] road turn off this road he said and get
[2:00:03] into a road where nobody's act I'll pull
[2:00:07] over he said I've been praying the whole
[2:00:10] time and I'll pull over he said and just
[2:00:13] keep talking to him
[2:00:18] prayer is important
[2:00:23] before the Lord Jesus himself went to
[2:00:26] Calvary he prayed three times it was not
[2:00:33] an easy but he prayed what was he doing
[2:00:35] in prayer he was giving his will over he
[2:00:41] was dying to his will that God's will
[2:00:45] might be front and center
[2:00:48] remember the father looked down and he
[2:00:51] was satisfied he saw this was not an act
[2:00:56] this was a death that had already taken
[2:01:00] place back and gets M&E you see friends
[2:01:05] this is why prayer the Prophet could
[2:01:07] tell us he said prayer is one of the
[2:01:10] most powerful weapons that's ever been
[2:01:13] put into the hands of mortal men don't
[2:01:18] uh never underestimate that but you can
[2:01:21] see why the devil wants to try to take
[2:01:22] it from you I believe I believe God does
[2:01:25] reward you when you sacrifice time out
[2:01:28] of your day or out of your week but I
[2:01:30] also want you to know God's desire is
[2:01:34] that you pray without ceasing how do you
[2:01:39] pray without ceasing when you are on the
[2:01:42] lawnmower or when you're ironing the
[2:01:44] clothes you're praying right there
[2:01:48] you've realized I don't have to be on
[2:01:51] this mountain I don't have to be in
[2:01:53] Jerusalem he seeketh worshipers to
[2:01:57] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[2:02:01] don't your loving I don't know you let's
[2:02:07] pray Heavenly Father what God is we give
[2:02:16] Lord of our lives and our hearts Lord to
[2:02:20] you Lord right here in this time that
[2:02:25] we've had here this morning as you
[2:02:27] speaking to us through your word father
[2:02:30] you're the one to break the bread
[2:02:34] you Lord see to it that each of us would
[2:02:41] Lord be able to receive be able Lord to
[2:02:48] have what is needed or perhaps here this
[2:02:53] morning I no doubt Lord throughout this
[2:02:56] building the gathering maybe those that
[2:02:58] streaming those that would they realize
[2:03:04] I've never died but I I want to die to
[2:03:13] myself I want to die
[2:03:18] Lord perhaps they realize you're not
[2:03:22] pressuring maybe they've been lord
[2:03:25] setting here within the the church for
[2:03:27] may be coming around maybe around the
[2:03:30] message for many years the Lord and this
[2:03:35] time they see it it's you just waiting
[2:03:38] on them to come to a death the Lord I
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:45] stood here this morning as one of your
[2:03:47] ambassadors to be able to declare that
[2:03:52] it's by your sacrificial death and
[2:03:55] offering that you have released what is
[2:03:58] needed in order to even bring them to
[2:04:02] that death all that they need to do is
[2:04:07] surrender to you let the word continue
[2:04:11] to work in their heart and in their life
[2:04:15] Lord Jesus I asked Lord God and father
[2:04:21] if there's one that doesn't must not
[2:04:24] know you in that manner I pray God this
[2:04:27] morning maybe they have never repented
[2:04:30] of their sins maybe they've never been
[2:04:32] baptized in the name of the sacrifice of
[2:04:37] Calvary the Lord Jesus Christ the one
[2:04:41] who paid that price father
[2:04:47] [Music]
[2:04:49] I pray this morning that God that even
[2:04:53] in that part of the word here they are
[2:04:55] dying they're surrendering they're
[2:04:57] submitting you what do you draw into
[2:05:04] that place Oh God to where their mind
[2:05:09] come to a place of being set in order
[2:05:12] for holiness where the blood would
[2:05:15] cleanse and then the Holy Ghost and fire
[2:05:20] coming down
