[32:42] hallelujah
[32:45] hallelujah hallelujah
[32:47] amen it's a wonderful way isn't it
[32:51] amen what what grace amen that god has
[32:54] given to us you know and we we truly
[32:57] realize that the grace of god is not
[32:59] just
[33:01] is god coming and instructing us
[33:03] teaching us correcting us
[33:05] moving among us
[33:07] in a special way
[33:09] amen it's not grace that just allows us
[33:12] to go and to live in sin and that's not
[33:14] real grace
[33:16] but real grace is a manifestation of his
[33:19] love
[33:21] and you know when his love has been
[33:22] projected and it comes to its end
[33:25] then sovereign grace steps in and
[33:27] produces
[33:29] what love has called for
[33:31] and that's the grace of god that comes
[33:33] out without love there would be no grace
[33:36] but the grace of god comes along
[33:38] and it touches our lives begins to deal
[33:40] with our hearts
[33:42] brings correction to our lives that's
[33:44] real grace
[33:45] amen and we are when one thing we're
[33:48] thankful for
[33:49] is we can have all the grace in the
[33:51] world coming to us but to have a heart
[33:53] that's able to receive his grace
[33:57] to have a heart that can receive his
[33:58] grace and to recognize that
[34:01] amen we are we are very privileged
[34:03] people tonight
[34:04] [Music]
[34:06] i want to say
[34:07] i'll say some more on sunday but
[34:10] i want to just say
[34:12] thank you for all who participated
[34:15] in the in the meetings and uh my what a
[34:18] wonderful time that we
[34:20] we had
[34:22] amen
[34:23] you know when we
[34:25] you come through times like that in in
[34:27] special meetings and they are special
[34:30] they are our special moments and special
[34:33] times that where god strengthens us
[34:36] he moves for
[34:38] so many various needs needs and you know
[34:40] sometimes when you as you come out of a
[34:42] special meeting whether you're here or
[34:43] whether you're someplace else it god it
[34:46] just gives you a charge
[34:49] it gives you a charge and gives you
[34:51] strength
[34:53] and
[34:54] you know god doesn't have to wait until
[34:56] a special meeting time
[34:58] but you you all know and you know even
[35:00] as you as as we mature in the lord
[35:02] there's a there's even a special
[35:04] atmosphere that gets set around special
[35:06] meetings
[35:07] [Music]
[35:09] if i could say it like this during a
[35:10] special meeting even somebody who's not
[35:12] called to preach could preach
[35:16] such an anointing it's here we don't
[35:18] believe in women preachers but a sister
[35:19] could preach
[35:21] it's such an anointing you know why
[35:23] everybody coming together with just so
[35:25] much of a
[35:26] one mind one heart one accord
[35:29] and we come together in those times and
[35:31] what god does for us in those times
[35:34] it has an effect upon our life now
[35:36] within every other service and every
[35:38] other part in our life
[35:40] and if that's why they're very special
[35:42] times
[35:43] and we thank god for those special times
[35:46] if we didn't have those special times or
[35:48] if those special times were every single
[35:50] time
[35:51] we wouldn't appreciate them as much
[35:54] but they're special times
[35:57] amen and so
[35:59] i'm just so thankful to the lord i
[36:01] really appreciated the
[36:03] ministering of the word and
[36:05] just what god has done right here among
[36:07] us so many different testimonies that
[36:08] had already begun to come in as of
[36:11] sunday even well even before sunday
[36:13] saturday night from from the prayer line
[36:15] different ones that begin to just speak
[36:17] and just to testify of the things that
[36:19] god
[36:21] had did
[36:22] right here
[36:23] and then even afterwards sunday morning
[36:26] and i know there's no doubt more to come
[36:28] and we just thank god for that i also
[36:31] want to
[36:32] they're not here at the moment i know
[36:33] they're on the way but
[36:37] brother joseph and sister ethylene whom
[36:40] we baptized here on
[36:42] on sunday morning
[36:45] the lord willing they should be here in
[36:47] in a little bit
[36:49] they got a little bit of a start they're
[36:51] coming from from akron and lord willing
[36:53] this is
[36:54] they're making this their home assembly
[36:57] so
[37:02] i also want you to pray for
[37:07] her son brother benjamin we were praying
[37:10] with on sunday night and
[37:12] just been just been communicating with
[37:14] him also and
[37:15] his heart is really tender
[37:18] and um
[37:19] so
[37:20] i just i say that to you because you
[37:22] know how it is sometimes when you go
[37:24] somewhere
[37:26] that's new
[37:27] we want to reach out to them
[37:30] and one thing about it i will say this
[37:32] is as i mentioned that statement the one
[37:34] thing that was a testimony and i'll
[37:36] probably reiterate this on sunday
[37:38] that among the believers from south
[37:40] carolina when they came here
[37:42] the very first thing that they made it
[37:44] made mention
[37:45] they said when we enter those doors
[37:47] right there
[37:48] there's an atmosphere already
[37:51] and they mentioned that even those that
[37:53] had come the first time
[37:55] and we want you know that's something
[37:57] that we would desire that it would
[37:59] always be an atmosphere
[38:01] that when lives enter you say well what
[38:04] about this one what about this one but
[38:05] you have to look and say what about me
[38:08] god doesn't need a whole multitude to
[38:10] create an atmosphere all he needs is one
[38:12] person
[38:13] brother ramsey tells us he said god will
[38:14] do more with just one person then you
[38:17] can have ten revivals you take one life
[38:20] that gets set on fire for god and it'll
[38:22] do more than just having ten revivals
[38:24] so that's what we want in our own lives
[38:26] because through that then it can affect
[38:28] others too but an atmosphere and i i to
[38:31] me if there's one thing that would stand
[38:34] out i
[38:35] i mean i believe god has given us a
[38:37] beautiful building and the work that the
[38:38] brothers have labored on i just i'm
[38:40] thankful for that
[38:42] it speaks of what we think
[38:44] about the kingdom of god
[38:46] it does the things that we do around
[38:48] here it speaks of what we think like
[38:50] david said i'm dwelling in a house
[38:53] and and the ark is growing in a tent
[38:55] david said no no no
[38:58] but one thing that i would rather have
[39:01] people to notice than to mention is to
[39:02] say
[39:03] the presence of the lord is there
[39:07] because there's there's buildings that
[39:09] will outshine this building maybe more
[39:11] elaborate and everything else but the
[39:13] second thing that was said over and over
[39:17] is how loving
[39:19] that the people are here
[39:22] i would rather have those two things
[39:25] that are mentioned than anything else
[39:28] you know brother branham was asked the
[39:29] question when the tabernacle first
[39:31] started early and the question was
[39:33] what are you preaching what's going on
[39:35] why do these people they love one
[39:37] another they can't wait to get together
[39:39] such love
[39:40] among them
[39:42] brother braham says the only thing i
[39:43] know to tell you is he says is i preach
[39:45] the gospel
[39:47] because it's a work of the holy spirit
[39:50] and we we all we always want to be that

[39:54] takes into effect
[39:56] you know sometimes you might feel like

[40:04] priest is just isn't when we we we go
[40:06] away we go and we we praying for people

[41:49] you know i look down through there each
[41:51] one of them and i said everybody every
[41:53] one of these peoples are coming through
[41:54] they all have been on a journey
[41:56] everybody's been on a journey
[41:58] and you know what
[41:59] the journey is not what you focus on but
[42:01] the journey itself is what also speaks a
[42:04] lot about
[42:06] our lives
[42:08] you know
[42:08] and so we just want to say
[42:10] congratulations brother william
[42:12] amen
[42:13] and i sure do appreciate the grace of
[42:16] god
[42:18] and i tell you we've got so many
[42:19] different people that are associated
[42:21] with medical maybe instead of building a
[42:23] fellowship hall we just need to build a
[42:24] hospital
[42:30] this is a spiritual hospital exactly
[42:33] this is the spiritual hospital
[42:35] but i thank god thank god for each of
[42:38] you
[42:39] amen could we just bow our heads in a
[42:41] word of prayer this morning or this
[42:42] evening heavenly father
[42:46] we are lord just so thankful and so
[42:48] grateful for your grace lord once again
[42:51] that
[42:52] you lord have brought us together lord
[42:55] you've made a way that we can
[42:57] be here this evening lord
[43:01] father forgive us in times when we've
[43:03] just taken it lord for granted
[43:06] we we don't want to do that lord
[43:08] there's a purpose
[43:10] in our coming here lord this evening
[43:13] that's to hear from you
[43:15] lord there's many
[43:17] many needs among us
[43:20] dear god only you can meet
[43:22] every need
[43:24] that to me lord it stands as a paradox
[43:26] how that you can take a service and you
[43:29] can speak to this need and speak to this
[43:31] need sometimes lord you will say things
[43:33] very directly and then there's other
[43:35] times the lord that even in the midst of
[43:38] that has the holy spirit is speaking
[43:40] directly yet there are things the
[43:41] inspiration the spirit of truth just
[43:44] begins to direct us lord that the word
[43:47] might be applied to our lives we
[43:50] we just invite you lord this evening
[43:52] these next few moments that we would
[43:54] take lord in your presence
[43:56] we pray that god that you'll come and
[43:58] speak to each of our hearts
[44:00] lord i believe that everyone as they're
[44:02] gathered here this evening they've not
[44:04] come here lord to to be seen
[44:07] oh how we love to see one another but
[44:10] we've come lord to hear from you
[44:13] we ask that god you'll just let the man
[44:16] part step aside
[44:18] let every part of our being
[44:21] be yielded to you lord
[44:23] may you come
[44:24] be the speaker here lord this evening
[44:27] and speak to our hearts in a personal
[44:29] way we pray
[44:30] in jesus precious name
[44:33] amen
[44:35] god bless you tonight if we could i'm
[44:36] going to ask you if we just read one
[44:38] verse of scripture
[44:40] of joshua chapter 5.
[44:51] joshua chapter 5 and verse 1
[45:02] and it came to pass
[45:04] when all the kings of the amorites which
[45:07] were on the side of jordan westward
[45:10] and all the kings of the canaanites
[45:12] which were by the sea
[45:15] heard that the lord had dried up the
[45:18] waters of jordan
[45:20] from before the children of israel
[45:23] until we were passed over
[45:25] that their heart
[45:28] that their heart melded
[45:30] within them neither was their spirit in
[45:34] them anymore
[45:35] because of the children
[45:38] of israel
[45:40] may god blesses the reading of the word
[45:42] as you're being seated
[45:45] just going to
[45:48] a few moments here tonight and
[45:51] we've been looking
[45:52] for some time on prayer and
[45:55] i want you just to see a direction that
[45:57] we're going
[46:00] because in this particular service and
[46:02] some of the previous services you may
[46:03] not hear
[46:05] as far as
[46:07] maybe the word prayer although it's used
[46:09] continuously but remember
[46:11] that with every prayer
[46:14] that is that is offered up
[46:16] prayer is to be offered up with faith
[46:20] and it is faith that is looking to every
[46:24] promise of god and then
[46:26] once we have come
[46:29] then we
[46:30] that was good and i felt like something
[46:31] just killed here uh something
[46:35] once we come into christ fully
[46:38] then
[46:38] it's the token that's presented with our
[46:41] prayer
[46:42] remember jesus said in his word he said
[46:44] ask the father anything
[46:47] in my name
[46:49] and i
[46:50] will do it
[46:51] so it's according to his character his
[46:54] name and he said i will do it
[46:57] so it's god not looking at our words
[47:02] but it's god is looking at the heart
[47:05] and he's also recognizing the token
[47:08] because the token the holy ghost
[47:11] is an assurance of every promise of god
[47:16] so when we all through the scriptures
[47:18] we've dealt with this on prayer since
[47:21] back in january we know that when jesus
[47:24] how many times that the lord jesus here
[47:26] he would express and speak to us ask ask
[47:30] ask ask so there's things that god knows
[47:33] that we have need of
[47:34] and there are situations that we come to
[47:37] and we don't know the will of god in a
[47:40] situation when this is where we begin to
[47:43] ask and we begin to seek after god
[47:45] because
[47:46] as a believer god wants to so build our
[47:50] lives and our hearts into a place to
[47:52] where we're not
[47:54] pro-approaching any promise of god
[47:57] with a question but we're approaching
[47:59] that promise with a certainty
[48:03] that's from everything that's from
[48:04] deliverance to the baptism of the holy
[48:06] ghost healing on and on and on and be
[48:09] you know coming into the land and then
[48:11] once you're in the land everything
[48:12] because look if a person doesn't even
[48:15] approach the baptism of the holy ghost
[48:18] in in in the right way of looking at it
[48:21] and approaching it as a certain promise
[48:23] that that's a promise that belongs to me
[48:26] then they'll not receive it but when
[48:28] they can approach it brother branham
[48:30] would say it over and over he says it's
[48:32] a promise and you must fight for it
[48:35] it's fighting and it's worth fighting
[48:36] for you fight beyond all unbelief you
[48:39] fight beyond everything because it is a
[48:42] promise that is certain and it's ringing
[48:45] out to your heart
[48:47] that's how it is with every promise so
[48:49] that's kind of just in a direction the
[48:51] way that we're going and how god would
[48:53] be taking us here in this of joshua
[48:56] because joshua is a type of ephesians of
[48:59] where the believer coming into christ to
[49:02] where all promises are yea and amen and
[49:06] we come into this scripture here after
[49:08] uh they have brought up we looked at the
[49:11] last time the the they brought up the
[49:13] the stones uh out of jordan and then
[49:16] they placed other stones in jordan where
[49:19] the feet of the priest were and it was a
[49:22] testimony those stones were a testimony
[49:26] as they would set there when when it
[49:28] would come by and the children would ask
[49:31] of their fathers and say what does this
[49:34] mean
[49:35] it would be a testimony
[49:37] that how that god had parted the jordan
[49:41] and god
[49:42] brought up out of the waters and made a
[49:45] way for the children of israel to cross
[49:48] into the promise i'd say that was boy
[49:50] that would have been quite a family
[49:52] devotional time i'd say that be a time
[49:54] that where it finally started to peak in
[49:57] the heart of a child
[49:59] or you know of a young person begin to
[50:01] look and they could point back to those
[50:03] stones and said the same god that did it
[50:06] for me
[50:07] is the same god for you
[50:10] it would be a witness a a marker that
[50:14] they could point to and let me just say
[50:15] it in this way that witness and that
[50:18] marker is not something that we are
[50:20] pointing to out here
[50:22] but now within our own lives we can
[50:24] point to the work of the lord jesus in
[50:28] our own lives and say i've got
[50:30] confidence that what god did in me
[50:33] i didn't do it but he came and did it
[50:37] and the same one that made a way for me
[50:39] is the same god to make a way for you
[50:43] now when we look at this here in the
[50:44] scripture in verse 1
[50:46] you know the bible begins to speak how
[50:49] that they the all of the kings and
[50:52] different ones on this side of jordan
[50:54] aware of where israel
[50:57] had crossed and now here they were they
[50:59] crossed through the jordan
[51:02] and we know that the jordan it it types
[51:04] that of death and and when they were
[51:06] passed over notice the this this working
[51:10] and this is what i want to bring you to
[51:12] this working of what they were
[51:14] witnessing it was the lord that dried up
[51:16] the waters of jordan so not only had he
[51:19] done that on the red sea but these other
[51:22] inhabitants had heard how the lord had
[51:25] dried up the waters of jordan
[51:28] before the children of israel until we
[51:30] were passed over now notice their heart
[51:33] melted
[51:35] at one point you know these people in
[51:38] the land canaanites jebusites all of
[51:40] them
[51:41] they were warriors
[51:43] they were people that were ready for
[51:45] battle they were accustomed to that but
[51:48] when they heard of what god was doing
[51:52] for his people this wasn't the people
[51:54] doing it it was god doing it and the
[51:57] people were walking in the way
[52:00] that god was opening
[52:02] and when they heard that
[52:04] their hearts melded there was not even
[52:07] any spirit meaning any courage it's
[52:10] what they even would have within them to
[52:12] stand up to it was gone all of these
[52:15] inhabitants of the land why was that
[52:18] because the lord was moving and the
[52:22] people of god were moving in step with
[52:26] what god was doing
[52:29] oh my wish i could really preach here
[52:32] you see this is why
[52:34] even when you're walking the scripture
[52:36] says walk in the light as he's in the
[52:40] light
[52:41] you see god shows you a little light
[52:44] unfolds and you repent of your sin it's
[52:48] god opening away and as you walk in that
[52:51] way satan begins to tremble
[52:55] and god begins to open more through
[52:58] sanctification and you walk in that it
[53:01] begins to change your mind and your way
[53:03] of thinking about things of of things
[53:06] that you once thought about now you're
[53:08] in your mind and your way of thinking
[53:10] you know i don't want to do that i i'm
[53:11] not going to do that that's not pleasing
[53:13] to the lord what is it it's a working of
[53:15] sanctification and as you begin to walk
[53:18] in that the same thing begins to happen
[53:21] as in this verse satan begins to tremble
[53:24] you say how would i know he's trembling
[53:27] because he'll start and he'll try to put
[53:29] everything in your mind he'll try to do
[53:31] everything he can to hinder and stop and
[53:35] take your focus away from what god is
[53:37] doing and then god further opens his
[53:41] word
[53:42] in that of the holy spirit moving down
[53:45] because remember
[53:46] the holy spirit the seal of god is only
[53:51] more of the same holy spirit that's
[53:55] already been working through
[53:57] justification sanctification
[54:00] now he has made a way for himself to
[54:04] come fully into your life
[54:07] see it's walking
[54:09] satan doesn't care how much we know
[54:12] about the word how much we can quote it
[54:14] but it's walking in step with the word
[54:16] of god let me just say it like this it's
[54:18] walking in step with the angel of the
[54:21] lord it's walking in step in the name of
[54:24] jesus christ and it makes the devil
[54:27] tremble
[54:29] hallelujah this is why there's a power
[54:32] of your confession just like when a
[54:34] heart is surrendered to god and they
[54:37] might have all sorts of things in their
[54:39] life and brother brahm says you begin to
[54:41] confess that you're saved and then you
[54:44] act like you're saved you believe that
[54:47] and he said you watch it works
[54:48] righteousness why because it's not your
[54:52] word that you're confessing you're
[54:55] confessing the word of the waymaker the
[54:59] lord jesus christ
[55:02] hallelujah he's the high priest
[55:04] of our confession
[55:08] i i want to speak here a little bit and
[55:10] i want to go to joshua 2. but i want to
[55:12] speak about being fully identified with
[55:15] the living god
[55:17] and in joshua chapter 2 this is going
[55:20] back to where the spies had went down
[55:22] there into jericho they when the
[55:25] children of israel were still they were
[55:27] still on the other side of jordan they
[55:28] hadn't crossed but i i want to go back
[55:30] to this and listen to the words
[55:32] that are mentioned here by rahab
[55:35] she said to the men
[55:37] in verse 9 i'll go right to that one
[55:39] i know
[55:41] that the lord
[55:43] might give you the land
[55:47] no what does it say
[55:49] hath given you the land now once you
[55:51] think about this here is rahab she
[55:54] doesn't even have the token yet
[55:58] but she is standing there and witnessing
[56:01] how god is moving
[56:04] and she knows what god starts he
[56:06] finishes
[56:10] there's already been testimonies that
[56:12] are going before the children of israel
[56:14] and she's standing there listen to me
[56:17] she doesn't she at that time is not
[56:20] fully identified as a believer but she
[56:23] oh my mama
[56:25] she is choosing to identify herself with
[56:29] the things of god and she said i know
[56:32] that god hath given you the land you
[56:35] that's where every one of us must be is
[56:37] choosing to identify with the word
[56:41] because the word comes among us and he
[56:43] identifies himself with us we don't
[56:46] deserve that
[56:48] that's the grace of almighty god but i
[56:50] want to be found as one when the word
[56:53] comes to identify himself in our midst i
[56:56] want to identify with him
[56:59] i know that the lord had given you the
[57:01] land
[57:02] and that your terror
[57:05] is falling upon us
[57:07] and that all the inhabitants of the land
[57:10] faint because of you
[57:14] i want you to think of this now
[57:16] your terror
[57:21] they don't have it that's not them
[57:23] but what are they doing they're walking
[57:25] in step
[57:27] with the word
[57:28] as god is making a way
[57:32] let me tell you i couldn't get myself
[57:34] out of where i was and you couldn't get
[57:35] yourself out of where you were
[57:38] but you see this this is this reality
[57:40] here it only becomes a continual
[57:43] unfolding in the life of every believer
[57:45] because we in the land come up against
[57:48] obstacles that you do not know how we
[57:51] are going to overcome we know how but
[57:54] when we don't know the pattern or how is
[57:56] god going to do it but we know this one
[57:58] thing that god is more than able and i
[58:02] am a believer and he's still a waymaker
[58:08] how because he made a way that i could
[58:11] be free from sin
[58:16] what are the walls of jericho then to
[58:18] anything
[58:20] when god has freed you from sin what is
[58:23] anything then before you
[58:27] because now inside of you is the very
[58:30] deity of almighty god the very one that
[58:34] created the devil you've got the one
[58:36] inside of you who's greater than every
[58:39] devil who's greater than every demon
[58:41] who's greater than every wall of jericho
[58:44] [Applause]
[58:46] you can label those walls of jericho
[58:47] however you want to label them cancer
[58:49] disease and whatever you want to do
[58:52] but the god in you is greater
[58:55] notice this your terror
[58:58] and because of you
[59:00] for we have heard
[59:01] how the lord dried up the water of the
[59:03] red sea
[59:05] for you
[59:06] when you came out of egypt and what you
[59:08] did unto the two kings of amorites were
[59:10] that were on the other side of jordan
[59:12] scion and og whom you utterly destroyed
[59:15] and as soon as we had heard these things
[59:18] our hearts did melt
[59:20] neither did there remain any more
[59:22] courage in any man
[59:25] what's this say
[59:27] because of you
[59:30] now i thought it was god who was doing
[59:31] it
[59:32] right
[59:33] it is god who was doing it but god
[59:36] operates and proves his word through
[59:40] believers
[59:43] believers are channels that are reserved
[59:48] for god to manifest his word through
[59:52] god is a supernatural god everything he
[59:55] does is supernatural
[59:58] it's a paradox
[1:00:01] think of this because of you
[1:00:04] so it's them walking
[1:00:06] and they are identifying with god as god
[1:00:10] is opening away they're identifying with
[1:00:12] it god opens another way they're
[1:00:14] identifying with it you know what it is
[1:00:16] it's allowing god then to move through
[1:00:19] their lives yet even at this point
[1:00:23] they're not fully identified
[1:00:25] with the living god
[1:00:27] but they're in the right direction
[1:00:30] they're on the right pathway you see
[1:00:31] because god the bible didn't say that
[1:00:33] enoch hopped with god enoch jumped with
[1:00:36] god enoch skipped with god the bible
[1:00:38] says enoch what
[1:00:40] walked with god
[1:00:42] walked with god one foot
[1:00:45] in front of the other he walked with god
[1:00:50] that's the same way it is with a
[1:00:52] believer it's see every every every
[1:00:55] footstep is possession that belongs to
[1:00:57] you god has opened up that way now the
[1:01:01] bible says in deuteronomy 28 10 and all
[1:01:04] the people here was moses
[1:01:06] letting the people of god know and all
[1:01:09] the people of the earth shall see
[1:01:12] that thou art called by the name of the
[1:01:15] lord and they shall be afraid of thee
[1:01:20] is that right
[1:01:22] even when a person is baptized in the
[1:01:25] name of the lord jesus christ they are
[1:01:27] taking on his name
[1:01:31] is that right they begin to walk in his
[1:01:34] name they begin to the bible says let
[1:01:36] them that name the name of christ depart
[1:01:38] from iniquity
[1:01:39] they begin to walk in making footsteps
[1:01:42] and making possession and the holy
[1:01:44] spirit is working in that life it's
[1:01:46] cleansing that life it's a holy spirit
[1:01:48] bringing it along and you know sometimes
[1:01:51] where we get we get to looking at we we
[1:01:53] want to look for mile post markers but
[1:01:55] you know what mild post markers is the
[1:01:57] greatest discouragement that you could
[1:01:59] ever have to your christian walk but
[1:02:01] what you should do is look unto
[1:02:04] jesus who is the author and finisher of
[1:02:09] our faith
[1:02:10] and he that began the good work in you
[1:02:13] will perform it to the day of jesus
[1:02:16] christ
[1:02:17] [Applause]
[1:02:19] hallelujah
[1:02:20] because he is faithful
[1:02:24] and that he is faithful it's that same
[1:02:27] god that releases strength to you and i
[1:02:30] and brings faithfulness within our own
[1:02:32] lives i tell you what we'll never get
[1:02:35] anywhere with looking at our own self
[1:02:40] you know you can look in the word of god
[1:02:42] and as the words being preached you can
[1:02:44] look at the word and you know there's a
[1:02:46] shortcoming there that's a shortcoming
[1:02:47] there oh i need
[1:02:50] but instead of looking at it
[1:02:52] that there is grace sufficient to
[1:02:53] overcome
[1:02:55] there is grace sufficient to prevail
[1:02:58] god ain't speaking to put nobody down
[1:03:01] god's speaking to call you out
[1:03:06] it's grace sufficient for the challenge
[1:03:09] of the hour
[1:03:11] amen they shall see that thou art called
[1:03:14] by the name of the lord you know why the
[1:03:16] inhabitants were scared
[1:03:18] how many read in the bible where god
[1:03:20] told them in exodus 15 he said i'll send
[1:03:23] hornets
[1:03:24] before you
[1:03:26] what do hornets do sting
[1:03:28] what was that saying the angel of the
[1:03:31] lord shall go before thee
[1:03:35] my angel in whom my name rests
[1:03:40] why see look if the people of god would
[1:03:43] have just stopped right there and said
[1:03:45] well you know i praise god here we are
[1:03:47] up to the jordan there would have been
[1:03:49] testimonies up to that of the jordan but
[1:03:52] remember
[1:03:53] it was one thing for the red sea to be
[1:03:55] opened but it's another thing to see
[1:03:57] that that same god that opened it 40
[1:04:00] years ago is the same god right here
[1:04:04] that it's god who has made a way into
[1:04:06] the promise
[1:04:08] and it took courage from the people
[1:04:12] i'm talking about the inhabitants of the
[1:04:13] land
[1:04:15] but it was building faith
[1:04:18] in the hearts of god's children
[1:04:21] you see god could not cross into that
[1:04:24] land i refer to this the last time we
[1:04:26] ministered god could not cross
[1:04:29] over into the land with unbelievers
[1:04:33] you see this is why god's not interested
[1:04:35] in debating
[1:04:36] god don't debate
[1:04:40] you know even when brother bosworth
[1:04:42] wanted to go down there that wasn't a
[1:04:43] debate
[1:04:44] brother brandon wanted one to stop
[1:04:45] brother bosworth that wasn't a debate
[1:04:48] he went down there to stand now think of
[1:04:50] this brother bosworth asked one question
[1:04:54] but that question was a platform
[1:04:57] that the angel of the lord came down
[1:05:01] are you hearing me now it was one who
[1:05:03] could say that it'll answer this
[1:05:05] question is
[1:05:07] jehovah of the old jesus of the new
[1:05:11] amen
[1:05:12] that question was a platform that
[1:05:14] invited the presence of almighty god to
[1:05:18] come down there in houston and vindicate
[1:05:22] his promised word in that hour let me
[1:05:24] tell you something brother bosworth was
[1:05:26] a very with a very astute man when you
[1:05:29] you read uh you know uh i think christ
[1:05:32] christ is our healer and you find how
[1:05:34] brother bosworth such a student of the
[1:05:36] word of god and more than a student
[1:05:38] brother bosworth believed in the
[1:05:39] supernatural he believed in the power of
[1:05:42] almighty god a matter of fact brother
[1:05:43] bosworth would take a chair and he would
[1:05:45] sat down on the platform he says i'm not
[1:05:47] getting up till everyone is healed
[1:05:51] he knew that god was the god of his word
[1:05:53] and yet brother bosworth was the one
[1:05:55] sitting next to brother level and when
[1:05:57] that began to operate brother bosworth
[1:05:59] had been in the meetings over and over
[1:06:00] and brother bosworth looked over and he
[1:06:02] said this is what i've been waiting on
[1:06:05] it was promised in the word of god that
[1:06:08] god would send this ministry at the end
[1:06:11] time you see brother bosworth was able
[1:06:13] to identify it's something he was
[1:06:16] waiting on oh my you see we are not as
[1:06:18] the children of god we don't get cabbage
[1:06:21] down or held down in one little part
[1:06:23] we're looking at going on with god as
[1:06:26] god would continue to reveal and unfold
[1:06:29] himself we will make footsteps after
[1:06:32] footstep after footstep why we are
[1:06:35] believers
[1:06:36] [Applause]
[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:39] i tell you every footstep you make with
[1:06:41] god will cause the devil to tremble
[1:06:43] it'll shake the gates of hell
[1:06:46] why because it's god making a way for
[1:06:48] his children
[1:06:51] hallelujah this is not man-making away
[1:06:54] it's god making a way
[1:06:58] man can make a way that maybe you'd fit
[1:07:00] in a church in a certain way and we'll
[1:07:02] do this for you we'll do this for you
[1:07:04] we'll do that for you but that ain't how
[1:07:06] god works god already knows who belongs
[1:07:10] in his church and god sends his word to
[1:07:13] seek out his children and the light
[1:07:15] begins to unfold and they make a step in
[1:07:18] water baptism and repentance they make a
[1:07:21] step in sanctification they make a step
[1:07:24] in the baptism of the holy ghost how god
[1:07:26] is opening the way
[1:07:29] and when god opens away and we'll make a
[1:07:32] step right there
[1:07:34] the angel of the lord that's leading us
[1:07:36] goes before us
[1:07:39] and when the enemy wants to raise his
[1:07:41] ugly head
[1:07:42] we can stand right there and say
[1:07:46] he that started the work in me
[1:07:48] will finish it
[1:07:53] and in the name of jesus christ i'm
[1:07:54] standing here not by my own strength
[1:07:57] not by my own doings i'm standing here
[1:08:00] by the grace of god that god has opened
[1:08:02] the way for me god's opened away from me
[1:08:05] god opens a channel of faith for you and
[1:08:07] i to be able to believe him for all
[1:08:10] things
[1:08:13] amen brother joseph says here i think
[1:08:15] god bless you
[1:08:16] amen good to have you here
[1:08:18] [Applause]
[1:08:22] god will do it through believers
[1:08:24] remember the rest of them they went over
[1:08:25] and spied out the land and remember
[1:08:28] before the 40 years had come they went
[1:08:30] over there the only thing they could
[1:08:31] come back and talking about was all the
[1:08:32] giants
[1:08:35] those are the kind of guys that you
[1:08:36] wanted to defend off your facebook page
[1:08:39] all they could talk about is that we
[1:08:41] cannots and we can't and we can't
[1:08:44] but joshua and caleb were in the
[1:08:45] minority
[1:08:47] ain't nothing wrong with being in a
[1:08:49] minority when god's on your side
[1:08:51] and when god's on your side if god be
[1:08:54] for us who can be against us
[1:08:58] when god's making a way tell me what
[1:09:00] devil can stand
[1:09:03] hallelujah
[1:09:04] oh my they came back talking about that
[1:09:07] but there was two that came back and
[1:09:09] they all they could talk about was the
[1:09:11] grapes they had the land of promise that
[1:09:13] promises exactly like god said what god
[1:09:16] promised our great great great great
[1:09:18] great great grandfather abraham what god
[1:09:20] made a promise there what he came
[1:09:22] through the message of moses i'm telling
[1:09:24] you it's just as true as true can be you
[1:09:26] know what that did when they focused on
[1:09:29] what the promise was it further released
[1:09:32] faith and a trust to believe god beyond
[1:09:35] every circumstance that was before him
[1:09:38] what was it the angel of the lord making
[1:09:41] a way
[1:09:43] who
[1:09:44] glory
[1:09:46] you see god crossed
[1:09:49] he crossed
[1:09:50] over jordan
[1:09:52] in his people
[1:09:56] god was walking right among them
[1:09:59] there ain't no man could cry could could
[1:10:01] not only part the jordan
[1:10:03] but it was dry
[1:10:05] you know how it is when it rains around
[1:10:07] here a little bit you go out there like
[1:10:08] a rain we had yesterday you go out there
[1:10:10] after just a little bit squishy squish
[1:10:12] squish
[1:10:14] right but when god dried up
[1:10:17] he parted the jordan it was dry let me
[1:10:20] tell you something when god makes a way
[1:10:22] he makes a way
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:25] he knows how to make a way
[1:10:28] he could have took him any other way you
[1:10:30] know he could have took him another way
[1:10:31] into the promised land but god remember
[1:10:34] you can't pass into the promised land
[1:10:36] without going through jordan and jordan
[1:10:39] is a type of dying to self when a life
[1:10:42] comes to that place and says i'm tired
[1:10:45] of being me like jacob said i'm tired of
[1:10:47] being jacob when he got to that spot
[1:10:50] then it was time for that man that was
[1:10:52] on the inside that israel that was there
[1:10:55] the whole time it was time for that man
[1:10:58] to be released
[1:10:59] what was it the angel of the lord making
[1:11:01] a way
[1:11:06] you're here and we're here to not
[1:11:07] believe and you know why because the
[1:11:08] angel the lord made away
[1:11:12] he made a way
[1:11:14] oh god crossed over through them you see
[1:11:16] ordained for this moment you see this is
[1:11:20] why when we look at it of being fully
[1:11:22] identified with the living god
[1:11:25] to think how that god
[1:11:27] i want you to think of this here
[1:11:29] has god parted
[1:11:31] the jordan
[1:11:32] and they crossed over into the promises
[1:11:35] of god
[1:11:36] what was happening
[1:11:38] it was
[1:11:39] a promise
[1:11:41] it was a message
[1:11:43] that god had given
[1:11:46] and that message is more
[1:11:48] than letter
[1:11:50] that message is a person
[1:11:53] and that person is the person of jesus
[1:11:57] christ
[1:11:58] are you hearing me now
[1:12:00] so here within that of the jordan when
[1:12:02] they were crossing the jordan what they
[1:12:05] are crossing into is where god said i'm
[1:12:08] sending you as he told moses to bring
[1:12:10] them out of the land
[1:12:12] of egypt and into
[1:12:14] the land that floweth with milk and
[1:12:16] honey because redemption is two parts
[1:12:19] we come out of the world
[1:12:21] and then we go into christ
[1:12:24] is that right so now here that message
[1:12:27] that was spoken what had been rehearsed
[1:12:30] down in the slime pits and everything
[1:12:31] else now that message it was beginning
[1:12:35] to unfold it was opening there was a
[1:12:37] sounding of that word that was going up
[1:12:39] now when moses crossed off the scene
[1:12:42] god didn't send another message
[1:12:45] but god had joshua on the scene grace
[1:12:49] had been there the whole time
[1:12:52] now it would take grace to open a way to
[1:12:55] where the message was no longer a letter
[1:12:58] but now the message became a place of
[1:13:01] dwelling it became a place
[1:13:04] where they could worship my mama it
[1:13:07] became a place that they could raise
[1:13:09] their children a place that they could
[1:13:11] dwell in a place where they could really
[1:13:15] be
[1:13:16] who they really were
[1:13:21] let me say this to you
[1:13:23] in the message proving his word
[1:13:26] brother bannon preaches it down there
[1:13:28] in jeffersonville
[1:13:29] brother branham identifies the promise
[1:13:32] when the spirit of god
[1:13:34] came down on the howe river
[1:13:36] pillar fire came down
[1:13:39] as they were baptizing that person
[1:13:42] and there out came a voice
[1:13:44] from the pillar fire that said as john
[1:13:46] the baptist was sent
[1:13:48] to forerun the first coming of jesus
[1:13:51] christ so shall your message
[1:13:55] forerun the second coming of jesus
[1:13:58] christ
[1:14:00] the lord jesus is not coming to be
[1:14:02] united with a church building
[1:14:04] he's coming to be united with the bride
[1:14:07] one that is born of his bone flesh of
[1:14:10] his flesh one that came from him he is
[1:14:14] coming to be united with his bride
[1:14:18] glory be to god
[1:14:20] and as the prophet could look around and
[1:14:22] he would compare the ohio river to the
[1:14:25] jordan river
[1:14:27] because remember what came down on the
[1:14:29] ohio river was the announcement of the
[1:14:32] message that would forerun the second
[1:14:34] coming of the lord
[1:14:36] now remember there is a coming we are
[1:14:39] looking for as far as the literal
[1:14:42] corporal body of the lord jesus christ
[1:14:45] right
[1:14:46] and right now we have received the
[1:14:49] appearing of the lord jesus christ he
[1:14:52] has come in the fulfillment of his word
[1:14:55] and the holy spirit standing right here
[1:14:58] among us and vindicating his word to do
[1:15:00] what build faith in the promise and make
[1:15:03] us ready for his coming
[1:15:06] so the same way that message it opened
[1:15:09] up the way
[1:15:10] so has the message of the hour that god
[1:15:14] has spoken it has opened the way
[1:15:17] and through the message of the hour
[1:15:20] which is jesus christ we cross into
[1:15:24] the promised land
[1:15:29] hallelujah
[1:15:31] where you and i think of it
[1:15:33] where people can read the bible and
[1:15:35] they're reading it according to man's
[1:15:37] understanding
[1:15:39] but notice how the anointing of the hour
[1:15:41] begins to move and what does it do it
[1:15:44] opens up and unfolds unseals the writing
[1:15:48] of the book it makes christ known to you
[1:15:51] and i what is it it's the way
[1:15:54] that's being made for you and i that we
[1:15:56] can enter in
[1:15:58] with boldness
[1:16:00] it's the blood going before us that's
[1:16:02] what the message is
[1:16:06] that's why i'm being fully identified
[1:16:09] this is why
[1:16:10] as all of them many had walked remember
[1:16:13] in in and up there in those before they
[1:16:16] rejected gordon the land many of them
[1:16:18] had walked around
[1:16:19] that of the message
[1:16:21] but then when it came to moving on into
[1:16:23] the promised land
[1:16:24] they said no no we can't do that our
[1:16:26] children you know we have to do this and
[1:16:27] our children and we can't all their
[1:16:30] giants are too big
[1:16:31] but you see
[1:16:32] there was something that was ordained to
[1:16:35] the promise
[1:16:36] you see it's like something that just
[1:16:37] kind of wet your appetite a little bit
[1:16:40] you know how it is when you
[1:16:41] you know you cook a little bit and
[1:16:42] especially if you get privileged to be
[1:16:44] the one that does the grilling
[1:16:45] everybody else in the house
[1:16:47] you go ahead and have you a hot dog
[1:16:48] before anybody else has one
[1:16:51] cut your little piece of steak off
[1:16:52] you're right
[1:16:53] i'm letting the cat out of the bag again
[1:16:56] you can look at that and say man that's
[1:16:57] good oh boy that needs a little bit of
[1:16:59] seasoning but you see these are things
[1:17:02] that whatever you all you did was taste
[1:17:03] it but then you never sat down and
[1:17:05] really ate it
[1:17:08] come on now but you see when i taste it
[1:17:12] when i taste it my goodness i can't wait
[1:17:14] i want to open that door and say hey is
[1:17:16] everything on the table it's about ready
[1:17:17] to come off
[1:17:19] why because i'm wanting to be fully
[1:17:22] united with what i've tasted
[1:17:24] [Applause]
[1:17:26] glory
[1:17:28] what i have tasted is so good i want to
[1:17:31] be fully united with it
[1:17:36] and that's how it is with jesus christ i
[1:17:38] have tasted of him and he is so good i
[1:17:42] want to be fully united with jesus
[1:17:45] christ i want him to be the lord of my
[1:17:48] life i want him to be over everything in
[1:17:51] my life
[1:17:53] hallelujah
[1:17:54] we're not just sympathizers
[1:17:59] like a man would look at a woman say you
[1:18:00] know she make a good wife and everything
[1:18:02] else and checking off all the boxes and
[1:18:04] everything else we're not sympathizers
[1:18:07] you could go along with that all day
[1:18:09] long but until you take her and she
[1:18:11] becomes your wife
[1:18:13] brother says that's the way the message
[1:18:15] of the hour is
[1:18:17] you can sympathize with it
[1:18:19] well it's pretty good it's all right
[1:18:21] but until
[1:18:23] you take it personal
[1:18:25] and when you take it personally become
[1:18:26] fully identified then listen to me now
[1:18:29] this just don't just let this be a quote
[1:18:32] but now the same anointing
[1:18:34] is with you as it is with others
[1:18:37] this message is the anointing of the
[1:18:40] messiah upon the children of the living
[1:18:44] god
[1:18:45] this ain't a man's spirit
[1:18:48] man's spirit get on you you act like
[1:18:50] that man
[1:18:51] that's why these athletes and different
[1:18:53] ones they want to do everything like
[1:18:54] brother benny was pointing out everybody
[1:18:56] trying to jump from the foul line why
[1:18:57] getting the anointing of michael
[1:18:59] jordan's spirit on them
[1:19:01] right somebody want to shake their head
[1:19:03] a certain way or do they get an
[1:19:04] anointing of another spirit but brother
[1:19:07] when the anointing of the messiah which
[1:19:09] is jesus christ it comes upon your life
[1:19:12] brother it makes you act like jesus
[1:19:15] christ it's an anointing upon your life
[1:19:18] let me tell you something even when
[1:19:20] you're sitting here and you're looking
[1:19:22] to the promise of the holy ghost it's
[1:19:25] the anointing of the messiah anointing
[1:19:28] you to believe the promise for your life
[1:19:32] boy i feel like preaching
[1:19:34] it's anointing you to believe the holy
[1:19:38] ghost's mind it's anointing you to rise
[1:19:41] up beyond all unbelief beyond everything
[1:19:45] oh my my mama
[1:19:48] you see it's a parallel resurrection
[1:19:52] the disciples they walked with the lord
[1:19:54] jesus
[1:19:55] i mean i mean
[1:19:57] they weren't the only ones that had ate
[1:19:59] fish
[1:20:00] bread
[1:20:02] they weren't the only ones who ate that
[1:20:03] there were many others
[1:20:04] they were they were there they seen them
[1:20:06] they seen the uh uh the miracles
[1:20:09] uh they they see no they were associated
[1:20:11] with them they were so associated with
[1:20:13] them
[1:20:14] to where when they took him
[1:20:16] here was peter standing there
[1:20:18] and one of the
[1:20:19] ladies in that time a woman came up to
[1:20:21] him and said ah
[1:20:23] you're one of them aren't you
[1:20:26] you're one of them you you one of his
[1:20:28] followers see they had been
[1:20:30] associated
[1:20:31] with the message
[1:20:34] come on they had an identity with the
[1:20:36] message but they weren't fully
[1:20:39] identified
[1:20:41] are you hearing me now
[1:20:43] you see how could they have an identity
[1:20:45] because they had walked in what god had
[1:20:49] opened
[1:20:51] up to that part
[1:20:52] how many know there was prophecy that
[1:20:54] the bible said in zechariah smith the
[1:20:56] shepherd and the sheep will be scattered
[1:20:58] you see the disciples didn't know that
[1:21:00] that scripture had to be fulfilled
[1:21:02] right
[1:21:03] but here they were there was an
[1:21:05] association
[1:21:06] but once he rose on that third day
[1:21:10] here came the shepherd looking for his
[1:21:13] sheep
[1:21:14] just because peter had denied him did
[1:21:17] not change his status from a sheep to a
[1:21:20] golf he was still a sheep
[1:21:22] [Applause]
[1:21:24] oh hallelujah he was always a shape
[1:21:28] andrew was a sheep bartholomew was a
[1:21:30] sheep every one of them were sheep
[1:21:33] but they needed the shepherd
[1:21:37] and when the shepherd came
[1:21:39] he began to draw them back together why
[1:21:42] because they had to come fully into the
[1:21:46] promise
[1:21:47] to be fully identified with him
[1:21:50] i want you to think about this the word
[1:21:52] was not ashamed when it rose on that
[1:21:55] easter morning and said good gracious
[1:21:57] peter i'm s i'll tell you what how in
[1:22:00] the world man could you do what you did
[1:22:03] you just you dis disowned me it had
[1:22:06] already been prophesied before the croc
[1:22:09] crows three times you will have already
[1:22:11] denied me
[1:22:13] you see the word is identifying present
[1:22:16] actions
[1:22:18] but the word is not removing who he
[1:22:21] really was
[1:22:23] he was always a sheep
[1:22:25] he needed leadership out of that
[1:22:28] condition
[1:22:30] it would take the resurrected lord jesus
[1:22:33] christ the great shepherd to come
[1:22:35] amongst his children
[1:22:41] he began to
[1:22:42] you tell peter that i'm
[1:22:44] i'm rose i want you to tell my disciple
[1:22:46] and i want you to tell peter
[1:22:50] peter you know probably was
[1:22:52] lower than the padding under this carpet
[1:22:56] good lord how could i have done this how
[1:22:58] could i have done this peter it was
[1:22:59] already identified you were going to do
[1:23:01] it but you see what was happening the
[1:23:03] word was able to identify what was
[1:23:05] laying there
[1:23:07] and when the word it carried a personal
[1:23:10] invitation let me tell you something the
[1:23:12] word comes with a personal invitation
[1:23:16] for our life
[1:23:18] it's the word that calls your name
[1:23:21] it's not a man that calls your name it's
[1:23:24] the word that speaks beneath all the
[1:23:26] darkness and all the muck and all the
[1:23:29] sin and all the unbelief it's god coming
[1:23:32] after his sheep
[1:23:35] oh i know we all acted like pigs and
[1:23:37] everything else but down on the inside
[1:23:39] was a sheep that needed to be led
[1:23:44] into a place of life
[1:23:46] who could do that but the angel of the
[1:23:48] lord
[1:23:49] the great shepherd
[1:23:51] in whom dwells the name of the lord
[1:23:54] and would begin to open away oh that
[1:23:56] ought to give you confidence
[1:23:59] every step along the journey should give
[1:24:01] you confidence for the next step
[1:24:04] over the samuel i'm already in the land
[1:24:06] then you ought to have such confidence
[1:24:08] that even when there's walls that are so
[1:24:10] thick where they could drive chariots on
[1:24:13] like that of jericho it ought to give
[1:24:15] you such confidence to say that my god
[1:24:18] that's living on the inside of me he
[1:24:21] brought down walls that were bigger than
[1:24:22] that he brought down things that was
[1:24:25] walled in why what did he do he comes in
[1:24:28] and he's dealt with complexes in your
[1:24:30] life strongholds in your life he's dealt
[1:24:32] with pain he's dealt with hurt oh my
[1:24:35] what can stand before him
[1:24:37] [Applause]
[1:24:40] parallel what a parallel time they have
[1:24:42] been associated with the message but oh
[1:24:44] my
[1:24:45] after pentecost
[1:24:47] they were identified
[1:24:51] he was no longer twain
[1:24:53] like two people on an altar these two
[1:24:56] had become one
[1:24:59] hallelujah why because god
[1:25:02] had made a way
[1:25:05] let me just try to bring this down
[1:25:06] because there's no way i'm going to get
[1:25:07] to what we
[1:25:08] thought we're going to get through
[1:25:09] tonight
[1:25:10] but i want you to think about this
[1:25:13] in joshua chapter five let's read just a
[1:25:15] few more verses of scripture here
[1:25:16] tonight
[1:25:17] maybe just lay a foundation the lord
[1:25:19] willing for next
[1:25:20] thursday night here
[1:25:23] but i want you to think about this
[1:25:25] the stones you see
[1:25:27] we we can look at types of those stones
[1:25:30] that come up out of the jordan they were
[1:25:32] brought up out of the jordan and there
[1:25:34] were other stones that took the place of
[1:25:36] where those stones were at
[1:25:38] and we know that we
[1:25:41] deserved
[1:25:43] hell
[1:25:46] we deserved it
[1:25:48] you see this is why that even before
[1:25:51] uh calvary
[1:25:52] there was paradise
[1:25:54] paradise was not hell
[1:25:56] but paradise was a place that they were
[1:25:58] waiting all of the the believers that
[1:26:01] had been down through time that were
[1:26:03] walking by revelation and offering up
[1:26:06] the lamb of god you see they were there
[1:26:08] in paradise it meant something it was
[1:26:11] not church to them or it wasn't just
[1:26:13] doing things because daddy did it and
[1:26:16] mama did it and so and so did it it was
[1:26:18] something that was personal to them that
[1:26:20] when they they could believe god and and
[1:26:22] be able to stand there upon their
[1:26:25] sacrifice no matter how they felt no
[1:26:27] matter what it looked like think about
[1:26:28] job when job was being accused all
[1:26:32] around
[1:26:33] job was able to stand
[1:26:35] flat-footed
[1:26:37] on the sacrifice how could he stand
[1:26:40] there like that because god had revealed
[1:26:43] it to joe personally
[1:26:45] oh it might have been something that a
[1:26:48] daddy or mama would instruct their son
[1:26:50] but it had to come to a time to where it
[1:26:52] was no longer daddy's god and mama's god
[1:26:56] but it became my god
[1:26:59] it can't be the prophet's god the
[1:27:01] pastor's god he wants to be your god
[1:27:07] stones
[1:27:09] that come up out of there
[1:27:11] and i want you to think of this thought
[1:27:13] stones
[1:27:15] are decisions
[1:27:17] that are made
[1:27:19] in joshua 5 2 can i have just a few more
[1:27:21] moments
[1:27:22] in joshua chapter 5 verse 2 at that time
[1:27:25] the lord said unto joshua
[1:27:27] make thee
[1:27:29] sharp knives
[1:27:31] and circumcise again the children of
[1:27:34] israel the second time
[1:27:36] now here was this here was the group
[1:27:39] that had not even been circumcised in
[1:27:41] the wilderness
[1:27:43] that was essential
[1:27:46] that's identifying you in the abrahamic
[1:27:49] covenant
[1:27:50] that's a sign
[1:27:53] and god seen they needed this sign
[1:27:58] right so here they are they crossed over
[1:28:01] the jordan
[1:28:03] dying to self
[1:28:04] and they're in a place now that god
[1:28:07] would tell joshua make
[1:28:09] sharp knives
[1:28:11] to circumcise again the children of
[1:28:13] israel the second time
[1:28:16] and joshua made him sharp knives and
[1:28:19] circumcised the children of israel at
[1:28:21] the hill of the foreskins and the lord
[1:28:23] said unto joshua
[1:28:25] this day
[1:28:26] have i rode away the reproach of egypt
[1:28:29] from off to you
[1:28:30] wherefore the name of the place is
[1:28:32] called gilgal unto this day
[1:28:36] let me just say it like this
[1:28:37] gilga
[1:28:39] is the starting point
[1:28:41] gilgal is the place of trajectory in
[1:28:44] other words where you move forward from
[1:28:47] because gilgal is the place after you've
[1:28:50] crossed the jordan you've died to
[1:28:52] yourself now gilgal becomes grounds
[1:28:56] where you can start and you can stand
[1:28:58] upon
[1:29:00] are you with me it was that gilgal that
[1:29:03] elisha
[1:29:05] moved from a place of just associating
[1:29:08] with elijah being identified with him
[1:29:11] remember how he was walking and elijah
[1:29:13] could say you just stay right here i'm
[1:29:15] going to go on elijah said you ain't
[1:29:17] leaving me here
[1:29:19] i'm going where you're going
[1:29:22] and then a good thing another step you
[1:29:24] just stay right here no no no
[1:29:26] you're not leaving me here i'm going
[1:29:27] where are you going you know why because
[1:29:30] elisha listen to me now when elijah came
[1:29:33] by elisha he simply just threw the
[1:29:37] mantle on him and he moved it away what
[1:29:40] is the mantle the mantle is the
[1:29:42] anointing of the holy ghost
[1:29:47] it wasn't words that stirred up elisha
[1:29:50] elijah came by one who had the mantle
[1:29:54] upon his life and he places it upon
[1:29:56] elisha and justin he just brings it
[1:29:59] right around and elisha knew at that
[1:30:02] moment the holy ghost has touched my
[1:30:06] life
[1:30:07] and at that moment he made a decision
[1:30:10] this is it no more plowing here
[1:30:13] no more this anymore i'm following you
[1:30:17] what do you want i want a double portion
[1:30:20] of that spirit
[1:30:21] [Applause]
[1:30:23] i want what has touched my life
[1:30:27] what came to me and caused the decision
[1:30:30] to move from this field i want that
[1:30:33] double portion
[1:30:41] elisha didn't have one eye over here and
[1:30:43] one on elijah
[1:30:46] it was single
[1:30:49] and he kept walking
[1:30:52] god was making away
[1:30:55] think of it
[1:30:56] the word would say you can stay right
[1:30:58] here
[1:30:58] but elisha said no
[1:31:01] i got a greater promise than just this
[1:31:04] i got more of a promise than just he is
[1:31:06] a savior and the forgiveness of my sin
[1:31:09] i've got a promise of the holy ghost
[1:31:12] i've got a promise he's a sanctifier
[1:31:14] i've got a promise that he's a seal i
[1:31:16] have a promise and that's what i'm
[1:31:18] longing for
[1:31:21] gilga
[1:31:23] is a starting point
[1:31:26] how many times let me just try to
[1:31:29] just try now to bring this down here for
[1:31:31] just it's hard to try to find a stopping
[1:31:33] point because there ain't no stopping
[1:31:34] point
[1:31:36] sometimes you look at things you think
[1:31:37] well
[1:31:38] move through this thought right here and
[1:31:40] man i just i'm trumping at the bit to
[1:31:42] get into it and
[1:31:43] here we are
[1:31:46] 45 minutes later and where are we at
[1:31:49] but lord jesus it's been good
[1:31:53] not me no not me but lord it's been good
[1:31:56] the things that god's unfolding
[1:31:59] brother how many times that brother
[1:32:00] branham would tell people over and over
[1:32:01] in the prayer line you can look this up
[1:32:03] on your own he said
[1:32:05] you're standing here tonight because
[1:32:07] you've always wanted a place
[1:32:10] that you could put your foot
[1:32:13] and start from
[1:32:15] and he said tonight's
[1:32:17] your night
[1:32:19] a place that you can put your foot
[1:32:22] where god has dealt with your heart
[1:32:24] god has dealt with your life sometimes
[1:32:27] that's where our lives and hearts need
[1:32:29] they need a strength from god to come
[1:32:32] along
[1:32:33] and give them courage to put down a
[1:32:36] footstep
[1:32:38] and say he is my savior
[1:32:41] he is my lord and i believe he's my
[1:32:43] redeemer
[1:32:44] i am not resting until i am united fully
[1:32:47] with him why because it's his desire
[1:32:51] moving
[1:32:52] upon my life
[1:32:57] a starting point that we can place
[1:32:59] our foot
[1:33:01] upon
[1:33:02] let me just close with this
[1:33:05] stones themselves are confessions
[1:33:11] many times as we
[1:33:13] can hear
[1:33:14] where a confession starts and a
[1:33:16] confession is a wonderful thing
[1:33:18] when a person can
[1:33:19] begin and repent of their sins and make
[1:33:22] a confession and i confess as paul would
[1:33:25] say confess the lord jesus christ
[1:33:27] believe that he has rose from the grave
[1:33:32] raised up and he's ascended up
[1:33:34] confess with thy mouth thou shalt be
[1:33:36] saved and a confession is a starting
[1:33:38] point you're hearing me
[1:33:41] remember enoch walked with god didn't
[1:33:43] hop with god didn't skip with god
[1:33:45] he walked
[1:33:50] stones are confessions
[1:33:53] think how god brought those stones up
[1:33:54] out of the water
[1:33:56] it was confessions
[1:33:58] it were decisions
[1:34:00] that were made
[1:34:02] you know we sing that song i have
[1:34:03] decided to follow jesus
[1:34:06] you you know like brother benny he
[1:34:07] quoted that of winston churchill
[1:34:10] if a person can't change their mind then
[1:34:11] you can't change nothing
[1:34:15] and remember where decisions are made
[1:34:16] they're made in the mind
[1:34:18] and that's also the battlefield
[1:34:22] can i preach as it's coming
[1:34:24] the mind is no man's land
[1:34:27] so you know what that means it's going
[1:34:29] to be filled with something
[1:34:31] are you hearing me now
[1:34:33] oh the devil just feeling like this let
[1:34:34] me tell you something if we put a bunch
[1:34:37] of pianos up here there's all kinds of
[1:34:39] room up here right now but if we put a
[1:34:40] bunch of boxes and everything else and
[1:34:42] things pretty soon you can look and say
[1:34:44] there ain't room for nothing
[1:34:46] that's how we ought to feel our mind
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:51] come on friends
[1:34:53] that's a no man's land we should fill
[1:34:55] our mind with the things of god oh
[1:34:58] brother samuel i want to fill my heart
[1:35:00] you can't bypass the mind and get it to
[1:35:02] your heart
[1:35:04] it starts there and it comes in through
[1:35:06] the channel of the mind and it drops
[1:35:08] down
[1:35:09] because let me tell you if you don't
[1:35:11] feel it with the things of god the devil
[1:35:13] will
[1:35:14] and he won't fill it with the things of
[1:35:16] god he'll try to fill it try to turn the
[1:35:18] word on you he'll try to fill it with
[1:35:19] all sorts of stuff what's he trying to
[1:35:21] do drag you down
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:27] but that's no man's land but let's just
[1:35:28] fill it up let's fill it up with god
[1:35:32] let's fill it up with god
[1:35:37] hallelujah
[1:35:38] oh my that's why i'm listening to the
[1:35:40] message of the hour that's why as we
[1:35:43] read the bible that's why listening to
[1:35:45] good gospel music that's why staying in
[1:35:48] a real atmosphere what is it it's
[1:35:50] choices that i'm gonna fill my life with
[1:35:53] the things of god
[1:35:56] sure that's another message in itself
[1:35:58] but man
[1:36:02] but you see
[1:36:03] there's got to be
[1:36:05] a cutting of that stone
[1:36:08] brother bran says what good is there
[1:36:10] is a stone if there isn't a stone mason
[1:36:12] there to shape him into a son of god
[1:36:15] see you've taken that stone and then
[1:36:17] it's it's honing away it's cutting away
[1:36:20] the things of the world
[1:36:22] it's not the man you see a man could
[1:36:25] tell you and you know we could pull you
[1:36:27] aside or pull this aside and say will
[1:36:29] you stop doing this and you stop doing
[1:36:30] that now i believe the word comes across
[1:36:32] the pulpit it's a discerner i believe
[1:36:34] the holy spirit as it comes across it's
[1:36:36] the holy spirit that is the sword of the
[1:36:39] lord and what he's coming to do he's not
[1:36:42] come to injure us he's coming to cut out
[1:36:46] sons and daughters of god
[1:36:48] you know everything that michelangelo
[1:36:50] cut
[1:36:51] on that statue of moses everything he
[1:36:54] cut away was that which was not part of
[1:36:58] that image
[1:36:59] and god brings his word what's he doing
[1:37:02] because inside of you inside of me is a
[1:37:05] son and daughter of god and there's only
[1:37:08] one thing that can liberate a son and
[1:37:10] daughter of god and that's the sword of
[1:37:14] the lord
[1:37:17] to cut us
[1:37:18] into sons and daughters of god
[1:37:30] honey i hope it's all right
[1:37:33] she's probably saying dear lord what's
[1:37:34] he going to say
[1:37:38] and one night we sat down i don't know
[1:37:40] if his chicken or steak or whatever
[1:37:43] maybe i think probably chicken breast
[1:37:44] will eat a lot
[1:37:47] she said down and you know i've got to
[1:37:48] have i have to have a knife
[1:37:50] and my wife she had these butter knives
[1:37:52] laying there
[1:37:53] you know because we had used all the
[1:37:55] steak knives
[1:37:58] hey we usually always have steak knives
[1:38:00] here we had this butter knife i said
[1:38:02] what's this
[1:38:03] this this is what what's the cut your
[1:38:06] chicken butter knife
[1:38:08] see look it's got serrated edges

[1:38:15] you know what i mean when you cut
[1:38:16] chicken i don't want the chicken to look
[1:38:17] like this
[1:38:19] when i when i cut it i want pieces that
[1:38:21] i don't have like you know like a like
[1:38:23] like a squid all over
[1:38:26] and i say that because of this
[1:38:29] god has not given his church butter
[1:38:32] knives
[1:38:34] because a better knife won't cut sons
[1:38:37] and daughters of god
[1:38:39] a better naphthouse were smearing butter
[1:38:41] a better night for putting jelly on you
[1:38:43] but the sword of the lord is for catting
[1:38:46] away everything that's unlike god and
[1:38:49] let me tell you as a son and daughter of
[1:38:52] god you are an offspring of god and god
[1:38:55] knows how to cut away everything that's
[1:38:58] unlike a son and daughter of god
[1:39:03] we ain't got no denominational butter
[1:39:05] knife
[1:39:12] good thing my wife is as sweet as she is
[1:39:13] huh
[1:39:15] god didn't give us no butter knife you
[1:39:17] can't cut nothing away with butter knife
[1:39:20] only thing a butter knife is make oh
[1:39:21] good members and butter them up and
[1:39:23] sugar them up and coat them up we're not
[1:39:26] interested in coating this up because i
[1:39:28] don't care what kind of home you came
[1:39:29] out of i don't care who you are i don't
[1:39:31] care if you were raised in this message
[1:39:33] i don't care if you know every quote if
[1:39:35] you know every scripture you still have
[1:39:38] to meet jesus christ in a personal area
[1:39:44] i don't matter if you were so good that
[1:39:45] nobody could put a finger on your life
[1:39:48] you must be born again
[1:39:51] it takes the holy spirit
[1:39:54] taking the word
[1:39:56] that has been promised
[1:39:59] and it raises it from a letter
[1:40:02] to a sharp
[1:40:04] two-headed sword
[1:40:06] where it's a word that you're just not
[1:40:08] reading but you're experiencing that
[1:40:10] word
[1:40:12] as it's going through your life
[1:40:15] it's moving through your life has a
[1:40:17] sharp two-edged sword

[1:40:21] he's setting sons and daughters of god
[1:40:23] free
[1:40:25] he's shaping us
[1:40:27] into his image
[1:40:29] let's pray

[1:45:45] fight it's worth fighting for
[1:45:47] it's worth fighting for
[1:45:49] god did not say when you come into the
[1:45:51] land or coming up to it
[1:45:53] and think about it what they faced was
[1:45:55] giants
[1:45:57] what they saw over there was giants
[1:46:00] god then there wasn't people in that
[1:46:02] land that was you know puny and short
[1:46:04] and everything else but notice what was
[1:46:07] there that stood out to those other ten

[1:46:11] going to wipe everything out
[1:46:13] y'all just walk on in
[1:46:15] but god could say it was a testimony
[1:46:19] that i'm the same god who parted the red
[1:46:21] sea
[1:46:22] and you walked on dry ground tell me
[1:46:24] when that's ever been before

[1:47:03] to rehearse you know sometimes you have
[1:47:05] to rehearse where god brought you from
[1:47:08] you've got to remember it's god that
[1:47:11] opened the way
[1:47:12] it's god that brought me where i'm at
[1:47:14] and the same god that brought me right
