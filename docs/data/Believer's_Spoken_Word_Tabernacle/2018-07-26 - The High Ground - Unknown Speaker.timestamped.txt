[39:09] hearts and our lives more this evening
[39:12] Lord Jesus is not a meeting Lord that's
[39:17] just a time that we set aside but it's a
[39:22] desire of hunger Lord in our hearts more
[39:26] to hear from you
[39:28] Lord when we love to be able to see one
[39:31] another but our main purpose Lord as we
[39:34] come together as Lord Jesus that you

[39:46] flesh we do not trust in ourselves we
[39:49] trust in you some father every thought
[39:54] in all things we defer it to you we

[40:58] in the name of Jesus Christ amen you
[41:04] love him tonight would you turn with me
[41:07] to Ephesians chapter 6
[41:34] I'm just gonna read just a portion of
[41:37] this reading verse 10 is where we will
[41:40] start
[41:48] finally my brethren be strong in the
[41:52] Lord and in the power of his mind and
[41:57] put on the horror of God that you may be
[42:02] able to stand against the wiles of the
[42:05] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[42:12] and blood but against principalities
[42:17] against powers against the rulers of the
[42:22] darkness of this world against spiritual
[42:26] wickedness in high places verse 12 I
[42:32] think it's very clear we're not up
[42:35] against human battles this is a
[42:40] spiritual warfare verse 13 wherefore
[42:47] take unto you the whole armour of God
[42:50] that ye may be able to withstand in the
[42:54] evil day and having done all to stand
[43:02] may God bless his word and bless the
[43:05] reading bless you as you're being seated
[43:07] god bless you
[43:19] I want to speak here tonight on a
[43:24] thought just that struck my heart on the
[43:29] high ground the high ground Paul is
[43:35] speaking here you'll find that Paul is a
[43:39] Bible reader you know that Paul will
[43:40] speak of the armour of God even in the
[43:45] book of Romans and Paul will speak of it
[43:47] as being the armor of light and put on
[43:52] that armor of light and you realize that
[43:56] the armor of God when we look at it
[44:00] there many of the places within it which
[44:03] we did not read all the way down through
[44:05] there in going through those areas but
[44:09] most of the armor and armor that you
[44:11] have is that of it's for defensive
[44:15] purposes there's one there's one that is
[44:20] there that is very clear for the
[44:22] offensive and that's the sort of a
[44:24] spirit and when you look with this right
[44:29] here any person who would engage within
[44:33] or fight with in any type of battle
[44:37] position itself is always of the essence
[44:40] but the position is what is very
[44:43] important as a matter of fact many
[44:46] strategies have been adjusted have
[44:49] evolved down through time even with that
[44:53] of the different empires that have arose
[44:55] within the vision of Daniel that was
[45:01] interpreted of that dream of
[45:02] Nebuchadnezzar many of those empires
[45:04] when they conquered another Empire there
[45:09] was a changing of the tactics of how
[45:13] that they themselves would be able to
[45:15] outmaneuver outmaneuver the other
[45:18] opposing force so they would have to
[45:21] study that force and then they would
[45:23] have to figure out how that they
[45:26] themselves would be able to out
[45:29] outmaneuver that force
[45:31] and when you look at this I thought of
[45:36] this thought the the high ground many of
[45:38] these things when I was there even
[45:42] within that of Gettysburg there were
[45:44] some things that even on this angle of
[45:47] it that was so so pressing to my heart
[45:51] within this and so many things just to
[45:53] gathering even in this direction and you
[45:56] know I think back to it where you take
[46:00] for example when Israel went into the
[46:02] six-day war you take one by the name of
[46:06] Moshe Dayan and when he himself was
[46:10] preparing to lead Israel into battle
[46:13] Moshe Dayan went to that place of
[46:19] Jericho and he prayed there then Moshe
[46:24] Dayan he also went to the place where
[46:28] David had could feed defeated Goliath
[46:30] and he prayed there as well and he
[46:35] looked what he looked for is that the
[46:38] inspiration of those battles and what
[46:42] had taken place and how that those
[46:44] things had would be beneficial and how
[46:49] that truly he received inspiration and
[46:51] you know that when you look at it I was
[46:54] just looking at it early on Sunday
[46:56] morning when you take for example the
[46:58] different wars that have been fought and
[47:00] you compare the countries that have
[47:02] fought and looked at those that are the
[47:04] victors versus the flags of those who
[47:07] are defeated when you look back at that
[47:09] on the six-day war you see the lone flag
[47:13] of Israel as the victor and you see a
[47:16] multitude of flags of their of Nations
[47:19] that are in the defeated color as far as
[47:24] size as far as quantity as far as being
[47:28] how manned
[47:29] would be considered to be outmuscled
[47:32] Israel was all of the above but the
[47:35] difference was is that God was with them
[47:39] and I want to just just look at and in
[47:43] looking at this tonight when we look at
[47:46] inspiration brother Brian himself you
[47:48] know if you listen to the message at all
[47:51] brother branham takes many inspirations
[47:54] of things that have happened in very
[47:56] various battles and God would so direct
[48:01] him to place it in a spiritual context
[48:03] just an example where brother Branham
[48:06] would Roy it would be would speak to us
[48:09] even concerning Patton in different ones
[48:12] and I don't want to elaborate all of
[48:14] those different ones that he went
[48:16] through but yet he was able to gather
[48:19] inspiration of things that he had read
[48:21] and then when he himself was going
[48:22] through something he was able to apply
[48:25] that such as the very simple one with
[48:27] Patton where he said you know but the
[48:30] Brenham comes to a place and he says
[48:32] I've always been afraid of failure but
[48:35] the Lord dealt with him there in
[48:37] receiving the furtherance of his
[48:38] Commission of how that God had already
[48:41] confirmed it but he had to accept what
[48:44] God confirmed and once he accepted what
[48:47] God confirmed but the random then goes
[48:49] in and he opens up and he says I've
[48:51] always been afraid of that failure of
[48:54] failure he said but then he says what
[48:57] comes to my mind he said is that this
[48:59] isn't the message go tell he says that
[49:01] what comes to my mind is that of how
[49:03] that Patton himself said if I put a
[49:05] bullet in the gun and it fails to go off
[49:08] I will take that one out and I'll put
[49:10] another one in if that one fails to go
[49:12] off I'll take that one out and I'll put
[49:14] another one in you see what that whole
[49:18] part what was said upon a natural in
[49:20] applying to a war that had already taken
[49:23] place the Prophet brought that around
[49:26] inspired that this is God's Word and
[49:29] God's Word cannot fail faith in God's
[49:33] Word will stand there upon the front
[49:36] line in the midst of what would even
[49:40] seemingly be defeat but yet God's Word
[49:44] can't fail and we we look at these
[49:48] things of these inspirations and I I
[49:50] think of it of how that God and I want
[49:53] you to think of this for a moment of how
[49:55] that God Himself God made a promise so
[49:58] many promises through the word where his
[50:01] faithfulness to defend Israel you know
[50:04] many of maybe that go over in your mind
[50:06] and your heart right now too many for us
[50:08] to even cover but God made a promise
[50:10] that he would defend her God also made a
[50:15] promise that he himself would restore
[50:18] her through repentance and you know even
[50:21] after they had went away in Babylon it
[50:23] was God who said that he would bring
[50:25] them back
[50:26] he will also how God has said that in
[50:29] the book of Zechariah that he himself
[50:31] would pour out the spirit of grace and
[50:33] supplication upon those in Israel and
[50:36] you find that how within that he I want
[50:40] you to think of this of how that that
[50:42] has already been determined and set it's
[50:45] already been prophesied in God's Word
[50:47] but there must be people who are
[50:50] ordained within that promise that the
[50:53] spirit of grace and supplication would
[50:56] be poured out and in order and where
[50:59] that scripture is to be if let's say
[51:02] this represents those people then every
[51:05] one of those people of hooman is
[51:07] ordained for that promise must be in
[51:10] that place of where that promise of
[51:12] which they are a part of to happen they
[51:15] must be but remember the Prophet uses
[51:18] the simplicity of when you think back of
[51:21] even how that God will fulfill his word
[51:24] because when God gave a vision to the
[51:26] Prophet that was God's Word are you with
[51:30] me that's God's Word it's God it's God
[51:33] expressing of what is that which is
[51:36] certain and you must have faith within
[51:38] that and think of how that the Prophet
[51:41] do you remember in the in the different
[51:42] times where here he is setting in the
[51:45] house and he knows that this baby is to
[51:48] be healed that God has already spoken
[51:50] that that baby is to be healed and yet
[51:54] what happens is is that
[51:56] the Prophet himself which all of us have
[52:00] been there where we're in the sense of
[52:03] time the urgency the desire to see God's
[52:06] Word fulfilled and how that the Prophet
[52:09] moves takes up the baby and when he does
[52:12] that you know what takes place and
[52:13] actually the baby goes into convulsions
[52:15] it's worse I tell you every time when I
[52:19] read that and think of it I think God
[52:20] your grace that kept them from running
[52:23] him out of the house you know I mean you
[52:25] think of it in our but this is God's
[52:27] grace see even within it then the
[52:30] Prophet stepped back and he realized
[52:31] each one of these things must be in
[52:34] position and when it got in position
[52:36] then he could rise and act and authority
[52:40] and see it was God himself the whole
[52:42] time giving even the patience to the
[52:46] Prophet to wait on the fulfillment of
[52:48] the word then God steps right behind and
[52:51] the Prophet prays a very simple prayer
[52:54] but in that God this is this has been
[52:57] your this is your will and we know what
[52:59] takes place that child rises up and is
[53:03] healed and I and I look at this that
[53:06] within each one of these things coming
[53:08] into position you know there's a there's
[53:12] there's a book that I've read here just
[53:15] in different times throughout the years
[53:17] and it's called the lion hearts and it
[53:21] was given to me my father-in-law had
[53:23] given it to me and it's dealing with the
[53:25] early Zionists those who were called
[53:27] Zionists who returned into Israel it
[53:31] deals with the the raising up of that
[53:33] Hebrew language of what was completely
[53:36] lost and it goes into all of the of the
[53:39] miracle of that but it goes into these
[53:42] individuals that even prior to being
[53:46] drove back from there of the Holocaust
[53:48] how many of those who came in there in
[53:51] those times and the ways that they
[53:53] risked their life even of the man that I
[53:55] referred to earlier Moshe Dayan there
[53:58] were many times he spent in prison
[53:59] before he ever arose to what you and I
[54:02] know him for it's because of even those
[54:05] forces of how that they would press
[54:07] those men and
[54:08] and and so forth and we understand that
[54:11] if when you look at those individuals
[54:13] coming back into the land those are into
[54:17] all of those parts are necessary to even
[54:20] bring it to even where Israel has come
[54:23] today because right now within this we
[54:26] realize in this generation back there in
[54:29] 1947 when the Israel here becomes a
[54:31] nation all of those parts all of that
[54:34] when the Lord Jesus had even given that
[54:36] as a sign to be watching that watch
[54:39] watch the fig tree I want to just say it
[54:42] to you like this and I'm trying to get
[54:44] this point across these things just
[54:47] don't happen but it's God moving on all
[54:52] intra integral parts that are leading
[54:56] even up to that it isn't just something
[54:58] that just happens out of nowhere it's
[55:01] all parts coming together that lead up
[55:05] and move all together in a unison
[55:08] towards this I ask you when you think of
[55:11] and I know maybe you haven't read of
[55:13] some of that but what would possess a
[55:16] person to lay their life so much on the
[55:19] line to go right back in there in harm's
[55:22] way and would flight and all of those
[55:24] things what would do that you can't tell
[55:27] me that that's just human ingenuity or
[55:31] that it's just strong genetics I
[55:33] disagree with that I believe us all of
[55:36] my heart that it was influenced and
[55:40] inspiration that whereby it inspired
[55:43] those commits these things would begin
[55:46] to come into that place then to where
[55:49] everything is now it just doesn't happen
[56:00] God made it promise and when God has
[56:04] made a promise and they just just kind
[56:08] of move into this he fulfills his word
[56:12] let me just say it like this it's God
[56:15] always fulfilling his word it's God
[56:20] interpreting his word and God doesn't
[56:23] interpret his word just by speaking God
[56:27] interprets his word by manifesting it
[56:31] that's that's very clear and that we we
[56:34] understand that as believers so when God
[56:37] has made a promise there's only one that
[56:40] can fulfill that promise it has to be
[56:43] God fulfill that promise when God made a
[56:47] promise to deliver Israel
[56:50] it wasn't Moses that fulfilled that
[56:52] promise it was God that fulfilled it but
[56:56] God fulfilled it and he takes the agency
[56:59] an office there of man of whom was
[57:02] already predetermined within that
[57:05] promise when God spoke it but when God
[57:09] spoke it Moses's knowledge of it there
[57:12] was a conflict even though Moses was the
[57:16] man he was to be the messenger of the
[57:19] hour but there was a conflict and what
[57:22] had to take place is Moses himself had
[57:26] to come to a place of surrender and
[57:29] allow God who made the promise to
[57:32] operate the promise through him
[57:38] that's always that's God's greatest
[57:41] challenge so when God makes his promise
[57:49] he will fulfill his word by releasing
[57:53] the influence upon the hearts of men I
[57:59] want you to think of this upon the
[58:01] hearts of men then are either directly
[58:03] or seemingly indirectly tied to the
[58:07] promise let me just work with this a
[58:12] moment because all around the promise
[58:17] there when God has given a promise
[58:20] there's always opposition to that
[58:23] promise and to those who are identified
[58:27] in that promise by that promise
[58:32] persecution opposition all hell is
[58:36] against that working and that's what
[58:41] Satan's trying to stop is Satan's not
[58:45] concerned about the flesh and blood he's
[58:49] concerned with trying to prevent and
[58:52] stop the promise of God from coming to
[58:55] pass I want you to think about this for
[58:58] a moment
[58:59] Satan knows he can't stop it
[59:04] he knows that if you knew something was
[59:09] a lost hope or a lost cause I guarantee
[59:13] you and I probably would not be as
[59:15] adamant about certain things it's just
[59:19] like when you finally give up and call
[59:21] the plumber or you call somebody else or
[59:25] whatever more you finally realize you
[59:27] know what I've reached my end but Satan
[59:32] knows this and has known this he's known
[59:37] this in every age where the word has
[59:41] been raw has raised up and met him and
[59:44] confronted him he's all he's known this
[59:48] but yet he still can
[59:50] coming let me just say it like this
[59:57] there's advancements that the enemy
[1:00:01] would try to make in our lives
[1:00:04] and let me just say it like this let's
[1:00:06] just say this year of which previous
[1:00:09] years we have resisted and we have
[1:00:13] recognized it and overcome that but just
[1:00:16] because we've recognized it overcome it
[1:00:20] and gained the victory there does not
[1:00:22] mean that he's going to stop his
[1:00:24] advancement he keeps coming it's just
[1:00:29] the angle of which he comes he'll change
[1:00:33] it but he still comes with the same
[1:00:35] motive this is why that the Prophet
[1:00:41] would speak to us and a very a phrase
[1:00:47] within how can overcome and he speaks
[1:00:49] wrecking overcoming is recognizing the
[1:00:53] devil in every one of his tricks and
[1:00:58] then recognizing that the God in you is
[1:01:02] greater and there's so much that when we
[1:01:05] can look at this and and look into it
[1:01:09] that for a promise I want you to think
[1:01:11] for a moment and look at think of Cyrus
[1:01:15] here is Israel they've gone into
[1:01:18] captivity but before they ever went into
[1:01:21] captivity in Babylon in the book of
[1:01:24] Isaiah it's already wrote in Jeremiah
[1:01:29] it's already wrote of this visitation
[1:01:32] Cyrus his name is mentioned in the Book
[1:01:36] of Isaiah and yet Cyrus is not a
[1:01:40] believer he never became a believer but
[1:01:45] yet listen to me
[1:01:47] God calls him in the word my shepherd he
[1:01:52] calls him mine anointed
[1:01:56] what you think of this Cyprus was not
[1:01:59] anointed with an evil spirit but here
[1:02:02] the anointing of how God had already
[1:02:04] laid it within the word Cyrus was not a
[1:02:08] if we could say a direct part of one who
[1:02:12] left Babylon and went down into
[1:02:15] Jerusalem but he was a key part within
[1:02:19] it that when that inspiration broke you
[1:02:23] know how Cyrus stood there and Cyrus
[1:02:26] spoke as a man of authority in the very
[1:02:29] first chapter of Ezra and Cyrus says
[1:02:32] that has been commissioned and given me
[1:02:36] a charge by Almighty God he needs spoke
[1:02:43] with authority I am asked I'm gonna just
[1:02:45] look at this just for a moment I believe
[1:02:48] with all of my heart that there were
[1:02:52] believers remnant believers that were
[1:02:56] there in Babylon that even while they
[1:02:59] were in Babylon were living victorious
[1:03:03] I believe that Daniels Jew Daniel and
[1:03:06] the Hebrew children are just examples of
[1:03:09] this but yet within it there were those
[1:03:13] who also were looking to the fulfillment
[1:03:16] of the promise of which God had already
[1:03:19] made - Jeremiah I believe they were
[1:03:23] praying for that fulfillment remember
[1:03:26] there were others in the time when that
[1:03:28] word was in the place or the time and
[1:03:32] space of when that word was who was
[1:03:34] getting ready to be fulfilled of carried
[1:03:37] away in captivity there was such a rise
[1:03:39] and increase of false prophets with
[1:03:42] anointings that where they spoke peace
[1:03:45] peace peace I want you to catch this
[1:03:51] that whole thing rising a peace that
[1:03:54] message of peace it sounds like who
[1:03:57] would not want to hear that message of
[1:03:59] peace but it was in direct contradiction
[1:04:03] to what God had already said
[1:04:08] and think of it the believers down
[1:04:11] through time they had to stand there and
[1:04:14] judge between the prophets of Val and
[1:04:16] Micah they had to judge there between
[1:04:19] Moses and Balaam they had to judge there
[1:04:21] even in this even in this situation
[1:04:24] they're judging here between that of
[1:04:27] Jeremiah and Hananiah Jeremiah had and I
[1:04:31] wish it weren't to God as you're saying
[1:04:34] but you see here's the thing
[1:04:37] Jeremiah was prophesying under the very
[1:04:42] leadership of the Lord and he was
[1:04:45] calling the people back to the word and
[1:04:48] let him know this is where you drifted
[1:04:50] from the message of peace was not
[1:04:53] pointing them back that Hananiah was
[1:04:55] preaching was not pointing them back she
[1:04:57] wasn't correcting their wrong it wasn't
[1:05:00] pointing them to repent it wasn't in any
[1:05:02] of that it was just saying peace peace
[1:05:04] unto you and God is the Prince of Peace
[1:05:10] he is a God of peace he's a god full of
[1:05:14] grace he's the god of deliverer
[1:05:16] he's a healer and all of those
[1:05:18] attributes come and are manifest when
[1:05:21] the conditions of his word are met so
[1:05:24] indeed he is the God of peace and the
[1:05:27] peace that was of the elect was in that
[1:05:30] God will keep his word and after seventy
[1:05:34] years he will visit us and Cyrus was not
[1:05:42] so much a direct part as far as one who
[1:05:47] was going to return but it was like an
[1:05:49] indirect part and after all of this is
[1:05:53] accomplished on the rebuilding of the
[1:05:56] Temple in Jerusalem we're in that he
[1:05:59] speaks and you know we've labored on
[1:06:02] this and many times here not everybody
[1:06:05] rose up when Cyrus proclaimed who is it
[1:06:09] who's God among him whose spirit is
[1:06:11] stirred up who is it among you not all
[1:06:14] of Israel rose up
[1:06:16] now you might look at that and say well
[1:06:18] it was about them returning but God
[1:06:22] knows who he has in his mind for the
[1:06:26] return and God knows the intervals and
[1:06:30] the Junction's God did not need Nehemiah
[1:06:34] at first he needed Ezra are you with me
[1:06:40] because you don't build the walls
[1:06:43] without first setting up the temple you
[1:06:47] with me you don't deal with the gates
[1:06:50] until you get the soul converted because
[1:06:54] that's the temple of God my spirit is
[1:06:57] not his temple my body listen to me now
[1:07:00] this body is not the temple but his
[1:07:02] temple and Paul could say you're no you
[1:07:05] not your body is a temple of the Holy
[1:07:07] Ghost it's God dwelling in the holiest
[1:07:10] of Holies and his effects and influence
[1:07:14] and his life are felt through the other
[1:07:16] courts he dwells in that place that
[1:07:21] belongs to him so here as four steps
[1:07:26] after the priests of God a ready scribe
[1:07:28] the Bible says then so we find in all of
[1:07:33] these parts here that it's God moving
[1:07:37] upon or each one of them in how that
[1:07:41] they come back and how that their return
[1:07:43] and so with this right here it comes I
[1:07:50] come to a place that I think of this
[1:07:53] quote this quote has been something
[1:07:54] that's been very pressing on my heart
[1:07:56] for months now months I referred I
[1:07:58] referred it in here a few weeks ago and
[1:08:00] I referred to in many places but out of
[1:08:04] the message the breech brother brems
[1:08:07] says those seven horns was the seven
[1:08:10] churches the seven church age is because
[1:08:13] that was the lambs protection
[1:08:20] what he protected his rights with on
[1:08:23] earth was a god-sent group of people
[1:08:26] that's protected he says that horn on
[1:08:31] the land he goes into seven eyes are the
[1:08:33] seven messengers of the seven Church h7
[1:08:35] i7 seers so to have that of protection
[1:08:41] it speaks that there is powers there is
[1:08:46] a power at work there is a battle there
[1:08:50] is that which is present to try to undo
[1:08:53] and to try to take away or to try to add
[1:08:56] to but remember this is God's promise
[1:09:02] it's God that delivers this promise it's
[1:09:06] God overseeing this promise and so
[1:09:10] within this this protection the
[1:09:14] protection of his right God has reserved
[1:09:18] channels upon this earth that he has
[1:09:22] ordained that his rights are maintained
[1:09:25] you know it is his right he had he had
[1:09:30] the rights to the book of redemption
[1:09:34] he had the rights to that and here in
[1:09:38] this great sublime Act that the Prophet
[1:09:42] would call it in Revelations 5 wherein
[1:09:45] that the lamb comes forward to take that
[1:09:48] book of redemption and it's all speaking
[1:09:50] we're at a time of finishing up this is
[1:09:54] an ending time there's not going to be a
[1:09:57] continuation as far as another age this
[1:10:00] is the final Gentile age this is the
[1:10:05] final message
[1:10:06] the final outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:09] and him taking the book it's him
[1:10:13] claiming what he has rightfully paid the
[1:10:18] price for you see by the Holy Spirit
[1:10:22] coming through the word it has laid
[1:10:25] claim upon every one of his children
[1:10:29] down through the ages
[1:10:31] and when he lays claim listen to me now
[1:10:34] when the Holy Spirit coming through that
[1:10:36] word and the people are born of that
[1:10:40] word but the Spirit of God human because
[1:10:42] remember you're born of the water and of
[1:10:45] the spirit is that right the word and
[1:10:48] spirit so then it gives free course for
[1:10:52] the word to work within your life
[1:10:54] whatever that God has spoken it is God
[1:10:59] that brings that word to pass in the
[1:11:03] life of his believing children it's God
[1:11:07] that brings it to past by moving in our
[1:11:11] lives that whereby we are surrendered in
[1:11:16] full trust to him and he performs his
[1:11:21] word of promise God let listen God let
[1:11:26] Abraham's strength come to an end why
[1:11:34] did God do that God let it be known to
[1:11:37] you and I that was for you and I that
[1:11:41] example was for us with when we are
[1:11:44] standing in this time of the rapture and
[1:11:47] yet it's a time of the greatness of
[1:11:51] God's power and my how we have such to
[1:11:54] look forward to even moment by moment
[1:11:57] day by day that God's power is not
[1:12:01] diminishing but it is becoming greater
[1:12:06] are you with me and it's not going to
[1:12:08] become diminished it's come it's moving
[1:12:11] in the greater measure but I will I
[1:12:13] would assert this to you this evening is
[1:12:16] that it's God moving by his spirit
[1:12:20] bringing us into full surrender for his
[1:12:24] working because in reality it takes him
[1:12:28] to bring that about in our lives and
[1:12:30] when we think I'm fully surrendered
[1:12:33] that's when we're not but it's God who
[1:12:37] brings us to that place that Lord my
[1:12:39] trust is completely in you
[1:12:43] it's called doing that man can't do that
[1:12:47] but remember it's God doing it and God
[1:12:50] is the word and the word creates an
[1:12:53] atmosphere the word creates an
[1:12:55] atmosphere just like Genesis one in
[1:12:57] order to bring forth what he has already
[1:13:00] saw it's God's Word
[1:13:07] you are his workmanship I am his
[1:13:11] workmanship
[1:13:13] so he's protecting his rights which his
[1:13:18] rights here his rights he's maintaining
[1:13:22] his rights and I want you to think of
[1:13:23] this and think of it very deeply his
[1:13:26] rights is his coming his word its
[1:13:32] protecting remember his question will I
[1:13:36] find faith when I return is ask the
[1:13:43] question will I find faith when I return
[1:13:45] but remember just as every part has to
[1:13:50] be where it's at God releases the
[1:13:53] influence that is needed to bring every
[1:13:58] part into its place I'll just say it
[1:14:01] like this if I had a decision to make
[1:14:03] tonight I would be resting on the Holy
[1:14:06] Spirit to give me the influence what I
[1:14:10] needed and how to direct me in that
[1:14:12] decision I would not limit any decision
[1:14:16] tonight and say well this was a very
[1:14:18] natural decision but I believe as
[1:14:20] believers we want God to be the lord of
[1:14:23] all of our lives
[1:14:24] of all that even that he would want for
[1:14:28] us if it's things within the natural to
[1:14:30] allow God to direct us of where that we
[1:14:34] ought to be or what it is that we ought
[1:14:36] to have or the decision whatever it is
[1:14:38] Lord you direct me in other words I'm
[1:14:40] not big enough to make this decision on
[1:14:43] my own but Lord I'm trusting you to
[1:14:47] influence me because there's one thing
[1:14:49] that I want to do is see your kingdom
[1:14:52] advance in my life
[1:14:54] I don't want to make decisions Lord that
[1:14:57] removed me from the position that I'm to
[1:15:01] be in because those who are alive and
[1:15:08] remain the rites of the lamb is his word
[1:15:14] and his word is the prophecy of the book
[1:15:21] what's been wrote down through the time
[1:15:25] and I've said like this we are brought
[1:15:28] into a redemptive partnership with Jesus
[1:15:32] Christ by the Holy Ghost
[1:15:38] a word as Paul could express it like
[1:15:43] this where he could say unto us has been
[1:15:47] committed a word of reconciliation
[1:15:52] listen to me a word that not only calls
[1:15:55] you out but a word that'll take you into
[1:16:03] something that doesn't leave you in
[1:16:05] limbo but brings you fully all the way
[1:16:14] this Antichrist spirit we mentioned this
[1:16:21] on Sunday that Antichrist spirit it's
[1:16:25] not as not just newly as of recent
[1:16:29] entered in John led by the Spirit of God
[1:16:35] put the people of God on notice that
[1:16:39] that Antichrist that which you have
[1:16:40] heard of and now is already worth a look
[1:16:46] it's working remember it's a spirit in
[1:16:51] order for it to work it has to have
[1:16:55] vessels to work through it has to have
[1:17:00] vessels to work through and to take
[1:17:03] control of the con the contrast is also
[1:17:07] the same the Holy Spirit is a spirit a
[1:17:11] person may be with me and it must have
[1:17:16] vessels that are yielded to work through
[1:17:21] so how can we yield we yield by the
[1:17:26] nature that is within whatever the
[1:17:30] nature is within that we are born of
[1:17:32] it's a yielding to to that and to look
[1:17:36] at of how that John points this out then
[1:17:40] he he comes to identify and wants you to
[1:17:42] catch this now he identifies what the
[1:17:45] Antichrist spirit is and he doesn't
[1:17:47] place it out here as some hocus-pocus
[1:17:50] he lets it be known that very thing is
[1:17:54] working right here that's what he said
[1:17:58] he said every spirit that deny it Jesus
[1:18:02] Christ he has come in the flesh is not
[1:18:05] of God
[1:18:07] and John was not speaking about the
[1:18:10] Antichrist spirit is a smooth fella the
[1:18:14] Antichrist spirit was not going to say
[1:18:16] that well Jesus Christ you know it was
[1:18:20] not the Son of God God did not become
[1:18:22] flesh no the settlements within that
[1:18:25] time of where John was speaking of the
[1:18:28] denying of his coming was to deny indeed
[1:18:32] he was the son of God because that the
[1:18:35] Holy Spirit had been poured out
[1:18:39] that's his coming there is a literal
[1:18:43] physical coming but as we were laying
[1:18:47] that in on Sunday he was coming by way
[1:18:51] of his Spirit coming through his word
[1:18:53] that makes the people who are a part of
[1:18:57] his coming
[1:18:58] they then live for his coming they are
[1:19:04] brought in position by the word in their
[1:19:08] day they are planted and established in
[1:19:12] prison truth those are two separate
[1:19:16] entities but if they work in unison to
[1:19:19] think of this he said he is coming he's
[1:19:25] coming
[1:19:27] so to recognize that the coming when we
[1:19:31] looked at his coming his coming has been
[1:19:34] missed even in every age because it's
[1:19:37] been so simple is that right it's been
[1:19:44] so simple God is taken and through the
[1:19:49] Ministry of that of the messengers and
[1:19:52] we go on and on the ministry under that
[1:19:54] on and on all of those that are gathered
[1:19:57] within that word how the Holy Spirit
[1:19:59] then bringing to a birth having the
[1:20:03] working and the preeminence in that
[1:20:06] group of people a simple humble and we
[1:20:10] could say like this uneducated being
[1:20:12] that not educated in that of the worldly
[1:20:16] and that of religion it's the simplicity
[1:20:22] that's missed each time his coming is
[1:20:28] working in our lives the channels to
[1:20:32] where each one is to be in position just
[1:20:35] as every age you know we you think of a
[1:20:38] relay think of a relay race if this
[1:20:42] person holding the baton does not get it
[1:20:46] to the other person they have to stop
[1:20:50] and retrieve that baton and then go on
[1:20:54] if they take off and don't have the
[1:20:57] baton they're disqualified but the baton
[1:21:01] that is handed is the same baton all
[1:21:04] along but as the baton itself in the
[1:21:07] hand of that last runner as it's being
[1:21:10] wrong then the crowd begins to stand up
[1:21:13] on their feet and the cloud of many
[1:21:16] witnesses begin to ring out and say hey
[1:21:19] here we are here's the finish here's the
[1:21:22] final stretch stay focused look onward
[1:21:25] why because it's close to the finish but
[1:21:30] in the transition of that there's always
[1:21:33] an overlap every age there's an overlap
[1:21:36] see it's not just a stop and then a
[1:21:41] start and stop and then a start it's an
[1:21:43] overlap you see that even in those were
[1:21:47] here within the ministry of brother
[1:21:49] branham some that were caught in that
[1:21:51] overlap they are a part of the bride of
[1:21:53] Jesus Christ but they were not in not
[1:21:56] seeing what God had opened for the bride
[1:22:01] when not to elaborate on all that but
[1:22:05] you see God's Greece they lived faithful
[1:22:09] to what God had opened to them just as
[1:22:13] you and I are held accountable to live
[1:22:16] faithful to what God has opened to us
[1:22:21] and so I'll say it like this in regards
[1:22:26] to his coming just to drift from that
[1:22:29] just a moment or to move from there
[1:22:31] there's two opposing forces in the world
[1:22:38] it's God Satan
[1:22:46] the battle that began as angelic battles
[1:22:52] it fell on humans and let me just let's
[1:22:59] just make no mistake about it
[1:23:01] it's not human battles its angelic
[1:23:04] warfare for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:23:08] and blood the scriptures are very clear
[1:23:18] of how that when Satan he and he engaged
[1:23:26] Eve with conversation through the
[1:23:30] instrument of the serpent and he began
[1:23:34] to speak to her what was he coming
[1:23:37] against he could not get to her he could
[1:23:42] not penetrate that wall of the word that
[1:23:47] they were fortified behind Satan
[1:23:50] couldn't penetrate it but when he could
[1:23:55] get her to doubt one little speck he
[1:24:01] poked a hole right in the wall and when
[1:24:05] he got a hole in that wall you know it's
[1:24:07] just like a mouse if you you ever seen
[1:24:09] those things where they put out the
[1:24:11] different size holes that a mouse can go
[1:24:13] through it amazes it can be such a small
[1:24:17] little hole and they're able to take
[1:24:19] their little bitty nose and bring that
[1:24:21] whole body through Satan put one little
[1:24:27] hole poked one little hole there how
[1:24:30] could he poke it because she already and
[1:24:33] let down
[1:24:40] I'm holding up of the word and in the
[1:24:44] song that we're looking at the high
[1:24:47] ground is not that we in every instance
[1:24:52] understand everything it isn't that we
[1:24:57] have a feeling
[1:25:00] it's wonderful to have a feeling it's
[1:25:02] wonderful to have a direct word from the
[1:25:05] Lord there are times where you don't
[1:25:08] have a direct word from the Lord and
[1:25:10] there's a need that as a rose in your
[1:25:13] life or Satan comes attacking but yet to
[1:25:17] stand upon God's word that irregardless
[1:25:21] of anything God is faithful the message
[1:25:26] God called men brother Brent says what
[1:25:28] we need his men trained to carry this
[1:25:32] message he said men that would stand
[1:25:35] there whether in victory or defeat will
[1:25:38] stand the same you see the Hebrew
[1:25:42] children they themselves did not know
[1:25:45] what was going to happen they didn't
[1:25:48] know I'll come to the end of this and
[1:25:50] he'll want to get to the end of this
[1:25:51] they'll be the fourth man they'll meet
[1:25:53] us down there will you know will be
[1:25:54] delivered they didn't know that but what
[1:25:56] they knew was we don't even need to pray
[1:25:59] about this situation we're not bowing
[1:26:03] God allowed that to be show that's an
[1:26:07] example that's part of the book of
[1:26:09] redemption that's part of our heritage
[1:26:11] that's part of this genealogy that's not
[1:26:14] of your natural tree or my natural tree
[1:26:17] this is part of the life of that tree of
[1:26:21] life and Satan studies closely these
[1:26:29] things my blue bream says it like this
[1:26:34] he says we find Satan let me just refer
[1:26:38] to this he speaks of this and the
[1:26:40] message the power of the devil and he
[1:26:42] talks about God's program and he finds
[1:26:45] he speaks of how that when everything
[1:26:47] went to take place after Genesis here
[1:26:51] comes the Exodus here comes God's
[1:26:53] promise of deliverance and in God's
[1:26:57] promise of deliverance
[1:26:59] Billy BAM says like this we find Satan
[1:27:01] quickly at work on God's program and he
[1:27:05] uses this terminology says we see that
[1:27:08] malignant eye of the devil
[1:27:11] that's
[1:27:11] serpent I want you to think of that that
[1:27:14] malignant eye a cancerous I remember at
[1:27:20] the eye itself if it be single thy whole
[1:27:23] body shall be full of light but Satan's
[1:27:27] desire was to get that than the focus
[1:27:30] and bring the focus out of where it
[1:27:34] needed to be
[1:27:35] he said that's always tried to interfere
[1:27:39] with God's program before it comes on
[1:27:43] earth
[1:27:46] and he always knows when it's coming
[1:27:51] mostly didn't the Spirit of the Lord
[1:27:57] speak through the Prophet in Christ the
[1:28:00] mystery of God revealed and said he's
[1:28:02] howling then why is he howling because
[1:28:07] his scheme has been uncovered and with
[1:28:13] the scheme being uncovered the answer is
[1:28:16] revealed and the answer is Christ his
[1:28:21] own life which ties and identifies us
[1:28:26] into him and in that book of life where
[1:28:30] there is no break but the breach has
[1:28:33] been removed you with me the baptism of
[1:28:38] the Holy Ghost coming upon that seed it
[1:28:41] removes the chasm and joins us back in
[1:28:45] to who we always were not just forgiven
[1:28:51] I stand justified he spanned the breach
[1:28:59] for us think about this look at this
[1:29:04] this program of God how Satan attacks
[1:29:07] this when the Jews returned as we were
[1:29:11] referring to in Ezra when they returned
[1:29:13] to build the temple what's the first
[1:29:15] thing that happened you find people who
[1:29:20] came up and said let us work with you we
[1:29:24] seek we seek your God as you do liars
[1:29:29] they did not you say how could you say
[1:29:33] that they did not remember his rights
[1:29:37] are protected by a god-sent group of
[1:29:40] people and a god-sent group of people
[1:29:44] the God who sends us goes in us are you
[1:29:49] as for me
[1:29:50] they have been commissioned not by a man
[1:29:53] where come under the Commission
[1:29:56] chin of the word now I wonder what they
[1:30:00] look like they look like you're not
[1:30:02] peace-loving people
[1:30:04] I wonder what things they had thrown up
[1:30:07] and you don't have the love of God
[1:30:10] y'all gettin quiet on me now they
[1:30:13] weren't being hateful they just were
[1:30:16] standing you see this is this inference
[1:30:20] that is not something that is not a
[1:30:23] strain that's come through the word that
[1:30:25] is a strain of the world that the love
[1:30:29] of God is something without a backbone
[1:30:33] that's not the love of God that's the
[1:30:37] love of this world not about arrogance
[1:30:41] not about hateful remember how many
[1:30:44] times were brother Branham is standing
[1:30:45] there times he calls names times he does
[1:30:48] it and I would ask you within those
[1:30:50] times how many times you hear brother
[1:30:52] man will stop and brother Brown even
[1:30:53] anointing once at the end time in many
[1:30:55] places he says I've not said that to be
[1:30:57] indifferent but I'm asking you within
[1:30:59] and I wonder how many of those talks and
[1:31:02] one of those things when he he was
[1:31:04] catching that spirit that was there but
[1:31:05] you see what it is just as it was in the
[1:31:08] time of the Pharisees people did not
[1:31:10] know the love of God the love of God is
[1:31:13] not against the sinner it's not against
[1:31:17] the person the love of God is for God
[1:31:21] for the standard of Almighty God and to
[1:31:25] think of this they stood there and they
[1:31:28] would not allow those others to help
[1:31:31] because they themselves were directly
[1:31:35] under that promise of a return date
[1:31:38] listen friends there was a discernment
[1:31:40] that they had within that hour let me
[1:31:43] ask you who wouldn't want help building
[1:31:45] it come on join in with us man we got to
[1:31:49] get this built we can use you come on in
[1:31:52] but you see it isn't that always more
[1:31:56] make the work go faster
[1:31:59] it ain't more of people it's more of God
[1:32:03] in the people and God standing in the
[1:32:07] hearts and lives of the people and
[1:32:09] people standing in the promise on the
[1:32:12] high ground
[1:32:15] when Israel think of this as we'd
[1:32:18] alluded to this with Moses look at this
[1:32:21] unfolding of God's program as we said at
[1:32:25] the beginning you have Moses Moses
[1:32:27] intellectuals here's a seed down beneath
[1:32:30] but his intellectuals are against but
[1:32:34] God's program can't be defeated that
[1:32:37] seed has got to come to birth and God
[1:32:41] knows exactly the water of life that's
[1:32:43] needed to rot - rot in order to bring
[1:32:47] that seed forth the water of Egypt could
[1:32:51] not rot it you said well his momma
[1:32:55] rehearsed the promise but it shows there
[1:32:58] is a place that we must come to the Holy
[1:33:03] Spirit brings a life to that place of
[1:33:05] birth brings us to that place of
[1:33:08] face-to-face God and in this unfolding
[1:33:12] of God's program here stands Moses watch
[1:33:15] this
[1:33:15] what Satan's advancement to come against
[1:33:18] this program it moves in from Moses to
[1:33:22] here as Moses we know it comes forth
[1:33:25] then here the wilderness they hadn't
[1:33:27] even got out of Egypt hardly and here's
[1:33:30] the golden calf and throughout the
[1:33:36] wilderness Israel became content with
[1:33:43] just the wilderness just sanctification
[1:33:46] but that was not the goal but in the
[1:33:50] midst of the wilderness the people
[1:33:52] complained is that right
[1:33:55] Moses got vexed come on somebody
[1:33:58] humanity that human was still I was
[1:34:01] there was on display what is it it's
[1:34:05] Satan trying to stop God's program if he
[1:34:12] can get the people down he can get the
[1:34:15] servant down hey man he's got it whipped
[1:34:18] you say well it's God's program but
[1:34:21] remember God fulfills his word
[1:34:25] through his ordained channels that's
[1:34:29] God's choosing that's God's choosing Oh
[1:34:34] so within it it makes God responsible if
[1:34:39] you're outta line or I'm out of line
[1:34:41] then it's in God's hands
[1:34:44] to align us for him to move within our
[1:34:50] lives to bring us into that place where
[1:34:52] we should be because he just won't do it
[1:34:54] he wants this from the heart so then
[1:34:58] from the wilderness we come to Kadish
[1:35:01] Satan's desire to come against God's
[1:35:04] program some spies come back and the
[1:35:07] Bible says in the book of Deuteronomy
[1:35:09] chapter 2 they discourage the hearts of
[1:35:12] the people or in another wording it
[1:35:14] means they cause the hearts to melt
[1:35:17] these were people they were walking in
[1:35:20] the wilderness they listened this is
[1:35:22] what the promise was the promise wasn't
[1:35:24] just I'll bring you out of Egypt but the
[1:35:26] promise was to bring you unto a land
[1:35:29] that floweth with milk and honey and
[1:35:32] those no there were men who were there
[1:35:35] the whole time that arose and brought an
[1:35:38] evil report words and those words had
[1:35:47] such an effect and a resounding effect
[1:35:50] that all of the Israel here they were
[1:35:52] weeping and wailing
[1:35:55] but there was some fathers who stood
[1:35:58] true
[1:36:01] just one Caleb
[1:36:04] there one weeping and wailing in their
[1:36:06] tent who imitated something they might
[1:36:10] have had tambourines out that night him
[1:36:16] I'm trans listen to me there was
[1:36:18] something within it they're rejoicing
[1:36:20] was in the God who made the promise
[1:36:25] I'm telling you Caleb wasn't walking
[1:36:28] that land and looking at all of Eden's
[1:36:31] place and valuing what Edom had and
[1:36:33] Eden's allowed to do this and this and
[1:36:35] that Caleb said I've got one goal and
[1:36:38] that is the promised land
[1:36:41] that's what Joshua had he had one goal
[1:36:44] the Promised Land
[1:36:46] listen to me Joshua and Caleb standing
[1:36:50] in that time and Joshua did not even
[1:36:52] know at that moment that he was ordained
[1:36:54] by God that the same angel the Lord that
[1:36:57] spoke through Moses called Moses equip
[1:36:59] Moses would turn around and be the same
[1:37:02] angel the Lord moving through Joshua
[1:37:04] that's not what Joshua stood like he did
[1:37:07] he stood like that because he was a
[1:37:09] believer his vision was fixed on the
[1:37:14] promise or a beat of God then here's
[1:37:24] God's program advancing you find here's
[1:37:27] a great victory that's one of Jericho
[1:37:31] all right great victory but Aiken
[1:37:37] doesn't pay attention and see the value
[1:37:40] of every word you with me and look what
[1:37:47] that wedge of gold does what was that
[1:37:49] all about
[1:37:50] it was influence it wasn't God
[1:37:54] influencing Aitkin but it was influence
[1:37:58] you see this is where it's so important
[1:38:01] in this our our influence our influence
[1:38:05] it must and is to come from Almighty God
[1:38:09] the same God who is the word this is
[1:38:11] where the Prophet before the seals were
[1:38:13] opened at the beginning of January out
[1:38:15] and Markova Valley Arizona he takes that
[1:38:18] message of January 63 and says low cloud
[1:38:20] made people recognize that the mighty
[1:38:23] angel has come down and opened those
[1:38:25] seals and may they allow him to
[1:38:28] influence their lives and yet it was
[1:38:30] months before it happened
[1:38:32] you know why it's a promise of the word
[1:38:36] and the Prophet here he is standing
[1:38:38] there he's aware he's been speaking
[1:38:40] about the seals touching on these things
[1:38:42] throughout life he realized it's
[1:38:45] something that is moving within his
[1:38:47] place within his life for what he
[1:38:49] himself must get into position getting
[1:38:55] in position it's not easy but what God
[1:39:00] has ordained in the position that were
[1:39:02] to be in God will see to it that
[1:39:05] whatever needs to be taken away and
[1:39:08] rearranged to get us in that position as
[1:39:13] he stayed there taking care of his
[1:39:15] mother-in-law in Jeffersonville what did
[1:39:18] the Holy Spirit say to him after he was
[1:39:20] on the porch after mowing the grass he
[1:39:23] said he said to him he said like Abraham
[1:39:26] I cannot fully bless you until you fully
[1:39:30] obey me you see obedience is not a line
[1:39:34] we set obedience is God's plumb line hey
[1:39:41] man we can feel pretty good like manna I
[1:39:43] feel like I'm up to this standard but
[1:39:45] remember we're growing God did not come
[1:39:50] near after the opening of the seven
[1:39:51] seals to have seven doors we're to grow
[1:39:57] has the Prophet himself would pray and
[1:40:00] inspiration God may there be mighty
[1:40:02] warriors rise in this in time you have
[1:40:09] an akin and they can arises
[1:40:13] and when akin arises here look what
[1:40:15] happened look at this the gold is that's
[1:40:17] the way what does this do
[1:40:20] Athens should have stood when he seen
[1:40:22] that garment and that wedge of gold
[1:40:25] notice you catch this
[1:40:27] he didn't just take a garment the
[1:40:29] garment and the gold and that garment is
[1:40:33] tied to that worship that same spirit
[1:40:36] that's in the earth today are you with
[1:40:39] me she has the gold you with me see this
[1:40:43] parallel going right through the
[1:40:44] scripture and notice what happened when
[1:40:47] when that influence was brought into the
[1:40:49] camp look how that influence akin never
[1:40:52] went out said anything but look at the
[1:40:54] influence among the men of war they
[1:40:58] themselves spoke in pride most Joshua we
[1:41:03] don't need to send out that many just a
[1:41:08] few don't don't we don't need the whole
[1:41:12] army hello it's not the me was
[1:41:18] because you won it wasn't because the
[1:41:21] strength of the horror me it wasn't
[1:41:23] because of the number of the me it
[1:41:26] was because the whole army was a whole
[1:41:28] army singular under the Living God
[1:41:32] singular that's where the victory was at
[1:41:36] Jericho was only a manifestation of the
[1:41:39] victory of unity in the camp of Israel
[1:41:43] unity with what with God's program
[1:41:49] so then they rise up in Pride and you
[1:41:52] know what happens at AI they end up
[1:41:54] running from their enemies
[1:42:01] then God turns it around see his
[1:42:03] programs not gonna be defeated God
[1:42:05] didn't fail we'll pass on by ai we're
[1:42:08] not gonna worry about him
[1:42:10] but instead the battle plan that God
[1:42:13] lays is a people who had looked like
[1:42:16] they're running scared but they weren't
[1:42:19] remember they had went away from God and
[1:42:22] the battle manifests as one running back
[1:42:26] to God and then running back to God a
[1:42:29] return in fellowship God manifested
[1:42:32] himself in victory showing that any
[1:42:36] place that is strayed from what God's
[1:42:39] program is if we and our hearts come
[1:42:43] back to that place where the holy spirit
[1:42:45] would point out in our lives then God's
[1:42:49] program continues on
[1:42:56] then it gets closer I'm closing there's
[1:42:59] no way we're gonna get to where I was
[1:43:00] looking at tonight it gets closer
[1:43:05] Satan's attempt to thwart this program
[1:43:09] here's some people show up called the
[1:43:12] Gibeonites these guys holes in their
[1:43:19] shoes moldy bread wine you know that's
[1:43:26] everything and what they say is that we
[1:43:32] are from a far-off country we know what
[1:43:36] you've done to the rest of them but
[1:43:40] would you make a pact with us and they
[1:43:44] made a peace pact with them and you know
[1:43:48] the scripture and not only says it in
[1:43:50] Joshua it says it also in Chronicles
[1:43:53] they're the Gibeonites abide to this day
[1:43:58] because of one peace treaty one pact and
[1:44:04] you know what it wasn't something way
[1:44:07] out there it was an enemy that was
[1:44:10] closer than what they thought and
[1:44:14] remember our greatest enemy we look at
[1:44:20] it every day our greatest enemy is
[1:44:23] closer very close to us very close but
[1:44:30] make no pact with him God's program
[1:44:34] cannot be defeated
[1:44:39] it's to maintain the high ground when
[1:44:46] position is compromised then the enemy
[1:44:49] has advantage but the high ground is
[1:44:53] what we've been given and what I'm what
[1:44:56] I mean by that there is the high ground
[1:44:59] that's been given to us upon this rock I
[1:45:03] will build my church and the gates of
[1:45:08] Hell shall not prevail against it was it
[1:45:15] that the Gibeonites were more shrewd and
[1:45:18] more of how that that they would come it
[1:45:28] doesn't matter how shrewd that they
[1:45:31] would be how deceptive they came how
[1:45:36] believable
[1:45:37] it seemed Joshua was given a strict
[1:45:45] order by God God would speak directly to
[1:45:51] Moses but God told in the book of
[1:45:55] Deuteronomy Joshua is to go to Eleazar
[1:46:00] the high priest and he's to consult the
[1:46:04] yeren see it's faith placed in the word
[1:46:09] when God has come listen when God has
[1:46:13] come and visit the generation what is he
[1:46:17] calling us to he's calling us to the
[1:46:22] word he's calling us to himself he's
[1:46:25] calling us to the high ground and the
[1:46:29] high ground is him for he has set me
[1:46:32] upon a rock David said he alone is my
[1:46:37] rock
[1:46:41] hallelujah there is no other rock like a
[1:46:44] rock that rock is that high ground that
[1:46:49] revelation of Almighty God it's the high
[1:46:55] ground it's it's where it leads us back
[1:46:57] to the word
[1:46:58] we're not led by feelings we might have
[1:47:00] pulsation there might be things that are
[1:47:02] spoke to us things that are set but
[1:47:04] remember we're moved by a direct
[1:47:06] commission by the word beloved believe
[1:47:09] not every spirit but try every spirit
[1:47:13] and see whether it be of God
[1:47:17] I think it shows a great danger
[1:47:25] victories are precious aren't they
[1:47:30] everybody love victories I like them
[1:47:35] anybody like defeats I don't anybody
[1:47:39] like making mistakes
[1:47:47] it shows us within that instance right
[1:47:52] there the victory you might have had
[1:47:57] yesterday does not guarantee you victory
[1:48:01] tonight and the victory you have tonight
[1:48:06] does not guarantee you victory tomorrow
[1:48:09] but remember every victory comes from
[1:48:13] yielding and being submitted to him and
[1:48:16] his working and to always remember it is
[1:48:20] not I who live but Christ who lives in
[1:48:24] me it is not you or me
[1:48:27] that gets the victory it's him
[1:48:31] it's his victory moving through us as
[1:48:35] ordained yielded channels but I'll say
[1:48:40] this to you as I've said many times at
[1:48:43] different times of council and other
[1:48:44] things success
[1:48:53] is not permanent
[1:48:57] failure is only temporary
[1:49:05] now shall make that way of good success
[1:49:08] and prosperous so remember Paul said I
[1:49:12] die daily you love him
[1:49:16] every day is to look for victory but
[1:49:22] remember victory there might be
[1:49:24] different things that we come in contact
[1:49:27] with but remembering it all the Bible
[1:49:31] says submit yourself therefore under God
[1:49:34] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:49:37] you
[1:49:37] it doesn't say resist the devil first
[1:49:40] then submit remember submission to
[1:49:43] greater is He that is in you then resist
[1:49:47] the devil your loving tonight his
[1:49:52] program will not and cannot be defeated
[1:49:55] but let it be within our hearts and our
[1:49:58] lives that Lord let your program advance
[1:50:01] in me Lord
[1:50:03] your loving let's pray Lord Jesus
[1:50:12] we thank you Lord tonight
[1:50:16] Lord God as we look Lord into the word
[1:50:22] as you have opened to us the contents to
[1:50:27] speak words of counsel and when your
[1:50:31] word is manifest Lord it's you and you
[1:50:36] are our leader Lord you Lord God are the
[1:50:41] one to lead us and to guide us Lord
[1:50:45] Jesus you know every need you know every
[1:50:49] situation you know each heart that's
[1:50:52] gather here tonight and all that are
[1:50:53] under the sound of my voice father may
[1:51:00] we be as yielded as that had those
[1:51:06] glasses the handkerchiefs even to those
[1:51:11] people where the Prophet would mention
[1:51:13] they had to be setting standing in
[1:51:16] certain places Lord were trusting in you
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:23] that every part Lord of Our Lives to be
[1:51:29] positioned in you Lord I pray Lord Jesus
[1:51:38] help us Lord to be mindful knowing that
[1:51:42] Satan as we read in the scriptures Lord
[1:51:46] is various in the way that he would come
[1:51:50] way Lord God of which he would seek to
[1:51:53] approach and move Lord as the Bible says
[1:51:57] Satan as a roaring lion roll to and fro
[1:52:03] seeking whom he may devour
[1:52:08] but all God nor our hearts are looking
[1:52:15] to you there's a greater greater sound
[1:52:20] Lord that we have heard
[1:52:25] we have heard from you and as we look up
[1:52:29] on these things in your word oh god help
[1:52:33] us tonight the Lord that our lives and
[1:52:38] our hearts would be so yielded to you
[1:52:40] Lord I you know how to break it to every
[1:52:43] one of our hearts you know each
[1:52:46] circumstance you know each part every
[1:52:48] situation you know what each one Lord
[1:52:51] would be facing or dealing with you know
[1:52:54] Lord sometimes Lord we can have Lord
[1:53:02] where it's us using our own strength
[1:53:09] the Lord you can never use that strength
[1:53:12] [Music]
[1:53:14] but that it would be surrendered to you
[1:53:17] Lord God I ask that you would help each
[1:53:21] and every one of us as your children lay
[1:53:23] the word Lord being so broken and help
[1:53:27] us to our lives Lord and apply that we
[1:53:31] might be able to see your God and
[1:53:35] recognizing Lord the high ground that
[1:53:39] you have appointed us to help us Lord
[1:53:43] act me knowing the Lord that victories
[1:53:48] that we have are not guaranteed a
[1:53:53] victory again
[1:53:56] the Lord God to look at those victories
[1:53:59] and any victory any any one of them has
[1:54:05] been where we have been able to get out
[1:54:09] of the way and that's not even been
[1:54:13] anything that we can take credit
[1:54:16] because even to get out of the way it
[1:54:20] takes your influence your direction
[1:54:23] moving on our life that we would
[1:54:26] surrender that your program might be
[1:54:30] advanced we're standing there in these
[1:54:34] closing moments nor these hours that
[1:54:36] were living father all around us Lord
[1:54:40] God how that the enemy Lord is gathered

[1:55:27] Lord that all God are to be and are a
[1:55:31] part of that rapture Jesus Oh God not an
[1:55:37] event but an unfolding where the climax
[1:55:42] of it all is the change of these mortal
[1:55:44] bodies
[1:55:45] Oh God how Satan Lord his desire is to
[1:55:51] stand against the Lord try to hinder it
