arise [Music] awesome [Music] foreign Hallelujah amen what a privilege we have tonight Amen to be gathered together Amen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and what a privilege it is that he's made a way that we could surrender you know that's the greatest thing that that we can ever do is to surrender and submit ourselves in his presence it just whatever the word is speaking to us it's just like when it came to the very first miracle of Canaan they ran out of wine and Mary said to him she said whatever he says to you just do it all they had to do was go fill up the pots with water yeah it wasn't their business to change it to wine he's the one that would take care of that it's not our business to part the waters he's the one that'll take care of that if we just we just step into the water the water's apart amen and what we have need of here tonight and I think of it as young people it's so good to see each and every one of you and that's what this service is for amen that God would just speak to your lives personally amen and God's God's mindful you know I think of when brother Branham hear the Holy Spirit as he spoke to him and when he received that that visitation of the Lord he said I remember what he said concerning you young people and this message this word was intended for our lives amen it and I'll tell you one thing I can stand here and I know there's others that could as well and I think it was 19 years old when God got a hold of my life now there was a start in my life but it came to a full surrender when I was 19 years old and I can tell you my life has never been the same older's been tests there's been trousers been ups and downs but in it all God is faithful amen the only regret that I have is that I never surrendered fully years before that but I'll tell you God is Mindful and all you have to do while the words coming forth just just move right in the word when God is speaking to you just say Amen just say yes Lord being unto me what whatever it might be just go ahead and enter right in because God is mindful of your needs and amen and we're just we're privileged to be able to be here and I just appreciate the different ones as you've brought your the young people that have come here and traveled to be here and we just want to turn our attention to the word of the lord we had a wonderful service this morning we're just expecting more amen from the Lord here this evening amen we just want to invite brother Wayne to go ahead and come on out and just ask him to take his Liberty I believe God has great things in store for us because God is just that kind of God there is no other God like him amen he so when he shows up he shows out when God comes on the scene and there is no limitations and so tonight we we just settle that in our heart there's no limiters on the power of God there's no Regulators on the power of God God is here to do for you amen more than you can even think but he's able to move and he wants to how many believe that amen now I don't know I see a few of these empty pews and I'm sitting up here and I am going to set up here on the end but if there's any maybe some of these young men are going to join me right in here and spread out over there but if there's any other young man that would like to set up here maybe some of the young sisters up in there feel you're you're more than welcome to do that this is a youth service I know some of you feel like brother Ronnie's about ready to run up here right now brother Ronnie it's all right you can join me over there it's okay you you can we still classify as young people you know I mean I I know I I only look about 17 so I know I'll fit in you know amen but let's just let's sing this little song as brother Wayne comes you you may [Music] when our backs was against the wall and he looked as if it was over [Music] and we're standing here only because you make a way mountains the human mountains [Music] do you know [Music] and you made [Music] a way understanding here only because you make a way thank you now you move mountains [Music] foreign [Music] maker isn't he may God bless you all it's certainly good to see the ones that was able to come tonight amen on a Sunday evening and I think this is the first time you're doing this for youth services and amen we pray God but just put his Spirit upon it and bless it amen amen if there's anything we need we we really really need a move of God Amen among our people among our young people amen I believe this message is for everybody amen amen we want to agree to each one of you thank you all for making a special effort to be here tonight amen we just want to if we can maybe to Bow our hearts in a word of prayer and you know tonight if you have a special need on your heart we know that he's the god of Abraham you can make the way where there's no way it can change the events in the course of your life tonight while we dispel our hearts especially maybe you might just lift your hand to the Lord so Lord remember me tonight while the man of God speaks your word Lord having speak something from me send your word my way Lord oh God we bow our hearts tonight Lord knowing that Lord you said that if we would humble our hearts and pray that you would hear us Lord father you were the one that instituted prayer as a way to contact you the prophet told us it was one of the most powerful weapons on the face of the Earth and Lord Jesus we invoked the power of prayer tonight to invite you in this room you said that if we would invite you you would come and Lord Jesus we do not invite you here just to be a guest among us we invite you to come to the platform tonight Lord that you speak your word may your anointing touch the mind of a mortal man and may we be able to speak things that you could back up Lord we pray your great anointing would come in the room and Lord the hearts one after the other would open it up Lord and you'd be able to just move Among Us in a special way tonight Lord not a bystander in this meeting but may you be the preeminence Lord may you be the center of the attention tonight and may we worship you and praise you and speak of you and Lord may you show yourself infallibly Among Us by the proves of your Resurrection May you may you heal the sick among us father may you speak to the needs if there's one that are hungry to to touch you and to feel you your great anointing move upon their heart I pray Lord tonight you meet that need I pray father for your mercy now we invite you to take the preeminence of this meeting lead us in thy word father and we'll give you all the honor and the glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we'd like to turn into the scripture Into the Book of Psalms if we can 103 Psalms 103 . we'd like to read the first few verses of that chapter it's beautiful reading Psalms 103 and verse 1. bless the Lord O my soul yeah and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquity in who healeth all Zion diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction and who craneth thee with loving kindness and tender Mercy who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that the youth is renewed like the eagles amen we ask the Lord to bless the reading of his words you can be seated tonight I want to speak to you again tonight for just a little bit upon this subject of it is a spirit it is a spirit I know that's a rather an odd text to take but I want to speak to you a little bit tonight about it is a spirit some time ago I was listening to a tape it was Jesus Christ is saying yesterday forever sometime preaching the 1950s I was actually in a in a holding meetings in India when it happened to me and I was sitting in a in a hotel room and I was praying over some things and I was listening to a tape and and like we do many times and while I was sitting there listening to that sermon brother Benham started coming toward the end of his service and when he did he started uh in the gift of discernment and he started talking to people and how he always does you know in in those Discerning lines and he started telling them their names and where they were from and what they come from and what kind of sickness was upon them and he starts doing this well I'm just sitting here enjoying my morning listening to this tape and but just out like out of nowhere just like it was my own mind I could I could I had a thought in this song aunt said well he he already knew that about that person I thought well that's kind of odd and then I'm listening and he discerns another person and just out of the blue something says to me well someone told him about them and then again he discerns another person and something says to me well the information was on the prayer card that that's what that's what just happened and just as it started happening on the tape brother Branham said something and he says something in this line that's not exact but something in this line and he says now when Jesus was there in Capernaum he said if the works that had been done in you that would be done here he said if the works have been done among you would have been done in Sodom Gomorrah they would be standing today and the Bible actually tells us there was many things he couldn't do because of the spirit of unbelief and when he says that brother Graham says that he said now something along these lines he said now I rebuke that Spirit of doubt in the name of Jesus Christ off that congregation it was there and the minute he said that the thing left the room it left my mind and just as soon as that left my mind the spirit of the Lord spoke to me he said see it's just a spirit and and when he said that I realized right then what is happening to people when they're listening to tapes or when they're studying the message of the hour and they come up with these ideas of how that there's something uh wrong or there's something being said there that's been prompt or been set up see that it actually is a spirit because see as a Holy Ghost Field person uh my my soul be sealed amen uh I I wasn't let me just put it this way if the spirit had spoke like that someone listening to that would have thought it was them they would have actually thought I'm thinking that but but I'm certain I wasn't thinking that it wasn't my fault at all and had I received that thought it would have been a spirit of doubt that would have come in my life and then cursed my life because of the spirit of Doubt doubting what the word of God did but see God revealed it to me because I was actually in that meetings was praying about what's what's happening with some of the people why are they uh getting so discouraged with the message and and and it struck my heart because it's it's actually a spirit now if you start realizing these things are spirits it changes everything see not everything that speaks to you is you not everything that comes through your mind is you sometimes you have to discern what is speaking to you and what is saying things to you and you don't have to own everything you think it's not actually your thought it's a spirit that comes through your mind but you don't have to receive it let me tell you like this one man a guy comes to brother random and repents to him he says brother random I was sitting there thinking so and so and so about you and I'm sorry I love you I think you're a man of God and I'm sorry I was thinking that and brother bam said no he said actually it wasn't you he said it was the man sitting in front of you that was thinking that you were just picking up on his thoughts amen and how relieved the guy was to realize that it really wasn't his thought it was the devil in the room amen and it was just passing through his mind and you see the quicker you can understand that the spirit of the devil will think through your mind just like it was you but it really ain't you see if you was riding down the road and and there was a guy sitting next to you in the car he said stop and Rob this bank right here well you just look at the guy and say you're stupid get out of my car I'm not gonna I'm not you I'm not gonna let you ride in my car and try to talk me into robbing a bank but you'll ride down the road and let them thoughts move through your mind and you never open up the door and say get out but I think this is the season when the when the Church of the Living God becomes into a spiritual discernment to understand amen that not everything you think belongs to you not everything you think is coming from God but it is a spirit now if we say to you it's a spirit that's a a pretty broad statement but let's just narrow it down a little bit it's a demon spirit amen it is a demon Spirit now if we say to you something is a demon now you say what is a demon brother Wayne a demon is a devil a demon or a devil and it comes from the same word it's called a Tormentor a devil is a Tormentor isn't that something amen the Devil is a Tormentor I'm gonna call him all kinds of bad names tonight amen but the Devil is a Tormentor amen and the thing about the devil is he's not only a Tormentor amen but he's also a liar so do you know the devil will actually torment a real Christian somebody who is really a Christian on the inside bought sealed saved amen delivered unto God Amen but the devil is always trying to destroy your peace and destroy your life so he will actually eat at you but he's just a Tormentor or spirit and because he is a liar he does not let the truth get in the way of his tormenting you he will lie to you about you to torment your life I can't tell you you're not a child of God he'll tell you you're not a part of this or you're not a seed of God but see he don't care to lie to you to torment you to make you believe well the message is true but it's for somebody else the message there's a Rapture but it's for somebody else see he don't care to lie to you but it's a spirit and you ought to call him out on it and say that you're just a devil you're a Tormentor you're a spirit a Tormentor many times brother Madden said even people who were saved he said could be tormented sometimes even to the place of insanity but they're yet a converted person can you can you believe that someone could totally lose their mind be out of their right mind but their soul completely saved amen that's why sometimes when you suffer with nervousness and you suffer with fear or you surface was suffer with some kind of anxiety and Satan would like to tell you that it has something to do with your Christianity when you can be a total complete Christian but Satan is doing his best to torment you anyhow amen but you must see that it is a spirit it is a spirit now in the message of demonology 1953 brother Adam said there's a channel right here he says that there's a channel and he said I don't usually tell this before the people he said I got a lot of secrecy in my own life of course between God and I but look there's a channel like this and this is where Mortals live in and it's a conglomeration of deity and Blackness and sin and every once in a while you'll see a little spot of light and Jesus said ye are the light of the Hill said on the hill now don't light a candle and put a bush over the Christians in this conglomeration of dimension of Mortals now he says we're going to go this way downward he said the next is going to be the souls of unjust who died not knowing god then the second realm will be demons and the Third Realm of Trinity of Hell will be unjust Souls demons and then hell itself so he said from this Mortal realm you're living in it's a conglomeration he said now there's going to be some lights in that conglomeration but if you start going downwards you're going to start going into lost souls and you're going to go into demons then you're going to go to hell he said but if you turn and go the other way he said there's three Realms as well he said the first of this is going to be the Holy Ghost the second will be Angels the third Will Be Heaven itself he said but see something is influencing you from one place or the other so every one of us in this middle channel is being influenced from one of these two places all of the time amen either you're influenced by God or your influenced by the devil now watch what the influence of them will do remember in the Bible when the the serpent amen he beguiled Eve now what he did is he got under the influence of the devil and he acted as an instrument of the devil but remember what happened to the guy remember when God cursed him he cast him to his belly upon the dust and remember he changed his bone structure that he could never rise again so the influence of Satan always cast down a person amen but the influence of the eagle gets a hold of an individual and takes him in the sky you can always know what is influencing you by what the attitudes you have is toward the word of God if it's the right direction if it's the right attitude amen faith will come into your heart and you'll rise up look every time in the scripture nearly every time that God comes he sustained upon your feet rise upon your feet the spirit of God always lifts the church in the power of God every time Satan comes I'm not worthy I can't do it I'm never going to make it I'm not able to do this there's no way I can do this see but the devil is a liar to begin with and he don't care to lie to you to tell you and torment your life and every time he speaks to you he is bringing you beneath the Privileges God gives you now I can show you in the scripture Amen in Revelation chapter 9 you look in the first verse and the Bible tells us that the fifth angel sounded I saw a star fall from Heaven under the Earth and unto him was given the key of the bottomless pit a star if this is speaking of end time now there's a star that falls out of Heaven a star out of heaven now think of this what or what is that a star out of heaven in Isaiah 14 the 12th verse Isaiah said Thou Art fallen from heaven or Lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which thou did weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will send unto the heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will set upon the Mount of the congregation of the sides of North I will Ascend above the Heights and the clouds and I will be like the most high but yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit so Satan who was in a high place has fallen now the scripture Will Tell Us in Luke chapter 10 and verse 18 Jesus speaking to the disciples he said I behave held Satan falling like lightning I beheld Satan fallen from heaven like lightning now when did Satan fall from Heaven like lightning when God gave power to the disciples and he told him I give you power to tread upon the head of every scorpion upon every Power it wasn't just upon animals he was talking about it was upon the demons amen that had fallen from Heaven and the sons of God were being positioned back to receive what they had fallen from to begin with and it pushes the devil out of those heavenly places now the prophet of God said the power of the church moving forward upset the kingdom of Hell or of Satan and seen it dropped from its places now the scripture will also tell us in Revelation chapter 9 that there was a king over the bottomless pit who in the hebrew's tongue was abaddam but in the Greek tongue is abilone and it actually means amen not the place of Destruction but the angel of Destruction it's actually speaking of the angel that brings destruction aside from the abyss or the place where he lives now this is this this the reality is that the great Fallen Angel Satan has come into this age like a roaring lion and he's seeking whom he may devour or to influence that's why the scripture says in the book of second Thessalonians and chapter 2 this is the age of the great Falling Away Now isn't it amazing when a fallen angel comes into this Dimension there is a falling away of people because they're being influenced by a fallen angel now all you'd have to do is look into the heavens and see what happened to two-thirds of the angels that believe the lie brother Ben said watch he drawed them out of heaven with his tail not the tail like a dog wagging a tail the lie that he told the lie that Satan told to the angels brought them out a fallen angel caused a fall to happen Out of Heaven now he met in the last days this same devil has come into this age to cause a fall among the Church of the Living God he's come to bring her he's come to bring a tale that he told but here's the beauty of this do you know that Up In Heaven There was a third of the Angels who didn't believe the lie of the devil and they kept their positions with God do you know those angels the anointing that was on those angels are the same anointing that has failed on the Church of the Living God in the last day that we did not believe the lie of the devil to begin with and will not believe that lie tonight amen because we are anointed with the spirit of the eagle Amen to withstand every lie that the devil told he said preacher how do you withstand the age that we're living how do you do it amen it is the eagle anointing or the revelation of God that will help you withstand this Fallen anointing the influence amen we are anointed to not believe Satan's lie do you know in John 17 and 5 Jesus said father glorify me with my own self the glory which I have with thee before the world was do you know that there was before the world was Jesus had a memory of what it was before the world was he had a memory and he spoke to God about the disciples who was with him before the foundation of the world he spoke about them that's why Paul said in Ephesians 1 he said according he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world do you think God could just send you in this deceptive age and hope you wasn't deceived do you think God could send you in the most deceiving of all ages when the greatest fall that ever will happen will happen and you wouldn't somehow fall or you wouldn't somehow be deceived God knew before he sent you here as Jesus predicted in Matthew 24 24 he said there shall come cough Christ and false Christ he said and will deceive the very elect if it were possible but glory to God it ain't possible because somebody has been ordained before the world to begin to stand against the LIE of this devil that's why the Church of the Living God's not backing up to the Dead level we're not backing up to our critics we're not backing up to the ideas amen but by the spirit of God we will stand every spirit that comes against the Church of the Living God we were anointed before the world was isn't it amazing there's only one Spirit there's only one person who ever knew what the world was before but when William Branham came and began to preach he began to say now let me take you back before the world began and he started discussing pre-creation knowledge amen what was it it wasn't just a man talking to you but the same spirit of God that created the heavens and the Earth and used a prophetic voice to speak to the church in the end time because he was going to anoint you with a revelation that we didn't just show up here we were sent here we didn't just come and hope maybe we'll make it but God who is rich in Mercy chose us and anointed us before the foundation of the world to stand here in this age and anointing of God to stand come on you are part of this glorious stand and how did he know you'll stand because he sent you to stand sometimes when I look at the age and I look at the calling I say God what did you know about me I didn't know about myself I tell you what do you know about me that I don't know about myself because when I look at this world and I look at myself I do not see someone who could withstand all of this stuff amen but God put something on the inside but he knew could withstand hell because it's already did it in heaven now it's going to do it on the earth you are the anointed children of God who withstand the LIE of the devil that's why you believe God's word not just because you're good people you're anointed to believe you're anointed to believe now brother Branham ties together this is two beautiful scriptures for you young people John 17 and 5 in Ephesians 1 and 4 write them two scriptures down and look at them later John 17 5 Ephesians 1-4 glorify me with the glory we had before the world and Ephesians 1 and 4 he had chosen Us in him now brother Branham in the message questions and answers from 53 he's going to say when God created me I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious as far as I know I don't believe you're getting it now but listen just a moment Jesus told his disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said he chose us in him before the foundation world see those two scripts two scriptures together now now there was some part of me Orman Neville the rest of you all here that's in Christ he said before the world ever began now here's my analysis of it I think the people today are possessed with the spirit or the spirit of a part of angelic beings the spirits which rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning that resisted the devil's lie in heaven as a prophet with an analysis of John 17 and Ephesians 1 you're Anointed with a spirit that didn't fall therefore in questions and answers 57 therefore he could predestinate he said by foreknowledge he could tell you who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved he knew which person would take up with which spirit God knew when he put you here what Spirit you would take up with he knew you would take the word even if it was against every odd he knew when he put Micah against 400 prophets Anointed with a lie he knew you were coming he knew somebody come on now if you go back and read the scripture Elijah prophesied the death of Ahab but when it come time for the battle of Armageddon the Battle of Ahab going to Ramos Gilead amen he had 400 line prophets amen that there was a there was an angel in heaven said Lord how will we fulfill your word he said I see the lion spirit and get in them and that same line Spirit got in 400 prophets and said go up and you'll be okay but it was only lying to lead them in error to fulfill Elijah's prophecy that Ahab would die but Micah wouldn't get under the lie because he knew what the word of God had to say he said wouldn't you like to be a Micah you can be America come on Church we've had an Elijah message in this day we've had the word of God in this day and there is the spirit of truth and the spirit of error and we have been Anointed with a spirit of Truth and it'll lead us and guide us into all truth because God hath anointed you and typed you with Micah he types you with David he knew exactly what it you were coming in too and he put him in the scripture to show hey man he withstood 400 prophets to stand with the word of God and you will stand every denomination every religion every Spirit Every Lie Amen to stand with this word listen in Revelation chapter 19 it says or in Revelation chapter 9 it said that that demon that fell from heaven amen got two hundred thousand thousand demons released to him as an army so Satan is leading the greatest army he's ever LED since heaven and the Bible tells us he's leading them against the Saints of the most high they were natural Spirits against Israel amen but they pushed Israel into their Homeland now the things that were natural have become ecclesiastical and religious and they have pushed us into the message of the hour we've got no hope outside of this message we got no hope outside of this word but this message is bringing the pride back to its original place I tell you why I tell you why those Israelites left why those Jews left Russia and went to Israel and they left Africa and they went to Israel and they left Poland and went to Israel it's because they were Jews to begin with and the reason you come out of the Baptist and out of the Lutheran and out of the world because you were sons of God to begin with and God made the devil push you but the spirit of God was pulling you at the same time bringing you back to your Homeland anointed of God now listen I tell you that demon is leading two hundred thousand thousand Devils to cause a fall in the last day but there's a bride and the prophet of God said when all of hell is poured out all of Heaven is poured out to defeat it or to withstand that devil two hundred thousand thousand demons released against the church can I say something to you hey man we have not come to Mount Sinai we have not come Amen to Mount Calvary we have come to Mount Zion and Paul says it in Hebrews 12 12 and 22 we are come to Mount Zion we have come to the city of the Living God the Church of the firstborn come on Church you keep looking at this bride as a slave come on she is not a slave it's his wife come on he's not a slave it's his son I'll talk to you about that prodigal this morning that's not a slave I was the man's son everybody else might have saw a slave he saw a son come on you know I'm in the scripture in the days of Hosea everybody saw hosea's wife as a prostitute slave but he could never see her that way amen he paid the price of redemption she wasn't the slave it was his wife and the Church of the Living God there's a price been paid a Redemption for the church in the last day he has redeemed her and brought her unto Mount Zion the Church of the Living God where the Bible says there is an innumerable company of angels will y'all forgive me for noticing you'll forgive me for noticing but if they can count the Devils that's against you but you can't count the Angels that's for you I can put a number on them demons that are fighting us but the angels of God that are with this bride they are in memorable you cannot count them I say there are more with us than there is with him as a God in heaven that's poured out his spirit in this last day God has intended for this bride to leave this place victorious in this hour I'll tell you we have received a kingdom it cannot be shaken by Demons by diseases we have been influenced from God now I know that demons and diseases and cancer comes from the fourth dimension comes from a dimension you can't see well now we can prove to you it's here but you can't see it without an instrument to let you know it's here amen now let's just take this into into consideration if you take a person tonight that's deaf and dumb but the RAM said see what happens is many times you take them to a doctor and he said now if there's a bone that's laying on the nerve or there's something out of order he said they could do some kind of surgery or they can do something to fix the hearing he said but if the if the nerve is dead they can't fix it with surgery and they don't know what's wrong with it he said but what it is it's actually a spirit now look he goes into the Bible and said Jesus cast out the deaf and dumb Spirit he said now you calling anything you want the Bible calls it a spirit now see if you could pick it up with x-ray they can tell you what's wrong but they can't say what's wrong they just know they're deaf and dumb so brother random on the other hand being a Seer being a prophet he said let me let me just take you into a little instruction he said what it's like he said it's just like maybe your hand he said you take a transparent band you remember the story many of you probably heard it he said you take a transparent band and wrap around your hand he said all of a sudden your hand starts turning odd colors and and the light starts leaving it starts getting numb and a little while he said the hand is not useful anymore now what is it that's not a bone out of order it's not a nerve out of order nothing's wrong but there's a band wrapped around it that's cutting off the life to it and you can't see it because instruments of medicine can't pick it up but the prophet of God said but what it is it's a spirit that's wrapped around the nerve and it's cutting off the source of life to that nerve now he said when that happens he said there's no Doctrine in the world can fix that he said but if you could come into the house of God and get to maybe get prayer or something would happen he said the spirit has to be removed from the nerve because there's nothing wrong with the eardrum there's nothing wrong with the hammer there's nothing wrong physically at all it's just a band that cuts off the line now listen we could take that in the Physical Realm and think about it but what if you took that in the spiritual realm what if you realize that there's nothing wrong at all with a message there's nothing wrong at all with you but there's a band that's been placed around your belief system that you can't hear the word of God clearly because a spirit is controlling what you're hearing have you ever now you young people probably are just coming to this stage of life but I know your elders know what I'm talking about have you ever been in a service and and maybe you had a little condemnation on you you talked to the preacher about something last week and or the week before and maybe you and him had a little discussion about something a couple weeks later you're in the church and he's preaching and you're just sure he's bombing you you're sure he's just plaguing do you know 95 of the time he's really not and he probably don't even know what it is that you're upset about and then later he can testify you could do a few if you wasn't he wasn't scared of it but but you go later amen I've had people come to me and say well by the way you've been you've been boy been tearing me up the last couple weeks and I just look at him kind of funniest thing about why why you know but what it is is that there's a spirit of spit involved and that spirit things a certain way it makes you understand things a certain way do you know misunderstandings are a great thing in scripture the Bible said people misunderstood God do you know they'll misunderstand the preacher people misunderstand the preacher sometimes it will affect a person's life for years because the spirit causes a little misunderstanding and they'll leave the church and they'll get away from God or they'll feel like somebody's been picking on them when really there was nothing wrong with what the preacher said that was really nothing wrong with you but a devil got involved and twisted the thing and ripped a fig tree right out of your life but I say tonight you ought to recognize it was a spirit and you ought to cast that demon in hell and get up off of where you are and get back in the presence of God if the devil gets a hold of you you go down down down down if God gets a hold of you you go up up up up up I say get god get a hold of the church again and let the spirit of inspiration and power anoint the church with power and authority Jesus called it a deaf and dumb spirit now I actually got to talk to a lady who was in one of Brothers meetings way about years ago and she was she said to me she was five years old in the meeting she said I was setting up front and she said the reason I remember it's because it was a girl we knew she said brother random come in there and it was about an 18 year old girl that put in a prayer line he said I'd known her my whole life my sister's known her she'd never spoke one word or heard one word in her whole life he said she brought her in there brother Brandon began to pray for her and he said when he prayed for her he condemned the deaf and dumb spirit in her and then he said he he took his microphone and put in front of her lips and whispered in her ear and said say mama and she said brother all we heard was the girl saying through the mic mama she said it was the neatest thing to hear the first words that she spoke he said but but later I studied brother Branham on this point and he said now what it is he said we don't have any kind of uh he said we don't have any kind of hearing test here on the platform or any kind of doctors he said but I know when the spirit's gone because if they can hear me they can speak he said because it affects the same nerve he said the hearing and the speaking are tied together if we can get them here and we can get them saying see when people say things wrong it's because they're hearing things wrong but if God would remove the spirit they can hear it right they could say it right I'll tell you what we need amen it's the spirit to be removed of misunderstanding where the thing would come clear again and they would speak it right because they hear it right now this squirrel actually said something to me and she said brother Wayne She said but now there's something I don't understand about this testimony she said because that girl I know I know that girl was deaf and dumb from an early childhood and she said and I sat in brother man's meetings and heard him say say mama and she said Mama if you go and study the message it actually happens in Germany and and brother Branham says to a little German boy say mama and he says in English mama because he don't know German he might have been born in German but he don't know German but the first words he ever speaks English words because he's hearing an English Prophet all right I tell you what amen come on now I never heard Baptist I'd never heard Lutheran I speak like a prophet because all I ever heard was prophet I don't know no different to say it if brother random said it it's what he said amen one day I come one day I come in the house brother years ago I I wasn't preaching much I was just listening a lot of tapes and I'd go down the old bottoms and I just ride for hours listen tapes and I'd hear Brother Bram saying well I can't sing and start with but I I just enjoy it and just get into the spirit and brother bam he sang this song it's dripping with blood it's dripping with blood this Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping with blood so I I come in the house one day and I'm not married yet I come in the house I'd come in my mom and I'm saying it's dripping with blood it's dripping with blood and she looks at me kind of funny she goes that ain't the right tune I said it ain't the right tune she said no she said they don't sing it like that I said well I'm sorry I only heard brother random sing it and sometimes when I teach things people say well you don't teach that right I said well I'm sorry I've only heard about a band teacher I'm sorry I don't teach it like the world teaches it but if William Branham said it let's get back to preaching the message and believe in the message of the hour I don't have a Baptist here I don't have a Lutheran here I've got an ear for the word of God and the Bible said he that happened here let him hear what the spirit says to the church the brother man said he said what happens is is God speaks to an Angel and the angel speaks to the church now this woman brother Brown the brother and pray for the girl this woman actually tells me she said but it was confusing to me because the girl went home he's about two three days later the girl went home her parents said she'd been faking it her whole 18 years you've been faking this your whole life that's not true you've been faking this there's no way you've had a miracle where you couldn't hear and couldn't speak and now you can hear and speak we don't believe it do you know that woman told me she said brother Wayne She said God be my witness that girl quit speaking and quit hearing and never heard or spoke again after that day I said are you serious she said yeah she said I know she was healed what happened I said I'll tell you what happened amen God healed that woman but that she let that devil come right back in her life she allowed that to come right you said preacher that ain't possible it ain't possible let's take a couple instances what about Apostle Peter when he was standing on the boat and Jesus said come walk to me he got out and walked on the water but when he got his eyes off of Jesus hey many begin to seek because he was looking at the water instead of Jesus now you know that water typed Humanity don't you amen he got you looking at everything around him instead of looking at Jesus and he began to sink but but by Grace God Amen reached down his hand and kicked him back up on the wave and led him back to the boat do you know Jesus said it like this he said that when the spirit goes out of a man it walks in dry places and returns now you've heard Jesus say that right amen it said it brings back seven worse than the first is that right now we've always wondered it goes out in dry places how long do they stay that's a good question isn't it if they go out how long do we got before they get back brother Brown said 72 hours three days 72 hours them demons will roam 72 dollars and then they will return to the house now here's something years ago there was a brother down in Hot Springs brother man prayed for him and and they were right on the death bed and God healed them amen and a few days later the sickness returned right back so they called brother Brown he's still here they called brother random right quick and they said brother random their sickness is returning to us and rather than said no he said no it's not that at all he said it's just like this it's just like you've had a cat in the house and you fed it for days but then one day you take the cat and you throw it out the door and you shut the door he said now that cat's being used to living and feeding in that house he's gonna come back and scratch at the door he said all that is is the devil's scratching and boarding back in he has successfully been kicked out and don't you open up the door and let him back in see after 72 hours that devil will return to you and say you never got nothing in that meeting God never trusts you he never healed you he never did delivered you he never gave you the grace that you wanted amen but let me tell you there's a difference this time he's on the outside talking and still on the inside talking and don't you open up the door and let that devil back in is it not him out keep him out I think it's time to lock the door on the devil and say that's enough Satan you'll not live in this house you'll not eat at my table come on you're not sleep in my bed I think it's time for the Church of the Living God he said preacher what are you saying I'm saying 72 hours and that Devil's coming back yeah you've got to fill the void you've got to feel the void the place and what to do is to fill that void with the word of God you see what happened with that girl she had she had her healing but she left the devil Robert out of her she let somebody tell her it was all emotional it was all just emotional work up it's all just in your mind it's all no good and she allowed the devil to rob her miracle from her don't you let no devil Rob your Miracle God can do special things for people he can deliver them supernaturally and then somebody will say well there wasn't nothing big about that you know it was just this this I can't tell you the times I've had people call me on the phone and say we're on our way to emergency right now my brother's having a heart attack and he eats a real bad thing brother Wayne pray pray pray you pray pray an hour later they call you back and say it was a false alarm he just had heartburn oh okay and they're on their way to the doctor and and a stroke is hitting them and they can't speak and they can't move their hand and you go to prayer and two hours later they call you back said they can't figure out what happened it was a false alarm no it wasn't amen that devil was on his way but God stepped in the way you ought to give glory to God somebody trying to make it like you're making something up you ain't making something up the God of Abraham is Supernatural and moves from the church and he deserves glory for what he does don't you let that devil Rob the supernatural out of your life well it didn't happen yeah it happened yeah it was God yeah it was Mercy yeah it come down in your life and he spoke to you and you ought to hold on to it he said preacher how do I hold on to it Paul said to hold your confession hold the confession of your faith because he is the high priest of your confession you want to know how to hold on to hold on to send it when you don't feel it when you wake up in the morning and you know God delivered you but you don't feel any different you did on Friday you got to tell that devil you don't you don't gonna lie to me no more you ain't gonna trouble me no more I know something happened I know God slept in my life and I'm not giving up my testimony somebody said well I'll tell you what brother Wayne I thought I got the Holy Ghost and got saved but I woke up and I had all kinds of Temptations and troubles and I thought well there ain't no way I get the Holy Ghost do you see how that devil lies let's take it to physical places and when God heals somebody Divine Healing and miracles are different but if God gives you a Divine Healing do you know brother Graham said the pain will sometimes still be there after you have a healing he said the same as temptation of sin will remain after it's long gone after you're already sealed after you're already got the Holy Ghost the devil will tempt you to try to make you believe somehow that Devil's still in there because brother Adam said I don't care how good a Christian you are you'll start confessing you're not and you won't be hey man I don't think y'all to let that devil rob you I think you ought to hold your confession I thank you come on Amen the Bible said man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God every word now y'all got to think about this every word one ain't ever had our Bible has come into effect brother random said every Parable in the scripture are in effect right now so if you want to talk about shamgar your shamgar yeah take your testimony and rip those Philistines if you want to talk about Samson your Samson pick up that pick up that job home pick up that bone of your mouth and go to slaying them devils come on church it's time to remember amen that you are Samson you are sangar you are Tamar you are the Mighty Men of David you are David you are ever type in the Bible you become the fullness of the word in this age and I think it's time to remind that devil and who we are what we're here for and you just keep confessing this word until he backs up do you know the prophet of God said this he said what you need to do is confess the word and you need to say it like you believe it and if you really don't believe it and all you got it is intellectually he said keep saying it till you actually do believe it yeah take the word of God put it on your lips and begin to prophesy against the devil and let me ask you something how does he defeat you with one little thought that's right he comes in your mind with one little thought it's maybe not even a spoken word but God has given you permission to turn around and tell that devil you're a bluff you're a liar you're a Tormentor and a prophet gave us his origin yes Hallelujah I know where it come from and I know where he's going [Applause] I was reading it by study one day in office I was praying I was reading about something I was studying on no eternal hell and I was just looking through some of the scriptures about what happens to the devil I wonder what happened to my enemy I want to know what God's going to do with him but you know the Bible said he'll throw him in to the Lake of Fire which burns he's going to throw him and brother man said like this he said those demons will have an end he said God will completely annihilate them I was sitting in my study and read that out loud and there was a rat about this long went running right through my room I don't have her answer we don't have rats in my house there's no rats there at all that Devil Couldn't take that word being read over that room and then they say it over this congregation tonight that Devil's a rat he's a liar he's a bluff and he's got an end from it every time he tells you about your past and tell him about his future God didn't make the hell for sons of God he made it for the devil and his angels and Satan will be burnt with his own fire there's an end coming to this devil so well I'll tell you what he wants to come around and bug me we'll go ahead and just sit down right here devil let me tell you a story let me tell you a story that you won't forget yeah so by the way you look like a sinner maybe in your eyes but in God's eyes brother Madam said he put the blood over us cover our mistakes and no man might think you're a sinner go can't even see the sin say it till you believe it well I don't know if it'll change it'll take the paralysis out of your life and let you walk like a Christian that's it yeah listen to me even the devil's going to paralyze you he's going to paralyze your faith or you're going to paralyze him now brother man y'all know how many times brother Graham said it either your faith will paralyze the devil where he can't tread around your life or he will paralyze your faith and you up in your thoughts and your doctrines and your feelings now you say preacher what are your times go back to the Natural it's a spirit I knew a girl a lady in our church sister Dina Nelson I know I've told you the testimony but sister Dina Nelson felt under a stroke she was living paralytic she she literally drove around her leg and couldn't use her arm half of her mouth was gone amen but you couldn't do nothing wrong with a spirit that was inside her and one day at the end of a service on a Sunday morning she come up in the prayer line she said brother Wayne I want prayer that God will heal this body the the the thing will go back like it was and when she come up in the prayer line I prayed for her I said sis now go Testify the healing God's testified to the healing she said but brother Wayne I've got a nurse for a daughter and every time I say that I'm Healed and I'm still crippled she says I'm lying on the Lord she said what I do I said you're going to testify the word of God it is written in the word that every man's word be alive that the word of God remain true come on I don't care what condition you're in that Bible's right I don't care how paralyzed you are that Bible's right I don't care what condition your life is in that Bible is right and if you let the faith come in your heart by the word of God Satan cannot win over that believer amen she said what did I do I said go confess the word of God and say you're healed she come back that evening service got up she's back here about where you are Christopher she got up come walking down the aisle paralyzed dragging her leg dragging her arm come right down there come right up the prayer line I thought I was gonna have to pray for her again I would have prayed for the second time I believe in it amen but you know what when I went to go over to pray for her I said what do you want sis she said I want to testify how God healed me this morning and brother I went to give her a lollipop mic just like this and instead of taking it with her good hand she took it with that paralyzed hand and the power of God I saw the leg straightened I saw the arm straightening that woman danced all over the front of that building because she confess the word of God when she couldn't see it when she couldn't feel it when it wasn't true in her own mind but the word of God is true and it stands forever I'd rather stand on the word of God and stand in the heavens because the heavens could fail Earth can fail but the word of God can never fail you when a man stands on the word of God he's standing in God's word itself now you say preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about testifying that change comes I'm talking about the power of God that testifies of the change that comes in our life listen I want you to know something there's a different spirit in this bride yes sir yes sir you'll say Spirit let's just let's just really quick think about something when you were born in this earth you were born with water blood and spirit now the spirit you're born has to come from somewhere and the prophet of God said the breath of life was permitted to you and it came The Germ of life from your father so when you were born by your first birth you were born in a permissive will of God in a fallen State you got breath but you got no life that's right Walking Dead Men breathing dead men but dead in the soul but watch now that's why no amount of Rehabilitation will help you that's why that no amount of psychology will change you you can you can go to AAA you can turn a new lead you can do anything you want but the spirit on the inside of you is condemned because it comes from a sex birth but God give us a new birth that produces a water a blood and a spirit so if you take the spirit of the new birth you have taken the spirit of God and it comes into your life now if the spirit of God comes into your life now you're in a different world you're in a world of believer [Music] if God is true amen because when God comes into your life his spirit is the spirit of Grace now I just thought about something this morning we were discussing how that that Lazarus come out of the Tomb and God loosed him from this grave clothes we talked about how the Prodigal Son returned and God put Heaven father put shoes on him and wrap him in a robe and we talked about how he was restored you see he comes to life and then he's restored and so is the Church of the Living God but do you see what God does in the end time it's look the spirit that created the world to begin with has moved into the church to restore the church to its original eating condition you know if you if you like to study the Bible do you all know that the world is coming to a great conclusion here pretty soon under Atomic Warfare how many knows this is right do you know the Millennium the whole earth is annihilated for the Millennium and we walk upon the ashes of the wicked and there's not root nor Branch left now how does that happen the prophet of God said by the atom bomb so the atomic bomb clears it off that's why the devil remains till all the way through the Millennium to the end of the Millennium now watch he remains chained by circumstances he can't do nothing because he ain't got nobody to do it through so he's changed by circumstances but at the end of the Millennium God raises up the wife from judges the devil and his angels cast them in the Lake of Fire and then burns the Earth for the second time but this time he does it with Holy Fire every hybrid everything that ain't original every demon every devil will be completely burnt off of the face of the Earth and you said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about God says I will give you a new spirit but then I will put my spirit on the inside of you and God can come and deal with your spirit and he can change your life but when the spirit of God begins to come into the church it renovates the soul and the original renovator can you think about this if you're going to renovate a house let's just take a house you're going to renovate a house and the greatest renovator in the entire nation lives in your neighborhood yeah yeah and you say Sir would you take my house it's condemned there's no way it can do anything but could you take this condemned house and renovate it and make a mansion out of it and if a man takes the job his reputation's on the line now if you can get that renovator to do the job wouldn't you let him do it and the renovator that will renovate the heavens and the Earth and put the Earth back in its hidden condition has offered if this time and age to come into you by a spirit and renovate your life you got all these things out of order he'll put them back you get all these things out of place he'll set it all right back in order and renovate that life he said preacher what are you talking about you know the Bible said the spirit of Elijah shall return on the last day right brother bam said it's nothing but the spirit of God under the ministry of restoration it's restoring it's you see it's the Holy Ghost it's not another God it's the Holy Ghost but he's in the ministry of restority I shall restore saith the Lord It's God restoring the Church of course when he begins to restore the church he has to shove out everything that don't belong there oh God yeah now now you all know it's a spirit right it's what we're talking about it's a spirit do you know that whenever you start exposing a devil it starts losing his power that's right y'all know that right when you start exposing a spirit that starts losing its power now if you let's just say while you're preaching I've seen it happen a lot of times why I'm preaching a certain Spirit maybe is affecting the congregation or expecting certain lives and when God starts dealing with that Spirit you can almost now brother man could literally see a black streak that would move but and I've never seen maybe more than once a black street I've seen it but not maybe more of once or twice as the most but I've literally could almost sometimes it's like they're the only person in the building I'm probably saying too much right now but I'll just say it like this it's almost like that person is isolated there's a whole congregation but it's just an isolated person and then in a second oh there they are right there and those two Spirits are connecting and they're literally uh how could you say it they're actually obstructing the moving of the spirit or they're blocking the channel of the gift that's working in the Pulpit because Satan is being brought out and exposed that he's going to lose his position he's going to lose his place to hide because we're moving we're moving to you can can he get it like this the devil don't care where he hides can I say this now I'm a hillbilly I'm sorry I just come from the hills I'm a real simple guy but back in the summer y'all got copperheads up here I never seen one in Ohio but comprehend we get comprehends rattlesnakes cottonmouths and we live right next to a creek so we had all three on our property and and you know what I found out if you go outside on a warm evening and you and you go out and you see a big Copperhead laying there and if he sees you and you pick a hole up and you're gonna cut his head off he'll Run for the closest whatever he don't care if it's an old boat laying on its back he don't care if it's a weed bed he don't care if it's a pile of wood he don't care if it's a couple sheets of tins he does not care where he hides so long as he escapes the end of that hole and the devil don't care where he hides he'll get into a little Grudge just in your family he'll get into a little misunderstanding in the church or he don't like me she don't like me they talked about me they don't believe me well they just see and the devil will get right in there and whenever the gift of the Lord starts working in Ministry those spirits will start getting together and they'll try to withstand that preacher amen and while he's preaching you won't even realize it the congregation but you'll think why is he acting like it's something wrong why has he not got that fire today why ain't he really just preaching away right now it's because there's a resistance against him and he's standing there preaching against that Spirit now you Faithful what you ought to do when you see that happening you ought to literally stand on your feet and say preach it preacher preach it preacher preach it preacher preach it preacher because what you're doing is you're Excavating that Devil's spot to hide come on if you expose him you'll have to leave come on you think about this right now but if that happens in the black if that happens in the in the uh serpent world or in the devil world what about the light of God that begins to move in a in a spirit likes in this building tonight when that Liberty's there and the power of God is just coming one word upon another you know what's actually happening that light in you is connecting with that light back there and back there and over there and after a little while it just starts jumping back and forth and after a while the old church is just a radiant light of the glory of God and the angels are moving and God is moving and energy and strength and anointing and Healing Begins to come into the church because the power of God is taking over the building faith is rising in its anointing what's going on amen God is moving God is moving do you know brother Brown said the devil ain't nothing but a shadow now he's a real devil but he's a shadow in the light of God I was preaching one preaching one day at home with the home church and I was preaching right away I talked about the woman at the whale and when the Vindicated word come up and started talking to her vindication killed the spirit that had been directing her life and she was a free woman and I said something along the line she never was a prostitute to begin with but nobody had ever offered her a higher thought than religion or Pharisees but when the Redeemer come he took her back to the original thought that God had and the thought he offered was so high it lifted her above her physical life and when I said that I looked in the back and there was a black cloud come right out of the Pew like a like almost as big as my jacket I've seen it rise right up out of the back toward the church and hit the ceiling and go out like that and I started to just let it go and finally I said no I'm going to prove to the crowd it's happening right now and I spoke that and told what happened and the lady in the back started screaming and shouting because it actually had took place the spirit had left her under the Vindicated word what's going on in this building right now the foolishness of preaching is pushing the devil out of the mind of the Church of the Living God I charge the devil in the name of Jesus Christ he's a trespasser and a squatter and he don't have any right in the church he has no legal claims on you at all now I know brother Branham actually takes a a there's actually a place in the in the message where there's a two women sitting next to each other one's got a hay fever another one's six the Indian lady brother random I could read it to you but I'll just I'll just tell you what it is basically and and they were sitting there next to each other and brother Brown discerns the woman and when he looks at the woman he said ma'am he said you I see you got hay fever I see you real sick he said God just heals you and then the morning he says this he stops and says now the lady sitting next to you is sick also take your hands and put on her and begin to pray in the name of Jesus now watch this they both come in under a spirit they were both sick under a spirit but when the prophet began to deliver the girl the delivered woman and turn and put her hands on The Other Woman and brother Brown said she's healed I see it leaving her now he said I see a light coming from the woman pushing that dark Spirit out can you imagine hey man standing there you don't think your hands are powerful you don't think your faith is powerful but listen to me if there is a teaspoon of God in you all Heaven is on the inside of a Believer that's got the Holy Ghost you tell me has God got a weak part I'll tell you no he's all-powerful he's all-knowing and it don't matter where he's at he's still God and he's still got power Glory he's a preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about the power to push out every Spirit that's unlike God's in this building right now and it's in you and all you've got to do is start pressing against that thing and tell it it don't belong there amen there ain't nothing wrong with you there ain't nothing wrong with your preacher there ain't nothing wrong with this message there's an invisible band trying to cut off your hearing and make you hear things a certain way make you even understand your own misunderstand your own Pastor make you misunderstand the ministry make you misunderstand your family make you in every time you misunderstand somebody that builds a cage he said preacher why are you saying I'll tell you why I'm saying it because I was reading one day and the spirit of the Lord actually put it on my heart he actually showed me Amen in the scripture where people had misunderstood and what it caused in their lives do you know brother Branham actually tells us amen that we have got to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks that's how we overcome now we recognize the devil every one of his tricks and we've got to recognize the devil is real some people say there's no devil it's just a thought he said now there is a real devil he's just as real as anybody he's a real devil and you must recognize that he's real you must know that he is a devil but at the same time you've got to recognize that the devil and he's against you but to overcome you've got to recognize that God is in you greater and mightier than he is [Music] now brother Bradham actually y'all y'all heard the story uh brother Brown said he saw a vision with people and they were in that in those bars of Hell remember that he said in big old bars and he said the person said brother by them deliver the people they're good people you remember he says that in the vision he says they're good people have you ever noticed there's a little something in there he says you have been misunderstood oh my God you mean that we're good people they were good people but they were in bars because they had misunderstood but you know what that was made a misunderstand it was a spirit it was a spirit that made them hear things at a certain skew made them hear things a certain way now listen if you could just move that band off you can hear the message with clarity you can hear your ministry with clarity you can hear the tapes with clarity now right now I believe this with all of my heart I believe that Jesus Christ defeated Satan and every one of his powers at Calvary I don't believe another drop of blood has to be shed for you stripe has to be taken but at this moment in time the only thing a preacher can do is point at the finished work of Calvary and if he can preach the word and by faith you believe it every benefit of the Cross has been made available to you tonight by the hearing of the word of God when you begin to believe this word faith begins to come into your heart so right now by the grace of God I can say to this Satan is a defeated being Satan has no legal rights over the Church of God and he has been put under the foot of every son and daughter of God that is sitting in this building tonight it is written the Bible said he was ascended and set at the right hand of the father and everything has been put beneath his feet come on Church everything is beneath his feet his name is above every name that can be named I don't care what you name it cancer TB I don't care arthritis I don't care what you name it I don't care what disease I don't care what devil I don't care what demon every one of them is defeated and in the name of Jesus Christ he is a mighty conqueror in this building and I exalt him as the ruling Spirit over this church and I say this Satan you can take your leave you've got no legal rights at all in the Church of the Living God now you said preacher I don't know I don't know if all this I don't know about all this well let me tell you this when David Livingstone went to Africa y'all remember the story David Livingstone is a great missionary and when he went to Africa he he wanted to he wanted to missionary and not die so he actually met one of the great African tribes and he made a deal with one of the great Chiefs of the tribe and went in Covenant with a guy he literally went into a blood Covenant with an African Chief and they had to give exchanges for their Covenant and when they when they they actually mingled the blood and and the chief said to David what will you give me and he said he said what do you want chief he said I want that white Coach you were so David gave him his so his sport coat and the African Chief said what do you want for me he said I want your ceremonial tribe I want your spear your ceremony and spear out of your tribe I want the one you carry I want the chief spirit he said well okay so he gave him the chief spear somebody said why do you want that spear for because as he went on his journey throughout the tribe as Africa those tribes didn't know who that man was they had no respect at all for that man but every time he got into a problem with one of the tribes he just held that Spirit up as a sign he was in blood Covenant with the chief of Africa let me tell you this we have been given a message from God that speaks of our blood covenants it's the name of Jesus Christ and every demon that comes against every devil that comes against it the church has got to ride tonight to hold up that name and say Satan and come in the name of Jesus Christ you are defeated let me say this tonight amen the name of Jesus is above every one of them brother brother you remember over there in Indiana the bunch of witch doctors got together you kids know witchcraft's coming in it's all over the televisions it's all over the papers it's all over the books it's novelty now everybody Witches Witches Witches I met three of them some time ago down in the Starbucks sat there and talk they were just sitting in the wide open I sit and talked to him a few minutes just which is everywhere is now but they was there was a bunch of witches together and had a table hovering in the air amen and they said they wasn't nobody could make this table come down that's nobody can overcome our witchcraft do you know what they did they sent from Brother Brown he come in the room with that bunch of witches and when he come over there he said now I want to tell you there is a power that can bring this table down and they said well we'll have to see it he said well y'all go ahead and try so they had grown men pulled on the legs some sat on it they did everything but it just stayed there in the power of Witchcraft brother Brown said now he said I backed up from the table and I said in the name of the Holy Roman Church let the table come down he said it never moved he said I said in the name of William Branham let the table come down he said it never moved he said but so that you'll know where the power is I said in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God come down he said the land's almost broke cause it hit the ground that's power that's in the name of Jesus Christ as power power sitting every devil back to hell that's power could deliver every child of God set it into here tonight we are not weakness we are not hopeless we are not armless we have been armed with the message of the hour the name of Jesus Christ has come into the church what about it when he was trying to hold a meeting and them demons cried they said we'll tear down the tent we'll take your tent down and brother bam said the storm started coming amen that one in that storm he started coming they're going to tear the tent down he said I turned and looked at that great storm and said in the name of Jesus Christ go back to where you came he said it turned around and returned back because there's power in the name of Jesus to make the storms go back it's power in the name of Jesus to make the devil go back to hell you can make that devil crawl out of this building tonight under the name of Jesus Christ There Is Power in the Blood of Jesus Christ to defeat every devil because if he never disease what am I talking about I'm talking about a powerful people in the name of Jesus Christ the authority of God that has been given this church it's a preacher Richard what are you talking about let me tell you what I'm talking about I'm talking about the Lord is here to remove Every curse I read the prophet he said it like this he said see he said tonight someone's been standing here Bound By An oppression from Satan foul Spirits has tried to put Pride upon her he said endowed here to remove the curse of the enemy God has come into this building tonight to remove the curse of the enemy he said preacher how in the world how in the world do you expect change to happen just in this meeting I'll tell you what what happened to Aaron's Rod when they took it in the holies of holies it didn't take a week to change there was a spirit in there what happened when Jesus spoke to the tree it didn't take a year for change because he spoke to the life that was in it and if you come in here tonight you look at God speaking to the life to the need of the people in this room listen I I know what I'm talking about I'm not standing here tonight just reading you out of a book it's kind of like brother Brown said I went out in California the other day and met a man who wrote A he wrote a book on the gift and brother Brandon said I went out there to meet him I said what kind of gifts you got he said I don't got any I just wrote about him I'm God Anthony I just wrote about him and many times you hear guys talk about the message and they talk about God but they never seen him they've never seen the power of God change situations I don't mean that in a condemning way I mean that in that there is a reality to what I'm talking about there is nothing can you say it with me nothing there is nothing that can stand before the name of Jesus Christ nothing you know I'll just I'll just tell you this as musicians come I'm standing in a meeting in India one time I came into that meeting it was a girl sitting back in the back in the middle of the meeting and when I was preaching I started telling a testimony from the scripture about that hell was created for the devil and his angels now the reason I said that's because when I was at home a young man asked me if if God's so good why is hell so bad and I didn't know one of the other preachers said well it was just a it was just a uh a contrast good and bad and I said well I don't know about that so I walked to the carnival when I did it literally I I'm not I'm not storying to you this is what happened a whirlwind set down on me and I Heard a Voice speak to me and he said he said hell was created for the devil and his angels and right behind it another scripture said to me I was not willing that any man would perish but that all would come unto repentance answering the question because they were trying to insinuate that God wasn't a good God and you know what you know what happened when the spirit of God began to touch that I went into Andy and told that story and there was a girl sitting in there she fell out in the aisle when I quoted the scripture Matthew 12 25 49 believe isn't it hell was created for the Devil's Angels when I said that she fell out in the floor Riley just literally like a snake crawling on the floor later they the deacons had to come and get her they took her out and then later brought her up she just she was a street lady she didn't know anything about religion she just seen the sign coming to come in the meeting they brought the lady up into the prayer line and she singed again common the minute I put my hand on her same thing that demon manifestation started coming out now them brothers in India they didn't mess with that Spirit about 20 of them gathered around wouldn't let it out of the prayer line they just gathered around the thing and we began to pray and the minute the thing hit the ground the woman just right on the ground and when she got up she was sane and sensible completely a different woman from a demonic depressed woman and stood up completely in a right mind in an instant because the spirit left her the spirit that was doing that to her left her in the name of Jesus Christ one of the most amazing things four or five people behind that girl was an older lady real kind looking lady she come in the prayer line through the translator she says I have high blood pressure would you pray for me I started praying for her and I had my eyes closed and I'm praying and all of a sudden I feel something kicking at my shins and hitting in my hands I opened my eyes and this kind old lady has turned into a demon manifestation her tongue sticking out just like a stick out of her mouth her eyes are rolled back and she's screaming at me and squalling and kicking it and then now guys this was on film some words we still have it somewhere I don't remember where it's at now but in some words I still have this we got it on film and she was doing all this well I didn't know so he starts praying for the lady I mean I thought she had high blood pressure so we started playing for the lady and the spirit starts manifesting and we pray for her and prayed for in a minute she dropped right on the floor just like the other lady but when she woke up that same Spirit was there we pray for prayed for prayed for in a minute there she went again she woke up the Same Spirit was on her in a minute I'm looking I just backed off kind of backed off and I know the brothers were watching me and I backed off and I just started looking at her funny and I started praying and I said Lord what's going on here and and just a millisecond he said do you remember the maniac in Oregon they said brother Branham is the man delivered he said no he said he's passed out in the spirit but when he awakes he'll have it because he worships the spirit so I let I told him to take the woman on we finished the prayer line that night the pastor the host Pastor came to me he said brother Lawson what happened in that meeting that you turned and prayed and then you put the woman out and then you kept praying he said what did God speak to you I said he told me she worships the spirit leave it alone let it go on pray for the people he said the same thing happened to me four or five years ago on a Prayer Line same woman he said God told me the same thing he said I'd always wondered what was going on but the spirit of God began began to move amen in in Bombay India the brother that hosted the meetings has just passed away I came into a school building you probably heard me tell it I came into a school building to hold a meeting and when I come in that beat the school building in India that sometimes they don't have the money for a church so they hold it in the school building so we go in the school building they got all these Hindu gods like you got that on the wall they'll have posters but they're Hindu gods because it's a Hindu government and they had these Gods these poster boards all over the wall in behind me when I walked in the room first thing I said was could y'all take them down so I can preach in here I'm going to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ I don't want these things behind me they said brother Wayne we can't touch anything he said we can use the building that's all I said well let it be whatever it is we'll preach the gospel so they filled the room up literally it was just a packed place there was there was preachers about oh I don't maybe 15 20 of them and they were they were about as far as from here to the wall from me sitting on the side like this and the congregation was here and the place was just packed three four five hundred people probably at least 500 and they were packed in there well in the middle of the sermon I was preaching about the absolute of God I'll never forget it I was preaching about the absolute of God a caterpillar when he goes up the tree there's something that is absolute tells him he has to do it see God created the butterfly not a caterpillar right so God said he'd be a butterfly so one day he starts wanting to be a butterfly something comes over him and he says I don't want to climb the tree but something says you're going to climb the tree he said I don't want to get a factory but there's a thus saith the Lord that forces him to a cocoon and when I said that I said in the absolute of gods in this building tonight and I started preaching about the absolute of the almighty God and when I spoke concerning the absolute of God again woman falls out in the aisle literally just falls out in the island this is a totally different meeting total different city one just falls out in the aisle at first at first honest to goodness I thought she was getting a blessing I thought well the woman's got under the spirit but then I felt the spirit it was on Earth it was a real creepy thing and it started coming up the aisle and the spirit of the Lord now of course I was young I just started preaching I just started and I think it was my first or second trip to India and the spirit of the lord gave me the scripture when I went over there Bands To End season and preaching preached the word Timothy remember that so the minute that all this is happening I'm thinking what do I do I just preach the word so I just kept preaching kept preaching kept preaching and then the Lord checked me he said pray for the woman so I stopped there's a brother standing back there a pastor and he kind of cut across I said brother and bow your heads congregation bow your heads let's pray the woman's having a problem here let's pray and ask God to deliver the woman and when I bow my head I started praying they were praying everybody were praying and when we got done praying I I lifted my head and brother Samuel I was going to continue preaching I was going to go right back into my sermon I lifted my head and when I started I don't remember what I was going to say but this is I started to say something I heard myself say if the woman don't rise up from the ground God is not even God why they recovered my mouth I'm serious it scared me what who says something dumb like that God ain't even God's God no matter what happens right right but it wasn't me that said it right and the moment when I said that just in that instant there was a fog a mislike just started filling the room now I don't understand it someday someday if you would get to Glory we'll ask God what it was but it was like a like a mist and fog filled the room this is what those pastors said they said brother Wayne we couldn't see you no more it's like you almost disappeared in a fog upon the platform and when that happened there was a wind started blowing in the room and when the wind started blowing that woman stood up the whole congregation started rejoicing and this wind goes and brother when we turn around and look those posters have been ripped off of that wall and they're laying on the floor this woman standing up the power of God is in the building because nothing can stand in the presence of Jesus Christ I have never in my life if I was in Africa if I was in South America if I was in Europe if I'm in America there is no demon can stand in the presence of the name of Jesus Christ it's a power beyond Powers it's the name of Jesus Christ and I believe he's here tonight to deliver hearts I believe he's here tonight to give Mercy to the need I want you to know something young people the devil's a spirit and he can leave right now in this building under the sound of our voice I believe right now I really believe that I believe you're sitting here tonight with a spirit of Doubt on you I believe you could say brother I don't want that in my heart and God could take it out of your heart right now it'll just leave you just like that you say you got a little Spirit working on you where you feel some jealousy and you don't want to feel that way no more there's a God here right now that'll change that

promise that God has made and he's Vindicated to you tonight there's not a devil big enough that can stand against it or take it away Hallelujah whose report we're going to believe we're going to believe the report of the Lord [Music] what the spirit has said because it's not us and saying it it's a spirit Hallelujah I'm free I'm Healed I'm delivered I feel with the spirit of God Hallelujah or brothers him but I don't want to get in the flesh we've been in the flesh for a long time Hallelujah we confess the promise of God how many remember that time when that man was looking at the screen and the nurse came in and like that testimony brother Wayne was given they kept on testifying and saying God's already healed us and that nurse it wasn't the nurse it was a spirit that was trying to discourage him and it said oh you don't know what you're talking about as far as medically she knew more about the situation but what they knew is the god who's above every situation had already addressed that need and he said what you're looking at is your instruments he said but we're looking at a Divine promise that God made for us I'll tell you tonight we're not looking at a church we are looking at witnessing the resurrected Lord Jesus right here Among Us I tell you the water's troubled tonight it's time to step right into it and take every promise that belongs to us This Is War This Is War how many say This Is War amen it's declaring war on Satan's kingdom his Kingdom's coming down glory be to God singing brother lead us in it now I got joy in my soul [Music] he's attacking every

[Applause] [Music] [Music] you can't have my praise [Music] of love Hallelujah glory be to God and say it clear tonight the devil's not our buddy he's not our friend who's not to be an occupant and I tell you what the spirit of God is set right from the very beginning in this meeting I'll tell you I'll tell you it's a really privilege as a young person but for every one of us in here but as a young person it's one of the first things we can recognize that of how the devil will try to use your mind and you know he'll come to you and you hear it in your own voice and that's why the devil then will play upon that and say well see that's you because it's in your voice but he's a liar because you can judge it by the desire that's in your heart there is a repulsion against that Spirit that's not how I want to be that's not who I am and so you're standing against it and this is why we always want to take our stand with the word of God because it's clear every time that the enemy comes you can always judge that spirit it's always there to try to tear you down to cast you down to bring you down to hold you down that's what he wants to do but the spirit of God is here to lift you up that you can walk in and receive every promise you you know and the wonderful thing about it is is that we don't have to carry the cross we don't have to bear the stripes we don't have to do nothing but accept what he's already done and I think it's so wonderful and so awesome of a mighty God that would come right on the scene right here tonight and would challenge that devil and let it be known that the only thing that's holding us back is a spirit Hallelujah but that spirit's been Cast Away you hearing me that spirit's been Cast Away now what do I do get that place filled with God and you and I are responsible just like if you get a room in your house or your bedroom you get a you know you get a drawer cleared out or you get something then that's an empty space right you got rid of some stuff now you gotta fill it with good stuff you fill it with the word of God you invite the word in you see many times we're waiting on things while I'm waiting on this feeling no wait on what God has spoke to you personally God has spoken to you right here in this meeting how many have witnessed God has spoke to me in this meeting young people you Witnesses of that God spoke to me then as God has spoke to you he has anointed you because that spirit is Cast Away no matter what that Spirit was it's been cast away because Almighty conqueror has come on the scene and he's anointed your heart to stand and believe that now let your life be filled let it be filled with the word of God just take the word of God and fill your life with the word of God because in the word of God Is Power and a confession of what the Holy Spirit brought right here the this this right here today of a confession is very powerful so when God has touched your life just like when it was mentioned right here if salvation has come to your door then right here at this very moment you start with a confession that I am saved I am saved and you keep confession it and you watch your body will obey that confession because what you are confessing is the work of a money conqueror who has come and made something real to you of what he's done for you so what your confession is not empty words it might seem like it sometimes but it's what God has done for you and you watch your life start matching what you're confessing is the power of a confession amen he's the high priest of our confession it's the same way with our healing same way with our healing you know you know you know what maybe tomorrow morning you might feel bad your feelings don't have nothing to do with it there's going to be days you feel like a Christian in days you don't feel like a Christian but you're it is not based on your feelings it's based on the all-sufficient work of the Lord Jesus Christ what he's done in your life and you know it by the desire that's in your heart so what I do feed it with the right things feed your life feed your experience with the right things amen watch God continue to move amen you know what God has come and said here in this meeting I'm with you I'm with you I've been with you the whole time as a matter of fact there's no way that a man could stand right here even if he was sitting in this assembly for months there's no man that could stand right there and go right down the very thoughts of your heart and begin to uncover things but I'll tell you what the lovely Lord Jesus did he went right down and began to minister and you know what he was saying I've been with you the whole time matter of fact I've been the one you've been bumping into you've been bumping into me [Applause] into me so you know I'm the one that you've been bumping into I'm the one that's also been coming to you and bringing conviction in your heart about things in your life what's he doing he's letting us know of his faithfulness and his mercifulness and his loving kindness and if God will do that when we don't deserve it how much more will we reach out and take a promise of God and say Lord I'll take you at your word Lord how much more oh I tell you when we are serving the Living God the Mighty God aren't you grateful for that aren't you glad that he came by oh I'm glad he came by and when any time Jesus comes he never leaves the situation the same we can never be the same I can never be the same person after amen after healing in my body this morning I can never be the same person amen God is an ontime God amen don't you love him oh my what an atmosphere I'll tell you that what an atmosphere that's him that's him amen his love and his care that he comes all the way and God directed a message for you as young people it's for all of us everybody could benefit can you say Amen absolutely but I'll tell you what take it that God he thinks so much of you that God would come right down along the way and begin to uncover things and and give you Victory these are things right now you can put in your script bag and it'll apply to your life the rest of your Christian journey and you can pull it out and whip the devil on every day of the week because these are principles that discerns that spirit amen he's an opposing spirit and you say Amen the door's locked
