circumstances or conditions look like you are still God lord Jesus we're just trusting in you Lord father you every one of these request Lord that was made known here even earlier prayed over lord lord we just lift Lord not only Lord every one of them but every need God every unsp spoken requests Lord we lift it before the Throne of God tonight Lord to know that Lord that you've made a way for us Lord oh God that we can come Lord before the throne of grace that we might find help in the time of need Lord father we're a needy people Lord Lord Jesus we just ask tonight Lord that God that you would just have your way yes Lord Lord we see even how every song has went Lord how the service Lord how that you've taken the things Lord even Lord to the quotes that was mentioned Lord while the prayer was being offered up for prayer request Lord we certainly believe we're in a moment Lord that God that father to know that there is nothing that's impossible with you lord your Prophet Lord would speak to us Lord as Believers as Sons and Daughters of God and remind us of the scripture if thou cast believe nothing is impossible and he said so therefore to you as a Believer there's nothing impossible to you lord it's you you are everything Lord we just Lord ask that you'll come Lord father may you just Lord speak to our hearts tonight Lord oh God speak to Lord every every one of our hearts every need Lord we need to hear from you Lord that's what we need to hear from is from you Lord I pray that God may we just be so CL so inclined with your spirit oh God that Lord heaven Lord would Echo back oh god father to the word that's spoken Lord grant it Lord not only a speaker but hearer Lord may we just be so in one Accord Lord one one mind Lord granted Lord we pray tonight that You' Just Have Your Way Among Us Lord minister to every need Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen God bless you thank you musicians I want to read from Romans chapter 8 we're just going to just pause there just for a moment uh I actually had some things we were going to go into but I just couldn't get settled and the Lord just kept bringing back to my heart as we were in prayer so we just here want to look at this tonight I certainly believe as you we've heard the different requests that's been given and uh had been made and I was out to seen sister Anna there earlier my mother and I went out to see her earlier this afternoon she's doing well the Lord had uh completely uh restored her talking before she ever got to the hospital uh as well as I I didn't see any drooping on the right side at all when I was there uh she was just talking just as normal just as I would know sister Anna you would know sister Anna so uh certainly God is is is always present God is mindful of every one of his children so we just we thank the Lord for that we want to continue to keep in prayer they also when they did all of the um scans and things like that no blockages nothing that was there so um and there her blood pressure had been a little bit elevated and you know I we know understand anybody that's been through anything even a cal and cold or something like that sometimes your blood pressure can be elevated but irregardless we accept nothing but for it to come down that's right and so we just asked that You' just continue to keep her in prayer uh you you also heard the request there for uh sister Ruth Hoyer brother Ed and and sister Ruth and um I just want to say the doctors can look at what they can see and they look at a report but we've got a we've got a greater report that's right amen and I and I I'm not just saying that I mean that we've we've got news and I've just I've just come through even looking at different things the Holy Spirit from prayer later this evening just taking me back through so many different cases where uh even what we've seen here in the assembly let alone brother BMA go through it where they've said it couldn't get well brother BR I think as he talks about he calls out brother Bill da he said the doctor who said Bill da couldn't get well now that doctor's dead and here sets Bill Dow that's right that's right so you you understand it's important of what word we can hear those words but but what matters is is that we know we have a greater report and I think with sister Ruth her uh as it was come to me of her her response and her attitude was it is is I'm not going anywhere until God has finished with me and so that's that's that's that's the truth we're not going we're not going anywhere before that um also sister Michelle I don't think this was given as a prayer request but for sister Michelle you know we've been praying sister Michelle Carper we've been praying because there was a toe that was there that was very infected and she's uh you know uh been taking different medications for it and so forth and then it had been uh probably about a couple months now well here just the other day matter of fact it was just yesterday when all of this here yesterday was coming in is um she uh the pain in that toe that toe was red and there was a red line going up the leg which is um it's it's not good but we want to remember her in prayer they put her on a two antibiotics they've she's at home and if that doesn't turn around then she will have to go to the hospital there on um uh Friday or Saturday here one so we just want to hold our sister up in prayer and then um and then with Brother Bill that they gave their prayer request but did they go into anything with this so with Brother Bill they did the biopsy and uh they they did find that it was a form of cancer that's there but they've caught it at an early early stage and so what they're saying is is that they they either laser surgery or radiation but they want to give they want him to go into radiation he's got to go for a pet hand coming up and so with the radiation the doctor is really confident that he'll make a full recovery with that and plus not lose his voice and so uh that's where we're we're standing that's right we're standing and uh you know so I I just feel impressed of the Lord just here just as the Lord just directed my thoughts a little bit before service and we're just going to take this and preach it tonight Romans 8:31 and I want to just begin with that scripture what shall we then say to these things and that's what I want to speak on tonight what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Pearl or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter we're not goats we're sheep that's right yes sir we're sheep right because we can be led and we know that he's leading us he never abandoned us like we looked at here just the past couple Thursday night lo I am with thee always nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us and I love that phrase there I don't have this in front of me but you realiz more than conquerors that means gaining a surpassing victory that's right we're we're we're not just Victorious we're more than Victorious for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor dep depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as we're being seated we just see where we get to here tonight but I just um it's always a great comfort especially when things are I know when God even when he'll change something there at the last moment I'm confident in him to trust us to trust him to know that he knows what he wants to say and he knows what we have need of then as I sat back there and I'm hearing the comments that's being made I'm listening to the songs I'm hearing what's being prayed and things that you know are just making you aware of it I just say Lord I know I know I knew I was in the right channel but it's just how God brings a little confirmation and I know that no matter how many years that I've been ministering and speaking but I still enjoy those conf confirmations amen but I want to just say it in this way and I want to take that part what shall we say to these things because it it matters what we say and we realize that what we say comes from our thoughts and so it matters what we think upon and a lot of things that we cannot help what thoughts come in we cannot even help the things that we hear reports that we receive but we do have a place that we can take them to and we do have a confession that is greater than anything that the doctors or anyone else that can say and that is the Lord is my healer yes the Lord is my provider yes sir amen God God God is faithful to his word I tell you if there's one of the things that we could say in the the midst of this time and I would say God help us it's one of the things that I have learned within my walk with the Lord and uh and I certainly believe that I'm speaking to others as well and that is this I don't want any time at any moment to know the devil for the devil to know when I'm discouraged that's right right that's so true this is why brother BR said he said if I don't say it out Satan can't get to it is that right out of the seven series said if I don't say it out he can't get to it but you know this is where that even in times that we come into the realities of a sacrifice of praise because there sometimes it's not uh a sacrifice in order for us to praise the Lord sometimes it's very easy for us to praise the Lord there's times it's very easy to come to the house of the Lord there's times it's very easy and you can put whatever after that but then there are times and moments of sacrifice and when sacrifice comes it comes from us overcoming to be able to press Beyond circumstances that are not favorable conditions but yet God gives us Grace when we can think and to remember the goodness of the Lord that's right when we can think that God himself has never failed nor can he fail and this is where that no matter what we have before us it matters what we say concerning these things there's a woman in the scripture that we're very familiar with as the Holy Spirit would take me there and I think of this woman we know her we don't even know her name we just know that she's a woman of sh the shunamite woman and what we know is is that that in her life and in her walk with god brother br will take us in the message respects and brother BR said there's a little story he said no I don't know whether this story is true he said it would seem very fitting he said but remember she's a shunamite she's Gentile but yet here she and herself he says the story recounts when she was a a little girl that she saw or a younger lady she saw a little girl that was surrounded by dogs and and these dogs were going to attack this little girl but here was a man that came out of the Wilderness and those little dogs those dogs that were going to come at that little girl he took the staff that he have and he he he he he removed those dogs uh from harming that little girl and that always had an effect on her life because she knew there was something that was different about that man and brother B said now I don't know whether that's true or not he said but it seems like he said that it could be but irregardless here you find this woman that in a situation where here she comes and she receives a child and the Bible says in first second Kings 4:8 when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the Reapers and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to the lab carry him to his mother and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God and shut the door upon him and went out and she called unto her husband and said send me I pray thee one of the young men and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God and come again and he said wherefore wilt thou go today it is neither New Moon nor Sabbath and she said it shall be well that's right this was her testimony here is an event that I would say the day itself the way it started when they would have left maybe The Breakfast Table the way the course of events had went on this was not even in their mind mind for this event to have transpired it was not even in her thought I think of it what what if you know there are certain things that if we had known I I said this you know before when it came to when when the Lord had taken my dad when the purpose here was fulfilled I thought what if God had let us know that he was going to go in that moment we would have probably hounded him we would have you know kept him in such a place he would have never got any sleep cuz just another day just another moment just another time but you know what God had everything just perfect right I think about it as it was that you know where my brother he had not been here the year before it had been a couple years my brother hadn't even wasn't even here but how that God had things so arranged in a way my brother was here during that time the day before he would leave it certainly was not any event I'll just tell you that was not any event that I look forward to in my life never wanted to see that event come to pass but you know that within it all I know that all those things that times itself that all those times and must they they will come if we T and it isn't it doesn't even have to do with age there's they can be very youthful and where where the time and so forth has come so when none of us have the promise of tomorrow that's why David would say multiple times teach us to number our days teach us to count the moments and to Value every moment that we have and not so much I don't believe that David was talking just about valuing the moments with natural which we do value the moments that we have with family we cherish that when a loved one passes off the scene God's given us Grace in The Vault of our memory there in our spirit to go in and we extract and pull certain memories and we think upon those things from time to time but I I'm grateful that within in the midst of all these things that it's not it's not a finality to us as a Believer neither is it something that we and ourselves have the final say about because there's so many situations within the scripture that we're individuals have said this is it this is the finality but it isn't what man says it's What God Says amen right I still thinking I hope brother you're okay with me using this but as I've mentioned this and given this example in many situations where I've been in Ministry when Brother Ray his finger was only hanging by a thread and here I was um you know falling over the bed from shock from sin and I didn't know what was going on with me but they will me out there and the doctors are the doctor is trying to get him let's just take it off and I mean it was literally on by just a thread of Flesh everything's gone and I remember I went sat out there in the nurses station and I'm there they give me a cup of ice cuz I everything is just blurry to me like blacked out and this then everything starts as coming back and he comes over to me the doctor says hey he says listen he he's your parishioner uh you're you're you know you're his Minister his Pastor right I said yes sir he said look he said these are things right now he says he he's not wanting to accept this he said you look he said I believe there's things he said that God's already said there's things that where it's at the end and about that time it wasn't my thought but about that time it rose up within my heart and I said wait a minute what about Lazarus what about Lazarus it wasn't my thought but what about Lazarus right then and there I just I stood up and I said let's go I'm going to go pray and we prayed well you know the the the results testify for themselves of how God in his sovereignty moves on the scene what I'm saying is is that there's things that can look so leak things that look so dark but listen to me don't begin to speak the darkness speak the word speak the truth yes sir hallelujah it's an atmosphere you you are a Creator you are an amateur Creator you in looking at this and let me just say it like this I I've had individuals that have been around me in situations at times and individuals say well you just haven't been through this you haven't been through that some times people are pretty quick on the trigger to say that and yet here it is there's individuals that have been through that right and little did they know that just like in our situation we had been through that so we're not just saying something even as Believers in things to where well we haven't been through this we're saying it based on the word of almighty God and that's where we're standing when the prophet himself did not could could not see anything in in his body where everything wanted to continue to come up but yet he stood right there and he says by his stripes I am healed he walked away from the kitchen table and it was coming up and he had to swallow it back down by his stripes I am healed that's why the prophet said never if you can help it ever let a negative thought pass through he said but you can't help from them passing through but don't let them [Applause] Roost your testimony always let it be positive amen God is my healer amen hallelujah amen the work is finished amen you might look and say well brother Samuel how can you say that when you're praying for the sick how can you say that with different needs because as the Church of the Living God Mark 16 are the general orders that's right and we've never received any other orders yes sir Lord general orders stand then when they're specific orders those of you in the military know what I'm talking about when they're specific specific then is what is what overrides or moves beyond the general and we stand upon God's word and we don't have to see a vision we do not have to hear a word from God to know I'm the Lord that Health all th diseases they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's what this message came to bring to you and I Hallelujah the prophet said in perfect faith I can have a vision he said but do you realize this is greater than the vision so good so good is that what he said yes it is this is greater than the vision so what was the purpose of the Visions is to make us aware that the God that was is still he's the god of his work I'm want to say this that there is no doubt we don't have here in this scripture setting as I think about it we don't have recorded here all the emotions that no doubt she felt we don't have recorded the emotions that the father felt right we don't have all the battles of the mind that they fought so when we're reading this we're not ignorant of how that there was battles that they had to press through but through it all through all of their battles because there's nothing uh that has taken us by surprise or any strange thing or any temptation but such is common to man but notice within the midst of it of how that she responded within it it shall be well right then she saddled an asked and said to her servant drive and go forward and slack not thy writing for me except I bid thee I'm asking you where did she get the strength that's right that's I'm asking you where did she get the strength to say saddle the ass and I don't want to stop I we're going to go until we get there in other words no turning aside I don't care what obstacle comes up I don't care what other report comes up I don't care what other scan comes up we're not stopping hallu that's so good that's what we're saying to these things right hallelujah it's not new moon it's not a special day it doesn't have to be a special day because I'm a special person by a special God that's been made ready and Redeemed by a special blood Hallelujah aren't you glad we don't have to have a special time or a special thing that God is ever present and we can go to him at any time with any situation with any need I'm glad for that she went up the Bible says in verse 25 and she came into the man of God to Mount Carmel and it came to pass when the man of God saw her a far off that he said to Gesa his servant behold Yonder is that shunamite run now I pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with thy child and she answered what did she say it is well Hallelujah woman of shiman what shall we say to these things Hallelujah it is well are you hearing me that's so good you think she didn't feel like saying do you got a couple hours right you got a little bit of time but she said in her response all is well this was not mind over matter she knew where she had to get to and she had arrived there and for her all is well because this child was a product of the spoken word the same God who gave it is the same God who can raise it back up she didn't understand why did these events happen how did these events happen but where she was standing is a place of Wellness It is Well amen she had come to the place she needed to get to sometimes it takes a lot of Grace and pressing these aren't things I want you to think when we're reading these scriptures these are not things that it was just fingers being snapped and saying well you shouldn't think that way that I want you to understand this tonight if you have you have any understanding at all you understand that's not how I'm preaching this I am not preaching this neither and you know me neither as a pastor have I ever come to anyone who's been in a situation to say snap out of it I don't believe that that shows no that what that does not show faith it shows ignorance go the Bible didn't say we didn't mourn and sorrow it said we don't sorrow as others it didn't say that we don't experience fears but we have a resource that's able to push the fears out it did not say that things would not come around but we have an advocate with the father we have a resource we have a strength that God gives gives us to be able to stand there thank you Jesus I I'm just going to tell you this part even to this right to this moment is a miracle to me I don't know if I don't know if you've ever felt that way but there's times when I'm right in the midst of something and I just say Lord I'm just thankful right now I don't know the answer I don't know how this is going to work out I I don't but one thing I'm just thankful for is the peace you've given me for this situation I would rather have that than have all the knowledge this will happen that'll happen this I would rather have that because that's what'll hold me and guide me through it all because there might be something that will come up in the midst of all that time but when God has spoken and that peace is something that we didn't create this woman of schum didn't create she didn't work herself up into this am Hallelujah but let me just tell you it matters the resource that you have sure do in your life this is a mystery what when we read this and others can read this here's the secret of this she knows she's a daughter of God Amen she has the scripture in an earlier verse of this she saw the man of God and perceived he was a man of God and when she perceived he was a man of God this was before the child come that had been passing by their way and here here he comes by and she says to her husband let's make a room in the house so when he comes here he's got a place to stay in other words I want the word in my home she wasn't waiting for a rainy day she wasn't looking for when things get tight I know him I've seen him he goes by this way we'll just run him down that's not how a Believer approaches God a Believer walks in preparation before adversity strikes are you hearing me she had already made way for Elisha a place that he could come as a prophet of God one who had the word of God she made room she had respects Hallelujah am I tell you what if there's anything we need to make room for in our lives it's for the word amen if there's anything that we need to make room for it's the word in our homes because let me just tell you something adversity will strike Jesus said in Matthew 7 he said look it's going to strike But be sure where your house is builing if it's built on a rock or built on a sand the same storms the same winds the same hail everything is going to come but it matters what is in your dwelling amen just be honest with you friends I don't know how people face it without knowing where they're standing with God I don't know how they do that right because let me tell you something when the Bible said remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth I I don't just look at that scripture when it says lest the evil days come not I just do not look at that scripture and think oh that's just for teenagers I it's for all youthfulness while you've got your right mind right while you're in your right mind why you've got your health now is the day of salvation now is the time to let him be the Lord of your life because there's going to be adversity strike and you're going to need an anchor an absolute something that is greater than your abilities to pull you through anchor you and stabilize you through it all glory brother Samuel I've got the church you need more than just the church you need a personal Jesus having a church body to pray for you love you and care for you is wonderful but you've got to know this Jesus yourself there's got to be an opportunity where you made preparation in your life yes sir I just passing on by I don't need it right now I know I'm not just speaking here uh to the to the audience right here but this is going out streamers and those are archived for everyone it's very important amen and when I say making room for the word I'm not talking about mentally agreeing with it I'm talking about where you've made room in your life for the person of Jesus Christ to move in there's a space in your life that says this is reserved for him there might have been other guests that wanted to come by and said can I stay in that room nope that room is reserved for the man of God there might have been other things that want to come by and say can I have your testimony nope you can't have my testimony GL it's reserved for him my life is reserved for him my emotions are reserved for himall it matters it matters because adversity comes and I'm just going to stay very very be very clear with this L sometimes when adversity strikes people can become religious it now and you know what God knows all about that let me just tell you this right now God will heal lives and hearts that he knows won't even continue to serve him he's done it many times he'll do it you know why because God's love for Humanity right yes sir very true glad it ain't limited to you and I but I was would say this right here I would rather have the healing of my soul than to have the healing of my body because this body it can get sick again but you know what was important is she had made room for the word in their life Satan you know had come in there and like how brother Bram dramatized that Satan said when he saw this child 12 years old this child had just come to the age of accountability and Satan said I'm going to get rid of it now I want you to think about something for a moment how are you going to destroy a word from the Lord are you hearing me I'm not talking about the flesh body but the flesh body was a visible form that the word that was spoken that entered into her mind received in her heart came forth in her womb was standing there before her she had cared for thus saith the Lord for 12 years that's so true Hallelujah come on now think about in your life what is it that's brought the birth in your life what is it that's brought forth Christ in your life it took a word from the Lord in this generation we were baren people are you hearing me baren people might have had charismatic Spirit everything else around but we were baren people right but God came by our way amen and since that time listen since that time for 12 years she had been caring for that boy any mama knows what I'm talking about I know what I'm talking about not only do I have my mama sitting here that constantly will check on me even right now 48- year old boy Samuel you need to be doing this and that's she ain't tell me what to do but you need to be resting you need should be doing this honey Sam you should be how's everything I'm praying for you always getting text I'm praying for you but I know I also see the boys I see their mama there you go there you go like the other day we were sitting the Chick-fil-A and she looked over Paul he came over to the table she said she said Paul Paul Paul Paul have you ate now he's working he's working I said what were you going to do if he said he hadn't ate what were you going to do that's good go back and look up the managers and say hey wait a minute I know she's a little old thing but don't you touch her boys that's right that's right let me just tell you something right now you and I that are born of the spirit of God that New Jerusalem Hallelujah is mother of us all Hallelujah and God said our names are written in the palm of his hands thank you Lord no man can plck them out Hall nothing can take you out God has watched over it same thing in your life my life what has what has our life once that word has become flesh in our life where it's not just a seed word but now it's a visible Christ moving in our life we see our life being changed we know it Desires in our life what has happened to our life the same way like a mother does to a child it begins to cater to around that child to minister to those needs that's the same way your life and my life as a Believer it has catered around the word that has come to pass in our life sir decisions we make right right and think after after 12 years Satan says I'm going to get rid of this child you know he thought he was going to discourage her that's why brother BR when he responds in in this in the message he said did it discourage her now let's just look at it for a moment there ain't no doubt that her flesh felt discouragement there ain't no doubt in her mind when she's sitting there you think Satan wasn't right there right up next when she had the babe or the child on her knee Satan was all around there and here you have given the word place in your life your whole life has revolved around it look at your son now same thing he came near the prophet same same way he'll come to either of us any of us when things aren't going just exactly that's right the right direction that's good preach yes sir yes come on now I know what I'm talking about oh yeah but here that didn't discourage her there was a respect that she had and when she came there to Elijah Elijah didn't know what to tell her right I don't know he said I don't know what's wrong God's hid it from me right but when they went and asked the question her response is all is well it it matters you know that's overcoming it matters what we say concerning these things it's like when brother brandom says and how can I overcome he says you know he said the doctor says this a direct quote the doctor says you got cancer and you sayoh no I don't got cancer he said oh no you got cancer but remember the god in you is greater and has already overcome it this is what the doctor has said so we're not walking by our imagination we're saying okay this is what the doctor has said but hallelujah it's like if this is the doctor's report right here I'm not going to let that be the top report there's another report [Applause] Hall Satan wants to try to move this around no there's another report God is higher he's greater BR says what if she would have come up and said you said you was a servant of God right you hypocrite m I do believe you ain't nothing but a Holy Roller it had never have happened that's right God tries us sometimes to see what we'll do but she run you know the scripture she run up to his feet and she worshiped like she was to God she recognized God was represented in that Prophet she wasn't worshiping the prophet because listen the prophet would have had derer and stood her up like he did John on the ale of patas right amen but what she recognized is it was God in that Prophet she was not worshiping that Prophet that's why they look at you and say man worshipper I'm not worshiping a man but I recognize that what I have received is not the thoughts of a man it's the thoughts of God so I am worshiping God in the way you call crazy in the way you call heresy this is God's thoughts concerning his word and I am worshiping the Living God [Music] and here he was he walked up and down the floor but she I want you to catch what brother Bram says here I I didn't post these but I just want you to listen as I refer to it she was a reverent woman praise God a woman that respected him a man that respected him and believed him to be a man of God yeah and he walked back and forth up and down the floor until God answered praise God that's so good you know Brother Carlos think about that here she goes to there and he says go take the staff to Gesa she's not moving I'm not leaving until you come I'm not leaving here until you come and when the prophet gets back there the prophet does not walk into the courtyard of her house nor up there to the room with a direct word from God that's right he doesn't know what to do that's so good Hallelujah he doesn't know what to do you've walked in and we'll walk in and so have I and will I walk into situations that I don't know what to do I don't even know what do I begin to even say but if you just obey the Lord Lord I I'm here just to be a servant I'm here just to be a channel if I can be a help in any way Lord if if you can use these hands if you can use these lips Lord You're the vine I'm the branch if there's anything Lord that I can do amen hallelujah you know what that kind of an attitude brother Bram relates that to you and I of how he says God took over Elisha he said just like God will take over your life he said it'll start little by little he said if you just let him he'll just take it all over he'll crowd everything else out he'll crowd out all malice he'll crowd out all bitterness he'll crowd everything out if you'll just let him he said Elisha let everything be put out and it was nothing left but God I said Lord grant that Lord I I want more of him there's more room for him when when I if I'm still here that means there's still growth am there's more I want him to take over completely that's why brother Brown described when he laid himself on that man that had been run over I think it was on them railroad tracks the man was dead and brother Brown said I laid on that man and he said before long here the warmth came back in that body and eventually he said the man was speaking to me what happened God took over hallelujah what happens in your life God takes over prise name Jesus Hallelujah this isn't something we're working ourselves up into this is something that God is doing that's why it pays to have good friends yeah sure does yes there was a guy on a cop one time he had four friends pay to have good friends those were some mighty good friends cuz those friends did not just look at his condition and say just make sure I'm in your will just make sure things are all right with me no those guys were good friends oh yeah you know why they knew what he needs is to get in the presence of Jesus Amen so they packed together ain't that amazing you got four people together there were four corners like it were like carrying the Ark of the Covenant they were in agreeance like the for anointing isin't it amazing you get people in agreeance and Harmony you know all it takes is just get Jesus on your mindall when you get the Lord on your mind it'll bring Unity because when you go to think about him you cannot be disunified right Hallelujah and needless to say you know the end of the story the Bible said the Lord was present there to heal him and they got him where he was at important to have good friends right this is why the scripture when it when said whosoever receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet's reward brother Braham said that's to be a friend of a prophet he said if they want to know what a prophet's reward is it's to be a friend to the prophet that's a reward he's your friend why you've received him in the name or the characteristic of a prophet you've recognized this is God's spokesman for the hour you've given the word place in your life you've given it place in your home and not just place I I believe with all my heart that as Believers it's not us just giving the word a little place and saying you can only stay right here but when we have made place in our life it's to say you're welcome amen throughout the entire house not just on the welcome mat but you're welcome in every door of my house you're welcome in the door of pride in the door of faith in the door of selfish you're welcome throughout the house if you want a sandwich the refrigerator is yours hallu be careful who you invite with that invitation brother BR said it's like the shunamite woman it might come in handy sometime being a friend of the Prophet Hallelujah it come in handy for me how about you amen hallelujah glory be to God oh Lord have mercy I getting ready to give another test want to he but I I want to just make this next statement here out of John 11 verse 21 the Bible said then said Martha unto Jesus here they come man everything this the tragedy that had taken place and Martha I want you to remember this see God has situations sometimes that knows how to get us out of our comfort zone Martha was the one he spoke to before and said you're so cumbered so Laden with so many other things you've you you left off the important things M remember Mary Martha was in here you know and this and that and doing this and that and this and and Mary just dropped it all when Jesus came yes and that's where Jesus told Martha you're so cumbered with so many things see God God knows how situations to aay things and rising and it it opens up in so many different ways and she said if thou Hast been here my brother had not died but I know that even now I love those words I know even now amen I think how brother brandham over and over he talks about sister Weaver who he baptized where they didn't even give her to the next day to live because she was ridden with cancer but she walked into the Waters of baptism they wheed her down in a wheelchair and took her in and baptized her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ she was healed completely what am I saying even now that's good even now oh yes amen that's no matter what situation no matter what you have before you what we have before us as a church as a family even now Lord even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it Thee I want to remind you when you have been born of the spirit of God and you pray according to the word he said ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it he said it's the spirit of Jesus Christ praying through you so it's not you just asking something it's him praying through you Hallelujah there's a need that you have and there's a request that is being made known ask the father anything in my name and I will do it even nowall so good think about it when he stands there you know you you know the scripture how it goes yes Lord truly truly you know he he wouldn't have died but I and I know I know he'll raise you know in the resurrection well that's true but Jesus had to help her to understand I am the resurrection and life even for those that are going to be raised I am that resurrection and life I am the Fulfillment of the needed atonement atonement my life will atone it will raise up all that have been tied to that scarlet cord I am the resurrection and life he was announcing that I'm not in the future nor am I in the past I am even now I think I think if they could say anything right now regarding no matter the situation the reports and things that we every listen even now yes brother Samuel I know there's not good statistics on this but there's greater [Applause] statistics yes let me tell you something friends if when we hear the word cancer if we never had ever heard or witnessed one person be healed of cancer we might have a right to doubt out and yet we wouldn't because he said I'm the Lord that Health all thy diseases Hallelujah but because we have witnessed it even in our local assembly yes amen I thank God for testimonies throughout but we've witnessed that here so when we are praying for the needs of others here and other places we are praying with also a direct witness to know that God still heals [Applause] cancer well brother Samuel we don't know the outcome of this we didn't know the outcome for Sister Rita we didn't know the outcome for others but we know this that God is faithful to his word and we're going to stand with general orders on the word of they shall recover that's what he said amen and there's no higher word than his word and the prophet says it like this he says if we receive it in the spirit by his stripes I'm Healed there is no higher court of appeal I say oh God let it just let it resonate Let It Drop in there let me say this to you right now we could go on and on with this but this is very important and what shall we say to these things this is why the prophet could take even John Ryan and take others and say say it and say it over and say it over and say it over and say it over oh brother brandom I don't know if I believe it he said say it till you do believe it Hallelujah that's good hallelujah hallelujah and here's where here's where it was at take away the stone I mean brother Brian here they are they're going through a grieving moment right brother you don't show up to a funeral and say hey um can you go out there and get me a cookie right you don't show up to a funeral and the people that are up there at the casket and you make a request and say hey would you mind get me a chair so I can come sit down over here and talk to you a while no you either one of you if you heard somebody do that you'd be looking for a cane that you could that's true but look what Jesus here's the faith take away the stone it' been one thing if he asked some men who had nothing to do with this and these men might have been Stout men but he asked them who had the present need them who were going through a moment when they had lost their brother and the Jews think about it they had made a stand for this word they had made room for the word in their house that's right and a situation of Crisis a dark hour arose and the Jews were geed you think the Bible said they were murmuring those around I wonder where that preacher is now I wonder where that reality is they talk about that message I wonder where it's at now look at their brother they had bore a reproach for walking with the word amen how many knows that's true you bear reproach for walking with the word but I'm just going to say this I want to go on record anybody else want to join me I'm glad to Bear the reproach for him he bore everything for me I'm glad to bear that reproach what shall you say to these things he's worthy take away the stone amen hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah but tell how do they roll that stone back I don't know but all I know the Bible said didn't they he said to Martha but the Bible says then they rolled away the stone they had to come some Unity that's good that's why we need one another that's why when we go through things even as a church we need to stand there to encourage one another am amen listen friends Satan even through this where Co hit us a few years ago wanted to so divide people so separate things to where now listen we've got to press Beyond those divisions what do you mean by that I what I'm talking about pressing on divisions is that even being that much more intentional of saying when somebody comes on your heart call them send them a text I'll just wait and see them at church shame on you you God's giv you a phone God's giv you a voice don't underestimate what God's called you to do how do you know obeying the word might be the very thing to break that complex in your life hallelu come on well nobody hears me real well nobody D you got to break that complex how do you break it break it by the word hallelujah God has equipped you Satan wanted to so bring barriers and division if there's ever a time we need one another it's right now to encourage one another Hallelujah say brother I'm praying for you you know may don't even have to call them send them a text I'm praying for you brother I'm praying for you sister somebody's going through it be intentional amen it I'm just going to going to preach on myself for a minute you can listen sometimes the things I get I overthink too much I've had different ones of my buddies that been in different things other ministers other places too and sometimes they get in my mind I'm not going to I I want to text them but I know they're getting bombarded they they're getting everywhere and I I just don't want to labor I don't want to I don't want to you know be you know where it and yet I'll text any other any other time said God forgive me because what is it even in my mind at that time of oh it might be too much they're getting text from here well let's load it up amen let's load it up ding ding ding because Satan sure don't do that Satan is there to bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing notify you of why you can't have it notify you and he's there to put everything in front of you of remember this one and remember that one remember what the prophet told us in greatest battle ever fought yes oh remember how many we prayed for here and this is what happened remember how many we prayed for here and this is what happened prise the Lord that's so good but God's word Can't Fail that's right that's what we say to these things so what do we do we take away the stone Glory let me end with this one the Bible says Paul mentioned this when he was leading song service so I said well I'm going to have I'll go have to go ahead and I have to mention it was already in my notes from but I said I'm going have to mention it when Jesus was in the ship and he told him get in the boat we're going to the other side they got in the boat that day I wonder if they might have thought they were going to have a nice outing right maybe they had a nice picnic lunch and they was going to go out there and enjoy themselves but a storm arose an unexpected event don't you just love those things that are unexpected that put a kink in your plans no we don't I answer for all of you no we don't we become like rabbit on wiy the pool what do I do there had been a there had been you know it was so orderly on things this has to be done this has to be done this has to be done oh my goodness what do we do but we're going to go to the other side and I'm just going to say this we're going in the Rapture amen we're going in the Rapture amen and we're going to overcome all along the way I don't know what the storms are I don't know there's storms that we have just heard about that we have had requests for right here I think as I I stood here yesterday early afternoon and in prayer I'd received one text then I received another even of another situation where a sister was taken to the emergency room I just I already made at that point I just had sat down and started to listen to another message and I just I text the brother back I said look I said I'm going to pray right now I just got up out of the office came right over here I said Lord here we have reports all around us and I hadn't even heard about sister Ruth I didn't hear about that till I got home last night there's reports all around us but you're faithful you Lord you permitted you knew all these things sure that's right you're the god to see us through it all that's right yes sir and there's there's more than just that right there there's other needs that may not be something of physical or that may have terminal attached next to it but there's other needs that's here present but I want you to think brother Bram just takes it like this and he says it in the manner when he talks of that account they were on the sea and this is what's very important he was already in their ship that's good if he's not in your ship you want to get him in your ship that that's that's very important you don't want to start off without him you don't want to start off without him cuz there's two accounts right one account they started off without him the other account which is the one I'm referring to right now is they had to go wake him up he was present that's good but they had to wake him up you know brother brand says that in the he says it in the the message he says when you've went to the doctor and he says the doctor has says there's nothing else that can be done he said for your cancer for your arthritis for your nervous trouble he goes through a whole list of things right he says when the doctor has said all of that he said but you've got to remember who is it that has healed leukemia who is it that has healed you in the past who is it that has delivered you before see look back and remember he's still the same God he's still in the ship what must we do wake Jesus gowake Jesus Hallelujah because all it takes is for him to step forward and to speak to the storm amen yes amen amen I think I just just want to close them that point of it I think of the things here just I'd seen one of the services that brother Donnie had ministered right after sister Erica good and uh one thing that I look at is within it his sister Erica passed but cancer didn't take her amen same thing with those some one some one one brother that maybe some some of you know he was very dear friend to us here at the church and other places with Brother Steve Johnson cancer didn't take him it was it was brother Steve's time to go right that's right the same thing with sister Erica now that don't make sense to us are you hearing me it doesn't make sense right but yet what I say within all of that I really appreciate it well to me to me the testimony that when as brother Donnie came with that right there he says I'm still going to pray for everyone with cancer that comes to be prayed for and I'm going to believe God even more nowall because God's word Can't Fail amen I tell you friends we're we're we're not defeated we're not defeated we're more than conquerors and it matters what we say to these things amen I say oh God let it be the testimony out of our life all is well Amen Let It Be the testimony even now even now Hallelujah whatever whatever it is even now all is well how can you say all is well because I've met the God who changed my life I know I'm in his presence how shall he not freely give us all things he knows what we have need of what shall we say to these things I say by his stripes I'm Healed Hallelujah I don't just say that for you brother Bill I say that for sister Ruth Hoyer prise God I'm telling you right now we received that report yesterday I'm not thinking about funeral prise godall I know those are words sometimes that can literally sometimes when it comes it can literally just shake you but there's a God on the inside there's a God who provides us with sufficient strength in that moment to be able to say all is well guarantee if we could do a FaceTime call with sister Ruth here today and put her on the screen right now we could ask her and say is all well with your family she'd say all is well if we ask sister Ruth is all well with you and brother Ed all is well hu is all well with you and your house all is well it's all well with you and your health all is well because we're not looking at the symptoms we're looking at the God who is greater all is well Hallelujah glory be to God in the highest hallelujah hallelujah musicians Come Bless the Lord hallelujah what shall we say to these things amen hallelujah oh Hallelujah I thank God for his Mercy tonight Hallelujah I thank God for his Mercy yes this is how I feel many times Lord thank you for Lord allowing me helping me to be sensitive to catch what you want to say what shall we say to these things I say if God be for us who can be against us who can come in many different forms but we know who we know who who the who is and that who is the devil but who can be against us if God before us how fitting Paul singing that song as I come out here to read that text they don't know but if our God be for us amen hallelujah if our God be for us hallelujah right hallelujah hallelujah I say what an encouragement we can take right here tonight what shall we say to these things Lord oh but Samuel my loved ones going this way but what shall we say to these things oh but they're they're going so far away everything they're doing is so contrary to the word let me remind you the two boys who were in the corner sister Hatty Wright Sons were laughing at what the Prophet was Sav brother Bram brings out the details of it and high I've heard but now I see oh brother Samuel They're laughing at me h brother BR said God can take the critic out of a service right here today and change that person's life he said and they'll be testifying tomorrow night that's the God yes sir he's a god of paradoxes hallelujah what shall we say to these things what shall we say I said say don't let our testimony be negative that's right Hallelujah that's right hallu let's look to him these needs that we have Among Us right here in our own assembly God's brought us together I I I I I listen every other need I get needs I get requests that comes up on text threads and things from around the world and things like that and we I pray for them right but right here God's put us together their needs that we have as an assembly that we would pray for one another individuals as I said before where we I say God if there's one thing that we can even look at this Lord help us to break Beyond even bar barriers help us to move beyond that and to encourage one another I know some there might be something that seems a little natural but listen let's break beyond that because Jesus said to Martha take away the stone but both of them rolled away the the stone somebody might just need a little bit encouragement that's so good brother Samuel do you need encouragement I sure do and God knows just when I need it God sends it send a little sometimes just a little text a little little something that'll come along the way God knows he knows what we have need of yes and let me I said that tonight as I told on myself don't allow the enemy to tell you you're going to be a bother to something somebody or they're oh they're just going to think you're no no if it comes on Your Heart Right do it that's so good do it so good amen amen you said amen amen amen what shall we say to these things let's let God have have full preeminence let him have full place in our lives in everything because certainly we know things come just as they are now but God will see us through he'll see us through amen you believe that I believe that I believe that amen hallelujah let's stand as they're preparing let's just offer a word of prayer here Heavenly Father Hallelujah Lord God now we want to say Lord this is our response if God be for us who can be against us Lord by your grace we are standing Lord by your grace we'll Cress every wave Lord Lord Jesus it's you that gives us the strength like you did Lord to the shunamite woman like you did Lord to Martha and Mary like you you did to the disciples that were in the boat that was overcome with the storm you gave the strength that was needed Lord and father here tonight Lord Lord that's the desire that no matter the situation if Lord fear or something has wanted to come along may we may we wake Jesus wake you lord lord if there be one Lord even under the sound of my voice Lord whether here over the Internet that you're not in the ship maybe Lord they haven't provided and made room for you like that shunamite woman Lord maybe they are making room maybe there's that place in their life where you're working on their life Lord even now and their hearts Lord are just saying I want this word to dwell Supreme supremely in my life God I pray that you'll just continue to strengthen each one that Lord Lord that you might occupy their life completely may you give strength Lord Lord I pray God to the hoer family yeah Lord to others Lord that are facing Lord moments Lord where of great tests and trials things that we lord have heard and received that Lord would literally just take the wind seemingly out of ourselves but we are looking to you you Lord Our Testimony all is well not because of a doctor's report but it's because of you Lord we're looking to you and we ask that God that in every one of these needs every situation may your grace Lord be ever so near Lord God May Lord Faith Lord just move Lord and blossoming for the will of God lord and each of their lives Lord for Lord we believe Lord we believe your word God I think of sister Anna there tonight Lord in that hospital God how we thank you Lord for keeping your hand upon our sister Lord we pray that God that you'll just continue to move Lord upon her life oh God Lord that every one of those levels and readings would come right in line where they need to be Lord God granted Lord we ask these things Lord father for our brother Bill Lord as he Lord moves into that time lord of the treatment father you're in control Lord God lord we're looking to you that Lord if that be the pathway Lord we know that God even now Lord it's nothing for you Lord to remove that growth completely we still stand on that Lord Lord if radiation is the Avenue you choose and we are praying Lord we know things have side effects but that's why we are praying oh God Lord for your hand of Mercy Lord God that Lord you will completely Lord restoring our brother Lord where Satan is wanted to hinder his voice Lord God not just from singing Lord you've been a wonderful song leader but I think Lord God throughout the years there's two words that I can remember when times got tough brother Bill would say go forward so Lord here tonight Hallelujah like the little woman Lord the shite woman we're saying Lord from our hearts go forward we're going forward Lord in the promise of of your word Hall I pray that God that you would give strength Lord to sister Michelle Lord father you know the needs Lord that are present oh God we're just looking to you that Lord you just move Lord on her behalf you're more than enough Lord more than enough granted father in the name of Jesus Christ this is what we say to these things it is well all is well even now Hallelujah we love you Lord we love you father so thankful God for your presence so thankful for your mercy Lord Upon Our Lives thankful for your grace Lord Glory thankful for that place of safety Lord thank you Jesus we love you father in the precious name of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen let's remember let's continue to pray for one another God continue to give strength as I said throughout those days we don't have all that was recorded but we know the woman of shunan she went through some battles but when she came out of it as she pressed through that I believe there was standing there Hallelujah It is Well I believe one thing for sure I know this we need one another and the prayers of the Saints let's just hold these needs before God hold one another Before the Throne of God just want to say like this Lord help us to be more sensitive and more obedient with just simple things that maybe nobody else would know about but just help us to be simple that when something moves on our heart I'm sure every one of you you've got sometimes requests that's come in sometimes where there I'm not even in a position to get down on my knees not that I believe I have to be on my knees sometimes I'm not even in a situation where I can even actually be alone but I can look at that need maybe it's a text and it'll pop up and the car maybe will read it or I'll I'll be able to see it like that I might be walking right in the store I can slip off to a certain place and say Lord you know the need for my brother I don't want to wait I know I can pray when I get home or somewhere else but even right then Lord you know the need for my brother you know the need for my sister Lord Lord may you move Lord for their need right now oh Hallelujah remember it ain't it ain't great big prayers it's just simple prayers from the heart brother Ram talked about when he went and prayed for that man who was a great Theologian brother Ram actually felt he didn't want to go he felt like why do they need me up there brother Bram came in and he he came over to the edge of the room and this room was filled with with people brother Bram said I thought they don't need me here he went on back home about the time they got home the call came said hey where are you brother Brown said well I figured everybody else up there you know there's a lot of other brothers and Ministry up there I I didn't need they said no he's waiting on you so when they came in that brother was a renowned Minister there out of Louisville brother Brandon prayed for him simple prayer brother brand will say that simple prayer and the internal bleeding stopped to me those things are recorded for you and I to help us to see it
