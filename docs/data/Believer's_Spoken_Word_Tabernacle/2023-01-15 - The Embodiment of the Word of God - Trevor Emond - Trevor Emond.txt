to go is the name of the Lord aren't you aren't you just happy to serve the Lord and just good to be it's good to be a Christian it's good to be in Fellowship amen with one another and most importantly what brings that about is to be in fellowship with God amen and we look at it that you know if it wasn't for him well our paths probably maybe never had crossed I know some of your paths crossed from when maybe you were in this community as younger and so forth but the reality is is right now we recognize there's a greater relationship a greater tie than oh you are my classmate oh I remember you you grew up over here there's something we recognize now it's far greater you're my brother you're my sister amen we're part of the body of Jesus Christ amen there can be no greater Revelation than that amen and so we just we thank the Lord for that Benjamin were you were you all going to do that or what okay so I don't know they wanted to do a song but as they're uh making ready for that we want to just remember the service this evening at five but in the meantime we're just here to enjoy ourselves in the Lord this is just a wonderful day I you know I tell you I just I I just look forward to just coming to the house of God because every time God he does something special amen and so God has something really special in mind and I I just I believe that with all my heart and we just want to remember as we come and We Gather here this evening just want to say it just a blessing and a privilege to have brother Trevor and his oldest son brother Zion is here with us as well brother Trevor they just have just a wonderful family his uh his Pastor brother Nathan um brother Nathan Bryant and right there out of Jeffersonville Indiana and uh just really really appreciate brother Trevor and I say this before you know we would they'd sing and introduce him I've watched brother Trevor with just the ministering and um just not only the ministering of the word but that really wasn't what struck me because by before I ever heard him preach he preached here in this in this pulpit and I don't generally I don't do that but you got to know where a man stands in his character and with working with a person at uh when we did it byc together and I seen his heart I've seen the balance even in because when he was working and ministering to the young people and and God is really gifted brother Trevor in that way and I appreciate every gift that God has placed in the body you know you've heard me say it here from this pulpit and we were brother Trevor and I were talking about in a fellowship I said look I I told the people and this is just where I stand I'm just like I'm just a general practitioner specialist I'm just a pastor and God has a pastor to stay and to you know take after the cares and look after that but I'm grateful God has specialists a man that can come in and you know just get out of the way and you know it's the same God different different Veil but it's the same God and you know it's one of those things that sometimes we understand we can become common to one another and we battle against that but it's just something precious that here when God will take another vessel and come in and he'll step down on that vessel and you know hey wait a minute this brother doesn't know me but you know what it is all along what's more important is God knows us and I think that's just wonderful you know that God God shows his love and his care you know even in when correction comes our life you know that's the love of God that's God correcting us and his encouragements in our lives and it's just so precious to serve the Lord I I can't think of any other thing that would be any greater privilege than to serve the Lord and and if I can say it like this to serve the Lord with you all amen it's a real privilege and an honor Amen to be pressing this battle and we're going to make it amen we're going to make it amen I I hope we're setting I know we don't have no clicks or Clans and I don't believe in that anyhow but bunny I hope I get to set close to some of y'all in heaven I I hope I hope I get you know to you know to uh be able to set close to you at the marriage supper of the lamb and I'm sure I'll have a hard time sitting down like you will say glory to God that we made it by his grace [Applause] oh Hallelujah you talking about real praise break they'll be real praise break going on because we made it by his grace Lord not what I did but Lord it was your grace Your Grace Lord hallelujah amen so that young people as they wanted to ask to sing this song here [Music] oh where I'm going tell me where I'm going [Music] if you wanna know where I'm going oh where I'm going tell me [Music] step by step by step a word on top of words [Music] ain't no devil gonna stop me I'm Gonna See Jesus face to face [Music] when we sing this by his grace I can take the pain [Music] oh as God gives me I need more grace more grace [Music] Gonna Keep running this race till I see Jesus [Music] without the eyes [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm going to shoot [Music] if anybody asks you do [Music] [Applause] where I'm going away [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah please [Music] [Applause] [Music] she was feeding it [Music] took her to me [Music] she recognized [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh yes [Music] we are good we will love us [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I know tell me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh there's just no way to end that so you just have to just say give them a hand clap of Praise I don't know what else now somehow I'm supposed to preach after all that so but I guess it gets everybody warmed up real nice I tell you what though um brother Samuel I've always said that uh you all know brother Jack Duff I believe you've had him here and I'm sure he sang for you I've always said that in heaven brother Jack Duff is going to be the choir leader but if he ever needs a break he's got a good backup that was good [Music] yeah we were streaming one night I don't remember if we had weather or something like that we weren't able to make it to service so we thought well we'll stream we'll stream brother Samuel and after the preaching he started singing and riffing just a little bit there Zion was like brother Samuel's been holding out on us amen I Love to Worship the Lord so thankful he gives us so many so many Avenues to praising age whether it's in song or indeed or in in word there's poets there's writers there's so many you know God is as brother Brandon says God is in art so we're just so thankful that we can have the best art amen amen I won't keep you standing too long we'll we'll turn in our Bibles to Second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 5. um Zion and I as brother Samuel mentioned Thursday night we're at a technology conference um over there in Sandusky but we came Thursday night after you know hearing about you know I can go into it for the same as like oh they speak this different language it's just like wow yeah but we got here and it's like these this is these are my people here okay I can be with these big bearded technology guys wearing star Star Trek t-shirts but these are my people this is this is where my passion is I had a conference like that everybody's all the vendors are looking for people to come and to hire and things like that and started talking to one woman and she's like oh you do this and this and this oh and I was just like look it's just you don't want me my passion isn't in this that'd be terrible for you my passion is this word amen amen so we're just thankful to be gathered together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm so happy to be with you and have the absolute privilege to stand here and and to minister to you and I'm excited about the day that we have um together um I know I just you know was thinking on the youth service and I had a sermon on my mind that I would have wanted to have brought but just as we begin to seek the mind of the Lord on what I wanted to bring for the or what he would like me to bring for the Youth service I just had Maybe this will kind of be two parts not that the youth that are missing this morning won't be able to catch up this evening but just kind of had a general thought I thought I could use throughout the day so second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 5. not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who have made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life I'd also like to look at John chapter 10. verses 9 and 10. John chapter 10 verses 9 and 10. says I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life that they might have it more abundantly so it's not just life but it's life more abundantly so I would also ask you why did this message come did this message come from a diff for a different purpose than Jesus himself came when the word comes does it come in different purposes no it comes for the same purpose the word that we have came for the same purpose that Jesus himself came and he says I am come that they might have life and they might have it more abundantly one more if you will with me Hebrews chapter 10. verses 19 and 20. so Hebrews chapter 10 verses 19 and 20 having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the Holiness by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh is that me not sure okay we'll just keep going all right let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father to approach you o God father can we say to be even able to approach you is amazing Lord because we ought not Lord but by your blood you came and gave us this New and Living Way Lord and you we now have boldness to enter before the throne of grace because we have a high priest Lord we're so grateful Lord would you as we know you're here with us because you promised it and we've invited you now we've praised you Lord and we've worshiped and thank you Lord that one day we're going up yonder not Lord just to be relieved of the sufferings of this world but to be with you o God for you are that relief Lord you are everything that is good and wonderful and we just praise you father Lord we're as we just approach your word may you bless it Lord may you speak as only you can Lord use this gift oh God as we're blessed by your word and we thank you for these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated so I want to take a title this morning of the embodied word and um so I don't know how this is going to go but let's just look at the word of God together can we do that and just enjoy The Fellowship of the word but brother Brenham says in the message the anointed ones at the end time the word is coming to life now and we looked at this scripture here in second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 6 and maybe if they want to just bring that one back up we'll just have that behind us for a bit but you know that we're able Ministers of the New Testament not of letter but of spirit for the letter killeth and the spirit giveth life and so and we know this and we talk about this and obviously we know you have to have the spirit there but I just like for a moment then I wanna like I want to make things practical as we come down to towards the end of this but but to be to be starting to think about what does it even mean that the letter killeth I mean we we literally are talking about this right yes yeah the most powerful thing ever written down ever and so we shouldn't just like be very well we're in New Testament now don't you know the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life and some people do that and basically it means you know I have the spirit and we don't need this anymore no so what does it mean like can talk about this this what does it mean that the letter even killeth like we just kind of it's like we use that verse to just dismiss it and get into the spirit it's like well that's very dangerous because God gave us the word and so you don't just you don't just throw around well there's kills man don't don't just have this this just kills you as a preacher standing here saying that I don't know that's tough yeah like but yet we get dismissive in that way because we want to say okay well but but okay so so let me ask another question here as we look at this like like how is it that we overcome and we'll look at how Jesus overcame and that's one of the things that we're going to get into but how is it that we overcome he said it but just I would expect everybody knows it's very simple and how is it that we overcome by the word we overcome by the word but the letter killeth in the spirit giveth life so we're Overcoming By the dead letter is that is that what we're like okay brother Trevor you're really confusing us good good that's how I spend most of my sermons is confuse everybody for the first 15 minutes and then and then reconstruct their minds into how it works so um so you were receiving the brother Trevor treatment so so we're gonna overcome by the word but the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so we can't disconnect these two things but yet isn't that what what what the scripture is doing here is the Paul is saying the letter killeth the spirit giveth life but we know that like there has to be a way that he can express such a thing but but it happens at our church too don't worry brother um and there has to be a way we can express such a thing to understand just the knowledge of it just just just sitting there and having like what it says isn't enough that's not the point is that are we together to just know the word is not enough and and we could say that the letter killeth in the sense that the law is the thing that does kill us like that the law is what sends us to jail right but but Jesus Christ comes and when Jesus Christ comes Jesus Christ embodies the word and because Jesus Christ comes and is the very embodiment of the word what that produces is the Salvation and freedom to you what that produces is life and not just life but life more abundantly you see Jesus himself being the embodiment of what we would say what we're saying here the embodiment of dead letter is the thing that brings life is that does that make sense to everybody so so so Jesus then being the first fruits Jesus comes then as the firstborn among many Brethren Jesus comes and embodies the dead letter embodies everything that the word says to us and by getting it all not by being what the word is he brings life and not just life but life more abundantly so you remember then that I just said he was the firstborn among many Brethren and what does that what would that indicate to us that would indicate to us that he was the first one to do what many successive after him would do and so so we can say the letter killeth but the spirit brings life but what we're saying in is that that letter is still necessary but it's not just the necessary you know it's not just the letter that we want to bolt on to our lives but it's that letter that when it becomes such a reality it becomes embodied in us that that produces life and life more abundantly and so that's what we're about in today when I say embodied word is how can we then take not to not just leave the letter on the page but rather have the letter come so deeply inside of us that we become the embodiment of this word the embodiment of this message because because that's what I want to be I I don't know about you but I don't I don't want a dead letter telling me do this do that like look you know brother you know what this message came for it came to make your life a lot harder a lot more miserable right you know there's just so many more laws now that's why the message came is to weed out all those that couldn't do it couldn't hack the real you know that's what it was that that's not the relationship with Jesus Christ that I want all right so so now though we have boldness to enter into the holiest of holies by the blood of Jesus by a new and Living Way you see why was this a new way well because in the Old Testament times we didn't have the Holy Spirit there was they could begin to take the knowledge they could begin to structure their lives and try to serve God by the letter and what the letter told them to do and they could and they could be very good at that even but but but you know even to Daniel as we know he goes into Babylon and he doesn't Mar his testimony even though he's there amongst the pagans and he's doing it without the Holy Ghost so he lives in a in a way that's pleasing to God he lives in a way that's according to the letter but it still wasn't what God was looking for you say you say brother Trevor did Daniel not have what God was looking for that's no but you understand the progression that God is doing through time the plan that he's laying out I'm not saying I'm better than Daniel in any way and trust me I'm not but now I'm at the point where God has brought out the New and Living Way by the blood of Jesus to cleanse us to a place to obliterate sin to make it not a fact as the prophet told us that you know that the sin question was settled at Calvary so the sin question is over when the blood is applied that red blood the Red Sin you it's white and so you're there a spotless bride because because of Calvary and so because of that to accept him is to to to be born again and to receive his holy spirit and that's that thing that's quickening what we're saying this dead letter is right but that's a very important thing to think about is how that actually happens because it's not happening by you being good at serving God it's not happening by you being as good as Daniel and that's what many of us strive to do and you say but brother Trevor are you telling me you know you just stop trying no I'm not not telling you to stop trying but I'm telling you where to recognize where the source of the strength is coming from where the source of the word and what the word is trying to produce trying to understand that the word isn't it's that the word by the spirit when it's spoken it brings life right when we leave it on the page it's like okay I must do this I must do this I must do this like that's not that's not doing anything for us but we should still recognize that when God spoke and said let there be light there was so that word has power when quickened by the spirit and when when brought in by faith so when we when when you know when message Believers and message preachers begin to tell you you are the Bride of Jesus Christ there should be faith in that to take that and to recognize that we are living in a day where God is looking for a bride he's coming for and she will be manifested there will be someone here that is going to be that Rebecca to come to Isaac and by faith we begin to recognize that's who we ought to be amen amen but the problem is is that many times we try to make ourselves Rebecca by bolting the word unto us externally by doing the works by getting into the thing and doing the message stuff and coming to brother Samuel's Church sitting on the pew all right but is that how it happens no no is that how it happens let's look at a few quotes together as I said in anointed ones brother Branham is saying the word is coming to life now this is why the message is coming as Jesus came to bring life and that more abundantly so the message is coming to bring life and that life more abundantly that word is coming to life now we are in the age and time where that word is ready to become life where it's been planted through the church ages it it died and rotted and and but but but there in in the in the sixth or fifth Church age it becomes to bring that stalk out and bring the tussle out and bring in bring the shock out and then the shock has now pulled away and the word itself is now sitting in the presence of the Sun and ripening what went down is one seed has now multiplied Hallelujah so so we're living in the days that I am one of the multiplied seed that went down yes amen and so so it's coming to life now and that's what I want I want to be in and part of that life so brother Brenham says in 1954 why I'm praying for the sick he says not just teach the word but preach make manifest the word the word has to be made alive it's dead letter Until It's Made manifest and then it's quickened and it's brought to pass what God said about it that's the gospel in action the New Testament Christianity in 1963 what a difference he's greater than Solomon he's he's contrasting idolatry and paganism with Christianity he says what a difference it is to Christianity though we prostrate ourselves before a supernatural God that's not an idol because what he taught us in Christianity versus idolatry is that the Pagan would come and prostrate themselves before the idol and they believed that that God would come down into that Idol and speak with them so he's saying we're not doing that we're prostrating not before an idol but before and before a living God a supernatural God and then we are filled with him and become his Idol now does that mean people should start no that doesn't mean people should fall down and worship you as an idol that would still be paganism okay but what he means is is that we become that representation in in that context that he's talking about that Idol is being the representation of what God is coming into now we are that representation of what that Supernatural God is coming into and that's why we should have respects for one another as as recognizing that that we are the temples that God is coming into amen amen so so a living his living image of him working walking on the earth as a living representation of God that we serve God in a human being so today you go home you go to the bathroom wherever you're gonna you see you look in a mirror I want you to think God and a human being come on somebody because that's what we're talking about it's not looking in the mirror and going oh God I failed you so bad so many times I'm such I'm such worthless flesh I I really have nothing you know look yes nothing in my arms like I bring simply to thy cross I claim yes absolutely but then but then that new birth comes and that Supernatural God comes into you and you become the bearer of His Image you you are the representation of him to this world and those around you and how is it that I can say to you you know look I'm just a representation to everyone at Chick-fil-A and wherever you know at the schools and wherever I'm just the representation of Christ walking around but then I look in the mirror and I'm kind of like yeah you're just such a loser preach now well it can be God's image to everybody else but me why well how are you going to have the faith to recognize that if I can't see God in myself not because of me but because the word is becoming alive in me because God is doing what he said he would do [Applause] so look in the mirror today and say God in a human being and let your faith rise and throw off the doubts that the devil would try to put on you and say you're not good enough and you can't do it because it's not about the dead letter all right come on it's about the life that he's putting in you and growing in you and that that that life should be feeding on the word of God and strengthening and that and and it should be changing this flesh from the inside out it's contrary to paganism they fall before a Mary or a Joseph or some Saint something other like that that's been dead for years but you see the Holy Spirit comes into the living being not into a dead Idol you're not a dead Idol it's a living being that God himself is coming into but into the living being and works through that living being not through an idol ye are temples of God so one of my favorite quotes here 1954 the word became flesh flesh India trip report he says you can express it by a mental conception now many of us have that we we try to express this message through message mental conception we try to do what the we're supposed to be doing we're taught and we're trying to do it externally and that's fine that's you should do that but recognizing that that sanctification process is is Paving way for God to come and make the actual change amen so you see it before it happened if it becomes a revelation real revelation of God and express it in word form and that word takes hold and becomes material a thought expressed see if your heart and mind is so filled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being now how many of us uh can say that's that's exactly that's exactly a picture of my life what brother I'm talking about is that my mind and my leading and my guiding becomes a direct place or direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit uh I mean I mean yes does he want us to say it in faith or is he what I want to show you today is I believe I I believe that we're better at that than we'd give ourselves credit for amen and it's because the word is changing you you see we try to separate those two things it's there's me and then there's the word and what I'm trying to to bring out today is to say that that word is becoming embodied in you and your thoughts but by the quickening of the spirit are becoming his thoughts that that that you're not doing it right if that's not like like well look we so we we want this to like we think about like I read that and go like my thoughts becoming direct leading and in filling of his you know like just like his thoughts and it's just like wow that's got to be amazing it's like I shut my own mind off and it's his mind and that's one way of thinking about it and that's kind of what's happening but it but but but think about what we're saying is it's like actually I'm just you know I'm just a dumb terminal here that God is using sorry techie speak there you know like I'm just you know I'm just I'm just a puppet now and God is now it my mind is gone God's mind is now here it's supernatural and I just get to sit back and go wow this is so amazing look at God use me whoa like that's what we think about it when God is my you know my mind is so infilled with Gods that's just him like it's just and I can stand back and go wow that was totally God but what I'm saying is when the word becomes embodied you become changed and molded like him and your thoughts become so like his that that the holy spirit is reporting back and saying look at this son just like a chip off the old block he's just like you what does that mean that when I think about a situation it's like God is thinking about a situation that as I grow in him he's building me and strengthening me and I'm becoming and changing being changed like him from glory to glory he's changing me changing me changing me well how has he changed you well I don't know I'm just waiting for him to just supernaturally do stuff oh my God you can't sing that song that he's changing me and then expect everything that he's going to do through this worthless bag of flesh is going to be totally Supernatural no but what he's doing is he's fusing the supernatural into the natural you know this is because isn't why are we becoming like Christ and there's a quote brother Adam talks about you know the disciples were confused sometimes because they couldn't tell if it was the man or The God speaking which one was speaking Jesus the man or Jesus God we but it because it was so fused together yes sir it's not that Jesus wasn't a man all right right but that man fully embodied God and he was sinless well by his sinful sinless sacrifice I now stand redeemed before his presence he sees me as he sees his own son amen so is it too presumptuous to think then that as that word comes into my life and is quickened by the holy spirit that I that people might be confused like Trevor was that you or God speaking all right come on yes sir yes sir and it's not like well no of course I know it was God because did you hear that wind come through and come into me and I shook all over like brother Samuel brother it's download right there was there a still small voice that was indiscernible that something happened that was Supernatural but it seemed so natural this is the embodiment of the word of God Amen that should be happening to you and changing you what kind of people he says should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has you so built amen until your thoughts your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church would we be and again I just want to say like I I don't believe that this is some Supernatural like always this rushing wind coming through but God is building you he has you so built what is the process if it's supernatural always that your mind is like well I'm thinking his thoughts because there's always the supernatural thing happening to me then how is that building you what is being built but God wants to mold you into His Image he wants to take your thoughts and teach you and and Quicken you and you you sir as you surrender to him as you you consecrate yourself for him and say God here is a being that you can use here is someone yeah God that you can build oh what kind of people would we be this morning if this Branham Tabernacle was so filled with the presence of God and you didn't use your own mind or thoughts and didn't have no alternative of your own but just be led the message desperations he says it's it's not just a preacher it's not a certain congregation it's the Holy Spirit showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ now it's embodied in the body of his bride it should throw us into desperation amen so what is he saying he was it did when it was when it was embodied in Jesus Christ now embodied in his bride so we should begin to understand that that if we're calling ourselves Christians well they called themselves Christians they called them Christians because they were christ-like what was it they were Christ like well they helped little old ladies across the street because as we all know that's what Jesus did because he was so caring he helped little old ladies across the street and they showed Christian works ah I think it was more than that right like it was more than just kindness it was more than just but but but his body like he he exhibited peace he exhibited Holiness he he embodied these things you you came around him and you knew something was different that that this man was held and carried himself by a different way by a different wisdom by a different by by a different character of being amen so this is what this is what we're talking about when we when we talk about being embodied what it what it means is is that we're taking the truth and the meaning the the word itself and it's becoming produced so so because here and I don't want to get too thinky or too philosophical here but but so well let's just we'll put it in we'll put it in Pixar terms I know no one watches Pixar movies here in this church or anything like that but you know you've probably heard at least of the this little movie they did called inside out where there was these these five little guys be people inside of this little girl's head and one of them was named Joy and so I just you know maybe if you haven't even seen the movie that's fine that's that's that's great you know I'm not here promoting watching movies or not watching movies or just I'm just here promoting the embodiment of the word of God so I just want to bring this concept out though and you know kind of normal vernacular so so what these five characters in this young girl's head are and they're they're watching through her eyes they're up in her brain and they're watching through her eyes and one of them is called Joy why do you think this character's name was Joy she was the one who exhibited the emotion joy and then there was a you know red rather Square guy who's whose name was anger I'll ask the same question why do you think his name was anger and then there were three others that I don't remember their names I only saw it once um but I can tell you that they they had an emotion names right so what we're doing here is we're telling a story of a young lady but what we're doing is embodying emotions inside her head and the story is portrayed in this way because if you just say well joy but joy is of course for the salmon don't you don't you how are you going to describe Joy well someone who's joyful is usually smiling okay somebody who's joyful like you know they carry themselves and joyful right so so what am I doing right now before you as I describe the concept of Joy I have to for before we can conceptualize what it is we embody that to describe that so here I am like I joyful like so so in this movie Anger is is um he's he's he's colored red well why is he why is he a red color Well because most of us when we get angry our faces get a little flush looking and we get red so what are we doing we're describing the emotion by embodying it and turning it red and he's got little Flames coming out of his his head so my daughter was she wanted she likes me to draw with her sometimes and then I don't do it near enough um but but we're drawing one day and it was not too long after we had seen this yeah I watched it okay so we had seen this movie and so we're she's drawing joy and so I won't draw anger so and I'm not really that great of a drawer but I'm you know I'm illustrator drawer whatever the word is you know um and so I'm drawing it and I color him red and he's got his little flames you know and then I put a little thing under there and I said and it says do you want some tea because like I'm just like but tea is like in all caps it's like do you want some tea you know it's like so I was like because anger you know he can't you know he that's how he communicates he communicates in an angry way it's like but again what have I just done now I'm I'm in a simple statement do you want some tea I'm now embodying anger to communicate the the emotion or the expression of what anger is by saying do you want some tea it's like do you have to ask so angry yeah because I'm angry why are you angry I just am so what am I doing like I can I can embody anger and embodying anger we can begin to understand it and so and so this is what a lot of the ancient writers you know the Greek playwrights and all of these you know way back in time what they they would do is they would take these gods and they would give them names that meant the thing that they were and and what that was to do was so that they could play with embodying the emotion so that they could write this play or write this story so that people could sit there and go oh that's why I do that kind of thing or I understand why he would make those decisions because now I can now I can play with the understanding of what that emotion is or what that thing is I hope I didn't just get too thinky on you we all together now we're beginning to understand so as so so then so then if we take concepts of emotions and we could say well you can embody it as joy and you can embody it as anger what we're talking about though is embodying the word of God we're talking so what is the word of God well Jesus was the word of God Express right and brother Branham then would teach us that he said I used to think that God was angry with me but that Jesus loved me but then I found out that Jesus was the very Heart Of God Amen so the very Heart Of God was expressed and embodied to us when he created a body for him to come and live inside of now I want to call your attention back to what I said earlier in this sermon now twice that he was the firstborn among many brother and who's that many so if Jesus is the heart of God Express becoming embodied and they call people who came after him Christians why did they call them Christians because they were embodying the same the same characters not just doing not just helping little old ladies across the street like Jesus did and not just healing people like Jesus did it wasn't just the works but it was the embodiment and the expression of the character of The Heart Of God coming into the person hmm and that's what I want to be because this world needs not just dead letter they don't just need us expressing it by having great healing lives they don't need it just expressed by you know having visions that come to pass and predicting the future all of these kinds of things that Jesus Christ himself can and did do and that he's doing today in the body but it's not merely that but those things are coming because they're the expression of the heart of God and that's what this world needs today brother Branham says this world is dying for love the church is dying because of lack of love so what we need then is that word not just the things that it produces and the hair and the dresses and the no shorts and no drinking and stop your dirty jokes and quit this and quit that and but this word then if Jesus says I am come that you could have life and that you might have life more abundantly that's what this message has come to do to give you life and that life more abundantly but not to just like okay so now I'm a message believer no but what is that word coming that word is coming to be embodied in his bride that they could be the expression not merely of his works but those works are the expression of the character that's become embodied in The Believer so where Jesus Christ is joy all right your life is expressing Joy amen where Jesus Christ is angry with sin your life is expressing anger at sin you understand the metaphor here I'm connecting these things together right so so we become the embodiment not just of what the word is saying to us to do but the understanding underneath what it's saying so Jesus comes and preaches on on The Sermon on the Mount and they begin to understand it's not just killing your brother that's wrong but the character underneath that you see what the the law was the expression of the character that God was trying to portray to the people so then and when Jesus comes and he embodies that word he's telling you you're missing it it's not just about not killing right it's not just about not cutting your hair right it's not just about not smoking it's not just about not not not not not this not that this isn't a message of knots that's true maybe we think that so often like I can do this I can't and it's not a message I can't it's a message of the the Heart of Jesus Christ expressed that you could have life and that you might have it more abundantly now you might think you have better ideas on what Abundant Life looks like but I tell you that's where you're confused and that's where many have gone before and said yeah I didn't think it was this way either I didn't and I went this way and I went that way and now every single one of them that everyone did right right and they're every one of them locking they don't have that thing that lasts because they don't have the audience of it these sports players they go out and they look to win trophies and they strive and they train I gotta win a trophy and then they win the trophy and what do they have the next day a trophy but what's in here yes sir where is that that's right is that fulfillment there and they get depressed because you know you know they spent a whole tournament that took two weeks or a month or whatever aiming for something expecting something going after something there was so much in their heart but then when they achieved it it was like okay but all of that's gone it's like you know it's like oh goodness I don't know where people stand on Christmas but you know again common vernacular here you know it's like after you finish opening presents on Christmas morning yeah yeah yeah the expectation is gone I have the stuff but the expectation's gone and I just it's not as 8 A.M at Christmas morning is way better than 2 p.m I'm telling you when the when the presents are still wrapped man it's exciting after the presents are unwrapped it's like well now I know you got an Apple Watch man yeah it's right here it's nice isn't it I don't actually have one um what do you have on Apple watch on my wrist but do you have the expectation do you do you have some excitement is there some like is it per has it no it hasn't produced anything but that's what this word is coming to do this word is is the expression of the heart of God that is Holiness that is love that is peace that is joy that is patience all that is good all that is wonderful is expressed through this word and and and the desire of God is that the character of that word be embodied in you building you not just giving you life but that life more abundantly Oh Glory to God well we're on page two and I just started had brother Brian it's Brian right we had brother Brian helping me print out notes and it just stayed Pages just kept coming you know after page four or five he was like I was like don't worry brother I may not use all of them the last one though was blank just so you know brother Brian there's actually only seven pages of I'm about to flip to three to God nobody's nervous now oh so I just want to break this down what time we got is that 12 30 is that is that right oh my God Church started at 11. Oh Glory so they had a long song before I got up it was probably 11 45. so I haven't even been it's 45 minutes but the brand since I should probably stop okay but I have to bring some application here Jesus Christ when he overcomes the devil in the wilderness how does he do that by the word by the word right that's that's what we're taught we're taught the devil is tempting you because of this story we know this and we're taught this like the devil is tempting you you give him the word how's that worked out for you some people laugh because they're like wait a second this preacher just talks funny we don't quite understand like he's like how's that worked out for you like as if we're expecting what we're taught isn't actually working well it should work if we're doing it if we're actually embodying the word but if the dead letter is what we're throwing at the Devil well as a little it's like so you're sitting there Temptation in the computer screen there in front of you young men are tempted with these things young women these days are tempted with these things How Far We've Fallen receiving this temptation I know what we do we use the word devil the scripture says flee you the lusts ha got him how'd that work the Temptation gone did he flee did he you used the word you you threw a scripture at him and say hi devil I got you because and it's almost like we begin to use like and is it but isn't and as we look at the story and we'll turn to Matthew chapter four but as we look at the story The Devil's throwing scripture back at Jesus that's good it's like all right devil my Matthew 6 33 trumps your you know trumps your numbers 4-1 what you've got now oh man he's coming at me with a John three but he doesn't know I'm coming at him with a second Peter it's funny because it's true like that in our in our in our minds like we heard like well you you you you you overcome by the word like oh how else are you supposed to do it brother Trevor like I know the scriptures have been taught him in Sunday school I've memorized stuff and didn't I memorize them just to make me feel good and to battle the devil with or or was it that we're not actually we're not actually hoping that you just memorized the word but that the part of memorizing you see brother random tells us the mind is is the mind is is what the board comes into and then the spirit catches that word and brings it down into the soul right and so we're trying to equip your mind so that the spirit so that so that the embodiment of the word as a continual process is happening so as you begin to meditate on the word as you begin to because we've met Nobody Does that anymore I know but you know because you know there's infinite scroll you know even on your Bible app you just scroll infinitely and we don't need to meditate we can read more man you can get it done in a year we probably don't do that much either but my goodness we got a do this we take the word in we listen to the tapes we read the scripture we pray and say God I want these things that you're saying the truths that are coming through this word should then become reality to me and then fuse themselves into me in such a way that these that the devil see see when the devil's tempting Jesus Christ do you like how do you think that went for Jesus is this like you know it's like you're hung it's been 40 days you're hungry how's that going to go for you you go for a 40-day fast and the Devil comes to you and says turn this rock into bread what are you doing you're right I can turn rocks in the bread I'm so hungry I'm like that's the temp that's Temptation man like I'm hungry but Jesus like just turns around it's like do we really think that Jesus was like oh man hmm yeah that rock right there is starting to look good and the devil's like yeah that's bread Jesus oh no I just I I just can't I just um you know because this is this is us right like okay like that's Temptation I gotta figure this out man I guess kind of trying to run away from it but it's it's calling me do we think that that's what was going on with Jesus as he's tempted by the devil in the wilderness I mean was he sitting there going oh yeah you're right I got to think about this now no he he was being tempted but he he was immune why was he immune [Applause] because he was the embodiment of the word how was he using the word by the word being embodied in him so he could quote the word to him he also quoted word with the proper understanding of what that word meant but because he could he knew the word he understood what it meant he also then that meaning became fused inside of him to where he it was obvious to him it's like that's not the right thing it's not even a temptate you're tempting me but it's really not working because I have no desire for the thing that you're asking me to do you think it should be obvious that a man after 40 days would want to turn a rock into bread but to me that obvious thing is not obvious anymore because I've embodied the word and the understanding and the character and the meaning of it are so infused that it's really not a Temptation though you might think it is okay so so amen so Jesus then as he's overcoming brother Branham says he constantly applied the word and he said in each of these he said he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word by the word only in each of these three major trials that have corresponded exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life that's out of First John 2 16. he says Jesus overcame by the word Eve fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because the word can't fail amen he says then there was not a time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of God so so now let's turn to Matthew chapter four if you will with me and we can start at verse three and I just want to analyze this story because I want I want to really break this down and try to make this very practical when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Okay so the Devil comes and tempts him and Jesus gives him the word now I want to ask you just for a moment like when the Devil comes and tempts you what is what word is like where in the Bible would be maybe your go-to places to combat The Temptations of the devil in your life anybody what's that okay do you know where that's found somewhere in the New Testament I don't know either Paul's writings James James's writings where else do you go anybody just okay where's that Paul somewhere yes good job Timothy that's where that is encyclopedia says my pastor's the same way like they're like where's that pound Trevor it's like well it's on you know it's in Matthew somewhere it's on the right side of the page three quarters of the way down to the column underlined in blue you know and it's brother Nathan's like that's this scripture oh yeah I can find it I can't tell you where it is I know where it is but I can't tell you where it is because you don't have my Bible anyway what else Psalms probably is a good one there's a lot of stuff you know it's like break the arm of the evil man that's in Psalms maybe don't use that one I don't know um we use so we use different scriptures a lot of us would are going to use we're going to use Psalms we're going to use the New Testament in places when Jesus is battling the devil but Jesus is battling the devil here in Matthew 4. he uses Deuteronomy do you ever think about Deuteronomy as the this yes that's that's your go-to place for battling the devil is the book of Deuteronomy um actually kind of boring isn't it like you're reading through it it's like oh my goodness rehashing everything we just read in the last four books I hope I'm not too human for you maybe I'm the only one that thinks those irreverent thoughts so Jesus uses Deuteronomy chapter 8 and verse 3. what does Deuteronomy chapter 8 and verse 3 says I'll quote it to you so you don't have to turn he humbled thee suffered Thee the hunger fed thee with Manna which thou knew is not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee no that man doth not live by bread only but every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth Man live this is the scripture that Jesus is going to as he's battling the devil is the devil saying hey why don't you turn this rock into in into bread so what is it's like well why okay those are the words but what's the meaning underneath those words well well we're we're talking about what was going on with the children of Israel that there there they were in the wilderness and they're hungry and and and and and God can't you God we're so hungry you brought us out of Egypt can't you feed us we have a problem you you know can you feed us and and so what did God do well he fed them let me ask you a question can can God solve world hunger fed five thousand people with Five Loaves and two fishes yeah five lows and two pictures except for on the next time it was like seven and three I think something like that anyway um encyclopedias anyway we'll move on so God can solve world hungers just like that right he can feed the children of Israel for 40 years with Manna in the wilderness he can he can feed them with quails so much that you know well he's going to kill them while they're eating it and they'll you know just wow like be careful when you ask God to feed you that's all I'm saying he may actually do it that's maybe you go through and Deuteronomy and read that story if you're confused but so but if God solves world hunger what has he done well brother Trevor he's fed a lot of people he's staved off a lot of suffering that's in the world he's it's uh it's just a nicer place to live now because everybody has food and that's that's nice Okay God has solve world hunger and nobody's hungry has anyone changed is anyone better has the character of the people changed well but brother Trevor you're all you're you're enabling the people better you know to uh rise up above their poverty and be and and and if they weren't faithful in the little things that God gave them how are they going to be faithful and much so yes God can solve world hunger but but Jesus himself knows that the knows the idea is is that it's not about whether I'm hungry or not and whether or not God can make bread or not because he can that is established that is fact and we don't we don't need to we don't need to even go into that we don't need to have this conversation devil about whether or not that rock can be turned to bread and whether or not I can be the idea is is that if I need the bread God is always faithful that God is there and following him and knowing his word and becoming his word is vastly and more important for for myself and for this entire world than that rock becoming bread and so devil you're bothering me with a trifle because I'm concerned about the word I'm concerned about the word being expressed through my life and so if you're just asking me well aren't you hungry and no you know sure it's hey man it's easy for someone who's over 250 pounds to preach about that I get that but that doesn't that doesn't negate the truth that's right and that's what so so so Jesus is embodying the is embodying Deuteronomy so fully that this temptation the devil is bringing him is meaningless to him he says devil like are you that stupid like Devil like God can turn like God can handle hunger it's not a problem the more important thing is is that I'm here to get myself out of the way this flesh out of the way that it can display the glory of God for three and a half years we continue on Matthew Chapter 4 verses 6 and 7 then and this uh or five the devil taketh him up into the holy city and set Upon A Pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning me and in their hands they shall bear thee uplust at any time Thou shalt Dash thy foot against the stone and Jesus said unto him it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God okay so what does he say well where's he getting this out of Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God well that's Deuteronomy 6 16 ye shall not tempt the Lord your God as he tempted him in Masa all right so Jesus just extracts this random scripture Through the Bible and throws it at the Devil no it's more than that what he's saying is the devil you have no power here because I understand what happened in the in the in the wilderness see what happened was is that God had fed them God had given them water and then they get to the next place and they have no water and they're like is God even with us I mean we can't even tell because we're so thirsty and that had to be very terrible like I don't want to put myself really in their shoes and have to experience that and I you know and I'm like Jesus make sure Lord change me because I hope if I was in that scenario I'd be just like not complaining because I was really really thirsty [Laughter] thirsty just thinking about it okay so here so here the point is is that Jesus is saying they they the understanding of Deuteronomy 6 is they tempted him in the wilderness they they didn't believe him they see they had seen that he had done things for them they knew that God was a deliverer they knew that God could bring water they knew that God could bring food but yet when they came to an hour of need they said okay we got to prove if God's even real here because we're not sure I was like you're tempting God God oh God can you really do this because we're thirsty and if you could really do this maybe we wouldn't be and that's what the devil is saying it's like well go ahead throw yourself off this mountain and see if just see no not tempting the Lord I know he's real so I don't have to I don't have to play your games devil and sometimes that's what the devil wants to do he wants to throw these thoughts in your mind and say look is this really like if God was real like don't you think it's like as if as if 6 000 years of History isn't enough already that we haven't proved him yet like like it's going to come that's right here right now we're going to prove of God's actually real or not come on don't tempt the Lord your God and Jesus is like I'm not playing your game man why because he was embodying the word he understood the word it wasn't a it wasn't it wasn't just it wasn't just a trivial mind word game that was going on but it was it was desires but the devil is trying to attack and Jesus is embodying the correct characters and the correct desires so this attack isn't even doing anything amen so okay so Deuteronomy 6 13 to 14 let's try to hurry through this is that right well we'll keep just reading a little bit more so that I don't skip anything the devil taketh him up into a high mountain and show with him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them verse 9 and he saith unto them all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me then Jesus saith unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt not Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve and the devil leaving leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered unto him oh 13 and 14 is what what he used in Deuteronomy chapter six so do so what he uses there to tell the devil is Deuteronomy 6 13 and 14 Thou shalt fear the lord thy God and serve him shalt swear by his name ye shall not go after other gods the gods of the people which are round about you for the Lord thy God is a jealous God among you lest the anger of the Lord be kindled again and Destroy thee from off the face of the Earth you see what the devil is offering Jesus is he's offering it like he's offering Jesus everything that Jesus was going to get anyway and you think well that would be like why would you do that like Jesus already knows he's going to get all of these things and the devil's like hey I can give you all of these things and you'd think Jesus would just say I'm going to get that anyway so why do I why would I make a deal with you but the reality is the devil was offering it to him before I don't know Calvary before whips before beard being plucked out before being smitten with reeds before being bruised and broken and smitten before my God my God why is Thou forsaken me all of those things the devil is offering him all of this without the growth of character all ah Jesus said Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only Jesus is saying I'm not worshiping My Flesh to make the glory that I know I truly deserve come about if it's just about my flesh and church if we can really Empower my if we can embody this concept right here to understand that that it's it's I am created to worship him and him alone devil I'm not going to worship myself because I can give myself Glory I can become a tick tock Superstar and have millions of followers and millions of of you know dollars and sponsorships and all of these things and you know and and and and I I guess there's a a gymnast now that's also a Tick-Tock person and she's got like six or seven million followers and she's had to tell people like hey stop you know like crowding everything and making it all about me I'm at a gymnast competition there's other people here too and and it's like wow but wouldn't you want to be that person that like you're filling stadiums just because you're there and walking in and people just want to take a selfie with you because you deserve that Glory isn't that right Zach come here bro I mean look at this look at this young man look at this young man right here turn around turn around everybody's got seeds camera get it on here get it on this bowtie class right here there's an absolute class going on right here it's wearing a bow tie to church anybody else nobody else wearing a bow tie this morning just Zach and we could you know it's got a nice smile I bet just I'm just guessing if you just regularly had these posts on Tick Tock where you're smiling and you're saying something kind of funny that in three or four years you've got a million followers bro there's a business idea you might consider it I have to confess I literally told the brother that I thought that maybe he could do that you know just yesterday anyway like because why well Zach I mean aren't you a great guy yeah right just be honest it's Church bro like it's okay don't you feel that one day you're gonna reign as a king but you are because the word says it because after all you're son of a king man you're told you are totally worthy of reigning one day am I just talking to Zach am I just talking to Zach totally worthy one day to reign as a king and a priest look in the mirror God and a human being King Queen bam but what the devil is trying to offer and especially try to offer to you young people is that you deserve that now you're worthy now why don't you get that now and if you recognize the devil I am not yet the full embodiment of the word and what you're trying to promise me is glory and all of these things but but without the fulfilling part trying to offer me these things you're trying to offer me to Trophies that's going to sit on my wall you're trying to offer me likes and shares and follows and when you walk in the young ladies are like laughs because after all wouldn't that I mean let's be honest wouldn't that be pretty cool never it never happened for me you know like stop embarrassing you thank you but isn't that what the devil's offering you can have it now this thing that you you're worthy of it and it's like well actually yeah that's true by his grace but God wants to bring me through something to mold the characters in me because character without a victory when it was I totally just is satanic did I say it right power without character satanic characters of Victory not a gift I was murdered those two thank you you're all with me though you've read the church age book everybody knows what I was saying that's well taught church thank you Pastor okay but this is the idea is that God wants to like this is this is the heart of what we're talking about is that God wants you to embody that word God wants you to become his very character and not only is that a journey like not yes is that a hard thing is that a hard journey is that are there difficult things that you're going to have to go through before you come to the glory which shall be revealed in us as the scripture says if you were worried about whether you were worthy of the glory or not because one day there will be glory revealed in you what Glory will that be that will be his glory revealed through the embodiment of the word in your life in your flesh so will that be it can will that will there be some difficult times in that Journey yes necessarily there must be difficult times to get rid of the things within you that are going to keep you from truly being the king and queen and priest and Glory revealer that you ought to be and will be but these other things inside of you that he's trying to get out of you that his him that his characters can truly live through you and inside of you are the things you don't really want but those are the things the devil is trying to Quicken and say look but you should have it now so just worship me just worship yourself worship your phone worship your sports worship your car worship your children worship your wife worship your husband worship whatever it is but Jesus says no devil Thou shalt worship Him and him alone so I'm not worshiping myself I'm not bringing to pass what will be manifested in me without the process that God because to do so would be cheap and and lessen that thing on that final day and I don't want that I don't want to come to that final day with with half the character I ought to have praise God I'm gonna have half the peace that I ought to have through the millennium I'm going to have half the joy that I ought to have through the Millennium I'm gonna have you know half the ability to make good decisions in the Millennium like no I don't I like no said no one ever [Applause] but that's the reality of what we choose when we choose to just go after our own fleshly things and ignore ignore the process of character growth to achieve those same things that we truly want for ourselves but Jesus says I am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly so the greatest thing that you could ever be if you didn't have it with with if you had it without Jesus you you do you are you living yeah I have life I mean I I guess I do but you're missing that essential element that brings out that Abundant Life that makes it amazing that makes it wonderful God did not come Jesus did not come to make you miserable now so that you could be and have an amazing life in the Millennium it's not like we're choosing like well if I have misery now I can I can reign as a king of priest later the message didn't come to make you miserable now to put you under bondage now so that you could prove how good of a Believer you were bless God and we're good at it I know the quotes and I got the doctrines down and I man there's no TV in my house no Christmas tree in my house no Christmas presents like that preacher obviously up there has like none of that happens in my house Pixar movies and all this garbage like we ain't doing none of that God we got the message maybe you know that person maybe you are that person is that the point is that truly Abundant Life coming out because we know we struggle with that we have these things and we we recognize those things we see those patterns and it is it is Noble out of our own desire to to try to achieve and to to make ourselves what we know we ought to be but at the end of the day what it's about is embodying the word it's not about bolting these things onto us and using these things as message armor and different things and bless God I'm you know I you know gonna fight and the devil and the Got The Sword and the shield of faith and quote the thing for us now like somewhere maybe I'm just teasing but the full armor of God and we we think the message is my full armor of God and I'm going to put it on my outside and I'm going to fight off the devil for every day of my life and it'll be a struggle but it'll be worth it in the Millennium when I have when I achieved him yeah wow man wow grace of God is just all through that God God wants to give you he came to give you life and that life more abundantly and he came to do that now not later but now as you take that word into your heart and that word and it becomes to be the embodiment of that that word is everything that's wonderful that word is everything that's amazing everything that's awesome everything that's righteous and holy and good and peace is becoming embodied in your flesh and do you think that's a miserable life somehow no it only is if we choose not to embody the word not to let the word become manifested in our lives not just to say God I want this I want this thing that brother Trevor is talking about I want this to live in me and brother Branham talks about stature of a perfect man would be a great message for you to listen to if you wanted to just like this topic is amazing I want to look into it more the statue of a perfect man he begins to talk about the vulcanization of of in a rubber plant where where where the Rubber and the two become one and that's what God is wanting to do with the word is that you and the word are becoming vulcanized together that you're becoming one that there's no separation that that you're becoming Jesus amen that you're becoming a Christian like Christ the first morning among many Brethren I'm one of them maybe I'm not the second maybe I'm not the fifth maybe I'm not the 250 second but I am one of them and so then as the devil is tempting in me in my life and as I'm a young Christian I I fall and I fail but as I grow and as I mature as the word becomes embodied and becomes vulcanized in my life I begin to man I have way more success at the devil's coming at me with these things and that and they're just bouncing off because it's like that's not even interesting to me um and then I begin to recognize what God is doing in my life not only am I am I being more successful in in warding off the attacks of the devil but I'm also recognizing like it's not even a stretch for me to look in the mirror some days and go God in a human being because he did something through my life and that's what God is I I want to close but give me just a second here but that's what God is wanting to do is to do something in your life to to to to to to to make you what he would be if he were you [Music] it was good young man God created you what's your name Aaron yes okay I thought maybe it was Eric or Aaron I said okay Aaron God created you like you God didn't create you like Paul didn't create you like men God created you like Aaron yes sir do you think he made any mistakes I don't think so I don't either so God created Aaron exactly the way he intended Aaron to be God isn't asking Aaron to stop being Aaron you are and become [Applause] sometimes it's like oh I've just got to be a clean slate no God created the Slate that he wanted you to be anyway but he wanted what he created Aaron to be oh Jesus I can't even say it right like like he wanted Aaron to be Aaron the way Jesus Christ would be Aaron [Applause] so Aaron like the things that you're good at the talents that God has given you I don't know what they are what do you have anything comes off the top of your head he's athletic and God's going to use that someday I don't know maybe he's going to run messages places or something look I just you know I don't know what God is going to do with the qualities that he created in Aaron right now but God isn't going to change those qualities and and I'm assuming you're his parents grandparents okay maybe you well you were sitting right next to you I'm not complicating okay but you're welcome but maybe you would look at your grandson and say God oh he is he's so stubborn like maybe if you were gonna clean some slate you could clean that stubbornness out of him and God is like no I'm gonna use that stubbornness I'm gonna make him stubborn for Jesus all right so so so Aaron's gonna run to somebody because he's athletic and he's going to start telling them about Jesus and they're gonna be like and and Aaron's like hack You Haven't Seen the Last of Aaron [Applause] amen because as God God put qualities there God put things that he has that you yourself Aaron you're gonna have to surrender some of those things to the will and and character of God and that won't be an e process it may not even be a fun process but it will be a worthwhile process and you'll find that the way God created you that you're uniquely called uniquely qualified uniquely gifted to do exactly what God wants to do through your life in your area to the people that you see and that you know and that follow you on tick tock it's maybe a stretch I don't know I hope you don't have Tick Tock actually but because that's the embodiment of the word not only does it become your protection not that I have to quote the word and battle with the Devil by you know like I said you know my Corinthians 3 is better than your Joshua too like no that's not the battle that we're facing but what we're looking for is God let your characters that the character that this letter that we say is dead but once it the character and meaning of this as this is the heart of God expressed comes into my life and the spirit vulcanizes that and makes me that thing because I'm reading it I'm studying it I'm dwelling in it I'm meditating on it and God as I'm doing this process is melting away the other things and while the heat is there melting away the problems the word of God is fusing itself into the same tube that is Aaron's life that is your life and you're becoming the word of God [Applause] it's a New and Living Way it's a New and Living Way that Jesus came those through the Old Testament all those Believers all those Pharisees in Jesus's day they were trying to bolt the word of God onto them know the word of God and do the word of God in their own strengths and their own trying and that is not what the word of God came to do that that is not what Jesus came for that is not what this message came for but but but it has come to give us life and that life more abundantly amen and so so this is the embodiment that we are to be the the expressors of this word in in our own peculiarities and our own gifts and our own talents and our own things that we got to yield to God brother Brenham says in the message anointed ones at the end time musicians you can come the son of man is Christ he is the one you're feeding on you are what you eat he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word the unfailing embodied word because he came and embodied the word so that you could see these Concepts that we had from the beginning of time that were in the mind of God that then he expressed in letter then Jesus Christ comes and embodies that so that we can understand what Joy is we can understand what Jesus Christ is you you see what I'm saying is that embodiment comes and now we understand it because it's expressed and not only do we have that but then we can see and have a mirror to look at our own lives and say am I mirroring that am I becoming that embodied because it's the as what the prophet said to us as we looked at earlier that it is now embodying itself in the bride I don't know why you wouldn't want that right why who wouldn't want to sell everything and say God that's me you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man [Applause] that's what this message came to do to Quicken us to bring us Abundant Life to take us out of the old forms the denominations that brought us into and bring us to that New and Living Way that Jesus Christ brought to us and said you can live it you can express it and while you're doing that you will feel it greatest calling the highest calling the most noblest of things the group the most wonderful thing that we can do and not only is it just what ought to be done what should be done what God is worthy that is done but if you choose to say God I want that in my life I want to I want to throw off all of these things that that bind me and that take up my time and all of this stuff because I I want that as you do that you will find that it's the most wonderful thing you ever did that it's not a message of Oppression but it's a message of life that it's a message of of joy that it's a message of happiness and fun like like you know it's like brother Trevor you just said the message was fun yes I don't know if you you know think about that as like man this meant man this message is fun but it is yeah right it is because Zion and I were at a technology conference we end where we started with Zion and I at a technology conference and we left this service that we were so happy to get to on Thursday night and go back to the hotel where all of our co-workers are at and they're having the the party at this conference and I'm telling you what you know techie people can that's sad anyway these people are having fun and we walked by the karaoke room and let me tell you what that was a disaster they're not having fun and so Zion and I were Thursday night in a span of five hours contrasted by two forms of fun and I can tell you what it was way more fun having being had here than there was at a convention with music and drinking and all that this message is fun it's rewarding it's fulfilling every everything that's good and wonderful this message is because it's it's it's it's the voice of God to us it's God's character being expressed to us and as and as it becomes living in reality in our life to be the greatest thing the greatest thing let's seek to embody not just know this not just understand it but say God let this word live in me we say those things we say we sing the song I don't know we sing the song everybody awake I don't know we sing the song let the word live in me but let's not that let's not it's not just a saying and so what I hope that I brought to you this morning was to begin to let your mind conceptualize what does it mean to say I want the word living in me to be embodied shall we pray father we love you Lord we love your word I would encourages us and excites us and we want to God we just want to let it live we want to be everything that you called us to be father Aaron wants to be Aaron like you would be Aaron Trevor wants to be Trevor like you would be Trevor there's no greater honor there's no higher calling there's no more rewarding way Lord I just pray that this this broke up sermon would just resonate in their hearts little God and that you would witness the thought at least that I was trying to express to their hearts father May the word of God be that thing that we grow by so bless us now we ask in Jesus name amen we sing that song Let the word live in me dear Lord within Thy Word show me myself [Music] and show me my savior and let the world live there let the words [Music] in me oh let it be our prayer [Music] live [Music] dear Lord [Music] show me myself [Music] within Thy Word Me Myself and show me my savior and let the world live yes let the world live in me I want to live the way the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more if I want to love love to you there's just no more love I could never ever [Music] he warns me to live until there's just no more to give love love till there's just no more love I could never ever [Music] and the boys [Music] [Music] and it's the more [Music] I care yes [Music] control [Music] myself the more so every day I live Lord I love you more Jesus [Music] [Music] from Earth to Glory I know like me over and over [Music] he molds me and makes me into it's like this sure just Acclaim of their souls I am today at this all because [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] well it's Jesus on the inside working for the outside making a difference in my life [Music] a change [Music] oh yes it's Jesus on the inside making your differences [Music] [Applause] in my life [Music] oh Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord man we have been blessed amen thank you it's just I just so appreciate how the Holy Spirit comes God has a way of saying things yes he does it's it's precious you know we've said this many times there's been a lot of times there's things that we want to say and I don't know how to say it but I know how I feel I know it's in my heart but I don't seem like I can get the words to put together but you know God God has a way of more and more as he reveals himself it just comes so much more plain the message of the hour doesn't become more obscure because the message is Christ that that's that's where the that's why we you don't separate the Bible from the message that's that's not what you can't separate that the message is the light that comes upon the word to make that word live and so when we're looking at it and we're approaching these things what we're seeing is we're seeing that word come to pass in our own life and he's changing us now I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand because every one of us would love change to come like that and that is a necessity of the holy spirit because the new birth brings a change inwardly passing from Death unto life but then through that death it leads us to be able to die to our will die to ourselves daily and that's as the Lord spoke to brother Trevor the things that was said so vividly God don't want you being like nobody else don't how many messages how many quotes that we could go through brother Brian even addresses this thinking and spoken words original C well if you had it like this would you be like an act like Abraham like you know no we don't have to go dwell intense it was all a type but when he stood there that day and he says who do men say that I am some say you're Jeremiah some say you're enlightened some say on and on and on but what was it it was that portion of Christ that was reflected through Jeremiah through Atlanta and that's the same way it is in our lives it's a that portion of Christ because you or me and ourselves are not the entire body we are a member of the body and then collectively together this is why we need one another because you know what it is it's Christ in me longing for Christ in you that's how the body operates and so it's us it's yielding and letting go and all of that is the glory of God taking place I mean I just say it like this the glory of God is just not the event that is we see but it's his glory that's working behind the scenes where our will is submitting to his will that's the glory of God because before you ever seen the glory in the outer Realms of the Tabernacle it was the glory abiding within the holiest of holies and every one of those Realms everyone the veil is what it was called then the hanging then the gate every one of them veil was was separated it had the cherubims on it but every one of them had the same coloration red blue white the purple all the way you know why because from in the end it would be Christ reflecting from within all the way through and that's why brother Brahms says when the Holy Ghost comes he doesn't take away your temperament your temperament is your makeup right I mean we could just preach husbands and wives here right now right husbands can't change their wives wives can't change the husband God put us together right and that's why brother Brandon says the Holy Spirit comes and sets down in the middle of your temperament and that's why he would take a service like that and things that are to be and say if you ever tried to judge James by Peter you would put James out or judge Paul about Peter or just see we don't judge one another by our lives our Our Lives individually are judged by the words it's us and God and it's Christ in US it's God working God Desiring to be expressed that that longing that you have in your life that I have in my life you know what that is that's God longing to be expressed that's the groaning that you have that's the desire that you have that's God longing to be expressed so it's it's Christ in us and it's I say God make it more real make it more real they help me help me Lord to dine more to myself because when God makes it more real I want you to understand this and I believe you do making it more real doesn't mean where it just goes when it becomes more real you realize just how simple it really is and when you realize wait a minute how many times you hear Brother Brown say this over and over this guy right here is my worst enemy but if I can just surrender to the god in a human being I'm not preaching on tonight's service because there's nothing to be added to that this morning it just I just I just I loved it to me that's it's yeah you can put that in your lunchbox and take it with you that's how the gospel is supposed to be amen I I just I appreciate that amen I love that amen and I know you and sister Barb are feeling pretty good foreign real good today I feel sorry for those that's got to go out to eat with them they

ministered in a lot of different places a lot of countries goes and ministers and a lot of and we so appreciate the gift and I appreciate how like I said when I've watched him and I know even from my own voice how he's worked and labored because I said it at byc I said you know I said this from the pope and I said really we study we prepare in the ministers and here we labor and then you know there's in the laboring and after service I said but I get to go back to my dorm these brothers right here brother Trevor's known to run around with sound system at byc but these brothers many times are up to three four five in the morning counseling 101. but the Holy Spirit has dealt with lives and hearts and things have been done and I don't say that the lit brother Trevor up but I'll tell you
