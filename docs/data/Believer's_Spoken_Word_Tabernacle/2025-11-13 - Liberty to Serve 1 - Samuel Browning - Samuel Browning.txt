And it's so good to be good to be gathered together here tonight and so good to be back home. And we certainly appreciate your prayers for us while we were gone. And especially with everything that was going on with the um flights or what could have been. And um uh so we just thank God for his mercy. I I think it was some of the smoothest that we had. And uh so we are just thankful to God for his mercy and I certainly appreciate your prayers. Um I certainly uh could feel the prayers. We we arrived there and um had just a little bit of time to try to get our feet underneath us there because of the time difference. Three hours different. And so when it's nine o'clock there, it's midnight. This is I'm ready for bed. So, um, we had four four services there in a row and, um, God was so gracious to us. And I'm not going to keep you standing. I may just touch on that just a little bit here. But, um, I want to just say thank you for your prayers because God certainly gave us the strength and, um, it was just such a blessing. uh brother John and the brother John Andes and the congregation there certainly asked that we would just convey their greetings and thanks to you [music] and so uh I said I would do that and uh so we just certainly love the Lord and Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer tonight as we prepare to just get into the word. Heavenly Father, Lord, how thankful we are for your mercies once again. Thank you Lord for giving us another opportunity Lord Father where we could just come and Lord God to present ourselves Lord to you Lord to fellowship around the word of God Lord knowing that your word Lord it has life within it Father and so Lord we just ask [music] that you would just come and Lord just just speak to our hearts tonight. May the life itself Lord just travel through the body. May you minister, Lord, to each of our needs that's gathered here. Lord, I just reserve myself Lord to you. [music] Ask that you would lead completely, Father. Lord, forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings. May your grace just move upon us, Lord, here tonight. Help us that we can see you. We can recognize you. Help us, Lord, to see, Father, the application of the word in our own lives, Lord, in a personal way, God. May our hearts and our lives just be ever so edified and encouraged because you have come, Lord. And, Father, just refreshed in your presence. And Father, with a desire just moving in our hearts that we want to just serve you better, Lord, we want to be closer to you, Lord. I pray that you would help us tonight, Lord. Be with the Lord, the different needs, Lord, that was read across this pull pit already, [music] the unspoken request, the needs upon the hearts of your children. Lord, may you just minister, Lord, to each one of our needs tonight. We commit ourselves into your hands, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. Amen. As we turn into the word. Thank you, musicians. I want to um read here a very familiar passage of scripture to us. And um [clears throat] just to take a thought from here and here how Paul is just really expressing of the very character and life of the c of life of Christ knowing what would be in the possession of the believers and what we uh would be called to. In other words, there would be an effect of this life. Paul said in verse one of Philippians 2, "If there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, and if any bows and mercies fulfill you, my joy, that you be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord and of one mind, and let nothing be done through strife or vain glory. But in loneliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves, and look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Verse five, let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Amen. God bless you as you're being seated. I'd like to speak here tonight on this thought and um just trusting as we go along that it will uh be conveyed as it um uh was so just pressed on my heart and um to know the liberty to serve and how we are so thankful to God for real true liberty that the gospel has brought that the Holy Spirit has brought to our lives and that real liberty when we look at that word it means to be as one ought to be and we're thankful for God's mercy of what God has done in our lives and he has brought us to a real liberty to where that we can really serve his purpose and his will and we certainly become aware and mindful of the of really of the spiritual things as brother Brandham would say it in one place when we have been born again of the spirit of God. He says you then have become a candidate for association with the angelic beings to where that they will bring and deliver to our hearts the very things that we have need of and God would speak to our lives and and truly within our lives. remember brother Brandham would take uh a familiar um statement well I'll say a statement that where he was told to pick up his pen and write and we're we're as message believers we would be very uh familiar with this where it would speak here is the secret and it's dealing with how that the life is in the seed and then into the place where the seed is quickened when life comes upon it because that's that was the purpose of the Holy Spirit coming is to make redemption real and to bring real liberty into the heart and life of the believer. And brother Bam would write that or under the influence of the Holy Spirit that the secret is this that the bride has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name. She has thus sayaith the Lord. And I when we look at that quote, I I I believe that when we're seeing this in the message that the message when the God's life within us, it's a life that has come uh God's life to change our lives. And there's an application that comes into our life for each and every day. The the message, we understand this that it's not um doctrines yet. God restored true doctrines, but we could have all the doctrines just right and we could miss the life. That's right. &gt;&gt; And so the most important thing is is if we have the life, it will bring us to the doctrine be the right doctrine and the right understanding that we need because the Bible said when he the spirit of truth has come, he will lead and guide us into all truth. And the prophet said that's one of the true signs and evidence and rising of the sun. He said is how when the spirit of God has come into your life, it will direct you on into the word. It never takes you away but it's directing you on into the word. And we recognize being directed on into the word is not just you know being able to lay things in order but when we are recognizing that the word is the very person of Jesus Christ it's God. It's Melzdc who who is among us. All of these things through the scripture. And so we just don't see just u of of theology or or what or just truth as far as a letter because truth is a person. And so what what the message has come to bring us in contact with and a real union is with the person of Jesus Christ. And so it's to bring forth it's it's uniting with that character of life because that's the the only way that that that same character can be reproduced as it was in the body of the Lord Jesus is if that same spirit be inside of us. And that spirit inside of us when it comes upon the seed that is already there. Then that seed itself as it would as it will yield and the spirit of God moving in our life it begins to manifest if if I can say it in this way just like every bit of the apples and leaves are in one seed that's the same way within our life everything and all that we are to be as a part of that word it already lays within that seed &gt;&gt; there's a statement that I really love where it says that you know we can count the seed seeds in an apple. But only God can count the apples in a seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so God already knows what lays inside of you and I when we consider the virtues as we Peter would speak of those things. Those virtues are already laying there in that seed. And it takes the Holy Spirit to begin to quicken that word to our life. And remember the restoring of this relationship in the fullness brings us back to St. John 5:19 that the son can do nothing but what he seeth the father doing that doeth the son likewise. So God is is moving a people. You and I are being moved by the eye of God. The in other words the vision or the revelation of the word is what has to break upon our lives. There's there's things that we can um be able to even set down and um many times I've realized this even sometimes even in counseling or even sitting with a person and just trying to find just just the leading of the Lord because there's many things that can be said but yet if if it's not the right timing and what is actually going to be said is truth but if it's not the right timing it'll never be received but because it it has to be seen mean in that way. And so God and that's it's not about and that's why I said it's not not about make it see it my way or whatever and it's just God God has a way of doing it friends. He had you know there's things that I' I've marveled over the years where God will take a text and take a service and God will bring things and bring things out in a service and you'll have where it'll so speak to a life. I was speaking there on the the Sunday night service and just begin to get into some strains there um in that service and dealing with you know rejection and dealing with accusations and dealing with those types of things that we all uh must come through as Joseph did. And here an individual met me in the foyer and I had went back to um you know greet the brothers. I was standing back there greeting all the saints as they were going out and then I went back to thank the audio and video people for them tolerating and putting up with me and and through things you know and uh and so as I'm back there then one brother he stops me when we get on the foyer and he said you know he said the Holy Spirit just began to bring such conviction he said to my heart about bitterness and he said what it is he said I had become bitter he said toward an individual because he said it seemed seemed like they just walked past me a couple times and didn't shake my hand. He said, "But I" He said, "When that word was coming forth, I said, God, if you'll give me the opportunity as soon as this service is over, I'm going to go make that thing right because I don't want to be a hindrance in the service." And so &gt;&gt; I I say I say that for this regard is that it takes God to show you and I &gt;&gt; and that's why that your walk with God is not the walk of you resting on a man. It's your resting on God. &gt;&gt; It's God revealing himself. And this is where that we want to be in our lives is say, "Lord, show me how to to to apply the word because we're living in the age of application, the token, the life, the very the very person of Jesus Christ. We're living in that hour and it's such a crucial time even in our lives because we realize how we could go by our own feelings and we have and man, we've been wrong and that's where we get in our own trouble." But when we can just pause and no matter we might think that I've got to get this or you know press this in but when we can just wait on the Lord oh my the Bible says wait on the Lord and be of good courage and he will strengthen your heart. God will give us the wisdom that we need even how to apply the word that is in season to our situation. And so even the waiting is God molding us and shaping us as the children of God because patience is being worked out within our lives. And so when I look at this thought here on the liberty to serve the scripture, I want to just take just a portion from where we read and it says, "But he made of himself of no reputation and took upon him the form or the visage what would be seen to others as the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself. So just to be fashioned as a man was not enough humility. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; But being found fashioned as a man because as the prophet would say it over and over, he says this was humiliation to think the God of glory &gt;&gt; who who had who had even the atoms and the molecules, the dust created, the angels, everything. And now God stepping down and taking on himself a part of his own creation where God would become one one of you and I. It would not seem fitting that, you know, to think of the King of Kings, not just a king because we could even dwell there for a moment, but the King of Kings would lay aside all of his kingly garments and dawn upon himself uh a body made in the likeness of sinful flesh like you and I. And the whole purpose of that was for redemption. And I know that's very common terms to us, but when Jesus was here, he just did not uh come. He just didn't step forward, you know, as a fully grown man and then that's it. But he he came through every stage of life and he could have he you know he couldn't have just come and just stepped out like he did uh and met Abraham because he had to come through the woman where the fall had taken place in order to be able to be our perfect sacrifice and to undo what was done in the fall. So everything was for a purpose and yet even within it he was purposed for redemption. But even in them even in his whole journey he he he did all that he did in order that he might understand us in order that he might be the right kind of a mediator that he might be a faithful and merciful high priest. I I'm so thankful that when you and I can go to him he doesn't go and say, "Well, I don't know. I I can't relate to what you're going through. I I don't understand that temptation. But as a matter of fact, he he possessed the gate of all the enemies. He he withtood in every one of the three ways that John describes that temptation can come. He possessed the gates of the enemy. He had his own personal temptations. Satan so uh personally attacked him just like he personally attacks you and I. And he and he attacks you even within your position. He attacks you. You know, even as we come in moments of weakness, he attacked the Lord Jesus in a time of weakness when he was of of of of a hunger and showing that how that temptation will come even in those moments of weakness. We are tempted in many ways. But to understand this when we look at the scripture he took upon him the form of a servant and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself the whole life and ministry of the Lord Jesus of God come down was a life of humility. &gt;&gt; That's true &gt;&gt; all the way. There was not just a certain day or time where it kicked in but it was continual humility. Yes, it was. &gt;&gt; And it was it was humbling even in the humbling of himself to the needs of others. Even humbling himself when others were distraught and all tore apart, he himself humbled himself to minister to the needs in that situation in order that they might receive what they had need of. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; So even their discouragements, it it did not cause HIM TO DRAW BACK. He he ministered. He humbled himself and and to minister to those needs. Even the man the pool salom. We could go on and on. There's many many needs that we the Lord Jesus minister to that we do not even have record that these individuals continued to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't have anything about the the widow of Naine, her son. We have nothing. We we don't have did she go on to serve the Lord? Did she walk on in the light OF THE TRUTH? WE DON'T KNOW. BUT JESUS DID NOT CONFINE HUMBLING HIMSELF to minister to a need based on whether or not someone was going to continue on. &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE HAVE RECORDED IN THE scriptures of the Roman centurion who recognized the position of the Lord Jesus. He recognized who he was. He is able to relate and recognize he's a man of authority like I am. So if if I speak and those underneath me carry it out, then he likewise if he all he needs to do is speak and my servant will be healed. REMEMBER HE JUST SAID JUST JUST SPEAK THE WORD. I I DON'T EVEN NEED YOU TO COME TO my house. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SO COMMENDS him for his faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There you go. BECAUSE HIS FAITH WAS IN recognizing that the word is sufficient. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Gyrus said, "COME LAY YOUR HANDS ON MY DAUGHTER." NOW, I LISTEN, LET ME JUST tell you something right now. I I don't believe that we we need to put ourselves to try to be more spiritual and say, "Well, I'm just going to be like the Roman centurion, JUST SPEAK THE WORD." THERE MIGHT BE TIMES AND needs that you're going to need someone to come and pray for you because the scripture does say lay hands on the sick. &gt;&gt; It does say WHEN YOU'RE SICK, CALL for the elders of the church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, we can't WE CAN'T DO AWAY WITH THIS. AND NEITHER DOES GOD WANT US TO BRING OURSELVES UP TO A PLACE OR SOMEHOW, WELL, I don't need this and I DON'T NEED THIS. NO, GOD HAS A WAY OF WORKING IN OUR LIFE TO EVEN TO CAUSE THE SURROUNDING CONDITIONS TO BRING ABOUT a recognition of humility, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; FOR US TO humble ourselves just like uh in coming into that place and in humility and maybe we say, "Well, I I'm not going to go that way. I'm not going to go the route of the doctor. I'm not going to go that route." And then finally as it comes around, that's the very route that God will take us. And because the doctors never healed anybody, &gt;&gt; all healing comes from God. &gt;&gt; But you see what it is, it's our and and I want to say this and and and just to give me the the liberty to SAY IT, IT'S MANY times our own pride that gets in the way that we place a a certain testimony of healing up here where nobody needed surgery and then we place the one down here of surgery. Let me just tell you the prophet under THE HOLY SPIRIT PUT THEM on equal ground. And right over here in Erie, Pennsylvania, he said God performs miracles through surgeries. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So this the MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, it was working. You see, it's the character OF CHRIST THAT'S BEING REVEALED. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET could say even clear back in the message all things there. I believe it's in 62. And he's pointing ahead to the opening of the seals. AND HE SAYS, "OH, WHEN we get into the opening of those seals, it will be the revealing of the very character of Jesus Christ." THIS IS WHY THE prophet when he he he reminds us of this in come follow me in 6063 June June of 63. And he also will say it again. He says that when the coming of this ministry will not be so much a change in the ministry as it will be a change in the man. &gt;&gt; So the ministry OF THE THIRD POOL WAS NOT A CHANGE OF MINISTRY. IT WAS A CHANGE OF THE MAN. &gt;&gt; GOD CHANGING THE MAN TO FIT THE MINISTRY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S THE WHOLE THING THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT GOD'S WORKING ON IS TO BECAUSE WITH THE UNION OF A BRIDE IN CHRIST, WHAT A union is to be, ONLY GOD CAN CAN take and and and take two and say 1 + 1 EQUALS ONE. IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, even when you look mathematically, THERE HAS TO BE A POSITIVE and a negative for there to be one remaining. AND SO A GOD and a and a people so coming together to where it would be able to be identified THAT SHE IS BONE OF HIS BONE, FLESH OF HIS flesh and the prophet said she is him. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S HIS CHARACTER, it's his life. And so this is why that even when we look at look look at the scripture to know what we have BEEN CALLED TO THE PROPHET WILL TAKE THIS portion of scripture and he'll preach it in unveiling of God mighty God unveiled before us and all the way through the identification messages also identified with Christ BECAUSE TO BE IDENTIFIED JUST LIKE ALL OF THOSE WHO have lived before all the true elect believers they were identified by the word of God that God gave in that hour. AND HOW WERE THEY identified with it? By their submission to the word and allowing the word to have preeminence in their life. The word was there to identify that they were believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the same way it is within you and I. It's it's the ability that God has placed within you and I to be able to see him. The prophet says it like this in spiritual food and due season. He said there the gift in me and it's the gift in you. And he said as the word is COMING HE SAID THAT OPENS up a secret channel right there. And he said what's happening is there's a feeding that's going on in that time. While others it can just go right over. But there's a channel that's opening and there's a feeding that's taking place. THAT THAT'S WHY WHEN we're looking at the word we're not just we're not just HEARING A WORD. WE'RE NOT JUST WE'RE NOT LIKE IT WAS LIKE was was recorded in the Sardisian age where the prophet said that time under Luther not Luther but men who came under that brother Ram said in the church age book he said there was enough truth in that in that age for for for for there to set forth a millennium but men he said begin to take the truth and study it in order to debate it instead of living it. SO THEY THEY THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH TRUTH, BUT THEY NEVER GOT UNDER THE ANOINTING OF THE person of truth. &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT WITH THIS MESSAGE THAT IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO KNOW THE MESSAGE, BUT TO COME UNDER THE ANOINTING OF THE MESSAGE BECAUSE THE MESSAGE is the anointing and the word is THE ANOINTING. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE QUICKENING POWER, THE HOLY SPIRIT. BECAUSE WHEN WE GET UNDER THAT ANOINTING, THEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE THINGS THE WAY GOD WANTS US TO SEE IT. AND there's being a real examining in our life and a reflection of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So notice he humbled himself and became obedient unto death. Even the death of the cross he became. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Remember he the Bible says that he he he in Hebrews 5:7 that he was heard in that he feared. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW WHAT AWAITED HIM. THAT WAS NOT A PLAY on words. He the Bible SAYS IN JOHN 12, "MY SOUL IS TROUBLED." &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T THAT HE WOULD BE LOST. HE KNEW WHAT AWAITED HIM. AND HE ALSO KNEW THE PURPOSE HE WAS CALLED TO. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT? He would say that through THE SCRIPTURES. BUT TO NOTICE TO BECOME OBEDIENT unto death. Here he is even in the garden of Gethsemane wrestling it out. &gt;&gt; Showing remember I I love how the scripture goes on in Hebrews 5 to say that he learned obedience by the things that HE SUFFERED. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OBEDIENCE HAS A PRICE. &gt;&gt; YES, IT DOES. OBEDIENCE IS NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT'S A GIVEN. YOU KNOW, AND YOU UNDERSTAND AS A CHILD OF GOD THAT OUR BIGGEST BATTLE IS WITH OURSELVES. &gt;&gt; It's with OUR OWN WILL. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID HE WAS CONTENDING WITH HIMSELF. GOD SO SUBJECTED HIMSELF TO BECOME ONE OF US TO WHERE HERE THE LORD JESUS COULD SAY, "NEVERTHELESS, NOT MY WILL, THY WILL BE DONE." AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WOULD SO SUBJECT TO WHERE HE WOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND YOU AND I AND BE able to minister TO YOU AND I. LET ME JUST say this friends. IF THE LORD JESUS HAD TO PRAY EARNESTLY AND IT WAS FOR THREE TIMES AND THE BIBLE SAYS IT BECAME OBEDIENT UNTO DEATH, THEN HOW MUCH MORE THE SPIRIT OF GOD DEALING WITH YOU and your your LIFE AND MY LIFE. IT MIGHT TAKE THIS SERVICE, ANOTHER SERVICE, ANOTHER SERVICE. IT MIGHT TAKE A WHOLE COLLECTION OF SERVICES TOGETHER, BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS GOD IS BRINGING ABOUT IN our life AN OBEDIENCE AND A DYING TO SELF. &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIMES WE CAN GET FRUSTRATED IN THE MIX CUZ WE DON'T SEE IT SEEM LIKE IT'S KICKING IN or it's WORKING FAST ENOUGH AND WE FEEL LIKE, WELL, I got the same battle. I GOT THE SAME ISSUE. BUT DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE WORD of God. &gt;&gt; THE WORD OF GOD IS WORKING IN THAT HOUR. AND REMEMBER when he prayed and there were angels that came and ministered to him AFTER IT WAS ALL FINISHED. &gt;&gt; AND GOD KNOWS, LISTEN, IT'S NOT SOMETHING, WELL, IT'S JUST EASY. NO, WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT ARE DIFFICULT AND IT ISN'T THAT WE DON'T WANT TO PLEASE THE LORD, BUT WHERE THE THINGS THAT ARE THE MOST DIFFICULT IN OUR LIVES IS WHEN IT COMES TO THE MOLDING of our character. YEAH, &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REAL CHALLENGE RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES WANTED TO SUBJUGATE AND AND AND AND you know, just kind of like give themselves an excuse. Well, WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR? THEY WANTED TO JUSTIFY THEMSELVES BECAUSE THAT IS DIFFICULT WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE CHARACTER OF CHRIST BECAUSE A CHARACTER IS NOT a gift. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the gift of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The character is a victory. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So God is taking this in this life right now to mold us and prepare us for that which is to come. &gt;&gt; And so this is this servant is one who will give himself up to another's will. Gives himself up to another's will. those whose service is used by Christ in extending and advancing his cause among men devoted to another to the disregard of one's own interest. I want to say he made a way that you and I could come fully to this &gt;&gt; because you could study very deeply among the prophets. Not one of them came [clears throat] to this place. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yet each of them were displaying a part of him. That's no disregard. They did not have they did not have access to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit of the new birth that you and I have. It would come on them. It would leave come and it would leave. But now THROUGH CHRIST, HE'S THE FIRST OF THIS NEW CREATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. REMEMBER ON WHOM THOU SEETH THE SPIRIT DESCEND AND remain &gt;&gt; the same is he. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So then we come to this here in in the book of Matthew, a familiar scripture. And knowing that how that the Lord Jesus would so surrender his life, the prophet said he surrendered his natural parts. He surrendered his thinking. He surrendered his own cares. &gt;&gt; I do only that which &gt;&gt; pleases the father. &gt;&gt; He even had a he had the he had the right and I want you just to listen this for a moment. Very familiar parts. The prophet would say he takes the scripture I sanctify myself for thy sake. He had a right to have a home a right to be married a right to good clothes but he sanctified himself or rather forfeited. HE FORFEITED HIS RIGHTS. &gt;&gt; He could have come down corridors of glory, fully statured man, Allan an angelic band, but he sanctified himself. Many, many, many other places he said that we could go, but he he did this because HE WAS TRAINING NOT ONLY IN REDEMPTION, but he was training those that was going to follow him. Yeah, it's so good. &gt;&gt; And this is where when the scripture we're familiar with this passage where after the uh sons of thunder and you know their mother had asked you know grant that one will set on the left and one on the right and you know then this caused some contention among the the disciples there and man it got it got things heated well you know who's going to be the greatest and I'm going to be the greatest and all it all that did was expose that human nature that was there. The same way when they were waiting in the upper room, it exposed human nature with trying to place something in or put something in place instead of waiting on God. Remember they had all the qualifications who will take the place of Judas and they laid Peter Peter laid these different qualifica. It must be this and it must be that and it must be that. AND HERE IT COMES INTO a man by the name of Mias. YOU DON'T READ ONE TIME. IN the scripture where God ever used that man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; NOW, I'M NOT SAYING that he didn't use Matias in SOME WAY, BUT HE WASN'T ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY WERE THINKING. &gt;&gt; GOD ALREADY KNEW PAUL IS GOING TO FIT IN THAT PLACE &gt;&gt; AS MY APOSTLE. &gt;&gt; GOD ALREADY KNEW THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE, EVEN IN THAT, YOU CAN SEE GOD OVERLOOKING THE HUMANITY. SO, DON'T LOOK DOWN ON PETER. GOD HAS OVERLOOKED OUR HUMANITY. THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT THIS WILL GO HERE AND THIS WILL GO HERE. BUT GOD OVERLOOKS THE HUMANITY AND HE JUST SIMPLY REVEALS HIS WORD. AND WHEN HIS WORD IS REVEALED JUST AS A MAGNET WILL RESPOND TO ANOTHER, YOU ARE ORDAINED to respond to this word. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; It really takes it out of our hands, don't it? It puts the grace of God so high and lifted up. &gt;&gt; And this is where when the when when the Lord Jesus he established even even on his expression and being here even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister it's to serve and to give his life a ransom for many. SO WE COULD ALSO LOOK at the life of the Lord Jesus as he would even express about the lily and the lily is really a PUBLIC SERVANT. THE PROPHET would would take would go through examples in the message and speak of how that the gift within his life even you remember when he was laying there on the uh the road in um right outside of Amarillo and I brother Jeremy took me right by the hospital where he was at when he passed where brother Brandham had passed and and but he's laying out there on the road remember he he he he asked Billy put my hand on mama &gt;&gt; right amen THE GIFT WAS NOT FOR HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; It was not for himself. AND THIS IS WHY THAT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TALK ABOUT he said that it's the benefit of the gift is for you. I am a public servant. &gt;&gt; It's not about me. HE AND EVEN SAID IT BROTHER BRAND WILL SAY IT COUNTLESS TIMES. HE SAYS there's things that even he'll say this in many places of the message. One of them is even in kinsman redeemer where if somebody says brother Brandham I guess you know before anything happens you know all about it. And brother Brandham says, "No, no, no, no, no. The gift is not for me. I can't use it for myself. You're the one that gets the benefit, not me. I'M JUST A PUBLIC SERVANT OF God to you." &gt;&gt; That's good. And brother Ramy establishes why that even where a minister will study and he's praying and he's waiting ON GOD TO TRY TO find that leading of the Lord for for the PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S MANY WONDERFUL things that could be spoken. There's many wonderful things, friends. We're we're not in any shortage. It's finding the mind of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And just sharing a little bit and maybe I'll share it just in this regards. I if if anybody would have asked me on Sunday morning walking in there to uh the the assembly up there to brother John's and I've had it happen to me a few time a few some times usually a lot of times even when I'm out but I've had it happen here but I I I I was ready to go. I I thought my you know this this whole channel is really inspired and so forth. And then just a moment in the office and there was a brother that come in and we were talking and shook his hand and began to just just greet him and so forth. And then you know brother John had wanted me to come out when he was just kind of you know going over the fourth year anniversary of the people and we were going to pray over brother Steve Clar on before he depart to India and and we're and I'm standing back there and I'm saying oh god where do I even go this morning because it was like everything that was so inspired it just I knew I knew I could I could I could force it but it won't it won't go nowhere. &gt;&gt; It it'll be it'll be like an airplane with a blunt end a paper airplane. it is it'll just nose dive. You say, "How do you know that?" Done it before. &gt;&gt; Start out in one way and but God prepares us and works with our lives and and teaches us and and so as I was standing back there and I was just was waiting. I was praying and the Holy Spirit just spoke to my heart and said, "Follow me." &gt;&gt; I don't know where I was going. I had no idea. So, I just opened up and I began to read uh Job chapter 23 again. And the very first few first first few verses of of of the scripture is where it begin to inspire my heart. If I can have just a moment with him, &gt;&gt; if I can find him in that moment in that service, how the Lord just moved within such a marvelous way to where there were lives setting there that here there even comes a young man that DOESN'T KNOW ONE THING ABOUT serving the Lord. And even in the midst of the service, he goes out. Brother Steve actually goes out. I don't even know about it and he and he prays with that young man. They get down in the parking lot while the service is going on BECAUSE HE SAID, "THAT'S OVERWHELMING, isn't it?" And he said, "Yes." And all of THESE HAD JUST COME ROUGH ROUGH SOME ROUGH BACKGROUNDS AND THINGS. BUT GOD JUST DIDN'T DEAL WITH THAT SITUATION. THERE WERE MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. AND I WANT TO SAY THANK GOD FOR HIS GRACE THAT GOD BE SO MINDFUL. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. AND WE MUST HAVE THAT AS A MINISTER. THERE'S MANY WONDERFUL THINGS THAT WE CAN MINISTER, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT PREACHING A SERMON. &gt;&gt; AND EVEN WHEN GOD'S GIVEN NOTES WITHIN THINGS, IT'S STILL IT'S NOT ABOUT TRYING TO PREACH SOMETHING AND JUST TO PREACH A SERMON. IT'S ABOUT WHAT ARE THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE, LORD? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; What are the needs of THE PEOPLE? &gt;&gt; AND I THANK GOD FOR HIS GRACE. SOMETIMES GOD HAS to take us through moldings and training and TEACHING JUST FOR MOMENTS LIKE THIS. AND LISTEN, WE WE LEARN THROUGH THE TRAININGS THAT GOD BRINGS US THROUGH JUST FOR MOMENTS LIKE THAT, JUST TO RELY UPON HIM, JUST to rest upon him. And so as a public servant, you know, you you JUST YOU GIVE YOURSELF OUT. AND I DON'T WANT TO JUST CONFINE THAT TO THE LORD JESUS. I DON'T WANT TO CONFINE THAT TO JUST A MINISTER BUT I WANT TO BRING IT DOWN TO YOU BECAUSE THE PROPHET takes you and me in the message how can overcome and he expresses that our lives are liies. We were born underneath the mud and gunk and in the pond. But God quickening, quickening, quickening, quickening, has raised us up. AND THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF RAISING IT up is so that life might be given. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To others, &gt;&gt; so that it would be an expression &gt;&gt; to others. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose of of your life. And don't ever underestimate your influence. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And it isn't that you always have to be saying something. you. True. There's times to say things, but your life, &gt;&gt; it speaks. &gt;&gt; It speaks. And so within this liberty, I want to just take this this scripture here just for a moment and notice how Paul writes this in the book of Galatians. He says, "For brethren, ye have been called unto liberty. only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word. Even in this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another. And then Paul gives the remedy. Walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of THE FLESH. NOTICE PAUL never never gave them a false expectation to say, "Well, you're no longer going to have the lust of the flesh." He said, "Walk in the spirit and THE LUST OR DESIRES OF THE FLESH are brought subject." &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND NOT JUST BROUGHT SUBJECT but you receive not only strength but there's A VISION OF CHRIST AND A FELLOWSHIP THAT YOU HAVE WITH HIM THAT AFFECTS when you come out because you really don't come out of the holies of holies but there's an effect of the do of his presence of the aroma of being in his presence of being in and just in PRAYER JUST JUST THE TIMES OF MEDITATION remember prayer Pray is not the position of your body. &gt;&gt; It's the connection of your heart with God. &gt;&gt; You can pray just as well with setting up many times as I'm out with just as I was here within this time in Washington. I'm I'm out early in the morning. I just I take off. I don't want to disturb my wife. So I'm out real early, go out and get a coffee and I go out and sit. I'll find somewhere to sit and pray and because I could sit right there and and just the presence of God and just praying about the meetings, praying about needs back here, praying about things. I I give you that example to show you that JUST TO ENCOURAGE YOU. DON'T LIMIT prayer to a POSITION OR TO EVEN WELL IN MY CLOSET. CLOSET IS NOT NECESSARILY JUST A CLOSET. YOU CAN HAVE A CLOSET. THAT'S FINE. YOU HAVE A PLACE YOU GET AWAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT. But let me just say it to you like this. Anywhere in any place where you can get away and alone with God. &gt;&gt; Oh, to be shut in with God. &gt;&gt; Is that right? SO NOTICE PAUL IS IS GIVING US this is the victory of it. So if if WE'RE UNDER THE THOUGHT OR THE pretense of I'm going to get to a place where I'll never have these battles. No, the the battles will become more uh more apparent as as the based on where our fellowship is at with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now I want TO REMIND YOU, YOU COULD SPEND AN hour in prayer and not spend any time in prayer. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? BECAUSE IT'S NOT A TRADITION. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SPEND AN HOUR IN THE BIBLE AND NOT SPEND any time in the Bible. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SPEND AN hour listening to the message and not be any time in it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what is that?" IT'S ABOUT, "LORD, CONDITION MY HEART, LORD." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS IS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING OF DUTY. IT'S ABOUT CONDITIONING OUR HEART THAT WHEN NO MATTER from reading the word, listening to THE MESSAGE IN TIMES OF PRAYER, THERE SHOULD BE AN EFFECT OF SWEETNESS AND RELEASE THAT THAT COMES UPON OUR LIFE TO WHERE WE RELEASE THE CARES AND THE BURDENS THAT WE'RE CARRYING, THE FEELINGS AND ALL OF THOSE things that want to weigh us down AND HINDER US FROM BEING A REAL SERVANT BEFORE GOD AND TO ONE ANOTHER. WE WANT TO BE ABLE to lay our burdens there. And I realize sometimes that's very difficult. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. There's times where even as we've been in prayer and time the way that you know you have segments and things of time because not everyone has maybe a privilege or opportunity. We all have have different things of schedules and things that we have to do and tasks and so forth, meetings, appointments, things and whatever more. But yet within it all, what what is very very very important is always always placing your heart before God and examining your heart and letting and being real with that. Then Lord, Lord, remedy my heart. Lord, take anything contrary. Don't just, you know, we just don't want to, like I said, say what is the right thing because it's the right thing to say. God's not interested in that. HE SAW THAT with the Pharisees. He saw that with the Sadducees. God doesn't want religion. He wants our heart. SO EVEN IF OUR HEART IS NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE, IF WE can at least SUBMIT IT TO GOD AND BE HONEST WITH GOD, IT MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN JUST A FEW MOMENTS, BUT WATCH WHAT WILL TAKE PLACE IN YOUR LIFE AS YOU DEPOSIT YOUR HEART INTO HIS HAND AND SAY, "GOD, YOU TOOK A LITTLE LAD'S LUNCH AND YOU MULTIPLIED IT. LORD, I GIVE YOU MY HEART. I DON'T WANT THIS FEELING IN MY HEART. I DON'T WANT THIS IN MY SPIRIT." AND YOU SUBMIT IT TO HIM AND WATCH what will take place. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Bham takes that thought and says, "You do that in this service." And he said, "You watch as you will submit your heart in this service." He said, "You'll watch by the time just a few moments down the road, you'll find the Holy Spirit right in your life." G. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PRIVILEGE WE HAVE TO place it into God's hands. &gt;&gt; So, there's a liberty that we have to serve. And I I want to say it in that way, a liberty to serve because the scripture here says that we looked at brethren, you've been called to liberty. HOW MANY ARE thankful we've been called to liberty? &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN CALLED TO WHAT is real true freedom and liberty in Jesus Christ. Who has brought that about? The blood of Jesus Christ has been shed for our sins AND THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS BROUGHT THAT REALITY to where there IS A LIBERTY. WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT WALKING WITH OUR HEAD OVER OUR shoulder wondering am I GOING TO BE TAKEN BACK INTO THAT THERE'S A LIBERTY. OUR DESIRE HAS BEEN CHANGED. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THAT WE JUST DON'T WANT TO DO THE THINGS OF THE world anymore. BUT WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS COME, OUR DESIRE IS TO PLEASE HIM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID IN THE MESSAGE, ONENESS. HE SAID, I'M CONVINCED THAT MANY OF US JUST RECEIVE ENOUGH OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO WE DON'T WANT TO SMOKE. WE DON'T want to this. We don't. He said, as a MATTER OF FACT, WE DON'T WANT TO DO NOTHING. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, BUT GOD WANTS TO FILL EVERY FIBER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, NOT JUST TO TAKE THE WANT OUT. THAT'S SANCTIFICATION. BUT WHERE THE DESIRE IS CHANGED AND TO WHERE THE HE'S I WANT TO JUST PLEASE HIM. THAT'S MY HEART'S DESIRE. &gt;&gt; AND TO PLEASE HIM, YES, WE'LL HAVE TO WRESTLE OUT OUR WILL BECAUSE IT WILL CALL UPON US SUBMITTING OUR CHARACTER BECAUSE WE AS HIM ARE LAMBS AS he was the lamb. We are lambs of God &gt;&gt; and we are led &gt;&gt; to the slaughter. Amen. &gt;&gt; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life of the Lord Jesus might be made manifest. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN BROUGHT UNTO LIBERTY ONLY. Use not liberty &gt;&gt; for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. So I want to just I want to say it in this way. LIBERTY TO SERVE AND POSE THE QUESTION TO YOU. Can and is it possible liberty that we have to be used in the wrong way? &gt;&gt; Now I'm pulling this from scripture. Now let me just give you a little bit here. WE RECOGNIZE THAT GOD DOESN'T make us do nothing. &gt;&gt; It's not by works. &gt;&gt; Come on. That that we have done. &gt;&gt; IT'S BY THE SOVEREIGN GRACE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. CUZ YOU COULD SIT HERE AND have works either that are missed OR THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE THAT YOU COULD SIT HERE AND BATTLE IN YOUR MIND. BUT WHEN YOU RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR WORKS, NO MATTER WHICH WAY THEY WHICH WAY IT WOULD GO, EVEN IN YOUR FAILURES, LET ME NARROW IT DOWN TO THAT OF YOUR MISTAKES, THAT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE GRACE OF GOD BECAUSE THE GRACE OF GOD BY THE HOLY SPIRIT SAYS HE IS YOUR PROPITUATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YEAH. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY YOU NEEDED AN ADVOCATE. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD. &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST DID NOT COME TO MAKE YOU A PERFECT PERSON. IT DID NOT COME TO MAKE YOU A SINLESS PERSON. BUT WHAT IT DID, IT CAME TO REDEEM YOU AND RAISE UP THAT ON THE INSIDE THAT SAYS, "I ONLY WANT TO PLEASE GOD." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S THAT ON THE INSIDE THAT WILL CAUSE YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORD ABOVE YOUR OWN FEELINGS AND SAID, "THY WORD [screaming] IS RIGHT." [cheering] IT'S THAT ON THE INSIDE, LIKE THE PROPHET SAID, THAT WHEN YOU'VE DONE WRONG IN THE ADOPTION SERIES, HE SAID IT WOULDN'T MATTER IF YOU HAD TO STAND BEFORE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND SAY, "I'M [screaming] WRONG." YOU DO IT. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE RIGHT AND PLEASING WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT SERVING HIM UNDER THE THREAT OF A BROWN LOOKING DOWN AND AND THEN NO, THAT'S NOT HOW YOU'RE SERVING HIM. OH, I BETTER DO THIS IF I DON'T DO THIS. YOU'RE NOT SERVING HIM THAT WAY. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, that creates looseness. No. I think the meaning we're wanting to say here is it brings liberty to the sons of God. Looseness is lasciviousness &gt;&gt; WHERE THEY PREACH GRACE with no no change being produced. &gt;&gt; That's lasciviousness. &gt;&gt; That's loose religion. &gt;&gt; BUT THE REAL GRACE OF GOD COMES TO SAY YOU'RE NOT WORTHY. YOU CAN NEVER BE WORTHY. BUT I AM YOUR WORTHINESS. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU COULD EVER ATTAIN IT. BUT MY BLOOD HAS MADE A WAY. YOU WERE ALWAYS [screaming] MINE. AND THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES AS THE GRACE OF GOD TO LET YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT BELONGS TO YOU. THIS IS WHAT SATAN WANTED TO ROB FROM YOU. BUT YOU'RE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S HE DOING? Ministering liberty. [cheering] &gt;&gt; So it's a liberty to serve. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that liberty, as I mentioned, is it possible that liberty could be used or not used or used in the wrong way because just just stay with me now. Don't don't tune me out. Stay with me. Brother Brandham makes a statement because Paul's not the only one who makes a statement like this. Peter does. And I'll get to it in a minute. Paul, brother Brandham makes this statement and he lets us know. He says, "You're you're saved by God's grace." &gt;&gt; The things that you do, like he said, you're not saved by your clothes. &gt;&gt; That's not the end of the quote. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's not the end of that quote. HE'S LETTING US KNOW. HE SAID, "IF THAT WAS THE CASE, GOD HAS SENT DOWN some patterns." But you see what happens is you do in appreciation. &gt;&gt; Your works are not trying to merit. It's out of appreciation. &gt;&gt; So they're not it's not it's not it's not well, you know, it's got to be this. YOU DO IT OUT OF APPRECIATION. AND THAT'S WHY WE are saved by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No wonder, brother Bannon, when he preaches the message of grace, he said, "Oh, how the devil hates this message of grace." He said, "If there's one thing I've been gotten after so much, it's preaching grace." &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That's what this message is. Grace. Grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. UNTO A PEOPLE &gt;&gt; THAT GOD HAS COME DOWN TO SEAL OFF, TO CAP, AND TO DRAW UP INTO HIM IN ALL THINGS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "If I never preach another sermon in my life, live 150 years, I'm still saved." &gt;&gt; I'M SAVED BECAUSE IT'S GOD'S GRACE THAT SAVED ME. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Paul even talked about, you know, HOW EVEN HIMSELF PREACHING THE GOSPEL, he said, "I I don't have anything to glory. Necessity is laid upon me. Woe in me if I don't preach." &gt;&gt; But if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward if I do it willingly. &gt;&gt; Right? That's a key, &gt;&gt; if I do it willingly. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; PAUL COULD HAVE KEPT on running, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; A man can RUN AND RUN AND RUN FROM WHAT GOD IS CALLING HIM TO DO. AND GOD WILL ALLOW THE MAN TO RUN. YOU SAY, "WHY WOULD GOD DO THAT?" CUZ HE WANTS SUBMISSION, &gt;&gt; because you know why? Anything that God ask of you and I to do, it's got to be from the heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's good. So God allow this and allow that and this and this and this because he he's he's going TO GET IT TO A PLACE to where we we submit. And if Paul said if I do it willingly I have a reward but if I against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me. SO PAUL IS DOING it willingly to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Right? But Paul wasn't even consulted about whether a dispensation of the gospel would be laid on him. He wasn't consulted. Paul, how do you feel about going among the Gentiles? He wasn't consulted. Paul, how do you feel about being a light to the Gentiles? How do you feel, Paul? He wasn't consulted. &gt;&gt; This was a man who was a Pharisee of the Pharisees. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Okay. this wasn't THE HE WAS SERIOUS IN WHAT HE BELIEVED &gt;&gt; BUT GOD TOOK THAT AND CHANNELED IT AND PAUL WILLINGLY PREACHED THE GOSPEL BUT WHAT WAS HE DID NOT HE HE DIDN'T DESIRE THAT BURDEN to a dispensation of the gospel to be committed to him this is why that brother Brandham would pick this up over and over perfect strength in other places and it's very true when you see individuals vying for positions. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; That's a sign it's not fit for it. Because if you see that you're fit for it, you're actually unfit. &gt;&gt; That's why a person says, "Well, I could make a good this or I could make a good this." No. &gt;&gt; You You love them. You appreciate them, BUT THERE NEEDS BECAUSE WHY? IT'S GOT TO BE FROM THE HEART. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE FROM THE HEART WHERE A PERSON IS NOT RELYING UPON THEIR OWN ABILITY, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; EVEN AS GOD WILL TAKE A MINISTER that could be very young and very youthful AND SO FORTH. BUT GOD HAS TO TEMPER THAT MAN AND WORK WITH THAT MAN AND HE'LL WORK THROUGHOUT THE TIMES BRINGING HIM TO A PLACE OF CONTINUAL SUBMISSION. That's why brother Bram says God has a hard time using anyone that'll stay humble &gt;&gt; because you know why they get to looking at what's been done and fail to recognize you're no more than the wrench or the screwdriver. It's whose hand you're in &gt;&gt; and who has the ability behind it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, that's the key within every one of our lives. Even when IT COMES TO HUSBAND, WIFE, FATHER, MOTHER. YES, THOSE ATTRIBUTES ARE IN OUR LIFE, BUT BUT IT'S NOT MEANT FOR US TO TAKE THEM AND TRY TO TRY TO SOMEHOW MASTER THAT. BUT IT'S meant for us to yield ourselves into God's hands. &gt;&gt; You say, "What creates that yielding?" His love. &gt;&gt; The grace of God being projected. Right? &gt;&gt; If I do this willingly, Brother Ram says, you know, he says in the thinking man's filter, he said, I'd like to sit out there in the congregation and just listen to somebody else preach. How much easier it would be on me. Now, he makes this statement in thinking man's filter, paragraph 187, one, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five, five times. How easy it would be on me. It would be easier for me to do that. It would be easier for me to do that. IT WOULD BE EASIER FIVE TIMES BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE, YOU KNOW, we so appreciate the message that God has delivered to us, but think about everything that had to be done. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In order for you and I TO RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF THIS, &gt;&gt; it it he knew. REMEMBER WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM EVEN STANDING THERE PREACHING THE SEALS AND HE TURNS OFF think well where they think the one's been turned off but it keeps going somewhere I've been there and looked at where those recorders and how that would have been set up and you hear him he's turned it off but it ain't turned off and remember what he says I know I'll lose many of friends from this &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; is that right &gt;&gt; many many because of what BECAUSE OF WHAT THE TRUTH THAT HE WAS STANDING ON BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE THE MESSAGE IS NOT POPULAR &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE message is Christ. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD REVEALED. IT'S GOD NOW BROUGHT PRESENT TENSE. IT'S COMFORTABLE TO BELIEVE IN A JESUS 2,000 YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT'S EVEN COMFORTABLE TO BELIEVE IN A JESUS WHO CAN COME AND HEAL IN THE HOSPITAL. BUT NOW, LET'S BRING THAT JESUS CUZ THERE'S MORE ATTRIBUTES BESIDES JUST HEALER. LET'S BRING IT DOWN FOR WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT. AND THAT WAS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE LIFE ETERNAL AND TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THEN THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE, DO THEY REALLY WANT JESUS? &gt;&gt; Now listen, some they're not ordained. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you're not going to make anybody. &gt;&gt; So you that's not serving them either. &gt;&gt; What must I do? Shine the light in humility. wait for opportunities. Brother Brandman says it like this in here. He said, "If you love your wife, you want to do something for her." He said, "It's like a man that you see and you tell John, John, let's go fishing." Because he likes fishing. He said, "You talk to him about the weather, talk to him about THE FISH, AND THEN YOU WAIT, &gt;&gt; for God to open that door." &gt;&gt; I wish I had more time. &gt;&gt; You say you do next Thursday, &gt;&gt; but I got to wait till next Thursday. BUT WAITING FOR GOD TO OPEN THAT DOOR DOES NOT MEAN CALLING FOR THE SWAT TEAM. And let's get it down, boys. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you with liberty to serve, are you willing, if that man is open, that person is open, are you willing to labor with them &gt;&gt; and talk about fish? Sure. &gt;&gt; When you see their heart and building a relationship &gt;&gt; where their heart is becoming tender &gt;&gt; and just waiting on God and praying for him, don't be anxious. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to stop here tonight. &gt;&gt; I know, man. I didn't even get to where I was at. I know that's how I feel. And now I got to go to sleep on this. &gt;&gt; There's still that thought. Is it possible that as Paul wrote in Galatians 5, the liberty that we've been called to and the liberty that we have, is it possible that we could use liberty for an occasion to the flesh? To take the the genuine liberty of the Holy Spirit that God has given us in our hearts and use it for an occasion to Brother Brham said, "If I never preach again, I'm still saved. &gt;&gt; If I don't do nothing, I'm still going to make it. &gt;&gt; I don't have to put up with this. I don't have to. Is it possible that liberty could be used for an occasion to the flesh?" It's nice and quiet. I say, "God, mold me, Lord. Mold me. Shape me." Musicians come. Musicians come. Paul come. We want the Lord to continue to mold us and to shape us. And what a what a character that friends this message that God has revealed to you and I bringing us to a place that where we can see in the life of the prophet. I think as I've got a I've got a few different books at the house and then even it was TL Osborne. I've got the whole thing that T. Osborne, you would have access to it too. TL Osborne speaks at brother Brandham's memorial service and the statements that he makes when you read through it you would wonder it would seem as though TL Osborne seen it and yet he didn't see the message &gt;&gt; because you you realize where he end up going and even how TL Osborne just started to present those things you know brother got a little off here and there, but not in that memorial service. But in that memorial service, there's a statement that even that he makes that we had forgot what the Jesus of the Bible was like. And God came through the prophet through William Brham and helped us to remember to see what Jesus was like. &gt;&gt; It's not lifting up and and TL Osborne will go through there in all fairness. He said, "I'm not exalting the man." But he he just goes through all the things that he saw and the examples. And what I what what he covers within there. It's not just the miracles because I I I look at one part of the miracles, but the things that TL Osborne is even is even pointing out is what's what's very important is the character. &gt;&gt; This message, it's the character of Christ being revealed &gt;&gt; and producing a character in the bride. Remember in choosing of a bride, the prophet said, "What a man chooses for his future home tells what's in his heart." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And what is everything boils down to is character. And you know, remember brother Bram says regarding Rebecca, Brother Bram says it like this. He says, if he says, "If I can just get that bride to stand still, I can just find a character like Eleazar found Rebecca. A character that was willing to listen." &gt;&gt; Rebecca was willing to be dressed. She was willing to to listen. She was willing to submit. So, our character, remember, it's a victory, not a gift. Our character is being molded and shaped by the life that we have within us. And God is calling us. He's calling us higher. There's things that you you won't see or know about in your life as far as many times we can look and and and we say, "M, I'm pretty good right now. It seems like with patience or this or that." And God, it's not that we haven't come to a certain place, but you have to understand that you just don't come to a place even with patience. Well, I've got all this and I'm ready to move on to this. When the prophet says when he's dealing with that and he says, now don't try to add that. In other words, there's got to be a completion of our patience. &gt;&gt; And remember, brother Ram says, "And is your life worthy of the gospel 1963?" He says, you know, he says, "Your patience kind of starts out like this." I don't know how he looked, but I can just imagine. He said, "It starts out like this." He said, "Then it grows to this right here. Your patience grows, your faith grows, your love grows." That's all scriptural, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And how does it grow? Is it just something that just it just well overnight, man, I woke up and man, not only is there a Cherry Danish, but I've grown in love? No. It comes through dying. And so what Satan wants to point out and say, "You're not very far along. &gt;&gt; Look at this. You've not made this very much. You look at look at See, what Satan's trying to do is to get you looking at &gt;&gt; your weakness." &gt;&gt; And what God's trying to get you to do is surrender it. &gt;&gt; That is so &gt;&gt; And that's how that's that's how God is working in our life because there's a growing that's this is why the prophet as he said on the wings of a snow white dove, he's in prayer. I don't think anybody here would question the faith that was resting in the heart of the prophet. But one of the very last messages that he preaches before being taken home, he says, "Lord, you that came down right there in Sabino Canyon, what you've done, Lord, where those seven angels came, that sword, I saw that place, sword rock, where that sword came in my hand." He said, "This this this has led me to a faith I never had before." &gt;&gt; You see, led me, led me. This is why Brother Brian, Brother Brandham says in and uh I know you think I thought you was closing recognizing your day in this message. I love the prayer at the end. I just sang as it would come to me. Brother Bram at the very end of recognizing your day in this message, he said, "Oh, I wouldn't trade this sweet, sweet feeling for nothing." &gt;&gt; And then he begins to pray. He says, "God, creating me a revival." Notice, "Create in me a revival. &gt;&gt; Lord, create in me what's lacking in my life." 65. Lord, create in me. Lord, make there to create a hunger. Lord, &gt;&gt; create that thirst. Lord, make me to be more humbler, more willing. &gt;&gt; HE'S ASKING GOD TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU AND I CAN DO THAT. WE THIS IS WHERE WE COME TO IN OUR WALK WITH GOD TO REALIZE, YES, I AM A new creation, but what is to come forth of my life must be his life coming and energizing that word. It must be a create creation of the word &gt;&gt; because God won't share his glory with no one. So you and I step back AND SAY, "LORD, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID IT, BUT you've done it." &gt;&gt; I I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M STANDING HERE, BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; MY WILL, LORD GOD, EVEN YOUR GRACE THAT WAS GIVEN to me to submit my will to you, Lord. I DON'T KNOW HOW. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, BUT I KNOW YOU'VE DONE IT &gt;&gt; because I'm seeing the evidence, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I'm seeing the evidence as it's being even in my life and my heart. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? What grace &gt;&gt; what grace &gt;&gt; that God has given to us. A liberty. A liberty to walk in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we just stand? And Paul, you got something on your heart? You got a song? Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. Oh yes. Wonderful. Thank you, Lord. Oh, the more [singing] that I [music] surrender, the lighter [singing] [music] my Lord, the more that [singing] Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, just let it [music] be a prayer. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. with our hearts lifted up more [music and singing] &gt;&gt; that I can humble myself the more [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; and every day I live Lord [music and singing] I love you more that I surrender [music] oh the more that I surrender [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The lighter my [singing] love. &gt;&gt; Oh, the more that I [music] release my cares, [singing] the more he [music] &gt;&gt; he takes control. And the more that I humble [singing] myself, the more he lifts [music] me up. Oh, every day. [singing] [music] Oh, Lord, I love you [singing] more. Thank you, Jesus. Yes, my Lord. And [music] it gets [singing] easier to [music] understand this road that I'm traveling down. [music and singing] No more. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I'm standing [music] on solid [singing] ground and I know I'm [music] to my future [singing] home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music and singing] Every day I live, Lord, I love you more. [singing] Oh, more than [singing] I. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; The lighter my [singing] Lord. Oh, the more that [music] I release my king. &gt;&gt; It is the more [music and singing] that he takes control. The more that I can humble [singing and music] myself, the more you lift me up. &gt;&gt; So every day [music and singing] I live, Lord, I love you more. [singing] The problems I [music] have. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. [singing] &gt;&gt; All myings. Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; The higher [music and singing] grace the tri that see awome [music and singing] to me. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Now my victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And [music and singing] I know I'm headed. &gt;&gt; I'm headed. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And the voice I hear is [music and singing] yours every day that I live. Oh Lord, [singing] I love you. [music] Hallelujah. Oh, [singing] the more that I surrender. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. The lighter [singing] my love. &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] the more that [singing] I release my cares, the more he takes control. And the more that [singing] I can [music] humble myself, the more [singing] you lift me up. Every day I live. Lord, I love you more. [singing] &gt;&gt; Every day I live. &gt;&gt; Well, Lord, [music] I love you more. Oh, hallelujah. Would you do me a favor? Let's let's pray with one another. Maybe sister to sister, brother to brother. Got to move out of your seat. Let's just let's go to God in prayer. Let's pray for one another. Lending, can God borrow our hands? Borrow us just for a moment. Let's pray for that fellow brother or sister we have our hand upon. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, the needs among us, Lord, are &gt;&gt; they're so great, Lord. &gt;&gt; I know, Lord, beyond even the spoken request, we're a needy people. &gt;&gt; We're not ashamed to say that. And when we Lord declare that we believe that the throne of grace is made available to us that we might have obtain help in the time of need. Now Lord we need you Lord God. Father you see Father even the different needs upon our hearts. Even the things that Lord that you would be bringing each of us to in the molding and shaping of our character.

Lord, you know the need, the request, Lord. We've not come here to be seen. We've come here to have fellowship with you, Lord. We've come here, Lord, to be refreshed, to be encouraged, to be restrengthened in your presence, Lord. And we want to say thank you, Lord, for your mercies tonight.
