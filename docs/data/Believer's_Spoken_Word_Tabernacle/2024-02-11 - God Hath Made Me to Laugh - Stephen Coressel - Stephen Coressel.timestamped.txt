[8:22] the house even for tests scans or
[8:24] doctor's appointments our friend may be
[8:28] so bound that she refus refuses to leave

[8:54] for him amen how many believe that this
[8:57] morning uplifted hand and any unspoken
[9:00] prayer
[9:02] requests let's just all go together with
[9:04] our
[9:05] [Music]
[9:12] brother with that last prayer request
[9:16] just remind me that my uh something the
[9:19] Lord just dealt with me with just
[9:21] earlier this
[9:22] week um just kind of in prayer about
[9:25] some things you know and I was just
[9:27] asking the Lord why you know not um out
[9:30] of bitterness but just out of seeking
[9:32] understanding you know just we we all
[9:34] have that you know why why uh certain
[9:36] things happened and even um from
[9:39] childhood and on up uh and uh the Lord
[9:42] just kind of gave me a song you know um
[9:45] and it I I can't remember the song real
[9:48] well but it it says we'll talk it over
[9:51] in the buy and by we'll talk it over my
[9:53] Lord and I I'll ask the reason he'll
[9:56] tell me why we'll talk it over in the
[9:59] buy and by and just I'm so looking
[10:01] forward to that day just him and I just
[10:04] I can just imagine just a stroll
[10:06] together and and I can just ask him uh
[10:09] all the questions and then he just kept
[10:12] dealing with me a little bit about it
[10:13] and uh reminded me of Jesus on the cross
[10:16] said what's the the next the last thing
[10:18] he said he said my God my God why has
[10:21] Thou forsaken me and he just said I went
[10:24] to the cross with the question why on my
[10:26] heart and the scripture never tells us
[10:29] whether that question was ever answered
[10:30] on this side or not you know so
[10:32] sometimes we know why even sometimes
[10:35] beforehand sometimes afterwards we say
[10:37] oh that's why this happened
[10:39] and sometimes it might be that that that
[10:43] strug with Jesus before we actually know
[10:46] the reason why but he just said just
[10:48] don't feel guilty about asking why
[10:51] because that's that's a question that he
[10:54] he he knows deeply and and intimately so
[10:57] just oh that last prayer request just
[10:59] hit my heart and I just wanted to share
[11:01] that with with everybody we may not know
[11:03] why but don't ever let you know the
[11:05] devil bring fear and condemnation on you
[11:08] because you're asking he he knows and he
[11:11] understands that question very much
[11:13] so let's just go before him in prayer
[11:16] and just hold these needs on your heart
[11:19] and this before the Lord dear Lord Jesus
[11:23] we come before you in prayer Lord and
[11:25] it's just it's such an honor Lord to be
[11:28] able to approach you Lord but also to be
[11:30] able to bind Lord our face together Lord
[11:33] with each other's face just like brother
[11:35] Rocko had said just bind our face
[11:37] together for one that that Lord may be
[11:40] destitute and in a dark place right now
[11:42] Lord but that's why you came to shed the
[11:44] light is to drive away the darkness Lord
[11:46] and and allow us that are light Bears
[11:49] Lord to be able to shed light with for
[11:51] others Lord and we just I pray for Lord
[11:54] BL brother Rocco and this this uh a
[11:57] friend that has Lord that Lord is is
[11:59] actually in the dark place right now
[12:01] Lord we just pray for help and comfort
[12:03] and strength Lord and Lord I just pray
[12:05] for the courage and The Willow Lord to
[12:08] to press on Lord so you can come on the
[12:11] scene Lord and just help and heal that
[12:13] situation Lord and for brother Rocco and
[12:16] himself Lord just for strength and
[12:17] courage and as well and just for the
[12:19] opportunity Lord to let his light shine
[12:21] through him to onto this situation as
[12:24] well Lord and Lord the one that the
[12:26] father committed suicide and so Lord
[12:28] that just
[12:29] things that we can't un understand or or
[12:31] explain Lord but Lord you that's where
[12:34] we just cast our eyes to you and just

[41:04] the body of Christ amen every part of
[41:08] Christ is important
[41:09] amen I just feel like praising the Lord
[41:14] amen Genesis
[41:16] 21 Genesis 21 and we're going to read
[41:19] 1-7 Genesis 21 and verse1 and the Lord
[41:24] visited Sarah as he had said
[41:27] the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken
[41:29] for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a
[41:31] son in his old age at the set time of
[41:34] which God had spoken to him and Abraham
[41:37] called the name of his son that was born
[41:38] unto him whom Sarah be to him Isaac and
[41:42] Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being
[41:44] the eighth eight days old as God had
[41:47] commanded him and Abraham was a hundred
[41:49] years old when his son Isaac was born
[41:52] unto him and Sarah said God hath made me
[41:55] to laugh so that all that hear will
[41:59] laugh with me and she said who would
[42:02] have said unto Abraham that Sarah should
[42:04] have given child suck for I have borne
[42:07] him a son in his old age can we bow our
[42:10] heads for to
[42:11] prayer most gracious kind Heavenly
[42:13] Father Lord we thank you Lord for your
[42:14] grace and your mercy this morning Lord
[42:17] we thank you Lord God for your presence
[42:19] here Lord the children of God whom you
[42:21] have saved out of all Nations and
[42:23] tongues Lord have gathered together and
[42:25] according to to your word Lord they've
[42:27] gathered together to hear the preaching
[42:29] of your word amen so they're not tossed
[42:31] to and fro but they will be built up
[42:34] into the statue of a perfect man Lord
[42:37] God the the world may call this foolish
[42:39] but to them that believe this is the
[42:42] power of God and the wisdom of God so
[42:45] we're asking you Lord according to your
[42:46] word may you just continue to anoint
[42:49] this service Lord and speak only that
[42:51] which you you want to speak to each
[42:54] hearer Lord God if we got got to get off
[42:56] my notes and change the entire service
[42:59] Lord let us all be open to the moving of
[43:01] the Holy Spirit we're trusting that and
[43:04] believing Lord we want to commit this
[43:06] service into your hands for it is in
[43:09] your name the name of your son the Lord
[43:11] Jesus Christ we pray the church said
[43:13] together amen God bless you you may be
[43:18] seated you love the Lord God surely is
[43:21] good amen boy we're already taking the
[43:24] coat off amen must be warm in the Holy
[43:27] Ghost
[43:30] amen amen you love the
[43:32] Lord I want to preach a message called
[43:35] God hath made me to laugh God hath made
[43:38] me to
[43:40] laugh as we read in verse six there this
[43:42] is the promise that they've been waiting
[43:44] for for 25 years brother R would talk
[43:46] about about this promised son and now
[43:48] the promised son has shown up and this
[43:51] is the first thing that comes out of
[43:52] Sarah's mouth when she gave a child in
[43:55] her old age as as well was that God hath
[43:58] made me to laugh and then it says and
[44:02] and all that hear will laugh with me now
[44:06] see this is interesting what are they
[44:08] laughing about it's important to
[44:10] understand the point in which why is she
[44:12] laughing as a matter of fact Isaac's
[44:15] name means
[44:17] [Laughter]
[44:19] laughter so what so why is Sarah
[44:22] laughing well did God say a good joke
[44:26] you know was there something humorous
[44:28] that happened see it's important to
[44:30] understand why she's laughing here now
[44:32] before we get into it a little bit I
[44:34] want to express a principle that brother
[44:36] Ram taught us about this story so that
[44:38] we can take the story and relate it to
[44:40] ourselves okay about what this promised
[44:43] son meant amen I mean it's good that God
[44:46] gave a promised son to Abraham and Sarah
[44:49] but you could sit there and go okay
[44:50] that's great and I believe God can do
[44:52] that amen is it just a good testimony in
[44:55] the Bible no God actually did it for
[44:57] very specific reason to even teach us
[45:00] about a thing in our day so brother said
[45:03] in that first quote and Abraham and his
[45:05] seat after him brother Abraham says this
[45:07] he says and look what did he do he had
[45:09] to change Abraham and Sarah's body I'm
[45:12] going to tell you something I I thank
[45:14] God for the message of the
[45:17] hour people thought it was a literally
[45:19] 100y old man and a 90y old woman give
[45:22] him
[45:24] birth but then when brother breaks it
[45:26] down for a little bit and you go well
[45:28] and he goes God had to change their body
[45:31] you you almost look at and go yeah of
[45:34] course of course God had to have done
[45:37] that amen amen we would not have got
[45:39] that with prophetic guiding without
[45:41] prophetic eyesight amen listen there's
[45:44] theologians out there all the
[45:46] denominations they can't see this they
[45:48] thought it was a 90 year- old woman giv
[45:50] birth and they can't make understanding
[45:52] of it but when the prophet was able to
[45:54] look through the word and notice their
[45:56] body had to be changed it lined up with
[45:59] the rest of the word cuz what's going to
[46:01] happen to us eventually our bodies are
[46:04] going to be changed as
[46:06] well you see the pro this is not going
[46:09] see there's more to this story that
[46:11] God's trying to express to us than just
[46:14] oh that's a neat thing in the
[46:17] Bible you know an old couple having a
[46:19] kid amen watch he had to change Abraham
[46:23] and Sarah's body what's the next thing
[46:25] after the sign was shown that he know
[46:26] the secret of the heart the next thing
[46:28] was the change of the body in order to
[46:30] receive the promised son and that's
[46:33] what's next in line now is the rapture
[46:35] of the church the changing see he's
[46:38] typing the promised son to the Rapture
[46:41] that we're going to experience before we
[46:44] meet the promised son in the air our
[46:46] bodies have to be changed as well see
[46:49] there's more to that promised son than
[46:51] just a neat testimony God's trying to
[46:53] show us something that what Abraham and
[46:56] Sarah experien is the same thing we're
[46:59] going to
[47:02] experience ain't that's something oh my
[47:06] praise the Lord we're get into it don't
[47:07] worry listen we got to start in first
[47:09] gear first then you go into second year
[47:12] then third year
[47:13] okay that paragraph next paragraph in
[47:16] paragraph 225 and look what if he just
[47:19] turned them back to a young man and a
[47:21] woman like they were at the first time
[47:23] they couldn't have that baby anyhow
[47:26] because they lived together when there
[47:27] was a young man and a woman you see if
[47:29] he would have just reverted them back
[47:31] they still couldn't have a kid well
[47:33] because they didn't have the kid before
[47:36] so so what did he have to do he said he
[47:38] had to change their body in a different
[47:40] way in order to receive the sun their
[47:45] body had to be changed in another way to
[47:47] receive the sun I'm going tell you
[47:49] something you're not just going to
[47:50] revert it back to what you look like 18
[47:52] years if God just reverted you back to
[47:55] 18 years old you just keep growing again
[47:57] and eventually you would die of old age
[47:59] again he's not just going to revert you
[48:01] back to an older sin sinful condition
[48:04] he's changing something else about you
[48:06] what's he doing he's taking sin out even
[48:09] out of your bodies
[48:11] [Applause]
[48:14] amen amen listen think about it for a
[48:18] second why don't we live forever right
[48:19] now I mean think about it for a second
[48:21] when you go eat an apple right it puts
[48:24] energy in your body well if it puts
[48:26] energy in your body your body should be
[48:27] able to keep going but those apples
[48:29] don't do the same thing they did 20
[48:31] years ago do
[48:33] they amen you're still for some reason
[48:36] even though you're putting the same
[48:37] energy in your body and the same amount
[48:39] so forth some of us a little more than
[48:41] others that's that's my problem amen but
[48:44] what I'm saying is is you're doing the
[48:46] same thing when you were a young kid and
[48:47] you were growing them but for some
[48:49] reason now when you do it you're
[48:51] eventually now dying and you're getting
[48:53] older and grayer what happened what's
[48:56] the difference it is a not a natural
[48:58] reason there's sin you were constructed
[49:01] in sin and sin has to die so he can't
[49:04] just revert you back to an old thing he
[49:07] has to change your literal body and burn
[49:10] all the sin
[49:12] out in order for you to receive the
[49:15] promised
[49:16] son Abraham and Sarah not only did God
[49:19] had him break them younger again he had
[49:21] to heal their bodies and change them
[49:23] from the what they were before in order
[49:26] to receive the promised son you see this
[49:29] story is applying to us a lot more than
[49:32] we
[49:33] realize amen when it just like us our
[49:37] bodies have to be changed in a different
[49:39] way so that when we meet the we can go
[49:42] and meet the sun in the air then we
[49:44] can't meet the sun like
[49:46] this we can't meet the Suns like this
[49:49] but he's going to change your
[49:51] body in a different way so you could
[49:55] read seeed the son now watch this so we
[49:58] see Abraham and Sarah were in the same
[50:01] situation we are and when Sarah finally
[50:04] received the promised son what did she
[50:07] say God hath made me to
[50:12] laugh so what's she laughing about
[50:15] what's she laughing about what's causing
[50:17] her to laugh and I think that's a good
[50:20] question and so I think we're going to
[50:22] follow Sarah a little bit here I hope
[50:24] you want to come with me amen because
[50:26] when we look at the story of Abraham and
[50:28] Sarah we do focus a lot on Abraham and
[50:31] that's good and we love the Lord but I
[50:33] think sometimes we forget about Sarah's
[50:35] walking in these same steps as
[50:37] well amen matter of fact God technically
[50:41] and I the the Bible doesn't necessarily
[50:43] declare this but as far as the Bible is
[50:45] concerned there's only one time God ever
[50:47] speaks to Sarah so when she's hearing
[50:50] about this promised son coming and she's
[50:52] hearing about these promises she's
[50:54] hearing it from Abraham
[50:56] amen and yet she still believed you
[51:00] remember this Sarah believed with
[51:02] Abraham as well here let's go to the
[51:05] first scripture I want to read some of
[51:06] these scriptures with you if you don't
[51:07] mind in 1 Peter 21 to I'm sorry it's
[51:11] first Peter 3 1-6 likewise you wives be
[51:14] in subjection to your own husbands that
[51:16] if any obey not the word they also May
[51:19] without the word be won by the
[51:20] conversation of the wives you're that
[51:22] strong
[51:23] wives sometimes wives think they're
[51:25] they're insignificant do you know you
[51:27] can save unbelieving
[51:29] people just said it right there amen
[51:33] some see sometime oh well oh I didn't I
[51:35] I was trying to avoid the whole wives
[51:37] and husband thing but now we
[51:40] can't because the world makes an
[51:42] impression on when a wife obeys her
[51:44] husband that it's a prison
[51:46] now that that it's going to hurt her and
[51:50] make her less of a person yet When God
[51:53] says the wife obeys the husband God says
[51:56] that wife can save her husband by simply
[52:00] doing what God called her to
[52:02] do
[52:05] Hallelujah see you remember something we
[52:07] don't care what the world has to say
[52:09] about it glory to God we don't care
[52:12] their opinion about
[52:14] it we don't even care about our own
[52:16] opinion the Bible says let every man's
[52:18] word be Al liive and my word be
[52:23] true and yet now we're finding out
[52:25] there's plenty of women out there and
[52:26] they've done studies women are more
[52:27] depressed than ever I wonder
[52:30] why cuz they're going contrary to the
[52:33] word it's not a prison it's salvation
[52:36] not only to you but to your family as
[52:38] well amen hallelujah your wives are a
[52:42] lot more important than you think
[52:44] sometimes what did Brother Bram call you
[52:46] called you the Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark
[52:49] Luke John
[52:53] mothers you're a lot more important than
[52:55] and you realize you just got to do it
[52:57] the way God called us to do it here
[52:59] let's keep reading while they behold
[53:01] your Chase conversation coupled with
[53:03] fear whose adorning let it not be the
[53:06] outward adorning a plating of the hair
[53:08] and a wearing of gold or a putting on of
[53:10] a Peril but let it be the hidden man of
[53:13] the heart thought we're talking about a
[53:14] woman here and yet there's a hidden man
[53:17] in you still who is that that's Christ
[53:21] amen glory it's Christ Christ in you and
[53:25] this is how you're expressing Christ to
[53:27] the world remember a real woman of God
[53:31] preaches a thousand times more than even
[53:33] me
[53:34] amen they're way better at it than me
[53:36] too they just have to walk in the
[53:40] store they don't have to say a single
[53:42] word but a real woman can walk into a
[53:45] store and preach to every single person
[53:47] in that
[53:48] store they don't even have to open their
[53:51] mouth I got to at least say something
[53:54] you know what I mean in I got to say hi
[53:56] by the way I'm a Christian do you got
[53:58] Jesus I got to wear a shirt that says
[54:00] who fool are you right I got to wear
[54:03] shirts that talk and things like that a
[54:06] real woman of God can speak more words
[54:09] than I can uh uh testimony me and car
[54:11] used to work at a solder warw workking
[54:12] plant and she would go in their skirt
[54:14] and things like that I did multiple
[54:15] Bible studies for people because they
[54:17] thought she was
[54:19] Amish they would come up to her and say
[54:21] are you Amish or something no I just
[54:23] believe God if you want no more ask my
[54:26] husband and I had multiple Bible studies
[54:28] with people because she was preaching
[54:30] more than me you see what I'm saying see
[54:33] the world says this kind of preacher
[54:36] puts women in prisons but the word says
[54:39] amen it's freedom and salvation to not
[54:42] only you but to your family to those
[54:45] that see you as
[54:49] well amen I say we change the script
[54:53] amen change the script forget what the
[54:56] world says about
[54:59] it they just want them die in their own
[55:01] lust and so forth like that that's stuff
[55:03] is nothing but death out
[55:05] there don't you dare let that like he
[55:07] said like let the ornament be of of the
[55:10] Hidden man of the heart let it not be on
[55:12] the outward
[55:14] appearance amen it's just a lie of the
[55:18] devil amen you already look pretty as it
[55:20] is just ask your
[55:22] husband amen
[55:25] listen I'm well I'm going to be real
[55:27] with you hopefully this doesn't sound
[55:29] too much of a joke but it is kind of
[55:30] funny okay if every woman in the world
[55:33] stopped wearing makeup
[55:35] tomorrow men would still be talking to
[55:37] women right
[55:40] y makeup is not for men and I know
[55:43] people think like that and the only men
[55:45] they're worth they're not even men
[55:46] they're
[55:47] dogs if if a man wants a woman to look
[55:50] like that and things like that he ain't
[55:51] no man he might be a beast as brother br
[55:55] called him but he's not a real man and
[55:57] you don't want that kind of stuff
[55:59] anyways amen you need to present
[56:01] yourself in what you want to attract yep
[56:05] amen amen if you're not in business
[56:07] don't
[56:08] advertise you know what I mean like like
[56:11] that's what that world offers that's
[56:14] what it's doing to them and yet they
[56:16] think it's for looking prety and stuff
[56:18] like that you don't look any
[56:20] pretty remember it's not how the world
[56:23] thinks of it this says this
[56:27] amen amen but let it be the hidden man
[56:29] in the heart in that which is not
[56:31] corruptible even the ornament of a Meek
[56:34] and quiet Spirit which is in the sight
[56:37] of God of great price maybe not in the
[56:41] sight of the world but in the sight of
[56:44] God that's a real queen that's a real
[56:49] princess we don't need no Disney
[56:51] Princesses amen remember we're going to
[56:54] read a little bit but Sarah means
[56:55] princess amen oo that's pretty good amen
[56:58] the world offer us all these other
[57:00] princesses with earrings and gold and
[57:02] things but God's going to show us a real
[57:04] princess right here first Peter
[57:07] 3 cool glory to God and hallelujah
[57:12] amen yeah Disney ain't got nothing on
[57:14] the word
[57:17] amen amen that was free okay amen I
[57:21] really like that actually I was in the
[57:24] back office howan princess into this
[57:27] just found it
[57:28] amen
[57:31] hallelujah verse five for after this
[57:33] manner in the old time the holy women
[57:35] also who trusted in God adored
[57:38] themselves be in subjection to their own
[57:40] husbands verse six even as Sarah obeyed
[57:45] Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters
[57:49] ye are as long as you do well and not
[57:51] afraid with amazement or with fear
[57:54] that's what that word means so see what
[57:57] did we just describe there is how Sarah
[57:59] acted with
[58:01] Abraham she wasn't dressing up and
[58:03] trying to look pretty for everybody else
[58:06] she believed her own husband she
[58:08] believed her husband so much when they
[58:11] when he backslid and called Sarah his
[58:13] sister she didn't open her
[58:15] mouth whoa
[58:18] heyo you ever think about that story you
[58:21] ever think about that remember CU
[58:22] Abraham's going to do it twice now
[58:25] Abraham's goingon to do it
[58:27] twice and you ever wonder about that
[58:29] brother
[58:30] Bill she's like what are you talking
[58:33] about
[58:34] Abraham I'm not just your sister I'm
[58:37] also your wife and yet you're selling me
[58:40] to another guy right now she didn't open
[58:42] her mouth
[58:43] once you see how Paul is able to say
[58:46] this in the word how Sarah obeyed her
[58:49] husband in the Lord even calling him
[58:51] Lord amen she believed D what Abraham
[58:56] said amen she believed of a promised son
[59:01] she believed this amen remember we're
[59:04] talking about how she's going to start
[59:06] laughing here amen ver uh Hebrews 11:1
[59:10] through faith also Sarah herself
[59:13] received strength to conceive seed and
[59:16] was delivered of a child when she was
[59:18] past age because she judged him faithful
[59:21] Lord who had promised Lord remember
[59:24] Sarah believed the word amen she
[59:27] believed what Abraham said she believed
[59:30] something was going to happen amen now
[59:33] we're going to go to Genesis 16 here
[59:35] because remember she knows what that
[59:38] this is the word she knows she's going
[59:39] to have a son amen but sometimes those
[59:44] promises can be kind of hard to
[59:47] believe especially in certain
[59:48] circumstances and so forth amen so
[59:52] remember this Sarah believes what God
[59:55] told Abraham so we go to Genesis 16
[59:59] verse1 now this is before she even got
[1:00:01] her name changed as well now Sarah
[1:00:03] Abraham's wife bear him no children and
[1:00:06] she had a handmade an Egyptian whose
[1:00:09] name was Hagar now remember she has the
[1:00:11] word she believes it she believes what
[1:00:14] her husband said she obeys her husband
[1:00:16] she doesn't Adorn herself she's holy and
[1:00:18] chased amen coupled with fear as we just
[1:00:22] read amen and so she's looking at the
[1:00:26] word and she's like I can't have
[1:00:28] children though but there's a law in the
[1:00:32] land that allows a wife to offer her
[1:00:35] handmade and then she could receive
[1:00:37] children through her that so she's
[1:00:41] trying to understand the promise and she
[1:00:43] comes up with a way to fulfill it amen
[1:00:47] she comes up with a way to there's a law
[1:00:49] in the land I hope you're hearing me now
[1:00:52] there's a certain thing that you're
[1:00:54] allowed to do that goes oh maybe that's
[1:00:57] what God meant amen maybe that's what
[1:01:00] God meant so we can do it like this
[1:01:02] verse two and Sarah said unto Abram
[1:01:04] behold now the handmade the Lord hath
[1:01:06] restrained me from bearing I pray thee
[1:01:08] go into my maid and maybe that I may
[1:01:10] obtain children by her why is she doing
[1:01:13] this she's doing it because she believes
[1:01:17] but yet she's trying to understand and
[1:01:20] fulfill it you ever been
[1:01:22] there you ever been there amen when
[1:01:25] you're trying to understand and believe
[1:01:27] something and you're going yeah okay I
[1:01:28] believe it but then your mind starts
[1:01:30] traveling a little bit and and then you
[1:01:32] go but how could it possibly happen how
[1:01:36] could the Rapture happen listen I I
[1:01:39] really get straight here don't
[1:01:41] I I almost get scared of myself
[1:01:45] amen but I actually believe that's why
[1:01:48] some people who have mistaken us being
[1:01:49] in the Millennium that's why they're
[1:01:51] doing this they're trying to understand
[1:01:54] certain quotes of the way brother B
[1:01:56] would say things and so then they're
[1:01:58] going well then maybe it's already
[1:02:00] fulfilled maybe it's like this or like
[1:02:02] that amen that's why they get caught up
[1:02:05] in those things is because they're
[1:02:08] trying to interpret it but brother B
[1:02:11] said God don't need any help
[1:02:13] interpreting his
[1:02:16] word God don't need no help he can do it
[1:02:18] himself he's big enough to interpret his
[1:02:20] own word
[1:02:23] hallelujah but you see so you see
[1:02:25] remember we're typing Sarah with us now
[1:02:28] you see how she can get caught up she
[1:02:30] believes she's a good wife amen she
[1:02:34] called Abraham her Lord things like that
[1:02:36] and she's trying to figure out the word
[1:02:40] right so verse three oh and Abraham
[1:02:43] hearkened to the voice of Sarah verse
[1:02:44] three and Sarah Abraham's wife took
[1:02:46] Hagar who made the Egyptian after
[1:02:48] Abraham D 12 years in land Canon and
[1:02:49] gave her to husband Abram to be his wife
[1:02:53] and when he went in onto Hagar and she
[1:02:55] conceived and and when she saw that she
[1:02:58] had conceived she had a jubilee cuz the
[1:03:01] word's
[1:03:03] fulfilled that's what she was trying to
[1:03:05] do she was trying to fulfill the word
[1:03:07] but then when the child showed
[1:03:10] up her mistress was despised in her
[1:03:15] eyes well what's going on remember she
[1:03:17] had the hidden man in the heart the word
[1:03:21] knew that wasn't the word right there
[1:03:24] glory to God this is how every
[1:03:26] denomination starts in case you're
[1:03:29] wondering this is do denominationalism
[1:03:32] 101 right up here amen they think
[1:03:34] they're coming up with a good plan they
[1:03:36] think yes this is a great program this
[1:03:38] is how it's going to work and then we
[1:03:40] come to find out it was
[1:03:43] death true that even Sarah looked at it
[1:03:46] and said nope that's not
[1:03:49] it we're gonna skip just to save some
[1:03:52] time but we find out that she even kind
[1:03:55] of blames Abraham for
[1:03:57] it you know what let's read it let's
[1:03:59] read it you didn't believe me there for
[1:04:00] a second so let's read it here real
[1:04:02] quick it's in verse five and Sarah said
[1:04:05] unto Abram my wrong be upon
[1:04:09] thee
[1:04:12] whoa I have given my mate into thy bosom
[1:04:15] and when she saw that she had conceived
[1:04:17] I Des I was despise In Her Eyes the Lord
[1:04:19] should judge between me and
[1:04:21] thee it wasn't the word it wasn't the
[1:04:25] word she was standing there and this was
[1:04:28] her big
[1:04:29] plan and had to come to find out it
[1:04:31] wasn't it matter of fact we know who she
[1:04:33] had it was
[1:04:34] ishmail and we go down to First vers to
[1:04:37] Genesis 16:12 the Bible says about
[1:04:39] ishmail and he will be a wild man his
[1:04:43] hand will be against every man and every
[1:04:45] man's hand against him and he shall
[1:04:47] dwell in the presence of all his
[1:04:49] Brethren do you know that this problem
[1:04:52] of Ishmael still exists
[1:04:56] today did you know that this problem of
[1:05:01] ishmail Amen matter of fact we'll read
[1:05:03] it a little bit later in Galatians 4
[1:05:04] ishmael's type is the natural seed and
[1:05:07] Isaac's types is the spiritual seed and
[1:05:09] Paul says that as the natural persecuted
[1:05:12] the spiritual so it is
[1:05:14] today this natural seed which persecutes
[1:05:18] the spiritual seed started right here
[1:05:21] and guess what it still ain't over
[1:05:25] it still happens to Israel today it
[1:05:29] literally started a couple months ago
[1:05:31] again didn't
[1:05:33] it you look at the thorn in Israel's
[1:05:35] side and who was it it's still
[1:05:40] ishmail you want to talk about
[1:05:41] vindication of the word you can't make
[1:05:43] that up you know what I mean you can't
[1:05:45] just sit here and you know people like
[1:05:47] to accuse the Bibles written by man and
[1:05:49] things like that and and it's like man
[1:05:51] how do you write a better thing than
[1:05:52] that then he said he's going to be a
[1:05:55] wild man and his hand will be against
[1:05:57] everybody natural persecutes the
[1:05:59] spiritual and we come to find out it's
[1:06:02] still happening today you can turn on
[1:06:05] Fox News and find out you can turn on
[1:06:08] CNN and they're quoting the
[1:06:11] word see everything this has to be
[1:06:14] fulfilled there's nothing in this which
[1:06:17] won't be fulfilled it has to be
[1:06:20] fulfilled even the world don't even see
[1:06:22] it sometimes
[1:06:24] remember even uh the high priest even
[1:06:26] says shall one man die to save the whole
[1:06:29] country he didn't realize he was
[1:06:30] prophesying the whole time do you even
[1:06:32] know and we come to find out yeah it
[1:06:34] took one man to die to save the whole
[1:06:35] world Amen
[1:06:37] Hallelujah you see they don't even know
[1:06:39] what they're doing and yet they don't
[1:06:40] realize when they putting that stuff on
[1:06:42] the uh uh uh on the news and things like
[1:06:44] that they're just proving God was right
[1:06:45] the whole
[1:06:46] time and you come to wonder why Jewish
[1:06:49] people are starting to get more hated
[1:06:50] and hated in this day than ever before
[1:06:52] why it's the word being fulfilled
[1:06:55] every nation's going to be against them
[1:06:56] so the Bible says amen see it's just
[1:06:58] happening right before our eyes and look
[1:07:01] where it started it started when
[1:07:03] somebody tried to figure out the
[1:07:06] promise when somebody was trying to
[1:07:09] figure out the promise of God that's
[1:07:12] when it started all the problems I hope
[1:07:15] you're hearing me what's going to what
[1:07:16] happens with our problem sometimes it's
[1:07:18] because a lot of times it's because we
[1:07:20] try to figure it
[1:07:22] out it may not just be a prise you're
[1:07:24] just trying to figure out different
[1:07:25] aspects of your life and and you sit
[1:07:26] there and you contemplate and you go
[1:07:28] well if I did this and that means I'd be
[1:07:29] a better Christian right you ever do
[1:07:31] that mind battle with yourself sometimes
[1:07:33] when you make a mistake and you go well
[1:07:35] the reason why I made that mistake is
[1:07:36] because I did this and this so then
[1:07:38] therefore if I take that part out I
[1:07:39] won't make the mistake again you take
[1:07:41] that part out and what happened you made
[1:07:42] the mistake again
[1:07:44] anyways you know why that happens to you
[1:07:47] sometimes I'll tell you why cuz God
[1:07:48] allowed it
[1:07:50] yeah you know why God allowed it to
[1:07:52] prove to you that you're figuring out
[1:07:54] don't
[1:07:59] work you can have the best will lay PLS
[1:08:02] and they all Fall to Pieces amen but let
[1:08:05] God show up one time and he'll settle it
[1:08:07] all
[1:08:09] [Applause]
[1:08:12] amen I got so many testimonies of
[1:08:15] that
[1:08:17] amen when I would sit there and read a
[1:08:19] certain scripture and I'd sit there and
[1:08:21] go what does this scripture mean and I
[1:08:23] would struggle and struggle and think
[1:08:26] and think and study and study and read
[1:08:28] and
[1:08:30] read I remember one time I was studying
[1:08:32] about Phineas and I don't mean to go on
[1:08:33] this thing I'm just trying to prove a
[1:08:34] point here I won't get in the point
[1:08:36] maybe I'll bring it later maybe that
[1:08:38] maybe they'll have Sam you invite me
[1:08:39] again who
[1:08:41] knows put a little plug in you
[1:08:44] know I'm I'm G to get in trouble in here
[1:08:46] one of these days
[1:08:49] God one day I was really struggling
[1:08:51] about the story of Phineas it made no
[1:08:52] sense to me I didn't understand
[1:08:54] understand it him stabbing that girl and
[1:08:55] so forth like that just none of it made
[1:08:57] sense to me amen and and and and I got
[1:09:01] to pray about it thinking about it I
[1:09:03] found out his his name means mouth of
[1:09:05] brass or mouth of serpent that's what it
[1:09:07] meant and I was okay that's great who
[1:09:10] cares you know it didn't make any sense
[1:09:12] to me and I kept praying and praying I
[1:09:15] studied I read I looked at all things
[1:09:18] and then I finally realized and said you
[1:09:20] know what I don't think I prayed one
[1:09:22] minute about this
[1:09:23] [Laughter]
[1:09:28] so I got down on my knees and I said God
[1:09:31] I do not understand what this story
[1:09:33] means I don't understand what's going on
[1:09:35] here what's going on with fans I don't
[1:09:37] get it why did he stab that girl and so
[1:09:39] forth that why was why did it make him
[1:09:41] become a priest after an Everlasting
[1:09:44] Covenant and then all God spoke to me
[1:09:47] and he said the mouth of the brass
[1:09:50] Serpent and I went what huh and all a
[1:09:53] sudden I said maybe I should read about
[1:09:55] the brass serpent come to find out it's
[1:09:56] eight chapters before Phineas showed up
[1:09:59] and so God brought the brass serpent as
[1:10:01] a sacrifice but then when it came to
[1:10:03] cleanse Israel again of sin you didn't
[1:10:05] need another brass serpent the brass
[1:10:07] serpent now had a mouth and his believer
[1:10:10] named Phineas and so there was no more
[1:10:12] sticking up more brass serpents now the
[1:10:15] brass serpent had a Voice Hallelujah and
[1:10:17] Jesus Christ died on the cross amen but
[1:10:20] we don't need another Jesus Christ to
[1:10:21] come again amen
[1:10:24] where is the word the Bible says the
[1:10:25] word is nigh even in thy
[1:10:29] mouth and you go amen and you can say
[1:10:32] yes that's the word did you know that
[1:10:34] took no figuring out on my part I sat
[1:10:37] there for hours trying to figure it out
[1:10:39] got on my knees and God did it five
[1:10:41] minutes more than I could do in a whole
[1:10:44] day
[1:10:48] amenl and if God does that just for
[1:10:50] those little questions you have of the
[1:10:51] word what makes you think anything part
[1:10:53] of your life's going to be any better am
[1:10:56] than just letting go and let God have
[1:10:58] his
[1:10:59] way the Bible says they that wait upon
[1:11:02] the Lord shall renew their strength
[1:11:06] listen I'm I'm going to tell you why
[1:11:07] you're getting hurried hurry hurried all
[1:11:08] the time it's because this is what the
[1:11:10] world pushes out

[1:11:14] if you will y amen sometimes people get
[1:11:17] accused of being lazy because they're
[1:11:19] not doing anything and it's like well
[1:11:21] you do know the Bible says you're
[1:11:22] supposed to wait so
[1:11:24] sometimes amen sometimes you ought to
[1:11:26] wait and listen yeah did you ever do a
[1:11:28] prayer I want I encourage you about
[1:11:30] something why don't you try this do a

[1:12:26] Thunderbolts to come out here why would

[1:12:31] glory to God hallelujah why don't you go
[1:12:34] pray and next time you pray just be
[1:12:36] quiet for a second and allow God to
[1:12:39] speak to you you remember when Elijah
[1:12:41] was going through his trial when he
[1:12:43] thought 7,000 uh he thought he was the
[1:12:46] only believer left in the church and he
[1:12:49] was struggling amen what happened there
[1:12:51] was a big earthquake but God wasn't in
[1:12:54] the
[1:12:55] earthquake there was a big fire god was
[1:12:57] in the fire there was a big wind but God
[1:12:59] wasn't there but a still Small Voice
[1:13:01] showed
[1:13:03] up
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:06] Hallelujah and what did that voice say
[1:13:08] there's 7,000 that haven't bowed the
[1:13:10] knee to bail amen he wasn't the only one
[1:13:14] Hallelujah and God was able to deliver
[1:13:17] encouragement to his Prophet because he
[1:13:19] stopped listening to all the Ruckus on
[1:13:22] the outside and listen to the still
[1:13:25] Small
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:27] Voice you remember that remember how
[1:13:29] Joseph even came about the testimony
[1:13:31] brother Braham with Joseph how you found
[1:13:33] out he was going to have a son he was in
[1:13:35] prayer one time and he said it wasn't a
[1:13:37] voice if anybody heard the voice of God
[1:13:38] it was brother BR and he he said this
[1:13:41] time it wasn't like that he said he had
[1:13:44] a voice in his heart speak that say
[1:13:46] you're going to have a son and his name
[1:13:48] is
[1:13:50] Joseph and then yet Bea goes to have a
[1:13:52] child and a girl remember they joked
[1:13:55] around about him oh is it Josephine see
[1:13:58] that would have been the human brain
[1:13:59] trying to figure it out but he said nuh
[1:14:01] he said it's a son and he stayed on it m
[1:14:06] gets has another child the girl
[1:14:09] again uh brother B you sure that was
[1:14:12] right remember he was never a voice but
[1:14:13] it was a still SW voice in his heart but
[1:14:15] it was just as much the word that's what
[1:14:18] you read here remember if what's the
[1:14:20] word God spoke it God spoke it so it's
[1:14:23] the same thing as the word and the Word
[1:14:26] was speaking and said you're going to
[1:14:27] have a
[1:14:28] son the doctor even tried to get him to
[1:14:32] uh stop me from having kids say you
[1:14:34] can't have that woman have a child he
[1:14:36] said sorry can't do it God said I'm
[1:14:39] having a
[1:14:41] son and all of a sudden he asked a son
[1:14:43] he said Joseph it took your time to get
[1:14:46] here but he showed up amen that's a
[1:14:49] great testimony isn't it praise the Lord
[1:14:52] that that he was able to believe the
[1:14:53] word and hold on to it Hallelujah I said
[1:14:56] praise the lord we ought to act like
[1:14:57] that but where did that word come from a
[1:15:01] still Small Voice in his heart it came
[1:15:04] from the hidden man in the heart and he
[1:15:08] held on to that promise I'm going to
[1:15:10] tell you something I hope you're
[1:15:11] encouraged today the same thing can
[1:15:13] happen to
[1:15:16] you you can have a promise just like
[1:15:18] that given to you what are you going to
[1:15:20] do with it amen
[1:15:24] you say oh it's impossible yeah I bet
[1:15:26] Abraham and Sarah said the same
[1:15:28] thing matter of fact we're going to find
[1:15:30] out she struggled with that she did
[1:15:33] struggle with how impossible it is
[1:15:36] because we found out so she she caused
[1:15:37] Ismael to come about amen became a wild
[1:15:40] man all sudden Hagar and Sarah hate each
[1:15:43] other now they're despising each other
[1:15:45] and so forth Calla a Ruckus In the
[1:15:47] church o Preacher Brother
[1:15:50] Stephen why it's when people start
[1:15:52] trying to figure things out
[1:15:55] yeah when you start trying to figure out
[1:15:57] and put man's intelligence in it and
[1:15:58] man's thinking in it that's where you
[1:16:00] get in
[1:16:02] trouble but look at Sarah here now this
[1:16:05] does seem
[1:16:06] impossible and we're g to go to uh
[1:16:08] Genesis 18 verse 9 here I want to show
[1:16:10] you something here because this is the
[1:16:12] part of story remember the three men
[1:16:13] came was it no
[1:16:16] Trinity three men came but Abraham said
[1:16:18] my Lord no s showing what he knew there
[1:16:22] was God wasn't three people amen I love
[1:16:25] that I love sneaking that in a little
[1:16:27] bit amen give that to your trinitarian
[1:16:29] friend next time say well Abraham didn't
[1:16:31] believe it and he had three people
[1:16:33] walking up to him with just just made
[1:16:36] bodies right there right amen remember
[1:16:38] brother R taught us God just came out
[1:16:40] and bring up some dirt it wasn't like
[1:16:41] the same birth as Jesus who came through
[1:16:42] a woman came under the law but this body
[1:16:45] was just there was a body and then he
[1:16:47] stepped right into it and there was uh
[1:16:49] two bodies for the angels as well and
[1:16:52] when Abraham saw three people walking up
[1:16:54] he didn't come up with the Trinity
[1:16:56] Doctrine did
[1:16:57] he he said my Lord he saw there and
[1:17:02] there a no way there's three people
[1:17:03] there God's only one person there might
[1:17:06] be angels I may not be able to explain
[1:17:08] everything but I know there's one Lord
[1:17:12] One Faith one baptism
[1:17:15] amen yeah you take that put in your
[1:17:17] pocket next time you have a Baptist talk
[1:17:19] to you all
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:23] but watch this here because we know then
[1:17:25] that this is when Abraham is going to
[1:17:28] receive the promise matter of fact God's
[1:17:31] going to say according to the time of
[1:17:32] life I'm going to visit you and brother
[1:17:35] R said that's the natural cycle for a
[1:17:37] woman amen so that's when so it's going
[1:17:39] to be in about a space of a month he
[1:17:41] said here it's coming here's the promise
[1:17:44] it's coming Hallelujah didn't explain it
[1:17:46] to him he said according to the time of
[1:17:48] life I'm going to visit
[1:17:49] you
[1:17:51] amen Genesis 18 :9 they said unto him
[1:17:54] where is Sarah thy wife and he said be
[1:17:57] be behold in the tent and he said I will
[1:18:00] certainly return unto thee according to
[1:18:02] the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife
[1:18:06] shall have a son remember before this
[1:18:09] they even thought it was ishmail because
[1:18:12] God comes after ishmael's mour God comes
[1:18:14] to Abraham and said you're going to have
[1:18:16] a seed you're going to have a seed and
[1:18:18] Abraham sits there I'm dramatized a
[1:18:20] little bit so give me some Liberty amen
[1:18:22] he he just he says he says Lord oh that
[1:18:25] Ishmael live before thee he said it's
[1:18:27] not
[1:18:30] ishmail it's not him amen it's coming
[1:18:33] through Sarah it's going to be your
[1:18:35] child and his name's Isaac
[1:18:39] Hallelujah I like that oh we think it's
[1:18:42] Ishmael they came up with all their
[1:18:43] Theology and all their doctrines and all
[1:18:45] their thinking they said yep here's the
[1:18:47] son his name is ishmail by the way God
[1:18:49] he said what you talking about that's
[1:18:50] that's not your son's seed's name right
[1:18:52] amen man God's plan was different than
[1:18:54] their plan who that happens to us
[1:18:56] sometimes too sometimes your plan ain't
[1:18:58] God's
[1:18:59] plan so what are you talking about
[1:19:01] you're see his name Ishmael it's
[1:19:04] Isaac you remember something about this
[1:19:06] story what's the difference between
[1:19:08] ishmail and Isaac in ishmael's birth
[1:19:10] there's not one Supernatural event that
[1:19:13] happens there's absolutely nothing
[1:19:15] Supernatural about
[1:19:17] ishmail but Isaac's going to have a
[1:19:19] whole bunch of
[1:19:21] it amen Isaac is going to have a
[1:19:24] supernatural birth not a church birth
[1:19:27] not just a church
[1:19:29] conversion amen just coming to church
[1:19:31] and just having a normal Church
[1:19:32] experience and thinking that's going to
[1:19:34] get you into heaven it ain't that's
[1:19:36] right and we believe in coming to church
[1:19:39] but just because you come to church and
[1:19:40] pay your tie don't mean you make
[1:19:41] it and you ought to do that just so you
[1:19:44] know you ought to be doing that stuff
[1:19:47] but that's there's no stuff nothing
[1:19:48] Supernatural that's just you doing what
[1:19:49] you're supposed to be doing but when you
[1:19:51] get really born again again of the
[1:19:53] spirit of God that's when the
[1:19:55] supernatural shows
[1:19:57] up amen something that you can't put on
[1:20:00] a plate and give it to somebody else you
[1:20:03] know that's what brother R said about
[1:20:04] perfect faith brother B said the
[1:20:06] difference about perfect faith and all
[1:20:07] the other senses is that you can't hand
[1:20:08] it to somebody else I can't sit here and
[1:20:11] take the experience that saved me that
[1:20:14] changed me that put me behind this
[1:20:16] Pulpit today I can't put it in a plate
[1:20:18] and hand it to you it won't do you any
[1:20:21] good amen but the supernatural God that
[1:20:24] showed up to me and gave me my
[1:20:26] experience and changed me the reason why
[1:20:28] I'm up here preaching this morning when
[1:20:31] God handed it to me that's what changed
[1:20:35] me and that's how we preach that
[1:20:37] Supernatural experience I'm not telling
[1:20:40] you that you got to fast for three days
[1:20:42] and then read the whole your Bible and
[1:20:44] don't forget the church the seven uh
[1:20:46] seals and then you can finally have the
[1:20:48] Holy Ghost that's not how it comes it's
[1:20:51] a supernatural God
[1:20:53] and you got to be able to yield yourself
[1:20:55] unto it and surrender your life to it
[1:20:58] amen that's how you'll find out what I'm
[1:21:01] talking
[1:21:02] about if you would have seen me 20 years
[1:21:04] ago you would have thought that guy
[1:21:05] never has a chance you would have been
[1:21:07] like Sarah there ain't no way he can
[1:21:08] have a child amen if you saw the muck
[1:21:11] that I was in and I tell young people
[1:21:13] this all the time amen I said I'm
[1:21:15] jealous of your
[1:21:17] chance I'm jealous of your chance of
[1:21:20] your opportunity because I know when I
[1:21:22] preach about the world I'm preaching
[1:21:24] from
[1:21:25] experience I've dealt with the world
[1:21:28] I've rubbed shoulders and shoulders with
[1:21:30] the world I've done the bars and the
[1:21:32] drinking and the drugs I've done it I've
[1:21:34] Seen It All I've seen crazy people I've
[1:21:36] seen it and I'm GNA tell you something
[1:21:38] it ain't worth
[1:21:40] anything it's not even worth your
[1:21:43] testimony
[1:21:44] amen amen listen I know it's a trick of
[1:21:47] the of the devil for some message people
[1:21:49] so let me just get this across again
[1:21:51] real quick okay listen to me you do not
[1:21:54] need to go into the world to get a
[1:21:56] testimony that's that's right amen you
[1:21:59] don't need it you don't need it you say
[1:22:02] brother Stephen though you were
[1:22:03] delivered from drugs and alcohol and
[1:22:05] cigarettes yes I was and I wish I never
[1:22:08] would have had
[1:22:11] it you know why you know why I it just
[1:22:15] shames me to even say this but I just
[1:22:17] got to tell the truth okay smoke you
[1:22:19] know how you get sometimes you go into a
[1:22:21] bad place and there's smokers you go
[1:22:24] terrible and you get all set I
[1:22:26] don't smoking doesn't bother me I'm used
[1:22:30] to it it's happened to me I've done it
[1:22:33] so I get around a bunch of smokers it
[1:22:35] doesn't affect me and I'll go home and
[1:22:37] I'll start condemning myself because I'm
[1:22:40] going Lord it should upset me more why
[1:22:44] doesn't it upset me and yet it doesn't
[1:22:46] upset me I want to cough like you all
[1:22:48] cough but I can't because I'm I plagued
[1:22:52] my body
[1:22:53] with that stuff there's a reason why God
[1:22:55] prevented brother Brandon from even
[1:22:56] experiencing smoking and drinking
[1:22:59] there's more reasons in this whether you
[1:23:01] would have believed it or not it helped
[1:23:03] Brother Brad because he had such a
[1:23:05] calling it would have affected his mind
[1:23:07] and his body too I know it did it to
[1:23:11] me amen and that and and it was God's
[1:23:15] mercy to brother Brandon because God
[1:23:16] knew what that man was going to have to
[1:23:17] go through even without the smoking and
[1:23:21] drinking he had double bind battles
[1:23:24] again oh the grace and mercy of God and
[1:23:26] can I tell you young people you got the
[1:23:29] same chance amen you do not need the
[1:23:33] world for a
[1:23:37] testimony your testimony is way better
[1:23:40] than
[1:23:41] mine mine just looks fancy but it's it's
[1:23:45] it's more of just because of
[1:23:46] circumstances and what God had to send
[1:23:48] me through amen my experience won't work
[1:23:51] for you right
[1:23:53] that's what I'm telling you run away
[1:23:54] from the world you don't need it
[1:23:58] amen the world will never be an
[1:24:01] advantage to
[1:24:05] you I'm really I'm really saying that
[1:24:08] seriously maybe it's a young and old now
[1:24:10] I think about it maybe some of your old
[1:24:12] people maybe experienced some of the
[1:24:14] things I did maybe gives you a little
[1:24:15] more understanding of your struggle
[1:24:16] sometimes and maybe then you'll be able
[1:24:18] to receive a little more grace in your
[1:24:19] life
[1:24:20] too cuz a lot of times s Satan likes to
[1:24:23] use your memory to bring up those bad
[1:24:24] things you did oh yeah and you go Bo
[1:24:26] you're a terrible person weren't you
[1:24:28] you'll probably just be terrible
[1:24:29] tomorrow no you won't you got God on
[1:24:31] your side hallu no you won't you got God
[1:24:35] on your side amen hallelujah but
[1:24:38] remember that colored woman gave that
[1:24:40] testimony I know I ain't what I ought to
[1:24:42] be amen I know I should be more whatever
[1:24:46] it is but I know one thing I ain't what
[1:24:48] I used to
[1:24:51] be see give yourself we're going to talk
[1:24:53] about in a little bit why don't you just
[1:24:54] be able to receive more grace in your
[1:24:57] life Lord instead of using your past
[1:25:00] sins to decide what happens to you now
[1:25:02] listen I'm going to tell you something
[1:25:03] man let's just be real okay you can't
[1:25:05] change what you did yesterday right what
[1:25:07] are you trying to change what you did
[1:25:08] yesterday you did it okay what are you
[1:25:11] going to do about
[1:25:12] it amen what are you going to do about
[1:25:14] it just wall in your Despair and just
[1:25:15] keep doing it why don't you put it on
[1:25:17] the blood and try better today
[1:25:19] am and let's say you fail today again
[1:25:21] doing it
[1:25:22] okay get it on the blood let's try again
[1:25:25] tomorrow right sometimes God's going to
[1:25:27] get you going through that sometimes
[1:25:29] just you realize why don't you quit
[1:25:30] trying just give it to
[1:25:33] God why don't you just quit trying and
[1:25:36] give it to God
[1:25:37] Amen give God those trials give God
[1:25:40] those
[1:25:41] problems amen just get on your knees and
[1:25:44] say God I can't do
[1:25:45] it I've tried and maybe you got to do it
[1:25:48] another hundred times before you do
[1:25:49] listen God knows how to do things better
[1:25:51] than us
[1:25:53] right you know you know look at the
[1:25:55] story and we're going to finish it don't
[1:25:56] worry Lord
[1:25:58] willing but you look at Abraham and
[1:26:00] Sarah here amen could God have healed
[1:26:03] Abraham and Sarah when Abraham was 75
[1:26:05] and she was 65 when he first came to
[1:26:08] Abraham could he have healed their body
[1:26:10] then and they have the sun right now
[1:26:12] sure they could sure he could but God
[1:26:15] said that wasn't a big enough miracle I
[1:26:17] need this miracle to be even
[1:26:20] bigger so he waited
[1:26:23] 25 years years
[1:26:28] years Paul how old are you 23
[1:26:31] 23 he would be if he God came the same
[1:26:34] promise to you he'd be
[1:26:36] 48 by the time it's
[1:26:38] done just think about that for a second
[1:26:41] and he's gonna well he I was going to
[1:26:43] say he's gonna have gray hair but I know
[1:26:44] his
[1:26:48] daddy he might he might not have no hair
[1:26:54] Zach I know you'll keep your hair
[1:26:59] buddy hopefully Brother Sam doesn't get
[1:27:01] to this part of the
[1:27:03] sermon forgive me buddy where are the C
[1:27:05] forgive me
[1:27:09] buddy oh Lord forgive me I crack up too
[1:27:12] much
[1:27:13] sometimes but you see
[1:27:16] 25
[1:27:19] years it's it's one thing when you just
[1:27:21] sit here and look in your Bible and you
[1:27:23] go and you waited 25 years uhhuh and
[1:27:26] then you keep reading go to the rest of
[1:27:27] the story you kind of have to put
[1:27:28] yourself in the story for a little bit
[1:27:30] uhuh think about waiting for 25 years
[1:27:32] believeing the same promise over and
[1:27:33] over and over again and all you're doing
[1:27:35] is get older and older and
[1:27:38] older there was a chance it could have
[1:27:40] happened now it looks like there's no
[1:27:41] chance at
[1:27:43] all so let's keep reading this here in
[1:27:45] Genesis
[1:27:47] 18 Genesis 18:10 and he said I will
[1:27:50] certainly return unto thee according
[1:27:52] morning to the time of life and though
[1:27:54] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:27:56] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[1:27:58] was behind him now now watch how the
[1:28:01] Bible says this because it explains the
[1:28:04] doubts she has watch in verse 11 now
[1:28:07] Abraham saying we're
[1:28:09] old and whale stricken in
[1:28:12] age yeah they were a 100y old man and a
[1:28:16] 90-year-old woman yeah now hey he's say
[1:28:19] he's saying Sarah heard this now
[1:28:21] remember case you forgot Abraham Sarah
[1:28:25] old and well stricken in
[1:28:28] age and it ceased to be with Sarah after
[1:28:31] the manner of women menopause amen so
[1:28:35] she hasn't had anything she's an old
[1:28:38] lady and you think about it put yourself
[1:28:41] in Sarah's shoes for a
[1:28:43] second what would you have said some of
[1:28:45] you think you would have been like oh
[1:28:46] yeah bless God I'm still going to have
[1:28:48] it anyways look how tough of a Christian
[1:28:50] I am
[1:28:53] the Bible is somewhat justifying what
[1:28:55] Sarah's
[1:28:57] thinking it's saying yes in the natural
[1:29:00] in the world it makes no
[1:29:02] sense how can't she have a
[1:29:05] child so no wonder she's
[1:29:09] doubting no wonder this is hard to
[1:29:13] grasp watch this in verse 12 therefore
[1:29:16] Sarah laughed within herself she laughed
[1:29:19] this is a kind of different laugh than
[1:29:20] we're going to read about later though
[1:29:22] this is a different kind of laugh right
[1:29:24] here amen she's laughing going how can
[1:29:27] this be therefore Sarah laughed within
[1:29:30] herself
[1:29:31] saying after I wax old so I have
[1:29:35] pleasure my Lord old
[1:29:38] also listen
[1:29:40] yeah according to the Natural according
[1:29:42] to the world according to every single
[1:29:44] one of her
[1:29:45] senses there's no way this can
[1:29:48] happen no wonder she chuckled within
[1:29:51] herself
[1:29:52] wonder she laughed what a come
[1:29:57] on it's been 25
[1:30:00] years I'm that's old how is this going
[1:30:02] to happen look at me look at all the
[1:30:06] wrinkles look at all the gray there's no
[1:30:10] way now
[1:30:12] watch therefore oh actually let's read
[1:30:14] this quote real quick we'll go back to
[1:30:16] that scripture brother said in birth
[1:30:17] pains watch what God said about this
[1:30:19] doubt now remember we look at this down
[1:30:22] we go yeah it kind of makes sense she's
[1:30:23] having this doubt but look what happened
[1:30:26] birth pains 65 but the one that was with
[1:30:28] the group that was pulled out done a
[1:30:30] miracle before Abraham to show that who
[1:30:32] he was and was with Abraham and he said
[1:30:34] why did Sarah laugh concerning this baby
[1:30:37] and Sarah come forth and said she didn't
[1:30:39] and said but you did and he would have
[1:30:42] killed her right there if she wasn't a
[1:30:46] part of
[1:30:48] Abraham so would God slay us if if we
[1:30:52] wasn't a part of
[1:30:55] Christ the mercy of Christ all holds us
[1:31:00] [Applause]
[1:31:02] together look at Sarah here you can see
[1:31:06] her doubts and go it makes
[1:31:08] sense it does make sense amen but watch
[1:31:13] What God Says to her
[1:31:15] here verse 13 and the Lord said unto
[1:31:17] there wherefore did sarus laugh saying
[1:31:20] shall I surely bear a child which I
[1:31:22] Watch What God Says verse 14 is anything
[1:31:25] too hard for the Lord I want you I want
[1:31:29] you to take this home with you this is
[1:31:30] part of the sermon I want you to take
[1:31:32] home stick in your pocket and take it
[1:31:33] out and think about this some more
[1:31:35] sometimes we treat Faith as oh if I
[1:31:37] could just muster up more faith if I
[1:31:40] could just get to this value of Faith
[1:31:42] then I could finally believe these
[1:31:43] promises then I could believe it but you
[1:31:47] you got the whole wrong thing about
[1:31:49] faith there it's not faith in yourself
[1:31:51] it's faith in God God so it's not trying
[1:31:53] to muster up enough faith I want to ask
[1:31:55] you the question why don't you
[1:31:58] believe that's what I hope you
[1:32:00] understand that's what God's doing to
[1:32:01] Sarah right here think about it why
[1:32:03] don't you believe it why why do you
[1:32:06] think sometimes it's too hard it's
[1:32:08] because you're thinking how you're going
[1:32:09] to do it you're thinking how nature can
[1:32:12] do it you're thinking how the government
[1:32:14] can do
[1:32:15] it but did you start thinking how God
[1:32:18] could do
[1:32:20] it and that's why he asked the question
[1:32:23] is anything too hard for the Lord right
[1:32:27] and then you have to sit there and go
[1:32:28] well wait a minute then I keep
[1:32:30] questioning how why don't I believe more
[1:32:33] the question is why don't I believe
[1:32:35] it if I really believe in God then why
[1:32:38] can't it
[1:32:39] happen what is anything too hard for the
[1:32:42] Lord no is anything too hard for the
[1:32:44] Lord no no really are you sure cuz
[1:32:48] sometimes how you pray says
[1:32:50] otherwise
[1:32:52] oh Preacher Brother
[1:32:53] Stephen see look at Sarah here Sarah's
[1:32:57] in the same boat we are a lot of times
[1:32:59] aren't
[1:33:00] we Sarah's in the same boat she's
[1:33:02] looking at the promise going how can
[1:33:04] this happen what and he and God comes
[1:33:07] around says wait a minute is that
[1:33:08] anything too hard for the
[1:33:11] Lord is that anything too hard for God
[1:33:14] Amen there's nothing too hard for God
[1:33:16] why can't she have a child then
[1:33:20] amen could you imagine that
[1:33:22] morning remember we know what
[1:33:25] happens thank God for the message of the
[1:33:27] hour can you say
[1:33:28] Amen there's a lot of more ways to prove
[1:33:31] this but I'm just going to try to save a
[1:33:32] little time but you look at this and you
[1:33:34] go wow could you imagine that morning
[1:33:37] waking up when God showed up remember
[1:33:41] they're still old and well stricken age
[1:33:43] at this point and then God says at the
[1:33:45] time of life I'm going to visit you and
[1:33:48] you're going to
[1:33:50] conceive so that's about a space of a
[1:33:52] month is okay so they're going to go
[1:33:55] from a hundredy old man back to a 20y
[1:33:59] old man in the space of one
[1:34:03] month this ain't just a gradual thing
[1:34:06] this happened in a moment in an instant
[1:34:10] Amen in a twinkling of an eye this
[1:34:15] happened glory to God boy could you
[1:34:18] imagine waking up that
[1:34:20] morning
[1:34:22] no doubt Abraham had a had a bad
[1:34:24] shoulder or something you know how it is
[1:34:26] getting older right now I'm getting a
[1:34:28] little bit of a bad knee because of of
[1:34:29] an accident I had at work so my left
[1:34:31] knee just feels a little weaker than my
[1:34:32] right so every time I wake up it's a
[1:34:34] little cranky you know what I mean work
[1:34:36] it out you know how it is when you get
[1:34:38] older just things start hurting and
[1:34:40] things like that but I wonder if Abraham
[1:34:43] woke up one day brother Bill amen he
[1:34:46] just woke up all say he goes what in the
[1:34:50] world
[1:34:53] where's that where's that pain in that
[1:34:54] shoulder glory to God I can't wait for
[1:34:57] this day Friends
[1:35:00] Hall glory to
[1:35:02] God what's that pain in that shoulder I
[1:35:05] had what in the world going on that I
[1:35:08] wonder if he rolled over in the bed and
[1:35:10] just saw the back side of a lady with
[1:35:12] nothing but black
[1:35:14] hair jump out of the
[1:35:19] bed whoa who's that lady in my
[1:35:22] bad Oh Glory to God and maybe you jumped
[1:35:25] a little hard that day it's like whoa I
[1:35:27] jumped really far normally I would have
[1:35:30] fell over by now being a hundredy old
[1:35:34] man he goes what's going on who's that
[1:35:36] lady maybe got a mirror on the side of
[1:35:38] the wall all a sudden he looks and
[1:35:41] whoa I'm back to my buff self you know
[1:35:44] what I
[1:35:46] mean look at look oh could you imagine
[1:35:48] that day I'm going to tell you something
[1:35:50] you ain't going to have to to imagine it
[1:35:52] one of these days amen we're going to
[1:35:54] experience this
[1:35:56] hallelujah we're going to have a body
[1:35:58] change too
[1:36:02] amen glory to
[1:36:05] God Sarah get up she's back to be a
[1:36:08] young woman again the promise came
[1:36:12] fulfilled
[1:36:13] amen and she was able to conceive and do
[1:36:17] you understand Sarah did nothing
[1:36:21] to deserve
[1:36:24] it she doubted we we didn't get to that
[1:36:27] part but remember she even told God he
[1:36:28] was a
[1:36:30] liar but because she was connected to
[1:36:32] Abraham God couldn't touch her y why
[1:36:36] because the promise was through
[1:36:38] Sarah no matter what happened do you
[1:36:41] remember the story of when Abraham sends
[1:36:43] a m a a lies sck the king abik that
[1:36:47] that's my sister not my wife and the
[1:36:48] King takes Sarah to be his wife
[1:36:52] and all of a sudden that night comes and
[1:36:55] he says you're good as a dead
[1:36:57] man right and I say what are you talking
[1:37:00] about I did this in the T did he not say
[1:37:02] that's Sarah his sister I didn't know it
[1:37:05] was his wife he says that's why I
[1:37:07] witheld Thee from sinning against me
[1:37:08] that's why you haven't done anything
[1:37:10] further do you know why God's doing this
[1:37:12] he says if you don't give that woman
[1:37:14] back to that man amen I'm going to
[1:37:17] destroy your whole
[1:37:19] nation I will destroy every you
[1:37:22] have why is he so IM intimate about this
[1:37:26] why is he getting on to it it's because
[1:37:28] the promise was through Sarah
[1:37:31] Hallelujah even when she remember she
[1:37:34] was obeying her husband and it she found
[1:37:36] herself in this condition and yet God
[1:37:38] showed
[1:37:39] up and got her out of the situation why
[1:37:42] the promise Hallelujah was that Sarah
[1:37:46] was going to have the
[1:37:47] child and no matter what Abraham did no
[1:37:50] matter how much Sarah unbelieved amen
[1:37:53] God was still going to fulfill his word
[1:37:56] through
[1:37:59] Sarah and he
[1:38:01] did Hallelujah and he
[1:38:05] did no wonder Sarah was
[1:38:11] laughing no wonder Sarah laughed when
[1:38:14] she finally had the son prise God God in
[1:38:18] all of her doubts I hope you hearing me
[1:38:20] I hope you can put you see yourself in
[1:38:21] the word a little bit here even in all
[1:38:24] your doubts
[1:38:25] sometimes and all your fears and the and
[1:38:29] in the days that you have bad days and
[1:38:31] you feel like Sarah calling God a liar
[1:38:33] to his
[1:38:35] face God is still going to fulfill his
[1:38:38] word through
[1:38:41] you so
[1:38:43] much that you now know why Sarah was
[1:38:46] laughing do you know why you know how
[1:38:48] why Sarah is laughing it's the same
[1:38:50] reason why you got to laugh
[1:38:54] sometimes you sit here and you think
[1:38:56] about the stuff that you did in your
[1:38:57] life and all the judgments that you
[1:39:00] deserved and you know you do I know I
[1:39:05] do I know the stuff that I did and I
[1:39:08] know the stuff I still do today to be
[1:39:10] honest with you and I need Grace just as
[1:39:12] much I hope you understand Sarah in the
[1:39:15] end had to laugh to herself and receive
[1:39:17] the son despite her feelings of
[1:39:20] inferiority and despite her feelings of
[1:39:22] not feeling worth it she still had to
[1:39:25] Humble herself and receive the grace for
[1:39:27] her
[1:39:29] sins just like
[1:39:32] you sometimes you think that you have to
[1:39:34] punish yourself I think I shared this
[1:39:36] with you last time I don't remember it
[1:39:38] might have been another church I don't
[1:39:39] remember but I remember one time I did
[1:39:41] something really stupid boneheaded thing
[1:39:43] and I knew I shouldn't have done it the
[1:39:45] Bible says if the Lord should Mark
[1:39:46] iniquity who could stand but I hated
[1:39:49] myself I just hated myself and I was
[1:39:50] like I can't believe I did that I I feel
[1:39:53] like a failure I got down on my knees
[1:39:55] and I said God you need to punish me I
[1:39:58] said God I need to be in trouble for
[1:40:00] this I need to Bear my body's the mark
[1:40:03] of Jesus
[1:40:04] here I got on I said God I was praying
[1:40:07] for
[1:40:08] punishment and this you know what God
[1:40:10] spoke to me it a still Small Voice and
[1:40:12] God can still do it yes he can he said
[1:40:16] no he said because you would have more
[1:40:18] faith in punishment than faith in
[1:40:24] me and do you know what I had to do I
[1:40:27] had to lay aside my pride because that's
[1:40:30] what it was I wouldn't feel safe saved
[1:40:34] until I got punished but I had to lay
[1:40:36] aside my pride I can't take it back I
[1:40:39] can't take it back remember I hope
[1:40:41] you're hearing me you can't go back
[1:40:42] tomorrow and take it back you can't do
[1:40:43] it
[1:40:45] right but can you receive Grace for
[1:40:49] it
[1:40:51] and just say Lord Lord I I failed Lord I
[1:40:56] failed Lord I doubted Lord some of my
[1:40:58] actions have called you a
[1:41:00] liar I ruin my testimony sometimes Lord
[1:41:04] listen I hope you understand my hands
[1:41:06] are up right now too I failed God and I
[1:41:10] can't go back and change it Lord but
[1:41:12] Lord God I'm willing to lay aside my
[1:41:17] pride I'm willing to lay all my
[1:41:20] ambitions my
[1:41:22] opinions say God you're right and I was
[1:41:28] wrong and I need your grace in order to
[1:41:33] receive the promised
[1:41:35] son
[1:41:37] Hallelujah that's what I need you see
[1:41:40] why Sarah laughed the law and the rules
[1:41:42] can't make you laugh it makes you more
[1:41:44] depressed but when you start getting
[1:41:46] that kind of an attitude you have to
[1:41:48] just say God I give my all to you
[1:41:51] wo I give my all I can't do
[1:41:55] it wow this sermon is going a little
[1:41:57] different now than I
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:00] thought listen this this kind of
[1:42:02] thinking isn't just applying to our
[1:42:05] attitude towards the
[1:42:07] Rapture I wonder if this is why we're
[1:42:09] messed up on our day-to-day
[1:42:12] sometimes being able to receive how many
[1:42:15] times have you spent condemning yourself
[1:42:17] I
[1:42:19] wonder how many times times have you
[1:42:21] tried to get yourself in trouble oh
[1:42:23] brother I got to reap what I sowed
[1:42:25] listen God gives the increase you
[1:42:28] remember remember what what did Paul say
[1:42:30] Paul said Paul planted apoll watered but
[1:42:32] God gives the increase listen we don't
[1:42:35] decide who gets the judgments when you
[1:42:38] reap what you sow you reap what you sow
[1:42:40] God is the one that
[1:42:43] reaps God's the one that's going to reap
[1:42:45] it God decides the
[1:42:47] increase it's not up to you how much
[1:42:50] trouble you should get
[1:42:54] into like I said how often do we spend
[1:42:57] time condemning ourselves oh this is
[1:43:00] going way different I want you to open
[1:43:02] up to Romans 17 oh you forgive me Church
[1:43:06] uh let's just let's just read Romans 17s
[1:43:09] and we're going to try to wrap it up
[1:43:10] here but I really I really feel this
[1:43:12] impressed now Romans chapter
[1:43:14] 7 we're going to read Romans chapter 7
[1:43:17] and we'll make it to verse uh chapter
[1:43:19] eight and then we'll see what the Lord
[1:43:21] does Amen
[1:43:23] but I want you to really start be able
[1:43:26] to receive this Grace this is why Sarah
[1:43:29] laughed and that's is why you can
[1:43:31] understand why when you look at Sarah
[1:43:33] you could laugh with her because you
[1:43:36] have to experience the same kind of
[1:43:38] Grace and I'm going to show you
[1:43:39] something listen you need to quit trying
[1:43:42] to throw yourself under the
[1:43:44] bus quit trying to punish yourself and
[1:43:47] get you listen that's why sometimes you
[1:43:49] don't get down your knees and pray
[1:43:50] because you don't feel worthy so then
[1:43:52] you go well there's no point in
[1:43:53] approaching God look how much sin I did
[1:43:55] there's no point in approaching God now
[1:43:57] and then what happens it just turns into
[1:43:58] a cycle now you're not even approaching
[1:43:59] God about anything then it's hard to go
[1:44:01] to church you just sit there bored to
[1:44:03] church because because it's it's going
[1:44:05] to go right through any one not the
[1:44:06] other that's why these bad things happen
[1:44:08] a lot almost all the
[1:44:11] time is because of this condemnation
[1:44:13] Spirit true I want to show you something
[1:44:15] here I want to show you something here
[1:44:16] about yourself here Paul said this about
[1:44:19] himself in Romans 7 verse 15 for that
[1:44:23] which I do I allow not for what I would
[1:44:26] that do I not but what I hate that do I
[1:44:30] all right Paul Paul something wrong not
[1:44:32] you Paul this Paul maybe you too though
[1:44:35] you got to put yourself in the word
[1:44:36] though so we'll use you
[1:44:40] anyways you forgive me I was just saying
[1:44:42] Paul and I looked right at him
[1:44:44] so what is Paul saying here is there two
[1:44:47] people standing here how can you do
[1:44:50] something you
[1:44:52] hate and yet he's saying those things
[1:44:54] that I hate that do
[1:44:57] I verse 16 if then I do that which I
[1:45:01] would not I consent unto the law that it
[1:45:03] is good remember that that's part of
[1:45:06] repentance is being able to admit the
[1:45:08] words right and you're
[1:45:10] wrong so you we don't lose that even
[1:45:12] when you're not necessarily fulfilling
[1:45:14] it and you're not living up to Snuff in
[1:45:16] your own eyes this is still right and
[1:45:19] you're not
[1:45:21] that's what he's saying that if I do
[1:45:22] that which I would not I am consenting
[1:45:24] that this is right see a lot of people
[1:45:27] think that oh you can sit and do
[1:45:29] whatever you want it's okay no it's not
[1:45:32] okay you're at see it's more than just
[1:45:35] what you're doing it's your attitude
[1:45:37] towards the
[1:45:38] word they're saying oh I could still
[1:45:40] smoke and be a Christian no that's wrong
[1:45:45] now let's let's take another smoker who
[1:45:47] tries to be a Christian he goes I know
[1:45:49] this is wrong I'm just praying I stop
[1:45:52] yet they're both smoking yet one's going
[1:45:54] to be okay and one's not going to be
[1:45:56] okay what was the difference it was not
[1:45:58] the action it's their attitude towards
[1:46:00] it one didn't admit the word's right one
[1:46:04] did admit the word's right there's a lot
[1:46:07] more chance for that guy than this guy a
[1:46:10] whole lot more chance so what does Paul
[1:46:12] say here now so he's sing unto the law
[1:46:14] that it is good verse 17 now then it is
[1:46:17] no more that I do it but sin that dwell
[1:46:20] within me huh he just said he did it yet
[1:46:24] now he's saying he didn't do
[1:46:26] it how does this work what's going on
[1:46:29] who did it then that's a good point so
[1:46:31] he's going to explain it Verse 18 for I
[1:46:35] know that in me that is my flesh now we
[1:46:40] got the bad
[1:46:41] guy now we found the bad guy you know I
[1:46:44] had somebody argue with me about
[1:46:45] predestination one time and and and I
[1:46:49] was teaching about predestination and so
[1:46:50] forth he came up to me and said I just
[1:46:51] don't understand that predestination
[1:46:53] Stephen I don't get it I'm like well
[1:46:54] what do you don't get I'm here to help
[1:46:56] he said well the Bible says for there's
[1:46:57] no good thing in me and I said uhuh you
[1:47:00] didn't finish that
[1:47:03] scripture you didn't finish what Paul
[1:47:05] said he said for I know that in me that
[1:47:09] is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing
[1:47:15] wait a minute there's something good in
[1:47:17] you
[1:47:19] then there is something good in you amen
[1:47:23] it's the hidden man of the
[1:47:25] heart there is something good about you
[1:47:29] and Paul is saying I
[1:47:31] know that in me that is in my flesh
[1:47:35] dwelleth no good thing so now let's take
[1:47:39] it to the other side did you know there
[1:47:40] is no good thing about your flesh at all
[1:47:44] right there is nothing not one ounce of
[1:47:46] your flesh that's
[1:47:47] good it's all evil the Bible says you
[1:47:50] were born born in sin shaken iniquity
[1:47:51] you came for for the wo speaking lines
[1:47:53] there is no good thing about your
[1:47:55] flesh Peter said abstain from fleshly
[1:47:58] lust which war against the
[1:48:01] soul we just sang that song huh we're
[1:48:03] going to war or whatever it was that's
[1:48:06] the war we're talking about we're not
[1:48:08] talking about the war where we fight
[1:48:09] each other we're talking about the war
[1:48:11] that the flesh before the
[1:48:13] soul amen so you see what Paul's saying
[1:48:16] here for I know that in me that is in my
[1:48:20] flesh dwelleth no good thing for the
[1:48:23] will is present with me but how to
[1:48:26] perform that which is good I find not
[1:48:28] for the good that I would I do not but
[1:48:31] the evil which I would not that I
[1:48:35] do I tell you a brother I've been
[1:48:39] there I think I'm here just about every
[1:48:42] day of my life it's not even that bad
[1:48:46] sometimes it's just those stupid YouTube
[1:48:48] shorts you know what I I mean well maybe
[1:48:50] some of the younger crowd knows what I
[1:48:52] mean or the Facebook reals I hate those
[1:48:55] things
[1:48:56] man some of them are catchy so it's
[1:48:59] funny for 20 seconds and then all of a
[1:49:01] sudden you're swiping and you're stuck
[1:49:04] for 20 minutes and you go what did I
[1:49:06] just
[1:49:08] do for which I would do
[1:49:11] not that do
[1:49:13] I don't you to hate that stuff it's just
[1:49:15] a waste of time too you probably didn't
[1:49:16] even see nothing bad a lot of times mine
[1:49:18] is just a denomination preachers
[1:49:20] preaching and stuff like that some make
[1:49:22] good points some make bad
[1:49:23] points that's true but see I I just look
[1:49:26] at it and then I just wasted 20 minutes
[1:49:28] and I go where'd it
[1:49:29] go I didn't want to do that and yet here
[1:49:32] I am doing
[1:49:33] it you see what I hope you understand
[1:49:35] you got put yourself in the word okay
[1:49:38] Paul but watch what he says here now if
[1:49:41] I do that which I want not not it is no
[1:49:43] more that I do it but sin that dwelleth
[1:49:47] in me wait a minute so where's the sin
[1:49:50] it's not listen when you get circumcised
[1:49:52] by the Holy Ghost it separates you your
[1:49:54] soul is separated from your
[1:49:56] flesh amen so see you are a new creature
[1:50:00] in Christ you're different oh
[1:50:05] hallelujah oh here let's keep reading
[1:50:07] here because I want to get to one more
[1:50:08] point and we'll be done verse 20 again
[1:50:10] now if I do that which I would not it is
[1:50:12] no more that I do it but sin that
[1:50:13] dwelleth in me I find in a law that when
[1:50:15] I would do good evil is present with me
[1:50:18] for I Delight in the law of God after
[1:50:20] for the inward man a hidden man of the
[1:50:23] heart but I see another law in my
[1:50:26] members Waring against the law of my
[1:50:29] mind and bringing me into captivity the
[1:50:31] law of sin which is in my members oh
[1:50:34] wred man that I am who shall deliver me
[1:50:38] from the body of this death you ever
[1:50:39] felt like that
[1:50:41] before what is he talking about I hope
[1:50:44] you understand he's talking about this
[1:50:47] oh you forgive me church for this I'm
[1:50:50] listen listen did you know they even
[1:50:52] proven this scientifically that your
[1:50:54] flesh fights your uh your choice who you
[1:50:57] are your flesh can fight you that you
[1:51:00] even take um uh you take dieting and so
[1:51:02] forth A lot of times when you start
[1:51:03] trying to like keto diets or whatever
[1:51:06] like that and you start start losing
[1:51:07] carbs or whatever you're and you you'll
[1:51:09] find yourself start wanting
[1:51:11] sweets and yet you think about it your
[1:51:13] body doesn't actually need sugar you
[1:51:15] know what you actually lose when you go
[1:51:16] on those low carb diets and things like
[1:51:17] that you actually lose salt you actually
[1:51:20] lose a lot of salt and sodium that's why
[1:51:21] you get leg cramps and things like that
[1:51:24] but yet your body was trained into
[1:51:26] thinking where did it get the salt all
[1:51:28] the time from those sweets and so it
[1:51:31] mixed up those things and that's why
[1:51:33] you're getting a sweet cake craving even
[1:51:36] though your body actually needs salt
[1:51:39] your body can lie to you y That's right
[1:51:42] listen listen take addiction for a
[1:51:43] second we were talking about smoking
[1:51:44] earlier did you know there's nobody in
[1:51:46] the world addicted addicted to
[1:51:48] nicotine did you know that do you know
[1:51:51] what happens when you take a cigarette
[1:51:53] and it puts nicotine in your body you
[1:51:54] know what your body does it reacts to
[1:51:56] that nicotine by releasing hormones
[1:51:58] they're called the Feelgood chemicals
[1:52:00] listen and that's what listen I hate
[1:52:03] doing it like this but it's a truth
[1:52:05] people if you never experienced it don't
[1:52:07] ever even try to figure it out please
[1:52:08] don't but they call it a buzz that's
[1:52:11] what happens is that when the chemicals
[1:52:13] go up into your brain and you start
[1:52:15] feeling good you get a buzz and that's
[1:52:17] what's happening it was not the nicotine
[1:52:20] that did it it was the hormones that
[1:52:22] your own body
[1:52:24] produced and you know what happens so
[1:52:26] you'll take a cigarette and you go oh I
[1:52:28] feel good oh I feel good and then you
[1:52:31] keep doing it over and over again oh I
[1:52:33] feel good but guess what guess what
[1:52:34] happens after a little while see see
[1:52:37] this is where the devil don't tell you
[1:52:38] the whole
[1:52:40] story this is where the world don't tell
[1:52:42] you the whole story don't worry God sent
[1:52:44] an angel to tell you the whole
[1:52:47] story cuz you know what's going to
[1:52:49] happen to you later all a sudden you
[1:52:51] stop feeling so
[1:52:53] good and guess what now you start
[1:52:56] feeling terrible you'll wake up every
[1:52:59] morning with what they call smoker's
[1:53:00] lung and it's a real thing because I've
[1:53:03] done it what happens is you wake
[1:53:06] up you start hacking up along and the
[1:53:09] only way to fix it is to light it up
[1:53:12] it's the only way to fix it and you got
[1:53:14] to take another
[1:53:15] cigarette and guess what you don't feel
[1:53:17] good anymore when you do it it's normal
[1:53:20] now see and what happens now you're in a
[1:53:25] prison you're in prison
[1:53:27] now see that's the rest of the story y
[1:53:31] amen we don't want listen they and
[1:53:33] listen can I say this where did that
[1:53:35] stuff come from what's the chemicals
[1:53:37] that the body's looking for it's the
[1:53:39] chemicals out of its own self what is it
[1:53:41] oxycotton and and do and dopamines and
[1:53:44] things like that that's what the body's
[1:53:47] looking for so then when those chemicals
[1:53:48] leave the brain the body goes Hey
[1:53:50] where's my chemicals where's my hormones
[1:53:53] and how do you get the hormones back you
[1:53:55] got to do a cigarette they've done that
[1:53:57] with alcohol that's why you have drunks
[1:54:01] did you know they' proven this with
[1:54:02] gambling see it's not just a substance
[1:54:05] thing it's not just a substance thing
[1:54:06] because people think oh it's because
[1:54:08] you're putting a certain chemical in
[1:54:09] your body that's triggering the hormone
[1:54:11] like I said they proven it with gambling
[1:54:14] they've proven that when you gamble and
[1:54:15] things like that and that's why listen
[1:54:17] you oh well
[1:54:20] maybe I'm just giving you some little
[1:54:22] tools to fight later or something like
[1:54:23] that amen you remember something about
[1:54:25] gambling there's a saying The House
[1:54:27] Always Wins
[1:54:29] y if you gamble you're nothing but a
[1:54:33] loser right you may win a couple times
[1:54:35] in the beginning why are you winning a
[1:54:37] couple times in the beginning to get you
[1:54:40] addicted you'll get the dopamine hit
[1:54:42] you'll get the chemicals in your brain
[1:54:43] but guess what happens later all a
[1:54:46] sudden you'll start losing and start
[1:54:48] losing and start losing and what do you
[1:54:50] keep chasing you're not even chasing
[1:54:52] money anymore if you were you'd keep
[1:54:53] your
[1:54:56] money if you were really Chas if there
[1:54:59] people addicted to gambling did you know
[1:55:01] in order for gambling to be allowed in
[1:55:02] the state of Ohio they had to create a
[1:55:03] hotline to help people being addicted to
[1:55:05] gambling
[1:55:07] crazy what a stupid world we live in you
[1:55:11] know you know what they call it the
[1:55:12] syntax right you know what the syntax is
[1:55:15] for cigarette smokes and then they start
[1:55:17] programs in those schools because they
[1:55:18] use the syntax to pay for the schools
[1:55:21] and in those schools they create dare
[1:55:22] programs to get people off smoking and
[1:55:23] drinking Y and yet they need the smokers
[1:55:26] and drinkers to pay for the Dare program
[1:55:27] to start tell people see the world's
[1:55:29] insane when they come up with plans they
[1:55:31] can't come up with a good one can
[1:55:33] they that's why they want to start
[1:55:35] legalizing marijuana so they can make
[1:55:36] more money off of it the Bible says fear
[1:55:39] those that make merchandise of you
[1:55:40] that's right what the world does all
[1:55:42] they do is you're just a person to make
[1:55:44] them more money y That's all gambling's
[1:55:47] going to do for you too well this this
[1:55:48] is going a lot different I hope you
[1:55:50] forgive me amen we're supposed to about
[1:55:53] how great grace is and everything like
[1:55:54] that amen but I'm going to tell you
[1:55:56] something amen fleshly lust which war
[1:56:00] against the soul that's what Paul's
[1:56:02] talking about did Paul have a micro a
[1:56:04] microscope to see all those enzymes and
[1:56:06] things like that no he knew how the
[1:56:08] world operated he knew these things
[1:56:10] happened and then science broke into
[1:56:12] more and found out huh Paul was right
[1:56:14] the whole time you can do things that
[1:56:17] you would not do
[1:56:20] amen your flesh can desire something
[1:56:23] that you don't
[1:56:24] want you're a body hear me Church your
[1:56:28] body can lie to
[1:56:32] you amen just because you don't feel
[1:56:36] good don't mean you're
[1:56:39] wrong preach it brother
[1:56:41] Stephen we always talk about it God's
[1:56:44] not about emotions God's not about
[1:56:46] feelings and yet we use feelings to
[1:56:47] almost justify everything in our life
[1:56:50] oh I was feeling bad that's why I need
[1:56:51] to do this oh I'm feeling bad that's why
[1:56:53] I need to do that are you
[1:56:55] sure are you sure if it's contrary to
[1:56:58] this it don't matter what you
[1:57:00] feel that's why sometimes when you come
[1:57:02] to church you don't feel good afterwards
[1:57:05] you know why it's just like what B's
[1:57:06] mama said they have their bath and after
[1:57:09] their bath what you have to get that
[1:57:11] shot of castor
[1:57:12] oil and brother R brother R was said to
[1:57:15] Mom said Mama I hate that stuff why we
[1:57:16] got to take it said if it don't hurt you
[1:57:18] it don't do you no good
[1:57:20] right that's why sometimes you go to
[1:57:22] church it's not a big old joyous time
[1:57:24] and everything's okay sometimes it's
[1:57:25] time to get down in the Rubber and face
[1:57:27] the fact that you got problems that need
[1:57:29] to be
[1:57:34] fixed
[1:57:36] amen amen thank you Lord see brother
[1:57:39] Stephen you think we deal with that I
[1:57:40] have no idea to be honest with you but
[1:57:43] I'll say this you may not deal with it
[1:57:46] today but it might come up tomorrow
[1:57:51] it's so sneaky
[1:57:53] folks and it's getting worse and worse
[1:57:55] to this
[1:57:57] day just you know I left my phone in the
[1:58:00] office just those phones Al low and have
[1:58:01] one ad they're doing it with sports
[1:58:04] betting now and things like that trying
[1:58:06] to hook you into gambling I I get them
[1:58:08] because I'm a I'm a you know 35 to 40
[1:58:10] year old male so they assume I like
[1:58:12] sports a lot and so you get those ads on
[1:58:15] your Facebook and things like that or on
[1:58:17] YouTube or something like that about
[1:58:18] DraftKings and things like that and and
[1:58:20] and and what are they trying to do
[1:58:22] they're trying to get you into sports
[1:58:23] betting to just try here here's $1,000
[1:58:26] worth of
[1:58:27] bets there ain't nowhere they're handing
[1:58:29] thousand bets to everybody if they ain't
[1:58:32] making a
[1:58:35] dime see it's getting worse and worse
[1:58:37] and all it is is just one little ad on
[1:58:39] your phone
[1:58:40] boom you see why it's so important to
[1:58:44] have the Holy Ghost in this day and
[1:58:46] age it is so important and you say
[1:58:51] brother Stephen I've had the Holy Ghost
[1:58:52] for 30 years well then you better make
[1:58:55] sure you have it 30 years in one
[1:58:59] day the Bible says make your calling and
[1:59:02] election sure how often didn't say you
[1:59:05] know why you probably ought to do it
[1:59:06] every time you wake
[1:59:09] up I hope you I hope you love brother
[1:59:11] Stephen after this amen but I hope you
[1:59:14] understand what brother see I'm going to
[1:59:16] invite the musicians up because I want
[1:59:18] to I just really feel a solemn time
[1:59:21] right now in my heart
[1:59:22] especially because I'm feeling it too a
[1:59:25] little
[1:59:27] bit it's so easy for us Americans to get
[1:59:30] caught up in
[1:59:33] politics World stuff listen I'm not even
[1:59:36] fully against Sports and stuff like you
[1:59:38] know what I mean like throwing around a
[1:59:40] pig skin I don't whatever you know maybe
[1:59:42] the a lot of stuff around it it's
[1:59:44] wrong that's the truth ain't it a lot of
[1:59:47] that stuff around that stuff's wrong but
[1:59:49] the idea of just that and things like
[1:59:50] that a lot of times the things in our
[1:59:52] life are just those small little things
[1:59:54] like that and we come to find out
[1:59:56] they're wasting our time yeah and as
[1:59:59] soon as you stop doing it listen I've
[2:00:01] even tried to challenge myself and I
[2:00:02] don't know how much I succeed can you go
[2:00:05] without an electronic for one
[2:00:08] day you know what I mean I ask my myself
[2:00:11] these questions I don't think it's going
[2:00:13] to make me any more saved you understand
[2:00:16] that I don't think it's going to make me
[2:00:18] any more saved than the next person I'm
[2:00:20] saved because of Grace of almighty God
[2:00:22] who died on the cross for my sins that's
[2:00:24] why I'm going to make
[2:00:27] it but just think about that for a
[2:00:30] second could I go one day without
[2:00:34] electricity you know what I mean just
[2:00:37] one day and not even electricity just
[2:00:39] Electronics in general you know what I
[2:00:40] mean like could I actually do it and
[2:00:43] here's the thing folks I'm gonna be real
[2:00:45] with you I don't know my whole life's
[2:00:47] wrapped around it true you know what I
[2:00:51] mean
[2:00:52] yeah and then we wonder why we're not
[2:00:54] closer to God
[2:00:56] sometimes why church can be hard
[2:00:58] sometimes to go to in the
[2:01:00] morning why sometimes it feels like
[2:01:02] we're fighting fighting uh uh uh when
[2:01:05] the preacher says something and you just
[2:01:06] sit there and go well he doesn't know
[2:01:07] everything about it he don't need to
[2:01:09] know everything about it maybe you need
[2:01:10] to know more about
[2:01:12] it why why do we do that sometimes we're
[2:01:14] blaming everything
[2:01:16] else but sometimes we got to face the
[2:01:18] miror
[2:01:20] folks sometimes we got to face it
[2:01:22] because I I want to end with this can
[2:01:24] you bring up Romans 81 we read all that
[2:01:26] stuff I want you to understand something
[2:01:27] we're talking about this but I want you
[2:01:29] to remember about this in Romans 8
[2:01:32] verse1 there is therefore now no
[2:01:37] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[2:01:40] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[2:01:45] after the
[2:01:47] spirit that's what I want to be said
[2:01:51] about me and I want to challenge us this
[2:01:55] morning I want to challenge myself as
[2:01:57] well to be honest with
[2:01:59] you what does it mean when we say we
[2:02:01] walk not out of the flesh but after the
[2:02:03] spirit When God Says something in the
[2:02:05] spirit to do it we ought to do it true
[2:02:08] amen if God's leading us a certain way
[2:02:10] and I'm not I'm just using the
[2:02:11] electronic S as an example I hope you
[2:02:14] understand I'm not condemning there's no
[2:02:15] condemnation to Christ so there's no
[2:02:17] condemnation to us we're in Christ what
[2:02:20] I'm saying is if the spirit would ask us
[2:02:22] to do something are we
[2:02:25] willing God you forgive me Church what
[2:02:28] is what does it mean when we say we
[2:02:29] surrender all to
[2:02:31] God when we surrender
[2:02:35] all you know take things that you like
[2:02:38] oh let's take something I like I really
[2:02:40] like Taco
[2:02:43] Bell I shouldn't eat Taco Bell shouldn't
[2:02:46] do it but I like it okay now if God
[2:02:49] would come to me one day and said
[2:02:50] Stephen I am now calling you to eat Taco
[2:02:54] Bell every day of your life from now to
[2:02:58] Forever I'd be like well I better yield
[2:03:00] to the
[2:03:04] Lord I better yield to the Lord Jesus he
[2:03:06] said eat taco well every
[2:03:10] day you see that'd be easy for me to
[2:03:13] do there'd be no complaints for me
[2:03:16] either but see is that real surr
[2:03:21] what if God asked you to do something
[2:03:22] you don't want to do
[2:03:25] right you know what I mean what if God
[2:03:28] asked you to do something you don't want

[2:09:34] Lord for your love we look at Sarah and
[2:09:37] we look that through her doubts and her
[2:09:38] fears Lord you still brought the promise
[2:09:41] to her God no wonder Sarah had a laugh
[2:09:45] and Lord I wonder if we can look at our
[2:09:47] lives for a second as well and just say
[2:09:50] thank you Lord for I look at these
[2:09:53] moments in my life where I could have
[2:09:54] easily been
[2:09:55] destroyed easily been dead but yet
[2:09:59] somehow Lord I'm still here this
[2:10:02] morning and I'm so thankful for it God
[2:10:06] we're so thankful and no and I pray Lord
[2:10:08] God if we have any sins any besetting
[2:10:11] sins my hands are up as well Lord any
[2:10:15] sins that we got to get under the blood
[2:10:17] Lord I pray in the the name of Jesus we
[2:10:19] lay it aside right now humble ourselves
[2:10:22] before the might of almighty God and be
[2:10:25] able to receive Grace and receive
[2:10:28] strength as Sarah did for the Bible says
[2:10:33] that they shall approach the throne of
[2:10:35] grace boldly that they may find the
[2:10:38] grace and the mercy in the time of need
[2:10:41] Lord here's your church here's the time
[2:10:44] of need right now Lord God we approach
[2:10:47] your throne of grace boldly God say we
[2:10:50] believe in all your
[2:10:52] word we believe it God yes Lord though
[2:10:56] my actions may not have been all right
[2:10:59] Lord I admit you're still
[2:11:01] right your word is still right and I'm
[2:11:04] sorry and I'm wrong for all those things
[2:11:06] that I've done and now I humble myself
[2:11:09] before you Lord say God I don't have a
[2:11:13] chance without your grace and your
[2:11:17] mercy Here I Am Lord lifting my hands
[2:11:21] Here I Am Lord saying I can't do it
[2:11:23] without you lord I give up Lord I give
[2:11:27] up on
[2:11:28] myself and I said Lord I ain't got a
[2:11:30] chance but with you Hallelujah Lord the
[2:11:34] Bible says with men it's impossible but
[2:11:37] With God all things are
[2:11:42] possible and I pray God you would change
[2:11:44] these bodies Lord first change that soul
[2:11:48] that change my spirit then one of these
[2:11:50] days you're going to change my body not
[2:11:53] just to a younger self but you'll change
[2:11:55] the very
[2:11:57] molecules of my body
[2:12:00] Lord but before that day comes here we
[2:12:03] are Lord we can't change the
[2:12:05] past but we can put it all under the
[2:12:08] blood and now we can cry as the bride

[2:12:15] condemnation to them that are in Christ

[2:12:21] would just start bearing it Lord God
[2:12:24] putting it under the blood Lord God I

[2:12:33] things this morning Lord we talked about
[2:12:36] tricks of the devil and WS of the devil
[2:12:38] lord and no doubt if nobody was spoken
[2:12:42] to surely it was me Lord cuz I know that
[2:12:46] I've been tricked I've experienced those
[2:12:49] WS of the
[2:12:50] devil but I pray God as we sift through
[2:12:54] all that we just take them one at a time
[2:12:56] and put them under the
[2:12:58] blood I don't want to take a chance Lord
[2:13:02] God without you
[2:13:06] lord we want to surrender all to you

[2:13:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost I pray in the
[2:13:22] name of Jesus today will be the day
[2:13:25] where they change their
[2:13:28] decision they change the direction there
[2:13:30] is a chance for them
[2:13:33] yet they've experienced the world they
[2:13:35] experienced pain and
[2:13:37] suffering but there's hope and glory in
[2:13:41] Christ and I pray they would just change
[2:13:44] their ship right now Lord God and allow
[2:13:46] Mercy to come in Lord Lord I pray those
[2:13:48] with the Holy Ghost who may have
[2:13:50] forgotten God that Lord you would send a

[2:14:09] God not just for a move of the church

[2:38:24] understand why Sarah was
[2:38:26] laughing why was Sarah laughing it's
[2:38:29] because of all of her things God still
[2:38:31] gave her grace and gave her the promise
[2:38:33] anyhow oh God that's how the Rapture
[2:38:35] will be to us brother man called it
[2:38:37] rapturing Grace to
[2:38:40] us it's not going to be because of our
[2:38:42] actions one of these moments we're going
[2:38:44] to be changed
[2:38:47] and it'll be Rapture in grace to our
[2:38:50] hearts and we'll be able to finally do
[2:38:52] that that one
[2:38:57] laugh when when Sarah finally had that
[2:39:01] son when the promised son finally came
[2:39:05] there was no time for
[2:39:07] Tears there was not time for
[2:39:10] sadness all the pain was behind her now
[2:39:14] cuz she had the son
[2:39:16] one of these days Lord the Bible says we
[2:39:19] will meet the Lord in the
[2:39:22] air we'll meet you in the air Lord God
[2:39:26] and we'll leave behind all the pain and
[2:39:28] the Suffering The doubts and the fears

[2:39:48] day there'll be no more time for
[2:39:51] crying there won't be no
[2:39:53] sadness and I wonder if we'll finally

[2:41:11] that tells us we don't deserve it and
[2:41:15] sometimes we walk this life we feel
[2:41:17] unworthy but Lord we lift our hands as a
[2:41:21] sign of surrender saying Lord I receive
[2:41:25] your
[2:41:26] grace and I want your grace and mercy to
[2:41:29] work and change in my life more and more
