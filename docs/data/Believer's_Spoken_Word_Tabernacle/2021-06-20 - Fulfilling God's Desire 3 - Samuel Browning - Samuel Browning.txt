so appreciate each and every one of you and just tremendous examples of god's grace in this hour i want to just look here in the scripture and i'm just going to just try to move right back in where we stopped last week in psalms and verse 14. if you don't mind i'm not going to read that that whole passage of scripture but i want to just begin at verse 14 and to to draw from there in psalms 80 and verse 14 return we beseech thee oh god of host look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the branch that thou made it strong for thyself it is burned with fire it is cut down and they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou made is strong for thyself so will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call upon thy name turn us again o lord god of hosts cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved amen may god bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated we as we've been looking at this part and i want to just hit a few points that in review and i'm not going to labor on these points but just to where we've come from of even in last week and we've been looking at god god has an expectation for our lives we we many times we we we as we've talked about that we see many times we're expecting god i'm lord i'm expecting you to do this but remember god is also has an expectation for us that god has already he's done everything that needs to be done he has he has paid the price for everything and he is raised up and he's seated on the right hand of power and authority so everything all that whatever your need could be he's already provided for it and you know as you can look in the scriptures many times it says uh you know he was he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed and he goes on to say in psalms 103 that i'm the lord that healeth all thine diseases i'm glad he just didn't list them because then you'd have to have addendums to that or amending and everything else but god's got it covered don't matter what comes up it's covered under the awe all has got it covered is that right so we find that this expectation that god would have of our lives that is a desire that that our lives would bring forth fruit of of the lord that it would be an expression of his life working in us to bring out what he already has sown in our lives we can't do that of our own accord that takes the operation of the quickening power of god moving through that channel that seed of god that he placed within us to release every leaf every apple all that is in there it takes god to come and to release that through our lives and our part is yielding to him amen so we then we looked at the the the part that the ground itself because david is writing and calling back to memory of how that god brought this vine out of egypt and we recognize they were in egypt they were always the vine of god but it could never be expressed when they were in the wrong ground so we looked at that even last week on those two parts that you know the the even when it comes to the parable of the sower of the seed that there is ordained ground when god sends his word to a generation there is ordained ground that in the scripture god refers to that as good ground that that upon that good ground that here the word itself will find its place in that life now that good ground is that seed it's the choice soil for the word to come to it's it's as the prophet would call it in one place the womb and here it is of where that the spirit of god will come and raise that life up and begin to express through that life there is one part of a good ground but then there's also within when that ground itself and the life is pulsating within that it cannot pulsate within that without them being and dwelling within the good ground or the choice ground and that is in christ is that right for we are all baptized into one body by one spirit we don't join this we we don't come into a place that we learn enough to be a part of it that this is not what it is it is a sovereign work of the holy spirit that god drawing on your heart to bring you to the place that he has prepared for you where the very expression of who you are as a son and daughter of god can really be made manifest that can never be made manifest down in egypt you can never be manifest as a son and daughter of god while dwelling in the world and we're not just talking about outside of the church walls to dwell in the world is still to be under that first birth and allowing it to reign in your life that's still an egyptian bondage but the spirit of god comes to lead you out from under the taskmaster and oppression of sin into the glorious liberty in christ himself in the holy ghost that that life on the inside might begin to express what god always knew and thought about you that's an overcoming life and so then as we we look at this we see of how that david you know in expressing to god that you would find where israel would you know israel how that god would visit them and you know they would go astray and god would visit them and then they would come back and then they would go astray and then they would come back there was a call here there's something more that was needed and this is where in the channel we were starting to work with last week there was something more that was needed because they offered up the provided sacrifices of and as brother braham says the land of palestine was bathed in the blood of heifers and lambs and everything but you see that blood could only cover it can never fully deal with the sin question because that blood itself it could allow man to come into a place of fellowship with god but it was only a type of the fellowship that god desired to bring his children back into and that's in a fellowship that could only come through and by the blood of the lamb of god where the life within that blood cell could come back upon the worshipper and call them into a place of fellowship where they're not under condemnation where they actually there is in a place of of authority it's a place that they're not trying to hold on or if i can just do this it's different we're no longer under the strength of our first nature that first nature has a strength but this is why that that first nature has to die that strength has to perish in order that god's strength can come in and fully manifest itself in the power of the resurrection he doesn't raise up the old man he raises up that seed that son or daughter of god that's on the inside the same one who revealed himself to john i'm he who was dead and i'm alive forevermore you and i were dead in sin and trespasses but now that the holy ghost has come the quickening power to raise you up you can say i once was dead but now i am alive in christ [Applause] i've received a greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world something more was needed and then we looked into that part of the right conditions that were needed in the condition that god himself would would would would come and and return it there you know god will always come where he's invited and you know a hunger itself brother brown will talk about this and as believers and as you listen to the message and and and even in the scripture it says blessed are they who do hunger and thirst for righteousness you couldn't have a hunger unless there was already something to meet that hunger the bible said the deep call it to the deep at the noise of thy water spouts before there could ever be a hungering for god there was a god there to make himself real to you and i there was something about it that maybe you stumbled in as brother branham put it at a mission one night and you gave your life to god and there was a hungering there was a calling but yet within that there's something more you just couldn't be satisfied there's a hunger that god put in you and it's that hunger that was in you that would not allow you to get content or comfortable in any other place you were meant to live in christ you weren't meant and ordained for a church life that's not what you were meant for you were meant to be an expression of the living god in this hour in this generation you were meant to be god's advertisement in this hour that is still the same yesterday today and forever he still delivers he still heals the sick he still feels with the holy ghost he still breaks chains your life is an advertisement there's no greater advertisement than the power of god moving through your life it's the right conditions of a heart that's hungering and in desperation for god so when we come into this here this morning and i in psalms 80 verse 14 here david here he is under inspiration now you you realize this as a bible reader david is under an inspiration this is a this is inspiration that is prophecy of even when israel themselves will come into their rightful position as the 144 thousand and you see that that'll break right in and the psalms and hosea all the way through the old the old testament and here david is calling for this place return we beseech thee oh god of host look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine now when you look at this return return return oh god it would seem as though that he is the one that's went away but god didn't drift god didn't drift away it was the people that drifted away is that right you see this is why that we must have a type host this is why that the baptism of the holy ghost is an absolute in your life paul would write of it an anchor of the soul that reaches within the veil why do you put an anchor on a boat not for decorations is that right you don't put it on there brother chad you don't put on there for decorations i've been out there with you guys you guys put put them anchored down and at times we can be fishing out there and all of a sudden where we thought we're on the shoreline like man i'll tell you what look at that ride there cedar point finally you start realizing hey where'd that ride go we were at a cedar point why it starts drifting without an anchor this is why there must come an anchor in a life because it anchors us in him we can drift only so far are you hearing me you can drift only so far that's why even at times in your life you can get cool as a believer you can only drift so far and god will pull back his presence he'll pull his presence back why because you and i were meant to live in his presence and there's something about a believer when there's just it can be everything else that's going right but when they don't have the presence of god in their life it's like everything's wrong because it's him that makes everything right [Applause] hallelujah glory be to god so when we look at this that it was not god that drifted they had drifted so you know a drift it can be so subtle as we were looking at that then you can begin to allow other things to begin to take preeminence or first place which we we recognize to backslide that's to get cool now don't draw back on that word because i want you to remember when we talk about backsliding we're talking about cooling off are you hearing me i'm not just talking about you know in and out and in and out because when we're looking at backsliding you know this is where as the prophet would he would take us in the scripture that the prayer of a righteous man availeth much and he would begin to speak of this he said now a righteous man is not a sinless man but he said a righteous man is one who confesses his wrong see stays in a place then think of it the prayer the prayer of a righteous man of the fervent prayer not just a prayer let me back there that was pressing on my heart a fervent prayer means a boiling up you know that of where it's a zeal of a passion how does a man stay in that kind of a state because there is a place of cleansing where you can stay clean and refreshed and you can wash and you can bathe in the washing of water by the word hey you know how easy it is to accumulate things clean out your car one time right clean out your basement one time or your other room or whatever one time or your drawer sister's in your kitchen that's just your catch-all drawer look how fast that those things can pile up over time i'll just put this here i'll just put this here things can pile up awful quickly is that right and you see so then this is where there must be a continual cleansing let me say this friends this is something that's personal to you and i just coming to church won't do it you see it just coming coming the house of god is very important but you've got to live and you've got to stay in that presence that's what jude said building yourself up in your most holy faith faith praying in the holy ghost keeping yourselves in the love of god let me just tell you like this it's a battle to live there every day because this flesh is under there's a there is an anointing and a spirit upon this age and the spirit upon this age is not just a spirit only for people's rights but it's a spirit that's on the last day that is a spirit that seeks for soft easy living think about it what kind of an age are we in most neurotic age there is the prophet would say it like this he says it's an age that is unfit for humans to live in thank god there's a place that we can go to and let off the pressure hallelujah there's a place that we can dwell and we can come into that place and look to god and ask the lord and you know as brother bran would put it he said this is where he said if paul had to die daily then so must we die daily we have to repent daily i'm not looking for things to repent for are you with me you see i'm not just running and saying oh god forgive me and not well i don't even know what i'm asking for we recognize that there are things day in and day out that i'm not talking about willful sin if there's still willful sin you need to get your soul under the blood come on friends this is the truth this is the gospel of the hour if the desire of sin is still there you need to get down at the altar and stay there until that desire is quenched in your life don't baby it don't pet it don't make excuses for it let him come down and kill it that's exactly right see and then in that spot this is where we live then in the presence of god inviting his presence to wash our lives to dress our lives to tend to our lives oh my lord jesus help me so it's constant that we have to live in the presence of almighty god you see this is where in the book of hosea how god would say in hosea i will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their offense and seek my face in their affliction they will seek me early so god's departure is a lifting of his presence the scripture also says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption is that right so when we begin to look at these of how that the drifting and things would begin to move aside from there brethren would take this even in the ephesian age and you know let me just say it like this if as paul would write under inspiration it would show in the scriptures where he would talk about that a good soldier does not entangle himself with the cares or the affairs of this life that he might please him who hath called him and once again that is a battle to stay cut free from things that would like to wrap around your life and keep you grounded are you with me it's things you know that how that the enemy would like to come in that way good people sometimes with good intentions can get tangled up are you with me so we're not here you know with our head up and our nose up so we can catch a bucket of water this morning we recognize we need the grace of god the discernment of the holy ghost in our life we don't want to walk by our own intellects our own reasonings our own thoughts on things we need the discernment of the holy ghost we're living in an hour where there are things that are called good that are absolutely evil this is one of the most deceptive age since that of the garden of eden come on now we're things that's looked at and presented as though this is good and this is okay but it's filled with death is that right now you see what begins to happen you know brother brown takes it in this manner and he'll talk about how that the fervent desire to please god a fervent desire in other words that you care what god cares about you care what he thinks about things come on it ain't fillers out here and what does brother so and so and what the sister so and so you might be talking to somebody that's really backslide and you might be trying to ask what they think about it you can have a firsthand audience with almighty god if you really want to please him you go to him and you can ask him lord what do you think about this because when it's all said and done if that life goes off that way and you follow it god is not going to excuse you for following them when the right way has been set before you it's funny sometimes how spirits they will want to align like it isn't brother ram talked about in the service you could take an epileptic demon it'll begin to call for another call for another what's it trying to do bring reinforcements brother we don't want to align with spirits of this world we want our souls our lives to be aligned with the spirit of the living god oh my the passion brother bram talks about the passion to know his word i'm going to ask you to raise your hand but when's the last time you prayed for god to reveal himself to you you see when you can look back at that and say well my you know it's been some time it's there's there's a waning of the passion a passion you know somebody that's passionate about something you don't have to ask them get around them for a little bit you'll know what they're passionate about is that right it comes out their life is all wrapped up into it this is god's desires that you and i would be passionate in serving him it's a life filled with passion amen for his word oh and brother bram said the cry for reaching out in the spirit is all but gone becomes a less watchful attitude now let me let me move on here you see when david would begin to speak call for this return oh god i want you to look at three scriptures here that are in this passage right here you see there they're going to invite him return return we beseech thee o lord of hosts o god of host now notice in verse 3 of psalms 80 turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved go down to verse seven same words except in the middle o god of hosts in verse 19 the last verse turn us again o lord god of host it is what it is the condescension of elohim he who dwell alone now god of hosts with the angels and with his children and now come down in flesh in the flesh not just in jesus christ but in the flesh and tabernacling in his sons and daughters of god this is the accident this is the spirit of god that is calling out in david david here a man that did not live in a time that you and i live in he did not experience the redemptive power of the holy ghost like you and i experienced it david said i've heard thy word in my heart that i might not sin against thee but david never received the water of life that the word would become a reality in his life but still he was in contact and inspiration with god that his life could be in such harmony that it would recognize this is the very desire of almighty god oh my cause thy face you see this is one thing turn us again turn us again cause thy face to shine it it comes to this place but unless god moves the bible says except the lord build the house david labor labor in vain there there are many many that even in looking at the scripture to be fulfilled scriptures even of this age and we've spoke a little bit about this that you find that even before it happened the same way before the lord jesus as well you had men rise up and claim to be the messiah and led people off into the wilderness that was only a distraction that was trying to take away from the real that would come is that right it's the same way with the ministry that god promised and has sent in this hour the ministry of malachi 4. this is why you had all those who rose up before of elijah's mantle and elijah's robe and this and that and alexander dowey and all the rest of them you see there there were many of them that were were good people they were good men but the thing of it is when we're looking at a promise of god it's also to have patience for jesus said in patience ye possess ye your souls so a patience is not you know just wandering around and you know well lord you just tapped me on the shoulder you know sometimes you've been waiting on somebody to show up at your house and you just tell your wife hey you know what text me when they get here right just text me when they get here call me when they get here right because they're not on time you don't know where they're at there might be a few other things that you want to do jesus doesn't work that way are you with me this is an hour to be watching and waiting the bible said be ready for you know not what hour that the son of man cometh so the patience is not wandering around but the patience is locked in steadfast and waiting on god to fulfill his promise and in the meantime allowing the word to prepare us for the word that we're waiting on glory be to god you see the word holds the preparation for our life this is why david could write turn us again he realized we we in ourselves we cannot turn ourselves you realize for you to repent it wasn't that something it was a good idea that struck your life the bible says the goodness of god leadeth to repentance is that right it takes the spirit of god dealing with the heart dealing with the life to begin to turn that life around it's the same thing it takes the spirit of god bringing conviction in our life to convict us of where we are wrong where we are falling short and then to help us to see this is the place that i have for you and here is the pathway to that place and that's every service amen that's every service cause thy face to shine so we need him to shine in the fulfillment of his word because when he shines it is the fulfillment of his word so god god is expressing through david turn us again so it's going back it's it's thinking back it going back to how that god's god's desire where he would move among them in his power you see it was not a mighty hand of man that brought him out of egypt it was the mighty hand of god amen hallelujah it was god's power that moved down in his word and the people caught it and they recognized it so it's to remember remembering back you know this is why let me just say this to you this is why the hour that we're living in when god would tell the ephesian age that first church age that was already a fallen woman remember from whence thou art fallen go back in your mind go back to the time of of where of purity going back in your mind where there was a real consecration and and look from where you drifted how many knows that's not comfortable when you have to sit there and look and you have to first of all acknowledge there's been a little drift now listen to me now don't don't don't don't tuck your head between your knees and oh poor me poor me that ain't repentance come on now it's part of responsibility it's like i tell my boys at home don't hang your head you own it you own it you take responsibility for it be a man come on now don't be passing the buck on somebody else and if this no own it it's responsibility is that right you see part of that then we look at how that they drifted from that and god tells them remember of what you were but you know god doesn't leave that memory up to a man's mind god had messengers in that day paul even though he had passed off the scene was the messenger to that ephesian age he was the messenger that would be the pattern that every other true messenger and minister of god would be patterned like is that right one of the seven stars in the right hand of god now remember it is not the church that brings the man on the scene it is not the church that says my we need a move of god then this guy right here he's the one that's going to bring it that's a move of man and it'll die because it started with man but when one of those stars that are in the right hand when god sees that it's time that my church remember who they are god don't send them a picture god don't send them a bunch of letters he brings himself down in the ministry of those seven stars brother he ain't leaving it up to this man's mind and wonder what this is like and wonder what's life that's like god does not catch his eagles by the imagination of man his eagles are caught when he himself begins to fly over in the fulfillment of his word his children begin to say that's my daddy that's my papa [Applause] now let me get to this age the scripture said there would be a prophet raising it would raise up lacking unto moses is that right the opening of malachi 4 remember ye the law of moses hallelujah what to come into the full promises of god is that right we are headed into a body change we are headed back to we're headed to the millennium is that right so here in this hour god it had to come with such clarity because the church is not just you know in the very beginning stages but the church coming in full maturity and in order for the church there to be a uniting because the scripture said that there must be a uniting with that of the word whereby that let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come then in order to for that of the marriage of the lamb then the lamb himself must be present and the lamb is not a church but the lamb is the word the holy ghost himself my my my the son of man revealed in this generation and you think of it that you and i here we are standing in this time and god coming down through a prophetic anointing remember what a prophet is called to do there is a gift they are they are ordained by god to see and look past as brother braham said be on the music beyond the church beyond the creed they are ordained by god to look back into their my my mama they're ordained to look back into there just like a man who's standing outside of a circus and that man everybody else can't see in but that man has the ability to get above that fence he can begin to describe things that are inside of that fence he's describing it to the people that are there are you with me god sent a prophet in this hour in the fulfillment of his word he did not leave the interpretation of what a real son and daughter of god is into the minds of man it scrupled it up but god had a prophet in this hour in the fulfillment of his word he could pick him up and let you and i know we were always a thought of god we were always a gene of god we were always a son and daughter of god are you with me [Applause] [Music] you take away the ministry of the prophet you take away the glory of jesus christ because it releases the glory of his redemptive grace it's not a man's word coming in the church it's the word of the living god this is why david said turn us again oh god god of host oh lord god of hosts it's god condescending down well before there was time there was the eternal there was the word and we were there with him in his thoughts i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying to behave but when he comes it just does something to me this cry brother richie for heavenly things you know when you begin to cry for heavenly things you might say well brother samuel i've cried for a new house or i've cried well there ain't nothing wrong with asking god for those things but when you begin to cry for heavenly things when you begin to cry from heaven for for heavenly things then you see it's god moving upon that heart it'll be met with heavenly things amen when hearts are desiring to be lined up with god in his word he said i'll hear from heaven then are you with me you see let me go here into this part of the scripture the bible says we beseech thee oh god of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine they needed a heavenly visitation they didn't need an earthly visitation they needed a heavenly visitation now all the roots that were within earth couldn't do it it was searched all over is there a man worthy are you with me i couldn't find no one worthy is that right so look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine they needed a visitation this is what i'm coming to they needed a visitation you know when you think of the word visit if i told you you know brother brian if i said i'm going to come to your house and visit you brother willie if i said i'm going to come visit you if i show up on your doorstep and i've got a u-haul behind me you think this guy didn't come to visit he came to stay is that right that's how we look at visit like if i'm going to come to your house and we sit down you know and have coffee i'm going to come there for a period of time and then i'm going to leave that's not how god visits his people god don't just come and just leave god comes with a purpose when god comes to make a house call or make a visit it's because there's some hearts that are moving and he himself his presence is just moving when you know when that word is getting ready to be fulfilled it releases it's like an energy that gets released a divine energy it begins to stir let's think of it think of how that when the ducks and everything else when there's going to be an earthquake nobody's out there sounding them on the alarm matter of fact they probably won't even trust the weather men we do trust they don't they don't go by that there is something within them they are alerted to go to gathering they get away from the walls when an earthquake is coming what is it you know like brother ram said nature calls it instinct i call it god god put that within them just like those of you that are deer hunters you know you know people can say you're crazy looking at the moon or a high pressure system or a low pressure system you know deer and other wildlife move ahead of a front after it passes through they come out again now fish i don't know i just go according to y'all but you realize there's something that is about that that you don't have to go tell the deer hey guess what there is a storm coming or snow's coming you don't have to tell them that they're in tune with the pressure that is going on around them hallelujah if animal life can be in tune with those atmospheric conditions what about the believer when the word is in a part of fulfillment brother there's an atmosphere that's being released [Applause] hallelujah oh my god begins to stir his children now when we look at this that visitation it ain't like what you and i and what we do when we visit god he comes and he remains so the real purpose let me just set this before i run through some scriptures the real purpose of a visitation is that his word might be fulfilled that's a visit from god and he will always come in the fulfillment of his word think about abraham and sarah here they are sitting before the tent door and here god comes down with two angels god don't have a placard on his chest i'm god abraham abraham was walking in step with him and he recognized there's something spiritual about this man is that right and he began to entertain him he didn't just say hey i'm glad you came down today man it's wonderful he moved to entertain him you see this was a time god had already spoke to him in the previous chapter and other times but god had laid out a promise from the beginning that it start to come a little bit more clear to where god had told him in the previous chapter that i'm going to visit sarah in the set time next next you know in the oncoming year i'm going to visit her is that right and so he was waiting for that visitation he was there and when god made himself known abraham moved to entertain him now notice god came down and for and now when the scripture as it stands there we find that how that god is standing there and he begins to speak to abraham and he's asking his whole purpose of this visit is sarah glory be to god where is sarah thy wife he didn't say where is hagar hagar's not even in mentioned in the promise amen where is sarah thy wife and here god begins to express i'm going to visit her at the set time you know next month and sarah in her heart laughed why she's looking at herself sarah doesn't know who this is oh let me preach now brother branham says there in the tent that morning there was a little bit of a scuffle a little bit of words were exchanged we'll say it like brother john lafontaine we won't call it arguing we'll be a little bit more self-righteous we'll call it heated fellowship and sarah now look how brilliant puts us is it to anything too hard for the lord he said sarah had begin to look at the caravan that was carrying this certain types of clothing down to sodom and she began to ask abraham hey look at what they're getting down there do you think this would be all right do you think this and abraham was stood there and told her sarah that is not for something that we are to be a part of oh my aren't you glad the word was able to stand there in that time get back in step we're not to be a part of sodom it stood right there amen our husband the word is there brother when he took the veil off and he put it there on his shoulder we are depending and resting in him he's the one who's watching over our lives [Applause] satan would like to try to get us tied up before the promise comes to pass but oh let us look to our husband the word the holy spirit is there to direct us and guide us sarah recognizes this is missing more than a man this is more than a man only god can know what's in my heart but the god who knew what was in her heart was there on a visitation to dissolve the doubt glory be to god see god comes with a purpose his visitation was to dissolve the doubt in sarah's heart come on now you see abraham's faith oh my i just got to preach a little bit you see abraham's faith brother ram tells us in believing god he said it never really was sarah's faith that performed the promise it was abraham's faith but you see abraham's faith had been placed upon that generation and it was not abraham himself it was the faith of almighty god that was moving down through sarah's heart this is why the scripture could say that she judged him faithful you see god had dispensed that and she was abiding under that word under that life under that faith it had an effect on her life it was a visitation she received a visitation some time went on by things happened right they journeyed on down to goreer but here comes in genesis 21 1 and the lord visited sarah this time he wasn't he didn't come in that flesh body he used but he was riding the same trail again preach with me now and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken now let me tell you something sarah wasn't just standing there you know like somebody with strings on the word that had went forth brother under that visitation when god was standing there present in flesh that word had so gripped her heart to where she judged him faithful and the bible said she received strength to conceive that's the only way you get anywhere with god that's the only way the holy ghost comes that's the only way every promise comes is you must judge him faithful who made the promise for sarah conceived and bear abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him my here in genesis 50 verse 24 here's joseph on his here he is down in egypt remember there's a promise that god had made to abraham and now here is joseph down there in egypt jacob's already passed and here is joseph and joseph makes this statement to his brethren and he said i die and god will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swear to abraham to isaac and to jacob now i'm not going to read the rest of verses but jacob joseph let him know don't you leave me here you take my bones with you amen amen though i've gone by the way of the grave the promise is sure because god made the promise abraham didn't make the promise god made the promise and joseph was tied in to the same god who spoke to his great-grandfather abraham glory be to god oh my then we find here here you find moses here he comes here's a period of time 400 years now 40 years after the 400 years now remember why was that 40 years 40 is a type of a generation is that right because when moses came down there and you know he slew that egyptian they rejected him you see any time there's a rejection look what happened when it came time to cross over into the land of canaan had to let that generation die off right god will not take in a generation anything that's disobedient to his word god can't work with anything that doubts his word is that right this is why he could speak of caleb caleb had a different spirit from the rest of him because caleb fully followed the lord is that right so we find how here god comes down and he says he speaks to to to moses this is what i want you to say he says let me jump to the end of verse 16 of exodus 3 i have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in egypt and i have said i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites now as we go on here you find that here remember god sends aaron out to meet moses is that right he sends him out to meet moses and he says to moses aaron will be your spokesman now aaron aaron can't be moses spokesman if he's saying something different from moses so whoever wants to claim to be aaron you say something different from moses it might be aaron but it's the aaron of a golden calf preach with me now because we are not turned back to idol worship we are not turned back to the worship of man come on now this message never came to cause a man or a personality to be exalted god will not share his glory or his worship with any man he said i am god alone is that right so a real aaron is what god says through the prophet in the message spoken word his original seed he said there stood moses with the vindicated word and his help mate standing right beside him who is the helpmate of the prophet it is the wife of the lord jesus where the spirit of the living god is pulsating through in the same original glory and power and vesture it is the helpmate of almighty god what is the help mate it is the womb in order to bring his promise through [Applause] we're not filled with empty words it's the spirit of god moving in our life hallelujah it's a word that's pulsating in our heart and our life brother this pride is the final voice to the final age under her messenger [Applause] nobody in between i don't care how good they are how fancy they are nobody in between [Music] are you with me under the messenger is to be under the word is to be under the blood [Applause] come on now glory be to god because it is that word that comes through the messenger that reveals the provided approach to the throne of almighty god are you with me it opens the pathway back into sonship it opens the pathway come on now it opens the pathway across that of the laver to let you see here's the pathway through the blood of the lord jesus christ into a real union with almighty god [Music] my let me get back to my scripture here aaron stood there and here aaron performs the signs that god gave to the prophet is that right but it was before the people of god now i want you to watch what the people of god said the bible said the people believed in verse 31 of exodus 4 and when they had heard that the lord had visited the children of israel and that he had looked upon their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped when they had heard he had visited you see it wasn't like oh he visited out there in the desert not just a visit out there remember he said i'm come down and behold i send you come on now his visitation it wasn't left somewhere it wasn't left out in sabino canyon come on somebody when the head was coming because the body was on earth are you with me it was coming with the visitation that the head and the body might be united together this is the marriage of the lamb is that right and the people witnessing god's visitation they weren't just looking at wow this sign wow this one you see this is where pentecostals get off they believe brother adam was a prophet but they believe it in terms of oh it's signs oh it's wonders oh he did this and he did that that ain't what a prophet is signs and wonders accompany but remember the bible tells us in the book of acts that jesus was a man approved of god among them with signs and wonders following is that right what it comes down to is is that as god told moses i'm just going to preach as it's coming what god told moses he said if they won't believe the voice of the first sign then he said it'll be the voice of the second sign is that right if they don't believe that then it'll be that of the latter you see what it was it was not the sign but it was the voice of the sign that catches the attention of the believer because there's many listen friends there's different ones now i'm going to say like this there ain't nobody that's been upon this earth that's had the ministry that god has sent to us in this last day [Applause] that's not to elevate a man that's god promised in his word it's to get what attention the attention of abraham seed i'm not talking about the natural the natural abraham seed they crucified the lord jesus when he came they couldn't recognize the word made flesh in their midst and jesus said your father abraham he said he saw my day and rejoiced to see it what did abraham see the visitation of the son of man in that day that would come under that anointing of redeemer that would then come in this last days in the fullness of his word and that's why the children of abraham are the stars that shouted for joy glory be to god that's why this word means something to you and i [Applause] by the same that's why it brings joy to our lives hallelujah hey man it means something to us it's a word from home hallelujah hallelujah when the when that dove went flying over and they were shooting that dove down there and it fell over there in germany it was carrying a message it was shot up and it was bloody it was maimed but it had a message and it fell in the camp but when one day we as abraham's children we were buried in by sin and unbelief and everything else and here came down one from whom the prophet sales he came down from home and they shot him down and they crucified him but he rose back out and he ascended on high and he sent back the holy ghost [Applause] i can't preach for preaching man hallelujah glory be to god think of this here ruth the bible says she heard there was bread in the homeland the bible says that the lord had visited them in the giving of bread is they know when god's visitation and ain't just like well here's something that took place you know it's just right out here hey this ain't no dead dead-end browns in brown's revival brownsville or whatever you say it come on friends there's been all this revival here revival there it hasn't changed nobody's life come on now i'm not putting that down but i'm saying god has a provided way i've got to preach as it's flowing from on high you see they're moving forth we want a revival want a revival david wanted a revival he sought to bring the ark of god back into jerusalem but you can't bring it outside of god's provided way it was god's desire to bring a revival but god said i'll bring my word through my prophet over the hearts of the priest god has an ordained channel and a pathway he won't bend for it from nobody so if you want revival invite the word to come the way of the word [Applause] glory be to god whoo glory heard there was given a bread over there nilma's condition is very drastic but what they're hearing is there's bread back in the homeland god has visited and there's come a crop of resurrection power barley season is here glory be to god and here was a one y'all okay man i feel like i'm just getting warmed up forgive me for a minute lord i'm loving this hallelujah you know here was a woman by the name of hannah she was known as a barren woman she cried she she sought god you know and there was one who was her adversary the bible says and mocked her scoffed at her i got more children than you this is what i want you to look at here the bible says that the lord visited hannah so that she conceived it took a visitation from god [Music] hannah i want let's look at it for a minute can we do that i wonder if you could see hannah here she is maybe around her devotions and her and you know her husband and you know and they were praying and um sister so and so that said they they'd like to have a baby could we pray for them in devotion tonight sure honey we'll pray for him and they get together and they're praying even though that's the desire in her heart see she's not wrapped up in self are you with me now let's just dramatize it a little bit is that okay that's probably how it was with zacharias and elizabeth they were taking prayer requests for other people and praying about them and god was answering prayers come on now and it seemed like they had been forgotten but god hadn't forgotten them god's got an ordained appointed time hallelujah and don't handle think of it you think at times her or elizabeth at times in their spirit they weren't maybe faster but i don't understand her lord this but there was a faithfulness on the inside of them that kept them into a place to where that the angel of the lord came down and visited zacharias and elizabeth home let me tell you something though there are many things you don't understand i don't understand they're promises that you're holding on to but god has never forgot about one of his promises what do i do stay in a place and let the atmosphere of the promise you're holding on to let it create an atmosphere that god can come and visit [Music] oh my it came that moment that hannah herself she had remained faithful and god had a reason couldn't do it any time before it had to be in this appointed season hallelujah hey listen friends this is not a bible story this is a reality of prophecy for our lives god will always fulfill his word in his time and in his season and the prophet tells us in satan's eden that our experiences are predestinated from the hand of almighty god is that right now notice this visitation coming down here notice in luke 1 68 here you find zechariah so here he is the visitations come here zacharias john has come on the scene his tongue has been loosed blessed be the lord god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people john had been born they're waiting on jesus to be born but you see the promise had already now been confirmed that here's what's to take place amen because the prophet here john was was the prophet that was to go before him in the power and the spirit of elias is that right to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children that's what it says through notice in verse 78 through the tender mercy of our god whereby the day spring former on high hath visited us to give light to them that set in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace you see israel was a vine when we read in our texts brother drake they had they had that it had burned and it had been ate down but here's the thing the life is in the roots the life is in the roots and this is why i could say visit this vine visit the vineyard that you planted with your right hand oh god visit it visit it with your strength with your power well god didn't send another you know something different down but god intended here he came as brother ram would put it this way let me just paraphrase and put these things together he says god in his own predestinated in his own great infinite mind planned the plan to put a real vine down he planted on this earth the vine the righteous vine not a denomination not a church not a creed but a man himself made flesh and he manifested his peace his power the great angel of god the great jehovah was with him and in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily and men did not believe him and disbelieve him because he would not cooperate with their creed but finally they led him away to calvary and there that blood cell was broken of the precious son of god the body in which jehovah lived there came forth a vine with its roots in glory amen how many know he is the root and offspring of david amen he came to deal with the root because the problem was in the roots amen you know you snap a weed off it'll come back if you don't get the root is that right so he came to deal with the real problem in the roots but there came one whose roots were not of the earth the roots from glory larry be the god in the eyes with its branches on earth to produce a church of the living god that would show forth his resurrection power oh he said who are these men and women that would deny the church the vine of the living god do you notice catch this that here the vine from heaven came down that what that it might release the life into that of the church of the living god is that right so it had to come in that in that manner he said now notice it's the presence of the lord jesus with his church to live and to show forth his predestinated branches that he's caught before the foundation of the earth and his church today with the glory of his resurrection living in here so he went from an ant from a type to an anatype so remember something more had to happen it took god coming down there were branches on earth that were bearing the wrong kind of fruit but he had to come down to be able to separate that life that was operating through us man there had to be an atonement that was made that his life could come back into the believer i want you to think of this here david you know when david would express this this this visitation it was a visitation from heaven and let me just let me bring this down you see without a visitation from heaven israel now this is this is when it takes place with 144 000 and god brings a ceiling to israel they are called to the true atonement by their two witnesses but i want you to i want to remind you the same message that those two witnesses preached to the 144 thousand is the message you're under yeah are you with me this is the message that calls us to the true atonement this is not of the killing of the lamb it's pointing back to the lamb that was slain is that right this is the feast of the atonement here we're called into that into that place of what's open to you and i right now is a fountain that's open in the house of david amen it's the life of almighty god the blood that's been shed to cleanse the life to make him ready think of israel think of them when they're getting off the plane some of you watch that on their their ali isles and whatever more they're getting off in their short britches and their pain all over their face and their ear bobs and hair butchered off and some of them got all kinds of hair color and everything else going on things that you can even visibly see on the right right on the outside you know that ain't of god what do you know has to happen brother it ain't just the outside that's got to be clean the inside's got to be clean there's got to come a fountain open in the house of david just knowing the law ain't enough knowing the psalms ain't enough knowing the prophets is not enough listen to me now knowing the message is not enough you've got to meet the lord jesus christ the god of this message that's the fountain that's open in the house of david you'll never get clean on your own you can try to lick your spots they only stand out the only thing you can do is ask for god there be a visitation from heaven i need a visitation from heaven in my life amen think of it i'm not i'm bringing this down i'm not just i'm not trying to take up your time these things are eternal life this is very important here not because i said it but let me say this to you there were many that saw the lord jesus in their day many that came in contact with him there's many that ate of the fishes and loaves they didn't walk on with him they enjoyed the miracles enjoyed the meals that was it that's what they enjoyed but see it wasn't life to them they didn't recognize who was behind that veil the bible says he came to his own think about it if you went to your family and you here you are your family should know you and your family says who are you and you look at them say i'm your daddy when you say i'm your mom you would look at them and say good lord they've lost their mind they don't even know who i am let me tell you something he came to his own they were holding the written word they had moses word but they didn't recognize him in their midst he came to his own and his own received him not but as many has received to him to them he gave the authority the rights to become sons and daughters of god can we look at a few of them thank you here was a woman there by the well she went out there every day you know what that was of her father jacob she got water day after day but that water never changed her life that water left her hungry but one day god himself said i must needs go by samaria she didn't know that day a trip to the well that day of who was going to be sitting there but god was coming down to visit and redeem one of his genes his redeemable thoughts back to himself and god redeems his children by the visitation of himself in the form of his word she left the whale she left the pot and she went and said come see a man who's told me everything that i've ever done no no condemnation on her life you know why because the person that went there want the same person that came from there come on now hallelujah oh my the darkness that was over her life she was always a seat of god but brother look here she is standing here she is standing she's talking to him he's talking to her she thinks this is just a jew i'm a samaritan but what did what did the word tell her if thou knewest the gift of god that speaks to you you would ask him for a drink and he'll give you a drink you will never thirst again he's letting her know who she's in the presence of what was happening this vine with roots and glory began to pulsate out and because down on the inside was a predestinated branch of almighty god it caught that pulsation i perceived i perceived not a prophet and if paul said it again and that branch responded again to the place i know that messiah cometh amen what's happening the pulsation of the life from the roots is striking that branch and that branch is responding you see it comes down to this place to receive that visitation brother brandon would tell talk to the congregation and the message desperation please just just lock in with me here just a few minutes he said if we're not careful he didn't tell people this to make him fearful he wanted him to see he said if you're not careful what's in your midst will pass right through you it's to give ourselves to him now let me just say this there's a lot of humble acts that a person can do brother branham talks about in a message desperation he said taking our shoes off won't satisfy it taking our hat off or whatever won't satisfy it but a life that brings forth the fruits amen that's humility because it's laying down our life that his life might flow through us and that's constant submission i'm i'm closing this is just tying up these loose ends but don't don't this this ain't the time for a bathroom break i'm just i'm not saying that to be funny i'm saying that because this is the thing that sometimes friends the things that we remember how brother brown says in christ the mystery he said god's trying to reveal these things to you he said but you let family you let your job you learn all these other things take it out of you see it it had already been placed there but he said you let these other things take it out of you what god is trying to reveal to you it's a battle that goes on this is why just coming to the house of god just serving the lord is not just well i've come here on sunday or i've been to church here thursday all right i've got it's it's not coming and we i've checked off my duty for the week that ain't it amen that's that's not what god that's not what a visitation of god is about it's where it takes in a reflection in our lives that where we're really honest before god we look into the word of god and lord where am i lacking where am i lacking where is it in my life that's lacking i want it lord i want my life to move on further i want my life i want i want my life to grow lord in you see this is a part of the visitation that's inviting god in to really obey his voice to take it in and pray over that word reflect over that word because his visitation he comes that his word would be fulfilled in our lives there's no greater there's no greater thing that can take place or countless number examples we could go through here in the scriptures of different ones that just through prayer that just had laid out before me different ones brother brian sung of mary be it unto me according to thy word there was a visitation that was made let me just let me just give you the contrast so maybe that'll that it lays it open if you walk out of this service today and you know even in your heart that you're not where you should be with god then you're not entertaining him it's a visitation with god entertain him as the service is going on invite him in and be honest before god says lord if there's somewhere that that you're cooled off or you're lacking invite him in and say lord jesus remedy this in my life lord strengthen me lord in those areas where i've been weak he's not ashamed he came down here this morning to speak to you and i he's desiring that fellowship you think you don't like things between you and him he don't like things between you and him his love for you and i shows us these things so that you and i can say lord forgive me cleanse me lord because why the desire is this visitation it brings a change in it there's a transformation and we are changed from glory unto glory even by the spirit of the living god amen it's a visitation not just go out and well i'll go back out you know in my life and mine wasn't that a good service and you're missing it that's not a visitation from god but a visitation is lord you've come amen amen and like a seed of abraham i'm going to entertain you you're not leaving my tent door you're not leaving my tent door hungry you're not going to have to find somewhere else for somebody will say i'll find somebody who wants me i'll find somebody who wants to feed me i find somebody who wants to give me a drink offering i'll find somebody no lord right here lord right here right here lord you've come to the right place it in the wrong address you've come to the right place lord amen it's a visitation because one of these mornings the rapture itself will be the final part of this visitation it'll be the final culminating part and brother richie everything will be finished the trials of this life that we've needed grace to make it through the hardships and and grace are where we've needed god give me strength to get through this he won't even be worthy to be compared joy won't he be worthy to be compared we'll be walking here upon this earth because that visitation has come to us and we've accepted it by his grace through a part of himself he put within us and we've entertained him sodom wants to be entertained are you hearing me sodom wants to entertain your mind sodom wants to heat you up brother samuel i've got to work i've got to live that's right but paul said they that live in this world as using it yet not abusing it amen walk as a real steward of god this is a visitation this is a special visitation say brother samuel this is coming at me this is coming at me how do i get me on this how do i get beyond that look unto jesus whatever you go through whatever test whatever trial whatever trouble whatever anything that comes up there is nothing nothing that can be accomplished without him amen he came he came to minister to all of our needs brother braham said if we can recognize why he's appearing in these services for us to release the desires that we have in him god knows the desire that you have jairus recognized him it released the power of resurrection in his home is that right mary magdalene she recognized him it released forgiveness to her all you got to do is recognize him he knows what you have need of and he becomes all things all things to us as believers amen let's bow our heads i think god he spoke soul he soaked so personally i'd say that as we look and the evaluation of our lives oh every thought in his presence hearts it's made known but god you know god doesn't god doesn't bring things to our attention to condemn us but god comes and he you bring conviction in his presence there's things that he comes to deal with our lives he comes to speak very very personally to a heart and he speaks to every one of us ev every person that's that's gathered here under the sound of my voice whether you're here a way of internet and you archive this service or whatever it might be god comes to speak very personally to us as his children the very anytime a thought or feeling would be in our lives as though that i'm doing all right i'm doing pretty good that's a dangerous spot to be in not that you should be in a place to say oh i'm terrible i'm right no no but you always want to recognize your need of more of him lord i need more of you i need more you always want to evaluate him as he's he passes through these services right through the word things that he's dealt with your heart and struck your heart on my those things you don't even have to wait till the end of the service right there he's there to meet you right at your seat right as the words coming forth you can there can be a real a real repentance and a reconciliation right there that would take place but i would i would say here in this time in the season that we're in there's no doubt there's hearts that are setting here that you know you need a visitation from god you say lord as every head is bowed and every eye closed lord i need a visitation from heaven [Music] amen god bless your hands i need a visitation from heaven lord amen maybe you've got a little weak maybe you're sick in your body maybe you cooled off a little bit maybe there's doubts that you've entertained maybe behind hands maybe there's lives that's sitting here i don't doubt that that lies that they they need a full work full redemptive work in their life need they need the holy ghost but i want you to understand something the holy ghost isn't something that you reach out and take a hold of the holy ghost is the is the living god who comes to take a hold of your life but he comes to take a hold of what you've surrendered to him right you can right there whether you sit in your seat whether you're at an altar it really the position in this building is not what matters it's the position of your heart if you in your heart right there can say lord i lay aside everything of this world i lay it all down lord i want to be united with you lord jesus and really mean that from your heart he'll come meet you right there just like david when he spoke under inspiration return oh we beseech the god of hosts look down from heaven behold and visit this vine he'll come he'll come right to your life god bless your hand lord jesus go right to that life lord amen and we're going to pray i know throughout this building there were hands that were lifted up earlier i said god i need a visitation from heaven and we're believers we know that we're not just asking for that we want to have just a feeling even though he can bring emotion he can bring feeling we feel his presence here right now but even if you didn't feel it he's here but in real honesty lord i need a visitation from

middle-aged lord move on the hearts of the older ones oh god let the pulsation lord of this vine with its roots and glory lord let it move down lord god and stir such a hunger lord for the reality of the living god i pray lord jesus the lord would invite you into a place of god to where you move down and step into the innermost part of that life lord in the new birth lord god granted lord jesus
