so we've been with you in all the services and uh have enjoyed the ministry that god has given us in this last day amen this is our heads go to him in the word of prayer heavenly father we thank you lord this morning god for this opportunity for us to be gathered together in your name lord we ask god that you would have your way in this service lord may lord you anoint me they're gone that you can speak lord the thought which you've placed upon my heart your god that would be a help to the people dear god encouragement i pray in jesus christ's name we ask amen i'd like to read from psalms 47 verse 2 through 4. what i would like to speak on this morning is knowing who you are for the lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all the earth and he shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feet he shall choose our inheritance for us the excellency of jacob whom he loved now if you can turn with me to romans chapter 9 verse 10-13 not only this when rebecca had conceived by one even our father isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elders shall serve the younger as it is written jacob have i love but esau have i hated may be seated i know we live in a time where you know as we're coming closer down to the end satan's just going to put on more and more pressure and there's the pressures of the world the uh pressures of life i guess i should say that are honest and uh uh satan many times will take things that there are pressures on us and they make like a mountain out of a molehill and he'll just worry your mind over things but then we deal with a lot of other things we deal with things that some people deal with anxiety because of something that's causing it you realize there are other people who deal with anxiety and there's nothing tangible that they can put it to why they're suffering from that or depression or whatever it's just something it's it's a disease just like cancer or or high blood pressure or diabetes or whatever there's diseases of the mind and these uh individuals uh uh you'd say you can't tell them well you know god's gonna take care of everything that they're not worried about that they can't help that they're feeling this because there's a it's a disease but we know that the lord that the bible says that god is the lord that healeth all of our diseases so it's not just those of of the body but those of the mind as well and we must lean on him for those things and in this time of going through so many tests and trials and you're being tried because friends we're coming down to the end and once we once we go from this realm to the next realm your trials are over all right but you've got to have your trials here so that you can be perfected because once you reach that other side you're supposed to be perfect there's no more working on your character then there's no more working on on on on your being it all that's done here and now and uh after the marriage supper when we go into the time of the millennium why it's not character building time it's time to rule and reign and so now we go through things to build our character and to make us ready to reign and the thing that that will help you going through all these things is knowing who you are because when you know who you are then you know where you stand and you know what you can depend upon and in this day satan look he never gives up he uh he clocks in every day right on time and he's right there waiting on you and you know he's been around a lot longer than you have and he's known a lot more people than you've ever known and so he knows about every trick in the book and he's there constantly trying to tell people you're not no you're not god he's there to point at every mistake you make and every fault you have to point it out and say see i told you so you know and he don't care if you sit on the pews here he don't care if you come to church regularly and sit on these pews as long as you don't receive the word that's coming forth but when you know who you are then you know the word that's coming forth is for you [Applause] and that's something that satan can't combat because the province said when the bride realizes who she is she would be an invincible army that not even satan would be able to come against her but it's not by our might or our power but it's that there's greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world there's a power that resides in me that that is not of me it's of him [Applause] amen and that's how we overcome now there's something that before either boy was born esau or jacob that god had already chose jacob neither boyd had a chance to do evil or good but god had already chose jacob and he he loved jacob and it's because he knows the beginning from the end he knows what's in your heart he knows what brother branham said he knows what you it doesn't matter what you say he knows what you mean from your heart and he knew jacob's heart before jacob even had a heart to beat now think of david when david come against goliath one of the things you can draw from that is david knew where he was standing david knew who was on his side he didn't rely on the the armor that saul tried to offer him or the sword or all these things but instead he relied on the god and he and he relied on it by experience when you truly experience something friends the devil can't take that from you when you've had a real experience with god you can stand on that and the devil can't persuade you from it you've had the experience and david had had the experience of having god come down and helping kill a bear and help him kill alive so he said who is this this philistine to come against the armies of god and he used what he knew when satan comes against your friends don't don't try to reason with him because he's too good of a reasoner just use what you know use what you're already familiar with it's just like when uh john ryan came before brother brandon to be prayed for and he didn't receive his sight brother branham said you just go forth saying by his stripes i'm healed john ryan didn't look for something else he just kept using that over and over he depended on it he didn't get to say well i've said this many times now maybe it ain't gonna come to pass no he just kept saying it that's all he knew so he just kept using what he knew buy his stripes on him extra extra he read all about it by his stripes on hill until one time when the barber and the men were going to make fun of him and he said by his stripes i'm healed then the healing came and he received his sight but friends the hilly was there all the time but john ryan had to go through it this way god could have healed him right on the spot give him his eyesight right then and there but why did he do it because god knew what john ryan needed to go through and also god knew there was a barber out there that needed to be put in his place now unless god elected you you couldn't be a christian today pardon me it wasn't you calling god it was god that called you it wasn't you looking for god it was god that came after you and you know what god knows what it took to get you he knew what he was going to have to do he knew what would have to come your way he knew what he'd have to let come your way friends listen the devil can't even do nothing without it in the end bringing glory to god the devil afflicts somebody with sickness and god turns around and heals them and it's glory to god [Applause] i heard one some years and years ago brother tim pruitt say you know when you get sick just look at that as an opportunity to get healed hallelujah when you get bound just look at it as an opportunity to be delivered it's an opportunity for god to do a work in your life when you're going when you're going through the valley and it looks like you ain't ever going to get out of it just realize it's an opportunity for god to do something in your life [Applause] that's where god really works on us it's down in the valley and satan can't do anything unless god allows him to do it to you anyway so in the end like i said it's just going to bring glory to god when god called you it showed he elected you and then you accepted that call that shows who you are you might i i don't know each of your spiritual standing today there might be some here standing and say well brother i'm not sure whether i got the holy host or not but if god's called you that shows you're elected and if you're elected then you will receive the holy ghost you are ordained to satan can't prevent it friends there's i'm telling you this morning there is going to be a rapture i know that satan sometimes tries to work on people's minds especially in this day and time an era where we've got people that are turning their backs on the message and walking away from it and then satan comes and says well what do you think is this really real or not what if this is all just a big hoax and there ain't going to be anything and once you die you're dead no there's going to be a rapture and i'm going to tell you something none of satan's reasoning nothing satan can do is going to be able to stop it from happening [Applause] and satan can't stop you from getting the holy ghost if you're if you accepted the call friends you will the holy ghost is a promise to you it's a gift it isn't based on something that you do there's nothing you have to do to receive the holy ghost because it is a gift god gives it [Applause] all you got to do is accept the gift what is the one thing god asked us to do believe he asks us to believe abraham when god called him it wasn't on any merits that abraham had ever done it wasn't because abraham was a good man it wasn't because abraham wanted it right it wasn't because abraham was seeking after it it was because god chose abraham and god come down and talk to abraham and said i've chosen you out of all the people of the world i've chosen you to be the one to be the father of a nation [Applause] and by you and by your wife sarah her being past the age of 65 she's going to have a child it's going to be a boy and from there is where it's going to come my people i chose you to bring it to pass it isn't because you've done anything it's because of what god did you're not here by your merits god didn't look down and say i think they're a pretty good person i'll call on them god don't do things just fly off the handle i've been around people that just do things just just off the cuff you know they just they don't never make no plans for anything yes are you having a cookout for the fourth i don't know at the last minute they're running around trying to get stuff together to have a cookout god don't do things that way he knows the beginning from the end god has plans and he has plans for you listen to me it doesn't matter if you look and say well i i was trying to do this or that but i i feel like i failed and doing it god wanted you to fail because somehow he's going to bring glory to himself through your life so when it comes right down to it you ain't failed anything god wasn't surprised when moses killed the egyptian he didn't scratch his head and say oh man i got this guy already now look what he did now i might have to find somebody else no god knew that was going to happen before moses was ever even born and he knew that from that he was going to take moses out on the back side of the desert where he could get him off to himself and speak to him lift to ear friends he couldn't meet god down in egypt because that wasn't where god wanted to meet him at god wanted to meet him out there away from everybody away from everything he had to god wasn't going to meet him until moses looked around and said i'm a failure i thought i thought i had it all figured out how i was going to bring about this deliverance of god's people you know i had position in egypt and i thought maybe i could use my position and by that you know i was i was in line for the throne you know and thought maybe i could use that to get his people delivered that was moses thought but it wasn't god's thought moses fled into the desert at the age of 40. at the age of 80 god appeared to him and said pick this staff and go back and deliver my people an old man see when moses was 40 now some of you all know what i'm talking about when moses were 40 he had the strength of a warrior but at the age of 80 most had trouble kneeling down and getting back up it didn't look like that he was one that god would even use why would god use an old man but see god had chosen moses before he was ever even born and then he directed his mother and father on what to do to protect him from the devil trying to kill him god had his hand on moses all the time there was never a time in his life that god didn't have his hand on moses friends i don't care where you come from i don't care what you did i don't care what you did in your past i don't care if it was drugs alcohol or whatever it was god has always had his hand on you god had his hand on you for you to even be born when you maybe you were in uh some denomination or some under some creed god still had his hand on you and the whole time there was something that you felt you were lacking something you needed and many of you looked forward to many different ways on how to satisfy that look maybe some of you got children or loved ones that haven't received the lord look friends the elect come at the proper time god has his timing and and it doesn't work out with our timing it's like the song you were singing before i came out he might not come when you want him you know martha wanted him to come before her brother died but he didn't their lazarus had to die because god was going to get glory out of raising him back up but not only that he carried around until four days had passed and she said lord by now his body stinketh god didn't care about that that just showed more of god's glory that god was god could bring a stinking rotten corpse back to life i imagine he went from stinking to smelling like a rose within an instant you know it wasn't my choice to preach i didn't want to preach growing up i saw too much i'd watched my dad i'd watch people turn their backs on him i've seen how tough and how rough it was i've seen times when dad would go to preach one time he went and preached in mansfield and we were living over toward st mary's ohio and we had to travel right 30 you know and uh i don't know if any many of y'all traveled much on route 30 but there ain't no lights it's country and here dad preached on faith and buddy we had to live faith before we got home i don't know if i've told you a story or not but you're going to hear it again we got we got out on route 30 where there was no lights and there was no houses and there was nothing and the car the lights went out and the car just quit running it was a 1971 ford ltd and dad got out he didn't know what to do all of a sudden this farmer came out of nowhere driving a pickup truck and pulled off in front of us and he said uh what's going on he says he just quit he said well he said he got out his flashlight and he shot it in there he said go in there and try to start it up again dad went in there and turned to ignition when he did it fired up the lights came back on and everything and dad got out to think the man said what'd you do he said i just shined the light in there but this is the you know how paul harvey would say the rest of the story the rest of the story was me and my mom and my grandmother were sitting in the car praying god somehow get this car going again that wasn't the end of the testimony dad got back home and took the car to a a mechanic that he always took his old cars to and this mechanic said now what did you say you did he said it just started back up and he ran he said it's impossible for it to run said i don't i don't know much about cars but i don't know if it's the alternator or something wasn't even working no more and he said i don't know how you had lights i don't know how you ran the car you know well it was on glory power [Applause] i didn't choose to preach i people would ask me if i was going to preach be like my dad i said no i don't want to preach you know and mom had worked with me and taught me uh how to sing along with piano you know and so i when dad would go somewhere i'd sing and so when i got older i told people no that's all i'm gonna do just testify and sing you know that's easy somebody asked are you are you you feel like you're ever gonna be preacher no not me and then god called me when i was uh when meena and i were engaged getting ready to be married i told her i said i'll never be a preacher and then god called me and then i told her i said she said you said you would never be a preacher i said i know it but i promise you i'll never be a pastor [Laughter] it's like brother branham said woe be unto me if i don't do it you realize you don't get to be what you want to be you get to be all you can be you don't get to pick what you're going to be you think you're getting to pick god already knew everything about it you say well i'm going to college for this or this or this look i've got my oldest son has went to college for about three or four different things before he ever landed on the thing that what he was supposed to be god knows what he wants you to be it's not what you want to be it's what god makes you you are what you are what you are because god chose you to be that i know some young people like i just mentioned you you might be looking still yet to say what am i going to be don't worry about it do all you do all that's in your natural possibilities to do and then put the rest on god he'll guide you friends i went to college i don't do a thing of what i went to college for i forgot most of the stuff that i ever learned i i remember more about english and and math than i do the stuff that i was supposed to learn that's because i use english you know but god had me go through that for a reason through all that it was character building so you got to be what god chose you to be he called us and chose us before the foundation of the world so we're putting this back not just back before you were born we're putting this back before anybody was born god chose you amen well i got something i just keep hanging onto and it keeps wanting to come out and i keep on just to hold back on it a little bit when he spoke jesus name he spoke your [Applause] name hallelujah god knows you by name i was just listening to a message this morning brother brown was given the illustration about zacchaeus how zacchaeus was climbed up in this tree you know where he could see because he was small of stature and he wanted to see jesus over top of the people when jesus came by jesus not only pointed him out in the tree but jesus knew his name is it zacchaeus come down out of that tree i'm going home to eat with you today he knows your name nathanael comes before jesus he said behold an israelite and whom there's no god he said rabbi when did you know me he said before philip ever called you under the tree i saw you there's nothing that you've done that's ever surprised god any wrong or evil you did before you came to the lord none of that surprised him he knew but friends that wasn't you that was that old nature [Applause] that was that old man see a lot of times we look at somebody's old man to decide whether we think they're going to be a christian or not but that ain't what god does because he knows that old man's going to die and there's going to be a new birth that's how you're born again i've got a little granddaughter she's so curious name is rose she asked her mom about why does this happen and why does that happen and why is this and that and how do we know that there's a god and things and uh her mother was kind of talking about it you know saying boy this is really some questions i got to answer for her you know and jessica spoke up you know michael's mom she said yeah try answering the question of how do you get the holy ghost what is the holy ghost how do you get born again another time that's michael's questions jessica answers him best he can then she says go talk to your papa [Laughter] he redeemed us when we were unworthy to be redeemed friends we have not yet even begun to thank him enough for redeeming us you you think about when when this all does end and and we're in that 45-day window you know when the dead in christ rise and then we are changed i i don't know what you see or how you believe it but i believe when we're changed the rest of the world won't even be able to see us he said now how can that be jesus walked right through the midst of people was going to throw him off a cliff he walked right through their mess and they never even seen him but you when we get into that window friends look you're you're only you i don't even think we've begun to realize just what all god has really done for us i mean we to the best of our mental ability realize what god's done but it's even beyond that the bible says that the purpose of god according to election might stand that he chose jacob before they were born election you know rightly the birthright belonged to esau he was born first it was his by right but god didn't look at that god knew before they were ever even born that that birthright wasn't going to mean nothing to esau but he knew that jacob would want that birthright and would seek after and do everything he could anything he could to get it it's by foreknowledge let me read you this god know the end from the beginning therefore he could plan everything that would work out just to his glory that gives us courage to know no matter what comes or goes god is making everything work for your good the clock is ticking just exactly on time sometimes we get weary upset we get hastily we think oh i must do this or that but remember god's clock will be just exactly on time all these things has to be this way it has to all be done according to his great knowledge his foreknowledge for by foreknowledge he could predestinate not by his desire but by foreknowledge he knew who would accept it and who would not therefore he could make everything work according to his big time clock that's ticking away for he could foretell the end from the beginning he knew that we would live in this day he knew this would be our day and he had plans for our day god's got a purpose for you jack cole you know he preached faith and had a healing ministry and uh then he died i forget from what disease it was it struck him down and he died from it and there was many people that time were saying well that's because jack got off the got off of the you know the the path he kind of got out of the will of god and that's why god took it brother brown spoke up and he about that and he said that's not the way it is at all he said death can't take you to the purpose god sent you here for has been served and he said god didn't take jack cole until the purpose he sent jack hole here for had been served and once he had fulfilled that purpose then god said all right now it's my time to take you on home you there's a purpose for you to be here you think well my purpose was to get married and have children and you know have a family and all this you know god's got a purpose that goes beyond even all that don't worry his plans never fail foreknowledge brotherham said by foreknowledge god set in the church apostles prophets evangelists teachers pastors by foreknowledge god set them in he knew every one of them before the world began right he knew as roman h tells us that he hated esau and loved jacob before either boy was born for his foreknowledge allows him to predestinate all things to work together to his glory that's the great jehovah it isn't him that willeth or him that runneth it's god that showeth mercy you know what the scripture says so it isn't how much you try it's how much god has done for you now listen to this if you've got enough of god to come out here today a desire to come hear the message you ought to be the happiest person in the city why because that shows who you are and it shows because god is moving in your life trying to lead you to the fountain it shows he loves you that you've got the desire to come and hear it shows god loves you shows god's movement in your life it identifies who you are you know i think of in the bible where jesus says when they begin to speak evil of you cast your name out as evil and you know tell lies on you and all this stuff he said rejoice leap for joy for so did they the prophets so it shows what side you're on shows your identification it's not easy to be happy when people are abusing you when people are telling lies on you it's not easy and the natural man would like to go out there and straighten all that out so nobody would be believing any of that stuff but you can't do it just let it alone both parts of that scripture has got to be fulfilled and somebody's got to fulfill them by foreknowledge god predestinated not god god was not willing that any would perish but by foreknowledge he knew who would and who wouldn't he knew who would choose and who wouldn't choose it was his foreknowledge that let him know that jacob would have respect for the birthright brother branham says here he says god knew by foreknowledge who would be saved so he sent jesus to catch those who he foresaw would be saved now all was given the opportunity look and live but god knows who would but it goes even deeper than just that in the bible if you'll read in the beginning there of genesis i'm not going to turn to it i'm just going to tell you about it you'll find they go through the lineage and start saying who came after seth and this one named that and that name this and then it starts talking about esau or not so but cain's side and it starts saying you know the cain begot this one and that one got this one and this one begotten that one and if you go through there and look up the meanings of their names after a while there was one named i can't remember his name right now but he his name meant who is of god so you see satan he don't even know who's his he don't know who belongs to god so when he comes and tries to tell you you ain't one of them how would you know you don't know you see god knows his children god knew who you were going to be what color hair you would have what color eyes you would have how tall you would be he he knew everything about you i think about what a rascal i was before god really got a hold of me and then i think about that song when he was on the cross i was on his mind and it says he knew me yet he loved me he loved in other words he loved me in spite of all that because you know why i belong to it when your child does something wrong you don't disown him when she does something that that's not right or you didn't prove up you don't disown her you correct her that's what god does with his children brother mam said it's like this he says when a little one falls down you know learning to walk he said you don't pick him up and spank him because they fell down trying to learn to walk he said you pick him up and say now come on i walk this way he said that's how god does us papa god he'll pick us up and say now walk this way child [Applause] we get to go in the wrong direction oh turn back around here now my dad had this thing i i i can't do it like him but my dad had this thing about snapping his finger and i tell you he could stop you in your tracks romans 9 verse 15 says for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i'll have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion so then it is not him that willeth nor him that runeth but god that showeth mercy for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might shoe my power in thee that my name might be declared throughout all the earth therefore have he mercy on whom he will have mercy and on whom he will he hardeneth it isn't god looking at the marriage and saying i don't think much of pharaoh so i'm going to use him for this over here no god looked down and said he don't belong to me he's not one of my children but i know there is a doctor for destination out there brother branham said it's rotten but predestination is in the bible and i would like for somebody to explain to me how the infinite god could not know who was his and who wasn't right the god that knows all things how would he not know who belongs to him the bible says that saul while he was yet breathing out threatenings against the church of god that jesus appeared to him on the road in a bright light while he was while saul was intent on carrying out to come down there to damascus and to to bind those people that worship the name of jesus christ while he was on the way down there to do that that's when god chose to call him see it was god's timing but saul knew enough about god to know that that was something supernatural and he said lord who are you he said i'm jesus whom thou persecuted it is hard to kick against the prick a prick was a rod that they had that had a point on the end of it and the oxen or whatever was pulling the the cart they could prick it with that it didn't matter how much it kicked it was hard to kick against that they won't have to move and that's what god was telling saul you're going to do what i want you to do not what you want to do you're not going to be who you thought you were going to be you're going to be who i chose you to be and then god appeared you know he he was blind for three days and god appears to ananias and tells him hey saul of tarsus is down here and he's blind and i want you to go down there and lay hands on him and give him back his sight and adam and i said now isn't he the same one lord that i've heard about that has been persecuting the people that worship you he said yes but he's a chosen vessel unto me i chose him to proclaim my name before the gentiles [Applause] [Music] and the bible says after that he went down there prayed for saul and told him to receive the holy ghost he was baptized and immediately went preaching about jesus christ wait a minute wait a minute now saw before you start preaching this message you're going to sit down and learn a little bit about it you're new to it you weren't in his meetings [Music] paul said i received this from the lord it didn't come from man it come from god i'll tell you something ain't nobody can teach you how to preach and i know not everybody preaches every man don't preach the same way and the thing is you can't help how you preach you just have to preach the way god gives it to you just be who god made you to be and he made us all different and sometimes we approach things a little different ways but it's just to get you to see the big picture colossians 1 21 and 22 now paul was the enemy of god's people he did not look like somebody that would be chosen to preach the name of jesus christ but god turned him from an enemy of the people to a defender of the truth and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight this is what he has for you to be you're to be holy said how am i going to be holy you will be holy because he has desired for you to be holy that's what he made you you're not holy because of anything you do you're holy because he's holy you're accepted because he was accepted you're righteous because he was righteous you're unbelievable because there was no fault found in him the anointed word of this day of which you are apart by predestination you immediately like knew when you heard that you knew right quick you was an eagle you realized that you wasn't a denominational chicken to begin with you know there was something wrong there there was something wrong that's right you know that you were trapped into it at the beginning he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness that's how you stand unblameable before god he made you that because he took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness you are standing completely justified as though you never did it in the beginning you're standing if you're standing on god's word with god's word every amen every jot every tittle where are you standing i'm trying to tell you pull away from them shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the sun i hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete justified like you never did it at the first place hallelujah talk about a thanksgiving i feel real good i'm more thankful for that than anything i know of you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and every woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus and believes every word stands as though they never sinned at the first place [Applause] so you know where you're standing you're knowing who you are my goodness i think i've caught my brother's spirit i thought i'd be done before now if you were condemned to die and a man took your place then you could not die for that sin because somebody took your place and you can't die for the sins that were committed because somebody else took your place he took your sin upon him he became sin that you might become him he took on our unrighteousness so we could take on his righteousness he took our place so we can't die for that because he took our place [Applause] brother says here all the spiritual union of christ in his church now when the flesh is becoming word notices when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh your flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh in you manifested vindicated just what the bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day it's culminating so fast see we're nearing the coming of jesus to be united with his church where the word becomes the word the holy ghost is searching the hearts you never came in i never came in by my own will it was god that chose me so it's his responsibility to take care of me it's his responsibility to provide for my needs i know i can get in trouble for this statement with this day being the day of women's rights and all this but i don't mean anything bad by it i don't mean to degrade anybody in any way but when a man and a woman gets married that man is taking on the responsibility to care for her and he's taking on the responsibility once they have children to care for that family when christ took you as his bride he took on the responsibility to take care of you [Applause] not only to make sure you got food on your table but to make sure you got food on your table god doesn't want you to be frowning he don't want you to be sad he don't want you to be depressed he wants you to be happy he made you to be happy brother branham said that that uh sadness and and worry and all these things could cause cancer what is happiness calls there are so many scriptures in the bible that talk about being happy clapping your hands praising the lord making a joyful sound there are so many scriptures about being happy being glad sometimes we get our focus on the world and the things around us you know sort of like peter did when he walked on the water but he still walked on the water don't get your focus on these things you might look if you're going through a valley you're going through a trial don't get your focus on it get your focus on him get your focus on what he has done for you if you can get your focus on that instead of on the trial you'll be happy brother branham talks about the spirit of esau still being here and he said just like the birthright was rightly esau's he said the it was rightly the church belonged to the church but they despised it they didn't want to get down on their knees and cry and plead before god and they didn't want to get filled with the holy ghost and they instead they despised it and called them a bunch of holy rollers he said it's because that's their nature that's why they've done that the crow and the dove the dove craves this word because that's what she is and the crow despises it because he wasn't born to receive it but that dove you couldn't keep him away from it it's because the election of god it's because you're born to be a spiritual man a spiritual woman i i'm not talking about the new birth yet i'm talking about your natural birth in your natural birth you were born to be a spiritual man and a spiritual woman you become that by your second birth you know there's some that they could hear this message hear this word and it goes right off them like water off a duck's back i don't know you know maybe you've heard that expression over and over and over again but i've raised some ducks and i've i've come to realize that all these expressions they say about ducks like this is duck weather and different things like that all that stuff is cause somebody was watching the duck and when they made this the the the phrase up like water off a duck's back it's cause somebody was watching the duck and a duck just ruffles his feather and looks as dry as can be they can plunge under the water come back up and still look as dry as can be because they're a duck and that's that's the way it is with some folks there's no penetration they don't absorb it they can't become one with it they can't eat it just like you you couldn't take carrying out and feed it to a chicken but an eagle can eat it he can eat the fresh meat people become so calloused with their religion the things of this world their own ideals friends they could sit right here with you and they wouldn't do a thing to them because they weren't born for now i know some people that don't believe in predestination that way they think well how that would be god being cruel how could god it's like god not giving them a chance oh no he gives them a chance if they were sitting in here this morning that would be their chance but it's because of who you are is why you hear it the way you hear it and why you absorb it and take it in it's because of who you are why you can take the book and eat it god knew everything you and i would do but the thing is he chose us first before we done anything because he first loved us we didn't love him first he loved us first you can't help but make it friends you can't help but make the rapture because you are preordained to make it you're predestinated to make it you know what the word predestinated when you break it down it comes down to destiny your destination it's already been determined you have a ticket in hand that says i've got a flight to glory and you can there's nothing satan can do to prevent you from going you had the word in you you were born with a seed of god in you you don't get it in you by some man putting it there you didn't get it in you the prophet didn't put it there you were born with it and because you had it is why you could receive this because that's who you were that's who the real you is listen to this and i'm going to close there is only one out of a million that is going to live did you ever think of that there are the germ and and the egg in both them but there's only one going to live and that's not determined by the one that beats there first because sometimes the egg will back way back in the back and the germ might be up in the middle of the sperm and they'll crawl over one another it takes an intelligence to know whether it's going to be a boy or a girl red-headed black-headed or what more it's the election of god it can't be nothing else election even the natural birth is election whether it's going to be a boy or girl whatever it's going to be and when that little germ wiggles into this little egg and the tail drops off and it starts the baby's spine whatever after you know the baby and the rest of those million germs and me and eggs a million germs only one lives all the same but god chose by election which one was going to live and the rest of them perish one out of a million [Applause] so even in your natural birth you're one out of a million you're special in god's sight you're special and in your spiritual birth you're one out of a million [Applause] god ordained you naturally to be born and he ordains you to be born again by the spirit of god none of this is left up to chance it's all in a plan everything of your life fits in god's plan let's stand uh i used to know all this song but i haven't sung it in a long time so i don't remember how the verses go even so i just sing the course and you sing it with me i found a lily in my valley i found the lily in my valley i found strength when i was born i found a place to lay my
