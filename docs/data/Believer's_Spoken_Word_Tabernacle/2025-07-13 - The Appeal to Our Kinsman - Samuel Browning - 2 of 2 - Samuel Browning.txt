TRANSCRIPT
========================================
based on the request and in God's in in now here in this place this request that is given that that what Ruth is actually asking for is she's asking him to take her in marriage for that of redemption and and as he speaks and as he speaks to her you know this the type with her and I'm not going to dwell I spoke on this a little bit before I'm not going to dwell on it but when she comes here into this place she's asking him to spread your skirt over me or or that part of that garment because I am thy handmade. She's asking him for his protection to claim her as wife. &gt;&gt; Now, this in itself was something that was it's a signification there. There's scriptures that we can go into and we covered that on in Ezekiel of how that God, the only way that you and I come under the full protection of almighty God is that he spreads his garment over us. And what garment is that? It's the garment of his word. It's the garment of the Holy Spirit. What was it that Elisha requested? I want a double portion. And it was Elijah who threw the mantle back. And the mantle itself fit Elisha. Elisha was cut, was molded, was shaped that when the garment came, he could put the garment on. It's the same thing that when when this is placed upon our lives and I'm just going to very quickly you could see this approach with Ruth and then then the Jewish the customs they'll go on even now is many times they'll take this with that garment that prayer shaw and they'll put this over h you know in a wedding and it's showing that this this prayer shaw that belonged to the groom that now as husband and wife were under this protection we're joined together within this and here Ruth is asking looking for this this to be take me as your wife remember not just marriage but take me I I I want to be one this is it's not just something that is just uh convenient but I I want to I I want you to be and fulfill that act of a kinsman upon my life and I want you to think of this in this term here when the scripture says in Ruth chapter 3 and verse 10 when in the script the one of the last ones We read there it says Ruth said or or Boaz responds to her and says, "Blessed be thou of the Lord, my daughter, for thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning." More kindness in there at the beginning. And this word kindness that we look at is the word uh that is it deals with it's an active expression. It's not something that's just uh it's just laying there and it's just you know as not being expressed but it's an active expression. Thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning. She showed kindness in the beginning but now in the latter end it's more kindness. Oh my. And we could just say so much there on that in this hour that God has given us. Listen, we're not expressing our own thoughts. We are expressing God's thoughts when we've taken that word into our life. It's not our ideas. We're not walking under the isms under the theology of man. Listen, I I'm not discounting that men made probes and they were looking into that there were truth that men received. But God came in this hour and vindicated that it was true and that it had come from him and he rightfully divided it and placed it accordingly in restoring the altar of the Lord. And in this hour, listen, listen, in this hour, the Luther Luther's age could not express or let me just say it like this, the Ephesian age could not express what you and I have been called to express. Because when the church ages began, the the the the church was already a fallen woman. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? But in this hour, it is a promise of a full restoration. Not come back to the Ephesian age, but the alpha has become the omega. &gt;&gt; The same seed that went in the ground has now become expressed. So you and I, the God has called us. It's because of the position of the hour. It's God moving in this hour for a deeper expression. That's why the expression of justification. Wonderful. But it's not enough for a real believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They go on. There's got to be a sanctifying, a cleaning out of all the all the all the things of the world and desires of the world. It's a deeper expression. And it's got to come to the expression where the Holy Spirit himself setting down on the inside and bringing forth the very literal life of Jesus Christ. This is the hour of the latter kindness is in a greater measure than what it was in the former. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; When you started walking with God, oh my, what a tremendous thing. But your faith, it continues to build unto the place where Christ himself moves into our lives in the very depth of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then through that word working in our lives and prevailing and overcoming, what is it? It's an active expression of the living God working in our lives. &gt;&gt; Let me just look at this here in the scripture just for a moment. the same word. Here we find Abraham coming and Abraham or not Abraham but Eleazar. Here he is right here at the point where coming to to Rebecca and he says, "Oh Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham." What kindness would that be? Direction, leadership, guidance. uh bring me to the place where Abraham has sent me to get a bride for his son Isaac. Show me kindness today. Verse 14. And let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say, let down thy picture, I pray thee, that I may drink, and she shall say, drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac. And thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master. Oh, hallelujah. Aren't you thankful for the leadership of the Holy Spirit? That's God's kindness. &gt;&gt; It's not what we deserve. But notice knowing, Lord, I need I need your kindness, your expression, your direction, your leadership. And he's worshiping. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And he said, "Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham." This is after Rebecca has come out. Who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth. I being in the way, the Lord, led me to the house of my master's brethren. In Genesis 32:9, here is Jacob now in his return to Bethl. Oh God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, the Lord which saidest unto me, return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, I will deal well with thee. Am I not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of all the truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant? Let me ask you, did Jacob deserve what he had? All of the the flocks, he said, here, I'm two bands. He's letting it be known. God, I don't deserve. I don't deserve. He's in a place. He's in a place. Such a wonderful place at that moment is accepting God's expression of kindness. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. In Genesis 39:21, the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. In Exodus 15:13, "Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed. Thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation." Aren't you thankful for his leadership, &gt;&gt; his guidance, he's guiding us every step of the way. Oh friends, he's sent his angel before us to guide us, to lead us, and to bring us into that prepared place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Exodus 34:6 and 7. The Lord passed by before Moses and said, "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious and long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and fourth generation." In Deuteronomy 7:9, know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God and faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generation. I want you to notice these scriptures that I've just read. Even in Exodus there, it speaks of how that these this mercy was kept. It was reserved. It was laying within God the whole time, knowing there would be that that was needed and a people on whom that mercy would be poured out upon. Mercy is not what we deserve. Mercy keeps from us what we do deserve. &gt;&gt; If we got what we deserve, we'd get hell. &gt;&gt; It's not what we deserve. God said, "I've kept it reserved. &gt;&gt; I'm not run out of mercy. I'm a God who is rich in mercy &gt;&gt; and he's willing. God's Let me tell you something. God's not one that's a penny pincher. He loves to express his mercy. And his mercy being expressed is when he begins to deal with our life, begin to lead us, begins to guide us. And as our lives will yield and respond to that and say, "Oh Lord Jesus," and making that appeal and that request, oh friends, the mercy of God begins to move and go to work and move through our lives. I tell you how many times that God has moved for us in healing our bodies. How many times God has moved for us, delivering us where in our minds we were tormented in our minds where it seemed like maybe you couldn't go to sleep or rest or this problem or this situation. I don't know how I'm going to get out of it. Lord, I don't know what to do. But here you're standing right there. You don't maybe feel anything, but you're saying, "I'm going to speak to this sea. I'm going to speak to this water." You know what that is? That's the mercy of Almighty God. It's an active expression of God's own nature. And what does he do? He comes on the scene. &gt;&gt; He comes on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the living God. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise be to God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua 2, here's Rahab. Therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord, since I've showed you kindness, that you will also show kindness unto my father's house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And give me a true token. Right. I don't. Here she is. I've heard about Joshua. That's why that's why I I I I I brought you into the house. I've heard about the destroying angel. I've heard about this message. I've heard what God is doing. God's name is being made manifest. Lord, &gt;&gt; the fear is upon all the people. But notice her request. It wasn't just to bring the spies into her home, &gt;&gt; right? It wasn't just to have fellowship around the message. It was to get under it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She made an appeal &gt;&gt; to the kinsmen. She made an appeal to Almighty God. She made an appeal. You know, you say, "Well, she was asking those men." She realized those men's were God's representation. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And as she made an appeal, she recognized I need a true token. She had confidence. These men are able to minister to me the true token. &gt;&gt; And remember what what it was what it was. Take the scarlet court. It was already there in her house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. The word that God has given, it was already here. God, that's why the opening of the seals, it's not a new word. It's God taking the cover off. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where Satan wanted to water down the new birth and do away with the deity of Jesus Christ and teaching the baptism and titles, but God opened his word and showed you and I this is my provision for you. We just didn't know how to apply it. &gt;&gt; And that's what the word came to do was open up what was in our possession. Let us know as sons and daughters of God what belongs to us. And here's how to apply it. I tell you, if she applied it any other way, we wouldn't be reading about Rahab. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "By faith, Rahab." And you know what faith is? It's a revelation of God's will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It didn't matter how much she could not explain how her house was going to stand and the rest of the wall would fall. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Samuel, I I don't understand that." Well, let me just give you another one. I don't understand how that bush can be on fire and not be burnt. Let me give you another one. I don't understand how a man can have have the living fire of almighty God in his soul that'll burn out sin, burn out everything, and yet it doesn't destroy you and I, but rather it produces Christ. &gt;&gt; It's a paradox. You can't you can't explain that. &gt;&gt; You know what it simply was? They told her where to put it and she because her request was so urgent, she did in faith what God had spoke to her to do. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And deliver our lives from death. Verse 14. And the men answered her, "Our life for yours, if you utter not this our business, and it shall be when the Lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee." &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. I'm glad there's coming even even a great a great expression on the change of our bodies. Aren't you? I &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to that day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice here in Ruth, remember when Naomi, here was Ruth and Orpha, they're leaving. They're leaving the land. Naomi is going back. They both start out with Naomi. But remember Naomi, she says this to her two daughter-in-laws. Go return each of you to your mother's house, and the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me. The Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them and they lifted up their voices and wept. Now let me just say this. God was not playing with words through Naomi. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you see the Lord deal kindly. It was to that of a degree of of his kindness of his mercy. This is why, listen friends, it's not it's not uh you and I that is determining uh you know who receives what. This is all in God's economy. &gt;&gt; Na as soon as Naomi said that I believe with all of my heart that no doubt if na if Orpha and Ruth would have returned I believe God would have dealt kindly with them but according &gt;&gt; according to the measure that they had received. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. You see, there's a difference between the bride and the church. &gt;&gt; The church is just content with Jesus as my savior. &gt;&gt; But that that's it. &gt;&gt; It might go on, you know, very very sparse. You might find, you know, there no doubt some still out there that you'd find even a sanctified life. That's very sparse. That's more of God's kindness to deliver from from from sin and the habits and the desires. But you notice that no doubt that them returning back. But for Ruth, they just couldn't register with Ruth. You know why? There was a deep calling to the deep. &gt;&gt; And let me just say this to you friends. That's why you or I cannot be satisfied with just uh status quo, just coming to church, just being around the message or just affiliation. It'll never do. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why is that? Why is there a longing in your heart? And let me just tell you that longing itself, even when we unite with that and the uniting with our kinsmen, our kinsmen uniting with us, it doesn't stop there. It's his life being reproduced through us. And that's the desire is Lord, take me over, Lord. I want to see more of you in my life and him moving in areas of our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a growth that takes place in our life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But oh, when they find Boaz or Boaz, not when they find him, but when Naomi realizes who is filled you're in, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; She says, "Blessed be he of the Lord who has not left off his kindness &gt;&gt; to the living and to the dead." This man's a near kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen. So, thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning. This is where it really begs the question for us just to pause and think about this. What are we presently expressing? &gt;&gt; What are we presently expressing or what is being expressed from our life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we we know we can't live on yesterday. It's what are we today? Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't live on what things we're it's right now. What what are we today? Because we can see down through the scriptures where many who started wonderful fruits in the beginning and no fruit later on. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; We talked about that with Jacob and Esau. You talk we we mentioned some things about Deus on Thursday night. Deeus had some tremendous fruit, right? &gt;&gt; But later on we find he departs and goes his way. See, that's why we can't live on a past experience. &gt;&gt; There's no victory in just a past experience. Now, let me just clarify this. You each and everyone have must have an experience where you know that you have passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm not so interested in that you know a day or a time or this or that because brother Brandham never took that with sister Bruce when she was asking the question in other places. But those things are expressed through the message because there what it is there's got to come a settleness in our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a settleness by the word that you know you've met God personally and you know that God has changed your life that you are no longer the same. &gt;&gt; There's got to be that settleness because when that has come listen friends when that's come that's where the expression of a son and daughter of God lives from because that's what really makes you or places you as a son and daughter of God. Right? &gt;&gt; Just let let me let me let me move on here just a little bit. You could we could parallel this all the way through Uzziah, Isaiah, and so forth. But you know, there had to come the right approach and the right approach. So there's the right request. Here's the right approach. I love this scripture out of Psalm 65 and 4. It says, "Blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causeest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts, we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple." Notice whom thou choosest and causes, not not the man who chooses you, but whom thou chooses and calls us to approach. Now, it is a choice that we make, but it's not us choosing God. It's us reflecting the choice that God made concerning our life. That's what it is. Listen, it wasn't God who was lost. We were lost. &gt;&gt; But blessed is that man whom God chooses and calls us to approach. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. It It takes God. And we know there's a way to approach everything. And you know, a young man going to, you know, approach a young lady, just don't walk up and grab her hand and say, "Hey, how you doing?" And and you know, I'd like to kind of get to know you. I mean, he may get slapped for that right there because there's a right approach. You would not walk into an interview that you're going into and walk in there, you know, uh I know we're living in a different age, but you know, walk in there with, you know, holy pants and, you know, walk in there with your your your shirt untucked and walking in with flip-flops and and coming in there and say, "Hey, I'm I'm here to interview for a job." Now, I get it, friends, if that's all that somebody has. But we we know we're living in a time in an hour that you see things you see standards not being lived up to. But I'm not I'm not here to hop on it. What I'm here to point out is is that you would know that that's not the way of approach. You're not going to approach somewhere when you go into an interview. You come fitted for what you're trying to approach. And this is the same way with God. It's not Listen, the thing that's different is for an interview, you determine what you're going to wear, the colors you'll wear, the shoes you'll wear, the dress, or the suit or the tie. But that's not so with God. God already has what's needed in the approach and he'll only accept what he has provided. And what he's provided is the blood for you and I to come through. Is his word for you and I to come through. Adam tried another way to approach God. He made fig leaves and God rejected his approach because the only provided approach is through the shed blood of the lamb showing that there's one innocent that died in ourstead and you and I laying down our life laying and surrendering our life that Christ himself &gt;&gt; might move into our lives fully. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'm the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the father but by me. We can't get to him outside of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that's why that if a person feels like they feel like they're in a stalemate. Listen, even if you're in a stalemate in your journey to the new birth and you recognize I'm not right there of what's being talked about where there's a real relationship where there is absolutely come a change in my life. Well, don't stop. Keep going. But allow God to evaluate your life. And Lord is am I coming in my own way? I don't want my own way cuz you won't accept my way. He didn't accept Cain's way. Cain had some awful good fruits. Kane had the best. He didn't put rotten tomatoes up there. Kane had the best. If Kane would have put his fruit out here at at at the Laurian County Fair, he'd had blue ribbons all over it. His name would have been in the front page of the Chronicle, the Morning Journal. It would have been top dog because everything he did, he poured himself into it. But what God was asking was for a surrender to his will. And God God s God moved out and confirmed that Abel's revelation that God sovereignly gave him was the right provided approach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God's got a way to approach him. He's got a way through the word. This is why we evaluate our lives. And Lord, am I approaching you through the word? We begin to look even when it comes to every promise, whether it's for healing. &gt;&gt; I think we're living in a time, friends, that it just we we don't want to take things for granted. &gt;&gt; We don't want to just take everything as, well, this is a test or a trial. Just want to take it that way. We want to look at it and Lord, where's my life? Where am I standing? &gt;&gt; Where am I standing with you? &gt;&gt; We're living we're you know that that's the time we want that reflection in our life. Lord, where am I? Where am I standing with you? It's not my brother, not my sister, but it's me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. This is why that man man never seeks after God. It's God seeking after man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We never sought God. God sought us. No man, Jesus said, can come to me except the Father which hath sent me. Draw him and I will raise him up at the last day. Brother Ram said, "Now in the message approach to God, he said it's the same thing today. Man cannot come to Christ except God calls him first." His nature, if you ever had any nature, any thought of anything of coming to God, God is dealing with you. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Amen. He says we cannot come to God except through Christ. And the Holy Spirit has to call us first or we'll never think nothing of it. It'll just go right on. Just think of the things of the world. Church is all right. Sure. I believe that's okay. But a real touch, God has to do it. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God thought it was God. It's not us, but it was God seeking us out. Blessed is the man whom thou choostth and cause us to approach that we may dwell in thy courts. not not just go and and come, but I want to dwell in your presence, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to abide. I want the Holy Spirit, the abiding dove, walking in my life. I want that presence. I want your life. I want you, Lord. Everywhere I go, I want them to know, Lord, I'm a Christian. Not because of of making myself odd. I want him to I want there's a there's a life. There's an atmosphere there. There's there's something different about my life. Not me making myself different, but Christ in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. It makes me different. It sets me apart. It changed my desires, changed my nature. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "It isn't him that willth or him that runth. It's God that shows mercy." &gt;&gt; That's the scripture. So, it isn't how much you try, it's how much God has done for you. &gt;&gt; And if you've got enough God to come out here tonight, this morning, a desire to come hear the message, you ought to be the happiest person in the city because God is moving in your life. He's trying to lead you to the fountain. He loves you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, it must be the right atmosphere, the right request, the right approach, the right atmosphere. And that atmosphere that I'm speaking of is an atmosphere of faith. &gt;&gt; Because it is an atmosphere of faith that brings forth the promises of God. And it's not something that we work ourselves up into or or anything, but it is one thing that will bring faith. And that is the word of God. It's the spirit of God taking his word and beginning to speak his word to our hearts and to our lives. It creates an atmosphere. It drives back doubt. It drives back unbelief. It drives back spirits that have wanted to cloud and try to hinder. It's it's God himself. Who was it that created the right atmosphere in the beginning? It was God in the beginning who said, "Let there be light." And when he said, "Let there be light," the shakina glory followed the word that was spoken. And he manifested that word and the atmosphere over this earth changed. What? It became an atmosphere for the word to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is why the scripture said, "Without faith, it's impossible to please God. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." Oh, brother and sister, it's not you creating faith. It's not me, it's God that's creating the faith. &gt;&gt; That's why, oh God, the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit, the preaching of the word. Amen. There's an atmosphere that's being created that what that will begin to deal with our lives, begin to move on our hearts and for the needs, the desires that we have in him when we can recognize I'm in his presence. Oh, you might say, I believe the scripture where two or three agree he'll be in our midst. I believe that, too. But Lord, we need to see your presence. Lord, we need to stand upon that word. Lord, I'm here. I'm not come to church just to fulfill a duty, but I'm here, Lord, to enter in to the atmosphere. And this atmosphere is not just something that stays here. It's an atmosphere that goes with you. It doesn't leave you. I don't care where your feelings are at. The atmosphere remains &gt;&gt; because when faith has dropped, &gt;&gt; it's settled. &gt;&gt; But without faith, it's impossible to please him. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why when a person comes to God first time here they are the preaching of the word waters of separation begins to deal with their heart and begins to call out sin. But you know when that begins to take place and their heart just begins to respond and hear the heart the way that it is and God what's God doing? It's his provided way. Remember the provided way of approach. you you just don't come any way. But there's there's a provided approach. And God begins to bring his word, the washing of water by the word, and begins to move upon our life and beginning to change our desires, beginning to to melt away unbelief. And then you say, "Well, uh, you know, Brother Samuel, what what what do I have to do?" What you have to do is believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You hear me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is believe. Let me tell you down in Egypt when they went over and they had to take the lamb, slay the lamb, and then they had to take the blood and put it upon the door. You know what? They put it on the door with hissup. Brother Brandham words it like this. I to me I'm thankful for God doing it like this, pulling it there from the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Hup is common faith. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said hissup it grows everywhere. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what you understand when brother Ram saying that it's all around you. It's not something way out here. I got to send up and get it or I got to go down there and get it. It's navy even in my mouth. That's why the prophet said when the Holy Spirit is here to inspire you, speak that word that he's inspiring to your heart &gt;&gt; and he'll make your body obey your confession because it's not you saying to this mountain, &gt;&gt; it is Christ through you &gt;&gt; speaking to this mountain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have to read this. Brother Brandon says that red scarlet, that hissup, he applies it with common faith that a 2-year-old child could use. I thank God for that. I'm glad faith. Faith is not complimented complicated. Faith is very simple. It's just simple. Just like if you tell a 2-year-old, they say, you say, "Be ready. Dinner's going to be ready in so many minutes or this is going to, you know what? Daddy's going to get you a bicycle." You know what happens? They'll bug you and bug you and bug you as soon as you said something like that. It's simple. You know, sometimes we become too too much up here. And you know what up here is? We begin to look at ourselves and we somehow look at ourselves and reason whether we're not we're worthy. You'll never be worthy. &gt;&gt; We're not worthy of what promise of God. &gt;&gt; It's not what we could do. The best that we could do are filthy rags. That's why we needed the love of God, the kindness of God to be expressed through our life. &gt;&gt; Cuz I couldn't get to God. You couldn't get to God. But God came down to where you and I was. &gt;&gt; We didn't find this message. This message found you and I. [Applause] Hallelujah. You might say, I said in a message church for 10 years, the message found you. Hallelujah. He found you and you begin to realize, I need the kinsman. I need him. I need that Mike Boaz. I need that living God who sent this message. I need him. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, glory be to God in the highest. Just believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Oh my. Oh, brother Samuel, you need to tell him to quit doing this and quit doing that. Look, I'm not saying that there ain't things that a person don't need to quit doing, but let me just tell you something. Don't get the cart before the horse. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say you're sanctified. It said you're justified by faith. &gt;&gt; There's a power of God under salvation. Don't try to clean yourself up. Believe on him. And when you believe on him, sanctification will follow belief in the word. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit follows belief in the word. &gt;&gt; Don't look at yourself. &gt;&gt; If Ruth would have looked at herself, think of the pedigree she had. &gt;&gt; Moabitete. &gt;&gt; Think of everything that was in her background. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. Let me just tell you something. You've got a background that's much deeper than the background you were trapped in. &gt;&gt; And what's more important than the background you were trapped in is that background that comes from the background of God's mind. &gt;&gt; You were always a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you were trapped into this, but you couldn't get yourself out of the trap. But God himself, God rich in mercy, our kinsman, our boss, came down and became one of us. And he paid the price. &gt;&gt; He's a worthy man, an honorable man, and he was able to do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Bam says we say quit doing this, quit doing that. He said, "You make it so high like a coconut tree that somebody's got to climb to the top before they can ever see in." &gt;&gt; So, just get an atmosphere of faith. He said, "Then they'll know how to act and how to go about in God's word." You see what I'm saying, friends? It God comes with faith to drive out what is unclean, what's not like him. And I'll tell you, there's nothing more powerful than faith in God's word. when you begin to confess what God has done for you. Look, when God saves a person's life and how many knows what that was like when you felt the burdens lifted off your life? &gt;&gt; I remember that. You know what? You begin to confess, I'm saved. You begin to tell your associates, "I'm saved. I'm different. I no longer do these types of things. I'm not going those kind of places." and watch the spirit of God will follow and work righteousness in your life because he is a faithful and merciful high priest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh boy, I feel good, man. &gt;&gt; How can I have that faith, brother Brandham? It's just as simple as reaching and getting the hissip to ply the blood. Believe it for yourself. Believe that Christ died for you. Believe that he was the innocent one that died in your place as a sinner and guilty. And the same applies by divine healing. Just simple faith to take him at his word. &gt;&gt; Now, we've heard this repeated a lot, but it's the truth. When the worshipper came to worship and he brought his sacrifice, the priest never inspected the worshipper. &gt;&gt; He looked at his sacrifice to make sure the sacrifice met the qualifications. [Applause] And you say, "Well, he ain't looking at me." Look, you're standing there with him. If you'll take his word into your heart, you're standing there with his word. That's showing your confidence and belief in that word. He's looking at that word. He has taken your sin debt. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not your righteousness. It's his righteousness. &gt;&gt; It's not your worthiness, it's his worthiness. Let me tell you the rapture on that morning will not be because of our worthiness. The rapture is the worthiness of almighty God. &gt;&gt; It's the righteousness of God taking place in our lives. &gt;&gt; It's Satan's business and duty to get us looking at ourselves. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that we don't have to look at wrong and repent of it, but you don't have to dwell there. You don't have to stay there. Listen, even if you listen, even for you to repent, you've got to have faith in his word. For he said, "If you sin, my little children, you have an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous, who is the propitation for all sin." &gt;&gt; You've got to have faith in your lamb. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. The reason sometimes we get down and we're tripping over our lips and everything else, I'm not saying when we fail, we don't feel bad. But you've got to realize you've got a propitation. [Music] &gt;&gt; I thank God there's a conviction. Thank God for that. I'm glad I'm glad it's not well, you know, I've got a lamb. No, you realize I've got a lamb here. He said he never leave me nor forsake me. I'm tied in there with my sacrifice. My desire is to please him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The simplicity of faith in Jesus Christ by what hiss. It's right there. &gt;&gt; Apply it. &gt;&gt; It's right there. &gt;&gt; So, it's got to come at the right time. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to be at the right time. &gt;&gt; And notice with this being at the right time, think back in scriptures with me. Naomi upon the first of them coming in the land. And even when Ruth came back to her loaded, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Loaded with meal. &gt;&gt; Ruth came back skipping. If I could skip, I would. Skipping, dancing. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. Naomi doesn't even speak to her at that moment in some of the closing verses of Ruth chapter 2 and say, "Go to him now. Go to Boaz now." But she makes known, remember, blessed be the Lord that hath not left off &gt;&gt; his expression &gt;&gt; of faithfulness, kindness, mercy, &gt;&gt; but the instruction comes at the right time. &gt;&gt; It's at the right time. See, it all laid in the word. Listen, the word that's being fulfilled in this hour, it's always laid in the word. &gt;&gt; Let let me let me tell you something. Naomi. Ruth loved Naomi, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; She loved We could go through many scriptures from the Old Testament and pulling these things in. She loved her. You know, you know what it shows? To be to be a lover of the word, &gt;&gt; to love the word. Jesus said, "If you keep my commandments, if you love me, keep my commandments, &gt;&gt; and my father and I will come and make our abode in you." You see, it's it's God working to just to take that word and begin to feed on that word. I I I want to just be very simple and drop this in. There's there's desires. There's questions. What do where do I go from here? What's the next step that I make? Where do I move? How do I how do I move on? You know what that is? When those questions come come to me, it shows that I'm talking about questions coming from to me. What it's showing is it's God dealing with the heart. It's ready for that next step. &gt;&gt; It's ready for that next move. It's ready for that part of it. It's ready for that. Listen, this is why even with the rapture coming on, we're not saying, "Oh Lord, delay thy coming. Oh God, Lord Jesus, just put it off until I can Lord, I want to retire. I want to, Lord, just be able to set on the beaches of South Carolina." I mean, that's not me. That's what I think of retirement, but maybe of you. At anyhow, um that's not it. &gt;&gt; We're praying and we're longing. Listen, let me just tell you something. Brother Bram says those that he's coming for are those that's living &gt;&gt; for his coming. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Living for his coming. &gt;&gt; That at any moment, it's the right the right time. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The right time, the right season. So within this right within this right time, this is the moment that she begins to make known to Ruth. Ruth, here it is. This is where he's at. Naomi says, "I can tell you where he's at. And this is the time." He's our He's our kinsman. And she's already given her direction. &gt;&gt; Didn't Naomi give her direction? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't go to another field. Right? &gt;&gt; Don't just like brother Ram says, don't be chasing after this gift and chasing after that gift and chasing after this and stay in the field. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where he's revealing himself. Stay in his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay in his word. Stay in the word. Don't Don't let anything get your attention away from that word. Stay with the word. Naomi gave her direction. And you know what? Ruth is not Ruth is not fully aware. She's under inspection the whole time, &gt;&gt; right? Because when Boaz even comes to her, he's able to tell her, "Uh, the Lord recompense unto thee and knowing all that you've done even from the beginning." And he's able to see she's under inspection. Friends, do you realize the Holy Spirit when God's dealing with the heart that that the sealing angel, he inspects the lives? &gt;&gt; He inspects hearts. you know, even for needs that we're praying for. Even when it comes for healing and and different things in our life, our body and and certain things we're praying about, you know, you know, God inspects, God looks after. God will not that God will not come over top of sin, but God works to deal with sin. This is why the prophet said, "Don't let anything get between you and that word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let job, don't let family, don't let anything because let me tell you, let me tell you your job or anything else if if God gave you that job, it's God that gave it and God will give you the grace and the wisdom to keep it. And if there's anything that'll bring the family, the prophet tells us this in the Hebrew series. He said, "You get in the will of God, seek him first, and then the rest of the family will fall into the will of God." &gt;&gt; That is so good. So, it's not what it's not us trying to do something, but Satan, he'll work upon our lives to try to get things between us and God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then we get stuck in that place like we were preaching a few weeks ago in between desires. &gt;&gt; At the right time, Naomi knew at this appointed time of harvest, I know where he's at. &gt;&gt; Exactly. I know what portion of the word he's in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know what he's fulfilling right now. &gt;&gt; And not only does she make this known to Ruth, you realize in order for her to do this and Ruth to carry it out, Ruth has a heart that is receptive to the leadership to move to the kinsmen. &gt;&gt; She's able to do that. Ruth didn't have a living husband. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, here she is. She's at a place to receive that and she knows this right approach and she tells Ruth how to go. &gt;&gt; Go wash yourself. &gt;&gt; She didn't say take your clothes off but cover yourself up. &gt;&gt; That that's that's a scripture, &gt;&gt; right? And when to go when do I go? Do just just right now in this moment. You know it's a timing. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; remember brother Ram talks about the little baby when of the man that had backslid and then Graham Snelling came to his house that night and brother Bram talks about remember the little it wasn't a baby sorry it was a little boy and he what brother Bram saw in a vision before this man ever came to his house and the little boy came running to brother Brandham across the room with a milk mustache and here this man pulls up and brother Brandham He says, "Bill," he says, "I've oh," he says, "I started to serve God once." And he begins to go down. He said, "But my little boy is laying at a point of dying right now. It's a bad shape, bad situation." He says, and I, he says, "I want to I want to come back to the Lord." And and Brother Bram begins to describe a few things. He says, "Say." He said, "Were you ever at my house?" Brother Bram said, "Yeah, I just was a few moments ago." &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; In a vision. Now you remember when brother Bram comes into them talking about the right time. The right time. &gt;&gt; The word has already been revealed that the word is thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; When the prophet gets there to the house, he runs or walks over, takes the baby and immediately takes that child and prays for it. And the child got worse. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And you know why? It wasn't the right time. The word was right on the money. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the time this one had to be sitting over here, &gt;&gt; this one had to be in the room. This one had to be Now watch. You see how Satan could come around on that right there. How Satan was trying to no doubt bombard the prophet's mind. But the prophet knew God spoke this to me. &gt;&gt; I may not understand what's going on, but it's thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me right now? &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why when God has made his word known to your heart, there might have been certain things that we thought or certain ideas and and maybe you walked away after having prayer and saying, "I'll never have a pain again." And you wake up with pain in the middle of the night and and you're in this right here. It doesn't mean &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; that the word has not taken effect. &gt;&gt; But everything is in its time. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It didn't say how long. It didn't say how much time. It said they shall recover. &gt;&gt; And when God has made a promise to your heart. &gt;&gt; A promise is swept into your life. Promise for the Holy Spirit, promise for deliverance, promise for healing, promise for your loved ones, &gt;&gt; it shall be even as he has said. &gt;&gt; For he's not man that he should lie, &gt;&gt; nor the son of man that he should repent. Every promise that he has given is yay and amen in him. Hallelujah. And as a believing group of people, listen, we're standing here or drawn together for what? Then an atmosphere of faith is coming together as hearts begin to unite with that word and begin to pulsate. And what happens in moments? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where the right time begins to drop down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm just going to stop here this morning. I could continue on, but we'll just stop here. He's got to know how to go, when to go, and what to do. &gt;&gt; Everything is in the right timing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The when when the angel came down and troubled the water, that was the time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; At a certain season. When? At a certain season. &gt;&gt; Right. Sarah, I'm going to turn I'm going to return to you at the appointed time. &gt;&gt; Right. God has appointed times. And you know what? Let me just tell you something. The Bible talks about what a blessed thing it is to wait upon the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And you know how, sister Carmen, you can really wait on God. Is when God gives you a promise, you can wait. Just like that little lady who the the sons or the owner's son made that promise, I'll be coming back in the springtime. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She took that promise and she waited. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She I'll tell you how she was waiting. She was waiting because she knew the sound of his coming. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And she was ready. &gt;&gt; She didn't look behind and and you know, waving off to those sisters, haha, and everything else. No, no, it wasn't about that. She She was so had been so in love with him to where when he came, she went to meet him. &gt;&gt; You know why? It wasn't about everybody else. It was about her responding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To him. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. The right time. &gt;&gt; The door of mercy being open. The time where the timing that we are living in. It's the right time. This is the hour and the season. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Where it speaks the marriage of the lamb has come. No other age. No other age. But in this age, No other time is it for rapture but this time. This is a it's no other time when this sealing taking place in this hour of the Holy Spirit. This is the timing. It's the time the bride coming into position. &gt;&gt; It's the right time. It's the right season. and how the spirit of God just dealing with our hearts to draw us and to understand there's the right approach to it. There's a how, when, and what to do. Hallelujah. And you know what? God was everything all along here. Friends, when we see where Ruth is at at this moment, the latter kindness, that faithfulness, what was in her heart was expressed. &gt;&gt; Every handful of purpose she picked up, every inspired word along the way was building her faith &gt;&gt; to that moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, this is this is why Satan's busy. Like the prophet says in Christ the mystery, he says, God's wanting to reveal this great secret to you. And listen, friends, this great secret is not doctrines. This great secret is that God knew you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You were always one of his. And when the revelation when that secret becomes a revelation, it drops from here to here. Then it's the mystery of God in your life. &gt;&gt; Here, it's got to come from here to here. When it comes from here to here, that's what brings the change in a person's life. &gt;&gt; That's true. There's there's where there's an anchor, there's an absolute, there's a hold, there's a change, there's a love affair, there's a joy. Let me just say this to you. Sure, you can lose your joy, but let me ask you this. Sometimes the reason that things happen, joy and so forth is gone. It's because things priorities get off. Things get in in our lives. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's unconfessed sin. Hello. And Satan, what Satan wants to do is stall. &gt;&gt; He wants to hinder. &gt;&gt; He doesn't look, Satan doesn't love any of his subjects. He don't even love those who serve him. He never loved us when we when we walked according to the princip, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, he don't care. But Satan's desire is to try to stall and to try to hinder and try to keep back. But this is a moment and a time in this hour for the spirit of God just to really seeking us out. And Lord, if you've got a need upon your heart, let's make an appeal to our kinsmen. Let's make a request. Let me ask you something. Brother Brandham asked the question. He says, "Are we sufficiently impressed with the word that's in our midst?" And following that question, he says, "How do we pray? You say, "Well, brother Samuel, I haven't prayed in a long time." But but why? Why? See, unbelief enters in. Unbelief enters in. One little thing and then Satan wants to try to get you get you away. But what is he doing with that with that of unbelief? Because listen, smoking, drinking, all of those things are attributes of one thing, unbelief. If you believe, you won't do them. &gt;&gt; It's just that simple. When you believe you, you won't do them. You know why? Because it changes you. &gt;&gt; But it's how are we how are we praying? Are we asking God, Lord, fulfill your word in my life? Lord, let it be in me, Lord. Let let the word Lord in my life the appeal to our kinsmen. I tell you, listen friends, only those who are united with him through the Holy Spirit, the token, are going in the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's why the the token, the new birth, it's not just something that's just optional. It's got to it's and it's not just something that's intellectual. &gt;&gt; It's got to be heartfelt. &gt;&gt; It's a reality that reflects through your life. And this is why that even through these things of just taking our time and this this morning is the appeal to our kinsmen. Don't just if you if you if you've been here and I know those that would be streaming and other things just don't you just don't want to sit around this message. &gt;&gt; Get into it. &gt;&gt; Get under the blood. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let the let the Holy Spirit invite him, the kinsman, to completely change your life and bring a real joy down in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let him do it. He wants to do it. &gt;&gt; He's already made a way to come and to do that. He's already paid the price. And you say, "What must I do? Do I got to quit this?" You don't have to quit anything. You have to believe him. &gt;&gt; Believe what he has done for you. And when you really believe, sin will stop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unbelief stops. &gt;&gt; Is that not what Paul said to the Philippian jailer? When the Philippian jailer says, "What must I do to be saved?" Paul never said, "Do this or stop doing this. Stop doing that. Quit doing this. Quit doing that. Quit doing this." Can you imagine? You'd have you'd have had to have books of what not to do or quit doing. But you know what? One thing can take place could take care of all of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; Truth. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Here this morning, that's where I would even make that request. Lord, help thou my unbelief. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Apply the word. Take the word of God that that you're hearing and apply that word to your life. Listen friends, don't just walk out but apply the word to your life. You got to apply the word. The token must be applied. The word has got to be applied to our life. When the word is applied, then the Holy Spirit follows the word. &gt;&gt; If Ruth would have stayed in Naomi's house &gt;&gt; and said, "Well, I'm just going to wait for Boas to come to me." &gt;&gt; It had never happened. It had never happened. &gt;&gt; But Ruth had to make the request &gt;&gt; that he was standing ready to fulfill. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think how the prophet says in the message breach. He said to think he's standing ready. &gt;&gt; One heart that'll touch him. &gt;&gt; One life that'll confess their sin. One life. He said he stands ready &gt;&gt; to redeem. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, glory. He don't have to go to Calvary for one more sin. He took the sin of the whole world. &gt;&gt; He deposited all in hell. Even of all your mistakes and your let down, he don't have to go back one more time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's already taken care of it. He took care of all of your unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just have to say, "Lord, I believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you're so merciful to us, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're mindful to every need in every circumstance. [Music] Lord, I don't know. I don't know all the needs. I don't know the request that's upon the hearts of your children or those that are here in the visible audience, those that would be streaming or would come back and archive this, Lord. I pray, Father. [Music] Lord, may your grace just move down upon hearts, Lord. move down upon each of our lives, Lord, as we're we're standing in need of you, Lord. There's lives, Lord, that I know, Lord, need a real touch from you, Father. Maybe there's things, Lord, that they've went astray and they're just Satan. Lord, just get them so twisted, Lord, in their minds. Get him so twisted, Lord, in these things, Lord, hemmed in by sin and unbelief. But, Father, you're greater, Lord. You're greater, Lord, than that unbelief. You're greater than that doubt, Lord. And father I pray Lord knowing that that hold sometimes Lord through unbelief Lord that would want to just take a hold there. But I pray that God like Ruth when she came into your presence into the presence of Boaz she wasn't she wasn't fearing as far as slavish fear. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She came with the confidence. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I pray here this morning that Father, for the needs that we have among us, Lord, there's needs, God, lives, that need of the Holy Ghost. Need of a real a real birth. Lord, there's lies. There's hearts, Lord, that asking God, seeking for direction, Lord. Father, there's hearts and lives, Lord, that dear God, just desiring just just more of you, just the effect, Lord, through that relationship with you as our kinsmen. Oh God, when there's come that uniting where these that are twain have now become one, Lord, that sanctifying love begins to move in our lives. Oh, it it isn't so much, Lord of worldly desires, but you you move in our hearts, Lord, to be able to lift us in your grace. you begin to change, Lord, our thoughts and our opinions, oh God, I think, Lord, just like a natural husband, Lord, and and a wife, oh God, as they'll begin to fellowship, and there's things, Lord, that when they entered in, Lord, to that marriage now, Lord, there's just such a things change. There's a a resting where that Lord, that that little wife, she rests within what her husband has said about her. Right? and vice versa. He so delights in those praises and commendation where for her it can be the touch of the hand like your prophet would express Lord for that husband to the wife of how that she could just set him down and get on his lap and begin to tell him how thankful she is for him and the things and the care and what he will do and what he does. Lord, through that relationship, that marriage, it's a nourishing, Lord God, that's what you do in our lives, Lord. Hallelujah, through that uniting with our kinsmen, Lord. But it's like your prophet expressed it in the message die thigh house. He said when my wife he said that faith when it begins to move in your heart and it's dropped in your life and that conversion has taken place. He said it's like that love that you have for your wife. It begins to accumulate. Yet Lord this is so much more a higher love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's your unconditional love. And it begins to lift us higher and higher and higher in the realms of grace as we can trust you and believe you. Lord, I pray God right here throughout this congregation, Lord Jesus, may you just move down by your grace, dismantle anything, Lord, in us, &gt;&gt; Amen. that would keep or hinder from believing you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We're appealing, Lord, to you, our kinsmen. &gt;&gt; Oh, granted, Lord God, we need you, Lord. There's needs, Lord, for healing in the body. There's needs, Lord, for deliverance. There's needs, Lord, direction, leadership in our lives. Lord, we're appealing to you, Lord. our kinsmen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't want to make a step without your leading, Lord. &gt;&gt; It isn't that we're fearful. It's just Lord, we don't want to be out of your will. We don't want to be Lord God according to our own thinking. But Lord, we want the mind of Christ. Lord, help us, Lord. I pray, God. Grant it, Lord, for each need, Lord. Grant it, Father. Lord, we love you. We give ourselves to you, Lord. We give this congregation, myself, Lord, into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And there's only one way to touch him. [Music] Just believe. When you call on his name Jesus, &gt;&gt; oh you Jesus &gt;&gt; is all [Music] the be the name. For there is only only one way to judge him. Just believe when you call on his name. [Music] tried so many positions yet she grew worse. sold to Jesus. She came and when the crowd they tried to restrain her. She whispered these words through. Oh touching Jesus and so oh and your life will never be for there's only only wrong way to touch him. [Music] Just believe when you call on his name. I was bound. I was bound when I knelt at the altar. But they said Jesus, he could meet all my need. And when this prisoner found me. [Music] Oh, hallelujah. Set me free. Praise the Lord. Oh, touching Jesus is all that's all that matterers and your life will never be. It'll never be the same. And there's only one way to touch him. Just believe when you call on his name. One more time. Oh, touch Jesus is all that really matters. And your life will never be the same. For there is only one way to touch him. Just believe when you call on hear his name. [Music] Go ahead. You got something else? &gt;&gt; I will share by a heavy burden. I was. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, but the Jesus. Oh, and now No longer the same. Oh, he touched me. Oh, he touched me. And oh, the joy that floods my soul. [Music] Oh, I know that something has happened. And now I know he touched me and made me whole. Never since I met this said savior [Music] and ever since. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. For I shall never cease to praise him. Oh, I shall while eternal. [Music] Oh, he touched me. Oh, he touched me. [Music] Yes, Lord. Touch my soul something something has happened. Oh, and now, oh, I know he touched me. and make me whole. [Music] I want to live the way. He wants me to live. And I want to give until Christmas. &gt;&gt; I want to love love you. There's just no more love for I could never ever out love the Lord. [Music] That kinsman, all of that that type and that word, it speaks of our lovely Lord Jesus. It speaks of the Holy Ghost. This is why Paul when he came to the upper coast of Ephesus and he says, "Have you have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed?" Because the Holy Spirit is the seal that God has recognized your faith. It's a seal. It's a circumcision. It's a covenant. It's life. It's that word living inside of us. So it's not just a Many times we hear that terminology of coming to Christ, but we understand it's coming and being one with him. The Holy Spirit taking a hold of our lives. God takes a hold like he took a hold of Ruth. A decision was made. Ruth labored in the fields. within the Holy Spirit dealing with Ruth to come into that place of uniting. And from the uniting leads to a full reward with all of our hearts, friends, this is we could know everything. We could hear everything we But without him &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And without him having a hold of our life, &gt;&gt; that's what that's what really matters. &gt;&gt; That's right. is that we have the token. We have that assurance. We have that life within us. And I say you don't have to plead with him. &gt;&gt; No. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to beg him. You don't. Jesus said in Luke, he said, "If you ask your father for a loaf of bread or piece of bread, will he give you a stone? You ask him for a fish, is he going to give you something else? He said, "How much more they that ask for the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; will he not give it?" [Music] &gt;&gt; But it's got to be asked for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's seeing our need. And I'll just say it like this. Even as we walk with him, it's seeing our need for more of him. I want more &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to take over more of Samuel Browning. I I need it. &gt;&gt; I want more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To take over more of me until eventually one of these days will be the final taking. &gt;&gt; And like Enoch, he'll take us away. But oh, what a what a promise not only that we have but we have right here with us. Hallelujah. Let that be the heart's prayer. Let it be our desire. Lord, I want to please you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to I want to follow you. He knows the time. He knows exactly right here. He knows exactly. We want to be found ready. &gt;&gt; This is the time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Heavenly Father, Lord, many many requests, many needs as we have already made mention, many hearts, many lives. Lord, even one, every one of the prayer requests, Lord, in every heart that is gathered here, I pray, heavenly father, may Lord, as we would depart from the presence of one another, depart from the presence of this place, but God, may your presence go with us, Lord. bring us into that place, Lord. Bring us into a deeper walk with you. Lord, as we journey through this week, may that when we think of that scripture where Boaz saw the expression of the latter kindness that it was greater than what it was at the beginning, Lord, in our lives, Lord, may we just take just a few moments, Lord, just looking and saying, Lord, Where am I at presently, Lord? Lord, I realize I know that every one of us could no doubt say just like that that sister. May we may we have that joy like that to be able to say it where she could say, "I'm not what I ought to be. I'm not even what I want to be." But one thing I know, I'm not what I used to be. And like Paul could say, I'm pressing toward the mark of the high calling. I'm seeking to apprehend, lay hold, &gt;&gt; of what has laid hold of my life. Grant it, Lord. &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord Jesus. We appreciate you, Lord. Grant it, Lord, through this week, Lord. Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Guide us, Lord, like you guided Eleazer. Lord, direct us. May your kindness guide us, lead us. Direct us, Lord. Decisions, what we have before us. Lord, guide us, Lord. Father, through this week, Lord, even in the midst of our shortcomings, the mercy that's reserved, Lord God. Oh God, we don't take that for granted, Lord. Grant it Lord Jesus. May your presence Lord go with each and every one of us Lord. &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you church. Go in the fear of the Lord.
