amen it's not just that we've gathered together with one another but we're in communion with him tonight amen we're looking for his Spirit to just come amongst us am and speak a personal word to every heart how many would how many would just invite him just now say Lord come and speak to me I have need of you Lord I'm seeking your face tonight amen amen sure is an honor to be with you as always and I always look forward so much to coming up here and having fellowship with you and uh you're just you're just family to us uh just uh as close of a sister church as we could ask for there at your word Tabernacle and and we do bring greetings from home from Brother Wayne Brother Ray and all the uh all the ministry and Saints there uh we we appreciate you and admire you and admire the ministry here and so we just want to be a help along the way tonight I want to say God bless you amen now don't want to keep you tonight we'll just go ahead and go right to the word of God in uh 1 Corinthians chapter 1 kind of walking down some old Trails tonight and uh got a little bit of some fresh material hope that's all right try a a little fresh material out on you you know the thing about when it's fresh sometimes it's a little raw amen but we're just looking for the Lord to put something together here uh I've just had it kind of percolating for a little while and uh and so uh just some precious things to me from the word of God trust and we'll be an encouragement tonight amen 1 Corinthians chapter 1 I'm going to start at Verse 18 just read down to the end there and uh this is this is maybe one of my favorite chapters in The Bible 1 Corinthians chapter 1 Paul says here for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God Amen for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent so where is the wise where is the Scribe and where is the disputer of this world hath not God made made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God so in other words the world has no approach to God through human wisdom carnal reasonings mental conceptions and that is the wisdom of God that it's that way amen so it's not the right approach by wisdom but it pleased God My My by the foolishness of preaching you talk about this is about the only way I could get courage to stand behind In a Pulpit amen is for Paul to acknowledge that by the foolishness of preaching God Saves them that believe how many how many Believers are in the house tonight amen how many are looking for his salvation amen it comes in many forms of healing of encouragement of of provision but uh whatever trouble we're in he's the one who needs to save us from all of our troubles amen and so that's why we gather together and we hear the preaching of the word because it becomes power of Salvation even though it's quite a foolish thing Amen to to to look at from the outside for the Jews require a sign verse 22 and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews he's a stumbling block unto the Greeks he's foolishness but unto them which are called both Jew and Greek he's Christ he's the power of God and he's the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God amen you know that God is foolish amen the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling Brethren not many wise men after the flesh are called I would I'm I'm not one either not many mighty not many noble are called but God hath chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and base things or lowly things of of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen oh my and things which are not to bring to not things that are amen and here's the reason why church that no flesh no flesh no flesh should glory in his presence amen but of him are you in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom watch these labels now he's wisdom he's righteousness he sanctification and he's Redemption to us amen it's of him that we are in Christ and because we're in Christ he's our wisdom he's our righteousness he's our sanctifier and Our Redeemer that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord amen let's pray before we get to preaching here tonight Lord uh we want to glory in you tonight father we want to give you all the glory Lord we we look at ourselves father and and we're very very aware of the foolishness of this flesh Lord the foolishness Lord of who we are and to think Lord that that we could even have faith to believe that we are a people that are possessors of Christ Lord of his Redemption of his power Lord when we look from the outside Lord it looks so foolish and yet Lord your word tells us that you chose those foolish things to bring to not Lord things which are Lord I I feel foolish Lord as a minister Lord to think that I could could help your people Lord with any of my human abilities father but Lord I thankful tonight that it's not our human abilities that we're looking at father but we're looking to your grace Lord we're asking that you Lord would come amongst us by your spirit tonight set our Humanity aside father I pray that you'd anoint these lips to speak your word and anoint also the ears of the hearer to hear father that Lord things of Eternal value Lord uh uh encouragement Lord could be brought along the way I pray that Lord you would strength in your people tonight by the word in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen the foolishness of God I'd like to preach tonight you may be seated like to preach tonight uh I would title it the god of the ridiculous amen the god the god of the ridiculous he is the god of the ridiculous brother brandom in the message led by the spirit of God he said when you've got the Holy Ghost leading you the Holy Ghost will lead you in some of the most ridiculous things that the world ever looked at amen and it'll make you do the most ridiculous things that the world ever thought about he said if you're in the if you're in the upper room you're going to be counted a little bit off you're just a little bit off if you ever been in the upper room you're going to be a little bit off to the people down in the lower levels amen because uh because that that's who we are as children of God there are many many scriptures dealing with the fact that if you're a Believer if you're a if you're a child of God you're not going to be a person that is going to be accept accepted by the world you're not going to be looked by at the world uh uh you're not going to be looked at by the world as normal you're not going to be perceived uh you you'll be an oddball brother Brandon preached a couple messages on that you're going to be you're going to be a Mystic you're going to be somebody uh uh uh and your whole lifestyle your whole attitude your whole mindset is going to be foreign to the people of the world to the point that you'll be looked at as foolish amen uh uh there there are you know there are certain people that respect us for Christianity but on some level anybody who's not a Believer can't quite understand where we're at amen because uh because there's so many things about what we believe uh uh the uh uh there our attitude our bearing as children of God we bear ourselves in a way uh uh like the like the like the son of a king even when he was a slave he had a certain attitude amen where he didn't act like everybody else but see the the thing about that story is he was in the same condition and so people of the world look at us and they see that we're going through the same kind of struggles we've got the same kind of issues and challenges and uh we're subject to the same diseases we're subject to this uh the the the same lack and the same you know and the same problems that and the same pressures brother Bram said whether you're a sinner or a saint you're under pressure right it just because of the environment that we live in so what is it about us that's different the world can't get a hold of that amen and to and to the world it'll always look ridiculous it'll always look ridiculous and if you're thinking in just your carnal human mindset uh the the the way to approach God or the things that God does through his children is always ridiculous so we want to preach tonight on the god of the ridiculous now brother Brandon being the master Storyteller he would say he would say now you want to talk about something ridiculous let's look at and he Paints the picture look look coming down across the hill here now one beautiful morning when the sun's rising and the birds are whistling and here comes an old man 80 years old 80-year-old man whiskers flying this way and white hair bushing behind him leading a little old meal with a wife setting a straddle with a young one on each hip a crooked stick in his hand and here he goes where you going Moses I'm going down to Egypt to take over a oneman Invasion going to Egypt brother Bram said you talk about ridiculous but you see that's the way it is with God when God reveals himself to an individual amen they go out and they begin to do the ridiculous because uh because once faith is Anointed it doesn't look at the circumstances it just looks at the calling it looks at the drive that's on the inside and I got to think about Moses you know to uh uh uh just think about that fact for a moment that Moses here he's going down a a ridiculous sight a one man invasion of the greatest Empire of the time Moses going down to be the deliverer and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt one man an old man at the age of 80 years old and at 80 years old now you you can look down through his life and his life uh was not was not like a highlight reel of successes his whole past life the first 80 years of his life from from birth to 80 amen was a lifetime of failure he had amen you got to understand that Moses uh he had fallen so short he had become so disappointed he was in a state where he was so discouraged until you just run away from it all and he's living out in the wilderness somewhere and you got to understand this about Moses that Moses was a failure but it wasn't the kind of failure that had never tried it wasn't kind of he wasn't the kind of failure who had never attempted Amen to do what he was called to do but he actually had tried it and it didn't work out and so this is somebody amen this is that kind of a failure this is somebody who's known that kind of a humiliation that he was raised to believe that he had a certain calling in his life and every time he put his hand forth to do something about it it it it didn't work out now you and I sometimes feel like a failure here amen but you I don't know if there's anybody even in here who's who's uh who's reach 80 years old but we got to take a little comfort for Moses here amen because a lot of us have tried and we failed right oh brother brother Bill well you're not a failure brother Bill amen but there's a lot of kind of people amen who who who have lived a long time and been Christians a long time and are still feeling like they're a failure feeling like they never got anywhere and that's what kind of the story of Moses is addressing for us and amen is that Moses it wasn't that he hadn't tried it was that he did try and it didn't work amen and that that's kind of a beautiful thing because you're looking at a picture of a man who who who was proven he was weak it wasn't just that he felt weak he was proven to be weak brother brandom taught that he was seven different kinds of weak in perfect strength by Perfect weakness brother Brandon will run through six of them he's seven different kinds brother brand said of weak seven different kinds of week amen amen and so here he is the first 80 years of his life that was as far as he got was to be a failure amen seven different kinds of weak amen had tried and it didn't work out amen but you realize the beautiful thing about the story of Moses is those first 80 years of his life was all backstory it was all backstory brother and sister amen because he was the one man Invader he was the Redeemer of the of the uh he was the deliverer and he was the one that was called to bring the children of Israel out amen so it didn't matter if he tried and it didn't work it didn't matter if he had been humiliated it didn't matter what kind of water had gone under the bridge at 80 years old that was all backstory and it was time for Moses to go do the ridiculous at 80 years old he had never gone he had never C he never parted the waters he never brought water out of the rock he never called Mana Out of Heaven amen he'd never he never met God on Mount Si he never called 10 plagues out of e out of out of Heaven onto Egypt he'd never done any of that amen so how ridiculous must it have been Amen to look at a man who as far as Society knew as far as his family knew as far as Moses knew he was an old failure of a runaway Shepherd amen from the middle of nowhere who tried and it didn't wake out that's pretty ridiculous brother sister amen but the thing about a calling of God it doesn't matter how many times you've tried it doesn't matter how many times it didn't work out amen if God has got a calling on your life if he's got a purpose for you amen he's going to get the job done and everything else is backstory hallelujah amen so maybe maybe if Moses here amen had all of these things even at 80 years old all these things yet laying before him maybe you've still got a future tonight thank you Lord maybe you've still got a future maybe you tried and you failed you've been humiliated you got the devil whispering in your ear amen you feel like a dead End Amen but friends I'm here to tell you tonight amen it start it's time to start thinking ridiculous amen cuz if you're a child of God you've got a future you've got potential amen you've got you've got the attributes in you amen which sometimes take a long time to get brought out of you a lot of times all that backstory is necessary because the first part of the process is getting the pride out of your own humanity and embrace the ridiculous brother R said there's so many of us that like to testify or we like to think that we're insufficient and therefore we make that an excuse true amen who who so how many believe that we're insufficient it's true we are insufficient but brother man said we make that an excuse we make it an excuse we say well you know I'm weak and I'm insufficient and I lack the ability of course you do amen but that's no excuse it's no excuse Amen to believe that God can't use you it's no excuse to believe that God can't move in your situation just because we're weak amen cuz he was never relying on us in the first place but we make it an excuse brother BR said we'll say oh I have no education or I have no ability I'm unable to do this and if you keep up and do that in that way if you keep going like that brother brand said you can't amount to anything but the very thing that we make excuses by our weaknesses God uses that very thing to tackle the job with amen he waits for us he waits for us to get to that condition now it takes a little while amen we make him wait a little while sometimes amen cuz our first instinct is here beings is to go out and make something happen on our own amen it took 80 years to get that out of Moses amen but God will wait for us Amen to get to the condition amen where he can use us we take excuses and say I can't do it I'm I'm insufficient and God he takes that very thing to do the job with that's the reason oh my that's the reason why he chooses us because we're in that condition because we're in that condition now so many times brother and sister we're guilty amen of acknowledging the weaknesses of our self and then we use that as an excuse why God can't do anything in us or through us but brother sister that's the exact condition that he's looking for because the word of God will tell us his strength can only be made perfect through weakness cuz if we were so strong amen then he couldn't get the glory but God is looking for weak Christians if there's a weak Christian in the building tonight God is looking for weakness amen that he can bring his strength on the scene and glorify himself amen because he can do something that's impossible for you to do and he can cause you to live amen at a level that would be impossible for you to live amen he waits for us to get to that condition then he can use us amen and we're always guilty of flipping on its head and making excuses out of weakness when that's the Avenue God wants to work through and we're always in our religious way trying to present god with strength when he is waiting for us to come to the condition of weakness looking for that humility he's looking for that failure amen so that he can come in amen and show himself strong God does not share his glory with human beings amen God is not the story that's going to be told on the other side is not a story about how a mighty God Amen got in touch with a mighty people and the mighty people linked their arms with a mighty God and and they did all kinds of Mighty things amen but the story that will be told about me and the story that will be told about you is how we were so weak and we were so so humble amen and we were so below God's consideration but the grace of God reached down his mighty hand amen and took you and used you as his instrument spoke his word through you walked in your feet amen uh uh uh moved through your hands amen God is looking for weakness to make his strength known amen we're living in the age of perfection and God is looking for a people that are perfectly weak amen that's a see because uh amen see God doesn't share share his glory with human beings but he does reveal his glory through them he does reveal his glory through them the Bible said it's the riches of the glory of this mystery Christ in you the hope of glory what hope of glory would I have brother sister there's no glory in what Nathan Ericson can do there's no glory in what Nathan Ericson can achieve there's no glory in what Nathan Ericson knows or what I can figure out but the only my only hope of glory amen is for the nature of Jesus Christ amen to become tabernacled in this body Amen to shine out something to the world a strength amen that exists and abides in perfect weakness amen that's the right picture brother sister but we get a picture in our head we get a picture in our head of what glorious Christianity should look like amen but you know Paul found something out about that Paul said I become a fool in glorying we're always we're always kind of wanting to glory in who we are and how far we've come and how many quotes we can quote and and and and and what kind of a church member that we are and what our position is and what our ministry is and and all those kind of thing we're always looking for a reason to glory and Paul says you become a fool in glorying you're a fool in any glorying Paul says I glory in my infirmities in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me now how ridiculous how ridiculous to be to actually find your glory to glory in a state of weakness to glory in a state of infirmity our human Minds would tell us surely amen surely it's got to be surely the picture is wrong surely we must become strong surely we've got to become wise surely we've got to become Mighty amen but God doesn't choose the mighty things of this world he chooses the base things of this world to bring to not things that are God is looking for foolish people amen with foolish hopes foolish Ambitions foolish potentials amen and to and to make to make foolish the wisdom of the wise I I love this friends this is H this means everything to me to realize amen that God is not counting on me for anything other than Faith amen other than faith in what he has done he's not looking for my help he's not looking for my intellect he's not looking for my wisdom he's not looking for my assistance amen but he's looking for a vessel amen that he can inhabit he's looking for surrender so he can take over and he can do the thing brother and sister God is going to be the Invincible Army God is going to be a perfect bride God is going to take a rapture amen it's the power of the Holy Ghost in The Believer is going to do all of these things and it's not the more that we can try and the more great we can become but it's the more that we can surrender and the more weak that we are amen I glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon meise amen it's quite ridiculous and this is the same guy now this is not a nobody this is Paul the Apostle amen this is the one who brought the word of God to the Gentiles he's the pattern for all Messengers he's got Authority higher than an angel from heaven and it's Paul telling you I glory in my infirmities amen because I need the strength of God to rest upon me amen Paul Paul is the one who taught us about when that which is perfect is come the reason we've been waiting for a message the reason we've been waiting for a restoration of the word is cuz Paul told us there was Perfection coming that's why we're sitting here in a message church tonight amen because Paul said you got to expect Perfection it's coming Perfection is coming oh my but the same one who taught you about a perfect word is teaching you about perfect strength he said my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect in weakness amen and that's the right way to receive the message brother sister you know you want to believe you want to you want to really get to the root of this message and you want to understand about supersede you want to understand about the Mighty God unveiled you want to understand about about all these things about perfect Faith you got to find out about perfect weakness amen because the brother God had brother brandham the message wasn't complete until brother brandham preached a little sermon called perfect strength in perfect weakness and you got to figure out perfect weakness if you're ever going to have that perfect Faith amen cuz brother sister the message didn't come to create a bunch of superhuman Christians it's not a super duper show amen it's weak people who receiv received a perfect word and a perfect word can do perfect things in people that are perfectly weak wow hallelujah amen you can't see the Masterpiece until you see the flaw because it's the flaw that makes the Masterpiece and you'll never get the picture right about the grace of God in this day about your adoption your election amen your predestination your rapture amen I'll tell you what makes the picture so beautiful is to realize all these Great and Powerful things that are prophesied about you as a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen all of those things will be accomplished in a flesh body that is perfectly weak amen it'll have to break through a human mind which is perfectly weak but there's perfect strength in the perfect work of God Amen the perfect word brings perfect strength to perfect weakness amen and it makes a perfect people now but the world will never recognize it brother BR said to the world you're a sinner right but to God you're not cuz you're in the sinless one amen and how could you be a sinner if you're in Christ the sinless one oh my Hallelujah you realize friends that we need Christ we need Grace we need his strength we need the Lord I know that's simple preaching tonight but that's what you got amen I whenever our mind departs from that whenever we become so proud or so distracted that we lose sight of that that's when we need a reminder friends and it'll come in many forms amen uh receive it by the words of a Preacher otherwise it'll come by the words of a of a of a little strip up or amen it'll come by it'll come by realization of a failure or some test amen God is always faithful to remind us that we need him and we're depending on him and we cannot take one step without holding his hand amen that's the kind of that's the kind of people the bride of Christ is now that's exactly scriptural amen the Bible spoke of the leosan age and it said that there would be a group of people amen that would say oh no I'm rich I'm increased with Goods I got everything I need I'm good I don't need the Lord I don't need anything that's isn't that the layot ofy in church that's the lot ofy in culture that's layot ofy in people is people that don't need anything they got it they're good they're they're wealthy they're rich they're they're strong they and but but the Bible says they don't know they're wretched that's right amen they're miserable they're poor they're blind and they're naked but friends if God's going to call a bride out of leosia Amen that'll be the contrast right there is there will be a group group of people amen that'll say yes sir I'm wretched I'm miserable I need the Lord I'm not okay I don't have enough I'm not good enough on my own I'm not rich enough I'm not strong enough amen I'm weak amen I'm poor amen but if the word could come to me then let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich amen what is it friends we're not of the Leia we're very very aware that need Christ yeah and that's why he was able to come to us in this age cuz we weren in full of Le Odyssey and pride friends if you're a person you're a person how many people sit in mess's churches and they let the devil hound them in their mind and they don't believe that they're bride because there's so much in need but I'm here to tell you that need is the evidence of who you are it is a Vindication of bride material if you didn't feel like you needed Christ you wouldn't be one of his amen but because you're his bride he's your heart's desire he's your heart's Cry he's your life's Mission he's your desperate call he's deep calling to your deep you need him you're not good enough without him you can't make it without him because you belong to him oh friends that's the scriptural bride amen we're not lay out a sin cuz we got need of him amen I do need him that need doesn't disqualify me that identifies me that's the scriptural bride I am riched I need Christ I need the lordu that's a bright testimony I was weak but I overcame Le osia amen I was weak but limbs were restored I was weak but these weak molecules were changed to immortality I was weak the whole time I lacked the funds I lacked the ability I lacked the knowledge I lacked the wisdom but I did it anyway amen oh friends you talk about the foolishness of God how ridiculous that God would come out into leosa it's the greatest Humanity has ever been he's smarter than he's ever been he's got more wealth than he's ever had he's greater smarter stronger healthier wealthier than he's ever been amen he doesn't need anything he thinks and God would come down right into that and he would bypass the strong men he would bypass the religious leaders he would bypass the Chiefs the priests the Kings amen he would bypass all of that every political system every religious system that come down to the gutters amen looking for the weakest lowest dumbest most foolish people how ridiculous that's going to be the bride of Christ friends that's exactly who she'll be am she'll be the people you never expected she'll be the kind of people you never held out hope for she'll be she'll she'll come out of the kind of situations that should have destroyed her should have sent her to Hell amen but something keeps her going oh what is it it's not her ability but it's his grace perfect strength and perfect weakness oh what a message friends amen what a message amen you know you know why he had to promise that he would never leave you or forsake you amen because you're going to feel like he should right that's why he made the promise thank you amen he made it to his disciples he prayed he prayed over them he said God whatever brother Ram said the one thing that he prayed he said let them be with me where I am he prayed that whole long prayer he only asked God for one thing he said let my people be with me let me be with them as I Am with You amen he said I'm going to be with you I'm going to be I'm not going to forsake you I'm not going to leave you nobody's going to pluck you out of my hand he had to promise US that friends because there'd be so many situations when we would feel like he should leave us how many times have you felt like he should forsake you how many times you feel like he should give up on you but he'll never give up on you cuz he's not looking for your strength amen but he's wanting to make his grace great and glorified in your weakness oh friends how ridiculous amen the grace of God I'm a mess I'm a mess I am I I was wretched I was wretched when he found me but you see now I'm a mess with a message that's really what that's really what makes the difference I'm a mess but I've got a message see Satan doesn't fear you at all satan doesn't respect anything you got to bring to the table there's nothing about you Satan's afraid of but he's afraid of the one you represent you're like that Runner amen amen who was carrying a message and it was the king's message that's what you're carrying we got this treasure in Earth and vessels that there's an excellent power it's not us but it's the power of God it's the Holy Ghost Inside you and you're carrying that message you got to and you can tell every devil get out of my way sickness get out of my way trouble get out of my way need get out of my way fear get out of my way depression get out of my way anxiety get out of my way I know I'm a mess but I'm a mess with a message amen don't get out of you don't got to get out of my way but you got to make way for my message amen because it's a message of perfect strength and perfect weakness amen that's why the devil's got to get out of your way not cuz you're some big scary deep mature spiritual right Regal Christian amen no it's because of the one you're carrying on the inside of you amen it's a king's message and he's afraid of the one you represent now see we we got to we got to learn the lesson sometime if we're ever going to overcome brother Bram said in perfect strength he said there's one thing we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life H how many how many would want how many would uh just acknowledge I want that I want to fulfill his desire sure I want God's purpose for my life to be fulfilled I I want to do what God desires me to do amen it's a that's a precious desire amen that that that's how every Christian feels I want to I want to do what he desires me to do brother Bram said there's only one way to do it you got to master the thought of human ability the thought of human ability just the very thought Amen brother Bram said you get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities you got to master that way you got to master that in such a way that you can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us and make a complete surrender that's an overcoming life friends that's a powerful Christian that's a real Overcomer is somebody who is so surrender to God until they are a master of even the thought of I can do it even the thought of I'm good enough even the thought of I'm smart enough you got to master that thing get it to the side get it out of your way so that God can actually use you amen we've seen amen we've been around this message a lot of time a long time we've seen a lot of stuffed shirts we've seen a lot of big egos we we've seen a lot of oneman shows we've seen a lot of big proud spiritual people but I'll tell you what kind of people God God's looking for is somebody who's mastered all of that amen somebody maybe now maybe you had to go through a long backstory to get to that place but when you get to the place where every last thought of I can is gone amen now you're in the condition God can do something to you God doesn't respect persons no we shouldn't respect our own person amen now the reason Paul is preaching this to the Corinthian Church in the first place is because the Corinthian Church they were they were kind kind of a leading Church in the community you see they were kind of they were kind of they had a lot of big shots at the church a lot of aristocratic people in the congregation and they had a lot of good preachers and so you had all these people what what you look at the way they were all caught up and thinking Paul Paul will deal with them in First Corinthians and mention again in second Corinthians it's all these people talking about well I I I'm with Paul you know I I well I believe it the way Apollos teaches it and you know well I'm I'm kind of in the circle with sephus and his guys and and so they had all that's where all their thinking was is you know whose church do you go to and what Circle are you in and what teacher do you listen to and who's who and amen and who's the great one and amen who's important and who's the best preacher and who's got the biggest church and all those kind of ways of thinking amen and Paul had to come and and he before he could preach anything else to him he had to pull out the rug and say there's no flesh no flesh that can glory in the presence of the Lord God's not looking for big God God's not looking for who's who he doesn't care what Circle you're in amen he's looking for weakness foolishness amen he's not looking for the mighty and the noble amen and the and the most anointed as we think amen he's not looking for that at all Paul said you're carnal he said oh yeah Paul Apollo sephus all name dropping you're carnal amen you're thinking on this church level it's all flesh but flesh can't glory in it presence amen amen it'd be the same thing it'd be same thing for me or for you say well you know I go to truart Tabernacle and Wayne Lawson's my pastor and I'm glad for that of course amen but that's not where my identity is that's not where my strength is I'm not a somebody CU I'm a preacher I'm not a somebody because of how many quotes I can quote I'm not a somebody of how many what churches I've preached at or what pulpits I've been behind friends I'm a nobody I'm a foolish person amen but God has chosen the foolish things of this world amen and he'll confound the wisdom of the wise God's looking for weakness friends but how many people are really willing to be weak amen you got to remember what we really are friends we're like David's Mighty Men you could go down back in the Old Testament you can read a lot of great things about David's Mighty Men and what they did I mean they were Legendary Heroes you know the kind of guys that would slay Giants and climb over walls and and uh jump into pits with lions and wrestle them and do all this kind of crazy stuff but you see and we look at that and we think man you know what a bunch of super guys but you're missing the backstory you're missing the backstory amen cuz you read a little bit early you realize how they all got to David in the first place amen they were they were criminals they were they were they were murderers they were they were rejects they were outcasts they were people that the world didn't care about they were people that were hunted they were fugitives they were weak they were people of failure people that messed up people with backgr and Back stories of how it didn't work out failures that's how you become a mighty man amen is it doesn't matter what kind of condition you come out of but if you can get to the king that's right you could be a mighty man excuse me I'm just suffering my throat amen is this all right tonight yeah amen and so you know you got to think about your backstory you got to think about what you've been through through in your life and maybe all that maybe maybe sometimes we're we're sitting in our current condition and we're thinking this is as much as I'll ever be this is as far as I'll ever go this is as high as I'll ever live because I've tried before and it didn't work out there was a man named Gideon Gideon one time amen who received a message he actually received it from an angel of the Lord an angel appears to Gideon but see at the time that he's hearing this message he doesn't even realize who's speaking he thought it was just some guy you know you know right and so some guy amen would come to Gideon's church on Thursday night and he would start talking to Gideon about hey Gideon you're a mighty man and Gideon's like no I'm not no I'm not he said look around look at my house I'm living in a home of idolatry we don't have the victory we're slaves to the to the enemy to the Canaanites uh there's nothing about my life that says mighty there's not even anything that says successful I'm a slave I'm a I'm overcome I'm I I'm nothing I I'm a son of an of a house of idolatry that's all that I am and that's really what he was yeah so how ridiculous was it for somebody to show up at his doorstep and say hey Gideon hail Gideon that Mighty Man of Valor Gideon never fought in a battle Gideon had never he'd never LED an army amen he'd never won a battle in his life all he'd ever done is roll over amen and and let every kind of Idol come in he was living his home was a mess his life was a mess that's the kind of condition that came but I'll tell you what changes things is when you realize it's not just some man talking to you but it's the angel It's the angel of the Lord that appears to You In a Pulpit and he hails you he says you're an invincible Army amen you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you're sinless you're spotless you're Victorious you're Rapture material and all those kind of things friends you got if as long as your eyes are on the weakness amen you're you're you're you're you're always going to be in that condition but if you could get like Gideon and say well hey if I'm chosen of the Lord where are those Miracles where is that overcoming power now you're getting real dangerous for the devil amen where is that Holy Ghost Power where is that Joy where is that peace where is that overcoming amen where is it it wasn't doubt saying it now amen he all of a sudden realized the potential that was in him right God Amen oh and that's how you become a Mighty Man yes sir brother B said notice it takes the weakest the rejected and practically every hero God ever had on the front line was that kind of person weak and rejected right a person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all then that person brother Bram said is just in good shape for God to start using it that's right oh friends amen if you're weak tonight feel rejected tonight you're in really good shape you're in really good shape isn't the word of God encouraging they say oh I I came to church tonight I felt so cast down I felt so insufficient I feel so weak tonight I feel like the weakest Christian a Believer spoken word Tabernacle maybe the weakest Christian in the state of Ohio I might be the weakest Christian in the body of Christ well then you're in great shape you're in great shape tonight cuz you're in the shape where God can use you brother B said God takes those kind of people and and that's his Heroes on the front line see you got to understand amen that when you're weak amen when you've tried and you failed when you got a back story you're the stuff heroes are made out of God that's the stuff God's heroes are made out of see brother we read there how the First Corinthians labels Christ now to the Jews he's he's this to the to the Greeks he's foolishness but to us he's wisdom and he's power now friends I want to be a wise Christian and I want to be a powerful Christian if you're Desiring that you got to accept it in the form that it would revealed itself in amen because our only Power our only wisdom is Christ himself is that right now watch now watch how Christ would come now we think well I I'm supposed to be I'm a Christian I'm I'm a message believer I'm supposed to be powerful Jesus was powerful and here's how he was described to us a tender root out of a dry ground he had no Beauty we should desire him in other words you would have went to Jesus church and went I don't see what the big deal is he's not even that good of a Preacher he's not even that goodlooking he's not don't even sound that smart he talks like a Galilean he's how how could this be the Messiah isn't this the carpenter son who I I grew up with that guy I know where he came from I know who his parents are it couldn't be him that's the kind of power God shows amen amen stricken the Bible said he was smitten he was afflicted if you ever been Afflicted in your life amen then you're showing the same kind of power he showed cuz he was St smitten he was stricken he was afflicted and he was silent like a lamb to the slaughter it didn't budge him he didn't have anything to prove he didn't need to he didn't need to let the whole world know who he was and and what a big shot that he was but he was deity he was he was he was Heavenly Majesty he was he was he was royalty Divinity amen but he didn't feel the need to impress us he didn't feel the need to impress us now that means that some of us have got a lesson to learn about power and wisdom amen because power and wisdom amen of the greatest order the highest order was found in the man Christ Jesus amen and it was so humble when it manifested itself amongst us till the world passed right over the top of it and even rejected it right and that was the power and wisdom of God now why do we think that when we become powerful Christians and when we become very deep message Believers amen that that we got to let everybody know what a big shot we are we got to let everybody know how important and we got to we got to carry ourselves in such a way and remind everybody who they're talking to amen and all these kind of things and you know and how dare he say that to me how dare she treat me that way how dare you know how dare people not recognize who I am but they didn't recognize who he was and he was all power he was all wisdom but there's something about deity friends deity doesn't have anything to prove deity doesn't have any insecurity deity is not jealous deity doesn't compete with others deity is humble yeah he thought it not robbery to be equal with God but being found and fashion as a man he humbled himself even to the Cross oh friends then amen then we're not going to get by acting like some kind of a Big Shot no we're not going to get by a bunch of proud church members amen but if we could get weak if we could get humble amen what kind of a power could come out of your life or my life I'll tell you what you need to do you need to start thinking ridiculous start thinking ridiculous amen oh what what cuz what would you look like if you wielded all the power of Heaven what would you look like to your community what would you look like to your family what would you look like to your church if you wielded all the power of heaven and to Snapp of your fingers you could bring 12 Legions of angels I know what I'd look like and it didn't it wasn't Isaiah 53 amen so so smart guys like me have to listen to Jesus when he says learn of me learn come and learn of me praise the Lord I'm the Son of God right I'm Meek oh I'm lowly amen friends you know very well why he took on that form because he was coming to get a hold of some people that were meek and lowly the weak things of this world the foolish things of this world uh the kind of people that even their friends and family would look at and say him a Christian her a Christian ridiculous but that's who God was coming for friends he's meek and lowly we got to learn something from Jesus amen Jesus Jesus wielded the power of a Son of God and his his adoption wasn't the kind of adoption we are looking for amen he was so Meek he was so lonely he was the littlest guy in the room he was like they said to brother brandom when you went and talked to him you felt like you were the big man and he was a nobody oh friends that's the character of Christ that's where he makes his power known amen if there's one thing amen so many times we're looking for the key and just the right key just the right word if we could just read the if we could study up the right quote or preach the right sermon or say the right thing or do the right thing then we would somehow unlock the potential it's by humility friends it's by it's not in running it's in resting it's not in trying it's in trusting amen oh it's not it's not in wondering it's in praying amen it's how little can you get brother BR said now if you're a somebody he said God can use you but you got to become a nobody so he can make a somebody out of you God's looking for nobody's friends amen I wonder if there's somebody looking for him him and nobody looking for him tonight oh the word of God brother BR said is foreign to people it's unusual God always does the unusual that's why we he missed him because they thought he would come they thought he would come and do things with Godlike power that they would do they thought he would rip open the temple veil and step out with shining gold armor and a magical sword and you know say hey Caiaphas I've arrived and and we're going to go overthrow the Romans and we're going to take over the world and we're going to put everybody under our foot and we're going to usher in a kingdom like David and Solomon only dreamed of and that was what they were thinking and so when he came and he was born on a pile of manure how could they receive him as the Christ it didn't look like what they expected but I'm so glad that he defies our expectations it's good that he does it friends it's good that he does the unusual there was a woman one time the Pharisees got a hold of her she wasn't a good woman she was life was a wreck she was a sinner and they caught her red-handed and they drug her to Jesus they said hey we're going to take you to this guy he's the he says he's the word and the word has got a couple things to say about what you've been doing how many ever felt like that I can't go to church tonight I I I I I'm so messed up in in in a situation I've fallen in such a trap I can't go hear that word cuz that word's got some things to say about what I'm doing but it wasn't what the word said it was what the word did and what the word does always defies our expectation he's always more gracious he's always more merciful he's always more good than we expect he's a gracious God oh so many time we so afraid to take your issues to Jesus you'll be surprised You' be surprised what he'll say you'll be surprised what he'll do if you take your problems to Jesus that's right amen amen don't let him make don't make it an excuse why you can't go to him amen go to him go to him I know there's Pharisees all through the church everywhere you look there's legalists there's judgers and amen there's people even men even preachers make make they build whole Ministries on just tearing people down and beating them down and making them feel bad and condemned but friends the word never hurt anybody like that Jesus never hurt anybody like that if you could get past all that church stuff get past the legalism get past the religion the tradition and all those things if you could get to Jesus tonight he'll surprise you he won't act like you expect amen because his strength is made perfect in weakness he's looking for weak people to come to him and he could be their strength There's Hope friends I know it sounds ridiculous but there's hope there's hope for whatever situations you're in There's Hope for whatever you're dealing with There's Hope even if you failed a 100 times there's hope that's right but Jesus is the only one who's God he's the power and the wisdom of God oh it's so good that he defies our expectations and that's why brother Bram said you'll do ridiculous things Y when you want to see Jesus yeah you'll do ridiculous things when you want to see Jesus there's nothing going to stand in your way they can call you a Holy Roller or whatever they want to but if you got your mind made up to see Jesus you'll go see them anyhow that's why he said when Jesus is around there's a lot of noise that's why sometimes you come to church you think why you know why why is that guy hollering I know about his problems and why is she why is she screaming so loud I know she's a human being and you know why is why is that little one up at the altar you know why I I know what kind of situations they're dealing with but I'll tell you what it is they get they're trying to get to Jesus so they don't care what you think they don't care who's listening they'll get noisy they'll get desperate amen they'll push through cuz they know that he's the only one with the answers he's the only one with the strength he's the only thing that has what we need of friends that's what makes the bride of Christ is the bride needs Jesus that's what makes her who she is she's people that need Jesus and they need him enough they'll push through denomination they'll push through tradition they'll push through churchianity they'll push through everything just to get to Jesus the Lord you'll do ridiculous things once you understand yes sir that you need Jesus people can't always understand all that noise but we got to get to Jesus friends I I don't want to be some formal lukewarm powerless stuffed shirt of leosia I don't want to be one of these prideful Christians that I see walking all over the world with their nose in the air telling everybody what's what I'm just a person amen who recognizes I was wretched I recognize that I'm poor I recognize that I'm miserable amen but I'm desperate enough that I'll get to Jesus somehow I'll wash his feet with my tears I'll dry him with my hair I'll do what it takes Glory cuz I need him because I'm weak that's bride material yes sir the bride needs Jesus hallelujah oh see I I'm not waiting for until everything's going right and then I'll go to God oh no I'm crying out for him I'm desperate for him I need help tonight I need him I need the Lord amen oh but see if I could get to Jesus then First Corinthians says of him I'm in if I'm in Christ then to me he is with wisdom to me he's righteousness he is my sanctification he is my Redemption he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord if I can get into Christ and know that I'm in Christ and know where I stand then I can Glory even in infirmity amen because my righteousness is not the righteousness of Nathan Ericson my even my sanctification is not the sanctification the religiousness that Nathan Ericson can produce my Redemption is not my works but my my my righteousness my worth my virtue my Holiness is Christ's because I'm in him and Friends whenever I feel a little bit apart from him amen there's something in me that oh I get so desperate I said God I got to get back to you CU that's my only hope the only way the only way I'm going to overcome the only way I can do it is in you Christ yeah it's the foolishness of God see see the Great Men won't let him in so he's look for somebody weak there's somebody yeah yeah there's better people he could work with but they won't work with him right but friends if you're a if you're an empty vessel if you're an empty vessel tonight there is a power that can so fill you so take over so take control oh my and we need that every day we need to die to who we are and let the Life of Christ be born AR fresh in us oh we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallah see Great Men won't let them in there's better people there's better preachers oh yeah I'm very aware of that you but he's looking for weak friends when I think the more that the longer I think I've been preaching 10 11 years now and the and the more I go on the more absurd the whole institution looks to me the more foolish how many preacher Mondays have I had how many Saturday nights oh God saying oh God what am I going to say say tomorrow how many how much weakness is involved how much Humanity I think if people really sometimes I think if you really understood how much Humanity goes into preaching it would alarm people it's foolish it's foolish as brother Wayne would say it would be much more advantagous if he would use Angels it would be way better we'd be way better off if you came to church on Thursday night and an angel of from Heaven slipped down through the rafters and took stuck the pulpit but it's not it's Nathan Erikson The Village Idiot of idiot Village it's foolish friends it's foolish to think of preaching that God would take a man a young man a man of failures a man of infirmities a man with issues a man who needs Jesus and then that man is supposed to speak words that can help somebody else and that's God's program but it is God's program cuz God doesn't want to use Angels he wants to use human beings and so he uses preachers he uses deacons he uses Housewives he uses Factory workers he uses Farmers he uses anybody he can get a hold of and the weaker they are the better off they are amen cuz then they don't get their own pride in go to God's way oh it's a foolishness of preaching but it can save your soul tonight amen it might not be the greatest preacher in the world but it can save your soul tonight the preaching of the Gospel I tell you it gives a man courage amen it's an absurd institution it's ridiculous it's a dumb way to do it by our human way of thinking but that's how God operates he takes foolish things right and he does mighty Works yes sir he does mighty Works how many of you were brought into the kingdom of God in the first place because of the witness of a Believer and my when they first when they first reached out to you and brought you into the fold and they that person was so heroic to you you thought that was the most spiritual person on the and then you went to church with them for a little while and you realized hey I appreciate what that guy did for me to witness to me but he's got some issues she's got some issues that's the beautiful thing about it friends we've all got issues amen but we got Jesus we got the Holy Ghost amen it's the strength of God it can do perfect things through perfect weakness Hallelujah see that's the thing about it friends you got to recognize what deity In the Flesh looks like it doesn't look like what you expect what did deity In the Flesh look like in the backside of a desert next to a burning bush amen crying and stuttering over all of his failures amen deity amen deity in flesh amen out naked in a boat fishing amen it didn't look like amen when you're looking at the backstory it doesn't look like what you think deity In the Flesh looks like we always want to look at how he parted the sea but we won't want to look 10 seconds earlier when he was crying and begging God to come on the scene oh friends deing the flesh when you look at it it's ridiculous you see cowardness you see fear you see temper you see worry you see complexes you see all all manner of weakness right but if you watch a little while you'll see deity that's why that's why God does things through prophets you know that's the great Obstacle of this message this great this message is the greatest message ever hit to the Earth sir but to receive this message you're going to have to get over a pretty big obstacle because you're going to have to look past the veil of a Kentucky hillbilly with a 7eventh grade education amen that is the that is the cost of Entry Amen to get into this word amen is to get over the speed bump of William brandom but see if you're ever going to see the message you're going to have to recognize that deity was speaking from the lips of William brandom as a mouthpiece of God well then just bring it down a few more steps if you can recognize deity in a prophet you're going to have to accept deity In the Flesh of your pastor you're going to have to accept deity behind the Flesh of a Preacher you're going to have to accept deity in your spouse your neighbor and guess what church you're going to have to recognize deity in you Christ in you the hope of glory that's what that oh it's a big obstacle I know to our carnal minds but that's where we got to get to to really see the message and that's why to this world the message is the most foolish thing how ridiculous how ridiculous how ridiculous man to your neighbors and brother Billy you've been such a great uh witness for years and years and had a burden for people Amen to to testify and reach out to people and how ridiculous did you look many times sitting on someone's porch or talking to that coworker and that you know and trying to share about this great message of of of of of uh of powers of deity restored to the bride a perfect word restored and they're looking at the messenger they're looking at the vessel Brother Ray how many times people looked in youi and thought how ridiculous how ridiculous Amen brother Zach that amen that that that God you know there's there's doctors of divinity and there's there's popes and Bishops and people study all their lives to know about God and that God would come and be a personal God to you how ridiculous how ridiculous we had some special meetings a few months back and my little girl she was six years old at the time got up by herself and wanted to go through the prayer line and ended up just just uh laid out at the altar weeping and in the presence of the Lord just 6 years old under her own valtion she went we got in the car to go home and uh she called the the the car with me and she said Daddy that was the best night of my whole life friends you talk about the foolishness of God we got six-year-old girls that know more about the presence of the Lord than doctors of divinity phds llds friends that's the kind of people God's looking for he doesn't come to the Great Men he doesn't come to the great institutions he doesn't come to the to the leading men or the leading churches he comes to foolish things of this world so that he can confound the wisdom of the wise it's the wisdom of God that he made it that way that's the way that he set it up amen amen well so many things to say we're we're running out of time here but you see brother brandom said that God makes it ridiculous all faith is ridiculous to the unbeliever in other words this whole thing that we believe this whole this whole message this belief system that we hold dear this whole thing to carnal thinkers you're never going to explain it right you're never we're never going to present it right we're never going to get people to just accept it up here it's something down here amen but if it ever drops down here for you brother sister then it doesn't matter how ridiculous it looks to other people he said faith is only real to God and the one who has it oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah so I don't know what you think is possible in your life tonight I don't know I don't know what you came to this service tonight and you felt like here's who I am and here's the ceiling of my potential and it's ridiculous to think that I'd ever be anything more or else or it's ridiculous brother Nathan to think that I could ever really be much of a Christian at all but it's time to start thinking ridiculous that's my message to you tonight it's time to start thinking ridiculous good amen that's that's this third pole Ministry you know uh have you ever you ever listened in a while to that story how brother BR spoke those squirrels and you think wow what a mighty supernatural act that happened but he was all tore up in his mind the whole time he was doing it you you talk about perfect faith brother bram's out there thinking Lord did I just imagine that I mean was that really you or was you know or am I just making that up and he was all had all those things in his mind amen but he was he was thinking about a scripture he was thinking about a scripture not if I say but if you say to this mountain he began to meditate on that he didn't it it wasn't that he was in a real spiritual mood he was out in the woods doing what he liked to do in that moment oh my you see there's so much Humanity in the story if you look if you look for it that's right that's right amen but he said look not if Jesus said it but if you say it yourself and I say he said somehow somehow I've broke into that channel praise God and I know he's here cuz I'm almost I'm almost beside myself amen sometimes sometimes you're in your most human moment and all of a sudden you feel a little beside yourself and you realize he's come on the scene watch what happens when he comes on the scene he'd already look look he said that that he's already spoke squirrels and he's right back in this state of all tore up and well so you know what he said he said okay he said I'll make this one ridiculous right right right said there'll be a red squirrel come down off the hill come right down this way and right by me and go out sit on the limb look down there at their farmer and here he came down the hill and he went right out and sat and looked at the farmer and I shot him friends make it ridiculous tonight make it ridiculous all faith is ridiculous to everybody but God and the person who's got it amen do you love him tonight let's standall amen God bless you tonight Hallelujah he's the god of the ridiculous yes he is hallelujah I wonder I wonder if uh while faith is in the room tonight yeah you'd like to you'd like you got a need you got something in your life and it it seems impossible it seems ridiculous amen maybe you're just as tore up in your mind is as brother Brandon was seconds before he spoke a squirrel into existence amen would you just make it known to him Lord I believe you I believe that you're the god of the ridiculous I look at myself Lord I feel so foolish but I recognize you're looking for
