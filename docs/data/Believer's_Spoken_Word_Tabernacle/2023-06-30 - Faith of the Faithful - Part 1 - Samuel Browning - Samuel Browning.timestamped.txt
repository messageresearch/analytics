[37:46] Saving Grace
[37:49] for one who is out in the world and
[37:52] everything that can be upon their life
[37:54] it's just as much miracle-saving grace
[37:56] for one who said in the church view all
[37:59] of their life
[38:00] and finally meets God
[38:02] because the miracle is the new birth
[38:06] and that's a miracle within itself to
[38:09] know that we have passed from Death unto
[38:11] life
[38:12] amen we have become Miracles amen amen
[38:17] may God bless you I will let you have
[38:18] your seat just for a minute here before
[38:19] I read the scripture and I won't keep
[38:21] you that long but uh I just want to say
[38:24] thank you you the prayers uh for the
[38:28] meetings that were there not only the
[38:30] travel
[38:31] um because even with the travel going
[38:34] there and coming those are things that
[38:36] really I dreaded I don't like I don't
[38:38] like travel I especially don't like long
[38:40] travel even traveling in the states
[38:43] eight hours sometimes by car anymore
[38:46] causes me to hesitate
[38:48] I'm just now you might say you're weak
[38:50] that's fine you can think that but I
[38:53] just I don't like weariness and
[38:55] tiredness and so sometimes those are
[38:57] things that uh you know I'm not
[38:59] spiritualizing at any all I'm just
[39:01] saying it's my flesh
[39:02] that I don't want to do that and then
[39:05] there's times then I hear Brother
[39:08] branham's hay on his old model T4 and he
[39:11] said I only got he said maybe 30 miles
[39:13] and that's 15 miles one way and 15 miles
[39:15] the other way so I said God forgive me
[39:18] but it still doesn't take that away and
[39:20] uh you know and and you're just um I
[39:23] always tease my wife I said you know I'm
[39:25] back in the cattle car section I'm
[39:27] loaded on with the rest of the cattle in
[39:29] the plane and you know and said here we
[39:31] are getting in I said we're you know
[39:33] getting the cattle ready for the
[39:34] slaughter uh you really you know those
[39:37] seats certainly don't get any more
[39:39] comfortable and they don't get any
[39:40] cheaper they become more High more they
[39:43] become higher and so just like when I
[39:46] was talking and brother Ronnie and
[39:47] brother Nathan were communicating to me
[39:49] beforehand and I said I said I'm just
[39:51] praying that I'll get a bump to first
[39:53] class because there's no way I'm paying
[39:55] that kind of money to do that uh going
[39:58] overseas those you look at it you know
[40:00] that's that's quite a bit of money you
[40:02] can put a portion of a car you could pay
[40:05] for with that kind of money so you know
[40:08] I just I thank God for his grace but the
[40:11] prayers that Not only was there because
[40:13] it just I was able to sleep on the
[40:15] flights going there and coming because I
[40:16] had to go into when I entered it was a
[40:18] brand new day for them and so it was a
[40:21] 24-hour flight day for me and then even
[40:24] coming back home when we got home last
[40:26] night but the the meetings and the
[40:28] services I you know I would like to
[40:30] perhaps in one of these moments to just
[40:33] share a few of the pictures and things
[40:35] with you not now but because I just have
[40:37] to kind of preserve my energy here but I
[40:40] want to say that your your prayers they
[40:42] were effectual I know you were praying
[40:44] and others were praying as well in in
[40:46] other assemblies and brothers and
[40:48] pastors and other places too but you
[40:51] weren't there to see it but I want you
[40:52] to know it was effectual many the lives
[40:55] of young people were changed I'm just
[40:56] we're just getting reports coming in
[40:58] lives and I know just from right there
[41:00] where those that were had you know came
[41:03] under bondage spirits and there's no you
[41:07] know restriction there in Australia it's
[41:09] Satan owns all the kingdoms of the world
[41:11] he has him under his possession right
[41:13] now but but they are they're coming
[41:15] under the the complete rulership amen of
[41:18] the Lord Jesus Christ and the Sons and
[41:20] Daughters of God and the Millennium but
[41:23] uh in the meantime you know just so many
[41:25] wonderful deliverances that God brought
[41:27] salvation and the the Holy Ghost to
[41:30] lives and I stood there and we I
[41:33] ministered with uh brother uh Freddie
[41:35] from New Zealand he's actually a South
[41:38] African transplant in New Zealand but
[41:40] brother Freddy has a testimony 85 years
[41:43] old and I he certainly doesn't look like
[41:45] 85 he doesn't preach like 85 he my
[41:48] goodness I mean he but it's just such a
[41:50] such wisdom and how God used it and uh
[41:53] you know brother Daniel took a moment in
[41:55] a service after brother Danny uh brother
[41:58] Freddie had preached the second service
[41:59] and brother Daniel said it like this he
[42:01] said I just want to take this
[42:03] opportunity to put my foot on a devil
[42:05] that would like to raise up and say that
[42:08] the young people only need young
[42:09] Ministries to speak to them because
[42:11] young people understand young people and
[42:14] he says he and it was very true he said
[42:16] I don't know if I want a man trying to
[42:17] understand me and figure me out and we
[42:20] understand God uses young men is that
[42:22] right but what what is being said is is
[42:24] that it's just something that we're not
[42:26] looking at things coming from an
[42:28] approach of youthfulness of mind but we
[42:30] want the mind of Christ because he's the
[42:32] one who knows us he's the one who knows
[42:34] how to operate and so you know it it
[42:37] really doesn't matter the age it just
[42:38] how God spoke so so personally and so
[42:41] your prayers I wish I had I know their
[42:44] videos and things online I didn't
[42:47] um I wasn't aware that all of that was
[42:49] going to be posted or the streaming or
[42:52] else I could have provided the link for
[42:53] those of you that wanted to look at that
[42:55] the links are out there so if you want
[42:57] that to go back into some of the
[42:59] services we'd be certainly happy to give
[43:02] those to you it's not anything that's
[43:03] hidden so it's there but I just want to
[43:05] say your prayers thank you for your
[43:07] prayers while we were there and for the
[43:10] entirety of the meetings because though
[43:12] you didn't see it but I can tell you it
[43:14] was effectual and I know it was the
[43:16] strength of the Lord that guided us
[43:18] through every every service and even the
[43:21] direction of the thoughts and how things
[43:22] could be changed in a moment's time and
[43:24] and then just to see the outcome and
[43:26] then you see the reports coming in and
[43:28] different ones and the Investments that
[43:30] were made on their part to be there and
[43:32] one of the parents wrote and said it's
[43:34] the best investment I ever made in my
[43:36] child
[43:37] because it did it cost a little bit to
[43:40] go there and so we just we just want to
[43:44] say thank you and God bless you I I know
[43:46] I probably could have said that shorter
[43:47] but I want to also talk to you a little
[43:49] bit too and and just to say I love you
[43:51] it's good to be back home and just pray
[43:54] you'll just continue to pray for me if
[43:56] God will help me to continue to get my
[43:58] legs and my strength underneath me and
[44:00] not only for the service here but Sunday
[44:02] and then Services there at byc in the
[44:05] upcoming week so just just so thankful
[44:08] to God for his Mercy aren't we amen God
[44:10] still moves amen he moves in a wonderful
[44:13] way and so
[44:15] um but uh yeah with brother Freddy and
[44:17] then his wife sister Doreen just
[44:19] tremendous people I to me as I told the
[44:21] people there I said now I found there's
[44:22] another oak tree to set underneath of
[44:24] and uh you know I don't make no bones
[44:27] about that when I you find that it's
[44:29] it's you know it's somebody who feels
[44:30] like they have something to impart to
[44:32] you those are the people I don't want to
[44:34] set under
[44:35] are you hearing me I'm not interested in
[44:38] that because that's not that's not God I
[44:40] don't understand our makeups are all
[44:41] unique and different but that's that's
[44:43] not that's not anything that's going to
[44:45] help us but when you have us when you
[44:47] have something that where someone has
[44:49] been through something and here they're
[44:50] standing at 85 years old and they're not
[44:52] standing there with a instructioning
[44:54] thing but you're just their life just
[44:57] speaks of it you know and it's just it's
[44:59] just something you just want to zip and
[45:01] just watch and learn and take in and
[45:03] absorb and and uh so I just so
[45:06] appreciated that with with brother
[45:08] Freddie and uh so I was hearing the
[45:10] South African accent over there pasta
[45:12] and yeah so it was just uh it was just
[45:16] wonderful amen our our brother and so
[45:18] keep them in prayer and um let's just be
[45:22] praying here as we turn to the word of
[45:23] the Lord if you'd like to stand Amen on
[45:26] your feet God bless you musicians thank
[45:27] you
[45:28] amen I want to look here in the
[45:31] scriptures at Job 23
[45:33] and verse 8 I want to read a few verses
[45:36] of scripture that we read from here
[45:38] um
[45:39] where we've been in this chapter of 23.
[45:43] and I want to say I think I've mentioned
[45:46] this to you I I certainly did not start
[45:48] into this journey back in the fall of
[45:51] last year uh of my own accord and I
[45:54] certainly did not start into this of
[45:56] thinking that we would go through the
[45:59] Book of Job like this but my this has
[46:01] just been wonderful things that what you
[46:03] see within the Book of Job that's laid
[46:05] out all the way through the chapters if
[46:07] you can you see that and I trust God
[46:09] continuing to give us glimpses of that
[46:10] you see the whole Bible here in the Book
[46:13] of Job you also you see from before the
[46:16] foundation of the world you see Calvary
[46:18] and then you see an end time Revelation
[46:20] you see a fool working and how God works
[46:23] through it all and so it's just it's one
[46:25] of those things that even as I just
[46:27] waited on the Lord and sometimes I feel
[46:29] like I'm gonna go here or maybe to move
[46:31] to this chapter and there's a lot of
[46:33] things as you continue to study that
[46:35] inspiration comes but there's times
[46:37] where everything comes together and a
[46:39] lot of things you've been uh studying
[46:41] sometimes over years and things just
[46:43] kind of converge on you and those are
[46:44] wonderful moments and that's what I want
[46:46] to just look at here beginning this this
[46:49] evening and we want to start with verse
[46:51] 8 and maybe before we read could we just
[46:54] have a quick word of prayer and just ask
[46:55] the Lord just to just speak to us
[46:58] tonight
[46:59] Heavenly Father Lord we just want to say
[47:02] thank you for your grace Lord thank you
[47:04] for your mercy Lord once again Lord as
[47:07] we would stand here in this moment
[47:09] together Lord speaker hearer we lord
[47:13] have a desire to hear from you Lord and
[47:16] to see you Lord may you come Lord and
[47:19] help us together to step aside Lord not
[47:22] only as I would yield Lord of of my body
[47:25] my spirit my mind all of my being to you
[47:27] but God that we would also yield
[47:30] ourselves to you apart from all of the
[47:32] cares of life and all the burdens Lord
[47:35] that would be upon us may we lord yield
[47:38] ourselves to you in this moment and oh
[47:40] God that you'll come and take control we
[47:43] pray for your glory we ask in the name
[47:45] of Jesus Christ amen amen job 23 verse
[47:49] 8.
[47:50] job said behold I go forward but he is
[47:54] not there
[47:55] and backward
[47:57] but I cannot perceive him that's very
[48:00] key I cannot perceive him it doesn't
[48:02] mean that he's not there but he's there
[48:05] I can't perceive him but he's here
[48:07] on the left hand where he does work but
[48:10] I cannot Behold Him he hideth himself on
[48:14] the right hand that I cannot see him but
[48:18] he knoweth the way that I take
[48:22] how does he know the way you take job
[48:24] because it is his way
[48:27] it's the harder way
[48:29] and I have made that choice
[48:31] God has revealed his way and I have
[48:35] yielded to God's way he knows the way I
[48:38] take
[48:39] amen when he hath tried me I shall come
[48:42] forth as gold my foot hath held his
[48:47] steps
[48:48] his way have I kept and not declined
[48:53] neither have I gone back from the
[48:56] Commandment of his lips
[49:00] I have esteemed the words of his mouth
[49:04] more than my necessary food
[49:08] amen may God bless you and bless the
[49:10] reading of the word as you're being
[49:11] seated
[49:12] I want to begin here tonight we were
[49:16] dealing with um
[49:18] faith and that of on the last time that
[49:22] we were together and looking at this in
[49:25] a channel staying at a place that that
[49:27] channel where Faith itself can drop in
[49:30] our lives because the whole work or
[49:33] whole walk of our life as a Believer is
[49:35] a walk of faith
[49:38] and faith is not is not hope remember
[49:41] brother Branham would bring that
[49:42] together
[49:43] for us to understand that hope is
[49:46] Faith's worst enemy and faith in order
[49:49] to really have hope in the right
[49:51] position Paul would lay that out by the
[49:54] scripture and say it's uh that the
[49:56] greatest and oh how all of these are is
[49:58] that of Faith love and charity that it's
[50:02] it's love that unites it's love that
[50:05] brings the order to all of those things
[50:07] in other words so that we would have an
[50:10] expectation that is based in faith in
[50:13] God and when I looking at this and and
[50:17] looking at it I just want to just step
[50:19] into it for a few moments tonight and
[50:21] really dealing with that thought when we
[50:24] look at Faith and we Faith itself can if
[50:27] I can say it in this way can be such a
[50:28] mystery it can seem like such a great a
[50:32] great a great big thing and it is a
[50:34] great big thing but yet it's a very
[50:35] simple thing and Faith itself is what
[50:38] God has has ordained that we would know
[50:40] him by remember he gave us the five
[50:43] senses in this Natural Body to contact
[50:46] our Earthly home but God gave us one
[50:49] sense that where we can contact our
[50:51] Heavenly home and that's faith and man
[50:54] when man failed man walked away from
[50:57] that man forfeited that contact and that
[51:01] channel that that openness to where that
[51:05] God was able to come down and speak to
[51:07] him at any time did God come down when
[51:10] he failed he did but you see When sin
[51:13] entered in it caused man to withdraw
[51:15] from God so then what happened is the
[51:19] channel became clogged the channel
[51:21] became blocked up because God only
[51:24] expects you and I and what he requires
[51:27] and has designed you and I to be a
[51:29] channel just like a garden hose that we
[51:31] hook up out here the garden hose doesn't
[51:33] is not the water but the guard the
[51:35] garden hose is only a chance channel
[51:37] that the water can flow through and
[51:39] that's the same way it comes down into
[51:40] our lives it's not us that's why brother
[51:42] Brahm says you know when they would say
[51:44] bring the Divine healer out here and
[51:45] brother Brahm said well he says to Dr
[51:47] best he said I'm no more a Divine healer
[51:50] than you would be a divine Savior he is
[51:52] recognizing that we are put here as
[51:54] channels of God many times we want to
[51:58] see things take place I want to see this
[52:00] one healed or I want to see God move in
[52:01] this area of my life but none of us can
[52:04] speed that along we can't speed that up
[52:06] but there's things that we can do to
[52:08] ensure that our lives are in position
[52:10] that faith can drop at that moment
[52:13] there's many times that we'll take a
[52:15] promise of God by his stripes we are
[52:17] healed and we should we should take that
[52:19] whether we feel anything or not whether
[52:21] it has even been revealed to us in that
[52:24] moment that at that moment that that by
[52:27] his stripes I'm Healed it's still a
[52:29] promise of God and God has been revealed
[52:32] to us and because God has been revealed
[52:35] to us then every promise in him is yea
[52:38] and amen and that's where faith will
[52:41] take its stand upon the word of God and
[52:43] wait for the Revelation for this need
[52:46] this situation to drop and Faith itself
[52:50] when in order for that that in it in
[52:52] itself and moving it works to clear all
[52:55] things that could be that of a hindrance
[52:58] I want to deal with the thoughts here
[53:00] and there's no way that we'll get to
[53:02] where uh we perhaps will will get to uh
[53:06] in in other times but I want to deal
[53:07] with faith and faithfulness and we hear
[53:09] many times we read and I've referred
[53:11] this to you at many times it's been kind
[53:13] of like something that just bubbles over
[53:15] and that is when you read in the
[53:17] scriptures where it'll say thy faith has
[53:19] saved thee thy faith your faith and yet
[53:21] we also recognize that we see God's
[53:24] faith and God's faith is God's own life
[53:27] but yet God has entrusted us with faith
[53:30] but that faith that we have even as God
[53:33] deals with our life must come under the
[53:35] anointing of God's faith in other words
[53:38] we must be born again then when we're
[53:41] born again then it is no longer our
[53:44] faith acting alone but it is God's faith
[53:47] moving us according to his word and so
[53:50] this is where then as we would go and we
[53:52] talk about faithfulness being faithful
[53:55] and faithful and tough times faithful in
[53:57] the good times faithful so there must be
[53:59] an origin for faithfulness to arise from
[54:03] and so I want to just begin here tonight
[54:05] to deal with that thought on faith a
[54:08] faith of the faithful because there's no
[54:11] greater consideration that we could have
[54:13] than for God to be able to look upon us
[54:15] and say that well done thou my good and
[54:20] faithful servant because remember that's
[54:23] who's coming with him who's going in a
[54:25] Rapture who will be at the wedding
[54:27] supper who will come back in the return
[54:29] of the Millennium it's designated that
[54:32] with him came the armies of Heaven The
[54:35] Chosen and faithful
[54:37] so faithful is a quality that is a
[54:40] quality of the redeemed of the elect of
[54:43] the chosen faithful in all things so
[54:46] when we consider that for a moment uh
[54:49] knowing that that job himself he had job
[54:52] had a revelation of God and job with
[54:56] that Revelation he waited on God even
[55:00] when he did not know what was taking
[55:02] place in this in these chapters here as
[55:05] I told you before I don't know right now
[55:07] the longevity of time that all of this
[55:10] unfolded but what I do know that
[55:12] throughout this longevity in this period
[55:14] of time job was anchored by the
[55:18] revelation of God in his life even when
[55:22] job's thoughts about what were happening
[55:25] were thoughts that weren't uh in the
[55:28] right place as though God was against
[55:30] him but he could not move him off of
[55:34] that Revelation that I know God I've met
[55:37] God and I'm walking in God's provided
[55:40] way because he wasn't something job had
[55:43] been talked into it was one that job had
[55:46] met you see it we're talked into
[55:49] something we can be talked out of it if
[55:51] you're persuaded into something you can
[55:53] be persuaded out of it that's why
[55:55] Revelation is not a mental exercise it's
[55:59] not knowing of the knowing everything
[56:01] all I know this scripture I know this
[56:03] scripture but it's about have you met
[56:06] God personally
[56:08] do you know him in the power of his
[56:12] resurrection and this is a faith that
[56:15] job had and brother Branham would say it
[56:17] in this way that job he waited if you
[56:19] display that first quote there he says
[56:21] job waited for his faith to be confirmed
[56:25] because he had a grip on God a
[56:28] revelation I I just have to go with this
[56:31] for a moment job waited for his faith
[56:34] notice whose Faith was it job's Faith
[56:36] but house was job's Faith brought to a
[56:39] place to where it had a grip on God
[56:41] because it was a divine revelation job
[56:44] was not holding like Moses held for a
[56:47] period of time my mama taught me this
[56:49] and they taught me this and then when
[56:51] things didn't go the way it should Moses
[56:53] ran right that was Moses faith but when
[56:56] Moses got before the burning bush then
[56:59] God came down and as the prophet put it
[57:02] in his words God Anointed The Faith he
[57:06] already had in him so faith is not
[57:09] something that all I've received this
[57:11] Faith or didn't know the faith is there
[57:13] but God comes to anoint what he's
[57:16] already put in you why you're a
[57:20] tabernacle of God God arranges all
[57:23] things that he can anoint the most holy
[57:25] God comes to anoint that place that he
[57:29] has reserved for himself
[57:30] oh blessed be the name of the Lord so
[57:33] that grip that we have noticed that grip
[57:35] on God because if it's just I grip alone
[57:37] remember brother Graham said oh he said
[57:40] I turned loose long ago but he has a
[57:42] hold of me how does he have a hold of us
[57:44] by Revelation that I've met God I know
[57:48] God I'm walking in step with God and
[57:51] there's a revelation that it's not our
[57:53] human strength because our human
[57:55] strength let's go but there's something
[57:57] that's greater than our Humanity
[57:59] something keeps holding me
[58:02] so then when we find brother Brandon I
[58:04] want you to see this because there's a
[58:06] walking with A continuous brother Brian
[58:08] we'll talk about Revelation as a
[58:10] continuous life-giving Source this
[58:12] revelation of Jesus Christ it's a
[58:15] continuous life-giving revelation
[58:19] oh that's why it's not a stagnant
[58:21] cistern it's this is the Fountain of
[58:23] Living Waters this is the fountain
[58:25] that's been opened in the House of David
[58:28] it's a it's a fountain that not only
[58:30] cleanses us but there's an ongoing
[58:32] cleansing an ongoing washing of Water by
[58:36] the word in our life and there are needs
[58:39] that continue to come in our life and
[58:42] there are things that you and I see in
[58:45] our life that are brought to light by
[58:48] God that we need that life-giving source
[58:51] to give us strength not only to identify
[58:54] but then to overcome it is that right so
[58:57] that's why we continue to walk on with
[58:59] God how many say Lord I want my faith
[59:01] increased I want my faith increased
[59:04] because Paul spoke about all the way
[59:06] through the book of Thessalonians when
[59:08] he would say that your faith would
[59:10] abound is it possible for a believer's
[59:12] faith to grow sure it is the prophet
[59:14] would even stand there after this
[59:16] message and preach on the wings of a
[59:18] snow white dove and he would speak about
[59:19] the visitation there of the of the seven
[59:22] angels and the Revelation that has come
[59:24] in this hour and brother Brandon would
[59:26] say that has led me to a faith I never
[59:30] had before notice led me to a faith I
[59:34] never had before it wasn't that brother
[59:36] random one born again but you see now
[59:38] that opens a channel once we are born
[59:41] again now we're in contact with God
[59:43] there's a grip on God a channel is open
[59:46] that now for everything that we face in
[59:49] this life God himself is the answer for
[59:53] every situation and through not just
[59:56] situations but through our life it's
[59:58] leading us into a faith that we never
[1:00:01] had before
[1:00:02] that's why we should be able to say this
[1:00:05] day this day I have a faith like I've
[1:00:08] never had before
[1:00:09] it's not about our feelings there's
[1:00:12] times earlier in our life in her
[1:00:14] Christian walk you felt more in control
[1:00:15] of things but you see God's God's not
[1:00:18] wanting you to stay in in the part where
[1:00:20] you feel or I feel more in control of
[1:00:22] things he's wanting to get us out here
[1:00:24] into a place to where it's not us our
[1:00:27] security is in I've got control over
[1:00:30] this situation God wants to bring us
[1:00:32] into deeper waters
[1:00:34] deeper waters to where it's not I that
[1:00:37] liveth it's not I that's in control
[1:00:39] and I know we and I say we we pray that
[1:00:42] way we say that but to understand that
[1:00:44] that's really where God is taking us to
[1:00:46] that's why the word keeps coming that's
[1:00:48] why the spirit of God moving Upon Our
[1:00:51] Hearts and drawing us what could take us
[1:00:53] deeper in him
[1:00:58] so when you can get that kind of nice
[1:01:00] talking to the sick people and I think
[1:01:01] that's important he says the sick people
[1:01:03] that's in the building
[1:01:05] the crippled or you have a need of God
[1:01:08] when you can get that type of a
[1:01:10] revelation that you are Justified when
[1:01:13] you're actually justified in asking the
[1:01:16] thing that you're asking for and believe
[1:01:18] it that he's a rewarder of those that
[1:01:20] diligently seek after him there's
[1:01:22] nothing can ever separate you from that
[1:01:25] Faith that's anchored to you but first
[1:01:27] it has to be revealed to you so a need
[1:01:30] has arose needs arise but we must be
[1:01:33] able to have such a Clarity between us
[1:01:35] and God
[1:01:37] now God it's never anything on God's
[1:01:40] part we can never say Lord you're doing
[1:01:42] this and Lord you went and done this and
[1:01:44] Lord you've done this and you've messed
[1:01:46] up the channel between us we can never
[1:01:47] say that but where Satan likes to come
[1:01:51] in he likes to try to break down that
[1:01:53] channel so that we're not able to stand
[1:01:56] justified in his presence now listen now
[1:01:59] I'm not talking about the justification
[1:02:02] that comes by faith and believing on the
[1:02:04] Lord Jesus Christ and where the spirit
[1:02:06] of God puts us in that position I'm
[1:02:08] talking about remaining in that kind of
[1:02:11] a position where there's nothing between
[1:02:13] you and God it'd be like if you had an
[1:02:15] argument with your wife there is
[1:02:16] something that's going to bother you
[1:02:18] until you make that right
[1:02:21] you can operate as a Channel of husband
[1:02:25] and wife like you ought to is that right
[1:02:27] so that's why you come to be able to
[1:02:30] stand or sit at your dinner table and
[1:02:32] eat your steak in a Justified state
[1:02:36] I know that's very very simple but this
[1:02:37] is the Simplicity of it that see that's
[1:02:40] the whole thing that's why the prophet
[1:02:41] could tell us over and over it is within
[1:02:43] you to overcome you do have power to
[1:02:46] overcome you have been anointed for this
[1:02:48] but what it is there's nothing wrong
[1:02:50] with the seed in you the seed in you
[1:02:52] does not need genetically modified it is
[1:02:56] the word of God as a son and daughter of
[1:02:58] God the only thing is needed is for you
[1:03:01] and I to get out of the way and stay out
[1:03:05] of the way
[1:03:08] that's a great battle
[1:03:10] I said that's the great battle you had
[1:03:12] no battles before
[1:03:15] God changed your life
[1:03:17] but once God comes into your life every
[1:03:19] gun I'm quoting the prophet every gun
[1:03:22] out of hell is trained on you
[1:03:26] everything anywhere he can lay snares
[1:03:28] trapped why are traps for to try to trip
[1:03:31] you up so you're not able to stand in
[1:03:33] that channel
[1:03:35] foreign
[1:03:38] let's just take the cover off the enemy
[1:03:41] it just takes it off
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:47] watch so it's getting in that that place
[1:03:49] and that channel
[1:03:50] for Sovereign for Faith because we need
[1:03:53] we need faith I want you to understand
[1:03:55] this we need faith for many situations
[1:03:59] there's times in my family
[1:04:01] for my own body and for my family where
[1:04:04] faith is dropped
[1:04:06] and directed me
[1:04:08] right there at that moment and it was
[1:04:10] miraculous
[1:04:12] then faith has also dropped same quality
[1:04:15] from the same God to go through a
[1:04:17] surgery
[1:04:19] to take the medicine
[1:04:21] but see even though some of us never set
[1:04:24] in denominational churches
[1:04:26] it shows you the reason denominational
[1:04:28] thinking and it's not just
[1:04:30] denominational thinking it's thinking of
[1:04:33] elevating self
[1:04:34] we want to act or think is dual if I had
[1:04:38] to take medicine if I had to do this
[1:04:40] this is a weakness of faith it is not a
[1:04:43] weakness of faith
[1:04:44] it takes faith in order to take that
[1:04:47] that's why the prophet could stand right
[1:04:49] in Erie Pennsylvania believe us now this
[1:04:51] and tell us that God performs Miracles
[1:04:55] through surgeries
[1:04:57] God performs Miracles through medicine
[1:05:01] is that right over and over we hear the
[1:05:03] prophet say this but somehow it somehow
[1:05:05] we allow the enemy somehow our and we
[1:05:08] allow that of self to get us into a
[1:05:10] place that in order to this to happen
[1:05:11] it's going to be faith and I'm just
[1:05:13] going to stand down claim it well
[1:05:14] there's a part of that that when we take
[1:05:16] the promise of God by his stripes I'm
[1:05:18] Healed I agree with that but if God has
[1:05:20] not revealed to me that this is gonna
[1:05:23] that it's a miracle in that part and
[1:05:25] God's not dropped that sign me up for
[1:05:27] the surgery
[1:05:30] I'm not a weakling I'm not a compromiser
[1:05:32] it's just knowing Who We Are
[1:05:36] I can show you many examples in the
[1:05:37] message where brother random even spoke
[1:05:39] Blasphemous names in the opening part of
[1:05:42] that message he's referring back to
[1:05:43] stature of a perfect man and he calls
[1:05:45] out a sister in the church sister Steffy
[1:05:47] he says If thy hat and prayed for you
[1:05:50] you wouldn't have made it through that
[1:05:51] surgery now quickness same God that
[1:05:53] brought her through the surgery have
[1:05:55] also intervened to where she didn't have
[1:05:57] to go through it
[1:05:58] he knows the way I take
[1:06:02] and the way that we want to take is not
[1:06:04] our own way
[1:06:06] it's God's way
[1:06:08] because every way that he leads will
[1:06:10] never lead us away from him it's leading
[1:06:12] us closer to him
[1:06:15] amen
[1:06:17] sometimes the paths and and everything
[1:06:19] but God knows what he's doing
[1:06:22] oh blessed be his name
[1:06:24] so here in this channel so I'm saying it
[1:06:26] in a manner that her brother it
[1:06:28] continues to bring this to put us into a
[1:06:30] channel where Faith itself is able to
[1:06:33] move down and to operate and he would
[1:06:36] say it like this uh in the high of her
[1:06:38] but now I see this is just another place
[1:06:40] in that message and brother REM said we
[1:06:42] don't use the gift of God for commercial
[1:06:43] now what brother Brown's referring to
[1:06:45] there is he had some brethren that we're
[1:06:48] talking about uh they wanted to go and
[1:06:51] they knew there were oil in Kentucky and
[1:06:53] brother Brahm let him know yes there is
[1:06:55] oil then they asked brother Branham tell
[1:06:58] us where it's at brother Brahm said oh
[1:06:59] no
[1:07:00] not going to do that
[1:07:02] he knew God had showed him it was there
[1:07:06] but they asked him tell us where it's at
[1:07:10] and see what Brother Brad I'm allowed he
[1:07:12] goes into this in this message one
[1:07:14] starts to come out among those ministers
[1:07:16] as they as they were getting this plot
[1:07:18] and this plot and you know we're going
[1:07:20] to do this to evangelize we're going to
[1:07:21] do that finally you realize the
[1:07:24] contentiousness
[1:07:26] that contentiousness come from it was
[1:07:28] there the whole time
[1:07:30] because the request was based on that
[1:07:34] are you hearing me that's why when
[1:07:36] someone could say I've been praying and
[1:07:38] God didn't heal me and I'm no longer
[1:07:39] going to serve him the basis that did
[1:07:41] not come overnight the basis of where
[1:07:46] you were living is what led you to that
[1:07:49] we're talking about the basis get down
[1:07:53] to the basis what's the reason
[1:07:57] right
[1:07:59] we don't use the gift of God for
[1:08:01] commercial no no he could tell me where
[1:08:03] it was at but I don't have any need of
[1:08:05] it I wouldn't even have faith enough to
[1:08:08] ask him
[1:08:09] if I have if I had need of it I believe
[1:08:12] if I'd ask him he'd tell me
[1:08:15] well brother Sammy I believe I'm going
[1:08:16] to ask God for a motorcycle I don't know
[1:08:19] who I you'd want one anyhow
[1:08:21] some people just trying to be kids again
[1:08:24] just ride your bicycle be happy
[1:08:27] I don't know where that come from it's
[1:08:28] free but you see sometimes to do well
[1:08:30] I'm just going to speak it for what
[1:08:31] reason
[1:08:33] whose glory is that for
[1:08:36] that's For Your Glory for your enjoyment
[1:08:39] and for you to have something you can
[1:08:41] point at I spoke that and it came into
[1:08:43] existence
[1:08:44] God will share his glory with no flesh
[1:08:50] even if it's the flesh that's housing a
[1:08:53] son and daughter of God God will share
[1:08:56] his glory with no flesh
[1:08:59] Our Father does not spoil us
[1:09:01] he leads us
[1:09:05] Glory
[1:09:06] mama
[1:09:09] 's packed in here
[1:09:10] if I need of it I believe I'd ask him
[1:09:12] he'd tell me if I had what need of it
[1:09:15] what what what is the ministry of the
[1:09:17] word the third pool what is it based on
[1:09:19] need Abraham had need of the realm is
[1:09:23] that right brother Branham had need of
[1:09:25] the squirrels ask what you have need of
[1:09:28] that's why the ministry of the opening
[1:09:30] of the word is not an educating of our
[1:09:33] mind god Jehovah Jireh has provided what
[1:09:36] we have need of
[1:09:38] it's him revealing himself among his
[1:09:41] children through his children in his
[1:09:43] children we have need
[1:09:46] and God has taken our lives where people
[1:09:48] could say no son and daughter could come
[1:09:49] out of there no squirrel could come out
[1:09:51] of that kind of stuff but God spoke by
[1:09:53] his word because why inside of that mess
[1:09:56] inside of that condition was the son and
[1:09:58] daughter of God and someone could say no
[1:10:00] squirrel could come out of there you
[1:10:01] remember what I'm talking about right
[1:10:02] when brother Graham stood in the woods
[1:10:04] he said I'm going to make it ridiculous
[1:10:05] I'll speak out of this right here
[1:10:07] because there's no way squirrels don't
[1:10:08] come out of there that took somebody to
[1:10:10] know of characteristics of a squirrel
[1:10:12] and let me tell you something God knows
[1:10:14] the characteristic of his sons and
[1:10:16] daughters all he needed was a yielded
[1:10:18] vessel in this hour to say Let There Be
[1:10:20] Sons and Daughters of God come forth
[1:10:24] responded to his voice
[1:10:28] brother Brandon said at first see your
[1:10:30] motives and objective has to be right
[1:10:32] this is the this is the basis for all
[1:10:34] things
[1:10:34] your motives and objectives has to be
[1:10:36] right
[1:10:37] it's just like the asking God lord
[1:10:40] I really want you to bless me with this
[1:10:42] job be careful what you ask God for
[1:10:44] because if you're asking God I have
[1:10:47] prayed for people I've prayed for
[1:10:48] individuals that have asked me to pray
[1:10:50] that God would provide a way they could
[1:10:52] be in the house of God
[1:10:54] that will come back to condemn you
[1:10:57] if you don't honor what God and what you
[1:11:01] said I'm doing this I want this job I
[1:11:04] want this and God turns around and is
[1:11:06] provided
[1:11:09] listen to me you see what that is not
[1:11:12] the faith of the individual that is the
[1:11:14] faith of God in operation
[1:11:16] just like brother Branham talked about
[1:11:18] that people that can have things taken
[1:11:21] off of their lives healing into the
[1:11:23] presence of the Angel and then it comes
[1:11:25] back in their life a few days later
[1:11:27] and he said the reason of that is
[1:11:29] because a lack of sincerity but yet in
[1:11:31] the prince of God it lifts it but then
[1:11:32] it'll come back why because down at the
[1:11:34] bottom it's not right
[1:11:36] when it's not right it will return why
[1:11:39] there's no strength to withstand it
[1:11:42] my my
[1:11:44] Lord's good indie
[1:11:46] oh my this is this is this is real
[1:11:48] victory
[1:11:49] see first of our motives and objectives
[1:11:51] has to be right you have to have reasons
[1:11:53] for this but I think we need to take
[1:11:55] this in an encouraging way because if
[1:11:57] you've got the right motives and
[1:11:58] objectives and if it's not say God let
[1:12:01] my motives and objectives match yours
[1:12:03] Lord
[1:12:05] transformation he says and then he talks
[1:12:08] to the brother Willard Collins about the
[1:12:10] will of God he says once I find it's
[1:12:12] God's will for me to for something to be
[1:12:14] done then he said I want to test my
[1:12:18] motives my objectives in it
[1:12:23] home you know you know what you know
[1:12:25] what I believe that is that's Sons and
[1:12:26] Daughters of God sometimes we're looking
[1:12:28] at Sons and Daughters God speak to this
[1:12:30] mountain no Sons and Daughters of God is
[1:12:31] being able to look down and see our own
[1:12:33] humanity and say you're not going to
[1:12:34] rule over me
[1:12:36] huh you're not doing this for your own
[1:12:38] Glory this is for the glory of God
[1:12:40] that's what Sons and Daughters of God is
[1:12:42] that's what the adoption is is being
[1:12:44] able to crawl our own selves to the word
[1:12:48] you're talking about speaking to a
[1:12:50] mountain there's something greater than
[1:12:51] a mountain and that's that mountain of
[1:12:53] that first birth that would still be
[1:12:55] there that has to rise up and say thou
[1:12:57] great Mountain who do you think you are
[1:13:00] before cerebral who's ceruvable one who
[1:13:04] has been touched by fire Thou shalt
[1:13:07] become a plane
[1:13:10] oh glory be to God you gotta have
[1:13:13] reasons to do this God don't just give
[1:13:15] you those things just because you ask
[1:13:17] and you cannot ask
[1:13:19] in faith unless there's a real objective
[1:13:22] to that to be in the will of God and if
[1:13:25] you want to be well
[1:13:27] what do you want to be well for
[1:13:30] all right well I want to be a better I
[1:13:31] want to be a better grandpa that I can
[1:13:33] run with my grandchildren that's good
[1:13:34] that's wonderful
[1:13:36] that's wonderful that's what I'm
[1:13:38] trusting
[1:13:39] I want to be able to run and play and
[1:13:41] wrestle and everything I think yes Lord
[1:13:42] I want to be well I want I want to be if
[1:13:44] God tarries and others I want to be able
[1:13:46] to stand be a or be a channel that God
[1:13:49] can use I you know there's risks there's
[1:13:50] reasons for healing but if my but if the
[1:13:52] purpose for Desiring healing is just so
[1:13:55] Lord you know I'm just not able to work
[1:13:57] like I used to Lord the kind of hours I
[1:13:59] used to work I just need healing in my
[1:14:02] body for what
[1:14:04] what purpose and glory is that for God
[1:14:08] that's not about God you see this is why
[1:14:11] the word comes to discern what's brother
[1:14:14] Sammy what's this all about being a
[1:14:15] Channel of faith
[1:14:18] that God can move down through our lives
[1:14:20] in needs God can influence through our
[1:14:23] lives God can direct through our lives
[1:14:25] it's not just needing God in the tough
[1:14:27] times God's not a welfare system
[1:14:29] what's falling on a hard time you need
[1:14:32] to fall on the rock
[1:14:34] and let the rock become your rock
[1:14:38] amen following that rock and say God I
[1:14:42] lay everything down lay my life down not
[1:14:44] just when it gets tough well I need
[1:14:46] somebody bigger you need somebody bigger
[1:14:48] when you feel good you need somebody
[1:14:50] bigger in all of your life you need God
[1:14:53] personally every day even when you feel
[1:14:56] like you're in control on top of the
[1:14:58] mountain that's when you're really near
[1:14:59] him
[1:15:01] that's when you really need him
[1:15:07] oh God mold that you say God so mold
[1:15:10] that in my heart in my life
[1:15:12] you can't ask it in faith unless there's
[1:15:14] a real objective to that to be in the
[1:15:15] will of God so if you want to be well
[1:15:17] what do you want to be well for if you
[1:15:19] want to be healed what's the reason you
[1:15:22] want to be healed
[1:15:23] what are you telling God what do you
[1:15:26] want to do with your life when you get
[1:15:27] healed he said
[1:15:29] see remember remember Simon the Sorcerer
[1:15:32] I put my glasses back on so I can see
[1:15:34] the targets
[1:15:37] you remember Simon the Sorcerer he asked
[1:15:39] for the Holy Ghost
[1:15:40] wonderful you say I wonder if somebody
[1:15:43] has overheard Simon the Sorcerer asking
[1:15:45] the disciples he said glory to God I
[1:15:46] tell you God's really dealing with
[1:15:48] brother Simon glory to God he's asking
[1:15:50] for the Holy Ghost
[1:15:53] and then become to realize what he's
[1:15:56] asking is he's asking to handle and use
[1:16:00] it in a selfish manner
[1:16:02] he didn't realize that the Holy Ghost is
[1:16:05] God's Life coming to you to lead you
[1:16:09] into the very depth of his life to
[1:16:12] transform you not to make you a better
[1:16:15] person
[1:16:19] and I hope you don't misunderstand me
[1:16:20] there's a lot of good books a lot of
[1:16:22] things self-help and things you can
[1:16:23] become a very good person God ain't
[1:16:25] interested in building on our first
[1:16:27] Foundation he's interested in building
[1:16:29] on his own Foundation
[1:16:31] God doesn't show up and say oh there's a
[1:16:33] basement here I think I'll build on it
[1:16:34] God said just try it I Lay My Own
[1:16:37] Foundation
[1:16:38] I build on my own foundation and what is
[1:16:41] that Foundation the revelation of Jesus
[1:16:43] Christ to you personally
[1:16:46] what is God doing he's building
[1:16:49] upon his word building upon himself and
[1:16:52] he builds a son and daughter of God in
[1:16:54] his own image
[1:16:58] that's why when we come coming for the
[1:17:01] Holy Ghost
[1:17:02] have the set have the have the breeze in
[1:17:04] and the purpose then Lord
[1:17:06] I want
[1:17:07] you more than anything
[1:17:10] I want my life it's not just coming to
[1:17:13] church
[1:17:14] God I want to know you in the power of
[1:17:16] your Resurrection I need you Lord of
[1:17:19] Victory that's in me sustains me guides
[1:17:22] me that even when I feel down there's
[1:17:24] something in me to pick me up
[1:17:27] it's a pick-me-up it's something that'll
[1:17:29] strengthen me even in my times of of
[1:17:31] weakness and my times of struggle there
[1:17:33] is an anchor there is that reality on
[1:17:35] the inside that God that you have done
[1:17:37] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ Lord
[1:17:40] I want to serve you
[1:17:43] that's why the Holy Ghost comes is to
[1:17:45] bring us into that channel
[1:17:48] to where we can serve him
[1:17:50] not by our own means our own way but by
[1:17:53] his grace
[1:17:55] and this is why brother bran would say
[1:17:57] and then he says he said he's got to be
[1:18:00] the right motive and objective and they
[1:18:02] have to be right according to the will
[1:18:04] of God let me just say like this I would
[1:18:06] not be too big when I look at these see
[1:18:09] these these things when I'm speaking
[1:18:10] like this and preaching this it could if
[1:18:13] you allow the devil it could put you
[1:18:14] back in a cave
[1:18:15] to where you have to look at it as
[1:18:17] though I've got to act like everything's
[1:18:19] all right or I've got a scene and I'm
[1:18:20] not telling you to make up anything I'm
[1:18:22] trying to say it like this if you're not
[1:18:24] there if you haven't received the Holy
[1:18:27] Ghost if you have need of healing or
[1:18:29] anything else or whatever it might be
[1:18:30] job situation I would say God line my
[1:18:34] motives and objectives Lord
[1:18:37] to where it matches your will because
[1:18:40] your will is what I want
[1:18:43] and I know I can't get to her but Lord
[1:18:45] You're the same God who's bringing me
[1:18:48] into a place Lord of healing this and I
[1:18:51] need you Lord all the way because
[1:18:53] remember though a man can baptize you in
[1:18:56] water but it is God himself that
[1:18:58] baptizes you into the Holy Ghost it's
[1:19:01] God working on your life I wouldn't be
[1:19:03] too big I would never be too big I don't
[1:19:06] I mean just say it like this I don't
[1:19:08] ever want to get too big to where when
[1:19:10] there is a promise that is before me God
[1:19:13] reconcile everything in me to be in
[1:19:17] harmony with you Lord
[1:19:18] [Music]
[1:19:20] not walk around and act like we got it
[1:19:22] all put together no God don't want that
[1:19:27] God one God is the one one who desires
[1:19:29] to put all things together
[1:19:33] sometimes you know it's wonder that we
[1:19:34] don't get and we don't get Grammys and
[1:19:36] invited to the Grammys for the movies
[1:19:38] and stuff like that actors it's amazing
[1:19:40] you know because I think sometimes we're
[1:19:42] better actors than the actors
[1:19:46] come on you see a god coming and just
[1:19:49] what what is the spirit of God doing not
[1:19:50] condemning us but he's trying to see
[1:19:52] show us see that part right there is
[1:19:54] what hinders but just come and stand on
[1:19:57] the side of the word and listen to the
[1:19:59] word handle that part of you I've
[1:20:00] already taken care of the root in your
[1:20:03] life I've already dealt with that nature
[1:20:05] now just keep on coming over and
[1:20:07] standing on the side of the word I will
[1:20:09] dismantle all every weapon that has ever
[1:20:12] been formed against you all the way down
[1:20:15] through time where this has happened in
[1:20:16] your family tree this has happened and
[1:20:18] this has happened and that's happened
[1:20:19] for spirits to travel on down but here
[1:20:22] is the great chief Master Mechanic of
[1:20:25] Glory he knows how to make a Son of God
[1:20:27] run like a Son of God and a God or God
[1:20:30] run like a daughter of God so instead of
[1:20:32] touching this wire to this wire to this
[1:20:34] wire just lean on him he's the one who
[1:20:36] built
[1:20:38] he's the one who built your life
[1:20:41] he knows all the complexities and
[1:20:43] everything we're wrapped in and he knows
[1:20:46] how to lead us out to Victory
[1:20:50] that's when the faith
[1:20:53] that's when the faith
[1:20:55] is revealed to you so see the one going
[1:20:58] The Walking with God
[1:21:00] whether you're walking into the baptism
[1:21:02] of the Holy Ghost walking in and when I
[1:21:05] say that walking in sometimes
[1:21:09] and I just want to speak as he's giving
[1:21:11] it to me sometimes that's terminology
[1:21:14] but don't ever think that it's your
[1:21:17] efforts or it's my efforts
[1:21:19] the walking is actually not us going
[1:21:21] somewhere else it's actually the same
[1:21:24] lamb same word going deeper
[1:21:29] it comes in to our mind then what does
[1:21:31] it do go to the holy place
[1:21:34] then it goes into the holiest of holies
[1:21:35] is that right for that of the atonement
[1:21:38] they had to they had to slay that of the
[1:21:41] bullet right and they took the blood in
[1:21:43] so you see it's not you and I like oh
[1:21:45] I'm walking in no it's God coming in
[1:21:48] it's the blood coming deeper deeper
[1:21:51] deeper until the full experience
[1:21:54] so it's actually gone what's God doing
[1:21:56] God's approaching his own Mercy Seat
[1:21:58] it's God approaching his word it's God
[1:22:01] who makes that word to live
[1:22:03] and God is saying that's where I will
[1:22:06] meet with thee that's that little room
[1:22:08] that's that secret place
[1:22:11] that's where the third pool operates
[1:22:13] from that's the word that's the presence
[1:22:15] of God I will commune with thee from
[1:22:18] above the mercy seats
[1:22:22] thens when the faith
[1:22:25] is revealed to you
[1:22:27] and God by his Sovereign Grace places
[1:22:30] that faith in there
[1:22:32] then it's over
[1:22:36] so
[1:22:38] let's say I'm walking into it for a
[1:22:40] promise
[1:22:41] let's use the promise of healing
[1:22:43] matter of fact let me back up let's say
[1:22:45] I'm using I'm taking the promise I
[1:22:47] realize as a son and daughter of God
[1:22:50] I've been robbed of my right
[1:22:52] Satan has robbed me
[1:22:54] I've got a right to the Holy Ghost it
[1:22:57] becomes so clear that it isn't anything
[1:23:00] I could Merit I can't make God like me I
[1:23:04] can't make God love me he's always loved
[1:23:07] me
[1:23:09] man and Calvary is only Russell as
[1:23:11] bringing a view that's what the mercies
[1:23:13] seek coming in view does it brings the
[1:23:16] reality of the love of God as Paul could
[1:23:18] write of it tried to in the Book of
[1:23:20] Romans under inspiration but how can you
[1:23:23] even conceal the love of God when he the
[1:23:27] righteous one when he died for the
[1:23:29] ungodly died for the unlovable you see
[1:23:32] there's nothing that you could do or I
[1:23:34] could do that justified us for him dying
[1:23:38] for us he didn't do it because we were
[1:23:40] where they
[1:23:41] [Applause]
[1:23:43] he did it because he loved us
[1:23:49] can't you see he didn't choose you
[1:23:51] because of the condition you were in but
[1:23:54] that's not his choosing his choosing is
[1:23:56] you were always one of his children and
[1:24:00] he came looking for you
[1:24:05] and he still comes down and looks for us
[1:24:08] and says hey has your job got between us
[1:24:12] hey has family got between us where are
[1:24:15] thou my son where I tell my daughter you
[1:24:18] aren't living in the proper Channel but
[1:24:19] God it's my husband's fault lord it's my
[1:24:22] wife's fault lord it's this body's fault
[1:24:24] he's telling you no no no it ain't
[1:24:27] nobody's fault I am come
[1:24:30] that you can walk and live
[1:24:32] in a Clear Channel
[1:24:34] because faith
[1:24:36] is to begin calling those things that
[1:24:38] are not
[1:24:39] as though they are
[1:24:43] you see when you're talking negative
[1:24:45] that's not faith
[1:24:47] you're prayed for and then you go back
[1:24:49] out and the same thing happened same
[1:24:50] thing comes up again and oh this come up
[1:24:52] again and so and so said this or they
[1:24:54] done this and and then you start down
[1:24:55] you see what's happening
[1:24:57] you know what's happening you're
[1:24:58] starting down a familiar pathway
[1:25:00] you've got to take a stand on God's word
[1:25:04] and stop letting the devil push you
[1:25:06] around when you prayed for it draw the
[1:25:09] line
[1:25:11] God's God has said this tell me when
[1:25:14] what time does God ever lied to you
[1:25:16] has he lied he's not a man that he
[1:25:18] should lie his words have been
[1:25:20] established from from here for the
[1:25:22] foundation of the world he sounds with
[1:25:25] the certainty
[1:25:27] so then it comes down to Lord
[1:25:30] what's the channel because sometimes it
[1:25:32] isn't even about this situation we're
[1:25:34] wanting to say well I get this situation
[1:25:36] I get this and God said this situation
[1:25:39] I'm permitting to show
[1:25:42] you and I'm trying to put both fingers
[1:25:44] both ways you know that you know what
[1:25:47] that you need to be more of a channel
[1:25:49] for me
[1:25:51] God knows why God knows how to lead us
[1:25:54] God knows how to bring us into these
[1:25:56] things
[1:25:58] what is this thought so I don't know who
[1:26:00] said this so I don't know who I'm
[1:26:01] quoting but when somebody said something
[1:26:03] they said if you the definition of
[1:26:05] insanity is to keep on doing the same
[1:26:07] thing the same old way and expecting
[1:26:08] different results that's insanity
[1:26:14] right
[1:26:15] doing it the same old way and
[1:26:17] it's almost like we're wanting God to
[1:26:19] equip us Lord make my will stronger no
[1:26:21] you don't want your will stronger that's
[1:26:22] the problem we need to not my will thine
[1:26:26] will not well Lord if you think if you
[1:26:28] think there's a few things in my will
[1:26:29] that are just not right that you
[1:26:30] couldn't use God said I don't want none
[1:26:31] of it
[1:26:33] I don't want none of it I don't need
[1:26:35] your help
[1:26:37] this situation is an opportunity for me
[1:26:42] to make myself known to you
[1:26:45] and to bring you in even in a latter
[1:26:48] point in your life to be more of a
[1:26:51] channel
[1:26:54] God's not the author of confusion
[1:26:57] it works with a purpose
[1:27:01] I didn't get anywhere where I was
[1:27:02] planning on tonight I thought I had just
[1:27:04] a little something here before me a
[1:27:06] little something that we get into some
[1:27:07] other
[1:27:08] God knows Tony
[1:27:10] but he's given us what he wanted and
[1:27:12] that's all I care about
[1:27:14] right you breach from that inspiration
[1:27:16] but notice when faith is revealed to you
[1:27:19] and God by his Sovereign Grace places
[1:27:21] that faith in there then it's over
[1:27:24] so come back to that place the promise
[1:27:26] of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:27] David said
[1:27:30] this is why even at times even as we
[1:27:32] come out of as I've come out at times of
[1:27:34] Youth Camps you see things where lives
[1:27:36] have been touched and
[1:27:38] you know sometimes there's situations
[1:27:39] you don't know whether it's there here
[1:27:41] wherever and you don't know exactly you
[1:27:44] know sometimes there's things it's
[1:27:45] really it's really confirmed and
[1:27:47] witnessed in your heart and then there's
[1:27:49] other times when you you you know that
[1:27:51] there are other lies that no doubt have
[1:27:52] have not come to that place but God has
[1:27:54] touched them
[1:27:55] and so what do you do well I'm not
[1:27:57] fearful because if God has made himself
[1:28:00] so known to draw them into a place of
[1:28:02] repentance and then there are things
[1:28:04] that has gone out of their life then
[1:28:06] it's like David I have set the lord
[1:28:09] always before me
[1:28:11] so he has been sent before us
[1:28:15] he is at my
[1:28:17] right hand
[1:28:18] I shall not be diverted from the promise
[1:28:22] he's strengthening me he's the one who's
[1:28:25] encouraging me saying it's for you it's
[1:28:27] for you
[1:28:29] understand what I'm saying it's God
[1:28:31] placing that direction in our lives
[1:28:34] that's the same thing then as a life
[1:28:36] will take that promise and brother Sammy
[1:28:38] I could read your quotes I don't have
[1:28:40] them here but I know him but brother
[1:28:41] Bram talks about you begin to confess it
[1:28:44] the Holy Ghost belongs to me
[1:28:46] you confess it you begin to take a hold
[1:28:49] of the promise of God that right
[1:28:52] then it's the same thing with healing
[1:28:54] same thing with healing then as I'm
[1:28:55] waiting see just as much as a person is
[1:28:57] waiting for that Faith to drop in that
[1:29:00] place they're walking on with God God
[1:29:01] listen that faith is not going to drop
[1:29:03] what if somebody comes up here and is
[1:29:04] prayed for and you're prayed for and
[1:29:07] then after you're prayed for you're
[1:29:08] going back and you start talking well
[1:29:09] you might as well make plans for me to
[1:29:11] get my casket and you might as well call
[1:29:13] up if you you only got the sniffles
[1:29:17] you understand friends I'm not talking
[1:29:19] about not making preparations but if we
[1:29:21] come up here and then we walk on we've
[1:29:23] not set the Lord before us
[1:29:25] we're going based on our emotions
[1:29:28] and you sense his presence and there is
[1:29:31] a response in his presence but remember
[1:29:33] his presence is here making himself
[1:29:35] known that the word might move into its
[1:29:38] rightful place because without the
[1:29:41] atmosphere the word's not going to move
[1:29:42] because the atmosphere the words what
[1:29:45] brings the atmosphere and the atmosphere
[1:29:47] is what brings life
[1:29:49] right it's not the hymn that Hatches the
[1:29:52] a gets the atmosphere
[1:29:55] that's why the preaching of the word it
[1:29:58] brings the atmosphere it brings the tent
[1:30:01] of the Lord his presence down that he
[1:30:05] can come and deal in the little room
[1:30:09] Hallelujah it brings an atmosphere it
[1:30:12] brings the presence of the Lord that's
[1:30:13] why I believe we believe in an
[1:30:16] atmosphere a real Supernatural
[1:30:18] atmosphere
[1:30:23] and I believe in a real atmosphere
[1:30:27] the brown said the supernatural I don't
[1:30:28] know we can take these in ruin their own
[1:30:30] but brother Bram talks about a real
[1:30:31] atmosphere he said you get the people in
[1:30:32] the court one Accord in their mind in
[1:30:34] their heart get the organ in the right
[1:30:35] cord he said then you're gonna have the
[1:30:37] atmosphere right
[1:30:39] that's not to knock on anybody on the
[1:30:40] organ but I'm just saying you get all of
[1:30:42] that together so you see brother random
[1:30:44] is not bless God you don't need a music
[1:30:46] that's the emotion who told you that
[1:30:49] sounds like some sounds like unbelief
[1:30:51] wanting to creep in it sounds like
[1:30:53] vultures that wants to come on the
[1:30:55] sacrifice but we shoo the vultures away
[1:30:58] don't tell me we don't need anointing
[1:31:00] don't tell me the Holy Ghost don't bring
[1:31:01] in motion I'm not saying that the Holy
[1:31:04] Ghost is in motion but don't tell me
[1:31:06] it's not
[1:31:07] and people can get happy at a ball game
[1:31:10] and then want to restrict the presence
[1:31:12] of God you need a trip back into the
[1:31:15] holiest of holies you need the joy of
[1:31:18] the Lord restore this word brings Power
[1:31:21] Glory and joy and it ought to bring a
[1:31:24] liberty among the people of God not a
[1:31:27] restriction of rules and regulations
[1:31:32] my goodness I didn't know that was
[1:31:34] packed in there
[1:31:38] but the message the supernatural
[1:31:41] powerful friends you see what's
[1:31:43] happening is men in their minds are
[1:31:45] trying to get in an engineer happenings
[1:31:48] God don't want man's reasoning in it
[1:31:52] it's God's church God knows how to run
[1:31:55] this church and he doesn't want quotes
[1:31:58] in hands to where it binds people but
[1:32:01] the anointing of the spirit of God it
[1:32:03] comes down to bring Liberation on the
[1:32:06] inside
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:09] Hallelujah
[1:32:12] I think I feel a little good
[1:32:16] but I know I gotta
[1:32:18] we'll just dial it back here
[1:32:20] let's just stop
[1:32:23] so I'm going to walk
[1:32:26] when I pray for
[1:32:30] the Bible said if any be any sick among
[1:32:32] you
[1:32:33] let them call for the Elders of the
[1:32:35] church
[1:32:36] anointing or oil
[1:32:39] and confessing their sins
[1:32:44] if there be anything this is the promise
[1:32:47] God will forgive it
[1:32:49] but it's got to come through the right
[1:32:51] channels
[1:32:52] are you hearing me he's got to come
[1:32:54] through the right channels that's why
[1:32:55] many things sometimes things stay
[1:32:57] because we're not coming in the right
[1:32:58] way we got to check out their objectives
[1:32:59] and our motives friends and we need to
[1:33:01] understand this we need to be looking I
[1:33:03] want you looking for God when you take a
[1:33:06] stand upon God's word you expect God
[1:33:08] expecting waiting for that Faith to drop
[1:33:12] see when you're in the channel as you're
[1:33:15] in the channel you're awaiting that
[1:33:17] faith that grip you've got on God you're
[1:33:20] waiting it to be confirmed what grip
[1:33:21] that I know I've met him
[1:33:24] this situation I don't know I don't know
[1:33:26] how the situation is going to be
[1:33:27] resolved but I've committed it into
[1:33:29] God's hands how do you know you're
[1:33:30] committed to God's hands because I
[1:33:31] committed myself into God's hands
[1:33:33] and it's committed into God's hand I
[1:33:35] don't know how I'm going to make this
[1:33:36] come I don't know how but you know what
[1:33:37] there's a faith faith you know what does
[1:33:38] something takes hold in your life and it
[1:33:41] all of a sudden it isn't something
[1:33:42] that's dropped and may be completely
[1:33:44] revealed but this is something that it's
[1:33:45] just like as you're siding with the word
[1:33:46] and something just raises up and you say
[1:33:48] I can't explain it I don't know but it's
[1:33:51] something it's just it's just what is it
[1:33:53] it's a peace of God it's bubbling up
[1:33:55] because what is it you're standing in
[1:33:57] that right Channel
[1:33:58] and it's like you're looking you know
[1:33:59] it's you're looking for somebody to come
[1:34:02] you know it's not like oh my goodness
[1:34:03] so-and-so's at our house quick raise up
[1:34:05] the carpet put everything underneath it
[1:34:07] no
[1:34:08] it's looking and
[1:34:11] I'm expecting
[1:34:13] him I'm expecting that Faith to drop for
[1:34:15] this right here and then until that time
[1:34:17] I'm going to be faithful and I'm going
[1:34:19] to walk step by step of the way I'm not
[1:34:21] going to turn around and say God didn't
[1:34:22] give me the Holy Ghost so I'm just you
[1:34:24] know I must not be one of his you didn't
[1:34:26] get that from God
[1:34:27] you got that from the Devil
[1:34:30] yeah you need to be listening to God you
[1:34:33] need to be listening to God's voice you
[1:34:35] need to fill your heart and mind with
[1:34:36] the things of God
[1:34:38] come on friends I just got to go as he's
[1:34:40] bringing it here quit going to the same
[1:34:43] old means if things don't turn out your
[1:34:45] way and don't go your way then you go
[1:34:48] back to the same old things in your life
[1:34:50] you know why because that's been your
[1:34:53] source of comfort but God said he would
[1:34:56] provide the comforter
[1:34:58] not a comforter but the comforter
[1:35:05] sometimes even in our lives with having
[1:35:08] the comforter sometimes we can go and go
[1:35:11] in measures and means of how we you know
[1:35:13] when something isn't going just right
[1:35:14] and we go in our own means our own ways
[1:35:17] of things and you know what listen
[1:35:19] I'm not here to take that out of you and
[1:35:20] you're not here to take those things out
[1:35:22] of me but within me within you greater
[1:35:25] is he that's within us and God's working
[1:35:27] and leading us into that place and that
[1:35:29] is not something that happens in a
[1:35:30] One-Shot deal after you've been born
[1:35:32] again now God is leading you out as a
[1:35:35] son and daughter of God and he's leading
[1:35:37] you from Glory into Glory from Victory
[1:35:39] unto Victory and sure there'll be there
[1:35:42] are a few failures sure there'll be a
[1:35:44] few mistakes sure there's things but
[1:35:45] it's important that you recognize them
[1:35:47] and say God not just this but take me to
[1:35:50] the root of why this is
[1:35:52] that's Sons and Daughters of God that's
[1:35:54] taking Dominion
[1:35:56] standing here Lord I want to I I I I
[1:35:59] want to speak to the Earth yeah me too
[1:36:01] right here
[1:36:02] this is the piece of the piece of Earth
[1:36:04] I want to speak to this is the Peace of
[1:36:07] Earth right now I know there's a lot
[1:36:08] more beautiful pieces of earth
[1:36:11] I'm talking about in this Earth but I
[1:36:14] have been given
[1:36:15] this is a possession
[1:36:17] and this old guy right here is the one
[1:36:19] that wants to get in the way
[1:36:22] don't you love him
[1:36:25] faith
[1:36:27] faith of the faithful
[1:36:29] the channel
[1:36:31] a channel that's opened that we can walk
[1:36:33] faithful before him even when we're
[1:36:35] waiting we're waiting on God to come
[1:36:38] down
[1:36:39] and for that Faith to drop but stand
[1:36:41] there like job I know what he's revealed
[1:36:44] to me
[1:36:45] there's nothing that's against me I know
[1:36:47] where I'm standing with God made wrongs
[1:36:49] right I know where I'm standing
[1:36:51] and that's how you're able to stand
[1:36:53] right and yet someone said well how's
[1:36:54] this going to come out I don't know but
[1:36:56] God's in control yes I'm certain God's
[1:36:58] gone I'm ready I know him I don't know
[1:37:01] how this is going to turn out I don't
[1:37:02] know because if I look by my if I let my
[1:37:04] mind go into it it looks bleak if it
[1:37:08] because you know why only thing that
[1:37:10] Humanity can produce
[1:37:12] because I told the young people over
[1:37:13] there I said I asked those that were
[1:37:15] math students I said how many are math
[1:37:17] students because I'm sure not a you know
[1:37:19] I said you know what for math
[1:37:22] I said you know what the square root of
[1:37:24] failure is
[1:37:25] human ability
[1:37:28] you take human ability plus human
[1:37:30] ability equals failure multiplying you
[1:37:33] know multiplying and sometimes we in our
[1:37:36] lives even as listen friends even in our
[1:37:38] journey as Christians and Believers
[1:37:39] God's still bringing us because there's
[1:37:41] certain outcomes in our lives that we
[1:37:44] still see failure
[1:37:46] but Lord I've been serving you this many
[1:37:47] years but sometimes human ability
[1:37:49] multiplied by human ability it results
[1:37:50] in failure and so God says wait let's
[1:37:52] get that down to the root let's let's
[1:37:54] let's deal with the root not that you
[1:37:56] need to be born again again because that
[1:37:58] has no such thing as that but what God
[1:37:59] comes in what's he doing he's dealing
[1:38:01] and molding and shaping our character
[1:38:03] and you now why is it what has happened
[1:38:05] maybe back in my life that causes this
[1:38:07] approach
[1:38:08] I'm telling you that's where the word
[1:38:11] and the opening of the word comes down
[1:38:13] to unveil and uncover Satan that's why
[1:38:16] the prophet said that which passes
[1:38:19] through Oral Roberts he said and Billy
[1:38:21] Graham all the rest of me said it makes
[1:38:22] it through their prayer lines and things
[1:38:24] he said then he said he comes to me he
[1:38:26] said why because it deals with what's
[1:38:28] hindering it thank God for a word to
[1:38:31] remove all hindrances aren't you
[1:38:33] grateful for that oh it uncovers us I
[1:38:35] say God uncover Me Lord
[1:38:38] if there's things Lord take every room
[1:38:40] every channel every room of my life I
[1:38:42] don't want any rooms that has a sign on
[1:38:44] it
[1:38:45] knocked before entering
[1:38:49] right
[1:38:51] we want to turn them all over to him
[1:38:54] and as he starts dealing with another
[1:38:56] room in our life I want to say Lord I
[1:38:58] don't have any Keys here but this this
[1:38:59] cough drops a key I want to be able to
[1:39:01] hand it to him and say Here's the key
[1:39:02] Lord
[1:39:03] going into that room of my life
[1:39:06] that part that's hidden going into it
[1:39:09] Lord
[1:39:09] what is it it takes the Son and Daughter
[1:39:11] of God to stand there with a real
[1:39:13] courage and turn the keys into his hands
[1:39:16] for what faith why am I I said I was
[1:39:19] closing
[1:39:21] it's close
[1:39:25] stand in that place God
[1:39:27] placing God before us
[1:39:30] no matter what the promise is no matter
[1:39:32] what the need
[1:39:33] let God be centered before you
[1:39:36] let everything else in between
[1:39:40] Let It Be remedy
[1:39:42] that our lives can be a channel
[1:39:45] as God every motive and every objective
[1:39:47] Lord let every one of my motives and my
[1:39:49] objectives
[1:39:50] be right
[1:39:53] it's just like somebody could have a
[1:39:55] motive and objective well I you know and
[1:39:57] I'm not saying anybody does here but let
[1:39:58] me just use an example that I know would
[1:40:00] burn in our hearts Lord I want to see
[1:40:01] every one of my my children saved and
[1:40:03] filled with the Holy Ghost why
[1:40:05] why
[1:40:08] what's the reason
[1:40:10] to what's the motive behind it
[1:40:13] it's Lord so that they might know you in
[1:40:16] a personal reality and a victory in
[1:40:18] their own lives
[1:40:19] not for my glory
[1:40:21] not for our family's Glory but For Your
[1:40:24] Glory
[1:40:26] you see what I'm saying sometimes
[1:40:28] there's things that we we do and what we
[1:40:30] do and what we're doing it's all about
[1:40:32] ourselves it's about putting ourselves
[1:40:34] up front
[1:40:36] and that's why brother bran talked to Dr
[1:40:37] Sam Adair and brother bran brings it out
[1:40:39] in the adoption I think you could just
[1:40:40] you could preach this a Month of Sundays
[1:40:42] and he told Brothers he told Dr Sam
[1:40:44] Madera remember Dr Sam Adair a good good
[1:40:46] man believer he told Dr Sam Adair he
[1:40:48] says look he said Sam he said you know
[1:40:50] one of the problems is you got too much
[1:40:52] up front
[1:40:54] now when I read that I read my name in
[1:40:56] there Sam you know one of the problems
[1:40:58] you got too much up front
[1:41:00] hey don't you let the word examine your
[1:41:02] life that way
[1:41:04] is too much up front
[1:41:06] see God knows how God knows how see if
[1:41:09] it's just man on man it causes to pull
[1:41:12] back
[1:41:13] but that's why we need his presence
[1:41:14] because even in the midst of what had
[1:41:17] taken place the presence of God will
[1:41:19] bring conviction but conviction is only
[1:41:21] there to bring to reality the wrong and
[1:41:24] the hindrance that has come and it will
[1:41:27] lead us back into a place of Fellowship
[1:41:30] that's what the word comes to do the
[1:41:32] word doesn't come to look to put you or
[1:41:34] me or anybody or you're a bad bad person
[1:41:36] and this and that's not what the word
[1:41:37] comes to do the word is not a word that
[1:41:40] isolates you
[1:41:43] are you hearing me because even while
[1:41:46] the words being preached if you allow
[1:41:48] the enemy to interpret it in your mind
[1:41:50] you it you can allow him to isolate you
[1:41:53] what should you do you should stay in
[1:41:56] the stream of water and stay with the
[1:41:59] water
[1:42:00] because eventually the hounds of Hell
[1:42:03] lose your time lose your tracks
[1:42:05] stay with the water
[1:42:08] all of my thoughts I give them to God
[1:42:10] cast down everything that he would be
[1:42:13] the preeminent one in all things
[1:42:15] it's a beautiful thing Faith that's a
[1:42:18] beautiful thing to say God all you
[1:42:20] desire is for my life just to be a
[1:42:22] channel
[1:42:22] and he provides a way aren't you glad
[1:42:25] he provides a way he doesn't let you
[1:42:27] know it isn't God that's handed this to
[1:42:29] you and I sometimes I've had instruction
[1:42:31] manuals it's come
[1:42:34] and sometimes with things and I you know
[1:42:36] I know as men men are prone to this I
[1:42:38] say men because men are aren't prone to
[1:42:40] they get the instructions out there
[1:42:43] that boat looks longer here and this one
[1:42:45] looks longer there and this
[1:42:49] sometimes the instruction I've had
[1:42:50] instructions where there were things
[1:42:51] that when I started looking on it
[1:42:53] because it was written by man
[1:42:55] that there's things missing and it
[1:42:56] starts popping up you start reading
[1:42:58] reviews on things and you're like what
[1:43:00] do you go from here
[1:43:01] where do you go you know
[1:43:04] and you start looking at it and then
[1:43:05] find out
[1:43:07] somebody over in another country
[1:43:09] somewhere I don't have to say where they
[1:43:11] forgot to put it on there
[1:43:16] and they're coming to come to know it
[1:43:17] ain't just me saying oh they forgot that
[1:43:18] no no I looked it up because I thought
[1:43:20] is it me you keep reading it over
[1:43:21] reading over reading it over reading
[1:43:22] over sometimes it's the instructions
[1:43:26] you know God has given us
[1:43:28] such Clarity of instructions
[1:43:32] and we can have that that channel of
[1:43:33] faith not to be complex but it's this
[1:43:36] right here let us live our lives in such
[1:43:38] a way that he's able to come down at any
[1:43:41] time and speak to us
[1:43:44] whatever the need might be
[1:43:46] let us live in such a place that faith
[1:43:49] can drop
[1:43:51] because one of these moments
[1:43:53] one of these moments
[1:43:55] it's going to drop
[1:43:57] and our bodies are going to be changed
[1:44:02] that's why we want to be living in that
[1:44:04] channel
[1:44:04] that channel of faith
[1:44:08] you love him
[1:44:11] Hallelujah God bless you
[1:44:14] as your Sparrow heads in order to prayer
[1:44:15] Heavenly Father
[1:44:18] Lord You're so mindful
[1:44:20] of our needs Lord
[1:44:22] I don't I don't know Lord of all the
[1:44:25] needs that would be present the that
[1:44:27] which is even request that's on the
[1:44:29] hearts of your children
[1:44:30] I know my own Lord
[1:44:32] request on my heart and I know they have
[1:44:34] requests to I know there's needs that
[1:44:37] Lord are before us
[1:44:39] God needs of healing Lord in that of the
[1:44:43] Soul needs of healing in the spirit Lord
[1:44:46] some lives and hearts Lords some Lord
[1:44:49] the healing that's needed is there in
[1:44:51] the spirit from things that Lord back
[1:44:53] that's carried forward but I'm glad oh
[1:44:57] I'm so thankful that Lord you have arose
[1:45:00] the son of righteousness with healing in
[1:45:03] your wings that God you're not only here
[1:45:06] to bring healing in our soul but you're
[1:45:09] a God who moves to bring healing in our
[1:45:12] spirit Realm where we've been wounded
[1:45:14] Lord
[1:45:15] father even when you stood there
[1:45:18] failed in that of humanity
[1:45:21] oh god of that body of Flesh
[1:45:23] known as the son of God
[1:45:25] you would announce and Proclaim I am
[1:45:28] come
[1:45:30] to heal them that are bruised
[1:45:34] Lord Jesus you are faithful Lord
[1:45:37] God your faithful also in healing of our
[1:45:40] bodies
[1:45:42] Lord one thing's for sure the greatest
[1:45:45] healing that anyone needs is that
[1:45:48] healing of our soul
[1:45:50] and God that we might continue
[1:45:53] to walk as channels may we lord is
[1:45:56] looking to you
[1:45:57] God
[1:45:59] not allowing hindrances
[1:46:02] God the things that just as you bring to
[1:46:05] our attention
[1:46:06] I don't want Lord just to be my eyes
[1:46:09] alone
[1:46:10] I want it to be
[1:46:12] your eyes
[1:46:14] what you say
[1:46:15] I want it to be the things that you see
[1:46:17] in me the things that you see and say
[1:46:20] again we need to deal with that I want
[1:46:23] to move through those eyes Lord not my
[1:46:25] own eyes
[1:46:26] Lord we've lived long enough
[1:46:28] in those in those areas
[1:46:31] and now when the intelligence of the
[1:46:33] mind of Christ is moved down Among Us
[1:46:35] Lord
[1:46:36] anointed Lord to be able to see in this
[1:46:38] hour and God may we lord we're not
[1:46:41] looking outwardly but Lord we want the
[1:46:44] word looking inwardly
[1:46:47] God is Sons and Daughters of God help us
[1:46:49] Lord I pray
[1:46:51] that we might walk as channels
[1:46:54] the god that that sovereignty of faith
[1:46:57] can drop at any moment no matter what
[1:47:00] that need is
[1:47:01] we ask it Lord that those that are
[1:47:03] seeking for the Holy Ghost granted Lord
[1:47:05] may they set their hearts Lord hear
[1:47:08] those streaming and so forth may they
[1:47:10] set their hearts Lord in that place with
[1:47:13] you oh God under the leadership of your
[1:47:15] work is we can't make ourselves Worthy
[1:47:18] oh Lord I'm so glad that you have made
[1:47:21] that so real to us it's not us that we
[1:47:24] we can never make ourselves good enough
[1:47:27] you showed that when Lord Adam and Eve
[1:47:29] stepped out they had fig leaves on
[1:47:32] that wasn't good enough
[1:47:34] you provided the skins of an innocent
[1:47:38] one
[1:47:39] God you provided that we could stand in
[1:47:42] your presence you've provided Lord
[1:47:45] that God the way that we can be one with
[1:47:48] you may they set that before you may
[1:47:51] they let that strength strengthen them
[1:47:55] and I pray God the same when it comes to
[1:47:58] Healing comes Lord to overcoming or
[1:48:01] maybe a besetting sin it'd be a weight
[1:48:04] that's laying in a life Lord
[1:48:07] you're the same God may we just Lord
[1:48:09] just even in that moment
[1:48:11] just Lord placing in a place a Channel
[1:48:14] of Faith where all hindrances Lord are
[1:48:17] removed Lord sin is confessed it's under
[1:48:19] the blood and our hearts Lord are a
[1:48:22] channel that's available for you granted

[1:48:43] speaks to our hearts
[1:48:44] faith of the faithful
[1:48:48] what is it that brings about the
[1:48:51] faithfulness in our life
[1:48:52] because of him
[1:48:54] because of him
[1:48:57] not not I it's him
[1:49:00] and that's our resource what's your
[1:49:03] secret
[1:49:04] Samson what's your secret
[1:49:09] to the little lady and
[1:49:11] was it first Peter 3
[1:49:13] it talks about the characteristic all
[1:49:16] those verses and I think it's first
[1:49:18] Peter three all those verses it speaks
[1:49:20] of the harmony
[1:49:23] between a husband and wife and it brings
[1:49:25] that place
[1:49:27] to that and the wife
[1:49:29] and I'm talking bringing this into the
[1:49:31] spiritual place
[1:49:34] adorned with a meekness
[1:49:36] what does meekness give place
[1:49:39] just just give place to the word
[1:49:42] give place to the Holy Spirit
[1:49:45] and what is it within the heart the
[1:49:47] hidden man
[1:49:49] of the heart
[1:49:51] he's not just my savior
[1:49:54] he's the Lord
[1:49:55] of my life
[1:49:58] there might be some rooms that
[1:50:00] you can look at and say
[1:50:03] I want him to come more fully into this
[1:50:05] room of my life
[1:50:07] more fully into this room
[1:50:10] and you know he'll come into that room
[1:50:12] maybe you've got pictures in that room
[1:50:14] different things maybe it's your
[1:50:16] pictures are ideas
[1:50:18] my family's always done it like this and
[1:50:20] God wants to come in and say we need to
[1:50:23] take that down
[1:50:24] we need to take that down and take that
[1:50:27] down and but but but Lord I
[1:50:30] but see son see daughter if you leave
[1:50:32] them pictures up it becomes a snare to
