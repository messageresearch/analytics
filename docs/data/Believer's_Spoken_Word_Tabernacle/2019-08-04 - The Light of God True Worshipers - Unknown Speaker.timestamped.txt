[23:46] hand of mercy of God and Lord we just
[23:49] love you Lord Jesus granite Lord we pray
[23:53] be with us this morning now Lord in the
[23:58] name of Jesus Christ god bless you as we
[24:04] want to go into the word here this
[24:06] morning John chapter 4 I'd like to start
[24:10] with here and just want to reiterate the
[24:15] announcement that they made here we had
[24:17] to change the midweek service we changed
[24:20] we had prayer meeting already scheduled
[24:22] for Tuesday but we went ahead and moved
[24:24] to Thursday into Tuesday so we'll have a
[24:27] midweek service at 7:00 on Tuesday this
[24:30] week brother Brian already announced
[24:32] that here so third that will not have a
[24:35] service here on Thursday and if I have
[24:37] to do that again even in the future I'll
[24:41] make sure I let because I know some of
[24:42] you get your work schedule set around
[24:44] that and we'll try to get that out to
[24:46] you one of the things that's very
[24:48] difficult at times to
[24:51] try to get someone in even on a Thursday
[24:53] night in the midweek for them driving so
[24:57] that was posted we posted it I don't
[24:59] think it's been sent out yet by the
[25:00] email but we had already forwarded it so
[25:04] it's on the bulletin board as well
[25:06] everybody got that
[25:08] Tuesday night we're gonna have the have
[25:11] midweek service on Tuesday night at 7
[25:13] o'clock here so also remember brother
[25:17] Carlos and prayer the Lord has certainly
[25:19] been very good been very mindful of our
[25:22] brother and just just brought him right
[25:25] through that and he's just had a little
[25:27] bit of soreness and different things
[25:29] right now so let's just let's keep him
[25:31] in prayer the Lord will just just
[25:34] continue to strengthen him
[25:37] so let's look here in John chapter 4
[25:41] verse 19
[25:47] and then once we want to rehear just a
[25:49] few scriptures
[25:51] beginning in verse 19 the woman saith
[25:57] unto him sir I perceived that thou art a
[26:02] prophet our fathers worshiped in this
[26:06] mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is
[26:10] the place where men ought to worship
[26:14] jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[26:18] hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[26:23] this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[26:26] worship the father ye worship you know
[26:30] not what we know what we worship for
[26:34] salvation is of the Jews but the hour
[26:38] cometh and now is when the true
[26:41] worshipers shall worship the father in
[26:45] spirit and in truth for the father
[26:49] seeketh such to worship Him amen now I
[26:56] want you to think of this here just for
[26:58] a moment let me just pause with you here
[27:00] just a moment discus there's little
[27:02] drops here
[27:03] notice what he says in verse 23 the hour
[27:06] cometh and now is when the true
[27:08] worshipers shall worship the father in
[27:10] spirit and in truth for the father
[27:13] seeketh such to worship Him this is God
[27:19] dwelling with his creation in his
[27:23] creation
[27:27] and that God dwelling in the man is
[27:32] perfect worship
[27:36] but in perfect worship the Lord Jesus
[27:40] the Bible says he went to church it says
[27:46] as was his custom
[27:53] so the person says well we are the
[27:58] church we are the tavern of God I agree
[28:03] with that but the Tabernacles of God
[28:06] will assemble themselves with the Saints
[28:09] of God amen
[28:13] verse 24 God is a spirit and they that
[28:19] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[28:24] and in truth not just with spirit not
[28:29] with not good enough in the woman said
[28:35] unto him I know that Messiah cometh
[28:40] which is called Christ there was no
[28:45] question with her I know Messiah is
[28:50] coming which is called Christ
[28:54] when he is come he will tell us all
[28:59] things Jesus said unto her I that speak
[29:04] unto thee am he Amen god bless you bless
[29:11] the reading of the word as you're being
[29:13] seated I want to just look here just a
[29:17] few moments here in the scriptures and
[29:21] to look at the thought on the light of
[29:25] God and true worshipers I I find this to
[29:32] be when we look at it here in the
[29:34] scriptures
[29:36] Jesus is identifying because the
[29:39] question that she's asking where should
[29:42] we worship she's you know she's asking
[29:45] do we you know our fathers say here in
[29:49] Samaria and here you know here as the
[29:52] Jews they say in Jerusalem and Jesus is
[29:54] letting her know there is a transition
[29:57] that is coming to where that that that
[30:02] not only is coming but is present
[30:04] because he is the representation of this
[30:08] true rep of this true worship and that
[30:10] is that it's not just going to be going
[30:14] yep to Jerusalem every so often for a
[30:18] feast to worship but it will but it is
[30:21] coming to a place to where that within
[30:24] this that Wars think of this you know
[30:27] there were many and you know this if you
[30:30] don't know it as a Bible reader I'll
[30:32] just touch on it a moment but just to
[30:34] refer for all of us there were many who
[30:37] would go up to Jerusalem even and they
[30:39] would go in different feasts and they
[30:41] would go in different times but if
[30:43] you'll notice that even many times when
[30:45] they were going the Book of Isaiah the
[30:47] Lord spoke through Isaiah and Isaiah 1
[30:50] and he even let them know that your
[30:52] offerings your sacrifice they have
[30:55] become a stench in my nostrils and he
[30:59] Godin and does not call them his feast
[31:01] at that time even though they are the
[31:03] Feast of the Lord but he says your feast
[31:07] because they don't resemble the
[31:09] character of the one who gave them
[31:13] because the feast were not just things
[31:14] to just to be done but there was an
[31:17] expression even though the worshiper
[31:20] they were worshipping those who were
[31:22] truly entering into those fees were
[31:24] worshipping by divine revelation by life
[31:27] that was given in that time where they
[31:30] would offer up the lamb and in each one
[31:32] of the of the seasons you know from the
[31:34] barley sheaf to the wheat sheaf and on
[31:36] and on and all of that was where they
[31:39] were moved in obedience and there was
[31:41] light that was given to them that they
[31:44] would come and they would offer that up
[31:46] but here the Lord Jesus is is letting it
[31:50] be known that you know even as we look
[31:53] at worship itself many people today let
[31:56] me just take a step back many people
[31:58] today with you had talked to him on
[32:00] today they will say well I'm going to
[32:02] worship today and they go to church and
[32:06] they're so you know you you you know
[32:07] somewhere there's some sort of a
[32:09] affiliation you know or maybe there were
[32:11] some that you know saying well we went
[32:13] to worship yesterday or whatever more
[32:15] but you see where where it has come to
[32:17] where that people look at worship as
[32:20] just going to church and we we
[32:23] understand that this worship in itself
[32:26] is much deeper than just coming to
[32:28] church because you can come to church
[32:31] and not be a worshiper you can come here
[32:34] and not worship God whatsoever because
[32:37] to worship God listen you we worship
[32:41] according to the revelation of who he is
[32:45] and who he is revealing himself to us
[32:49] personally and you can only walk by the
[32:54] revelation that God has revealed to you
[32:57] so you never want to try to be like
[33:00] somebody else you simply want to walk
[33:03] with that which God is making known to
[33:07] you and as you walk in that God will
[33:10] open more to you
[33:13] you see when we we look at it that see
[33:16] that worship itself it was made to be of
[33:20] an expression we find in the beginning
[33:22] you find you find two that came in the
[33:25] process of time the Bible tells us you
[33:27] find Abel you find Cain both of them had
[33:30] a sacrifice and both of them came to
[33:32] worship but as they came to worship what
[33:37] was the difference is there was a
[33:39] difference in their offering one was
[33:42] offering by the works of his hands and
[33:45] it was beautiful
[33:46] they he didn't offer spotted fruit this
[33:50] was not rotten fruit where flies were
[33:53] blowing around it this was beautiful he
[33:55] picked out the best you see it's the
[33:57] works of his own hands but to understand
[34:01] that it is man in himself cannot save
[34:04] himself the scripture is very clear
[34:08] salvation is of the Lord and here we
[34:13] find Abel coming and Abel's coming with
[34:16] a lamb notice this this revelation drops
[34:19] to Abel you you can't explain this did
[34:23] Abel figure this out it was not able
[34:25] mind that he was bringing what Abel had
[34:29] received is a revelation from his
[34:33] Heavenly Father that it was blood that
[34:36] took them out it'll be blood to bring
[34:39] them back in and here God showed Abel
[34:42] what the appropriate offering is I want
[34:44] you to think of this now there were many
[34:47] many many other animals he could have
[34:50] offered up I hope you see what I'm
[34:55] saying now because you you recognize he
[34:58] offers a lamb and there's no way that
[35:01] you can explain this but Abel is there
[35:05] and he has being a child of God God is
[35:08] obligated to reveal himself to his
[35:12] children because without that Abel would
[35:15] have continued to stumble in the
[35:17] darkness of his daddy and mommy's
[35:20] teaching that it was fruit that took you
[35:22] out but you see now God comes on the
[35:26] come on God has an obligation that runs
[35:30] far deeper than what had him and Eve did
[35:33] they were doing their best or what we
[35:35] could say his parents and they were
[35:36] trying to cover things around but you
[35:39] see God had an obligation that went so
[35:42] much farther because Abel belonged to
[35:46] God and I say it like this
[35:50] there's no way when God has got ahold of
[35:53] your life when God fills you with the
[35:55] Holy Ghost
[35:56] when this word becomes write to you
[35:59] truth to you
[36:01] eagle food when you step back to it and
[36:03] even consider where you are and why
[36:06] you're here it is not something you can
[36:09] explain it is a mystery but let me tell
[36:13] you what that mystery is it is God's
[36:17] obligation to you and I as his children
[36:21] by being a part of his word we were not
[36:24] searching for him he came seeking for us
[36:28] we could not make a way but he became
[36:32] the way this is the worship that Jesus
[36:38] is introducing that how God is desire to
[36:42] come and dwell inside of man like he was
[36:47] back in the beginning in the Garden of
[36:49] Eden here here in in the setting as we
[36:52] look at it if we can move just a moment
[36:55] to Luke chapter 4 verse 17 here Jesus is
[36:59] standing here in the temple in Luke 4:17
[37:02] and there was delivered unto Him the
[37:05] book of the prophet Isaiah and when he
[37:08] had opened the book he found the place
[37:10] where it was written let me just say it
[37:12] to you like this I do not beg the Bible
[37:15] does not record it but I do not believe
[37:17] that Jesus is the one who stood up and
[37:19] said let me have that scroll you see
[37:23] everything is divinely arranged by God
[37:29] they might have had the scripture
[37:31] reading picked out with Forrest with
[37:33] Isaiah we're going to read out of Isaiah
[37:35] and you know what God allowed that
[37:38] God sometimes will allow your plans and
[37:42] allow you to come into a place where you
[37:44] think it's your plans but God said nope
[37:47] this is just where I had ordained to
[37:51] meet you see Mary had her plans to wash
[37:56] that day she had her plans to go get
[37:58] water with the angel the Lord knew the
[38:00] route she was about her every day
[38:05] activities
[38:07] sounds like the rapture doughnut she was
[38:10] about her everyday activities and right
[38:14] there here the Gabriel appears to her
[38:17] and begins to speak to her see God comes
[38:20] and as brother man tells us God comes in
[38:23] unusual ways in unexpected times but he
[38:26] always comes so here when he had opened
[38:30] the book he found the place where it was
[38:32] written the Spirit of the Lord is upon
[38:34] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[38:37] the gospel to the poor he hath sent me
[38:40] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[38:42] deliverance to the captives and
[38:44] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[38:47] at liberty them that are bruised to
[38:50] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[38:53] now you know when I begin to look at
[38:56] this this scripture and how that it just
[38:58] just so dropped in my heart with some
[39:00] things we were already looking at that
[39:02] the scripture noticed in the previous
[39:04] verse it says one of the manifestations
[39:08] of this will be the recovering of sight
[39:11] to the blind now we know when we read
[39:14] the scriptures when the Lord Jesus was
[39:16] here upon earth there were many who were
[39:19] blind that were healed
[39:21] there were even those who did not even
[39:22] have eyes in their eye sockets and he
[39:25] spat on the ground he put he brought
[39:28] forth of that and put it upon the eyes
[39:30] and said go wash so there was much that
[39:33] within the time of his ministry that
[39:35] there was a lot of healing in the
[39:37] natural now let me just say it like this
[39:39] I got on the study yesterday and my just
[39:42] loved to preach it this morning but I'm
[39:43] not going to but but if you look at it
[39:46] brother bad I'm just you know dealing
[39:47] with the fault if you touching in on
[39:49] your
[39:50] Kable app go blind and you begin to read
[39:52] those statements on going blind you use
[39:54] catch the Spirit of God beginning to
[39:56] deal with people who are going blind
[39:58] matter of fact one case multiple cases
[40:00] actually where the Spirit of God picks
[40:02] up that you're losing your sight because
[40:04] of a demon called diabetes and diabetes
[40:07] has wanted to take your sight in one
[40:09] case brother BAM stands up and he says
[40:11] now what it is he says the Lord healed
[40:14] you about diabetes before but he says
[40:16] now that diabetes has come back to want
[40:18] to try to take your eyesight he said but
[40:21] I cursed that devil in the name of the
[40:24] Lord Jesus Christ you are not going to
[40:26] go blind demon then he picks it up you
[40:31] know where your eyes the flattened
[40:33] cataracts have come about aids but you
[40:35] know one thing about it it did not
[40:37] matter if there was a disease it did not
[40:40] matter if there was no macular
[40:42] degeneration and then no matter the
[40:44] Spirit of God addressed every bit of
[40:46] that with the eyes that there was
[40:49] nothing can stand in the presence of God
[40:51] you know why because in this hour this
[40:54] is an hour were they I serve of God
[40:57] speaking in the spiritual would come
[40:59] upon the sons and daughters of God to
[41:02] where where we had been blinded by
[41:04] traditions or where there was only so
[41:06] much life that we could see it was at
[41:09] God's desire that full life would come
[41:12] within this hour that's his promise now
[41:16] do you think about this even when you
[41:18] look at the prophets the prophets
[41:20] themselves were reflectors they were
[41:22] likes they were reflectors they were
[41:24] only reflecting that true light that was
[41:27] to come God would take a hold of their
[41:30] lives
[41:30] look how God would take a hold of the
[41:32] prophets life God would so overcome
[41:35] their lives to where it would actually
[41:37] be a divine expression that would come
[41:39] through their lives not just he would
[41:41] even so move through their lives like
[41:43] Elijah wouldn't lay his body upon the
[41:46] body of that child because God had took
[41:49] over his body and that child would be
[41:52] raised back to life again what an
[41:54] announcement of the Holy Ghost to take
[41:56] over the body of Jesus Christ prophets
[41:59] were reflectors there was glimpses of
[42:02] light there was someone
[42:03] in this profit some within this profit
[42:06] the light that they were given remember
[42:08] the light that they were given was not a
[42:10] light that they themselves were born
[42:12] with but they were they were a part of
[42:15] God and God would speak to their hearts
[42:17] draw them and remember what they would
[42:20] speak now listen to me now what they
[42:22] would speak would actually be light and
[42:25] remember they would be tried how do how
[42:27] was the light that they spoke how was it
[42:30] trying it was tried by the Urim and
[42:32] Thummim if what they spoke did not light
[42:36] up the word that was already given then
[42:40] if it did not do that there was no light
[42:43] in them so the proof of light being in
[42:48] them would be that it would dovetail
[42:51] with the word now to think of their the
[42:53] fall that came about in the beginning
[42:55] you know where Adam and Eve would walk
[42:57] in the cool of the day and you know this
[43:00] reality in Genesis one of what God in
[43:04] the beginning he made man a spirit man
[43:06] not a flesh man that was the God put him
[43:09] in flesh there later but he first made
[43:12] him a spirit man after the image and the
[43:14] likeness of Almighty God and as we read
[43:17] the past couple of weeks he gave that
[43:19] man dominion he gave him dominion over
[43:22] all all that was beneath him he gave him
[43:25] dominion over that of the cria over that
[43:28] of the creation and here God has
[43:30] entrusted that in with man and his wife
[43:33] and then to find that you know within it
[43:36] when the fall itself come we we
[43:38] understand how that the enemy he came to
[43:41] Eve and he begin to present to Eve in
[43:44] Genesis 3 the serpent a more subtle
[43:47] beast than any other beast of the field
[43:49] and so we find here he begins to present
[43:52] what would be known like as light you
[43:56] know God's keeping something from you
[43:58] and he presents light but the light that
[44:01] he presented was not actually light it
[44:04] was darkness but it had the appearance
[44:08] of light but it wasn't it was darkness
[44:11] it brought about the fall and it
[44:14] actually removed
[44:15] man from actually living in the
[44:18] authority as the son and daughter of God
[44:20] from that point on but the Lord but here
[44:23] Almighty God said I will make a way back
[44:27] and brother bran would tell us like this
[44:29] sin blinded every fiber in his body in
[44:33] his mind in his heart but I'm glad that
[44:36] God knows how to remove the blindness
[44:38] aren't you he knows how to remove the
[44:41] blindness and he don't remove the
[44:42] blindness just with teaching he doesn't
[44:44] remove it just by word but he removes
[44:46] blindness by divine expression of light
[44:49] himself now watch this when we look at
[44:52] this because darkness you know when you
[44:54] think about it darkness itself and we
[44:57] look at blindness blindness is actually
[44:59] the lack of light perception there's
[45:03] many different degrees where you know
[45:05] people can be considered legally blind
[45:08] but there's certain things that they can
[45:10] have certain restrictions there's
[45:11] certain measures that they can see in
[45:13] certain things that they can but we
[45:15] recognize that that this this blindness
[45:17] that struck Humanity this blindness that
[45:21] here where man was intended to be a
[45:24] ruler he was intended to have dominion
[45:27] he was intended to have authority but
[45:30] now living in in there in the realm of
[45:33] perfect love there was no fear there
[45:35] there was no doubt there there was no
[45:39] unbelief there so to see where man was
[45:43] now now here it comes to a place that
[45:46] God's desire is to remove that blindness
[45:50] that is falling upon man you know if you
[45:52] stay in the dark long enough you go
[45:54] blind you realize that if you're in
[45:57] total darkness long enough you can go
[45:59] blind
[46:01] and to think about it you know when we
[46:03] looked at it with blindness here there
[46:06] was already the su in was shyness there
[46:09] in that natural sunlight that God's
[46:10] given us a beautiful day today that Sun
[46:13] was still shining that Sun was still
[46:15] declaring itself now you look at this
[46:18] that Sun that's out there this morning
[46:20] the Sun the Moon the Stars Psalms 148
[46:23] records in that the Sun though you
[46:26] didn't hear it this morning it's singing
[46:27] praise the Lord you didn't hear the moon
[46:30] last night but the moon is singing his
[46:32] praises you didn't hear the stars yet
[46:34] the stars are singing his praises you
[46:36] know what that tells us about worship
[46:38] worship itself is where the creation
[46:41] gueules in position and does what the
[46:45] creator has called it to do so if it
[46:49] would be that way for the sun for the
[46:51] moon for the stars which are part of
[46:53] god's bible and are actually
[46:55] representative of our life as sons and
[46:58] daughters of god what honor to be has
[47:00] sons and daughters of God when we are
[47:03] back in position and where we are
[47:05] dwelling in Christ where we need to be
[47:08] then we get back to Genesis 1 again
[47:10] where the man has dominion or glory
[47:16] because you see the sons of God the sons
[47:20] of God were not giving light as they
[47:22] ought to give light you know you are
[47:24] known as the stars of God in the book of
[47:28] Isaiah 14 it deals with how Lucifer thou
[47:31] art ascended above the stars of God
[47:33] which are the Messiah's brothers amen
[47:37] then though God remember has he told
[47:40] joke where were you when the morning
[47:42] stars sang together and the sons of God
[47:46] shouted for joy amen
[47:50] not to think of this it was like you
[47:52] know in the beginning you know where God
[47:54] here where light itself would illuminate
[47:56] within the hearts of the children your
[47:59] Bible tells us in first John chapter 1
[48:01] verse 5 this is the message we have
[48:03] heard of him and declare to you that God
[48:06] is light and in him is no darkness at
[48:11] all
[48:12] amen now notice here is prophecy that is
[48:15] coming regarding this light that is
[48:18] coming back to the earth and I was a
[48:20] afore t25 thus saith thus saith God the
[48:23] Lord he that created the heavens and
[48:25] stretched them out he that spread forth
[48:28] the earth and that which cometh out of
[48:29] it he that giveth breath and bread a
[48:31] breath unto the other the people upon it
[48:34] and spirit to them that walk therein and
[48:36] the Lord have called thee in
[48:38] righteousness and will hold thy hand and
[48:41] will keep thee and give thee for a
[48:44] covenant of the people for a light for
[48:48] the Gentiles to open the blind eyes this
[48:54] is more than just natural seeing because
[48:57] you can have natural eyesight that's
[48:59] 20/20 or whatever you want to say but
[49:02] you can be blind as a bat spiritually
[49:05] and if you had a choice if I had a
[49:07] choice of what kind of blindness if I
[49:09] had to say I gotta make a choice about a
[49:11] blindness I would rather be naturally
[49:15] blind although that would be hard there
[49:17] would be things I would have to make
[49:18] amends to get around I would rather be
[49:21] naturally blind than to be spiritually
[49:24] blind you realize people can look right
[49:29] at the word and they're looking right at
[49:31] life and be blind why it's the angle
[49:36] they're looking at it so you've got to
[49:39] look at light in the right angle or else
[49:43] you can go blind instead of looking at
[49:46] the light in the right way the light to
[49:49] show you on the right pathway let me
[49:54] just stay here this morning and give me
[49:57] a covenant of the people for a light of
[49:59] the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to
[50:03] bring out the prisoners from the prison
[50:05] and then that sent in darkness out of
[50:08] the prison house now here it here is
[50:10] what's the amazement he's not going to
[50:12] go down to a maximum-security prison
[50:14] this is not going down to the local jail
[50:17] house this is not the kind of prison
[50:20] there was a greater prison that man was
[50:23] in than than the Correctional Facility
[50:25] out here out there there was a prison he
[50:28] was born into this prison and he can't
[50:33] get out of that prison but God provided
[50:36] a way by himself that he himself becomes
[50:40] the Covenant he himself bringing his
[50:43] life to that of the Gentiles to open up
[50:46] the blind eyes you see you've got to
[50:48] have your eyes open before you can ever
[50:51] see where you're going
[50:54] amen to bring out prisoners out of a
[50:58] prison house and them that set in
[51:01] darkness out of the prison house now
[51:05] remember there were Pharisees there in
[51:08] John eight they were quick to tell Jesus
[51:11] we never been in bondage to any man now
[51:16] remember Jesus called these guys
[51:18] righteous I don't want to just be
[51:23] righteous out here he called a righteous
[51:29] but we want a righteousness that
[51:32] exceeded a righteousness that is from
[51:36] within the heart and when that
[51:39] righteousness is from within the heart
[51:41] it will permeate all other areas in our
[51:44] life
[51:46] now watch this here in Isaiah 49 five
[51:49] and now saith the Lord that formed me
[51:51] from the womb to be his servant to bring
[51:54] Jacob again to him though Israel be not
[51:56] gathered yet shall I be glorious in the
[51:59] eyes of the Lord and my god shall be my
[52:01] strength now some of these you realize
[52:02] is breaking back and forth even talking
[52:04] on the Israel's were gathering and he
[52:06] said it is a light thing that thou
[52:08] should us be my servant to raise up the
[52:11] tribes of Jacob and to restore the
[52:14] preserved of Israel I will also give
[52:17] thee for a light to the Gentiles that
[52:20] thou may us be my salvation unto the end
[52:23] of the earth now these are prophecy this
[52:27] is God's Word this was prophecy that
[52:30] light was going to come into the world
[52:33] not natural light natural light was
[52:36] already here but it's got to come
[52:38] spiritual light into the world so how
[52:41] this is already it's already unnoted
[52:44] it's prophecy of the light that is
[52:47] coming now here we find in Luke chapter
[52:49] 2 we find a man by the name of Simeon
[52:52] here he is you know simians just the
[52:54] Bible refers to him as being a just and
[52:57] a devout man he was waiting for the
[52:59] consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost
[53:01] was upon him Simeon was a spirit lead
[53:04] man he was acquainted with God
[53:07] you see exam Ian was he was walking in
[53:10] tune with God as much as God had
[53:12] revealed Simeon was looking at things in
[53:15] the word and you could sit down with
[53:17] Simeon and say he must have had a real
[53:18] good understanding know what he had was
[53:20] faith there was a faith that was
[53:22] operating within his life that Simeon
[53:25] beau could look at something and you
[53:26] know it's been like maybe a shadow
[53:28] that's on the wall and you have that
[53:29] shadow way out here and you look at that
[53:31] shadow and you can have cement Simeon do
[53:33] you see what that is no but I believe it
[53:36] Simmons said no I don't stand it but I
[53:38] believe it he didn't under he wasn't
[53:41] about his understanding but you see the
[53:43] holy spirit it was welcome and he made a
[53:46] visitation to Simeon he was waiting on
[53:49] this promise now notice Simeon is
[53:51] directed out of his office he comes to
[53:53] the place where they are bringing the
[53:55] Lord Jesus the baby here they are to
[53:57] have him you know
[53:58] concise on the eighth day and he comes
[54:00] out of his office led by the Spirit of
[54:02] God he picks him up there in his arms
[54:05] and he says in verse 34 my eyes have
[54:07] seen thy salvation which thou has
[54:10] prepared before the face of all people a
[54:13] light to lighten the Gentiles and the
[54:17] glory of thy people Israel now notice
[54:19] what's happened it has moved from where
[54:21] it was prophecy now it is identifying
[54:25] here is what Isaiah was talking about so
[54:31] what was it it's the same spirit of God
[54:33] as we talked about earlier with Abel it
[54:36] is God he is committed to his word and
[54:39] his subjects that are upon this earth it
[54:42] is God who is revealing himself and
[54:45] making his Advent himself known to his
[54:49] children now when we look at this word
[54:51] lighten that I don't want to take a lot
[54:53] of time with it but the word lighten
[54:55] itself is revelation this word here it's
[54:57] to be revealed its manifestation it's
[55:00] coming appearing it's it's laying bare
[55:02] or making naked a disclosure of truth
[55:05] instruction it's used of events by which
[55:08] things or states of persons hitherto
[55:11] withdrawn from view are made visible to
[55:15] all manifestation and appearance saw a
[55:19] light to lighten the Gentiles so now
[55:21] this revelation that is breaking forth
[55:24] now when we look at this the light of
[55:27] this divine revelation we know that even
[55:29] though it was spoke here in the Old
[55:31] Testament but there has to be a way in
[55:34] thinking that this light would actually
[55:36] come back into man and bringing man back
[55:40] to the condition that he was there in
[55:42] Genesis 1 now here when we look in gen
[55:45] John chapter 1 and just to read here
[55:48] just from a little bit in John chapter 1
[55:50] verse 1 in the beginning was the word
[55:53] and the Word was with God and the Word
[55:57] was God
[55:59] the same was in the beginning with God
[56:02] all things were made by him and without
[56:05] him was not anything made that was made
[56:09] in him was life and the life was the
[56:13] light of men so you have the word you
[56:19] have the life you have the light what
[56:21] are they they're all the same it's God
[56:23] God is light there is no life outside of
[56:27] God amen so here John reaches back under
[56:33] divine inspiration and he brings out the
[56:35] condensation of God of how that God
[56:38] would come dance in here in the
[56:40] beginning the Word was with God the Word
[56:43] was God
[56:43] and here we find that here God the
[56:46] unfolding of God how that that light in
[56:49] here God speaks and the light there if
[56:52] forming God moving right there within
[56:54] that light coming down and it begins to
[56:57] bring about creation the planets the
[56:59] Stars all those things setting in their
[57:01] place and God moves upon the earth this
[57:04] place where you and I call home and
[57:06] which God deals with as far as in
[57:10] Redemption this will be even where we
[57:12] will dwell in the millennium and in the
[57:14] future hold so to think of how that God
[57:17] would move down within this time and he
[57:20] will bring light upon this earth here
[57:22] John is recording all of that that this
[57:25] one is the very light giver himself the
[57:28] light that lighteth every man verse five
[57:31] the light shine ahthe in darkness and
[57:33] the darkness comprehended it not
[57:38] amen the darkness cannot comprehend it
[57:41] there was a man sent from God whose name
[57:44] was John the same came for a witness to
[57:47] bear witness of the light that all men
[57:50] through him might believe very important
[57:53] part here he was not that light John was
[57:58] not the light but was sent to bear
[58:00] witness of that light you got to see
[58:04] John right or you go blind
[58:07] amen he's only a reflection of the true
[58:12] light amen so here here it's showing
[58:17] God's the way God works in order to
[58:20] reveal and make known this true light
[58:23] that is coming upon earth God sends a
[58:25] forerunner to announce this light and to
[58:29] bear witness of the light that's coming
[58:31] up remember now John bore witness of the
[58:34] light that was coming but when that
[58:36] light came the light itself came down
[58:39] and it stepped inside of a body Oh glory
[58:45] be to God oh my that was the true light
[58:49] which lighteth every man that cometh
[58:52] into the world and the Word was made
[58:55] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[58:59] his glory the glory as of the only
[59:01] begotten of the Father full of grace and
[59:05] truth
[59:06] what do we find we find here the light
[59:10] of God is we will read here in just a
[59:12] few moments you find the light of God
[59:14] just as God he set forth man that man
[59:18] would be made up in a system of
[59:20] Tabernacles or as far as dwelling places
[59:23] you know brother Samson was was was
[59:25] highlighting that a little bit here on
[59:27] Thursday night we are made up we are
[59:29] three room house there right everybody
[59:32] in here you may have a lot of more
[59:33] houses or rooms in your house but you
[59:35] only live in three rooms you eat in the
[59:38] kitchen then you go to the living room
[59:40] parlor whatever you want to call it your
[59:42] family room you sat down and you talked
[59:45] but then you go to the bread bedroom to
[59:48] rest
[59:49] and in the bedroom is where life itself
[59:52] begins so there is man himself his body
[59:57] spirit soul now to look of how that the
[1:00:02] light of God that would move down here
[1:00:05] remember now as we look at this in John
[1:00:07] chapter 1 here the Bible it picks up on
[1:00:10] where John's see if Jesus in verse 29
[1:00:13] coming unto Him and he said behold the
[1:00:16] lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
[1:00:18] the world this is he of whom I said
[1:00:21] after me come up a man which is
[1:00:23] preferred before me for he was before me
[1:00:29] now who we talking about are we talking
[1:00:32] about this or are we talking about who's
[1:00:37] on the inside because if we're talking
[1:00:40] about this he was before me this was not
[1:00:43] before John come on now Elizabeth
[1:00:47] conceived before but who it was that was
[1:00:52] behind it that's different for he was
[1:00:57] before me and I knew him not but that he
[1:01:03] should be made manifest to Israel
[1:01:06] therefore am I come baptizing with water
[1:01:10] Omaha we could preach here for days you
[1:01:13] see John John knew he's coming but John
[1:01:17] what are you gonna do I'm gonna do what
[1:01:19] he has told me to do John how many
[1:01:23] people John baptized and one after
[1:01:25] another after another after another
[1:01:27] after another after another here one day
[1:01:30] goes by one week one month a year goes
[1:01:32] by what's John doing there baptizing
[1:01:35] where you see John and all he's down
[1:01:36] there baptized said where do you see
[1:01:38] John he's down there baptizing you know
[1:01:40] what he lived by the expression of that
[1:01:43] revelation and he waited there it showed
[1:01:46] he was waiting brother faith declares
[1:01:50] itself with the heart that'll wait on
[1:01:53] God I wonder how many had rose in the
[1:01:57] time and said I'm the Messiah but there
[1:01:59] was something within John they might
[1:02:02] have been miracles that they did but
[1:02:04] there was something in John that just
[1:02:06] said don't move you say how would he
[1:02:08] know that the same way that you know it
[1:02:11] and man it is by divine revelation it's
[1:02:16] something within your heart that just
[1:02:18] takes hold even when you can't explain
[1:02:21] it you say man this is life
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:26] so what do you do keep on baptizing
[1:02:32] looks like it's getting awful close for
[1:02:34] the Samuel do you think all the cash in
[1:02:35] my 401k no I think you ought to get
[1:02:37] ready for work tomorrow just be found
[1:02:42] doing what you would be doing Oh to be
[1:02:49] to God if you're making an apple pie
[1:02:53] call me up and I'll come over and do
[1:02:56] what I do and I knew him not but that he
[1:03:01] should be made manifest to Israel there
[1:03:04] for him I come baptizing with water and
[1:03:06] John bear record saying I saw the Spirit
[1:03:10] descending from heaven like a dove and
[1:03:12] it abode on him and I knew him not but
[1:03:18] he that sent me to baptize with water
[1:03:20] the same said unto me upon whom thou
[1:03:24] shalt see the spirit descending and
[1:03:27] remaining on him the same is he which
[1:03:30] baptizeth with the Holy Ghost here is
[1:03:35] gone here what we find God has remember
[1:03:39] pitch this tent in there's a tabernacle
[1:03:41] a body that God has prepared for himself
[1:03:47] just as it was in the beginning Adam
[1:03:50] steps straight from the hand of God
[1:03:53] but in Redemption it was not to where
[1:03:57] God could just speak and then a body
[1:03:59] would come out just and be created but
[1:04:02] remember the fall had come by the woman
[1:04:05] so now he must come through and by the
[1:04:08] woman but he never borrowed anything of
[1:04:11] Mary except just the womb amen it was no
[1:04:15] blood his blood was not Jew nor Gentile
[1:04:18] and then it is the creative blood of God
[1:04:22] and here God is coming down what we read
[1:04:26] right here God is coming down to claim
[1:04:28] his tabernacle God is saying listen to
[1:04:32] me now
[1:04:32] when the Holy Ghost coming here upon
[1:04:35] this tabernacle of the Lord Jesus it is
[1:04:38] God laying claim this is my beloved Son
[1:04:42] in whom I'm well pleased or pleased to
[1:04:44] dwell in he is laying claim he is making
[1:04:49] redemption claims and saying my word has
[1:04:53] made this body and now I'm coming to
[1:04:56] redeem it it is his word that has made
[1:05:03] up the body of Jesus Christ now I'm
[1:05:08] talking about spiritual the sons and
[1:05:11] daughters of God that go to make up the
[1:05:14] bride of Jesus Christ just as Eve was
[1:05:18] taken out of Adam surely is the bride of
[1:05:21] Jesus Christ not taken out of a church
[1:05:24] she's taken out of the sign of Christ
[1:05:27] himself
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:32] Oh glory be to God he comes into the
[1:05:36] world is filled with darkness now they
[1:05:40] still got Sun they there's still Sun
[1:05:42] their crops are growing still the
[1:05:44] sunlight still the moonlight still the
[1:05:46] Stars but it's a world filled with
[1:05:48] darkness darkness is upon the earth yet
[1:05:54] it's bright as it is out here today so
[1:05:56] you realize we're not talking about a
[1:05:57] natural darkness we're talking about
[1:05:59] spiritual darkness paul records and in
[1:06:02] ephesians 6
[1:06:03] it's a spiritual darkness of this day
[1:06:09] hey man paul records in another place
[1:06:12] this present evil darkness so if light
[1:06:16] listen to me now if light true light is
[1:06:19] the person of Jesus Christ
[1:06:23] God Himself then darkness is also a
[1:06:27] person
[1:06:31] darkness we're not talking about natural
[1:06:33] darkness we're talking about demonic
[1:06:37] demons darkness said covered over
[1:06:41] unbelief doubt that brought blinding and
[1:06:44] this darkness that is over mankind you
[1:06:49] see this term that we use and then in
[1:06:51] the New Testament darkness it means it
[1:06:53] is something that holds sway over man's
[1:06:58] life where people desire to be I want to
[1:07:02] be free of this and I want to be free of
[1:07:03] that how many people you know I've spoke
[1:07:05] with people they want to be free of
[1:07:06] drugs I don't want to do this and I
[1:07:08] don't want to do that I don't want to do
[1:07:09] this and you know the reality of it is
[1:07:11] when they say I don't want to do it it
[1:07:13] has to be a deliverance come to them and
[1:07:16] listen friends let me just say right now
[1:07:17] the devil has no power if you expose him
[1:07:21] and you repent and you say I do not want
[1:07:25] this devil around in my life he has to
[1:07:28] free it's not the preacher who praise
[1:07:31] him off of you you have to release it
[1:07:38] down at byc in that camp there was a lot
[1:07:41] of demonic expression we labored with
[1:07:44] right there right there praying for many
[1:07:47] of them right there I'm looking at him
[1:07:49] and praying I'm giving him instructions
[1:07:50] and speaking to him and speaking the
[1:07:53] Word of God over you know the peace of
[1:07:55] God the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:07:56] encourage you what else is there is
[1:07:58] there something down there in their life
[1:07:59] I'm telling you right now you witness
[1:08:01] that people can stay in that condition
[1:08:03] until they expose that devil that's in
[1:08:07] their lapid brother when that word when
[1:08:09] it comes and they expose that Satan is
[1:08:12] helpless that's why he makes a fuss the
[1:08:16] way he does and people squirming and
[1:08:18] everything else that demon is afraid of
[1:08:21] light it knows that light has chased it
[1:08:25] it has chased it
[1:08:27] it has pressed it I tell you Satan has
[1:08:30] no power if you can just expose it
[1:08:46] watch this here
[1:08:51] there have been glimpses of light no
[1:08:52] watch'n John 3:16 for God so loved the
[1:08:57] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[1:09:02] that who so believeth in him should not
[1:09:05] perish but have everlasting life for God
[1:09:09] sent not his son into the world to
[1:09:11] condemn the world but that world through
[1:09:14] him might be saved he that believeth on
[1:09:19] him is not condemned
[1:09:23] so this this verse of scripture even a
[1:09:26] person that is not in him because you
[1:09:30] can't get in him without him baptizing
[1:09:34] you into himself not talking about this
[1:09:37] water I'm talking about the Holy Ghost a
[1:09:42] person can believe they can have the
[1:09:46] gospel preached to them they can believe
[1:09:50] unto salvation and they are saved are
[1:09:57] you with me but as you understand that
[1:10:00] as well
[1:10:01] when they come just for that place they
[1:10:04] can also fall right off as well there's
[1:10:07] no security are you hearing me now
[1:10:11] there's no seal there's no security hey
[1:10:16] man amen amen
[1:10:18] but he that believeth not is condemned
[1:10:21] already because he hath not believed in
[1:10:24] the name of the only begotten Son of God
[1:10:26] and this is the condemnation nauseous in
[1:10:31] verse 19 that light is come into the
[1:10:34] world and Men loved darkness rather than
[1:10:39] light because their deeds were evil
[1:10:45] aren't you glad that there was something
[1:10:48] beneath your your darkness a man that
[1:10:54] were light would come over shower it
[1:10:58] exposes the darkness but there's
[1:11:00] something beneath that darkness like
[1:11:03] there was in Genesis one don't you see
[1:11:06] Genesis one is a story of redemption
[1:11:10] it's a story of the new birth the earth
[1:11:14] was without form and void and darkness
[1:11:18] covered the face of the deep
[1:11:22] amen but God said let there be light in
[1:11:26] the Spirit of God begin to move that
[1:11:29] word the Spirit of God there Ruach it
[1:11:32] means he begin to lock his wings he
[1:11:35] began to brood over that earth and who
[1:11:40] like a dove it's cooing over that earth
[1:11:43] to what bring forth and push away that
[1:11:46] darkness for every one that doeth evil
[1:11:54] hateth the light neither cometh to the
[1:11:59] light lest his deeds should be reproved
[1:12:03] but he that doeth truth cometh to the
[1:12:07] light that his deeds may be made
[1:12:09] manifest that they are wrought in God
[1:12:13] let me read this ones he out of the
[1:12:15] amplified batter Bible John 3:24 every
[1:12:19] wrongdoer hates loathes detest the light
[1:12:24] and will not come out into the light but
[1:12:27] shrinks from it lest his works his deeds
[1:12:34] his activities his conduct be exposed
[1:12:38] and reproved I don't know about you but
[1:12:41] when I need corrected I want to be
[1:12:43] corrected now this guy this guy this
[1:12:46] kind of want to be corrected this guy
[1:12:48] thinks too much of himself
[1:12:53] be honest with yourself now but this guy
[1:12:57] on the inside snow hey that correction
[1:13:00] is coming from my father and if I get
[1:13:02] corrected down here I won't be so layoff
[1:13:05] target out there
[1:13:06] it wants to be corrected there's times
[1:13:10] we need to be told you're all there's
[1:13:13] times we need correction you give your
[1:13:15] children spankings right
[1:13:19] maybe we need to do use this mic y'all
[1:13:23] still believe that's the Word of God
[1:13:24] right spare the rod spoil the child and
[1:13:28] what does what does Solomon say by the
[1:13:32] Spirit of God that you take the
[1:13:34] correction what this correction do real
[1:13:36] correction is to drive the foolishness
[1:13:39] out of the heart aren't you glad that
[1:13:43] God says I know right where the problems
[1:13:45] that this guy feels the sting but God's
[1:13:49] dealing with the heart why he can drive
[1:13:52] the foolishness away then what our life
[1:13:55] it reflects the correction in godly
[1:14:00] discipline oh I don't know it's going to
[1:14:04] be a family service but this is a family
[1:14:06] book and we are children of God aren't
[1:14:09] we Omaha notices in verse 21 but he who
[1:14:15] practices truth who does what is right
[1:14:19] comes out into the light so that his
[1:14:23] works may be plainly shown to be what
[1:14:27] they are
[1:14:30] let's look at this woman that we just
[1:14:33] read about in John 6 there's no way in
[1:14:35] the world that we would identify her has
[1:14:37] one who was practicing right we would
[1:14:40] look at her and say she's full of
[1:14:42] darkness and she was but down beneath
[1:14:46] there was a little representation that
[1:14:49] little representation that she had there
[1:14:52] she read what would word was given to
[1:14:55] her and she was able to say by the
[1:14:58] understanding of the word Messiah is
[1:15:01] coming and when he does come not maybe
[1:15:04] this little woman have faith are you
[1:15:07] with me she had faith yet she's still
[1:15:12] living in that condition you don't do
[1:15:14] away with that faith that faith will
[1:15:16] bring you on out Jesus didn't walk up to
[1:15:21] her and say you ain't got nothing he
[1:15:24] didn't say that she already had faith to
[1:15:28] believe that Messiah is coming you know
[1:15:34] what she meant she was abiding in that
[1:15:36] promise but now it's more like it's
[1:15:39] coming she's walking in that light if
[1:15:44] anybody's life anybody didn't want to be
[1:15:48] exposed she'd have been it but light
[1:15:52] exposed her life you got five husbands
[1:15:57] and the one you're living with now not
[1:15:59] even yours did it run her away no sir
[1:16:06] oh come on now Mary not one of us would
[1:16:09] sit there you know as far as our flats
[1:16:11] just Omaha Oh glory our flesh when we're
[1:16:14] being exposed but the inside man takes
[1:16:16] up there's something greater here you
[1:16:19] know Jesus are doing the light is
[1:16:21] pressing back the darkness to reach that
[1:16:23] daughter of God that's down there on the
[1:16:26] inside there's clouds of darkness about
[1:16:30] her life he's reaching down by light to
[1:16:34] break those clouds away so that his
[1:16:38] works may be plainly shown to be what
[1:16:40] they are brought in with God divinely
[1:16:43] prompted done with God's help in
[1:16:46] dependence upon him
[1:16:50] Oh Gloria think about this here here's
[1:16:58] the Lord Jesus in John 8 verse 12 he
[1:17:03] spake to them and he said I am the light
[1:17:07] of the world there's no other man could
[1:17:12] say that before I am the light of the
[1:17:17] world nice not talking about natural
[1:17:19] sunlight he that followeth me shall not
[1:17:25] walk in darkness simple words but one
[1:17:32] instruction he that followeth
[1:17:37] you've got to follow him and if you
[1:17:43] follow him you shall not walk in
[1:17:46] darkness as you follow him darkness
[1:17:52] flees as long notice but you shall have
[1:18:00] the light of Life as long as I am in the
[1:18:06] world I am the light of the world I'll
[1:18:13] tell you Jesus Christ is still the light
[1:18:15] of the world he men he steal the light
[1:18:19] of the world that same light that has
[1:18:21] come into the heart of the believer and
[1:18:23] lights up the life of the believer
[1:18:25] he is our light notice in John 11 9
[1:18:30] jesus answered jesus answered and said
[1:18:31] are there not twelve hours in the day
[1:18:33] If any man walk in the day he stumbleth
[1:18:35] not because he seeth the light of this
[1:18:38] world
[1:18:40] but if a man walk in the night he
[1:18:42] stumbleth because there's no light in
[1:18:44] him
[1:18:46] how many had night lights in your house
[1:18:50] some folks saying you're brave enough
[1:18:51] raise your hand some of you may not have
[1:18:55] night lights in your house but you've
[1:18:57] got maybe even if you pull your blinds
[1:18:59] you've got a little bit of light that
[1:19:01] will come around from the street lights
[1:19:03] stars it'll kind of come around that you
[1:19:06] know the only where you pulled that
[1:19:07] blind down it'll come around there or
[1:19:09] maybe your curtains some of it will come
[1:19:10] right through it so when you get up in
[1:19:13] the middle of the night then it's pitch
[1:19:14] black it's really not pitch black I know
[1:19:19] sometimes you get used to where things
[1:19:21] are okay
[1:19:22] Threepio paste is here to the forward
[1:19:25] the bed's right here go to the right and
[1:19:27] everything you've got everything
[1:19:29] subconsciously beginning your keys and
[1:19:33] let me rearrange your bedroom set and
[1:19:36] then you walk blindfolded into that room
[1:19:38] all the lights are off you will find
[1:19:41] yourself what in the world what's going
[1:19:45] on here something's all allocator why
[1:19:49] because you or me do not have light in
[1:19:53] ourselves to be able to light our
[1:19:56] natural pathway no more than we have
[1:20:01] liked in ourselves spiritual light to
[1:20:03] lighten our spiritual pathway we need
[1:20:07] his light without his light its
[1:20:13] stumbling it's guessing it's confusion
[1:20:16] but when light is calm here lights
[1:20:19] things up because there's no light in
[1:20:25] him now I want you to think of this here
[1:20:27] within our lives how God will lay down
[1:20:29] this little representation because we
[1:20:32] are made to be dependent on a light
[1:20:34] source you know you're just like if
[1:20:37] you're outside you got to work on your
[1:20:38] car at night or change the oil or
[1:20:39] whatever more you'll see them with the
[1:20:41] lights on the garage right somebody's
[1:20:43] not pulled up you know pull it in there
[1:20:45] and they're you know they're without
[1:20:47] lights
[1:20:47] what are you doing change your all how
[1:20:50] do you know you're getting right think
[1:20:51] now don't you need like nah I don't need
[1:20:54] a light just turn turn that phone I turn
[1:20:55] that flashlight off I've got it
[1:20:59] if it was your car I guarantee you'd be
[1:21:02] saying stop you're in working on my car
[1:21:06] without light that's the same way in our
[1:21:11] lives spiritually you're not working on
[1:21:14] my life without light it's got to be the
[1:21:16] lights of the world of God the Holy
[1:21:19] Ghost that comes down to work on our
[1:21:22] lives
[1:21:24] amen a man is not preaching his thoughts
[1:21:27] he's preaching by the divine inspiration
[1:21:30] of the light of God to do on it spells
[1:21:35] darkness that would want to encroach on
[1:21:38] our life uncertain sound he said now we
[1:21:47] just found out that your body is full
[1:21:50] like x-ray proves that the x-ray does
[1:21:55] not have any light of its own
[1:21:57] it's your light that it uses you're born
[1:22:02] with four rays after a while say 2025
[1:22:07] one ray goes out and 35 another or 40
[1:22:14] another one goes out or this encouraging
[1:22:18] in there and finally when you get pass
[1:22:22] about 65 you're living on your last ray
[1:22:28] every time you take an x-ray picture
[1:22:30] you're tearing them Ray's down that's
[1:22:35] the reason you don't have no more you
[1:22:37] stick these kids feet
[1:22:38] in their machines because it's just
[1:22:40] tearing the Rays right out of their
[1:22:42] little body and that's cosmic light
[1:22:45] that's in you that you're made up of
[1:22:47] full of light cells that's cosmic light
[1:22:52] but God is a different light but yet
[1:22:56] he's light
[1:22:57] I think that picture there's a great
[1:22:59] proof of what I'm fixing to say that God
[1:23:01] is light and when we were walking in the
[1:23:04] light of God as sons of God God is not
[1:23:08] cosmic light but God's light operated
[1:23:13] through the cosmic light of Our Bodies
[1:23:15] Ourselves
[1:23:17] we were absolutely at one time real
[1:23:21] genuine sons of God but when the fall
[1:23:25] came cosmic light yes but God is a
[1:23:33] different light God's desire is that
[1:23:38] these cosmic lights would be so pushed
[1:23:43] to where it's supremely eternal light
[1:23:47] God's light that's shining through Jesus
[1:23:53] told him in John let me just skip here
[1:23:55] John 12:46 I am come a light into the
[1:24:02] world but whosoever believeth on me
[1:24:05] should not abide in darkness I want you
[1:24:09] to catch this word believeth on me not
[1:24:14] in me you see just believing on him
[1:24:18] darkness starts to press away
[1:24:27] Matthew 4:16 we'll pick that up in just
[1:24:30] a moment Matthew 4:16
[1:24:31] here is the promise of Isaiah we read
[1:24:33] earlier coming to pass the people which
[1:24:36] sat in darkness saw a great light and to
[1:24:40] them which set in the region and shadow
[1:24:43] of death light is sprung up they were
[1:24:49] already had sunlight but he was in
[1:24:52] promise su in life
[1:24:54] this is promise s Oh in light the word
[1:25:00] had been spoken about this coming light
[1:25:02] but remember God's Way of recovering
[1:25:06] sight to the blind
[1:25:08] opening up blind eyes was that God
[1:25:11] Himself would make himself visible
[1:25:15] through man God revealed what Adam was
[1:25:23] in Christ
[1:25:31] Enoch had only heard about it are you
[1:25:34] with me
[1:25:34] Enoch had only heard about it from his
[1:25:37] great-grandpa
[1:25:39] Adam but he never saw it in display
[1:25:45] but Enoch had faith in what he heard and
[1:25:52] Enoch let that word so work in his life
[1:25:57] till one day that light that was working
[1:26:02] in his life has quickening power lifted
[1:26:06] him from these mortal realms why he
[1:26:12] believed that word but now his sons and
[1:26:16] daughters of God to see this expression
[1:26:19] it would take more than just word it had
[1:26:22] to be the expression of light himself
[1:26:26] how many were sitting in darkness the
[1:26:30] woman at the well she was sitting in
[1:26:32] darkness right
[1:26:34] hey she a she was a believer but she was
[1:26:37] still sitting in darkness Legion was
[1:26:41] sitting in darkness many of them were in
[1:26:44] darkness
[1:26:46] and a lights from up here's Peter Andrew
[1:26:51] Philip Nathanael on and on and on they
[1:26:54] were doing about their normal lives the
[1:26:57] light sprung up right where it was
[1:27:00] looking at the word and they could say
[1:27:02] ah this is him the one who Moses spoke
[1:27:06] off
[1:27:08] this is the one this is the one the
[1:27:10] Prophet spoke of light was springing up
[1:27:13] what did that light do when that light
[1:27:15] was made manifest to them not just in
[1:27:19] their midst but to them it led them and
[1:27:26] they started following that light did
[1:27:29] they understand everything they did not
[1:27:32] but they started walking in that light
[1:27:38] is that right they were following it but
[1:27:41] you had others who were religious
[1:27:45] that they looked run out and said we see
[1:27:47] Jesus said because you say you see now
[1:27:51] your sin remaineth they knew he was a
[1:27:56] man come from God they knew that
[1:28:00] Nicodemus testified of what we know now
[1:28:03] what a man come from God they seen the
[1:28:07] miracles that were done they seen the
[1:28:09] witness God was with Christ he was in
[1:28:13] Christ
[1:28:14] performing his word they saw it you say
[1:28:18] what was it about their lives darkness
[1:28:22] that's why Jesus said be careful that
[1:28:26] the light in you be not darkness they
[1:28:31] had light but it was darkness that
[1:28:36] darkness that was in them Jesus records
[1:28:39] it when he stands there with Peter and
[1:28:43] Peter takes off the high priests ear he
[1:28:45] puts the ear back on and Jesus said now
[1:28:48] is the hour at hand for them and the
[1:28:53] power of darkness moving in you that's
[1:28:57] the book of Matthew what was moving them
[1:28:59] the power of darkness yet religious but
[1:29:04] yet the power of darkness held sway they
[1:29:07] couldn't recognize the very one but they
[1:29:10] quoted about read about and said they
[1:29:13] believed in and yet the power of
[1:29:16] darkness was upon their lives and they
[1:29:19] crucified the very lord of glory
[1:29:22] Paul said had the princes of this world
[1:29:24] knew
[1:29:26] they would not have crucified but they
[1:29:30] were blinded relented for our sake
[1:29:38] let me just try to bring this down to a
[1:29:40] spot to leave you with something here
[1:29:44] Ephesians 5:8
[1:29:48] Paul expresses it like this for ye were
[1:29:53] sometimes darkness not you were in
[1:29:59] darkness
[1:30:00] you were darkness you were but now are
[1:30:06] ye light in the Lord not just you're in
[1:30:11] the light you are the light amen
[1:30:16] at one time you were darkness but now
[1:30:20] are you light in the Lord Amen there was
[1:30:25] a pot that was already there within you
[1:30:30] what needed what was needed it was
[1:30:34] needed for the great divine energy the
[1:30:38] light of God to move upon your life and
[1:30:42] press back that darkness now watch this
[1:30:51] here Colossians 1 verse 12 giving thanks
[1:30:56] unto the Father which hath made us meet
[1:31:05] to be partakers of the inheritance of
[1:31:09] the Saints in night
[1:31:14] who made this possible did you know did
[1:31:18] me know but our Father well how did I
[1:31:22] file for make it possible God is a
[1:31:24] spirit but God created a body he became
[1:31:30] one of us very men and he stepped down
[1:31:37] within that body he paid the price he
[1:31:40] said the blood there was a debt a lien
[1:31:43] against you and I and he paid that debt
[1:31:49] he provided what was needed that you and
[1:31:53] I might become partakers of the
[1:31:57] inheritance of the saints and light
[1:32:00] you realize this inheritance already
[1:32:04] belong to you and I you don't inherit
[1:32:09] something that don't belong to you if I
[1:32:13] take off this if I take this jacket and
[1:32:15] give it to you didn't inherited you
[1:32:18] didn't belong to you I gave it to you
[1:32:21] but if you let me use this check it and
[1:32:24] I wear this jacket and then I take it
[1:32:27] back off and I give it to you
[1:32:28] he had already belonged to you our
[1:32:32] inheritance belong to us but the
[1:32:39] darkness that we were under we could not
[1:32:42] be partakers of it there had to be one
[1:32:47] that would be able to put his hands on a
[1:32:51] holy God and a sinful man
[1:32:55] there was a chasm that was there that
[1:32:59] separated God and man but here God
[1:33:04] became man that's why there is no other
[1:33:08] mediator than the man Christ Jesus put
[1:33:15] his hand upon our lives and here a hand
[1:33:20] a hand from the holy God and it joins us
[1:33:24] together in a union in a harmony in a
[1:33:28] oneness he provided the way I won't you
[1:33:38] just can I have just a few more moments
[1:33:41] I want you to just leave you with this
[1:33:43] and zero in on this now
[1:33:47] he from his his side was opened up out
[1:33:54] of his side went the water blood
[1:33:59] there was a spirit
[1:34:03] all three of them go together to make
[1:34:09] the birth
[1:34:12] birthing a son and daughter of God
[1:34:17] fully into what God intended them to be
[1:34:21] see the water it's a preaching of the
[1:34:24] word that lets you know you're a sinner
[1:34:27] and there's one who died for you he paid
[1:34:31] the price there's got to come that
[1:34:33] conviction
[1:34:36] you repent and you walk into the waters
[1:34:40] of mantis to be identified with your
[1:34:44] sacrifice
[1:34:46] then I'm identifying with the sacrifice
[1:34:50] of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:51] he is my sacrifice then his working in
[1:34:54] the life it cleanses that life up now
[1:34:57] God can do this very quickly it's not
[1:35:00] the same with everybody but yet it is
[1:35:02] the same amen all the time to live all
[1:35:06] that's in the hands of God are you with
[1:35:09] me
[1:35:09] but it's all in God's hands and God is
[1:35:12] moving listen to me now it's God moving
[1:35:16] himself forward in your life
[1:35:26] you hear me
[1:35:29] you might think I'm off my rocker but
[1:35:30] I'm not who hath delivered us from the
[1:35:37] power of darkness
[1:35:40] and hath translated us into the kingdom
[1:35:44] of his dear son in whom we have
[1:35:48] redemption through his blood even the
[1:35:52] forgiveness of sin the notice he
[1:35:54] delivered us from the power of darkness
[1:35:56] and translated us into the kingdom of
[1:36:00] his dear son
[1:36:02] yet I'm in the same body you're in the
[1:36:07] same body
[1:36:10] so this deliverance it's a breaking of
[1:36:14] that power of darkness in our life
[1:36:18] but translating is where that part it
[1:36:22] moves into the expression the full
[1:36:26] expression as a son and daughter of God
[1:36:32] starts out small but it gets there let
[1:36:38] me read something to you
[1:36:41] everybody with me
[1:36:42] I want you to pay attention remember
[1:36:45] when a man is saved like this button
[1:36:50] here
[1:36:51] what brother I'm slumping about just
[1:36:53] like that button that button becomes
[1:36:57] eternal life in your heart when he's
[1:37:00] saved that's God as you're able to push
[1:37:05] out all the roots of bitterness then God
[1:37:09] begins to spread in you then you become
[1:37:14] a son of God so you see it isn't so much
[1:37:18] listen to me now in one way of a type
[1:37:20] it's moving from the outer court to the
[1:37:23] inner court to the holiest of holies it
[1:37:25] is a progression but what is that it's
[1:37:28] actually God as we're yielding
[1:37:32] it's him moving moving spreading out
[1:37:36] spreading out spreading out spreading
[1:37:39] out so a person can be saved and have
[1:37:45] that little white button in their life
[1:37:47] and have all kinds of habits
[1:37:51] you're with me what has to happen has to
[1:37:57] let that light grow in their life
[1:38:03] understand what I'm saying now so when
[1:38:06] the devil tries to point to you and say
[1:38:08] how you didn't have no experience with
[1:38:10] this and this and that you realize that
[1:38:12] what he starts he finishes no glory be
[1:38:25] to God look at this as you're able to
[1:38:28] push out all the roots of bitterness but
[1:38:31] some how do I get out the roots of
[1:38:33] bitterness
[1:38:33] by identifying it just just saying yes
[1:38:37] to the word amen that's the truth Lord
[1:38:40] giving yourself to a made man that's
[1:38:42] right what's happening little more
[1:38:46] little more little more pretty soon is
[1:38:51] just not this little speck on this desk
[1:38:53] right here pretty soon you might have
[1:38:54] this it's this now remember every inch
[1:39:00] of ground you gain the devil's going to
[1:39:02] try to take it back hello somebody
[1:39:08] hello he's going to try to take it back
[1:39:10] what do you got to do keep your eyes on
[1:39:13] the source of line and allow him to
[1:39:18] continue to spread his life then God
[1:39:24] begins to spread in you then you become
[1:39:27] a son of God he goes on to talk about
[1:39:31] how man was made to be a God go down to
[1:39:33] the next paragraph it says what happened
[1:39:34] what happened because he disbelieved
[1:39:37] God's Word it sent him right back out to
[1:39:40] shift for himself God's trying to bring
[1:39:43] him back and when you have faith and
[1:39:45] accept him my brother just let that
[1:39:49] little light begin to grow out
[1:39:54] that little light begins to move in
[1:39:57] there said I believe he's a son of God
[1:40:01] I believe he's my righteousness
[1:40:04] I'll take him as my savior right there
[1:40:07] little button what about the black
[1:40:12] button no it's too big
[1:40:17] too big
[1:40:19] this little button right here
[1:40:21] or maybe that little button right there
[1:40:24] brush him to its little but it's gone
[1:40:29] but it's John let him spread out in your
[1:40:37] life like he spread out through the
[1:40:41] prophets like he spread out
[1:40:46] they can start like this accepting him
[1:40:49] as savior well brother Samuel they got a
[1:40:52] lot of habits on their lap did you clean
[1:40:54] yourself up Oh sir
[1:41:00] its Christ in us who cleans us up well
[1:41:06] I'm gonna stop doing this and I'm gonna
[1:41:07] quit doing that I'm gonna stop clicking
[1:41:09] on these sites and I'm gonna need ain't
[1:41:10] gonna do that you need to let him push
[1:41:13] through your life just let that little
[1:41:21] light begin to grow out taking all the
[1:41:24] roots of doubt and bitterness and
[1:41:27] yielding yourself to the Spirit then you
[1:41:31] begin to become a son of God a daughter
[1:41:34] of God begin to grow in the grace of God
[1:41:38] the Holy Spirit begins to build his
[1:41:42] kingdom within you it's not doing he's
[1:41:44] making a son and daughter again can I
[1:41:50] read a couple more quotes
[1:41:55] hallo this brother ran just goes right
[1:41:58] through this on and on how to treat some
[1:42:00] of these to you
[1:42:01] when a man saved that much of him is
[1:42:06] good
[1:42:07] that's the little light that comes in to
[1:42:12] make you quit doing what's wrong
[1:42:18] that little light yep because it's God
[1:42:24] light it's not self-made light it's
[1:42:31] touch spreading out in that life well I
[1:42:35] got a saint to find myself I gotta clean
[1:42:37] myself up you're right you we do need to
[1:42:39] be cleaned up yes sir
[1:42:41] gotta be cleaned up gotta be sanctified
[1:42:43] because he'll never feel a dirty cop but
[1:42:46] he who called you he is also the Saint
[1:42:50] the fire now if you can take all the
[1:42:56] malice and envy and strife and unbelief
[1:42:59] out that little button light of the
[1:43:03] light and power of God will keep growing
[1:43:07] growing growing growing crowding out
[1:43:13] unbelief now sisters just hold tight
[1:43:19] brothers have you ever come to a spot
[1:43:21] where you look around and say is there
[1:43:23] any more room for furniture here by now
[1:43:27] to get in the living room we've got to
[1:43:28] crawl over chairs
[1:43:29] I'm not saying about my house but you
[1:43:31] understand you put so much if we take
[1:43:33] this right here we take these pews right
[1:43:35] now I've got places to walk up here
[1:43:37] but brother Joy's you and I are lifting
[1:43:39] these pews up here and eventually we get
[1:43:41] this place filled with pews up here
[1:43:42] there won't be no more room for me to
[1:43:45] walk around now at first you take that
[1:43:48] first pew put it up here I can still
[1:43:50] come over here but then you'd get
[1:43:52] another pew and you put it right there

[1:43:56] then you grab another Pew
[1:43:57] put it right up there what are you doing
[1:43:59] you're trying to eliminate my movement
[1:44:03] so as we allow the Spirit of God to grow
[1:44:07] in our life what does it do it
[1:44:09] it's crowding out unbelief furniture
[1:44:14] that was once part not of the designer
[1:44:18] of the Almighty God but that begins to
[1:44:22] pass from our life see so many times
[1:44:28] people are so we're looking at something
[1:44:30] as though my lord I'll never have any
[1:44:33] problems I don't gotta fight one battle
[1:44:35] whatsoever oh no you gotta fight battles
[1:44:37] there is a growing out of this working
[1:44:39] of this life within you but listen if
[1:44:43] you've got just this much God in your
[1:44:45] life you've got that eternal life part
[1:44:48] welling there you need to allow him to
[1:44:51] push out

[1:45:02] got this much right here you can take
[1:45:06] the promise greater receive that's in me

[1:45:12] yet I'm not fully got the baptism of the
[1:45:15] Holy Ghost but you've got that little
[1:45:16] white button that is the Holy Spirit
[1:45:19] there to work out in your life you've
[1:45:22] got a greater is He that is in you he's

[1:45:50] exportations of bodily exercise I'm
[1:45:54] gonna get me a mat and I'm gonna set on
[1:45:58] this mat and I'm gonna put my fingers in
[1:46:00] a certain way and I'm going to do this
[1:46:03] and I'm no longer
[1:46:08] we're not talking about mind over matter
[1:46:11] if that was needed if all we needed was
[1:46:14] a mat then God would have become a mat
[1:46:20] come on somebody we didn't need a mat
[1:46:23] what I'm gonna practice I'm gonna do
[1:46:29] this the problem is I that's the problem
[1:46:32] when I does it I fail you can do it what
[1:46:42] happened to be the little white button
[1:46:44] in your life allowing the Holy Spirit to
[1:46:48] move out in your life so you don't do it
[1:46:53] behind exportations of bodily exercise
[1:46:56] my boy this time I'm going to live heavy
[1:46:58] I'm gonna do more do a set of Philemon
[1:47:01] then we'll get heavier on you do a set
[1:47:03] of three and then I'll do a set of one
[1:47:05] and no you do it by sanctified
[1:47:12] consecrated life that the Holy Spirit
[1:47:15] moves through you hate to ask for more
[1:47:19] time but can I have a few more moments
[1:47:21] you say how do I do it by sanctified
[1:47:24] consecrated life if I'm desiring the
[1:47:27] Lord to sanctify and moving to this area
[1:47:29] in my life first of all the victory
[1:47:32] comes where you say Lord I want you to
[1:47:35] live in that door that's already the
[1:47:38] victory where you were inviting him in
[1:47:40] to live in that door in your life you're
[1:47:42] inviting him to come into that room of
[1:47:44] your life he comes up and knocks on you
[1:47:46] say go ahead Lord you can move right in
[1:47:47] there
[1:47:48] now you say well how do I do about
[1:47:49] sanctified consecrated life because
[1:47:51] already you are aligning yourself with
[1:47:53] the truth
[1:47:56] sanctify them Father through thy word
[1:47:59] thy Word is truth truth is not a
[1:48:03] doctrine it's the person the word is not
[1:48:08] a doctrine it's the person so how do I
[1:48:13] do it
[1:48:13] in your heart you align with God God
[1:48:17] deals with your heart Lord cleanse me
[1:48:21] Lord your promise is you are my Saint
[1:48:27] afire you're my cleanser you're the one
[1:48:32] who removes from my life you see what
[1:48:35] you're doing you're not presenting your
[1:48:37] works you are acknowledging who's in you
[1:48:44] you're acknowledging who's in you now if
[1:48:47] I probably ask brother Richard back
[1:48:48] there right now now picking on brother
[1:48:50] Richard but he probably couldn't even
[1:48:51] see that button
[1:48:53] right but you know what the effects of
[1:48:57] it the more that this button starts
[1:48:59] growing by the time of that button gets
[1:49:01] thrown out like this literature I see it
[1:49:03] I see that button well how does he now
[1:49:06] see it because one started out like this
[1:49:08] grows it grows till eventually when he
[1:49:13] looks up here it's like I don't see
[1:49:15] Samuel no more all I see is one big
[1:49:17] white button what's happened God taking
[1:49:23] over 30 man what do I do let him take
[1:49:30] over sanctified consecrated life be in
[1:49:34] the house of God when it's time read the
[1:49:36] Word of God pray have fellowship with
[1:49:39] him put forth that effort put forth
[1:49:43] those things because he is our
[1:49:46] sanctified let's close Lord Jesus
[1:49:59] Lord you are the light of the world
[1:50:06] you are still the light of the world
[1:50:08] you've come into this world that we
[1:50:12] lived in what I still remember but how
[1:50:18] many can join and fellowship with me
[1:50:20] well I remember when you came into my
[1:50:22] world my world was a mess a mess bored
[1:50:30] even myself oh yeah
[1:50:31] I had sit around the light of God the
[1:50:35] message that you sent to us the promises
[1:50:37] that were given in this day I said
[1:50:40] around it but Lord that light never was
[1:50:43] moving in me or my world it was a world
[1:50:49] of darkness darkness held sway in my
[1:50:54] life
[1:50:57] what it doesn't matter if a person goes
[1:51:00] out and does all these sorts of things
[1:51:02] or they just sit around in religious it
[1:51:04] still darkness unless there's light that
[1:51:09] comes in there it cannot be just light
[1:51:17] of the mind the Lord it's got to be the
[1:51:20] light of God
[1:51:23] I remember that ward
[1:51:26] that'll like this started little white
[1:51:29] button that started in my life you got
[1:51:32] ahold of my life that day
[1:51:34] well there were still things in my life
[1:51:37] yeah
[1:51:39] the Lord you begin to move you kept
[1:51:41] moving in my life you know order when I
[1:51:44] look back on it now maybe this would be
[1:51:46] help to somebody I didn't even make
[1:51:49] habits a focus
[1:51:53] you were the focus
[1:51:57] and Lord God by the grace of God you
[1:52:02] removed those things from my life I
[1:52:06] didn't remove you did that little white
[1:52:11] button they begin to grow all my prayer
[1:52:15] life did not start out like like it is
[1:52:17] right now and nothing but I still want
[1:52:21] more of you the Lord he was growing you
[1:52:25] were teaching me even in the reading of
[1:52:28] your word praying over in Lord
[1:52:33] or maybe there's someone here this
[1:52:35] morning or God hearts that they've had a
[1:52:40] little white button Lord like a white
[1:52:42] button start in their life maybe they've
[1:52:45] got Lord somewhat discouraged and yet

[1:52:50] realize there's no going back no
[1:52:55] no I know I know what has come into my
[1:52:58] life
[1:53:00] but the desire Lord God here this
[1:53:03] morning is they would be ready to equip
[1:53:06] themselves knowing that God that little
[1:53:10] white button it'll press out in their
[1:53:12] life if they will allow it to grow you
[1:53:16] don't take over and take over and take
[1:53:18] over and take over
[1:53:21] your prophet would type it also in the
