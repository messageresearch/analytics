[5:38] things here tonight
[5:40] and uh
[5:42] but we want to continue to remember them
[5:43] in prayer also um
[5:46] my mom and
[5:47] she just had got to tennessee and then
[5:49] they got news that my aunt that lives
[5:52] here in sandusky

[6:11] you know you just hear it there's other
[6:13] testimonies that you hear of
[6:17] just just really encouraging in this
[6:20] hour as well
[6:21] you know there's a lot of things you can
[6:23] you see a lot of things sometimes it's
[6:25] happening around you
[6:26] but there's a lot of things that's very
[6:28] encouraging as well
[6:30] it depends on what you're looking at
[6:32] and you know um i just you're just some
[6:35] different testimonies and things have
[6:37] just
[6:38] just shared with me and and i just want
[6:40] to thank god for his mercy how the lord
[6:42] just uh just keeping his hand
[6:45] upon his children not only here but
[6:47] around the world amen we thank god for
[6:50] that
[6:51] we certainly enjoyed the meetings this
[6:53] past weekend
[6:54] enjoyed the word of the lord
[6:56] and
[6:57] i just always believe that's something
[6:59] that's very very special we have a time
[7:02] it's like that to be able to come and
[7:03] gather around the word of the lord i
[7:05] certainly appreciate the gift amen in
[7:08] brother wayne's life and
[7:10] his consecration
[7:11] i just really really appreciate that
[7:13] appreciate his friendship
[7:15] and we certainly
[7:17] i can say we were edified as a body
[7:20] and that's what we
[7:22] that's one thing that we really look for
[7:24] is that lives would be would be edified
[7:27] amen in the presence of god
[7:29] so
[7:30] tonight
[7:32] we want to just turn our attention to
[7:33] the word and i just ask you just to
[7:36] just pray for me tonight and the lord
[7:38] will just help us just to
[7:41] just be able to step aside and that what
[7:43] it is that god desires to
[7:46] say to us that
[7:47] he'll just have free course to be able
[7:49] to say it tonight
[7:52] so we want to look here in the
[7:54] scriptures tonight in matthew chapter 5
[7:57] verse 9.
[8:00] and you may have to just use your bibles
[8:02] tonight we've got i sent the notes and
[8:04] things on over but we've got quite a
[8:07] process that's going
[8:10] back there as well tonight and
[8:12] everything wasn't reserved to tonight
[8:14] but there's been a lot that's been going
[8:16] on
[8:17] throughout the week so
[8:21] we just want to turn our attention to
[8:22] the word of the lord
[8:24] and wonder we just couldn't pray before
[8:26] we read in the scriptures here
[8:29] heavenly father
[8:31] lord as we just just come before you
[8:33] lord in this moment
[8:35] lord we thank you for the privilege and
[8:38] opportunity that you have given to us to
[8:40] be able to come together
[8:42] lord
[8:43] to step aside from the cares of this
[8:46] life and sometimes lord those cares and
[8:49] the burdens and what is upon our hearts
[8:52] and what we sense around us it
[8:55] it seems so great and not that it isn't
[8:58] great but i'm grateful lord that we can
[9:01] just by the grace of god step aside
[9:04] and to know that lord that you're
[9:06] mindful of our needs you know not only
[9:09] what we are are in presently
[9:12] facing or going through but god you're
[9:15] mindful of what even lays lord
[9:18] even within the next moment and right
[9:20] down the road
[9:22] so we just lord want to say thank you
[9:25] for that lord and we desire to just step
[9:28] aside lord
[9:30] from everything of this life and invite
[9:33] you tonight that you would just come and
[9:35] just speak to our hearts lord
[9:37] help me to just step aside oh god and
[9:40] this congregation that you can just come
[9:43] in lord as speaker and hearer oh god to
[9:46] minister to our needs in a very personal
[9:48] way lord we just want to be sensitive oh
[9:51] god to the mind of christ lord that
[9:54] you'll just say those things that would
[9:57] be necessary lord and most importantly
[10:00] that the holy ghost lord would come lord
[10:03] be the spokesman here tonight oh god may
[10:06] your presence just move oh god through
[10:09] this building tonight lord and for every
[10:12] need that's among us that our faith lord
[10:15] will be encouraged oh god to know that
[10:18] lord as your presence lord withdraw near
[10:21] to us o god it is just lord a witness
[10:25] god that you are mindful of our needs
[10:27] lord we love you and we thank you
[10:30] tonight father in the name of jesus
[10:32] christ amen
[10:35] amen in matthew chapter 5 and verse 9
[10:40] we want to just read this verse of
[10:42] scripture and we'll let you have your
[10:43] seats tonight
[10:46] blessed are
[10:47] the peacemakers
[10:49] for they shall be called
[10:51] the children of god
[10:53] how many want to be called and
[10:54] recognizes that that wherever you go
[10:57] someone says that was a child of god
[10:59] remember brother braham tells us that a
[11:01] seal shows coming and going you know
[11:05] sometimes where you can you maybe
[11:07] see a person or meet a person you think
[11:09] my concerning this person but then
[11:12] once they've been there and they leave
[11:14] you think
[11:17] but see a seal shows coming
[11:19] and going
[11:21] and that's what we want our lives to
[11:23] want it to be a display that it's that
[11:26] wherever we have been
[11:28] that there is a witness that that's a
[11:30] christian
[11:31] that's a child of god it may not be that
[11:33] everything goes our way but that's
[11:35] that's all right we want to have a
[11:37] testimony that in the midst of it that
[11:39] we're a child of god
[11:41] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[11:43] of the word as you're being seated
[11:46] as we just
[11:47] just turn our attention here just for a
[11:49] few moments into the word of the lord
[11:52] i want to just speak tonight on that on
[11:54] a on a part we were looking at that the
[11:56] last a few weeks ago on on peacemakers
[11:59] and i want to
[12:01] just really continuing with the thought
[12:02] but i want to deal with channels
[12:05] of god's peace and you know for every
[12:08] one of us we're going to be we are a
[12:10] channel
[12:11] for something and a channel is is that
[12:14] of an opening and what's what's
[12:16] available something that can move
[12:18] through you know a channel is actually
[12:21] a prescribed route that's set aside for
[12:23] something to flow if it's water there's
[12:26] a channel for that water to flow through
[12:28] that channel is is is is for that water
[12:31] or the channel for electricity for it to
[12:34] move in throughout this building
[12:37] and i think about the channel that when
[12:39] we look at it in
[12:41] as the bible would say as it was in the
[12:42] days of noah so shall it be
[12:45] in the coming of the son of man and
[12:46] that's just one part of it but when you
[12:49] look at it when the scripture would
[12:50] speak of it there in genesis 6 it would
[12:53] speak of how that the earth was filled
[12:56] with violence through them
[12:59] but yet as much as there were lies that
[13:02] were
[13:04] channels for violence to be made
[13:06] manifest and there had to be influences
[13:10] from another dimension that would bring
[13:12] about that influence in that time period
[13:16] and we know it was a time of of sin to
[13:19] where that god had seen it reached to a
[13:22] place it had just built to a place much
[13:24] like it has in this hour that we're
[13:27] living in
[13:28] to where that god would say enough
[13:31] is enough
[13:32] but you see before god will ever bring
[13:35] judgment god has already made a way of
[13:39] escape
[13:40] for those who would desire to escape
[13:42] and here god he there's a man in that
[13:45] time that is not known so much maybe
[13:48] around you know the rest of the
[13:50] community but he's a man that's known as
[13:52] a farmer by the name of noah
[13:55] and has a man that he is is available to
[13:58] god now brother graham would talk about
[13:59] how that noah himself would be one that
[14:02] was praying and you know he just just
[14:05] just was talking to the lord
[14:07] but yet god met him one day and god
[14:09] spoke to him and warned him that
[14:12] judgment is on the road
[14:15] and noah and he gave to noah a word a
[14:18] message that that there is going
[14:20] judgment is coming but i want you to
[14:23] prepare an ark for safety
[14:26] that will carry your family through that
[14:29] of the judgment
[14:30] and think of it when when noah himself
[14:33] how god when he comes into that place
[14:36] that noah himself after it's all said
[14:38] and done
[14:40] noah as god speaks to him come thou into
[14:43] the earth for i have seen thee and thy
[14:47] family righteous
[14:49] the righteousness was not anything of
[14:51] their own selves but what they did was
[14:55] they believed god's word they acted upon
[14:58] god's word and thereby god saw it as his
[15:02] as the righteousness on display so if
[15:05] there were those who were going to be
[15:07] channels of violence and channels of sin
[15:10] and all that immorality god had reserved
[15:13] to him upon earth a channel that
[15:16] righteousness could be made manifest to
[15:19] that generation that's the same thing
[15:22] god has done in this hour and that's the
[15:24] same thing where you and i are at as the
[15:26] bride of jesus christ and let me just
[15:28] bring it on down it's the same way it is
[15:31] with our lives individually no matter
[15:34] where we're at in our homes on your jobs
[15:37] wherever it is you are a channel for god
[15:42] to work through
[15:43] a channel that god's peace can come in
[15:46] to that situation
[15:48] in the book of mark chapter four this is
[15:51] recorded in in in matthew and luke as
[15:54] well but i want you just to think of how
[15:56] the scripture speaks here in verse 35
[15:59] the same day the bible said when the
[16:01] even was come he said to them let us
[16:04] pass over and to the other side and when
[16:06] they had sent away the multitude they
[16:10] took him
[16:11] even as he was in the ship i think
[16:14] brother branham takes this phrase and
[16:15] brother braham said that we could preach
[16:17] a message on that just take him as he is
[16:21] and there was also with him other
[16:24] little ships and there arose a great
[16:28] storm of wind and the waves beat into
[16:31] the ship so that it was now full
[16:35] and he was in the hinder part of the
[16:37] ship asleep on a pillow and they awake
[16:40] him and say unto him master carest thou
[16:44] not that we perish and he arose and
[16:48] rebuked the wind and said to the sea
[16:51] peace be still and the wind ceased and
[16:55] there was a great comb and he said to
[16:57] them why are you so fearful how is it
[17:00] that you have no faith and they feared
[17:03] exceedingly and said one to another what
[17:06] manner of man is this that even the wind
[17:09] and the sea obey him
[17:11] now to think of this that
[17:13] in the midst of this time remember how
[17:15] brother branham will will take this and
[17:17] brother bram will actually say it in
[17:19] this way
[17:20] he said jesus he says i don't believe he
[17:23] was exactly asleep even though he was
[17:25] tired and he was worn out he said but
[17:27] this was a time to test their faith to
[17:31] see where was their faith adam and in
[17:33] the midst of the circumstance and the
[17:36] situation that was going here jesus was
[17:39] in the ship he was resting but to
[17:41] recognize here was the god of all
[17:44] creation that had now come down and they
[17:47] had witnessed the things that only god
[17:50] could do
[17:51] not a man could do these things but only
[17:53] god could do it and this is where their
[17:56] focus should have been when the storm
[17:59] was coming up is to recognize who is
[18:02] there in the ship with them but instead
[18:07] just like any of us when the storm
[18:09] itself the bible just didn't say it was
[18:12] a storm of wind but it was a great storm
[18:15] it was a storm that you know it wasn't
[18:18] just waves that were coming along those
[18:20] waves were coming into the ship to where
[18:22] they actually begin to think that this
[18:25] boat is going down and so instead of
[18:28] recognizing who is in the ship they
[18:32] begin to become fearful they begin to
[18:35] speak to him and say do you not care
[18:37] that we perish and notice how jesus
[18:40] directs them in this hour you you know
[18:42] you find the word when it'll come and
[18:44] speak to our hearts the word does not
[18:47] only come to address a present situation
[18:51] but god comes to instruct us because you
[18:55] and i have had great storms of wind come
[18:58] about in our life there would be great
[19:01] storms of wind within the disciples not
[19:04] necessarily so much that we would read
[19:06] about upon the sea you could read of it
[19:08] when paul was being taken to rome but
[19:10] what about the great storm when
[19:12] persecution would hit the church of the
[19:14] living god what about when those things
[19:17] would come their way it wasn't waves
[19:19] coming into the ship but the difference
[19:21] was that there was a storm that was
[19:24] coming against them as believers but in
[19:27] the midst of that time i like how it
[19:29] says in acts 4 they gather themselves
[19:32] together and they begin to pray lord
[19:35] thou art the almighty god you know you
[19:38] and i have a choice on what we're going
[19:40] to focus on i i find it so fitting how
[19:42] the holy spirit would bring that even
[19:45] this weekend and opening up that service
[19:47] of focusing on the vindicated word of
[19:50] god it's not focusing on the vindicated
[19:53] word of the hour and everything else
[19:55] that's going on around us but there's
[19:57] got to come a time that where we look at
[20:00] circumstances around us jesus never told
[20:03] them to ignore the waves but rather
[20:06] don't let that be your focus let it be
[20:09] me who is in the ship be your focus
[20:12] because whatever you're focused on will
[20:14] dominate your life and that's what
[20:17] actually though a person could say i'm
[20:19] not focused on this i i'm focused on
[20:21] that but whatever you're focused on will
[20:24] actually come out in your life you know
[20:26] when a person maybe is going to get a
[20:28] surgery there's a you know a lot of a
[20:30] lot of ifs and possibilities and
[20:33] everything but but no surgeon goes
[20:35] through all the ifs and possibilities
[20:38] and gets you to focus upon the negative
[20:40] sure that is there but you know i've
[20:43] been in many times in situations of
[20:45] surgery and procedures whether it's been
[20:47] from my home or whether it's been from
[20:49] others right here in this assembly i've
[20:52] never one time had a doctor come in when
[20:54] i've been sitting there with the brother
[20:57] or the sister ever come in and paint
[20:59] such a negative picture but on the
[21:01] contrary i have this this has been
[21:04] settled this is the way we're going to
[21:06] go and they present and point this out
[21:09] in a positive way now that's what man
[21:12] can do we know man can fail but there's
[21:15] one that we know that cannot fail he
[21:18] said heavens and earth will pass away
[21:19] but my word shall never fail he said
[21:23] whatever's gone out of my lips i will
[21:25] not alter it or change it this this is
[21:28] the place that we can rest on that is
[21:31] sure foundation it's not sands that
[21:34] shifts upon things of time but it is a
[21:37] firm foundation i want you to notice the
[21:40] scripture here of how that when that
[21:42] wind could come up how that the lord
[21:45] jesus notice how he deals with this he
[21:47] rebukes the wind the bible says and he
[21:50] speaks to
[21:52] the sea
[21:54] you see because the sea itself was only
[21:57] responding
[21:58] to the wind that was coming upon it
[22:01] so he knew what needs to be addressed
[22:03] you see the word is set forth in
[22:06] discernment to know what things need to
[22:08] be addressed and then things to be
[22:10] rebuked and what things need to be spoke
[22:13] to yeah i think about when i look at
[22:14] this here i think about that man
[22:16] remember where he was coming home you
[22:18] know from from good services and he had
[22:20] his wife his wife would meet him at the
[22:22] door and you know she had all sorts of
[22:24] things to say why are you going to that
[22:26] meeting why are you going and carrying
[22:28] on like in all those things and remember
[22:30] brother braham said that with that man
[22:32] he couldn't understand brother branham
[22:33] why is this still going on with my wife
[22:36] and brother branham simply told him
[22:38] brother you're approaching it in the
[22:40] wrong way because he would get her by
[22:42] the hand and you know the story he would
[22:44] he would just he was going to cast that
[22:46] spirit off her i rebuke you in the name
[22:48] of jesus christ i i mean and brother
[22:50] bram said here they were just spinning
[22:51] around i mean that had been a sight to
[22:53] see trying to hold on to the hand and
[22:55] cast that to cast that spirit away from
[22:57] her but brother branham comes along and
[22:59] says just go out the next time and get
[23:02] her a box of chocolates and you bring
[23:04] those box of chocolates in there and
[23:06] what was it he was dealing with an
[23:08] expression of love because brother bram
[23:11] tells us evil spirits are not cast out
[23:14] through indifferent and cruel living but
[23:17] he said evil spirits are cast out by the
[23:20] love of god
[23:22] is to have that love that's present
[23:24] there so to recognize that spirit is
[23:26] right there but how do we address that
[23:29] spirit and remembering that the sea
[23:31] itself is what is under the experience
[23:34] of that wind coming the sea just needs
[23:37] to be spoken to that that peace be still
[23:40] and the wind is what needs to be rebuked
[23:42] i i say it like this may god help us to
[23:45] be able to bring a discernment to rebuke
[23:48] the things that need to be rebuked and
[23:50] to also minister a calming to those
[23:54] things that need to be calmed and
[23:56] brought at peace
[23:58] i think to me it's i've always looked at
[24:00] this part within the scripture and of
[24:03] how the bible you know it's one thing
[24:05] when the wind settles like out here on
[24:07] lake erie it can be very windy but after
[24:10] the wind has you know faded off you'll
[24:12] still find that water is going to be
[24:14] choppy that water will still have all
[24:16] the after effects from a wind that's
[24:18] been upon it but in this scripture it
[24:21] says that there was a great calm that
[24:24] came upon it you see this was not this
[24:27] this was not just any ordinary person
[24:30] this was god that had come down in the
[24:34] channel in this word in that of the lord
[24:37] jesus it was god that was speaking right
[24:40] there to that need and to that creation
[24:43] how that the lord jesus himself was a
[24:45] channel that the very peace of almighty
[24:48] god could be made manifest through
[24:51] i'd say it like this
[24:52] every one of us we create an atmosphere
[24:56] we know that
[24:57] we create an atmosphere and you know
[25:00] brother brahm talks about it he says you
[25:02] know you've been around people sometimes
[25:04] he said you just love to be around him
[25:07] then he said there's some people he said
[25:09] they're fine people good people but you
[25:12] just can't hardly stand to be around
[25:15] them
[25:16] it's because of the atmosphere that they
[25:19] create
[25:21] and so brother adam says i wonder what
[25:23] kind of an atmosphere that the lord
[25:26] jesus would have created he said because
[25:28] there was virtue when there were needs
[25:30] that came up remember they re there was
[25:33] virtue that went out of him the woman
[25:34] with the issue of blood other needs
[25:36] along the way there was virtue that went
[25:39] out of him to minister to that need and
[25:43] that's the same thing when brother
[25:45] branham brings us into that place this
[25:47] is the same way that our life is to be
[25:50] lived in jesus christ we cannot do it of
[25:53] our own strength but we can do it by
[25:55] being tapped in to the right resource
[25:58] and staying in that right channel this
[26:01] is what brother graham says he said what
[26:02] kind of atmosphere would that have been
[26:04] he said it would have been one great big
[26:06] bundle of love respects and godly fear
[26:11] now you know every one of us here when
[26:13] we we look at that and and think about a
[26:15] life that that where has passed from
[26:18] death unto life and and the peace of god
[26:20] has moved in to your heart and life to
[26:23] where there is no more condemnation that
[26:26] is there there's nothing between you and
[26:29] god he he's the love of your life
[26:31] there's been a change that has taken
[26:33] place on the inside it hadn't been that
[26:35] you just changed you know changed
[26:37] churches or changed people that you're
[26:39] associating with but there's a change
[26:41] that's come on the inside of you the
[26:43] things that you once loved you no longer
[26:45] love there's a piece on the inside that
[26:48] in the midst of of every situation that
[26:51] you know
[26:52] that i know that i know that i know i
[26:54] know where i'm standing and i know that
[26:56] i pass from death unto life i know what
[26:59] god has done in my life
[27:03] that's a piece that the bible said that
[27:05] passes all understanding
[27:09] now to think even in each of each life
[27:13] that can come around right even through
[27:15] this building to have that peace of god
[27:18] abiding right there in our soul
[27:21] but you know there are events that can
[27:23] come around that will try to take peace
[27:26] from our life
[27:27] it can never take the peace of god from
[27:29] your soul
[27:31] but it will try to take it from your
[27:33] spirit you know from your mind to where
[27:35] you become you know well i can't sleep
[27:38] i've been worried about this or i've
[27:39] been thinking about this and those
[27:41] things take place in our life just as
[27:43] much as we would not want them to happen
[27:46] but things come our way but you know god
[27:49] knowing that those things would come our
[27:51] way there is there is an avenue that for
[27:54] you and i that we can look to god and
[27:58] god himself is it moves on the behalf of
[28:02] his children by bringing about peace in
[28:04] the midst of a situation i know
[28:07] sometimes we look at that well i just
[28:09] need to have this trial removed but
[28:11] remember if god removes the trial then
[28:13] god's got to send it back because you
[28:14] got to pass that test
[28:17] is that right
[28:18] i mean god god just don't write a's in
[28:20] his book you know because you know we're
[28:22] well you're my pet no god doesn't do it
[28:24] that way every test and every trial now
[28:26] i'm talking about tests and trials
[28:28] because there's things about our life
[28:29] sometimes that's not tests and trials
[28:32] it's simply our own decisions that's got
[28:34] us into situations
[28:36] but god can help us he will mold us even
[28:39] in that because the bible says all
[28:41] things work together for the good he
[28:44] didn't say everything was but it'll work
[28:46] together for our good if we will allow
[28:49] god to teach us to mold us and to shape
[28:52] us in that time now think about it you
[28:54] know brother adam here he is in his
[28:56] house you've heard this this particular
[28:58] account many times but here in the
[29:01] prophet's home you know i would say that
[29:03] if we did not have these insights into
[29:05] the prophet's home we would probably
[29:07] think that you know brother banham you
[29:09] know just oh my if i just walk into
[29:11] brother braham's home man everything was
[29:13] just right you know i mean sister media
[29:15] everything man they never had no
[29:17] problems there i mean here is the
[29:19] prophet of god the messenger of the age
[29:22] but we know better than that
[29:25] and what i mean is is that they
[29:27] experienced things that came and tried
[29:30] to trouble and take away peace because
[29:33] the enemy was trying to battle against
[29:37] that channel of god's prophet and he
[29:40] would come in many different avenues
[29:42] he'd try to come and attack the family
[29:44] he tried to come in many ways why to
[29:46] draw him out in those situations to
[29:49] remove peace from his home but god think
[29:53] how god would guide and direct us here
[29:56] in brother ham's life you know brother
[29:58] band tells us of how
[30:00] in our lives he said if we'll learn to
[30:02] be patient and learn to love and learn
[30:05] to be kind he said you don't make our
[30:07] home life different
[30:09] he said it'll make every relationship
[30:11] you have a little different
[30:13] and he says and god will honor you for
[30:16] it the brother man begins to talk about
[30:18] the turmoil that was in his home at a
[30:21] certain day
[30:23] and now brother brown he calls he says
[30:24] it like this he says you can see people
[30:27] that here they are in my home they're
[30:29] staying in hotels they're all showing up
[30:32] to come and they want to have a meeting
[30:34] with brother branham they want to be
[30:36] prayed for i mean sometimes you and i
[30:38] think about maybe our privacy think of
[30:41] brother brandon when he describes it
[30:42] right here he doesn't just say people
[30:44] were sitting in his living room he said
[30:46] people were in his basement this day
[30:49] people walking around in his basement
[30:52] people all through his house they were
[30:54] going about three hours brother baby
[30:56] said he had cases of mental cases and
[30:59] nervous cases and he said people walking
[31:01] around that were saying you better
[31:03] listen to what i'm going to say because
[31:05] i got a word from the lord i've got thus
[31:07] saith the lord for you and you need to
[31:09] listen to me if you don't you're going
[31:10] to die brother bryan said i had all
[31:12] sorts of things like that going on very
[31:14] key phrase brother ram says right here
[31:16] he says sometimes you have to put up
[31:18] with those things
[31:20] that's a powerful statement isn't it
[31:22] because you because sometimes we'd be
[31:23] ready to say you know what there's a
[31:25] door right there
[31:27] because brother branham said it just as
[31:29] much as you and i could say it as well
[31:30] brother brown said god speaks to me as
[31:32] much as he speaks to you
[31:34] i mean you know when you think of but
[31:36] you recognize of where where the
[31:38] situation was at there in that home my
[31:41] what a what a situation that that was
[31:43] taking place and brother brown begins to
[31:46] talk about how things that were going on
[31:48] that that had happened that among people
[31:50] coming in there and then you had all
[31:52] this disturbance that was going on in
[31:55] the home with becky and sarah you know
[31:57] there was fussing and fighting and
[31:58] everything going on but you know why all
[32:00] that was
[32:02] it wasn't because they were bad kids
[32:06] it's because there was and there was
[32:08] other atmospheres that were coming in
[32:10] there
[32:12] can you imagine having people walk up
[32:14] and down your house and and telling you
[32:16] well i got thus saith the lord for you
[32:18] and heaven and people all around in your
[32:21] house i tell you it wouldn't be like a
[32:23] christmas gathering this was not like a
[32:25] thanksgiving gathering this brought
[32:27] tension in that home
[32:30] because brother bran brings it on down
[32:32] it's spirits it's things that's being
[32:35] dealt with it wasn't that the kids were
[32:37] bad it was situations that was going on
[32:40] and you know when you when you think
[32:42] about it brother adam said there was
[32:44] only one thing i like how he says this
[32:46] he says when i looked around i thought
[32:49] there's just one thing to do
[32:51] we've got to change this situation
[32:56] when i think of that that statement that
[32:58] is placed right there that makes you and
[33:01] i aware of that as a son and daughter of
[33:04] god
[33:05] that we've got access unto god this this
[33:09] faith this grace that paul said we now
[33:11] stand in to think in the midst of that
[33:14] time there's only one thing to do i've
[33:16] got to change this situation
[33:18] and it wasn't because well brother
[33:20] branham was the prophet of god that the
[33:22] situation will be changed
[33:24] but as a son of god here he stands as a
[33:27] husband and as a father there's a need
[33:31] in his home a need for peace the enemy
[33:34] has come in in situations that sometimes
[33:37] we could look at that would seem like
[33:40] how could that have been that seems
[33:42] harmless those seems like situations
[33:44] where people are wanting help but notice
[33:46] how it came in to where there was such a
[33:49] tension that was in the home to where
[33:51] sister meaty would tell him billy help
[33:54] me i'm about ready to go out of my mind
[34:00] i know we've heard this before
[34:02] but see brother branham he says
[34:04] he come to that place
[34:06] and he's asking god to help him
[34:09] in his heart he's saying god that you
[34:11] would help me and look how he says this
[34:14] lord you help me now
[34:16] to get upon me the holy spirit in such a
[34:21] way that will change
[34:23] this situation
[34:25] he's standing as a channel
[34:28] and he knows just as he's a channel
[34:30] standing there on the platform night
[34:32] after night a channel for god to come
[34:35] and deliver his word through to you and
[34:38] i right now he's got to be a channel for
[34:41] what's going on in his home let me just
[34:42] say something like this if every if only
[34:45] thing a person can be is a channel at
[34:47] church you're only half a christian
[34:51] i've got to just say it plain because
[34:54] this gospel walks in shoe leather
[34:58] this same gospel whatever the channel is
[35:01] here it's got to be the same channel at
[35:04] home we just should not be any different
[35:06] outside of church than what we are
[35:08] inside of church it shouldn't matter who
[35:11] we're around or where we're with we are
[35:13] always available to god
[35:17] here he stood as a channel in that time
[35:20] help me lord to get the holy spirit upon
[35:23] me in such a way what if brother branham
[35:25] would have been drawn out which would
[35:26] have been very easy for him to be when
[35:28] people walking around the house telling
[35:30] him all sorts of things like that thus
[35:32] saith the lord this and thus saith the
[35:34] lord that what if brother branham would
[35:36] it have got under his dander just for a
[35:38] little bit i'll tell you what this
[35:40] situation would have been different
[35:42] can't you see why the enemy at different
[35:44] times why he wants to come at us he
[35:46] wants to attack us even before you get
[35:48] home from your job even before you get
[35:51] into other situations even before you
[35:54] get to the house of god he wants things
[35:56] to come up what to do what hinder your
[35:59] life as a channel to where you become so
[36:02] twisted up hey come on this isn't beyond
[36:05] us elisha was a channel of god as a
[36:08] prophet of god but just because he was a
[36:10] prophet of god didn't mean he had a
[36:12] switch of off and on he knew the
[36:15] situation he was in he was a little bit
[36:17] upset and he needed a minstrel to come
[36:21] and minister to his situation brother
[36:24] branham was set in the back office and
[36:26] say my spirit is so nervous so tore up
[36:30] from everything that's going on today i
[36:32] needed that song service hearing those
[36:35] songs that were being sung why to get
[36:37] him into a place to where now as a
[36:41] channel that god could come down and
[36:44] speak and manifest himself in that
[36:47] service and that's the same way that's
[36:49] just not for a minister that's that's
[36:51] for every one of us how that the enemy
[36:54] that's why he battles the way that he
[36:56] does
[36:57] so to think of it in this in this way
[37:00] you know brother branham as he takes it
[37:01] and you know it isn't anything real
[37:03] spiritually says to her i'll just say it
[37:05] like this a bible study wouldn't have
[37:07] done it right now
[37:11] are you hearing me bible study wouldn't
[37:13] have done it with sister meaty right now
[37:15] she needed
[37:17] she needed the presence of god brought
[37:20] near to her
[37:21] that same message that was preached now
[37:24] come in contact and applied to that
[37:27] situation oh my the token is not
[37:30] something we talk about the token is not
[37:32] just an experience and then it doesn't
[37:35] apply to the rest of our life it is the
[37:37] experience of the holy ghost in our life
[37:40] that now it is applied to every
[37:43] situation
[37:46] amen as a channel of god's peace think
[37:49] of it how that brother man tells us he
[37:51] began to talk to her you know about
[37:53] about a blouse that he saw that don't
[37:55] seem very spiritual at all
[37:57] but you see what's happening it's not so
[37:59] much about the blouse
[38:03] brown makes this statement he kept
[38:05] talking to her
[38:07] now brother banham would have told her
[38:09] there ain't no reason to be upset
[38:11] you're a daughter of god your daughter
[38:13] of abraham no reason just come on snap
[38:15] out of it you wouldn't have worked
[38:19] you with me
[38:21] he's approaching the situation this is
[38:24] an example for you and i but you know
[38:26] what it is sometimes sometimes we don't
[38:28] want to take the time
[38:31] i'm just going to get right down on it
[38:33] sometimes we do you know it's incredible
[38:35] how people can just say well you just
[38:38] have faith but when they're in the
[38:39] situation tell them just to have faith
[38:43] oh i need cough syrup
[38:45] just have faith
[38:47] come on somebody it's amazing you know
[38:49] what it is it's a part of humanity
[38:52] that's wanting to try to handle the word
[38:54] instead of being a channel for the word
[38:57] to flow through my
[39:00] we are the situation we're dealing with
[39:02] we're talking about being sons and
[39:03] daughters of god not just commanding
[39:05] things out of our out of well i'm going
[39:07] to command this out of the home and
[39:09] command this out of the marriage no
[39:10] rebuke the wind but speak to the sea
[39:14] rebuke the wind that's coming and
[39:16] sometimes that rebuke it's not even in
[39:18] front of your family it's not in front
[39:21] of your wife it's there in prayer oh my
[39:23] where you're standing there in prayer
[39:25] and you see certain things that are
[39:27] wanting to come into the home maybe it's
[39:29] anxiousness maybe it's nervousness maybe
[39:31] it's other things and you stand right
[39:33] there in prayer and you rebuke that
[39:35] spirit in the name of the lord jesus
[39:37] christ but you speak to the son or
[39:40] daughter of god
[39:43] as a channel
[39:44] of god's peace
[39:46] and let's just be honest friends
[39:49] there's none of us that come into these
[39:50] things and we've got it all together
[39:54] we don't have it all together we're
[39:56] learning
[39:58] we're learning as we go along
[40:00] and there's situations within this time
[40:02] that there's always an understanding
[40:04] there's a growing there's a lit
[40:06] listening
[40:08] remember when we're looking at adam and
[40:10] eve and looking at the control that god
[40:13] had placed the authority in adam's life
[40:16] he was walking under the word of god and
[40:19] when eve could say ooh that wind
[40:22] adam would say wind be still
[40:26] he was addressing
[40:28] those needs
[40:30] that were right there
[40:33] brother brown said it like this he says
[40:34] i kept talking to her
[40:37] how many know sometimes you just have to
[40:38] keep talking
[40:40] sometimes it isn't even that particular
[40:42] situation where it unfolds right then
[40:44] and there sometimes you just got to keep
[40:45] talking
[40:47] is that right
[40:48] sometimes it's over the course it could
[40:50] be maybe there's been a situation in the
[40:53] home situation of family you got to keep
[40:56] talking
[40:57] but let me tell you something if you've
[40:59] got an avenue to where you can get to
[41:00] that place to where you can talk
[41:03] that's a good place to be because it's a
[41:06] place that god can work
[41:10] keep he kept talking to her
[41:13] changing what was he doing changing that
[41:16] atmosphere
[41:17] laying my hand
[41:19] on her
[41:20] brother bram said after a while she was
[41:22] all smiles
[41:24] and then there was peace in the home
[41:27] he said we've got to change the
[41:29] situation you know he says it's an
[41:31] atmosphere that counts and you make up
[41:33] that atmosphere
[41:35] with what you are
[41:37] inside of you
[41:38] brother braham says it this way
[41:39] concerning this event in another place
[41:42] in the message he says you know he said
[41:44] what i was doing
[41:46] i was projecting creating a different
[41:50] atmosphere
[41:51] walk in the love of god
[41:53] have fellowship
[41:55] that's very crucial right there
[41:59] walk in the love of god
[42:01] have
[42:02] fellowship
[42:04] because our authority it comes from god
[42:08] our strength in in every situation i can
[42:11] go back
[42:12] through through my life
[42:14] and through our lives
[42:17] i can remember a situation where my wife
[42:18] and i we had just very early on we had a
[42:21] miscarriage
[42:23] and i can remember the situation like
[42:25] i'm down in the i was down in the
[42:26] basement it was when it during the time
[42:28] of summer i'm down in the storage room
[42:31] where i would go and pray
[42:32] at different times and all of a sudden i
[42:35] remember as i come up out of that out of
[42:37] that basement or i was in the basement i
[42:39] began to hear
[42:40] this crying and
[42:42] it just it was different i heard my wife
[42:44] this was something that was different i
[42:45] recognized this is some something's
[42:47] going on here and i walked up the stairs
[42:51] and i went there and i began to and i
[42:54] heard her and she was
[42:55] of course you you could understand where
[42:57] she was at within it
[42:59] and at that moment in that time
[43:02] how god just began to minister and help
[43:04] us
[43:05] in that situation to everything that
[43:07] laid before us within that day and then
[43:10] on coming days so much that was involved
[43:12] with the spirit and your emotions and i
[43:14] i'm just going to say it say it like
[43:16] this there's things that i i i look at
[43:19] that and i say god i thank you for your
[43:22] grace that when that came about that i
[43:25] was there in prayer
[43:26] there was a strength that was given
[43:28] brother samuel aren't you always the son
[43:29] of god i am the son of god at all times
[43:31] sometimes we're in situations that when
[43:34] you can look at it that is not it's not
[43:36] something we're called out of prayer but
[43:38] this is where it comes down to paul said
[43:40] pray without ceasing
[43:43] is always is being in that place of
[43:46] prayer and walking in love in the love
[43:49] of god to walk in it is to let our lives
[43:52] be influenced by it to take that word in
[43:55] because it's not just about oh what
[43:57] situation's going to come up don't even
[43:59] look at it that way but understand as
[44:02] we're walking in the love of god there's
[44:03] a maturing there's a growing that's
[44:06] going on i think of how you know when
[44:08] brother wayne was here i think it was on
[44:10] sunday and he made a statement and then
[44:11] he just kept on moving but the word
[44:14] beholding beholding his face and when
[44:17] you look at to behold behold it's not
[44:19] just something where it's a quick glance
[44:21] but you looked into and you're beholding
[44:24] and as you behold the bible says we are
[44:27] changed from glory unto glory
[44:30] david said all that i would dwell in the
[44:33] house of the lord too behold his beauty
[44:37] so beholding him there is a changing and
[44:41] a maturing that's going on in our life
[44:45] and also preparing us no matter what
[44:48] situation comes we've got a refuge and a
[44:52] strength to face that situation
[44:58] mr bannon says here
[45:00] he said just after a few moments you
[45:03] know when sister media she finally
[45:04] started smiling and things like that he
[45:06] kept talking to her
[45:09] when she got quiet sarah and becky
[45:10] divided up the play blocks joseph got
[45:13] him something to play with and there was
[45:14] peace in the home
[45:16] what was it projecting
[45:19] love
[45:20] they were mine my children my wife and i
[45:24] was god
[45:25] and then god giving his spirit and
[45:29] through that spirit with love to my
[45:32] family sovereign grace came in
[45:35] and quietened
[45:36] the family
[45:38] he was standing there as a son of god a
[45:41] channel and god was able to come down
[45:45] notice he says his spirit came with love
[45:49] for my family
[45:51] remember love is part love
[45:53] love also has understanding
[45:57] and understanding doesn't mean knowledge
[46:00] so much but understanding is that which
[46:03] looks at something and says i may not
[46:05] understand it here but i understand this
[46:08] is a need this is a situation for this
[46:12] person or for this individual and you're
[46:14] standing there as a channel for god to
[46:17] come on the scene
[46:19] second thessalonians 3 16 the bible says
[46:23] the lord of peace himself give you peace
[46:27] always
[46:28] by all means
[46:32] the lord be with you
[46:34] all
[46:36] how many believe that and knows that god
[46:38] gives peace
[46:39] always
[46:41] no matter the circumstances
[46:43] no matter the situations
[46:46] god gives peace and the peace we're
[46:48] talking about is that peace that comes
[46:51] from the kingdom of god
[46:53] not the peace that's from this world
[46:56] because that's not a true that's not
[46:58] godly peace it's not a true peace it's a
[47:02] peace that actually is bondage that
[47:05] leads to strife
[47:07] it doesn't bring a settledness
[47:09] but god's peace that issues in in the
[47:12] midst of a situation it comes i think
[47:15] about says it in the amplified bible it
[47:18] says that at all times and in all ways
[47:22] under all circumstances and conditions
[47:25] whatever comes the lord be with you all
[47:30] what a comfort
[47:32] what a reality that within that no
[47:34] matter what circumstances come no matter
[47:37] what conditions arise the lord of peace
[47:40] is right there to give us peace in our
[47:44] lives
[47:45] here's what david would write under
[47:47] inspiration in psalms 147 verse 14
[47:51] he maketh peace in thy borders
[47:55] he maketh peace he's the one that gives
[47:58] peace
[48:00] to our life
[48:01] and to our home
[48:04] in john chapter 10 verse 9 jesus said i
[48:08] am the door
[48:09] and by me if any man enter in he shall
[48:12] be saved and shall go in and out and
[48:14] find pasture
[48:16] the thief cometh not but for to steal
[48:19] and to kill and to destroy but i am come
[48:23] that they might have life and that they
[48:25] might have it more abundantly
[48:28] i believe this is this is a checkpoint
[48:31] for everything that even that we would
[48:34] entertain or or take in in our life if
[48:37] it can't come through and by the door
[48:42] then we don't accept it
[48:44] if it can't pass through the door we
[48:47] don't accept it
[48:48] satan's avenue let me say this as the
[48:51] scripture said satan will come in every
[48:54] other avenue and when he comes some
[48:56] other way you already know it is not the
[49:00] chief shepherd this is a thief and a
[49:04] robber because jesus himself said i am
[49:08] the door
[49:09] and what god gives to you and i it
[49:12] doesn't take peace from us
[49:14] but it gives peace to us it increases
[49:17] peace in our life he said i'm come that
[49:19] you might have life and have it beyond
[49:21] imagination beyond the bible said what
[49:24] you can even imagine
[49:27] so to think within our lives you know
[49:29] brother adam will continue to pick this
[49:31] this thought up of how that things would
[49:33] come about in our life where he said
[49:35] sometimes he said family would try to
[49:37] fuss at you and is your life worthy of
[49:39] the gospel and he says but don't fuss
[49:41] back at him
[49:42] he said instead just let him know i'm
[49:45] going to be praying for you
[49:47] he said but rather be full of love
[49:52] let me tell you there is one feeling but
[49:54] many refillings
[49:56] jude would write to the church of the
[49:58] living god and say
[50:00] that we are to keep ourselves in the
[50:03] love of god
[50:05] looking to the coming of the lord
[50:08] and so in ourselves
[50:11] we are a little creator
[50:13] we create an atmosphere
[50:15] we create that atmosphere brother ram
[50:17] tells us by the life that we live the
[50:19] way we talk and their conversations
[50:22] uh you you know whether it's with people
[50:25] at work or even in your home
[50:28] if you start getting a little bit
[50:29] negative start getting a little critical
[50:32] you know there's an atmosphere that
[50:33] changes in your home
[50:36] and maybe your criticism really has
[50:38] nothing to do with your husband your
[50:39] wife maybe there's been some events
[50:41] through the day or certain things that
[50:44] you started thinking on and dwelling on
[50:46] and it starts affecting you
[50:49] it starts coming into your spirit it's
[50:51] right there and then it starts affecting
[50:53] even the way that you respond to
[50:55] different things let me just say this to
[50:57] you it really doesn't matter all the
[50:59] words that could be said spirits will
[51:01] travel on words
[51:04] it'll cause an atmosphere to come into
[51:06] that home
[51:07] you might say brother samuel i am a
[51:10] believer but remember
[51:12] that in our lives it it comes to a place
[51:15] that we must have our lives continually
[51:18] into the word and being washed by the
[51:21] water of the word
[51:23] you know as brother brahman says we
[51:25] create an atmosphere by the life we live
[51:27] the way we talk in our conversations and
[51:30] he says you know there's times he said
[51:32] where you you see people and you think
[51:33] oh no here they come they're going to be
[51:35] criticizing somebody or you know here
[51:37] comes somebody else and all they do is
[51:39] you know they they they tell certain
[51:41] dirty jokes and things like that and you
[51:42] turn away from them
[51:44] right
[51:45] because you realize what kind of
[51:46] atmosphere they're going to bring i
[51:48] worked with people that way you know oh
[51:50] here they come
[51:51] they're going to be running down the
[51:52] boss
[51:53] they're going to be doing this i mean
[51:55] you can even have it listen let's not
[51:56] just leave it out there it can be right
[51:58] even in church
[52:00] you're going to have people and you
[52:01] realize oh i mean they're going to talk
[52:03] about somebody
[52:05] they're going to say this about
[52:07] something i'll say this but you see we
[52:09] recognize that creates an atmosphere
[52:11] that's not an atmosphere that allows
[52:14] really for the peace of god or for
[52:17] growth to come about
[52:19] think about it he says the things that
[52:21] you think on the things that you do the
[52:24] actions the things you talk about
[52:26] creates an atmosphere the things you
[52:28] think about
[52:30] things you talk about
[52:31] the bible says in isaiah chapter 26
[52:34] verse 3
[52:35] thou will keep him
[52:38] in perfect peace
[52:40] whose mind
[52:41] is stayed on thee
[52:44] because he trusteth
[52:46] in thee
[52:48] this is god's promise
[52:50] i'll keep him in a state of perfect
[52:52] peace
[52:53] whose mind has stayed on me let me just
[52:55] give you a little background on this
[52:56] scripture
[52:58] this scripture has to deal with
[53:00] when israel receives her visitation from
[53:03] god
[53:05] when the when the two witnesses are
[53:07] standing there and ministering the
[53:10] baptism of the holy ghost jerusalem is
[53:13] being encompassed in that time
[53:16] but yet the presence of god coming in
[53:19] the midst and gathering that 144 000
[53:23] unto himself it stabilizes them in the
[53:27] midst of that hour
[53:29] just as his presence has stabilized the
[53:32] bride in psalms 27.
[53:35] the host should encamp round about me
[53:39] but in this will i be confident
[53:42] this because situations and and things
[53:45] all around but to think god's promise is
[53:49] thou will keep him in perfect peace
[53:51] whose mind is stayed on thee
[53:54] because he trusteth
[53:57] in thee
[53:58] what kind of words that in the amplified
[53:59] bible says you will guard him and keep
[54:02] him in perfect and constant peace
[54:05] whose mind both his inclination and its
[54:08] character is stayed on you because he
[54:12] commits himself to you leans on you and
[54:15] hopes confidently
[54:17] in you
[54:20] let me just let me just move down here
[54:22] just over a few things to get to this
[54:24] point here
[54:26] you know
[54:29] brother brown talks to us in different
[54:31] places in the message and he'll speak of
[54:33] how brother wayne mentioned it one of
[54:35] the nights but
[54:36] looking back on this from some weeks ago
[54:38] and
[54:39] how that brother bamwood would speak to
[54:42] us in different places of the message of
[54:43] how
[54:44] that you know franklin discovered
[54:46] electricity
[54:48] but edison got a hold of it and edison
[54:50] said
[54:51] i believe this electricity will work for
[54:54] us
[54:55] it'll it'll benefit us
[54:57] brother branham would pick it up like
[54:59] this and he would say
[55:00] the same power of god
[55:03] that has raised us
[55:05] from a sinner
[55:07] to a child of god
[55:09] that same power he said will work in our
[55:12] life for many
[55:14] different things
[55:17] if we'll only
[55:19] allow him to
[55:20] you see everything god knows the things
[55:22] that you and i
[55:24] would be faced with god knew things that
[55:27] would come about even laying before us
[55:29] and remember
[55:30] tests and trials are not our enemy
[55:34] somebody said lord help me help me
[55:36] they're not our enemy
[55:37] yet the tests and trials that come our
[55:39] way are times of molding let me just say
[55:42] this a test and trial it's not just
[55:45] something
[55:46] you know sometimes that we look at that
[55:48] you know it's just something out here
[55:50] but sometimes a test and trial is even
[55:53] where there's expression that maybe
[55:55] you've been hurt someone said something
[55:57] a certain way and it hasn't been
[55:59] somebody in the world it's been from
[56:01] another believer or been from somebody
[56:03] else right around are you hearing me
[56:06] it's been right right around that way
[56:07] you know i think of one
[56:11] and this comes to me
[56:13] i gotta tell it i was talking to brother
[56:15] homer here a few weeks ago and brother
[56:17] homer said you know he said i know he
[56:19] said i really can't preach he said and
[56:21] he was just talking about things he said
[56:23] but i'll tell you what he said now my
[56:24] wife he said i got up and preached at a
[56:26] man's church he said and the brother had
[56:28] invited me and he said he told me he
[56:30] said you know homer he said you really
[56:32] can't preach he said but every time he
[56:34] said you minister he said god comes and
[56:36] helps the people
[56:40] brother homer said no that didn't bother
[56:42] me he said because i already know i
[56:43] can't preach he said but for my wife
[56:46] that was another story
[56:49] so sometimes in those in situations of
[56:52] of how that we're we're looking at
[56:54] things how things can work in such a a
[56:57] different way sometimes and sometimes
[56:59] when things come at us remember
[57:02] you know we're so full of forgiveness
[57:04] when nobody's offended us
[57:07] i mean every it's easy to forgive when
[57:09] there's nobody to forgive
[57:11] right
[57:12] i mean it's easy to if any man have a
[57:14] quarrel let him well there's no problem
[57:17] i don't have no quarrels but you see
[57:19] when there's things that arise like that
[57:21] that require us
[57:23] that requires something greater than
[57:25] ourselves and listen as a child of god
[57:28] you do not want the things of the world
[57:31] and those things i'm talking about even
[57:33] thoughts to entertain or to rest in your
[57:36] life because it isn't so much about the
[57:38] other person it's about your walk with
[57:41] god
[57:42] and listen it matters what we think and
[57:45] what we entertain and the things that we
[57:48] think in satan's objective is always to
[57:51] try to hinder that channel and that flow
[57:54] in our life
[57:57] and i want you to think of this here
[57:58] brother brown says if we can just
[58:01] study he says like i have water here
[58:04] and i know i need crops watered over
[58:06] there
[58:09] now what if i had somebody brother bill
[58:11] you had a well
[58:12] and you needed to water crops
[58:14] now what if you came and said let's say
[58:16] i need to get these crops watered
[58:20] and i sat down with you and i told you
[58:22] and said well let's look at the land you
[58:24] know to survey the land
[58:26] you've got to kind of look at it a
[58:27] little bit
[58:31] sorry the earth ain't flat
[58:35] you got to kind of look at it a little
[58:37] bit and you got to find out because
[58:39] there's laws
[58:41] and if you can find those laws laws of
[58:43] gravity you notice you spill water on
[58:45] the table it'll find the lowest point
[58:48] right but you've got to find how the
[58:51] channel of those laws to it'll take that
[58:54] water to that up to that field
[58:56] now brother bill we can sit there and
[58:58] brother bill's like come on brother
[58:59] samuel come on come on come on come on
[59:00] come on come on come on come on come on
[59:02] i said wait a minute we got to look at
[59:03] this land a little bit
[59:05] we got to survey it
[59:07] because
[59:08] we've got to find how that that water
[59:11] will flow on its own and get it there
[59:15] we might have to dig a little bit here
[59:17] clear out an obstacle there but remember
[59:20] it's not us that's going to transport
[59:22] the water from there to there
[59:26] all we have to do is look for that
[59:28] channel that it'll flow through and if
[59:30] there's anything in the way get it out
[59:32] of the way so the water can get from
[59:35] there to there
[59:39] now it don't matter how much i tell
[59:41] brother bill there if brother bill comes
[59:43] back the next day first time to tell me
[59:44] how to get this
[59:48] you know what it is
[59:49] he's not wanting to do it
[59:53] because the channel is being made known
[59:55] you got to clear out a little bit of
[59:56] this
[59:57] sometimes the things that we got to
[59:58] clear out and we're wanting the spirit
[1:00:00] of god to come into a situation it don't
[1:00:03] have nothing to do with the water no
[1:00:05] problem with the holy ghost in every
[1:00:08] situation it's a lot of things to do
[1:00:10] with ourselves
[1:00:13] are you with me when brother branham was
[1:00:14] standing there in his home brother
[1:00:16] branham could allowed himself to be a
[1:00:18] hindrance but instead it was a channel
[1:00:21] and he asked god help me to be a channel
[1:00:25] in my home help me to be a channel that
[1:00:27] the holy ghost can come upon me to
[1:00:29] quieten her to settle her to bring her
[1:00:32] back into that place of peace what did
[1:00:34] brother banham have to do
[1:00:35] he put on an apron
[1:00:38] he began to put his hand on her back
[1:00:39] begin to talk to her
[1:00:41] begin to speak about things here was a
[1:00:43] man that spoke deep mysteries
[1:00:46] are you with me it was a channel that
[1:00:49] god used
[1:00:51] in this hour to speak
[1:00:53] profound
[1:00:55] mysteries to you and i
[1:00:58] and in the midst of this time here he is
[1:01:00] a channel clearing things out
[1:01:02] so the holy spirit can minister to his
[1:01:05] wife it wouldn't have mattered how much
[1:01:07] brother what brother brown could have
[1:01:08] done
[1:01:09] it still had to be the holy ghost
[1:01:11] to come on the scene
[1:01:13] i'll tell you for every situation in our
[1:01:15] life in our homes we need the holy ghost
[1:01:18] that's why every home is to have the
[1:01:20] token applied in your life as a husband
[1:01:23] as a wife and over that home and
[1:01:25] everything you do you apply the token if
[1:01:28] you can't do it with the token applied
[1:01:30] don't do it
[1:01:32] because it'll only bring bondage it'll
[1:01:34] only bring a hindrance
[1:01:36] and it'll cause that channel to be all
[1:01:38] plugged up
[1:01:41] samuel that's pretty simple but a lot of
[1:01:43] times it's a little simple things that
[1:01:45] we overlook and we wonder why where
[1:01:47] where is the supply where is the water
[1:01:49] going nothing wrong with the water
[1:01:52] sometimes it's the channel
[1:01:55] you know brother branham tells us
[1:01:58] we get to looking at
[1:02:00] we talk about the right approach he said
[1:02:01] if you just get the right approach to it
[1:02:04] brother brown tells us like this and
[1:02:06] greatest battle ever fought spoken words
[1:02:08] original seed
[1:02:10] and he speaks of taking in the word of
[1:02:12] god into our life
[1:02:15] and he said it's not
[1:02:17] it's not positive thinking
[1:02:20] it's the word of god
[1:02:23] it's a take in the word and you know i
[1:02:25] want you to think about how many times
[1:02:27] that we've maybe you're here tonight how
[1:02:29] many times we've come into situations
[1:02:32] we come into the house of god and we say
[1:02:33] lord i need a move
[1:02:36] i need you to speak to me tonight
[1:02:38] i i need you to speak personally to my
[1:02:41] life in a very personal way
[1:02:43] and god will come down and god will
[1:02:45] minister he'll speak to our life see
[1:02:48] when you're expecting and you're open
[1:02:50] and saying god i need you to come lord
[1:02:52] and to speak to me
[1:02:54] he'll come and speak to your life he'll
[1:02:56] come and speak very personally to your
[1:02:58] life and at that time it's time to take
[1:03:00] that word take it into your mind
[1:03:04] so take it into your mind because it's
[1:03:06] the word that has life into it and when
[1:03:08] it comes down in here it brings
[1:03:11] life
[1:03:13] sometimes it sometimes we don't we know
[1:03:15] this as believers we don't see results
[1:03:17] like this
[1:03:18] and sometimes because we don't see
[1:03:19] results then we then we wonder and say
[1:03:21] well you know lord what do i do in this
[1:03:23] you gotta you have to take the word
[1:03:25] that's been given and act upon it
[1:03:28] believing it and watering it
[1:03:33] that's the same thing when you're
[1:03:34] if you come for prayer you listen
[1:03:37] there's there's no man whether it's
[1:03:38] myself whether it's any other minister
[1:03:40] no man is going to stand right here and
[1:03:42] oh my that brother's gonna pray for me
[1:03:44] and this is all gonna no it's our faith
[1:03:48] in the word of god that's a finished
[1:03:50] work
[1:03:53] if we're looking at that that's the
[1:03:54] wrong approach it comes down to this is
[1:03:57] god's word we're following his word
[1:04:00] we're going to stand on his word and we
[1:04:02] look at it and say lord if there's
[1:04:04] anything in me and oh brother samuel if
[1:04:07] there's anything in me but do we really
[1:04:09] believe that sometimes
[1:04:12] we look at ourselves like oh my really
[1:04:14] brother samuel is there anything in me
[1:04:15] we'll say oh god if there's anything in
[1:04:17] me but really what if god says yeah
[1:04:20] there is
[1:04:22] lord me
[1:04:24] me lord
[1:04:27] you see how much do we because listen
[1:04:30] friends when we're looking at times even
[1:04:32] in situations and in things that come
[1:04:34] about troubling of things that comes
[1:04:36] about even in a way it becomes to
[1:04:39] evaluation in our life brother braham
[1:04:41] says examine your life by the word
[1:04:43] that's not going into some sort of
[1:04:45] purgatory or some sort of pittance but
[1:04:48] it's examining our life by the word and
[1:04:51] saying god if there's something that's
[1:04:53] out of line let it be lined up with you
[1:04:56] lord jesus
[1:04:57] because we know we need him
[1:05:01] oh my this is why the bible says submit
[1:05:04] yourselves therefore to god and resist
[1:05:07] the devil and he will flee from you
[1:05:12] but his very key part that verse submit
[1:05:14] yourselves that's the first thing
[1:05:17] submit is to yield
[1:05:20] and then resist him
[1:05:23] draw nine to god
[1:05:25] and he'll draw nine to you
[1:05:27] brother brown takes that that that
[1:05:29] particular phrase over and over through
[1:05:31] the message
[1:05:33] brother bram says in our lives he says
[1:05:36] if we could just walk
[1:05:38] in the spirit
[1:05:40] more like we should
[1:05:43] and he takes us to luke 24 when they
[1:05:45] were clopius
[1:05:46] and a friend were walking
[1:05:48] the rest of they were speaking
[1:05:51] and talking
[1:05:52] and thinking about jesus
[1:05:55] and what did it do it invited him
[1:05:59] out from
[1:06:02] shadows and types and he drew near to
[1:06:05] them
[1:06:06] because there was an atmosphere
[1:06:08] that they were in talking
[1:06:11] thinking about him you say by the same
[1:06:13] listen
[1:06:14] the bible said they were sad
[1:06:16] in their communications
[1:06:20] but in the midst of their sadness
[1:06:23] they were still talking about him
[1:06:28] they were talking about him they were
[1:06:30] thinking about the events they didn't
[1:06:31] understand what had taken place
[1:06:33] but they were thinking upon those things
[1:06:37] and he drew near
[1:06:40] that's why brother braham says in a
[1:06:41] service now i think about this not just
[1:06:43] in a service but what about in every
[1:06:47] in our everyday life
[1:06:49] keep your mind
[1:06:51] centered
[1:06:53] on him
[1:06:55] and let's just be honest
[1:06:57] our minds are bombarded
[1:06:59] every which way
[1:07:04] there's things that come all the time
[1:07:07] to try to take your peace
[1:07:10] there's things that you you that look
[1:07:13] that even in this past
[1:07:16] year year and a half i i don't know
[1:07:19] but of things that
[1:07:21] i mean i don't know if anybody has any
[1:07:24] confidence in the media anymore i don't
[1:07:25] know
[1:07:27] but you understand
[1:07:28] i i don't i'm just being honest i don't
[1:07:29] waste my time with it
[1:07:32] but i just
[1:07:33] it's amazing of the things that
[1:07:35] sometimes that is said
[1:07:37] and things that are put out there on the
[1:07:39] headline
[1:07:40] if you just read the headline you read
[1:07:42] the first little bit or if you just read
[1:07:44] one particular story and you don't read
[1:07:46] the other perspective the other part not
[1:07:48] just the perspective but other facts
[1:07:50] about it let me give you an example
[1:07:52] here is here is a headline about here's
[1:07:55] a young boy goes to disneyland he's
[1:07:57] vaccinated
[1:07:58] he passes away
[1:08:00] but the other side of the story that's
[1:08:02] not told is that this young boy is
[1:08:04] terminal cancer
[1:08:07] you see satan is a master of propaganda
[1:08:13] you understand me i'm gonna talk about
[1:08:14] conspiracy theories i'm talking about
[1:08:15] that even in the midst of this hour what
[1:08:17] about that man that stood in his his
[1:08:20] wife's room he looked at the monitor
[1:08:24] that monitor wasn't fake news
[1:08:27] are you hearing me it wasn't fake news
[1:08:29] that monitor right there he was speaking
[1:08:31] things that was going on with his wife
[1:08:33] but he chose to look at a different
[1:08:36] report
[1:08:39] when caleb and joshua came back they
[1:08:41] never came back and said these guys are
[1:08:44] a bunch of liars
[1:08:45] there ain't giants over there they never
[1:08:47] said that
[1:08:48] but you can't find one place in the
[1:08:50] scripture that joshua and caleb focused
[1:08:53] on the giants
[1:08:55] that was not what dominated their tents
[1:08:59] the rest of them look what was going on
[1:09:01] in their tents they were talking about
[1:09:03] the giants how impossible it was
[1:09:05] everything was going on look what was
[1:09:07] going on in their tents wailing and
[1:09:10] weeping and but not in joshua and
[1:09:12] caleb's tent
[1:09:14] joshua and caleb said wait a minute god
[1:09:16] has brought us here to this hour and
[1:09:18] this is where we're standing the same
[1:09:20] god that brought us here is the same god
[1:09:22] that will take us the rest away it's
[1:09:25] focusing on the god who is present
[1:09:29] he stabilizes our life
[1:09:33] i'm not talking about you understand
[1:09:34] about being in a hole but brother braham
[1:09:36] says we got our mind upon so much other
[1:09:38] stuff
[1:09:40] he said we got so much our mind up on
[1:09:42] business deals minds he set upon the
[1:09:44] newest soap detergent the newest this
[1:09:47] and the newest biss and i could just add
[1:09:49] into that the newest iphone the newest
[1:09:51] this and the newest that and there's not
[1:09:53] things there's sometimes where there's
[1:09:54] things that we have to be focused upon
[1:09:57] but then there's other times we have to
[1:09:58] realize that wait a minute here
[1:10:00] this right here is troubling
[1:10:04] my life
[1:10:07] it's taking peace
[1:10:09] away from my life
[1:10:11] things you begin to speak on
[1:10:14] and talk on you know how it is there can
[1:10:16] be real problems at work
[1:10:18] but it's how much you talk about it
[1:10:20] there's got to be a time where you cut
[1:10:21] it and say that's enough
[1:10:23] but samuel that's real practical you can
[1:10:25] put that in your lunchbox though
[1:10:27] it's wisdom on how when things are going
[1:10:29] on even within the home
[1:10:32] because we want our lives we want an
[1:10:34] atmosphere where the holy spirit
[1:10:37] is invited
[1:10:38] he's free to move
[1:10:41] is that right
[1:10:42] this is where we want to keep our minds
[1:10:44] centered on him let's just
[1:10:46] let's just close
[1:10:51] let me just close with this this one
[1:10:52] right here
[1:10:55] brother brown says just keep him on your
[1:10:57] mind
[1:10:58] keep thinking about him
[1:11:00] how lovely he is
[1:11:02] how sweet he is
[1:11:03] of his promises
[1:11:05] if you get sick
[1:11:07] get this on your mind he was wounded for
[1:11:10] my transgressions he was bruised from my
[1:11:13] iniquity the chastisement of my peace
[1:11:15] was upon him and with his stripes
[1:11:18] i was healed
[1:11:20] keep your mind
[1:11:22] centered
[1:11:23] like that
[1:11:25] see god what this is not god's duty
[1:11:28] this is our duty
[1:11:31] keep your mind centered
[1:11:33] like that
[1:11:35] something look at this will happen to
[1:11:37] you
[1:11:38] something will draw nigh to you an
[1:11:41] anointing
[1:11:43] will come on you
[1:11:45] and out of that chair
[1:11:47] you'll go
[1:11:49] draw nigh to god
[1:11:51] and he'll draw nigh unto you
[1:11:55] i'm not telling you not to read the news
[1:11:58] not to look at it but i think you know
[1:12:00] exactly what the holy spirit has said
[1:12:02] here
[1:12:03] you things that you give yourself to
[1:12:06] if things are troubling you
[1:12:08] you need to get away from it
[1:12:11] if it's hindering your faith get away
[1:12:13] from it
[1:12:14] things that you give yourself to it's
[1:12:16] what you focus on
[1:12:18] that hinders it can either invite the
[1:12:20] peace of god or to hinder the peace of
[1:12:23] god in your life
[1:12:26] and i say oh god what what we have been
[1:12:28] given in this hour how
[1:12:31] when i when i say the message that god
[1:12:33] has given us i'm talking about the
[1:12:35] person of jesus christ
[1:12:37] that is right here
[1:12:39] in the ship
[1:12:42] and brother brahm said that same god
[1:12:44] who was over the wind over the sea
[1:12:47] he said isn't he the same god
[1:12:49] that can take over this dirt
[1:12:53] this body
[1:12:54] no matter what situation it is
[1:12:57] he's still
[1:12:59] the lord of all peace
[1:13:04] i'm glad for that tonight i'm glad to be
[1:13:06] a witness of that tonight
[1:13:09] glad to be a channel
[1:13:10] that the peace of god and i said god
[1:13:13] help me to stay a channel
[1:13:15] that that atmosphere can move move
[1:13:18] through can flow and if there's anything
[1:13:20] that's in the way help me to clear it
[1:13:22] out of the way
[1:13:23] help me to clear it out of the way
[1:13:25] you know the bible says
[1:13:27] live live peaceably
[1:13:29] with all men as much as lies within you
[1:13:32] is that right
[1:13:34] but it also doesn't mean we compromise
[1:13:37] for peace
[1:13:38] because peace is never gained by
[1:13:39] compromise
[1:13:41] there's sometimes there's things
[1:13:43] where you just simply on your job or in
[1:13:45] other situations you have to just let it
[1:13:47] go
[1:13:50] for what for the sake of peace
[1:13:54] is that right
[1:13:56] or sometimes
[1:13:58] we're finding out who's right really
[1:14:00] isn't
[1:14:02] the necessary part
[1:14:05] it's just simply to recognize
[1:14:07] we want peace
[1:14:10] we want peace
[1:14:12] let's go on amen you love him amen
[1:14:16] let's pray
[1:14:19] lord jesus
[1:14:24] lord i i thank o god as your prophet
[1:14:27] would describe this age that we live in
[1:14:31] and he would write of it lord in this
[1:14:33] manner
[1:14:35] an age
[1:14:37] unfit
[1:14:39] for human beings to live in with nervous
[1:14:42] tensions
[1:14:44] pressures
[1:14:48] lord we see here tonight
[1:14:53] just even an example lord that we looked
[1:14:55] into the prophet's home
[1:14:59] we've seen these things lord maybe not
[1:15:01] the exact same circumstances
[1:15:06] or cause
[1:15:08] we we can see this lord that
[1:15:12] how that satan desires in very subtle
[1:15:14] ways
[1:15:16] to try to take peace away
[1:15:19] from our lives lord
[1:15:22] may we oh god i pray just
[1:15:25] just drawing from the admonition of the
[1:15:27] holy spirit tonight
[1:15:29] the lord if there's if there's one here
[1:15:33] that would be listening that that
[1:15:34] doesn't know you lord
[1:15:37] in that way where there's a real peace
[1:15:39] on the inside
[1:15:41] in their soul
[1:15:44] may they just reach out to you tonight
[1:15:46] lord
[1:15:48] just a lord
[1:15:50] to lay hold
[1:15:54] upon
[1:15:55] the very one who's speaking to their
[1:15:57] heart
[1:15:59] to let them know that
[1:16:02] i'm your peace
[1:16:04] i can settle i'll bring a settling to
[1:16:06] your life a quietness
[1:16:10] where there's a rest
[1:16:13] to relieve the weary and the
[1:16:15] labor and the heavy load of sin
[1:16:18] [Music]
[1:16:20] grant that tonight
[1:16:24] and i know tonight lord that
[1:16:27] i'm speaking to hearts
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:31] that can
[1:16:32] relate but also lord know
[1:16:37] just how
[1:16:39] how important lord in this direction
[1:16:41] that you
[1:16:43] would give us lord
[1:16:44] through your word
[1:16:47] being channels of peace oh god
[1:16:50] that the very things that we would think
[1:16:52] on
[1:16:53] i think it lord
[1:16:55] to be very fitting how
[1:16:57] you would instruct joshua
[1:16:59] meditate
[1:17:03] meditate on the word of god
[1:17:06] psalms 1 would write of a blessed man
[1:17:10] one who's not caught up in the seat of
[1:17:12] the scornful
[1:17:14] but his delight is in the law of the
[1:17:16] lord
[1:17:18] david would write in another place great
[1:17:21] great peace have they that loved thy law
[1:17:24] oh lord
[1:17:27] oh god
[1:17:30] if there ever is a time ever a moment
[1:17:33] that
[1:17:34] we can recognize as the children of god
[1:17:38] that there's one place lord that we can
[1:17:40] draw peace from
[1:17:43] that's from you lord
[1:17:45] that in the midst of a
[1:17:48] of situations and things that come about
[1:17:50] because blessed are the peacemakers
[1:17:53] this word as it deals with makers and
[1:17:56] maintainers of peace
[1:17:59] sometimes lord
[1:18:01] it's working to maintain the peace
[1:18:05] and that direction of what you've given
[1:18:08] in our home
[1:18:09] and in our
[1:18:10] life we learn how to go about certain
[1:18:14] things
[1:18:15] i think of it on the job sometimes lord
[1:18:17] as people will learn on the job and you
[1:18:19] learn in your home
[1:18:22] you learn certain things that will
[1:18:25] just causes things to run a little bit
[1:18:27] more smoother
[1:18:28] it just helps things along the way
[1:18:33] oh god
[1:18:35] help us lord because there's one
[1:18:36] objective that we have lord
[1:18:40] and that's to see you glorified
[1:18:43] lord we're only passing through this
[1:18:44] life this is the this is the shortest
[1:18:47] span of time
[1:18:50] we're only here for just but a moment
[1:18:52] jane james called it lord a vapor
[1:18:57] it's so brief
[1:18:59] that on a tombstone they just put a dash
[1:19:05] but help us god that for every moment
[1:19:08] lord that we're here
[1:19:10] this is our desire we may not be known
[1:19:14] for anything else we may not be known
[1:19:18] lord for
[1:19:19] this one prayed for me or that but what
[1:19:22] we're known as
[1:19:24] as a child of god
[1:19:27] blessed
[1:19:29] are the peacemakers
[1:19:34] lord you spoke to us so clearly we
[1:19:35] realize that doesn't mean going along
[1:19:37] with sin
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:40] but god how did you give us
[1:19:42] a witness and a direction
[1:19:44] i think of how the prophet stood there
[1:19:47] we heard it again this weekend and he
[1:19:49] spoke to that infidel now he never came
[1:19:51] out and rebuked that infidel for being
[1:19:53] an infidel
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:56] he did say at that moment he said well
[1:19:58] nothing to be too proud of
[1:20:00] but he addressed
[1:20:02] the situation
[1:20:04] that was present lord
[1:20:07] help us lord to operate in that
[1:20:10] discernment
[1:20:13] to rebuke the wind
[1:20:15] but to speak peace to the sea
[1:20:20] that storm that would want to come and
[1:20:22] lord trouble and try to trouble in our
[1:20:25] home may we stand lord may husbands may
[1:20:27] men of god
[1:20:29] daughters of god wives mothers fathers
[1:20:32] lord
[1:20:33] standing o god in the midst of that time
[1:20:36] when things want to encroach
[1:20:38] maybe it's lord upon loved ones they're
[1:20:40] not even under the roof anymore but they
[1:20:43] can stand there as a son and daughter of
[1:20:45] god and say satan
[1:20:47] take your hands off of them
[1:20:49] [Music]
[1:20:50] i've already claimed them over here
[1:20:56] lord loosen every band upon their life
[1:20:59] cause them to turn
[1:21:02] to you lord
[1:21:05] grant it lord i believe that with all my
[1:21:07] heart lord
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:10] give us grace lord
[1:21:12] and favor lord
[1:21:14] to be able to speak lord to that sea to
[1:21:17] be able to minister lord to that spirit
[1:21:20] that's under the effect of god from a
[1:21:23] strong storm of wind lord
[1:21:26] like sister meaty's spirit was so
[1:21:29] torn
[1:21:31] the children lord
[1:21:33] were reeling under the effects of that
[1:21:35] but god
[1:21:37] here was a son of god
[1:21:40] that took dominion
[1:21:42] in his home
[1:21:45] and he did it by the word
[1:21:48] he never went around and told little
[1:21:50] joseph now you stopped doing this
[1:21:52] becky and sarah you stop no
[1:21:55] change the atmosphere
[1:21:58] and when the atmosphere was changed
[1:22:02] how everything itself took right in
[1:22:04] order playing begin to resume the right
[1:22:06] way
[1:22:08] god you're interested in every part of
[1:22:10] our life
[1:22:12] and i pray father
[1:22:15] for each need lord and for every life
[1:22:18] as it's gathered here
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:21] we just want to receive that lord right
[1:22:23] here tonight
[1:22:26] if there's a lord a life that's here a
[1:22:28] heart
[1:22:29] we all stand there many times lord that
[1:22:32] lord how do i get the water from here to
[1:22:34] down there
[1:22:36] may you just come lord
[1:22:39] direct us in the right approach that we
[1:22:40] can get the water
[1:22:42] from the well
[1:22:44] to the field lord we pray
[1:22:47] you've given us your word lord in this
[1:22:49] hour
[1:22:50] get it into that place lord that we can
[1:22:53] see these
[1:22:56] these places lord
[1:22:59] help us lord i pray
[1:23:02] help your children in jesus name
[1:23:09] you know the bible says in the book of
[1:23:11] philippians
[1:23:13] be careful for nothing
[1:23:14] [Music]
[1:23:18] but it said with prayer
[1:23:21] and supplication
[1:23:23] with
[1:23:25] thanksgiving
[1:23:27] let your requests be known unto god
[1:23:32] and the peace of god shall keep your
[1:23:35] hearts
[1:23:36] and your minds
[1:23:37] through christ jesus
[1:23:40] then paul would go on to think on
[1:23:42] certain things now to think of that
[1:23:45] you know prayer and supplication
[1:23:49] it's actually two parts you enter into
[1:23:50] prayer first of all
[1:23:53] just worshiping him
[1:23:57] prayer is really not about even it's not
[1:23:59] about requests prayer is about just
[1:24:00] entering in just starting to worship
[1:24:02] just worshiping brother braham says you
[1:24:04] enter into prayer you just begin to
[1:24:05] worship him lord jesus
[1:24:07] i love you
[1:24:09] lord you're so wonderful
[1:24:11] and he said you'll find you begin to
[1:24:12] worship him his presence will draw nigh
[1:24:16] then you find
[1:24:17] after you've had that that time of just
[1:24:19] worshiping then you let your
[1:24:21] supplications
[1:24:22] which are your requests
[1:24:24] to be made known
[1:24:26] you find those pair of prayer and
[1:24:28] supplication all through the scripture
[1:24:30] it's where there's needs but notice how
[1:24:34] paul said to let it be known
[1:24:36] with thanksgiving
[1:24:38] that god you're mindful
[1:24:40] you know what i have need of
[1:24:43] you've never failed lord
[1:24:45] you've answered prayers sometimes maybe
[1:24:47] not the way i want them but you've
[1:24:49] always answered every prayer
[1:24:51] you've watched over my life you've
[1:24:53] guided me lord what is it that's with
[1:24:55] thanksgiving
[1:24:57] with thanksgiving
[1:24:58] and then as you begin to enter into that
[1:25:00] place you find
[1:25:01] yourself tapping into a place
[1:25:04] the peace of god all night just begins
[1:25:06] to move
[1:25:08] pulsate right through your life
[1:25:12] keeps your hearts and minds
[1:25:16] brother brown talks about a another
[1:25:18] another woman
[1:25:21] [Music]
[1:25:22] remember she's the one in question
[1:25:24] answer 64 she
[1:25:27] she calls she said a statement
[1:25:31] the ram i've dreamed i'm in
[1:25:32] white sands
[1:25:35] i'm so overtaken i i don't know what's
[1:25:37] going on there's such a darkness or
[1:25:38] we're under such stress
[1:25:41] brother brandon begins to look at it and
[1:25:43] he says sister he said here's the
[1:25:44] trouble
[1:25:45] he said the white sands represents
[1:25:47] purity and righteousness
[1:25:50] he said but you've let satan put one
[1:25:52] over on you and he started to trouble
[1:25:55] you
[1:25:56] so she began to you know she began to
[1:25:58] take something that god meant for her
[1:26:02] in a good way
[1:26:04] but you see how the enemy began to take
[1:26:06] that and twist it around just like he
[1:26:09] can take a quote or a scripture and
[1:26:13] twist it around
[1:26:16] and instead of her
[1:26:18] something that should have brought peace
[1:26:21] brother brandon says that's your whole
[1:26:22] family in white sands he said they're
[1:26:25] standing where they need to be but he
[1:26:27] said what it is he says you've let the
[1:26:29] enemy come in
[1:26:31] and brother brahm takes that scripture
[1:26:32] he says
[1:26:33] think on things
[1:26:35] of a good report
[1:26:37] see the way that even of things that
[1:26:39] maybe she couldn't have understood that
[1:26:40] but she could stand there and say
[1:26:43] i know where my heart is at with god
[1:26:46] i know there's one desire that i have
[1:26:47] above everything else that she would be
[1:26:49] able to stand there
[1:26:51] and battle against that
[1:26:54] not allow the enemy to come in but you
[1:26:56] know it shows sometimes
[1:26:58] the weakness
[1:26:59] that's about
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:02] us brown talks about another situation
[1:27:05] maybe you're not familiar with maybe you
[1:27:07] are
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:09] sister meaty
[1:27:12] she was getting ready you remember they
[1:27:14] told her she couldn't have no more
[1:27:15] children
[1:27:17] here comes along
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:20] sarah remember brother branham god spoke
[1:27:22] to him and said you're going to have a
[1:27:23] joseph
[1:27:25] here comes a little girl sarah
[1:27:28] a different one said
[1:27:29] maybe you meant josephine
[1:27:33] abraham said no he spoke to me joseph is
[1:27:36] coming
[1:27:39] the doctors told them before they had
[1:27:41] sarah
[1:27:42] she shouldn't have no more children
[1:27:48] then sarah come along then here this is
[1:27:50] she shouldn't have no more children
[1:27:54] but you think how the enemy worked this
[1:27:55] at work came in this situation
[1:27:58] there came a woman around
[1:28:01] and this woman come around the house and
[1:28:03] begin to come around
[1:28:05] and she was trying to tell brother
[1:28:06] branham that he needed to listen to her
[1:28:09] and she better do this and better do
[1:28:11] that he better do this and do that
[1:28:12] because if he doesn't
[1:28:14] god's going to take him
[1:28:20] and he goes ahead something's going to
[1:28:22] happen to you
[1:28:24] telling sister meeting
[1:28:26] now you know you would look at that and
[1:28:27] think
[1:28:29] somebody just brushed that off
[1:28:32] but it troubled sister meaty
[1:28:35] it troubled her think about it here's
[1:28:37] what she knows what the doctor has
[1:28:38] already said and where she's at it's
[1:28:40] troubling her brother brown says i
[1:28:42] slipped away from the house
[1:28:45] and i went out to the cave
[1:28:47] and i began to pray and he said god told
[1:28:49] me to go back and get my bible
[1:28:51] and he opened the bible
[1:28:54] to a place god opened it for him a place
[1:28:56] in the word and he took it back right
[1:28:58] there sister media went right into labor
[1:29:01] and here came little joseph
[1:29:03] you see the enemy
[1:29:05] he's an opportunist
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:10] you try to move in and try to bring
[1:29:13] fear and try to bring in in situations
[1:29:16] brother bram says he'll even move in on
[1:29:18] a child he doesn't the enemy doesn't
[1:29:20] care in any way
[1:29:23] say oh god
[1:29:25] if we can see that here was
[1:29:28] children of god and things came about in
[1:29:30] their life don't you let the enemy beat
[1:29:32] you up
[1:29:34] when you've got a little fearful about a
[1:29:36] situation
[1:29:38] or i've got a little down
[1:29:40] that had nothing to do with your soul if
[1:29:41] you're a child of god
[1:29:45] but as a daughter of god and as a son of
[1:29:46] god you can say satan you don't got no
[1:29:49] part here
[1:29:50] you don't have no part here
[1:29:53] you can take in of that word
[1:29:55] taking it down into your life
[1:29:58] allow god to speak and to address that
[1:30:01] get our focus back on who's in our ship
[1:30:04] who's standing here
[1:30:06] who's in the midst of our life
[1:30:10] you love him
