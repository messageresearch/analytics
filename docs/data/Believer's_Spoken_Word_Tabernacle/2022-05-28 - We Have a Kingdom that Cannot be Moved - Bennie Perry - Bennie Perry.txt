it's your you know maybe your dad or whatever but let our eyes go beyond the flesh let me tell you how awesome god is god will call a meeting like this for one person that's how much he cares for one person he'll call a whole meeting he did it for the eunuch he removed philip from one place down there [Music] jesus went by the well of samaria for one person there was a man up in a tree by the name of zacchaeus he said come down i'm having done dinner with you for one person [Applause] hallelujah when you realize that god didn't send this message as though even though it's everybody can be a partaker if they want to but god sent this message for you for me it's a personal gospel hallelujah oh glory be to god what a time of unity i believe as i told the church here on sunday i said you know brother bannon when he first came amongst the pentecostals he was astonished when he came to the hotel and he said here they were hugging one another he said people that had spent their living to come together to a meeting like this and he said they were just full of joy there was no condemnation among them and brother brahm said i believe in my heart that that's how it's going to be just before the rapture hallelujah it's a unity of the holy spirit amen where every difference and everything is set aside it's just jesus we want to see glorified it's jesus we want to see lifted up amen glory be to god amen brother brian if you lead us in that song it's jesus that i really want to see amen as we invite our brother benny perry to come amen oh my i tell you it wouldn't be hard for

the scripture i'm not going to keep you standing i have many things several different messages on my heart but it's something that i that i believe that would be a blessing to us praise god uh i like to go if you will to um hebrews and i had several subjects that i thought about but this here just was really resonating real hard in my spirit um and i'll finish the preliminaries afterwards let's go to hebrews chapter 11 and verse 25. that you refuse not him that's speaketh for if they escape not who refuse him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he said he has promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also the heavens and this word yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we have received a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear fathers we come to you tonight in the name of the lord jesus christ lord bless the church bless every heart those that are want the baptism of the holy ghost lord i believe it's the same as peter spake the word the holy ghost fell on them and i believe your word is the same yesterday today and forever thank you lord for the

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we have received a word that cannot be moved praise the lord how many come here for revival the word the the word is in the bride that's what brother bran said the word is in the bride and we are part of the word we are we know that we come from god and we're going back to god and no matter no matter what goes on in this world no matter what happened god has already sealed us away we are sealed how long to the day of redemption you in other words you have the holy ghost brother brown said the holy ghost you have everything in you to make the rapture the the only way you'll be defeated you let the devil bamboozle you don't let the devil talk you out of god's promise amen you have been sealed adopted into the kingdom of god let me just say this and it's not by power not by your last name not by what calling you is are not who you think you are jesus christ died that you might have a right to the tree of life is not by power not by might but by my spirit said the lord i would thank her brother branham city he came the preacher came to town and he said there was a there was a bully in town the bullet the bully is the devil and he said come in towson look you ain't gonna have no revival there so you're gonna have to come through me first brother braddon said the preacher was up there painting the house everything he says he come on down there he said well i'll take care of you next come down jumped on the man beat him up and invited him to church that night in other words don't you let nothing stop you from breath when you had in your mind to come to this meeting don't let nothing stop you god with you glory when you had a promise you know that you had made up your mind i come here to get from god and brother said in the message expectation you get what you expect if you if you want something from god you expect it and you want something big i don't care if they're here he's jehovah gyra he can put it here if you inspect it if you want a job whatever you're looking for go ahead you believe god god is able to do it good do you believe that he's el shaddai that's what we listen people nurse on the church they nurse on the preacher they nurse on their mom and daddy but if you're gonna nurse on something you better nurse on the breasts of el shaddai that is the strength giver that's who gives you your strength hallelujah praise god glory good to see you amen brother from akron brother bj back there sir i'm glad you came god got something for you you believe that praise the lord he saved what's coming brother brandon said a man ain't no more than his word amen praise god so he kept the word when you keep your word with god god will keep his word brother braham said if you make a vow to god god he said if you keep it god will keep his word amen and it may be like a little something a little insufficient don't mean no but let's say god take that as important because you're a son of god you're a daughter of god people in the matches let me tell you that that things are going shaking around people quitting coming to church they stopping they're scared they don't know what to do but we have received the kingdom that's unmovable the word is in the bride we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved glory you have the authority of god's word here's the secret though the word is in the bride glory we're here traveling people that got to a place they they they're kind of scared he said fear not i'm the first and the last he said i'm heated living and was dead and behold i'm alive forevermore and i have the keys of hell and death and brother brad said he bound safe with the keys of circumstance you don't have to wait glory you have to worry you can bind him god no matter how many circumstances he break on you how much problems he try to bring take the word and bind the devil hallelujah let it know glory listen faith without works is dead people haven't said i have faith but when you have faith you ain't worried about what's going to happen [Applause] faith do not see what's going to happen faith believes what's going to happen glory and without it without it it's impossible it's impossible for a man to please god glory not intellectual conception glory no but you have to take god as his promised word and if he says something gloria i don't care if you don't see it i don't care if you don't feel it you believe it and once you believe it the word god's faith rested on the word of god glory listen brother branham says something here he says now the importance of revelation by the spirit not you know you had a lot of people get revelation you can get a revelation but he says by the spirit glory don't miss that part of the revelation importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized hallelujah glory he said listen and and believe you can never be overemphasized revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize i ain't talking about oh i want to know this i want to know that glory when you when you recognize listen i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i have the revelation of who i am this message come from god no matter how many people quit no matter how many preachers backslide no matter how many people say it ain't working go ahead a true revelation to a believer can never be overemphasized if god said it then i stay with it why do i if god said i'm sick good god said i'm healed i don't care how sick i get the bible says i'm healed and what you rest up you rest on that don't let nothing take you away from it and you may even get even sicker that don't matter do you feel cancer glory i like that the lady got sick brother brown they took her to the doctor and they couldn't find nothing wrong with her but when they took it in front of the word and brother branham looked at her he said satan you hear it from the doctor but you can't hide from god and he cast that devil out he was in the full dimension still before he even got out he wanted to come but god sent him back the way he was and what we need today is genuine sons and daughters of god god listen listen i always say to the church people there's two sides there's a natural and there's a corner to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritual minded glory is life and peace everything can be going wrong you have peace everything's falling apart you have peace why because he's a principle he's the absolute in your life sometimes you get tired sometimes you get frustrated sometimes things go wrong but you know god that weepin may do it for a night i might have a little triumph nighttime girl guess what but one day good god is going to work it out we've been man do it for a night but joy comes in the morning we look at that in the scripture he says in revelation there they would have tribulation for 10 days you know how many of those 10 days was those 10 days was 10 years god didn't say he said be faithful he said be faithful he didn't say well i'ma come and help y'all he gave you something inside of you y'all computer texts i mean how many computer texts we got in here god downloaded a message in your soul hallelujah and when he downloaded the holy ghost what is it it's the holy ghost god download it down in your soul hallelujah can i preach can i preach and some people get viruses on their computer that's why they can't come to church that's why they can't praise god they don't feel good they're up and down go ahead get the virus off glory you need a supernatural spam system which is the holy ghost that will knock everything out no matter if you're tired no matter what's going wrong glory you've got to delete some things are you listening are you listening are you listening are you listening you might delete going to the club sometime you might have to delete hanging around with the wrong person lord but you got to know glory that your system that god placed in you the word is in the bride you wanted a million do you believe that you're one in a million what time brother brad said the lady got a man was going down the street in california he had on his back i'm a fool for christ everybody was laughing looking at her but on his back of his shirt when he walked by he said who fooled you if you don't be a fool for jesus you're going to be somebody's food somebody's going to make a fool so you might want to let jesus do it we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved we haven't seen the words listen we were talking the other day brother brandon preached the authority of god's word how many never heard that message he said gloria listen i want you to say the authority of god's word is not the authority of you it's the authority of god's word amen so if you can make god you can make the word fail didn't you make god fail and it's impossible impossible for god to fail he can't lie he can't fail i don't care how many bad things go wrong in your life it don't make no difference god's word the authority of the word it would bring everything subject glory it would bring everything subject to the holy ghost [Applause] in the beginning it didn't say at the beginning it's different in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was with god and the word was made flesh peter picks it up and said first peter he says and this is the word whereby the gospel is preached to you it's not are you listening if not all pastors saw it so brother swords all he preached even no it's god's word and he who god sent will speak his word gloria listen if you sit at the america center uh representative from here over to ukraine and and uh i don't care how much he want to say what he want to say he got to say what by and tell him to say or else he's not an ambassador he his own glory you got too many people their own way god sent them to spring the word they want to say what they want to say but god said he he's saying will speak his word and if he's the true genuine ambassador for the united states the man can say well look you know it'll be easy if we just do this he said but the president said this is what it is i can show you that it's a little different let me show you the ambassador said i don't care what you say president biden said this here now if you want to go along with it if you want to agree with it fine if you don't then i'm going back and taking the proposal whatever that country offered you i'm taking it back are you listening and god said if you don't want to believe the word glory then when i do i'll take it back cause the word was sent to you to profit with the only thing he did he beat the devil he gave you he gave you the only thing you can defeat the devil with he took down muscle man took down pretty women took down big churches small churches you can say all you want to say the only thing that's going to defeat him is the word glory listen and he's not afraid he challenged jesus and you think you got something he challenged jesus and what jesus would want to make sure that he defeated satan would when he went there for 40 days and 40 nights he didn't use nothing else do you know he could have said listen satan you know who i am i created you i can destroy you but he never did that he just went right along man should not live by breton i need bread i need to eat but i'm not going to let me leave me eat me ahead of what you say amen see i want to i want to i want to be successful i want to have a lot of things in life lord but he said listen i give it all to you he said but giving it to me outside the word it's not it's not going to help you so he wanted him to realize that whatever you need whatever your battles is the word reality glory little little wild he said the world won't see me but you shall see me the world cosmos the world order won't see me but you shall see me for i will be with you even in you at that day what day this day the world don't see it no more but you shall see him why because the word is in the bride you and god have become not it's united signs and times people think they've denied it with the church to hear no it's god in you heaven and earth is really want to embrace one another are you listening abraham abraham abraham looked for a city he looked for a city whose building maker was god he was looking for that city brother branstad was right above his head he knew that there was something greater he could feel it he looked for it glory and he was searching for it all his life where you going abraham and listen i just want to dramatize just for a minute abraham where you going i don't know what you mean when you don't know where you're going it's a city somewhere i'm looking for it it's not in canaan it's not in canaan it's not not not not in mesopotamia but abraham lot said well let me tell you something abraham you said there's a message to believe it i ain't gonna hang with that no more good you got a bunch of lots that's been shaken off glory in other words abraham could not get his full blessing until god got rid of a lot and a lot of people can't get their full blessing because they hold it on to about lots of lots in their life sometimes god's word calls for a total separation from all unbelief don't forget who it is it could be anybody your mama daddy whatever god's word calls for a total separation and abraham glory see we have received the kingdom our kingdom is not up this world jesus said if his kingdom was of this world you know we'll be fighting all right we'll be trying to uphold it try to fight but it's not let them fight for ukraine let them fight for russia let them fight for the united states do you realize what's happening now all the prophecies that brother branham said you are living in that you are living in what was smoking but in 1933 those visions only thing you waiting on is the bomb to drop now let me let me just say this here good and the reason why i didn't drop because brother branham says before one bomb dropped the bride will be gone hallelujah and we we are resting on that we are resting on that listen i had a friend out in fetus arizona he got in that car they sent the car to his house no nobody was in it come pick him up call his name know where he lived at he got in the car and it took him where he wanted to go and he could have played games he said if he wants to search is this the time lord he realized that the vision that the prophecy we just look at because we're in the technology you know we get this computer this car here but listen brother branham went down he had to come all the way up here to see what was going on he was not he was not are you listening lord he didn't know about going all the chains of events that's unfolding glory and we thought about the car a few years ago we were excited about riding down the street watching our what you call it the monitor video with the tv riding down the street having tv monitor yeah dvd watching tv praise god but that's not what he said he said they'll be going down the road playing games with no sterny wheels no nothing it's this day that scripture that prophecy has been fulfilled in your ears what what made the people really know what made them really know glory when jesus read that scripture this day the scriptures were filled he went back when he went back and saw what the prophet said said and then after he said he looked around he said wait a minute this is not just something just happened somebody has spoken this before gloria are you listening and he says he talked quote in isaiah the blinded eyes was open the deaf ears are and all these things and jesus he realized he fulfilling it i'm the one doing this here i'm the one fulfilling it sometimes people sit in message churches all day like and don't realize they are the ones that fulfilling the words the word is in the bride this is your day white said this is your message this is your time this is the time going hey listen this is not the time for you to sit home and hope it all that's going wrong i don't know if i'm gonna go to church all the coronavirus just happened to go let everything come like it was but one thing lord we have received a kingdom which can not be moved i don't care what they do what goes on in the earth it's not going to trade god god never changes mind about his word glory can't do it and they looked and jesus he said this day isaiah 61 i used to know it in my head it's being fulfilled in your ears hey listen we should be able to look back and look at what's going on and all the prophecies was taking place you know brother bradley mentioned if you've read it in church you could take a a sale out of a cow let's say if you take it out a kidney after a cow you put it in a human being guess what it's gonna go right where the kidneys supposed to be it may not work in you but it's got enough sense to know listen i come from a kidney glory if you take a brain cell and take it and inject it in your leg it's going to go to the brain you know why because there's a law going that god had no cells there and brother branham realized that he wasn't a doctor but what he was was he know god doesn't change his mind about his word and he know that he created things just the way they're supposed to be [Applause] if the sales your dna if all that there glory is right then genesis 1 and 11 has to be potent every seed will bring forth from sky no matter what it is no matter what goes on that's why glory are you listen you played people in the baptist church i don't care how much they tried to plant you the catholic church and and the uh similes of god whatever you eat you couldn't stay there because your seed is the word hello glory and the catholic could have treated you real good and the baptist can treat you real good but lord if you come from god you got to go back to god the life that was in you glory it looked like a human life but actually it's eternalized it's the bible is zoe brother brown says god's own life praise god [Applause] glory abraham abraham he's the father of faith he's stacking not at the promise of god you know what let church say man let me get on some kind of thing i don't care what people think about you what they don't love me they think that you shouldn't be what god made you be that that ain't their business god made you who you are and glory and it's up to god whether you stay in the fall it's up to god how you going to be successful uh-huh people that they like their whole life trying to be successful all you got to do what is success brother brandon made it simple the most successful person is when they put god first amen you say but he don't have all the bill gates money yeah but he don't have bill gates trouble go ahead he don't have all this here but he don't have he don't have to worry about all that other stuff one thing he do have is the holy ghost when he get in trouble he have an advocate you know what i mean he has somebody to stand in for him oh y'all gonna get mad when i say this people in church sometimes won't stand in for you but jesus christ will stand for you regardless if you let him know you need his help he's a very present help there's a deep call to the deep there has to be a deep to respond you know the devil try to take people take the take the inspiration from you try to take the love of god try to get in the message and come to go oh you listen you know brother sword so you know gloria he he was deep in the message sister so-and-so was deep in mexico so what gloria who are you father sister so-and-so my brother so-and-so are you following jesus when the greek with the greeks when the greeks came what did they come they said oh we want philip we need to see uh nate that that feeling they came all the way from athens greece the brother brad said they came to the meeting go ahead the passover they said sir we would see jesus you had john peter james the disciples there but they didn't want to see that they wanted to he they wanted to see jesus and then when jesus come out he knew what they really wanted [Applause] they didn't want to see him in the flesh sorry no they what they were looking for they was asking for the right thing but they wouldn't realize what they was asking for are you listening church we wouldn't see jesus jesus come out he said accept the corner we'd fall to the ground and die it'll abide alone what you really want to see is my life resonated coming to everybody that's what you really want so before you go back to after greece when i died resurrect again you will only see me but i'll be with you even in you even in you and he's in the church today holy ghost ain't just a good shout and screaming oh i feel good praise god because the holy ghost is a god he leads you he guides you you are here and receiving this message today in this end time because the holy ghost was guiding you you said but i just got saved 30 30 years ago amen he still was god [Applause] you belong to me when you got sick who visited you the kind old priest that's what brother branham said who missed you kind of preaching that kind he was so nice to you you forgot that jesus was the one glory can i be we haven't seen we keep listening things are shaking the church has changed so much i know y'all don't see it if you don't don't realize it it just shook the people so bad for somebody they don't even know what to do anymore something come up glory but we have a stabilizer except you abide in the ship you will not be saved and what is the ship it's the message of the hour you've got your body [Music] [Applause] [Music] i've talked to a brother left church and so forth and and uh he came to me he said brother what are you trying to tell me to come to church you certainly he said will i be lost or saved can you tell me only god knows that i said but i can tell you this god sent a message and and the message it says glory that god sent a message like in the days of noah the ark was to say noah i said now it's up to you but i said if you don't end the mess don't know the message most of the time god will judge to judge me for for for being in it then he gonna judge you for being out [Applause] that's that's the only thing that's the only way because listen in the days of noah it was one door how many never met messed up brother braham says god purposely pray one door so it's one way it's not all kind of preachers ways and not you know we have all these great evangelists all these great preachers in the glory but there were three seeds sold in this last day fundamental seed pentecost apostolic seed in the word there were three preachers y'all called how many notes how many know what i'm talking about three preachers went down to sodom and gomorrah how many know songs are more simon the boy's world you had billy graham or robinson you had brilliant brandon and all three of them left an effect on this world all robert's got all the pentecostal apostolate they if you follow all roberts and look at his teaching all the pentecostals that just like him you follow billy graham every minute of preaching this preacher if you go some billy glam notes you'll find out that he's in there they follow his teaching are you listen now and if you follow brother branham tv he says he's one of the man the only one in this side of this generation that pointed everyone to jesus christ if god and it was his word it was god's word and he had to point them to jesus christ one of the few men hello gloria so you were influenced by one of those seeds glory listen so so uh excuse me billy graham and the old robbers went down to sodom the angel of the lord here the last angel came and he came to abraham he said shall i hide from abraham what i'm about to do he was telling abraham the secrets that was going to take place let me tell you you not only have a message you not only have a message but god revealing to you the secret the deep things of god that he's hiding from the world but he let he let his wife know what's going on you i'm not just saying something no you're reading the message things are in a message you can't baptise won't you know nothing about it you know catholics don't know nothing about it the rapture is a revelation and i see people going down to call oh are you ready the rapture is going to take place and i'm like okay it's just that simple all right but it's not that simple it's a revelation [Music] so when brother bran was preaching the rapture message he was telling you the revelation of the rapture and how it was going to happen and where it's going to take place are you listening you said well it might not happen but let me tell you something it's been so right so much until i got to believe that one morning between six and nine god that he's gonna catch his church away because he had if everything to be said so far it's just right one morning glory listen you know i never as soon as i travel a lot i used to never listen when i first when i got the message i i didn't know what brother i would listen to christ revealed his own word and brother brandon was preaching he said you see these white lights you're dropping down out the sky coming up he said one day it's going to drop down and catch your body up now i never paid attention to that until i started reading and coming to mess and i read that and all of a sudden i'd be going down the road not no falling stuff all of a sudden the car going he'd come something by my car and then i'm still going to go out of space i said what what god tried to do let you know that the word is right that don't worry it's going to happen and one of these days is not going to be over your car you're going to be going down there and it's going to drop down on your body break up the atoms and everything and you're going to be translated eat up walk with god he not walked with god he was not for god took him [Applause] how did god take him brother graham said he just kept walking kept walking kept walking stopped walking and defied the law of gravity walked into heaven walk through the house praise god listen and you're the seventh church age you're the seventh man you're the seventh group you are the seventh group from from the uh from my paul you would have said the group we are the ones should be expecting it and uh don't don't look at all the turmoil don't look at all the stuff falling apart and sometimes brothers call me nothing wrong with that that brother just said oh brother you know so and so he don't love the message no more he don't love us so what you keep on listening to him you might not love it either lord tell him hey look put it away let it go i want to hear it let it soar so quick glory let him quit because god has placed in you inside of you let me just say you are a it's just recorded sometimes we don't believe you're a super race no matter how much you know i've seen people that really that that want to quit that don't want to have nothing to do with it and then out then they outside talking about it testifying about it why because the word good the message got to be down in your bones it's got to be in your life lord it's got to be showing that you can't get it out [Music] no matter what peter said seven gold have i none but such as i have brother brown said he had eternal life he was in part in eternal life that's what you do you went you say i'm witness somebody i just talked to him get a note you are in part in eternal life what's in you you're giving it to them glory hello where's the word at it's in the bride glory everything is going to be shaking i don't care what's going you ain't seen nothing yet good it's gonna continue to be shaken and more people are gonna continue to oh they dig it ain't happening you know god ain't coming the longer he take the better i feel because i know he's coming and i'm awake how long how long i'm awake till my change coming until my channel [Applause] amen god has not given us he has not given us a spirit of fear but a power and a love and a sound mind people may thank you crazy but they think you crazy believing and following this you ought to say like brother brandon said just leave me alone i like it like this leave me alone let me serve god lord why because you're part of the eternal you're not part of eternal life you're not just part of a church you're part of eternal life listen brother braham said look into the unseen he says everything in christianity armor is supernatural you want to read that that's that's the reason why i want to quote that because see people think that god's army is just natural you know no you got to unlock the supernatural that's in you glory everything in our supernatural we do not look at what we see we look at what we do not see you cannot be healed only through looking at what you do not see hey listen you want to be healed i don't care how sick you is you looking at you healed i don't care if everything falls apart you die and the doctor says you gotta you got one day to live you still take that day and say lord i'm healed and believe it [Music] hold to it yes sir faith hallelujah don't see no circumstances i was in i was in wales and a young man came up this and uh came up to me trying to get his paper five years just right there it was at a service just like this and he was preaching in the holy ghost drop down he could five

ahead lord bless you go get your papers i'm just praying that was on sunday on monday he went down to the embassy and on tuesday he got his papers and let me just tell you what they said oh he's been sitting on our desks we want to get to it but we just realized i want you to know that everything is clear you know go let me tell you something god can stop anything god should make god to make your enemy your footstool [Applause] hello you got to trust him amen you got to trust him and little brother got the had a another one brother that was fred he was in england and a matter of fact i was there preaching not too long ago and he came to me and i didn't even know it and as he was as uh he came to me he wanted to get his wife he was getting married he was in england's wife from zimbabwe

in england [Applause] you tell me god can do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can act i think according to the power that works within us let me tell you one of the secrets brother branham says glory the holy ghost can only reach into your power that's in you according to your faith you are the one releasing the power so what you want what you want and you don't doubt and believe it you can have what you say that's a quote i ain't got it exactly right but he says you it can only work to release the power that is within you [Music] [Applause] [Music] i only believe we have received a kingdom it cannot be moved god is unchangeable he doesn't change y'all know that sterling brothers when they had come to question brother branham and they went up to chicago you know the chicago administration ministers meet and everything they got there they got the building got everything set up and brother branham come back say y'all ain't gonna get it he's old brother we already got the building it's paid for and everything gloria next day and come back and say oh oh oh we all ready to lease it out we're sorry we had somebody else get it before y'all he said but we don't pay for it man so i don't care somebody else get the building before that brother branham said said listen he says glory i'm gonna tell y'all y'all got trying to set a trap for me he's gonna have on this he's gonna have that kind of clothes he's gonna be sitting here he's gonna be sitting here he says and and he says and y'all ain't going to get the building he's oh we already got it he was confident but he didn't know god god can change god to change he has the power to transform and so they weren't coming to it i don't know the brother osborne i can't think of his name right now but this just came up come up he says uh brothers brother branham we got the building he said listen i'm gonna tell y'all something they got it to me he said now i ain't got nothing to do with it he had a lot of sense he said i'm gonna tell you this man told me what you want to have on where y'all was gonna be sitting and we weren't gonna get the place and and all this he said now i'm out of it i ain't got nothing to do with it and brother branham all they had to do stand up and say listen if anyone can dispute or disagree with anything that i preach let him come up here and stand by my right side listen listen 300 preachers 300 300. not a one of them stood up [Music] and they all come and said we coming down there to be baptized not a one of them come to get baptized reason why i bring that they did because they were representing some of all the great organizations at that time that are still existing today if they couldn't stand against the word then how can they stand against the word now they can't do it they can't stand against it amen glory hallelujah lord we have received the kingdom it can't be moved it can't be shaken at all the earth is shaking people are shaking individually shaking families are shaking marriages are shaking friendships are shaking everything is falling apart the world is falling apart but there's one thing that will never fall apart heaven and earth will pass away but the word of god shall not pass away and that's the word that is preached to you [Applause] [Music] i believe it i believe it i believe the word i believe the word you believe the word lord it's not just a meeting lord you come here to believe the word glory it ain't all what i want or what he wanted what she wants it's what god wants god and if it's something that if god don't want it i don't want to be bothered [Applause] [Music] got nothing to do with pablo got ain't nothing to do with who you are where you come from it's got to do all about god listen the reason why god sent a prophet is because of the people that's why you got a prophet they made that they the one did they once said that and their brother got mad well the prophet you make too much emphasis on brother brown just there don't listen to that nonsense god dang the one the very brothers that run in their mouth is the one that wanted a prophet don't believe that when god told him to come out that's what malachi 4 is there for you understand he said now remember he wanted to remind them remember what you said in horeb these are your fathers these are your forefathers the ones that you sent father that god said i come speak to y'all i'm gonna come out and speak to y'all y'all wanna hear me and when you come back and put bounds around and listen he's done the same thing he did out in arizona god come down on the cloud thundering enlightening the voices it shook the earth and they said oh moses please please moses we don't want god to speak you can tell us we believe we believe we will believe you moses and god said that's a good thing they said that because a lot of them would have died that day he said behold now they said we want to we'll speak to you god said okay i'll send y'all a prophet from here on out you can't endure my voice you're not here preachers on the radio y'all forgive me every time god spoke to me last night and god told me this last night and god spoke to me i said if god speak to you that but you don't have time to get up people think they think it's a joke god god you know it god spoke to solomon one time and my people who are called by my name and solomon's baby you know said that he wanted to be you know serve god right and so forth god did come every week every month every single speaking to it god speak to you by his word [Applause] glory yes sir hello he had changed when a prophet come you know you enjoy brother branham to thank god for it but when god sent a prophet it's about overweight he comes at the end of the age see what people are underestimating they think god is real merciful and kind and look but he's seen the prophet when a prophet comes on the earth you better believe your time is about running out because listen the prophet are you listening can i get a little deep now the prophet comes in the place of god a son of man revealing these son of man so he had to do things he had to do things and let people know you're not just listening to brother branham somebody's stepping into this body to let you know that you're not i'm not playing around i'mma turn my back who do you say this is gloria that's not william branham i'm using his voice i'm speaking through him boy hey solomon revealing these shuttles are you listening and the gentiles the gentiles never had a visitation like abraham hayes are you listening they never had a god step down in human flesh in the body don't give me no misunderstanding now because god come down at abraham and he talked to abraham he ate me drink milk ate from a calf and then he told abraham something good that he told him years ago this time next year sarah would have that child god god come down all right he brought two angels with him brother bratton said he picked up cosmic light and dust and everything put on one angel put on another and god put on the body himself god come down drink milk ate some steak don't drunk some milk and when god got happy he sent the other two angels down to sodom good morning stay with abraham are you listening paul didn't have that do you know that paul never come to the journey i'm going to tell you who your name is reason why you you're so scared yo your mother was running she was afraid of a dog and and she got that spirit and it jumped on you that's why you're so nervous and upset amen paul never did that paul was the first messenger he was an angel to the covenant he was the word now don't get me wrong but now the gentiles are he listen jesus came when jesus came in the flesh that was god manifested in the flesh but remember he was god and he was man he was god and he was man he could cry feel bad and yet he could go down there and raise ladder from the grave he was as much jesus was as much man as he was god are you listening he was god now the reason why jesus came because there was nobody everyone had sinned there was none righteous no not nobody glory and god had to do something that he'd never done before what god did he had to create him a body god created him a body glory not the will of man daughter with the flesh but the word the word the very spoken word the word that you hear tonight the same word that you hear it was a word that created jesus christ god created his own house that he could live in a tabernacle and he come and listen to people are you listening the jews didn't even understand it themselves and they were looking for the messiah to come but they didn't understand are you listening follow with me don't don't go nowhere i ain't win glory and here they was saying hear god wrapped in a manger you talking about humiliated when he come from let me just remind you he came from a throne glory angels all day all night we read about it but we don't understand the impact of it holy holy holy all day all night then god had to create a body like this he got tired god got tired god got uh fed up with things he got aggravated amen are you listening [Music] he had to get mad y'all don't believe god got those scribes and pharisees in the church selling chicken dinners and french fries and all that kind of stuff in the church oh we getting we get message churches doing it now glory brother i'm saying we don't buy a cell in church glory but now we get the messenger and auto get quiet anybody said that jesus he looked at him with anger and he took a cord and whooped him out of the church why because he said this is a house of prayer you have made it a deal of jesus glory do you believe he was the word he came into his own oh and his own received him not he really came to the jews this message was sent to the bride this message made it was sent to the elect glory are you listening jesus was humiliated the very ones that were looking for him he listened was the one that crucified me jesus said listen if one comes in his own name you'll receive him amen but i come in my father's name and you receive me not are you listening are you listening he didn't come into somebody else's name he came in in other words jehovah of the old is jesus of the news [Applause] amen listen they said paul i know jesus i know but who are you [Music] oh don't be quiet [Applause] oh i follow jesus if you don't follow the message do you really follow jesus jesus is the word and the predestinated word of this hour this day god the word must become flesh [Applause] oh yeah it's a thin line glory it's real thin but if you don't get it then you won't realize what's in you because christ is in you the hope of glory he's not they wasn't killing jesus because he said i'm a minister but he recognized he being a man he said you being a man trying to make yourself god well he wasn't he was god listen you can't make yourself a bride god god made you a bride you can't make yourself be something that you're not i don't care what you try to be god have to make it that way amen listen a lot of people get the same way what they did with brother branham there's only one lord and savior that's jesus christ amen but if you don't understand the way god works with human beings and what god will do god can come in a man in his fullness [Music] if i cast out devils i raise the dead who is that real god and if you start thinking it's me guess what you started worshiping the idol [Applause] can i preach you this what god gave to us in this last day it's supposed to stumble some people amen [Music] jesus wasn't he didn't he didn't take no time but he didn't play let church say a minute let me clear that i don't have no doctrine or nothing i'm just trying to bring it to you going jesus he didn't make no he says except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you amen thought that listen who is him his mother is here his father is here he's been to the same church we've been to the national who is he but see they were failing to see that his ministry was moving into the channel in which god was getting ready he now was a messiah he was a manifested word of that day you know i mean i mean how long jesus jesus last do you know 30 30 years he only preached three and a half years all the rest of the time all the rest of the time didn't mean nothing to god you know why because now he's moving into what he really was sitting here for listen i wonder do the bride know that she's moving into what she really was sitting here for girl she will be a super church she would be a super race she would be a super people because god said that would happen and you might as well have to get ready listen if you're not born again how many feel good how many feel good let me tell that same holy old feeling right there god you can receive the holy ghost right now you can step up say lord i want to be baptized i want the holy ghost you can get it right now while peter spake the word the holy ghost fell out you want the holy ghost to feel it you know what brother brandon say you're feeling your theophany it makes you feel good i'm not just saying that it ain't me making you excited no it's that supernatural being that's sitting by you that motivates you this movie glory hallelujah oh glory to god let's get the lord handcuff of praise thank god praise god hallelujah holy holy holy is the lord god of hosts the whole earth is filled with the knowledge and the glory of god [Applause] you i'm in the message now i hear that it's in you brother branham says god jesus he got tired he got hungry he died brother he got aggravated brother brown said a quote he said if he wanted to he could have married and had children [Applause] but he knew he knew what his purpose was what he's called to do listen a few years ago i was just thinking about russia ukraine and everybody looking at the watching the wrong thing [Music] [Applause] ain't no prophecy concerning [Applause] you don't know what time it is huh don't know what time it is he said you look at the clock on the wall you want to know what god is doing i want to know what god is doing you watch israel you want to know what the bride is doing watch the message see what the message said about us god's calling a bride you are god listen there ain't nothing the devil can do we have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken [Applause] glory everything else is falling apart he even got some people something in the message think that the message is falling apart even though some of the preachers think that something wrong with the message and they quit gloria ain't nothing wrong with the message you know what that artist they drew a picture brother i'm talking about that picture that the artist drew and they said something was wrong with it said a nice picture but it don't have a where's the where's the doorknob how can somebody get in that the picture's not right he says no he meant to draw it glory he says in order for me you got to open the door and let him know nothing wrong with the drawing glory it's the person that got the hand on the door going you got to open the door and let him in the message is all right you just can't take your idea and try to make it fit your idea you got to take your idea and let it fit god's word [Applause] i was preaching the other night the other night no god can do anything we always put on balaam you know with balaam donkey you know preacher we always put on women preach because they said god can use anybody so if you want to lay yourself to that that's fine but but see even that's awful amen because the duck is spoke with a not a woman's voice he spoke with a man so that means it was a male donkey so that cuts her out again [Applause] but what but what i want to bring god balaam he said he did that the full bear the madness of the prophet so when balaam got sold you know he got so in the money balance ain't gonna make him big make it so god could deal with it so god come down and he had balaam's own donkey and he took that dunk and god said you know he won't listen and the dunk could ride and the only thing he had in his mind i'll let church say amen i'm gonna get home sometimes people have something in their mind so bad that they want to do they overlook god's word they overlook what's right they just look at it they don't care what it is and sometimes god has to come down and do something to stop them [Applause] and balaam he got there got on that donkey only thing he was thinking about hey i'm gonna be you know they made me the board of bishops now i'm the greatest man i'm going you know that's what he think in his mind whatever he was thinking he got on the dunk and he started riding god said i can't speak to him he won't listen to me praise the lord i'd have tried everything to stop him well listen so as he was driving down he had a good donkey when he needed him to plow the ducky plow he needed to do this the donkey just was so kind wouldn't argue with us and when he got on the start riding going down the bay league god anointed the donkey and as he was getting ready to go the dunkin seen the supernatural baleam got there it was two walls on this side two mountains in the in the dunking baylor he had to go through that little thing walk walk way through that mountain and the donkey saw that angel had to swore drawed and the dog said look you may be crazy enough to go this way but uh uh i ain't going that way and that angel had that sword drawn and he got it and said oh god and the doctor would have brushed his head foot against him against the um the mountain and he got come on don't go bust your foot on that side and then all of a sudden babe said what's wrong with this meal he took him in obviously he had a cane took his cane and whipped him whipped it hit the doctor with her and the doctor started speaking in tongues [Applause] he says have i ever disobeyed you have i ever acted like this never have i ever done anything wrong to you man i'm saying no no but you keeping me for my money no no and all of a sudden when the donkey starts speaking in tongues the bible says smoke with a man's voice and that was the only thing that brought balaam to his senses sometimes people get so spiritual poor blind rich and naked and don't even know it and it's hard for god to speak to him repent oh age here the series of the lord repent all of us glory hallelujah glory say we have a revival all right you know what happens you go out there they take all the truckloads of garbage barges what they call a barge i think this take away out in the middle of the ocean that ain't coming back it's going to sank down and never come back let a great typhoon or wave come up the trash sweep it all the way from up there and bring it right back to the shore brother branham said the ocean had a revival they know what to do that's the way the church do the devil try to bombard us with all kind of stuff what we do make the word come in there go and empty it all back out good but we can have a fresh kill of the word feel good try good your spirit feels good i want to say this and then i'm gonna come to close brother branham says worrying if your physical body your your body get the word and your spirit get
