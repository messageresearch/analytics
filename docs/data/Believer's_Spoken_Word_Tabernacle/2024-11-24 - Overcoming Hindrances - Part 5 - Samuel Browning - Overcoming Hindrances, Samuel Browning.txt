appreciate our brother amen [Music] God bless you Saints it's good to be here again this morning and it be an understatement to say that I'm nervous so just have to be patient with me and if I don't get the words right or something just allow it to my ignorance CU you'll know what I'm talking about and I I've got something to share with you and I had to wait and pray and and and talk to our pastor CUA we we don't want to go over our pastor's head and my heart went out to him there Thursday I I know he had that on his heart and he was struggling and I was just praying and that's why I got up after service and tried to say a little something because I just it was so good you know so I uh I I want to pray again if it's okay before our heavenly father Lord Lord you're so good and gracious and mercies to us we know Lord Jesus now that you come down and become our kinsman redeemer to redeem us for only you could pay that awful price for us and it's good to know Jesus that we're not our own we belong to you we've been bought and paid for it with a price that only you could pay and Lord we find your yourself right here at the end time and seeing these great things that you've done for us and called us and what you're doing Lord and your promises to us that we hold to with all our heart and our soul because we know Lord your word can't fail your promise is true and I just pray Lord It's my heart that somehow be a little blessing and help to your children Lord and I ask you to help me and help them and and just have your way Lord we commit it all into your precious hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I'll try to be I'll try to be brief and I I I was going to I was going to speak some things on the Rapture and I had a lot of quotes and things and I was going to Lord willing another day and God will and I I'll bring that to you but for right now I I don't know just how to say this but you know I I told you I I tried to witness to you what God had done in my life and and I know and everything in God's time and you remember I was telling you after after the the Lord brought me in and I was filled and sealed with his holy spirit it was it was a good while we was hunting for a church and you know this was back in late 69 or 70 somewhere in there so there wasn't a lot of things at churches or anything back then but I remember I'll tell you this and talking about how Satan so subtle tries to bring things around to distract us and take us away but he can't we belong to our Lord there is no way but he's he's going to be Satan and so I Min Shirley was uh coming to church and she was reading to me about this Minister Minister that was forgive me in supposed to be in the message and he was saying that no one else could be saved and I told I said he too late to tell me that and and so and then we know that Satan does those tricks and how he he's done so many thing to try to distract the bride and pull her away over the years and and and this last thing he's come against the ministry and you know that and I I uh I was thinking did did that happen before in the church and I went to I believe it's uh Second Timothy and Paul was talking to Timothy now I can't get these words and names of it but he was talking about these two men that uh was teaching that the resurrection was already passed and overthrow the faith of some so this is nothing new on Satan's tactics that cause he'll he'll do everything he can but he's already defeated our Lord rose conquered and conquered him and Rose over death held in the grave and everything he he can't he can't do anything with God's bride but test and try you and that all works for you good and so you remember me telling you uh it's been after a while I was saved I was at uh church at Lima and I was standing in the back Deacon then and that uh I waiting on brother Tommy you know to open up the song leader and the Lord spoke to me and I told you in here and he said they will ask you to pray and I said huh and about that time brother Tommy said I'm going to ask brother Dave Crest to come up and open prayer and you can imagine how I felt walking up there but I want to make this clear my friend I'm not a preacher or anything I'm just one of God's Little Children a part of you was nothing of me I wasn't asking him Lord will you speak to me he did that by his grace and I told you seven several other times and uh that he spoke to me only one time did he speak to me in an audible voice and I I was reading the Bible and I was reading Luke 17:30 and I said I was wondering to myself I said I don't know is this brother brother brand speaking of himself or our lord Jesus and uh he he spoke to me and he he spoke to me in a tender voice and he said because I asked the P pastor about it and he said I don't know brother I can't tell you so I was in my little room praying and it it come to me as a whisper and he had to and I thought is that my thinking and it come a little stronger listen to the anointed ones at the end time and I thought what I was praying about was really important and so I stopped again and then he come much stronger and said listen to the anointed ones at the end time so I got it from there and I said I'm going to listen to The Annoying ones at the end time and we had old real unreal players and then uh when I got toward the end brother Brandon was talking and he said you might think I was talking of myself being I'm packing this message I I I hope I don't get things wrong he said I was only near when he said and he said I am not the son of man he said I'm a son of man revealing the son of man he said the the son of man is Christ Jesus so you can tell how I felt but there was my answer but these these other times when he spoke to me in here I wasn't ever praying Lord Jesus show me this he did it by his grace and mercy wasn't me friends I tell you you know we were lost and wasn't done and with no hope without him God by his grace Sovereign Grace has p out his love and all in our in our days now I hope you can bear with me I'm going to read you something here and friends I I I didn't how many times I've listened to the seven seal and I didn't know this till the other day so please please understand it's not me it's him it's always been him and he said standing there when this left me something just come to me and said don't fear now I didn't hear no voice like on the inside of me spoke I just have to tell you the truth just exactly what happened something hit and said Don't Fear this is the third pull he said the third pull you remember and he said you've had so many impersonations on this what you tried to explain but said don't ever try this you remember it's how many remember the vision why it's all over it's taped and everywhere that's been about 6 years ago 7 years ago Ben 7 years ago said don't try to explain that said that's the this is the third pool and I'll meet you in there that's right amen he said don't try you remember the the 20 told about the three pools and the little fish and all and and uh he was the ministers got around him and said oh brother Bram you can do this you know and he said well I know something about fishing and he threw his line out there and he said he caught a fish but it was just barely over the skin Over The Lure and so when he was uh when he was uh trying I believe it's talking about uh explaining things and I I don't I can't get it all but he said the angel come you know come to him and and he said said I told you not to do that and and he was you know really repenting saying Lord you know I'm a poor servant and all but you know and then I know the Lord said it's you know the third pool it won't be an open show and we know it'll be here at the end time and it's for the bride and bride only and I I I had a lot of notes and things on the Rapture I left them all at home and other things I was going to do but I wanted to talk to our pastor first and see if it's okay to share this with you but the Lord will I I'll share some more things with you I I just I'll just say this you remember when Jesus told them about the Jews that when they seen these signs these things to get out of there don't go back to get anything and woe to hers that we stuck you know cuz she had to run with that baby he said get out and so those Jews that were attentive in watching what Jesus had told him to watch for they got out of there and brother randam said the others probably just stood around said we'll ask holy fathers for so and so to to pray you know and Titus went in there and and the Army and slaugh slaughtered every one of them men women and children and everything now they asked our lord Jesus the disciples what would be the sign of the time you know and all these he asked brother R said they asked him three questions he answered in three questions so I'm not going to get into that now but he had warned us two of things to watch for when was near like one thing was the Fig Tree he said when you see the Fig Tree given by you know that's Israel he said no it's not and even at the door so look where we're at and I I I don't want to go in I'm dry mouth and nervous so God bless you all and just keep me in prayer on another time I'll try to share Lord willing the some these other things with you God bless you God bless you amen praise the Lord certainly appreciate brother chest don't we amen amen praise God hallelujah so thankful amen let's sing that song man Here I Am to Worship Here I Am to Worship hear him to bow down say that he's

what a what a privilege it is amen I I pray God always help that to stay before us you know sometimes we we wonder why things and situations take place and you know but God always God always knows how to keep us in a place to where we're appreciative of him and to know that it's all about him aren't you grateful for that amen God is so he's so mindful of us amen and all along as we've been saying

a lot to be thankful for and um I'd like to just um we want to get ready to go right into the word of the Lord and uh I just want to certainly ask for your prayers as well this morning the Lord will just have his way that's what we want amen when we come here we we want his him to have his way so God knows what we have need of and U also um wanted to um uh mention as well brother Homer was asking me to thank you for your prayers and uh he's he's he's he's doing doing better he's feeling better and so he asked me to say thank youen for that and so uh I know uh sister Carmen earlier had uh in the probably on Friday had text me about uh Little Little Caesar every time I hear it I think of pizza little Cesar I don't mean to take any moment out of it you know it's just a little funny little thing and uh cute little guy and and so he really uh was in need of a real touch from the Lord and with sickness and had pneumonia in one of his lungs but I just just had reached out to her again this morning uh she's um he's doing very well he's doing better amen so we thank God for that and we want to just continue to keep one another in prayer we uh you know if you don't see someone that's here just continue to just to hold them up in prayer amen amen well let's let's go ahead and stand and uh um I'm going to read this morning from actually from deuteron omy chapter 28 and uh just be uh patient there with my wife she's uh running the slides a little bit and then I'll take over brother Brian and uh sister Susanna and the family they um have went to um to visit a family there in um in Arkansas and so I think I think with Arkansas you have to have a passport to get in there or something so they um they're there to visit family and um they so um I hope I can get this correct here I don't want that up there like that just go ahead and kick that off just go to Deuteronomy chapter 28 and Ben while oh never mind Paul go back on my desk and get my laptop would you please Deuteronomy chapter 28 and verse I'm sorry Deuteronomy 8 uh Deuteronomy 8 and verse 10 is where I want to begin I want you to notice these uh these words and God is and as many of the times in Deuteronomy they're getting ready to go into um into the land and God is admonishing them this is not only the season to take the land to go into it but he's also admonishing them of uh everything that they must do but also things that can actually uh come up that will hinder uh God from really doing what he wants to do in their life and I I want to say it like like this we know that we're we're in the hour thank you Paul we're in the hour where we're not called as the prophet said to a station meaning that the church in the days of Luther they were called back to there was God was working uh uh towards that of restoration but he called him into justification that was it right then here comes more of the word coming into Saint that's another station then the baptism of of of the Holy Ghost there at isza Street gifts are being restored that's another station but the bride's not called to another station there's not another message that's to come that's right we we now are coming into the place coming into the full inheritance and Christ Living in a people of God that he himself has Redeemed by his blood and where that in this hour God himself where he's longed for through all of the ages is to express himself as he did in the groom and through that first first little space of time that took place before the first church age ever opened that's good that's what God is bringing us back to that's that's Rapture condition where our lives are sealed away where there's within our hearts there's nothing in our hearts that would say nay or anything to God's word it would say Amen so be it so not only what we would say here but our whole lives even as God comes to uh correct us or and he has there is needs for correction in our our life as we're growing but the whole purpose is that we grow into the full stature of a perfect man amen don't you love him amen verse verse 10 here I don't mean to keep you standing but I want to just just feel to say that in verse 10 when thou Hast eaten and art full then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good which he hath given thee amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we are standing here father this morning uh in a great need of your mercies once again Lord Jesus you certainly see father every every need Lord that's upon the hearts of your children father and we lord are asking God for your grace that you would help us that we collectively Lord can step aside father from just this physical address this morning Lord to also Lord to go beyond just the Lord the circumstances that would surround us Lord things that we would even know that we have before us things that are upon our hearts Lord we ask oh God that Lord that you would just give us Grace to move beyond all of those things Lord in your presence Lord where we lord receive the strength the direction the admition the leadership Lord for our lives that Lord then all of these other things Lord God you give us Lord the very uh Lord the ministering to the needs of all of these things to just show yourself Lord strong on our behalf oh God that you're mindful of every need and every request that we would have upon our hearts Lord for it's in even in these situations and things that arise that you permit Lord according to your Infinite Wisdom that you might display your glory Lord and father to recognize that we might recognize our weakness Lord and our need of you father we just invite you Lord that you would come be the speaker Lord be the hearer help us Lord to see where that our lives might be picked up Lord and where to apply these things for there is certainly the desire that moves in our hearts Lord we want to be found ready Lord our longing dear God is to father that as you come Lord we want to go with you Lord we just love you Lord we thank you for your mercies now may you come Among Us Lord and may you have complete preeminence we pray father in every heart every thought Lord every word that's said now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're being seated amen so I want to I want to if we could let's just continue to read uh that portion there in in the scripture in in uh the book of Deuteronomy there and I I want you just to to notice this this admonition there from where we read in verse 10 when when thou Hast eaten and Artful keep on going with the scriptures please when when thou Hast eaten and Artful then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee we we always the Bible says let everything be received with prayer and Thanksgiving and we would look at that and and think in one way to understand that before that even as we are seeking God's will upon many things but then even after we have as we've sought his will and when we recognize his leadership has come and then even as uh the direction in our lives and as God would provide and all of those things spiritually naturally all of the covering every part of our life that is a very key important time then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God are you are you with me so it's it's it's a it's something that we don't want to be found like remember there was 10 lepers nine all 10 of them were healed but there was only one who came back and said thank you and he worshiped and we don't ever want to we we don't want to be in that place and I I'll just say because we don't want to be in that place but we need God's grace always to bring us into that place and to remind us that we are what we are and where we are because of God's grace uh you know even through every aspect of our life so let me just continue to read here to kind of set this a little this background a little bit this morning in verse 11 it says beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God in not keeping his Commandments and his judgments and his statutes which I command thee this day lest when thou Hast eaten and art full and Hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is Multiplied and all that thou Hast is Multiplied then thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage who led thee through the great and terrible Wilderness wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought and where there was no water who brought thee for forth out of the rock of Flint who fed thee in the wilderness with Mana which thy fathers knew not that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do to do thee good at the latter end now that that word is would speak of as God would humble us it isn't this and I I'm just going to purposely say it it's not God degrading his people that's not how God humbles your eye but the way that God will humble your eye is to just let us see that our Humanity does not have the ability or the strength to bring to pass or to even bring us to where he has called us to to it must be him completely it's our Reliance on him now that it doesn't mean that we're just we're setting around we're being pushed we're being pulled but we're being led as the children of God because that's that's the difference remember uh cattle are hurted but sheep are LED we're we're not we're not cattle we're led by a Shepherd he's there to lead us we're not as goats that just you know we'll go find our own way but as a sheep now the thing of it is is that here within the midst of our life we were always uh sheep or Lamb of God and that's what the Holy Spirit comes to work upon he's not he's not come to change uh the goat and to make the goat a lamb no God has come to reveal what is UN beneath in our life and that is that part of him this is why when the word is come open and the and the seals are taken off this is why that our names are recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life it is his character his life what God's desire is that's being expressed that our hearts would lying to our hearts would be drawn to it would be God coming and turning around our will our desires to match his mind his thought what he desired so that when when when he has had his way in our life it might be able to be said and declared that it is Christ himself on display making his will known through our lives remember even with Israel going through their journey in the wilderness that it would even be expressed God would say that as they would live by the word that they were privileged to receive Moab was not privileged to have a true prophet of God other nations were not privileged to have a true prophet of God but in here in this and remember there were those who uh had a true prophet of God came out they were baptized in in the Red Sea unto Moses they walked by the cloud they ate Mana they drank water but they did not esteem the privilege to take into account why is all of this happening they were not able David said it like this our fathers understood not the Miracles which God did God was not just there to work miracles that's that's why when we recognize the ministry of Malachi 4 this is not a Ministry that is just a Ministry of Miracles but it is God coming to confirm his word and how do we know that that's his word what does The Voice say after the miracle has been done after the sign if the voice does not speak in harmony with God's word and leads us back to a man-made idea and takes us away from the word God never sent that remember that's a key key statement because the scripture says that false Christ would deceive many false anointed anointed even with a genuine Spirit even those like in the days of Micaiah remember it was a lying spirit that came upon those prophets that were there they were prophets but let me just tell you no matter who a man is I don't care who he is I don't care what his last name is I don't care how long he's preached it always should always be a place to look and say is this the word amen the Bibles didn't say try Every Man's last name it is say try every man to see if he's got the right picture try and see if he's got the right cliches and I don't mean to make light as though things are cliches but the Bible said try every spirit amen is that right cuz sometimes the wrong Spirits can get in right that's very true friends that's why we we have to be in the diligence doesn't mean that we sat around and we're apprehensive and we're uh you know like brother talks about the Canadian people up north and even he says pastors he said pastors are many times very conservative people he said they they're sat there they want to know what's coming in amongst their flocks what's what's being said and what certain things and he says you know he said but yet at sometimes we can be too conservative to where that it actually would just actually stifle out the moving of the Holy Spirit now I'm going to tell you I believe in the moving of the Holy Spirit but I welcome him to move according to his word is that all right that that's what because outside of that we recognize that look God will always he comes to move us in his word if he as brother REM said it over and over if he will just do what and fulfill every promise that he's given me in his word he said that will satisfy me amen how about you amen that's that's the blessing in this hour so when I when I'm looking at this on on all of this of of where we are standing in this moment and God is letting him know where he has brought them through where he has brought them from and he says in verse uh verse verse 17 and thou shalt say in thine heart my power all Verse 18 my power and my might my of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth my this is right away this is already something that where it begins to look at that what has been attributed around that that my power my might my my perseverance my my strength has gotten me this and God's letting them know no the only thing to remember even for you to have strength to put One Foot In Front Of Another it because God has encouraged you or I it's because God has has has given us what we have need of to obtain the things that he has even entrusted us with and I'll just say it like this I think we can all Fellowship on this point Lord you know what I have me of you know what I'm able to handle so I don't want anything but your will because anything that's outside of your will you know I would not be able to handle it it would become a hindrance in my life and my walk and would hinder you from fulfilling what you desire to do through me so just give me what I [Applause] need amen and if he does that my it'll be more than what we could even ask or think but notice as God would go on to say thou shalt remember the Lord thy God for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his Covenant which he swear unto thy Fathers as it is this day so God's desire is that he says I want to make known what I have said through Abraham and through the prophets I want to make that known through you but we have but you must stay in a place to where I can make my word make myself make the blessings in other words we we don't want to be people that all all of a sudden we get to looking at what's happening around us and the blessings and as though that we ourselves are something that we have done something it's not us that has done something the Bible said let us be mindful we are the Sheep of his pasture it is not us that has changed our lives it is Christ that has changed our lives amen I know this is very very very simple but as the Lord just pressing Upon Our Hearts and it says in verse 19 and it shall be if thou will do all if thou do it all forget the Lord thy God and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that ye shall utterly perish as the Nations which the Lord destroyed before your face so shall you perish because you would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God God gave God gives a complete warning there to Israel and I I think of the first part when we open up if you want to go ahead uh switch it over there for me I want you to think of this here that how that within this on the overcoming of hindrances and how things so subtly you know Satan he doesn't care brother bab says it like this he says he doesn't care he says if he can he can hold you back from it or he can push you beyond where you need to be and pushing you beyond means meaning that you get way out here and we're not staying no longer in humility under the leading of the Holy Spirit and you know that we see examples of that through the scriptures we see examples then all the way through uh uh the New Testament and the Old Testament but God's desire is to keep us or that we would remain in a place to where he can work through our lives and let me just say it for we need the help of the Holy Spirit I'm just going to say it like that there's none of us can take trophies or ribbons or Metals as though to say well I have done this and I did this that God himself might be glorified in our lives I believe with all of my heart there is the simplest of things that we can do to continue to present ourselves before God but God even sees deeper than what we think of ourselves in our own mind and God knows what it takes within our lives to keep us in a place to where we are in position looking up to him who's the author and the finisher of our faith he knows exactly how to do that and here when you think about it you know as the scripture read out about how that you know when thou Hast eaten and art full I I think every one of us can uh uh think of that in a manner that how it feels when you're full sometimes you get sluggish it it's a time you probably need to get we need to go out and walk right but yet we feel like man if I can just make it to the chair if I can just make it from the table to the chair if I can just and we get sluggish our our body and and things you know that it just starts to bog down and God noticed when thou art eaten and are full that sometimes when we become full then we become sluggish we become slow we become you say you might say well I I'm praying every day and I'm and I I think friends listen the little things like that I I'm not making light of that those are little things that don't ever underestimate the little things that are done in that way because I just heard the prophet say this morning as he said it's those things he said of feeding on the word of God he says as you feed on God's word he said pray every day read your Bible he said because reading the word of God is what gives the Holy Spirit the ammo to work in your life so we don't want to you know go about that but neither do we want things to just become a tradition and a checklist because serving God is not a checklist he's our everything GL these are everything as a matter of fact can I say it like this the only reason we have things on our checklist is because of him it's because of him and I want to just you know look at it like this I wanted to create a visual and I was trying to in my mind just as it was coming to me of to look at it in this way that if we look at our lives and our walk with God you know we have all such things now they sell them you know a dime dozen organizers and they have little things you know and you can put this label here label here label here and it helps you to organize things you know pencils here pens here paper there line paper here folders all these different things that that we can do maybe in the laundry room you've got stain remover you got this you got that and there's certain things and maybe you don't have in drawers you just got them organized the way you put them on your washing machine or dryer but you get the point that sometimes things are so organized out and we've got this here and got that here but you got to remember and this is what we always have to keep before us is that God should never become a be limited to a compartment in our life he he don't want to he listen he'll take whatever we give him right you'll never find you'll never find God grumbling and complaining but all God's desire is is what he wants to do in your life in other words when he as he is coming fully in as we give ourselves fully to him God lets us know I've got your back I've got everything covered no matter what comes up I've got it covered because I am in control of your life I promise that I'll never fail you I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I am your provider I am your sustainer he was letting Israel know right here that when you got out in the wilderness I was there to show you that when you didn't even think of certain things I was there you didn't think of water but I was your water water I knew you need water you didn't think of food but I already thought of it you did not think of clothing but I already provided that not one thread would wear through your shoes wouldn't wear out I've already got the things covered that you haven't even consider or thought about hallelujah how powerful is that that God watching over every part of it oh I tell you no wonder is God comes around in our lives the Holy Spirit dealing with our hearts to help us and Deliver Us from those times of sluggishness anybody like fing sluggish no I hate that I'm just being honest I don't like that feeling at all I don't like the feeling where you you eat and you feel bloated and you feel like you're miserable sometimes it isn't about the amount you've eating it's just the stuff you've ate right I mean you just you know but God help us in these places and he does help us to remember that I am your everything and so with back to those compartments we don't want to look at at we don't want to walk or look at our walk with God as though it's just this part of my life and then I've got these other things but if we can look at it in the right way and God help us to see it in this way and always keep it there to imagine it so that it's just like this that all of this right here it's him but we want to always be looking in him to see what step to make next next in other words when it comes whether it's to jobs with relationships friends whatever if I've got to look outside of him I don't need it I want to know what does he say because if it's in him then not only will it be a blessing to me but I'll be able to do or receive whatever he said and be a blessing to somebody else that's where we want to keep it in that way right watch this in the scripture very familiar scripture I am the vine you are the branches and he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing say Amen to that it's true Lord I can do nothing without you you might say well I have a degree but who gave you the ability who gave you that Talent amen who gave you the gift that's in your life that you didn't even know was there that's right who gave who who placed that God placed that in you and then God begin to bring all of that begins to be brought out of your life because God is Jehovah Gyra he will not be indebted to nobody he has already provided for himself what he's placed in your life all even the I'm talking about even the natural abilities God has placed it there even for the word work we do for the things that we do God has placed that there if we're really really honest it's not a school that taught us these things I sat there in teacher courses that when we were going through and I had some people that were really you know they were they were breaking down and and they were we had such a meeting I didn't know what the meeting was about and a rush in there and these individuals they're they're just you know they're they're really CU they feel like I'm not getting I feel like I'm everything's not coming together and I feel like this and I I'm just being honest I was Sting right there and I thought well you know I really don't feel that way I don't know really what to say uh to them but you know this is what then eventually I listen to everything that was said because you know they were complaining about the professors and they didn't do enough and they didn't do the and and it what just struck my heart and I I I just said it in this way I said look I said I think I understand what you all are saying that sometimes you're wanting to say you want more Direction I said but you got to understand what they're doing is giving us a framework and within that framework this is where your certain talents your certain things the way that you bring things about that's how that's to thrive I said let me just say it to you that here I am I said in this with with all the rest of you my colleagues but I want you to understand yes I'll have to have this certification in order to obtain a job I said but you know what I was always a teacher that's right I was always a teacher I said they they they are not making me a teacher they're just helping me to tap in to a framework of thinking of how to be a teacher that's why they're making us do the extensive things on lesson plans that end up being for one subject 45 minutes end up being three pages long it's reflective thought when in reality when you go to teach you get to a spot I've got one sentence of an objective and then it's just 45 minutes long and more than that you see one thing but what it is cuz see the framework has taught us to be reflective my point point is is this what God has placed in you even in our natural abilities that's the same way it is spiritually in your life this is why that there's things in our life when we look at spiritually that God has called us to operate in the framework of the Holy Ghost we're not to operate outside of that but God in Christ God came down and ex and exemplified you once an example of what he's called you and I to be in the body of Jesus Christ so it's so in other words what follow now it's not you or me trying to replicate someone else but it's seeking after God for all that God would have you be that's part of the journey is Lord bring out of my life where that hunger is coming from where that thirst is coming from I didn't put that there but there's a hunger there's a deep there's a longing for God there's a desire for more of God and so in the framework of the Holy Spirit we can call call upon God and that in itself is the beginnings of humility to look to him good Hallelujah without me you can do nothing right I want to just take maybe for a few moments here of this example this is very key if you abide in me that word dwell or remain in me and my words abide in you these are his words his thoughts right how many times that where the word of God after the word has been expressed and it's been spoken I I'm dealing with this on hindrance I'm dealing with this on Pride I want you just to I want you just to think about this just say God just speak to my heart if ye abide in me this is dwelling in him the scripture says if we if we live in him if my life your life has been immersed into Christ and if it hasn't fully yet just say just say to the Lord like every one of us would say Lord take me deeper take me deeper to every desire is rid from my life you know what that is as here his presence is around and dealing with our life it's asking God to go deeper in our lives but as we live in him let us also walk in him that's where Paul says for if we walk in him you shall not fulfill the lust of of the flesh that's that's our power that's our source of strength not our knowledge no yet yet we do need knowledge we need Holy Ghost knowledge of the word is that right we need that we need the spirit of God but listen when God gives us Divine knowledge it will always be a revelation and there's Faith accompanied with that knowledge and between that faith and knowledge is virtue is strength in our life for that word to live out in our life but if you abide in me and my words abide in you think about it taking taking after a service after a service after the ministry and the word is over what what what do we do do we take that and just say that was a wonderful service today man there was some good things that was said there or do we recognize that wait a minute all of those things can be true because it's things that pertain to us but what are we doing with that word are we taking that word just even right there as the service itself has come coming down and really praying over that where he's touched our hearts and saying God be it unto me Lord according to your word I don't want to let it slip out because let me tell you something the prophet tells us in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said God is trying to reveal himself to you but we let so many things get it out of us that's why we want to say Lord let it be drilled down deep this is why even in the after service even in the worship this is why it's it's a time of entering into prayer it's a time of real solemnness why that the word this is why the prophet said after the word has gone forth let the Holy Spirit Come and water that word in the trth Sam what are you saying don't stop seeking after him don't stop seeking after him we if we've grown beyond that we've grown beyond God if you abide in me so the words even as they dwell in our lives and we're taking them day by day I want you just I want to just take this little little portion I realize I'm not going to get all the way through into the next part and I really didn't think I would here in this today but just in this part staying with the real kernel and you you know what a konel is it's the it's the life of that seed what that life is all about staying with the real kernel of it we don't want to get caught up in all of this out here I want to stay with the real Colonel because if we're stay with the right colel then everything everything else all that God desires to add he'll add are you with me you know because we don't have to add the feathers the feathers will come out we don't have to manufacture wool the wool will come out so notice here in the scripture there's a man and we're familiar many of us as Bible readers are familiar with this this man by the name of Uzziah and the Bible says as he was 16 years old when he took the reign of the throne and the Bible says in verse four he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that his father amazi did and he sought God in the days of Zachariah who had understanding in the visions of God and as long as he sought the Lord God made him to prosper now what was the key as long as he sought the Lord but when when when he would pull back from seeking the Lord then that's when things themselves was ass signed of something already going on are you with me now sometimes the things that can be seen out here remember are only attributes of what's going on inwardly so here is here is Uzziah and God has made him to prosper this man was he was a great man even at 16 years old and you have to wonder within the scripture where Paul would talk about let not a young one you know coming to that place of rulership and Leadership Paul would write in Timothy lest he said like a novice lest they become lifted up in Pride you know it's something about that through age and Through Time really through not just time I want to say it like this because time itself may change how we look outwardly but time alone doesn't change who we are it it takes the Holy Spirit coming and working with our lives through tests and through trials and as we are yielded and he will mold us and make us that's where real wisdom is real wisdom isn't in that we don't have hair or you've got Bray hair or that we're a certain year a certain o age or you know we're 65 years old or what that that that does not attribute always to wisdom because remember ELO sat right there when there were other Brethren with job and he said he was he respected his elders and he said I I looked at let age speak but he saw ell who could see that it wasn't any wisdom that was coming but Earthly wisdom that's right is that right and really our desire is is that we will we desire Lord I want that effect of that Heavenly wisdom upon my life amen so it's through the the multitude of our test and our trials now listen friends we can Fellowship on this there's there's individuals We've ran into that because of circumstances of life that there's not there's things that within their life instead of instead of allowing the grace of God to come and really seek after God to remedy anything that would be in their life instead of after all it's said and done they become bitter and there's no benefit their lives themselves in their lives it begins a destruction in their life and then it also is things that has an effect whether it's on family whether it's on others we don't want our lives crowned with bitterness Hallelujah no matter of the bitter experiences let's separate that now there are bitter experiences but experiences that would come our way or an opportunity to recognize God though I don't see you but like you showed Moses show me yourself Lord so that I can bring you into this place in my life for you will sweeten the Waters of Mara cuz then we all have bitter experiences we all have those kinds of failures we all have those things but listen don't allow bitter experiences to corrupt you that is so good don't allow them to where you become better in your life say God give me Grace let the sweetness of the holy spirit let me stay in the presence there of almighty God that he'll sweeten the waters in my life is that right because Waters themselves can represent a thickness in multitudes of people is that right we need his grace to sweeten our Liv but look at look at Uzziah the Bible says in verse verse 15 I'm skipping on down on that chapter he made in Jerusalem engines this man was a very uh Ingenuity had much Ingenuity about him he invented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bullworks to shoot arrows and great stones with all and his name spread far abroad for he was marvelously helped till he was strong but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction so for he transgressed against the Lord his God and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense let's just watch how brother Brown will will take this here many places how many familiar brother bran preaches on influence countless times influence one of another it's is a is a real key message in this hour cuz this is listen when you're listening to the message of the hour I'm not going to let you read it ahead of me when you're listening to the message of the hour I want you to understand those titles are not brainstorming operations amen it is it is announcements by God it's what God is Desiring to do in our lives it's what God is calling us out from the influence of man-made ideas calling us away from the influence of of of of our own even of our own reasoning into where that we become completely under the influence of the Holy Spirit by the new birth and ever remain there praise the Lord notice this when a man or woman no matter whether he's a bishop or a cardinal so position don't matter whatever he might be when you begin to feel that you are self-reliant then you better begin to watch watch and take heed so it's even you know that in itself is a real blessing to where when when you and I could begin to feel I feel you know I'm starting to feel self-reliant well well how do I know what's the diagnosis that I'm actually going about my day without seeking him well brother Samuel I you know I'm driving in the car God's not restricted to a prayer closet the Bible said pray without ceasing even when you're getting ready to go into work it's things listen even when for myself let me give you an example even when I as I was teaching school I had taught fractions and Division and those things countless times I know it seems like that seems like ABC things but listen for when I'm teaching nine and 10 year olds sometimes every year that seem to be challenging things and I would ask God Lord help me with this subject here in teaching because these are different students if there's a way that I need to present it if there's a certain way Lord give me the wisdom on how to do it I could have just taken it and said you know what I know how to do do it I could just go in and do it it would be like myself as a teacher okay as myself as a teacher you get to a spot you're like H I've already taught I've already taught 15 years fourth grade I know this like the back of my hand I know where we're going next I know what's coming next I can finish this quote I mean I already know what's coming here and then it begins to just be like I don't need to put any effort in that's so good I don't need to put any it's like a minister that gets to such a place to where that he feels like he has such a handle on the word that's a real real dangerous place because when he gets to that spot he not only you begin to see it in the way that it can actually begin to present itself to the people it begins to look at it that I'm here you're down here but to recognize there's never to be a place I know sometimes we use that but to understand it in the manner of that I'm talking about being getting a handle on the word of God it really is to where that God got a handle on our lives and where the revelation itself has got a handle on our lives and to recognize I I don't know how you feel but this is how I feel I don't have less questions I've got more questions my questions are not whether this is the Vindicated truth or not that is not it at all but there are things that as I go on in steud I'm just telling the Lord that here this week as I was walking through here praying I said Lord within that certain quote that you opened up there's also another part within there Lord would you teach me and show me even as I was praying on some things with Ruth and the gate and all of those things show me Lord help me to see it Lord in the way that you want me to see it in order to bring it you say what do you say that it doesn't matter there's many quotes that I have that God would allow my memory I could spit right out to you but even though in the times that I would know him I still want to look back over him when he brings things if there's a subject if there's a topic because you know why with God there is no end there is no no Summit in God the very moment that we feel like we've got a handle on it I've got a handle on this message is the very moment we're backslid let me just share something with you even over the years oh yeah I've had Satan come right up next to me and say look at you you're understanding of this right here why you don't need to quote brother Brenham you don't you don't need to go through this look at how your understanding of the scriptures you say what did you say I said you liar I would not even understand these things had God not sent his prophet and the spirit of God revealing through his ordained Channel I would be like anybody else I would have the word on a new card but because of the grace of God and God sending a prophet with thus sayith the Lord From The Throne then we have a confidence to follow because I see it it's in my heart and I see it what working this gospel [Applause] Works Hallelujah I'm not relying upon my understanding the Bible said lean not to thine own understanding I don't care how much we know of the scriptures I still want God to make his word alive and to make it real we still need the holy ghost coming as strong or stronger than ever in the midst of our services let me tell you something brother or sister the third pull did not remove the moving of the Holy Ghost man removed that man's ideas that shows there's a lack of that Revelation because the real third pull is Christ himself in The Believer deity coming to Tabernacle inside of you God calling you and I to a deeper walk a deeper humility a deeper submission am Hallelujah prise the Lord and that of the third three pools it may be terminology a little new to you but Jesus first pull he went out Miracles were done second pull the healings were done Miracles but the third pole is where he makes a stand except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood in other words become one with the God who is making himself known by his promised [Music] word become one with him not just sit around where the blessings are but to become one with him become one with him and let him work out in our life and it's him it's him we're growing we don't start out fully matured Sons and Daughters of God we grow in Grace and knowledge can you say Amen to that but we we don't want to grow in knowledge and then in Grace it won't work right because if you grow in knowledge first you really won't grow Grace but as you grow in Grace remember staying in a place that Lord you're my everything you're all that I have need of then God can add to us he will speak to us not Earthly knowledge not just knowledge to where we have enough knowledge about scriptures to argue it it won't come that way it will come by the divine grace of God moving down in our life by the sweetness of the Holy Spirit it will become an absolute action in our lives notice my God won't let you go like that aren't you glad because he will not share his glory with anyone no sir God takes Glory alone sometimes God can bless a man and give him a little Ministry and that's maybe a little bit better than his Brethren or not better but just something a little different from his Brethren and the first thing you know that man becomes exalted with his chest out he would brush you off the street that's the time that I believe that man is started out the door cuz God can't use a person like that so you mean God would actually entrust someone that maybe be a little bit more gifted in a certain way and God would present that now he's not God listen me tell you God's not afraid of his sheep he's not because remember we're a part of him the Bible said there would be those they said the elect with what was going on the elect they would be deceived if it were possible but it's not possible because we are a part of the word your mind or your thoughts might be getting around and might look at this and might look at that you might say well I know this has been said and this was done and they said this they spoke this and God answered this and did this and did this but listen don't get caught up in what all the signs and wonders right is that what God warned him in Deuteronomy he said do not he said you listen to what they're saying right listen to what they're saying because listen because signs and wonders just that alone if it's not coming with you say saying what they said yes it's not us putting an interpretation to God's word it's not us coming and all of a sudden we've studied the message long enough and I'm able to tell you what brother brandham meant here this is Brother bram's opinion here this is Brother bram's opinion here let me tell you what that is self-righteous Pride that's right right refusing to stay in a god-given position doesn't matter how long that we preach the word doesn't matter how long we walked with the word look it would be just like you as a husband or wife or family that all of a sudden here in coming and fellowshipping under the word of God and then you would begin to go in and dissect the word of God and somehow splice the token life as though it don't apply here it does apply there oh this isn't necessary that's just a little fanatical that's just a little over theboard where did you get your Vindication or leadership to go in that way there is no peace or safety in that but there is peace and safety in staying with the word of God hallelujah when battles come your way Trials come your way I see as he rose up there zedekiah when they were all compassed about with battles and it says they that heed to the pro of God to God's word that God will strengthen and prosper his people hallelujah you believe that that's so good but see how it can come just one little slight little thing oh and it can be so subtle how Pride will come in let me tell you something I don't care who the man is I don't care how long he's been preaching I don't care what his name is no man has a right to assert himself over the Vindicated message of the hour when a man begins to put his ideas to that right there that man if he don't quickly if he don't take take the grace of God that's com into his life he is on his way out the door I don't care how many followers he has I don't care all those other things listen cuz God will not share his glory with no personality listen friends our strength what what was uzziah's strength how did Uzziah pick out that this man's got a gift in his life to build these certain types of engines and and catapults and and this who was it that gifted him in that way he was 16 years old it was the grace of God he was doing all that God had showed through his father amaziah and when he was doing that God blessed he blessed it that's right strongholds were built up but then as it got to a place he got the note doubt maybe maybe it was just a whisper whisper that came in look at you man you've done a lot better than the rest of the Kings look at you look how things have been built up man look at how everything is going it's just so so wonderful you know what happened he got his eyes to looking upon the things that had come about from when he was really keeping his eyes on God he got his eyes on things instead of keeping it on God did you hear me he got eyes and looking at these things because look look look look that that's where the church Worlds at today oh God's blessing us how do you know he gave us a we we got a we got a mega building we got this we got that God's really blessing us and look there's times where God will show blessings in that way but listen the only thing that we can actually have a true litmus test we could go into the doctor and say I feel good everything's great and whatever more but scans and tests do not lie that's right no matter how good we feel so that's the same thing about even when it comes to our feelings it's got to come to a place to where we we say God there's the desire is to be with you be in step with you in such a way that I do not want my feelings to influence me I want the word to influence me I want to know where am I standing God be honest with me Lord take men of God take brothers and sisters Lord show me Lord I want to see in your word when I'm in times of o when I'm listening to the message of the hour that it just does not become just something that's just keeps on it's just natural it becomes tradition I don't want it to be a tradition God restore to me Lord God that that love that I had Lord that first love that I had Lord where you're reaching out to God yes sir everybody okay let me just I I want to read the words how the prophet says it he says this King got to a place being such a great man and influencing Isaiah so he was an influence on Isaiah's life and the righteous of course of his kingdom he got to a place he got feeling self-cured and there's where you make your mistake there is where so many righteous men bite the dust of Shame bite of dust of defeat is because they begin to feel self-secure you begin to think now notice notice where it starts thinking that you have lived so long for Christ that no matter what he presents before you you'll take your choice whether you want to or not now remember God might have a variety of ways to present that to you and I God can work right through his offices think about it God will work right through the gifts that he's placed right here among us to minister to us to see that we don't miss the word of God and I would just say like this I believe that as real people of God I'm not telling you just to take my word for it I don't want to come up here and preach Samuel Browning's thoughts but if there's something in there that just seems like to you that Lord I I maybe don't see this but help me to see it that's seeking after God seeking after God doesn't mean that you understand everything no more than it does that I understand everything God has it in such a way that he'll keep so much that he'll keep you and I seeking after him reaching out for him I'm glad he does it that way I'm glad that he just doesn't drop everything all at once because you know what we would battle sluggishness more than we do right now but God knows how to keep us in a place of humility it's always incredible sometimes after the greatest victories in our lives where we praise the Lord and are so thankful we can also become the most vulnerable because it isn't that we will say well no I don't believe in the Lord I don't trust the Lord but sometimes through our actions where we neglect certain little things that it begins to show Lord I've got this when it gets to a place in our prayer life it just starts it's almost like hit and miss now come on now I'm getting right down where the rubber meets the road see these are things like this that listen we don't want to allow the enemy to hand us well this is circumstances of life but it's not remember remember he's not a compartment in our life he's to be our life if there's if there's something that I that is outside of him we don't want it but see it can start just with simple little things in our life it can get to a place to where we get into a spot where we're no longer living living by faith in God's word the prophet goes into this right here we actually start living by reasoning well God understands my plight God understands where I'm at and then you find that all of a sudden that things it really doesn't seem to have the same diligence in coming to the house of God to to to being with the saints of God as it used to now listen friends let me stop right here there's many many many that have made many of us have made sacrifices Through The Years where individuals actually called called away from family or or took when maybe there was meetings or something coming on would actually take away time and say God I'm looking for you to do something Lord in a real special way Lord father I need a real touch from you but look as time goes on if we're not careful it becomes as though that we're just expecting him to fly over and drop what we have need of so good and yet we do Minister that he does Supply our needs but God wants you and I to seek after him he knows we got needs but how much greater it is that when we can say Lord I need you I need you it shouldn't be that our prayer life has got less it ought to be even greater now at the coming of the Lord the Bible says as you see that day approaching even the more so forsake not to assemble yourselves together but see just a little by little little by little little by little pride can get in there see pride itself has so many different ways that if not for the spirit of God and the grace of God Discerning in our lives and helping us to see it friends it would just continue to work all the way through our lives but aren't you glad for for the grace of God Hey listen friends every one of us need this grace in our lives God helping us to see these little things watch this brother says you got to continue to serve God that's what we're really talking about there no matter what you was back 10 years ago right thank God for what you were 10 years ago but what are you today that that's what matters God's not going to Rapture you or I because of what we were last year that's right five years ago but what are we today what are we today have you know that's why have we got to such a place and I say friends we I I'm including here with us it's an an admonition that in our lives this is not the word of God has not caused us to pull back from seeking after him but when he's making himself known right here Among Us he's touching our hearts he's touching Our Lives it ought to be a moment to say God you that has touched my life you that has come walk the AIS you minister to my heart oh God how I remember those days Lord God when you would sweep down with your presence Lord and I would just yield to you instead of looking at my watch oh boy come on Friends yes sir littleness said just you can get in there so s so little says what you are now he said the king got to a place that he thought within himself he got lifted up and pride got in his heart that to me that that statement right there is a real key statement Pride got in his heart you know many of us have heard this quoted quite some time you can go look it up you most you got the app and things like that let me just say it'd be good for you if there's certain things that you see that's quoted right here maybe a certain message go listen to that message there's certain things you see quoted write it down and then go look it up in your app and say I'm want to read the all the context that goes all around that because I tell you what God will continue to speak you know who it was that'll lead you to go even read that quote in the message the same holy spirit that was bringing our attention to it because he wants to do it even in a more personal way with you I because it's a personal walk it's not about everything I get I got to get it from Samuel brownie no you're not getting anything from Samuel brownie anything you've got you got it from God and it's because God gave Grace to this guy right here is so ignorant and to be able to step out of the way that he could step down and speak to us Pride got in his heart this is why brother Bram says like this he said you may said he said every one of us he said you've got a Punch coming at you he said weakness and if you just type this in weakness and blood punch he said he's got a Punch coming at you he said but you know where that weakness is that's right he said it might be a physical condition it might be son he goes down through a whole list of things actually in 65 Christ revealing his own word is a real good study on it and he goes into it and he says and what would you rather would you rather you didn't know that there was a Punch coming and didn't know where it was where where it was going to come at and try to hit you at or would you rather know and say Lord keep me covered with the blood he said you must keep that part covered with the blood at all times how many know that's true am listen friends that that's part of our journey that's part of our walk with God let me just step back from here just a moment this is why that in in our walk with God and and when the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come that is the victory in our soul to where it is overcome the desire of sin and through that overthrowing of the Kingdom in our life it gives us the strength to subdue all of the influences that would want to come out here the pools that Satan would want to make upon a life right and see what it is you've got a judgment seat then the Judgment seat is no longer out here you're not waiting till you come to the house of God Alone even though the Judgment should begin at the house of God but remember when the Holy Ghost has come into your life the Judgment seat of God has now become tabernacled in your heart that is beautiful yes sir is that right and you know what God God don't need you don't need to come to the house of God to all of a sudden receive correction but if we somehow kind of push it back and say well you know I don't know I I don't I just kind of just kind of push it and just kind of you know this or that then and all of a sudden the spirit of God think of God in humility are you here with me think of God in humility God is not like we talked about last week parental Pride where he looks around and he's got pictures of all of us and says they are nothing but the sweetest Darlings they don't ever do anything wrong I mean every time they walk it's like powdered sugar dropping out of their shoes no God knows you and I better than that we are his children and he's not going to let us get by with one thing in our lives because why he's got an expected end for us all the discipline all the correction is about that goal of the Rapture that we come back to what God has intended you and I to be so God God is Not Too Proud to come down and say my children not my children not my sweet Little Darlings not my boy not my daughter oh no they're perfect no God is a faithful father he does not in other words God is not ashamed when he has to come down and correct us am think about it he would in his humility he would come down and correct us that to me in itself is such great humility let alone him coming down and living in a body of humiliation going to a cross where he was humiliated right but then coming down in services and dealing in our lives and he doesn't come down and say you should know this how many times have you heard this how many quotes have you heard read on this how many no he comes because you know why he knows that we are but flesh and his desire is to so live his life out through you and I that he comes and makes known the hindrances that we in our finite mind cannot catch without the Holy Spirit that's good preaching yes sir but Pride God in his heart maybe it started out with a little pinhole it just started coming in drip drip drip and then eventually his life it just started filling up maybe it started filling up to where that when he was going to hear the ministry he just thought I don't I don't need to go along with that that's just a little over the top kept filling up kept filling up until eventually he thought I can be my own Shepherd I don't need the ministry I don't you know what even with what God has sent through his Prophet I know what the Holy Spirit has spoke and sure go to going in that way and all of a sudden Satan will supply certain quotes I could even tell you where some of those quotes will come from right where brother brandham even the certain things that he made even regarding certain statements and so forth even in he that is in you and and see how Satan will start feeding those things along let me just tell you something this message was not meant for you and I to try to figure it out God never sent this message for ministers to prove it he's already done it but real true gifted God called men listen they when when God begins to speak through that message listen he will be taking that message and being able to see it right down through the scriptures see it right down through the Bible I believe looking I'm not ashamed to quote the prophet of God I believe you're not ashamed to hear that because let me tell you something here with when you look at it as I can refer right back to these things you know that's not brother Samuel's idea he didn't read that from Matthew Henry's commentary he didn't read that from John Gil I thank God for those men of God but listen friends we had to have a prophet of God in this hour so it was not just man looking and probing but where God would take truth and gather truth in and say this is my truth that I spoke through this man spoke through this man spoke through this man is no longer a wondering Hallelujah the amen has spoken thank you Lord yes sir but notice brother Bram says how things will continue let me just get down to this application of it can I have a few more moments watch out the application I I love this with the message of the hour brother said you take a family that'll start going to church God will heal that little family he will bless them give them the holy spirit in their life the little children will pray around the table they'll pray before they go to bed mother and father will join hands and pray and as long as they continue like that they'll stay a family Hallelujah but the first thing you know they didn't have nothing an old junk car maybe riding around in or maybe walking how many remember that uh I remember my wife and I got married my dad was riding with my wife and our that blue car we had the transmission was slipping hey I didn't have the money I didn't have the money you know you go to push the gas and it just catch you [Laughter] know that's good my dad was riding he was riding with my wife the one time that happened at an intersection and my dad looked over at her and said how long has this been doing that I wasn't trying to be neglectful I always take my cars and stff the shop but I just didn't have the money it was old I didn't have the money you know to do it I I I hate credit I don't like credit and things like that I I just didn't I didn't have money I said Lord I I don't know what to do but I remember he said how long has this been like this so you know what it kind of it kind of makes me appreciate just a car that I don't have to worry about that trans transmission it kind of makes me appreciate because we had that car and then my dad let us use his brown truck that that Brown GMC truck and you know what you could never tell how much gas it had in it cuz the gas thing didn't work it was two wheel drive so look out when it's snow on the road I mean my wife did a donut right there at Perkins Avenue in 250 right there right on the Road God the grace of God you know but you didn't know so what did you do every time you pass a gas station you figure wait a minute 1 2 3 4 five times a school I I probably going to get some gas right now and you go you know you put gas in there and it just stay right in the same spot but you know what when I look back in many of those times right there I had such wonderful times with him yeah it isn't listen it isn't that I love him less and right now but I get to looking at things that Lord and many times I'm just sharing with you many times I'll say Lord thank you for the things that you've allowed me and that I didn't have to worry about I didn't Lord I I didn't it wasn't me but I want us just I want you to know you didn't have to do that you didn't have to but I want to say thank you I want to say thank you I want you to know Lord I appreciate you I want you to know many times friends I I'm just saying I just encourage you and I I believe I believe you do it too but don't ever get beyond that of looking and don't get focused on those things but say Lord thank you for your grace Lord help me Lord Jesus give me me the grace Lord to handle the things in the right way because let me tell you something the world when the Rapture comes all those things will be left behind they can have our homes have our cars have whatever more because the Rapture itself is what means everything to us The God Who kept swept down and he changed my life if he never did one more thing for me he did more than any any man or any job or anything could ever do he's given me a joy and that Joy has been my strength even through times when I've been down it's been a joy to know I know in whom I have believed I don't know how I'm going to come out of this I don't know how this problem is going to be solved but I know that God is faithful and that Joy is because of that relationship that we have with him the joy of the Lord is our strength R said finally they get a good car A Better Home and the first thing you know then they want to get what they want and the world calls a better class to associate with they move into a different neighborhood and in there they find out they become influenced by the wrong influence you must always stay with where the kingdom of God is and where the glory of God is pouring out stay where you can be spiritually fed day and night I don't believe brother Bram is just talking about of where we belong in the economy of God I don't believe he's just talking about that us staying in wherever that he's called us to be whatever Church whatever locality but the most the first thing is is being in Christ and staying where the glory of God is pouring out where I can be spiritually fed day and night how many of you know sometimes there's things that you can see it just get on your mind and get you weighed down right there's things that happen like that it's like I told you before there's certain threads and things I'm on with pastors from around the world other ministry that's here throughout the region some other things like that and sometimes there can get into sometimes discussions or things will get sent on there oh you know and sometimes I got some of my buddies say they'll put a little on there like that I oh Lord have mercy you know what you you say what what do you mean well there's sometimes where you can actually get to a place to where now this thing has got started and now here comes this quote Here Comes this scripture Here Comes this quote here come and I and this is where I just stand I do not want my mind to get sidetracked I'm not trying to be spiritual I'm just telling you I don't like my mind to get sidetracked my my wife will tell you there might be times where she'll call or she'll text or something like that and I'll say you know what y'all go ahead with dinner I as soon as I get this thought wrapped up then I then when I get that thought if nothing else opens at that time let me finish out this study y'all go ahead and pray and just keep me a plate and I'll eat it when I get there that's the same way that within our lives I don't want my mind to be bogged down with things and yet we have insurance bills to to pay right I know I don't mean to bring it back down to where you're like oh Lord we got things you got we got tasks we have to do right we got natural tasks that we have to do there's things that we have to think about but yet don't let your life become tied up Lord to where God himself can't drop and have that sweet communion with you to where you're always available you know to where when you look on somebody's point on WhatsApp or telegram it says available when they're on WhatsApp you know they're on there because there's that green ring going right across their name is that right or when they're on telegram that Green Dot shows up they're online whether you're texting or not they're on there I mean if they're one of your contacts and you've got them in a thread we always want to be available and listen friends let me just close with this here that staying available is just as simple in the humility of staying right in step with him the things that God has called us us to the ways that he's worked in our life when you look back and say man how God has worked through this how how God has done this but staying humble before God is in the simple little things of praying seeking after him you you see you see that scripture we opened with Uzziah as long as he sought see when you're seeking you realize I don't have everything keep seeking the Bible says as we will seek Him He says when you seek me with all your heart then I'll be found of you David said thou has said seek after me and my heart said after thee while I seek oh God don't ever stop seeking after him longing after him praying oh my I want to just I'm going to skip ahead here to this last this quote I want to this summarizes this part the kernel of the message brother Bram said we find that the church yet teaching its power and teaching the signs to follow the believer yet we find them puffed out big me little you it isn't like the early church they were humble kind to one another and sweet understanding so much different today I wonder if a lot of this hasn't sidetracked us from the real kernel of the message you mean God would allow even sometimes the display of gifts and other things like that and other to where people could become so wrapped up in certain expressions and then they begin to follow gifts I'm going to follow this man CU he's got a lot of gifts in his life I'm going to follow this church I'm going to do that oh God May that never be the case may we be may it be that our life was in love with him because let me tell you something it wasn't a man who bled and died for me it was the man Christ Jesus it was God who came down but you see I look how brother BR tells us if that little bit didn't come over and come and touch Our Lives little bit that hadn't sidetracked us from the real kernel of the message incredible isn't it because you never find I've studied through here over even went back through it here just recently over some of the some of the some of the Past Times here you never find one time in the message clear up through the message the Rapture where brother bradam is ever ordering somebody to leave their church as a matter of fact he said we're not trying to take you out of your churches we want you to be a better testimony in your church is that right oh God may may God help us there's no listen there's no big ones there's no little ones Among Us there's there's no such thing it's Christ and if that is not the objective then we're missing it but notice if that hasn't sidetracked us from the real kernel of the message that we want to Humble ourselves the more humbler that's a good word the more humbler you can be the better God will use you and many you say Lord that's what I want that's what I want Lord You've remember when you are eaten in full but Lord let me remember then then then be intentional then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God Lord thank you for your blessings thank you Lord for answering prayer thank you Lord for the direction you've given in my life thank you Lord for your grace even to be able to talk to my children to be able to see things in a certain way thank thank you Lord God for your grace then bless the Lord and thank the Lord my what a Thanksgiving message wasn't even planned or intention on this way but what a what a moment what a time to think of it to be in that of Thanksgiving Lord I Thank You for Your Grace I thank you Lord you know how you know how we stay in that place the more humbler it isn't something in our minds that we're trying to do you know how this is exhibited is even daily in our life Lord I need you today I put my hands in your hands Lord guide me today Lord direct my feet today Lord give me Grace with my family Lord give me the leadership of what I'm to say on the job Lord show me yourself Lord show me Lord in a greater way show me Lord my shortcomings Lord father make known yourself to me Lord I want to serve you more if if you feel like Joy the joy of his salvation not that you have become un saved but if the joy has left your life just that simple humility to say God restore unto me the joy of thy salvation Lord and renew a right Spirit In Me Oh God Lord let me remember Lord I'm not above the message but my but the authority and the blessing is saying what you've said through your word for the spirit and the prophet and the bride will all be saying the same thing I want to stay with that word because with that word is Authority there's influence with that word it's the influence that comes from that other realm listen friends if that third angel in Revelations 18 flying by said come that Babylon Babylon the great is Fallen come out of her listen that third Angel Was Heard and flying across Heaven and the prophet said what it was is that seventh Angel's message on Earth was so inclined with Heaven till Heaven back up what was being said on Earth Hall heaven was saying amen that's my thoughts that's my word calling out to my people and let me just tell you Babylon is not just a system out there but Babylon is a condition where we fail to walk on with God and see our need for more of God that's a denomination not just a name out here but denomination is the prophet says when we fail to walk daily with him Hallelujah you love him listen friends I pray as God has delivered these things with us in mind amen I know we've been on this a little bit here with pride but listen I I'm not prolonging anything I'm just trying to follow him there's a lot of different little parts to help us he wants to help us aren't you glad I'm glad I'm glad I'm so thankful for that of little things like this that friends we're not depending upon our own selves we're depending on the grace of God lord lord survey my life let the MRI of the Holy Spirit as we pass under the word of God and their word begins to move upon our life and that knocking begins to move on our life I want to move under the MRI of the word Lord if there's anything in me that's not like you Lord take it out Lord you see what that is even in that that's seeking after him we're not just coming here and setting his Spectators we're here to say Lord I want more of you I want more of you Lord pour out of your spirit Lord pour out of your life Lord I want more of you Hallelujah I wonder I wonder right here this morning even before the musicians would come just a few moments I wonder if we just couldn't have just a few moments in prayer just to talk to him of how that he has spoke to us you know this is very fitting when God would come to us and speak to us in this way to have just just to take a few moments and say Lord Lord let the word just let it just so drop in my life Lord let it just Lord God thank you father for bringing my attention to these things Lord thank you Lord for helping me Lord to see or just how that maybe Pride could get in just through a little pinhole Lord God it can start with just a little thought and just how little by little Lord it just continues to build in my life Lord God I don't want my life to be full of Pride Lord I want to be full of the humility of the Holy Spirit I want to humble myself Lord in your presence Lord Lord God not only here father but Lord daily in my life I I wonder if here let's just take just a few moments and let's just talk to him just a few moments would that be all right just to just to invite him just talk to him in your own way and and just invite him into that into that place and Lord how you've spoke to my life and just just talk it over with him just a few moments I believe that would be so fitting right here this morning as he's been so gracious to us Lord Jesus thank you Father for your mercies Lord God as we as a people Lord would come into prayer Lord I not only would pray for them and pray with them but Lord I'm also praying here Lord as an individual before you lord lord as they're praying my brothers and sisters are praying dear God Lord in their lives in their hearts Lord in an individual way Lord I pray oh God lord as we think about Lord where you have brought us from Lord I know Lord that as we stand here Lord that not all of us Lord we're not maybe all in the same place or same spot but I'm just so glad that we're here with you Lord because father I know that Lord that you Lord bring each of us you guide us you work with us Lord to bring us where we need to be father it's you that gives us the grace Lord in our lives Lord and how I thank you for that Lord I am convinced Lord God that your word Lord will continue to work in our Our Lives Lord no matter where Lord as the Holy Spirit would have been Lord in our hearts like the prophet said as Lord you would give that little family the holy spirit in their lives maybe Lord the Holy Spirit Lord it hasn't went all the way to the actual ceiling of the soul but God it started Lord with a work of repentance and Lord you dealing with their life of separating from things Lord in their life and Lord from allowing things Lord that coming through their lives that would influence a child or children or loved ones Lord but father their desire is Lord sanctify every part of my life Lord to be pleasing to you Lord Jesus as they would start out seeking after you Lord God and Lord Jesus looking to you just how that Lord they remembered they felt Lord what it was when they Lord Jesus accepted you as their lord and savior they remember how it felt Lord when the burden of the weight of sin Lord was lifted off of their shoulders Lord when they had accepted what you had done for them oh God I pray father Lord Jesus may you take every family every mother every father grandmother grandfather Lord husband wife Lord God take each and everyone Lord father if there's one Lord God that Lord has not went fully behind the veil may they Lord God have enough humility Lord and reach up and say Lord I know Lord God that I'm not where I need to be but father I want to go there Lord and your Prophet said Lord Lord that you will take me to the baptism of the Holy Ghost your Prophet said that when I'm in need of healing you'll take me to Healing so Lord God I yield Lord Jesus in my life and my heart to you Lord oh God let everything be conditioned according to your preparation Lord that the word would be fulfilled in my life Lord God oh granted Lord Jesus May the Holy Spirit Lord may we lord God continue in that way like the prophet said to seek Lord after you Lord God seeking Lord until that word is made real I pray father for every one of us that are gathered here Lord it doesn't matter Lord how long we've served you Lord oh God there's one thing about it Lord we need more of you Lord the moment we stop seeking after you is the moment we've backslid Lord the moment Lord we start Lord God stop from that help us Lord forgive us Lord of Our sluggishness Lord help us Lord I pray God within our lives through the Lord the littlest things we often times sometimes the terminology of hum humbleness and humility it can seem so vague to our lives it or so abstract of how do I apply this but you show us Lord It's it starts Lord just even in the Simplicity of how it was Lord as we were seeking after you seeking after your will seeking after you Lord praying Lord father getting into the word of God and Lord getting back lord into the message message of the hour Lord and father realizing you are everything to us Lord when everything else of this life is done jobs and everything else that you provided Lord if if time terries Lord God they'll go by the wayside there'll be another cars that we'll have to buy there'll be other things we'll have to do it shows there's no Eternal value in those things but God let us Lord I pray oh god father that our hearts would be set in what is true riches Lord God the true things Lord of this life Lord I pray heavenly father as you blessed us Lord God with a message in this end time lord what a glorious message Lord but oh God this understanding did not come to us Lord as though that you would make us Lord as though we are something greater or better or in our minds to think Lord less of somebody else that's not what the message is because that's not you Lord the message itself is Christ being revealed it's recognizing Lord God your grace Lord to each of Our Lives Lord oh father I pray granted Lord Jesus help us Lord I pray God no long no matter how long Lord that we served you may we not get too big Lord that we wouldn't come to the altar Lord and pray Lord oh Father we don't just come as you had me say that last week we don't the altar is just not a place of repentance Lord that's only one part Lord of it father for Lord we know that repentance it can take right place right there in our seat but may we never get too big Lord to where when you deal with us that we just couldn't even come to the altar Lord and say thank you Lord Jesus thank you for your mercies upon my life Lord thank you for Grace Lord in this week that you gave me the wisdom how to speak to that boss how to respond Lord with a situation that was going on in my home thank you for Grace Lord thank you for helping me know when to speak and when not to speak Lord thank you for your wisdom Lord God in our lives Lord oh Father it's a place Lord where we can offer thanks giving Lord I realize Lord we can right there in our seat and I realize that Lord but may we never just limit Lord times of prayer and really getting before you as just a time when we are so wrong and out of the way but may we take the opportunity Lord God just as much as we would go to our spouses and express Lord our gratitude and Lord our appreciation and our love may we lord God I pray not only the only time you hear our voice or God would hear from us is when we have to say forgive me but may it be also those wonderful times Lord that are just like if we could say pop pop and Lord popcorn times of gratitude where we can say thank you Lord for your mercy Lord thank you Lord for providing Lord thank you for your grace thank you for opening your word Lord thank you for giving a hunger in My Heart Lord thank you Lord for correcting me Lord when I've been wrong thank you Lord for showing me my shortcomings Lord thank you for your grace Lord God in my life oh Lord Jesus granted Lord I pray Grant it Lord God oh in this great land lord this great land of the revealed word that you have brought us into Lord God oh Father you never Lord come that our lives would become sluggish Lord but help us Lord I pray help us Lord God in our lives Lord not to become weighed down with the cares of the world Lord but father that with everything Lord where you're not a compartment but you're our everything Lord and all that we're looking for I want to see whatever I'm searching for I want to see it in the boundaries of Christ because in the boundaries of Christ that's my inheritance and if it's outside of the boundaries that has been predestinated from the mind and plan of God I don't want it I don't need it my flesh might want it my spirit might try to reason and say this and that but Lord my soul I want my soul I want to live that life to wherever is Free and Clear With You Lord God it doesn't matter if I have to deny things Lord God within this life I want my life Lord to be full of the joy of the Holy Ghost Lord God to live a life Lord God that's free father Lord from condemnation a life that's free Lord God from bondage Lord God of the things of this world Grant it Lord I pray father Grant it Lord for each of us Lord each of Our Lives Lord as your children Lord we're praying Lord we're looking to you God we're seeking your mercies Lord oh God help us Lord I pray help us Lord Jesus oh God right in our services Lord how that Lord we need you Lord we need more of you lord lord Our Lives Lord God being changed our hearts Lord God being transformed Lord Oh Lord Our Lives being touched Lord by your presence help us Lord oh God even as the musicians Lord as they would get ready to come may they Lord also realizing Lord that father it's not just something Lord and I don't believe they do Lord but it's not just something Lord we want to take for granted Lord but it's something we want to so be in prayer over lord God even as we're looking through the week Lord guide me because it might be certain notes that are played from a certain song that would cause a demon to lift off of an oppressive spirit that would be cast off of a life maybe a heaviness about somebody's life maybe it would be that that song that note and and those things being played together Lord help us as musicians to play together Lord in a Harmony and a wondess Lord help us Lord I pray to devote Lord Our Lives to realize the talents that you've given us Lord it goes beyond Lord just the times that we're here in church Lord but it's a devotedness lord as they would give themselves to practice Lord God and Father begin to Lord yield to you Lord Jesus and remember Lord God of the different things Lord and how that it was Lord as you would deal Lord with their lives and Lord just to realize what a privilege and an honor Lord it is not that they don't realize it but to recognize Lord God even in a greater way just rekindle it Lord of what an honor it is to be able to play for the king of kings and for the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord what a privilege it is Lord for brothers and sisters that Lord as they sit here Lord God and Father taking in the word of God and their lives being used as vessels and instruments that'll touch lives that Lord my life would never touch Lord their lives will preach sermons Lord in volumes and ways that Lord that there may not be Lord a vessel that would enter these doors Lord because of maybe them clicking on a website or hearing a YouTube video but it would be through their life Lord God that Lord their hearts would be stirred Lord to begin to seek after you oh God let us not minimize Lord the responsibility that we have in this hour to be influences influences Lord oh God I don't want to I want to influence the lives that are around me my desire Let It Be Lord that through our dedication to you it'll be an influence Lord upon our children it'll be an influence upon our grandchildren Lord God grant it Lord I pray father help us Lord help us Lord Jesus help us Lord oh God granted Lord I thank Father Lord now over 42 years ago Lord when you started this work but

inauguration Lord there in January I don't say that to scare anybody but I'm saying Lord God we should not get to looking at things Lord and where that somehow in our hearts it is set as peace peace for it is at that time that you said sudden destruction Lord would come Lord oh God as I hear Lord commentators say well Putin has spooled out this Bluff and this is a bluff and this is a bluff Lord God to think that how that even in the conditioning of the minds of the people Lord God but there is a people on Earth that are not being moved by the natural things but Lord Jesus we're looking to you we see these things but we know it's time to lift up our heads Lord our Redemption draweth n cuz we know one thing Lord God we will not be here when one bomb hits Lord the bride will already be gone Lord Noah was in the ark before one drop ever hit upon the Earth Lord oh Gra Lord help us to be ready Lord help us Lord I pray God to live in that state of Readiness Lord oh granted Lord daily in our lives Lord I pray that God may your grace just continue to reach throughout each of us Lord God just a real rededication Lord a real rededication Lord I want to be more fervent Lord and how would I be more fervent by by simply coming back to the things that Lord Jesus what was it in that beginnings of my walk with you it was seeking your face it was where I cared what you thought about things

to we were teaching a unit on plants and seeds and sometimes I'd get carried away and say Amen in the middle of what I was [Music] teaching but they they would have us take them little simple little beans were almost look like a kidney bean or something like that and they would have us take those and actually the kids would do it and I'd have them take those brown paper towels and they would soak them in water and then they would wrap fold up that bean seed inside that paper towel we'd put them in there put them in a cup then we would leave the next day they would come into school and when it came time for science I'd have take those cups they would unroll that wet damp cloth and what it was is that outer part that was so hard they could just take with their finger and it just peel right off sometimes it would handle that bean it would almost shoot through there it just be but that outer part is is what they call the seed coat and it's such a hard thing but what it takes is that water to break that and once it's broken then they could open up and they could see the insides of that seed and that's why even right now in his presence and even as we would leave from here we continue to Worship the Lord we let that word Lord let that word Let the Rain of the Holy Spirit just settle in let it let it just melt down all of my will let it melt down everything Lord until that word has become real I I I want more of you Lord I want more I want more until there's nothing you give I want you love oh love CH there is just no oh for I could never ever hallelujah oh my if you feel like
