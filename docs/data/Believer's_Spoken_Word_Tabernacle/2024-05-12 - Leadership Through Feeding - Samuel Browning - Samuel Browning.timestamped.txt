[28:11] and I'd like to uh read a quote real
[28:14] quick I was going to try to tell it but
[28:16] I don't want to leave anything out
[28:18] brother brandham says it a lot better um
[28:21] with it just being Mother's Day and all
[28:24] um the song I've sang before it kind of
[28:26] just reminded me what the Lord did for
[28:29] us he said not long ago a young lady
[28:33] came in from college her mother had
[28:35] washed over a board to send her to
[28:37] college and when she drove into the
[28:40] station she brought a young girl with
[28:43] her she got away from God and away from
[28:46] church the young girl was with her
[28:49] sitting in the train looking out there
[28:51] stood the mother on the outside she was
[28:54] all scarred up and the young girl was
[28:56] with her the other girl coming home from
[28:59] college with her and said look at that
[29:02] old haggy looking
[29:04] woman that was the girl's mother she
[29:06] isn't said isn't that a horrible looking
[29:11] my wouldn't you hate to have to sit at
[29:13] the table with her to
[29:16] eat that was her girlfriend now instead
[29:20] of the girl speaking up she turned her
[29:23] head when she got off the train this old
[29:26] wrinkled woman ran up to her and threw
[29:29] her arms around the girl and kissed her
[29:32] and the girl was so repulsed she got
[29:34] away from her got away from church and
[29:37] God and she was so cold she turned her
[29:39] back to look the other way she said my
[29:42] darling my darling what's what's
[29:44] happened to you and she was so
[29:46] embarrassed because of her girlfriend
[29:49] just then one of the conductors who
[29:51] knowed the story walked up and grabbed
[29:53] the young girl by the shoulders and said
[29:55] look here Mary what do you mean and said
[29:58] Are you ashamed of your mother since
[30:00] you've been away to
[30:02] college so remember you know the story
[30:05] one day the house was burning down your
[30:07] mother was a beautiful woman far more
[30:09] beautiful than you are or ever would be

[31:26] garden a decision
[31:29] was
[31:30] made as eve took forbidden fruit and was
[31:37] deceived that
[31:39] day Adam stood there
[31:43] crying with a choice he must
[31:47] make to stay alone in the garden I can
[31:53] almost hear him say

[32:21] pay I don't want to live in
[32:26] Paradise alone
[32:30] some say that God searched
[32:33] heaven for a one willing to
[32:38] come I don't believe there was a search
[32:42] Jesus said I am the
[32:45] one I love it here in
[32:49] heaven but I really want my
[32:53] bride so he left Heaven splendor
[32:58] on Calvary he
[33:02] cried I don't want to live in
[33:06] Paradise
[33:10] alone for the one I love the most is
[33:15] what makes Paradise a
[33:18] home if I must go
[33:22] away that's a price I will
[33:26] pay I don't want to live in
[33:30] Paradise
[33:34] alone as Jesus looks into the eyes of
[33:39] his waiting
[33:41] bride he says you've waited long enough
[33:46] come stand here by my
[33:50] side cuz I don't want to live in
[33:55] Paradise alone
[33:59] for the one I love the most is what

[34:14] pay I don't want to live in
[34:18] Paradise

[43:42] the mothers amen happy Mother's Day May
[43:45] God richly bless you and I think it was
[43:47] a wonderful quote there that uh brother
[43:50] Brian had read and shared and uh I tell
[43:53] you with that that aspect brother
[43:55] Brandon will say that many many times
[43:57] over he won't necessarily use the um
[44:01] percentage of 98% but we get the point
[44:04] and uh just what an effect that is uh
[44:07] upon when we raise our children in the
[44:09] right atmosphere and brother bham as he
[44:11] brings that down to the scriptures we do
[44:13] what God has entrusted us to do and then
[44:16] God takes care of the rest of it it's
[44:19] just like that Moses Moses couldn't
[44:21] bring the pillar of fire down but Moses
[44:24] could follow the pattern that God gave
[44:25] him saying way with Solomon Solomon
[44:28] couldn't bring amen the shakina in the
[44:30] temple but he could follow the pattern
[44:33] and it was up to God to bring and bring
[44:35] that feeling in that life amen so I'm
[44:38] I'm so thankful amen that God is is
[44:41] Mindful and he's merciful to us amen we
[44:44] just want to say thank you to all of our
[44:46] mothers and my goodness it's just a I'm
[44:48] thankful to have my mother here with me
[44:52] uh to me that's a that's a great
[44:54] blessing and a great privilege and um
[44:57] so I my my brother doesn't have her this
[45:00] time that'll that that'll be next
[45:04] year maybe we can barter that out but uh
[45:08] I want to say I just so appreciate my
[45:10] mom and appreciate everything that uh
[45:13] that she does and uh we just also want
[45:17] to uh say um want to welcome uh brother
[45:21] Bob Wright and sister Lucy amen they're
[45:24] in the back there God bless you good to
[45:26] have you
[45:29] amen that's your brother Willie and
[45:31] sister Sabrina God bless you amen good
[45:33] to have you all here with us
[45:36] amen amen good to have each and every
[45:38] one of
[45:40] you amen I know there's uh there's some
[45:43] different ones out and so we want to
[45:45] continue to keep each one in prayer you
[45:47] heard the request about sister Stephanie
[45:49] and I I tried as best as I could on
[45:51] Friday morning uh trying to send around
[45:54] the text to all that were here that uh
[45:57] um had witnessed everything on Thursday
[45:59] and but the Lord is certainly mindful of
[46:01] our sister and uh so she right now she's
[46:05] dealing actually with the virus and they
[46:07] actually think that might have been what
[46:08] it was that kind of uh caused some of
[46:11] that um but I think it's good but
[46:13] everything else is checked out and
[46:15] checked out real good and you know I I
[46:17] couldn't help but when I walked back to
[46:18] my office on Thursday uh
[46:20] after everything we just had prayer and
[46:23] I just uh looking at everything I
[46:25] thought how
[46:27] Satan has fought our sister in that her
[46:32] getting to the house of God and then the
[46:34] Lord is made way I think it was December
[46:37] or January Brother Richard I think
[46:39] that's what it was when everything kind
[46:40] of got put together and uh for her and
[46:43] um everything she had to go back and
[46:45] reclaim her license and all those things
[46:48] and here she is driving and my mind just
[46:50] went to that you know as children you
[46:52] would be concerned for your your mother
[46:55] right your your parent driving because
[46:57] she drives from Norwalk and so uh she's
[47:00] here on Thursdays and Sundays and I just
[47:02] said Lord you know the need here while
[47:05] the enemy has made a way for our sister
[47:07] to be here and and she wants to be here
[47:09] more than anything anytime I've had the
[47:11] text like when I had to send out a text
[47:13] a few times service is cancelled I get
[47:16] back in capital letters from sister
[47:17] Stephanie
[47:19] [Laughter]
[47:22] no and so uh we just want to continue to
[47:25] hold our sister up in pray PR the Lord
[47:27] will just uh touch her and strengthen
[47:29] her as well amen so we want to look here
[47:33] in the word of the Lord and I'm going to
[47:35] uh try uh something here and hopefully
[47:38] it it works if it doesn't I've got a
[47:40] backup plan here on my on my
[47:51] desk there we go there we go so I'd like
[47:55] to read here in our scriptures from Ruth
[47:58] chapter
[48:00] 2 and
[48:02] uh I want to just kind of take it in
[48:05] this way we've been looking at this
[48:07] thought on the um
[48:11] importance of fellowship and feeding and
[48:15] I I still want to stay around that
[48:17] thought and under the value of
[48:19] obedience um but um I'd like to just
[48:23] look here this morning just really to
[48:26] hone in on the part uh even of of the
[48:30] feeding and really looking at that
[48:32] because it's God that's uh ministering
[48:34] to our lives and the there's an outcome
[48:37] that God has for our life and the
[48:39] outcome and desire that God has for our
[48:41] life there is a pull within our life so
[48:45] it's not something that we are unknown
[48:48] of or where it's something that we uh
[48:51] you know do not feel the pull but we
[48:53] feel the pull because there's something
[48:55] within us and it's God that's
[48:57] ministering to that part that he put
[48:59] within us to bring it forth and then to
[49:01] bring it into full maturity and I think
[49:04] that's the exactly the where all of us
[49:06] want to get to we want to be in that
[49:08] place that God has us to be and so here
[49:11] we come into the scripture here in uh
[49:13] Ruth chapter 2 and where that Boaz has
[49:18] has uh this is in the time some of the
[49:20] first scriptures uh and for sake of time
[49:23] I won't read all of them but just
[49:25] concentrate on verse 14 of whereare that
[49:27] Boaz is speaking to her uh he spoke
[49:30] comfortably he spoke friendly unto her
[49:33] he spoke to her heart and here he speaks
[49:37] and and mentions this to her in verse 14
[49:40] and Boaz said unto her at mil time Come
[49:44] Thou hither and eat of the bread and dip
[49:47] thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat
[49:51] beside the Reapers and he reached her
[49:55] parched corn and she did eat and was
[49:59] sufficed and left amen so let's just go
[50:04] to the Lord in a word of prayer here
[50:06] this morning amen I'm certain we have
[50:09] needs all throughout the building and in
[50:12] our hearts and we just want to just put
[50:14] it before the Lord so maybe if you have
[50:16] an unspoken request you'd like to make
[50:18] it known to the Lord Heavenly Father
[50:22] Lord we so thank you Lord for this
[50:24] moment Lord that you have given us Lord
[50:27] thank you Father for the beautiful day
[50:29] outside Lord Lord we're so thankful Lord
[50:32] and God we just Lord are looking to you
[50:36] as we thank you Lord most of all for the
[50:38] spiritual day Lord that we're living in
[50:41] Lord and to walk Lord in this glorious
[50:44] light oh God that our lives have been
[50:47] illuminated Lord by your presence Lord
[50:50] father we we truly Lord want to say
[50:53] thank you dear God thank you Lord for
[50:55] your grace that you've sent to us Lord
[50:57] to find us Lord search us out Lord and
[51:01] bring us to yourself Lord we ask that
[51:04] God that even here this morning I just
[51:06] ask a special blessing Lord upon every
[51:09] mother Lord oh God we could just Lord
[51:12] take and spend lord of the times to know
[51:15] of the sacrifices that's went in Lord to
[51:18] everything Lord oh God the raising of
[51:21] their children Lord oh Lord how we thank
[51:24] you Father in this hour oh God there are
[51:27] still Lord real lord mothers Lord Oh
[51:32] Lord we are thankful for that Lord we're
[51:34] thankful God for what you are the one we
[51:37] realize Lord like your Prophet would
[51:39] place it in a way when he spoke about
[51:41] brother Williams in his passing he he
[51:43] didn't just say he was a father he said
[51:46] he was a real father he didn't just say
[51:48] he was a husband he said he was a real
[51:50] husband and Lord I think Lord in this
[51:53] hour there's no one that can really
[51:56] Define what a real man is what a real
[51:58] woman is what a real father is what a
[52:00] real mother is outside of your presence
[52:03] Lord in our lives Lord oh God how we
[52:07] thank you Father we ask that you would
[52:09] now just Lord help us together as a unit
[52:12] to step aside Lord father you see the
[52:15] things Lord and know what you've placed
[52:17] on my heart and even Lord in the order
[52:20] Lord of how that things Lord that you've
[52:22] moved Lord and Lord help me Lord to just
[52:26] get out out of the way Lord these are
[52:28] things Lord sometimes Lord as we look in
[52:30] it Lord I'm asking that you would give
[52:32] us the understanding and the words Lord
[52:35] oh God to express and to speak Lord that
[52:38] would be edifying Lord God to the body
[52:40] of Believers Lord and oh Father when we
[52:43] would be finished here this morning Lord
[52:45] oh God and we would leave from the
[52:47] presence of one another May Lord our
[52:50] hearts oh God just have been made to
[52:52] burn within us Lord and when we leave
[52:55] from here Lord there's a unction Lord in
[52:57] our hearts oh God and Lord a yielding
[53:00] Lord and just Lord a a giving of
[53:03] ourselves more to you Lord that more of
[53:05] you Lord might be evidenced in our life
[53:09] oh God we just Lord love you and we
[53:11] thank you now Lord we just invite you
[53:14] Lord may you be the speaker and the
[53:16] hearer Lord help us to step aside in
[53:19] jesus' name amen amen God bless you as
[53:23] you're being seated
[53:26] I want to speak on this thought on
[53:30] leadership through
[53:32] feeding
[53:34] you recall in many places in the
[53:37] scripture of where when God had set
[53:41] forth and he gave the ministry and then
[53:45] brother Brandon would um pick this
[53:47] up in the church ages and he would speak
[53:51] of how that God has placed men that he
[53:55] that he has sent to take charge and to
[53:58] lead the church and he says it's not man
[54:02] leading man or man ruling over man but
[54:06] he said the way that that leadership is
[54:09] is it is a leadership through feeding on
[54:12] the word of God because we're not cattle
[54:15] there's a few references in the
[54:17] scripture possibly one I'll get to here
[54:19] today but remember we're not we're not
[54:23] herdsmen uh we're Shepherds and there's
[54:26] a great difference because as a Shepherd
[54:28] it's one that's to lead and a path
[54:31] that's already been made ahead and
[54:33] there's things that we are realizing
[54:35] that it's not we're not driving the the
[54:38] flock of God is not to be driven but
[54:41] it's to be led and you recognize that
[54:44] within it all that God himself he's a
[54:46] gentleman remember brother bam said over
[54:48] and over he's a gentleman God does not
[54:51] come with his presence to intimidate he
[54:54] doesn't come with his presence to
[54:57] condemn but God comes by his presence
[55:00] he'll bring conviction but real
[55:02] conviction will always display Calvary
[55:06] because there's always a way back amen
[55:09] and so it always is bringing forth of
[55:11] what that God has desired and and wants
[55:14] to bring out of our life and so we
[55:18] understand that that part of it that
[55:20] within um of the leading and how that
[55:22] God will lead us and he won't make us do
[55:25] anything but God God will always if
[55:27] there's things that we choose in our own
[55:29] self to bypass and maybe make an excuse
[55:32] for this well as as a child of God if
[55:35] you've really uh if you're ordained as a
[55:37] child of God we have to come around to
[55:40] that point and there's got to be an
[55:41] overcoming of that point in our life as
[55:44] it comes from the new birth to every
[55:46] facet in our life every every step is a
[55:50] step of Victory because the Holy Ghost
[55:53] itself is the gift of God but car
[55:56] character is a victory right so it is
[55:59] step by step of the way there's things
[56:00] that God molds and shapes and brings us
[56:03] into situations that we don't ask to be
[56:06] brought into and it's very uncomfortable
[56:08] to our flesh and our spirit but that
[56:10] also is part of our maturing that's part
[56:13] of us growing and the real growing
[56:16] really it deals with us dying more to
[56:19] oursel and Paul himself would Express in
[56:22] his own life that uh I Pro I protest by
[56:25] your rejoicing that I Die daily so
[56:28] there's a there's a constant dying in
[56:30] our life that's a due to to self and the
[56:33] word of God brings us to that and this
[56:36] is a thing that I'm thankful for as I
[56:37] said moments ago that God will bring us
[56:40] around to certain things you know
[56:42] sometimes when we can look at it in our
[56:43] life and I'm sure we can Fellowship on
[56:45] this point and you might be thinking why
[56:48] am I facing this again sometimes it
[56:51] isn't it isn't just why is this again
[56:54] it's God wanting to further purify Our
[56:57] Lives Hallelujah and bringing us to the
[57:00] realization where in maybe in times past
[57:03] we could say it's this person's fault or
[57:05] it's this fault or it's the if I had
[57:07] been raised differently if I and God is
[57:10] trying to show you and I because when we
[57:13] speak of being Sons and Daughters of God
[57:16] we don't ever want to lose sight of that
[57:19] that's the aim that's the objective it's
[57:22] not that we aren't already Sons and
[57:24] Daughters of God but that's the way that
[57:27] the word comes as the target the aiming
[57:31] point for our lives behold now are we
[57:35] the sons of God so we have a clear
[57:38] trajectory or an Aiming point that that
[57:41] it's in other words it's not a Target
[57:42] that is moving around and you know
[57:45] moving over here you know like we had
[57:47] that in years past you wear mask you
[57:49] don't wear mask and you do this and you
[57:51] do it's not a moving Target God's word
[57:54] has always been fixed am it's always
[57:57] been established but now what happens
[58:01] when the spirit of God comes and he
[58:03] vindicates his word God anoints our eyes
[58:08] to see clearly that Mark that we need to
[58:11] be pressing towards in every in every in
[58:15] every one of our Lives because it is an
[58:18] individual Journey amen so then brother
[58:21] bam is talking here and how can I
[58:23] overcome of why that we come to the
[58:26] house of God and he he first he started
[58:29] out with it talking about we don't just
[58:31] come to Fellowship yet Fellowship is a
[58:33] part of it and we've been kind of
[58:35] touching on that a little bit and we'll
[58:37] dive deeper into it after some time but
[58:40] I it's more than just fellowship and
[58:43] coming to sit around that is important
[58:45] it was encouraging when the prophet
[58:47] could see different ones bring their
[58:49] lunches and going to have a meal
[58:51] together after the service that's 1964
[58:55] the message shalom
[58:56] but he we're here for more than just
[58:59] Fellowship that's a part of it but we're
[59:02] here this is the main person or the main
[59:05] purpose we come here and we are here for
[59:09] one specific purpose this is the house
[59:12] of correction this is the throne this is
[59:15] the Throne of God and judgment Goes
[59:18] Forth from the house of God and here is
[59:22] where we come together Gather in love
[59:25] with one another as only Christians can
[59:29] love that's right but in here we are
[59:32] under a leadership of the Holy Spirit
[59:35] the Holy Ghost is Among Us and he goes
[59:39] on he says we're here to take Reckoning
[59:43] among us to see where our short places
[59:46] are not my
[59:48] brothers not my sisters all right it's
[59:52] got to be personal personal you see if
[59:54] you're looking at somebody
[59:56] God's leading us where he wants us to
[59:59] feed that's it brother because if you
[1:00:01] look just at somebody else you're not
[1:00:03] feeding you're
[1:00:05] not but we're here to see where our
[1:00:08] short places are right
[1:00:11] sir our shortcomings and how can we
[1:00:15] catch from where we should be over to
[1:00:18] where we ought to be
[1:00:20] now that that's Grace in that statement
[1:00:23] yes it is where we are to where we ought
[1:00:25] to be amen it's God helping us bringing
[1:00:29] us along sometimes we can we can feel
[1:00:32] like man I think I'm doing pretty
[1:00:35] good and I don't think we should walk
[1:00:37] around negative but it's something that
[1:00:40] you begin to see when we're talking
[1:00:42] about even that aspect we're seeing the
[1:00:44] word working in our lives and it isn't
[1:00:47] so much that you altogether see it out
[1:00:50] here but you have that on the inside
[1:00:54] where there are things that at one time
[1:00:57] there was a struggle oh yes but now it's
[1:01:00] a release right there's things that God
[1:01:02] was dealing with you personally but now
[1:01:05] it's a release because before it can
[1:01:07] ever come out here and be manifest in
[1:01:10] our actions it first of all has to come
[1:01:12] through a surrendered heart that the
[1:01:15] character is
[1:01:17] molded so in other words we don't go
[1:01:19] through things because it's the right
[1:01:21] thing to do and then say wellow I'm
[1:01:23] going to trust my character to be molded
[1:01:25] by that no it's God working in our lives
[1:01:28] inwardly and what he does inwardly it'll
[1:01:30] come outwardly is that the scripture
[1:01:32] Matthew 6 he that he says enter into
[1:01:36] your closet pray in secret and he that
[1:01:38] seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
[1:01:42] it's deeper than even just prayer time
[1:01:44] yet prayer is the number one point but
[1:01:47] it's speaking of a relationship where
[1:01:49] we're living from behind the veil I'm
[1:01:52] drawing my strength from behind the veil
[1:01:55] amen amen amen this is why the prophet
[1:01:58] would speak to you and I in greatest
[1:02:00] battle of her fought and say God is
[1:02:02] calling Abraham's seed to separate yes
[1:02:07] sir from see taste feel smell hear
[1:02:12] reasoning conscience
[1:02:14] imagination why because that's not your
[1:02:18] real Kindred that's it that's your
[1:02:21] Kindred by the first birth but when the
[1:02:24] New Birth has come H you've been tied
[1:02:27] back in to the tree of life
[1:02:31] it and it's called us to live a
[1:02:34] separated life that's it that's it am
[1:02:38] I'm sure we can truly Fellowship on that
[1:02:40] that's not an easy doing that's a
[1:02:43] battle every
[1:02:46] day it's a battle battle on and on and
[1:02:50] on our reasoning our imagination our
[1:02:54] conscience our memory our affection y
[1:02:58] those are Battlegrounds yes it is is
[1:03:00] that right yes sir because remember when
[1:03:03] the soul has been sealed that battle has
[1:03:06] been won been won true let me let me
[1:03:08] rephrase it the war has been won that's
[1:03:11] right it's over that's why brother BR
[1:03:13] says get that battle killed at the
[1:03:15] beginning at the
[1:03:17] beginning but then there remember the
[1:03:21] mind is no man's land that's right right
[1:03:25] No Man's
[1:03:27] Land it it it's what you or I choose to
[1:03:30] fill it with that's it yes
[1:03:32] sir you hearing me yes sir no man's land
[1:03:35] our mind is what we choose to fill it
[1:03:37] with that's right and whatever you fill
[1:03:39] it with will determine the strength in
[1:03:41] your life that's it you can fill it with
[1:03:43] the Affairs and the cares of this life
[1:03:46] you can fill it with the pleasures and
[1:03:48] the things of this life you can f listen
[1:03:50] God gave you your family to care for but
[1:03:52] God did not give you your family that it
[1:03:55] would totally feed or consume your
[1:03:58] life because you can't be you cannot be
[1:04:02] an a real true influence without the
[1:04:06] influence of God solely upon your
[1:04:10] life you walk by reasoning you walk by
[1:04:13] imagination you walk by memory well I
[1:04:16] remember when I was young I remember
[1:04:17] they did this I remember they did that
[1:04:18] were not to walk by
[1:04:20] that everything is to be brought subject
[1:04:24] to the word love that this is why Christ
[1:04:28] is to dwell the goal preeminently in our
[1:04:31] life let me just say this that
[1:04:33] preeminence ises not something that all
[1:04:35] of a sudden happens just one night at an
[1:04:39] altar it begins with a new birth but
[1:04:42] then it
[1:04:45] grows and the prophet said the more that
[1:04:47] will
[1:04:48] surrender the more he will grow that's
[1:04:51] it that's right and push out push out
[1:04:53] push out sir when they crossed
[1:04:57] into isra or into the land the promised
[1:05:00] land yes sir did God remove all of their
[1:05:04] obstacles no sir did God remove all the
[1:05:06] Giants say it now God never removed
[1:05:09] those things God says I will do it
[1:05:12] little by little by
[1:05:14] little it's a
[1:05:16] growing it's a growing cuz if not it's
[1:05:20] all we got to do is cross the Jordan and
[1:05:22] sit down think about
[1:05:24] it no we must
[1:05:27] grow we must grow so there's a
[1:05:30] leadership through feeding let's let's
[1:05:32] look here just for a few moments here in
[1:05:35] the in the scriptures in Ephesians
[1:05:38] chapter 4 and I want to draw from here
[1:05:40] for a few
[1:05:41] moments the scripture
[1:05:43] said wherefore he saith when he ascended
[1:05:46] up on high he led captivity captive and
[1:05:50] gave gifts unto
[1:05:53] men now that he ascended what is it but
[1:05:56] that he also descended first into the
[1:05:59] lower parts of the
[1:06:01] earth and verse 10 he that descended is
[1:06:05] the same also that ascended up far above
[1:06:08] all Heavens that he might fill all
[1:06:11] things so he has
[1:06:14] satisfied the the debt through Calvary
[1:06:19] and now on the Resurrection on the
[1:06:22] Easter morning the presentation there
[1:06:24] before the father it's accepted now
[1:06:27] after the journey for the 40 days with
[1:06:30] the disciples now as he ascends up and
[1:06:34] here they are to return back to
[1:06:37] Jerusalem and to be endued with power
[1:06:40] from on
[1:06:41] high for what purpose that he might fill
[1:06:46] all things all things do you realize
[1:06:48] that the beginning of him filling all
[1:06:51] things is him beginning with filling his
[1:06:55] El people preer yes sir because
[1:06:58] eventually then in the Millennium the
[1:07:01] knowledge of the Lord shall fill the
[1:07:03] Earth the land and sea and sky right
[1:07:06] then in the future home that City will
[1:07:09] occupy and then all of its outreaches
[1:07:12] but his beginning of his victory comes
[1:07:15] in your life personally that's right and
[1:07:18] this is why the enemy hates you it's not
[1:07:21] you as a person or me as a person amen
[1:07:25] but it is that revelation of Christ
[1:07:29] working in your life and as you're
[1:07:31] yielding to the Holy Spirit it is a
[1:07:35] reminder of the enemy every time he's
[1:07:38] being put out of your life every inch of
[1:07:41] ground that's being claimed it is a
[1:07:44] reminder to
[1:07:46] him that the promise said this Earth has
[1:07:50] become the Lord's and his Christ it's a
[1:07:54] promise that Millennial promise
[1:07:55] it shall
[1:07:58] be hallelujah amen so this is a victory
[1:08:03] this is a victory
[1:08:06] march of one that when they would enter
[1:08:09] into a triumphal entry they were giving
[1:08:12] gifts it was dispensing of that gift let
[1:08:14] me tell you every every person every
[1:08:19] believer has an access to the measure of
[1:08:23] Grace that God has it to you and I I'm
[1:08:27] talking about the most important gift is
[1:08:29] the gift of the Holy
[1:08:31] Ghost everyone Paul says the verse
[1:08:34] before this a measure of Grace why
[1:08:36] because we can't Merit it cannot we
[1:08:39] don't earn it brother Brandon says if
[1:08:41] God ever sends a Revival it will not
[1:08:44] because of The Obedience of the people
[1:08:46] it will be because of God's
[1:08:51] grace that's right you see it's it's
[1:08:53] taking it it's not what it's not
[1:08:55] something that we have done that has
[1:08:57] been the failure down Through the Ages
[1:09:00] when man wanted to work through
[1:09:03] reasoning and help God God doesn't need
[1:09:07] help he doesn't need help bringing his
[1:09:10] word to
[1:09:11] pass all he needs is yielded surrender
[1:09:16] humble
[1:09:19] vessels he interprets his own word
[1:09:23] that's it he brings his word to pass yes
[1:09:27] sir so it's us yielding that's all it is
[1:09:30] it's us
[1:09:32] yielding not yielding that's that's
[1:09:35] feeding yes sir
[1:09:38] amen
[1:09:40] watch and he gave
[1:09:43] some
[1:09:45] Apostles prophets evangelists pastors
[1:09:49] and teachers yes sir God gave
[1:09:52] all all of them and it was with it with
[1:09:56] a distinct purpose that's right God laid
[1:09:59] out the apostles for those who would go
[1:10:03] and to start a church that's right
[1:10:06] that's right they're one sent from God
[1:10:08] Amen that's needed needed this is why
[1:10:11] brother Brown brings the differences
[1:10:13] even when he'll speak and uh warning
[1:10:16] before judgment and he'll deal with
[1:10:18] those different offices and sometimes we
[1:10:21] might have our you know we can have our
[1:10:23] pics oh I just love the evangelist
[1:10:26] but that's a part of it exactly right
[1:10:28] evangelist has its part let me just say
[1:10:30] everyone has their part Pastor has their
[1:10:33] part yes sir but this is why here in
[1:10:35] this assembly this is my desire not just
[1:10:38] to have one facet of the
[1:10:40] ministry come on yes sir not just over
[1:10:43] and over the same facet no we need we
[1:10:46] need a balanced diet yes sir are you
[1:10:50] hearing me yes sir this is why the
[1:10:52] prophet could say when he deals with
[1:10:54] teachers and how teaching he says oh
[1:10:56] that teacher can just set back under
[1:10:58] that anointing and what teaching does as
[1:11:00] it's taking it's taking that word it's
[1:11:03] positioning the church in their position
[1:11:06] that's it right there now listen every
[1:11:08] teacher is different yes sir I I've got
[1:11:10] I've got many friends that are teachers
[1:11:12] and everyone is different right there's
[1:11:15] some you know that they might set back a
[1:11:17] little bit and and when they're going
[1:11:18] and my just just move right through that
[1:11:20] and I always thought oh brother Lonnie
[1:11:22] Jenkins I I just love what what a gift
[1:11:24] that was there and and I there's other
[1:11:26] brothers that I know very well right now
[1:11:28] that what a gift to be able to just set
[1:11:29] back underneath that anointing and just
[1:11:31] to just to teach and and lay that in now
[1:11:34] I understand sometimes sometimes listen
[1:11:37] friend let me just make a side note
[1:11:39] sometimes we have mistaken yes sir the
[1:11:42] anointing yes
[1:11:43] sir come on the prophet tells us why C
[1:11:47] and and why people are so tossed about
[1:11:50] and after he's preached the message
[1:11:52] prayer line altar call he comes to the
[1:11:54] end of that service and he says oh he
[1:11:57] says here was Jesus he sat down and he
[1:12:00] Ted and wonderful words proceeded from
[1:12:04] his
[1:12:04] mouth he said it never was an anointing
[1:12:08] like he
[1:12:09] had and he said what that anointing is
[1:12:12] is supreme power in control that's it is
[1:12:16] that right yes sir so anointing is the
[1:12:19] word coming Upon Our Lives Upon Our
[1:12:23] Hearts yes sir and God knows what we
[1:12:25] have need of like for example let me
[1:12:27] just put it my in terms here I am as a
[1:12:29] father my children have needed braces
[1:12:32] and other devices some of the rest you
[1:12:33] can Fellowship me with me on that you
[1:12:35] know you can say just open your mouth
[1:12:37] and let me see the
[1:12:39] Cadillac you know yes sir but you
[1:12:43] understand I couldn't put the braces on
[1:12:44] them right but God had there was someone
[1:12:48] who was specialized for that that's it
[1:12:51] that's it so I made sure I get him to
[1:12:54] that place that specialize that's don't
[1:12:57] misunderstand me I'm not talking about
[1:13:00] man here now in the spiritual but I'm
[1:13:02] talking about God God has it reserved in
[1:13:05] that way he works and he specializes
[1:13:08] through a multifaceted approach of five
[1:13:12] ministerial
[1:13:13] offices then you have pastors the
[1:13:16] pastors are those who are are are there
[1:13:18] to watch over the flock and to minister
[1:13:21] and out of all of those that are there
[1:13:23] the pastor is the one that is most like
[1:13:26] and that of like a father that's right
[1:13:28] cuz he sees all throughout yeah that's
[1:13:31] right yes sir father sees when Uncle Joe
[1:13:33] comes to visit and everybody says Glory
[1:13:36] Uncle Joe's coming woo man Uncle Joe
[1:13:39] everybody likes Uncle
[1:13:41] Joe friends that don't bother me I
[1:13:44] listen I I want our hearts to be edified
[1:13:46] that those things don't bother me a bit
[1:13:48] I want us to be edify I want us to be
[1:13:50] built up yes sir are you hearing me but
[1:13:53] you know how it is I know how it is in
[1:13:54] my family my when their Uncle Brian's
[1:13:56] coming over my goodness man they're
[1:13:58] they're ready they their buddies coming
[1:14:00] over well you know God brings in
[1:14:02] different parts of the ministry and God
[1:14:05] does it that way he doesn't have to do
[1:14:07] it that way have to i' I've told you
[1:14:09] this over and over I Marvel I said Lord
[1:14:12] why is it times that here that you lead
[1:14:14] me over here and Lead me here it don't
[1:14:16] even have to be across the waters but
[1:14:18] why even down here over here year years
[1:14:20] ago I said that but I realize he doesn't
[1:14:23] have to do that no and I'm not going to
[1:14:26] come in and say something different than
[1:14:28] what's already been preached if I do I'm
[1:14:31] off there you go yes sir because the
[1:14:33] real true reality is God brings in
[1:14:36] Ministry they will fall right in that
[1:14:38] same vein maybe a different perspective
[1:14:42] but what's God letting you know we're
[1:14:45] feeding prach we're feeding
[1:14:49] amen and that's without even any
[1:14:51] communication that's right what are you
[1:14:53] preaching what are you I don't to
[1:14:54] discuss those things
[1:14:56] I love God has that the Evangelist ball
[1:14:59] of fire comes in they don't have to
[1:15:01] worry about come in blaze it up tear it
[1:15:03] up that's right hand it over here you
[1:15:06] go here you go I you know I'm defining
[1:15:10] of what the prophet placed this in the
[1:15:11] message exactly how he said and God has
[1:15:14] prophets modern-day preachers God does
[1:15:16] have that God gave a prophet in this
[1:15:19] hour that's it preacher the prophet of
[1:15:21] the Hour come on man is that right God
[1:15:25] so this and let me just say it like this
[1:15:27] the ministry of this hour of Ephesians 4
[1:15:31] in order to be the ministry of Christ
[1:15:34] for the bride body it must be washed by
[1:15:40] the Prophet
[1:15:41] come it must be anointed you say Washed
[1:15:45] by the Prophet The Prophet receives the
[1:15:48] word for this
[1:15:50] day it must wash away all of our
[1:15:54] reasonings all of our leaving all of our
[1:15:58] thoughts why because we do not want to
[1:16:01] reproduce little miniature Mees we're
[1:16:05] interested in seeing
[1:16:06] Christ
[1:16:09] reproduced and the prophet was a
[1:16:11] faithful unit that had no seed of his
[1:16:15] own but it was the original seed the
[1:16:18] original word being delivered to the
[1:16:21] Church of the Living God
[1:16:25] and that's why real true Ministry has no
[1:16:29] seed of their
[1:16:31] own that's why we've had the Cults
[1:16:34] that's why we've had the divisions
[1:16:36] that's why we've had the the isms why is
[1:16:39] because of a desire to see themsel in
[1:16:43] the
[1:16:44] [Applause]
[1:16:47] people let me make a quote out of Satan
[1:16:50] the prophet said he said too many desire
[1:16:54] to see their own image established in
[1:16:57] the people's hearts instead of
[1:17:00] establishing the image of Jesus
[1:17:03] Christ so hard
[1:17:05] Hallelujah that's the truth that's the
[1:17:08] truth am
[1:17:11] Hallelujah the greatest compliment you
[1:17:13] can be given is not that you go to
[1:17:15] brother Samuel Browning's Church the
[1:17:16] greatest compliment you can be given is
[1:17:18] is you're a Christian you're a Believer
[1:17:21] come on man
[1:17:25] amen amen
[1:17:27] good hallelujah
[1:17:30] hallelujah why did he do
[1:17:34] this for the
[1:17:36] perfecting of the
[1:17:38] Saints for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:17:42] for the work of the ministry yes sir for
[1:17:45] the edifying of the body of
[1:17:49] Christ now that perfecting
[1:17:54] this is not that Perfection that comes
[1:17:57] by the blood that's right because only
[1:18:00] Christ himself can perfect you that's it
[1:18:03] by his own
[1:18:05] blood brother Brams asked this question
[1:18:07] repeatedly regarding this scripture
[1:18:10] that's right and brother Brown continues
[1:18:12] as he points back because this
[1:18:13] perfecting here deals with a complete
[1:18:17] maturing that's it a complete
[1:18:20] Furnishing it's true God brings his word
[1:18:24] it is the word that brings that birth in
[1:18:27] our life that's right but this is the
[1:18:31] reason that the ministry is not only to
[1:18:34] show and to point to where that
[1:18:37] Perfection is already made a way for you
[1:18:40] and I to attain but it's for the work of
[1:18:42] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:18:45] body of
[1:18:47] Christ praise the Lord you know as a
[1:18:50] Bible reader anywhere you go in the
[1:18:51] scripture when Paul even dealt with the
[1:18:53] gifts and other things when he had
[1:18:55] correct in the church he brought it back
[1:18:57] to listen anything that's done it ought
[1:19:00] to be about edifying the body yes sir
[1:19:02] that's it that's right it shouldn't be
[1:19:04] about individual come on preacher it
[1:19:06] should never be any anything we share
[1:19:08] should never draw attention to
[1:19:11] ourselves right that's that's a sign
[1:19:14] that's something something's wrong
[1:19:17] right understand hallah when brother
[1:19:20] bradam gave testimony listen these are
[1:19:22] these are indiv listen the person uh
[1:19:24] brother Hoover when he Brother David
[1:19:26] Hoover was here his
[1:19:28] grandmother who never she was the nanny
[1:19:31] that cared for him she never did see the
[1:19:34] message but there's one thing that she
[1:19:36] pointed out watch it she said when
[1:19:38] brother random gave testimony he always
[1:19:41] gave testimony as one who was a
[1:19:44] bystander I was there when I saw him do
[1:19:47] this yes sir that's right yes sir are
[1:19:51] you hearing me it's in the message why
[1:19:53] because listen listen friends these are
[1:19:55] More Than Just Words it's because as a
[1:19:57] body of Believers God does not want us
[1:20:00] hanging on to somebody else like a totem
[1:20:02] pole God wants you to have a
[1:20:04] relationship with God that's it and
[1:20:08] you've got a connection with God that's
[1:20:11] it is that right well I got to go see so
[1:20:15] and so I got to see what so no God
[1:20:17] listen friends he's right there with
[1:20:21] you Hallelujah
[1:20:25] I hope that don't offend you but listen
[1:20:26] friends I I don't I I don't want you
[1:20:29] hanging on me for
[1:20:30] everything if you feel to call me call
[1:20:32] me but I I want you tied in so deep in
[1:20:35] Jesus Christ you've got a confidence
[1:20:38] that who you are as a son and daughter
[1:20:40] of God that you can go to him and you've
[1:20:43] got an open connection and he's there to
[1:20:46] lead you and guide you I'll pray with
[1:20:49] you anything you call and say Hey
[1:20:50] Brother Samuel I'm thinking about this
[1:20:52] decision well let's pray together
[1:20:58] so what are you saying well you know it
[1:21:01] just same way with your children the
[1:21:03] objective even with my children our
[1:21:05] children same way it was with yours and
[1:21:07] would be with yours I don't want them
[1:21:08] depending on me the rest of their life
[1:21:11] tell it preacher so there's times seeing
[1:21:13] where they're at I can't make them get
[1:21:15] over here that's even where each of them
[1:21:18] have their own shortcomings that's where
[1:21:21] prayer comes in yes sir for the needs in
[1:21:23] their life areas that need to be picked
[1:21:26] up in their life as well as to help them
[1:21:29] to minister to them to speak to them am
[1:21:33] Hallelujah that's the same way as a body
[1:21:35] yeah that's the same way the same way
[1:21:37] that's
[1:21:38] sir prise Lord oh my now notice here

[1:21:58] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:22:01] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:22:04] think about that so this work of the
[1:22:07] ministry is to go on until what until we
[1:22:11] come to the unity not of a faith but the
[1:22:15] faith yes sir I hope you under with me

[1:22:37] Unity among the body Unity with the word
[1:22:41] first and then Unity with the body that
[1:22:44] means more than my feelings my ideas my
[1:22:47] thoughts Christ and his body means
[1:22:51] more that's coming to Unity of faith

[1:23:51] I

[1:24:13] a perfect man this is
[1:24:15] complete a completion yes sir this is
[1:24:18] the Perfection not a Perfection to where
[1:24:20] well I'll never make a mistake again oh
[1:24:22] no h you know I'll never fail again no
[1:24:25] no you're looking for the wrong thing
[1:24:26] thank you Preacher Brother BR would tell
[1:24:28] us I believe in 1951 Believers F this he
[1:24:30] said don't ever try to perfect this
[1:24:32] thing he said you're trying to perfect
[1:24:35] the wrong thing wrong he said is get
[1:24:37] this on the inside and he said when you
[1:24:39] got this on the inside it'll be a
[1:24:40] constant War until the day that you are
[1:24:44] set free but greater is he that is in
[1:24:49] you that's why the new birth is
[1:24:52] essential
[1:24:54] it's not an option without the new birth
[1:24:57] there's no growing into His Image his
[1:25:00] likeness there's no
[1:25:02] Rapture are you hearing me but with the
[1:25:04] new birth brings us into a place now
[1:25:08] where God is working in our life as we
[1:25:11] yield and surrender to bring us to full
[1:25:18] maturity don't you love
[1:25:22] him Hallelujah
[1:25:26] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:25:29] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:25:32] what God has allotted for Luther's day
[1:25:35] is not enough for this
[1:25:37] day the measure has increased that
[1:25:40] that's that's good but as the measure
[1:25:43] has increased so has the grace to
[1:25:46] perform yes sir what's what God requires
[1:25:49] God provides the
[1:25:51] grace when God makes a promise it's God
[1:25:55] committing
[1:25:56] himself and when God announces and
[1:25:59] declares this is the time of the promise
[1:26:02] God is announcing he is on the scene to
[1:26:06] perform his
[1:26:08] word like he did through Mary yes sir
[1:26:12] that's right yes sir be it unto me
[1:26:15] according to your word according to Thy
[1:26:17] word not according to how my mama s it

[1:28:35] the world that's it preer thank you Lord
[1:28:37] God's determined I love that God's
[1:28:39] determination for you to make
[1:28:42] it is greater than your own
[1:28:46] will no doubt you've given up many times
[1:28:49] God's never given up he already saw you
[1:28:53] come on as a champion before the
[1:28:56] foundation of the world that's why the
[1:28:59] sons of God shouted for Joy they were
[1:29:02] looking at their victory in the Lamb of
[1:29:05] God he's my victory he's my Deliverance
[1:29:08] he's my salvation he's my all
[1:29:12] allise the Lord keep your eyes on him
[1:29:15] and you'll see Victory it'll lead you to
[1:29:18] victory
[1:29:21] amen than
[1:29:24] H we may not toss to and fro not not
[1:29:27] governed by our emotions and how we made
[1:29:30] up and we responded in the past and we
[1:29:33] responded this way and respond not
[1:29:35] governed anymore by those things to
[1:29:36] realize wait a minute it's a Son of God
[1:29:40] on the
[1:29:45] inside the Lord how does that happen by
[1:29:48] the revealing of the knowledge of the
[1:29:50] Son of God yes sir God revealing his
[1:29:53] character
[1:29:55] that's what the opening of the seals was
[1:29:57] all about the prophet would tell us in
[1:30:01] 1962 I believe it's a message all things
[1:30:03] he said when the seals come open it'll
[1:30:06] be the revealing of God's Own nature yes
[1:30:11] Hallelujah because this this is why the
[1:30:13] prophet could say in the Easter seal in
[1:30:15] 65 it's the quickening power the opening
[1:30:18] of these seals is the releasing of the
[1:30:21] quickening power to the Church of the
[1:30:23] Living God what is the quickening power
[1:30:26] it's the latter rain it's the maturing
[1:30:28] rain it's a harvest rain and he says
[1:30:31] your attitude towards it will determine
[1:30:35] if it does you any good or not
[1:30:37] right I hope you understand what I'm
[1:30:39] saying here as he's bringing it it's not
[1:30:42] just a one snapshot deal of well I
[1:30:44] believe the message the quickening power
[1:30:47] is at work the prophet said it quickens
[1:30:50] us from death unto life and keeps on
[1:30:53] quickening quickening quickening
[1:30:55] quickening all the way up to the change
[1:30:57] of the body it's our attitude towards
[1:31:00] the quickening of the
[1:31:07] word this is what Ruth's being invited
[1:31:09] to at M time yes sir remember Bo has Bo
[1:31:12] hasn't laying threats on her uhuh Bo has
[1:31:15] not telling Ruth Ruth you better be
[1:31:17] here oh God when Church time comes you
[1:31:19] better be here watch it wow she never
[1:31:23] came in into the land because of that in
[1:31:25] the first place in the first place and
[1:31:27] he recognized that when he began
[1:31:29] speaking to her that's why she said thou
[1:31:32] has spoken to me friendly and that
[1:31:34] phrase means to my heart Hallelujah the
[1:31:37] one who's drawn me where I couldn't
[1:31:39] understand and gave me the strength to
[1:31:41] forsake my friends and family let me
[1:31:44] tell you something what God's given you
[1:31:45] strength to forsake thus far you'll
[1:31:47] continue to give you the strength to
[1:31:49] forsake everything else yes sir what I
[1:31:51] do just stay in the field keep keep keep
[1:31:54] feeding keep feeding keep feeding he'll
[1:31:56] give you the strength that's
[1:32:00] right but notice speaking the truth in
[1:32:05] love that we may grow up into him in all
[1:32:08] things which is the head even Christ
[1:32:11] notice that we might grow up into him in
[1:32:15] all things I say all things God let
[1:32:18] everything let let my life be growing in
[1:32:21] all
[1:32:22] things you know it be like a
[1:32:24] weightlifter and all they do is you know
[1:32:25] they just all they do is concentrate on
[1:32:27] their on their arms and they got these
[1:32:29] little chicken legs I never was
[1:32:31] privileged with chicken
[1:32:33] legs I never had chicken legs you know I
[1:32:36] think I was born wearing men's
[1:32:39] clothing might been shorts but
[1:32:43] nonetheless but you know what if what if
[1:32:45] you know we we've all seen them kind of
[1:32:46] things where guys and they got these
[1:32:48] little chicken legs and they walking
[1:32:49] around you know like
[1:32:52] this God's body is a body that is
[1:32:56] proportionally
[1:32:58] balanced this word comes to balance
[1:33:02] us not inflate us in a certain area and
[1:33:07] leave another area
[1:33:09] deficient sir why God's determined he's
[1:33:12] going to have
[1:33:17] Eagles sometimes now sometimes sometimes
[1:33:20] just like people who work out they don't
[1:33:22] like certain days of the week all right
[1:33:24] all right they'll do them but they don't
[1:33:25] like them listen there's things that God
[1:33:28] draws our attention to it's not real
[1:33:30] happy uhuh but he draws our attention to
[1:33:33] it because it's areas where we need to
[1:33:36] feed and be exercised in and is Will
[1:33:40] yield then the other parts of our life
[1:33:43] will benefit
[1:33:46] from see this is why our lives were not
[1:33:49] meant listen this is why a real true
[1:33:51] word birth brings you to your rest is in
[1:33:55] the word in the word not in a
[1:33:58] gift not in a certain area of your life
[1:34:01] it brings it to where on the inside the
[1:34:04] amen is dwelling there and can say Amen
[1:34:07] to every word of God it brings us to
[1:34:10] balance yes
[1:34:11] sir is that right that's right
[1:34:14] Hallelujah notice from whom the whole
[1:34:18] body fitly joined together and compacted
[1:34:21] by that which every joint supplieth
[1:34:23] might there's a whole bunch in that
[1:34:24] scripture but according to the effectual
[1:34:26] working in the measure of every part
[1:34:28] maketh increase of the body unto the
[1:34:31] edifying of itself in
[1:34:35] love
[1:34:38] so sorry I didn't put that up there I
[1:34:41] want to I want to look at this right
[1:34:44] here just a moment but this is what I've
[1:34:46] been ministering on right here the Lord
[1:34:49] I don't think we probably even have uh
[1:34:53] the Las in there but I I I could we
[1:34:55] could focus on all these things on the
[1:34:56] side but I don't want to focus so much
[1:34:58] on these things on the side of the four
[1:35:00] anointings all this pertains to church
[1:35:03] age and all your different Church age
[1:35:05] Messengers but I want you to see that
[1:35:08] every
[1:35:11] age had to come under the word for their
[1:35:13] age had
[1:35:15] to and God would build them to the
[1:35:18] measure they were called to
[1:35:21] am are you with me amen so in here in
[1:35:25] the beginning of that faith of that part
[1:35:28] Faith remember brother Brandon when he
[1:35:29] actually Drew this the one you have in
[1:35:31] your book statue of a perfect man
[1:35:33] brother Bram when he drew that right
[1:35:35] underneath right there brother brandham
[1:35:36] drew that little that little part he had
[1:35:38] there and brother Bram actually had
[1:35:40] written in Born Again Y and so when you
[1:35:42] recognize that remember brother B will
[1:35:44] go on this is why you can't preach
[1:35:46] statue of a perfect man just from that
[1:35:47] message you got to follow it all you got
[1:35:49] to take the thread all the way through
[1:35:51] all the way through up to 65 yes sir
[1:35:53] yeah brother Bram will tell us over and
[1:35:55] over he says these these virtues he says
[1:35:57] if you're trying to do it he said then

[1:38:49] house and say I need more patience
[1:38:54] no you don't say I need more
[1:38:59] virtue every one of these I want you to
[1:39:02] look at them closely every one of them
[1:39:05] are
[1:39:06] produced from dying to self yes sir from
[1:39:10] ding adversity
[1:39:12] strikes situations come and your
[1:39:16] patience
[1:39:19] grows well my patience isn't where son
[1:39:21] it's not about you comparing yourself
[1:39:23] man it's it's you and God you and
[1:39:27] God when brother so and so said my
[1:39:29] patient weak ignore brother so and
[1:39:32] so brother so and so's got a problem
[1:39:35] with
[1:39:37] Temperance self-control the
[1:39:39] tongue woo preach brother
[1:39:42] preach man but we grow in all things I
[1:39:45] love that is that right brother Brandon
[1:39:48] would call it regarding Temperance he
[1:39:50] said and blasphemous names he said oh
[1:39:52] God crown my soul with self-control yes
[1:39:59] sir so here we grow that that little
[1:40:03] place we grow brotherly kindness what
[1:40:05] are we doing crossing the Jordan into
[1:40:07] the promised land we all the promises
[1:40:10] lay that's power is that right yes sir
[1:40:12] now this whole thing here I I wish I
[1:40:14] could dwell more on it what what this
[1:40:16] whole thing it speaks of is it speaks of
[1:40:18] an individual believer oh God
[1:40:21] individually you're growing
[1:40:23] that's true but there's got to be a
[1:40:25] birth in the
[1:40:27] beginning sir then our faith grows and
[1:40:30] virtue grows and and you keep growing
[1:40:32] that's it this is why listen you're let
[1:40:35] me just reiterate that you're not
[1:40:37] comparing yourself to someone else what
[1:40:40] we should see in one another that should
[1:40:42] stir up one another it should be Christ
[1:40:47] Christ Hallelujah don't aim to be like
[1:40:49] somebody else because you might be
[1:40:51] mistakenly
[1:40:53] your focus on their temperament how God
[1:40:57] has made them and not really seeing the
[1:40:59] Christ that's there behind their
[1:41:02] life because God's made you in a certain
[1:41:04] way as a body that's compacted
[1:41:07] together where we're all not going to
[1:41:09] worship the same we're all not going to
[1:41:10] preach the same we're all we're all
[1:41:13] different but the one thing that is the
[1:41:16] continuity is his life in the body I
[1:41:19] love
[1:41:20] that this also speaks of the body of
[1:41:24] Jesus Christ the bride body the people
[1:41:27] that's been called of the Gentiles out
[1:41:29] of the Gentiles for his namesake because
[1:41:31] God remember he said Upon This Rock I
[1:41:34] will build my church
[1:41:37] build he's the foundation
[1:41:40] stone and zerubabel shall bring forth
[1:41:43] The
[1:41:44] Headstone with shoutings of Grace Grace
[1:41:48] unto
[1:41:50] it and the Church of the Living God God
[1:41:53] where it's to stand in this hour it
[1:41:56] comes to a place to where the very
[1:41:58] Ministry of Jesus Christ is reproduced
[1:42:02] again reproduced yes sir stay with me
[1:42:04] now I'm not just talking of Malachi 4 uh
[1:42:08] because a real fulfillment of Malachi 4
[1:42:11] is where that Jesus Christ would be
[1:42:14] reproduced not just on a platform not
[1:42:16] just on a t not just in a book but in
[1:42:19] individual lives to where our lives are
[1:42:23] servants unto Jesus
[1:42:26] Christ Philippians 2 let every man they
[1:42:30] receive this mind let it be in
[1:42:34] you think it not robbery my God who
[1:42:38] being in the form of God took on the
[1:42:40] form of a
[1:42:42] servant a servant means one who
[1:42:44] surrenders himself to another's will
[1:42:46] come
[1:42:46] on God used the messenger to deliver the
[1:42:51] message that's right and I'm going to
[1:42:52] tell you it got through oh this message
[1:42:57] is to live and it is
[1:43:00] living let me tell you friends what good
[1:43:02] would it do if it's just a platform or a
[1:43:05] church
[1:43:06] message this message come to live inside
[1:43:10] and make you and I individual living
[1:43:14] Tabernacles let me use the prophet's
[1:43:16] word

[1:43:39] that
[1:43:40] area that's Sons and Daughters of God

[1:43:45] to face with the word and say be it unto
[1:43:48] me
[1:43:49] Lord hallelujah
[1:43:54] this is also speaks of that New
[1:43:55] Jerusalem

[1:44:01] in a bride body right now right
[1:44:04] now what John saw coming

[1:45:57] godall speaks of all of this he's he's
[1:46:01] he's building us he's working in our
[1:46:06] lives now some of you appreciate this
[1:46:09] next picture maybe you
[1:46:14] won't but I remember when my wife and I
[1:46:18] were
[1:46:20] there and um brother Bram would take
[1:46:23] this stay with me now I'm going to try
[1:46:25] to bring it down brother br will take
[1:46:28] this I want you to think of this message
[1:46:30] things that ought to be yes sir and he
[1:46:32] will take this message and brother
[1:46:33] Brandon will continually he'll drop this
[1:46:36] in and then he'll come back and bring it
[1:46:37] right back around again and he's dealing
[1:46:39] with I want you to think of this now I
[1:46:41] want to be very slow and intentional
[1:46:44] with this brother bram's dealing with
[1:46:46] first of all that seed on the inside
[1:46:50] that's crying out for life
[1:46:53] okay then when that birth is come
[1:46:56] because there's things needed in order
[1:46:58] to bring that birth about then that life
[1:47:01] on the inside of you that's growing I
[1:47:04] know our flesh grows sometimes our
[1:47:06] spirit May grow weak but the real thing
[1:47:09] that's that God is bringing forth is
[1:47:12] that character on the inside that's it
[1:47:14] that's it you know we're living in a
[1:47:15] season of planting right you're going to
[1:47:18] go to the nursery maybe some of you
[1:47:19] already have and you're going to go and
[1:47:21] you're going to pick things out of the
[1:47:22] Nur a tree a bush or your little patunas
[1:47:26] and what you're going to do is you're
[1:47:27] going to take them out of the packet and
[1:47:30] put them in soil around your home that's
[1:47:33] called transplanting that's right the
[1:47:35] prophet said in the future home our
[1:47:37] character will be
[1:47:39] transplanted right so it's God bringing
[1:47:42] it to a place to where he says no longer
[1:47:46] fit molding is done come home right
[1:47:50] Hallelujah come home and it's a
[1:47:54] transplanting of what he
[1:47:56] himself has been developing through our
[1:48:00] yielding is that
[1:48:02] feeding I want you to think how brother
[1:48:03] Bram says just look at the picture there
[1:48:05] as I'm going to read these he says an
[1:48:07] expectant mother on Earth today that
[1:48:09] Mother's body craves for certain things
[1:48:11] that's right now I will be honest my
[1:48:13] wife craved for things through our sons
[1:48:17] and uh when for Paul She craved
[1:48:21] buttercream white cake
[1:48:28] yes that's all right that's all right
[1:48:32] cuz I love buttercream icing and white
[1:48:36] cake I probably look like I was the one
[1:48:39] going to have the baby after so long a
[1:48:40] time but you know but a mother's baby
[1:48:43] craves a mother's body begins to Crave
[1:48:47] she's so connected with that with that
[1:48:49] life on the inside when she begins to
[1:48:52] Crave brother br will say it he says
[1:48:53] what it is there's something lacking in
[1:48:55] her body where she'd begin to Crave
[1:48:57] certain things and brother Bram talks
[1:48:59] about you know in his family he said
[1:49:01] they were pooring things and he said you
[1:49:02] know before the baby was born mother
[1:49:05] would crave something and dad would just
[1:49:07] scrape up what he could to go get it
[1:49:09] whatever it was sometimes those those
[1:49:11] combinations sound kind of funny like
[1:49:14] for my mom I guess that's the I tell all
[1:49:16] the family secrets for my mom it was for
[1:49:19] me it was chocolate milk and Doritos
[1:49:25] just so happened that I like chocolate
[1:49:26] milk and I like Doritos but I don't but
[1:49:30] I know it's not the case for everybody
[1:49:32] and we were talking about that with some
[1:49:33] others you know brother the Shane Lily
[1:49:35] the other night but I want to say it in
[1:49:38] this way that there what was it it
[1:49:39] wasn't necessarily my mom's not a junk
[1:49:40] food eater she don't like that stuff but
[1:49:42] it was something she was craving that's
[1:49:44] right and she it was something that
[1:49:46] would connect and you know call out for
[1:49:48] remember brother br will de that with
[1:49:49] deep call to the deep and speak of that
[1:49:51] but there's a craving and he said they
[1:49:53] try to get it so that baby I want you to
[1:49:54] listen will be born as perfectly and
[1:49:57] happy as possible when there's something
[1:50:00] needed the mother gives witness to it I
[1:50:03] want you to catch what he's saying now
[1:50:05] right now that being connected even
[1:50:07] having listen that seed before it's
[1:50:10] quickened that's right there's something
[1:50:12] in there that's calling out for reality
[1:50:15] that's right you can try remember
[1:50:16] brother bam takes us in The Thirst 1965
[1:50:19] you can try to satisfy it with worldly
[1:50:21] fashion try to satisfy with things of
[1:50:24] this world can try to SAT but it won't
[1:50:27] satisfy but there is a
[1:50:29] calling that's going out is that right
[1:50:33] but it's it's to satisfy there's
[1:50:35] something to be satisfied there's a
[1:50:37] craving brother BR says when there's
[1:50:39] something that's needed for that
[1:50:40] oncoming child listen this he says now
[1:50:44] why we have revivals asking a question
[1:50:47] why do we assemble together and he goes
[1:50:49] on to talk about with people he says
[1:50:51] Pentecostal women and he talks about
[1:50:52] about how they're dressing and and the
[1:50:54] way that they're doing and he said
[1:50:55] that's not the real Bible Way and he
[1:50:58] says these things men wearing shorts and
[1:51:00] everything and that's an Abomination to
[1:51:02] God he said but why does the Holy Spirit
[1:51:05] keep crying out it knows there's
[1:51:08] something lacking there yes sir see you
[1:51:12] see it's not the holy spirit it's not
[1:51:14] God harping on things oh no what it is
[1:51:17] that life on the inside it's calling out
[1:51:20] for reality and God is hearing the call
[1:51:25] of one of his children beneath the
[1:51:28] darkness beneath all the gun beneath all
[1:51:30] the mck and the Holy Spirit is speaking
[1:51:33] to that seed yes sir yes sir when Moses
[1:51:38] stood there in
[1:51:39] Egypt God told Moses he said you stand
[1:51:43] before pharaoh and say let my son go
[1:51:47] that he might serve me you'll never find
[1:51:49] those words repeated to Pharaoh's face
[1:51:51] that's right but that message the whole
[1:51:54] message the whole message was to let my
[1:51:57] son
[1:51:58] go that's why it's not just a book or a
[1:52:01] take it's a take the whole word of God
[1:52:05] the whole word of God is let my son go
[1:52:08] let my daughter go that they may serve
[1:52:11] [Applause]
[1:52:14] me Hallelujah he says it shows there's
[1:52:17] something lacking there
[1:52:23] we must be in the full stature of Jesus
[1:52:26] Christ we must be Sons and Daughters of
[1:52:28] God we must act like God's children amen
[1:52:33] you love
[1:52:35] him let's just stop
[1:52:43] there let's stop
[1:52:47] there may
[1:52:49] God continue to give us Grace
[1:53:15] brother BR talks about the little boy he
[1:53:17] goes on and things that ought to be I I
[1:53:20] am closing I just I want to read this
[1:53:21] point
[1:53:25] before that little little baby is born
[1:53:26] it's craving for some kind of
[1:53:28] vitamin the mother will reach out and
[1:53:30] say Dad I want a
[1:53:36] watermelon there's something that can
[1:53:38] reach out in your life as God deals
[1:53:41] personally with your heart personally
[1:53:43] that's right and you reach out and you
[1:53:45] ask
[1:53:46] God
[1:53:48] lord I need this Lord
[1:53:52] I need the Holy
[1:53:54] Ghost I need more of you Lord I I need
[1:53:58] to die in this area of my
[1:54:01] life I need more of
[1:54:04] you see it's it's it's it's expressing
[1:54:07] how would the
[1:54:09] daddy how would the daddy Brianna go
[1:54:12] ahead and give me number two how would
[1:54:13] the daddy know what to get Mama now God
[1:54:17] knows you and he knows me doesn't he
[1:54:19] that's right that's why sometimes we can
[1:54:21] sit right here and you think man it's
[1:54:22] like some it's like they've been sitting
[1:54:23] in my living room in my prayer closet
[1:54:28] right is that right yes sir but you see
[1:54:32] when you're
[1:54:33] praying you're being honest with God
[1:54:36] lord I've got a need and what it is it's
[1:54:39] God himself that's making you aware of
[1:54:43] that need that's in your life that's
[1:54:45] right you could listen to me you
[1:54:47] couldn't desire it unless he already put
[1:54:51] the desire there that's
[1:54:54] right and but God
[1:54:57] remember he moves as we will yield and
[1:55:01] ask that's right is that right ask and
[1:55:05] it shall be given knock and it shall be
[1:55:10] open so the ways that God will work and
[1:55:14] I need this and Lord I need this see it
[1:55:17] becomes personal it's just like right
[1:55:18] here in the service like this things
[1:55:20] that where God can be dealing so
[1:55:21] personally lives that it might be things
[1:55:24] to where God's working with the heart of
[1:55:26] a man to be a real man that's right be a
[1:55:29] real husband be a real father real
[1:55:31] mother so forth then God working with
[1:55:33] another life of Lord I needed I I need
[1:55:38] you to go deeper I want more than just a
[1:55:41] a knowledge that's it I I want a reality
[1:55:44] Lord I I I need maybe in your life Lord
[1:55:47] I I need I need a real sanctification in
[1:55:51] my life I need a real cleansing
[1:55:54] Lord maybe in her life they said Lord I
[1:55:57] I I need more of you I'm seeing too much
[1:56:01] of Samuel I need more of you Lord give
[1:56:04] me Grace To Die to myself
[1:56:07] Lord give me Grace I don't want to I
[1:56:10] don't want to resist the word I want to
[1:56:12] yield I want to yield I want to
[1:56:15] yield and watch how brother brm will say
[1:56:17] this this last part and he says how much
[1:56:21] more abler is the Creator to get what we
[1:56:24] have need of and he said if we know he
[1:56:27] he's preparing us a body to live like
[1:56:29] his own glorious body if we want to live
[1:56:31] there is something in us that calls to
[1:56:32] live and there is something in us that
[1:56:34] calls to do right then God watch this
[1:56:38] then God will call somebody on the
[1:56:40] platform or the pull pit that will
[1:56:42] preach the absolute
[1:56:44] truth why is that man preaching what
[1:56:46] he's preaching cuz there's a call that's
[1:56:48] going out to want to be right
[1:56:54] and God hears the call of his
[1:56:57] children is that right now watch this if
[1:57:01] you're a real child of God then you
[1:57:04] begin to cry out God take it away from
[1:57:07] me circumcise me from this take these
[1:57:10] things away from me hallu
[1:57:14] Hallelujah I say thank you
[1:57:17] Lord thank you Lord when the word's
[1:57:20] pointing out things in my life Maybe
[1:57:22] it's something that after I leave the
[1:57:24] service and maybe a brother has spoke
[1:57:26] maybe it's even something that God has
[1:57:28] allowed me to look across on a quote May
[1:57:30] maybe it's through a message that I've
[1:57:32] heard and all of a sudden that quote
[1:57:34] that
[1:57:35] scripture it it just it moves to such a
[1:57:38] place and you realize Lord I need help
[1:57:42] amen circumcise me Lord I want to be cut
[1:57:46] away from my own thinking Lord I want to
[1:57:48] be cut away from my own ideas Lord I
[1:57:51] want to be so cut away from Samuel to
[1:57:53] where it's nothing but a Son of
[1:57:56] God brother Samuel do you believe that's
[1:57:59] possible yeah we're pressing towards
[1:58:01] that we're pressing towards that sure
[1:58:03] we're going to have to bear with this
[1:58:04] the whole time but remember this is not
[1:58:06] your ruler that's right listen friends
[1:58:09] remember remember when we speak and we
[1:58:12] quote the scriptures behold now are we
[1:58:14] the sons of God stand like men and women
[1:58:17] that's right when situations arise don't
[1:58:21] pull back come to previous actions don't
[1:58:24] pull back to previous behaviors that's a
[1:58:27] time to as the Bible said quit be ye
[1:58:29] like men stand up in that moment how do
[1:58:33] I stand up by humbling ourselves because
[1:58:36] the Way Up Is
[1:58:38] Down Lord I Surrender myself I'm not
[1:58:40] going this is not going to continue on
[1:58:42] I'm not going to Proclaim in one moment
[1:58:45] I'm a Son of God and then revert to
[1:58:47] acting like a son of so and so come on
[1:58:49] man if I'm a Son of God I'm a son of God
[1:58:52] if you're a Son of God you're a Son of
[1:58:53] God if you're a daughter of God you're a
[1:58:54] daughter of God what are you saying
[1:58:57] brother Samuel that you have Authority
[1:58:59] or jurisdiction that's right it's not
[1:59:03] coming it's here
[1:59:06] amen it's
[1:59:09] here I say Lord let us
[1:59:12] rise let us
[1:59:14] rise and
[1:59:16] shine our light has
[1:59:19] come the light to show up every Avenue
[1:59:23] throughout our lives yes sir and I say
[1:59:26] throughout this Brandon you can go ahe
[1:59:27] and take it off I say throughout every
[1:59:29] bit of
[1:59:32] this God's here and he's working Amen to
[1:59:37] bring
[1:59:38] lives into
[1:59:40] Grace Grace is working to bring you into
[1:59:43] Grace then when you're in Grace then you
[1:59:46] grow in it that's right you grow in it
[1:59:50] that's right so all through throughout
[1:59:52] even the building those streaming so
[1:59:54] forth God's
[1:59:56] working and we want to be very very very
[1:59:58] sure if there's a call within your heart
[2:00:02] and here God would take a
[2:00:04] man whether it's myself another
[2:00:08] brother doesn't matter the vessel that's
[2:00:10] right it's that you recognize God's
[2:00:12] speaking there you go and God's speaking
[2:00:14] according to the needs in your life
[2:00:18] that's why brother Bram says he said do
[2:00:20] you recognize the seriousness of coming
[2:00:22] to the house of God he said don't look
[2:00:24] at the messenger pay attention to his
[2:00:28] message it's what God is calling us to
[2:00:32] and I tell you what I feel that call oh
[2:00:35] yes Hallelujah you know that call from
[2:00:38] the other side it won't it won't allow
[2:00:39] me to get complacent come on
[2:00:42] preacher it won't allow me to get
[2:00:44] complacent the Holy Ghost when the Holy
[2:00:46] Ghost has come it connects you into your
[2:00:49] theophany that's right it connects into
[2:00:52] that word body because it's that call
[2:00:54] from the other side that's calling you
[2:00:55] to Perfection that's right that's why
[2:00:58] brother BR says when you have left the
[2:01:00] other thing recognize this to be Eagle
[2:01:03] food then you've heard from your
[2:01:05] theophany what he it's finally recogniz
[2:01:08] wait a minute there's a call there you
[2:01:10] go from the other
[2:01:11] side let me just say it very simply God
[2:01:14] dealing with your heart here this
[2:01:15] morning whatever it is it's a craving on
[2:01:19] the inside yes let him be the satisfier
[2:01:22] because only he can only he
[2:01:25] can you can try to satisfy with so many
[2:01:28] other things but only he can satisfied
[2:01:30] let me tell you something and that that
[2:01:33] that is dealing with the new birth
[2:01:34] that's even after the New Birth has come
[2:01:36] nothing else will satisfy it listen you
[2:01:39] could study to your blue in the face
[2:01:41] studying and studying and studying will
[2:01:43] never take the place of dying to
[2:01:45] yourself never never
[2:01:49] never it's yielding
[2:01:52] it's surrendering it's submitting it's
[2:01:56] humility it's humbling ourselves in
[2:01:59] God's presence I tell you if if there's
[2:02:02] something in your heart that's calling
[2:02:04] out for more of God God speaking to your
[2:02:07] life I say thank you Lord yes sir
[2:02:10] circumcise circumcise me Lord maybe it's
[2:02:14] from worldly Fashions maybe it's worldly
[2:02:16] desires ask him Lord you know what my
[2:02:20] heart is my desire is to be free
[2:02:22] lordu and Lord how you've sent this and
[2:02:25] let it be known this morning I Want to
[2:02:27] Be Free Lord circumcising Brother Samuel
[2:02:29] is that all it takes believing yeah
[2:02:33] believing if you believe brother bam
[2:02:36] says as soon as you believe really
[2:02:38] believe really believe he said there is
[2:02:40] released to you Faith that's needed to
[2:02:45] begin to Fly Above those
[2:02:48] things exactly what he said
[2:02:53] amen hallelujah you love
[2:02:56] him why don't we just go to him in
[2:02:58] prayer and let's just each and every one
[2:03:01] let's just pray in our own
[2:03:03] way as we go collectively Before the
[2:03:05] Throne of God here this
[2:03:08] morning why don't you just let's just
[2:03:10] talk to him he's the one to bring forth
[2:03:14] out of our life as we will
[2:03:17] surrender Heavenly
[2:03:19] Father Lord Jesus
[2:03:24] you know every need
[2:03:26] Lord father you you're the one who
[2:03:29] knows being the Eternal one you know the
[2:03:32] end from the
[2:03:34] beginning Lord you know Lord all about
[2:03:38] our lives Lord even when there were or
[2:03:41] the things that begin to Crave and I
[2:03:43] think Lord that I remember even when you
[2:03:46] started in my life were things Lord that
[2:03:50] even when I was still
[2:03:53] was coming on from college Lord that
[2:03:54] first
[2:03:55] year but there was a desire Lord in my
[2:03:58] heart that began to rise up I want
[2:04:02] reality I want
[2:04:04] reality I don't want this life
[2:04:08] anymore Lord Jesus perhaps there's one
[2:04:11] here this morning that maybe they didn't
[2:04:14] just exactly the same
[2:04:16] words but maybe Lord in their mind Lord
[2:04:19] is they've set maybe in service and
[2:04:21] meetings and other places but father
[2:04:24] just even right here this morning that
[2:04:26] they would recognize Lord that
[2:04:29] it's responding Lord to that craving
[2:04:33] that Lord is there in their life there's
[2:04:36] a craving that Lord that they didn't put
[2:04:37] there I never put that there that desire
[2:04:40] you put there but Lord I pray that God
[2:04:43] may they receive Grace Lord to open
[2:04:46] their hearts and Lord to pour out before
[2:04:50] you and Lord God to ask of you this is
[2:04:54] where Lord the feeding they Lord we
[2:04:56] can't look to feed somewhere else Lord
[2:04:58] you bring us the word that we are at
[2:05:01] this moment that Lord that we're to feed
[2:05:03] on what we have need of It's Always a
[2:05:05] paradox to me how that Lord even if it
[2:05:08] was only two people that Lord we would
[2:05:10] be ministering to but how that you
[2:05:12] minister to A diversity of needs Lord
[2:05:15] throughout the building Lord through
[2:05:16] hearts and
[2:05:18] lives and Lord there's lives Lord here
[2:05:20] this morning Lord
[2:05:22] hearts and lives Lord that we've crossed
[2:05:25] over lord into the promised
[2:05:29] land and Lord we we find ourselves Lord
[2:05:32] God as Sons and Daughters of
[2:05:35] God Lord God we want to have our eyes
[2:05:38] set upon the goal Lord that goal Lord is
[2:05:43] adopted Sons and Daughters of God to be
[2:05:47] fully adopted Lord not just born but
[2:05:51] adopted
[2:05:53] I pray that Heavenly
[2:05:55] Father you've given us Grace Lord
[2:05:58] sometimes there's things in our lives
[2:05:59] that we've had to come right back around
[2:06:02] I know I have Lord and I've had to
[2:06:04] repeat certain
[2:06:07] testings Lord I realized that the
[2:06:09] repeating of those
[2:06:11] testings it wasn't because I was special
[2:06:14] it was because there
[2:06:18] was too much
[2:06:20] Samuel too much
[2:06:23] Samuel you'll never Lord you don't come
[2:06:25] by and kill us
[2:06:28] no but I think as it was in
[2:06:32] Gethsemane you never drugged the lamb
[2:06:36] the lamb was
[2:06:38] led and right there at
[2:06:41] Calvary was really a manifestation of a
[2:06:45] victory that took
[2:06:48] place while the Son of God was alone in
[2:06:50] prayer
[2:06:53] oh God help us to see that our real
[2:06:56] Victory I believe Lord sometimes we let
[2:06:59] Escape out of our hands where the real
[2:07:00] Victory
[2:07:02] lays and it's really not it's not even
[2:07:04] just in just prayer alone or or having
[2:07:07] what we call prayer
[2:07:09] time because Lord if we never get beyond
[2:07:13] the realm of these senses we can come
[2:07:16] right back out Lord with the same
[2:07:18] feelings but help us Lord
[2:07:22] help us realize it's not us so much Lord
[2:07:24] of trying to press and pry our way in
[2:07:26] but to
[2:07:28] realize oh God it's
[2:07:31] surrendering it's surrendering like your
[2:07:34] Prophet would tell his little
[2:07:37] nephew c one was a Catholic he had that
[2:07:40] book and he had prayed those prayers
[2:07:42] things didn't happen come to pass and he
[2:07:44] threw it in
[2:07:45] fire brother Brandman spoke to him and
[2:07:47] said what it is he said you're praying
[2:07:49] wrong he said we should never pray to
[2:07:52] change God's mind his mind don't need no
[2:07:56] changing but it's to change our
[2:07:59] mind Lord I'm sure that's I found that
[2:08:03] to be the truth Lord hallu yeah it's
[2:08:05] it's taken years lord it's taken time
[2:08:08] but to realize Lord God I've witnessed
[2:08:11] you do it but it's something of how that
[2:08:12] you bring it Lord to where we can
[2:08:14] actually see what it
[2:08:17] is Lord God to where it's our will
[2:08:22] being
[2:08:24] surrendered but that's nothing that's
[2:08:26] foreign to you you so subjected yourself
[2:08:30] to become one of
[2:08:32] us taking upon the form of man likeness
[2:08:36] of sinful
[2:08:37] flesh great is the mystery of
[2:08:41] godliness oh Father right there in the
[2:08:45] garden it was wrestled
[2:08:47] out your Prophet would use the terms in
[2:08:51] the church Church ages he was contending
[2:08:53] with
[2:08:55] himself Lord that's who we contend with
[2:08:59] is
[2:09:00] ourselves we have to wrestle through
[2:09:02] Lord our own will and we still have
[2:09:06] it just as Lord there in Gethsemane
[2:09:09] nevertheless not my will but thine will
[2:09:13] be done help us Lord I pray help us Lord
[2:09:18] God throughout this building Lord here
[2:09:19] this morning Lord my hands are up Lord
[2:09:22] God I'm asking Lord God for divine
[2:09:24] strength Lord help us Lord I pray Lord
[2:09:28] realizing the responsibility even within
[2:09:31] the ministry realizing responsibility
[2:09:33] Lord as parents realizing Lord the
[2:09:36] responsibility Lord when we look where
[2:09:39] we're standing in this
[2:09:42] age the final verse of Hebrews 11 is
[2:09:45] they without us should not be made
[2:09:49] perfect complete
[2:09:52] it must
[2:09:55] come must be that Ministry
[2:09:59] reproduced I don't believe it's
[2:10:01] something we're looking for I believe
[2:10:03] it's right here
[2:10:04] Lord but it's true it's just like you
[2:10:06] told us through your Prophet it happens
[2:10:10] in such a simple
[2:10:11] way that it's
[2:10:14] overlooked how many seen a AR Noah
[2:10:17] building that Ark overlooked it why
[2:10:21] because your Prophet told us there was
[2:10:24] other
[2:10:24] boats being constructed in that hour but
[2:10:28] only one was God
[2:10:32] constructed Lord help us help us father
[2:10:36] help us to
[2:10:37] grow Lord help us to die to ourselves
[2:10:41] that more of you might grow within us
[2:10:44] Lord help us to yield and died to
[2:10:46] ourselves daily lord it's things as you
[2:10:48] lead us to feed on your word
[2:10:51] help us Lord I pray through tests and
[2:10:54] trials when they come Lord
[2:10:57] adversities Lord just like those virtues
[2:10:59] of the Statue of a perfect man is as we
[2:11:03] go through tests and
[2:11:06] trials Lord Jesus help
[2:11:08] us help us Lord may you Lord God I pray
[2:11:12] bring every life to birth may you
[2:11:15] continue Lord God I've Got Confidence
[2:11:18] Lord there would not be one Lord God
[2:11:20] name on that Lamb's Book of Life that'll
[2:11:22] miss it
[2:11:23] Lord that craving that desire that's
[2:11:26] there Lord and you're continuing to mold
[2:11:28] and shape Lord God our lives more and
[2:11:31] more into your image Lord help us help
[2:11:34] us to get out of the way Lord we don't
[2:11:37] want to stay Lord as little children in
[2:11:39] every Lord in this thing and that thing

[2:22:59] brother wonderful
[2:23:01] Ministry uh I I got a chance to listen
[2:23:06] when he ministered there in Virginia and
[2:23:08] even though the streaming was all cut up
[2:23:10] I was broke up and I told Brother Sean
[2:23:12] he was apologizing for I said don't
[2:23:13] apologize it was good I could go right
[2:23:16] through it it was really really good
[2:23:17] amen what what he ministered amen I
[2:23:19] thought the whole really the whole
[2:23:21] meeting the continuity was so so
[2:23:23] wonderful how the Lord brought that
[2:23:24] around and um but we just I'm so
[2:23:27] thankful to have brother wend here with
[2:23:29] us and God just laid it upon our heart
[2:23:30] to have him and um so I want you to I
[2:23:34] want to I want to just say this to you
[2:23:37] um I want you just to think of that word
[2:23:40] throughout the week on
[2:23:42] expectation and um if you think back to
[2:23:44] the part of that quote I read out of
[2:23:46] things that are to be when brother
[2:23:47] brandham he just asked the question
[2:23:49] where it says why why do we need
[2:23:51] revivals and brother brandom answer he's
[2:23:53] posing that question the why that's
[2:23:56] needed is because there's Cravings in
[2:23:58] the body and I tell you what I I pray
[2:24:02] that throughout this right here that our
[2:24:04] hearts even as we get through this week
[2:24:06] don't just come to Friday service or
[2:24:09] this weekend empty-handed that's right
[2:24:13] but come to it and really just be in
[2:24:15] prayer throughout the week really be
[2:24:18] diligent and in prayer
[2:24:20] let me tell you the
[2:24:23] atmosphere is not brought by the man
[2:24:25] who's preaching no
[2:24:27] sir the atmosphere is not brought by the
[2:24:29] organ or by the
[2:24:31] piano the atmosphere is created by
[2:24:35] hearts that are in one Accord with
[2:24:38] God it's calling out to God brother Bram
[2:24:41] tells us he said when you taken a man
[2:24:43] that's anointed a walk in a congregation
[2:24:45] that's prayed up and expecting he said
[2:24:48] it's unlimited what God will do that's
[2:24:50] right and I'm going to tell you there's
[2:24:52] needs right here in our own
[2:24:55] assembly God allows us and puts a burden
[2:24:58] on our heart to have the meetings I say
[2:25:02] let's just come under such an
[2:25:04] expectation let me tell you do you know
[2:25:06] how you get under
[2:25:08] expectation I don't mean to keep you but
[2:25:10] it's a separate thought
[2:25:12] altoe when they would go to visit
[2:25:15] Spurgeon where Spurgeon preached and
[2:25:18] ministered they came there
[2:25:20] they didn't see anybody sitting up
[2:25:23] here and Spurgeon when they showed up
[2:25:25] they said hey where where's where's the
[2:25:26] Revival at Spurgeon pointed to the
[2:25:28] Boiler Room 400 people packed in the
[2:25:31] basement of the
[2:25:33] church Spurgeon said you want to know
[2:25:36] the
[2:25:37] success is through prayer that's
[2:25:40] Spurgeon called it the power
[2:25:44] room and that's why I say what what will
[2:25:46] create that expectation in our hearts
[2:25:48] just prayer even as you're at work
[2:25:51] remember you to pray you don't got to
[2:25:52] close your eyes that's right you can
[2:25:54] there'll be times of that but just be in
[2:25:56] prayer

[2:26:16] going to be others coming with other

[2:27:18] weekend we're asking God that you would
[2:27:20] move in a very special
[2:27:23] way Lord I think many times when the
[2:27:26] prophet he would take Services when the
[2:27:30] congregation was getting ready Lord to
[2:27:32] have a real
[2:27:34] meeting and he spoke of the effects of
[2:27:36] what it was when people begin to really
[2:27:40] come under expectation and those
[2:27:42] meetings on the Holy Ghost were
[2:27:43] ministered and and the prophet came
[2:27:46] around and said the reason the effect in
[2:27:48] these Services was because
[2:27:50] of your Consecration and sincerity and
[2:27:53] praying
[2:27:54] up then he would speak in his own life
[2:27:57] when he would preach that message images
[2:27:59] of Christ and he said while the
[2:28:01] Tabernacle is having a Revival I want to
[2:28:03] have one
[2:28:04] too said I want more of the Holy Ghost
[2:28:07] to take over more William Brown Lord God
