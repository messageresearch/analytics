[40:12] now Lord and asking your blessing on the
[40:14] further part of the service in the name
[40:16] of Jesus Christ amen amen
[40:20] will you turn with me to revelations 14
[40:22] I want to look here
[40:26] revelations 14 tonight just a few verses
[40:30] of Scripture
[40:37] revelations 14 verse 1 and I looked and
[40:43] lo a lamb stood on the Mount Zion and
[40:49] with him 144,000 having his father's
[40:53] name written in their foreheads now this
[40:57] is this is after you know this is after
[41:00] the rapture this is after the
[41:01] tribulation this is this is after that
[41:04] of Armageddon here what we're looking at
[41:07] is now to see God's great accomplishment
[41:11] and achievement look at this and I
[41:14] looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount
[41:16] Zion and with him 144,000 having his
[41:21] father's name written in their foreheads
[41:24] and I heard a voice from heaven as the
[41:27] voice of many waters and as the voice of
[41:30] a great Thunder and I heard the voice of
[41:33] harpers harping with their harps and
[41:37] they sung as it were a new song before
[41:41] the throne and before the four beasts
[41:45] and the elders look what access and what
[41:49] their privileged tune right now what
[41:52] access and what privilege before the
[41:54] throne they sung as it were a new song
[41:57] and no man could learn that song but the
[42:02] hundred and forty-four thousand which
[42:05] were redeemed from the earth I want you
[42:09] to notice those words tonight which were
[42:11] redeemed from the earth these are they
[42:14] which were not defiled with women for
[42:16] they are virgins these are they which
[42:19] follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth
[42:23] these were redeemed from among men being
[42:27] the firstfruits unto God and to the lamb
[42:30] and in their mouth was found no guile
[42:32] for they are without fault before the
[42:35] throne of God amen may God bless his
[42:38] word bless use your being seated tonight
[42:41] we know that in this scripture were
[42:44] looking at a time of where that Israel
[42:48] themselves comes into the glorious
[42:53] revelation of who the Messiah is and
[42:57] also their part within it to Israel
[43:01] itself where where they will be saved
[43:04] where God Himself will accomplish what
[43:08] he started and I know we when we look at
[43:11] this here within the scripture as we
[43:13] started here in Exodus 15 and and you
[43:17] realize that so much in Exodus 15 when
[43:20] you read it there's so much of things
[43:22] that Moses would come under the joy of
[43:26] what he saw take place and remember with
[43:29] the Egyptians they saw on the seashore
[43:31] but mem says when he saw that Moses
[43:34] entered into the spirit and you realized
[43:37] so much was spoken then of what had
[43:39] happened and yet as you read through it
[43:42] which we went over that sometimes you
[43:44] read and you see where there is much of
[43:46] it that is prophecy that was actually
[43:49] going to come where Israel would come
[43:51] into the land and then there's still
[43:53] prophecy of when Israel themselves would
[43:56] actually come in to the position that
[43:58] God had ordained for them there's still
[44:01] also a part even in Exodus 15 that
[44:04] pertains even prophetically speaking of
[44:06] the bride of Jesus Christ also that even
[44:09] of those who will of the Gentiles that
[44:12] will come through the tribulation period
[44:14] so there's much within that of Exodus 15
[44:17] of how that when you come to the real
[44:20] some of it and you look that it's all
[44:22] the Lord's doing that's one thing that
[44:25] when we look at all of it in Exodus 15
[44:27] is the Lord will help us here you find
[44:29] that it's all he's doing and truly
[44:31] that's something that you and I we
[44:33] become more aware of I know I've said it
[44:35] a lot but it's something that for me I
[44:37] just become more aware of you find
[44:39] things to where you and I can have
[44:41] burdens and desires on our heart things
[44:43] that we know that are necessary but yet
[44:46] within it we're looking and saying you
[44:48] know Lord how does this happen how is
[44:50] this performed how is this brought about
[44:52] but you know when God gives us a
[44:54] for something it isn't that God would
[44:57] drop that burden in her heart and then
[44:58] ask for us to use human instrumentality
[45:01] to perform it but what God wants us to
[45:04] do when he drops a burden in our heart
[45:06] is that we might take that burden and
[45:08] pray about that burden and put it before
[45:11] God and then watch God who dropped the
[45:13] burden which is what his desire is once
[45:16] God bring to manifestation the burden
[45:19] that he's placed on our hearts we see
[45:21] that over and over God it's not looking
[45:23] and he does not want our human
[45:25] instrumentality he doesn't need us to
[45:27] bring the word to pass the only thing
[45:29] that he needs is for us to be obedient
[45:31] and submit to him he'll bring the word
[45:33] to pass and so when we see this here
[45:37] tonight and we look at it there is that
[45:39] of Israel that which is redeemed as the
[45:42] Scriptures we read here that when we
[45:44] think of this in Redemption you know
[45:46] that Redemption itself is that we're in
[45:49] that one who actually already and always
[45:52] belonged now is brought back to the one
[45:55] in whom has do they always belong to so
[45:58] when we see these words redeemed and
[46:00] we'll look at them through the
[46:01] scriptures tonight that redeemed itself
[46:04] is we're in that how that God it will
[46:06] speak that these here of the 144,000
[46:09] that they themselves are also in the
[46:12] Lamb's Book of Life the lamb section
[46:14] they are also those in Revelation six
[46:17] which when it says that of the fifth
[46:19] seal is open and you find that of the
[46:21] martyrs who of that during the time as
[46:24] brother Ben calls it the amateur
[46:25] tribulation or pre tribulation time of
[46:28] Eichmann where in that you know that
[46:30] those spirits were released against the
[46:32] Jews to actually to drive Israel back to
[46:35] the homeland and brother Brandon goes
[46:37] into that they're laying that out for us
[46:39] that even those in that time as they're
[46:41] crying out how long till thou avenge and
[46:43] brother brems says how he goes into the
[46:45] scripture how they are given white robes
[46:47] he said see they also are elect of God
[46:50] having being given white robes their
[46:53] names on the Lamb's Book of Life so to
[46:55] recognize that Redemption itself is that
[46:59] which actually always belonged to him
[47:01] and God never forgets what belongs to
[47:04] him the whole process itself the Bible
[47:08] self is a great love story being
[47:10] unfolded from God's mind his heart and a
[47:13] great love story that's being unfolded
[47:15] and I I trust you tonight that even as
[47:17] the Lord would just move through the
[47:19] word that we can see the parallel of how
[47:22] that God would deal with Israel in order
[47:25] to bring Israel back into position and
[47:27] back into her homeland it's the same
[47:29] thing that God has done and is doing
[47:32] with our lives even right now so when we
[47:35] look at this with Redemption and
[47:37] thinking of election notice in Romans 11
[47:40] verse 1 I say then hath God cast away
[47:44] his people god forbid for I also AM an
[47:49] Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the
[47:52] tribe of Benjamin now remember that it
[47:55] was Israel themselves they rejected here
[47:58] the Messiah when he come because as
[48:00] we'll read here in a few moments it was
[48:02] because of blindness now to see how all
[48:05] of that had come about there were
[48:07] traditions there were all of those
[48:09] things that God had permitted to come
[48:11] and we see all of that making away to
[48:14] where they could not identify the very
[48:17] simplicity of how that God himself would
[48:20] come and come down among him did they
[48:22] have the word they did have the word
[48:24] they had the writings of the prophets
[48:26] they had the law they had everything as
[48:29] far as writings that one could have but
[48:33] you see it just goes to show that just
[48:35] to have the writings alone is not enough
[48:37] it has to be the Spirit of God working
[48:41] with the election of God that will
[48:44] actually bring the eyes to be open I'll
[48:47] tell you as we look at this here tonight
[48:48] I trust that it becomes more real to you
[48:51] that it is not our strivings and what we
[48:53] have done it is God's grace that has
[48:56] been poured out upon us if we see
[48:58] tonight it's because that the grace of
[49:00] God has been poured out upon our lives
[49:03] and so to see this of how that Israel
[49:06] remember that Israel even in the time of
[49:08] Paul's ministry here the Lord Jesus had
[49:11] spoke that there would be a trotting
[49:12] down there at Jerusalem and remember
[49:15] even after the Lord Jesus was offered up
[49:17] and that Calvary and the resurrection
[49:20] remember that even in Jerusalem that
[49:22] went on for many years but then you find
[49:25] the scriptures there in the book of Acts
[49:26] where Paul is members bringing the word
[49:29] and the gospel to the Jews and when it
[49:31] reaches its final moment then he says
[49:33] hello
[49:34] we turned from the Jews unto the
[49:36] Gentiles the brother Graham picks that
[49:37] up that's then when you find in this
[49:39] letting go of Titus his besiegement now
[49:42] coming against Jerusalem but yet within
[49:45] it all God has not forgotten Jerusalem
[49:48] so to see how that Paul would pick this
[49:50] up by being able to look back into the
[49:52] Old Testament and the prophesies of
[49:54] which the Jews themselves were looking
[49:57] for God hath not cast away his people
[50:02] which he foreknew glory what he not what
[50:08] the scripture said of Elijah how he
[50:10] maketh intercession to God against
[50:13] Israel saying Lord they have killed by
[50:15] prophets and digged down thine altars
[50:17] and I am left alone and they seek my
[50:20] life but what saith the answer of God
[50:22] unto him I have reserved to myself seven
[50:27] thousand men who have not bowed the knee
[50:30] to the image of bow even so then at this
[50:35] present time see what's how Paul under
[50:39] the inspiration of the Holy Ghost can
[50:41] reach back and pick that up
[50:43] where in Elijah's ministry and the type
[50:46] of it was that there was a minority
[50:48] there was a elect that was reserved in
[50:52] that hour and Paul can reach back by the
[50:55] Spirit of Jesus Christ remember the
[50:57] testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit
[51:00] of prophecy he can look right back and
[51:03] see that expression and bring it forward
[51:05] and say that that even is is an actual
[51:08] representation and a prophecy that even
[51:11] at this present time there is a remnant
[51:14] according to the election of grace
[51:20] and if by grace then it is no more of
[51:24] works is that right so it's no more well
[51:31] I did this I did this
[51:33] and God knowing this and that that's not
[51:35] at all that's still your works well I
[51:38] cried and I sought after God
[51:40] that's your works it is not our crying
[51:43] that has got God's attention the real
[51:46] reality any brokenness about our life to
[51:50] where that we and ourselves would be
[51:52] moved to repentance it's because he has
[51:55] already made a choice and the spirit of
[51:58] grace is being poured out upon our lives
[52:01] so it is nothing that we can take credit
[52:04] for then all of a sudden we've done
[52:06] something and God came by and he just
[52:09] seemed that we meant business know that
[52:11] still fleshly carnal glory it is all the
[52:15] work of the grace of Almighty God you
[52:20] might have forgot God but he never
[52:22] forgot you and if by grace then it's no
[52:26] more of works otherwise grace is no more
[52:31] grace but if it be of works then and
[52:34] it's no more grace otherwise work is no
[52:37] more work not what then Israel hath not
[52:42] obtained that which he seeketh for in
[52:45] that an odd statement he was seeking for
[52:47] it but he didn't obtain it why he wasn't
[52:50] looking for it in the right way remember
[52:53] Paul goes on to let this be known to us
[52:56] I believe it's Romans 9 where Paul says
[52:59] because they sought it not by faith but
[53:03] as it were by works you see it was not
[53:06] that they could do anything to merit it
[53:09] you realized that even when they would
[53:11] have went back and begin to reflect
[53:13] there in Deuteronomy God let it be known
[53:16] that I didn't call you out because you
[53:18] were more of a people than anybody else
[53:21] I called you out and brought you out of
[53:23] Egypt because I made a promise to your
[53:26] father's
[53:28] you see God works by it's promised world
[53:32] can we have confidence in that then if
[53:36] we can have confidence which we should
[53:37] that God performs his promised word then
[53:41] how can there be any way that a bride of
[53:44] Jesus Christ the real bride can come
[53:47] back with anything less than the full
[53:50] world because you would have a woman who
[53:53] is part believing part doubting but you
[53:56] see far to be the bride of Jesus Christ
[53:59] it's got to believe that God is God and
[54:02] God keeps every one of his promises and
[54:06] so to see this then that they sought it
[54:10] not by faith but by works but the
[54:15] election hath obtained it and the rest
[54:19] were blinded notice the election and the
[54:23] rest according as it's written God hath
[54:27] given them the spirit of slumber eyes
[54:30] that they should not see and ears that
[54:33] they should not hear unto this day so
[54:35] there's an elect rim not to think of
[54:38] this how that God would call Israel out
[54:40] of Egypt remember even he called Israel
[54:43] of Egypt there were two out of those
[54:46] millions that were actually of the
[54:49] election is that right it was only two
[54:52] that was of the election the rest of
[54:54] them jesus said they died in the
[54:57] wilderness they perish there but you see
[55:00] Joshua and Caleb to put it plainly as
[55:02] the prophet spoken in the message
[55:04] he said it took an effect upon Joshua
[55:06] and Caleb to know what the message was
[55:09] really all about are you with me now so
[55:13] you see then there is in the time of
[55:15] Elisha there is the seven thousand that
[55:18] God had reserved to himself now watch
[55:20] what this does even though Joshua and
[55:22] Caleb even though you have the seven
[55:24] thousand even though you have with Ezra
[55:26] and Nehemiah and the returning remnant
[55:28] even though that you have within each of
[55:30] them they are better the election but
[55:32] what's the grace of God as the grace of
[55:35] God goes forth it stirs them out because
[55:38] they are a part of the
[55:40] and that of the word that is to be
[55:43] fulfilled in that hour and the spirit of
[55:46] grace moving upon their life it actually
[55:49] brings them in position hey that's
[55:51] exactly what it's done for you and I
[55:52] it's been the spirit of grace not the
[55:55] spirit of law it's the spirit of God's
[55:57] grace and when God's grace moves it
[55:59] writes upon our hearts the very laws of
[56:02] Almighty God it brings about a change so
[56:06] that you and I are not looking at
[56:07] something on the outside but we and
[56:10] ourselves have within our lives by the
[56:13] grace of God the word written upon the
[56:16] tablets of our heart to where Paul could
[56:18] say you are written epistles read of all
[56:22] men so to recognize that which the
[56:25] Spirit of God Himself has expressly
[56:27] wrote and now is made manifest so you
[56:30] see it's God Himself drawing us to him
[56:35] for us to even seek after him it's
[56:39] because he's drawing us so you find that
[56:47] even in the time when you find that the
[56:51] Jews coming back out of Babylon after
[56:52] captivity there was a remnant not all
[56:56] the Jews came and not all of them came
[56:58] at the same time you see there had to be
[57:03] Azra come first then you find me and
[57:06] mine in them coming right and even
[57:08] before Ezra there was others who came
[57:10] before Ezra right so then you find there
[57:14] is a remnant the Bible says remember who
[57:17] and when even when Cyrus recognizes his
[57:20] position he said whosoever that that
[57:23] that the Lord his spirit is with him to
[57:25] stir him up to fulfill this word so it
[57:29] was not men trying to fulfill the
[57:32] prophecy it was God stirring up the
[57:35] hearts to fulfill the prophecy because
[57:38] they were gonna face adversity but you
[57:41] see when God already knows what
[57:43] adversity even they were going to face
[57:45] he knows what adversity you and I were
[57:48] gonna face but the Bible is very clear
[57:49] he strengthens us before
[57:53] ever encompassed glory be to God blessed
[57:58] be the name of the Lord
[57:59] you see even in the time of the Lord
[58:01] Jesus there was a minority
[58:05] a minority that was looking for him yet
[58:10] if you looked and asked no doubt
[58:12] throughout all of Israel they would say
[58:14] we're looking for the Messiah but yet
[58:16] there was a minority who was looking for
[58:20] him Bill Graham tells us in birth pains
[58:22] that small little church Anna Simeon I
[58:26] can't remember the others build a few
[58:27] many names off it was only those who
[58:29] were looking now watch this what's the
[58:31] spirit of grace preparing this Luke
[58:34] chapter 2 verse 25 and behold there was
[58:37] a man in Jerusalem notice whose name was
[58:40] Simeon where was he at in Jerusalem and
[58:45] the same man was just and devout waiting
[58:49] for the consolation of Israel and the
[58:52] Holy Ghost was upon him it was the
[58:55] Spirit of God that was upon Simeon at
[58:58] this time he was waiting for that
[59:00] consolation remember Israel was looking
[59:03] for the Messiah because through the
[59:05] Messiah it would come that of redemption
[59:08] and that in itself would be the
[59:10] outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the
[59:13] kingdom would be set up here upon this
[59:16] earth did they not ask the Lord Jesus
[59:18] before he ascended they're asking him
[59:21] millennial terms when will the kingdom
[59:23] be restored to Israel right but he
[59:30] didn't tell them he didn't tell them at
[59:34] that time will glory be to God and it
[59:40] was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost
[59:43] I love that that he should not see death
[59:48] before he had seen the Lord's Christ
[59:54] wonderful was simians great great great
[59:57] great great great great great great
[59:58] great great great great great grandchild
[1:00:00] that said when he boarded that flight
[1:00:01] maybe from Iran that said we're not
[1:00:03] going back there to die we're going back
[1:00:05] to see the Messiah well it might not
[1:00:08] have been in the natural but he was also
[1:00:10] under the influence and the direction of
[1:00:13] the Holy Ghost
[1:00:16] glory be to God think of the Syria and
[1:00:19] to see this in Romans 11 for I would not
[1:00:23] brethren that you should be ignorant of
[1:00:26] this mystery
[1:00:28] lest you should be wise in your own
[1:00:31] conceits you see it was a mystery this
[1:00:34] was not seen of the taking of the
[1:00:37] Gentile bride
[1:00:39] ball goes into right the covenants all
[1:00:41] those things that pertain to Israel but
[1:00:44] what was not seen is the taking of a
[1:00:47] Gentile bond but remember Joseph has
[1:00:49] brethren but he came to get a bride a
[1:00:53] man one can never take the place of the
[1:00:57] other then to see how Paul would going
[1:00:59] to write this lest you should be wise in
[1:01:02] your own conceits that blindness in part
[1:01:05] has happened to Israel until the
[1:01:09] fullness of the Gentiles be come in I'll
[1:01:13] tell you right now
[1:01:14] we're here we're here the Bible's clear
[1:01:18] when you begin to see that fig tree
[1:01:20] putting forth her buds that fig tree
[1:01:24] represents Israel she's now back in her
[1:01:28] homeland they write all of these things
[1:01:31] with the prophecies throughout the
[1:01:33] scriptures everything just coming and
[1:01:35] tying together and so all Israel shall
[1:01:38] be saved
[1:01:40] does that mean every Jew no all Israel
[1:01:44] come on the Bible says in the Book of
[1:01:46] Isaiah he said the Lord has sent a word
[1:01:49] unto Jacob and he hath lightened upon
[1:01:52] Israel there is a world that is set to
[1:01:55] Jacob but it will lighten upon Israel
[1:01:58] you with me not every Jew but all Israel
[1:02:01] of the hundred and forty-four thousand
[1:02:04] shall be saved as it is written there
[1:02:08] shall not come out there shall come out
[1:02:10] of Zion the deliverer and shall turn
[1:02:12] away ungodliness from Jacob for this is
[1:02:16] my covenant unto them when I shall take
[1:02:18] away their sins is that not what he's
[1:02:22] done for us that he himself has come to
[1:02:25] remove ungodliness from our life where
[1:02:28] does he go he goes to the very root of
[1:02:30] the problem he's not going to try to
[1:02:33] make every little thing we do just
[1:02:35] perfect he goes to the root of the
[1:02:37] problem remember he himself come there
[1:02:40] filled with that spirit of the law of
[1:02:43] the spirit of life there of Jesus Christ
[1:02:46] and to think over there it was a life
[1:02:48] that lived
[1:02:49] in victory and manifested that work and
[1:02:51] then that varied and that very reality
[1:02:54] being birth within our hearts it brings
[1:02:57] that reality where there is a release
[1:02:59] from ungodliness it wouldn't matter if a
[1:03:04] person never did a thing is still
[1:03:06] ungodly because the first birth were
[1:03:09] under the condemnation is that right
[1:03:12] so to notice here all Israel shall be
[1:03:15] saved now to think of this of God's
[1:03:18] great providential working you know
[1:03:20] brother Graham will say it like this he
[1:03:21] says in that sixth seal it's the
[1:03:23] Tribulation Period and this is what
[1:03:25] takes place the bride has gone there's
[1:03:27] no living creature speaking of one of
[1:03:29] those of the four living creatures there
[1:03:31] nothing there to say it so there was no
[1:03:33] announcement there either at the fifth
[1:03:35] seal or the sixth seal now God is not
[1:03:37] dealing with the church no more it's
[1:03:39] been gone he's dealing with Israel so
[1:03:42] and the finishing up here of the
[1:03:44] Gentiles the Spirit of God that here is
[1:03:47] upon the Gentile church
[1:03:48] it will move forth upon the two
[1:03:50] witnesses and then the scripture is
[1:03:52] clear let him that's filthy be filthy
[1:03:54] still there will not be within that time
[1:03:58] anymore with when the same within the
[1:04:00] Gentiles God will not be dealing anymore
[1:04:02] with the Gentiles at that time but he
[1:04:05] will be dealing expressly with the Jews
[1:04:07] just like even in this hour right now he
[1:04:10] is expressly dealing with his bride
[1:04:13] there are other it listen we're not
[1:04:15] going anywhere until every member every
[1:04:17] one that is wrote on the Lamb's Book of
[1:04:20] Life because he will not lose one he's
[1:04:24] not going to go anywhere until he has
[1:04:26] each and every one that's what he's
[1:04:29] doing he's claiming his subjects by his
[1:04:32] word as he's ministering to our hearts
[1:04:34] so to see God's grace in dealing with
[1:04:36] our life but I'm says God is not dealing
[1:04:39] with the church no more it's been gone
[1:04:41] he's dealing with Israel this is the
[1:04:43] other side this is when Israel receives
[1:04:46] the message of the kingdom by the two
[1:04:48] prophets of revelations 11 remember
[1:04:51] Israel is a nation
[1:04:54] the bride is not a nation the bride is
[1:04:57] the wife Israel is a nation God's
[1:05:01] servant nation and when Israel is
[1:05:04] brought in it'll be a national affair
[1:05:08] Israel the kingdom aid is where David
[1:05:11] the son of David sets on the throne so
[1:05:13] he breaks on over there in the
[1:05:14] Millennium now notice here in the
[1:05:16] scriptures in Zechariah chapter 10 verse
[1:05:18] 6 of how that God would speak here this
[1:05:21] Redemption many places in the scripture
[1:05:23] but notice he says I will strengthen the
[1:05:26] house of Judah and I will save the house
[1:05:28] of Joseph and I will bring them again to
[1:05:31] place them for I have mercy upon them
[1:05:34] and they shall be as though I had not
[1:05:37] cast them off for I am the Lord their
[1:05:40] God and will hear them oh my we can stay
[1:05:44] on that a long time but if you'll notice
[1:05:46] no part in there it's me I will I will I
[1:05:52] will I will I will I will
[1:05:56] so who's getting the glory he is this is
[1:06:01] his sovereign Providence you're working
[1:06:04] by his spirit notice I will bring them
[1:06:08] again to place them not just bring them
[1:06:11] in into the land but to place them in
[1:06:14] the land you see this is a time for
[1:06:16] Israel to be positioned it's a time for
[1:06:21] her to be positioned as a nation before
[1:06:25] I mageddon been dead before the
[1:06:27] millennium such it's a time for her to
[1:06:29] be positioned just as you and I receive
[1:06:33] our positioning in Christ right now as

[1:06:39] of the Spirit of God baptized by one

[1:07:00] I am the Lord their God and will hear
[1:07:01] them do you realize that it comes a time
[1:07:04] even when God works with Israel here
[1:07:06] that there is a time for Mourning and
[1:07:08] then there's a time to turn that morning
[1:07:10] to where they come to that fountain they
[1:07:12] received that cleansing that of the
[1:07:14] baptism of the holy ghost it's a timed
[1:07:16] in for them to rejoice job does not want
[1:07:19] Israel walking around mourning and
[1:07:22] dragging for what she did in the past
[1:07:25] oh listen to me now job does not watch
[1:07:28] you walking around or me walking around
[1:07:30] and dragging in the past he wants to
[1:07:33] remove the former sales the former
[1:07:36] remembrance and that's why the Spirit of
[1:07:39] God moves in our life behold all things
[1:07:42] have become new amen we become new
[1:07:47] creatures in Christ Jesus glory be to
[1:07:53] God and they have ephraim shall be like
[1:07:56] a mighty man and their heart shall
[1:07:58] rejoice as through wine as through wine

[1:08:10] mighty by who him
[1:08:15] yeah their children shall see it and be
[1:08:18] glad their heart shall rejoice in the
[1:08:20] Lord no what's the scripture boy I about
[1:08:22] lost myself and I will hiss for them you
[1:08:28] know this word hiss means it means to
[1:08:31] whistle or pipe as a signal God's gonna
[1:08:35] sing a song I will hiss for them and
[1:08:43] gather them for I have redeemed you mean
[1:08:49] he's not going to know he already has
[1:08:51] redeemed them remember the Feast of the
[1:08:56] atonement in Leviticus 23 is not another
[1:09:00] killing of the lamb it Nevada cursed
[1:09:03] three mentions nothing about killing
[1:09:06] another lamp it points back till the
[1:09:09] lamb killed in the Passover you with me
[1:09:14] this is the revealing to you and I even
[1:09:17] in this hour
[1:09:18] it's not another lamb it is the
[1:09:21] revealing of the true atonement to point
[1:09:24] out what he has already done
[1:09:27] I will hiss for them it's a signal
[1:09:33] brother bill well who get the signal
[1:09:36] those who are the certain sound - it'll
[1:09:39] be a certain sound to them they start
[1:09:41] assembling what at his hissing his
[1:09:45] planting his whistling his signal will
[1:09:49] glory be to God and they shall increase
[1:09:52] as they have increased so they've
[1:09:55] already been redeemed when at Calvary
[1:09:57] right but just as the Prophet tells us
[1:10:00] some souls in prison now that when the
[1:10:02] word comes across to our path that that
[1:10:04] is when Christ himself thoroughly
[1:10:06] redeems you and I he makes real and
[1:10:10] personal that Calvary was not a
[1:10:12] wholesale affair Calvary was with you in
[1:10:15] mind
[1:10:16] it's personal are you with me when that
[1:10:19] blue net name is splashed beneath that
[1:10:21] Clorox bleach notice Zechariah 10 9 and
[1:10:24] I will show them among the people notice
[1:10:28] how it breaks back and forth I will sow
[1:10:30] them among the people now if you saw
[1:10:34] something that's seed and seed itself is
[1:10:39] going to bring forth at the right time
[1:10:41] so I will sell them among the people so
[1:10:45] here is Israel being scattered and
[1:10:47] dispersed and they shall remember me in
[1:10:51] far countries and they shall live with
[1:10:55] their children and turn again and I will
[1:10:59] bring them again also out of the land of
[1:11:03] each of notice here here is he's typing
[1:11:05] the south and gather them out of Assyria
[1:11:07] and I will bring them into the land of
[1:11:10] Gilead and Lebanon and and place
[1:11:13] not be found for them look at this in
[1:11:17] verse 11 and he shall pass through the
[1:11:21] sea with the fliction oh here goes
[1:11:26] another journey through the sea he shall
[1:11:30] pass through the sea with the fliction
[1:11:31] and shall smack the waves in the sea and
[1:11:34] all the deeps of the river shall drive
[1:11:36] notice how both were brought out here
[1:11:38] there was a parting of the sea and there
[1:11:41] was also a parting of the river Jordan
[1:11:43] right had to come through the sea there
[1:11:47] a consuming of enemies and they had to
[1:11:49] go through the Jordan to come into
[1:11:51] position Oh glory be to God and the
[1:11:56] pride of Assyria shall be brought down
[1:11:58] you know as these are speaking of
[1:11:59] spiritual powers here and the scepter of
[1:12:02] Egypt shall depart away and I will
[1:12:06] strengthen them in the Lord and they
[1:12:08] shall walk up and down in his name saith
[1:12:12] the Lord I think of the scripture in
[1:12:16] Isaiah 43 6 where it says I will say to
[1:12:19] the north give up my sons I will say to
[1:12:23] these let my daughters return you see
[1:12:27] God himself his voice though the rest of
[1:12:30] the earth cannot hear it but those sons
[1:12:33] and daughters are hearing him say come
[1:12:37] back home come back home come back home
[1:12:42] what's he doing he's hissing for them
[1:12:46] he's signaling for them come back home
[1:12:52] he listened friends when the baptism of
[1:12:55] the Holy Ghost breaks upon our soul in
[1:12:58] the new birth listen that is a
[1:13:00] manifestation that we were already
[1:13:03] redeemed at Calvary and he goes clear
[1:13:06] back to the mind of God where it says in
[1:13:08] Revelation 13:8 the lamb was slain
[1:13:11] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:14] it reaches clear back into joel when the
[1:13:16] sons of God shouted for joy
[1:13:19] men shouting they're represented there's
[1:13:21] a lamb that's one that is here to bring
[1:13:24] us back home girl would be the dawn out
[1:13:28] say to the north give up I love it I say
[1:13:34] I say tonight one of the authority here
[1:13:36] they've listened if Israel being moved
[1:13:39] under that signal what about a bride
[1:13:43] that comes in life with the option of a
[1:13:45] Holy Spirit in this hour to manifest and
[1:13:49] reflect on earth what's taken place in
[1:13:51] heaven the Prophet tells us he said if
[1:13:55] he moves his hand in heaven there must
[1:13:57] be a movement on the other the movements
[1:14:03] that's going on in the heaven are being
[1:14:06] reflected in the earth one a unity
[1:14:10] that's coming here
[1:14:14] Hosea 6:1 come let us return unto the
[1:14:21] Lord for he hath torn and he will heal
[1:14:25] us
[1:14:26] he has smitten and he will bind us up I
[1:14:30] want you to catch this come let us
[1:14:33] return unto the Lord this is a beckoning
[1:14:37] going out that - into Israel gathering
[1:14:40] them back home this is the same listen
[1:14:42] this same beckoning comes over to us as
[1:14:46] the bride of Jesus Christ come let us
[1:14:48] return unto the Lord because remember
[1:14:51] here down through the ages notice how
[1:14:53] the outpouring of the Holy Spirit would
[1:14:55] come as he's making a bad Gentile bride
[1:14:57] but there has to come a time of
[1:15:00] completion because the bride herself he
[1:15:03] comes from down through the ages to
[1:15:05] where Christ Himself does not marry a
[1:15:07] little girl but he marries and unites
[1:15:10] with a mature woman one who is of his
[1:15:14] choosing
[1:15:15] she is the secret the mystery that was
[1:15:19] in him
[1:15:21] she is that what she United with while
[1:15:24] Israel was in blindness Joseph United
[1:15:28] with a Gentile bride it's the same
[1:15:33] spirit of god that would call us as the
[1:15:36] bride of Jesus Christ remember when all
[1:15:38] many of Christendom it looks as though
[1:15:41] it's worshiping the Lord but yet they
[1:15:43] drifted from the real reality of a real
[1:15:47] walk with Almighty God where there's
[1:15:49] really been a birth of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:51] in their life it's drifted to church
[1:15:54] isms and and church anity and just
[1:15:57] knowing this and knowing that well but
[1:15:59] the call is come let us return unto the
[1:16:03] Lord
[1:16:05] look what assurance he's torn but he'll
[1:16:09] heal us he's smitten
[1:16:13] but he'll bind us up after two days he
[1:16:18] will revive us in the third day he will
[1:16:22] raise us up and we shall live in his
[1:16:24] side one who can really deal with the
[1:16:26] pools on this one right here but to see
[1:16:28] how that God after two days after 2,000
[1:16:31] years he will revive us notice they are
[1:16:34] there they are in left remember as Paul
[1:16:36] said there is an elect according to his
[1:16:38] foreknowledge just like he's tapped into
[1:16:40] 7,000 there in the time of Elisha but
[1:16:43] notice it's him that revives them to
[1:16:46] come at that time it's not a man
[1:16:51] it's not a president God will use
[1:16:55] vessels but it's not the vessel it's God
[1:17:00] moving all the sea
[1:17:03] come on somebody it's just like in this
[1:17:07] hour to see this is a time Jerusalem
[1:17:11] must be recognized as the capital you
[1:17:16] know I you know that shells because it's
[1:17:18] fixin to break forth after there of the
[1:17:21] tribulation and after on the getting
[1:17:24] where your Jerusalem is the center of
[1:17:26] worship
[1:17:28] we'll repeat of God Pulsar ways you said
[1:17:37] mother Samuel that's President Trump
[1:17:39] remember as I said last week who was
[1:17:41] Cyrus maybe there was you know Cyrus
[1:17:46] showers I don't know
[1:17:49] Cyrus real-estate but one thing about it
[1:17:52] if you read the scripture it says that
[1:17:54] God held him up on this right hand it
[1:17:58] was called who gave Cyrus power to do
[1:18:01] what he did you see it's something to
[1:18:06] recognize that and to see God moving
[1:18:09] things into position in this hour
[1:18:13] oh my in the third day he will raise us
[1:18:18] up and we shall live in his sight has he
[1:18:21] not raised us up in the third day come
[1:18:25] on somebody there had to be the
[1:18:27] unfolding of the just shall live by
[1:18:29] faith it had to be the unfolding of the
[1:18:31] sanctification and cleansing work
[1:18:33] through the blood for a vessel to be
[1:18:35] clean that he himself could move into
[1:18:37] and there the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:39] making way for the person of Jesus
[1:18:42] Christ the Son of man to step down
[1:18:44] himself in a black body our body that he
[1:18:48] himself a tabernacle that he has built
[1:18:54] he has built against opposition there
[1:18:57] has been answerís and Nehemiah's down
[1:18:59] through the ages but what was it he
[1:19:02] strengthened them lucky strengthens
[1:19:05] Judah he strengthens you and I
[1:19:09] then shall we know if we follow on to
[1:19:13] know the Lord his going forth is
[1:19:15] prepared as the morning prepared it's
[1:19:19] already prepared that's the morning it's
[1:19:22] just everything getting in position and
[1:19:24] he shall come unto us as the rain as the
[1:19:27] Lateran former rain unto the earth here
[1:19:34] was Jacob
[1:19:35] out of the land he was over there his
[1:19:41] father-in-law Laban and Jacob was over
[1:19:44] there making money right brother Bram
[1:19:49] goes into it and he brother Ram will
[1:19:50] actually apply even that spirit of man
[1:19:52] and wisdom and he'll deal with that even
[1:19:54] with the Jews he said they know how to
[1:19:56] get every dollar don't see he said don't
[1:19:57] you try to make a deal with him they're
[1:19:59] all Fox you need a matter of fact
[1:20:02] brother BAM said see when Peter came by
[1:20:04] the gate called beautiful he said you
[1:20:06] know something happened to that Jew if
[1:20:07] he said silver and gold have I none he
[1:20:09] said the way they love money he said you
[1:20:11] know something happened to him are you
[1:20:13] with me so you begin to see that Jacob
[1:20:15] look at this in the parallel Jacob
[1:20:18] member he begin to get homesick and when
[1:20:23] he got homesick remember even he notices
[1:20:26] he notices the katniss of laman and the
[1:20:31] Brethren are turning against him now you
[1:20:34] find that this turning which was very
[1:20:37] obvious in the time of the Holocaust
[1:20:39] right you see that now where how the
[1:20:41] brother bran brings that out there of
[1:20:43] the tender hand of jehovah we see those
[1:20:45] things you know coming out I'll bring
[1:20:47] you home on the wings of an eagle we see
[1:20:49] that but a but you know when we look at
[1:20:51] that there had to be that necessary part
[1:20:53] even of that of the Zionist entering
[1:20:56] back into the land and those that would
[1:20:58] be moved by God what a paradox in that
[1:21:01] that language itself would be raised
[1:21:03] back up now you might look at it and say
[1:21:05] well it really wasn't necessary for the
[1:21:07] Hebrew language to be raised back up but
[1:21:09] if you notice what the Prophet tells us
[1:21:11] there in the fifth seal he said Jesus
[1:21:13] will speak there to the 144,000 in the
[1:21:17] Hebrew tongue it was necessary that that
[1:21:21] language be raised up I ask you wasn't
[1:21:24] it necessary for the language that have
[1:21:27] been here within the scriptures that had
[1:21:29] been lost and denominations had cut it
[1:21:32] out and substituted everything wasn't
[1:21:34] there an e for the pure language of the
[1:21:37] Holy Ghost to
[1:21:39] turn to the Church of the Living God
[1:21:41] once again once is their need for when
[1:21:44] seminaries and men have yanked it out of
[1:21:47] the scriptures but he said I will turn
[1:21:50] them again to a pure language God
[1:21:54] restoring the language of the bride in
[1:21:56] the South hello
[1:22:00] we know what we're talking about back
[1:22:03] his grace he has opened to us this
[1:22:06] language it's a real love language and
[1:22:16] it's not just a language of just words
[1:22:19] these words are expressive action words
[1:22:24] words that are filled with atonement
[1:22:29] words that bring relationship grow
[1:22:34] Robina God many returned under the
[1:22:37] Holocaust many returned there were those
[1:22:41] that were brought back but then you see
[1:22:43] that within it there are those even as
[1:22:46] we looked at it last week who are making
[1:22:49] their ally off their immigration they're
[1:22:52] coming back home and to look that even
[1:22:54] within this one I began to look at other
[1:22:56] things as I mentioned here last week
[1:22:58] they're giving given a free ticket for a
[1:23:00] one-way flight back home they're
[1:23:02] provided with temporary housing they are
[1:23:04] provided with with cash payments to
[1:23:07] actually sustain them and when they live
[1:23:09] in that temporary housing actually was
[1:23:11] looking at a few things for six months
[1:23:13] those who come back into the country
[1:23:15] there they are now under the instruction
[1:23:18] of the Hebrew language to learn that
[1:23:20] language say they never knew it before
[1:23:24] you and I'd know terms right now we
[1:23:25] never knew before but we've been under
[1:23:29] the tutorship of the Holy Ghost there's
[1:23:32] things we never knew before but now
[1:23:34] under the tutorship of the Holy Spirit
[1:23:36] what's it doing it's restoring us back
[1:23:38] to her you say this just seems like my
[1:23:40] native tongue it is your native tongue
[1:23:42] it
[1:23:43] my native tongue glory be to God oh ma I
[1:23:50] think of that you know even as I
[1:23:52] mentioned here last year Bibi Netanyahu
[1:23:53] saying we call on the mass absorption of
[1:23:56] Jewish immigration from Europe you
[1:24:00] realize all they have to do is have a
[1:24:02] grandparent that's a Jew when they step
[1:24:04] off the plane there is singing in the
[1:24:07] airports welcoming them back home and
[1:24:10] they go into a room like this and right
[1:24:13] there before leaving the airport they
[1:24:15] become citizens Wow a flight citizenship
[1:24:22] a token benefits you mean just like that
[1:24:28] we have access to all things freely
[1:24:35] given us all things so there's no doubt
[1:24:39] about it there is a multitude of Jews
[1:24:42] that have been and that are immigrating
[1:24:45] as I said last week when I begin to look
[1:24:47] at that word immigrate and immigrate is
[1:24:49] really in some ways it's similar but
[1:24:51] it's really different immigrate means
[1:24:53] you're focusing on the country in which
[1:24:55] you are going to and calling that
[1:24:57] country whole immigration means you
[1:25:00] focus more on the country that you're
[1:25:02] leaving what you think about that
[1:25:05] scripturally the Bible says that we are
[1:25:07] Pilgrims and strangers it says
[1:25:09] concerning Abraham and Sarah if they had
[1:25:11] been mindful of the country they came
[1:25:14] out of they might have had opportunity
[1:25:17] to return what you see when God brings
[1:25:21] us on Holly ah it is not looking back at
[1:25:23] what we got to give up and I gotta stop
[1:25:25] this and I know it's about him you see
[1:25:31] when you look back to what you got to do
[1:25:32] is still operating under that first
[1:25:34] selfish berth I got to do this and I
[1:25:36] don't know if I can do that and iiiiii
[1:25:39] it's to emigrate
[1:25:43] come home well I don't know get that eye
[1:25:46] out come home ah no come on homie
[1:25:52] emigrate
[1:25:54] now the think of this here there's no
[1:25:57] doubt that there's many men are coming
[1:26:00] there and you see them as they're coming
[1:26:02] in you can watch the different things
[1:26:04] and some of the the video things you
[1:26:05] know I look at with the news and
[1:26:07] different things and you see them coming
[1:26:09] in there being greeting was singing this
[1:26:12] ain't no dead thing there greet them
[1:26:15] there are people who has been organizing
[1:26:18] the events for them to come home this
[1:26:22] has been it's been going on for a long
[1:26:23] time now there's no doubt about it that
[1:26:25] buries those who are coming back that
[1:26:28] will not be part of Israel 144,000 but
[1:26:34] within it there is 144,000 see there's a
[1:26:39] mixed multitude coming up come on
[1:26:42] somebody you see this is where brother
[1:26:44] branham here he'll tell us even in the
[1:26:46] message recognizing your day in its
[1:26:48] message if you go to paragraph 83 there
[1:26:51] brother Brian he says why do they do
[1:26:52] that he's talking about them riding a
[1:26:54] paper fast pray fast pray fast pray that
[1:26:56] God will send the Prophet fast pray fast
[1:26:58] pray he goes on now at the opening a
[1:27:00] paragraph 83 and says why do they do
[1:27:04] that why do they do that they want a
[1:27:09] Great Awakening they're crying believing
[1:27:13] there will be an awakening some of the
[1:27:15] Gentiles they're good people why is it
[1:27:19] what have they done they have not
[1:27:22] recognized the awakening of the bride by
[1:27:26] being a Christian they feel the pull of
[1:27:30] the album that's why they can write
[1:27:33] songs that they write and it has more
[1:27:37] meaning to us let the sound son tonight
[1:27:41] waymaker it has more meaning to us
[1:27:47] well brother Simon I don't know about
[1:27:49] that I can't hack it I could take the
[1:27:51] rest of the night and on through the
[1:27:52] next day and everything else to show you
[1:27:54] songs where inspiration was poured out
[1:27:57] and it was poured out years before and
[1:28:00] then even that which was poured out
[1:28:02] during the time of that word that how
[1:28:04] that they would look back and take that
[1:28:06] song and they would apply to this time
[1:28:08] or then there would be inspiration that
[1:28:10] would break within that moment and that
[1:28:12] song would have prophecy but yet it
[1:28:14] would also have a divine application for
[1:28:16] that time you with me you see by being
[1:28:22] Christians they feel the pull of the
[1:28:25] hour but they haven't recognized what's
[1:28:29] been done that's what's making them feel
[1:28:33] that way they know something is supposed
[1:28:37] to happen notes like Israel they knew
[1:28:39] something was going to happen they're
[1:28:41] looking for it way off in the future to
[1:28:46] come when it's already happened right by
[1:28:51] you so there are those listen now when
[1:28:57] you think of these of the 144,000 moving
[1:29:00] in here into Israel and you look at how
[1:29:03] that many 30,000 in just a year's time
[1:29:05] they're actually looking at how things
[1:29:07] will be doubled now there is politicians
[1:29:09] that's looking at it in terms of let us
[1:29:11] get as many Israelites as we can so that
[1:29:14] you know we'll always have the
[1:29:15] solidarity to be a state and you know
[1:29:18] it'll be a a pushing out a crowding out
[1:29:21] and even think of his brother a sent me
[1:29:22] this video here the other day and I
[1:29:24] begin to watch it of how that a rabbi
[1:29:26] pointed out that we're here is Trump and
[1:29:28] he's talking to the Jews now you know
[1:29:30] that that Trump's had a lot of good you
[1:29:32] know among the Jews even from before he
[1:29:34] was elected he made promises and those
[1:29:36] promises were kept and remember now he
[1:29:38] stood right before those Jewish men and
[1:29:42] different ones before and just said once
[1:29:44] again and he talks to them in terms of
[1:29:47] for your country thought it was
[1:29:50] interesting the rabbi pointed out he
[1:29:52] said now think about it those of you who
[1:29:54] are Irish those of you who are when
[1:29:56] maybe let's say you know whatever your
[1:29:58] national
[1:29:59] wherever you're from he said would it
[1:30:01] not be an insult for somebody then
[1:30:03] instead of saying you Americans but
[1:30:05] rather they say those of you from
[1:30:07] Ireland after you've been here so long
[1:30:10] don't get what I'm saying but instead
[1:30:13] notice even how this is said for your
[1:30:16] country to recognize that this right
[1:30:19] here that for the Jews Israel is their
[1:30:22] country but I find it remarkable how
[1:30:24] that Rabbi went on to say that there are
[1:30:26] Jews rabbis included that they don't
[1:30:29] think of Israel as being home but there
[1:30:32] are some who say it's home you
[1:30:36] understand there's got to be certain
[1:30:39] things said and the persons they don't
[1:30:41] know about this let me just say like
[1:30:43] this don't try to make things that don't
[1:30:47] fit we don't need conspiracy theories to
[1:30:51] make the Word of God more credible we
[1:30:54] don't need a mixing around listen
[1:30:56] brother round didn't mix around he was
[1:30:58] led by the Spirit of God when he dealt
[1:31:00] with Eisenhower and Khrushchev it was
[1:31:02] led by the Spirit of God he wasn't
[1:31:04] trying to put things together you with
[1:31:08] me but to see that there's certain
[1:31:11] things let me tell you something there
[1:31:12] has to be certain things all glory there
[1:31:15] had to be certain things said about you
[1:31:17] and I think about it the Prophet here he
[1:31:19] is ministering in the seals
[1:31:21] he said I've just wait a minute he said
[1:31:23] I'm not going to call you Church no more
[1:31:25] I'm gonna call you brat that you might
[1:31:28] understand you see this is where your
[1:31:31] country there are things that have to be
[1:31:34] said in a certain way it has an effect
[1:31:39] upon things and we know that that's how
[1:31:44] it is on our life spiritually
[1:31:47] let me try to finish this here tonight
[1:31:49] Isaiah 54 1 I may just skip a little bit
[1:31:52] on these verses I was a a 54 one sing o
[1:31:55] barren pal that did it's not bear break
[1:31:57] forth into singing and cry loud thou but
[1:32:00] did it's not travail with child for more
[1:32:02] are the children of the desolate than
[1:32:04] the children of the married wife saith
[1:32:06] the Lord he goes on to say in verse 4
[1:32:08] fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed
[1:32:11] either be now confounded for thou shalt
[1:32:14] not be put to shame for thou shalt
[1:32:16] forget the shame about youth and shalt
[1:32:19] not remember the reproach about
[1:32:21] widowhood anymore for that maker is
[1:32:23] thine husband the Lord of Hosts is his
[1:32:26] name and that Redeemer the Holy One of
[1:32:28] Israel the god of the whole earth shot
[1:32:32] this is a millennium shall he be called
[1:32:36] for the Lord verse 6 for the Lord hath
[1:32:39] called thee as a woman Forsaken and
[1:32:42] grieved in spirit and a wife of youth
[1:32:44] when thou wast refused saith the Lord
[1:32:47] for a small moment have I forsaken me
[1:32:50] but with great mercies will I gather
[1:32:53] thee in a little wrath I hid my face
[1:32:57] from thee for a moment but with
[1:33:00] everlasting kindness I will have mercy
[1:33:02] on me saith the LORD thy Redeemer
[1:33:09] Hosea - I just got a skip move just a
[1:33:12] little bit
[1:33:13] Hosea 2 verse 14 therefore behold I will
[1:33:19] allure her and bring her into the
[1:33:24] wilderness and speak comfortably unto
[1:33:29] her
[1:33:34] he's drawing Israel he's going to bring
[1:33:38] that hundred forty-four thousand into
[1:33:41] the wilderness what does wilderness mean
[1:33:44] it's to shut out everything around shut
[1:33:49] out everything around that he might want
[1:33:50] speak comfortably with her before God
[1:33:55] will allow the Nations to fully compass
[1:33:58] Jerusalem he seals them away first he
[1:34:05] strengthens them can't you see that in
[1:34:06] our lives before God would permit there
[1:34:09] of that testing and trial that would
[1:34:11] absolutely if we were just resting in
[1:34:14] our own intellects it would shake us
[1:34:17] away but he puts strength in us he
[1:34:23] strengthens us you know what I'm talking
[1:34:26] about the Bible says you endured a great
[1:34:31] flight of evictions let me just bring
[1:34:33] this here around and I will give her her
[1:34:39] vineyards from thence and the valley of
[1:34:43] Achor for a door of hope you know what a
[1:34:47] core was about a core is where Aiken was
[1:34:50] stoned that which troubled Israel and
[1:34:55] prevented them from subduing the city of
[1:34:59] AI God said I'll remove the ungodliness
[1:35:05] glory
[1:35:07] and she shall sing there as in the days
[1:35:13] of her youth notice she sounds she shall
[1:35:18] sing there as in the days of her youth
[1:35:23] and as in the day when she came up out
[1:35:27] of the land of Egypt let me just stop
[1:35:32] here if she's going to sing as it was in
[1:35:38] the days when she came up out of Egypt
[1:35:39] as in the days of her youth there's got
[1:35:43] to be a song and it's not a man-made
[1:35:46] song remember that song it was not
[1:35:52] Miriam who sang it first it was Moses
[1:35:57] the Prophet on the scene at that time he
[1:36:01] said I will sing unto the Lord the Lord
[1:36:05] he hath triumphed over the horse and his
[1:36:11] rider the Lord is my soul not words in
[1:36:16] it he is myself so she's gonna say see
[1:36:21] not he she then there's got to be some
[1:36:25] directors on the scene who's under the
[1:36:29] unction of the composer that can bring
[1:36:32] the harmony among the 144,000 are you
[1:36:36] with me so who is it that that brings
[1:36:39] this about that comes to a place to
[1:36:41] where that Israel will actually come in
[1:36:43] to that melodious singing
[1:36:49] it's under that and the two witnesses by
[1:36:54] the power of the word they open that
[1:36:57] sixth seal and the Israel the 144,000
[1:37:01] they're coming under that word that's
[1:37:03] being ministered that same baptism of
[1:37:05] the Holy Ghost that's been preached to
[1:37:07] the Gentiles Israel coming under that
[1:37:09] you see what's going on right now it's
[1:37:10] like when you show up to a symphony or
[1:37:12] you show up if you've ever been to one
[1:37:14] and you know when you show up there
[1:37:15] there's a lot of things that you hear
[1:37:17] when you walk in the building you know I
[1:37:20] just went to another one and even though
[1:37:21] it was an elementary thing and I'm not
[1:37:23] talking about how they played but
[1:37:24] actually you hear him when they're there
[1:37:25] you know Silas and Briana then Silas was
[1:37:28] the one playing that night you walk in
[1:37:30] there and I remember it even when you
[1:37:31] know that I was in school you would walk
[1:37:33] in you walk into the to the room the
[1:37:35] orchestra room your ear you hear all
[1:37:37] sorts of them people tuning up their
[1:37:39] instruments they're they're getting them
[1:37:40] in tune and this one's over here playing
[1:37:42] and this one's over there playing this
[1:37:44] one's on the piano here and you know
[1:37:46] going through all these things what are
[1:37:47] they done they're getting ready for
[1:37:49] their performance God is assembling
[1:37:53] everything together he's getting ready
[1:37:57] to learn this song
[1:37:59] that only they can learn and let me tell
[1:38:02] you something you've learned a song that
[1:38:05] only you can learn only that which has
[1:38:10] been redeemed remember the angels can't
[1:38:12] sing the song the angels can say wow
[1:38:16] that's beautiful they can't sing it you
[1:38:19] know why because it's a song of
[1:38:22] experience your love
[1:38:32] or Jesus
[1:38:37] what care
[1:38:39] what provision Lord we can look and see
[1:38:43] this upon the israel's life or upon them
[1:38:47] Lord as you gather them
[1:38:49] you've never forgot about it the
[1:38:52] scripture we read their Lord and
[1:38:53] Zechariah you'd bring them through the
[1:38:56] scene make away through the river and
[1:38:58] you'd place them or Jesus how that
[1:39:05] father you've brought us through the sea
[1:39:08] of affliction
[1:39:11] you brought us sword everyone must cross
[1:39:13] through that River Jordan must be born
[1:39:17] of the Spirit of God
[1:39:21] or do you've not called us to a church
[1:39:24] we've not been called to a movement the
[1:39:28] Church of the Living God in this ours
[1:39:29] not even called to a station
[1:39:32] we're beckoned this is homegoing time
[1:39:37] this is time to be ready for our flight
[1:39:42] our soul
[1:39:45] has been translated from the kingdom of
[1:39:47] darkness into the kingdom of your dear
[1:39:51] son no longer I will be under the reign
[1:39:54] and domain of darkness but as Paul said
[1:40:00] you sometimes were darkness but now are
[1:40:01] you light and the Lord Lord we come and
[1:40:06] we look at this within Israel who is it
[1:40:10] that would call the people even great
[1:40:13] exodus from Europe what would cause them
[1:40:17] to uproot their families or do we know
[1:40:23] that it's a pool that's going on there
[1:40:27] is an election Israel to be saved or
[1:40:35] they've got to be in the homeland
[1:40:39] here was Simeon he was in Jerusalem he
[1:40:45] was waiting for the consolation he had
[1:40:50] been moved upon what would cause these
[1:40:53] what would cause them to do this to move
[1:40:56] to forsake everything or Daud we hear
[1:41:02] about it we know that there is an
[1:41:06] encroachment of those which absolutely
[1:41:12] hate the Jews as it was mentioned Lord
[1:41:17] and really the interviews many of them
[1:41:20] Lord have been bullied in everything
[1:41:21] else by the Muslims moving in there they
[1:41:24] have to in right there in France have to
[1:41:26] have guards guarding the schools there's
[1:41:32] some Lord as they stand there they say
[1:41:34] we don't want to leave but we have to
[1:41:37] leave it's the only way for our family
[1:41:40] Lorna yeah who knows maybe some of them
[1:41:44] Lord that I watched on that little
[1:41:45] documentary there maybe some of them are
[1:41:49] of those of that elect we don't know
[1:41:52] because Lord the real reality of it is
[1:41:55] we look at our own life when you begin
[1:41:58] to deal with our life even with things
[1:42:00] that you moved on our hearts when we
[1:42:02] were young but God as your prophet
[1:42:07] spoken like this he said many can
[1:42:10] fellowship with me on this point we knew
[1:42:14] there was a god somewhere
[1:42:17] with nil there was a reality something
[1:42:20] was pulling us we might have tried this
[1:42:23] and tried that but nothing could satisfy
[1:42:27] we didn't realize what that was that was
[1:42:30] the grace of God that would not allow us
[1:42:33] to get settled down in a place that was
[1:42:36] not our home or Jesus you know how to
[1:42:42] take every bit of comfort you pull the
[1:42:46] comfort out of the nest maybe there's
[1:42:49] some here tonight some that are
[1:42:51] streaming in Lord you're gone if they're
[1:42:53] still in the nest I pray God may the
[1:42:56] great eagle of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:58] stir that nest tonight Lord take out the
[1:43:01] feathers Lord take out the Comfort Lord
[1:43:04] Lord don't let him know there's wings
[1:43:11] there to fly may they Lord God in
[1:43:16] obedience to your word be removed out of
[1:43:19] that nest
[1:43:22] granny lord I pray play a film Lord with
[1:43:28] the Holy Ghost may there be such a
[1:43:30] hunger Lord such a desire Lord God for
[1:43:34] you Lord that goes beyond Lord God
[1:43:39] everything else but overrides Lord when
[1:43:44] they lay down to go to sleep at night
[1:43:46] Lord let it be that Lord like Jacob Lord
[1:43:50] where he can look and see the town
[1:43:52] that's changing toward him
[1:43:54] what God made me be able to look clearly
[1:43:56] and recognize Lord granting or God if
[1:43:59] it's friends turning on him Lord let
[1:44:01] friends turn on him lord if it's family
[1:44:05] let family turn on him Lord whatever it
[1:44:08] would be Lord o'clock to get their
[1:44:10] attention Lord God like that prodigal
[1:44:14] son if he does still had money to live
[1:44:17] it up it would have never struck his
[1:44:19] heart but his parents were praying for
[1:44:22] him and when his parents got to pray no
[1:44:28] doubt they pray to many many nights but
[1:44:31] they got through a place he had spent
[1:44:34] all his living and he began to remember
[1:44:38] ho ho ho
[1:44:46] Hall never changed
[1:44:49] it was him that changed but he needed to
[1:44:54] come back home Lord maybe there's one
[1:44:57] here tonight they need to come back home
[1:45:00] but here father the Spirit of God
[1:45:04] speaking to the high hearts come let us
[1:45:06] return unto the Lord or granite Lord God
[1:45:10] I pray Heavenly Father may they hear
[1:45:15] that of the hiss the signal the whistle
[1:45:17] the pipe of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:21] may they Lord God most importantly be
[1:45:24] obedient to that son in secret but you
[1:45:28] would gather them Lord or Jesus for a
[1:45:35] new is strength in u.s. authority you
[1:45:40] are our defense
[1:45:44] you're our defense or tonight the Bible
[1:45:52] is true and we are witnesses that many
[1:45:56] are the afflictions of the righteous but
[1:45:59] the Lord delivereth them out of them or
[1:46:07] Jesus maybe there's one tonight there in
[1:46:12] some low notes in their life they're not
[1:46:16] singing in a tenor Alto soprano
[1:46:19] mid-range but maybe they're in the bass
[1:46:22] right now
[1:46:26] but I pray Heavenly Father would you
[1:46:30] just move by your spirit and encourage
[1:46:34] them and let them know the song is not
[1:46:37] all low notes it's just a verse we're a
[1:46:43] part of the verse
[1:46:45] but the song is comprised of many notes
[1:46:51] that when blended together brings forth
[1:46:56] us what your the song of our lives
[1:47:02] you're the reason that we see you're not
[1:47:06] just a word in our song you are our lord
[1:47:11] we were like this of Israel Oh Lord we
[1:47:16] had so many layin lines there's so much
[1:47:22] ad-libbing that had been done and left
[1:47:25] the original sheet music but there had
[1:47:29] to be inspiration that would be poured
[1:47:32] out in this our spirit of grace will be
[1:47:35] poured out Lord God
[1:47:38] they would take these promises of the
[1:47:40] word that were being auctioned off left
[1:47:43] and right and that brick bowl of the
[1:47:47] Holy Spirit would take that of the
[1:47:49] promises of God's Holy Word and would
[1:47:52] begin to strike it and would bring forth
[1:47:56] the promises Jesus Christ the same
[1:48:00] yesterday today and forever to show it
[1:48:04] is of the same value the same power Lord
[1:48:09] I asked tonight if there's one who does
[1:48:12] not know you in that resurrection pound
[1:48:16] they don't know you Lord God in that
[1:48:19] Lord God of that cleansing power of the
[1:48:21] new birth what God may this be their
[1:48:26] night
[1:48:29] may they Lord be gathered some that are
[1:48:33] setting may be here tonight or streaming
[1:48:35] Lord to where that in their hearts their
[1:48:37] being gathered maybe they're like those
[1:48:38] some that are leaving from Europe or God
[1:48:41] they have to start making a decision I
[1:48:44] think of the ambassadors Lord that I
[1:48:47] watched on the film men that are working
[1:48:50] right there upon the settlements in
[1:48:54] Samaria those who are working with this
[1:48:57] Ally off they go into these places in
[1:49:01] Europe and there are Jews that come
[1:49:05] together in a place they got questions
[1:49:11] but it shows their heart is being
[1:49:14] stirred and there's a man who lives in
[1:49:18] the land that can tell them about it or
[1:49:22] Jesus there's a man here tonight who can
[1:49:26] turn on the light
[1:49:28] I pray God that you would grant Ward our
[1:49:32] tonight in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:49:37] granite Lord granny Lord Jesus come here
