mute unless lord god you would say something through it lord god may you just come and speak to our hearts i pray we ask these things lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you tonight it's certainly good to be in the house of the lord good to be gathered with you once again we want to look into first corinthians chapter two uh brother brian if you'll turn these the floor monitors down just a tad just yet just a little bit okay i'm going to read these these scriptures here some things that we were looking at on sunday and some of these things with just was already looking at before that time but i want to read this really of a background for some things that we want to just look at here in the scriptures and just to try to get the the context of of the of the setting and that'll make a little bit more sense to you in just a little just a few moments but in first corinthians chapter 2 verse 9 paul says but as it is written i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god how many knows everything that god has given us you're going to have to fight to take it but it's worth it amen he equips us he strengthens us he encourages us so the spirit that we've received is not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us it's very clear as if without the holy spirit the the things of god would just go right by our head but god's desire is that we might know what it is that belongs to us amen is sons and daughters of god so verse 13 which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things that we're judgeth means to discern yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated amen i see some visitors here tonight god bless you i think i already heard that you were welcome is just glad to have you here with us amen may god richly bless you and trust that the word will be a blessing not unto you but to each of our hearts um i look at this at the the thought here in in where paul is writing and we begin to look at that a little bit on uh sunday and we're dealing with that of the spiritual mind and dealing with things of what it would mean and the difference between the carnal and the spiritual and we find as we've been looking there in romans 8 that the carnal mind is enmity against god it could never be subject to god even with all that a carnal mind could hear of the letter of the word and say well i'll do this and i'll do this but if it never comes to a place that the desire on the inside flees or there is a sanctifying power and then god takes the innermost seat in that heart then it's still at enmity and still at odds with god because it takes thereby a real birth of the holy spirit this is why jesus said you must be born again it's not an option you must be born again and to recognize that where the the birth itself the holy spirit does not come to bring a new birth to our flesh nor does he come to bring a new birth to our spirit we're a three-part being but he comes to bring that new birth to that soul to change that nature and that's where god takes up residency within our life and then the other parts of our life the spirit and the flesh they declare the inner work that god himself has done because it's really you really who you are on the inside and who you are on the inside will come out on the outside you cannot say this is who i really am and then the outside says something different who you are comes out from within it's just like a seed what is on whatever the germ is on the inside of that seed if it is an apple within this the rain and the sun only releases that germ that's already inside of that seed the sun doesn't make it an apple the rain doesn't make it an apple it only releases what was already in there and that's the same way it is when we come into the presence of the living god which god is light and it's god releasing what is there that he sowed within us he's the only one that can release that that real mystery and that reality in our life so paul is dealing with this here of the of even in a life and i want to just just to look at it in this manner as well of how that even a spiritual one that paul will use this term and i'm going to deal with this tonight a little bit but use the term spiritual and you see that even a person that uh you know can be covered over with all kinds of darkness but yet when they begin to hear coming into a service coming into a meeting and there's something that they begin to hear begin to recognize and say there's something here that i'm hearing and they recognize this is something beyond man this is this is something beyond just words it's more than just stories that's being told but we recognize that the word is uncovering our life and we recognize that that that can be it cannot be a man but it must be the word himself which is jesus christ so it is the holy ghost coming and now as he moves upon that there is that spiritual man begins to be stirred in the direction that is drawing that person to life because it takes the person of life to come and reveal the path of life so he wants that that our walk with him that our footsteps are ordered of the lord and then to see how paul comes into the place to say that the spirit of god that is given to us it comes to quicken our life through and by the new birth that we might see and we might understand and we might know what god has freely given to us you see we it comes down the whole chapter of the part that we read there as paul begins in the chapter speaking of himself a great a scholar knowing many languages and knowing the word but yet he said i am standing among you in fear and weakness and trembling lest your faith would be in the enticing words of man's wisdom but he said i want your faith to rest in the power of god and we recognize that it's according to the word so it's putting the full emphasis on the spirit of god the lord jesus christ the word that is in our midst and this is where paul is saying this is where our reliance i rest this is what we trust in we're looking to the spirit of god that he would reveal to us what we have need of because without him we will miss it we need him to reveal to us what we have need of and if not if we miss it it goes over our head the bible says that there are those of the natural man the natural man cannot receive the things of god it takes that which is given by god to receive and respond to his voice this is why jesus said that my sheep know my voice they did not become sheep when they heard his voice they were already sheep they may not have been acting like sheep but they the sheep hear the voice of the shepherd hallelujah once at a certain authority that was over our life but now here comes the voice of the shepherd calling to our life and what does it do it brings out and makes known that there's a sheep of god on the inside what is a sheep of god a sheep is different from a goat a goat cannot be led but a sheep can be led and this is why got the elect of god that on the inside is ordained and is called a sheep of god because he can leave his sheep and he promised he would lead us into green pastures he leads us beside the still waters we are led by the holy ghost it is not us when the holy ghost has come it is not us instructing god it is not us telling god but it is now god come on the inside and he's leading us amen right you realize if he just comes to the flesh and a person can do many religious things out here but they're not being led it's not pleasing it can even come to the spirit to where on the spirit they can have a love for god upon the spirit but yet that is not a place of pleasing unto the lord it has to come to a place to where now the mind of christ coming in by the new birth then it our lives are led by that realm that is unseen to the natural eye it is a privilege that we come into that channel of the mind of christ it's the same mind that adam operated by in the garden of eden it's the same mind that was there when there was not adam stardust or molecule and god in the beginning he he spoke and here things begin to move things begin to come about the angels were created all of those all of those parts even down from where this great clinker of ice and here it drops down and we it doesn't look like the earth at all but it yields to the voice of god and it comes around the sun and it becomes a water garden of eden because it obeyed the voice of god you see why it comes into that mind and when we come into the mind of christ it's not us directing god but it is god having supreme control and authority in our lives and it's not it's not a struggle but it is actually a blessing and a rest to recognize the realm and the privilege that we can walk in it doesn't mean that we all the time feel spiritual or you fear it but you recognize remember what brother branham talks about the anointing is oh my he said the anointing is not running here and running there but the anointing is supreme power in control you know who you are a situation arises junior gets cut and here you know it's such a situation that you could frantic about it but something steps up at that time and you might say what am i going to do but there's something that steps up and says wait a minute we got a promise they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he's a god that heals that which is broken he mends that which is torn what is it it's operating in that mind of christ and we can truly say that any time uh because we have uh the mind of christ and then you have that natural mind and any time we're defeated is because we went to the natural amen but when we operate in that channel that we are privileged to come into praise and you recognize that this channel is a channel the mind of christ is a channel that we are to yield ourselves to it's a yielding to him and he does the leading he does the guiding he takes control in situations and and directs us through uh each one of these each situation and it's it's something that when i when we look at this it's a privilege it's a relationship that we can that we have with god uh remember when jesus here he was he's speaking to the disciples and they were called as servants but then he says i'm no longer going to call you servants i'm going to call you friends because servants do not know what the master is doing they're just simply pick this pick this up pick that up i remember when you know when when i was just um 15 or 14 or 15 to 16. worked in a greenhouse there you know and uh you know and and some of the times what we were doing in the summer uh some of the work it was hard work you know but i didn't know why am i you i didn't see why am i doing this what does why why am i doing this why am i doing that and i didn't ask you know the owner i didn't ask him you know why am i doing this i didn't see why am i doing this why am i doing that it was only go do this go clean out the warehouse go do this and go do that in other words what i'm saying is i didn't see any vision i didn't see nothing come together like a plan it was just like you know oh go do this and go do that okay i'll go do this and go do that but that's not what it is with a believer when he moves from servant to friends remember friends he says a servant doesn't know what his master's doing but but a my friend he is one to whom he will disclose what he is doing and to recognize that even from friends it moves from friends then to after the resurrection he did not say go tell my friends he said go tell my brethren you see the relationship progressed just like with you and your wife or your husband you know you just don't meet him and then run to the altar and get married if you did something's wrong you you you there is a change in relationship you become friends and you know it moves on to a place to where now as husband and wife but what is it it's a growing it's a changing in relationship and that's the goal of the gospel is to bring us into full relationship with god as sons and daughters of god so that we're not just walking around ignorantly and saying oh so-and-so is doing this okay so i'll do that so-and-so is doing this okay so i'll do this that is not that's not god's desire god's desire is that everyone has a personal revelation and they've got a personal connection as a son and daughter of god and are under the leadership of the mind of jesus christ hallelujah now i want you to think of this i haven't given him my title now i'm going to give him a title what i'm going to preach on i i want to speak on here tonight or at least begin to these are some things i just just was looking at here you know even before last weekend and i want to preach on and or at least kind of deal with spiritual admonition or if i could say it in another way to save them length back there admonition to the spiritual minded and i want you to watch how paul because you'll find even in the scriptures as we go through and we're looking at the spiritual and the carnal and paul is setting that the difference and i want you to think of this it has always been clear back from from the very beginning there with abel and cain you had carnal and spiritual and there was war that took place the war that occurred or the conflict within the church the conflict the war was between the carnal and the spiritual the spiritual abel received he had he had revelation from god on what god desired in that hour and all he did he submitted himself he made himself available and god revealed to him this is my acceptable way and he walked in it then you had cain who brought fruits and after cain saw god come and vindicate abel's sacrifice he rose up and he slew abel is that right why because abel cain himself he was of that wicked one he rose up he he was jealous he would not humble himself to god's provided way and here was a conflict between this carnal and the spiritual it was a conflict with jacob and esau it's the church you always have the spiritual and you have the kernel and i want you to think of this it's just like let me just narrow it down for a moment it's the same even in a certain way even in our own life as we said moments ago where we in ourselves have to be inclined to the spiritual and that takes a spiritual endowment of the holy ghost amen so i want to just speak just for a few moments on spiritual admonition because i know i won't get through all of this but this is just an admonition is just to kind of step back and an admonition is a warning an admonition is something that it draws a real clear attention to something that is pressing and i want you to think of this now where paul what we just come out of reading in first corinthians chapter 2 then paul opens the very next chapter and he says i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ now you know what it really depended on how they were going to take it right right you know when a person can't receive correction it's one sure sign they ain't got the holy ghost brother said when they're corrected and they can't receive it it shows they're not humbling themselves to receive that correction is that right because the spirit of god will lead and guide us into all truth and if he's a teacher then he's able to take the word that's coming in that we might be directing many things that we can go but to think how paul would write of this and and speak to them i can't he says i couldn't speak to you as under spiritual there are things that paul wanted to bring to them but remember paul was under the leadership of the holy spirit and what good would it do to preach things up here if they're not up here god is mindful of our needs now notice in verse 2 i have fed you with milk and not with meat milk is necessary milk is necessary for newborns right right i mean no matter how big your boy or girl was that came out you know uh it doesn't matter they don't come out eating a t-bone steak they come they come out you have to give them milk right there's nutrient those things are already broke down they don't have to chew them and break them down in their mouth they don't have to rely on all of the digestive juices and they don't have to rely on that it's already given to them in a very simplified form and milk is the very foundation principles of christianity it's very foundation principles now notice i fed you with milk and not with me for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are you able for you are carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men for while one saith i am a paul and another i am of apollos are you not carnal right paul is paul he goes on without reading the rest of that portion where the people look look what's coming out of the cardinal look what carnal reactions are coming out divisions among them that's not spiritual the man who's spiritual says i will not let division enter into this church i will not let division enter in my home i will not let division come between me and my family that's a spiritual man because a spiritual mind can catch that and recognize even though they may have been wrong but they recognize if i allow this to fester what it will cause spiritual spiritual is insight it's discernment right envyings envyings this is among what he just got done writing about people who have the mind of christ right and there's envyings divisions look at this strife that's what's standing out that's what's spiritual this is what it produces no what paul is saying the behavior and conduct is the reason that i have to come with milk and not with meat this is why god comes and i thank god that he does come and correct us i thank god that he does come and admonish us but remember we don't want to continue to receive the milk bottle of don't have division don't have heart don't have grudge don't have bitterness i don't want to see that milk bottle of bitterness i don't want to see the milk bottle of those other things we want to grow into a place to where we're not walking around and being men all of a sudden a situation comes and we're back on milk amen god's desire is to feed us meat meat takes you beyond those things it gives you strength to do what fly above them but milk in itself here as it comes along and things that are basic things that are basic teaching and notice god has to remind us there are times where the spirit of god will have to come down and remind us because remember you don't go into algebra without the abcs i think i was in a church one time i was preaching uh services and i kind of know you know how the brother kind of the brother was always you know kind of and i didn't pray i didn't come and minister because of that but i thought what am i going to preach i don't know i never know i never go into any place what i'm going to preach i don't know sometimes god lets me know beforehand sometimes i'm just waiting and sometimes there's things that god are just little inspirations here and there i don't know i don't know but here i i just something moved on my heart and i just spoke on a simple little thought the abcs of daniel and i took how god led to show the mysteries that come to preserve life but it all came through abc's it all come through prayer it all come through fasting it all come through faith standing on the word of god and knowing that no matter what the circumstance god is present and he will answer and he will stand for his children amen now you know i know uh the brother is a friend friend of mine but i know how i really kind of leaned on mysteries and everything else like that i i like all the mysteries and all that but i like the mysteries where i can put them in the lunchbox you wish me i like it where it gets put in the lunch box and it goes right with me and so you know i thought lord are you sure you want me to preach this here the abc's of daniel but you know we ministered it and god gave us grace within that but the the thing that we're looking at is is seeing of how that here among the people they they're not recognizing really who it is that's working they they now have become locked on personalities and i'm of apollos i'm appalled and then you had a group in there that actually says i'm of christ in other words i don't need no ministry i'm not making that up that was that was there in that time they they come into a place where i don't need this i don't need that i don't need this and and even as history courts those were the most dangerous out of all of them right now think about this paul is pointing it out wait a minute apollos planted i watered god gave the increase what paul has to bring him around to see it's god working in your midst there's sometimes you need planting i mean you can't go and rejoice uh you know over pumpkin path you don't first plant the seed and when you plant the seed you might have in your mind a thought who am i this is going to be a nice pumpkin pie cream cheese on the bottom and streusel on the top of it double streusel man this is going to be good and all you're doing is putting the seed in the dirt nothing right there really to rejoice over is that right but then after times of watering and my service after service thursday sunday monday in prayer tuesday prayer watering tending pulling around weeds and everything and then finally it comes to the time of oh my here comes that pumpkin pie well who was the one working all along it wasn't all of a sudden the guy that comes and plucks the pumpkin off the vine that oh my this guy no this guy just takes the pumpkin he recognizes this is the time it's the same one who recognized it's a time to plant and it's good in our midst there's times where we need to plant there's times where we need to break up fallow ground that the seed find its mark there's times where god has to do that why because then he'll come right back around water that and he'll bring increase in our lives oh my you see this is what paul is trying to get him to recognize who who is in your midst and you see much is spoken of with this part even with milk even where the lord jesus he you know you find after the death burial and resurrection now you find this witness in isaiah that reaches forward clear to pentecost and it's speaking of the coming of the holy spirit and remember here in isaiah the the question is who shall i make understand doctrine those that are weaned from the breast brother brandon uses that term he says they're not babies anymore and you know babies themselves there's a it's a wonderful thing you know of a baby but a baby's got to grow it's got to mature is that right there's got to be a maturity underneath that you you really you want to maturity not just in the physical realm but you also want the maturing of the character on the inside is that right i mean you you we all have seen people that you know it's still 30 40 50 60 years old and if mama could she'd pick them up and carry them around is that right they never they never graduated from certain things sometimes you see when you you could see certain things that it's going on and you recognize that's a sign that that's immaturity right you see maturity has nothing to do with chronologically how old you are maturity deals with the character amen this is why jesus as he's expressing this to isaiah who shall i make understand doctrine those who are weaned from the breasts those who have a desire did not just receive the milk of justification not just the milk of saying i know him as my as my savior but it's something that goes much deeper than that where you know if a person wants to hang on to milk and be babied around this is things that brother brown says being babied he said well you got to persuade him to come to church you got to tell him ah come on you got to come to church you should be doing this it doesn't matter how long they've been around the church if they still have to be persuaded in those things it's still babies preach brother simon it's still these are simple simple truths is that right these are simple truths that you don't even need a message for hallelujah the bible says for black and white forsake not to assemble yourselves together these are simple truths these are simple truths that even those in denomination know that they read that they see that i know people that value in that these are baby basic truths but if people are struggling with basic baby truths and listen i'm not talking about a person who is in journey i'm talking about a person who has just come to a spot and they count down and they say i don't need that i you know i don't understand it i don't need to understand that god ain't looking at it the same way your reasoning is there's got to be something and there should be something in your heart and if there's not something in your heart that says i deny every excuse i want to be full of the holy ghost i don't want to walk around with a milk bottle amen oh my my mama some of you thinking man i don't know if i should have come tonight or not no no no no we're we're in for a great blessing from the lord because you see to spiritual you know to others it'll never do anything in the world it'll just go right on by there's times i've watched things where people can be corrected and they're corrected and they go right back into the same rut corrected back into the same rut correct it back into the same rut there's got to come a time that you recognize that the pastor or anybody else nobody even god does not delight in correcting but it's to recognize what he's doing and saying god let my life be corrected let it come into a place to where my life reflects that [Music] you see to be to be spiritual is to be walking in unity and harmony with the holy spirit in the word lining up with the word and with one another by his spirit and so notice in hebrews 5 10 another place that paul let me just pick this up here and paul is is here in these first five chapters of hebrews he is laying out of who god is god's condescension he makes known it was god who was speaking in the prophets it was god in christ and he's tying the old he's tying what is the old and the new he is declaring that jehovah of behold is jesus of the new he's declaring that the law itself was fulfilled in christ and he is our righteousness and the first five chapters think of it think of the numerology the first five chapters it is grace to you and i that lets us know who he is and now in the closing of this chapter of chapter five he now is expressing called of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek he's speaking of the lord jesus yes remember melchizedek melchizedek himself came and he appeared unto abraham who was it priest of the most high god the bible says he ever liveth having neither father nor mother who was that that was god god unfolding himself that he would become our high priest oh my amen glory be to god but here now when god would become flesh that same god would would take upon a flesh body and who was that there within that body that was the same one who met abraham melchizedek the same one who came to abraham's tent door in genesis 18. it's the same one who met gideon it's the same one who came there time and time again met there the hebrew children in the fiery furnace he's the same one that daniel saw he's the same one that ezekiel saw he is the theme of the whole bible he led his children down through the scriptures in the word we were not just people just walking around you know like well these are good moral people christianity is more than good morals it'll produce that but it's more than that christianity don't limit the gospel to good morality there's a lot of good people who have a lot of good morals but they're not christians and they're going to have christians that have a lot of good morals but they're not holy ghost filled christians are you with me it's to be spirit filled to catch what he is doing in this hour is to know what is taking place in this season when daniel the bible says he was there in daniel 9 god had prophesied 70 years and then i will visit you in babylon and israel would come back into the homeland the bible says in daniel 9 that how daniel he begin to understand according to the books that now was the time daniel was a prophet but remember he could not pry into that it was the time and the time and the season the inspiration came for those who could be inspired to see what was already written he was reading what god had spoke through jeremiah see what god comes to do in this day is what he has already spoken through his prophets that's why when a person wants to know where are we at in this day there is a clear direction because the bible is a road map it's a blueprint and it's also an unfolding there is a beginning there is an end there is there is a beginning of redemption there is an ending of finalizing up and all of that is god's great drama that's unfolded and how would we know it except the holy ghost would come and reveal to us and say this is where you're at you haven't tried to go to a mall or somewhere and you say oh i wonder where i wonder where that dillards is at i wonder where that jc pennies is at i wonder where this is at we'll go ahead and walk around all you want man if you were in some of the malls i was in in manila i ain't never seen a mall like that beautiful big i've never seen malls like that here and you walk around and say i'm gonna find the store how about going to a map because when you go to a map there's a dot that says this is where you're at you can look at your surroundings you're able to look okay now looking at the map okay i see this store right here is on the right this is where i'm at that's towards so so that i have to go straight and up and make the first turn on the left you see what the map does when it is made known to you where you are then what can be unfolded to you is the destination and this is why it takes the holy ghost to reveal where you came from where you are and where you are going that is the work of the holy ghost it produces stability in the life in other words we're not just flowing around like a church and well you know brother so-and-so is doing this so i'll do that or sister so-and-so's doing this so i do that no no you're to be in tune with the same trumpet they are we are assembled by the trumpets the trumpets let us know who we are they tell us our genealogy [Music] you're out of the tribe of judah they let us know who you are called of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek verse 11 of whom we have many things to say hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing slow slow of hearing for when the time notice he's announcing to them this is the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god my you you think how paul let me just read on here and our become notice are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness in other words they lack experience for he is a babe but strong meat belonging to them that are of full age it is talking of perfection completion even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil right so everything if we can look at in this manner paul by the spirit of god notice i want you to catch this leading of the holy spirit paul is not just standing there and saying well here i am you know i'm among the hebrew church and my i'm just gonna let i'm gonna let the revelation fly there's there ha listen you can't approach the word casual let me just let me back up a moment a person cannot receive the holy ghost without a surrender amen you can't do it the holy ghost can come upon a person and then they experience they experience they have an experience of it but if they not really surrendered and they're not really truly repented and desired to die to the world then they can receive an experience upon them but they don't receive a feeling of the holy ghost are you with me because when the when the real feeling of the holy ghost comes it's a new it's a new birth it brings about a change within that life all things are passed away behold all things have become new it's not you trying to put on whoa but wool comes out of you it's not you trying to manufacture the fruits of the spirit it's the spirit of god inside of you leading you it's him that has control of you it's the mind of christ operating in your life you see paul is expressing here there's got to be things that qualify for the word to be revealed right now this is true this is to all of us but i i even speak very expressly melon to young people but even for those that have sat around maybe sat around in this church for years and everything it just it's a casual approach a casual approach to god well i come to believer spoken word tabernacle well you know i believe the message well i know that god sent a prophet and everything is just casual there's no there's no function in their life they stay in the same place that they've always been preach brother samuel they stay in the same the same place and never move and a matter of fact the real never moving it gets worse it gets worse because it starts creeping in like everything's okay everything's all right maybe they can quote a few things or say a few things and maybe they do a few good deeds but the reality is is that the truth be known they know they're not where they ought to be the gospel is not something real christianity is not what you have to pretend it's not a pretending or an impersonation it is a genuine birth on the inside where god's life comes in and god changes you amen that's why i say that for everyone even those that are listening and no doubt some that aren't that need to be listening they need to be born again of the holy ghost you say why i get tired of milk bottles it's like papa speaking tonight pastor's like a father sometimes the milk bottles that have to be given out of when we need to forgive so and so and we need to do this right here these are things that as brother adam takes us there in rising of the sun he said we need to be beyond these things where you put the caffeine or the coffee and the sugar and you let the little baby you've got to get some sugar he said we got to get beyond that we need to be he said we're living in a time we need to be burly men and women he said to where when something comes our way it don't hurt our feelings but it is only an opportunity for love to come forth amen say how many jesus you see this is where the spiritual will catch that a colonel will never reflect in their life spiritual catches the reflection of the word carnal carnal is deflection spiritual catches the reflection they reflect in their life when you leave out of a service you continue reflecting cardinal deflects it hope somebody got that help somebody got that you the guy you the woman you're the one i mean you know god could call your name out right that's what they said don't be bringing her you know a pitchfork and pitching in here pitching attack bring a rank and rake it all home oh jesus let's sweet jesus back again notice he told him that he paul's desire is i want to feed you strong meat but instead now you come into a place that you're having to use milk this is why paul admonished the very following chapter he admonishes the people let us therefore laying aside the principles of the doctrines of christ we repented we've been baptized sanctified by the blood yes let's go on to perfection what is perfection let's get into the holy ghost let's get into the promised land let's get into christ let's get into the place where the spiritual blessings lie into the place of adoption into the place where what is really on the inside of us is made manifest you see israel while walking in the wilderness they were waiting on the manna to fall but as soon as they came across the jordan their diet changed it went from manna to the old corn they went from manna to the mature life what was the old corn it was that which had been buried died and raised again and come into full maturity they came into that and partaking of that word this is where we've come into this is where every son and daughter of god when you come into that across the jordan you are a partaker of that old corn that resurrection power you're feeding on that word it's life to you i in the message spiritual food in due season brother brahm says i want you to get built up now in the holy oracles of god in the faith the faith of this hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing faith be taken up right this is the burden to be built up in that faith strong meat belonging to them that are full age right you know the spirit of god would stand and many times where the prophet was saying he said we ought to be further advanced than we are and i'm sure that let me just say it like this every one of us and as a spiritual minded believer it's not just something that we join in as a casual course and say yeah we ought to be further up the road but to a believer it's something about it your life you're being evaluated you reflect in your walk with god the desire that you have every day is am i pleasing to my lord these are things that are being evaluated in your life daily it's not a casual approach to serving god but it's something you're very intentional he is your life it's not just something that's of going to church but he's your life you see god's desires will be calling out to the to this hebrew church the same way when brother branham would stand there and he says god is supplying he wants to supply that strong meat and i believe that god has been supplying strongly but you know there are times where you got to come back you see even in the prophet's ministry brother branham would come back sometimes and brother branham would come in and he would minister certain things in the church he would be preaching things and here he is he's out and he's getting ready to come back for the holy ghost series and he says i've got a burden to go back there because there's many in the tabernacle that are good fine people but they need to be born again you see the burden the burden of the spirit of god which comes down to what is the need for the hour and god has to operate and move within all those channels and listen the word the word as we're preaching on sunday the word if a person can just let go the word will take us it'll build faith to walk with god but these parts that we're reading about here these are where people just said why do i have to do that this is good enough it's just church life church life it's just their lives are in and out up and down let me just tell you something an up and down and in and out life you need to be born again say it frankly you have not been born again in and out up and down and all over the place and floating over here floating over there that's a life that's never been grounded in jesus christ for once that life is grounded in jesus christ they've found their mate you see they're in tune with an unseen world they're following him and it's saying that we don't experience times where we maybe in our spirit get a little down but you understand what i'm talking about where you get sometimes where people all of a sudden they come back to church and you say should we put you on the visitor list or are you part of the regulars preach brother samuel i know these are milk truths yes there's some other milk truth but let's let's move on here you see the things sometimes we're looking for all of this remember it's little foxes that spoil the vine brother brown would even identify a simple little fox such as setting down to scarf down your meal and not asking god for blessing simplicity the bible says let everything be received with thanksgiving in prayer simple little things that we say oh that's not that deep that's christian life the bible says whosoever added to the word or take of the way his pot will be taken out of the word of the book of life sometimes that adding and taking has nothing to do with people ripping out scripture it has simply down to where they emphasize some and de-emphasize others that is also taking and adding to the word of god you don't add it you don't emphasize here and de-emphasize there it's all the word of god the bible says all scripture is given by inspiration of god i said jesus let's put away the gerber milk bottles amen in all that you have seen and heard let me think about it wouldn't it look funny if you seen a guy come in here i mean maybe a guy like even shane and shane walked around in here and him and lily got married and he had this great big secret and the big secret was he still took a bottle oh boy lily said why didn't his dad or mama or the pastor say something here lily be saying man there is some problems here this guy wants a bottle you know why you would look at look at his size you look at his age you say hey this is something that should have passed away a long time ago and you're still carrying a bottle right right you see this is why the spirit of god deals with our life no it's not god condemning it's not god saying aha you're a you're a bottle sucker you drink milk that's not what god's doing god is letting us know you're not to dwell on the bottle it's necessary for milk when you're a newborn but the desire is gone take me on i want to eat that meat that belongs to me [Applause] oh my oh glory in all that you have seen notice about the ram says in all that you have seen heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you've seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether that be of god or not there's a lot of things you can accumulate right sometimes people have accumulated hurts for years they've accumulated offenses they've accumulated this and accumulated that but you see what god's desire is take everything that you've heard all of the miracles that you've seen and accumulate that in your heart take it in so you see what is it it's feeding brother brown says the reason you're still on milk is we're not feeding enough so to feed is to is to yield and to take in that word to really give ourselves to that word to really consecrate ourselves to the word of god amen it's not just something we do haphazardly neither is it gonna be something where you're sitting right in front of maybe a tape recorder or you've got your phone right there and you're watching all the words go down through there it isn't even that whatsoever at all it's where you are open and available to god and you're giving yourself to the word feeding on the word because if you don't feed you don't grow that's a very simple truth but if you don't feed you don't grow challenges and situations and things come in your life the enemy's business is to try to break and disrupt your feeding his desire is to try to interrupt that because you know we all have things in life okay you you've got to live there's things you have you have to live there's things that you have to do but even within everything that we do sometimes seasons of our life are more busy than other seasons because there's things sometimes that happen in seasons we didn't ask for that's true right sometimes you have seasons in your life you're going through things you didn't ask for all those things to come about maybe it's something in the home maybe it's something with family maybe what's up all these things that's going on in that time and your normal times and everything else seems so condensed seems like what everything's thrown out of whack what should i do say god you knew this was going to come whatever it might be maybe it's something you have to tend to or do but say god let my let the peace of god rule let me just guide me through this let me know lord just speak to my heart lord even in the times that i may not have the time in this season of quantity but god i want quality amen i want quality with you lord i want to dedicate myself and my heart my life to you let me finish this quote here it's like elijah of old said if god be god then serve him amen and if jesus is the center of all things to the christian then i think we ought to let loose of everything else and cleave to him remember he is the center he's the north star he's the ultimate he's the absolute there's only one thing that can point to the north star that's your compass that you're selling with and the compass that i'm trying trying you to sell with is is the word trying to get you to sell with is the word and the word always points to him see in the days of elijah the people were between two opinions that of baal that of god right a person can try to live between two desires right but now what do we look for we look for the word from god to come and to deliver us from two opinions yes just like jesus said no man can serve two masters you see the word what what did what did elijah operate by the word that come from god baal all they did no fire came and elijah said pour water on it this is not a kindled fire of man pour water on it there was no fire there matter of fact everything seemed impossible that might be like your life tonight you might it might seem impossible to you but not to god amen that's right the same god that sent the fire on that altar is the same god that can come upon the altar of your heart the same god who brought the fire there is the same god that can come to your altar come to your life and to where you're no longer divided between two opinions to where your life becomes an expression of not an opinion but i know that i know that i know that i know the lord he is god then what happens from there your life revolves around him everything the decisions what happens as a family what happens in your life even decisions that come your way when it comes in in the natural realm everything gets passed through the north star what is the north star about think about those who were when when when when uh it were in slavery and the underground railroad i love reading on that you recognize a lot of places around here oberlin into sandusky and other places and what did they have to follow there's certain markers by nature they would they would find that moss on the north side of the tree they would also find that that north star because that north star never moves it holds its position amen is that right and jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said i'm god and i change not man have tried to change position and it should have considered the church growing towards him and moving into him the church is going a different direction but you see god has sent eyes to holy spirit that we might see that north star what does it do it reveals that the north star is not somewhere way out there but it's the same god who comes on the scene like he did with elisha there a day at dolphin and gahesa said oh my goodness look at all this situation but eliza said god open this boy's eyes that he can see that there's more with us than there is with them what was it open his eyes to that other realm that's more real than this round amen amen it affected him it changed and that north star then everything in our life it revolves around him the decisions in life it revolves around him he is our anchor our absolute you know what an absolute is you know this guy in the stand his son's up there you know up to bat and this guy you know he's looking at every one of them if his son doesn't swing in it's a ball right i mean he can see even though he's not behind the blade it's a ball i mean just next one comes he don't swing ball but what he says ain't showing up on the scoreboard instead what showed up was two dots next to strike why his voice is not the voice of the absolute hallelujah but the umpire who is standing there behind the plate is the one who's making the call it doesn't matter how disturbed this guy gets in the stand it's the guy behind the plate who has the authority and there's no higher and greater authority than the word of god amen as jesus christ the holy spirit gets into the word and he makes the call man can make this call the reasoning a man can make this call but when jesus christ he makes the call his sheep hear his voice and it's an absolute let's just stop here tonight spiritual admonition spiritual admonition oh god within our hearts and lives this is my prayer for all of us as as even as an assembly we look at things and we see many times it's little things that we leave undone you want to see we want to see more of god we want to see more of god within our lives it's not just it runs much deeper than just a good service for a good meeting it's where that word's gonna be taken into our life and it's gonna be a change to where we're not just coming back and forth to church and there's no prayer life there's no walking with god i realize this is spiritual ammunition but the spiritual will catch it the cardinal will say sometimes the cardinal will not say well that's not necessary but the cardinal just kind of looks at it like well i don't understand this or i don't but the spiritual says god you're the revealer yes amen you're the one who opens eyes you're the one who reveals these things you're the one who puts things in motion lord i'm one of your children praise the lord i'm one of your sheep amen you say listen how does that come more and more the more you feed on the word and in prayer what's happening you're being built up because there's vitamins in this word amen let's pray lord jesus father i pray lord with these things lord that you just laid on my heart lord just to just to reflect upon lord just these things and how paul would would speak to to that corinthian church he would let him know the real thing that he's letting him know and there even in hebrews 5 is don't live beneath your privilege but live live in the privileges that is afforded to us as sons and daughters of god father i pray tonight dear god that may lord in every life and every heart i pray that god it would be that of where lord it's strong meat i pray that god that you'll continue to as hearts would really take in of the word i realized lord that even though lord i i wouldn't want it to be this way but i realized lord that sometimes it could just go right on through but i know that god there is the spiritual is going they're going to catch it and lord always heed to it because i think of that man the one time who was coming up had to go up this mountain road and he asked he asked this this drivers he needed to take a driver to take him up there and he came up to this driver and that driver said oh no he said i can i can get real close to the edge i can get within so much of a fraction he walked around he found another guy this other guy he says can you take me up there that guy says well i can he said but i i just stay awful close to the mountain he said i hug that mountain real tight i don't try to get close to the edge the driver said you're the guy i want to drive me up [Music] lord we don't want to see how close we can live to the edge [Music] we want to live close to you lord i believe the desire [Music] of the hearts and lives maybe there's some listening some here maybe lord there's questions that has arose in their heart and now clarity has come that god they need to move to a place to where their diet changes moving into a place lord from the wilderness into the promised land need to move lord from milk to strong meat they need to move on with you not being content with just drinking milk but god having a desire now lord i can't give them that desire nobody can but lord if that desire is in them it's because you put it in them and lord you're the one god is able to bring them into that place to where their desire becomes fully expressed lord i asked god that you would grant that i pray for hearts lord and lives that because we understand that lord the milk itself oh it's necessary every newborn babe needs milk it needs milk before other things will come [Music] the lord we believe this is the time and i believe that god that is sons and daughters of god they can recognize in taking you at your word they can take in lord as your prophet would say it this way he said they can take in that sincere milk he said like that milk and honey from canaan and let it stimulate their faith in the promise i pray tonight god that you would grant that to their heart as they earnestly are looking to you i pray lord i pray god that as you would move continue to move among us lord lord we don't want to be found resting and leaning upon milk but we want to be lord feeding upon that strong meat [Music] taking in oh god the nutrients of that word we see a paul address that there was conduct there was character there was divisions envious strife these things that were allowed oh god let us operate i can't ask for everybody else but i asked for right here within this local assembly let us be spiritual let us recognize the devil at every one of his tricks lord help us so god and as we recognize the devil and every one of his tricks let us recognize that god inside of us is greater granted lord god i pray may we operate in that spiritual realm and lord if there if the carnal if we come over under that side may we be inclined and in tune and be spiritual lord to say forgive me may we lord repent where repentance is needed lord because we know that god repentance it restores fellowship brings unity brings harmony that's your desire lord with our lives as a body that you might be glorified in our midst oh god help us may we take lord the spiritual admonition tonight lord just take lord just giving ourselves even more to you lord help us lord that we might continue to grow may god that each and every one lord be full of the holy ghost and father those of us lord that you have filled may we be refilled oh god lord more and more of you lord may we not take this word as a casual approach but god to be very earnest be very diligent be sincere be dedicated be intentional granted lord i pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen you love him oh glory be to god oh my let's stand [Music] let it be [Music] jesus is [Music] let it be but thou art strong oh jesus keep me from all wrongs [Music] foreign [Music] oh let it be a prayer now oh just i closer one with me [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] let it be and through this world if i falter [Applause] [Music] lord [Applause] [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] jesus is my free day oh let it be [Music] four times [Music] true [Music] [Applause] oh just [Music] this is [Music] oh let it be you know paul paul would write even in the admonition he would come and say when i was a child i thought as a child but when i became a man then i put away childish things and you know isn't it true in your life there's things sometimes it's funny when it comes to a time that you don't have to tell you know this particular child to ignore what this child is saying it just happens you remember in your own you know in your own life you had people who were younger than you but you were the no no and was always digging at him digging at him digging at him and then eventually you come to a spot that you recognize what happened you grew up a little bit and and that which you used to no like you had to prove your point you had to show your i'm older than you when he gets to a spot you grow out of that and then when you grow out of it then you can look back on and say oh man mom and dad had to hear me mom and dad had to hear me what what did i look like you looked like a kid that was growing but eventually you put away that what put that away and i know some some people don't ever put that away but that's another service but you understand how it normally should be put away what happens you look back and you think how childish that was how insignificant that was what causes it growth maturity how does growth and maturity come love is expressed to you you receive love you grow you grow and you develop this is what god's love is to you and i god's love to us is not just always telling us how good we are but it can tell us areas we need to improve on hey you need to pick it up here this and we grow and then eventually we come back to a place and say my goodness and then i was hanging on to that see you don't you don't look you don't look at it the same way anymore you put away childish things i say i thank god for his grace that he deals with our life to lay aside childish things you say oh brother samuel praise god i've laid aside all tried childish things no you haven't that's one right there you're still laying them aside you're still laying them at a sign as god brings it to our attention but we want to keep growing like an example i use a brother shane we don't want to we don't want to be walking in with milk bottles 15 20 30 years old we want to come in when we come to the house of god we want to come ready we get in here we read our bibles and we pray we come in here like we mean business like we're expecting to hear from god we get ready we're we're coming and every not just here but every day of our life [Music] you love the lord amen let's just let's be dismissed father lord let the words be in our bosom may your lord just continue to as you did the disciples they would recall to their mind by the holy ghost the gospels and then you taught them further lord may you lord take the word in our hearts teach us further show us personally lord in our life and our walk with you be with each and every one as we go our separate ways lord may you continue to keep your hand upon us moving god i pray for those lord that are sick in their body those that are suffering those that are in need lord may you minister to their needs and especially may we all god continue to grow in you and lay aside everything of this world we pray in jesus name amen god bless you tonight you're dismissed in the name of the lord [Music] [Applause] without you i know i would never [Music] with you jesus [Music] oh without you i know i could never make heaven
