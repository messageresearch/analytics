hallelujah hallelujah I'm glad he's still a way maker aren't you Amen in every every part of our life amen God is faithful amen and you know it's like the brother Bram gave us that little point of how great the word of God is he said it's like the the the black brother had said I'd rather be standing on his word than in heaven he said because the Bible said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away amen and you know God God makes his word so sure to our hearts just a little bit turn it down just a little to our hearts you know God He makes himself real to you and I I think about it that we can we can set you know as a person as a young person in his presence for many for many times but yet when that strikes our heart and we can recognize what he's done for us in a personal way then things begin to wake up and we can begin to recognize what God has done for us and you know that's the same thing it is with everything in every part of his word as his presence comes by friends I tell you we could be the you might be the sharpest pencil in the box but that's not what God needs God just needs a surrendered vessel because it's him he's the one that's opened our eyes he's the one that that has moved back the Red Sea he's the one that's changed our life amen and that's I'm so thankful for that aren't you I'm glad it's not based on my sharpness or how how intellect or how I'm I'm glad it's just based on him moving in when we can move ourselves out of the way you know how precious that is as we prepare to look into the word of the Lord tonight brother Brian just a little bit more um brother Dave Crest he had surgery there on Tuesday on his knee as many of you know uh he made mention of that at the fellowship dinner or when we were in our service on Sunday and uh so the surgery went extremely well and um he was back at home but they uh took him back in and the hospital today because it just while the healing is going on you kind of need you need the care around you so he had that knee replacement and uh he was already setting up on Wednesday in his rocking chair um but um so he he asked me me to thank you uh even when I was there on Tuesday and then brother Dave Jr we were talking and he has been admitted to the hospital at least to be there for a few days and then to go to rehab for somebody just to kind of care for him because um you know that's a lot with sister Shirley and then brother Dave Jr all them so you know I when I was praying I couldn't help but think about brother Bram talking about a cast being set around a bone he said you know the cast that's not what heals us the doctor can at the bone but it's God that does the healing sometimes we just need the support around us but it's God that does the healing amen so may God help us to be even in our lives to be like a cast that the Holy Spirit can work through for one another that be your desire amen let's just keep brother Dave in in prayer as well and I know there's many other needs too and we want to remember uh sister Stephanie Hannah in prayer as well I know she's doing well but she was in a car accident um my mind slips me that was Tuesday night right was Tuesday night yeah so Tuesday night but um she's doing well so we thank God for that it was certainly the mercies of the Lord and so we thank God uh for that and um we just certainly also U my uncle asked that you would just continue to keep him in prayer as you have been he should be getting transferred back over this way um and he'll be in rehab there for a little bit so uh let's just let's just approach the throne of the Lord once again and Heavenly Father Lord I know that throughout this building Lord there are needs Lord Jesus that have already been taken as prayer request there are hands that were lifted up as unspoken request there's needs Lord of on the hearts of your children and Lord we come father before your throne of grace that we might find help Lord in the time of need Lord you said ask the father anything in my name and I will do it so Lord we're coming in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord with every one of these requests and these needs Lord father for brother Dave you see the need need Lord in his body as the healing would take place Lord there in his neede I pray that God not only Lord that you would just continue to strengthen him Lord and touch him Lord and be with those Lord guiding them Lord that are giving and administering care to him Lord as he as that healing is taking place in his body we pray Heavenly Father tonight Lord that you would just continue to minister Lord to sister Stephanie as well Lord father father coming Lord through that Lord the accident and all of that Lord that is there I pray that God that you would just Lord continue to move for her in a very special way Lord and father we lord ask for every need Lord that's gathered here Among Us Lord there's many unspoken prayer requests Lord and we're all standing here Lord with a real confession that we have need of you tonight Lord now father may you come Lord and do do what no other man can do Lord may you Lord come and take Lord and open and reveal the context of this word tonight Lord May you search our hearts Lord and may father you go down lord into every channel and every area of our life oh God and Lord giving us the grace Lord as we would yield and surrender Lord and as we would leave out of this place tonight Lord oh God it would be less of ourselves and more of you Lord I pray that God you would have your way Minister Lord to every need Lord that's not only gathered here but Lord that would be streaming or that are an archive Lord May the Holy Spirit Lord be the spokesman tonight Lord and take the word Lord May the dove lead the way oh God and Lord the word would find its Mark and its resting place Lord in our lives Lord and once again Lord it be manifested that Lord Satan is defeated granted Lord we pray father May every lie be dismantled May every hole be broken Lord we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen amen let's go to the scriptures in 1 Chronicles chapter 28 and maybe as you're standing there I just wasn't it nice to come in on the parking lot yeah I'm sure the brothers didn't mind about their shoes but uh I know for the Sisters there that was something really special and U I was also told to give you Direction sister Stephanie to make sure you pull up to the parking block I won't tell who told me that but somebody said that in here very dear brother but um I appreciate Brother Carlos and the brothers uh being there to kind of the uh when we put that on on the email uh we don't quite have the the we're using we actually have what was normally before overflow parking where was out right out here well now that's parking lot and and so then eventually their brothers are working on getting overflow for when we have meetings and things like that and for people to park and that's what all that gravel that they pulled back out of here will will go towards and you can see they've already started this but the reason we asked you in here before it's to try to fill this up down in here first um is because everybody's you're always going to be able to get in and out that's one thing that's for sure I know sometimes people would park out here there'd be only three people here and people would be parking out there now I know sometimes we're creatures of habit you know it's like I've got I've got funny little memes where the the church where there's people stacked on top of one another in the back pew and everybody say hey there's room up front you know so I I know we kind of get in habits about things but the reason we're just trying to do that is um because it's a little bit easier to see up here and the brothers will kind of direct you and and if you have to leave early don't worry you're going to be able to get out there there won't we won't have you know a lot of those things down the center like we had before and um I'll go over a little bit more of this in the um uh maybe on Sunday when we have um more here but some of you that have the compact cars I kind of wish I had a compact car because right there in front of those stairs right there those there's where a compact car is and I and probably everybody's thinking about man I knew it was the will of the Lord for me to trade for a compact car but um so we have because those kind of stick out a little bit right there and so we just want to just kind of keep that in mind the brothers will help us and um as soon as we uh have that decided on you know who's going to stripe it for us and things like that brothers are working on uh getting those things and we're going to have that done uh so that'll that would also be kind of helpful as well but um I'm just thankful that we have God has provided us with a nice parking lot amen I want to say God bless you for your amen your sacrifice and giving and and making it all possible because it it's all come from him hasn't it amen we just we so thank the Lord uh I look out there many times and I have to kind of pinch myself I walk out and walk by the window and I take a little break from the office have to kind of pinch myself but I'm just thankful for what God has provided amen verse eight of 1 Chronicles 28 uh now watch in the Scripture it says now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the Lord and and the audience of our God keep and seek for all the Commandments of the Lord your God now I want you to notice those words keep them remember is to observe them but also to seek after them to inquire this is why the when the prophet would say the we can never overemphasize the importance of revelation of seeking after God David wrote of that in Psalms 27 on and on we could we could go with that but that's so important is that we God help us not to lose sight of seeking after him amen amen keep him and seek for all the Commandments of the Lord your God that ye may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you forever and thou Solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the Lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imagination of the thought thoughts now notice the imagination the framing the putting the Gathering Together of things of the thoughts God under standeth he discerne all of those things I say I want mine discerned I want my life to be discerned I I I want it to be under his discernment and what a privilege that is if thou seek him there it is again he will be found of thee but if thou forsake Him He will cast thee off forever now that word forsake doesn't necessarily mean where you turn and go the opposite way it just means to stop seeking after him oh take heed now for the Lord hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary be strong and do it may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'm going to keep on reading there if that'd be all right take heed now for the Lord ha chosen thee to build a house for the sanctuary be strong and do it then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch and the houses and treasuries thereof and of the upper chambers thereof and of the inner parlors thereof and of the place of the mercy seat and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit of the Courts of the house of the Lord and of all the chambers round about and of the treasuries of the house of God and of the treasuries of the dedicated things also for the courses of the priests and Levites and for all the work of the service of the house of the Lord and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord we can see within it that God laid sufficient a pattern but it was not a pattern that was just that was something that was devised in the in man's mind remember when God caught Moses up in the cloud God revealed his pattern to Moses and Moses came back down with with that vision and now what was in the heavenlies now became sounded out upon Earth and if God God delivers a message he has lives that are going to receive that word and become what he has spoken as a matter of fact brother Bram talked about of just reading today where those wise men he said they saw that star and he said they had been taught that they were expecting it and he said it passed over many others that never saw it and he said see it just goes to show if God has intended for you to see it you will see itall oh my amen so Brianna go ahead and change it for me I'd like to just speak here once again tonight on this and try to by God's grace this is dangerous to say but try to finish this thought up on framing uh reality and when we look at this of the of the pattern that God God had given and where David here is pulling this from by the spirit he has received this by the spirit it's the same as when God had spoke to Moses and when the Lord spoke to Moses God said let them make me a sanctuary now it was God's pattern but they had to be willing to make the sanctuary or Surrender what was already in their possession and surrender it to him and when it came under the vision and under under his under under his pattern then it there surrendered it became Sanctified it became committed and he took what was already in their possession and now it became uh constructed as a place for God to come down and Tabernacle and dwell among them and I I think that's the greatest thing that you and I are called upon to do God doesn't ask us to go out and get something else or if I can do this and I can be a a better person the only thing that God asked for for is for our lives to be surrendered to him and when it's surrendered to him then God can take what he already knows he's deposited there and he can bring it forth and it becomes a tabernacle that he'll house himself in that his glory would be reflected in a trophy of his unmerited grace so it's according to all the pattern that I show thee so there had to be that of a of a pattern that was revealed and when you think of this with a pattern that has been set before us God laid out everything of every detail in the pattern just like when we were reading this here of how that David was communicating to Solomon it's the same way when God reveals the pattern to that of Moses and I want you to notice in Exodus 25 God's pattern God's pattern he does not begin to release the vision of this of the Tabernacle and work from the outside in but the very first thing that he talks about being constructed is the ark because God deals with the principal part God knows if if he can get the heart right then everything else will come out right because when he sets down there then everything else will begin to take control remember the prophet said when we take the word he said too many do not go clear down to the inside with it they'll only go to the spirit realm but we've got to go all the way down to the inside that's what real true repentance is because real repentance uh is not just I'm sorry because I got caught it's that's not what it is but real repentance is is because Lord I I I forgive me for the wrong that I've done not just for the action but for what is dwelling in my life that would allow that action to come out is everybody with me because we can cut you know it's like it's like weeds you know if you snap that weed off in the flower bed it's going to come back right there you got to get the root of it and this is why when he himself he would come he was the root he was the he was the beginning of the creation of God the author he come to deal with the root of the problem and that was unbelief so to think of how that God would lay would lay this out and what a what a transformation what a condensation that God would lay out this this pattern here from the Tabernacle which ultimately it spoke of you and I it spoke not only did this speak of Christ but this was speaking remember the whole purpose that he became flesh that God the word was made flesh is because God intended for you and I to come back into that place to where his image would be reflected in you and I once again God intended for the work word to become flesh in our life and the only way that could happen is that God himself came down and became our mediator he's came down and he's the one who spanned the breach for you and I he's the one that did away with the chasm he's the one that brought you and I back into that place to where now through the shedding of the blood the Holy Spirit cries out the great Dove of God with the blood dripping from its wings come hither come Beyond the Veil well I'm not worthy no I have made you worthy my blood was shed for you I have made you worthy that I might come and dwell in you that I in you and you in me God's desire that that that would become into that place for him to Tabernacle in a many member body the same life same spirit of God this is why as it started from here God showed with the three room house and God came down and lived in a body of Flesh that he himself created Hallelujah are you with me he knew what it was to get weary he knew what it was to get down the Bible said he was tempted in all points such as we are yet without sin he had to be without sin why because he was the Passover Lamb are you with me so that through the shedding of his blood when you and I would fall fall short there is a blood there is a life that there on the inside that brings you and I back into Fellowship thanks be to God aren't you thankful for that he become our example this is where God became our example of what he intended every son and daughter of God to be God didn't leave it out here where it would just be something that we would have to imagine see they long remember the prophets would tap into and they would tap into this attribute and tap into that attribute this is why when the Lord Jesus stood there he said who do men say that I am some say you're Jeremiah some say Elijah why because he was all of the rainbow right it was Christ in them that's why the Bible said in Isaiah 53 he is despised and rejected of men he is he is he was despised and rejected in the ministry of Noah he was despised and reject rejected in the ministry of Moses who was it that was in them Christ who did they follow in the wilderness Christ who was it that equipped them according to all that was given in that time to live a Victorious Life it was Christ who is it that held Moses stable and stabilized his life he endured as seeing him who is invisible this is why he is the stability of Our Lives when we once can catch a glimpse of the Unseen God and it becomes visible it becomes a reality he is revealed through his word it stabilizes Us in the midst of storms he is an anchor the anchor of our soul that is within the veil amen like the little boy that had that string and had that kite and it was a cloudy day and the guy walked by and said hey what you got on the other end of that kite or the other end of that string he said I got a kite on the other end of it he looked up and he said I don't see no kite all I see is clouds he said oh there's a k kite up there it's just above those clouds he said how do you know that he said cuz every once in a while I feel a little tug on this end aren't you thankful for the tug he became our example so much to those now born of his Spirit can have the same testimony by the same life that is he said not mine will but thine will be done when he said I came not to do mine own will you see that that's the whole that's the whole whole whole uh uh uh theme of that first birth is self it's self our first birth it's all about self that's the Eve was drawn into the place of the Fall because of self see here Satan begin to anoint her with unbelief and unbelief Drew her to a place to look at something above the word of God but never are we to look at anything above the word of God As a matter of fact never are we to look at the word of God just straight on but always to Humble ourself and come under the word that's our god-given Authority that's our strength is humble ourselves to the word of God that's what the Lord Jesus did he humbled himself to the Cross is that right he humbled himself to the word of God when it came time to fulfill the word he humbled himself he wrestled it out not my will but thine will be done I'm not come to do my will but thy will and I can say that same life inside of you and I gives us a good confidence greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world yes sir amen now notice how that Paul would write this in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and he would speak of this what know you not that your body is the temple The Dwelling Place of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own now this this is a scripture that I know is all through bookstores and every we pretty much got this and and memorized but it's a very key thing we are not and ye are not your own that's a question mark do we realize that that we're not our own amen yes we've been bought with the pr listen not only where we purchased from listen now Redemption Works to purchase us from the slave market and then Redemption goes deeper to reconciliation to where it brings about a change in our nature to where we can never ever be slaves anymore but our lives are now yolked with him in a union we can never be the same in anymore amen we're not our own at one time we were moved about by the prince of power of the air is that right we were influenced we were we were moved in these Direction but now to recognize this that that it's it's not about me no longer righten and I just say it like this that even when the Holy Spirit H H how many remember when God first got a hold of your life remember the tenderness remember the sweetness I'm not saying it should be brittle and hard that's not what I'm talking about now but you remember man this everything was my it just seemed like the birds sung different everything was different it it was like nothing man could ever just you know catch in and all I mean things were just being brushed off but then as things go on a little bit with even within our life and our journey remember Satan's desire is to try to hinder the expression of Christ in our lives he would love nothing more than to stunt our growth and then we find that well wonder why this is bothering and wonder why that but we remember this is where we come to this place that I'm not my own I I could do that I could act that way I could hold that Grudge but I'm not my own this is a temple of the Holy Ghost and God gave a pattern of the treasuries and the treasuries are where things are to be stored I I I don't want the wrong things stored up right I don't want the wrong thing stored up I I you to say what do you mean by that you mean we can strip away all of our memories that's not what I'm talking about but we can live in such a in such a place in Christ to where the memories no longer torment Hallelujah no longer Drive no longer move no longer influence but where the very sting within that gate of memory has been taken out because there are good memories too yes is that right yes oh I you are not your own for you are bought with a prize therefore glorify notice show forth God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods now it's the soul that he come to redeem that will lead to the Redemption of the body is that right that's what we're looking for the Redemption there of the body but it first come what Redemption come for is to redeem that soul to claim back what belonged to him is that right that's what the new birth is about the New Birth is about the quickening power coming to that soul and that first nature dying to self and now the very nature of Christ is raised up on the inside is that right I always think how brother Bram you know he would he would put it like this he would say you know in the message total Deliverance I I love that message brother BR said you know he said here was the Lord Jesus he said he was as much man in his Humanity as he was God but he said what he chose to do this was to me a powerful statement he chose to deliver his natural Parts into the hand of almighty God and he said he could have been a man for he was a man but he chose to completely commit himself into the hands of the father that's a powerful statement to me he could have been a man for he was a man you know it's like you or I could say well you know I was born this way or I was raised in this family you've got a choice I've got a choice we've got a choice to say well this Browning strain or this brown or sthers or whatever as it goes through your straight we have a choice are you hearing me yes we have a choice within that but oh my God God has given us Grace to where that you and I can actually commit ourselves into his hands and I'll tell you friends that's not something that's just once at the altar it's every moment and every day of our life it's when situations arise but it must begin most importantly in the altar of our heart because that's the only way we have strength that's the only way we can live an overcoming life is when we have become part of the word amen are you with me that's the only way that's the only way to H have a real and an overcoming life it's a surrender of our will watch how brother Bram would say this here I love this he says when Christ himself the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is in you with your temperament yeah that's good that's good is that right yeah brother Bram talked about his he talked about and why things things that are to be talked about even how all the disciples are different God did never intend it now listen to me God never intended that every one of us was going to be exactly alike let me just say it like this Oneness does not mean sameness right that's good everybody with me Oneness does not mean sameness God the temperament the way God has made you sometimes we we we try to struggle and we're trying to we're fighting against the wrong thing it's not something to fight against it's yield to the Christ who is in you that that's our Victory and then he comes down and he lives his own life through our temperament you know God's made you that way brother Bram talked about how remember he had to hit the squirrels through the eye and all the rest of the brothers were down there at the holler and they were down there at Sportsman holler just knocking them left and right shooting them in the head shooting him in side and brother BR says he put his gun down against the tree and began to cry he says why am I like this why did you make me this way they're all down there having such a good time but he says I'm not able to hit them through the ey right now and brother BR how the spirit of God came back to him and said I've made you that way for a purpose so notice God took the temperament but it was not the temperament God exalted but God took the temperament and he was yielded to God and in this age God brought a message that had to hit the target it was not enough to get ever so close it had to hit right on the bullseye every single time and if it did WR he would say forgive me something's wrong something's not right oh oh I forgot this is where it's at right here something's not right oh you read that verse wrong let's read it again had to hit the dot Hallelujah why because that that is representative of the people of the last age of the Bride of Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ is not a halfhazard bride it's not just well you know God will take this and God will accept this and God understands this no it's a bride that if he listen now the prophet said if if he's hit on 16 cylinders she must hit on 16 cylinders is that right Same Spirit will do the same thing the prophet said so yielded you are that Christ speaks the kind of words he would speak he thinks the kind of thoughts he would think through you amen I'd say Grant it Lord amen let me be more yielded because I I can stand here tonight along with all the rest of us and say you know what that hasn't been 100% And you know what let me just say it like this my goal and my aim is not to be at 100% that every word I speak and somehow I've got to spiritualize it every thought I think I've got to spiritualize it I don't need to do that the only thing I have to do is it's let him be my aim if he's our aim he's our Focus I don't have to do nothing I don't have to sayoo I feel something right now let me I don't have to I can just I can walk with him let him be my aim because you know what if he's my aim if I get off there's something in my heart that says that's my Target and I need to adjust maybe it's the windage that's off a little bit maybe I'm off a little bit here but I need to get adjusted and I want to be looking at the right target hallelujah oh God that's what I want I want him to speak the right I want I want to speak the words he would speak through me I want him to think the thoughts that he would think through him is that your desire he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded and resting oh he said what a beautiful picture of a consecrated Christian yielded in Christ working through Paul said to me to live as Christ and to die is gain not me that liveth anymore but Christ that liveth in me Christ Living oh this is so key in the individual so surrendered when Christ speaks through the lips thinks through the Mind sees through the eye acts through the temperaments then the things of the world has passed away how can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time Christ has got control that's what it is it's Christ in you amen this is why brother Bam could tell us that he says and over and over in the message remember he talks about the dream that Joseph how God visited Joseph by dream when he was minded to put Mary away privately and and here the angel of the Lord came to him in a dream and the prophet will take that in different places in the message and say see that only goes to show that maybe if you can whistle you can sing you can testify whatever it is let it be committed and Sanctified to his purpose and he will use it for his glory amen that's what I want I want everything to be Sanctified whatever whatever little part that that God that that I'm to play whatever it is I want it to be Sanctified to his purpose if it's ministering the gospel it's not about me it's about him if God's called you to testify it's not about you it's about him God will not share his glory with any man if God's called you to sing come on friends then we want it Lord I want it to be committed to your purpose oh brother Samuel my singing is just for the Lord then how about using it to bless the Saints of almighty God how about praying over it and asking God instead of saying you know what I I just I'm going to hang up my heart on a willow tree but Lord this is something you placed in my life now maybe maybe something has got in the way where you've pulled back your talent from under his presence maybe it's an offense maybe it's cares of Life maybe it's discouragements maybe it's disp ABY all of those things that within the humanity that we can experience but oh may God help us in this time to realize that we are not our own do you realize friends one of the greatest victories many time you're ever discouraged to be delivered from discouragement is to pray for somebody else that's one of the greatest that's one of the greatest victories but so many times when we're down we're praying God give me strength Lord Lord Lord help me to make it Lord help me to put one foot in front of the other I'm not putting you down friends I've been there but I'm saying that one of the greatest things is when we can turn from our own needs and enter in on behalf of the needs of others amen I want God to use those faculties what however he sees to use it this is where Christ he's our absolute everybody agree on that Christ is our absolute he's the one that he in other words it's infalible there's no error Christ is our absolute this is what we're holding to I want to see what does he think what does he see about these situations this is why Paul could write of it this way and speak to the Believers and say let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which you are called in one body and be ye thankful and let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord let me just tell you the most powerful set of teaching is not what we say it's the life that we live that's the most powerful form of teaching there is is a lived image is that right now I want you to think of this this scripture CU these these two scriptures with Paul giving this teer Paul did not Paul do not given by inspiration to say you know I'm just going to take this and and there's some you know sorry sorry people that are in the the Colossal church and and they kind of need this you know there's others that don't need this but no God God brings his word to admonish you and I to see that the mark is set and that our eyes would continually be upon the mark let me tell you friends I'm not trusting in myself I'm not resting in myself I I know where I'm standing because I'm looking to him and letting the word examine my own life not my imagination about it but reality when reality calls out and says Samuel you're not hitting the mark right here Samuel you need to pick it up right here that is a reality that God brings us to right so that we might continue to hit the mark want to let the word this these two scriptures go hand in hand we want to let the peace of God rule in our life let let let C how does that rule by letting the word of Christ dwell in US richly now I want you to think of this the Bible here as it says in the Amplified it said let the peace from Christ rule watch this this is what the word rule means in the Greek act as an Umpire continually what if brother Bram over and over give the example in the message the absolute he said there's always there's an absolute in every in a contest right there's people man they get upset at the umpires I remember when I you know was back back in uh just in my young days and we we were watching you know some uh I don't know if it was what what they call it when they played the baseball outside of the season in high school but we were there and I remember there was this guy it was when we were down in Salena and I remember this guy he was haggling this R this umpire over and over and over and over and finally that umpire walked over and said get out of here they came and got the guy and escorted him he didn't want to leave cuz one of his sons was playing on the team and finally he walked over and said get out of here because you know why it didn't matter what he said the Umpire is what had the final Authority and that's why it should be Christ that has the final Authority listen friends it's the very nature of Jesus Christ that's been revealed and brought before you and I in this hour not just a portion not just a sliver not just the red light not just a yellow light not just an orange light but the very fullness of Christ the seals were taken off the book The Very nature of Christ has come in full View and when I turn to see a lion one with authority I saw a lamb in the mystery of our Authority lays in the submissiveness of our heart to the word of God that is so good Hallelujah Let It Be Where it's constantly in our hearts not brother Bill what do you think about no no no no it's got to there's got to be an Umpire in our hearts Brother Ray what do you think about no no no it's got to be the Umpire inside of us this is why nobody else can be your Holy Ghost it's got to be the Holy Ghost in you this is why the prophet said that when that picture I showed you before there of in the in the Tabernacle in the wilderness The Mercy Seat that was a judgment seat of Christ right there then it moved into Christ right there at the River Jordan and it became AUD judgement seat but after the calvary and the sending back of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost the human heart became The Mercy Seat of God once again it became the Judgment seat of Christ you say what do you mean by judgment seat to where that our sins are taken daily and if somebody says well I believe God I've got the Holy Ghost but it don't condemn me to dress like this it don't condemn me to do this it don't condemn me to do that it shows they're missing the Judgment seat of Christ because when the word has come in then the heart becomes the Judgment seat of Christ and there is a condemning if anything is wrong even to a thought is that right this was God's desire you see he said he would be a guide he would be a teacher he would lead and guide us into all things God never gave us the Holy Ghost and said all right automatically everything is good to go you won't have need of nothing no now we take in the word and the the word is leading us and guiding us and the spirit within us beareth witness with his spirit that we're the children of God Amen is that right this is why within the middle of that umpire this is why when everything is going on the prophet said hold to that little wheel in the middle of the wheel let it stabilize every move and every motion that you make let it let it be the absolute the anchor not not let's not my feelings not my past not complexes from when I was a young person and you know what how you say brother say how do I know that I have them complexes when the word or something comes across our pathway and now there begins to be a deviating and now if we're not careful we'll make an excuse for something you say how do I know when it's not according to the word because you might have the letter down but if the character and the nature is wrong then the letter that you're holding to you've got the wrong interpretation is that right and in order for the word to be an absolute the UR must speak is that right it must speak all the way if it don't speak according to all the law and Prophets don't believe it for there's no light in it how many times you and I have had to lay down our feelings our thoughts see remember this is what God's desire was is to be manif ested and manifest his victory and Glory through a many membered body my goodness God would take a hold of your life and my life and he knew what he was getting into but you see God's Got Confidence in his word that he know he had sown within our hearts and God operates and he comes through his word he'll never come by our emotions he doesn't come through our feelings God comes by his word so with every situation that we face he comes by his word oh my and when he comes by his word then there's that part on the inside that raises up and said who is he that cometh in the name of the Lord it'll say raise up those gates open up those Gates you see there is a witness of him oh my through all the pressures and everything of life because every one of these things come at us is that right Temptation ambition Fame trial stress all of these things come at us and we're not exempt but we want to hold to that will in the middle of a wheel right amen that's what we want to hold to that's my anchor I want to pass all judgment through him it'd be like you know when when I went to go buy my first car huh I had my dad with me I mean I've been in a you know I've been a little boy and sat over there while they made the deals for hours long before right I don't know how it was going to be I don't know what to look for I mean it ain't like you walk in there trust in every car salesman like they're your best friend and got your best interest right if you got a dollar on your shoe they'll get it I mean they're got they got to make their money I I I I get it I we we could go on and they could spend a month of Sundays on that but my point was is that I didn't know I didn't know how to do it so I took I took my dad with me once I took my dad with me and I ran things by him of what I was thinking ran things by him well then eventually when I went to go buy other cars I could walk in there with my spreadsheets already on my phone and on my iPad and I said now let's see you know how they do I work this is going to can you do this payment I talking about payments how much are I you give me for my car because I've already figured out a cost I've got all these tabs on interest rates I already know brother Sam you didn't oh I did I did I I want to know because when I put it into my spreadsheet in my budget I want to know before I go in there right that's a separate thing but I I I again as that example comes to me that you see this is why we don't have to try to be big we can say Lord I'm going to put my hand in your hand I I don't know how to walk through this situation I don't know how to face this because frankly friends there's some of us all the way through we are facing things we've never had to face before and there's things that if God carries we'll face that we've never had to face before and there's things that maybe somebody else has gone through but then when it comes time for you and I to go through it that's where we have to say look Lord I put my hand in your hand Lord I I I can't see my way through Lord show me Lord thy ways show me how to conduct myself Lord guide me in the midst of this moment Lord I want him to hold my hand amen you love him Amen Let me just read this quote and close I'm I'm not where I wanted to be but we'll get there told you that's the danger Bram says it like this and is your life worthy of the Gospel to me this is this is it's just a powerful quote I come back to this many times brother Bram is talking about how he so lived in the word till he became the word brother Bram said oh God let me hold both of my hands to God before this audience let me live like that let this word so become that me and this word is the same thing Let My Words Be this word let the meditation of my heart let him be in my heart on my mind tie his Commandments upon the post of my intelligence tie them upon the post of my heart and let me just see Jesus amen when Temptation Rises let me see Jesus when things go wrong let me just see him amen when I get ready and the enemy will try to make me get angry let me see Jesus what would he do he was so much in the word till him and the word became the selfs thing you see this is our Victory this this right here is not beyond your reach tonight it's not beyond our reach tonight the key is is as brother Ram is asking and praying let this word so become that me and this word is the self same thing Let My Words Be his word let the meditation of my heart let it let it so dwell in me remember what God told Joshua meditate on these things Psalms chapter 1 blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night this is this is a victory you see we could we could you know it's like standing here and saying we shouldn't do this and shouldn't do that and and we can do that friends we can talk talk about even looking at all the different attributes of the love of God but you know what matters is first of all that we have receive the experience of the love of God in our soul and then live from that experience when Moses went with a message he went with the experience where he had met God at the burning bush and that experience had loosened Moses from MO Moses and it tied him into the word to where when things did not go according to how he thought remember he got down there and then how things begin to happen and he but what does he do he doesn't go running back out into the Wilderness now he goes back to the Lord and he says Lord remember when they started saying we're going to increase your labors and Bricks without straw and all that he runs back to the Lord and the Lord speaks to him to do what stabilize him stabilize him he's got an inner strength I tell you tonight that's the most important thing is to have the inner strength and to live within that word that's why it's so important in laying within the message of the hour listen if you've not receive the Holy Ghost it's so important it's a necessity it's not an option it's a necessity and I I would just say it in this way Lord remedy everything in me until it matches what you have have called for I I'm going to be like Esther I'm not going to take what I think I'm going to take what you say Lord I let my heart let my heart be in a place of complete surrender to the will of God let it let it be lined in that way Lord listen friends it's not something that we have to struggle with it isn't something we for us that we have to push our way into it's to yield and to recognize that God desires to give you the Holy Ghost more than you desire to receive it amen and then after receiving after the Holy Spirit has accepted us it's to live in him let our lives be regulated by him by what by yielding to him how many know what that is when you you've read or you've heard a message or have you come out of a church and here you are going maybe the next day or driving down the road and youd begin to think about the things of the Lord you begin to just meditate on him and the things that you've heard I mean you can't think on something that you ain't heard right it's like if I mention brother Brian if I mentioned some kind of a car to you tonight and we're talk about it in the color maybe going down the road something you'll see something like that it'll stir Oh Brother Sam was talking about this certain certain car and this color and whatever more it'll stir something up but you see that's how when God comes by his word the Holy Spirit comes listen the word brings the atmosphere and all that we have to do is step into that atmosphere because that atmosphere has been created by the word himself and in that atmosphere things will take place changes will take place our will will be melted to his will things that seem so great are melted to so little in his presence if the Bible says that the mountains in his presence are melted like Wax how much more in his presence can our will not be melted down to his will I say Lord this is this is my desire am this reality this reality we're talking about Framing and putting in perspective I'm not my own I'm not my own but neither neither am I a hostage to a feeling I'm not going to be a hostage to a grudge I'm not going to be a hostage to somebody who's done me wrong I'm not going to be a hostage to besetting sin I'm not going to become a hostage I'm not going to do that now I know I can say that but I saying that from from from even in my life I trust you can too of where we come against pressures or where feelings are real but as far as having a right we could have a right to hold things are you hearing me we have a we could have a right and say I've got a right but that's true but as a lamb Lord sheer I want every minute of my right shered I I don't want nothing to take to take the Holy Spirit from me I don't want I don't want to be where I'm walking around with without his presence to guide me and Lead me you know friends that that's the greatest thing that even when you look at listen to me tonight maybe in your walk with God you started out walking with God and God dealing with your life God moving and and here you confessed your sins and there's things the Holy Spirit begins to take out of your life and all of a sudden Satan knows if I can just spring this trap and then something Rises up within you and the dove takes its flight because we become a wolf again but you know what the prophet said all you need to do is become a lamb again become a lamb again he'll come back he'll come back you see that's where when we talk about wherever you left him go back to where you left him and when you find where you left him the death will come back and lead you all the way the death left the lamb all the way to a Gethsemane not my will thine will be done the dove led the lamb all the way up Calvary and on that Easter morning it was the dove that flew down there and resurrected that body on that Easter morning and he rose up triumphant the Dove came to lead the lamb and that same Dove of the Holy Spirit has been given to you and I to lead us through all the complexities of this life through every situation he's been called he's been he is our comforter to lead us through every complex that's ever come about in our life he is a faithful guide and he is faithful to lead and guide us into all truth I believe tonight I'm talking to Believers that say Lord I don't want to just ask for forgiveness for what's wrong but Lord let the word go down let the word go down Lord let the word go down let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord you are so mindful Lord of our needs Lord I am so thankful Lord God for your grace that you have given to us Lord in this hour how could we even see ourselves as we ought to if it wasn't for your mercy Lord coming by our way Lord to open our eyes Lord Jesus help us father what we're living in a moment in a time and the Earth the Bible said is groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God earthquakes volcanoes all we see Lord the nervous tensions that's around Lord you can just you can feel it Lord You See It Lord among among people we see the insanity Lord that's all around us things that Lord that would never even be considered or entertained in the mind but we know Lord it has to get this way it was prophesied in your word that it would be this way in that time of your coming Lord Not only would there be a coming out as it was in the days of Sodom but there would be a going in as it was in the days of Noah it's a coming out of and a going into Lord father I pray Lord here this evening Lord if there would be one that's here under the sound of my voice that Lord God in your presence would be have an honest confession to say Lord I want that umpire of the holy spirit in my life I want that absolute I want the ABS absolute of Christ in my life the Holy Spirit the love of God dwelling in the Judgment seat of my heart I wonder as every head is bowed and every eyes closed I wonder how many would say Lord
