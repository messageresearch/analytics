[35:34] amen we just let you have your seats
[35:36] here and I just want to greet you in the
[35:39] name of the Lord Jesus I want to just
[35:42] just to speak of a few things before I
[35:45] get into the message here this morning I
[35:49] want to say that it's just really really
[35:53] good to be able to be here and how God
[35:56] has allowed us to be able to make this
[36:00] possible and
[36:01] I
[36:03] just want to
[36:05] say it I wish I had the video to play
[36:10] here but a
[36:11] brother fellow pastor sent me this video
[36:15] this week and
[36:17] you can just imagine the things that
[36:19] that we receive during this time that
[36:24] the situations that we are presently in
[36:27] and maybe you've seen it somebody just
[36:30] put a mean to it and what it shows is
[36:32] over in some country there's a it's a
[36:35] little hill like this almost a little
[36:38] bit that a roadway has moved upon and it
[36:40] said this is pastoring during the
[36:41] pandemic it showed this guy with a big
[36:44] Greyhound bus driving on it and he had
[36:46] to turn it around and it was rockin on
[36:48] that
[36:49] and they had to get it turned around you
[36:52] knowing and I think not just for
[36:55] pastoring because a lot of times we're
[36:57] giving things then they want us to you
[37:00] know the little things here and there to
[37:02] try to do try to ensure a part but I
[37:05] think each and every one of us and
[37:07] there's certainly a lot of things that
[37:09] I say that we have are asked to do and a
[37:13] lot of things are very
[37:16] they're not comfortable for us and not
[37:18] what we are are used to or even maybe
[37:21] would like and but I want to say -
[37:25] there's a congregation I want to thank
[37:28] you for your cooperation
[37:30] throughout these unusual times because
[37:33] one thing that we
[37:35] the part that would be very easy for us
[37:37] and sometimes and I'm just gonna be very
[37:40] I'm not gonna preach on this but
[37:43] sometimes we can call
[37:46] ignoring things or pretending like it's
[37:49] not there sometimes we want to call that
[37:51] faith and that's not faith
[37:54] faith says you know what this is this is
[37:57] something as present that God will see
[38:00] me through that's faith think that just
[38:03] as brother Branham addressed it and how
[38:05] can overcome and these are statements
[38:08] within the message where brother Brown
[38:09] as a person says he said you might say I
[38:12] don't have cancer and he says no your
[38:16] doctor said you have cancer you have
[38:17] cancer but the years now where we
[38:20] balance it but remember the God in you
[38:24] is greater
[38:26] see we're not we're not ignoring we're
[38:30] not standing there like Joshua and Caleb
[38:31] saying you know Joshua and Caleb didn't
[38:33] say the 10 spies and say or you guys are
[38:36] faithless there ain't no Giants over
[38:38] there no no they said it's true there's
[38:40] giant but that's not the focus of our
[38:43] conversation
[38:44] we're not even gonna let that be the
[38:47] focus of our mind our focus is in God's
[38:50] promise a
[38:53] lot of things around us here in either
[38:56] way that could try to
[38:58] steal our focus and our emotions and our
[39:02] thoughts and a lot of things and things
[39:04] could try to pull us this way try to
[39:06] pull us this way this is why in this
[39:09] hour it is so necessary for spiritual
[39:13] discernment and I'm not gonna preach on
[39:15] that this morning but I just and I know
[39:17] every moment that I take up here to
[39:19] speak of these things somehow it gets
[39:21] counted against me I
[39:22] often Eve's brother Paul lefante and God
[39:25] bless your brother Josh and sister and
[39:27] Mariah I teased brother Paul because
[39:29] sometimes when we've ministered together
[39:31] of places and I maybe had the second
[39:33] service and someone lets me know say hey
[39:34] you only have about 45 minutes you know
[39:37] you can go as long as you want the 45
[39:39] minutes of people be with you and this
[39:41] and that and I told him I said well
[39:42] listen I said if I was as gifted his
[39:45] brother Paul I said I could preach and
[39:48] then go write a song and finish the
[39:49] sermon and it don't get counted against
[39:51] me you know so I would just tease and
[39:53] you know brother Paul on that part of it
[39:55] but maybe God will let me sing my sermon
[39:58] today
[39:59] but there's there's just a few points
[40:03] that we I want to address and reaffirm
[40:05] some things one thing that I want to
[40:08] mention I want to say that I really just
[40:12] appreciate the way that the Deacons and
[40:14] the ushers this has been very unusual
[40:17] and uncomfortable for them but I want to
[40:19] say that I appreciate the ways that
[40:21] they've taken things and and I know
[40:24] sometimes that they might get a little
[40:25] flak but I want to understand right here
[40:28] they they're here to serve and to help
[40:31] us
[40:32] that's what they're here for
[40:35] and
[40:38] their extensions they take the direction
[40:41] and many times with the brothers one
[40:43] thing I just so appreciate a lot of
[40:44] times they're already on things and God
[40:47] has helped us just to work with just a
[40:49] like mindedness and they'll take things
[40:51] that that I've mentioned and they have
[40:53] to go through and try to you know apply
[40:57] them and try to remind us so just I want
[41:00] you to please during this time and and
[41:03] if anything at all during all of this
[41:05] don't stop free not that you have but
[41:08] let's pray because I tell you you you
[41:12] know I look at this and I I certainly I
[41:15] don't want to continue on in the ways
[41:17] that we've had to do things
[41:19] you know I'm having my feelings but I'm
[41:22] not gonna eject my feelings hi I just
[41:24] wanted I don't want to do and direct my
[41:26] feelings and my thoughts or my opinions
[41:28] and we all have
[41:29] I said we all have them and that's the
[41:32] truth I mean you know we I just don't
[41:35] want to do that I think that would be
[41:38] really counterintuitive it would not be
[41:40] productive for what we really need to be
[41:43] focused on when we come here when one
[41:45] thing we're focused on and that is we
[41:48] want to hear from God we want to serve
[41:50] the Lord who want to worship Him so I
[41:52] want to remember that reminds you of
[41:54] this here there's a couple things right
[41:57] now first of all on that social
[41:59] distancing I'm gonna look around right
[42:01] now and I don't see that it you know
[42:04] well I'm not gonna say that out there
[42:05] but I just want you to be mindful of
[42:08] this because the Deacons right now we
[42:11] have already had together a complete
[42:13] seating chart and I know sometimes a
[42:17] person I don't sit here I usually sit
[42:19] here and I said here and I
[42:22] but during this time this is where we
[42:26] all have to be flexible
[42:28] I'm sure you get hungry enough you go to
[42:30] a restaurant you don't care if they I
[42:32] don't want a four I don't want a four
[42:34] top there's five of us I don't want to
[42:36] set on the end my knees will bump into
[42:38] that talking for me
[42:41] but if you're hungry enough you eat it
[42:43] you sit down let your knees bump in you
[42:46] know but what I wanted to say is we want
[42:50] you to be very mindful as a congregation
[42:52] of the maintaining of that social
[42:54] distance because one thing that I don't
[42:56] want to happen here we've worked there's
[42:58] been a lot of hours that's went into
[43:01] this from the beginning to make this
[43:04] possible to come back together I want to
[43:06] say that there's been different ones
[43:08] that they've been exposed to this
[43:11] throughout the time different ones God
[43:14] is healed raised up from a different
[43:16] other ones that God is healed and others
[43:19] that when they've come in contact with
[43:21] it they right away I appreciate their
[43:23] responsibility even though they want to
[43:25] be in the house of God they said you
[43:27] know what I'm gonna self quarantine and
[43:29] I appreciate that because that's even
[43:32] for all even for all of us and I
[43:34] appreciate them doing that and you might
[43:36] say brother Samuel is that fear no
[43:37] that's just being sensible
[43:39] it's just being sensible
[43:42] and you know I want you to I want to ask
[43:46] you to monitor these things let's not
[43:48] get
[43:50] relaxed you know within it I want us to
[43:53] rest I want us to have we have faith but
[43:56] not to just get we don't want to be
[43:57] careless
[43:59] during this also you know right now
[44:02] the masks they're mandatory in the
[44:04] county where we're at if you go out to
[44:06] eat after after service here you'll have
[44:10] to wear one I guess in the place you go
[44:13] I don't know you know I don't understand
[44:16] all of that part how you eat with the
[44:18] mask on where you take it - I don't
[44:19] understand that so once again I'm not
[44:21] putting I just we know that that Matt
[44:23] the mask that's mandatory for our County
[44:26] right now and it's just a reminder these
[44:28] things are temporary here in County I
[44:31] was looking at this last on Thursday
[44:33] here we I got some text here right as a
[44:37] few hours before before service and I'm
[44:40] writing the train of thought on things
[44:42] and I didn't know what had happened
[44:44] where we had to mask and this coming in
[44:47] and that coming in and like I said once
[44:48] again
[44:49] I'm not here to try to reason things out
[44:53] and is this a right and is this a bit I
[44:55] I'm not let's let's put that outside to
[44:58] talk
[44:59] because I can stand here with that and
[45:01] in any in any side as well I just the
[45:04] part of it is is that within it I just
[45:08] we want to follow the best the best that
[45:11] we can and I understand some people with
[45:13] the masks you're not able to do it with
[45:17] that that's all explained in the
[45:18] guidelines that we sent out I also
[45:21] understand if you're sitting here you
[45:23] know it might come a time
[45:24] those things you know it just you you
[45:28] get sold I don't know how you described
[45:31] it you know it just you're walking
[45:32] around with them and I see the people in
[45:34] the store the employees in the store
[45:36] pulling them down and and everything
[45:38] else you know and I
[45:41] understand there's debates on all of
[45:43] that and I'm not I'm not here to talk
[45:45] about the debates on those things with
[45:47] the masks and believe me I've watched a
[45:49] lot of different things on that but
[45:52] I'm sure probably you have to and so
[45:56] the thing is is I asked what I would ask
[45:59] you is is that even in this right here
[46:02] don't let your spirit become vexed one
[46:05] way or the other
[46:06] let your spirit just say Lord I just my
[46:10] focus is I just want to stay open before
[46:13] you and that's the thing that we don't
[46:15] want we don't want to do so as I was
[46:18] saying temporary you know the here in
[46:21] county they were on it when the governor
[46:23] first announced it then they came off of
[46:26] it within just within the weeks time so
[46:29] all these things a lot of it is
[46:31] temporary I'm asking that when we come
[46:35] back in I didn't want to send an email
[46:37] out there already we've typed a lot of
[46:41] those things throughout the times and
[46:42] I'll just be honest and I would like to
[46:44] see some of you become more aware and
[46:48] reading your email if you don't have an
[46:51] email
[46:52] and it's not submitted to us get it to
[46:55] us because I realize sometimes people
[46:57] have come and I can tell you having read
[46:59] your email I can tell by the questions I
[47:02] get now that's your responsibility
[47:07] don't worry my belt is still on I'm not
[47:10] I'm not swinging
[47:13] but that's your responsibility to read
[47:16] your emails keep up with what's going on
[47:18] the other part so with the mast part of
[47:20] it I'm asking that we would comply with
[47:23] that during this time and just the whole
[47:27] part of it the only one who doesn't have
[47:29] to wear it is he who's officiating the
[47:31] service so maybe I won't let nobody else
[47:33] preach no
[47:35] but we we try to keep your breast that
[47:38] you stay if you stay aware of it and if
[47:40] it happens during you come in here and
[47:42] you're wearing the mask and it gets too
[47:44] much for you look I'm not gonna sit here
[47:46] and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna walk
[47:48] around and say put your mask on pick it
[47:49] up the Deacons aren't gonna do that
[47:51] either we're just not we're not doing
[47:53] that I appreciate I want to say and
[47:56] around all the brothers and sisters
[47:57] that's been here that I haven't if
[48:01] you've had a question I appreciate you
[48:03] go go to the Richard go to brother Gomez
[48:05] you know I appreciate it we haven't got
[48:08] the people are frantic and hysterical
[48:11] about things I really appreciate that
[48:12] being not in that manner that's that's
[48:15] very appreciate when not being that way
[48:19] the other thing is so with the social
[48:22] distancing part just try to make sure
[48:25] you're not right now so we had the
[48:27] Deacons and the ushers they could go
[48:29] back to seating people I
[48:32] really don't want to have we were we
[48:34] don't want to have to do that
[48:36] but if we have to do it we'll do it so
[48:40] you just try to make sure it's like for
[48:42] example if I knew you know like we're
[48:45] brother Joey I come in and I see where
[48:47] he's setting well I know not to sit
[48:49] right behind me I
[48:50] love you but I know not to sit right
[48:54] behind him I know not to sit right in
[48:56] front of him I know to space out a
[48:57] little bit so even we have to we'll have
[49:00] to do that as best we can if you find it
[49:02] difficult then asked one of the Deacons
[49:04] say can you help me during this time
[49:06] because there's already been I know
[49:09] there's one one particular assembly that
[49:11] I know of and they had to go back to
[49:13] streaming for a few weeks because of
[49:16] some things and it just had kind of
[49:17] broke out through the church and there
[49:19] was a number of it and
[49:21] they've been able to resume so we want
[49:23] to try to be precautious during this
[49:26] time the other part is after the service
[49:31] we want you to exit the building I was
[49:34] in here even on Thursday night and
[49:35] trying to I don't want to say shoe but
[49:39] trying to get people out of out of the
[49:43] building and that kids and and
[49:45] everything else when we dismissed I
[49:47] understand if you have to go to the
[49:48] restroom go to the restroom and then go
[49:51] on out to the parking lot the church
[49:54] library the office back there off limits
[49:58] if you during this time just go on out
[50:02] because let me tell you what happens and
[50:03] that includes let me just go and make
[50:05] the announcement for everybody with the
[50:06] songs and things like that with probably
[50:08] the practicing of the songs you may need
[50:10] to kind of have to rearrange that at a
[50:12] different time because a number of these
[50:15] sisters many times we're out there
[50:17] standing and fellowshipping you've got a
[50:19] whole group of individuals that they're
[50:21] going through and they're wiping down
[50:23] every single speck of this sanctuary
[50:27] they're doing it they've put together
[50:30] where you couldn't get wipes they went
[50:32] ahead and made the wipes with where you
[50:34] how you make your own they did all of
[50:35] that and they so they're in here wiping
[50:38] all that down I appreciate that and so
[50:41] we
[50:45] you know I've there's nothing wrong with
[50:48] that at all you know it's just like you
[50:50] know you appreciate it you trust the
[50:51] people to restaurants making your food
[50:53] that they wash their hands
[50:55] right you care about that so we we want
[51:00] to be mindful of that
[51:05] so I just just ask that you please bear
[51:09] with us during that brother Richard is
[51:11] there anything else that you feel I need
[51:13] to
[51:15] everything was good
[51:22] yeah yeah yeah yeah
[51:25] right and yeah not to be out there
[51:28] congregate near the protocol let me just
[51:30] say this to you this is probably
[51:33] something maybe a little bit of a coming
[51:35] for a long time if I ask all of you when
[51:38] we come to the house of God why do we
[51:40] come here
[51:42] we come here to hear the word of God if
[51:46] we come here for any other purpose we're
[51:48] here for the wrong reason I want to see
[51:50] my brothers and sisters I want to
[51:52] fellowship with you but the first part
[51:53] is fellowship comes after the word
[51:57] so that means when we come here whether
[52:01] we're in pandemic or not
[52:03] that that out there we should not be
[52:06] sitting seated out there and having
[52:07] conversations out there
[52:10] everybody with me you say be friendly
[52:13] smile
[52:15] smile shows you're friendly if you frown
[52:18] you know just just smile you might you
[52:22] mind to practice it you might have to
[52:24] practice it like one country I was in
[52:27] and I told the one brother I said I was
[52:29] going through this security check and I
[52:31] you know I'm trying to lighten it up I
[52:32] said there wasn't nobody smiling I was
[52:36] gonna say something you know lighten it
[52:37] up but I know if they'd understand me
[52:38] but when I got to that country the
[52:41] brother said oh no no no he said they
[52:43] actually have billboards out I'm not
[52:45] gonna call the nationality but he said
[52:46] they actually have billboards out trying
[52:48] to show them how to smile it's a mind
[52:51] you know it's a very oppressive country
[52:53] that they're in you know and and I
[52:56] thought my goodness men you'd actually
[52:57] have to have a billboard to to do that
[53:00] but you know let's whether we're
[53:03] pandemic or not let me just say this
[53:05] when we come to the house of God we
[53:07] ought to be coming in here
[53:09] reading this is exactly the instructions
[53:12] of the Prophet gave us reading our Bible
[53:15] and pray
[53:18] you can't you you can't just all of a
[53:21] sudden switch gears and that's whether
[53:23] it's musicians or who it is you can't
[53:26] just put on a gear
[53:28] I can't just put on a gear and start
[53:29] preaching
[53:30] we all all of this here it's an
[53:33] investment
[53:34] how we invest within these services and
[53:38] I want to invest in it when we come to
[53:41] stand here there's an investment I want
[53:43] to invest everything I have for the
[53:45] moments that God has given us so just
[53:48] remember that whether we're in pandemic
[53:50] or not you know the bench that's out
[53:52] there if somebody has a need during a
[53:55] service in either time I know some have
[53:57] one out there and set because something
[53:58] you know physically during that time and
[54:02] that's that's been okay but otherwise I
[54:04] one thing that I don't think is it good
[54:07] is if we're sitting out there on that
[54:08] bench before service and we're
[54:10] fellowshiping wrong order I said the
[54:13] wrong order we hear the word come here
[54:16] to hear the word first we greet we can
[54:18] greet one another they god bless you and
[54:20] smile at one another and then let's get
[54:23] ourselves ready for service after
[54:26] service you said well brother Samuel
[54:27] I've got to go after service then maybe
[54:29] you need to make preparations and stick
[54:31] around after service so you can
[54:32] fellowship with people
[54:34] man I've got a preach after this
[54:38] well the dream will need help
[54:43] god is so good god
[54:45] is so good you don't want to I just want
[54:48] to encourage you because the things that
[54:51] God has tried to speak to our hearts
[54:54] here in these services we've been
[54:56] looking at God has taken us it's that we
[54:59] might have a balanced walk
[55:02] even during the midst of this time don't
[55:05] let your spirit get vexed with things
[55:07] there's a lot of things that convex you
[55:10] and get and what happens when it starts
[55:12] to vex you and you get into your beliefs
[55:14] what happens which you don't realize is
[55:16] you can look and say my that's so wrong
[55:18] and you get pulled to this side you also
[55:20] closed yourself off from visitation you
[55:24] want to be available
[55:26] be available know you know so
[55:31] ah nine
[55:33] well let's look in the word maybe we
[55:37] need to sing a song
[55:38] [Laughter]
[55:41] Alleluia maybe we need to sing a song
[55:46] let's sing that song amazing grace shall
[55:48] always be my song
[55:56] well I'm not gonna ask you if you love
[55:58] me I'll ask you at the end of service oh

[58:21] you Lord I thank you for your direction
[58:24] lord thank you for your leadership oh
[58:26] god we you're the focus you're the
[58:30] desire of our hearts and our lives
[58:32] Lord it's you then we just desire that
[58:37] our hearts would just be inclined to
[58:39] your voice lord
[58:42] help us lord I pray may you come and
[58:46] minister to the needs of your children
[58:49] Lord direct me O God this morning Lord
[58:52] may you speak very personal Lord to our
[58:56] hearts and our lives
[58:58] we just give ourselves to you now Lord
[59:03] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:05] amen
[59:07] amen
[59:10] praise the Lord psalms 118 let's go
[59:15] there if we could
[59:24] and I want to just begin reading at
[59:26] verse one
[59:39] all night all give thinks unto the Lord
[59:43] for he is good because his mercy
[59:47] endureth forever
[59:51] let Israel now say that His mercy
[59:55] endureth forever let the house of Aaron
[59:58] now say that his mercy endureth forever
[1:00:02] let them now that fear the Lord say that
[1:00:07] his mercy endureth forever could we just
[1:00:10] say that his mercy endureth forever
[1:00:15] verse five I called upon the Lord in
[1:00:19] distress the Lord answered me and set me
[1:00:24] in a large place
[1:00:28] the Lord is on my side I will not fear
[1:00:32] what can man do unto me
[1:00:36] the Lord taketh my part with them that
[1:00:41] helped me
[1:00:43] therefore shall I see my desire upon
[1:00:47] them that hate me
[1:00:48] it is better to trust in the Lord than
[1:00:51] to put confidence in man
[1:00:54] it is better to trust in the Lord than
[1:00:57] to put confidence in Princes notice
[1:01:00] those two verses
[1:01:02] it's better to put trust in the Lord and
[1:01:05] to put confidence in man it just has
[1:01:07] mankind and all in one level then the
[1:01:10] very next scripture says even if he's of
[1:01:13] a higher rank
[1:01:15] we don't put our confidence in flesh
[1:01:21] our confidence is in the Lord simply put
[1:01:24] if the doctor prescribes you medicine
[1:01:26] our confidence you've got to have
[1:01:28] confidence and what being sad in the
[1:01:30] medicine but our confidence is in the
[1:01:32] Lord
[1:01:34] God I take this in the name of the Lord
[1:01:37] Jesus you're my healer Lord
[1:01:40] is that right so this is where this is
[1:01:44] where we reside so may God bless you
[1:01:47] bless the reading of the word as you're
[1:01:48] being seated
[1:01:59] this scripture and this
[1:02:02] thoughts that we've been
[1:02:05] addressing of being under his care
[1:02:09] having stability in the midst of
[1:02:12] instability the scripture in verse five
[1:02:16] is where I want to just draw attention
[1:02:18] to for a few moments and we'll just see
[1:02:20] how far we get this morning
[1:02:23] but here is David I called upon the Lord
[1:02:27] in distress and that word distress it
[1:02:31] means to be like in a straight in a
[1:02:33] confined place
[1:02:35] in a difficult place
[1:02:38] and notice as he called unto the Lord in
[1:02:41] distress the Lord answered me and sent
[1:02:47] me in a large place
[1:02:50] he removed me from a place of a strait
[1:02:54] of difficulties he lifted me into a
[1:02:57] place that David says has great expanse
[1:02:59] it's broad it's wide
[1:03:03] now notice he lifted me he transported
[1:03:08] me he caught me up
[1:03:10] from where I was at
[1:03:13] into this place
[1:03:15] it says in the amplified bible dialect
[1:03:18] reading in the scripture here the same
[1:03:21] verse out of the amplified bible says
[1:03:23] out of my distress I called upon the
[1:03:25] Lord I may know that that's exactly what
[1:03:28] we need to do when we're in the midst of
[1:03:30] a time of distress we've only getting
[1:03:31] there's one Avenue call upon the Lord
[1:03:33] and we don't have to have good nuba
[1:03:35] calling upon God doesn't mean we have to
[1:03:37] have flowery words it just simply means
[1:03:39] I said lord I need help
[1:03:42] don't I need strength right now
[1:03:45] he hears beneath all of the vibration of
[1:03:51] our words he knows what we need out of
[1:03:54] our distress I called unto the Lord and
[1:03:57] the Lord answered me and set me free and
[1:04:02] in a large place
[1:04:06] I
[1:04:06] look at this term as we've been dealing
[1:04:09] with pressure worry anxiety all these
[1:04:11] things
[1:04:13] this term of distress it deals with
[1:04:17] extreme anxiety
[1:04:19] sorrow or pain
[1:04:23] and
[1:04:24] at the scripture as it comes to mind
[1:04:28] because within our being
[1:04:30] were we we live in a three-room house
[1:04:34] flesh
[1:04:36] spirit soul
[1:04:40] god brother brems says it like this and
[1:04:42] the message life is the healer he said
[1:04:46] God came down and took the full form of
[1:04:50] man that he might redeem the full form
[1:04:56] of man
[1:05:02] we recognize that in the redemption that
[1:05:05] God starts with the principal part in
[1:05:08] our life
[1:05:09] yes his word God comes and gets our
[1:05:13] attention
[1:05:13] our mind has to go towards that word and
[1:05:19] it begins to think it begins to
[1:05:21] entertain remember the the the Lord
[1:05:25] could not do anything with Mary until he
[1:05:27] first got her saddled from the troubling
[1:05:29] in her mind is that right brother Bram
[1:05:32] tells us he is we're taught in the
[1:05:35] message how that God he says you first
[1:05:39] of all he says you've got to open your
[1:05:41] mind and let the word in
[1:05:44] so you Lisa because that's what has life
[1:05:47] and he separates the difference between
[1:05:49] how Christian Science take it and the
[1:05:51] rest of him but he says we must open up
[1:05:54] our mind and let the word in because the
[1:05:56] word is that which has life in it
[1:05:59] so a person as you this is this is where
[1:06:03] it leads into a birth many times a
[1:06:06] person is looking and saying well I've
[1:06:08] been praying I I really need the Holy
[1:06:10] Ghost I I need this I need this
[1:06:12] deliverance you've got to let the word
[1:06:14] in because it's the word that's going to
[1:06:17] perform the promise of the word and the
[1:06:21] word is the person of Jesus Christ is
[1:06:24] that right jesus said I'm the way the
[1:06:26] truth and the life so you first must let
[1:06:28] the word in and the scripture said that
[1:06:30] the word is a seed so we take that word
[1:06:34] into our life into a bedding ground and
[1:06:36] we water it water that promise knowing
[1:06:40] that when God when God speaks personally
[1:06:43] to your heart and there's a longing do
[1:06:45] you realize it's a longing in your heart
[1:06:47] when something strikes your heart and
[1:06:49] says that's what I want Lord that's what
[1:06:52] I have need of whether it's healing
[1:06:54] deliverance the baptism of the Holy goes
[1:06:56] whatever whatever the need is the
[1:06:58] promise of God I want you to understand
[1:07:01] it's God spiritually stirring your heart
[1:07:04] and you God's letting you know you've
[1:07:07] got a right to ask for that but in
[1:07:10] asking for it you've got to have your
[1:07:12] mind it's got to be open to
[1:07:15] now within within this it's got to be
[1:07:19] set in the proper in the proper place
[1:07:21] and so all of these parts that we are a
[1:07:24] three room house when God contents ended
[1:07:27] he came down to deal and to bring
[1:07:31] Redemption to our soul and then from
[1:07:35] that redemption in our soul when that
[1:07:38] life has been changed then we walk in
[1:07:41] this life and we know that awaiting as
[1:07:45] Peter would say in the heavens is a body
[1:07:48] undefiled reserved we know we have
[1:07:52] representation in the heavenlies Paul
[1:07:54] would write and said if this earthly
[1:07:57] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one in
[1:07:59] the heavens already waiting what's he
[1:08:01] dealing with he's dealing not with this
[1:08:03] he's dealing with the spiritual part
[1:08:05] which is that theophany which our human
[1:08:09] spirit we trade that human spirit and we
[1:08:12] take on that theophany so her soul
[1:08:14] clothed in that theophany that spirit
[1:08:17] body not that come from this world and
[1:08:20] then we receive a glorified body which
[1:08:24] is a human body with eternal life
[1:08:28] not you know it wouldn't do us good
[1:08:30] enough just to go back and be young
[1:08:32] again
[1:08:33] why we still got the same problems we've
[1:08:37] got the same in situations there's good
[1:08:39] to come a change that goes beyond just
[1:08:42] the atoms of our bodies but it comes
[1:08:45] according to God's Way not according to
[1:08:48] how we came after the fall through sex
[1:08:51] it must come by the word the same way
[1:08:54] that the change comes in your soul it
[1:08:58] comes by the word of the Lord Jesus said
[1:09:00] when he breathed on him in John 20 he
[1:09:02] said
[1:09:03] receive you the Holy Ghost showing that
[1:09:06] man would be born of the inspiration of
[1:09:10] the Holy Ghost that comes through the
[1:09:12] word is that right jesus said the father
[1:09:16] will send the Holy Ghost in my name what
[1:09:20] is his name it is the word of
[1:09:23] revealed that reveals Jesus Christ to be
[1:09:26] the same yesterday today and forever so
[1:09:30] then the same God that moves and Express
[1:09:33] and he speaks and our soul our life has
[1:09:37] changed as we yield ourselves to the
[1:09:39] Lord just listen to me now be patient
[1:09:43] and look to God don't get all in a hurry
[1:09:46] and well I don't see this or I don't
[1:09:48] feel this just the Bible says wait on
[1:09:52] the Lord
[1:09:54] be of a good courage and he shall
[1:09:58] strengthen
[1:09:59] thy heart
[1:10:05] listen to me seed of Abraham if you
[1:10:07] don't see it today be looking for
[1:10:09] tomorrow
[1:10:11] if you don't see it at breakfast be
[1:10:14] looking for it at lunch
[1:10:16] if you don't see it at lunch say I'm
[1:10:18] waiting on it
[1:10:19] I'm gonna look for it they buy dinner
[1:10:22] dinner don't show up I'm gonna look up
[1:10:24] before before bedtime what is it we are
[1:10:27] people of a promise
[1:10:29] hallelujah that have a sure expectation
[1:10:34] so every promise is that way
[1:10:39] so the same God who would speak by his
[1:10:43] word and the life is changed soul is
[1:10:48] quicken it's the same God we're jug said
[1:10:51] he will come and I will answer
[1:10:56] job knew it would be the voice of God
[1:11:01] that would bring him from though joke
[1:11:03] the the skin worms devoured this body
[1:11:06] though it's long gone but God's voice
[1:11:09] what hell he brought me to himself he
[1:11:11] will bring me out of the grave
[1:11:16] so what is it if the the direction God
[1:11:21] bringing us to a completion to where our
[1:11:24] lives become word through and through
[1:11:27] soul
[1:11:30] the spirit that's theophany and then the
[1:11:33] body that's why brother Bram says this
[1:11:36] body he said just as your soul was born
[1:11:38] again this body's got to get born again
[1:11:41] but I'm grateful the same God who
[1:11:43] brought the new birth to my soul
[1:11:46] ties me back into my
[1:11:50] representation in the heavenlies
[1:11:53] Amen is the same one will change the
[1:11:56] atoms of this body
[1:11:59] so with that being said when we look at
[1:12:03] how that we are made up of
[1:12:06] soul spirit and body here we are
[1:12:10] many times you find brother Branham when
[1:12:13] they come on the prowl or up to the
[1:12:15] pulpit but the branch says oh it says I
[1:12:18] see you're a Christian he said I catch
[1:12:20] that he said that vibration in your
[1:12:21] spirit brother and I just heard him just
[1:12:24] just just yes and they were just
[1:12:26] yesterday and he's going through that he
[1:12:28] says look he says I catch that by their
[1:12:30] spirit what's the vibration of their
[1:12:32] spirit and the Bible says
[1:12:35] in proverbs 20:27 the spirit of man is
[1:12:40] the candle of the Lord
[1:12:46] I'm not going to ask you how many like
[1:12:48] can't I like candles
[1:12:50] the joy of my wife my wife says when she
[1:12:53] sends me to get candles you know what
[1:12:54] can I get I don't get kind of smell like
[1:12:56] flowers I get the kind of smell like
[1:12:58] cinnamon rolls
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:01] baked apple pie
[1:13:03] man that smells good
[1:13:06] but you know what the candle
[1:13:08] sometimes there could come a strong gust
[1:13:11] and could put that candle on
[1:13:15] it don't mean that it's not a candle it
[1:13:17] just means it got to get real it
[1:13:20] and see when brother Branham says I can
[1:13:22] tell by your spirit you're a Christian
[1:13:24] now the person in their spirit somehow
[1:13:28] that you know it doesn't change them
[1:13:31] from being a Christian they're not you
[1:13:33] know out there in the world it doesn't
[1:13:35] they they love the Lord but they need
[1:13:37] help in their spirit
[1:13:40] and I'm I can say this here as God came
[1:13:44] down to take upon the full form of man
[1:13:46] to redeem the full form of man he
[1:13:48] manifests himself his mercy endureth
[1:13:52] forever
[1:13:56] 2nd Timothy this these are things that I
[1:13:58] find how Paul would write let me just
[1:14:00] read a few places of this
[1:14:02] Paul would write the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:05] be with vice spirit grace be unto you a
[1:14:09] man and Philemon 1:25 the grace of our
[1:14:13] Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit
[1:14:18] Galatians 6:18 brethren the grace of our
[1:14:21] Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:25] he's writing to brethren normal is he
[1:14:29] with yeah he's with us he said he'd
[1:14:30] never leave us nor forsake us but here
[1:14:32] is just an admonition I want him to be
[1:14:35] with my spirit
[1:14:41] you know there's transitions of life
[1:14:44] we're in transition right now
[1:14:47] and there's transitions that's beyond
[1:14:50] things that we've had to make changes
[1:14:52] this or that or there's unexpected
[1:14:55] happenings there's things that's
[1:14:57] happened this year within the
[1:14:59] congregation and
[1:15:01] besides the pandemic that we never
[1:15:03] expected to happen
[1:15:05] let me just say this if this isn't we're
[1:15:08] not ignorant as believers that the
[1:15:11] things that are taking place have been
[1:15:13] laid out scripturally and God has sent
[1:15:17] to us a message not just to identify
[1:15:19] those things but first of all be able to
[1:15:23] come and direct us to a place of safety
[1:15:26] calling us out to himself that we might
[1:15:29] take shelter under the wings of Jehovah
[1:15:33] then as we're here in him we look and we
[1:15:37] see all those fearful sights that are
[1:15:40] coming but we have a rest I
[1:15:43] can face tomorrow not dread tomorrow
[1:15:47] face tomorrow
[1:15:49] why because he live and he said because
[1:15:52] I live you shall live also
[1:15:55] [Applause]
[1:15:59] just as surely God bless you my it's
[1:16:03] good to see you
[1:16:07] forgive me I just get so caught up
[1:16:11] it's really good to see you but a Dave
[1:16:14] it's good to see you too
[1:16:17] really really love brother really love
[1:16:20] them
[1:16:21] so even in even in the conditions of
[1:16:24] life you know there are certain things
[1:16:25] that are conditions of life that
[1:16:28] happened
[1:16:30] there's changes that take place in our
[1:16:32] bodies and our emotions we need the
[1:16:35] oversight of the holy spirit
[1:16:37] one thing I'm grateful when you read
[1:16:39] Psalms through 139 David said how
[1:16:43] precious and wonderful are thy thoughts
[1:16:45] concerning me they're too high for me he
[1:16:50] said thou knowest my uprising and my
[1:16:53] down City thou knowest my coming in and
[1:16:56] my going out and I I want my heart just
[1:16:59] to be our prayer to be like Solomon when
[1:17:02] Solomon what was placed before him of
[1:17:05] your going here you are coming to the
[1:17:07] throne and he sees all the
[1:17:09] responsibility look at the humility he
[1:17:11] doesn't say well I can do this I'm of
[1:17:13] the Kings lineage no he goes to God in
[1:17:16] prayer and under the sacrifice he said
[1:17:19] will you direct my coming in and my
[1:17:22] going out will you direct would be the
[1:17:26] all between be him who walks in the
[1:17:29] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:17:31] be the Alpha and Omega and the
[1:17:34] in-between in my life mold has shaped my
[1:17:37] character for your glory
[1:17:41] that's a seal coming and going
[1:17:46] he's asking for that
[1:17:48] what a comfort that is and to know this
[1:17:51] he's a faithful and
[1:17:54] merciful high priest who is touched by
[1:17:59] the feeling of our infirmities
[1:18:04] rule Branham here in the beginning of
[1:18:07] the message indictment he's talking
[1:18:10] about sister Hattie sister Edith you
[1:18:13] know how she was born I want you just to
[1:18:16] follow this here he says now Edith had
[1:18:20] his sister we know as a little girl
[1:18:21] that's been crippled up since she was a
[1:18:24] baby she's a woman now she's and she's
[1:18:26] in very bad shape about a year ago I
[1:18:28] went down there when she had her first
[1:18:30] spell and immediately I found what her
[1:18:32] trouble was by the help and grace of God
[1:18:35] now really what the trouble with the
[1:18:37] child she says she's setting her limbs
[1:18:40] are hit together she can't even move
[1:18:43] them apart it's because of the
[1:18:45] tremendous pressure on the nerve system
[1:18:47] but what it is there's nothing
[1:18:49] physically wrong with the child outside
[1:18:51] of the affliction of infantile paralysis
[1:18:54] when she was about six months old he
[1:18:57] said she screamed and cried all of her
[1:18:59] life and we prayed for for many years
[1:19:01] and she's been happy ever since until
[1:19:03] about a year ago and now
[1:19:06] it's really menopause in other words the
[1:19:10] changing of her life and her nerves are
[1:19:13] in such a tremendous condition and the
[1:19:16] little lady has got on her mind that
[1:19:19] she's dying she's just not going to live
[1:19:23] just from one hour to the other you know
[1:19:25] he says healthy strong women have
[1:19:27] terrible times sometimes have to take
[1:19:30] shots of hormone and go into the
[1:19:32] institution and take shock treatments
[1:19:34] and everything during that time look at
[1:19:36] this the human being has two changes of
[1:19:39] life
[1:19:42] I'm grateful than revealed word come to
[1:19:46] lead us through this
[1:19:51] the human being has two changes of life
[1:19:54] he said the change from a boy to a man
[1:19:57] from a girl to a woman about sixteen
[1:20:01] seventeen years old they get like a
[1:20:03] bunch of just fly-by-nights and if you
[1:20:05] can just suffer with them during that
[1:20:07] age notice suffer with them
[1:20:11] but it makes you want to just tell your
[1:20:13] mom and dad thank you thank you for
[1:20:17] suffering with me
[1:20:20] how do you suffer it comes by
[1:20:23] understanding
[1:20:24] in understanding doesn't mean you
[1:20:26] understand all the components and all
[1:20:28] the parts it's just like for young
[1:20:30] people brother Bram says right now he
[1:20:32] said if you went and spoke to your
[1:20:34] parents or grandparents about the
[1:20:37] temptations and tests you're going
[1:20:38] through he said or they told you their
[1:20:40] temptations from back then he said you
[1:20:42] would laugh because the temptations are
[1:20:45] so much more before us and present
[1:20:49] that's there but there's one thing that
[1:20:51] doesn't change
[1:20:52] no matter if it's lion bear or Goliath
[1:20:55] he's the same God
[1:20:59] it doesn't matter what form he come the
[1:21:02] Lord Jesus is the same
[1:21:07] so during that age he says now I got a
[1:21:10] daughter in that age right now Rebecca
[1:21:12] pray for and billy-oh every one of us we
[1:21:16] come through that little frantic age we
[1:21:19] must suffer with them realizing it's
[1:21:23] something that they have to go through
[1:21:27] Wow so look at this he never said well
[1:21:31] we'll just pray and get him out of it no
[1:21:33] no they've got to go through it there's
[1:21:35] certain things we've got to go through
[1:21:37] we can't just say we're going to escape
[1:21:39] this know some things we got to go
[1:21:40] through but I'm glad the Lord is on my
[1:21:44] side
[1:21:46] I'm glad I'm not
[1:21:50] I'm not alone I'm glad he's there with
[1:21:55] me
[1:21:57] he said now either this changing he says
[1:22:01] of the seven years every seven years
[1:22:03] your life changes now don't strive
[1:22:05] trying to do math in your mind figure
[1:22:06] with seven of my own every seven years
[1:22:09] your life
[1:22:10] changes so
[1:22:12] the seven times seven you see it makes
[1:22:15] it kind of hard and that's a complete
[1:22:17] change it bothers the women men usually
[1:22:20] get a kind of funny and carrying on
[1:22:22] during that time and sometimes leave
[1:22:24] their wives but women are unfertile
[1:22:27] after that and we go through that notice
[1:22:29] and we all go through that and we must
[1:22:31] remember that it's things that we must
[1:22:34] bear with one another and understand
[1:22:37] those things
[1:22:39] bearing with one another doesn't mean
[1:22:41] that it's easy for us
[1:22:44] it simply means that we're looking at
[1:22:47] the one they're going through it and no
[1:22:50] look many times in our being we want to
[1:22:53] just say this is not so this we're not
[1:22:55] gonna make this so this is not so in the
[1:22:58] name of Jesus Christ that doesn't make
[1:22:59] it go away there's certain parts and
[1:23:02] things in your life you must go through
[1:23:04] but he said I will be with you
[1:23:10] is that right
[1:23:12] it's just like how the enemy would want
[1:23:14] to come and try to bring fear for a
[1:23:16] woman going into childbirth barring God
[1:23:19] does not remove childbirth but he says
[1:23:21] I'll be with you
[1:23:23] got a promise of his word and these
[1:23:27] changes that come about understand what
[1:23:29] I'm saying now this is not we're not
[1:23:31] walking around here like well I guess
[1:23:33] this is gonna happen I gotta go through
[1:23:35] it that's not at all the way the Prophet
[1:23:37] is putting it he's letting us know do
[1:23:39] not look at it in an anticipation that
[1:23:43] brings anxiousness neither during the
[1:23:46] time tried to become anxious because
[1:23:49] this person's like this or this person's
[1:23:51] like this and what is he saying let's
[1:23:53] direct our focus to God
[1:24:05] and little Edith has gotten this
[1:24:07] condition she's lost much weight she
[1:24:08] looks bad I tell you some night listen
[1:24:11] this some night not all of you together
[1:24:14] but just a little trip down they set up
[1:24:16] with her all day and night a little trip
[1:24:18] down there from this Tabernacle and with
[1:24:20] the different Tabernacles the sister
[1:24:22] Tabernacles here some of you people go

[1:24:34] if no more than a little friendly visit
[1:24:38] brother Samuel we're on social

[1:24:43] things to our leverage
[1:24:45] preach brother Samuel I will we're on
[1:24:49] quarantine
[1:24:51] no this is part of the body when one

[1:25:02] do we call text
[1:25:04] we forget look what he says we include
[1:25:08] himself we forget that so easy you know
[1:25:10] and when it comes to our own home then
[1:25:12] we appreciate it we must remember others
[1:25:15] appreciated too and the Wright family
[1:25:18] I'm sure would appreciate that I know
[1:25:20] you would have done it if you hadn't
[1:25:22] knowed this condition existed but you
[1:25:24] didn't know it so therefore I was
[1:25:25] telling you this morning for it go and
[1:25:28] visit the Wright family and tried to
[1:25:30] cheer Edith up

[1:25:43] Edith looks she looks bad but look at
[1:25:46] her in the promise you look good

[1:26:35] through my trials and you want somebody
[1:26:38] for yours
[1:26:44] one of the things that bring some of the
[1:26:46] greatest distress and pressures and
[1:26:48] intentions like we've been looking at
[1:26:50] letting off the pressure one of the
[1:26:52] things that brings that so much is when
[1:26:54] we don't have a certainty of an ending
[1:26:57] point
[1:27:01] doctor how much longer it's getting
[1:27:04] better
[1:27:05] you're doing good he's getting better
[1:27:06] you're getting there well how far along
[1:27:09] on my getting there am I getting there
[1:27:11] how close am I getting there am I
[1:27:14] getting there right that's us
[1:27:18] that's us now I realize some there's
[1:27:21] some times when I look at things you
[1:27:23] know that years ago I could look at
[1:27:25] those things I think my you know I had
[1:27:27] it you know had no experience with those
[1:27:29] things but sometimes there's things that
[1:27:31] comes your way and you as you know you
[1:27:33] don't have any definitive of well right
[1:27:36] now it's over with and many times let me
[1:27:38] preach now many times this is where we
[1:27:41] lose the victory that God gives us
[1:27:44] this is why for the RAM would say over
[1:27:46] and over all that I could come and set
[1:27:47] up a tent and teach on divine healing
[1:27:49] because so many people after their
[1:27:51] prayed for they lose it because after a
[1:27:54] time they start looking at their
[1:27:56] symptoms when it's the very time you
[1:27:59] need to hold to the promise of God and
[1:28:01] say we have found the word I know I'm
[1:28:04] standing the promises man and we stand
[1:28:07] on that word devil you're not taking
[1:28:09] that from me
[1:28:13] this is why to hold the promises that
[1:28:16] God has already made real
[1:28:24] you know sometimes
[1:28:28] sometimes there's things
[1:28:33] that you run into that you come into
[1:28:36] sometimes the casting out sometimes as
[1:28:40] Paul deals with the casting down we as
[1:28:42] brother branham we were reading that
[1:28:43] last week at a great speller fought and
[1:28:45] he was dealing with how this is God's
[1:28:47] method God's Way cast him out when that
[1:28:49] when when an imagination comes against
[1:28:51] God's Word cast him out when Satan tries
[1:28:53] to stick up his head cast him out you
[1:28:55] know as he keeps on bringing that down
[1:28:56] in Scripture casting him out
[1:28:59] sometimes the casting of an hour can
[1:29:03] truly be is God can come through your
[1:29:06] husband your wife can sit there and pray
[1:29:08] for you
[1:29:10] hey they're anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:29:14] it can be a gifted man that can pray and
[1:29:17] cast that away
[1:29:20] sometimes the casting of it away it
[1:29:23] comes by the truth
[1:29:28] jesus said ye shall know the truth and
[1:29:33] the truth shall make you free
[1:29:36] think about last week David said in all
[1:29:39] those in the multitude of my thoughts in
[1:29:41] the disquieting thought so I think and
[1:29:43] get off on all these branches and these
[1:29:44] limbs and these things get all under
[1:29:45] twine that comforts didn't like my soul
[1:29:49] why you have to come you come back to
[1:29:52] the truth and when the clouds and the
[1:29:55] enemy wants to try to swirl and this and
[1:29:57] that when you come back to the truth
[1:30:05] it takes the radar screen and says oh
[1:30:07] these were stormy skies that a the man
[1:30:09] it's changed it's clear it's sunny now
[1:30:16] Brabham talks about this and I don't I'm
[1:30:18] a just refer to certain parts of this
[1:30:20] here we'll see here comes another a
[1:30:23] little sister into a situation
[1:30:26] just like what we read about in the
[1:30:28] message indictment
[1:30:30] but I'm say here come a little lady not
[1:30:32] long ago and saying that someone told
[1:30:34] her she had seven devils another person
[1:30:37] said she had only five
[1:30:39] that's that's confusion and she wanted
[1:30:43] to know where it where the four went
[1:30:44] poor woman plum gone nearly sat in the
[1:30:48] room taking off her stockings pulling
[1:30:50] her hair up in the chair said I haven't
[1:30:52] eaten for several days and I'm not going
[1:30:53] to eat till I find out what become of
[1:30:55] those Devils and said what are they
[1:30:57] names I don't know I I never know
[1:30:59] nothing about it said well one minister
[1:31:02] told me I had seven the other lady
[1:31:03] minister said I had five and there's two
[1:31:05] of them gone somewhere and she come and
[1:31:08] she stayed there for about two hours in
[1:31:10] the house until God began to speak and
[1:31:12] said lady listen you come from st. Louis

[1:31:28] lovely housekeeper she said that's right

[1:32:35] discernment of the spirit that comes by

[1:32:40] through sometimes we look at it
[1:32:41] situations it I don't know right now
[1:32:44] because it isn't about us if God gives
[1:32:47] an unction right then then God gives it

[1:33:40] house and I said kind of hungry she

[1:35:14] they came down and set this little woman
[1:35:16] free brother Graham said see all the
[1:35:20] pouring on of oil all the stomping
[1:35:23] kicking all the loud hollering wouldn't
[1:35:25] do a bit of good it's the truth that
[1:35:28] makes you free that's true
[1:35:34] how many's a witness of that
[1:35:38] it's a truth that makes you free
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:42] when perplexing Trucks another thing
[1:35:45] comes around but thanks be to God
[1:35:47] there's a truth that comes forth and
[1:35:50] truth sets you free
[1:35:55] this word has power in it
[1:35:58] [Applause]
[1:35:59] the devil can take this word and try to
[1:36:02] bring fear but when a God gets ahold of
[1:36:05] the Holy
[1:36:08] [Applause]
[1:36:16] Prophet said doom Devils are on the run
[1:36:21] true exposes him
[1:36:25] they come mighty God the same God that
[1:36:28] descended in this hour the angel of the
[1:36:31] Lord and took a little profit and he
[1:36:34] failed himself and spoke through that
[1:36:36] prophet and spoke this message to you
[1:36:39] and I in this hour God knew we would
[1:36:41] come through conditions in our life he
[1:36:44] knew sorrows he knew there and he said
[1:36:46] I'm not gonna keep him from you but I'll
[1:36:48] tell you what and your shepherd
[1:36:51] [Applause]
[1:36:58] my shepherd I shall not want he leadeth
[1:37:04] me
[1:37:08] thank God for the green pastures and
[1:37:10] thank God for the steel waters
[1:37:13] troubled waters it's hard to see your
[1:37:15] reflection but he brings you two skill
[1:37:17] waters still waters run deep and where
[1:37:21] there's stillness God speaks and you can
[1:37:23] see yourself
[1:37:25] who
[1:37:27] know repeated God
[1:37:32] whoo
[1:37:34] hallelujah
[1:37:46] pardon me I'm just trying to determine
[1:37:48] where I want to go here next they're
[1:37:51] gonna help me
[1:37:57] the Bible says in Philippians 4:6
[1:38:02] be careful for nothing that
[1:38:06] phrase means don't be anxious for
[1:38:09] nothing I
[1:38:13] realize
[1:38:15] we can say
[1:38:17] we could say to one another
[1:38:19] don't be anxious
[1:38:23] that don't do it it really just wait
[1:38:27] don't worry
[1:38:30] they don't do it but if I said brother
[1:38:33] just lay when you walk into that
[1:38:35] hospital and you walk into those room
[1:38:38] it's normal the Son of God has walked
[1:38:41] into that hospital and he said to you lo
[1:38:45] I am with thee always
[1:38:48] that's different his focus is not honest
[1:38:52] don't worry he's already focused on his
[1:38:54] worry he has to focus on the one who
[1:38:56] said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:38:58] you
[1:38:59] [Applause]
[1:39:01] hallelujah
[1:39:03] glory be to God be careful for nothing
[1:39:06] but in everything by prayer and
[1:39:09] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:39:12] requests be made known unto God and
[1:39:18] the peace of God which
[1:39:20] passeth all understanding
[1:39:24] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[1:39:27] Jesus Christ
[1:39:30] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[1:39:32] true whatsoever things are honest
[1:39:34] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[1:39:36] things are pure whatsoever things are
[1:39:38] lovely but but on the first part of it
[1:39:41] we just eliminated the news
[1:39:48] whatsoever things of good report if
[1:39:50] there be any virtue if there be any
[1:39:55] praise think on these
[1:39:57] things I
[1:40:01] want to get deeper in the love of God
[1:40:05] but the Branham asks a question how do
[1:40:07] we get deeper in the love of God he said
[1:40:09] pray and read your Bible
[1:40:13] we've got Bibles we've got apps we've
[1:40:16] got on and on
[1:40:23] and don't make prayer and anxious thing
[1:40:26] either
[1:40:27] I'm just preaching as he's delivering
[1:40:31] don't become anxious about I've got to
[1:40:34] get home I got
[1:40:36] why wait till you get home pray while
[1:40:39] you're in your way
[1:40:42] prayer isn't about a list you've got a
[1:40:44] complete
[1:40:46] sometimes with with with with praying
[1:40:50] sometimes the needs mount up a night you
[1:40:52] know have needs come from here is this
[1:40:55] comes in on a text it isn't even from
[1:40:57] the assembly and this comes pray for
[1:40:58] this brother this situation it is and
[1:41:00] this and I'm thinking there's enough
[1:41:03] needs right here I honestly I feel like
[1:41:06] God I need to just have a notebook just
[1:41:08] wrote down
[1:41:10] sometimes brother really I just grabbed
[1:41:12] the the phone directory
[1:41:15] if it went up to date others got
[1:41:17] blessings as well
[1:41:19] but sometimes grammars say God but
[1:41:22] there's other times you know it comes to
[1:41:24] you but the thing of it is brother
[1:41:25] Carlos you don't have to wait till I'm
[1:41:26] in prayer it's even when it comes to
[1:41:29] your heart
[1:41:31] don't let it be a tradition just as it
[1:41:35] comes to your heart you might say oh no
[1:41:37] I forgot to pray for songs or if it just
[1:41:39] come to your mind well I'm just getting
[1:41:40] ready to step out the door to walk in
[1:41:42] the Bursar's door just by your hand
[1:41:43] saying Lord be with brother sister
[1:41:45] so-and-so and go on
[1:41:49] don't let prayer become anxious
[1:41:54] the Bible said pray without ceasing
[1:42:01] this is what a key inviting the peace of
[1:42:04] God that will keep our hearts and our
[1:42:06] minds it affects even the things that
[1:42:09] we're thinking because many times the
[1:42:12] things some of you medical people you
[1:42:14] understand this and a lot of the things
[1:42:16] that I've studied and had to take
[1:42:18] different things on that then when you
[1:42:20] look at anxiety and things with teaching
[1:42:22] and so forth many of the things that
[1:42:25] that they wanted they want to deal with
[1:42:26] they want to hand people and I'm gonna
[1:42:28] to understand me I'm not against this
[1:42:29] somebody taking this prescription or
[1:42:32] that but really when you get down to it
[1:42:34] there's certain nutrients that a
[1:42:35] person's lacking
[1:42:38] one of the key and this is not a health
[1:42:40] class but one of the keys is potassium
[1:42:41] and salt
[1:42:43] people aren't taking in certain things
[1:42:45] so there's no transport that actually
[1:42:48] helps even the firing in the brain and
[1:42:51] what happens the enemy gets on it gets
[1:42:54] them in that and then they're they'll
[1:42:55] run to certain things oh my goodness I I
[1:42:57] feel bad huh I need you know what I need
[1:43:00] right now I need a Big Mac a Big Mac Oh
[1:43:01] help me right now and what is it doing
[1:43:04] it just doesn't more harm what does that
[1:43:06] see ants how the enemy wants to work he
[1:43:08] wants to try to work let me just tell
[1:43:10] you when God redeemed you he redeems you
[1:43:12] to work through you he said be ye
[1:43:15] witnesses of me
[1:43:18] all of us come into the suite you come
[1:43:21] in two times sometimes some of you maybe
[1:43:23] deal with it a little bit more than
[1:43:25] others
[1:43:28] let me just say to you like this
[1:43:32] don't add an addition on to your home
[1:43:35] for anxiety
[1:43:37] is that okay don't say well you know
[1:43:41] what we were maybe we'll just give
[1:43:43] anxiety the master bedroom and we'll
[1:43:45] move over to here whatever you call it
[1:43:46] now we'll just move on over here
[1:43:49] we don't want to make admissions
[1:43:52] the Bible said give no place to the
[1:43:55] devil
[1:43:56] [Applause]
[1:44:00] and I think in the time that we're
[1:44:02] living in I don't know if you just read
[1:44:04] the article here this week one of the
[1:44:06] said CEOs at the Cleveland Clinic one of
[1:44:09] the things that they've been dealing
[1:44:10] with is that from cardiomyopathy broken
[1:44:12] heart syndrome
[1:44:14] people dealing with pressures and
[1:44:16] stresses from this time I
[1:44:20] understand we've got the scripture men's
[1:44:22] hearts are failing for fear we
[1:44:24] understand that part of it you and I are
[1:44:28] not exempt from feeling the stresses and
[1:44:31] the pressures we have loved ones
[1:44:32] different ones that's went through it
[1:44:34] even here in the assembly that's why we
[1:44:37] need a God with skin on it
[1:44:41] we need his help in his direction in
[1:44:44] this time
[1:44:48] let me just say this very
[1:44:52] there's things that there's things
[1:44:54] sometimes you deal with you might get
[1:44:56] fluttering or you might seem like mine
[1:44:58] why don't I saw intenser why don't worry
[1:45:00] my sayings that exactly sometimes you
[1:45:02] feel like you know why or let's go to
[1:45:03] bed I'll just get out on the other side
[1:45:04] and get up to
[1:45:08] know something what should I do I call
[1:45:11] on the Lord out of the stress
[1:45:15] help me
[1:45:18] help me
[1:45:21] and he answered me
[1:45:27] and he set me free and in a large place
[1:45:34] you're in the place of refuge a strong
[1:45:39] town a place where the pressure
[1:45:42] you can release it you get pressured but
[1:45:46] you've got a place where you can
[1:45:51] sometimes it sounds stronger than other
[1:45:53] time but you got a place you can release
[1:46:04] remember it was what Adam listen we
[1:46:07] understand the spiritual part that Adam
[1:46:10] and Eve but it's the part
[1:46:14] when they fed on the wrong thing
[1:46:19] they realized they were naked
[1:46:22] you with me now they begin to feed on
[1:46:25] the wrong thing and it brought fear if
[1:46:29] you go to feeding on the wrong things
[1:46:32] listen to me there is no Marvel we are
[1:46:34] still in this humanity
[1:46:37] it's brother branham would sell us over
[1:46:39] and over you hear him in the prayer line
[1:46:41] Satan I know you're more than a match
[1:46:44] for me but you're not more than a match
[1:46:46] for the one I represent
[1:46:49] see it's where the focus is at but if
[1:46:53] we're feeding feeding on the wrong
[1:46:55] things entertaining the wrong things
[1:46:57] what happens it's removing us from
[1:46:59] focusing on our garment our clothing
[1:47:02] it's under the blood greater is He that
[1:47:05] is in you than he that's in the world
[1:47:12] we're living in an hour so how to be
[1:47:14] here even
[1:47:16] have a greater focus and setting aside
[1:47:19] your time getting into the word doesn't
[1:47:23] mean you have to study like a minister
[1:47:24] so we're talking about

[1:50:23] letting Satan put one over on you your
[1:50:27] dream proved that there's nothing wrong

[1:51:05] thing you're all fussing and going on
[1:51:07] and one member of the family gets kind
[1:51:09] of upset about something it upsets the
[1:51:11] other and the other and the other and
[1:51:13] the first thing you know the whole
[1:51:14] family's upset

[1:51:22] rejoices let the rest of them rejoice
[1:51:25] with it so every one of the family try
[1:51:27] to do that did you catch what he's

[1:53:35] scripture in the Bible will judge me too
[1:53:37] let's see I'm gonna know hey the
[1:53:39] obstacles gonna beat them back Sam
[1:53:41] Donovan said mmm ox cool
[1:53:45] how many how many were coming oh
[1:53:48] I don't know about that did Sonny it's
[1:53:51] not even a weapon
[1:53:53] but the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:53:56] carnal but
[1:53:59] they're mighty through God to the
[1:54:02] pulling down of strongholds
[1:54:07] who would have thought the jawbone of an
[1:54:09] ass
[1:54:10] hood would have wiped out an entire
[1:54:13] Philistine army it wasn't the Ox code or
[1:54:16] the job of an ass it was a man yielded
[1:54:20] to God
[1:54:24] and that's what the message from the
[1:54:26] throw from the lamb come to let us know
[1:54:29] in this hour yield yourselves unto God
[1:54:32] as the prophet said it wasn't I who saw
[1:54:35] the visions it was an I who did these
[1:54:37] things I just happened to be standing
[1:54:38] present when he did it oh
[1:54:41] I love that let stamina
[1:54:50] try each one of you children to help
[1:54:52] Papa and Mama out Papa you try to help
[1:54:55] the children we need one another
[1:54:58] in the truth out of the mouths of babes
[1:55:00] you have perfected praise hey don't let
[1:55:04] that gloomy unbelieving spirit get
[1:55:07] around you you are Christian
[1:55:10] brother Branson when that gloomy spirit
[1:55:12] would get around Abraham whatever
[1:55:14] brother I'm saying good as never he
[1:55:15] say you take out your sword and you chop
[1:55:17] at that thing if you watch the words he
[1:55:19] says and greatest battle ever fought
[1:55:21] chop that it chop that it chop then he
[1:55:22] keeps on coming through the message why
[1:55:24] because sometimes one doesn't fall the
[1:55:25] first time you chop at it
[1:55:28] don't you ever disbelieve your weapon
[1:55:32] shop that then fall chop at it again why
[1:55:36] cuz the word has never no I
[1:55:41] said the word has never lost
[1:55:44] [Applause]
[1:55:46] when somebody let it go they lost but
[1:55:49] the word never lost gotta raise somebody
[1:55:51] up else up and say here take this word
[1:55:54] and they have confidence in the Living
[1:55:56] God then when they swing that it's not
[1:55:58] them swinging it's God directing their
[1:56:04] little errand this trying to help out
[1:56:08] right
[1:56:11] from
[1:56:14] the rest them hey I don't mean to call
[1:56:17] you out but you don't understand oh the
[1:56:19] rest of it was just saying is children
