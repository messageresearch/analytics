mindful heard that small steel boys you know as the brother comes this is me let's give a song give me Jesus in the morning let's sing this with all our hearts [Music] it no more [Music] god bless you this morning why you know how to worship over here I thought the North was cold and starchy but you guys must be from down south moved up this way or something yes wow this is good atmosphere to come into and and my sister Rosa and that was that was something right there and you know I know not to embarrass you but but that was anointed now you really set the bar for me having to preach now following that god bless you and greet you on the name of the Lord and I guess if you just want to have your seats we'll just take a minute to to do that to greet you I you know I don't go out a whole lot and preach I just feel called at home they're helping brother Paul in the local body and I heard brother Branham say one time he said you know every minister knows that when you go out somewhere he said you just talked to the people a little bit to help break the ice and get to know one another so you know so I'm not very experienced than that but you know I have been here before about I don't know maybe a year ago or so and I remember telling brother Sam I said brother Sam you got a well oiled machine over there said it's it's working fine the people were sweet and very greeting and you know last time I don't think I got to tell you the last time cuz I don't I don't think if I'm remembering correctly we did announce it yeah back home but my wife couldn't be with me because we found out she was pregnant and we were having some complications and she was sick and things and just couldn't make the drive and seven months old now baby boy I got my boy so we're very happy for that it's quite the trial my my wife was put on bed rest for I don't know maybe the last three months of it I can't remember so it was just real hard on her especially but but he came and the Lord helped us get to the hospital in time we arrived an hour later he was born so he was he the Lord just held him off and the the Midwife was actually driving behind me and and you know I had her cell phone and she called me and she said where are you and I said I'm passing the exit whatever exit this was and she goes okay I think I'm behind you and after we got to the hospital and and he had been born and everything she said I was watching you she said if you pulled over I was pulling over with you and we were gonna have that baby on the side of the road and I said well thank the Lord we all made it here but unfortunately my I had a little one that was sick last weekend and then kind of came came up with it again Thursday and so we just my wife just wasn't sure up until even last night she was really wanting to be here and meet you all and be here with me but just just felt to keep the little ones home and and let them kind of recoup and things so I apologize they're not here but give you greetings from them and that brother Paul and the church back home and just pray we could be a blessing to you today often think of myself a little bit like like Ally Hugh and if you know the story of job he was just this young man fourth guy that shows up you know we know Joe's three accusers or you know as so-called friends you know that we're putting him down and all of a sudden this fourth guy shows up and he's just this young young kid you know but he says listen he says if if God could be upon you in the spirit he said he can be upon me too so I'm just trusting that's where my trust is this morning not my own abilities because I I know I'm the least among the preachers and amongst you and everything else so I just believe that the Lord will be with us here so let's turn to the word if you want to stand and open with me to Matthew 24 last time we were here we spoke on brotherly kindness I'm sorry that's my title today statue of a perfect man we spoke on temperance and it was just something that the Lord I heard a message that Donnie Regan's preached a long time ago a couple years back now on on charity and it just so moved my heart and and so I just started looking at that and then I thought Lord was the starting point you know IFIF I'm gonna bring something like this to our local body where's the starting point for divine love and he just seemed to say you know I don't even know how he led me to this it was just I was reading them the message statue of a perfect man I guess and he said that's that's where you start so that's where we're gonna start today and speak on brotherly kindness so just bear with me as we lay a foundation here but Matthew 24 and verse 9 says then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake I want you to catch in these scriptures the spirit here though hate you and they'll kill you and then shall many of many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold so just catch the condition here of betrayal and hatred so much to a point that they would kill if they had the opportunity they would physically kill but you know we have laws and things in place here in this country and we're very blessed in that way but they'll kill you in another way they'll kill your influence they'll kill your example they'll kill everything that that just run you down and that and that's another form of killing and and he says in verse 13 but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come let's just ask the Lord bless the word here father we come before you in Lord you just moved mightily God in the song service Lord and I know father I heard the prophets say a couple times here in the recent past Lord that the the singing would go before the the soldiers in battle when they're on their way to war and he said that's why we have song service at the beginning is because we're marching into battle and then the word comes and so father your people have done God just I'm very impressed Lord at the worship here this morning father and and I truly mean it God I could see Lord them worshiping with all of their hearts Lord sister Roseanne given that special with all of her heart God and now I'm asking you to help me preach with all of my heart Lord speak to this people God no doubt father they didn't come Lord to hear me they came to hear from you and they're hungry to hear your word help me to bring it now get out of the way and we pray Lord for brother Sam father ministering out and Bluffton I just ask you to give him strength and that you would give him traveling mercies Lord and that you would bless the meeting there Lord we love our pastors God God called men in our lives and we just pray for him now and ask that you bless him in Jesus name Amen amen you can be seated I know I said it last time too but I so appreciate what you've done for your pastor there in his office you know I've seen the office my pastor has had before and and you know it's just such a blessing to him maybe you don't know how much a blessing but I thank you for treating him that way I heard this recently in investments brother Branham says and you don't you don't say it to be mean you say it for love people has got all things mixed up thinking love is just some little puppy dog something he says love is straight god is love God rebukes and Chasen's because of love I hope that soaks just as deep as I tended to do see that it's love that corrects it's love that's corrective and genuine love will stand correction and you know it's it's difficult to start to speak on love because I don't know if you've ever read the the 11th commandment here is a little book somebody put out you know brother Branham and it's just beautiful the things he says but in there he says you know many many poets and many songwriters and many preachers have tried to explain what love is what God's love is and he said we cannot do it as mortals we can't we have no understanding of that but you know it's it's I believe that you know we know God by his nature and by his characteristics and the things that he does we can recognize God in that and so I believe that we can recognize what divine love is by its nature and and and you know the this world this age of laodicea has got it so mixed up they all claim to have love and to claim they know what love is and yet it's it's a perversion of love it's it's a it's a lustful love there's different levels of love and this this age of laodicea has has a has just has a lust on it and they call it love but Roman says that God's going to give him over to a reprobate mind and he says that they'll they'll have vile affection and and and they'll think that it's real love but they do things that aren't natural it's it's it's not a natural love it's not the love of God but it can get it can become so confusing because it looks so good and it sounds so good in it and it seems so real and it seems like you know it's it's just become a you know many many of you know the the Planet Fitness you know they just kind of blew up everywhere and there's there's a statement in there I guess that says judge you know it's a judgment-free zone and and that's the thing that this world has its you could you could wrap it up in that saying is this is judgment free don't judge me don't don't do this don't do that and and you know I just been a little reluctant because I just had just believed it was the Lord I just started just interested in something I heard years ago about I think it was Ambercrombie and Fitch and if if you wear Ambercrombie and Fitch don't don't don't be a this morning I'm just going back and looking at a little history here but you know they're their slogan back at a certain time was was and forgive me I just hope this is okay to say but if you don't believe that there's a spirit behind fashion this will prove it to you their slogan was was is to be sexy their their their target audience was that was the preppy and the ones who could put on their clothing and be transformed into something that was that was had sex appeal to it and and and it just it was just a big big huge I don't know what else to call it besides a big huge lust fest I mean that's all as it was you couldn't even walk through the mall without you know their big posters and I didn't realize this but when you if you went into the store they had greeters that were shirtless and and it was just all kinds of just just sin and and and just filth in it but that was that was what appealed to the young people that was what appealed to the generations but now they had to kind of switch that back in about 2014 I think it was they had to kind of switch their approach because they said you can get sex anywhere you can go out and you could see things that are sexy anywhere so they said it's it's it's they're gonna approach it that it's sex but it's but it's more than that it's sex plus they said is this okay this morning forgive me I just I'm just trying to lay a foundation here because because the love of God is so different it's so it's so much different than that it's it's holy and it's and it's got its place in marriage but nowadays you can you know you can just have quick access to anything you don't have to wait for marriage that's just the way Satan has set it up but so they go along and in this history and and they change the CEO because they realized that this is no longer selling this way we need to change our approach and so they change it from from now it's now sex plus they got a it needs to be inclusive it needs to fit the the direction of the age and that was 2014 2015 was when they legalized same-sex and you can watch this spirit moving this fashion this fashion world in this direction and and you know it's just it's just filth but but now they they they tone back on it and and it's and it's so that you can you can you can choose your orientation you can you can choose it's just it's just perverted but God's love is so different from that God's love is yeah okay sure come into the house of God I'll accept you come into the house of God I'll accept your sacrifice but there better be a sacrifice and I expect change I'm not going to leave you in homosexuality I'm not going to leave you in your sin I want to change you because I'm after something I'm after a people that I want to reflect myself through and that's what I want to change you into it's not this just you got to accept me as I am God okay we give them that come as you are come and see come and see what we have but you will be changed you have to be changed you're either going to go out of these doors were so you're gonna be closer to God there's only two ways that's not staying still it's not going to be stay as you are I'm driving this home and I don't know why but you get you've got to leave change God wants you to change can you say Amen it's a it's a selfish love it's a self pleasing love but Jesus's own words says that because iniquity shall abound and we see that it's iniquity because iniquity abound the love of many waxes cold they don't they don't know what love is really in their hearts if you don't accept them they hate you and they want it they want to wipe you out that's not love that's not love the love of many shall wax cold why am I saying all this because it's the spirit of the age and if we're not careful that spirit can come in amongst us and I'm not talking that maybe necessarily we we get lustful or that we go off in in some sin or something though though we can the spirit of the age can affect us that way can you say men but the love of many shall wax cold and if we're not careful that will come into our ranks and I love for one another starts to wax over we become common to one another we we start not really caring about one another we're talking this morning on brotherly kindness and and brotherly kindness the Prophet said I'm all over my notes so I'm just gonna stay back from them for a minute the Prophet says that brotherly kindness is is put yourself in their shoes on the matter brotherly kindness is putting yourself in their shoes that you might understand brother Branham said that when when he preached or when he prays for the sick he says the success of me praying for the sick the reason that they're healed is he said because I can put myself in their shoes because I can I can feel for the people and and if you want results when you're praying put yourself in their shoes if they're sick amongst us this morning and you know it you you all know I don't know I don't know the needs and the in the congregation which you all know them if somebody's sick this morning put yourself in their shoes and pray for them listen you have the power within you to drive out cancer you have the power within you to drive out diabetes to drive out depression if you're depressed this morning you don't have to be that way if you know somebody's depressed maybe they're not here this morning because you know that they're depressed you you individually every one of you has the power to drive those spirits out all's you got to do is pray the prayer of faith and put yourself in their shoes when you put yourself in their shoes you can love like like no one else can love you can you can see it from their perspective my let me catch myself here you know it's interesting another thing just that that can wax our love cold for one another especially in a local assembly is being common to one another you sojourned for years with each other and you start to learn one another's weaknesses and those weaknesses instead of realizing that you have weaknesses - you'll capitalize on those weaknesses you'll focus on them and then after a while you start getting a little funny feeling towards that person and then you just don't want to be around them anymore but it's easy and and you know we'll have new ones come in amongst us and and we should flock to them we should make them feel welcome we shouldn't we should invite them over and go out to eat in things with them and enjoy getting to know them but I'm talking about an imbalance when the new ones come in and you say well I'm gonna go over here because I'm just tired of the old I'm tired of the relationships that I have there's too much strain I don't want to go back and try to repair that so I'm gonna I'm gonna gravitate over to these new ones now if you're new here this morning this isn't to make you feel bad I'm speaking of the ones who have been here for a while you just you just enjoy yourself but just know that after a while watch yourself that you don't take on the same approach that you get to know these ones so you just don't like that about that brother I don't like that about that sister come on somebody we're in a body of Christ and and we should have all things in common we should have unity but but the Prophet said Satan is continually punching at us he's always trying to get in he doesn't listen you got a beautiful thing here Saint gonna let that stay that way he's gonna fight you tooth-and-nail every step of the way and and if you feel this morning that you've been mistreated and and and you've backed off a little bit because of that let me encourage you to put that behind you let me encourage you to put yourself quit wallowing in your pain and I say that with the utmost love I just don't know how to say it don't don't wallow in it and and and start thinking about somebody else it'll help you I promise it will help you get your eyes off of your own pain get your eyes off of your problem is this helping somebody this morning and and start thinking about somebody else look for a way to show them that you love them do good to those who despitefully use you pray for them the Bible says it's his tall order friends but but these are the promises of God this is the life that he expects from us this is the life that he's wanting to reflect through us can you say Amen we can have unrealistic expectations of one another we really can I think it's because because we we've been given the truth that we have and we have the opening of the word and so we we come to expect a certain level of standard with that and I and I think that that's a good thing I think we should we should expect of ourselves especially to have a certain standard because because this is what God requires a holy life and it's incentive ocation but know though that you can't live that life in yourself you have to have the grace of God to live that in you if you don't understand something in the Word of God don't throw it out don't don't get so beat down and let the enemy just just put you in turmoil over it give it to God God has to do that through you if you if you you know and so often we can look at older ones and and who have been around awhile and we say man I just I do this all the time I want to be like that brother I want to have that kind of life I want I want to live so close as brother branham said that I'm so sensitive to his Holy Spirit I heard somebody and I don't remember where I heard it they said I think it was brother Eddie Driscoll and they were they were walking and they were taking these the the garbage totes out to the road any and he said the wind kind of blew by and he said brother Eddie just stopped and the any he said you know he said brother Branham was so sensitive to the Holy Spirit that if just a little breeze would come and touch the back of his neck he would stop and say is that you Lord I want to live that sensitive I want a relationship like that and I believe that we can I don't believe that it's a far out of our reach I believe that if there's a deep that calls to the deep within your heart that says come up higher then there is a higher place for you to live don't let it get you down but just know and keep pressing for the mark of the high calling in Christ can you say Amen is this helping you this morning you know just one last comment and then I'll and then I will move on here but you know relationships that are new maybe you went to camp for the young people and you met some some new young people and it's easier I've seen it before it's easier to to create a friendship with those and it's easier to create a friendship with those who who maybe are at work and who are outside the local body and you'll hear sometimes people say you know I don't have any friends at church or I don't feel like I belong there or something along those lines but it's because relationship is work it's hard work it's reconciling it's it's paying a price laying down things that have hurt you and laying down your own pride and and and it takes hard work can you say Amen so second Peter chapter one and verse five and he says and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity now I don't know if I showed it last time or if you've seen it before but I was noticed in the pyramids here that are these are these are beautiful by the way I love those and at the top of it is charity but right before you hit charity it's brotherly kindness and you watch the holy spirit throughout the scripture and he'll put things in such an order and when you start studying man and God and the Holy Spirit reveals him you realize there's an absolute order to this God knew what he was doing when he had the right or right this this way because you want you look at you look at brotherly kindness and then I've gone into into charity there in first Corinthians 13 and and long-suffering and you realized that I mean it has to sit on this foundation of putting yourself in one another's shoes I don't I don't it just it's so perfect I just I just love the Lord it's just perfect now I want to read you a couple quotes here and I realize you know I'm coming in and I'm trying to preach this where you know it's just will try to fit it in and not read too much but brother Branham said and humble thyself now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in that and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you don't let no malice come in malice one of the definitions of that is a funny feeling and we're gonna emphasize that this morning is a funny feeling don't leaven that never let no malice come in you no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex around a complex against that person see you be sweet and kind remember God loved you when you were in sin and if the Spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he's in wrong see just pray for them and love one another earlier in there he says he says just talk sweet and be real sweet to him - against our nature isn't it above everything love God and love one another when they asked Christ they said what's the greatest of the commandments What did he say love God and love one another because if you love right where the venom says this he says I will tell you this my friends when the love of God comes into your heart you won't go around hurting or being hurt you won't go around hurting or being hurt when you love right you live right you you there just when you love it just brings a faith about it that you you have faith in that person you realize that you know they don't they don't really I don't believe that that brother or sister I don't believe that they really mean me harm I don't believe that they would do that if they if they were thinking right maybe they're just having a bad day give them the benefit of the doubt maybe they're just having a bad day and we all could have do you all have bad days amen maybe maybe a family member sick can they and they just haven't shared that with you yet maybe something is going on see what I'm saying put yourself in one another's shoes have grace for one another love one another and be humble above everything love God love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless us and it's hard telling what he will do usually when a church begins to get in numbers and get getting a little bigger or something like that then they get away from the real thing and then he says it again the real thing a little bit further down and I just want you to catch this okay when we had the tent meetings just across the street a tent that seated about 2,500 people ministers come from everywhere and said brother come here a minute he said I was just a boy just a kid and he said how do you keep those people in one Accord they love one another told I haven't seen people love one another that's the Lord that's what this church was established upon that godly brotherly love for one another I seen them even shake hands with one another leaving the place and cry like babies to leave one another they love one another that well and you know I remember interjecting here you know sometimes we look around at each other and I don't know if you have these problems I just this is what the Lord laid on my heart you know you look around at one another and you think that'll never happen in our church you may think that but it can it can it absolutely can friends God wouldn't say these things and and and kind of hang the carrot way out there that you'll never attain to and just make you continue running after it eventually you're gonna catch the carrot God's gonna do it in our myths God's going to do it amongst the body of Christ around the world we're going to come into this kind of love I believe that with all of my heart because friends when he when the Prophet went beyond the curtain of time the angel of the Lord said only love can enter here only love it's it's you only take love and your character with you and it's out of divine love for one another you're gonna spend eternity with one another now down down the road but but you can have this now it starts here can you say Amen I believe it starts here and let me just let me just skip this here and I just summarize it here for you a little bit let's catch this he says further down let not that spirit ever depart from this place if it ever does that I don't care how eloquent your pastor might be how well he might bring the Word of God the spirit of God has grieved away when you don't have this spirit of charity working among you he says I don't care the Spirit is grieved away when we can have all things in fellowship in common and love one another then God will work with us I believe it's another place he says you know when you act like that when you act out against one another he says you hurt your pastor you know he says I don't care how your pastor holic when he brings the word he says the Spirit of God is grieving away in another spot if I if I have it correctly he says you know you hurt your pastor yeah it is this okay you don't understand sometimes maybe the heart of a pastor you don't understand what that does I mean I'm serious friends I'm not a pastor but but I've been blessed to work alongside mine closely and and see the heart of other pastors and I tell you it grieves them it grieves their heart it hurts them because they think first of all they're gonna look at themselves first and say Lord what am i what am I not preaching or what what's going on here why is this this way you know I believe love brother salmon and you wouldn't necessarily do it just for brother Sam but I don't know where this is coming from I believe the Holy Spirit so we'll just keep going but just know that that it doesn't you're not an island to yourself you friend you affect the body of Christ you do the way you live the way you act you you are part of this body and if and if listen I cut my finger my thumb the other day on a pocketknife and it hurt and I tell you I needed this thumb for many things I was doing I needed this thumb I ended up falling carrying my son and I slipped on this curb and I just kind of think the Lord held him up and I I hid tore my jean and you know I mean I just I had this I almost said booboo I got three kids I had to scrape on my knee and and you know trying to work in things and I was on my knees with knee pads mind you but it just it get rubbed and it break open and things and it just it just hurt I needed that knee and I didn't realize how much that affected me until I was trying to do things so listen I don't care what you feel about yourself this morning I'm here to tell you as a gospel minister that you are needed and that you are important in the body of Christ and you're loved you're loved you may not feel loved this morning and that's because Satan has you bound up in a complex but let me tell you this morning you are loved amen [Applause] so he goes on in humility and hopefully this is all flowing together for you humility is the first key to unlocking brotherly kindness because to put yourself in someone else's shoes you got to tear down your pride you got to be humble and and through that quote we just read I believe it was love and humility and he talks about family altar in the homes you know you have a part to play in your home and your everyday walk with life it's not just here on Sunday or Wednesday or whenever you have service this isn't this isn't the only spot you go home and you live it and you you should you should be in prayer and you should be reading your word and you should be feeding your experience you know over there at Peter says he talks about diligence he says and add this with diligence and and what that is is it's not you try to work it up in yourself basically this is my summary of it this is this is Brandon's dictionary of the Bible I guess is feed your experience that's diligence feed your experience come to church when the doors are open amen now if you have trouble seeing how Lord how do I do this how do I put myself in their shoes these people Lord the the people out in the world the people that I work with how do I put my solisten this goes beyond the body of Christ - you want to win a soul you got to put yourself in their shoes can you say Amen some of us you know maybe I don't know the dynamics of the body here but you know maybe there's a lot of people that are that are you'd say generational message believers you know they we've been blessed you know young people if you grew up in a message home you're blessed but there's a lot a lot of people who grow up in the world and and you know they can they can more easily put themselves to know and other people's shoes but listen I went to public school and I'll tell you like I said with that study with just a little bit of reading on that on that that fashion and seeing that man I tell you I saw it I was there and and and it's it's you can you can put yourself you you have to break down your pride so that you can see that this is a lost soul this is a lost soul and listen brother branham lost the feeling for the people remember I said a little funny feeling will become very very important in the service a funny feeling and he says he says you know I lost feeling for the people this was after the seals in the breach no standing in the gap I'm sorry standing in the gap he speaks to that and and he admits he says I lost a little something because the people they they they they don't seem to be accepting the message and he said it's not so much me what I'm bringing he said but it's the truth I'm trying to tell him the truth and he says you know he was just ready to give it all up and go up and live in the mountains and he said I'll sure do some good fishing but he said that was a little selfish but in another spot I found he's talking about that feeling that he lost and he said you know he said it's not just that I tell him you know hey you know blah I forget how exactly how he cause he words it a couple different ways you know I think it's in a boat he says they're in a boat and they're headed for a cliff and he said it's not just hey you're headed you're headed for a cliff stop he said it's not just that he said I want to chase after him if they laugh and snicker and they don't accept it he said I want to chase after him that's the feeling that he was one that's the feeling that he had lost was not just telling the truth but to chase after him to keep loving him now how do we do that how do we put ourselves in other people's shoes in one spot he's talking about Romans where Paul says you know the things that I that I want to do I can't seem to do and the things I don't want to do I seem to be doing and I find that there's there's two laws working within me Paul says and brother branham's talking about that and he says and the life of the cocklebur has been taken out but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky I'm sorry I love these because you just can't have pride in them the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky so he says you were a cocklebur before you received the Holy Ghost but when you receive the Holy Ghost the life of the cocklebur is taken out and the wheat life is put in but he said you're still cocklebur on the outside I think I said it before and you've heard it many times no doubt you're a three-part being there's only one part of you that's saved there's only one part I just love this because I just Aaron pride only one party as you say there's two parts that's unconverted and there's two parts listen now you got one part that the Spirit of God can come up through there's two parts that Satan can torment and he does it and he'll use it and he'll try to get to that to that one part but he says it's still sticky and it will be listened it will be until this new life has fully been developed out on the ground and raised up again when it comes forth when it's no more cocklebur but wheat but while it's here on earth and in out of the earth and a cocklebur it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it wheat and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin has gone from you see that's the thing he says you know so we so we have these two natures and they're warring against us so so how do you put yourself in somebody else's shoes to realize that you're sticky too you're still a cocklebur on the outside also can you say Amen and what a cockle burrs do if you've ever gotten them they stick one another and they stick to one another and when you're trying to take them off they'll stick you and this is our this is our nature the outside that we're stuck with until we leave but listen there's an inside nature of the Holy Spirit am I allowed down here with you there's an inside spirit that's that's the nature of a weak and you might act out a place with one another and you might say something just a little snappy at one of your brothers or your sisters but the Holy Ghost inside of you that nature on the inside of that cocklebur that's sticking one another it's gonna smite your heart and it's gonna say you know what you weren't right when you said that you need to go back and apologize and let me tell you something we some of us need to lose our pride and go apologize that's why I'm saying it's humility friends because we got to humble ourselves lose our pride and say you know what I'm sorry I'm wrong and how many times have we have we seen it where somebody can't do that and it's a shame it tears the whole thing up until we can humble ourselves humility and in love I tell you I just I just I love the Word of God remember we said diligence is feed your experience that chief the one time he says you know brother Branham said how you doing chief or the man that was talking to him he said how you doing chief he said pretty good pretty bad what do you mean chief and he said well there's two dogs that are inside of me one black dog one white dog and he said they're constantly fighting he said well chief which one wins he said the one chief feeds the most so remember friends McMinn astir swear broken records but there's a truth to it we're pointing you to the source of your strength because you can't you have no strength in yourself your strength is weakness to God but his strength is perfect are you with me a little bit longer we're doing pretty good on time Romans 3:23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God how do you put yourself in the other person's shoes you were a sinner too you had to come to God the same way that they have to you know what I heard some time ago sorry I'm just trying to think of how much to share here my mom my mom and dad are divorced as of a couple years ago and there was an adultery involved in the situation and one day you know I had a hard time with that as a kid as a son you know it's it's difficult if you come from a broken home it's hard it's hard it even that I don't know how old I was at the time but I'm 31 now you know it affects you it does and so that's why we have to have grace for one another is because you never know what somebody's been through in their life or what they're going through at a time at a later age but I was driving on the road one day and I and I had a message playing and brother branham he said you know he said if an adulterer a prostitute an adulterer or somebody who commits adultery he said if they'll come back and they'll they'll meet the same conditions that those women prostitutes and adulterers in the scripture met he said God will forgive them God will forgive them all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God it doesn't matter what you've done if you repent it's gone listen you justified you're justified it's not that you're just you know okay pardon this is gonna go in your file over here God says I don't have a file on them they never did that and listen God extended His grace to you in that way don't you want to extend grace to somebody else Ephesians 4:32 sorry I'm getting I'm just enjoying the word this morning I hope you are too if he ends 432 and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you Colossians three and verse eight and I'm going to bounce a little bit between the amplified and King James just because I really like the way it just explains it a little bit further for me but now you also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth and that verse and the amplified says but now put away and rid yourselves completely of all these things anger rage bad feeling towards others curses and slander and foul-mouthed abuse and shameful utterance from your lips lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with these deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scaly and bond nor free but Christ is all and in all verse 12 out of the amplified put on the King James says clothe yourself therefore as God's own chosen ones his own picked representatives who are purified and holy and well beloved by God Himself by putting on behavior marked by tender-hearted pity and mercy kind feeling a lowly opinion of yourself gentle ways and patients which is tireless and long-suffering and has the power to endure whatever comes with good temper be gentle and forbearing with one another and if one has a Korell a difference a grievance or a complaint against another readily pardoning each other even as the Lord has freely forgiven you so must you also forgive and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness now where I've been getting this little funny feeling statement from is I kept hearing it pop up in the message as I was as the Lord was just directing me down this months ago and I just kept hearing it a little funny feeling a little funny feeling towards them never have a little funny feeling if you have a little funny feeling get it taken care of and it just it just caught my attention and brother branham says don't never let a little ism or a little something another a little bad feeling ever rise up among you get it out of the way right now that's the little fox that spoils the grapes you know so keep it out of the way any little funny feeling go and tell the person to it say I'm wrong I don't feel right towards you and something help me pray over it that it'll be better because we did it we don't want nothing but just purely the unadulterated Holy Spirit of God among us that's all we want then what the gifts and things will work right and everything will be coming right you want gifts among you you want to see manifestations of the Spirit get the funny feelings out from among you now listen friends I like to balance this because out of a pure desire we can take this too far to and and and I got a little funny feeling I need to go tell that person well you're gonna start giving them a little funny feeling if you're not careful I'm talking about a good a good thing to judge it is listen pray about it pray about it don't just pray that God will change the other person pray God will change your heart because remember when love the real love of God comes into your heart you won't go around hurting or being hurt so you need a heart change to regardless of what they've done wrong so pray about it pray for them if that little funny feeling doesn't go away give it a give it a little bit of time and not you know I'm just I hope this is okay trying to balance this out and and and you just can't seem to get past it then it's time to go talk to him it's time to go talk to him brother branham says a little bit further in this quote he says now that he refers to the scripture and the scripture says if anyone has ought against you go make it right so after a while again pray about it you should always pray first there's that saying talk don't don't talk to God about the people before you go talk to the people about God go go talk to God about it before you go talk to the people about it because maybe your heart will change on it can you say Amen that is that clear but you may need to go talk to that person and say hey brother I just just want to make sure the air is clear and listen now listen to me real close this is just real practical I guess I hope that's okay to call it that sometimes when you go and you go to make something right everything okay everything's fine brother everything's all right well god bless you I guess you know we're okay then you know everything's not right they continue on and I mean you just know that it's not right but listen you did your part you tried it's it's between them and God not to get an attitude now watch your attitude continue praying about it but I'm just saying you did your part you did well can you say Amen so I don't know if you ever heard it this is in the revelation series are you still with me a little longer because I like I like to see I'm so thankful for a prophet and I'm thankful for the Prophet we had because you see somebody with a spiritual life that all of us there's just something in us yearning to attain to that and yet he shares his mistakes with us and I just love that and and there there was a situation and and maybe you're familiar with it maybe you're not where the least I think it was two men that started it these two men started this rumor that brother Branham was deity he was Christ and he said stop he said stop doing that you make me Anti Christ when you do that I don't know where some of these tapes these people are listening to or maybe they're missing these but the ones who are making brother branham Christ and and you know take the preacher out of the pulpit and just hit play you kind of wonder and what message that listening to but so he's ready to take himself out of the off-the-field then he says I'm shutting my office I'm done I think he may say you know I'll preach here and there catch a convention but he said I'm done I'm through with it I'm not gonna have that and and he actually it it creates from what I understand of it it creates a little funny feeling towards these brothers because he's I mean he's been to him he's asked him don't do that he took brothers with him don't do that finally he tells it before the church and he says I'm done I'm just I'm through there's a situation he says I can't have it you make me Antichrist when you do that this is what he said so he turns it over to God he turns it over to God catch that and he says but when I come to a place I thought as them men put himself in their shoes and I could finally love those men enough they can't get away from it and immediately shows that those men were called so as soon as he did that as soon as he started thinking about those men as soon as he could put himself in their shoes and think you know there is supernatural around this ministry I could understand that being mistaken and he just this this love came over him and he said they couldn't get away from the love at that point because it just filled his heart for him and and God the Holy Spirit moved on those men and it was over he turned it over to God and the Holy Spirit just came down and took care of it but he says he had to feel for those men and he says that that shows remember at the beginning we said love is corrective and love can stand correction he says that shows that those men was was called that they were elected because he said they they they wish stood when the scripture was spoken he said they took the correction and I just say that for your benefit whether it's through the pulpit or whatever it might be when if if you get all burnt out of shape when somebody comes and corrects you when the Holy Spirit corrects you where where else can we go to be corrected in the house of God you ought to you ought to come and say Lord if there is anything in my life correctly can you say Amen you'll walk away and you'll say thank you Lord we'll just breathe start bringing it down to a close here what was God's response remember we're talking brotherly kindness what was God's response to brother Branham when he criticized the woman in the restaurant do you remember that the blood bumper he the Lord gave him a vision of the blood bumper and he and it was it wasn't a woman since it was brother Branham sense and it would go up and it would hit that bumper and come back down and he ended up he went over and he said lady I'm sorry I'm sorry this is how it was feeling about you but God hey God correct me on that and he said and he ended up leading her to the Lord the very one listen the very one that he was criticizing needed him needed him and in that state of criticism of a critical spirit and looking down and in those funny feelings against her God comes in corrects him and then love is projected and Sovereign Grace took over amen I hope you bring in this in mind of the local body here what was Christ's response when they hung him on the cross with such brutality when they read listen they rejected their Savior they rejected the God that we worship they rejected him they treated them it just terrible terrible don't even explain it awful I mean it was just terrible what did what did what was Christ's response Father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing Christ saw that they're blinded they're blinded and they're doing this they don't they don't know what they're doing and he said Father forgive them can you do that this morning I want to challenge you this morning right now in this moment I want to challenge you can you forgive can you humble yourself maybe you say brother I don't I don't have anything to forgive well praise the Lord we have those times too but there's times remember Satan's always punching he's always trying to come he's always trying to come in and break up what you got here put yourself in one another's shoes and I just just feel the clothes here so if the musicians would come you know the Bible says love your enemies and I always had a hard time with that Lord how do you love your enemies you know you just sharing all this morning I guess you even going through the situation with my family you know I had a hard time I had a hard time separating the sin from the sinner and I didn't I didn't it I just had a hard time just being honest with you it was difficult because you know we can we can get so reflected where it's so much on our own pain that we don't see the pain of others and you know so I just thought Lord how do you love your enemies and I thought and then it was just like the Lord spoke back and he said put yourself in their shoes love your enemy put yourself in their shoes the boss who is constantly riding you at work how do you how do you show love to somebody like that the Bible says to to do good to and it would be like not that you do this for this reason but it says if you do good to them it's like heaping coals of fire on top of their head it just sets them on fire all the more because they're thinking I'm trying to get to this person the spirit in them is thinking I'm trying to get to this person I want to destroy their day and yet there's something about them there's Oh help me Lord there's an atmosphere that's coming out of them I can't seem to get through that atmosphere they're still smiling why are they still smiling because you're thinking lord I was a sinner once I used to act like that I've had bad days lord help my boss you know there's another quote and I'm sorry I'm trying I guess I wasn't done just yet you can stand to your feet there's a quote and I just I just love to say it because it just it expresses this so well and brother branham said when someone's done you wrong and you know that they absolutely justifiably they deserve punishment because they've done you wrong he said go to prayer and I'm just paraphrasing I got the quote but I just don't want to just paraphrase it here and he says you take him to prayer and he says when you're in the presence of God says you're you're mortal you're to mortals and one can't condemn the other in the presence of God he says listen now when you come down from there when you come down from there he said maybe you'll see what your brothers your sister's going through and you can love them right so that's what I'm saying friends it's it's very important to take them to prayer take them to prayer you need to see someone else's shoes pray for I hope this was a blessing to you this morning you've been very attentive and I appreciate that I tend to slow down a little bit towards the end so hopefully it didn't bore you I just I pray that you can come up a little higher this morning and see the Christian walk a little bit more clearly and and and help you because I know it's hard friends I know it's hard when someone's at treating you that way it's difficult let's just bow our hearts in prayer here and I wonder with every head bowed eyes closed if you've got a little something in your heart towards somebody nobody looking around now it's just between you and God but it's just to identify Lord I've got a little something in my heart towards that brother or that sister maybe towards my boss or towards that co-worker because that's having a lot of testimonies come back coworkers you just want to make that known to the Lord and say father help me to put myself in their shoes that you could be expressed to them maybe you're the only hope you're the only source that the lever here or or see a life lived of the love of Christ father we come before you lord Lord I know God that I've had many times funny feelings in my heart towards somebody in even situations now Lord that I'm thinking of while I'm praying here father that Lord is just difficult to see their place on it or their position why they're acting that way why would their doing that why they would speak out like that but father we want to check our own hearts Lord we pray that whatever that person's going through that you would go administer to that need but father right now Lord we need minister to God in our hearts we ask you Lord to change our hearts God that your love could be expressed Lord we love you so much father and we just want to be the best representative of you and of this message on this earth that we can be help us to love deeper Lord bless your people now god I just I pray Lord that this would have spoke to him this morning Lord just put a hedge of love around them around this body here God that the love of Christ or that you'd be glorified and brother branham said at the end of that humble thyself quote he said we're looking for the time that people drive by and say have you been up to that Tabernacle that's the sweetest bunch of people reverent for the word or to let this church have that testimony I pray love you Lord Jesus Christ name Abe Amen god bless y'all turn it over for the worship and if you need prayer would be happy to pray with you and I just I just pray it helped you this morning god bless you
