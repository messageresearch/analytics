[43:15] while you know
[43:19] we certainly i certainly love them and i
[43:21] really appreciate them and
[43:23] couldn't ask for her for better in-laws
[43:26] and
[43:26] i really appreciate them and appreciate
[43:28] their sacrifice
[43:29] all these years and driving back and
[43:32] forth and
[43:33] um i just know it was the lord that kept
[43:35] kept his hand on him
[43:37] and uh so i really we just so appreciate
[43:40] that and
[43:41] their labor and each and every one we're
[43:43] just glad to be here i want to make an
[43:44] announcement we
[43:46] when we had split uh the groups up um
[43:49] we we did that and just to try to look
[43:53] at everything and
[43:54] see how it would be because everything
[43:55] was was certainly it's been a lot
[43:57] different for all of us
[43:58] um but as i mentioned in the beginning
[44:01] the
[44:02] the focus that we had we were able to
[44:05] handle in the sanctuary um
[44:09] with our our church and that we were
[44:11] still able to handle it even if we had
[44:13] everybody come
[44:14] but just one of those things we just
[44:16] wanted to do um
[44:18] here over these two weeks and just to
[44:20] see where everything was and
[44:22] i really felt like after thursday night
[44:24] we could go ahead and
[44:26] and open it and so we still have i
[44:29] want you to understand we we still with
[44:33] this thursday and everything else it
[44:35] just everything just full resuming
[44:37] full congregation but we still have all
[44:40] of the things that we still have to be
[44:41] mindful of
[44:42] the protocols and things like that if um
[44:46] and we just want i want you to be
[44:48] mindful of that there's still things
[44:49] that we have in place just because we're
[44:51] able to because of the size of our
[44:54] assembly and
[44:54] and the building others would not
[44:57] perhaps be able to do that
[44:59] um and so i know there's some strong
[45:02] language that came out
[45:03] on friday with admonishing you know
[45:06] let's get the churches open
[45:07] and um but um we just
[45:11] looking at these things and uh
[45:14] so i want you just to be mindful of it
[45:16] when we're when we're doing
[45:18] everything and you know we're not
[45:21] i just say it like this i don't want we
[45:23] don't i don't want anybody being a
[45:24] policeman around here
[45:26] and saying you you were within you were
[45:29] at five
[45:30] foot you were in five feet five inches
[45:32] of me
[45:33] you need to be a six foot we that right
[45:35] there we we understand that's
[45:37] those are things we're trying to do
[45:39] everything we can with the social
[45:40] distancing and
[45:42] you know and and we do everything that
[45:44] we can do but we're here for one purpose
[45:48] we're here for one purpose these little
[45:49] things i know it's a little bit some
[45:51] we've got things where we had to look
[45:53] and see can we get everybody and get
[45:54] them spaced and we had to do all that
[45:56] and we can do it
[45:57] but we had to and and and
[46:00] just to say it like this i know some of
[46:02] this right now it would be a little bit
[46:04] uncomfortable
[46:05] some of you are able to maintain or you
[46:07] have your seat it wasn't because you got
[46:09] preference over anybody else
[46:11] it just we're just trying to position
[46:13] things you know the way things are
[46:15] and so um you know just try to
[46:18] to bear and i won't just say just with
[46:20] us but just with one another
[46:23] we're in this together these are these
[46:25] are definitely
[46:26] uh different times for us but we want to
[46:28] just with one another
[46:30] just try to work with one another you
[46:32] may not end up with your seat
[46:34] and your favorite seed and your but i'm
[46:37] sure that
[46:38] it's just we're thankful to be in the
[46:40] house of god and so i believe we can
[46:42] overlook that and
[46:44] and so just we want to just make that
[46:47] that known and lord willing then this
[46:49] coming thursday we'll just
[46:50] as we have here this morning just um
[46:53] open it up and
[46:54] so that that people could could be able
[46:56] to come and we want to look into the
[46:58] word of the lord and
[47:00] and before we do let's just have a word
[47:01] of prayer we we just want to invite him

[48:48] open up our bibles to second kings
[48:50] chapter 6 i we
[48:55] led off there last week and i just
[48:59] want to begin there this morning and
[49:01] we'll see where the lord will take us
[49:04] in this
[49:07] and i want to continue that thought we
[49:10] were looking at last sunday
[49:12] stability in the midst of
[49:15] instability
[49:19] second kings chapter six verse eight the
[49:22] bible says
[49:23] then the king of syria ward against
[49:27] israel and took counsel with his
[49:29] servants saying
[49:31] in such a such a place shall be my camp
[49:34] and the man of god sent unto the king of
[49:37] israel saying
[49:39] beware that thou pass not such a place
[49:43] for thither the syrians are come down
[49:48] i want you to think of this here very
[49:50] small little details but i want you to
[49:52] think of it
[49:53] the man of god here he was in israel
[49:58] but the same god he was right there
[50:01] hearing everything that the king of
[50:04] syria
[50:05] was doing and he revealed it
[50:09] to the man of god and look what god did
[50:14] the man of god spoke and said beware
[50:18] beware get yourself in position here
[50:21] and they got themselves in position look
[50:23] what the scripture says in verse 10
[50:25] and the king of israel sent to the place
[50:28] which the man of god told him
[50:30] and warned him of and saved himself
[50:34] there not once nor twice
[50:38] therefore the heart of the king of syria
[50:40] was sore troubled for this thing
[50:43] and he called his servants and said unto
[50:45] them will you not show me
[50:47] which of us is for the king of israel
[50:51] he thought he had he thought he had a
[50:53] watchdog or a leaker on the inside
[50:55] he wanted to who who's who's leaking
[50:57] this you know how they always
[50:59] put it out there this one spoke on you
[51:01] know on
[51:02] you know unidentified source you know in
[51:04] public if i get the word right
[51:06] anonymity or whatever how they pronounce
[51:08] it i mean
[51:10] it's like somebody they want to just
[51:11] leak something and here
[51:13] look what he look what he just look what
[51:14] he says he's asking who who
[51:16] show me which one of us is for the king
[51:18] of israel
[51:19] and one of his servants said none my
[51:22] lord
[51:22] o king but elisha the prophet
[51:26] that is in israel telleth the king of
[51:30] israel the
[51:31] words that thou speakest in thy bed
[51:34] chamber
[51:37] not not just around your war table but
[51:39] what's going on in your bed chamber he
[51:41] speaks these words out you know what he
[51:43] was saying there's no way
[51:45] no place that you can go to that would
[51:47] be so secret and so private
[51:50] that god don't know aren't you glad that
[51:53] we're under his protection
[51:56] amen god bless you as you're being
[51:57] seated this morning
[52:01] oh my so when we look at this here in
[52:04] the scripture
[52:07] uh we certainly i believe we certainly
[52:11] can agree
[52:13] we are and not just something that we've
[52:16] come to of
[52:16] unstable times or instability but it
[52:20] really begins to show itself and i want
[52:22] you to think of this here
[52:25] we've looked at we've heard
[52:28] the message of what god has sent us and
[52:30] we understand that that message
[52:32] was to bring us to a living reality that
[52:35] god
[52:35] is still the same god he's present
[52:39] that message has also posted us the
[52:42] prophetic message has posted you and i
[52:46] to what is taking place what is going on
[52:48] i'll tell you this right here
[52:50] when you as you listen to the message
[52:52] i've never ceased this brother joy over
[52:54] the years
[52:54] it's as though you would think brother
[52:56] branham had just preached that morning
[52:58] by looking at the conditions you're
[53:00] seeing you know why because it's a
[53:02] prophetic eye
[53:04] the scripture said it's the eye of god
[53:05] and the eye of god is christ
[53:08] this is god lifts up that seer to be
[53:11] able to look through that eye of christ
[53:13] that it would post you and i of the
[53:15] things that are taking place
[53:17] the things that we see all around us we
[53:20] that is not anything where we would be
[53:23] where trouble would not come around we
[53:25] see through the scripture
[53:26] it has been promised our prophesied
[53:29] that trouble would be all around wars
[53:31] and rumors of war
[53:32] all of these things that we see
[53:35] instability
[53:36] when a prophet would speak those things
[53:37] i often wondered and when he stood there
[53:40] and he would speak in this world is
[53:42] falling apart again
[53:43] i wondered how many of them would look
[53:45] at him and think what
[53:46] is he talking about because he would
[53:49] identify
[53:50] the things that was taking place and yet
[53:53] what it was
[53:54] is that he's identifying the seeds that
[53:57] were there at that time
[53:58] many could look and think my goodness
[54:00] you know we've got a strong nation we've
[54:03] got this
[54:03] but yet it was identifying the seeds
[54:06] because remember
[54:08] when israel themselves got away from god
[54:11] and remember
[54:12] when they got away from god then it just
[54:14] everything else let loose
[54:16] israel was not a strong nation because
[54:19] of all of everything that they could do
[54:21] in their goodness
[54:22] but their strength came from the lord
[54:26] that was the secret of their strength as
[54:28] a matter of fact
[54:29] his presence is called the strength of
[54:31] israel
[54:33] and to think the same way here with
[54:35] america
[54:36] it's the same way it's been through all
[54:38] of the gentile powers
[54:40] it was not those powers that were strong
[54:42] in themselves
[54:43] they had boundaries prophetically that
[54:46] were set
[54:47] they couldn't go past those boundaries
[54:49] and all of that god had it laid out
[54:51] in time of all of those four kingdoms
[54:54] coming down
[54:55] and we see where you and i are at in
[54:57] this time think of the fourth kingdom
[54:59] now
[55:00] of where is upon this earth and that
[55:03] is that of rome and we see the mixture
[55:06] of clay and iron they will not
[55:08] mix together it speaks of a fragile
[55:12] condition
[55:13] it speaks of instability it's all come
[55:16] all the way on down
[55:17] and we see it right now remember even in
[55:20] the time
[55:21] where the when the prophet was standing
[55:22] here the spirit of god would begin to
[55:25] identify
[55:26] because look within man man craves
[55:29] security man craves
[55:32] peace he craves what we would say good
[55:35] news
[55:36] man craves safety and to think of it
[55:39] with even that
[55:40] when these things would be developed you
[55:42] know united nations and
[55:44] and this organization and this
[55:46] organization and we find
[55:48] all of that was supposed to to actually
[55:51] purport
[55:52] peace and and try to give you know rest
[55:55] but we realize
[55:56] there's none of those things that's
[55:57] given rest as a matter of fact
[55:59] there's all it's never even settled nor
[56:01] calmed the troubling why it is of man
[56:04] they're saying that'll actually bring
[56:06] peace upon this earth
[56:08] and that is when christ himself comes
[56:11] back and we
[56:12] enter into a millennium reign that's the
[56:14] only time there's ever going to be peace
[56:16] upon this earth until that time peace
[56:20] itself is what reigns in the heart of
[56:22] the believer
[56:23] it's not based on the peace of where
[56:25] things are at in the stock market or
[56:27] where
[56:28] is this one at or where is this one at
[56:30] and you know
[56:31] it's our peace is not rest within that
[56:33] our peace comes from the lord
[56:35] the lord jesus told us in john 16 33
[56:39] he said be of good cheer for i've
[56:40] overcome the world he said in the world
[56:43] you will have
[56:44] tribulation but in me you will have
[56:47] peace so here within
[56:50] israel they are faced with a very a
[56:53] situation where
[56:55] syria is trying to come at them and
[56:58] trying to
[56:59] to you know to surprise them
[57:02] and i want you to catch this here the
[57:04] secret of their victory
[57:06] was they had a prophet in the land of
[57:11] that israel the secret of their victory
[57:13] to whom god
[57:15] would reveal himself god literally
[57:17] uncovered the tactics of the enemy
[57:20] let me just tell you this right now
[57:22] those things if
[57:23] israel did us on that and see the word
[57:26] of the lord coming to pass
[57:28] and the enemy being exposed every time
[57:31] you know if they took it to where it was
[57:32] just like a hog
[57:33] underneath the tree and the apples are
[57:35] dropping and they just scarf up the hall
[57:37] or the apples instead of looking up and
[57:39] saying
[57:40] who's supplying these apples you see
[57:42] israel had to recognize
[57:44] it's the god he is watching over israel
[57:47] god has placed a man here
[57:49] that he will speak through and though
[57:51] the enemy thinks he's got a surprise
[57:53] attack
[57:54] the enemy thinks he's got an advantage
[57:56] but he doesn't have an advantage over
[57:57] god
[57:58] the enemy he can have an advantage over
[58:00] this flesh but he does not
[58:02] have an advantage over the living god
[58:05] oh my and if we are on the side of the
[58:08] lord
[58:09] then brother the scripture said if god
[58:11] be
[58:12] for us who can be against us
[58:16] this is a promise that belongs to us
[58:19] brother
[58:19] these are not just words these are times
[58:22] to draw
[58:23] upon the promises of god oh my
[58:26] it would reveal to the king of israel so
[58:29] that he could get in the right position
[58:32] it did no good as we see here in the
[58:35] scripture as much
[58:36] as what could be spoken if the king of
[58:38] israel didn't believe it
[58:40] and act on it it did no good
[58:43] the word of god will never do anybody
[58:45] any good by just them hearing it
[58:48] you've got to act upon the word that
[58:51] requires
[58:52] faith now to think how the king of
[58:54] israel would move within this time
[58:56] and it would actually where the syrians
[58:59] were trying to make
[59:00] a surprise attack he would catch them
[59:04] and it would be the syrians that would
[59:06] be surprised
[59:07] let me just say it to you like this
[59:09] there's nothing that takes god by
[59:11] surprise
[59:14] now let's be honest there's many things
[59:16] that take us by surprise
[59:21] oh yeah if we're truly honest
[59:25] oftentimes troubles arise and the
[59:27] direction
[59:28] from which it arises can take us by
[59:31] surprise
[59:33] but not god i said but not god
[59:37] this is the reason that we must have a
[59:40] true connection
[59:41] with the living god to know that he is
[59:44] god and that he is ever present
[59:48] now i want you to look at a few
[59:49] scriptures here in psalms
[59:51] 46 verse 1. god is
[59:54] our refuge and strength
[59:58] a very present help in trouble
[1:00:03] therefore will not we fear though the
[1:00:07] earth be removed
[1:00:08] and though the mountains be carried into
[1:00:10] the midst of the sea
[1:00:11] though the waters thereof roar and be
[1:00:14] troubled though the mountains
[1:00:16] shake with the swelling thereof salah
[1:00:19] there is a river the streams whereof
[1:00:22] shall make glad the city of god
[1:00:25] the holy place of the tabernacles of the
[1:00:27] most high
[1:00:28] god is in her midst
[1:00:31] she shall not be moved god shall
[1:00:35] help her and that right on right early
[1:00:38] the scripture goes on right here the
[1:00:40] lord of hosts is with us
[1:00:42] the god of jacob is our
[1:00:45] refuge now the scripture here as it goes
[1:00:49] on
[1:00:50] in second king six and he said here is
[1:00:53] where the king of syria said go
[1:00:56] and spy where he is i want to know where
[1:00:58] this prophet's at
[1:00:59] then i may send and fetch him and he was
[1:01:02] told him saying behold
[1:01:04] he is in dothan now i want you to think
[1:01:07] of this we
[1:01:08] we just seen this in the scripture which
[1:01:10] you're no doubt familiar with
[1:01:11] god had revealed move that the syrian
[1:01:15] army had been making
[1:01:17] before they could ever get there it was
[1:01:20] already revealed
[1:01:21] and the people were prepared and in
[1:01:24] position
[1:01:26] to meet the enemy's advance what put the
[1:01:30] people in position
[1:01:31] there was a prophet of god in israel
[1:01:35] there was a contact and the people of
[1:01:38] god were under
[1:01:39] that word brother
[1:01:42] amen that same god now think about this
[1:01:46] now that same god look at how that this
[1:01:48] opens
[1:01:49] in this time the same god was
[1:01:52] with him that had revealed every move
[1:01:56] made by the king of syria but this time
[1:01:59] it was different this was going to be a
[1:02:02] surprise
[1:02:04] but you see god was going to actually
[1:02:08] display
[1:02:09] his presence now i won't ask you but how
[1:02:13] many of you
[1:02:14] me included have been in times and
[1:02:16] situations
[1:02:17] that things took us by surprise
[1:02:20] we absolutely took it by take it by
[1:02:22] surprise now if we're honest if we're
[1:02:23] not trying to you know say oh i knew
[1:02:25] that was coming you know
[1:02:26] i had this little thought i had if we'll
[1:02:28] just be honest and say you know what
[1:02:30] this just blindsided me it caught me by
[1:02:32] surprise
[1:02:33] but you see in the midst of that time as
[1:02:35] a believer
[1:02:36] our faith is not anchored in us having
[1:02:39] control
[1:02:40] of everything but our faith is anchored
[1:02:43] in the one who has control of us and he
[1:02:46] has control of
[1:02:47] every situation that is around us now
[1:02:50] notice
[1:02:51] therefore sent heed the king of syria
[1:02:53] horses and chariots
[1:02:55] and a great host and they came by night
[1:02:58] and
[1:02:58] compassed the city about
[1:03:01] now as i mentioned last week a great
[1:03:04] host
[1:03:04] he didn't just send one man hey you're
[1:03:06] only coming after one man
[1:03:08] you could maybe send one man or two men
[1:03:10] but it shows you the threat
[1:03:12] the enemy perceived this threat he
[1:03:15] wasn't
[1:03:16] sending the whole host out after you
[1:03:18] know a part of the army he sent the
[1:03:20] whole host
[1:03:21] he gathered everything let me just say
[1:03:23] it to you like this he put
[1:03:24] all of his military budget into a place
[1:03:28] to where he would be able to remove the
[1:03:31] prophet of god
[1:03:32] from in the midst of israel and that's
[1:03:36] what satan has been trying to do
[1:03:38] that is exactly what satan would love
[1:03:40] nothing more to do
[1:03:42] than to try to kill the influence that
[1:03:45] god
[1:03:45] has brought through and by the prophet
[1:03:48] messenger
[1:03:49] in this hour brother this is why it must
[1:03:53] be a personal
[1:03:54] revelation that these are not the
[1:03:57] thoughts of man
[1:03:58] it's not man's ideas
[1:04:01] amen this is a promise of god that has
[1:04:04] been spoken
[1:04:06] in this hour to an ordained people
[1:04:09] who would have ears to hear
[1:04:13] [Applause]
[1:04:17] as soon as you get them away from the
[1:04:18] prophet you got them
[1:04:24] as soon as you get into reasoning got
[1:04:26] them
[1:04:29] come on friends you see
[1:04:32] the king of syria he seen this was such
[1:04:35] a threat
[1:04:36] that's where the devil sees a threat
[1:04:40] he gets them away from this message they
[1:04:42] have no eyes
[1:04:45] come on this is the holy ghost the isab
[1:04:48] that is sent in this hour
[1:04:50] they become blind to the promises of god
[1:04:53] they become
[1:04:54] blind to the image of god they cannot
[1:04:57] see
[1:04:57] jesus christ for who he really is and
[1:05:00] they never can ever see themselves
[1:05:06] he wanted to destroy the confidence but
[1:05:08] notice our strength
[1:05:11] it's not in numbers our abilities
[1:05:16] our swords our knowledge our
[1:05:18] understanding
[1:05:20] our strength is in the lord i'm telling
[1:05:23] you in times
[1:05:24] and situations and this is just this is
[1:05:26] just a minor thing
[1:05:27] that we've been going through i'm not
[1:05:29] making a lot of it but i'm telling you
[1:05:31] it's a minor thing
[1:05:33] it's a time in this hour to be sure
[1:05:35] enough where is our anchor at
[1:05:36] we can talk about faith when
[1:05:38] everything's good but what is it when
[1:05:40] situations are taking place that
[1:05:42] requires
[1:05:43] faith
[1:05:46] amen may god help us
[1:05:50] amen he is the strength of our life
[1:05:52] these scriptures mean so much
[1:05:54] that man shall not live by bread alone
[1:05:58] shall we have to work shall we have to
[1:06:00] eat naturally
[1:06:01] but that's not man shall not live by
[1:06:03] bread alone
[1:06:04] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:06:07] the mouth of god
[1:06:08] that's where a man he finds his resource
[1:06:11] his strength is from the word of the
[1:06:14] lord brother
[1:06:15] that's a real strength that's a real
[1:06:17] courage it comes from him
[1:06:21] oh my israel had victory they had
[1:06:24] victory because they had
[1:06:26] a prophet of the lord in their land and
[1:06:29] they believed him
[1:06:32] and do no good to have him if you don't
[1:06:34] believe him
[1:06:36] they believed he was god's spokesman and
[1:06:38] it put them in position
[1:06:42] now think of this the bible goes on and
[1:06:46] when the servant of the man of god was
[1:06:48] risen early
[1:06:48] and gone forth behold a host compassed
[1:06:51] the city
[1:06:52] both with horses and chariots and his
[1:06:55] servant
[1:06:56] said unto him alas my master
[1:06:59] how shall we do he answered
[1:07:02] fear not that's the greatest answer that
[1:07:05] we can receive
[1:07:07] and that'll always be the answer that
[1:07:09] comes from the lord
[1:07:10] is fear not because he can't say
[1:07:13] anything to us
[1:07:15] if we're fearful but one word from him
[1:07:19] fear not he could have never spoke to
[1:07:22] mary
[1:07:23] of the promise that was for her if he
[1:07:26] first
[1:07:26] she was troubled in her mind and he said
[1:07:29] fear not he's got to get her settled
[1:07:33] down it wasn't mary wasn't a believer
[1:07:37] but he had to get her
[1:07:38] settled down
[1:07:42] oh my notice fear not for they that be
[1:07:46] with us are more
[1:07:47] than they that be with them and elisha
[1:07:49] prayed and said lord
[1:07:51] i pray thee open his eyes that he might
[1:07:54] see
[1:07:54] elisha was the prophet of god but he
[1:07:57] could not
[1:07:57] open gahesa's eyes but he didn't know
[1:08:00] the one that opened his eyes
[1:08:03] elisha did know the one that opened his
[1:08:05] eyes and he knew that god was no
[1:08:08] respecter person
[1:08:09] he knew what he was doing mind his own
[1:08:12] business
[1:08:12] plowing there in his family's fields but
[1:08:15] the spirit of god came by
[1:08:17] through that of the prophet elijah and
[1:08:19] the mantle
[1:08:20] was placed upon him and moved over and
[1:08:23] elisha began to follow
[1:08:25] in the footsteps of elijah he would pour
[1:08:28] water upon his hands he knew what he was
[1:08:31] for that to take a hold of his life to
[1:08:34] where
[1:08:34] everything else it became secondary
[1:08:38] brother he cut up the plow he chopped up
[1:08:41] the
[1:08:42] hold out everything because of a hole
[1:08:45] that had come upon his life he had not
[1:08:48] even received
[1:08:49] that of the power of the spirit yet but
[1:08:52] it had moved upon his life
[1:08:54] and he knew that was for me oh glory to
[1:08:58] god
[1:08:59] if anyone here this morning that has not
[1:09:02] been born of the spirit of god
[1:09:04] when you sense him dealing with your
[1:09:06] life remember
[1:09:07] god is not playing games that is the map
[1:09:11] that he would move around your life
[1:09:15] open his eyes oh my
[1:09:19] hallelujah that's my prayer
[1:09:22] and the lord opened the eyes
[1:09:25] of the young man and he saw
[1:09:28] and behold the mountain was full of
[1:09:30] horses and chariots
[1:09:32] round about elisha now you think about
[1:09:35] this
[1:09:36] in the beginning i mean because it would
[1:09:38] have been all natural
[1:09:39] for hazel what he's sitting there
[1:09:41] looking at you're not going to tell him
[1:09:42] he ain't seeing what he's seeing
[1:09:44] hearing what he's hearing you're going
[1:09:45] to tell him he's seeing it he's hearing
[1:09:48] it
[1:09:50] but you see how god made a man in the
[1:09:52] beginning
[1:09:54] god did not make flesh man first
[1:09:59] that was the house that the man created
[1:10:02] in his own image
[1:10:04] in his own likeness and we must keep in
[1:10:07] mind that this house
[1:10:09] was created not to make contact with god
[1:10:14] this house itself was not made to
[1:10:17] contact god
[1:10:19] but that man that god made first in his
[1:10:21] image
[1:10:22] in his likeness after his kind remember
[1:10:25] it was to that man
[1:10:27] that he gave jurisdiction he gave
[1:10:29] authority
[1:10:30] over the animal life all of that all the
[1:10:32] rest was
[1:10:33] under that jurisdiction that leadership
[1:10:36] that headship so here we find that when
[1:10:39] satan as he studied it the thing that
[1:10:42] satan did
[1:10:43] is he came to eve now he has to move her
[1:10:46] from relying upon the supernatural
[1:10:49] he's got to move her away from relying
[1:10:52] upon what god
[1:10:53] has actually made her so he has to be
[1:10:56] able
[1:10:56] to pull her into a place to where she
[1:11:00] will
[1:11:00] actually be moved by her senses her
[1:11:03] feelings
[1:11:04] her mind her reasoning he's got to pull
[1:11:07] her into that realm
[1:11:08] if he can move her into that realm to
[1:11:11] where she lives by reasoning
[1:11:13] she walks by her feelings and her senses
[1:11:16] he's got her whipped right there
[1:11:18] and let's just be honest anytime the
[1:11:20] enemy
[1:11:21] can work and pull us into our reasoning
[1:11:24] our imagination our conscience or any of
[1:11:27] those things now remember god gave us
[1:11:29] those gates
[1:11:30] but we got to rule over them god has
[1:11:32] never given the five senses
[1:11:33] neither did he give the five spiritual
[1:11:35] senses for man to be led by
[1:11:38] but god supplied faith that would be the
[1:11:41] supersense
[1:11:42] or the sixth sense whereby man would
[1:11:44] actually be brought
[1:11:45] into contact with god into that of the
[1:11:48] unseen
[1:11:49] realm so how that satan would work on
[1:11:52] that
[1:11:52] and he still tries to do the same thing
[1:11:54] here yet within
[1:11:56] our lives this is why that we cannot
[1:11:58] walk by our intellect
[1:12:01] we can't walk by our intellect this is
[1:12:04] why that there is
[1:12:05] must come that of the new birth where we
[1:12:08] receive
[1:12:09] a renewing of our mind being renewed in
[1:12:11] the spirit of our mind
[1:12:12] that our spiritual eyes would actually
[1:12:14] become open
[1:12:15] you realize that a person can actually
[1:12:18] see 20 20
[1:12:19] with their natural eyes and yet they'll
[1:12:21] be blind
[1:12:22] they can't even see what's in front of
[1:12:24] them think of this later on in this
[1:12:26] passage right here
[1:12:27] elisha walks out and he comes to the
[1:12:30] syrian army
[1:12:31] and he says who are you looking for they
[1:12:33] said we're looking for that prophet of
[1:12:34] god
[1:12:35] and elijah said come with me i'll show
[1:12:37] you exactly where he's at
[1:12:38] he was standing right in front of them
[1:12:41] brother they could have had his breath
[1:12:43] and everything else
[1:12:44] all over him but they didn't see him
[1:12:46] they were blind to it
[1:12:48] but all of a sudden when they came there
[1:12:51] in the host in the midst of israel then
[1:12:54] god
[1:12:54] opened their eyes god opened them that
[1:12:57] they could see
[1:12:58] that the very one that they were looking
[1:13:00] for think of it
[1:13:01] one man was leading a whole host
[1:13:04] one man the same man that they were
[1:13:06] after oh glory to god
[1:13:08] you talk about a man with confidence
[1:13:11] that can know
[1:13:12] that those swords and chariots and they
[1:13:14] were all around him
[1:13:15] they were sworn to get him but he had
[1:13:18] such confidence
[1:13:19] in the lord god oh brother he was
[1:13:22] stabilized
[1:13:23] in the midst of unstable times he was
[1:13:26] stable
[1:13:30] because we do not see the kingdom of god
[1:13:33] with these
[1:13:34] eyes it comes without
[1:13:37] observation
[1:13:43] it comes without that it's our heart
[1:13:45] it's having our heart the eyes of our
[1:13:47] heart
[1:13:48] anointed here's what jesus would say
[1:13:53] in john 14 18 i will not leave you
[1:13:55] comfortless
[1:13:57] i will come to you
[1:14:00] we're not like orphans
[1:14:04] when the holy ghost has come we're not
[1:14:06] like orphans
[1:14:09] now i've got a little bit of a dry cough
[1:14:11] but don't nobody get nervous
[1:14:14] i got my nice cough drop here
[1:14:21] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[1:14:24] come
[1:14:25] to you yet a little while and the world
[1:14:30] seeth me no more but you see me
[1:14:34] so the world will not see him but you
[1:14:37] see him
[1:14:39] because i live you shall live also and
[1:14:42] at that day you shall know
[1:14:44] that i am in my father and ye and me and
[1:14:46] i
[1:14:47] in you oh that's what's really important
[1:14:51] is that we would see him
[1:14:54] second corinthians 4 17 for our light
[1:14:56] affliction
[1:14:57] which is but for a moment worketh for us
[1:15:00] a far
[1:15:01] more exceeding and eternal weight
[1:15:05] of glory while we look not
[1:15:08] don't let these just be words while we
[1:15:10] look not at the things which are
[1:15:12] seen you know what that means we're not
[1:15:15] focusing on what we see
[1:15:19] abraham every day he woke up he
[1:15:22] saw the frailty of his humanity
[1:15:26] i don't know if when he got up he had to
[1:15:28] do stretches for his lower back or not
[1:15:31] but every day maybe he started out with
[1:15:33] a crook oh my
[1:15:34] sir that tempur-pedic just ain't what it
[1:15:36] used to be oh it said i'll tell you
[1:15:38] well praise god we're going to have that
[1:15:40] baby abraham when you're going to
[1:15:41] straighten out well after i get morning
[1:15:43] coffee
[1:15:43] i might be able to straighten out and
[1:15:45] walk straight but you see he never
[1:15:47] focused this was right here
[1:15:51] this was not something he had to log
[1:15:53] into this was not a website
[1:15:55] this was not a news update it was all
[1:15:58] around him
[1:16:00] but he chose not to focus on it
[1:16:06] hallelujah in the words of the prophet
[1:16:09] he
[1:16:09] focused out unbelief
[1:16:13] focused out so if you focus that out
[1:16:17] it shows you must be focusing on
[1:16:18] something else
[1:16:20] [Applause]
[1:16:23] he chose to focus on the promise of god
[1:16:31] but at the things which are not seen
[1:16:33] that's what we look at
[1:16:34] that's a that's a paradox in it how can
[1:16:36] you focus and look on something you
[1:16:38] can't see
[1:16:39] but i can see it even though it's
[1:16:40] invisible i can see it
[1:16:43] for the things which are seen
[1:16:46] are temporal but the things which are
[1:16:50] not seen
[1:16:51] are eternal
[1:16:54] brother brown was in a meeting in canada
[1:16:59] and remember there was a tv salesman out
[1:17:02] there
[1:17:03] he found out he didn't know brother
[1:17:05] brown's name but he found out
[1:17:07] that he was with that branham outfit and
[1:17:09] he began to question you know in a
[1:17:11] manner of
[1:17:12] what do you think about this and what do
[1:17:13] you think about that
[1:17:16] and so the man spoke to brother branham
[1:17:19] and he said it like this
[1:17:20] when brother branham was asking him what
[1:17:22] did you think about what happened with
[1:17:23] that boy that got up out of the out of
[1:17:25] the wheelchair
[1:17:26] what did you think about that with that
[1:17:27] man and here's what the guy said
[1:17:30] ah that's nothing but psychology
[1:17:34] that's no i can't believe none of that
[1:17:35] what was it he was standing face to face
[1:17:38] but he couldn't see it
[1:17:42] face to face with a vessel that god had
[1:17:45] used
[1:17:46] just the night before so the man makes a
[1:17:48] statement and he says
[1:17:50] anything that cannot be scientifically
[1:17:52] proven
[1:17:53] then i think there's nothing to it you
[1:17:56] see this is the age we're living in
[1:17:58] the god listen to me now these got to be
[1:18:01] more than just quotes
[1:18:03] the god of this evil age
[1:18:06] is scientific knowledge
[1:18:09] and the prophet would say like this
[1:18:11] satan has been exalted
[1:18:13] to the throne of worship in man
[1:18:18] knowledge understanding has become the
[1:18:22] god that's bowed to but i believe i'm
[1:18:26] looking at some hebrew children
[1:18:29] whether you're here or you're in the
[1:18:30] unseen audience i believe i've got so
[1:18:32] there's someone there's some hebrew
[1:18:33] children that says i ain't buying
[1:18:35] bound to the god of science i'm not
[1:18:38] bound to bowing to
[1:18:39] scientific knowledge because this i
[1:18:42] cannot be stable
[1:18:43] upon those things
[1:18:46] i know i'm talking to i know there's so
[1:18:49] many that i said right here maybe we
[1:18:50] ought to just open up a medical school
[1:18:52] here
[1:18:53] because there's many of right here in
[1:18:54] this congregation from from a doctor
[1:18:56] back there to
[1:18:57] nurses that take care of things right
[1:18:58] here but you understand
[1:19:00] even with having all that understanding
[1:19:02] when you go to approach anything
[1:19:04] you're asking the lord to open your
[1:19:06] understanding brother scott when you go
[1:19:08] to perform a surgery
[1:19:09] an operation or to look at a patient
[1:19:12] those of you the rest of you out there
[1:19:13] in the nursing homes in different places
[1:19:15] you're asking god for understanding at
[1:19:17] least i hope you are
[1:19:19] i hope you're not trusting in your
[1:19:21] abilities
[1:19:23] because if you aren't make sure you tell
[1:19:24] me where you're working so i make sure i
[1:19:26] don't we don't send nobody there
[1:19:29] we want to trust in the lord
[1:19:32] i don't care how many abilities you
[1:19:34] think you've got we are trusting in the
[1:19:36] lord
[1:19:37] we're not trusting in our knowledge lean
[1:19:40] not to thine own understanding
[1:19:45] trust in the lord at all times
[1:19:50] wow and brother branham you know kind of
[1:19:53] makes a little bit of a southern
[1:19:54] expression he said you know
[1:19:56] mom he said that's my you know grand
[1:19:58] grandma always said
[1:19:59] you give a cow enough rope and it'll
[1:20:01] hang itself
[1:20:05] and this is an awful big statement oh my
[1:20:09] i don't know over the weeks i just
[1:20:11] listened to this and again and again
[1:20:13] he said now look he said i don't want to
[1:20:14] be different with you but the things
[1:20:16] that can be
[1:20:17] scientifically proven is not real
[1:20:22] it's only the things that's not
[1:20:25] scientifically
[1:20:26] proven it's real
[1:20:32] so now we're separating between that of
[1:20:35] the tangible
[1:20:36] earth and then that of the supernatural
[1:20:41] i'm god and i change not but the world
[1:20:44] passes away is that right
[1:20:48] things temporal things that maybe you
[1:20:50] labored for and maybe you planted a
[1:20:52] you planted a beautiful plant you know
[1:20:54] out out in your yard and then now you
[1:20:56] know you're just going to hope you
[1:20:57] fertilized it right and
[1:20:58] you've got everything set up around it
[1:21:00] you're hoping that you've got the green
[1:21:02] thumb that
[1:21:02] something's happened about it that it
[1:21:04] actually makes it and survives and it
[1:21:06] might do good this year
[1:21:07] maybe they're going to do good next year
[1:21:09] at the lord terry's and then finally the
[1:21:10] next year
[1:21:11] something else comes along maybe a bug a
[1:21:13] parasite or some little mite gets upon
[1:21:16] it and it actually begins to take away
[1:21:18] from it
[1:21:18] and you think man what's going on you
[1:21:20] have invested in that
[1:21:21] but yet look at it it comes to a place
[1:21:24] that it wilts
[1:21:25] it dies but that's not so with god
[1:21:27] neither
[1:21:28] is it with your christian walk with god
[1:21:33] these things that we see these are
[1:21:36] temporal
[1:21:37] and they're perishable
[1:21:40] i mean look even even the ideas
[1:21:45] of man i mean
[1:21:50] what they used to put in the medical
[1:21:51] books
[1:21:53] if somebody got an infection drain them
[1:21:56] they didn't mourn drain many of them
[1:21:58] they killed them
[1:22:01] i don't have to ask brother scott i know
[1:22:03] better they don't they do not they do
[1:22:05] not still have that kind of stuff in
[1:22:06] medical books
[1:22:07] it might be part of history but they've
[1:22:09] learned from it
[1:22:12] but god is infinite
[1:22:16] god is infinite this is our resting
[1:22:18] place
[1:22:19] now think about this these are things
[1:22:21] brother brown would say we put so much
[1:22:23] emphasis
[1:22:24] and so much concern about the natural
[1:22:27] things
[1:22:28] and so little about this
[1:22:31] oh my now here's the scripture let me
[1:22:34] just look at a few scriptures
[1:22:35] for we walk by faith and not by sight
[1:22:41] our lives walk means to be regulated or
[1:22:44] occupied by faith
[1:22:47] you can't see faith you can't see love
[1:22:52] come on now you can't see personality
[1:22:55] all you see is manifestations of that
[1:22:59] come on these are the things life love
[1:23:01] personality the prophet pauline said
[1:23:03] these are things that are real but you
[1:23:06] can't go down to the store and buy them
[1:23:10] we walk by faith and not by sight many
[1:23:13] times listen to me
[1:23:14] give you an example the doctor can say
[1:23:17] they can look and say well you've got
[1:23:19] cancer
[1:23:20] there's no recovery for you brother
[1:23:23] branham picked it up to the holy spirit
[1:23:24] he said we can look and it says on the
[1:23:26] x-ray cancer
[1:23:28] they're right you got cancer but he said
[1:23:31] when god speaks
[1:23:33] and when god says but by my stripes you
[1:23:37] are healed
[1:23:37] he said then we forsake the flesh
[1:23:41] and walk after the
[1:23:45] this is where as a believer we have to
[1:23:47] walk in that place
[1:23:49] of discerning
[1:23:52] now let me just say like this i'm not
[1:23:54] going to come up here
[1:23:55] i think it's a traffic light up here i'm
[1:23:57] not going to come up to this traffic
[1:23:58] light and it's red and say
[1:24:00] you know what you think i ought to turn
[1:24:02] left here right now
[1:24:03] duh it's a red light are you with me
[1:24:08] now when it turns green it might be that
[1:24:11] all that the voice of god would say
[1:24:13] hold on a moment
[1:24:17] even though my eyes say go
[1:24:23] but god could give a warning because
[1:24:25] there might be somebody
[1:24:27] who's not paying attention
[1:24:32] god could give a warning in that way you
[1:24:35] understand what i'm saying so it just
[1:24:36] doesn't mean
[1:24:37] oh this is a red light i'm going to obey
[1:24:39] this as soon as the green light
[1:24:41] we're pulling out of it no it still
[1:24:44] comes to a place
[1:24:45] as a believer we are walking under his
[1:24:48] influence
[1:24:52] hebrews 11 6 but without faith it
[1:24:55] is impossible to please him for he that
[1:24:58] cometh to god
[1:25:00] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:25:02] rewarder of them
[1:25:03] that diligently seek him by faith look
[1:25:06] at this
[1:25:07] noah being warned of god
[1:25:11] of things not seen as yet moved with
[1:25:14] fear prepared an ark to the saving of
[1:25:17] his house by the which he condemned the
[1:25:19] world
[1:25:19] and became heir of the righteousness
[1:25:21] which is by faith
[1:25:28] we look not at the things that are seen
[1:25:32] but the things that are unseen
[1:25:37] noah builds a boat under inspiration
[1:25:40] from god
[1:25:41] a lot of other boats in that time but
[1:25:44] there was only one god constructed
[1:25:47] the other part of it is he didn't build
[1:25:49] it in a harbor
[1:25:53] that had the shipbuilders scratching
[1:25:55] their heads too
[1:25:58] they thought oh this man he's a prophet
[1:26:00] he's building it out here on dry land
[1:26:02] what he didn't understand it was not
[1:26:04] noah's job to get the boat to the water
[1:26:06] the water would come to the boat
[1:26:10] hallelujah amen our our commission is to
[1:26:14] stand
[1:26:15] on this word and god will see us through
[1:26:22] noah received a word from god you
[1:26:24] couldn't have looked it up in the
[1:26:25] dictionary
[1:26:27] webster did not even have rain in the
[1:26:30] dictionary
[1:26:32] it never rained then the earth was
[1:26:34] watered from the fountains of the deep
[1:26:39] so imagine rain what's this thing rain
[1:26:41] you're talking about
[1:26:43] he didn't just talk about it he preached
[1:26:44] about it inspiration
[1:26:48] came
[1:26:53] noah no doubt got up at times on his
[1:26:56] phone
[1:26:56] let's just bring it here as it was in
[1:26:58] the days of noah he got up
[1:27:00] and there were notifications going off
[1:27:03] proven
[1:27:05] no rain in the skies what does he do
[1:27:09] does he walk by the headline or does he
[1:27:12] walk
[1:27:12] by the revelation in his heart
[1:27:16] he's got a choice to make god is not
[1:27:19] going to make that choice for him
[1:27:20] he's got a choice
[1:27:24] so noah probably says clear
[1:27:28] the other day the next day he gets up
[1:27:30] and here comes
[1:27:32] this maybe this outlet he's subscribed
[1:27:34] to maybe they've always had
[1:27:35] balanced reporting and here they come
[1:27:38] with a headline
[1:27:39] and they come across they come across
[1:27:41] this time and here they come again
[1:27:42] it is proven by this scientist right
[1:27:45] here
[1:27:46] that there is no water up there
[1:27:49] so-called prophet says there
[1:27:52] is water up there in the sky and though
[1:27:56] it's gonna rain and this whole earth is
[1:27:58] going to be flooded
[1:28:02] i want you to understand they had there
[1:28:03] was a that was such a scientific
[1:28:06] civilization so much so the spirit of
[1:28:10] god would identify
[1:28:11] this time that we're living in as that
[1:28:13] time
[1:28:16] you understand there's nothing wrong
[1:28:17] with science but when science becomes
[1:28:19] first
[1:28:20] and god is second there's a problem
[1:28:24] science should never be ahead of god
[1:28:27] because if there wasn't no god there
[1:28:29] wouldn't be no science
[1:28:31] [Laughter]
[1:28:33] hallelujah now to think of this
[1:28:36] everything that came around
[1:28:37] i imagine noah probably said you know
[1:28:39] what
[1:28:40] i'm going to change the notifications on
[1:28:42] my phone brother aaron probably what he
[1:28:44] did is said i'm no longer going to be
[1:28:46] subscribed to this you know i think i'm
[1:28:47] going to do
[1:28:48] i am going to bring up the revelation
[1:28:50] that god gave to me
[1:28:51] when i wake up in the morning i'm going
[1:28:54] to have that come across as a
[1:28:55] notification
[1:28:56] thou art righteous thou art loved thou
[1:28:59] art beloved noah
[1:29:01] hallelujah
[1:29:04] i have seen the righteous he began to
[1:29:06] focus
[1:29:07] on those things and the rest of the
[1:29:10] world could look and know and say
[1:29:12] you're crazy you know why
[1:29:15] because there's nothing he could do to
[1:29:16] prove
[1:29:20] they could ask him give me a drop of
[1:29:21] this ring you're talking about
[1:29:23] i can't but pretty soon if there's going
[1:29:25] to be more than one drop for you
[1:29:29] he wasn't saying it arrogantly but he
[1:29:30] realized you see what it was to the rest
[1:29:32] of the world
[1:29:33] and they looked at it and said what is
[1:29:35] he talking about but look what it did
[1:29:37] for noah
[1:29:38] it stabilized him in the midst of that
[1:29:41] time
[1:29:42] where judgment was impending upon the
[1:29:44] world
[1:29:45] but yet noah was in contact with that
[1:29:48] which was more real
[1:29:49] than everything he could see around him
[1:29:52] he was in contact
[1:29:54] with the unseen realm brother that
[1:29:57] revelation
[1:29:58] it so grounded him
[1:30:01] [Applause]
[1:30:05] oh god remember
[1:30:08] remember who he was dealing with was not
[1:30:10] just people
[1:30:12] that was just out here and you know sons
[1:30:14] of ham no these were sons of seth
[1:30:17] that were coming up around him as well
[1:30:19] sons of seth
[1:30:21] now notice this these all died in faith
[1:30:24] not having received the promises
[1:30:26] but having seen them afar off and were
[1:30:29] persuaded of them
[1:30:31] and embraced them and confessed that
[1:30:32] they were strangers and pilgrims on
[1:30:34] earth what did that
[1:30:36] they came in contact with the unseen
[1:30:37] realm
[1:30:40] hebrews 11 27 by faith he
[1:30:44] forsook egypt talking about moses not
[1:30:47] fearing
[1:30:48] the wrath of the king now think of it
[1:30:53] he not only fled away from him but then
[1:30:55] when god
[1:30:56] god takes a hold of moses he tells him
[1:30:59] now go back
[1:31:03] no doubt his head was on the one on the
[1:31:05] wanted posters
[1:31:08] he had fled as a coward but god
[1:31:12] turns around and says now i want you to
[1:31:14] go back
[1:31:16] but he's going back for a purpose that
[1:31:19] the lead of people
[1:31:20] out he endured
[1:31:23] these are big words he endured as seeing
[1:31:27] him
[1:31:27] who is invisible you know what that says
[1:31:29] there was a lot of things he faced
[1:31:31] that he had to come through
[1:31:34] not before he met god but after he met
[1:31:37] god
[1:31:38] he had to endure a lot of things and the
[1:31:41] way that he faced them was because
[1:31:44] he had a connection with the invisible
[1:31:46] god
[1:31:48] it stabilized moses when pharaoh said
[1:31:51] i ain't letting them go every time
[1:31:53] remember how the word would come
[1:31:55] and pharaoh with it all of a sudden you
[1:31:57] know he would get under a religious
[1:31:59] anointing
[1:32:00] oh please moses pray take this away
[1:32:05] we'll we'll serve you we'll let them go
[1:32:08] we'll do this and about that time soon
[1:32:09] as god would lift it then what would
[1:32:11] happen pharaoh would move right back
[1:32:13] into being pharaoh
[1:32:14] that spirit was still there and here he
[1:32:16] would come right again
[1:32:18] it what was it it was opposition against
[1:32:21] the word of god
[1:32:22] it was not flesh the flesh of moses
[1:32:25] against the flesh of pharaoh these were
[1:32:28] two spiritual powers
[1:32:30] that were at force and at hand
[1:32:36] not flesh and blood but there was an
[1:32:38] anchor
[1:32:40] look how brother braham says this here
[1:32:42] in the message looking at the unseen
[1:32:44] when a man once catches
[1:32:48] that vision of the invisible god
[1:32:52] and knows that he's always present
[1:32:56] there is something that stabilizes that
[1:32:59] man's thinking
[1:33:01] aren't you glad it don't do away with
[1:33:05] our thinking but it stabilizes it
[1:33:08] our thinking could want to go this way
[1:33:10] but there's a stabilizer
[1:33:12] there's something that stabilizes that
[1:33:14] man's thinking it stabilizes
[1:33:17] his actions and in the time of distress
[1:33:21] and trouble it'll still
[1:33:24] make him look upward
[1:33:28] and above the things that are happening
[1:33:30] around him
[1:33:32] because he's looking at the unseen yet
[1:33:36] by promise
[1:33:39] stabilize it will make him look up he
[1:33:41] can look all around
[1:33:42] he can see things feel things things
[1:33:45] thoughts can come in his mind
[1:33:47] but the stabilizer oh my thank god for
[1:33:51] the stabilizer think about it
[1:33:53] when the prophet was standing there and
[1:33:55] remember how satan came up with his
[1:33:57] little baby his little girl
[1:33:59] god was going to take home his little
[1:34:01] sharon rose
[1:34:02] remember when the enemy came up to him
[1:34:04] and said look
[1:34:05] what you've done you went and prayed for
[1:34:07] the sick you went when you've been tired
[1:34:09] he laid out
[1:34:10] everything and remember and brother
[1:34:12] branham said i was about
[1:34:14] ready to say if that's the way it's
[1:34:17] going to be
[1:34:18] he said but at that time that thai post
[1:34:21] that new birth spoke out at the time
[1:34:24] oh glory be to god i'm thankful for the
[1:34:28] new birth
[1:34:29] i'm thankful for the seal that is the
[1:34:32] stabilizer
[1:34:35] if not for the stabilizer we would be
[1:34:38] bobbing all over the waves
[1:34:43] thank god for the stabilizer now you
[1:34:46] know like i talked to you last last week
[1:34:48] preached to you about the stabilizer's
[1:34:50] been put on the ship remember with those
[1:34:52] stabilizers
[1:34:53] they've got them that are fixed and then
[1:34:54] they've got those
[1:34:56] that they're actually automatically
[1:34:57] controlled you don't even know what's
[1:34:59] going
[1:35:00] on they've got those that work with like
[1:35:02] a bilge pump and things like that
[1:35:03] that actually can take that actually
[1:35:05] take care of so that when that
[1:35:07] ship is there upon the ocean that ship
[1:35:10] is not rolling from
[1:35:11] side to side that would be very
[1:35:14] uncomfortable first of all be very
[1:35:15] uncomfortable be on a cruise ship myself
[1:35:16] i think
[1:35:17] but anyhow it'd be very uncomfortable if
[1:35:19] you're sitting there and you've got
[1:35:20] maybe a lobster you're getting ready to
[1:35:22] cut into
[1:35:22] and all of a sudden you're up like this
[1:35:23] and your lobster's down here and then
[1:35:25] all of a sudden you're trying to eat
[1:35:26] right here
[1:35:26] it'd be very hard listen to me it'd be
[1:35:29] very hard
[1:35:30] to try to focus on the things of god if
[1:35:33] our life was not stable
[1:35:37] how could we focus on those things we
[1:35:40] would be looking for other things we
[1:35:41] would be saying
[1:35:42] hey man when in the world they're going
[1:35:44] to get this ship stable
[1:35:45] hey when's this going to happen and the
[1:35:47] captain radio radio's down and says let
[1:35:49] me tell you
[1:35:49] i got the greatest gown board this guy
[1:35:51] is working on it right now
[1:35:52] and this is what he said he said to
[1:35:54] replace this pump with this pump and
[1:35:56] this and that
[1:35:57] and then we'll have it up ready in a
[1:35:58] little bit and all of a sudden then
[1:35:59] we're sitting there
[1:36:00] we're rocking back and forth back and
[1:36:03] forth all of a sudden now the captain
[1:36:04] comes over and says
[1:36:05] uh check check check this guy right here
[1:36:07] says this has exceeded
[1:36:08] his knowledge and understanding he
[1:36:10] actually says we don't need to replace
[1:36:11] the pump
[1:36:12] we actually got to go over here and we
[1:36:14] got to take care of something in the
[1:36:15] hall
[1:36:16] and then after suddenly we're like oh my
[1:36:18] glad they have some experts here
[1:36:20] and the ship is still going back and
[1:36:22] forth
[1:36:23] back and forth and all of a sudden the
[1:36:25] captain gets on and says hey wait a
[1:36:26] minute here uh you know what we've just
[1:36:28] learned a little bit more here
[1:36:29] there's something else that's up front
[1:36:31] it's not a pump it's not something here
[1:36:33] it's this on up here
[1:36:34] about that time you would be looking at
[1:36:36] and saying wait a minute
[1:36:37] there seems to be no hope in this ship
[1:36:41] being stabilized
[1:36:46] that's why you want to get out of the
[1:36:48] ship a man and get in the ship of god
[1:36:52] manship is all based on his knowledge
[1:36:55] and understanding and
[1:36:56] we'll do this and we've got this expert
[1:36:57] and this will happen and this happened
[1:36:59] oh no that that's not going to work now
[1:37:00] we take that back we need to correct
[1:37:02] this
[1:37:02] but being in the ship of god it'll
[1:37:04] stabilize
[1:37:08] this is why the prophet if you don't
[1:37:09] mind me reading it to you look what he
[1:37:11] has said this is identified to us
[1:37:13] the stabilizers has been put on
[1:37:16] the ship well i'm glad for that aren't
[1:37:19] you
[1:37:20] i i wouldn't want to be here in this
[1:37:21] ship without stabilizers
[1:37:27] i've been out there fishing with brother
[1:37:28] dave junior and brother brother dave
[1:37:30] they've taken me out there fishing and
[1:37:32] i'm one of the first times here a few
[1:37:33] years ago it's been a while since i've
[1:37:34] been out there on the lake and they say
[1:37:35] hey you might need
[1:37:36] you know you think you might need to
[1:37:38] take one of these pills i don't know
[1:37:39] what they're called
[1:37:40] but one of them pills you know make you
[1:37:41] sleepy and everything else and you know
[1:37:43] so you don't get motion sickness i said
[1:37:45] you know i've been up i only got to
[1:37:46] sleep a couple hours let me just take
[1:37:48] one
[1:37:48] so i kind of sat in the back of the boat
[1:37:50] that day and it was already some waves i
[1:37:52] i mean that was going on you know and by
[1:37:54] the time i sat in the back of the boat
[1:37:55] we had we had a good time
[1:37:57] but i just sit there and you know just
[1:37:58] saw my you know i was about halfway out
[1:38:00] of it the second day it went
[1:38:02] out the very next day they said hey you
[1:38:04] want to take on them again i said no i
[1:38:05] don't want to take one i said i really
[1:38:06] i've never had to take
[1:38:08] one of those things before so i'm going
[1:38:09] to try to get out here
[1:38:11] and not take one now you know what it
[1:38:13] was if i would have taken one of those
[1:38:15] things it was to
[1:38:16] try to settle the sickness i hope you're
[1:38:19] listening to me
[1:38:20] it was to try to take take something and
[1:38:23] try to settle
[1:38:24] so that i could be calm that was out
[1:38:26] there but don't want to think about it
[1:38:28] friends
[1:38:28] even in this spiritual hour that we're
[1:38:31] in we don't want no
[1:38:32] something to calm us down we don't want
[1:38:34] to take something to calm us down
[1:38:36] we want to be settled in jesus christ
[1:38:43] you understand i'm not against medicine
[1:38:45] i hope you understand what i was saying
[1:38:46] on that
[1:38:47] but notice there's great fearful waves
[1:38:50] that are out here before us but we know
[1:38:54] just beyond that wave yonder we're
[1:38:56] nearing the shore
[1:38:57] look where the focus is taken from from
[1:38:59] the fearful waves
[1:39:00] to the shore just beyond that we're
[1:39:04] nearing the shore
[1:39:05] we're nearing the storm just stay stable
[1:39:08] just stay in the word
[1:39:09] stay with god no matter how you feel
[1:39:14] what anything else stay right with the
[1:39:16] word
[1:39:18] when you see all these great big old
[1:39:20] clouds around us
[1:39:21] and storms coming and atomic bombs and
[1:39:24] everything else
[1:39:25] they're talking about but our stabilizer
[1:39:30] is right straight in the world
[1:39:33] god said it would be here and we'll
[1:39:36] crest
[1:39:37] every one of them i'm reading from the
[1:39:40] prophet that is in the land of the bride
[1:39:44] amen oh we'll go right over the top of
[1:39:48] them yes
[1:39:48] indeed they can't sink us they can't
[1:39:50] drown us you can put us in the grave
[1:39:53] will come out again what's he talking
[1:39:54] he's talking about something
[1:39:56] that's deeper than our flesh
[1:40:00] because the enemy can come if he gets
[1:40:02] permission to attack our flesh
[1:40:04] but there's one thing he can't tamper
[1:40:05] with and that's the seal
[1:40:08] and he can't take our life until god
[1:40:10] permits him to do so
[1:40:13] and when god has permitted that remember
[1:40:15] death becomes our servant to pull us
[1:40:16] into the presence of god
[1:40:19] you put us in the grave we'll come out
[1:40:20] again that's all there is to it there
[1:40:22] ain't no way in the world
[1:40:23] to keep it down there we'll crest every
[1:40:25] one of them
[1:40:26] because our great chief captain is
[1:40:29] calling
[1:40:30] at the other side i want to focus on his
[1:40:34] voice don't you
[1:40:41] here stands gaza
[1:40:44] he's actually standing in a pretty good
[1:40:48] place
[1:40:50] he's walking with the prophet of god
[1:40:54] he's his servant
[1:40:57] but the difference is it wasn't just
[1:41:00] good enough to be close
[1:41:01] to the prophet of god because that
[1:41:05] didn't stabilize him but iran was
[1:41:09] in the right place to be stabilized
[1:41:13] you see what it was that caused gahey's
[1:41:16] trouble
[1:41:17] his fear was what he was looking at
[1:41:22] what he was looking at was causing his
[1:41:25] fear
[1:41:26] just as much as the peace that elisha
[1:41:29] had
[1:41:29] was coming from what he knew was there
[1:41:34] see it depends on what you're looking at
[1:41:38] hallelujah dehazel was looking at what
[1:41:41] was saint now you weren't going to talk
[1:41:42] him out of it
[1:41:43] but joe you would never you've never
[1:41:45] been a reason him out of it
[1:41:47] now he's not now you realize here there
[1:41:49] is
[1:41:50] you realize the scripture says that the
[1:41:51] angel of the lord encampeth around them
[1:41:53] the fear
[1:41:53] you had it was going to take more than
[1:41:55] just words because the prophet tells us
[1:41:57] gaza knew that scripture too but he said
[1:42:00] geheza only knew it as a church member
[1:42:02] he did not know it in the way that
[1:42:04] elisha knew it
[1:42:08] elisha knew it now remember elisha
[1:42:09] didn't see those angels
[1:42:12] he didn't see him but his confidence was
[1:42:14] in
[1:42:15] the god who he knew and had made the
[1:42:18] promise
[1:42:20] here's a surprise my goodness it'd be
[1:42:23] like waking up on monday morning
[1:42:24] and something happens and you think man
[1:42:27] we just had a wonderful time in the
[1:42:28] house of god
[1:42:29] my we just had a wonderful sunday and
[1:42:31] then all of a sudden these things
[1:42:32] begin to take place over the week and
[1:42:34] you think my goodness
[1:42:35] where in the world is all this coming
[1:42:37] from it's a surprise
[1:42:39] but it didn't take god by surprise i
[1:42:42] tell you the way that all these events
[1:42:44] have transpired it's taken us by
[1:42:45] surprise
[1:42:48] there's not one that had all this
[1:42:49] figured out i know there's a lot of guys
[1:42:51] that
[1:42:51] out there you'll see their posts on
[1:42:52] youtube and i predicted this and i
[1:42:54] predicted this and i
[1:43:00] you know always when somebody looks back
[1:43:02] on something it's always 20 20.
[1:43:08] but nobody predicted this nobody had saw
[1:43:11] that these different things
[1:43:13] were coming about within this manner and
[1:43:15] in this way
[1:43:17] but we do know it isn't that we need to
[1:43:19] know the details
[1:43:21] we know that trouble sometimes we are in
[1:43:26] we are living in these times in these
[1:43:29] hours
[1:43:30] now think about it dehaze his
[1:43:32] instability
[1:43:34] was because what he was looking at let
[1:43:35] me just tell it to you right now
[1:43:37] whatever you look at will either bring
[1:43:39] stability or instability
[1:43:41] what you focus on will bring anxiety or
[1:43:44] peace
[1:43:45] what you focus on will either bring
[1:43:47] faith or to bring doubt
[1:43:50] what you focus on will cause an
[1:43:54] atmosphere to be created
[1:43:57] you either have courage or you'll have
[1:43:59] worry
[1:44:01] and worry is not part of the kingdom of
[1:44:04] god
[1:44:08] but you see god didn't bring those
[1:44:09] angels down
[1:44:11] they were there already he just had to
[1:44:14] change
[1:44:16] the seeing of his servant when he could
[1:44:20] change the seeing of his servant
[1:44:23] and hazel's eyes would come open
[1:44:26] elisha was no more stabilized
[1:44:29] be after than he was before but gaza
[1:44:33] became stabilized afterwards
[1:44:37] i don't know about you but there's been
[1:44:38] many situations
[1:44:40] that we can come in contact with and we
[1:44:42] don't know exactly lord what do we do
[1:44:45] god doesn't tell us everything look at
[1:44:48] this example right here
[1:44:50] god would tell them here comes the
[1:44:51] syrian army here comes the syrian army
[1:44:53] here comes the syrian army
[1:44:54] and then this comes about what are they
[1:44:56] going to do what if elisha
[1:44:58] listen to me what if elisha would have
[1:45:00] said oh my goodness
[1:45:01] i wonder if i've done something i wonder
[1:45:02] if something's wrong in my life
[1:45:04] i wonder if something's out of step
[1:45:06] because god didn't tell me and here they
[1:45:07] come around me like this
[1:45:09] no his confidence was not because god
[1:45:12] had told him this point
[1:45:13] this point this point you see faith is
[1:45:16] being
[1:45:16] built in the living god that he's the
[1:45:20] ever
[1:45:20] present god not that i have to know
[1:45:24] what's going on
[1:45:25] know what he's doing or know that i
[1:45:27] don't have to know that
[1:45:28] he's an ever-present help in the time of
[1:45:30] trouble
[1:45:32] glory be to god look at this the angels
[1:45:34] of the lord encamp to wrap thou around
[1:45:36] about them that fear him
[1:45:38] and deliver them that's for you and me
[1:45:41] when the great has come which always
[1:45:44] does
[1:45:46] then gahesa being just a lukewarm church
[1:45:48] member he had not seen what elijah had
[1:45:50] seen
[1:45:51] and elijah was used to walking by faith
[1:45:54] and he was looking at the unseen all the
[1:45:58] time
[1:46:00] what a testimony how many say lord help
[1:46:02] that to be my testimony
[1:46:04] i want to look at the unseen all the
[1:46:06] time
[1:46:10] amen and he knew that god had said in
[1:46:12] the psalms
[1:46:13] the angels of god are encamped about
[1:46:15] those who fear him
[1:46:17] that was enough for elijah
[1:46:21] oh glory think of this i want you just
[1:46:24] to think of this and consider this
[1:46:26] the bible speaks that where we are
[1:46:30] dwelling
[1:46:31] in the body of jesus christ in the book
[1:46:33] of hebrews chapter 12
[1:46:35] that there is an innumerable
[1:46:39] company of angels
[1:46:42] that in numeral means cannot be counted
[1:46:47] let me just tell you they're not just
[1:46:49] here in this building
[1:46:53] there's not open spaces hope you don't
[1:46:56] bother you
[1:46:57] these angels aren't wearing masks these
[1:47:00] angels aren't social distancing
[1:47:04] they're filling every place in this room
[1:47:10] they're not just here they don't just
[1:47:13] they're not just right here
[1:47:14] when we're here the angels of god are
[1:47:17] encamped
[1:47:18] about your life
[1:47:22] when you walk into walmart target or
[1:47:25] wherever you go
[1:47:27] you're not alone first of all he said
[1:47:31] i'll never leave you nor forsake you but
[1:47:34] the other part about it is
[1:47:36] is that you've got a host the host of
[1:47:39] angels
[1:47:39] is all around
[1:47:43] oh may god help us to be more connected
[1:47:46] with that unseen realm
[1:47:48] to walk under that influence of the
[1:47:50] unseen rail
[1:47:51] because what these eyes can see what
[1:47:53] these ears can hear
[1:47:54] brother if we allow that to be the focus
[1:47:57] it
[1:47:58] brings instability
[1:48:01] think of how the scripture would say in
[1:48:03] psalms 91
[1:48:04] 9 because thou hast made the lord
[1:48:09] which is my refuge even the most high
[1:48:13] thy habitation there shall no
[1:48:16] evil befall thee neither
[1:48:20] shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
[1:48:24] for he shall give his angels charge
[1:48:27] over thee to keep thee in all thy
[1:48:31] ways remember there were those plagues
[1:48:36] in time of egypt
[1:48:37] that god after about the third one came
[1:48:39] along that's when god started saying i'm
[1:48:41] going to make a difference this plague
[1:48:42] would come
[1:48:43] next one i'm going to make a difference
[1:48:44] that my plague would come i'm going to
[1:48:46] make a difference
[1:48:47] god made the difference for he
[1:48:50] shall give his angels charge
[1:48:54] over thee to keep thee in all thy ways
[1:48:57] they shall bear thee up in their hands
[1:48:59] lest
[1:49:00] thou dash thy foot against a stone
[1:49:06] accompanied about with the angels of god
[1:49:10] what a stability i don't know about you
[1:49:14] when i read back over this this is
[1:49:16] something i'm aware of
[1:49:20] it's something we are aware of you
[1:49:22] realize
[1:49:23] brother branham i think brother brown
[1:49:24] was asked questions like in the he would
[1:49:26] he would
[1:49:27] tell us a question that he was put
[1:49:28] before him in the message be certain of
[1:49:30] god
[1:49:30] and somebody asked him brother branham
[1:49:32] aren't you afraid to go to the platform
[1:49:34] at night
[1:49:35] aren't you afraid that maybe that the
[1:49:37] angel of the lord won't be there
[1:49:39] and you're facing them demons and that
[1:49:40] diseases he said no i'm not afraid at
[1:49:42] all
[1:49:43] he said because my confidence is he
[1:49:46] promised
[1:49:51] he promised he would be there
[1:49:56] hallelujah there was a confidence it
[1:49:59] wasn't that he always seen him there
[1:50:01] the confidence was the word he knew
[1:50:04] that he was present think about how
[1:50:07] brother branham
[1:50:08] when he talked about going down to the
[1:50:10] down to the platform there
[1:50:11] in the houston coliseum when he walked
[1:50:14] down there
[1:50:14] remember what he said he said the angels
[1:50:18] lined the aisles
[1:50:21] brother walked right down to the state
[1:50:23] sister meaty brother ram talks about
[1:50:26] hundreds of ushers were there sister
[1:50:28] meaty
[1:50:29] when they have her you know talking to
[1:50:30] her on the testimony she said there
[1:50:32] wasn't that many ushers there
[1:50:34] she said what it was he was looking into
[1:50:36] an unseen realm
[1:50:38] the angels of god were right there as he
[1:50:42] walked down to the platform
[1:50:45] brother that was not just for the
[1:50:46] prophet of god elijah said
[1:50:49] there are more with us
[1:50:53] then there are against us
[1:50:56] [Applause]
[1:50:57] hallelujah we're not alone
[1:51:05] even if you should dash your foot
[1:51:06] against the stone even if you should
[1:51:08] stumble
[1:51:09] oh my to think the angels of god are
[1:51:12] there to bear you up
[1:51:13] to encourage you you're on this ladder
[1:51:17] brother
[1:51:17] brother braham said you are stuck
[1:51:19] between god and christ
[1:51:21] [Laughter]
[1:51:22] we're on this ladder and angels are
[1:51:24] there
[1:51:26] all day like the song said all day all
[1:51:28] night angels
[1:51:30] watching over me my lord
[1:51:34] glory be to god does that mean that well
[1:51:36] you know
[1:51:37] elisha was not walking around you know
[1:51:39] and just
[1:51:40] you know arrogantly that's not what
[1:51:41] elisha was doing that's not what it does
[1:51:43] for us as believers
[1:51:44] it stabilizes us
[1:51:48] it stabilizes us
[1:51:52] may god help us let's just we'll just
[1:51:53] settle down here
[1:51:55] there's more i would whole lot more i
[1:51:56] want to preach on but there when we look
[1:51:59] at these things
[1:52:00] and what we see around us it depends on
[1:52:03] what we look at
[1:52:05] is what will dominate us
[1:52:10] now you might look at things and say
[1:52:15] this is true it's a law it's really hard
[1:52:18] to find a lot of truth out there
[1:52:21] are you with me it's really hard
[1:52:26] but those 10 spies that went over there
[1:52:28] and they surveyed the land
[1:52:31] when they talked about them giants that
[1:52:33] wasn't a headline
[1:52:36] it was to them are you with me
[1:52:40] they looked at that and what they saw
[1:52:43] that wasn't imagination
[1:52:46] that wasn't something that all of a
[1:52:47] sudden somebody came back the next day
[1:52:49] and said you know what
[1:52:50] they really weren't about eight and nine
[1:52:51] foot or they were almost more or less
[1:52:53] about like five
[1:52:54] eight i think we just were kind of
[1:52:56] looking at it the wrong way no
[1:52:58] what what they were they were giants
[1:53:02] what they were looking at was real
[1:53:05] but caleb and joshua
[1:53:09] was looking at the unseen
[1:53:13] and i want you to watch kangalup and
[1:53:16] joshua looking at the unseen
[1:53:17] it stabilized him
[1:53:22] the others they looked at what they
[1:53:24] could see
[1:53:28] and it brought fear i tell you friends
[1:53:31] there's enough things all around here
[1:53:33] that for you if you focus on it it can
[1:53:35] bring fear
[1:53:36] it can bring instability it can bring
[1:53:39] anxiety it can bring a lot and listen
[1:53:41] i'm not just talking about
[1:53:42] what has been taking place i'm talking
[1:53:44] about all across the board
[1:53:52] i often wonder after this thing right
[1:53:54] here will things ever settle back in
[1:53:56] among people
[1:53:59] right will you ever be able to cough in
[1:54:02] a store again will you ever be able to
[1:54:03] sneeze will you ever be able to
[1:54:05] you know get closer yeah i really i
[1:54:07] wonder that
[1:54:09] because think of what's happened so much
[1:54:11] right now
[1:54:13] the person coughs a person's needs a
[1:54:14] person there's a person
[1:54:18] and you might as well be honest with
[1:54:20] enough if you you dwell on it enough
[1:54:22] your flesh can get to looking at that oh
[1:54:24] my goodness
[1:54:29] but this is where we want to be in
[1:54:30] contact with the unseen realm
[1:54:34] when we walk out our door when we go to
[1:54:37] the different places
[1:54:38] we want to be under that influence
[1:54:44] lord help me lord watch over me lord
[1:54:46] protect me
[1:54:48] hey listen as many times as i can drive
[1:54:50] a certain place on the roadway
[1:54:51] i don't just take it for granted the
[1:54:53] lord help me
[1:54:54] maybe i'm coming over here to the church
[1:54:56] lord will you watch over me today
[1:54:58] even when i'm getting ready to go into
[1:54:59] my job and no matter how many times i
[1:55:01] had taught division or fractions i asked
[1:55:03] god lord help me today
[1:55:05] help the children lord that they would
[1:55:07] be able to have understanding help me to
[1:55:08] be able to relay the concept
[1:55:10] help me to be sensitive to this lord
[1:55:12] it's not just taking things for granted
[1:55:15] but it's asking for his leadership
[1:55:18] to live under the influence of the
[1:55:22] unseen realm
[1:55:23] let me just say this to you if you've
[1:55:25] not ever come in contact with that
[1:55:27] to where your life has been completely
