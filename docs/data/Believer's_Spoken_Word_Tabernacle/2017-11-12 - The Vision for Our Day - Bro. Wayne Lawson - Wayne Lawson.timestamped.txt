[45:34] me all the doors yes Lou and more bad I
[45:39] need is to be with
[45:45] amen
[45:50] your boys Godspeed and like rain washing
[46:02] my eyes to see your majesty to be still
[46:09] and know that you're in this place
[46:15] please let me stay
[46:19] in
[46:23] of God's grace O Lord as the brothers
[46:32] would come we want to go right into the
[46:34] lift in the mission offering this
[46:36] morning I don't want to take too much
[46:37] time away from the word of the Lord we
[46:39] certainly had us a wonderful time
[46:41] last night in the presence of God amen
[46:45] and to know that the Word of God is the
[46:48] word will not return back to him void
[46:50] and you know it just is one of those
[46:53] things that sometimes the Lord is so
[46:55] personal and so direct to maybe call out
[46:59] a need or a situation in your life and
[47:01] then there's other times where God knows
[47:03] it but he won't necessarily say it word
[47:05] by word but there's the current of the
[47:09] Holy Spirit coming by way of the word
[47:10] and if we yield to that it'll lift us
[47:14] then to where we're actually able to see
[47:17] things that we really have need of but
[47:20] we can't see it when we're there in that
[47:24] wonderful because we're made to see
[47:27] things not from this earthly realm but
[47:29] were born and made to see things from a
[47:32] heavenly realm David said in Psalms 27
[47:35] when the Lord has set me upon this rock
[47:37] he said now now is my head lifted up and
[47:42] I can see all of this around me God's
[47:45] sovereign grace that moves for us to be
[47:47] able to see the things in the way that
[47:50] we need to see in amen Lord willing next
[47:52] next week next Sunday I'll take a little
[47:55] bit of time before the service and just
[47:58] two or before I'm minister and just
[48:01] share some things with you from the
[48:02] Philippines from the visitor and so you
[48:05] get to see some things as well as some
[48:06] things that are upon our heart that may
[48:09] be and if the Lord will allow us to
[48:11] actually get behind as an assembly on
[48:14] top of everything on top of the other
[48:16] things that we're doing as well and Lord
[48:19] willing as well next Sunday I have a
[48:21] stack of the things of Earth Paul sent
[48:24] over regarding the Spanish translation
[48:26] that's going on it has within there I'll
[48:29] have them out there next week it
[48:31] the the point and focus with it is it
[48:34] goes through and it gives you a little
[48:35] bit of a background on those who are
[48:37] actually translating the message into
[48:40] Spanish so you can kind of read a little
[48:42] bit within behind them catching that
[48:44] that burden and knowing that they're
[48:45] translating but that part of it that God
[48:48] has helped us to be able to be able to
[48:51] do in a small way is just to support the
[48:53] printing part of it that that would that
[48:56] would go forth of what they're
[48:57] translating that it gets out into the
[48:59] hands of the people so let's just let's
[49:02] just pray that that God would also would
[49:05] be merciful I also want you to keep in
[49:07] mind there's a situation that has taken
[49:09] place some of you don't aren't aware of
[49:11] it but with current news and things like
[49:13] that there is you remember some months
[49:16] ago that the the government of russia
[49:18] had rose up to where that it has been
[49:21] it's been about five six months ago the
[49:22] where that they actually had made a
[49:23] statement the where that they are
[49:25] eliminating everything to where it's
[49:27] just they want state recognized churches
[49:30] and they had declared even at that time
[49:32] that Jehovah Witness to be a cult and so
[49:35] you know where all those things lead to
[49:36] there's actually been a stoppage of
[49:38] books just some brothers had shared it
[49:41] with me of the day there's been a
[49:42] stoppage where they stopped some books
[49:44] of the message and tapes that have come
[49:46] into the country and right now they're
[49:49] looking into it if because if the
[49:50] government of russia declares that to be
[49:54] a cult and be out of line then they're
[49:57] gonna bail confiscate the churches and
[49:59] everything that is associated with a
[50:01] message it's all in God's hands
[50:05] and we just we want we want we know this
[50:09] is that there's not one thing can
[50:11] advance beyond God's timing and we're
[50:14] needs to advance so let's just would you
[50:16] keep that situation in prayer be be
[50:19] prayerful with that so let's just look
[50:21] to the Lord in prayer this morning
[50:23] Heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are
[50:26] dear God for thee the opportunity Lord
[50:29] that you have given us to be able to

[51:52] the visitors that were able to be here
[51:54] with us we certainly enjoyed you being
[51:56] here with us and trust that you just
[51:58] have been refreshed and amen and we're
[52:00] looking for the for the Lord just to
[52:02] come by our way once again this morning
[52:04] and to speak to us what MA we'd be so
[52:08] miserable if we came here without
[52:10] expectation you know but when we come
[52:12] here with an expectation from the Lord
[52:14] week we can have that confidence that
[52:16] God is going to speak to us you know
[52:19] sometimes there's things that God will
[52:20] say that it might be things that we have
[52:22] we know and we can go right down we can
[52:25] go right down the line you might be able
[52:26] to finish the quote or the scripture
[52:28] afterwards but that's not that's not why
[52:29] we're here in church we're here that we
[52:32] can have that discernment of the Lord to
[52:34] say Lord where is this at in my life
[52:37] where can I receive help how does this
[52:39] fit how does this apply to me Lord where
[52:42] do I fit within this because this is
[52:44] truly an hour of divine placement by the
[52:47] Spirit of God in that true amen so we
[52:51] have that that confidence that God is
[52:53] moving
[52:53] and working amen right here amen to do
[52:56] what he alone can do I want to say also
[53:00] the brothers they were in here this week
[53:02] and they took full advantage of us not
[53:04] being here on Thursday and they sanded
[53:08] down and brother Richie put both of
[53:10] these sets of windows in and they sanded
[53:12] down they painted the sanctuary I think
[53:14] they have one more place maybe back in
[53:16] the back here that they have to paint
[53:17] but I think they did just a wonderful
[53:19] job don't you really we reach Thrones we
[53:28] certainly appreciate that amen let's
[53:30] just let's stand if we could and we'll
[53:32] just just invite brother Wayne to come

[55:03] amen when we amen we're going our own
[55:07] ways and doing our own thing but God who
[55:09] is rich in mercy huh
[55:11] I appreciate that scripture as Paul
[55:13] wrote it that we were dead in sins and
[55:16] trespasses but God but God who is
[55:19] Richard mercy He Man I'm so glad that he
[55:22] spoke to our lives and this morning

[55:35] you for your your support and their pool
[55:38] for the word of the Lord and and we just
[55:41] I tell you Sunday mornings to be
[55:44] honestly it's my favorite service of the
[55:45] week I enjoy Sunday morning service amen
[55:49] and it's always a blessing I I didn't
[55:51] recognize last night that we have
[55:54] brother Jerry with us god bless you both
[55:56] it's been a long time god bless you it's
[55:58] good to see you man my I don't know how
[56:04] long it's been but it's it's been a few
[56:06] years 14 15 years amen
[56:09] yeah and so it's just been a real
[56:11] pleasure to see you again god bless you
[56:13] and amen and so we won't - this morning
[56:16] if we can to turn to the book of John
[56:19] and we're going to look in the fifth
[56:21] chapter here you know that this is the
[56:25] this is the scripture here where Jesus
[56:28] has been at the Pool of Bethesda and he
[56:35] done a strange thing he healed one man
[56:38] there was a lot of people there at the
[56:41] pool they just healed one man and then
[56:44] the scripture says that he tells him to
[56:47] take up his bed and walk
[56:48] and on top of that this is a Sabbath day
[56:53] so it's a little bit questionable again
[56:56] of why he's healing on the Sabbath and
[56:58] if you study the scripture you know it's
[57:00] amazing that Jesus actually does seven
[57:02] miracles on seven
[57:03] Savas so he was always upsetting the the
[57:07] cart for the for the legal assigned he
[57:10] was just tearing up their thoughts and
[57:11] and but in the in the seventeenth verse
[57:15] we find that they're they're asking
[57:17] Jesus and Jesus answers and he says but
[57:22] jesus answered them saying my father
[57:25] worketh hitherto and I work therefore
[57:30] the Jews sought the more to kill him
[57:33] because not had only he had broken the
[57:36] Sabbath but said also that God was his
[57:39] father making himself equal with God
[57:43] then answered Jesus and said unto them
[57:46] verily verily I say unto you the son can
[57:51] do nothing of himself but what he seeth
[57:54] the father doeth for that things
[57:57] whatsoever he doeth these also doeth the
[58:02] son likewise a man let's just bow our
[58:06] hearts this morning Heavenly Father
[58:08] we're so thankful today for the word
[58:11] that you have given and Lord we're just
[58:13] asking you this morning that your
[58:16] presence Lord would just fill the room
[58:19] today Lord the hearts and the lives that
[58:22] have gathered here under your word may
[58:24] you touch them if there's one here today
[58:27] that don't know you lord I pray that you
[58:30] would be merciful to them father if
[58:33] there's some here today that have been
[58:35] distant in their relationship I pray
[58:37] that they would draw nigh to you today I
[58:40] ask you Father for your children that
[58:43] have gathered in this meeting today that
[58:45] may you give them the bread of life may
[58:48] you feed them Lord the the meat that's
[58:50] in due season and may you strengthen
[58:52] their resolve to serve you and love you
[58:55] and I pray that you build them up in the
[58:57] faith of God I ask you today Lord that
[59:00] you would heal the sick Lauren that you
[59:02] would touch them in their bodies that
[59:03] have need and we ask that you would
[59:05] bless them bless they hear of your word
[59:07] today father we'll commit this service
[59:10] into your hands asking you for these
[59:13] things in the name of Jesus Christ our
[59:15] Lord we pray
[59:16] a man and a man and and may God bless
[59:20] you as you be seated today I want to to
[59:23] speak to you on this portion of
[59:26] Scripture and if I would title the the
[59:28] sermon today I want to speak to you upon
[59:31] a vision for our day a vision for our
[59:35] day and and I've just just some things
[59:39] here that I appreciate the Lord for what
[59:43] he's done in our generation and we thank
[59:46] God for the word that has been delivered
[59:48] in in our time and and what God has done
[59:51] in other ages is wonderful and we love
[59:53] to talk about it but there's something
[59:56] special about seeing what had God is
[59:58] doing in your generation and and to see
[1:00:01] what what part you're playing I was just
[1:00:05] looking at the scriptures and realizing
[1:00:07] that many times I don't know if we
[1:00:11] always think about it but but the the
[1:00:14] Bible itself is actually of look of
[1:00:17] visions many of the things that you read
[1:00:18] in the Bible is actually visions and
[1:00:21] either it was visions of that time or
[1:00:23] visions of the future and so but but the
[1:00:26] Bible itself is a book of visions and
[1:00:28] it's the answer that Jesus is giving to
[1:00:31] the people that was asking him about his
[1:00:34] healing on the Sabbath and about him
[1:00:36] healing this man and and when they start
[1:00:38] asking him his answer to them is that I
[1:00:41] see it with my father then I do it so
[1:00:44] he's letting them know that his actual
[1:00:46] ministry was a ministry of vision so
[1:00:49] Jesus wasn't just doing whatever thing
[1:00:52] that he wanted to do with the power of
[1:00:54] God he was using the power of God to
[1:00:57] fulfill a vision or the will of God that
[1:01:00] was set forth in his life now maybe
[1:01:03] sometimes you know you hear people say
[1:01:05] well if Jesus if God is alive and he and
[1:01:08] he heals the sick we'll go down to the
[1:01:09] hospital in E all the hospitals program
[1:01:11] said you've got to be careful with that
[1:01:13] because you see that there's never been
[1:01:15] a ministry in the Bible that used the
[1:01:19] power of God at their wheel it was
[1:01:21] always the will of God that controlled
[1:01:23] the power if you see that Jesus that was
[1:01:26] the proposition that to him he said cast
[1:01:28] yourself down
[1:01:29] you up again he propositioned him to use
[1:01:33] the power of God for his own weal and so
[1:01:35] what we find is that there is a wheel or
[1:01:38] there is a vision and that vision is the
[1:01:41] is the purpose of God for the generation
[1:01:43] or the time that someone lives or what
[1:01:46] it is that they're doing so so when I
[1:01:48] start finding that the Scriptures are
[1:01:50] some strange things happening and
[1:01:52] they're strange things that we believe
[1:01:54] today is odd to the to the natural mind
[1:01:56] but as Jesus said in that day it's
[1:01:59] because of the vision that we have and
[1:02:01] that vision has come from the father so
[1:02:04] that so the Bible itself is a book of
[1:02:07] visions and and if you sometimes you
[1:02:10] think about our Lord when when the
[1:02:12] strange things that he would do and and
[1:02:14] you look at this generation of the
[1:02:16] strange things that's happening but it's
[1:02:18] because of the vision of God when when
[1:02:21] you look in the Bible and you think
[1:02:22] about how that the Scripture speaks of
[1:02:25] visions and and I'll just say maybe like
[1:02:28] this sometimes things happen differently
[1:02:30] than then that we think they ought to
[1:02:32] happen but if it's if it's within the
[1:02:35] vision of God when Jesus just described
[1:02:37] one action maybe that he had when when
[1:02:40] can you imagine one of you being great
[1:02:43] friends with Christ and he eats at the
[1:02:45] house of Mary Martha very very commonly
[1:02:48] and I can imagine that there was times
[1:02:50] that Lazarus would sit there and hear
[1:02:52] the stories and he would speak to them
[1:02:54] on a personal level being friends and
[1:02:57] one day Jesus has gone from the house
[1:02:59] and and Lazarus fall sick and Mary
[1:03:02] Martha think immediately we're we're
[1:03:04] friends with the Prophet we'll just send
[1:03:06] word and he'll come here and he'll
[1:03:08] Lazarus and everything's going to be
[1:03:09] okay but when the word went to Jesus
[1:03:12] that Lazarus was sick rather than him
[1:03:14] coming he turned and went a four-day
[1:03:17] journey from the problem looking like
[1:03:20] that he was walking away from the
[1:03:22] problem hey man but do you see but the
[1:03:25] reason that he did it is because that
[1:03:27] there was a vision of a resurrection
[1:03:30] amen and and if Jesus had have been
[1:03:33] there that would have been no death but
[1:03:35] he had to he had to make a journey and
[1:03:37] go away that that that death could come
[1:03:39] that when he returned that
[1:03:42] could show the power of Resurrection and
[1:03:44] the amazing that Jesus was never late
[1:03:47] but when he when he came remember that
[1:03:49] Martha began to tell him lord if you
[1:03:51] would have been here my brother wouldn't
[1:03:52] died and and Jesus said but Martha even
[1:03:55] even now and we know the troubles is
[1:03:58] there but but I am the resurrection and
[1:04:00] the life and and when Christ was
[1:04:03] standing there remember remember the the
[1:04:06] way that Martha when she would have
[1:04:09] spoke to him Lord I know he'll raise up
[1:04:11] in the last day but Jesus was trying to
[1:04:13] to make sure they understood that he was
[1:04:16] the resurrection not that he was going
[1:04:19] to be coming but that he is the
[1:04:21] resurrection amen and and he said to
[1:04:25] them he meant that Martha even now right
[1:04:28] now all I have to do is call for his
[1:04:30] life and you remember the scripture that
[1:04:32] he actually says to him with a loud
[1:04:34] voice Lazarus come forth amen and and so
[1:04:38] because of the vision the way that Jesus
[1:04:40] follows the vision they're able to see
[1:04:43] that he is the resurrection they're
[1:04:46] they're able to see that because of the
[1:04:48] vision because of the way that he did it
[1:04:50] now they're going to see that he's the
[1:04:52] master over corruption is that right
[1:04:55] amen corruption had already set in on
[1:04:58] the body had had corruption not Citian
[1:05:00] they would not know he was the master of
[1:05:02] it but because corruption had set him it
[1:05:05] was in the vision that not only would
[1:05:08] last was rise but Martha would know that
[1:05:11] God had the power over corruption amen
[1:05:14] and Jesus could not not not only is his
[1:05:17] Lazarus already corrupted but he's
[1:05:19] already a four-day journey from the body
[1:05:21] he meant so so you see there has to be
[1:05:24] an anointing under that vision that
[1:05:27] could bring life back to the body it
[1:05:29] could bring a man who's for days gone
[1:05:31] from the body and bring him back into
[1:05:34] that into that body he meant all at the
[1:05:37] spoken word all because Christ called
[1:05:39] for it to happen can you imagine what it
[1:05:42] was like down there in paradise when
[1:05:44] Lazarus heard the call of the Lord that
[1:05:47] he's to come back to that body he meant
[1:05:49] everybody else sitting around him there
[1:05:51] was other people there that he
[1:05:53] even been fellowship maybe his old
[1:05:55] friends and everything he said y'all
[1:05:57] I hear the master calling and they did
[1:06:00] not hear what he heard because it was
[1:06:03] not a time for a general resurrection
[1:06:06] but it was a time for a name calling hey
[1:06:09] men that one name would be called and
[1:06:11] that it would answer the Masters call it
[1:06:13] was in the vision Amen that there would
[1:06:16] not be just a general resurrection but
[1:06:19] that would be a one-man resurrection
[1:06:21] because you see the things that were
[1:06:23] done in that time in that vision was
[1:06:26] only putting a shadow of things that was
[1:06:29] going to be happening in other ages they
[1:06:31] meant that that would come a time that
[1:06:33] it would not be a general resurrection
[1:06:35] amen but that will be an individual
[1:06:38] resurrection in the last days it will
[1:06:40] not be everybody raising from the dead
[1:06:42] but it'll be them whose names are being
[1:06:44] called is that right so so you can see
[1:06:46] that Christ by vision was doing the will
[1:06:50] of God that he might show forth his
[1:06:52] power that he might show forth what he
[1:06:55] was and what he does in written in the
[1:06:57] Bible that there's coming a time that he
[1:06:59] will show forth who is the only king of
[1:07:01] kings and the Lord of lords hidden in it
[1:07:04] spoken of that there was coming a time
[1:07:07] that he was show that he is God and I
[1:07:09] believe that the Bible said in the last
[1:07:12] days he would reveal himself as the son
[1:07:14] of man he would reveal himself in the
[1:07:16] evening time people said by the way why
[1:07:18] is it got so bad why is the trouble the
[1:07:21] way it is why is the situation's of the
[1:07:23] world how did God ever let it get like
[1:07:25] it is now he had to show forth who is
[1:07:28] the only king of kings and the Lord of
[1:07:31] lords and the god of might until all of
[1:07:33] the revival is gone and the
[1:07:35] denominational world you don't recognize
[1:07:37] the revival that God has brought by this
[1:07:40] message payment but he's the master of
[1:07:42] corruption he said I'll not leave your
[1:07:44] soul in hell and I will not leave you in
[1:07:47] corruption but there's come a word in
[1:07:49] this generation by vision Amen the call
[1:07:52] us out of the dead dark
[1:07:54] denominationalism
[1:07:55] and bring us back because he's the
[1:07:57] master of the corruption he's the one
[1:08:00] who can overcome it and bring us out
[1:08:02] into life and I think God this morning
[1:08:04] Haven some of my family didn't hear the
[1:08:07] voice and and some of my friends didn't
[1:08:09] hear the voice but I heard my name my
[1:08:12] name called the master called me and I
[1:08:15] come out of the grave and when I come
[1:08:17] forth but I I want you to know this
[1:08:19] morning God was not just satisfied with
[1:08:21] Lazarus coming to life he meant but it
[1:08:24] was also in the vision that he would be
[1:08:26] loosed is that right Lusine and let it
[1:08:30] go though there's a vision concerning
[1:08:32] Lazarus that was a type of it concerning
[1:08:35] you that this generation this bride has
[1:08:38] come out of dark denominationalism will
[1:08:40] not just come out to sit in a message
[1:08:42] pew and be abound continue and live your
[1:08:45] life under the jealousies and ideas and
[1:08:48] businesses and churchianity
[1:08:50] Amen I think it's time maybe that we
[1:08:52] come face to face with the reality that
[1:08:55] something is paulus to life and and
[1:08:57] whatever that is that brought us a lie
[1:08:59] Amen it's not animation that she would
[1:09:02] be bound up this morning remember the
[1:09:04] vision says she will be loosed and be
[1:09:07] set free haven of all the great closer I
[1:09:10] pray God this morning but like whatever
[1:09:12] it is has bound up your life and the
[1:09:15] Holy Ghost were coming this meeting this
[1:09:17] morning and bags you by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:20] that you can rejoice and you can enjoy
[1:09:23] the things of God I don't believe
[1:09:25] Christianity is just a bunch of humdrum
[1:09:27] and and barely making it and we're
[1:09:29] barely getting by Oh bless God pastor
[1:09:32] we're we're barely making it these days
[1:09:34] listen I believe that there's a power of
[1:09:37] God that's in the Church of the Living
[1:09:38] God and we're not just merely Amen but I
[1:09:41] believe somebody's going back into glory
[1:09:44] we're not returning to heaven in defeat
[1:09:46] Adam and Eve left in defeat but we're
[1:09:50] returning in victory as a vision of you
[1:09:53] this morning in victory and power and
[1:09:55] reality or I tell you it's time to lose
[1:09:58] some
[1:09:59] let him go amen I believe that don't you
[1:10:03] if you're married to somebody and they
[1:10:04] had to repent and they come back to the
[1:10:07] Lord Amen don't know don't hold them to
[1:10:09] that the rest of their life lose some
[1:10:11] and let them go let let the Spirit of
[1:10:13] God come over their lives let him enjoy
[1:10:15] the fellowship of the Lord and and let
[1:10:18] them come in and rejoice and the power
[1:10:20] of God I'll tell you this morning I
[1:10:22] believe there's a vision of a powerful
[1:10:25] church a church alive a church with
[1:10:29] movement Amen if it's dead bury it hey
[1:10:34] man if it's dead bury that you love my
[1:10:35] brother man said twice dead and plucked
[1:10:37] up a man twice man I always wonder what
[1:10:40] brother man meant by twice then I'll
[1:10:42] tell you what it is hey man it was
[1:10:43] already dead and then some preacher come
[1:10:45] along he killed it hey man I'll tell you
[1:10:49] what it it's enough degeneration but you
[1:10:52] know amen I don't believe that the
[1:10:54] ministry are to be appreciate against
[1:10:56] worship I don't think the ministry ought
[1:10:58] to be preaching against the Holy Ghost
[1:10:59] move of the church I think if they're if
[1:11:02] there's any church sin order or to have
[1:11:04] some power in it I believe it's the
[1:11:06] bride of Jesus Christ if there's any
[1:11:08] church they don't have some movement in
[1:11:10] it it's a church that's alive but the
[1:11:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I think
[1:11:15] there were to be some ministers of God
[1:11:16] that's got enough sand in them they
[1:11:18] meant to stand up for the power of God
[1:11:20] and the Church of the Living God that
[1:11:22] there's a manifestation in this hour I
[1:11:25] think God this morning for good pastors
[1:11:27] I thank God for brother Samuel Browning
[1:11:29] Haven a man of God a man that will stand
[1:11:32] by this anointed word in this generation
[1:11:35] and and I believe y'all to get around
[1:11:37] him and lift him up among the Church of
[1:11:39] Living God and stand with a man that
[1:11:41] will present the word and such truth in
[1:11:43] this hour they met you you know I know
[1:11:45] it seems like a strange thing but see
[1:11:47] it's a part of your vision it's a part
[1:11:49] of the vision of the church when you
[1:11:52] when you start understanding you know if
[1:11:56] you if you study the ministry but
[1:11:59] brother Branham you're going to find out
[1:12:00] brother branham's ministry was a
[1:12:02] ministry of vision do you realize that
[1:12:05] brother Branham many times when brother
[1:12:07] Branham says things
[1:12:08] brother Ram is not just telling stories
[1:12:10] but he's telling you vision
[1:12:11] you know that when he teaches that the
[1:12:14] white wigged one of Revelations wand
[1:12:16] he teaches him as the judge do you know
[1:12:18] that he actually asks theologians why
[1:12:20] Jesus had white hair in that scripture
[1:12:22] and they said it was because they his
[1:12:24] maturity brother man said something
[1:12:27] didn't ring a bell he said but now he
[1:12:30] don't tell it to later in the skin the
[1:12:32] scripture not in the church age but
[1:12:33] later he said I walked in one morning
[1:12:35] praying about it he said there he stood
[1:12:37] in a white wig he's seen the vision of
[1:12:40] Jesus wearing a white wig and come back
[1:12:43] and told us the revelation that judgment
[1:12:45] was given unto him and the wig was
[1:12:48] placed upon him and we didn't know it
[1:12:50] now until the last days that the angels
[1:12:52] were his very wig hey men they were the
[1:12:55] one that made the wig upon him and put
[1:12:57] him in judgment amen now the Bible said
[1:12:59] he come forth with his angels in
[1:13:00] judgment then so there's there's a lot
[1:13:02] of beauty here when a prophets able to
[1:13:05] see it you know I don't know but many
[1:13:06] times you think about the Garden of Eden
[1:13:08] do you know when water from the rock
[1:13:09] brother BAM tells us that he saw the
[1:13:11] Garden of Eden in vision and wanted from
[1:13:14] the rock and why he's preaching brother
[1:13:15] man there so if there's a 1955 believers
[1:13:17] while he's preaching he's coming along
[1:13:19] preaching he's talking about Calvary and
[1:13:21] he begins to talk about how that Adam
[1:13:23] and Eve left the Garden of Eden and
[1:13:25] remember he says I see him leaving the
[1:13:28] garden now I see them wrapped in goat
[1:13:30] skins and sheep skins he said and I hear
[1:13:33] it slapping their legs and see the blood
[1:13:35] draining down the leg of Adam he said
[1:13:38] Adam didn't have to leave the garden but
[1:13:40] he left the garden for Eve and I see
[1:13:43] them walking out together he's sitting
[1:13:44] out the scene has changed and I see
[1:13:46] Jesus Christ walking up the hill of
[1:13:48] Golgotha I see a bloody garment upon him
[1:13:51] he said he's wearing a white garment
[1:13:53] remember he said one spotted blood he
[1:13:55] said there's another spot another spot
[1:13:57] he said it's made agree he said I now
[1:13:59] see the blood dripping down his legs I
[1:14:01] hear the sound of the cross as it drops
[1:14:04] across the rocks thump pump pump going
[1:14:07] up the hill amen you see brother man the
[1:14:09] next service brother Ram comes along and
[1:14:12] he says remember last night when the
[1:14:14] inspiration come he said I was in the
[1:14:16] envisions
[1:14:17] amen he was actually see
[1:14:19] the vision while he was preaching to the
[1:14:22] people of what was going on in the
[1:14:24] Garden of Eden and at Calvary he meant
[1:14:27] to recognize he meant that what we have
[1:14:30] experienced in the age that we're living
[1:14:32] in is were not here this morning by a
[1:14:35] chance so we're not here just guessing
[1:14:38] or but trying to figure out but there's
[1:14:40] a vision concerning the Church of the
[1:14:43] Living God in this age and William
[1:14:45] Brennan saw that vision and took it to
[1:14:48] the Bible and showed you all over the
[1:14:50] scripture that this vision was seen by
[1:14:52] Moses it was seen by Elijah it was seen
[1:14:55] by malachite was seen by Ezekiel
[1:14:57] amen every prophet in the Bible saw the
[1:15:00] vision of our generation and wrote of it
[1:15:03] in the Bible and here we are this
[1:15:05] morning wondering how are we going to do
[1:15:08] this brother how are we gonna live it
[1:15:09] Samuel how are we gonna overcome this
[1:15:12] are you kidding me you're gonna overcome
[1:15:14] this because it's a vision of the old
[1:15:17] magic pod has come this morning to
[1:15:20] anoint you and place you in the age that
[1:15:23] you're living here somebody's gonna
[1:15:26] recognize that's me daddy that's that's
[1:15:29] me mama I'm in the vision when I think
[1:15:32] about it today I think about the visions
[1:15:34] of God that's been placed upon our lives
[1:15:37] and and what's being fulfilled you know
[1:15:39] it's one thing for one person to have a
[1:15:41] vision about you but when all the
[1:15:43] prophets had visions about you hold on
[1:15:47] when all of the prophets had visions
[1:15:50] about you know I don't have time I guess
[1:15:51] I can go through this Bible and show you
[1:15:53] every vision ever that every prophet did
[1:15:55] have a vision about you but if you go
[1:15:57] back in the scriptures and you start
[1:15:59] noticing that it's in proverbs 29 and 18
[1:16:02] with a Bible well the greatest and
[1:16:04] wisest men in the Bible he says where
[1:16:07] there is no vision the people perish
[1:16:10] where there is no vision the people
[1:16:12] perish now if you feel like you're
[1:16:14] perishing this morning is because you've
[1:16:16] not recognizing the vision you're not
[1:16:19] realizing that there's a vision for your
[1:16:21] life amen but but but see real power the
[1:16:25] source of real power
[1:16:27] comes from vision that's that's the
[1:16:29] source of your power that's the that's
[1:16:31] the source of the faith that you have
[1:16:33] that's where perfect faith comes from
[1:16:35] but man said if I can see the vision he
[1:16:38] said there's nothing can keep me from
[1:16:40] that remember when he goes out there and
[1:16:42] and there's there's a boy in Finland you
[1:16:44] remember he tells it years before it
[1:16:46] happens and when he goes to Finland and
[1:16:48] there's a dead boy laying in front of
[1:16:50] him now you don't get a greater
[1:16:52] challenge than that as a preacher Amen
[1:16:54] the blood of life is gone from the child
[1:16:56] it it's it's it's past hope it's it's in
[1:17:00] the realm of impossibility amen brother
[1:17:02] man said I walked away from it that's
[1:17:04] how bad it was he walked away from it as
[1:17:06] a man as a preacher he walked away from
[1:17:09] it but there was something draw his
[1:17:11] attention back to the scene amen and
[1:17:14] when he draw back to the scene he didn't
[1:17:16] see the negative anymore he looked at
[1:17:18] the rocks he looked at the trees he
[1:17:20] looked at the car and the negative turn
[1:17:23] to a positive because he knew the end of
[1:17:25] the story by vision I tell you if all
[1:17:28] you can see is the problems of this age
[1:17:30] and the troubles of this age you are a
[1:17:32] most miserable person but if you can
[1:17:35] ever see it's a part of the vision it's
[1:17:37] Society of the rapture but in the middle
[1:17:40] of all of this there's going to be a
[1:17:42] resurrection of the voice of a prophet
[1:17:45] of God and look and see brother man said
[1:17:48] when I saw where I was standing the rest
[1:17:50] of it was drama I'll tell you I could
[1:17:52] never get I could never get tired of
[1:17:54] telling that the rest was drama y'all
[1:17:56] know what drama is it's when there's a
[1:17:58] part to be played it's already written
[1:18:00] and it's how it's gonna happen and
[1:18:02] brother man said he already seen himself
[1:18:04] kneeling brother man that hurt the words
[1:18:07] he would say before he ever said him he
[1:18:09] saw the child raised up before he ever
[1:18:11] raised all he had to do was just step
[1:18:14] into that vision and fulfill what he had
[1:18:17] already saw and
[1:18:19] the powers they're not brother branham's
[1:18:21] power but the power of God was there to
[1:18:25] fulfill the vision that was written and
[1:18:27] sing before he ever come to it
[1:18:29] I'll tell him said when I said thus
[1:18:31] saith the Lord rise up child
[1:18:33] he said they nothing could stop it then
[1:18:35] I read there ain't nothing can stop it
[1:18:39] then they met and when you when you
[1:18:41] recognized he meant that unstoppable
[1:18:44] resurrection power of Almighty God may
[1:18:46] I'll just tell it to you like this they
[1:18:49] tried to stop us amen everything has
[1:18:52] tried to stop us denominations to
[1:18:54] realism forces and fights and Church
[1:18:57] arguments everything is trying but it
[1:18:59] ain't work mainly they stopped you
[1:19:02] amen because there is in the nineteenth
[1:19:05] upon our lives
[1:19:06] that's an unstoppable anointing and
[1:19:09] brother man said you can stop the Sun
[1:19:11] before you can stop this ride you cannot
[1:19:14] stop this ride well I'll tell you what
[1:19:16] there's a vision of it it's she's
[1:19:18] unstoppable but mem said she ain't gonna
[1:19:20] be stopped
[1:19:21] I'll tell you what Amon I can I just
[1:19:24] preach to you minute hey man she's an
[1:19:26] unstoppable force I'll tell you what's
[1:19:29] wrong sometimes brother we give him the
[1:19:31] devil a piggyback ride
[1:19:33] that's right we give him the devil a
[1:19:34] piggyback ride if you never tried to
[1:19:36] ride somebody's back that wouldn't bend
[1:19:38] over they meant you you you you know
[1:19:40] when you was a little kid and you had
[1:19:42] buddies and you're gonna fight you know
[1:19:43] you jump on one back and guy jumps on
[1:19:45] the other than you ride away
[1:19:46] well your buddies always bend over and
[1:19:48] give you a nice hey then you jump on
[1:19:50] there and they walk around kinda but as
[1:19:52] you ever try to get on somebody's back
[1:19:54] they don't want you on their back
[1:19:55] Amen you know what he meant let me say
[1:19:59] to you like this it's hard to ride the
[1:20:01] back of a man that won't bend over and I
[1:20:03] think it's time that the Bride of Christ
[1:20:05] quit bending over amen but it's time to
[1:20:09] pull your shoulders back and tell the
[1:20:12] devil you ain't riding me
[1:20:14] you're not riding me even I believe this
[1:20:18] morning but there's a bride here that in
[1:20:21] the vision he didn't see the devil on
[1:20:23] your back but in the vision he saw the
[1:20:26] devil under your feet
[1:20:27] that's an overcoming power this morning
[1:20:30] in the vision of God Satan and son to
[1:20:33] the feet of the pride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:35] there's an anointing you say brother you
[1:20:37] act like the devil ain't nothing let me
[1:20:39] tell you if you can see the devil out of
[1:20:40] the eyes of God he is an adversary but
[1:20:43] he said defeated adversary you see you
[1:20:47] recognize that that that's where the
[1:20:50] power comes from it's the power of the
[1:20:52] vision what's brother man when he spoke
[1:20:54] that that little boy that boy raised up
[1:20:56] from the dead because the vision said he
[1:20:57] would amen and nothing's gonna stop that
[1:21:00] I'll tell you what they ain't nothin
[1:21:02] gonna stop you either and in the vision
[1:21:05] the devil ain't riding on your back he's
[1:21:06] under your feet so you tell the devil to
[1:21:08] get his own ride home this morning we
[1:21:11] might have wrote you the church but he
[1:21:13] don't have to ride you home he mighta
[1:21:15] roads you to the service but I tell you
[1:21:17] right now you ought to tell the devil
[1:21:18] get off devil you ain't did not beat God
[1:21:25] didn't like me to give the devil a ride
[1:21:28] y'all didn't give me this ministry that
[1:21:30] I carry a spirit with me and put the
[1:21:32] people under bondage and under legalism
[1:21:35] but but he gave us some ministry that we
[1:21:37] would be able to lift the children of
[1:21:39] God into the position of where God
[1:21:42] anointed them to be I'll tell you what
[1:21:44] he made you to be made you to be sons
[1:21:45] and daughters of God he never put you in
[1:21:47] a position to put one another down he
[1:21:50] never put you in the position to they
[1:21:51] tried to deflate one another he puts you
[1:21:53] in a position to lift your brothers to
[1:21:55] lift your sisters until the devil don't
[1:21:58] have no place to get in
[1:21:59] [Applause]
[1:22:02] no reason Todd I say get out of the way
[1:22:05] devil we're gonna have church this
[1:22:07] morning and many don't make no
[1:22:09] difference
[1:22:09] amen I don't know about you but I come
[1:22:12] to the house of God to enjoy the Word of
[1:22:14] God to worship I think people give the
[1:22:19] devil too much credit
[1:22:21] I think people give the devil too much
[1:22:25] credit I think I think you give him too
[1:22:27] much credit I think it's time to the
[1:22:28] right of crisis go ahead and pull your
[1:22:29] shoulders back say no more that's it
[1:22:33] who says it's that easy it's that easy
[1:22:35] it's that easy cuz you're the boss come
[1:22:40] on I know I said it hillbilly style but
[1:22:42] brother brems said you're the master of
[1:22:43] every circumstance you're the boss
[1:22:47] it's your origin to master the
[1:22:49] circumstance your own impotent with God
[1:22:51] but man said the doctors are limited man
[1:22:54] is limited but God is unlimited and when
[1:22:56] a man finds out who he is in God then
[1:22:58] that man is unlimited
[1:23:00] that's an omnipotent power resting in
[1:23:03] the church right now right now right now
[1:23:05] we are the sons of God we're not gonna
[1:23:08] pay we are right now and that's an
[1:23:11] anointing on your life to smash the
[1:23:13] enemy do you know that the very
[1:23:15] anointing on you is to smash the enemy
[1:23:17] it's written of you in Genesis the third
[1:23:19] chapter he said the woman seed shall
[1:23:21] bruise the head of the serpent that's
[1:23:23] right in the surface bruise the
[1:23:24] heel of the woman's seed that's that's
[1:23:26] you got to recognize that the only thing
[1:23:29] that devil conduce bruise your heel then
[1:23:31] he's limited in what he can do to you
[1:23:34] God has already put limits you can only
[1:23:37] what what would he'll when he attack job
[1:23:39] the greatest attacked in the Bible but
[1:23:41] God put a limit on him you can't never
[1:23:43] forget the devil is a limited enemy he
[1:23:45] can only do what God lets him do and
[1:23:48] whatever God lets him do you already
[1:23:50] been equipped to overcome whatever he is
[1:23:52] you don't know you can but I'm telling
[1:23:55] you this sport and God knows more about
[1:23:56] you and you know about yourself
[1:23:59] you think you're about to fall apart
[1:24:01] you're about to fall under the law but I
[1:24:03] say you're just getting ready to be a
[1:24:05] ripping even but get ready to really
[1:24:07] overcome my Moses didn't know what he
[1:24:13] had in him till God took the spirit off
[1:24:15] of him and put it on 70 men and he still
[1:24:17] had the power gone gods put enough in
[1:24:20] you to take what's on you and put it on
[1:24:22] 70 other women and you still overcome oh
[1:24:26] yes sir you're more than enough see you
[1:24:31] got to recognize that this comes from
[1:24:33] God this is not what we're doing if
[1:24:35] you're doing it yourself then you're in
[1:24:37] trouble
[1:24:38] but if this is a vision the devil's in
[1:24:41] trouble is that right that's why brother
[1:24:46] man said watch out devil watch out devil
[1:24:50] cuz this one this was a word pride this
[1:24:53] is not just another denomination not
[1:24:55] just another church this is a word pride
[1:24:57] but men said see she won't fail like
[1:24:59] that first he did I always didn't
[1:25:02] understand that I didn't get the secret
[1:25:04] of it brother man said later he said the
[1:25:06] secret of it is that the word is in the
[1:25:07] bride he said that first Eve could fall
[1:25:10] from the word but the second Eve can't
[1:25:13] because she is the world
[1:25:17] she came close she is the word they
[1:25:20] meant were not riding the Bible we're
[1:25:22] not riding books but the books have
[1:25:25] wrote about you it's a fulfillment of
[1:25:29] the manifestation of what the Bible is
[1:25:31] spoken about in that age hey man people
[1:25:33] think I'm odd they may think I'm
[1:25:35] different but let me tell you there's a
[1:25:36] vision about this age and that's the
[1:25:38] answer to our prince it's a vision and
[1:25:41] when you when you look at this and first
[1:25:42] Kings you'll find the story is written
[1:25:44] of Elisha who exhibited great power over
[1:25:46] 400 prophets of Balaam one of the
[1:25:49] greatest showdowns in the Bible was when
[1:25:51] Elijah faced off 450 prophets of Bale
[1:25:53] and he done it according to the Bible by
[1:25:56] a vision Elijah would have never
[1:25:59] challenged the devil on his own merits
[1:26:02] Elijah would have never challenged 450
[1:26:05] prophets on his own merits he meant but
[1:26:08] he knew where he was standing with God
[1:26:10] by a vision because in the 36 vs. 18
[1:26:13] chapter the Bible says I have done these
[1:26:16] things at thy word they meant what what
[1:26:20] kind of what kind of what kind of
[1:26:22] tenacity what kind of strength what kind
[1:26:24] of of resolve has a man got with a
[1:26:27] vision I'll tell you the county has he
[1:26:29] has the kind to walk right up in the
[1:26:30] face of a king have you ever thought
[1:26:35] about how did Elisha get in to talk to a
[1:26:37] king you just decide you're gonna go
[1:26:39] talk to President Trump
[1:26:41] tell me how that goes for you you can
[1:26:46] think anything you want you go down and
[1:26:47] try to talk to him you're gonna find out
[1:26:48] there's a lot of channels you got to go
[1:26:50] through and then you still might not
[1:26:51] talk to him he meant but when God told
[1:26:54] Elijah to go talk to AB he just walked
[1:26:57] up and talked to him don't think that
[1:27:00] that's mate don't think it was any
[1:27:01] different than it is now that King was
[1:27:04] protected a protection protection
[1:27:06] protection attention but listen my God
[1:27:07] can open doors
[1:27:09] my god can open door say man he meant
[1:27:12] you you see when I lied you got ready to
[1:27:15] go talk to AB he had the word of the
[1:27:16] Lord you just went told him I'm shutting
[1:27:17] up the heavens now three and a half
[1:27:19] years is gonna be I mean rain come until
[1:27:21] I call for it any of us would have
[1:27:24] called that arrogance but it wasn't
[1:27:27] arrogance he knew who he was he knew
[1:27:29] what he was doing there and he noticed
[1:27:31] what my idea of this comes from God so
[1:27:34] he was not there in arrogance he was
[1:27:37] there in assurance of who he was and
[1:27:39] what his job was with God you see what
[1:27:42] he done he he actually did that the
[1:27:43] Bible said that he lived in the time and
[1:27:45] that the god of bail was worshipped more
[1:27:47] than the god of Jehovah they had put
[1:27:50] high places ever high place had a temple
[1:27:52] you you see in the scripture said even
[1:27:54] a.m. the Bible talks about was the worst
[1:27:56] King because he even rebuilt though that
[1:27:58] gates to Jericho whom Joshua Kersey it
[1:28:01] was a horrible time it was a horrible
[1:28:02] situation but God called Elijah to show
[1:28:06] them that God still has power he come to
[1:28:08] humble them God has power over the
[1:28:10] heavens and over the earth you may think
[1:28:12] you're in power but you're not in power
[1:28:13] listen friends I don't care what any man
[1:28:16] thinks or says God always had power
[1:28:20] there's nothing out of control
[1:28:23] that's nothing out of order that's more
[1:28:25] than you you may think everything is
[1:28:27] just maybe you're just barely getting
[1:28:29] there and maybe think listen God had
[1:28:31] Daniel stand and tell it King
[1:28:33] Amen before it ever happened how his
[1:28:35] kingdom came how he was gonna lose his
[1:28:37] kingdom he told him the ruling kingdoms
[1:28:40] for the next for the next millennia of
[1:28:42] how that the world would be possessed in
[1:28:44] the battles of those possessions he told
[1:28:46] us who would rule and what time they
[1:28:48] would rule can you think that God is not
[1:28:50] lost control he knew exactly who would
[1:28:53] be ruling he knew exactly how things are
[1:28:56] going to be Amen so God already knows
[1:28:58] now watch when God actually calls Elijah
[1:29:00] to tell them he's he invites him up to a
[1:29:02] to a mountain to heaven to have a
[1:29:04] showdown and Elijah is a gentleman he
[1:29:07] tells him look I'll tell you what you do
[1:29:09] you take your 450 prophets and y'all
[1:29:11] build an altar and put a Bullock on it
[1:29:13] and don't put any fire under it and he
[1:29:15] said I'll do the same and he said
[1:29:17] whoever's God answers my fire will serve
[1:29:19] that God
[1:29:21] now the reason he chose to answer my
[1:29:24] fire cause Paul tells us the secret he
[1:29:25] says our God is a consuming fire so
[1:29:29] Elijah knew they didn't have the power
[1:29:31] to bring down that fire that that power
[1:29:33] come from God so he actually he was a
[1:29:37] real gentleman because you know what it
[1:29:38] lied you actually let him go first
[1:29:41] you read the scripture and find out
[1:29:44] Elijah to let him go first and Elijah
[1:29:46] give them all day long
[1:29:48] Elijah said y'all go ahead and take the
[1:29:50] whole church ages I'll just take right
[1:29:52] here at the back hand back no go ahead
[1:29:55] and take the whole day long
[1:29:57] amen and y'all do what you want now but
[1:29:59] as the as the evening Sun begin to show
[1:30:02] up and the daylight begin to disappear
[1:30:05] and Elijah got bolder and bolder he got
[1:30:08] more bold and more blown as the day went
[1:30:10] on because he began to say to him what's
[1:30:12] the matter with you God as he is he
[1:30:14] cannot hear maybe you shouldn't yell
[1:30:17] louder he's on vacation or something
[1:30:19] something's happening your God's not
[1:30:20] answering here you're doing the talking
[1:30:23] but there's no answer coming back and
[1:30:25] and Elijah begin to make fun it wasn't
[1:30:27] arrogance it was he knew who he was he
[1:30:29] was not making fun of God he was making
[1:30:32] fun of their ridiculous ideas of God and
[1:30:35] any begin to grow stronger and stronger
[1:30:37] and watch what he done he began to say
[1:30:38] to them well you know good they maybe
[1:30:40] you should they cut themselves and they
[1:30:42] danced and they've done everything they
[1:30:44] could do but there was no fire there was
[1:30:46] no fire come and being the gentleman
[1:30:48] that he was he give him all day long and
[1:30:50] he said when it when the evening time
[1:30:52] come he said now this is my time because
[1:30:57] what Elijah knew that they didn't know
[1:30:59] is Elijah could have built that altar at
[1:31:01] noon and wouldn't be no fire he meant
[1:31:03] but Elijah knew that the the fire would
[1:31:06] come in the evening
[1:31:09] knew the fire was coming in the evening
[1:31:11] listen listen friends the Bible said
[1:31:14] that in the evening time there shall be
[1:31:17] alive what light is that that's the same
[1:31:20] light that led the children of Israel
[1:31:22] that's the same lie statement that
[1:31:24] appeared over the river with John in
[1:31:26] Jesus that's the same light that returns
[1:31:28] from the end time that brings the Church
[1:31:31] of the Living God in the faithful Chevy
[1:31:33] lights in the evening times you see when
[1:31:36] Elijah built his older look what he done
[1:31:38] he built it in the correct timing with
[1:31:40] God
[1:31:40] I'll tell your friends if you ever see
[1:31:42] God's timing amen the devil that devil
[1:31:44] don't have no chance because you see
[1:31:45] this is your time to move he meant you
[1:31:49] see that was time sense maybe it wasn't
[1:31:51] the right time but when it becomes time
[1:31:53] that's when you defeat every enemy you
[1:31:56] look at what happens when when Elijah
[1:31:58] begins to build that altar he builds the
[1:32:00] altar and he builds it out of the Bible
[1:32:02] said he took stones one for all the
[1:32:04] tribes he took wood and then he took
[1:32:06] flesh has any of you ever tried to burn
[1:32:08] a no mule or cows just burn it on the
[1:32:11] fire he don't burn very good you know
[1:32:13] way down south we have a we have a funny
[1:32:15] saying saying he could burn a wet mule
[1:32:17] with hundred-dollar bills now you know a
[1:32:18] man's rich if he can do that because it
[1:32:22] takes a lot of it takes a lot of fire to
[1:32:24] burn out to burn an offering but you but
[1:32:26] you watch what happens is is Elijah
[1:32:29] seemingly has built an offering that
[1:32:31] would not burn according to the mind of
[1:32:35] man Elijah's offering will not burn
[1:32:39] stone don't burn flesh don't burn the
[1:32:43] only combustible part of his anointing
[1:32:45] or his system was the wood that he
[1:32:47] placed there when he placed the wood
[1:32:49] upon the altar look what he does he goes
[1:32:51] and gets water and he don't just poured
[1:32:54] on the offering but he goes and digs a
[1:32:57] trench around his offering and and he
[1:33:00] says bring me four barrels of water and
[1:33:02] pour it on this offering now now now
[1:33:05] you're gonna get in just one idea weight
[1:33:07] loss and I'm not preaching this for
[1:33:08] doctrine then I'm putting this out in
[1:33:10] front that's just my opinion he meant
[1:33:12] but I always wondered why in the world
[1:33:14] would brother Branham why would Elijah
[1:33:16] pour so much water on that altar I
[1:33:18] always wondered why
[1:33:19] and I just studied maybe maybe it's
[1:33:21] right maybe it's wrong but it's just
[1:33:22] good for thought they met but you see
[1:33:25] what would happen if a fire came and
[1:33:27] then that evening one of them bail
[1:33:29] profits come up there and said well
[1:33:30] whatever happened was our God started
[1:33:33] that fire
[1:33:33] and now Elijah is just getting off of
[1:33:35] the reputation that he's acting like
[1:33:37] he's won it done kind of like our
[1:33:38] presidents you know he meant but you
[1:33:41] know they always blame it or accept it
[1:33:43] from the other president and you see but
[1:33:45] what's what Elijah does under the wisdom
[1:33:48] of God he pours water on everything he
[1:33:50] puts so much water on it there's got one
[1:33:53] strange fire on the altar that he
[1:33:56] spilled there there's no strange fire
[1:33:58] there at all Haman it's no fire from any
[1:34:01] of their ages maybe I said to you like
[1:34:03] this he put out all the fires he meant
[1:34:05] just in case see there's no Baptist
[1:34:08] anointing on that altar there there's no
[1:34:10] Pentecostal anointing on that altar
[1:34:12] there's no denominational he put out
[1:34:15] everything maybe he was sure you know
[1:34:18] it's dad it's dad this is a dead altar
[1:34:22] there's nothing here at all amen and
[1:34:24] there won't be till I call for it Oh
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:28] sometimes we wonder why God put all the
[1:34:31] lights out why why did the Baptists
[1:34:33] lights go out why did the Pentecostal
[1:34:35] lights go out why did all the lights go
[1:34:37] out he wanted you to know what it was to
[1:34:39] not have a light hey you see hey man
[1:34:42] what's that in that cave when the little
[1:34:44] boy standing there with his sister and
[1:34:46] the man says they meant without lied in
[1:34:48] this cave it's the darkest place you can
[1:34:50] live and the man turns the lights off of
[1:34:53] the little girl screams what she gets a
[1:34:55] stark reality of how dark things really
[1:34:58] are but her brother says to her don't
[1:35:02] worry little sister there is a man here
[1:35:05] that can turn on the lights you see why
[1:35:09] brother man must show the darkness of
[1:35:11] the age he wasn't showing that darkness
[1:35:13] to to bring us into a negative he was
[1:35:15] showing us the darkness to let us know
[1:35:17] what it would be without this messy
[1:35:20] where would she be this morning without
[1:35:23] a license ministry we would be in the
[1:35:26] darkness of Laodicea
[1:35:27] but that angel draw a little light in
[1:35:30] the pattern he meant remember now he
[1:35:32] stood back from the altar and said
[1:35:34] according to that word according to that
[1:35:37] word Lord he said let the fire fall on
[1:35:40] this and the Bible said the fire came
[1:35:42] down on that altar and it consumed the
[1:35:44] wood and it consumed the stone and it
[1:35:47] consumed the water and it consumed the
[1:35:49] flesh amen it consumed everything
[1:35:52] brother Kevin it assumed everything you
[1:35:56] see on Elijah's altar there is a fire
[1:35:59] that is an all-consuming fire amen but
[1:36:02] that's where Zachary in the book of in
[1:36:04] the book of Samuel there were judges
[1:36:06] that when Gideon is talking to the angel
[1:36:08] remember he's talking to an angel and he
[1:36:10] don't know if that angels just an old
[1:36:12] man with a stick or not so he says if
[1:36:14] God be with us were some miracles and he
[1:36:16] goes and builds a fire or it goes him
[1:36:19] puts an altar and he put some meat on
[1:36:21] the altar and the man that was there had
[1:36:23] a stick and just touched it and fire
[1:36:26] consumed the altar if you're at an altar
[1:36:29] of God there is a fire hold the altars
[1:36:32] of God there's a fire on the altars of
[1:36:35] God listen for him this morning we have
[1:36:37] an altar the world don't know about

[1:36:54] chew this gum and this and that listen I
[1:36:56] serve a God and if you can come to his
[1:36:59] altar and you can sacrifice your life
[1:37:01] there's a fire that will come out of
[1:37:03] heaven

[1:37:34] that's the coming clean are you not

[1:37:39] this much idea of legalism ain't done
[1:37:42] nothing but make a bunch of hypocrites

[1:37:45] desire in your heart
[1:37:46] amen be open with that desire and cut

[1:38:11] this altar a man used to Mullane how do
[1:38:14] you know I've been to the altar a man it
[1:38:16] wasn't in this church but that's Paul
[1:38:18] said we have an altar that they don't
[1:38:20] know about
[1:38:21] amen we have an altar that they don't
[1:38:23] know about
[1:38:24] it's an altar of God where the fire
[1:38:26] comes down when that fire comes think of
[1:38:29] this now because immediately he meant
[1:38:32] immediately when this fire comes it's
[1:38:34] there were Elijah Amen rise us up and
[1:38:38] tell say HAP you go get something to eat
[1:38:39] and drink because I hear the sound of
[1:38:42] the abundance of rain I tell you what a
[1:38:45] powerful thing when a prophet announces
[1:38:47] rain they meant in animation at the same
[1:38:51] time the fire came it's the same time
[1:38:53] that the denomination of prophets were
[1:38:55] proved wrong it's the same time that a
[1:38:57] rain in abundance was coming on the
[1:38:59] earth he meant you don't think this
[1:39:01] vision wasn't speaking of another
[1:39:02] generation another time Amen when they
[1:39:05] evening sacrifice under Elijah's
[1:39:07] ministry disproving denominational ideas
[1:39:09] at the same time he announced
[1:39:11] rain is coming upon the earth you go eat
[1:39:13] and drink a member but rain is coming
[1:39:16] and they go up on the mountain and the
[1:39:18] old prophet is tired and weary and he
[1:39:20] puts his head between his legs and tells
[1:39:22] his servant go look seven times remember
[1:39:25] go look seven times because he went look
[1:39:26] the first time and he went looked he
[1:39:28] said do you see any rain he said I don't
[1:39:30] see nothing at all and he come back to
[1:39:32] the Prophet and tried to tell him I
[1:39:33] don't see that and he said you ain't
[1:39:34] looking right go look again
[1:39:36] you go look seven times to your vision
[1:39:39] lines up with God's wish amen
[1:39:42] you see things can be happening that you
[1:39:44] don't see things can be taking place
[1:39:46] that you don't eat in here as he said
[1:39:48] you just keep looking Haman don't you
[1:39:50] look at this message one time and say
[1:39:52] I've learned it all but you keep looking
[1:39:55] till you see the revival that God is
[1:39:57] sent upon the earth you keep looking
[1:39:59] till at the grace of God comes in your
[1:40:02] life you see what he said he said you go
[1:40:04] look seven times nother what you keep
[1:40:05] looking till you see something and
[1:40:07] finally the man come back and said
[1:40:09] Elisha hacia a cloud I see it coming up
[1:40:12] out of the sea it's about the size of a
[1:40:14] man's hand what much to go home it
[1:40:17] wasn't much of a point to make but when
[1:40:19] Elijah heard that amen the prophet of
[1:40:22] God said the old prophet become
[1:40:23] refreshed because he's seeing the moving
[1:40:26] of the supernatural see he knew man
[1:40:29] didn't put that cloud apparent he knew
[1:40:31] his word put that cloud apparent and the
[1:40:35] first move the first move of the
[1:40:38] supernatural set human action no adult
[1:40:41] prophet I tell y'all think we're a
[1:40:42] little bit you think we're a little bit
[1:40:44] wiring crazy the preachers all jumping
[1:40:46] around you already been up there that
[1:40:47] more of that prophet that old man he
[1:40:50] been sitting there his bald head and his
[1:40:51] mantle around him Bible said he was
[1:40:53] Haman and sitting there was man around
[1:40:55] him and when he be when he heard the
[1:40:57] noise of that cloud out there from his
[1:40:59] service you know what the Bible says he
[1:41:01] says he stood up refreshed but men said
[1:41:04] we movie must have been refreshed
[1:41:06] because he was an old man and he outrun
[1:41:09] the chariots of Ahab down to the city of
[1:41:12] hey you see what he does he got so full
[1:41:15] of the stimulating power of the Holy
[1:41:18] Ghost that he's an old man standing up
[1:41:21] and he takes off running down the
[1:41:23] hillside with everybody watching him ray
[1:41:29] p'mote Church I'm telling you right can
[1:41:35] you imagine what it was like that
[1:41:36] morning ray sister when it starts
[1:41:40] raining God sends rain it's not just a
[1:41:43] little drip drop God sends abundant rain
[1:41:45] God sends abundant rain to our lives
[1:41:48] that wasn't even anything there there
[1:41:50] was nothing there was no rain in the sky
[1:41:51] the only sign of rain was a little cloud
[1:41:54] but when that prophet of God become
[1:41:56] under a refreshing come on it's written
[1:41:58] in the Bible that we refreshing in the
[1:42:00] last stage and it comes from the
[1:42:02] presence of God and it odd that that
[1:42:04] word presence means face and there's
[1:42:06] actually been a cloud appeared in this
[1:42:08] age in the face of Jesus Christ and when
[1:42:11] a prophet of God saw it he become
[1:42:13] refreshed and told you all it's the
[1:42:15] coming of the Lord
[1:42:18] hello friends back cloud was not a
[1:42:21] corporal coming but it was the sign of
[1:42:24] the coming of the day we're going to see
[1:42:26] that clapping by that cloud the first
[1:42:30] move of seven seals right in the wire to
[1:42:34] the church what was it it was the
[1:42:36] prophecy of Joel chapter 2 I will pour
[1:42:39] out my spirit saith the Lord and it will
[1:42:41] be both the former and the latter rain
[1:42:44] in the last days saith the Lord
[1:42:46] you see what that former rain was a
[1:42:48] teaching rain the latter rain is a is a
[1:42:50] rapturing faith that comes from that
[1:42:53] plane and you know fall in the same
[1:42:55] season
[1:42:58] oh don't you tell me we need a return
[1:43:00] ministry we need somebody to believe
[1:43:02] this we need somebody to believe this
[1:43:05] message we need to believe what God has
[1:43:07] sent to us to that mother I tell you
[1:43:11] what I think it's amazing they went from
[1:43:13] nothing to abundance they didn't have
[1:43:17] nothing and then they had everything
[1:43:18] they had no rain they had abundant get
[1:43:21] the barrels out he said get the barrels
[1:43:24] out Haman he meant before I spoke there
[1:43:26] was nothing now there's everything you
[1:43:28] see what Elijah's ministry does it takes
[1:43:31] you for nothing and brings you into
[1:43:33] abundant revelation into abundant grace
[1:43:37] [Applause]
[1:43:40] what the bible does teach us amen the
[1:43:43] Bible teaches us great things it teaches
[1:43:46] us that under the ministry lots of
[1:43:47] things change quick to me and sitting in
[1:43:49] a gate there lepers is that right
[1:43:52] thanks things are bad in the city God
[1:43:54] lets you know how bad it was that one
[1:43:56] woman build another one's baby and they
[1:43:58] ate it and the next day they were
[1:44:00] supposed to build the other woman's baby
[1:44:02] and eat it that's how bad it was in the
[1:44:04] city now you can spend all day focusing
[1:44:07] on the bat if you want to amen but let's
[1:44:09] move another chapter let's move another
[1:44:11] verse and let's read the king went to
[1:44:13] Elisha and begin to telling the trouble
[1:44:16] and while he was telling the trouble he
[1:44:17] said I hear what you're saying but by
[1:44:19] this time tomorrow he meant by this time
[1:44:23] tomorrow that will be through to plenty
[1:44:25] that wouldn't be abundance among you a
[1:44:28] man who was leaning up against the door
[1:44:30] heard Elijah's prophecy of abundance and
[1:44:32] begin to laugh and Elisha said to him
[1:44:34] said you're gonna see it but you won't
[1:44:36] get to taste it is that right and the
[1:44:39] very next morning before daylight two
[1:44:41] lepers are sitting at the gate and
[1:44:43] they're sick and there's an entire army
[1:44:45] out there besieging the city and they
[1:44:47] can't go out and they can't come in and
[1:44:49] then they're at the gate and they're
[1:44:51] about to die and one looks at another
[1:44:53] and says why do we sit here till we die
[1:44:55] Amen why I let fear make us Senate the
[1:44:58] gate
[1:44:59] why let fear be between two opinions he
[1:45:02] said let's just go out and see what we
[1:45:03] find
[1:45:04] payment in the middle of the night God
[1:45:06] had caused the rustling out of the
[1:45:08] desert and those Syrians thought that
[1:45:10] there was something coming to capturing
[1:45:12] and they got up and left and the entire
[1:45:15] army left their spools and those lepers
[1:45:18] come up on the camp they went from
[1:45:20] nothing brother - to the spools of an
[1:45:23] entire army under the Ministry of Elijah
[1:45:26] [Applause]
[1:45:31] you got the Ministry of Elijah you got
[1:45:34] everything come on you you can read
[1:45:37] about a shooter Batwoman you can read
[1:45:39] about a widow a winner there you can
[1:45:41] read about how a little widow woman down
[1:45:42] there and Sarah path she was out of
[1:45:44] barrel she was out a meal in her barrel
[1:45:46] the Bible said and what did she say when
[1:45:48] Elijah asked her what are you doing what
[1:45:51] are you doing and she said I'm gonna
[1:45:52] cook a cake and me and the boy are gonna
[1:45:55] die what are they gonna do they're going
[1:45:57] to perish and unless Elijah would come
[1:46:00] the whole earth will die with a curse
[1:46:03] the whole thing will perish according to
[1:46:06] Amos II a chapter that's a famine that
[1:46:08] will strike the land not for food and
[1:46:10] wine but for the hearing of the word of
[1:46:12] God but without a vision we will all
[1:46:16] perish but the same Bible that said
[1:46:18] there was a famine coming and said I'll
[1:46:20] send them to you Elijah before the great
[1:46:23] and dreadful day of the Lord
[1:46:25] [Applause]
[1:46:27] abundance was prophesied with a curse at
[1:46:30] the same time payment as prophesied
[1:46:31] there is the prep for prophecy of
[1:46:33] abundance what'd he say - he said you go
[1:46:35] and make yourself them cakes he said but
[1:46:38] you make one for me first and then you
[1:46:40] make it for the boy and yourself she
[1:46:42] didn't have enough to make one he told
[1:46:44] her to make three but if you make one
[1:46:48] for Elijah you'll have enough for
[1:46:50] everybody else to
[1:46:52] is that right her meal was gone and the
[1:46:55] Bible said she lived off of that barrel
[1:46:57] for many days until there was no more
[1:46:59] need they met and it never went dry
[1:47:02] again I mean let me just possess and say
[1:47:04] this he met her present this and say
[1:47:06] this she did not live on meal after that
[1:47:08] day she lived on the sand for Lord I'll
[1:47:13] tell you where we're living today we're
[1:47:15] not living off of the milk barrel we're
[1:47:17] living off of the safe alone barrels
[1:47:20] were intact but thus saith the Lord put
[1:47:22] in abundance in the message of the hour
[1:47:24] you see what it done until it was thus
[1:47:27] saith the Lord it was just another
[1:47:28] message friends but when it becomes thus
[1:47:31] saith the Lord it become meal in the
[1:47:33] barrel which it's Christ is the same
[1:47:35] yesterday today and forever bro there's
[1:47:38] something that follows a message is that
[1:47:40] right amen ask that little woman that
[1:47:42] was about to sell her children into
[1:47:44] slavery because of the debt she hold is
[1:47:46] that right at the debt shield until that
[1:47:49] she went to Elijah and he said to her
[1:47:51] you got any oil in the house she said a
[1:47:53] little
[1:47:53] he said go out and borrow some vessels
[1:47:56] and not a few is that right go out and
[1:47:58] barber and then we're not involved all
[1:47:59] they could and the Bible said they
[1:48:01] filled them everyone with the all that
[1:48:03] she had she went from no money to
[1:48:06] abundance under the ministry of Elijah
[1:48:08] listen friend if you're not under a
[1:48:10] ministry of Elijah you're in famine
[1:48:12] you're in darkness would come under the
[1:48:14] ministry and there's an abundance of
[1:48:17] revelation and truth and reality and
[1:48:20] revival you see when he died he man he
[1:48:23] filled them I tell you what is a
[1:48:24] preacher I'm glad to read places like
[1:48:26] that because mother samuel is well on
[1:48:29] same list there's a time in our life
[1:48:30] where we wonder if we ask him to come
[1:48:32] with God filled them remember it's a
[1:48:35] paradox that I can preach to you to
[1:48:36] repent your sins and be baptized and
[1:48:37] gotta fill you with the Holy Ghost I
[1:48:39] can't do the feeling brother I don't
[1:48:41] have the power to do the feeling all I
[1:48:43] can do is the preaching but you've got
[1:48:45] to believe that the God that put the
[1:48:46] vision in process will feel the body hey
[1:48:49] maybe you got to start pouring and let
[1:48:50] God fill it up amen and eventually it
[1:48:53] becomes a revelation to you he can fill
[1:48:55] as many as you can get to come amen is
[1:48:58] many vessels as you can bring God can
[1:48:59] feel you gotta remember he's the God
[1:49:02] that filled the waters of the
[1:49:04] he's the one that filled the oceans with
[1:49:06] rudder he said god that can feel every
[1:49:09] heart with the Holy Ghost don't think
[1:49:12] that he's sparingly this morning can
[1:49:14] barely hear you know it's a powerful
[1:49:18] thing when you start seeing that they
[1:49:20] moved by that you see the abundance of
[1:49:22] it
[1:49:23] listen you see without the Ministry of
[1:49:26] Elijah you don't even have angel but if
[1:49:28] you come on the Ministry of Elijah look
[1:49:30] what happens
[1:49:30] there's the man named guy Heiser he's
[1:49:32] with Elijah he's in the cabin here comes
[1:49:34] the Syrian army off of the mountain the
[1:49:36] man's very nervous amen but Elisha don't
[1:49:39] get nervous
[1:49:39] hey man Elisha don't get married why
[1:49:41] don't he get nervous because he knows
[1:49:44] there is angels all about him until
[1:49:46] finally he tells the Lord he said Lord
[1:49:48] would you open this boy's eyes but he
[1:49:51] might be able to see if you don't want
[1:49:52] the Bible said when his eyes was opened
[1:49:54] then he didn't see one angel but he
[1:49:57] literally saw that the mountains were
[1:49:59] full of the chariots he went from no
[1:50:02] Angels to abundant angels he did he was
[1:50:07] he was not aware of one angel in the
[1:50:10] building but under the ministry of
[1:50:12] Elisha his eyes was open to all of them
[1:50:15] that was there
[1:50:16] oh listen this morning buh-bam said
[1:50:19] Elijah never even saw those angels and I
[1:50:23] should never even saw those angels but
[1:50:25] had knew it from the songs where it said
[1:50:28] the angel of the Lord and camp about
[1:50:30] them that fear him he said Elijah was
[1:50:33] standing on the word and knew they were
[1:50:35] there by the scriptures you might not
[1:50:39] see him this morning with your eye but
[1:50:42] the scripture says the angels of God
[1:50:45] Horan kept the Baptist
[1:50:48] well I'll tell you what if your vision
[1:50:51] was open this morning you'll see the
[1:50:52] angels of God is here the power of God
[1:50:55] is moving in this myth has a bright
[1:50:57] light flashing and moving across this
[1:50:59] building back and forth what's it doing
[1:51:01] it bringing you to the abundance of
[1:51:03] revelation that has been programmed for
[1:51:06] your age do you see a refreshing come
[1:51:08] from the presence of God and when that
[1:51:10] refreshing come that was that
[1:51:12] long-awaited revival of rain that
[1:51:14] they've been looking for you see this is
[1:51:17] what happens when God brings you into
[1:51:20] something by vision remember last night
[1:51:22] we approached Moses who was there under
[1:51:24] vision now Abraham had knew that the
[1:51:27] children of Israel was going to be
[1:51:28] delivered four hundred years went by
[1:51:30] with no movement at all but when Moses
[1:51:34] saw that light in the bush he said I am
[1:51:37] the I am let's come down out of heaven
[1:51:41] to deliver this children out of the
[1:51:44] Egyptians and put them into their land
[1:51:46] you see that was a vision laying there
[1:51:49] remember that vision become open now
[1:51:51] watch because in the ninth verse it says
[1:51:54] this the third chapter of Exodus enact
[1:51:56] verse he says therefore behold the cry
[1:51:59] of the children of Israel has come unto
[1:52:01] me and I have seen the oppression of the
[1:52:04] Egyptians and how they press them now
[1:52:07] what's this the Bible tells us that God
[1:52:09] appears to Moses comes down to him to
[1:52:11] deliver his children because the cry of
[1:52:14] the children have reached his ears now
[1:52:16] watch this what what I don't know I
[1:52:19] think different patterns maybe but
[1:52:21] whatever possessed that bunch of slaves
[1:52:23] to think that they could be delivered
[1:52:25] whatever God in their mind that they
[1:52:28] deserves freedom how in the work that
[1:52:31] was generations born that had never saw
[1:52:33] freedom amen all they had was a was a
[1:52:36] story that they could be free but they
[1:52:39] believed that story was a promise from
[1:52:41] Jehovah right now if that was him the
[1:52:44] promise of Jehovah they had a right to
[1:52:46] expect what God had promised them so all
[1:52:50] the sudden we realized that expectation
[1:52:53] is linked to promise amen if you don't
[1:52:56] have promise you don't have expectation
[1:52:59] you have promised you can expect God to
[1:53:01] do what God said he would do even if it
[1:53:04] seems impossible is that right
[1:53:07] so the Bible says that they would cry so
[1:53:09] watch now here here is people
[1:53:11] approaching God for what he prophesied
[1:53:14] what he said would be they had a right
[1:53:17] to pray that way and ask God for this to
[1:53:20] be fulfilled now we find out in the
[1:53:22] scripture that when God fulfilled this
[1:53:24] vision with Moses it happened at the
[1:53:27] same time Amen that a prophet was on the
[1:53:30] earth you watch God always fulfills his
[1:53:34] word in the time of a prophet the Bible
[1:53:37] said in Amos chapter 3 the Lord our God
[1:53:39] will do nothing until first he reveals
[1:53:41] his secrets undo his prophets so when a
[1:53:45] prophet comes on the earth you're
[1:53:47] looking at a junction of time and
[1:53:49] eternity you're looking at a vision that
[1:53:52] has just been laying there unfulfilled
[1:53:54] but when a prophet comes down to the
[1:53:57] earth at the same time Christ returns to
[1:53:59] the earth what's what happens the time
[1:54:01] mates the junction of fulfillment now
[1:54:05] what's because we see that that many
[1:54:08] people get troubled in the delay but
[1:54:10] when God gets ready to fulfill it in
[1:54:12] other words as a Christian you got to be
[1:54:13] ready to wait and you got to be ready to
[1:54:15] run you've got you've got to be ready to
[1:54:18] wait and you got be ready to move you've
[1:54:21] got to know you're waiting on God but
[1:54:22] when God moves you time to go and now
[1:54:24] some of you sisters know that you've
[1:54:26] waited on your husband and you can wait
[1:54:29] waitwait only but when he's ready to go
[1:54:31] he's ready to go so you got to learn how
[1:54:33] to wait you gotta learn how to go is
[1:54:35] that right now as a Christian people you
[1:54:37] got to learn how to wait on the Lord but
[1:54:39] when the Lord moves then it's time to
[1:54:41] move right pull the professor told us
[1:54:44] that you might wait months but when the
[1:54:46] angel troubles the water time to get in
[1:54:48] is that right amen now the reason that
[1:54:51] it is because they knew that it happened
[1:54:54] before it'll happen again they knew it
[1:54:56] wasn't whether it would happen it was a
[1:54:58] matter when it would happen so watch now
[1:55:00] we find out that the scripture is
[1:55:02] telling us that there goes ages
[1:55:04] sometimes with no open vision now we can
[1:55:08] find this in the book of Proverbs again
[1:55:09] watch now with
[1:55:10] no vision the people perish let's get
[1:55:13] her get her context here we're no vision
[1:55:15] people perish now watch because in 1st
[1:55:17] Samuel 3 the Bible tells us that there
[1:55:19] was a time of the child Samuel
[1:55:21] ministered unto the Lord before Eli and
[1:55:23] the Bible said the word of the Lord was
[1:55:25] precious in those days where there was
[1:55:27] no open vision now watch that can be a
[1:55:30] vision but it not be an open vision in
[1:55:33] other words you don't have the say if
[1:55:35] the lower brother man said a vision is a
[1:55:37] direct word from God a vision is a
[1:55:40] direct word from God a vision I'm
[1:55:43] quoting him a direct vision of God's a
[1:55:45] direct word of the Lord
[1:55:47] now watch because you can actually be
[1:55:50] reading a vision and it not be open to
[1:55:53] you the Bible itself is a book of
[1:55:57] visions watching Isaiah 29 watch how the
[1:56:01] Bible handles this when it says and the
[1:56:03] vision of all has become unto you as the
[1:56:06] words of a book that is sealed which men
[1:56:09] delivered to one that has learned saying
[1:56:11] read this I pray thee and he said I
[1:56:13] cannot before it's sealed so here what
[1:56:17] we have in the Bible is we have a book
[1:56:20] that has had visions of every prophet
[1:56:23] has had visions of this generation but
[1:56:27] though that this book has been delivered
[1:56:29] in the hands of many they have not yet
[1:56:31] seen the vision clearly of what was to
[1:56:33] happen in the end see they had the book
[1:56:36] but the book was sealed so so we find
[1:56:39] out then every story in the Bible has a
[1:56:43] vision for this generation maybe maybe
[1:56:46] I'll say it to you like this
[1:56:47] all of them foreshadowed something that
[1:56:50] would become clear in the last days we
[1:56:53] find out that when this clarity comes it
[1:56:56] is at the same time as a prophet in
[1:56:59] other words the vision will become open
[1:57:00] or resealable at that time when you read
[1:57:03] the Book of Ezekiel now I know your
[1:57:05] Bible studies and you go home and read
[1:57:06] it if you hadn't read it currently but
[1:57:08] in the Book of Ezekiel he was a prophet
[1:57:10] called the son of man the word of the
[1:57:12] Lord came unto him and God told him that
[1:57:15] he dwelled in amongst the people that
[1:57:16] couldn't see he died
[1:57:19] howdy ears couldn't hear called him
[1:57:20] rebellious house and one day he told his
[1:57:22] Hickory said I want you to prepare all
[1:57:24] your stuff and I want you to carry it
[1:57:25] out of your house I want you to knock a
[1:57:27] hole in the wall and I want you to carry
[1:57:29] your stuff out of your house carry
[1:57:30] through that wall and I want you to do
[1:57:32] it where the people see you I want you
[1:57:34] to do it in the evening time when they
[1:57:35] see you do it
[1:57:36] and while they're seeing you do it and
[1:57:37] once you put a veil on your face to let
[1:57:39] them know you've got eyes but you can't
[1:57:40] see you're gonna become a sign the Bible
[1:57:45] said he's going to become a sign under
[1:57:47] the people what was was that a car it
[1:57:49] was prophesied they would be carried out
[1:57:51] of Babylon but they are carried out of
[1:57:53] Israel Jerusalem and to be carried out
[1:57:55] through that wall with their stuff and
[1:57:57] so God was showing them by side this has
[1:58:00] been told but now it's come time if you
[1:58:04] if you study your Bible you'll tell it
[1:58:05] here in Ezekiel 12 and 22 son of man
[1:58:09] what is the proverb that you have heard
[1:58:11] in the land of Israel saying the days
[1:58:12] are prolonged in every vision field no
[1:58:14] they had actually had a same in Israel
[1:58:17] the divisions are failing the days are
[1:58:19] prolonged but it says it like this tell
[1:58:21] them thus saith the Lord I will make
[1:58:23] this proverb to cease and they shall be
[1:58:25] no more use of it as a proverb in Israel
[1:58:27] but I say unto them the days are at hand
[1:58:29] and the effect of every vision the
[1:58:33] effect of every vision in other words
[1:58:36] every vision was going to become
[1:58:38] effective that had been had for that
[1:58:42] carrying away so there comes a time when
[1:58:45] there is an end of delay and the visions
[1:58:49] become effective amen see the Bible
[1:58:52] becomes a new book during that time but
[1:58:56] it's not just it's not just the old
[1:58:58] violin no more Amen it's becoming the
[1:59:00] hand of the master of the visions are
[1:59:02] becoming effective the Bible is becoming
[1:59:04] a new book the story of David is another
[1:59:07] story now the story of Samson is another
[1:59:10] story now the story of Shankar's another
[1:59:12] story now is you see the Bible takes a
[1:59:15] new look
[1:59:16] because when the vision is opened up it
[1:59:18] becomes a clarity of what was really
[1:59:20] trying to be presented in those days for
[1:59:23] this generation that we're living in now
[1:59:25] what's because that you've seen
[1:59:28] here it is at the specific time a mint
[1:59:31] but but we find him the Bible that there
[1:59:33] is a necessity that God would have you
[1:59:36] pray for what he's going to do remember
[1:59:39] he said go and going to the pray that
[1:59:42] God was saying harvesters and laborers
[1:59:43] in the vineyard time the hardest
[1:59:44] relevant said God was going to send him
[1:59:46] anyhow but he asked him to pray for what
[1:59:47] he was going to do it was in the will of
[1:59:49] God now watch because God actually puts
[1:59:51] a presentment in front of you and
[1:59:53] promised that would cause you to pray to
[1:59:55] fulfill the promise that he's made let
[1:59:58] me give you an example of men that
[2:00:00] prayed for things that seems it seems
[2:00:02] crazy to pray for this in the book of
[2:00:04] Job in the 42nd chapter in the third
[2:00:06] verse this is Joe talkin to God and he
[2:00:09] says who has he had as counsel without
[2:00:12] knowledge therefore have I uttered that
[2:00:15] understood not and things that were too
[2:00:17] wonderful of me which I knew not I
[2:00:19] beseech thee therefore and I will speak
[2:00:21] I demand of me declare that one to me

[2:04:05] mile away there's millions of gallons of
[2:04:08] water coming out of the ground and while
[2:04:10] you're sitting on that altar you can
[2:04:12] hear that spring coming out of the
[2:04:14] ground and the historians believe that
[2:04:17] David was sitting on those steps when he
[2:04:19] wrote that song amen he was sitting
[2:04:22] there hearing the sound of the water
[2:04:24] spout and he was sitting on the steps of
[2:04:27] the altar of a dead God saying my soul

[2:07:02] vision in this generation and that
[2:07:04] vision comes from God you've got to
[2:07:06] write a man you've got a right to pray
[2:07:08] watch what's what's brother Branham tell
[2:07:10] you pray for revelation
[2:07:11] what's Apostle Paul in Ephesians 1 when
[2:07:14] he said the Lord Jesus Christ the father
[2:07:15] of glory may he give to you the spirit
[2:07:17] of wisdom and revelation and the
[2:07:19] knowledge of him but the eyes of your
[2:07:21] understanding being lightened that you
[2:07:24] may know the hope of his calling what is
[2:07:26] the riches of his glory inheritance a
[2:07:28] wait a minute you mean you can know the
[2:07:30] hope of the calling you mean your eyes
[2:07:31] can be open you can't have wisdom
[2:07:34] you can't have understanding Amen this
[2:07:36] is not a fairy tale
[2:07:37] this is not this is not somebody making
[2:07:39] up a false hope but here Paul says you
[2:07:42] pray that your eyes be open you pray
[2:07:44] that understanding comes to you
[2:07:46] no man said pray revelation strikes your
[2:07:48] heart that's no greater prevailing power
[2:07:51] than the power of Revelation if you know
[2:07:53] who you are what's the devil gonna do
[2:07:55] with you if you know who you are
[2:07:59] what's the devil gonna do with you it
[2:08:01] don't matter what comes your way you're
[2:08:03] gonna rise up in the morning and say I'm
[2:08:06] the son of God I will sit to this home
[2:08:08] to believe this message in this world I
[2:08:12] didn't know what I was gonna do but when
[2:08:14] God revealed I was a son then that was
[2:08:16] over I was over the devil lost the
[2:08:19] battle right there it's finished see in
[2:08:24] James chapter 1 and verse 5 said if any
[2:08:26] man lack wisdom let him ask God you have
[2:08:30] a right to ask God do you recognize that
[2:08:33] what you're wanting to see is the desire
[2:08:36] of every Asian he said many rich men
[2:08:38] have longed to see many kings have
[2:08:41] desired to see and have not seen them
[2:08:44] but blessed are your eyes blessed are
[2:08:49] your ears for you see what they long to
[2:08:51] see and you see it now you you've heard
[2:08:54] what they look listen friend can you
[2:08:57] know I don't know if I can present it
[2:09:00] the way that I see it but you're blessed
[2:09:02] you're blessed people and I don't know I
[2:09:05] don't know sometimes if we really
[2:09:07] connect with the reality of the
[2:09:08] blessings on our lives but they don't
[2:09:10] matter to me if you've got enough money
[2:09:11] to pay your house payment you're blessed
[2:09:13] if you're in this word and you're
[2:09:16] reading this message and you're
[2:09:17] believing it in your heart you're a
[2:09:19] blessed individual
[2:09:21] you don't matter what else is happening
[2:09:22] in your life you're blessed amen I
[2:09:26] believe that with all of my heart I want
[2:09:29] you to do me a favor now you turn around
[2:09:31] and tell somebody beside you you're
[2:09:32] blessed do you do you realize do you
[2:09:46] realize that if the preachers don't
[2:09:48] preach this the rocks are going to do
[2:09:54] you know that if I could put a
[2:09:56] microphone on the tree out there he
[2:09:58] would preach my sermon this morning if I
[2:10:01] could knock the tree there's a life
[2:10:03] running in that tree saying to you young
[2:10:05] lady
[2:10:05] come on you're a daughter of God do it
[2:10:09] you can do it my son
[2:10:11] that's right if I could knock the grass
[2:10:15] out there the Bible said all great
[2:10:17] creation groaneth the station of the
[2:10:22] sons of God you see the rock we're doing
[2:10:25] the rock knows more about you than you
[2:10:27] know about you come on church the rock
[2:10:30] was there the rock was there is so
[2:10:33] creation it a rock know what happened in
[2:10:35] the garden the rock knows the rock knows
[2:10:39] that King was killed Abel the rock knows
[2:10:42] the rock knows the rock seen all of it
[2:10:45] he heard all of it come on amen and the
[2:10:48] rock can preach it
[2:10:49] hey man the rock can preach it but I
[2:10:51] don't know about you but I go letting a
[2:10:53] rock take my place
[2:10:54] [Applause]
[2:10:59] it's my message oh that's right
[2:11:10] Moses had his day David had his day
[2:11:13] Luther had his day Wesley had his day
[2:11:15] but this is your day mister sure this is
[2:11:19] your time you're the you're the one in
[2:11:22] the scene now the vision has changed to
[2:11:25] to bring and incorporate a bride into
[2:11:27] that and in and to think that this very
[2:11:30] message the thing that people have tried
[2:11:32] to shut up is the very thing that God is
[2:11:34] said to make you aware and open the
[2:11:37] vision to your life to help me the
[2:11:39] vision if you've got your answer might
[2:11:41] call you and say I've got a dream for
[2:11:42] you and then they don't tell you you're
[2:11:45] not tell me the dream you told me you
[2:11:46] had a dream tell me the dream God said
[2:11:49] to you I have a vision I say God tell me
[2:11:51] the vision if a preachers don't preach
[2:11:54] to me tell me the vision but what is in
[2:11:56] my life what what is God about to do for
[2:11:59] me
[2:11:59] give me the vision let me know what the
[2:12:01] vision is you see this vision this
[2:12:04] vision this vision your vision Daniel
[2:12:07] saw didn't he Daniel saw your vision
[2:12:11] Daniel said the wise shall know their
[2:12:13] God remember he said I sing the books
[2:12:15] open and I heard a voice say to me
[2:12:17] Daniel seal it up until the time of the
[2:12:18] end and when the time of the end
[2:12:20] knowledge shall increase he meant and
[2:12:22] then he said to him what does it what
[2:12:24] does what is the sign of the end when
[2:12:26] show that thing be and he said I saw two
[2:12:28] men one standing on one side of the
[2:12:30] river and one on the other and there was
[2:12:31] a man clothed him why it's standing on
[2:12:33] the river brother man said watch that
[2:12:35] man and white on the river that's the
[2:12:37] Holy Ghost
[2:12:38] he said he's standing on the river the
[2:12:40] waters in the Bible is a multitude of
[2:12:43] people he said when you see the Holy
[2:12:46] Ghost on the people it's the sign that
[2:12:49] God give Daniel on the end
[2:12:51] I meant what happens in the end the Holy
[2:12:54] Ghost comes down and brings himself into
[2:12:57] the church he meant watch Daniels
[2:12:59] ceiling up until the time the in this
[2:13:01] vision was seen but sealed until the end
[2:13:03] time John solid in Revelations 10 John
[2:13:07] said I saw the mighty angel come down
[2:13:09] with a book in his hand I seen him set
[2:13:10] one foot on the land seems that one
[2:13:12] little sea but John's sealing up John's
[2:13:16] sealing up until the seventh angel
[2:13:20] begins to sound what Romans chapter
[2:13:23] eight manifested sons waiting for that
[2:13:25] time and when everything was waiting for
[2:13:29] revelations 10 and verse 7 everything
[2:13:33] waits on that everything waits on the
[2:13:36] prophet of God but when a prophet comes
[2:13:38] the world don't want to receiving but
[2:13:41] when a prophet comes a bride who's in
[2:13:43] the vision was seen accepting the
[2:13:45] message and becoming in the power of God
[2:13:48] in this generation well I'll tell you
[2:13:52] what it pals up after a wild only - it
[2:13:55] piles up after a while it piles up to
[2:13:57] mean something this message is meaning
[2:13:59] something more than just put you in a
[2:14:01] church it's meaning something it's
[2:14:03] meaning your son and daughter of God
[2:14:04] you're that rites are northern
[2:14:06] brightness going to change the body this
[2:14:09] in the vision you like your Bibles I
[2:14:13] love my Bible let's read the Bible a
[2:14:15] minute
[2:14:16] reading second Corinthians I'm watching
[2:14:17] the 3rd chapter and what child here in
[2:14:19] the in the Bible says in the 13th verse
[2:14:22] and not as Moses which put a veil over
[2:14:24] his face but the children of Israel
[2:14:26] could not steadfastly look upon the end
[2:14:28] which is to be abolished but their minds
[2:14:30] were blinded for until the day remain if
[2:14:33] the vail untaken away in the reading of
[2:14:36] the Old Testament which veil is done
[2:14:38] away in Christ but even until this day
[2:14:42] when Moses is the red the veil is upon
[2:14:45] their heart so blinded Minds is veiled
[2:14:50] hearts watch what he says now but
[2:14:53] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[2:14:56] Lord when it shall turn to the Lord now
[2:14:58] do you think Paul don't know that
[2:15:00] Malachi 4 is coming when it when the
[2:15:04] art is turned to the Lord the veil shall
[2:15:08] be taken away so in other words watch
[2:15:10] your eyesight it switches the heart when
[2:15:14] the heart turns the eyes come open the
[2:15:17] switch is not in the mind the switches
[2:15:19] in the heart so when the hardest turned
[2:15:21] the eyes come open there's only one
[2:15:22] ministry that turns the heart and opens
[2:15:25] the eyes and when the eyes come open
[2:15:28] look what he's saying to us he says then
[2:15:30] watch nevertheless then she'll turn the
[2:15:32] Lord the veil should be taken away and
[2:15:34] now the Spirit of the Lord where the
[2:15:36] Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[2:15:37] now now you all I don't have time to
[2:15:40] teach this but to you that study what
[2:15:42] he's speaking of is John chapter 8 the
[2:15:44] Sun is set free it's free indeed for he
[2:15:47] the Sun set free is free indeed remember
[2:15:48] now and it begins to say that the Sun is
[2:15:51] not a servant and brother bam splits the
[2:15:54] Sun and servants in John chapter there
[2:15:56] and he begins to tell you that a servant
[2:15:58] had no inheritance in the land but a son
[2:16:01] had an inheritance in the land so when
[2:16:04] you're free you're free to return to
[2:16:06] your original inheritance so the Liberty
[2:16:09] that God is bringing here is a Liberty
[2:16:11] of Jubilee to return to sonship you were
[2:16:14] already sons
[2:16:15] you were already sons but you didn't
[2:16:18] know it you didn't see it but when the
[2:16:20] heart is turned you'll see your sonship
[2:16:22] was originally with God see it's a
[2:16:25] Liberty to see who you were to begin
[2:16:27] with in God what's what he says because
[2:16:30] we were all with open face beholding as
[2:16:33] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[2:16:35] changing the same image from glory to
[2:16:38] glory even as by the Spirit so Paul is
[2:16:41] telling you when you see this openly it
[2:16:43] changes you when you see it openly it
[2:16:46] changes you now now the same right or
[2:16:48] turn the first Corinthians 13 and watch
[2:16:50] now we won't lose our we won't lose our
[2:16:52] pattern but I want to show you something
[2:16:53] here in first Corinthians 13 what's Paul
[2:16:55] start with he starts with love is that
[2:16:57] right
[2:16:57] and he starts telling you about love and
[2:16:59] we know that love it's the capstone is
[2:17:02] that right
[2:17:02] love is the capstone now watch when Paul
[2:17:04] comes down to the be end of the verses
[2:17:06] here in the eleventh verse he said when
[2:17:07] I was a child but we just go above it
[2:17:10] not first when we know in part and we
[2:17:11] should prophesy in part but when that
[2:17:14] which is perfect is come that would
[2:17:15] impart has done away now watch there's
[2:17:18] no more parts to be added so you no more
[2:17:21] have the message in parts you see you
[2:17:25] now you've got the message and it's
[2:17:27] added apart added about mr. data part
[2:17:29] Lutheran's added apart Western had a
[2:17:30] part but now there's some more parts to
[2:17:32] be added now you have perfection when
[2:17:35] does perfection come at the same time
[2:17:37] that love comes so the cat stole now
[2:17:40] comes in view at the same time
[2:17:42] perfection is upon the earth now watch
[2:17:44] what he says for he says for now we see
[2:17:46] through a glass darkly but then face to
[2:17:49] face so Paul is saying at my time I'm
[2:17:53] seeing through a glass darkly but then
[2:17:57] when perfection comes you'll see it face
[2:17:59] to face
[2:18:00] now what's Paul just done he's just laid
[2:18:04] expectation before you he's just told
[2:18:07] you I'm seeing it darkly now but there's
[2:18:10] come at a time
[2:18:12] perfection is coming to the church amen
[2:18:15] now watch what he's doing he's setting
[2:18:17] your expectation above the gifts now I
[2:18:21] don't believe in gifts God uses gifts
[2:18:24] and that uses me and gifts oh I believe
[2:18:25] in gifts but gifts as gifts is apart but
[2:18:27] watch Amen it's like I don't know if
[2:18:30] some of you raised your kids and you
[2:18:31] bought them Walmart toys I bought my
[2:18:33] kids while my toys my daughter owns
[2:18:34] Walmart dolls and tell my mother-in-law
[2:18:36] started buying them 100 dolls and then
[2:18:39] she had to buy the dolls from that home
[2:18:42] but but but it's like your kids is in
[2:18:45] the floor and they're playing with dolls
[2:18:47] they're playing with Walmart doll and
[2:18:48] they got a Walmart truck and it's three
[2:18:49] or four dollars for this and three or
[2:18:51] four dollars there and they have those
[2:18:52] things and then you walk in and say hey
[2:18:55] kids how would you like to go to
[2:18:56] Disneyland
[2:18:57] si si they was ok with what they had
[2:19:00] until you said let's go to Disneyland
[2:19:03] all of a sudden what they're playing
[2:19:06] with has lost its value in the idea that
[2:19:11] we're going to Disneyland
[2:19:12] come on church we ain't losing nothing
[2:19:16] you're not losing nothing it's
[2:19:18] Disneyland you see once a we're not
[2:19:21] losing anything this is the coming of
[2:19:24] the Lord we're not losing we're gaining
[2:19:26] the powers of God in the fulfillment of
[2:19:29] the word of promise in this age Amen
[2:19:32] when I start looking at this I see the
[2:19:34] scriptures now start bringing start
[2:19:36] bringing perfect sense now you're up
[2:19:37] Bible studies so you know what 2nd Peter
[2:19:40] says don't you it says that there should
[2:19:42] be added to faith and knowledge and
[2:19:43] temperance and godless brother the
[2:19:45] constant once you go right up the ladder
[2:19:46] what's the last thing it's love it's
[2:19:49] capstone right at the coming of the
[2:19:51] capstone follow the scripture right
[2:19:53] after the capstone comes Peter says
[2:19:55] there would be an entrance ministered
[2:19:58] unto you abundantly amen at the time of
[2:20:04] the coming capstone perfections coming
[2:20:07] abundance is going to be preached but
[2:20:11] glass will be seen clean clarity our
[2:20:14] hearts will be turned what's what he's
[2:20:16] doing he's placing all of this at the
[2:20:18] capstone time amen what's in first John
[2:20:22] chapter 3 beloved what manner of love is
[2:20:24] this the father it bestowed upon you to
[2:20:26] call you the sons of God what manner two
[2:20:28] kinds right one of them was agape love
[2:20:31] at the coming of agape love you start
[2:20:34] understanding sonship but watch what he
[2:20:36] goes on to say but when he shall appear
[2:20:37] we shall be like him for we shall see
[2:20:40] him as he is
[2:20:43] how many realizes this message is the
[2:20:46] appearing of the Lord sure amen watch
[2:20:50] what brother BAM does he comes alone and
[2:20:52] says now the Bible says all the
[2:20:53] mysteries will be revealed in Revelation
[2:20:55] 10 7 - watch now because there's a great
[2:20:58] question on who's Melchizedek this is
[2:21:00] that right
[2:21:01] Melchizedek was God but when you brother
[2:21:03] man chases it down in the scripture he
[2:21:05] goes back and picks up Abraham a vision
[2:21:07] in the Old Testament and picks up
[2:21:09] Abraham and says watch Melchizedek
[2:21:11] talking to Abraham and he's reading his
[2:21:14] his heart and he's telling him who he
[2:21:16] says now what was that but the word he
[2:21:18] said that was the word discerning the
[2:21:20] heart of Sarah that was discerning the
[2:21:21] heart of Abraham that was the word he
[2:21:24] said see in the beginning was the word
[2:21:25] and the
[2:21:27] was with god and the word was god so
[2:21:29] Melchizedek was God in the word formed
[2:21:33] theophany is that right and Sophie often
[2:21:36] he had stepped in the flesh and had
[2:21:38] talked to Abraham that was in the vision
[2:21:40] but it was still under a glass darkly we
[2:21:44] seen the vision but we didn't see the
[2:21:46] clarity but when Melchizedek appears
[2:21:49] then we shall see him as he is and we
[2:21:52] shall be like him
[2:21:55] amen watch now because when we see
[2:21:58] Melchizedek like he is he meant we did
[2:22:00] have no clue that we had a theophany we
[2:22:04] knew God had a theophany we had no clue
[2:22:06] we had theophany but when milk acid had
[2:22:09] come among us all the sudden it opens up
[2:22:11] the revelation it's not just God that
[2:22:14] has something offered he you have a
[2:22:16] theophany
[2:22:17] and to think right now that if they
[2:22:19] search the tabernacle be dissolved we
[2:22:21] have one already waiting in the heavens
[2:22:23] it's in the vision that we haven't been
[2:22:26] often in this morning hey man then
[2:22:28] what's they're never going to do to us
[2:22:29] you destroy this body but we've done a
[2:22:32] theophany another tabernacle all we were
[2:22:34] already waiting
[2:22:35] what's the scripture now because what is
[2:22:38] starting to do is it's starting to clear
[2:22:39] up
[2:22:39] it's starting to clear up who you are
[2:22:42] the vision becomes clear and then watch
[2:22:43] because it follows follow the scripture
[2:22:45] now we'll close very quickly follow the
[2:22:48] scriptures in the fourth chapter
[2:22:50] therefore seeing we have a ministry as a
[2:22:52] received mercy we faint not but we have
[2:22:54] renounced the hidden things of
[2:22:56] dishonesty walking in crashes nor
[2:22:58] handling the Word of God deceitfully he
[2:23:01] says but by manifestation of truth
[2:23:03] concerning ourselves to every man's
[2:23:05] conscience in the sight of God now how
[2:23:07] did the message come to us not
[2:23:10] dishonestly it not come to us through
[2:23:13] the ideas and little stories and that no
[2:23:15] no no no it came to us by manifestation
[2:23:19] now watch because Paul is going to say
[2:23:22] something that if our gospel be hid it
[2:23:26] is hid to them that are lost in it
[2:23:28] beautiful that Paul uses the word our
[2:23:32] how many ever studied beyond the curtain
[2:23:34] of time and when the prophet of God
[2:23:37] begins to reveal to you that you have
[2:23:39] theophany
[2:23:40] remember milligram goes over there and
[2:23:42] he says these are your converts and all
[2:23:45] of them converts was over there
[2:23:46] listening and they heard the
[2:23:48] conversation between the angel and
[2:23:49] brother branham and brother Graham says
[2:23:51] he says you'll have to come back and be
[2:23:53] judged for what you preached and he says
[2:23:56] well Paul have to be judged for what he
[2:23:58] preached and they said yes Paul had to
[2:24:00] be judged by them said well I preached
[2:24:02] exactly what Paul preached and look what
[2:24:06] it the whole crowd says were resting on
[2:24:09] that william branham and paul had the
[2:24:15] same gospel see paul said if our gospel
[2:24:21] it was it was the same gospel amen and
[2:24:25] here Paul and William branham's gospel
[2:24:27] being the same but if it's hid its hid
[2:24:29] to them that are lost who the god of
[2:24:31] this evil age had blinded their minds
[2:24:33] what's the next word is said lest L est
[2:24:36] lest lest the light of the glorious
[2:24:39] gospel Christ shine unto them into the
[2:24:41] image of God now watch unless in other
[2:24:43] words less than we get the they get
[2:24:45] their hands on this less do you know
[2:24:47] that word L est is the same word used in
[2:24:50] the book of Genesis when Adam and Eve
[2:24:52] sinned and they said we'll go take it
[2:24:54] the tree of life and the Bible said that
[2:24:56] God put cherubs around that tree to keep
[2:24:59] them lest they would take of the Tree of
[2:25:03] Life so there was something keeping them
[2:25:05] from taking the Tree of Life see and
[2:25:09] that was keeping them from that but if
[2:25:12] this gospel be hid its hid to them lost
[2:25:14] listen so if this gospel is opening up
[2:25:17] it's opening up the way for you to take
[2:25:20] the Tree of Life do you ever notice
[2:25:25] revelation 22 the way it's written that
[2:25:27] John comes at a time when he's kneeling
[2:25:30] down to worship one who he thinks is
[2:25:31] Jesus Christ and at that same time
[2:25:34] brother Kevin when he's trying to
[2:25:35] worship that angel that angel said don't
[2:25:37] worship Me he said I'm only one of the
[2:25:40] Brethren I'm a prophet that what he told
[2:25:43] him and when when that ministry came
[2:25:46] what's John John was told not to worship
[2:25:49] him worship God
[2:25:52] then that angel told him John it's times
[2:25:54] at hand now unseal the book sound the
[2:25:59] trumpet release the prophecies watch
[2:26:03] that same angel was revelation chapter
[2:26:07] 10 and verse 7 once a mighty angel come
[2:26:10] down from heaven don't don't open it yet
[2:26:12] John but when the seventh angel sounds
[2:26:14] then you open it John right
[2:26:17] when the seventh angel sounds here we
[2:26:19] are in revelations 22 and here we are
[2:26:21] with an angel standing there who John's
[2:26:24] trying to worship but said John released
[2:26:26] the book now that ministry was the
[2:26:29] difference between the vision being
[2:26:31] clear and the vision being held what's
[2:26:35] what's what's John here he is in
[2:26:37] revelations of fifth chapter and John is
[2:26:39] seeing that there's no one worthy to
[2:26:41] take that book is that right
[2:26:43] John said I couldn't take the book that
[2:26:45] liyan he said that no man in heaven or
[2:26:48] earth was worthy until the lamb come and
[2:26:50] took the book in Revelations the fifth
[2:26:52] chapter John is forbidden to take the
[2:26:55] book but in revelations of death chapter
[2:26:57] after the seventh verse John is
[2:27:00] commanded to come and take the book
[2:27:02] you've got to come now and take the book
[2:27:05] chop a mint take this book and eat this
[2:27:08] book and the word shall be in thy mouth
[2:27:11] Amen do you see what he said he meant to
[2:27:13] tip whenever this message came you've
[2:27:16] got a right to take of the tree of life
[2:27:18] may I say to you this morning you've got
[2:27:20] a right to the Tree of Life you've got a
[2:27:23] right to pray but the message we preach
[2:27:25] you've got a right to believe the
[2:27:27] message of the hour you've got a right
[2:27:29] to seek the revelation of the word
[2:27:31] you've got a right to feed upon the
[2:27:34] unfailing body word of the son of man
[2:27:36] listen friends that's exactly what a
[2:27:38] heavy right did that's exactly what
[2:27:41] heavy right done he meant Hattie Wright
[2:27:43] was feeding on the right thing when she
[2:27:46] heard brother BAM tell the story of
[2:27:47] those swirls is that right when she
[2:27:50] heard the story them squirrels and she
[2:27:51] said that's nothing but the truth
[2:27:54] remember both men said now you say
[2:27:56] whatever you'll have Hattie
[2:27:57] and had had he been studying Oral
[2:28:00] Roberts ministry she would have asked
[2:28:02] for that million dollars hey men she
[2:28:08] would have asked for that healing amen
[2:28:11] but she had been feeding on something
[2:28:13] else come and take the bukchon
[2:28:17] and eat the book prophecy and the word
[2:28:20] will be in my mouth and John said I ate
[2:28:23] the book fulfillment and the word was in
[2:28:26] my mouth he meant this morning friends
[2:28:29] if you're feeding on this message you're
[2:28:31] feeding on the tree of life but it's
[2:28:33] coming to you in this age and the words
[2:28:36] of life is coming to you I'll tell you
[2:28:38] this morning it's time for the Bride of
[2:28:39] Christ to tell the devil amen this is as
[2:28:42] far as you're going
[2:28:44] Amen that's as far as you're going devil
[2:28:46] we've come far enough now I'm throwing
[2:28:48] my shoulders back

[2:28:51] on the Word of God I'm speaking the word
[2:28:54] against you I will not put up with you
[2:28:56] no more Amen listen I I think it's too
[2:28:59] much now that but the mothers are
[2:29:00] starting to have been worried a little
[2:29:02] bit whether it was true or not what the
[2:29:03] Prophet said to you but that's a token
[2:29:06] to you mothers you claim them children
[2:29:08] and they will come don't you let the
[2:29:11] devil talk you out of that don't you let
[2:29:13] the devil push you back on that it's
[2:29:15] written in the book of Isaiah the 65th
[2:29:17] chapter they shall be their will their
[2:29:19] offsprings
[2:29:21] I don't know how God's gonna do it but
[2:29:23] it's the word of the Lord and I look at
[2:29:27] the troubles I look at the circumstances
[2:29:30] but fish and it's fair to look at this
[2:29:32] morning come on friends you can't just
[2:29:34] keep looking at the world you got to
[2:29:36] look at the vision you're going to put
[2:29:37] your eyes on the vision you got to put
[2:29:39] your eyes on this word and begin to
[2:29:41] preach it and focus and let your heart
[2:29:43] by the way you don't know what I'm going
[2:29:45] through you don't know what others have
[2:29:46] went through and you know why you don't
[2:29:49] know cuz they didn't tell you every time
[2:29:52] you stop they don't tell you their
[2:29:53] problems they don't tell you sir well
[2:29:55] that's so-and-so they got the best live
[2:29:56] in that night they got as many problems
[2:29:58] as you
[2:29:59] the difference is they ain't telling
[2:30:01] everybody the problems they're telling
[2:30:03] everybody how good Jesus is not a vision
[2:30:13] with your head down and barely coming to
[2:30:15] church that's not the vision the vision
[2:30:17] is the Church of God where their
[2:30:19] shoulders back their foot on the devil
[2:30:22] their heart full of the Holy Ghost the
[2:30:24] power
[2:30:26] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:30:29] I know things get bad brother III see it
[2:30:33] I'm not I'm not ignorant to it Amen but
[2:30:36] I don't choose to talk about it nice
[2:30:39] tell them brother Samuel in the back
[2:30:40] room this one said you know I said I
[2:30:42] just went through a study on the church
[2:30:43] ages and I was in the church age book
[2:30:45] and I come down to that verse where John
[2:30:46] said he was only-- Isle of Patmos and
[2:30:48] and you know what I told him I said I
[2:30:51] spent two days studying it says most
[2:30:53] unfruitful study I ever had in my life
[2:30:54] I studied two whole days on the Isle of
[2:30:57] Patmos and you know why it was the most
[2:30:59] untruthful thing you can't find nothing
[2:31:01] about it you know it you know that John
[2:31:04] wrote three other books besides the book
[2:31:06] of Revelation and you can't find one
[2:31:08] mention of any situation he faced on the
[2:31:12] Isle of Patmos in animation that it took
[2:31:15] a historian to tell you John got bold
[2:31:17] and all because John never told you but
[2:31:20] John wrote entire three other books and
[2:31:23] the book of Revelation and he never
[2:31:26] expressed what he went through on the
[2:31:27] Isle of Patmos but he rather wrote the
[2:31:30] revelation of Jesus Christ I bet you
[2:31:32] don't know what he went through other
[2:31:34] than he was there I'm sure there were
[2:31:35] hardships but John knew rapturing faith
[2:31:38] was never coming to you by telling you
[2:31:40] how bad of trouble he was having on
[2:31:42] Patmos but the power that was coming to
[2:31:45] the church what's going to be the
[2:31:47] revelation of Jesus Christ and there's a
[2:31:49] revelation this morning for every
[2:31:51] believer sitting here Matt revelation is
[2:31:54] bringing your life up in the power of
[2:31:56] God it's a clear vision this morning hey
[2:31:59] you you're showing up with your foot on
[2:32:01] the devil
[2:32:03] brother I'm ready I'm ready to fulfill
[2:32:05] the vision he foots on the devil your
[2:32:09] heart's full of the Holy Ghost life is
[2:32:11] in your soul speaking the Word of God
[2:32:14] I spelled the church some time ago
[2:32:18] brother I think it was brother telling
[2:32:19] the admin told me he said by the way
[2:32:22] night he said he's seen it maybe I may
[2:32:23] have told you I don't know he said Cena
[2:32:25] he's seen a story about a about a about
[2:32:27] a about a cat in a mouse it was at a
[2:32:29] wedding supper and the story goes that
[2:32:32] the cat get after the mouse chased him
[2:32:33] all over the building there after a wild
[2:32:35] little mouse he went up across the table
[2:32:37] and felling the window on that little
[2:32:40] mouse swim across the wine boat got up
[2:32:42] on the out the other side and when he
[2:32:43] came up outside that window he said he
[2:32:45] got up on the side of the boat and
[2:32:46] stretched his shoulders back said where
[2:32:48] is that cat that Devils running you all
[2:32:54] over the place but I think it's time to
[2:32:56] get in the wine bowl let's get the
[2:32:58] stimulation of the revelation of this
[2:33:00] message in our soul who is that devil
[2:33:03] honey mother tell him he's a liar but
[2:33:06] that was a liar this morning we're the
[2:33:08] sons and daughters of God were not here
[2:33:10] bluffing there's something in us we've
[2:33:12] heard the call but some reality to this
[2:33:15] message
[2:33:17] thousands of indications vision
[2:33:20] Activision's a man I listened to
[2:33:22] hundreds of tapes and listened to
[2:33:24] hundreds of tapes and you know what in
[2:33:27] the Bible the Bible said Jesus had a
[2:33:29] ministry of visions do you know William
[2:33:31] Branham had a ministry visions do you
[2:33:33] know that those discernments were
[2:33:35] visions in the scriptures and that
[2:33:36] discernments he had in the end of those
[2:33:38] tapes were actual vision do you know
[2:33:40] that little woman at the whale heard one
[2:33:42] vision from Jesus one vision of a filthy
[2:33:45] prostitute heard the Jesus say to her
[2:33:49] you've got six husbands ones five
[2:33:51] husbands ones you're living with now is
[2:33:52] not yours and she said sir I perceive
[2:33:54] your profit do you know the tapes that
[2:33:57] you have almost every one of them on the
[2:34:00] end has got five to ten visions of a
[2:34:03] prophet discerning the heart of the
[2:34:04] people amen and listen that woman hurt
[2:34:08] that one time and said serve your
[2:34:09] prophet how much are our faith be this
[2:34:12] morning
[2:34:13] in listening to all of those sermons and
[2:34:15] hearing that prophet say those things in
[2:34:18] this generation I'll tell you what one
[2:34:19] thing that I've rejoiced it's the thing
[2:34:21] sometimes you don't find on the tape but
[2:34:24] things you don't find you don't find
[2:34:25] what happened to John it's a rejoicing
[2:34:27] because John didn't tell it he focused
[2:34:29] somewhere else
[2:34:30] there's another beautiful thing you
[2:34:31] never hear and that's on the tapes and
[2:34:33] you hear brother BAM with service after
[2:34:35] service after service tell people what
[2:34:37] their history was but their names was
[2:34:39] what their addresses was what their car
[2:34:41] wrecks were about what their injuries
[2:34:42] were what their surgeries was what the
[2:34:44] doctor said to him what happened they
[2:34:45] were little kids things that he had no
[2:34:47] clue about you nothing I never heard on
[2:34:50] a tape I've never heard one of them
[2:34:52] people on that tape say brother Branham
[2:34:54] that's not right but every one has
[2:34:59] always said that's nothing but the truth
[2:35:03] amen do you believe this morning you got
[2:35:05] a right to believe you got a right to
[2:35:08] love this word you've got a right in
[2:35:11] this vision this vision is of you this
[2:35:13] morning and you have a right to move
[2:35:15] forward in what God has set for your
[2:35:17] life listen friends I'm ready to step in
[2:35:21] the vision of God fill its power in your
[2:35:25] life this morning step into it and feel
[2:35:27] it feel the power come into you you can
[2:35:30] stand in laugh at the enemy you
[2:35:33] understand brother Ram said there's a
[2:35:34] place that a son of God can go the devil
[2:35:36] don't even know what to do with him see
[2:35:41] you're a part of that vision today
[2:35:44] you're a part of that vision if I don't
[2:35:48] tell you this the trees are going to
[2:35:50] you're a part of this vision that vision
[2:35:54] opening up in our lives gives us a place
[2:35:56] this morning that we can step a fire our
[2:35:58] musicians could come I'm a part of this
[2:36:01] visions you're a part of this vision but
[2:36:05] but do you know brother Branham had to
[2:36:07] make his choice standing over that child
[2:36:12] he had to make his choice to be a part
[2:36:15] of that vision that's what the vision
[2:36:18] said
[2:36:19] but brother man said when I recognized
[2:36:21] what I was where I was standing he said
[2:36:25] then I just it was just drama you ever
[2:36:30] talked to people that was a part of a
[2:36:31] vision sometimes they didn't even know
[2:36:32] it they didn't even realize it was
[2:36:35] happening but all of a sudden their
[2:36:43] lives become real and they see they see
[2:36:47] where they come from they see where
[2:36:50] they're going I believe this morning
[2:36:51] Rance
[2:36:51] I believe the Holy Spirit has given us a
[2:36:55] right a right to the Tree of Life got a
[2:37:02] right to love God this morning we've got
[2:37:06] a right to loving we got a right to
[2:37:08] serving I know what it is for the devil
[2:37:14] to pile on yeah and I know what that
[2:37:17] feels like
[2:37:17] I remember when I was about 21 years old
[2:37:20] and I was I you know sometimes young
[2:37:22] people grow up in church
[2:37:24] and there you know is TV and then they
[2:37:26] want out of church but they're in church
[2:37:28] so this was like they're in prison and
[2:37:30] their heart they really want to be out
[2:37:32] there but they're in here well that was
[2:37:35] just opposite of what I was I grew up in
[2:37:38] the world from time I was nine year old
[2:37:40] to time I was 20 and I wanted to be in
[2:37:41] church and I was in the world yeah but
[2:37:44] there was something that there was
[2:37:45] things that I couldn't get over spirits
[2:37:48] I couldn't get delivered from I didn't
[2:37:50] understand how that I could do it but
[2:37:54] when the Holy Spirit began to deal with
[2:37:55] my life and begin to bring me in I found
[2:37:59] out that that at some point there that
[2:38:01] this was actually a choice God gave to
[2:38:04] me and if it's my choice I'm gonna serve
[2:38:08] God sometimes sometimes the enemy
[2:38:13] sometimes the enemy tells you that
[2:38:16] you've been too far it's not the vision
[2:38:22] sometimes the enemy says you went too
[2:38:24] far he twists Hebrew six it's amazing
[2:38:26] how a twist the wording he'll twist that
[2:38:28] word around to make it say something he
[2:38:29] doesn't say you can't make the word lie
[2:38:33] and John 5:24 it said he that hears my
[2:38:36] word or the words been quickened too has
[2:38:39] already passed him death in life and
[2:38:40] shall not come into condemnation how can
[2:38:45] you take Hebrew six and make John 5:24
[2:38:47] lie so Hebrews six is saying something
[2:38:51] different than people think it is
[2:38:52] brother Brent said see there's two seeds
[2:38:54] there and one of them is a seed of God
[2:38:56] the other the seed of the world and the
[2:38:58] Holy Ghost falls on both seeds now watch
[2:39:02] when that Holy Spirit begins to fall on
[2:39:04] that seed and you begin to you begin to
[2:39:06] realize so so I tell you what I tell a
[2:39:09] lot of people this whenever the devil
[2:39:11] tells me you went too far and you can
[2:39:13] never repent and you can't come back to
[2:39:15] God and you can use the kids you done
[2:39:17] that it I'll tell you what I tell them I
[2:39:19] said well if it don't matter they've
[2:39:20] allowed to serve the Lord then if I went
[2:39:27] too far it don't matter what I do so I'm
[2:39:29] just come serve God don't matter what I
[2:39:33] do I'm lost anyhow I'm just going to
[2:39:34] serve the Lord it's best life a man can
[2:39:37] live I'm going to serve the Lord and
[2:39:39] loving but if he puts me in hell and
[2:39:40] I'll go there but but for now this is
[2:39:42] the best thing could happen for any
[2:39:43] man's life
[2:39:44] come on love God serve all my soul my
[2:39:47] mind my box so some point you some point
[2:39:51] you got to stand up to the devil you got
[2:39:54] to stand up and say look I'm done you
[2:39:56] push me all you're gonna push me you've
[2:39:57] took me as far as you're gonna push I'm
[2:39:58] standing up this morning I don't know
[2:40:01] maybe maybe right here this morning

[2:40:06] pushing you and keep pushing you and
[2:40:08] keep pushing you and you feel like the
[2:40:10] pushed one but you know what you don't
[2:40:13] have to take that anymore
[2:40:17] you don't have to take that anymore

[2:40:23] you this morning that you can accept you
[2:40:26] can accept the payment made you can
[2:40:28] accept the price paid I wonder here this
