[Music] Oh [Music] hallelujah only matters that you testimony tonight God is good he is so good a man let's just look in the word of the Lord tonight I invite you to the Scriptures Genesis chapter 31 let's just look at verse 1 verse 2 verse 1 and he heard the words of Laban sons saying Jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers that which was our fathers hath he gotten all this glory and Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban and behold it was not toward him as before I want you to notice here in verse 1 and then into verse 2 there is an effect and there is a change that has taken place that Jacob notices the change of the countenance that's toward him so the countenance itself may have been fine with everything else and with everyone else but what was different is is the countenance of Laban toward him that's what was different and defined that how that God allowed all of this to come to pass to get Jacob back into position it's amazing sometimes the things that God permits and allows to come our way to get us back in position but he and his infinite wisdom knows exactly what he's doing amen let's just pray tonight Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're so thankful that you've given us another opportunity Lord to be able to come together and father you see Lord the greatness of the needs Lord that are here Lord many of the requests Lord that have been mentioned here father Lord you know those needs Lord we think Lorna just receiving a text Lord concerning that of sister Elizabeth Collins Lord just moments Lord ago Lord how that the doctors Lord they they've they've just given her up more they want to take her off of life support they feel that it's you inhumane Lord but they're leaving the decision in her hands but Lord we believe dear God that it's in your hands so Lord Jesus were just asking Lord God for your presence Lord we're asking God for your Lord for your touch Lord your Healing Touch Lord to move down Lord for even now Lord even now Lord Jesus all it would need or God is just a nod from you Lord God just a nod father we just ask Lord God for our sister Lord we ask Lord that father that your presence Lord would just move there Lord father in this time in this moment Lord dear God we also want to ask Lord a special request lord for sister crest Lord your God I just pray that you'll just Lord give wisdom and direction Lord for those things that Lord they're looking Lord and contemplating on doing Lord father we just pray that God that you would move Lord that regardless Lord with another ball and socket but we're asking that you Lord would Lord move upon the tissue and the sinew the tendons ligaments Lord I don't know all the terms but lord I know just to pray and their God you know how to direct the stone Lord and father we're standing as believers together Lord and just asking that you'll just move our sister Lord and brother Dave as well Lord in the midst of this time Lord father we just commit Lord this through these needs in your hands and we ask that you would just Lord take your word tonight and just speak to us in a real personal way Lord deal with our hearts Lord and I pray that God you would just have your way Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you being seated I didn't get a chance to mention that to you before we pray but we're brother Richard and I were had to we took off there in the to noon as more towards evening yesterday when mr. krest we'd got the call and we went over to pray with our sister and they were brother Dave and in that time and it was much much more painful which you can imagine than what it had been on the the previous times and what they're looking at right now is possibly doing you know how things go some of you there's been with insurances and operations you know how things work when it comes to surgery you need this surgery here and this would be the best fit but because of obser days and insurance you got to go through this to get through this to get to this and so right now what they're looking at doing and we were setting in there last night and even when the one surgeon who actually just was there to put it back in place with just manipulating it they're they're looking at putting in a ball-and-socket that's actually connected so that it would it's in no it wouldn't be plastic it's a glass and so they're looking at doing that and they have possibly thought that it is with the back surgery she's had is that the back muscles themselves are weak and it's not allowing it's not keeping the hip in place and it's allowing it to slip back so it's actually moving back but you know I believe this with all my heart that God just does not put in his word concerning things in the spiritual when he spoke of those dry bones and sinew and flesh but he's the Living God and that same God still moves in our lives and restores what we have needed I believe we've got witnesses right here tonight amen I'm a witness of that so we just want to keep the sister-sister crescent prayer and also as I mentioned to you from a brother Chuck Collins he just had had sent this to me just moments ago and and I just read it word by word it's tough too long it says at this time doctors met with the family and and said that they are finished with her case and that they are asking her he wants to unplug the life-support they felt that it was inhumane to keep her alive but they left it up to her so let's just as we've prayed for her and let's just keep our even upon our hearts as the word of the Lord is being ministered when we look at this thought I want to just speak to you tonight here just take a little a little thought here I actually thought I was thought it was gonna be moving a little bit further and but the Lord just really directed me back to some things here within the scripture I want to speak tonight on why is the countenance changed why is the countenance changed if you look in verse 3 as we keep on reading here the scripture says and the Lord said unto Jacob return unto the land of thy father's and to that kindred and I will be with thee Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock and said unto them I see your father's countenance that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with me so here is Jacob he he is very much aware that the countenance toward him has changed and to see how that God himself has permitted this countenance to be changed toward Jacob to would calls Jacob then to really begin to move in fulfillment of where the Holy Spirit was already dealing with his heart when Joseph was born to come on back to the land so when we look at this what I want to focus on is this this thought and this word where where that Jacob himself can see his father or the father's countenance being changed and this word countenance is a familiar word that we see you sometimes it's used as the word presents face in person but it's the word Pinilla and when you we look at it like we looked at it last week when Jacob had arrived in Iran he had arrived with much of a a great welcoming and a greeting when Laban found out who was there he was welcomed heartily it was just embraced and Laban you know makes a statement that you are bone of my bone you know your of my bone and your of my flesh you're my kindred and and what a what a wonderful thing what a term of endearment it was more than just a greeting it was to a term that would endear Jacob with with Laban and you know Jacob was aware of this countenance and now there is a there's a great contrast from where this countenance was to wear this countenance is now and when we we think of that you know the question that would arise within that is what has happened what has changed why is it that Jacobs or Labels countenance is changed toward Jacob now we can look at it and we understand that God is working and orchestrating everything behind the scenes but yet when we notice this as we go into the scripture here that it wasn't just something that changed on its own but there are things that actually set in motion to bring about this change and here we find that when Jacob himself the scripture said in verse 1 that we read when when when he had heard the words of Laban son so Jacob has heard these words these were not just thoughts of Laban sons but this was speech this was utterance that had been spoken by Laban sons and these were not just words that were just left out there but it shows us the power of words and the wind things that they have said are when we look at it that it says Jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers has he gotten all this glory when we look at it they are communicating and saying things that really are not true but they within their words now look here Jacob the flocks have prospered not just under his care but the wages that have been agreed upon by Laban when Laban had fully recognized you know that I know that since you've come here that my house has been blessed they Laban said I've learned that by experience so here Laban is aware that really the blessing on this house because Lathan was already you know one who was a herdsmen a shepherd and so forth but it wasn't that that brought increase to his house it's because Jacob had come to his house and it wasn't so much Jacob as the man it was God who was there with Jacob for God it said I will be with thee so Laban noticed these words that are communicated are actually turning Laban s-- countenance but it's causing Laban to look at it in a different way than what it really is it's causing Laban to look at it like look he has taken this from me he has stolen this from me but he didn't it was firmly agreed upon so you see sometimes just the way that words can be projected and from the slant it's not altogether just the words it's the spirit that travels behind the words because it's that spirit that moves behind the words that can actually bring an effect when those words are received so there's no wonder that Paul you know it would speak about how that we are to have a speech that's not a corrupt communication and how that we can see that within this even though that Jacob and Laban here they are existing in the same plot of land or you know still around together but there's a separation there's a division and you know sometimes friends it's not so much a countenance or the person or the face of an individual so much sometimes that's very noticeable itself but sometimes it's deeper than that it's something that is deep within that though there may be smiles on the outside but the inside may be so troubled and full of torment but you see God is interested not just in how that we look out here but God is interested in how we look here because if God can bring it to where it's here then what comes out of here will affect here in a genuine way because of it smiles out of here and yet within there's something else we want to make sure that everything itself is lining up the right way and if we need help God is here to help us so when we look at this that words themselves and I want you to think of this tonight words can be sometimes words you know just like on a text and sometimes you know even on an email or whatever more you know sometimes those those forms of communication are okay maybe if you need to document stuff and everything else you know it's it's it's okay to communicate in that manner but sometimes things can be taken totally out of context and you get the one what did you mean what does he mean here what does she mean here what and sometimes you know you just have to put the question marks what do you mean now don't tell me I'm the only one that does that y'all do it too I wonder what it means because you don't always have I've got the right interpretation but you want to know what is it that is meant here well what is it that's being said and so when we look at it the words themselves received in the wrong channel and once you think of this sometimes into how that the countenance itself can be affected by wrong words and then there are other times that words themselves and they are actually true words but they're received in the wrong Channel and it can bring an effect on the countenance itself so just think of this for a moment because when we're looking at this here let me just to move in just a little bit here tonight within this we we recognize that here with Jacob the great parallel that we're looking at here is not only a speaking of how Jacob is being brought into the land but it's also prophecy of how that God would bring back Israel to the ordained place and position that he has for them and we understand that there are things that God it's not national force that puts the bride in glory but it is better the power of God but national force puts Israel back in its own land but how does it become national force when there are spirits that are anointing the nation's are you with me so when we're looking at this and I want you to think of this very much you know we understand you know very much maybe the term or the man known as as Hitler of who was but you know the think of it of how that had that the spirit itself those demon spirits that were released in Revelations 9 that Hitler and Stalin and many of them became channels for those spirits to be projected through and what they were projected at they were projected at the Jews but they're sane spirits and they are not just any spirits they are ecclesiastical devils they are projected at that of the true elect of Almighty God to think of this for a moment here in them in the first seal the Prophet says Martin Luther made the proclamation that all Jews ought to be run off and their buildings burned down because they were Antichrist Martin Luther made that statement his self not God Martin Luther made that statement there's some statements God made through Martin Luther and there's other states Martin Luther made himself same way in every message their statements that william branham made and their statements there that God written God made through the Prophet and what do we want Ian said that we must have listened friends God never intended for us to make everything that the Prophet said thus saith the Lord because the Prophet himself says I am NOT infallible is that right but when brother Branham in himself he displayed in the message his own human desires he displayed human desires for his chilled certain things that he desired to see them in and so forth human desires that he had there are things that even the Prophet would have thoughts upon remember even when he spoke about Martin Luther King and they asked him concerning that what did brother em say concerning that he said that is my opinion that's my thoughts are you with me now now I understand that when I look at everything that the Prophet himself when he says but I will take exactly what he has said but to see that how that within this this this doesn't make any other it doesn't break anything in Scripture because Elijah himself made statements that Elijah made and there are statements that Elijah made that God made through him is that right when Elijah said I'm the only one left who made that statement was that daughter was that Elijah Elijah so there a statement soul brother saying how will we know the Holy Ghost will bring all things back to our remembrance whatsoever he the Holy Ghost has said oh my Martin Luther made that statement his self in his riding now let me just clarify this real quickly I am not in any way sanctioning for a person to say brother bang said this here brother Evan did say this over here brother Brennan they say that listen the Holy Spirit declares all of those things but you know what brother Brennan was not afraid God was not afraid to show the humanity God's not afraid to disclose humanity because why it's not an infallible man it is an infallible God moving through a fallible man but it shows even within this right here how it's necessary to have the same spirit and be in tune with the Holy Spirit Martin Luther made that statement itself in his writings now Hitler just fulfilled what Martin Luther said my lord Martin Luther said it and Hitler fulfilled it well there are other people in that day that there were things that God spoke through Martin Luther and God fulfilled it through them there was there were things that God spoke through there that ripped ahold of the elect heart and that word became personified in their lives so to see how that within this eye this just meant moved me so much when I was thinking of this here of how that Hitler fulfilled words that were spoken by by Luther and Luther's words became a a catalyst catalyst by what that an evil spirit to come behind and an evil spirit to take those words and just somehow magnify them and raise them up to Luther or not - Luther sorry - Hitler and Hitler would go about to fulfill them and it would absolutely change Hitler's countenance think of how deep this is Hitler himself being turned by these words and it shows friends listen this is where it shows within this hour think of this in the Word of God here we have in the Word of God where the Lord Jesus is giving of the Great Commission and at the very end of it in the Great Commission when he says go you there for teaching all nations then baptizing them in the name of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Ghost those were divine perfectly spoken words true words is that right there is a great truth within it but notice when evil spirits come behind those words that's where the Prophet could identify it that it becomes the Trinity a doctrine of devils and yet there is a real truth in that word are you with me there's a real truth but it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal that that's why the Prophet could say in the cross the mystery of God revealed he said the devil has told you those things to make an idolaters out of you so an evil spirit is it possible I ask you is it possible for evil spirits to take things that have been spoken that God has spoken within this word is it possible for evil spirits to take things and so move behind those things and move them out of the right understand that they were spoken here absolutely there is that's why we need real spiritual discernment think about how that when we're looking at this we want to have our countenance that it would reflect the true understanding of the Lord now in Exodus chapter one verse eight the scripture says of how that there was a a new king that arose up there over Egypt which knew not Joseph and brother Brandon makes the statement like this and I I just have been meditating on this for a few weeks this this one who rose up knew not Joseph and the Prophet says that was the beginning of the beginning it just had to be one who didn't know it rose up first it started to set things in motion there are things that's why that when we look back there in in history and yet you find that winner John F Kennedy was elected there were things that started things in motion but right now we're seeing they were seeing the effects of things that got started in motion back there it all there was a beginning for it but notice where where it comes in now he said unto his people behold the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we he said so there are words that are going for it now notice what his words are doing his words are divisive his words are elevating there's nothing wrong with the word elevating and encouraging and lifting up but it should not bring dissension when the word is lifting the word is elevating there's only one thing that can truly elevate and lift which is edify and that is the love of God even when it is correcting our life his love is edifying because it's separating us from us it's him calling us to himself is that right because as we said before there can be grace he preached to such an extent which it is within the world among many of where things are preached to such an extent to where there's no more conviction at all and yet grace is a wonderful true principle it is an attribute of God but it's not the only attribute that's where Paul that the Spirit of God and Jude could say that there were men who prepped in among us who did what turned the grace of God into lasciviousness they couldn't say there's no grace of God but they motivated by wrong spirit turned it into lasciviousness oh my he's changing here changing the view toward Israel think of this of how that words it can change the view you know words can change the view toward somebody yes sir you can hear a little something on this or that it can turn it can turn if you allow them words to rest it can turn it can turn your countenance your person are you with me you see think of it of how that even when you look at Hagar and and and and and Sarah I remember when when Sarah I had the idea notice this is her idea this is not God's idea her idea of maybe this is what God intended to do and this is how we're going to help the promise along and we're going to do it like this her own thinking and when her own thinking comes about but Hagar conceives and when Hagar conceives immediately Hagar looks down upon Sarah she ought have been grateful but you see Sarah was despised in her eyes think of that why would she be despised in her eyes what was it did the Bible doesn't say that Hagar said anything toward Syria she really didn't have to say anything the pride within her heart such as I'm able to and you're not it has brought a change in countenance that doesn't take discernment as far as a prophet to look into the life to know something's wrong but remember what God said look at when Sarah dealt with her hardly she fled but what did God tell Hagar he said go back and submit yourself unto Sarai thy mistress think of how that here was with Pharoah let me come back to this Cairo goes on to continue to speak to the Egyptians in verse 10 and he said come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when their faileth out any war they join us also under our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land where is this coming from fear fear so the first thing to do within that verse that we looked at before he's beginning to say they're mightier than we are he's beginning to look at them and their project he's projecting to them but here if they continue to go we don't do something they're gonna rise up and turn against us he's sowing seeds to do what turn the countenance of the Egyptians toward Israel and God is allowing it God is permitting it because God has a promise that's going to be fulfilled I think of what the Prophet said in proving his words he said Israel did not know what they were gonna have to go through in order for that promise to be fulfilled oh my aren't you glad that God doesn't let us know every step of the way oh yes sir all we have to know we walked by faith so here the Egyptians actually by these words their pride is actually being lifted but friends there's one thing that is so true about pride pride itself is the result of fear when people are fearful pride rises up it always goes hand in hand together there is just something that's there some some the fear pride will rise up so this word what is this we're doing out of fear it is causing the people to rise up and look down upon Israel hmm therefore they did set them task masters to afflict them with their burdens they built for pharaoh treasure cities plank them and RAM premises but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew Oh God let that be our testimony I don't want it to read but the more that they afflicted the more Samuel complained and they were grieved because of the children of Israel that very word grieve means to a bore through the idea of suffering oneself they were so grief so the word this propaganda all of these things that had been sown within there had literally been able to turn the countenance of the Egyptians toward the Israelites listen friends that same thing has been going on it's been going on for a long time and that same thing is still going on right now we're seeing things being spoken more vividly more clear and everything else when it comes to the very term of Christians let alone when it gets down to real message believers they already have a problem with different ones and how they stand on marriage and how they stand on different things but let alone when it comes down to a message that goes down and homes it right more clearly into the scriptures but God knows just exactly the right time everything in itself is setting the words themselves all the meaning look at this friends even in this hour that we're living in this time after the internet and everything has come forth it used to be a time you know when for myself when we lived down in the country out there from Lyman was more closer to the Indiana border there are things that you would see that certain styles maybe of sneakers and things like that that would be right here in this and I would go right back down there in that country school and I would not see those styles whatsoever there was a limitation but now with the internet it's no longer just a town township city it's a global village and imagery and all things are projected right through their words you can have things that you would look at in times past you must be in this city or be in this city and hold this city has more of a conservative stance or this city has more of a liberal listen the words themselves are turning and they are slowly and surely they have been turning the countenance of the world against the bride but how wonderful that mate that means it's just that much more closer to us come on home amen the Bible was on to talk about how they were making their life rigueur they made it hard with bondage but you notice of how that when Rama seized was his countenance and there was a change of countenance and it was actually turning the countenance of the people that were there in Egypt God was getting ready to turn the countenance of Moses Moses had a countenance that was a countenance that I don't care what's going on down there I've tried I failed today it's not working but God was getting ready to change Moses caplets and through that change of countenance where God would reveal himself to Moses in the promise of his word then that weren't coming forth rat down in there in Egypt would bring a change into the countenance of the people they were groaning and sighing under that under this great burden they had come to that place but when they're leaving out of there you do not read that they were groaning inside but what you read is they were going and borrowing Jews and treasures and all of those things and they were not just being asked to leave they were being told to leave something that they desired Egypt had finally come to a place to say get out of here we don't want to hear no more that's exactly the where the world has come to right now the world is screaming out get out of here we don't want you here no more and the earth is sad sons of God yes get out of here so you can come back and I can receive my final transformation ah ha so words themselves are very powerful they can bring a change of countenance both good and evil mama notice how Paul deals with this here in Galatians 4:12 there has been some brother and that have come among the church and they have come among there but they have not come to edify or to encourage the people but they have come now listen they're not coming with stray words but they're coming with the lack of understanding and that lack of understanding is actually going to cause the people to come into a place within themselves of dissension toward the very one that they need to remain united with I'm talking about United in that revelation now notice this in Galatians 4 verse 12 brethren I beseech you be as I am for I am as ye are you have not injured me at all now you know oppose already been dealing with them on how that they've you've taken the law that they'll all make you perfect there was it the law how doubt were the miracles done where the miracles done by the law Paul is asking them questions you know what questions do cause you to think he's asking them questions how did these things how is the change come about in your life how are you transformed what was this and now Paul is letting it be known hey be as I am for I am as you are see they don't see the condition that they're in the world not only has affected their countenance towards Paul but their word has altered the way that they see themselves what's it not words that that were brought forth there were words that were brought forth but it was words without understanding notice in verse 13 he know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus Paul is Lenny you changed you've changed towards me what's changed you towards me come on friends the Prophet tells us in a message he that is in you he said as a man I make many mistakes he said you'll see you see my mistakes he said but don't you ever lose confidence repeater God don't you ever lose confidence so here within it notice where is them the blessedness you speak of for I bear you record that if it had been possible you would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth so there's a situation and the word is discerning the situation because I tell you the truth things are changed its changed towards Paul but notice what's happening friends listen the word itself moving here right through Paul's a ministry we'll be able to do what it will be able to turn the elect of God and remove that gloom that's about the life aren't you glad about that that there's all there's many times there's gloom there's things that can get about your life but the Word of God can cause that gloom to go away they's Elias Lee look at this in verse 17 they seriously affect you but not well yea they would exclude you that you might affect them but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing and not only when I'm present what Paul is saying I'm not the only one who can affect you seriously in a good thing but the word that has been delivered that revelation as it's brought forth whether it be through Timothy or Titus or the different ones that Paul would mention and count them as fellow laborers that that Revelation itself could seriously affect the people of God the word can change the countenance now once you think of this of how that the Prophet would you know he admonishes this is a very familiar passage here within the message but it is an admonition concerning our lives and how that things can can move right in that can work to change the countenance program says love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one big sweet group now but remember my warning Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and calls him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then you'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it so what is it that would cause an individual to move in that manner words words and a word can change a countenance it can absolutely cause and altering to that countenance notice the admonition don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else now remember what he said before no matter what the devil tries to say yeah there you can wreak and look and say well this could be true and that can be true but how do I know if it's true how do I know that the devil is trying to say look at what the motive and the intention is and look at that and it brings a discernment to what's behind it amen listen friends there's a discernment of spirit the word can bring a discernment of spirit and heat and it still can come with such a real love of God don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be safe too or that woman or whoever it is just pray for him and stick one with another so even though the poison would be spread it's also on us to have the right attitude what a challenge well this must be dropping down home I know it is because he turned me he turned me right here the other day when I'm studying and looking at some things and dropped it right in my heart concerning this notice in proverbs 25 23 the north wind drive us away rain so does an angry countenance a backbiting time Wow an angry countenance Jesus walked into the temple right his eyes were full of anger but yet he fulfilled the scripture being angry and sinning not is that right because everything was aligned just right with how it needed to be alive you know friends the quickest way when someone begins to talk and say you know what I think about this in here first of all there are things that simply do not need to be discussed among us they don't need to be things discussed about what I think this brother I think this sister we don't have a thought coming are you with me this is not things that if it's not Paul is very clear within those things it ought to be things that are edifying and if there are things that go to become a backbiting tongue the first thing that we would have to do is that of an angry countless not something or we gotta look at me you know dead in the eye you might have to do that or you can just simply stand there and say I don't want to hear any more of that well it's the gospel no you mean it's the gossip I don't want to hear no more of it I don't want to hear your thoughts on it yet your thoughts might be as far as your words be true but I know that spirits can get behind words whew notice iron sharpens iron so a man sharpen a--the the countenance of his friend Wow how do you want your countenance sharpened do you want your accountant that sharpened to where that your countenance becomes abrasive to everybody else cutting toward everybody else hang around critical people and you'll become critical all right you can't lay around with a dog and expect enough to get fleas you stick around with critical spirits they come with you listen friends when they're there at the workplace they can run the boss down run this down and run back down those very spirits will come right home with you and you'll pick at this pick at that pick at this glory be to God sharpen if the countenance of his friends that's my desire Lord help me help me through the ministering of the word that I can sharpen the countless help me that within my home I can sharpen the countless help me Lord God among my friends my brother's fellow co-workers that I can sharpen the countenance and my countenance can be sharpened but I only wanted sharpen to reflect him the Prophet says stay with your pastor he's the shepherd you give him respect he'll lead you through cause he's ordained of God to do something now watch he says the enemy will come and when he does just clean that much closer together it doesn't take much to understand that there would be things that would actually calls it possibly to be hard to clean there's a time to be clingy and there's a time not to be cleanly there's a right way to be clingy and there's a wrong way to be cleaning the Prophet goes into that here in this quote he says when he does just clean that much closer together the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't never plan among or talk or make yourself clannish Wow and yet the Prophet tells us in one place of the message that we ought to be clannish clannish in what way that we are assembled unto Christ in him alone but we are not to be clannish in our spirit clannish in our heart clannish in our countenance I would imagine I'm speaking to other people here that when you went to school perhaps you didn't fit in with all of the different sections either maybe you were outcast as well and there were things you were looked down upon and left then and whatever more it doesn't make you feel good now you can sit there and say brother Samuel did all that stuff that bad that don't bother me you're lying it does bother you it affects you listen friends the very thing within itself to brother branham himself the things that he endured from a young boy and a young man there are things that he still had to endure with mother think of it to even be able to hold a balance to where now you got people that are wanting to embrace him and wanting him to come but now he's got a hold of balance and not go over my it's really something how the enemy can try to work and put scars and then try to send those things in the opposite way oh my he says notice in there in 86 there he says if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness springing up cause it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my fake to just have a thought to have a thought of it that the poison assets he said that that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you realize friends that jealousy itself can rise so simple about one person looking at another person being rejoicing are being happy or being joyful and that jealousy can rise right up but it can move it in such a manner to say well they don't have no problems like me they don't have how do you know that maybe they don't allow their mood to be their barometer listen friends we all get down every one of us myself included there are times it is a sacrifice of praise and then there's other times it's an ease to praise there's other times I've got a press feel my feelings be only everything times I have to press to study it isn't that there is an inspiration but as soon as I move beyond that press and enter right in there the inspiration itself begins to move down and God begins to deal and move right through my heart but it isn't always easy it isn't always something that it's a I want or an I fear the enemy is always around to try to beset us in our feelings and in our thoughts but remember those things are poisoned acids you understand what bursitis tendinitis and a lot of those itis azar it's where things get going where they have your uric acid and a lot of things can move within people's bodies and can actually cause pain and discomfort and things to where they can't walk or move like they ought to move what is it it's things that set in their body until your sake would love nothing more than the set poison acid in the life to where he would run the Spirit of God away from your life and run it away from this place he would love nothing more than that so where does it all begin this is simple right here with our thinking when you think discern where that fault is coming from just because a thought comes in our mind does not mean it comes from the Lord come on somebody just because you're reading the Word of God and a thought hit you does not mean that that thought came from God are you with me so if this is true on the negative and we've looked at this part on the negative then what about the positive side let me just read a few of these in numbers chapter 6 verse 22 here Aaron and the priest are this is given for the priest that would continue on the high priest and those priests that would continue on this was something that God just did not want to be something that was just stated and well this is said or this is thought upon but God wanted to make sure that the people themselves the blessing was pronounced upon him and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto Aaron and unto his son saying on this wise you shall bless the children of Israel saying unto them the Lord bless thee and keep thee the Lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto them I got to looking at these things here notice the Lord's the Lord make his face to become light upon thee and be gracious unto thee his face is his countenance his person the Lord lift up or exalt his person upon thee and give thee peace it's salt is person upon your life and give you peace that's the only thing that can give us peace real true joy is when we're in the presence of God the Prophet tells us an unrecognised presence of God he said the real true joy that I have this when I can pray till I know that I'm in his presence I'll tell you that's when that's when things dissipate that's when things flee away friends this is the greatest time thing within our life is prayer listen we can listen to much we can read too much but you can't pray too much I believe with all my heart there's a lot less praying goes on there's more listening and there's more reading than there is praying but praying unlocks and reveals what you're reading praying reveals what you're listening to listen various never been when the Prophet tells us there he said the key to the messages that God gives me is through prayer I tell you right now there are times through prayer where the sermon itself everything will drop right out I don't have enough paper my phone my iPad to be writing everything down has this drop it doesn't happen that way every time no but many of the times I'll take things but God made the inspiration is struck and I'll begin to pray before the Lord like I was the other morning when this dropped into my heart and I was praying and all the sudden the Spirit of God began to move down and begin to say deal with this part on countenances deal with these things and the inspiration of God began to flow I tell your friends prayer is important in many times I'm not even praying on what I'm going to preach as far as when something will come sometimes it's when I'm praying for needs that are right here in the midst of praying for those needs and the inspiration will drop I'm saying that because not that the inspiration is going to drop for you to preach a message unless you're called you've got a gift in your life but I am saying this that prayer itself as the Prophet would call it a radar prayer itself unlocks things how does prayer in Locke because prayer is us submitting ourselves unto the Lord and they shall put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them David said in Psalms 4:6 let me just read these and leave you with some of these scriptures I'm going to read there be many that say who will show us any good you ever notice how David in the Psalms when he's riding but David's able to hear things sometimes that are being said against him you notice that over and over David doesn't say well I had my bow earphones on noise cancellation there's some times where we have to listen there's a difference between listening and hearing David could hear it but he refused to listen to it there's a lot of things that the enemy can say was you got to make a decision to say I refuse to listen to it you're not here but refuse to listen to it but when God speaking we want to listen there Ben who will show us any good Lord look what David's response is Lord lift up down Vala the light of back countenance now let's put gladness in my heart more than in the time that there corn in there one increased glory be to cotton let me go on Psalms 21 6 or thou has made him most blessed for ever speaking of David speaking of himself as a king Dallas made him exceeding glad with thy countenance David's countenance is affected by the Lord now think of all these things that David himself experienced but yet David's experience of the Lord and it cannot be held in the same comparison to abide the grace of God that what we have come in contact with Finn's Calvary and the resurrection because what David would speak of David was speaking of even in that time of how that the word was affecting his life how that the presence of God was affecting his life but to think how that when Peter is quoting in the book of axises this is right in the time there of where the holy spirit to fall upon upon the Church of the Living God and look at the word that how that the Spirit of God would have Peter to quote this in verse 28 thou has made known me the paths of life this readout psalm 16 now shall make me full of joy with thy countenance I will have joy not just temporal but everlasting joy with what that person what is his person his life the Holy Spirit they meant that I shall fullness of joy now do you feel like where you're on top of a mountain all the time anybody feel like that all the time no but there's still joy in your heart because the circumstances of this world though they can get bleak and darken - all sorts of things can come around but the joy remains the same that I know that I am his and he is mine proverbs 16 15 in the light of the Kings countenance his life and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain bless it Psalms 89 15 blessed is the people that know the joyful sound they shall walk o Lord in the light of that countenance I don't have time to read in Psalms 42 you can read it when you get home or maybe in the morning or something but David speaks concerning once again things where his soul was cast down David speaks where things are gathered around me troubles he's asking God and he's talking he's talking to his soul so why are you cast down why are you cast down but notice all David will move within it talent comes back David begins to talk about in this verse what wonderful counsel he begins to go into where he begins to remember things you know friends it's reporting it's important to remember that all of the great things that God has done in your life I think of how the Prophet talks about here he is brother brems says sometimes when I get done when I get down I go set in my den and I look at the trophies that he has given me and I remember remember the hunts so God allows memory the gate of memory to be used don't remember the tools the enemy would like to stir up that gate of memory as well but you have been equipped by God Nehemiah has spoken and said put there link that the bars the lots and everything on the gate you control those gates there right so here David he comes back around I'll remember and then David you know he says in Psalms 42 5 he says how you know it says hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance aren't you glad he just don't send a word but he is his word and that word comes to our hearts to do what lift us up change us if we receive that word it can totally change our countenance yes sir I've witnessed that I've witnessed countenances be changed in services I've witnessed it for the positive and have witnessed it for the negative not just here but other places that I've ministered you can witness countless but it depends on how the word itself is received there right there's something you don't agree with you know like brother Ram says that you don't agree with that then just he says you know just a lot of to my ignorant and throw it out but he said be careful that you're not throwing out see seeds because you know what seeds are their new beginning they pack within them the germ of life could it be to God if David goes on he says says it once again in verse 11 he said for I shall yet praise Him who is the health of my countenance and my god I will praise him because he is the health the salvation the deliverance the prosperity of my countenance that's what that's what our testimony is to be that the Lord is the one that I want and the only one to affect my countenance God's not asking us to put on a show he's uh nasca neuss to pretend David is not pretending here but David is taking the circumstances that surround him and he says but yet I will praise Him who is the help and the health of my countenance aren't you glad God corrects us he corrects us because sometimes our countenance needs changed so it's his word he'll come and he'll bring correction to our life they're right you know sometimes you know when you you see another thing sometimes watching it's cool I've watched it even you know with our own children and things like that sometimes they you get around and you think you talking back to me they don't go in this house that don't work here in this house we don't conduct things that way we don't conduct things enough you know then we don't work that way y'all won't do that y'all don't have things like that at all maybe I'm the only one Lord that's what Paul was doing in the Galatian Church their countenance was not the same so the word came to bring correction that's what Paul did in the Corinthian church when there was sin that they were permitting to dwell among them correction had to come and change their countenance they were puffed up are you correction notice Omaha in Psalms 98 thou has set our iniquities before thee our secret sins are in the light of that countenance some of these I've loved to read the whole passage but I think it gets to the point secret sins in the light of thy countenance are you glad for the light of his countenance are you glad his light moves upon you even when it shows out things that might just be a little bit of leaven that a little bit of leaven leaveneth the whole it changes the whole countenance sorrow Ecclesiastes 7 3 sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better now some of you feel like you've got a scripture now that you said praise the Lord I'm manifest sadness all the time that's not what the scripture is talking about that's the truth some folks face they've been happy in a long time but listen to this what the right the writer is speaking of is that we're like the condition of this age where everything is mirth nothing against laughter but these very things is against and it's taken away and ignoring what the real purpose that were here on earth for and when that sorrow when that comes to the heart the lord I need you then that sadness of the countenance itself that brokenness it makes the heart better so sometimes the countenance has to be broken in order for it to be built up the same I thought we are leaving I'm getting back to him just hold on now look at this and slobbers 15:13 a merry heart make up a cheerful countenance now these two scriptures have seemed to contradict they don't write mu-1 write beautifully fitting with another I'm Mary hot maketh a cheerful countenance but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken you either said it one or the other and sometimes you said it one and then God comes back around and lifts you back over here is that right yeah you can get because the enemy can pile up bring up everything before you and if you entertain that in your spirit your countenance becomes cast down I'm Mary Hart what's a Mary Hart huh how does the Prophet deal with this with Mary and he says we ought to be the happiest people in the world because why our destiny sure if God Himself how he's drawn us to himself done the work of the kinsman and performed that duty in our life and we have been sealed by his presence we are to delight ourselves in that the happiest people in the world I think God was interested in that you believe that where the Prophet would continue to be moved by the unction of the Holy Spirit throughout the message in dealing with this very point I was reading here the other day brother Branham it just really struck me brother brand was talking all things he gets to thinking on the Brent said when I get to thinking on that scripture there's one among you oh he says I just get carried away as John said there's one among you he said I think he's the Blessed Messiah that's among us he's the blessed one that is performing the sign of the Messiah he's identified himself in our midst now here's Jacob and let's let's go let's come down here Jacob notices the change of the countenance towards him words of change the countenance of labor but Jacob even though he's still Jacob Israel has not been raised up but yet Jacob does have a testimony that in the midst of it he could say in Genesis 31 6 when he spoke to Rachel and Leah you know that with all my power I have served your father see Jacob now look Jacob could have taken Jacob could have went the other way but watch how this is moving in this time Laban scantiness has changed toward Jacob but Jacob recognizes God speaks to him it's time to return home it's time to get back into position now his wives could have told him and said no you're not you haven't you haven't been right towards our daddy but they knew his testimony his countenance had truly been right towards Laban so I believe that this is what the job to be in the desire of a heart Lord I want my countenance to be right towards you and if my countenance is right towards you it'll be right toward each and every one of my brothers and sisters I will not make one serve with rigor where they have to run me down and do this and do that but we're willingly how I want to be a brother to the brothers I want to be a brother to the sister to be a real pastor to be a a real minister of God to be a real servant to be a real husband to be a real daddy are you with me - let the countenance itself let that be the test among the countless because remember man can look on the outer countenance that God looketh and the Bible says God behold if the countenance within and I want you to look at this here in Song of Solomon chapter 2 verse 14 I love this scripture o my dove dowered in the clefts of the rock in the secret places of the stairs you know what he calls you you know and he calls me my dove and doves are mates he the great dove has brought forth from our life that of the Dove and so he's looking at us he says o my dove one who is undefiled one who's blameless without fault come on before him in love bow out in the class of the rock or my hidden place in the secret places of the stairs having access into my presence let me see that countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and I countenance it sky this is what he thinks of us just as much as Jacob was able to discern labels change of countenance toward him and it drove Jacob away so is the Lord she's seeing the reflection of his own life and countenance in his bride it's not driving him away it's bringing him to us to do what lift us in rapture a change of countenance is important the word letting the word have free course in our life this is our desire it changed this countenance on mal Transfiguration the same word to think of it in this hour it changed the countenance as we looked at it here just moments ago it changed the word that came and it changed Hitler's countenance Amen the entire message releases the Holy Ghost among the Church of the Living God what is it to change the countenance of the people of Almighty God for what so where he can say no we can't be a part no longer you're coming home with me today this is rapture day this is the moment that I have longed for Oh God granted more Jesus friend in every little thing and our life don't let in anything at all don't let one little grain of sand don't let anything at all if there's anything within your heart that would not be right just say Lord God Lord Jesus and not just in purchasing that but Lord helped me shape me mold me prepare me Lord help me Lord God to be guarded against those things let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus you are so mindful Lord of every need Lord God in our lives Lord undoubtedly Lord Jesus as we stand here Lord and we've looked into your word Lord sometimes we wonder why Lord maybe our countenance Lord is changed there sometimes the Lord God where our countenance within itself Lord that may be Lord God within marriages and between homes the Lord God and things Lord can be changed may be Lord countenance even between Lord God brothers Lord and sisters Lord but father I pray Lord God it may your presence or Jesus moving Lord God among us tonight Lord or to bring healing Lord in our lives in ordinary or to see the seriousness of this Lord God help us Lord I believe God that it's so important in our lives the Lord but their Lord Jesus is truly ministering Lord God that rightfully divides the word of truth I believe that Lord with all my heart there are things Lord Jesus that we Lord sometimes Lord can see where things Lord God have been misconstrued father help us Lord help us Lord in all things to have the right attitude lord help us Lord that in our eyes we keep our eyes Lord folk focus Lord and centered on you lord help us lord god I pray father in our spirits Lord in our hearts Lord God what sometimes with words Lord God that can be carried Lord for years and all of a sudden Lord God a wife or a husband Lord with someone Lord can be setting Lord right in the congregation and something Lord God that father they never let go of Lord something Lord that perhaps saw God that another person Lord God that Lord it may be offender the Lord Jesus and it's been made right the Lord God they can't let it go I pray Lord that you help the Lord help him to see Lord garment in the moment like this that it's one of the great acts of redemption is to be able to forgive Lord to be able to move Lord God and reconcile Lord to lay aside ideas and thinking lord help us the Lord we're tempted were tested Lord God right here Lord sitting around in the Assembly Lord God every one of us Lord God maybe some of us Lord in our makeup is more closely Lord aligned than others but Lord God we're still as different as different he can be Lord but father there's one thing Lord God that we have more God common Lord and in a hearts Lord and that's you Lloyd may we Lord God cherish that Lord because if we cherish that Lord God and we Lord cherish your presence Lord in our life then you will give us the grace to be able to overlook the shortcomings the mistakes Lord and all those things lord god that's so readily Lord can stand out among us Lord because we know that within our own lives or do we need your grace day by day moment by moment Lord help us Lord a prayer what god I pray the Lord that you see in my life and the lives Lord God of

he's the health of my countenance what I'm reminded of a scripture you dwell in the praises of your people didn't say that you dwell and how loud that we would sing or how loud that we would shout we're not even in our hearts Lord God there are times Lord Jesus that maybe even sitting in a doctor's office and something can come our way the Lord God for my heart's comes forth the praise it says
