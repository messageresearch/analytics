that's where we look - Lord you have everything in control amen and we're so thankful for that we just want to look into the word here just for a few moments tonight and if you would turn with me to Psalms chapter 34 it's okay don't look for him I didn't send any to you in Psalms chapter 34 and then I thought perhaps that I'll speak for a few for a little bit and then we have a testimony and maybe some songs and we'll just approach the service that way tonight just have a thought on the heart that some months ago and looking at this whole journey of the children of Israel just another part of it and I want to look here in Psalms 34 verse 1 I want to say I so appreciate your prayers while we were gone we were there in the youth retreat and the just just some wonderful wonderful services the Lord had given to us and many many hearts were touched in many different ways and we've just been getting just getting different reports back as well there's a lot of things that you could see a lot of things that the Lord was doing right then and there but we just continued to get reports back from that and they're not just last last night I just got back here today from brother Jeff Snodgrass we were down there with them last night to speak for them as well so I had already planned on going down there but I hadn't planned on winter youth retreat so there's kind of added to everything what we've had so we had a good service down there last night and many hearts were touched so I just want to say I appreciate your prayers and certainly is good to be back here and I'm interested I'm anxious to get back into my schedule very anxious for that so let's look in Psalms 34 verse 1 a psalm of David when he changed his behavior before a Benwick who drove him away and he departed David said I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad notice who will hear it the humble Oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles the angel of the Lord in Campa throned about them that fear him and deliver them Oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him and all fear the Lord he is Saints for there is no want to them that fear him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing let's just bow our heads in order prayer tonight Heavenly Father Lord as we just come before you this evening we're just so thankful dear God for your grace and mercy Lord once again we find ourselves the Lord here Lord in the beginning and opening of another year and Lord were just so thankful Lord for your grace and mercy that Lord has brought us through the previous year we thank you Father for Lord all the tests and trials Lord and the grace that you've given Lord for us to be able to come through them father Lord for even Lord and tests that we failed we thank you for grace Lord that you would give us the strength Lord God and father Lord to take him again Lord we just thank you so much Lord God so many needs and so much that we can reflect and recount upon Lord in the previous year and father we would Lord be mindful Lord to ask that you would forgive us Lord of our sins and our shortcomings Lord Father our mistakes Lord gone and failures Lord from the previous year Lord as we look to You Father Lord in this year or god that father that our hearts might draw closer to you Lord father is Lord with great anticipation Lord God we know that Lord we are one year one month Lord a day Lord gone an hour were closer Lord God Father Lord in your coming Lord God than we were Lord before and Lord God were just looking to you father and we pray that you would help us Lord to ever remain fervent Lord God and looking Lord God unto you father the Lord Jesus we love you tonight we pray that you'll just take your word and speak to our hearts Lord in a special way in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God blesses your being seated I want to just just take that thought if we could hear in a thought here just on on that of more than enough more than enough I look here in the in the scriptures and there's some scriptures we're going to be referring to here throughout but there's parts here that where it speaks in the text that we read in Psalms 34 verse 9 Oh fear the Lord he is Saints for there is no want to them that fear him you know there's nothing that you we can look at this we have needs but there is no lack but anything that he himself is not already provided and what we have need of versed in goes on to say that the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing you know it would be one thing if the Scriptures said there that the old lions but you know when you look many times the older Lions they get to a place that they can no longer hunt they can no longer do the things that they normally could do they don't have the strength don't have the stamina they don't have the ability you know to take down the prey but here David puts it in a place that you and I would look at that it would seem very advantageous and he says that the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing I'll tell you what it what a promise that we have within the Lord to think and to realize that God he is mindful of every situation and all that we would have need of in our life and all that we come across in life's journey God has already taken all of this in into his is ilysm view and and provided for us what we have need of you know situations themselves you know when we we look at it when a need would arise and things within our life you know sometimes we look for things that can come externally but yet in reality what God he's already provided for us what's needed in order to bring to past what it is that we're looking for and we have a need whether it's for healing in our body whether it it's some you know sort of a financial need whatever it is we realize that God is mindful and he knows all things and he knows just what we have need of I know that's a very simple very simple part but I believe that we can look at that and really take strength from that here tonight I want to turn in the scriptures to 2nd Kings chapter 4 as well and I'd like to look here in this portion of the word and here we find that Elijah as coming in into a place where there is a need that has a rose and I want you to notice here in second Kings chapter 4 verse 1 it says there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord and the creditor has come to take unto him my two sons to be bondman you see there was a testimony he feared the Lord verse 2 and Elisha said to her what shall I do for thee tell me what has thou in thy house and she said that handmaid hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil then he said go borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbours even empty vessels borrow not a few and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shall pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full now I want you to notice in these in the scriptures that were given here there is a need that is presented here to Elisha and Elijah responds to the to the widow was what one is it that you would ask of me you see when we look at just this principle as the children of God we are not beggars we're not even to approach the throne of God in a beggarly way the Scriptures never ever present that to us in any way as a matter of fact that would be a disrespect to our Heavenly Father but rather over and over in the scriptures we are admonished to ask where the more admonish to ask in faith the Lord Jesus would say when he was here upon earth walking in a corporal body ask the Father anything in my name and I will do it there was and there is nothing that is beyond God's doing now you and I you know I don't know about you but there's many times I when I come in contact with different people that even those that I worked with and you know sometimes they would have you know a little snide remarks of things that they would make and it the really the reality of it is is that they just didn't know the Lord they didn't know the way that they knew the Lord is a manner that is not a good proverb at all but the RAM calls it a God dishonouring proverb when people say that God only helps them who helps themselves brother Ram called that a God dishonouring proverb because that doesn't that that is not he says god helps those who cannot help themselves and that's the greatest thing that we can recognize is that in everything we need his help it doesn't matter even when we look at even the skills and whatever that we have in our life those skills that we have there is not things that we've accumulated it's things that God already knew would would they would rested there he placed in our lives schooling and other things can refine it but yet it's things that we know that it is entrusted to God and how many times you know I can I can recall where there would be things that would be mentioned maybe you know in a faculty meeting some little snide comment you know when I would mention maybe of how that God you know it and help me in certain things and you know help me within you know the testing and how to know to approach this and you know you'd get this and say well what God can't do it for you and you know you come right back and I look at and I thought well I told the person I said well I never said that he came down and did it I said I just happened to be the tool that he used I said what I'm saying is I said it's just he helped me I said in my littleness I said to catch what I needed to catch I said because I seen there was a need I said in yet I looked at it I didn't know how to make those ins me I said but I was asking for his help I said and he came down I said and he helped me I said that's all I'm testifying to is that he helped me I was in need you know many of the things we look at things and sometimes we we look at things in areas of our life and we can look at areas of life as though that this is a is a self-sufficient sustaining area that I do not need God's oversight but the reality is in every area of our life we do need his oversight we need his leadership we need his direction in every area of our life and I I believe that with all my heart that there is something within our hearts as believers that repels pride that it's something about it that as we mature in the Lord it's something that we can quickly begin to recognize that pride that would hang around from that first birth and you know as we're always trying to shed that thing even after we've been born again of the Spirit of God God even gave Paul divine assistance because Les Paul would rise in Pride and God you know was mindful of that and I'm glad he's mindful of that for you and I when there's things that God he brings us to in our life that there is no other place for us to go we can talk with somebody but the reality is it's we need help from the Lord we need his guidance we need his direction for our lives and here stands this Widow woman there's a testimony in this household of how her husband has stood and now there's a need that's arose the creditor has come to take you know Sons in possession and she looks around her house and she doesn't see anything that would be a value that would be a value in a sense that would take care of the debt there's something you know this one thing that you could look at things that you could pawn off and say this will take care of a debt this would satisfy a debt this would take care of that you can look for that but she was looking in her house and she knew I don't have anything that I can pawn off that will actually satisfy the debt but you see what she did what she didn't realize is that she really had a gold mine there and when it came there was a need in her life that then she could ask and say what when Elijah said what am I to do for thee and then Elijah directs her in simplicity to what is already in her possession you this was not something she went out to buy he never told her go out and buy oil but she already had it in her possession and what she had in her possession is really all it had to be is her faith released in the word that would take what was in her possession and would multiply it and meet the need and the challenge of the hour so the need arose and you know sometimes when needs arise she would have never seen this pot of oil and the real value and what it was unless a need would arose in our life I tell you it's one thing for you and I to know God's grace and how that it touches our life in the beginning but to think about it that where we stand right now in this hour it is God's grace that you and I are standing here today it's not our works it's not anything that we a good have done if anything that we've received any direction any correction any edification it is because of the grace of Almighty God not what we have deserved but God's grace and to look at this woman here she is she she then she doesn't argue she just simply says I'll go and do it and notice the Bible says that when she went from him the Bible says she shut the door in verse 5 upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out I want you to think of this there had to be something here that within this home to where when she you know the effect and testimony in this home was such a way to where that when this this little woman could go and she could tell her sons or her children say go and get many vessels met within them the scripture never records that they looked at mama and said mama what are we gonna do with vessels what is it gonna be about vessels but I believe there was a testimony that she brought before Elijah where they were serving the Lord and when it came time for a situation that arose they didn't know how the answer was going to come all they knew is just go do what the word has told you to do right now because if we can go and do what God has asked us to do then it's what God comes on the scene to fulfill and bring forth what we cannot do there's one thing that they could do they could gather the vessels and I want you to notice there was never a number fixed on this they never had men ever does never a question how many vessels but it was fully directed don't gather a few but you go get there every vessel and make sure their empty vessels and when you get them you bring him inside your house you you know there's certain things that God only wants you to know about sometimes there's things that God does for us personally he don't want to share it with nobody else but you see what he does in private the Bible says in Matthew 6:6 that the Lord that heareth and cieth in private will reward thee openly you see God knows exactly what he's doing and how that this little woman she moves brings in these vessels here her sons are bringing these vessels together and the Bible says that she began to pour into those vessels in verse 6 and when the vessels were full she said to her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there's not a vessel more and the oil stayed so the miracle itself was not about the vessels but the vessels were containing a miracle because it was the oil that was the miracle because there was just a pot of oil but there were many vessels that were gathered with the purpose for the oil to fill up vessels you see this is just exactly here we see the time of the Lord Jesus Christ that he is the true living vessel you know he is that crus of salt that in lies ahead he is that vessel that out of him that was poured out that life after he ascended to the me tutorial see he poured out his life into empty vessels that were gathered there in the upper room and then Peter under the unction the Holy Spirit he himself stands there that day and says that this is unto your children and to them that's afar off and as many as the Lord our God shall call you know what he was saying gather many vessels how many vessels don't gather a few gather many vessels you see it was not a limit on it it's God knows and God there was a number of vessels but God knew that number and how would be brought together in this hour that these vessels would be full and yet after being full the oil still stayed I tell you what a testimony of God's own life of the Holy Spirit it's still the same it's still all sufficient power it's still more than enough it's still the same God in this hour as he was there in the very beginning he still he's still pouring out of his spirit in vessels that will present themselves empty Omaha to think of this the oil itself it's stayed now watch watch this here the Bible says in verse 7 that when she came and she told the man of God now she's done what what was what was expected or what was spoken to her and she told the man of God you see sometimes when we look at this here you'll find things that where God will open things to us and then we walk in obedience and then God will open more as we're walking we walk a little bit then God opens a more you know God doesn't lay out the whole whole program to us but God unveils these things just as we have need oven to think of it she goes on he says to her go sell the oil and pay that debt and live thou and that children of the rest now think of this what she already had in her possession was more than enough are you with me she had more than enough there was vessels they gathered vessels and yet after filling up all these vessels the oil still stayed there was more than enough it wasn't just enough it was more than enough because she not only had enough to be able to sell and pay the debt think of this if he would have told her in the beginning this time you're gonna get out of this you're gonna get out of it by the oil but she would have never seen it that way but you see if she kept on walking faith is building as she's obedient to the word faith is being built and she comes into this place she sells the oil and pays off the debt and then the rest of the oil what's left live off of that I'm grateful that how bet the token of the Holy Spirit that great oil of God it is a signification that we were identified in the purchase price of Calvary and it is an identification that we were included there and that the sin question in our life has been settled you know brother Baron said it like this he said in a message all things he said you know it Calvary was not a wholesale affair to the believer it's not a wholesale affair but it is something that is personal were you and I can look at and say for my iniquities it was for my he bought for my healing it was for my sins it was for my transgression you see it's personal and we recognize that that even that oil she lived of that oil the rest of the days I tell you there was never a want in that house when there was a need that was there they lived of that oil I tell you the truth tonight in real reality for us we're not living by anything else other than by the oil of Almighty God it's God that's given us strength day in and day out my brother and sister he might be you that can sit down and we can open the lids of the Bible but we cannot give ourselves strength we can listen to the message of the hour but we cannot give ourselves strength it takes Almighty God to feel you and I it takes him to give strength and nourishment oz and minister to the needs it don't matter what comes up the oil has stayed she already had what she needed she already had it she had what was needed to pay off the debt a need arose but what it is is now she comes to that place and that realization and God makes it real it's more than enough now look at this here in the scripture just a few places in the scripture to think of how that God would place it here even when manna would rain down on the ground and I'm just going to just refer to this very briefly even when God would rain down manna for the children of Israel to eat thereof you know there was not just enough there was more than enough there was more than enough the Bible says every man was together according to his eating very much somebody that gathered a lot and other someone else together much less they weren't running and racing and like trying to get the last piece of pizza I know that's simple but we get the point or the last pork chop or whatever on the plate there was more than enough there wasn't racing around to get it it was covering the ground and you know a man is the type of manna is a type of the oil of God of the Holy Spirit there was plenty of manna that have fallen and there was there was more than enough as a matter of fact the Bible tell them don't even hang on to what you've picked up until the next morning but when you have finished eating burn that and put that away so there was more than enough when God would supply not just enough but there was more than enough I think of this here in the book you know in the book of Exodus chapter 12 when it speaks here concerning Israel when the Israel was coming out of the land here and as they were journeying you know Moses had told them under the direction of the Lord in Exodus 12 35 he told the children of Israel how they were to borrow of the Egyptians jewels of silver jewels of gold and raiment you see God knew what was needed there the Bible now wants you to catch this the Bible the word says borrow and it means ask you see it and when God wanted it to be released to them you see in reality the Egyptians were holding it but it really belonged to the Lord because the Bible says the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof they were holding it come on now it's just like the earth is right now but the precious metals in gold and everyone I've met it can be helped but you know what when when we you and I when we come back here upon this earth in the Millennium here and then in the future home here to see everything itself it belongs to the Lord and so here they ask and they borrow now when you know to think about it they're walking out of here and the Bible says in verse 36 that the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians who gave them favor God did who was it that they didn't have to fight for this they just had to say oh we need raiment we need silver we need gold think of this now these were people who had been in mud pits these were people who had been they they were known these are slaves and they're talking to the Egyptians give us the silver give us of gold give us of raiment you see it was already it was God who gave them favor in order to receive these things God knew they would have need of it is that right so the Bible says so they lent unto them such things as they required and they spoiled the Egyptians you know one thing that we find here that even within among the Israel they didn't know what all this meant they didn't know that there was a vision that was going to break forth and that there was going to be these different things that would be required the tabernacle of God was going to come forth there they didn't know that they did not know the things that they were going to encounter in the journey but all they knew is is go ahead and ask for these things because it's going to be needed you see God Himself splitting such a principle before you and I seek you first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these other things will be added unto us God already knew what they was going to have need of he already knew they didn't know but all they did was do what was told them to do oma in that a blessing that's a blessing just to be simple enough not to ask God to come down and explain it because he won't but it's just blessing to say Lord I take you at your word they didn't ask questions why do you want us to go do this why do you want us to ask of them they did not ask that but maybe they took that this is the word of the Lord not Moses suggestion this is the word of the Lord then to think of this the riches of the Egyptians here placed in their hand you know the Bible says it like this in Exodus 36 when they're taking an offering after after Israel has come back in line with God after the molten calf and and things and here they are walking with the Lord and it begins to break the vision now and things begin to transpire and the men whom God has skilled to bring forth that vision there that God has given Moses the Bible says that how that the people were to bring offerings there unto the tabernacle every morning is that right not to think of this the people themselves were slaves how could they bring an offering but you see what they were doing they were presenting what God had given to them and what God gave to them he entrusted to them that they in turn are recognizing his presence there and they entrust it back to the Lord and God turns around and God blesses them you know when you look at it for our lives when God would lay the principle in our life it's him that provides for you and I and then we turn around and honor him and presenting to him our tithes and offerings and he turns around and blesses us for honoring him and recognizing the Lord I would have nothing if it wasn't for you oh my and to think of that are we worthy we're not worthy of it because it's been him that has provided all things for us then to see the Bible goes on to say in Exodus 36 as they continued to bring every morning they eventually the men rose up and they told him in verse 5 they told Moses the people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the LORD commanded to make and so the Bible says they calls the people there and restrained the people from bringing any more offering more than enough there was more not just enough not just barely making it you see the principle we're not just going to barely make it we're not just going to Oh barely make it in the rapture we're not just barely living from day to day oh I'm just barely gonna make it to next week no you're not you have more than enough it's recognizing what you already have that God has given you when God has placed his life his oil his substance into your life you have more than enough we're not just barely gonna make it it's not just enough they were not standing there at the tabernacle door and saying oh please please can you tell somebody how about you bring five and you bring ten how about let's just make pledges and helmet they didn't do none of that they had to tell them stop bringing don't bring no more we've got more than enough the Bible says in verse 7 for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it and to much more than enough God knew what was going to be needed you see I believe that we can testify here tonight he's a faithful provider he's a faithful provider I don't know how you I don't know how you've been but I'll just testify a little bit I can remember some of the first few years we got married and where you had to put things out of the shopping cart and put it back I can remember that getting up to there to the to the line and trusting what you had in the car cause you know you got house payment and everything else is there but you know what the kingdom of God is first that was first there was no compromise on that but there's things in when you look back on it I look back in those times and my wife we talked about it many times I look back on that I look back in those mom I think God for those times it makes you appreciative it lets you know that it was God all along that was taken care of you God seemed to it we weren't for what I mean I didn't waste away to a skinflint you with me but you see within it all there were things God is a faithful provider I look at it here for this building here when we came over here to take there to to begin to look at this building you all remember here we were we had bought a lot of property or a lot a piece of property and they wouldn't let us build in that area but yet then after this coming into this place here in July of 97 you remember how that at that time you know it was mentioned you know of what we could have we came over here and we came in and said in this place how many of you remember that just within a month's time that there was over 30 thousand dollars that came in to go with what was already here it wasn't that we got a surplus of people it's that people caught the vision of what can be mine and it happened I'll never forget that I've given that testimony to many other Assemblies there that different ones that might still be written and they've asked me certain questions I've told them I said I've witnessed how God can take little and he'll multiply I remember that when we were renting the building and you know that's all we were doing is renting a building it was like no vision was there to go on and go as far as to obtain a building everything seemed impossible and I'm just gonna preach tonight a little bit you remember the different naysayers and things like that oh it's too much and we're not able to do it and we're not but let me tell you something when God's in control God is more than any naysayer he's bigger than anyone looking at we can put this together I can't put this together I'm telling you brother and sister I have two senses all right but we need to go let our two cents being the change aura of God's holy will because it's what does God say about these things if we looked at it naturally I could agree it look like that it was more than what we could do but to think of how God in His mercy here within just what was at less than seven years the building the property itself was paid off a hundred and eighty thousand dollars was already paid off say brother Samuel are you preaching money you're missing the point tonight what I'm trying to tell you is little is much when God is in it that's all it takes you see what would you begin to look for you don't need a buddy who's a millionaire you don't need somebody who's rich you know Abraham he realized he could have had whatever he wanted but Abraham told the king of Sodom he said I don't even want a shoe latch it from you because lest you say you made Abraham rich I don't want none of your riches he said but is he saying I'm depending on the Lord who is possessor of heaven and earth Abraham knew what he had right then now you might look at Abraham and I could look at Abraham you say well in that chapter brother Samuel Abraham was still you know he was in a sanctification chapter but look what he had in a sanctification chapter because abandon don't just leave that as a sanctification chapter we follow the types as it runs in certain areas but to think of what he had he had enough to know that God has brought me out here he opened a lamb that he said he would open and show to me he has provided for me and so I'm going to rest in him I'm not going to trust in flesh every time Israel got in trouble they started thinking about Egypt I'm not just talking about in the journey here I'm talking about when they got in the land they started thinking about Egypt started looking at their chariots started looking at Syria but you know what God would allow situations to arise they never had to look at those things as long as they honored the Living God who provided for him what they had need of never had to look for that this is where God is a faithful provider I'm glad about that aren't you he knows just what we have need of his children were not beggars David said it like this in psalms 37:25 I have been young and now I'm old yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread hmm Psalms 105 37 since he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes in Deuteronomy chapter 2 this is where I just just so impressed upon my heart it was not known that they were going to be 40 years in the wilderness when they left Egypt Moses didn't know they were going to be 40 years in the wilderness when they left Egypt it was afterwards that God made it known when they rebelled is that right but God knew God knew he made a promise and a seed is going to come in in here at that land God knew that out of all of that multitude there's a seed that's going to come forth and inherit that land and God provided sufficient what was needed in order for them to come into that place amen the Bible says it like this in Deuteronomy chapter 2 verse 6 ye shall buy meat of them for money I want you to watch this all through this chapter here in Deuteronomy - God tells them I don't want you meddling with them you go on back Esau you gone by the rest of them they got their inheritance that I gave them in other words God said don't you act like a bully you don't gotta go take nothing you have what you need when you come through their land you tell them I'll buy the grass I'll buy the water where did they get the money God provided God knew what they'd have needeth and God wasn't up there he didn't ask them to calculate how much grass they was gonna eat he did not hash them to calculate how much meat and how much water he didn't ask them for that they didn't have to think about that are you with me now that's where the Lord Jesus could say we're in addressing the anxiousness of the humanity and say take no thought for tomorrow Morrow shot care for itself you know any friends we're not talking about that you're not a good steward that's not what I'm saying at all but sometimes I think we get so much faith in our stewardship instead of having faith in the Living God is to have faith in Him don't rest upon your retirement of your 401 K or I got so much here in the bank that I'll not be on rest I rest should be in the Lord we do under his leadership ask him to help us to guide us to show us to direct us but our rest is in him he knows what we have need of he's more than enough I'll tell you this right here tonight you realize that if you needed a loaf of bread if you've got the 50 cents or whatever the loaf of bread cost you realize you got purchasing power you may not have the bread but you're as good as got it because you got the purchasing power you see they had purchasing power God made sure they had purchasing power and you've got purchasing power tonight for what you have need of in your life you got purchasing power but something I don't feel like I have faith or I don't feel like I've got that much faith don't even testify to that but to testify to that purchasing power that God has placed within you you see God knew a need would arise he knew a situation would come up and you see God allows that need and that situation to come up in your life or in my life that God might prove himself in our lives I'm glad that I can look back on my life and I'm there's no way that I can look back and take credit for it aren't you glad there's no way that I can look back on it you say what about that bachelor's degree in masters degree and those things hanging on the wall I don't take one bit of credit for that I look to God God gave me the abilities to be able to do that I don't look back from that this is what I was able to do it's what God in His grace has been able to bring us through friends the tests the trials those things that come our way it's God's that's provided to you and I more than enough hmm you shall buy meat of them for money that you may eat and you shall also buy water of them for money that you may drink for the LORD thy God hath blessed thee and all that works of thy hand he knoweth by walking through this great wilderness look at this these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee thou hath lacked nothing why did you like nothing because he's been with you that's what makes the difference you could have everything and yet have nothing but if you have him you have everything amen they that fear the Lord shall not want you know David came to that realization the Lord is my shepherd David when that revelation broke on his heart it was it the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he is he knows every pasture he knows just what I have need of when I have need of it he knows the circumstances of life I tell you friends tests and trials are predestined they are predestinated appointments by God for each of our life that there might be a reducing of us that it might be an increasing of him it's all for his glory and all of those things to show Lord I need you we're not beggars can you say man no where in the scripture does it place us as beggars but were to ask ask you know God God let him walk here for forty years I want you to think of this I know there's a lot of there was a lot of testimonies there was a lot of things being built to build their faith but you know there was something right next to him that they put on every morning and it was a miracle every morning when they put on their garments and they put on their shoes they were reminded 40 years never worn out you can't tell me they had better material who kept that together God did they needed clothes and God clothe them that's why Jesus could say if he closed the grass the field would grass if he takes care of the birds and provided straw for their nests isn't he much more and even knowing the hairs of your head he already knows what you have need of you see God did not want their focus to be taken away from anything but me rather be focused on the promise and that's God's desire when when God let me tell you like this when God provides for you and I as God provides God will never place in our hands something that would trouble us or hinder us God will not do that God will not do place in our hands something that would cause us to fail because if he does that he's an author of confusion and frustration but he's the author of peace when God places something in our hands whether it's a job or whether it's this and it might seem overarching to us but it's a time to look to him and say Lord this is a door that you opened maybe I don't feel fit for it I don't feel sufficient for it but you've opened this door and I'm gonna step through this Lord and as you opened it Lord I'm trusting in your grace Lord for where I'm standing your grace there to keep me to lead me and to guide me let me tell you Keane running out of grease he ain't running out of mercy as a matter of fact even as you look even those that were removed from the journey of Israel they could look back in that time and Nehemiah under the inspiration of God and Nehemiah 9 would say thou manifold mercy so God that was made known to the children of Israel God continues to unfold himself day in and day out I'll tell you what even when you think you don't need mercy you need mercy more than than you ever did we need the mercy and grace of Almighty God mercy is not just its it's not just God you know keep him from us what we deserve but friends every one of us no matter where we stand we need the mercy of Almighty God we need his correction we need his leadership we need leered the administering of his love and His grace to our lives we need that and God is more than enough see everyday they could say where's the miracle ain't seen no mere look right up next to you you're here in your right mind you're a miracle in this age that we're living in where it is infiltrated with demonic influence that lids been ticking off of hell it's all around us you don't have to go down on Skid Row you can go down on you can go down in the highest street there is it's there it's all around but to thank God that within your heart that you've got a heart to serve God a desire a pulsation that beats within your heart to please God I'll tell you that's a greatest treasure there is in this world it's more than anything else and to have our right mind in this hour sometimes we look too hard and these are the things that God has placed right around us more than enough but Simon how did their raiment not wax old God how did their feet not swell the Lord that's it it was God providing for them he is sufficient let me bring this down here examples in the scripture remember in the Lord Jesus there's malt there's there's multiple accounts but when the Lord Jesus looked upon the multitude that was following him Matthew 14 the Bible says he was moved with compassion and he looked upon him and he seen they were hungry and he told the disciples we cannot send them away hungry he said what do we have here they brought to him what was had you see he asked what's here they gave him what was there he took what was there and he multiplied what was there to meet the need and they it wasn't just enough the Bible says in Matthew 14 20 day all did eat and were filled and they took up the fragments that remained twelve baskets full not just enough more than enough God got ahold of it it wasn't just enough it was more than enough the Bible goes on in the next account in a very next chapter it goes into the seagulls into you know here's another situation [Applause] multitudes are there Jesus has moved with compassion aren't you glad that he's moved with compassion aren't you glad that he doesn't look to you and I'd say come on come on I mean come on man throw it up you know come on aren't you glad that he looks deep aren't you glad he sees the need and don't try to spiritualize all this there's a spiritual part to it but it also Jesus was looking there and see they had a physical need to be fed they were hungry come on somebody this is where John picks up the inspiration and said let us not love just in word or deed all right he said in James tells us don't just look up on somebody and they say they got a need and you say before my brother god bless you go on your way no he said when it's with you and in your power to do do it whoo this is what he did he took consideration aren't you glad Blizzard friends he we needed what's the greatest thing that we had need of is our souls the Bible says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God but we do need natural bread and God knows we need natural bread we need spiritual bread while we're here in this life do we thank God for the revelation of his word we thank God for the unfolding of his word but you know there's still a natural man that has to be fed and has to be cared for you see Jesus was not moving so walking in the clouds that he forgot about that there were needs within the natural body come on somebody Paul even brought this up over here in breach into the church and letting the church know don't be and so out here that you don't take account of the needs that are among you Jesus the Bible says was moved with compassion when he solved they were hungry and they asked again what is here they brought in the bread brought him to fish the Bible says in Matthew 15 37 and they all did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full not just enough more than enough God let this be known for our life that he is more than enough the oil that's already with those born of the Spirit of God already happened that you have what you have need of in your life you might look and say well how is that oil you're gonna pay my bill but you see what it is it's you submitting to the Lord and say Lord take control of my emotions Lord take control Lord in my faults I give my mind they give my faults I give my feelings I give it to you lord and this is what you've said in your work concerning me if there never was any other Mortal upon the face of the earth this is your word I'm your son I am your daughter Lord and I come to you in faith asking Lord God as you said in your word ask and you shall receive there's a need Lord God in my life I need in a situation and I believe that you are more than enough it wasn't just enough to take me out of the world not just enough to take the world out of me not just enough to fill me up but he's been more than enough he's been there to strengthen me when I've been in my lowest he's been there to pick me up when I fall him down he's been there to give me strength and to give me grace and to give me faith when I had need of it it's been more than enough when you and I started our journey we did not know all of the things that would come our way everything every test every trial every mistake every failure but all along the way God has proven himself that he's more than enough it's not just enough he's more than enough more than enough and God was letting Israel know I'm more than enough you haven't laughed one single thing while you've been out here 40 years you didn't plan on it you didn't see it but when I asked you to borrow from those Egyptians and that to be released I know there would be a need of it and what was given was more than enough more than enough I'm grateful to God aren't you no wonder Paul could stand up and Paul could say I know how to be you know a based I know how to be you know where I'm in walk but yet be content I know Paul said and he goes on to tell the people of God that my God shall supply according to all your needs according to his riches and glory I'm glad about that tonight these are promises that belong to you and I more than enough for us aren't you glad you know brother Graham tells us about those little trees he tells us about you know how a tree it's got every Apple and every leaf in it everyone's in it all it has to do is drink and actually drink more than its portion and then it pushes out limbs pushes out you know leaves pushes out apples and brother Brown was it just says it like this you know so simple he says that's the way a Christian is we're planted together in Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible fountain of life we're planted in Christ we just drink and drink and drink and push out everything we have nita for our earthly journey divine healing the power of God and all these other things is in every individual in here that's received a baptism of the Holy Ghost for your planet in Christ the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir what you have Nita for this life's journey even the rapture is in you right then he says don't resent that that's the truth the rapture is in us now he said I can prove it by the gospel those who he called he justified those he justified he's already glorified he says Oh hallelujah then in heaven today were a glorified in the presence of God right now I'm just pushing out to it glory God's in his word over and over you hear brother Ben we'll take that part of the inexhaustible fountain of God brother Bama will dramatize it a little fish he's taking imagine a little fish out here in the lake or in the ocean I better not drink too much water I might drink it all up Robinson can you imagine a little mouse that's there in Egypt underneath the Garner's during the time of Joseph I better ration out this green I may not be able you know there may not be enough though Graham said there was more than enough if you live thousands of years but I'm still like this he said there's more of the blessings of God he said it God will still be pouring out of his blessings you cannot exhaust [Music] the oil is sufficient more than enough he's our stabilizer there's nothing these vessels can say well I did this the glory was not the vessel the vessel is not what paid off the debt come on somebody he said go get empty vessels and put oil in it and then go sell the oil you had to have vessels that could hold the oil so it's not about the vessels it's the oil in it it's not any value that we can glory in ourselves there's no glory in ourselves but the glory is the excellency of his power in earthen vessels it's the oil that's in these frail human vessels that's the glory of God not the vessel the glory of God the oil of God that's on the inside and a fire that's burning to show there's all hell down there in that lamp there's oil in that lamp oh there's more than enough more than enough aren't you glad there's more than enough God knows exactly what we would have need of he knows what your need is tonight he knows he's more than enough you can take that that an example in that testimony and you can just rest within that knowing you're not a beggar you're a son and daughter of God amen you have redemptive rights and he wants you to use those redemptive rights you think you think what it does to our Heavenly Father when you and I would come to him and we say Lord Jesus there's a need right here Lord and father we're looking to you if we believe it's already a finished work think what that does to Papa when he hears faith coming forth like that let me tell you something it's so turned his heart when was a Roman centurion that day that could rise in that place and say I don't need you to come to my house but you just say the word and he'll be healed he said what faith what faith is this I've not found faith like this within Israel you see what it was he recognized who was there what it does to our Heavenly Father when we can just by faith recognize and come before him and ask let our petitions be known we're not begging we're asking amen because we are his sons and daughters by His redemptive grace by the blood that's been shed and the life within that blood that's been poured out and has brought you and I back to this place to be manifested sons and daughters of God oh my we're not beggars we're sons and daughters of God whatever it is there's nothing - you could say minuscule there's nothing - little as a matter of fact brother Bentham said it like this he said God wants you to ask for big things matter of fact brother Bram goes saying that same quote he says what I'm doing right now he said I'm asking God for thousands of souls in this meeting come on friends he said God wants us to ask big things why are we asking like we're just dealing with a little saucer a little teacup he's not just a saucer or a teacup hey men that's the devil's lied that he just wants to trickle out in this out that's a lie it's not a trickling in this hour there is a fullness there is a fountain for you and I that's open in the house of David the Jews will come to that realization in their hour but you and I have the realization in this hour it's the inexhaustible fountain of Almighty God amen we're living in his presence amen that's why I believe that we can expect and living in his presence then we can expect all things hallelujah let's bow our heads Lord Jesus Lord you see in my heart lord I these things Lord of just burning but lord I I certainly didn't mean tonight Lord - Lord - perhaps - minister Lord I just wanted to share a few thoughts but lord I prayed your God that father these thoughts Lord that have been shared Lord Oh God like Lord would look like the Lord - look at it from up here it looks like Lourdes things are just scattered out Lord but father how things that you come Lord and just inspiring and bringing it together to speak to us Lord I'm glad to be reminded I'm glad to be reminded that you're more than enough Paul would testify and say our sufficiency is not of ourselves our sufficiency is of the Lord Lord God it's by your strength Lord you provide just what we have need of you place the Lord God in our hands what we're able to handle and father even what you would put within our hands whatever Lord that that it would be may we walk in our lives like Solomon did Lord when things were placed before Solomon Solomon he made a request Lord so I've been very dear to my heart where Solomon would ask of you and say Lord will you order my going in and my coming out Lord Jesus Solomon had been raised in the house of a king he saw his daddy as a king he watched these things but he wanted that same unction that David had he wanted you to mold his character is going out and his coming in he wanted you to do that Lord father this is our desire Lord that you would just continue to mold us or do you know the needs just some things Lord that came forth as a testimony tonight witnessing Lord how that you have provided [Music] ward on and on we could go with testimonies in with that Lord Lord I believe go hard with all of our hearts or do we have a testimony or God of you're keeping power sustaining strength comfort all-father how we appreciate your order we just love your Lord Jesus well god I think of it the children of Israel they're in a natural their garment never ever tattered their feet were never swollen [Music] I'm grateful Lord that is that spoke of that there I know that you can still do that I've just heard a testimony Lord God I can't remember the number of years but Lord I heard a testimony brother Tim humans had given brother in Africa they bought him a suit and that brother wore that suit Lord I'm looking at it now I don't know if it was 30 years or what that suit they end up burying him in that suit he wore that suit continuously it never wore out there was a testimony Lord I heard that Lord when brother Tim had shared that it just it just touched my heart because we know that Lord there's a garment of the Holy Spirit place Lord in our life that never wears out but to see how that God that you would take that Lord of a need within that brother's life or as a minister and that suit that was bought for him it wouldn't wear out as a testimony it wasn't that he kept it up Lord when I can recall as by the Tim was sharing that testimony it wasn't that he kept it up it wasn't that he sparsely wore it Lord you just do those things to do it to show your God it's not just for not but it's testimonies its witnesses Lord of your grace and I'm just simple enough to believe that Lord I'm simple enough to believe that I believe Lord Garvin I'm standing here tonight with brothers and sisters simple enough just to believe that Lord for whatever the need would be the circumstance Lord the situation that they're facing I pray father may the voice rise within them more than enough I'm more than enough rennet more you know their knee maybe it's physical Lord maybe it's healing in their body you're more than enough but maybe it's financially you're more than enough Lord Jesus you're more than enough Lord you open doors and you close doors father our lives they're in your hands the Lord we're trusting in you we are the Sheep of your pasture we're trusting in you you are Shepherd Lord we're looking to you our fear our reverence Lord is to you and as you said we shall not want Lord now that petition that's upon the hearts as they hold that petition up Lord before you right now I pray Heavenly Father with that purchasing power of faith Lord God may you grant to them Lord their requests father it'll be another testimony you're more than enough Lord we ask it for your glory for you are all that we have need of lloyd as David said over and over the Lord is my portion we love you Lord Jesus the glory of God we ask it in Jesus name Amen [Music] baby maybe we can just do that for next Thursday we'll just maybe just speak a little bit more just do it at time of testimony I just felt to do that and I know our time got away from us and I don't want to I don't want to keep you but let's just stand and sing that and we'll lay that in for next Thursday let's sing that only Jesus can satisfy
