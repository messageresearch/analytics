[38:36] that was
[38:38] in 1903
[38:41] 1904 less than 20 years later 1921 was
[38:44] when the song only believe was written
[38:47] so God has been moving with people all
[38:49] along amen let's pray Heavenly Father we
[38:52] thank you for all your mercy to us we
[38:55] thank you Lord that we have the
[38:56] technology you we can reach back into
[38:58] the past and see the
[39:02] blessings and feel the same holy spirit
[39:06] thank you Lord for this opportunity to
[39:07] be here with brother Samuel and the
[39:10] Saints here I pray that you'd help us
[39:12] tonight that everyone could take a
[39:14] blessing from here help us now in Jesus
[39:17] name amen you may be
[39:22] seated that'll be all the music thank
[39:24] you very much we got some tremendous
[39:26] musicians here
[39:33] and we're uh we're thankful to be in
[39:35] fellowship with Saints of like Precious
[39:50] Faith so I don't get it here very often
[39:52] so we're going to take advantage of the
[39:54] time because don't know when to be back
[39:58] you know we might see you the meeting in
[40:00] the air next meeting we don't
[40:03] know but before we get into the
[40:06] questions uh we have some things that we
[40:09] want to share and that is that
[40:13] sometimes uh people don't understand the
[40:18] basis of our
[40:19] belief you have relatives you got
[40:22] friends you got people you work with and
[40:25] how do you how do you share it with them
[40:27] well well we've got two items here that
[40:29] brother Samuel has that are a big
[40:33] blessing they're only 50 cents each and
[40:37] you can share with
[40:39] anybody a resume of the church ages
[40:42] chapter 10 out of the church age book
[40:44] we're going to get that in a minute
[40:45] because there's some of you don't think
[40:47] it's inspired well that's your personal
[40:49] problem but it's God's
[40:51] word so we got the resume of the seven
[40:53] Church ages we got it's all here in 16 p
[40:58] 50 cents if they get if they can't get
[41:00] past that well then they're not worth
[41:02] worryed about don't go no farther you
[41:04] can't make a sheep out of a
[41:08] goat pastors eventually learned that
[41:11] yeah and of course we got
[41:14] baptism okay this is excellent excellent
[41:18] track I didn't write it but I
[41:20] Incorporated it got my picture on the
[41:22] back imagine
[41:24] that brother brandom didn't invent acts
[41:26] 238
[41:28] it was already in the
[41:30] Bible this track is simply scripture and
[41:33] history nobody can get past that if a
[41:38] trinitarian you know chokes at this he's
[41:41] going to be a trinitarian from now on so
[41:43] we have those as far as you know
[41:48] um witnessing
[41:50] tools there's no sense giving somebody a
[41:53] 400 page book if they gave it to you
[41:55] you'd be scared you'd put it away right
[41:57] give them something simple milk of the
[42:00] word use you
[42:02] know and the other thing is that a lot
[42:05] of people don't realize that God loved
[42:09] the spirit of Elijah so much he used it
[42:13] five times throughout history the only
[42:16] person in the scriptures that he used
[42:17] five
[42:18] times not making this up it's in your
[42:22] Bible so if you go to if you go to First
[42:25] Kings 17 through 19
[42:29] and you'll see where that God used
[42:33] Elijah
[42:35] okay Elijah the tishbite that means he
[42:38] came from a little place called
[42:41] tishby I went over there one day it's
[42:43] just one little house it's just rocks
[42:46] but it was a village that's where he was
[42:48] from totally
[42:50] unknown but God used him and he he used
[42:53] him in such a way you can read all about
[42:56] it in your Bible I'm not going to give
[42:57] you the whole story you got to go read
[42:59] it
[43:00] yourself but there it is First Kings
[43:02] starting verse in in chapter 17 then
[43:05] when he was leaving he had a guy
[43:07] following him his name happened to be
[43:10] Elisha very similar he was a young man
[43:14] and they came up to the River
[43:16] Jordan and she would now what are we
[43:18] going to do took his Manel smoke the
[43:22] river the waters parted now if you've
[43:25] been near a river the muds about 3 ft
[43:28] deep the dry the ground was dry another
[43:32] miracle walked across and he was caught
[43:34] up in a chariot of fire and he dropped
[43:37] his mantel Elisha grabbed it he came
[43:39] back to the river it was already flowing
[43:42] again where's the god of Elijah smacked
[43:44] the river again opened up second time he
[43:48] used him time goes
[43:50] by we get clear down to the Book of
[43:53] Malachi chapter
[43:55] 3 and it prophesies that there's going
[43:58] to be another use of Elijah that's in
[44:02] your Bible right go to Matthew
[44:04] 11:10 Matthew uh Malachi 4 5 and 6
[44:09] there's two there yeah some people think
[44:11] it's one oh there's two it's obvious you
[44:14] know and go to Luke 17
[44:17] 176 where it's he cuts it apart okay
[44:21] this is this one here you know Matthew
[44:25] 17 which is very
[44:27] very crucial scripture and we'll just
[44:30] look at that real quick Matthew
[44:32] 17 because some people think I I know
[44:35] man well M Malachi that's the Old
[44:37] Testament okay let's go see what the
[44:40] what the master himself said in Matthew
[44:44] 17 and um we can never go wrong reading
[44:48] the
[44:49] word so in Matthew 17 Jesus and the
[44:52] disciples have been up to the
[44:54] mountain and they're coming down from
[44:56] the mountain on verse 9 of 17 as they
[44:59] came down from the mountain Jesus
[45:00] charged them saying don't tell anybody
[45:03] about this until the son of man is risen
[45:05] again from the dead now this is one of
[45:08] the few times that he's you know given
[45:10] him a hint something bad's going to
[45:11] happen he's going to die he's going to
[45:13] raise again and the disciples said well
[45:16] sir why why say the scribes that Elijah
[45:19] must first come and see they're still
[45:21] looking for
[45:22] Elijah we were the guys with the clubs
[45:25] on our back didn't have a CL
[45:28] we didn't know Elijah was supposed to
[45:29] come cuz we didn't read our Bible
[45:33] shame but they're still looking for
[45:35] Elijah I know those
[45:37] people and the serious ones oh yeah
[45:40] messiah's almost here we we know that
[45:42] but first we'll see Elijah he'll either
[45:45] be right beside him or two steps in
[45:47] front of him but we'll see Elijah first
[45:49] so they've been looking for him for for
[45:52] centuries and Jesus answering their
[45:55] question said El El Elijah truly shall
[45:59] first come and restore all things
[46:01] period
[46:03] okay but I'm saying to you guys Elijah
[46:07] has already come they knew him not but
[46:09] have done unto him whatsoever they uh
[46:12] listed whatever you know was written of
[46:13] him to do likewise shall the son of man
[46:16] suffer of them then the disciples
[46:18] understood that he spoke to them of John
[46:20] the Baptist that they were a little bit
[46:22] thickheaded like some of us they weren't
[46:25] catching the Revelation here's the
[46:26] here's the Lamb of
[46:28] God that chose them got them off the
[46:30] fish and everything he's telling them
[46:33] the words of eternal life and so people
[46:36] stick with that with John the Baptist
[46:38] wait a minute like I told you this
[46:40] morning Dr scoffield finished his work
[46:43] January the 1st
[46:45] 1909 without a
[46:47] computer and he says down here at the
[46:50] bottom these passages must be construed
[46:53] together one Christ confirms right here
[46:56] here in this verse
[46:58] 12 the specific and still unfulfilled
[47:01] prophecy of Malachi 456 Elijah shall
[47:04] truly first come and restore all things
[47:07] aha it's been in the Bible for over 100
[47:10] years what's the matter with all these
[47:12] people I didn't write the Bible it's
[47:14] it's right
[47:16] there now we've got people today you
[47:19] probably know some of them that are
[47:22] convinced that William brandom didn't
[47:24] fulfill that scripture
[47:27] well I'm here to tell you he was my
[47:28] father-in-law I knew him very well and
[47:31] I've been studying this for over about
[47:32] 60 years he was the Fulfillment of
[47:35] Malachi
[47:36] 4 now if you don't think it is then stop
[47:40] throwing rocks at us go out there and
[47:42] find him because Jesus said he's
[47:45] coming he's he's some
[47:47] place I mean let's just be logical put
[47:50] it all on the
[47:51] table you don't need Revelation just go
[47:53] find
[47:54] him well so that's number
[47:57] four and number five he comes to the
[48:00] Jews in Revelations 11
[48:04] okay Elijah and
[48:06] Moses we don't have to
[48:09] guess now in one of my trips to Israel
[48:12] is anybody in a hurry to
[48:14] go I can't hardly see the clock for all
[48:16] the glare but we'll just assume that
[48:19] we're okay still daylight
[48:22] outside and one of my trips I was there
[48:24] for two trips and so I had about 3 days
[48:26] in between and um so my guy being a
[48:29] retired uh person he was looking after
[48:33] me and we went to visit some other
[48:35] friends of his some other retired people
[48:37] okay so here we are in this house with
[48:40] uh six Jewish retired people very
[48:44] intelligent people and the guy that
[48:46] owned the house had a library I mean he
[48:48] had books everywhere very intelligent
[48:51] people and so one of the ladies says now
[48:54] now Ruben tells us that your your
[48:56] father-in-law was a prophet can you tell
[48:58] us about that well now that you
[49:01] [Laughter]
[49:04] asked I said now surely in all of this
[49:06] you've got a Hebrew New Testament oh
[49:09] yeah right here well so we go right here
[49:12] and I I point out some of these things
[49:13] to them and I said see Elijah is coming
[49:17] five times well they didn't know that
[49:19] they know Elijah is supposed to come to
[49:20] them but they didn't know was five
[49:22] times I said four times to you and one
[49:25] times to us
[49:27] and so she says y when is he coming I
[49:30] don't
[49:31] know but your Elijah is coming and so
[49:36] they they're very keen on Elijah and one
[49:39] of the things they say all the time you
[49:41] know because they study the life of
[49:43] Elijah from from children they they
[49:44] study the life of Elijah and they say
[49:47] now he was a pretty nice guy but don't
[49:49] push him cuz you will cut your head
[49:53] off like he did all those false prophets
[49:56] so we are following the teachings of
[49:59] William brandom because it's
[50:01] scripture he didn't make it up he didn't
[50:04] invent stuff he didn't dig it up no he
[50:07] preached scripture and the whole point
[50:09] of the message of the ministry was to
[50:11] bring us back to the open book so if you
[50:14] don't read your Bible you're the one
[50:16] that's losing out you read your Bible
[50:19] every day and the four steps to stay
[50:22] balanced oh yeah we got to put this up
[50:25] here the four steps to stay
[50:28] balanced you read at least one chapter
[50:30] out of your Bible every
[50:32] day everybody can do you guys going do
[50:35] that yeah you read one page out of your
[50:38] church age book never hurt
[50:43] anybody and you listen to at least 30
[50:45] minutes of God's prophet and you pray
[50:49] and you follow those four steps every
[50:50] day you'll have a more Balanced Life and
[50:53] the pastor will have an easier job
[50:57] so we've covered
[50:59] Elijah we got the tracks scripture
[51:05] now
[51:06] um God called me to translate the
[51:09] message from English to Spanish okay my
[51:12] parents were um Baptist missionaries and
[51:17] they started
[51:18] out as ones that wanted to bring the
[51:23] Bible into the language of a people that
[51:25] didn't even have a written
[51:27] language I know it's hard to believe we
[51:29] live in 21st C everybody's got a$1 th000
[51:31] phone but there's 7,000 languages on the
[51:35] planet today uhhuh some are still spoken
[51:40] only nothing
[51:42] written the scriptures are currently in
[51:46] about 750 languages the whole Bible the
[51:50] New Testament I think is about 1500
[51:53] languages so there's people busy at this
[51:55] all the time they're busy busy busy and
[51:58] back in
[52:00] 1944 my dad went to the mountains of
[52:02] Mexico looking for this tribe of I don't
[52:05] know how many people because they had no
[52:07] written language well he didn't have the
[52:10] 20-year patience that it would take to
[52:11] do that and he left that job for
[52:12] somebody else and eventually got done
[52:15] but um there's something in the blood
[52:17] about getting the blessing that we hear
[52:21] as we hear on
[52:23] tape get that blessing over here for
[52:25] these people
[52:27] that they can understand the same thing
[52:29] get the same
[52:31] blessing and no it's not word for word
[52:34] now you guys that know Spanish you know
[52:35] there's no such thing as word for word
[52:37] translation it doesn't exist in the
[52:40] Bible where it says that Jesus went and
[52:42] prayed for the little girl and there's
[52:45] these words which means well don't even
[52:47] match up you know so it's got to you got
[52:50] to come by by phrase what does this say
[52:53] over here in this language to produce
[52:55] the same effect okay that's
[52:58] right and so that's what I've been doing
[53:01] since I got out of the army
[53:03] 1967 now you would think that by now we
[53:05] can have it all done no it takes time so
[53:08] when I first got started I realized that
[53:12] okay we got today we got 125 messages of
[53:15] William bradam they're all on the cell
[53:17] phone everybody can hear them but I'm
[53:19] not going to live long enough to do all
[53:21] that it's not going to it's not possible
[53:23] some other people got involved and so
[53:25] it's all done now but um the fact is
[53:31] that we just want the other people to
[53:33] hear the same thing we hear it produce
[53:37] the same thing if it's done right you
[53:39] see we want the preacher to preach the
[53:41] word we want the song leader to stick
[53:44] with the original songs you know so the
[53:48] translation has to be done right anyway
[53:50] so I get involved and we translated the
[53:53] church age book and uh um I can see
[53:58] right away see I've got one of the
[53:59] original books the original Church age
[54:02] book came out in 1965 in December I was
[54:05] in the Army I got my know hardbound copy
[54:08] still and but it's all kind of one
[54:11] paragraph sometimes so when we put it in
[54:14] Spanish aha let's put some paragraphs to
[54:17] this put some paragraph numbers and you
[54:21] know highlight the scriptures and all
[54:22] that so we've had that version for years
[54:25] since 19
[54:28] 7071 so some of the uh english- speaking
[54:32] people they saw it well how come we
[54:33] don't have this in in English so I
[54:36] talked to my brother-in-law and said hey
[54:37] look you know people want this want this
[54:39] same outline like this in in English no
[54:43] he said that W have never work no
[54:44] they've already memorized the page
[54:45] numbers and and fine it's your book move
[54:48] on but about 10 years ago a brother in
[54:51] Canada said look my grandchildren are
[54:53] not reading that blue book it's it it
[54:55] doesn't lay open it's one paragraph It's
[54:58] not
[54:59] readable so I went back to the
[55:01] brothers-in-law I said look guys there's
[55:03] a demand for the church age book to be
[55:07] you know put out in in
[55:10] paragraphs and um they said no we're get
[55:13] to S the way Dad left it okay I said
[55:16] look I can I can arrange it for you send
[55:20] it to you you guys print it and nope
[55:23] fine so I prayed about 5 minutes and did
[55:27] it
[55:29] myself and so today we have you know the
[55:33] book with paragraph numbers it's
[55:36] readable this is printed in China on
[55:39] better paper cheaper than you can do
[55:41] anywhere in it's USA so um we got the
[55:45] seal book and we got and then we got the
[55:47] church age book both in a readable
[55:50] fashion
[55:52] now there's people that don't like this
[55:54] and I don't get I'm not going to go into
[55:56] all reasons they don't like it but the
[55:57] point is it was never meant to be word
[56:00] for word according to the tape I'll give
[56:03] you the brief
[56:04] history in the first tape of the church
[56:07] age book in the
[56:10] Revelation December of 60 61 brother R
[56:14] says I'm going to write a book I could
[56:17] have set up at the house and done it but
[56:19] I wanted to come down here to get the
[56:20] you know inspiration with you people so
[56:22] he comes down he preaches the whole
[56:24] series finishes nobody says a word life
[56:27] goes on so a little sister with I don't
[56:31] know what Machinery she typed it all
[56:34] off that takes time and she shows up and
[56:38] she gives brother R this stack of paper
[56:40] you said book where's your
[56:42] book well that's nice now if he wanted a
[56:46] word for word off the tape he could have
[56:48] took that to the printer in two weeks
[56:49] had the book he wanted it readable he
[56:52] knew his limitations he knew his level
[56:56] of Education he wanted where you could
[56:58] read and understand what he's saying
[57:00] right it never was his uh intention to
[57:05] have a database with all the little
[57:08] thethe at at and no he wanted it in a
[57:11] language that you can understand okay he
[57:14] trusted people to edit his messages back
[57:18] then eventually we ended up with What's
[57:21] called the exposition of the church
[57:24] ages I'll challenge all the
[57:26] Sayers open challenge bring me the first
[57:30] person in any language that's been hurt
[57:32] by that
[57:33] book it doesn't exist right people read
[57:37] it they love it because it's
[57:39] understandable oh that's what you mean
[57:41] so that's the history of the church age
[57:43] book okay but if you want to continue in
[57:46] your confusion that's your choice but we
[57:50] can only speak the truth okay so you've
[57:53] got tracks that you can testify with
[57:56] because not everybody's gifted like
[57:58] brother Samuel to you know spit it out
[58:00] real quick so there's tracks that you
[58:02] can here here's what we believe you know
[58:04] and once they latch on to the message
[58:07] well then you got something they can
[58:08] read wow didn't know this existed yeah
[58:12] okay any questions so
[58:15] far good you had your
[58:18] chance now we have some questions here
[58:22] and you know these are things that are
[58:24] on people's minds I assume they're all
[58:26] sitting here I don't know so we'll just
[58:28] go through them as best we can um is
[58:31] there anything else I can say about the
[58:32] church Ag and seal
[58:39] book okay so so he he he asked brother
[58:43] Vil to to write here here's the stack of
[58:46] papers do something with this make make
[58:49] make a book out of this well brother
[58:51] Bale says well we'll have to kind of
[58:53] rewrite this we got to come to serpent
[58:55] seed got to explain what that is have to
[58:58] go through this easily you
[59:00] know okay so during the 5 Years From 61
[59:05] to 65 brother R's preaching a whole lot
[59:07] of other great things they got
[59:09] incorporated into the exposition to
[59:12] start with and so as he would write as
[59:16] they would put these chapters together
[59:19] they would get him you know typed out
[59:21] and then would send them to brother BR
[59:23] is this what you want
[59:24] said so he he would read some of it he
[59:27] would have others read to him Rebecca
[59:29] read read to him a lot of times and so
[59:31] here they are reading a
[59:34] manuscript and he said no change that
[59:36] right there because that's not going to
[59:37] fit with what's on the next page how do
[59:40] you know
[59:42] that prophet's a little smarter than we
[59:46] are I've got one of those manuscripts at
[59:48] my house and uh and I I saw him doing
[59:51] some of this you know so he read the
[59:53] whole thing this is what this is the way
[59:54] I want it yes it's just the way I want
[59:56] it now you can argue with it but look
[59:59] this is the man that the angel came to
[1:00:01] on a regular basis he didn't come to me
[1:00:04] didn't come Samuel came to William
[1:00:05] Brandon so if something's wrong he would
[1:00:07] have corrected him okay it's just that
[1:00:11] simple okay question number one is your
[1:00:14] daughter planning on writing another
[1:00:15] book no no she's busy with what she does
[1:00:20] she didn't actually write that book okay
[1:00:22] she went and got testimonies I got some
[1:00:24] of the testimonies
[1:00:26] Rebecca edited them and we have the
[1:00:29] generation book that simple what I want
[1:00:32] to
[1:00:33] do is and I talked to a brother about a
[1:00:35] month ago is produce a not a book but
[1:00:38] it'll be online because printing books
[1:00:41] is very expensive now but I want to make
[1:00:43] a um a page called The Inspired writings
[1:00:46] of sister
[1:00:47] Rebecca we have all kinds of things that
[1:00:49] she wrote and we make those in some kind
[1:00:52] of alphabetical order or something and
[1:00:54] it' be a big blessing to people you you
[1:00:56] read some of them in this in the the uh
[1:00:59] only believe magazine there's other
[1:01:00] Publications get all those in one place
[1:01:03] put them online under onlyb believe.com
[1:01:05] it'd be a big blessing to people she's
[1:01:08] been gone 18 years okay and so that
[1:01:11] would be the next thing we put
[1:01:13] out number two how many witnesses are
[1:01:16] there left since the the book generation
[1:01:18] was published besides you maybe
[1:01:22] three most of them are gone there's
[1:01:26] there's no preachers left there's one
[1:01:27] left down in Arkansas but he's almost
[1:01:30] doesn't count because you know it's kind
[1:01:35] of so that I it's not credible okay so
[1:01:39] yeah there's there's very
[1:01:42] few were there any humorous moments you
[1:01:45] had with brother
[1:01:47] brandom well I can't think even right
[1:01:50] off hand he was a great jokester he
[1:01:52] loved a great joke I mean he could laugh
[1:01:55] and laugh and laugh because he had to
[1:01:57] let off the pressure
[1:01:59] somehow
[1:02:01] um we were we were uh
[1:02:06] waiting in the car he was in his car I
[1:02:09] was in my car behind him we're waiting
[1:02:12] at the curb for the ladies to get ready
[1:02:14] because we're were going to go someplace
[1:02:15] I don't know where we're going well
[1:02:16] they're not not coming not coming so I
[1:02:18] finally got out of my car and went sat
[1:02:19] with him he said George what are we
[1:02:21] going to do can't live with them can't
[1:02:23] live without him
[1:02:27] so he had he had a great sense of humor
[1:02:31] yeah was there one thing that
[1:02:33] seemed unreal but was so real well I
[1:02:37] don't know what you're thinking about
[1:02:40] writing that but um yeah there was a lot
[1:02:44] of things that okay this is the way it
[1:02:46] is but how do I get here you
[1:02:49] know it is
[1:02:52] unreal for example why did he accept me
[1:02:56] I wasn't even part of the operation but
[1:02:59] yet he accepted me in you
[1:03:01] know um what stood out the most to you
[1:03:05] of brother brandom that is always in the
[1:03:07] back of your
[1:03:09] mind
[1:03:12] um
[1:03:14] well uh when he called to tell me you
[1:03:17] know congratulate me on receiving the
[1:03:19] holy ghost that was pretty amazing he
[1:03:21] was thousand miles away yet he knew what
[1:03:23] was happening so there's few things like
[1:03:26] that um was there anything God revealed
[1:03:30] to you about brother brandom and was the
[1:03:33] moment you knew who he was and no I
[1:03:36] can't say specifically no um it's just
[1:03:41] something gradually oh this is
[1:03:43] scriptural this is real you know this
[1:03:46] isn't just another Baptist preacher so
[1:03:49] that that came
[1:03:50] gradually uh brother br's personal
[1:03:53] advice to me or others seeking the Holy
[1:03:57] Ghost
[1:03:58] pray read your Bible and
[1:04:01] pray that's something my mother told us
[1:04:03] when we were very small now here he is
[1:04:06] repeating it that's the clue you got to
[1:04:09] get in and read the
[1:04:11] instructions doesn't come by osmosis you
[1:04:14] don't put it on and go to sleep you
[1:04:15] won't get it that way you get the Bible
[1:04:17] out and you
[1:04:20] read can someone receive the Holy Ghost
[1:04:23] outside of a message Church
[1:04:27] maybe when you get to heaven there's
[1:04:29] going to be a lot of
[1:04:31] surprises oh how'd you get here what are
[1:04:35] you doing here I thought she was going
[1:04:37] to the other
[1:04:41] place we just wait till we get there
[1:04:44] yeah that's why that's why he gives us
[1:04:47] this 30 days that we talked about this
[1:04:50] morning we have that time to see if Aunt
[1:04:53] Sally made it is Grandma going all
[1:04:55] that's going to be taken care of before
[1:04:57] we go because when we get there all the
[1:04:59] attention will be on him you know and
[1:05:02] God has some surgical way of taking some
[1:05:05] memories out and leaving other memories
[1:05:07] because otherwise it'd be a very sad
[1:05:09] place you know so um uh in line of that
[1:05:14] same thinking you know when Rebecca was
[1:05:17] in probably fifth or sixth grade she
[1:05:21] asked brother random um are there people
[1:05:24] on those other planet
[1:05:27] he said we would be very narrow-minded
[1:05:29] to think we're the only
[1:05:32] ones
[1:05:36] surprises
[1:05:38] okay if one feels the Lord may be
[1:05:40] calling them to the ministry what are
[1:05:43] things one should do to find if that is
[1:05:46] truly the Lord's will and how will you
[1:05:49] know well you can start by reading 1
[1:05:53] Timothy chapter 3 4 and 5
[1:05:56] get into the word god reveals himself by
[1:06:00] the word to his people right okay he's
[1:06:03] not going to reveal to you something
[1:06:04] outside of the word so go study 1
[1:06:07] Timothy 3:4 and 5 and you'll get a sense
[1:06:11] whether you're part of it or
[1:06:13] not did Brother random ever go into more
[1:06:15] detail about the seven angels that came
[1:06:17] to him and how he was drawn more to the
[1:06:20] seventh
[1:06:21] angel and how he was drawn more to the
[1:06:24] seventh than any the other
[1:06:26] Angel he called that angel very notable
[1:06:29] quote you will notice that the one Angel
[1:06:31] was very notable to me the rest of them
[1:06:34] just was seemed ordinarily but this
[1:06:37] Angel was a noted Angel he was to my
[1:06:40] left in the constellation in the form of
[1:06:42] a pyramid seventh
[1:06:45] seal okay
[1:06:50] um those are the details you didn't you
[1:06:53] didn't tell us anything more than what's
[1:06:54] right there
[1:06:56] but now if you want to get
[1:06:59] serious go over to Revelation
[1:07:03] 19 and see what we got over
[1:07:06] here where John is you know getting all
[1:07:10] this Revelation seeing all these great
[1:07:14] things and in Revelations
[1:07:18] 19 says here in verse
[1:07:22] 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:07:24] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:07:26] Lamb has come and his wife has made
[1:07:28] herself
[1:07:29] ready you ever thought about that how
[1:07:31] she how'd she make herself ready she
[1:07:33] studied to make herself approved she got
[1:07:35] in serious with the word she listened to
[1:07:37] the ministry
[1:07:39] okay and to her was granted that she
[1:07:42] should be a r in fine linen clean and
[1:07:44] white for the fine linen is the
[1:07:46] righteousness of the Saints and he said
[1:07:49] unto me okay some some being is saying
[1:07:52] unto John write less are they which are
[1:07:56] called un the marriage supper of the
[1:07:57] lamb and he said unto me these are true
[1:08:01] sayings of God and I fell at his feet so
[1:08:04] John Falls at the feet to worship him
[1:08:07] and he said unto me John see thou do it
[1:08:10] not I am of thy fellow servant and of
[1:08:13] thy Brethren that have the testimony of
[1:08:15] Jesus worship God the testimony of Jesus
[1:08:17] the spirit of
[1:08:22] Prophecy I'm not saying that's William
[1:08:24] brandom but it was an angel it could
[1:08:27] have been the same angel that he's
[1:08:28] talking about over here in the seventh
[1:08:30] seal that look very notable to him
[1:08:33] because as he's going through the Seven
[1:08:36] Seals he had no clue what was coming the
[1:08:38] next day he had to sweat it out and bite
[1:08:41] the fingernails and and pray and God
[1:08:44] revealed to him each night what what the
[1:08:46] next seal was and it was the these Seven
[1:08:49] Angels were bringing him something each
[1:08:51] night well the one that brought the
[1:08:53] seventh part was some some had some
[1:08:56] relation to him okay you call it
[1:08:59] theophany whatever it was but there's
[1:09:00] some kind of relation so I don't know
[1:09:03] but this over here could be the same
[1:09:06] one think about
[1:09:09] it a few years ago you talked about how
[1:09:12] brother brandham would travel places and
[1:09:14] he would not have his hands on the
[1:09:16] steering wheel the car was driving
[1:09:18] itself while he was praying or studying
[1:09:20] could you expand on expand upon more
[1:09:23] Supernatural experiences that out to you
[1:09:27] that weren't written down in the message
[1:09:28] that were just everyday type experiences
[1:09:31] outside the church well that happened
[1:09:34] more than once happened several times
[1:09:36] that he there was such a presence in the
[1:09:39] car that he he just raised his hands and
[1:09:42] car go over the bridge and turn God's in
[1:09:45] control yeah the these kind of things
[1:09:47] were quite common
[1:09:50] um not common but they did happen in his
[1:09:53] life you know and he didn't tell
[1:09:55] everything you
[1:09:57] knew uh I think I told once about they
[1:09:59] were in a
[1:10:01] restaurant and the family was having
[1:10:03] lunch and this other table was a
[1:10:05] policeman and as soon as the policeman's
[1:10:07] food came well then his radio started
[1:10:12] blasting left the food and took off the
[1:10:14] light flashing brother just kept eating
[1:10:16] everybody else was nervous he said it's
[1:10:18] no big deal were there a few blocks boy
[1:10:21] fell out of a tree he broke his arm but
[1:10:24] he's going to be okay
[1:10:27] that was his life and Rebecca said now
[1:10:29] we knew everybody's daddy didn't do
[1:10:34] that did Brother brandom give you and
[1:10:36] your wife any oneon-one advice regarding
[1:10:39] marriage they were not written or
[1:10:41] recorded in the message no only be
[1:10:46] careful did Brother Ram give you and
[1:10:48] your wife any one-on-one advice
[1:10:49] regarding raising children they were not
[1:10:51] written and recorded the message no he
[1:10:53] didn't he lived by example he he didn't
[1:10:58] give a lot of
[1:11:01] instruction despite the tragic nature of
[1:11:03] brother R's death what were the natural
[1:11:06] and spiritual blessings that came from
[1:11:09] it well good question I was there and U
[1:11:15] what we had to do was dig in for oursel
[1:11:18] you couldn't call anybody hey I need
[1:11:20] help no you had to learn to pray for
[1:11:23] yourself you know and and so uh we
[1:11:27] learned to listen oh because see when
[1:11:29] people went to the the meetings back
[1:11:31] then um very few were paying attention
[1:11:34] to what he said they're watching for the
[1:11:37] Miracles and everybody in the prayer
[1:11:39] line wanted to know you know for him to
[1:11:42] tell them where they were yesterday and
[1:11:43] what their name was and their address
[1:11:45] there's not time God bless you move on
[1:11:48] you know and so now we had to get
[1:11:50] serious now we had to start
[1:11:52] listening and that's
[1:11:55] some of the blessings that came from it
[1:11:57] just that
[1:11:59] simple did Brother random do daily
[1:12:01] devotions with his family well sometimes
[1:12:03] when he was home
[1:12:05] yeah do you think brother Brandon would
[1:12:07] be proud of the message churches today
[1:12:09] or do you think there are things he'd be
[1:12:12] disappointed in he'd be very
[1:12:16] disappointed he would put his head into
[1:12:18] one of some of our churches huh it's not
[1:12:20] the way I left it move
[1:12:21] on I don't care how many pictures you
[1:12:23] have how many books you have
[1:12:26] if you don't have the spirit of the
[1:12:28] word you got idolatry right that's right
[1:12:31] he was anti- idolatry so yeah he'd be
[1:12:34] very disappointed in a lot of the
[1:12:36] churches was it difficult to be a
[1:12:37] Christian in the military no because had
[1:12:40] the Holy Ghost and I didn't go to all
[1:12:42] the stuff that they went to right I mean
[1:12:44] people all around me drinking and
[1:12:45] carrying on no it wasn't difficult now
[1:12:49] if I was doing it in my own self well
[1:12:52] that might be difficult but God was
[1:12:54] watching after me
[1:12:57] how did Brother Ram teach his sons to
[1:12:58] treat his daughters I don't have any
[1:13:01] idea I would assume with dignity you
[1:13:04] know there was there was order you
[1:13:07] know what miracles did you see
[1:13:11] happen well the fact that he accepted me
[1:13:14] that was the big
[1:13:16] smle well see there was other guys that
[1:13:19] knew who he was and they were scared
[1:13:22] they they wanted to jump and ask but
[1:13:24] they were scared
[1:13:27] scared well I'll give you a clue one of
[1:13:29] them was our friend down here in
[1:13:31] Dayton yeah Big
[1:13:34] Mike he was probably a good-looking guy
[1:13:36] at one
[1:13:40] time but
[1:13:42] um What attracted Rebecca well here's a
[1:13:45] guy that daddy likes and he's not one of
[1:13:49] these clowns that you know just want the
[1:13:52] girl and and so yeah he accepted me that
[1:13:56] was the biggest Miracle that's the only
[1:13:58] thing I ever saw happen so those are the
[1:14:01] questions uh are there any other
[1:14:02] questions that you're not brave enough
[1:14:04] to write
[1:14:07] down what about it
[1:14:11] Chris okay well yes sir what's your
[1:14:14] question
[1:14:17] about the what
[1:14:25] the rure yeah there'll be a there'll be
[1:14:27] a period of time we read it this morning
[1:14:29] he said that there'll be a Sweep come
[1:14:31] over the people and we'll be with the
[1:14:35] resurrected
[1:14:36] Saints month or so and then the Rapture
[1:14:41] so it's it's just like it was in the
[1:14:43] book of Acts you know it was about a
[1:14:45] month or so that they were together
[1:14:46] before they left so yeah it's part of it
[1:14:49] and I don't know which 30 days they are
[1:14:52] but it's getting very close because
[1:14:54] there's too many signs to say well it's
[1:14:56] way off no it's not way off and when
[1:14:59] Paul preached he preached it in a way
[1:15:00] that people would stay ready but he had
[1:15:03] to know somewhere in his head that this
[1:15:05] it's going to be a while but he preached
[1:15:07] it in a way stay ready see if you if you
[1:15:10] knew if brother R had told you yeah
[1:15:12] it'll be in U you know
[1:15:14] 2035 you wouldn't stay ready you'd run
[1:15:17] up your credit cards you'd just just
[1:15:19] flop
[1:15:21] around yeah we're
[1:15:23] humans so we got to stay ready right
[1:15:28] might happen before the Sun up we don't
[1:15:30] know things are just very hot right now
[1:15:33] the world's about ready to fall
[1:15:35] apart and so um we do
[1:15:38] have the signs of the times and the big
[1:15:44] thing is don't worry about the future
[1:15:46] just get yourself ready for the
[1:15:49] resurrection that's that's the next
[1:15:52] thing on the
[1:15:53] calendar then the rest
[1:15:56] so get ready pay attention to the
[1:15:58] ministry that God has given you
[1:15:59] everybody doesn't have a good pastor
[1:16:01] like you have okay no this is one one of
[1:16:04] very few so pay attention to what God is
[1:16:06] telling you every
[1:16:08] day and do what you know to be ready for
[1:16:13] the
[1:16:14] resurrection in the meantime yes brother
[1:16:27] oh before he left yeah I realized who he
[1:16:30] was cuz it's once you see it in
[1:16:33] scripture no problem so we can testify
[1:16:37] yeah God sent a prophet okay next thing
[1:16:40] what do he say well then we got to be
[1:16:42] able to tell them you know of course we
[1:16:43] have tapes on the cell phones and
[1:16:45] everything else but uh yes I I realized
[1:16:48] who he was before he left yeah
[1:16:55] anything
[1:16:56] else yes
[1:16:58] sir no Budd from 40 years ago
[1:17:47] okay what the brother's saying is that
[1:17:50] we have where brother Ram says that he's
[1:17:52] dedicating his son and May you be a
[1:17:55] prophet okay but he also said that 99%
[1:17:59] of the people don't AR not brave enough
[1:18:01] to repeat there's my daughter Rebecca
[1:18:05] spiritual and someday she'll take my
[1:18:08] place how come we left that
[1:18:11] out and what do I think about it well I
[1:18:14] think he knew what he was talking about
[1:18:16] and uh she was a lady that um didn't try
[1:18:21] to take over she knew her place and in
[1:18:24] her writings and that's why I want to
[1:18:26] publish this she showed us another view
[1:18:29] of William Bram she wasn't going to take
[1:18:32] over and preach I was sitting in a
[1:18:34] church several years
[1:18:37] ago and the brother came across that
[1:18:39] part he said I don't know about you all
[1:18:41] but I don't believe in no woman preacher
[1:18:43] that's not what he
[1:18:45] said okay that she would take his place
[1:18:49] that she would be a a pillar a blessing
[1:18:53] we have women in the Bible but see we're
[1:18:55] so we're so um uh I don't know what the
[1:18:59] word is uh but we only talk about the
[1:19:02] man in the Bible I've got a message
[1:19:05] Jesus and three women he loved the women
[1:19:07] in the Bible he took them by the hand he
[1:19:09] helped them women none of you would be
[1:19:12] here without your
[1:19:14] mother just face that start
[1:19:18] with and women are vital in the in the
[1:19:21] scriptures so she had a place and she
[1:19:25] helped us see another view of William
[1:19:28] brandom that the messages don't show you
[1:19:30] right you know so yeah she was very very
[1:19:34] important but not taking over in the way
[1:19:37] you might think okay and now they're
[1:19:41] together so this brother had a dream the
[1:19:44] same brother was telling about this
[1:19:45] morning so he's in heaven and he's
[1:19:49] talking to brother Brandon about current
[1:19:51] things down here and so
[1:19:55] um he
[1:19:56] uh you know he's telling him what's down
[1:20:00] here and and he said now brother R now
[1:20:02] down there where I come from a lot of
[1:20:04] people say you got to come back and do
[1:20:05] all these things brother R got real
[1:20:07] serious and said look I've said
[1:20:09] everything I had to
[1:20:11] say but if I was to come back you know
[1:20:14] the way they got it figured out I would
[1:20:16] have have to take a few people to the
[1:20:19] Woodshed all you old people know what
[1:20:21] that means that means we're going to go
[1:20:23] out there I'm going to beat the fire out
[1:20:24] of you and when you quit through crying
[1:20:26] then you can come back you know and he
[1:20:29] said and I would have to start with my
[1:20:30] two sons so just that's what the dream
[1:20:33] was so he they're talking and then he
[1:20:36] notices that there's a young girl on
[1:20:38] brother Ram's arm and he looks at her oh
[1:20:41] that's young Rebecca so she gives him a
[1:20:43] big smile and uh and she says tell
[1:20:48] George I'm right there where he told me
[1:20:49] to wait for him so it's
[1:20:52] real yeah
[1:20:55] the end this okay see he would have
[1:20:58] never asked you that
[1:21:00] question okay what
[1:21:04] else I know you guys don't know it
[1:21:09] all
[1:21:13] yes I have no idea it looks
[1:21:17] unlikely see we just saw a big fire out
[1:21:21] there right and now the rain's come now
[1:21:24] it's all going to wash down it's a big
[1:21:28] mess and it's
[1:21:30] ungodly and brother BR says it's 3 to
[1:21:34] 400 miles wide 12200 miles long that's a
[1:21:38] big chunk right it breaks off and the
[1:21:41] waves that that causes yes around the
[1:21:44] planet forget Florida forget England
[1:21:47] it's going to be
[1:21:48] disastrous that very occasion could be
[1:21:52] the time that the bride disappears I
[1:21:53] don't know
[1:21:55] Stay Ready could be
[1:21:58] tonight you have no you have no
[1:22:00] guarantee of getting to your pillow
[1:22:01] tonight true so stay
[1:22:05] ready what
[1:22:10] else what about a Smith
[1:22:27] idolatry idolizing either him or his
[1:22:32] message because people are idolizing the
[1:22:34] words oh it says right here and then
[1:22:36] they fight with the other guy that says
[1:22:38] over here it's not God's plan you know
[1:22:41] so there's a lot of idolatry yes it's
[1:22:43] not all in the Catholic
[1:22:50] church so we're on the same page
[1:22:55] so that's about all I have I just want
[1:22:56] to be sure that you understood the
[1:22:59] questions and the answers and you
[1:23:01] understood the five comings of Elijah
[1:23:03] very
[1:23:05] important um might even put out track to
[1:23:07] that effect who knows but people have to
[1:23:10] understand that what we have is not
[1:23:13] somebody's idea right the people in Salt
[1:23:17] Lake that's an idea all these others the
[1:23:21] big church right down here what is that
[1:23:23] Catholic what is that big one right down
[1:23:24] there on the left
[1:23:27] side
[1:23:30] yeah well see there was only one
[1:23:31] Catholic Church to start with one but
[1:23:34] then in 1541 they had a disagreement so
[1:23:37] you got you got Constantinople the Greek
[1:23:40] church and you got Rome the western
[1:23:42] church but it's all Catholic but um we
[1:23:46] uh we follow the scripture that's the
[1:23:48] whole beauty of this whole thing it's
[1:23:51] Bible it's not William bram's ideas he's
[1:23:55] not a prophet because he promoted it or
[1:23:57] I said so the scripture says Elijah
[1:23:59] shall come right so if you don't like go
[1:24:01] find him it's
[1:24:04] simple
[1:24:14] amen you tell them what I was trying to
[1:24:16] say
[1:24:18] [Applause]
[1:24:27] brother Nathaniel no
[1:24:29] questions I don't I don't believe it I
[1:24:32] don't believe it I don't believe
[1:24:35] it no amen how many enjoyed
[1:24:43] that
[1:24:46] um also there um the things I asked of
[1:24:50] uh for brother George we were talking
[1:24:53] we've talked quite often and um when
[1:24:57] he's been here with some things that um
[1:25:01] it seems like every time that he's it's
[1:25:03] not just when he's been here I'm sure
[1:25:04] it's when whether he's with me or not
[1:25:06] but seems like he's always answering
[1:25:08] questions and emails regarding the
[1:25:12] church age book and he's around the
[1:25:14] world and um those are some things that
[1:25:18] um uh you know when you you get to look
[1:25:21] at it it's just it's incredible of how
[1:25:24] that
[1:25:25] you know when you when you you go
[1:25:26] through it and you're reading through it
[1:25:28] to me I think brother George what he was
[1:25:29] coming around to is that when he had to
[1:25:32] actually determined there's no way to
[1:25:37] translate and when he first started 900
[1:25:39] and some messages that's all there was
[1:25:41] at the time and then they found now
[1:25:43] there's
[1:25:45] 1,5 but you had to select how many of
[1:25:48] you have heard of the seed libraries and
[1:25:51] how do we select to where that you get a
[1:25:53] picture of them
[1:25:55] message because you know there's
[1:25:58] multiple messages and there's certain
[1:26:00] you know every message like the message
[1:26:02] why or sometimes it's titled bomb and
[1:26:04] Gilead depending on the congregation
[1:26:06] because the needs will always shift as a
[1:26:08] minister you know that it it'll shift
[1:26:10] you can preach the same thing as far as
[1:26:12] a text but God will take it based on the
[1:26:14] needs of wherever you're preaching it
[1:26:17] and so when you look at trying to get a
[1:26:19] full picture you know instead of
[1:26:21] translating every message titled why or
[1:26:25] bomal and Gilead which would be about 12
[1:26:28] messages there's one that's selected out
[1:26:30] of that and then you get into really the
[1:26:32] heart of the message all of it is
[1:26:34] important but you're trying to get a
[1:26:36] picture for them overseas so they can
[1:26:38] get everything interpreted in those
[1:26:40] other places and that's the same and so
[1:26:42] when you look that's where one of the
[1:26:44] things that it's like what I told the
[1:26:46] young people here over the years and
[1:26:48] things like that and I've told others is
[1:26:49] that I said this right here with a
[1:26:51] church age book to me this is like a a
[1:26:53] can of of juice
[1:26:56] concentrate you have to take like that
[1:26:58] you know that orange juice that you had
[1:27:00] to put in a in a in a thing of water and
[1:27:01] you had to put it down in there and you
[1:27:03] got to Stir It Up it's it's concentrated
[1:27:06] and this is one of the these are one of
[1:27:07] the things like the prophet could say I
[1:27:09] put my Doctrine in here and it's just
[1:27:11] it's laid in thick and so those are
[1:27:13] things that you know when we come
[1:27:15] through it and it's true like when
[1:27:16] brother George said I I don't think I
[1:27:18] would hand this to someone brand new in
[1:27:20] witnessing to them this
[1:27:28] see it says right here in the front page
[1:27:30] this is from uh trying to do God his
[1:27:35] service you've all seen my
[1:27:37] book it'll be um it'll be drawn out the
[1:27:41] seven Church Ages which he told me which
[1:27:44] I stand by as a witness to God to be
[1:27:49] judged that had judgment for it it comes
[1:27:52] from God not from my thinking
[1:27:56] [Applause]
[1:28:01] yeah yeah I love that and I what I I
[1:28:04] liked also is that brother George they
[1:28:06] he brought that out the the resume which
[1:28:08] is in the back of it that's a real good
[1:28:10] witnessing tool right there because you
[1:28:12] can just hand it and it's it's the last
[1:28:14] part in there but it's a real synopsis
[1:28:16] gives the overview of really what's
[1:28:19] taking place down Through the Ages
[1:28:20] because there's a there's I tell you
[1:28:22] what we're still here so there's lives
[1:28:24] and hearts to be one to the Lord and I
[1:28:26] certainly believe that not only like as
[1:28:28] the prophet said that that soul that
[1:28:30] last one their names splashing beneath
[1:28:32] the bleach but I believe it might be
[1:28:35] rapid work but God's going to bring
[1:28:36] everyone to a full adoption that's the
[1:28:39] full working from the new birth to the
[1:28:41] adoption so we just we thank God for
[1:28:44] that and also with the Christian uh the
[1:28:46] baptism this track this is really it's
[1:28:48] really good how this is uh laid out here
[1:28:50] and I don't know how many ever seen this
[1:28:52] before
[1:28:54] okay so there's some things that I don't
[1:28:56] know that if U you know even with the
[1:28:58] the seal uh the seals book here then
[1:29:01] Spanish and I know the the church age
[1:29:03] book in Spanish brother I have some back
[1:29:06] there when brother George had sent them
[1:29:07] up here from before and the reason I
[1:29:11] haven't just laid these out on the Shelf
[1:29:13] now this right here if there's one book
[1:29:15] that I could put in everybody's hand
[1:29:17] it'd be this book right here the
[1:29:19] exposition of the seven Church ages and
[1:29:22] but you know the only reason haven't put
[1:29:24] all these on the Shelf cuz sometimes and
[1:29:26] I'm not call nobody's name because some
[1:29:29] people some individuals if we went and
[1:29:32] looked at their house they probably got
[1:29:34] more in their house than brother George
[1:29:35] has in the
[1:29:36] warehouse because they just keep on
[1:29:38] taking the same book just take one and
[1:29:40] read it and then and then you know just
[1:29:43] so but if I tell you what even with all
[1:29:46] this right here if um these we can I
[1:29:49] I'll let them set out here nobody take
[1:29:52] them sample sample only brother
[1:29:55] Nathaniel is going to watch over
[1:29:59] it he can take care of himself I know
[1:30:01] that so but you know if there's some
[1:30:04] things that maybe even to you know in
[1:30:06] putting together in order if some of you
[1:30:08] want because this is the way this is
[1:30:10] laid out I've got an actual leather
[1:30:12] bound copy of this um and the way that
[1:30:16] it is laid out I know what brother
[1:30:18] George I've actually got one of those
[1:30:20] original um blue hardbound books but it
[1:30:24] looked like it's been baptized in
[1:30:26] highlighter so you know you can only
[1:30:29] highlight the highlighted so much and so
[1:30:33] with this one I I like the leatherbound
[1:30:35] copy but I can't write in it but this
[1:30:37] one I can write in so that's just me I
[1:30:40] mean you know but if if if uh maybe
[1:30:42] there's some things I don't know we can
[1:30:44] you know as a church maybe it you know
[1:30:46] maybe for brother Nathaniel myself if we
[1:30:48] want to make an order together uh we can
[1:30:50] have that out there for you uh because
[1:30:52] it's it's a real blessing even how the
[1:30:54] seal book is is laid out so um maybe to
[1:30:58] put those out there brother Nathaniel do
[1:30:59] you mind if I would you mind putting
[1:31:01] these out there on the
[1:31:03] table make sure he don't walk without
[1:31:06] make sure
[1:31:08] he I think I can trust
[1:31:11] him yeah amen amen so appreciate so
[1:31:15] appreciate brother Nathaniel amen we've
[1:31:18] he and I really had some good good
[1:31:21] Fellowship here and uh we just so
[1:31:23] appreciate amen I just appreciate the
[1:31:25] fellowship between the churches amen I I
[1:31:28] so appreciate that God is so good isn't
[1:31:30] he yes he is amen and you know that's
[1:31:32] that's the reality that you know when we
[1:31:35] look at the what the message of the hour
[1:31:37] what it what it come to do is it come to
[1:31:39] reveal Jesus Christ and I love how
[1:31:42] brother George like when he said that
[1:31:44] that you know this is not the message
[1:31:46] when we talk about getting in the Bible
[1:31:49] we're not we're not here to try to
[1:31:51] somehow prove whether or not what
[1:31:54] brother Braham said was the truth it's
[1:31:56] actually then getting in the in the vein
[1:31:59] of the thought that God spoke it through
[1:32:02] his prophet and then this is where the
[1:32:04] Bible becomes a new book and it just you
[1:32:07] know this message the more the more that
[1:32:10] I'm in it the more I fallen in love with
[1:32:11] the Bible and you just and you're just
[1:32:13] seeing it and you know as you're reading
[1:32:15] it how many can testify this you're
[1:32:16] reading it and all of a sudden it comes
[1:32:18] back to me of a statement brother br's
[1:32:20] made so I just write it right in the
[1:32:21] Bible right there you know so I've got
[1:32:23] it right there and now I do that I just
[1:32:25] write in my Bible you know I I but I I
[1:32:29] just so appreciate the message of the
[1:32:31] hour because that's what it did it
[1:32:32] brought us back to a real Bible Faith

[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:47] you amen I come and ask brother
[1:43:51] Nathaniel if you close us out in prayer
[1:43:52] and
[1:43:53] I thought it was so wonderful here
[1:43:55] tonight just to be able to gather
[1:43:57] together and I just appreciated the the
[1:44:00] time of questions and answers here and
[1:44:02] brother George taken the time to be with
[1:44:04] us and and to do this tonight and uh you
[1:44:07] know I
[1:44:08] just I love that that question where
[1:44:12] just spoke very simple short little
[1:44:13] question but
[1:44:15] said you know any advice about one
[1:44:19] Desiring the Holy Ghost you know the
[1:44:22] first thing the prophet
[1:44:23] said he said for you to even desire it
[1:44:26] you're
[1:44:28] blessed he said now that don't mean you
[1:44:30] have it but it means the holy spirit is
[1:44:32] up on your life that's raising that
[1:44:36] desire and then to hear of the
[1:44:39] response is very true is brother Bron
[1:44:42] said when you go to hunger and he said
[1:44:43] God can give it to you right now you see
[1:44:46] it's God that creates that hunger it's
[1:44:47] not us it's God it's God actually
[1:44:51] pulling upon that attribute
[1:44:54] that he placed within us his presence
[1:44:56] draws near it's like a magnet getting
[1:44:58] close to something he begins to feel
[1:45:00] that
[1:45:00] pool and I love how that was even placed
[1:45:03] here tonight because we we see the
[1:45:05] urgency we see the hour we know that's
[1:45:08] the necessity the token but let me just
[1:45:10] say this to
[1:45:13] you God doesn't want you to be anxious
[1:45:17] about
[1:45:20] anything the very thing is is as brother
[1:45:23] George plac that there tonight is
[1:45:25] praying and reading the word of God and
[1:45:29] the only thing that you look for is not
[1:45:31] a
[1:45:33] feeling brother BR says you you may not
[1:45:36] feel anything you may not shout he goes
[1:45:38] through a whole list of things but
[1:45:40] there's one thing about it is you'll
[1:45:43] know your life has been
[1:45:46] changed so it's him he's the one we're
[1:45:48] looking for amen do you love him tonight
[1:45:53] see just you you can't you just you
[1:45:54] sense his presence and you just sense
[1:45:56] how he just comes in that way what it
[1:45:58] does is it the spirit of God just
[1:46:00] dispels all anxiousness because when he
[1:46:04] comes into view it it dismisses
[1:46:07] fear remember Elisha was there and and
[1:46:10] Gia was all tore up and Elisha said Lord
[1:46:13] open his eyes and the prophet said God
[1:46:16] didn't bring down the Angels they were
[1:46:19] already
[1:46:20] there and that's what God did in this
[1:46:23] end time God loosened the seeing that we
[1:46:27] might see the god that always was is
[1:46:30] right here among us
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:35] hallelujah praise the Lord amen God
[1:46:38] bless
[1:46:44] you don't you appreciate how brother
[1:46:46] georgees has a way of dispensing with
[1:46:50] formalities you know we in America Amica
[1:46:53] we're a little too formal
[1:46:55] sometimes sometimes we need to just cut
[1:46:57] to the Chase and sometimes if we'll do
[1:46:59] that with God we'll get a lot farther
[1:47:02] than all the things that we've been
[1:47:03] trying to do you know brother brand
[1:47:06] tells a little story which I appreciate
[1:47:07] very much there was a woman that came to
[1:47:10] him and said brother brandham I don't
[1:47:11] remember all the details but something
[1:47:13] to the effect of you know brother
[1:47:15] brandham i' I've done this and I'm
[1:47:16] backslid and I I want to come back to
[1:47:18] God he said do you really want to come
[1:47:21] back and she said he said yeah I really
[1:47:23] want to come back he said okay you're
[1:47:26] back you know we want we want there to
[1:47:28] be lightning and we want there to be a
[1:47:30] feeling and a sensation but if you take
[1:47:32] God at his word
[1:47:34] Saints truly Saints in America we are so
[1:47:37] caught up in formalities that God we
[1:47:40] spend sometimes an entire service trying
[1:47:43] to get through formalities is that true
[1:47:45] brother
[1:47:46] Samuel we come in and we come in all
[1:47:49] formal but Saints we take ourselves too
[1:47:52] serious
[1:47:53] seriously let us take god seriously let
[1:47:56] us lay down our pride and say Lord Jesus
[1:47:58] I don't want anything but you I'm so
[1:48:01] tired of this person I'm so tired of
[1:48:03] fighting with this
[1:48:05] person so Saints as we have heard the
[1:48:08] the wonderful encouragements that we've
[1:48:10] had tonight we're going to close in a
[1:48:12] word of
[1:48:13] prayer does anyone believe that the holy
[1:48:16] spirit is here tonight amen he told us
[1:48:18] where two or three are gathered I will
[1:48:20] be there also is that right you say well
[1:48:23] brother I don't feel anything we didn't
[1:48:24] look we didn't ask that God didn't ask
[1:48:26] that he said I will be where two or
[1:48:30] three are gathered that means he has to
[1:48:31] be here tonight is that
[1:48:33] right so if you want something from God
[1:48:36] if you want the baptism of the Holy
[1:48:38] Ghost tonight we're going to pray to
[1:48:40] close amen and all you have to do is
[1:48:43] raise your hand and say Lord hallah I'm
[1:48:45] tired of me I want you just accept it
[1:48:50] it's that simple Saints we are the ones
[1:48:52] it over complicated just take God at his
[1:48:55] word he said you do what I told you to
[1:48:57] do I'll do the rest God will confirm his
[1:49:01] word so now we're going to pray together
[1:49:04] you have something in your heart raise
[1:49:05] your hand make it know we're going to
[1:49:08] Bow our heads and let's pray
[1:49:10] together Heavenly Father Lord we've been
[1:49:13] too formal many times Lord we take
[1:49:16] ourselves way too
[1:49:18] seriously Lord we look at our own
[1:49:21] drama we're so caught up in our own
[1:49:25] ideas I I I I I but Lord if we by your
[1:49:30] grace can turn our attention to
[1:49:34] you you can make the
[1:49:36] difference Lord maybe we've been
[1:49:38] struggling maybe we've been looking for
[1:49:40] some process some
[1:49:42] formality to have it experienced with
[1:49:44] you but Lord tonight I pray Lord that
[1:49:48] it's just that simple in our hearts like

[1:50:07] author you're the beginning you're the
[1:50:08] end of our faith Lord I may not

[1:50:13] believe but I just know your word is
[1:50:17] true Lord Jesus I pray that we go
[1:50:19] forward not on feelings but the
[1:50:22] confidence that you never lie that your
[1:50:24] word is always true as we go from this
[1:50:27] place tonight I pray Lord that each one
[1:50:29] that has raised their hand Lord I pray
[1:50:32] that there's something that settles in
[1:50:33] our heart we're not looking for an
[1:50:35] outward sensation but a confidence that
[1:50:39] your word never fails and it will not
[1:50:43] return to you
[1:50:44] void God upon your word we go forward
[1:50:47] upon your word Lord we ask tonight for
[1:50:50] all the those that receive prayer may
[1:50:52] you continue not just tonight not we
[1:50:55] know that they're already healed but
[1:50:56] Lord encourage their faith when they're
[1:50:58] at home when they're feeling discourage
