coming up just got to looking around in my beds and i can see where there's things coming up right now just some of the hostas and different things and i'm looking at it you're talking about a refreshment that they receive from the rain and the light [Music] that's that's only an expression as the children of god we receive our our nourishment our strength from the lord oh he's our strength and then all that is he shines upon us is life spirit of god just moving down upon our lives or we just want to draw from that let's just let this be a request this morning or this evening as we prepare to look into the word of the lord amen oh [Music] fill our home oh yes lord jesus oh let's just let that be a real request and as we [Music] as we pray we pray to you [Music] one more time oh

for true as your word is that you've given to us where two or three gather together in your name you said you'd be in the midst of us and you dwell in the praises of your people lord we love you lord jesus lord this is our desire lord hear this evening lord though we've come to this service lord a set time on a set day but god we believe that this time has been prearranged before the foundation of the world so you already knew even needs that would exist right now you would sing all things lord through your omniscience lord knowing all things oh god your present lord you're present here to move and to speak to our hearts lord we want to as we looked at on sunday we want to do our business lord that which you would speak to us we know there's no greater thing that we can do lord is to believe and to act upon the word that's that's faith and father that invites you to do your business we just invite you lord that you'll come lord take the speaker and hear it together lord you know the words lord lord and what needs to be spoken lord we just reserve ourselves to you ask the lord that you would forgive us lord of our sins lord forgive us lord of our shortcomings lord we stand o god in need of you father lord jesus you're the only one that can take a service like this lord even as we look lord upon the word of god it takes you to come lord and bring it and really tailor it to our lives lord speak to us now we pray father jesus precious amen amen amen god bless you thank you musicians let's turn in the scriptures if you would with me to second kings chapter three i want to remind you this coming sunday lord willing brother carmen mills will be here with us ministering then we have baptismal service brother richard that's still on correct sister sister judith is going to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and she was already baptized before but just really feeling pressed to to do that again and certainly you know just how the lord is dealing with her heart so we always encourage that if there's any how god's dealing with your heart don't let anything stand in your way so we just we thank god for that so and right after the the ministering of the word on sunday morning we'll have that baptismal service and then we also have the communion service we will announce that time following the morning service i don't anticipate that being too far apart there because i have to get brother carmen over to the airport to fly out on sunday at a good time anyhow so we just be in prayer for that let's be in prayer for the service that god will just just move among us in a special way just know that as i said before you really enjoy brother carmen his ministry i know uh i think paul was the one who was there in youth camp for four days and where the carmen just said brother bill you interpreted for him didn't you yeah i think you did he and brother ivan is in costa rica yes brother ivan carr so that's his father-in-law yeah so he was there that's called some timers yeah i tell you i'm only 46 and i get some timers it's it's not a good thing at all but so he always asks about you but it does so second kings chapter three we want to just read a few verses of scripture and then we'll let you have your seats verse six second kings three and king joram went out of samaria the same time and numbered all israel and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the king of moab hath rebelled against me will thou go with me against moab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my people as thy people and my horses as thy horses and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way through the wilderness of edom so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them and the king of israel said alas that the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab but joshua jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may inquire of the lord by him one of the king of israel's servants answered and said here is elisha the son of shafat which poured water on the hands of elijah and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother the king of israel said unto him nay for the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him i'd just like to speak just for a few moments on inquiring of the lord may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated they'd say that there's not one of us when we among us that maybe you have things on your heart tonight no doubt things that you're considering things that maybe you're in the midst of and even at times we can reflect back that there's always something that we are seeking the will of the lord about and i always think of how the scripture has told us sometimes when we look at things and how god spoke in isaiah 55 and it's very clear to draw our attention to it that there's a difference in god's thoughts in our thoughts there's a great difference in the way that we think about things and the way god thinks about things and this is why that there is an absolute need for the mind of christ which is the new birth the holy ghost in the life of the believer so that it becomes a an anchor it becomes the influence of our life remember the scripture says regarding our heart that the heart is deceitful above all things and i the lord do search it but after that life has been filled with the spirit of god then that heart becomes under the influence of the holy ghost doesn't mean that our emotions and our feelings and things that we have sometimes can't be drawn in a certain way because remember the lord jesus was a man subject to like passions he was tempted in every way even when they came to him regarding lazarus remember how the test came it came to touch him in his human emotions and say lazarus the one whom thou lovest he's dead see trying to pull him to operate first in that realm now we need every realm god has made it so that the five senses we have that's given to contact our earthly home the five spiritual senses all of those are necessary we see how the spirit of god will use them like for reasoning for example brother branham will always tell us that reasoning as long as it's with the word of god then it's of god but if it's against the word he says then that's your enemy and you'll be against that then he would also see how that god would take the prophet in this hour and tap into that realm of our imagination he would have us in talking about blind bartimaeus we would be in that cool october morning right before the walls of jericho so all of those gates and how all of that would be used and but yet god never intended that man would operate by his natural senses or those five spiritual senses but that man would operate by faith in god alone and so that's god's desire and notice that within that of seeking the will of god it comes down to two two things as we look at it in our lives faith and patience these are two necessary elements and they go hand in hand because you really can't have patience unless you have faith remember as god has brought when god brings a life and into expression if you think about even the statue of a perfect man one of the virtues within there is patience and it's a patience to know that what god has said god will perform i don't know how i don't know when but god will do it that doesn't become less with our walk with god but think how brother branham puts it in is your life worthy of the gospel and i don't know i wasn't there and didn't see him how he put it but let me just play up on words for a minute he says your patience starts up about like this but then he says you find that it grows to this out here and so we find that in our lives and perhaps tonight you can say lord uh i need my patience to grow awful i need it to grow more and we all need growth in our life and we find that none of these things patients it is not something that we're handed growth as though here take this and you grow you know five inches in patience no every one of those virtues in our life they grow through the tests and trials because tests and trials are things that come to help us uh a release ourself of this humanity that we're trapped in even paul himself could acknowledge that god gave him divine assistance because without divine assistance paul could say my pride could get beside itself of concerning the things that god has let me see but god in his infinite wisdom and mercy he will allow things to come up paul's eyesight would come and go because that so paul's pride would not rise into a place to where god couldn't use him i think that's something that we can say lord i need divine assistance i need your strength lord even sometimes when things come our way and we feel like we're blindsided and why did this come about this way and sometimes we're looking because we're prone maybe in our makeup some of us more than others we're prone to try to put things in place to avoid problems because nobody likes dealing with problems and we're prone to try to do that depending on our makeup but you see we cannot we're not meant to live to where that our lives are going to be problem free as a matter of fact in our lives we understand that as believers we're either in a test trial we're coming to one or we're coming out of one it's a continual process but that's all part of character molding and what melds the character is not the tester trial it's the life on the inside that molds the character as we surrender to him and say lord not my mind but your mind in this lord i don't understand i don't know what's going on but like brother brahms said just give me the grace to go through it lord give me strength to go through it let me conduct myself with joy drawing from that strength of that life on the inside with you so faith and patience are absolutely the necessary parts when we're seeking the will of god because it requires complete reliance upon the lord faith is is that whatever he says that's what i'm going to do i i'm not going to i'm not going to count it to my reasoning i'm just looking to you lord just help me to be sensitive and patience because god doesn't always speak when we're down on our knees or laying prostrate or the moment we're in prayer or we come out of prayer or the next day or the next hour sometimes what we're praying about we don't get an immediate answer we have to wait and god answers in his own time and in his own way jehoshaphat when we look at this inquiring of the lord jehoshaphat let me just refer to it in looking in this manner you you can look at with with him and this is very similar to an occurrence that jehoshaphat had with ahab which is joram's dad ahab jehoshaphat did the same thing there they have presented a situation hey ramos gilead belongs to us we're brothers you know we're oh we're all israelites and and jehoshaphat does the same thing there that he does right here let's go on up and let's go on up and take it and yet when you look at jehoshaphat i want us to look at this very closely because with jehoshaphat brother adam when you look at how brother branham will describe jehoshaphat these are the things that brother brown will say about him he's a righteous man who loved the lord a wonderful man a god-fearing man a believer a man of god a spiritual man a mighty man god was with him these are all of the descriptions or accolades that that that the spirit of god even through the prophet would would express and what he's seeing is here within jehoshaphat's life it wasn't that jehoshaphat was a perfect man but he was the jehoshaphat if you consider elisha in the midst of the company of people who are there elisha said i wouldn't even stand here and look at the rest of you if it wasn't jehoshaphat was here jehoshaphat there was a respect but you know what the respect was it was the same mutual respect that jehoshaphat had for elisha that's when they asked hey when the situation arose it was no one else there that said hey is there not one here that we can consult the lord and ask him what to do but you see when they said elisha's here jehoshaphat said i know him i know that the word of the lord is with him because i know he has the same acquaintance the same god of elijah is there with elisha so i know the word of the lord is with him and so there was an acquaintance that was there there was a respect that was there about jehoshaphat's life and so when i when we look at all of this you know sometimes when we we see this of those things i read to you that brother branham would say concerning jehoshaphat who'd say my what a great man but i want you to catch this because when all of those accolades and those things that are true about our life a god-fearing person a believer one whom god is with a righteous man who loved the lord these are all displayed through his life but through all of that display there's still a target on him as there is on every believer that satan himself is out just he's got traps he has everything else set out around our life so there's no need to step back and say well you know the prophet said i'm a righteous man i love the lord a mighty man and all these other accolades but it's even it's a sign to be even more so in prayer if there ever was a people that should be more in prayer brother brahman said it like this let your prayer life be be be second to nothing this is a living so close to almighty god because as brother branham put it in this way he's asked the question is it possible for a believer to be driven to do minor things or influence to do minor things and brother brahms says absolutely he said because before god got a hold of your life he said you were just slouching around going anywhere doing what you pleased but now you're in the army of the lord god's dealt with your life there's come a surrender in your life there's coming experience in your life there is a target there that the enemy is trying to come against now don't focus on the target because the real answer to all of that is not looking around saying well where's the target where it's like you're studying for landmines if you just focus on the lord every landmine will be uncovered the targets are what the enemy has even things that he's come to shoot at you it doesn't mean the target will be removed but like he told the prophet there's a test coming for you and brother branham didn't know what that test was then god didn't tell him this is how it's going to be in this and that but you see let him know there's going to be a test come and right there in that service here come a test around in that moment and right there the prophet stood there here he was in contact with god and notice when that young couple was making out on the front row notice it was given in his hand speak death it'll be death or speak life showing the presence of almighty god and he says i forgive you for that but don't stay in this meeting and continue to do that you go ahead and leave if you're going to do those things it gave him life it gave forgiveness it was a test that come we don't know the tests or traps as brother branham says we don't know that but we're not to be occupied as though we're walking around oh not in fear but we ought to be careful with every step but being careful that we're directed by god the closer we get to the end of the way that becomes more precious to us to be directed by the things of god and so it comes to that place that we we need in everything to really seek the leadership of the lord in all things no matter how they appear or feel no matter how they appear or they feel i can't really deal with a lot of that tonight but just to think about no matter how they appear or they feel think of how god spoke here in amos chapter 3. it's concerning the children of israel hear this word that the lord has spoken against you old children of israel against the whole family which i brought up from the land of egypt saying you only have i known of all the families of the earth therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities can two walk together except they be agreed now remember god sent prophets early in other words that was god's first priority was to call israel back to the the word by the word of the lord back to the word they had the word but they didn't have the word of the lord you see a people can have the bible and not have the word of the lord because when you have the word of the lord it produces the life of the lord are you hearing me it's not reasoning you now have the very author and the person because it's not to know his word is life it's to know him is that right it's to know him his life and so think of this god brought them out of egypt think of this he he brought them on eagle's wings everything of god such grace that he provided for them but when israel began to go astray and they push back on the word then god let him know you and i are not agreed we can't walk together we're not we don't have the same focus we don't have the same desire and so god himself pulled back from his people and this is a principle are you hearing me now see we're looking at we're seeing the very nature that's the thing that even is missing when you look at within the christian world and that's the very thing that sometimes that people are overlooking even right around the message it's the character the message itself reveals the character and the nature of jesus christ that's why we can have an examination and say i'm in or i'm not in and i need to get in because it's his nature the life in the blood being revealed that exposes where we're at and at the same time can say if you're not here come in it's his nature that's why brother brown could say in the message all things 62 leading up to the opening of the seals he says when the seals are open it will reveal his nature well how can it reveal its nature because the seals themselves is christ coming to the church and being revealed that's why brother brown could say he is those seals he took the seals off of himself he is that seventh seal first second third fourth fifth sixth it's the seventh seal christ himself who was there present revealing and taking the cover off the enemy who is it right here right here tonight that takes the cover off the enemy who is it in our life it's christ himself in bright form that exposes the enemy hallelujah oh glory be to god can two walk together except they be agreed notice ii corinthians 6 paul picks this up be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light but darkness what concord what agreement hath christ with biliary or what part have he that believeth with an infidel now you you and i all of us have to work around individuals come on even in our families is that right and we realize that in our families that you're not to draw yourself off but neither should you be or we be under the influence of those who are not converted are you hearing me now i'm going to win them to the lord who's winning who i said who's winning who because with the the moment that you start lacking back on things of god it shows there's influence coming and pulling you away from the right source how can you win somebody to christ when you're being pulled away from him oh i'm just you know i'm going to love them in i'm going to go visit them on sunday and amen what you are showing them when you do that is i think more of you than i do jesus plain and simple brother bram said how do we win our loved ones by being loyal to what you believe so if you believe that that's okay then you have a problem with your belief because that belief is not scripture the bible said forsake not to assemble yourselves together boy i don't know how we're getting here for satan not to assemble ourselves as the manner of some is brother brandon said when those church doors are open if you've got the love of god in your heart you can't wait for them to open plain and simple so here when we're looking at it associates matters i think of young people think of others all of us associates matter who we associate with you know god can speak right to your life and you get around the wrong people your healing can leave deliverance can leave because why it's spirits this is spiritual warfare brother branham put it very simply like this with jehoshaphat brother brahma said it in this manner he says when you go to join yourself up with an unbeliever he says you start taking on his ways if you don't watch that can happen very easily because there's people at work that know how to cut down the people who are doing the job because they can do it better you know they could tell them how to do it they just come and ask them they could tell me they didn't go to schooling for it but they could tell them and so they spend their time oh you know just right and if you're not careful you can get caught in that now every one of us don't raise your hands every one of us we've got why there's still a part about us we're still in our humanity but they speak to god there's something that rises up there on the inside that says uh-uh you shouldn't have been going along with that it might be true what's being said but don't get in on it is that right there was nothing they could say regarding daniel in the kingdom is that right nothing now i want you to look at that this that just shows us when we see those things that's not to put us down that's to show the living god who's right here among us there is a quickening power here that daniel own daniel knew as it would come to him but he didn't know it by the indwelling power of the holy ghost you or i that's been privileged to enter behind the veil that quickening power is resting in your life the same one that came to daniel gave him strength that brother bram says he began to feel coming up his arm when them lines were coming near that same quickening power rest within a child of god but he says if you don't watch you start taking up their ways and you go off what was one of the ways they didn't even consult the lord jehoshaphat could have asked did you pray about it and frankly within it jehoshaphat could have just looked at it and not even having to ask did you pray about it jehoshaphat if he would have looked beyond what appeared and his feelings because sometimes we can get stuck in that gate of compassion oh we just want to express love we just there was a curse on the house of ahab are you hearing me they were rebellious against the word of the lord i don't know about you but do you want to associate with somebody or one that's cursed come on friends i mean this is why even in the early even in the early church i think it's cyrenthius or whatever they went in the bath house and john and these guys that were you know that were coming right against the message in that time in the early days you know right after pentecost and one or more the one of them ran out of the bath house said i don't even want to be in there this guy's in there because it's sure to fall in just heard brother brandon say it the other day on the tape he said regarding people who stood up against the word he said i don't wouldn't even want to be in the same building just you know the building might come in on them listen what are you saying that i'm saying that sometimes these feelings and things that can be had but it needs to come back to that the word is the ultimate it is the headship the final authority the amen in our life because jehoshaphat didn't even have to pray about is it is it god's will for me to go and get myself yoked together with with your ram on this are you hearing me but see what if eve think about this jehoshaphat could have said yeah yeah okay okay it's all right but if jehoshaphat would have went back and even prayed about it after that moment said you know what i need i need to pray about this i you know i went ahead and committed myself to doing this and doing that we've all been there we committed we promised that oh yeah i'll do that i'll do that i'll but if the lord wills sometimes we've committed ourselves without consulting the lord is that right all of us all of us have been there but what if jehoshaphat would have did something that eve should have done you know you weren't going to stop the enemy from coming through the vessel of the serpent and trying to reason and my everything's appearing just right sounding just right but all eve would have had to do is say you know what this all sounds really good i mean i'm moved emotionally man it just it it even seems right but you know what i want to talk to papa see she didn't sin now brother brahma says when she stopped to listen to entertain it you can hear it but when she if she would have just taken what she heard and not begin to open herself to it and just took it back and said papa this is what's been said i'll tell you first thing when cheetah got away from that anointing of unbelief that atmosphere that comes through that associates already it would have been different she would have been started beginning to approach papa what do you say about this i'll tell you as soon as the way from that atmosphere those things would have started to wake up a little bit is that right that happens to us we can get away and you have my why did i commit to that what in the world did i what in the world did i do so it sounds reasonable sounds reasonable or has people and the person could say that's just common sense like we looked at on sunday god don't make sense to the natural mind he does things and ask us to do things because even the new birth does not make sense to the natural mind is that right it's a mystery but it's not something vague out there you know when it's happened because your life has been changed and there's an amen on the inside of your life it's not what you're trying to do but there's a love affair there's a fountain there's a life that's behind you that's pulsating that's desiring for the will of god so it sounds reasonable many things sound reasonable this is why we must have discernment i want you to listen to a few things that brother abraham said regarding this with jehoshaphat when he speaks about jehoshaphat coming together with jorah i don't have these up there because i'm just going to refer to a couple places he said they had dinner the two of them together and that's what they'd done then under the spell of showing what great things they had as a nation he fell a victim to hooking himself up with an unbeliever do you know paul when i dress in the book of galatians when paul could get among him and he saw that here the people were not resting but they you know oh am i keeping this and am i doing this and paul immediately could tell there's unrest here in their spirit and that's why paul could say who hath bewitched you that you should not trust and believe in the full counsel of god that's why he could say who who did the working of miracles among you by the law or by or by the spirit of faith you see spirits they come we're not we are in a warfare and it's not you can't fight the supernatural with natural you can't fight the enemy with reason he's a pro he'll smoke us all the way from wherever ever he's he's greater than us in reasoning he's greater any of those other senses but there's one thing that is not greater than and that's faith faith defeats him every time faith isn't about that we understand everything but faith says i just trust the lord you ain't moving me off of my ground this is my promise that god has given me but jehoshaphat a believer a righteous man who loved the lord god fearing man mighty man god was with him on and on and on and on but yet when he came to dinner the joram he came under a spell that's why when you leave out of work you leave around different places that's why you have to pray and say god wash me watch me it's spirits it's spirits and you have to look and say god wash me because if not those spirits will want to they want to follow you they want to follow you torment you all and then come right among the family but we have to be mindful as priest of god before a priest could come in god told moses you put a laver at right there when they come in the door and that labor is to have a spigot because it's got to be running water and when they come in they've got to wash their hands and they have to wash their feet why you have to be cleansed to worship our hands are the doings the feet is the goings that's why jesus could say that once a man has been washed talking about his soul he need not save wash but his feet only right we rub shoulders with the world we see things hear things we don't ask to see don't ask to hear but we have a lutron or a labor we have a washing of water by the word we have an access that we can go to god and there can be a cleansing it's spirits jehoshaphat all of these remember don't let that drift from you all the accolades of really what he is but he comes under a spell by starting to associate that's why the greatest thing that you or i can do if there's something that's coming up and you might be something you set down but you realize wait a minute here this ain't going to go no further we're not going no further with this because it can come right under a spell i don't get no who understand a spirit right you get around somebody that's critical look brother ram says very clearly this old it's a hillbilly saying but it's true you can't lay down with a dog that's got fleas and get up and not expect to have he's scratching you'll be why you've been laying with him right just simple things that we can understand notice brother bram in another place notice how easy i want you to catch this it is sometimes on a little persuasion for a christian to get in the wrong company trying to be pity oh how do you all say in spanish with poor business oh they're so pitiful in the south they say oh bless your heart that means you're pitiful just feel sorry for him listen to me that's a trap of the enemy we're not to be hardened that we don't feel sympathy but we're to balance it with the word if our pity is leading us outside the word that's where it stops and wait wait wait wait wait wait it's got to come back into the word that's why it matters who our associates are let me tell you very clearly as soon as god and every one of us in here when god starts dealing with your life and the people that i had contacting me oh my when god began to deal with my life and my life i made a surrender to the lord oh my the people wanting the pressure and all this and that and one more i'm gonna tell you i didn't want to be around them i had no desire to be around them i knew what they talked like i knew what they were i knew those kind of atmospheres and i also know the trick about when they could say well you can come on out here and be with us you know you don't have to do this and that you know you can just drink coke or pepsi or whatever more but something rolls up within me and says but how can two walk together unless they be agreed it matters who you are linked to on facebook it matters who you're linked to on instagram it matters who you fellowship with it matters our life we should see if you are seeking to be a better artist you might say i'm not interested in art but let's just say you were you wouldn't associate with me who has problems drawing a stick figure you'd want somebody who's good at art like brianna you'd want to associate with fam that they they're good in art or somebody who's more trained in it you find out who they are don't you realize because there's things you'll pick up and you'll learn from there it matters who you associate with who man another statement brother brennan may jehoshaphat made that wrong move which is most likely to come to every one of us we make the wrong move it's so easy that sounds like an experience talking there it's so easy to make the wrong move pity under the spell of let me just say it in this way satan uses reasoning and will use sources that can pull upon your heart strings you'll do things that are pulled upon your heartstring because he knows if i can get them out there into an emotional realm you'll do things that pool upon your heart springs you use those things but if it reasons against the word of god it is the enemy behind that source are you hearing me it's not the source is the enemy the serpent wasn't the enemy it was the serpent behind it job discerned and said thou speakest like a foolish woman he was discerning what was coming behind the source that's why we can't go by how things appear or how they feel or this just feels right it just looks right for the same you you that's confusing me it shouldn't it shouldn't that's satan's objective satan dwells in beauty now listen to me not god-given beauty not god-given beauty satan dwells in a beauty that works to try to do things and enhance things and cause things to arouse out of people that should not be are you with me that's why brother brahm could say for our sisters he says it's a god given a privilege it's a god-given it's a characteristic to want to be beautiful but satan wants to take that and try to anoint it cut the hair just you know you're a little pale put a little makeup on or if you just put a little blush on you just do a little bit of this and what's he trying to do you know what he's doing he's speaking against who god has made right there you ought to draw the line and say wait a minute i am fearfully and wonderfully made right there you should draw the line say wait a minute i'm going to consult my maker because you're not the creator you're the perverter see how the word in fellowship with the word you start discerning those things as they want to come in that way satan uses those things to try to pull up on our heartstrings he'll use family to try to pull up on our heartstrings oh mom and dad why don't you just come down for a a cookout we're going to have a wonderful time on sunday oh it's going to be lovely all the family's going to be here we're just going to sit around the campfire and we're just going to what you're doing trying to pull on your heartstrings but see when you can stand on the word and say for saying not to assemble yourselves together this isn't by chance well that's the only day they have off but you see if it was really valuable to them they'd take friday off or saturday off and say you know what we respect you and the gods you serve we'll have it on saturday instead well the fire's just flowing we're just right in it didn't know all this was in here but we'll just preach it now let's let me let's just read a little something here at the prophet and i actually gave this quote i think it's in the prophet elisha brother braham says they went off in such a hurry without even considering god and when they found out the seven days was up well their water supply was cut off they didn't have any water to drink there they was out there with their cattle with their animals with their water supply was cut off and it looks like that it was just about the end for them now that's what we do sometimes we go off on a tantrum that means frustration we just act hastily somewhere and not think about god not pray over it ask the lord whether we should do it or not why well it just makes sense it just this sounds reasonable and we find out that our supply of blessings is cut off then we wonder sometime well i wonder why i can't have no more blessings you don't watch now remember remember all those spiritual accolades that jehoshaphat a righteous man who loved the lord and all those things but there's a target the enemy's after he says you don't watch and you let down in your prayer life you say well i'm a christian let's just bring that up a little bit because a real message believer you're a you're a christian because christian means to be christ-like but somehow we you can get our thoughts like i'm in a message praise god i mean there's nothing can get me man i'm the epitome of discernment i'm like a walking mri i can see it all right there shows uh oh you're not living where you need to be because when you're living when you need to be you realize you're looking up to him right so remember it's not when we see this it's not well i'm a christian that just means there's a target well that's the more sign you should pray more than ever more than ever that's more of a sign now notice notice this next statement here my goodness you could preach a month or sundays out of this quote read the bible every day pray every day you know there's absolutely no excuse we've got it on our phones tablets everywhere everywhere reading plan and whatever more well you know brother simon i just don't feel inspired there's many times i don't feel inspired when i sit down with devotions brother samuel you mean you don't have donuts with angels no not even if the krispy kreme they don't come but it shows sometimes this is where we've got to set this thing down and say you know what this is what you need you may not you might feel like donuts but you need greens today boy are you hearing me sometimes we we we look at this friends i'm talking about we every one of us in here we look at it bill that oh he just ought to flow this is a warfare these outer senses the five spiritual senses isn't it amazing they don't have to tell us how your sweat oh i got to pick up my phone you mean i've got to watch a documentary on youtube oh i just don't i just don't feel like i've got the inspiration for it hello but you see reading getting into the word why reading the bible praying that that feeds a life i never forget brother uh when i was out there in flagstaff i was in brother jim dalton's office there and i was looking at this uh rock that he had right there and the many different memories you know from with brother branham and brother jim told me this this was wrote and it had in quotations the edge he said myself and other ministers asked brother brown because we wanted to have the edge on things you know the ed the cutting edge we wanted to have the edge and he asked for the brain he says you know we want and that's why we as believers we want to be have the edge we want to be ready and he said brother brown what what is it that we can be on the edge brother braham says read read read your bible every day and pray and so brother jim just says that very simple right there read your bible and pray that's the edge on the devil because as we're reading the word oh whether you feel spiritual or not within it praying whether you feel that whole night that moment is your prank remember what's happening you are becoming acquainted with him with his character with his nature because it never changes and there's things that as we're reading in the word of god you're listening to the word of god you'll catch things and say wow that's something what it is you're catching the ways that he moves the way he works his nature his character it's him that you're beholding notice don't make any decisions too harshly or too quickly without first considering god about it ask him shall i do this father ask him is it your will for me to do this then see what the holy spirit will speak to you he might not give you a vision because that maybe is not how he deals with you maybe he deals with you with dreams i don't know there's ways he deals with me but i can't say that every time he's going to deal with me in that particular way but notice he may he might not give you a vision but he will speak in some way to you to let you know if you'll be sincere and ask him this is really what's key not just following an order well i know i should ask him i know i should pray and ask the lord and other things come up and maybe need to sit down with brother samuel just ask him to help me pray and i just but if you're not but if we're not sincere about it then even when god does answer we're not going to catch it but it's to really be sincere what is that faith and patience well samuel i'm talking to so and so my mama said and my daddy said mom and dad are wonderful people i love my mom and dad but i never took their word as the absolute above the leading of the holy spirit are you hearing me wonderful now my dad he was my pastor i could go to him on things as well i never looked at oh that's my daddy i would look at that and we would pray there's things that i had to pray about do i make this move do i go for this master's degree do i put in for this job do i do this and they're just saying certain things and i would just go and say would you help me to pray about this because i don't know what the mind of the lord is in this situation my heart might be pulled this way but i don't know what papa wants i don't know what he would say because i only want to do what he wants me to do never forget a year after i resigned and stepped away from teaching oh my i mean you you know i mean as much as i i love you know with pastors from the lord i loved what i did with the kids i could get to see something from start to finish you know each year and everything was going on and i never forget that here you know i talked to my principal a little bit at a certain time called her getting ready to go into that 2015 year beginning of summertime and she had told me at that time she said since you left she said our math scores have went down i said oh and she said look she said we've got a position here you just name your hours that you want and she said we need these math scores to come up she said all you'll be doing is is coming in and working with math she said you'll have full benefits and everything all that sounded really good now god had been very gracious to me in those last years even that i had taught with test scores and things like that very gracious i began to pray about it because i'll be honest i was pulled i respected my principle why was i pulled because probably like some of you i'm a person that likes helping people and sometimes i've over committed myself thank god for my lovely little wife that's been able to tell me you're over committing i thank god for my help mate remember she don't do it that way but you know what i think about it wait a minute here it's hard to say no you want to help people but i never forget when i began to pray about it and i asked her to pray about it with me and i just could not feel peace about it whatsoever and then when i called up that principal i told her i said donna i said look as much as i want to come back and help you i said i just don't feel i said that i believe that i can do that i said because when i was there i said everything else that i had going on i was in the perfect will of god at that time i said though i could come back and look at things and we could break this down and do that i said but if it's not the will of god it'll be a bigger mess than what you've got there right now because i said it ain't about me it ain't my ingenuity of looking at this curriculum and doing this and doing that and doing anything about that it's about being in the will of god and she said i can respect that she said i understand so there's things that pull at our heartstrings and let me try to just wrap this up here proverbs 3 5 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding if this is a scripture for the refrigerator right here this is one we need to put on the rear view mirror or your backup camera whichever one you use put it there in all thy ways acknowledge him somebody say oh all even those things that seem like i got this no in all thy ways acknowledge him he would be like brother carlos he works with the driver he would be like me going and sitting down and talking with brother drake i know he don't work with drywall and i'm asking brother drake all these questions about drywall and brother carlos is sitting right there and i don't even look at him or ask him i talk right over him that'd be really disrespectful but you see how is it when it comes to things in every aspect of our life because god's just not a drywall man he's a plumber he's a cider he you understand me he is jehovah jireh jehovah shama jehovah he's all things to all needs brother branham makes this statement you know when we look at that and he shall direct our paths ram deals with this part about us seeing the value between natural and supernatural iran likens it when they came here to this place what we read in our text he said you know they came and they approached things in a very natural way instead of in the supernatural and he said sometimes he said that's what's wrong with our services he said we come to service approaching god in a very natural way we haven't prayed about the meeting haven't prayed about it he said even meetings that's coming on you haven't prayed about it you haven't invited anybody to the meeting see it's not when we get here that we get in the spirit are you hearing me i understand thursday nights different times but listen we there there is a preparation we're coming to meet the living god and sometimes look things can become common to us that humanity can come around to where we're just you know it's just like man i'm gonna show up and hit the switch it doesn't work that way it's things that where we need we need to hear from god we need the supernatural to move among us we don't want just a natural service we want god to speak we want god to move we want the holy ghost to have the right of way we want deliverance feelings and healings we want the supernatural notice they were in the natural and jehoshaphat was in the natural with them righteous man who loved the lord god fearing man believer on and on and on and on and on he started getting under the wrong influence all of a sudden jehoshaphat nobody else he's the one that pipes up whoa we need to consult the lord we messed up we shouldn't even we shouldn't even be here in this situation but we need to consult the lord is there somebody that we can get to consult the lord and when they brought elisha the atmosphere still wasn't right so they had to change the atmosphere and sometimes in our life here we are under those spell pity all those things now i'm just going to flip the switch and grant the prayer no you've got to change the atmosphere that's why even when brother branham would speak to us about coming into the house of god early getting out get ourselves in an atmosphere that's why we don't want no moving around any if it's not necessary it's like i've told the sound guys the song leaders don't be moving around in here if it's not necessary if it's stuff if it's a broken microphone we'll preach with another one unless i need batteries then we'll stop everything understand what i'm saying we're not talking i'm not talking about being dogmatic friends but i'm talking about to recognize an atmosphere that there is an atmosphere about our lives when i come to the house of god i don't want to have to be saying man i hope brother william's in a good atmosphere because i need some of that atmosphere to rub off on me no i want to be in the right atmosphere because i don't want to be well 1 minus 1 equals zero no i want to unite my pillar fire with that pillar of fire we want an atmosphere set in this place of the supernatural because when we come here we are consoling the lord there are things we've prayed about things we've been asking god for and seeking god for and god comes here and he answers this is one of the avenues that he uses to answer can i read these scriptures as we close paul said pray always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving first peter 4 7 the end of all things is at hand be you therefore sober that means your right mind is focused and watch unto prayer you see all this right here as we look at it but it all comes down to when we see this consoling the will of the lord because like jehoshaphat we must have the reality that our biggest enemy is ourselves brother never said my biggest enemy is so-and-so he said william branham is my greatest enemy he said he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets in the way you can put your name in it as well your family is no different mine is no different either he said when it's something i feel like i can do about it and when i feel like i can do something about it it just shoves god right out of the picture but when i can get that guy out of the way what's one of the ways we get samuel out of the way what's one of the ways you get drake out of the way dave david shane paul brian go ahead and call anybody's name what's one of the ways we get this guy out of the way is when we submit ourselves to the word and allowing the word to wash us taking in of the word listening to the message of the hour reading our bible praying asking god to reveal himself to us it's becoming acquainted more with him my wife i know her more now she can read me like a book i can read her like a book i know she knows it's a wonderful thing we know one another that's a oneness that didn't come at the altar what happened at the altar only allow for that fellowship to move in a deeper manner and continue to blossom through all the tests and trials of life where we learn one another we know one another that's that's in a very small way of how it is in a great way with christ and his bride we become acquainted with him to where we recognize certain things no no like my wife could tell you sam don't even don't even bake it he won't like it so some of you think i'm picky pray for me [Laughter] i'm not picky i'm just picky about some things but my wife could tell you on certain things [Music] i'm not a big olive guy it might be good to flavor stuff i'm not a big olive guy i pick it out of the rice move them grenades to the side and give them to my wife but she can tell you if you're gonna make give me oh for pastor appreciation oh we're going to give brother samuel a jar of olives she could tell you don't that would not be appreciation that would be an insult [Laughter] but think about that with the lord jesus you see the more closer you are as you're feeding on the message listening to taking it in praying seeking after him you start you recognize him more quickly you start picking up on certain things the discernment our discernment moves deeper and deeper because we're warring against this great enemy let's pray heavenly father inquiring of the lord father there's no doubt lord every one of us right here things that we would have upon our hearts seeking your will about and lord help us to lord draw and to glean from these things tonight realizing that lord the things that even you spoke to us tonight is not something that's just as due to just quickly like the snap of a finger to change us as far as how things will go but lord it opens to us that reality that lord we just we need and we want to live so close to you we don't want to take anything for granted we see that like your prophet put it with jehoshaphat every one of us have been identified right here lord we thank you for your grace and how that you have moved even to correct us maybe lord even here tonight with things that you've moved lord with your sovereign grace to bring correction in our life and give us direction to let us know lord it's a care it's a care it's a nurturing that's taking place may we just lord just continue to yield of our lives to you if there's a life lord i think how brother branham would place it lord in this in this very service lord where he would talk about consulting you and he would speak about if there's a need that arises in your life let's see what the lord will say about it if there's an affliction a time of trouble a cancer let's let's see what the lord will say about it we hear what the doctors we know these things but let's see what papa says about it for the round and lord as he tells us he said i'm a drunkard i'm a harlot i've cursed all my life don't give up let's consult the lord about it right now let's see what he's saying about it brother branham i've tried for six years to be born again of the spirit of god to receive the holy spirit he's never come to me yet well let's try again tonight and see what the lord will say because he's always willing if we'll just get everything out of the way lord jesus help us lord we realize this if we lord can say this and really realize [Music] we can say this lord that our own self is our biggest enemy but lord sometimes i really don't think we believe it and i include myself in that boy me me too [Music] help us lord because lord as we can live close to you our lives there's a maturing and we become lord even more acquainted with your nature your character your work through that intimate fellowship then lord god we find in our lives we see our weaknesses when moses was in your presence before that time oh he knew about things in his life but lord in that time his weaknesses was exposed lord i believe that god that as we as believers live in the presence of god or feasting feeding on the word of god help us lord all throughout this assembly those are streaming those are archived or god if they've not been giving themselves to feed on the word and to pray [Music] lord jesus may they see the value in may they see the value of the atmosphere when we come in here to the house of god the atmosphere lord that it's with a supernatural lord god where we are looking and we are praying it don't matter if we're on our way from work on thursday night if we can just pray in the car and say lord jesus come down tonight lord come speak lord to our hearts lord god forgive me in my thoughts or cleanse me lord from the day lord god i'm going to the house of god i want to join my lick of fire with the rest lord i want their lord to be a real moving of the supernatural i've got needs i've got things the lord that need to be spoken to in my life things that i've prayed about things lord that's on my heart lord father i know not only me but every one of your children but god how do we know that just that atmosphere as it's joined together it creates such a bank of faith that there might be a life that's in here that is being tormented to where the enemy has been wanting to assail and come against him as though that there's no hope for him there's no chance for him you don't understand this but there can be an atmosphere of the supernatural that can be charged oh god that'll push back that enemy lord god it'll push it back lord and give strength to that life lord to reach out and who knows that might be the very day that they're born again help us lord help us father may we consult you lord in every
