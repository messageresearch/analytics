[34:29] again and I want to go to Joshua and
[34:32] Joshua 1 we want to read a few verses of
[34:35] scripture and uh I'd like to start with
[34:38] verse
[34:42] three the Lord will help us once again
[34:45] tonight I'd like to just uh continue to
[34:48] approach that subject on overcoming
[34:52] worry overcoming worry sir you know it
[34:56] always there's there's things that are
[34:57] always before us to
[34:59] overcome and uh the greatest the
[35:02] greatest battle that can ever be won is
[35:04] when we have overcome and that great
[35:07] battle on the inside has been won that
[35:10] Victory but then through that that gives
[35:12] us the strength to press beyond all the
[35:15] circumstances of life and you realize
[35:18] brother Brandon will talk about it in
[35:19] the message how can I overcome and he'll
[35:22] speak of overcoming as what we have to
[35:25] press through and then he'll go in
[35:27] another other part of it and deal with
[35:29] overcoming is what we need to surrender
[35:31] to so there's always a pressing there's
[35:33] times when we're going to have to press
[35:35] and there's times where we have to
[35:36] surrender and those are the times that
[35:39] the Holy Spirit just leads us on what to
[35:41] do because the real overcoming is always
[35:43] about our own will and we're always
[35:46] challenged within all of that so the
[35:48] overcoming with the Bible I love how it
[35:50] says that whosoever is born of God
[35:52] overcometh the world Amen and this is
[35:55] the victory even our faith it is didn't
[35:57] say that there would not be
[35:59] circumstances that we would not face but
[36:02] greater is he that is in us than he
[36:05] that's in the world that's our that's
[36:07] our comfort verse three every place that
[36:10] the soul of your foot shall tread upon
[36:13] that have I given unto you as I said
[36:16] unto Moses from the Wilderness and this
[36:19] Lebanon even unto the Great River the
[36:22] river Euphrates all the land of the
[36:24] Hittites and unto the great sea toward
[36:27] the going down of the sun shall be your
[36:30] Coast there shall not any man be able to
[36:33] stand before thee all the days of thy
[36:37] life as I was with Moses so I will be
[36:41] with thee I will not fail thee nor
[36:45] forsake thee now God never said you
[36:49] wouldn't
[36:50] fail but he says I won't fail there you
[36:54] go that's what's important there you go
[36:57] because with if we're in him we can't
[36:59] fail he said I will not fail
[37:05] thee Amen brother brandom tells us over
[37:08] and over he said if it's my words he
[37:09] said it's a failure to begin with right
[37:12] away he said but if I'm standing here
[37:14] and I'm standing on his words then
[37:15] heavens and earth can pass away but my
[37:18] word shall never fail amen so that's
[37:21] where we're looking tonight is is is to
[37:24] him be strong and of a good courage For
[37:26] unto this people people shalt thou
[37:28] divide for an inheritance the land which
[37:31] I swear unto their fathers to give them
[37:34] only be thou strong and very courageous
[37:36] that thou mayest observe to do according
[37:39] to all the law which Moses my servant
[37:43] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[37:46] right hand or to the left that thou
[37:48] mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest
[37:52] so he he's laying a very very scriptural
[37:54] order that the the real prospering is by
[37:57] the word verse eight this book of the
[38:01] law shall not depart out of thy mouth
[38:04] but Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[38:07] night that thou mayest observe to do
[38:09] according to all that is written therein
[38:12] for then Thou shalt make thy way
[38:15] prosperous and then Thou shalt have good
[38:18] success have not I commanded thee be
[38:22] strong and of a good courage I I like
[38:24] that question you know God's asking a
[38:25] question and he's and the question when
[38:28] God asks it he's asking Joshua to
[38:30] consider who is it that's commissioned
[38:32] you you've not been commissioned by just
[38:35] another mortal man you've not been
[38:37] commissioned by a seminary a the you
[38:39] you've not been commissioned by man
[38:41] you've been commissioned by God Lord
[38:44] have not I commanded thee be strong and
[38:49] of a good courage Be not Afraid neither
[38:52] be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[38:56] with thee with whether soever thou goest
[39:00] amen may God bless you and bless the
[39:02] reading of the word as you're being
[39:09] seated when we look here brother
[39:11] brandham would say it like this and as I
[39:13] was with Moses in this message and he
[39:16] says Joshua in all of this knowing that
[39:20] the command was great but having the
[39:23] Assurance he could be Fearless he could
[39:26] be as we'd call it Reckless as long as
[39:29] he was pointed the right way he might
[39:33] break up against a hill that would knock
[39:35] him backwards but he was carried the
[39:38] right way and so can the Church of the
[39:41] Living God be Reckless and fearless in
[39:45] faith if were're pointed the right way
[39:49] for he said as I was with Moses I'll be
[39:53] with you I'll not fail you nor forsake
[39:56] you he never forsaken Moses he never
[39:59] failed Moses he will not fail Joshua he
[40:03] will not fail us he'll be with us yes
[40:07] sir see God's desire when he sends his
[40:11] word is to drive away all fear and to
[40:16] understand that worry and fear are are
[40:18] not two different things but worry
[40:20] itself is where as we've been looking at
[40:23] to where a concern itself can just
[40:25] really work to overtake it and maybe at
[40:28] some point in time you've dealt with an
[40:30] anxious moment or anxiety or you've had
[40:33] a a panic attack or you've had something
[40:35] that can come your way a doctor's report
[40:38] or something that can be sad and and you
[40:41] there is a challenge that's there before
[40:43] you now just understand this when your
[40:46] soul is redeemed you still live in these
[40:48] other two Realms these outer two Realms
[40:52] are still sin and they can experience
[40:56] the effects and feelings and things that
[40:59] would come our way but that's why it's
[41:01] important to have Jesus Christ in the
[41:04] center of your life that's why it's
[41:06] important to have an anchor that when
[41:09] the storms gets rough and the waves
[41:11] start tossing and all sorts of thoughts
[41:14] and everything else can come and it it
[41:17] looks like you've prayed for something
[41:19] and everything is going in the opposite
[41:22] direction that's what matters who it is
[41:24] that's in your ship because when he's in
[41:27] your ship well that ship's not going to
[41:29] go down because he can't fail he's given
[41:34] his word and his word is sure God has
[41:37] proven it over and over again if we if
[41:40] we looked at just the mortality of man
[41:43] like if Joshua would just maybe if God
[41:46] would have just told him should have
[41:48] been sufficient but God knows how we are
[41:51] even as in our humanness and that
[41:53] doesn't stumble God it never stumbled
[41:56] God when he told Gideon I want you to go
[41:58] down and hear this dream if you're
[42:00] afraid take your armor bear with you god
[42:02] wasn't worried about that he just knew
[42:05] he needs to hear what's going to be said
[42:08] because what will be said if he's there
[42:10] to hear it it'll stabilize him and give
[42:13] him strength for what I'm calling him to
[42:15] do and so when God would tell Joshua
[42:18] very familiar to us but he would remind
[42:20] Joshua that as I was with Moses so will
[42:25] I be with thee he could recall as a
[42:28] Young Man Joshua could recall that as he
[42:31] could look at Moses and he had such a
[42:33] respect for for Moses as God's prophet
[42:36] he knew that Moses was not getting this
[42:40] leadership from his own accord or from
[42:43] the Egyptians but Moses was getting his
[42:45] marching orders from the logos he was
[42:48] following that Pillar of Fire and so
[42:51] Joshua could have that rest and that
[42:53] confidence he had that assurance that
[42:56] even when the rest of the spies Brethren
[42:59] that he went over with 10 to two they
[43:01] were outnumbered with those who said
[43:04] were not able to take it and they spoke
[43:06] of all the obstacles Joshua knew of all
[43:09] the obstacles that was set before him
[43:11] but Joshua was looking at the word like
[43:15] Caleb more than all the obstacles and if
[43:18] you look all around and even when uh uh
[43:22] any time of Promise is presented or
[43:24] anything in your life there's always
[43:26] going to be a lot of obstacles a lot of
[43:29] opposition but in that moment that's to
[43:31] realize the obstacles and the opposition
[43:35] are no match for the Living God if we're
[43:38] standing on God's word those giants that
[43:41] you see those tormenting thoughts
[43:44] whatever it might be if you'll stand on
[43:46] God's word God will bring them right
[43:49] down to size and let you see that he's
[43:53] God over every situation over everything
[43:57] that's in your inheritance he's God yes
[44:01] sir one of the things that here that God
[44:04] would deal with with Joshua and this
[44:07] like I said this is very familiar
[44:09] territory for us but there's always that
[44:11] part that when we deal with and think
[44:14] about overcoming even in worry that you
[44:17] know sometimes the thought can strike
[44:19] and and can move around of of failing
[44:22] and and what if I fail or what if I make
[44:24] a mistake like God moving a on your
[44:27] heart maybe God moves on your heart to
[44:29] send somebody a scripture or moves upon
[44:32] your heart to send them a quote or or to
[44:34] just call them and say I'm thinking
[44:35] about you and then all of a sudden you
[44:37] know you can get a thought well you know
[44:39] is that me am am I in my flesh or or is
[44:42] this or maybe I better not I don't want
[44:44] them and and all of a sudden we begin to
[44:46] wrestle with our own thoughts and our
[44:49] own feelings about things because I
[44:51] don't want to make a mistake I don't
[44:53] want to fail you can never fail or make
[44:56] a mistake when you're standing on God's
[45:00] word are you hearing me you can't do
[45:03] that when we're standing on God's word
[45:05] when we're being moved by God and we're
[45:07] standing on his word his word is a place
[45:10] where there's no failure and so look how
[45:13] it says in Romans 8 verse1 there is
[45:16] therefore now no condemnation to them
[45:19] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[45:23] after the flesh but after the spirit
[45:26] that is a very crucial point we're not
[45:30] walking when we're in Christ we're not
[45:32] walking after the flesh it's not about
[45:35] us it's not about because the desires in
[45:38] our life have been purified they they've
[45:41] been removed our only desire is I want
[45:44] to please him that's all I'm concerned
[45:46] about I want to know what he wants done
[45:49] I I want to walk after him I'm not
[45:51] walking after my own will I'm walking
[45:54] after his desire Hallelujah see that's
[45:57] the great difference of how that God
[46:00] works and he moves within lives and
[46:02] hearts and it's so wonderful because the
[46:05] word cannot fail you see this is why
[46:08] when God spoke to Joshua and Joshua put
[46:11] the word first that was that was the
[46:14] very ingredient for victory is getting
[46:17] the word first and so when the word is
[46:20] first there's a sure promise of Victory
[46:23] when we put God's word first it's the
[46:25] secret to a real successful and
[46:28] prosperous life it's important to put
[46:31] the word above our feelings feelings are
[46:33] not wrong but I want the word to be what
[46:37] allows my feelings to come forth is that
[46:40] right even when we I shout or Rejoice
[46:42] whatever it might be feelings within
[46:45] things even with praying about God's
[46:47] will for things I I don't want my
[46:49] feelings to lead me I want God's word to
[46:52] Lead Me sure I might feel this way but
[46:55] as the prophet said I keep praying I
[46:57] keep looking to God because ultimately
[47:00] when we put the word first you the word
[47:03] cannot
[47:05] fail amen
[47:08] hallelujah now here in the scripture
[47:11] when we think of this within failure and
[47:14] and remember of of failing and all of
[47:17] these things because if we would look at
[47:20] ourselves and and uh focus upon
[47:23] ourselves wow my that would be enough to
[47:26] shake
[47:27] anybody and you can find things that I
[47:29] probably won't even get to tonight and
[47:31] just just tracking the prophet over the
[47:33] commission and looking at things of how
[47:36] that God works to so stabilize a man for
[47:39] what he's called that man to do even in
[47:41] the advancement of life God stabilizes
[47:45] you when he calls you for the next
[47:47] appointment the next chapter the next
[47:49] juncture of life God does not leave you
[47:52] alone he is there to confirm all along
[47:56] every step of the way I'm glad about
[47:59] that aren't
[48:01] you notice here in John 14 and I want to
[48:05] just kind of deal with that word
[48:07] comforter for a minute he says I will
[48:09] pray the father and he will give you
[48:11] another comforter that he may abide with
[48:14] you forever even the spirit of Truth
[48:17] whom the world cannot receive because it
[48:20] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[48:23] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[48:26] shall be in you that's good he was
[48:29] announcing to them that the comforter
[48:32] that you're to receive he is with you
[48:35] even now he is standing behind this veil
[48:38] of flesh but he shall be in your
[48:42] flesh that's so good glory did they
[48:45] understand all of that they
[48:48] didn't oh my but you see this is why can
[48:52] man fail yes but God can't fail amen let
[48:56] me tell you something that's why the
[48:58] real you on the inside has never
[49:02] failed a real son and daughter of God
[49:05] that seed on the inside that had that
[49:08] has not been tampered with it's not a
[49:11] product of an Earthly Union that came
[49:14] directly from the loins of God's
[49:18] mind and when you repent you are
[49:21] repenting for allowing that old nature
[49:24] to rule in your life yes this is why the
[49:28] prophet could say when you've come
[49:30] through the washing of Water by the word
[49:33] and the quickening power has come to
[49:35] raise up that seat he said you are
[49:38] Justified as though you never did it in
[49:41] the first place where is the first place
[49:44] in the mind of
[49:46] God you can remember your failures you
[49:50] can remember the things that you did but
[49:53] that seed on the inside that son that
[49:56] daughter of God it never handled a beer
[49:58] bottle it never took a drink it never
[50:01] said a wrong word I'm talking about that
[50:04] genus that came from
[50:08] God hallelujah it who is it then it is
[50:11] the word inside of
[50:16] youall God is Jehovah Gyra he provided a
[50:21] resting place for
[50:24] himself verse 26 and the comforter which
[50:28] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[50:30] send in my name he shall teach you all
[50:34] things so don't get nervous he he'll
[50:37] give you what you
[50:38] need and bring all things to your
[50:41] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[50:45] you John 15:26 when the comforter is
[50:48] come whom I will send unto you from the
[50:51] father even the spirit of truth it's a
[50:54] direct witness not only has he been
[50:57] accepted but you have been accepted in
[51:00] the
[51:00] Beloved God has made one acceptance and
[51:04] when the Holy Spirit has come God has
[51:08] recognized your faith identified you
[51:11] were included in redemption's plan all
[51:14] along and the comforter has now come to
[51:19] solidify that in your heart yes sir
[51:22] beautiful failure how can I
[51:25] fail how can I
[51:28] fail brother Samuel you don't know how
[51:30] many mistakes I make I I'm I said how
[51:33] can you
[51:34] fail now let me take the same word
[51:38] comforter and let me pick it up and use
[51:40] it as it comes in the scripture with
[51:43] another attribute of what the Holy Ghost
[51:46] is in 1 John Chapter 2 verse1 My Little
[51:50] Children these things write I unto you
[51:53] that you sin not and if any man
[51:57] sin we have an advocate with the father
[52:00] Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the
[52:04] propetuating
[52:27] where we would have for any students
[52:30] that they wanted to have tested for
[52:32] special needs and they felt that there
[52:34] was learning difficulties and things
[52:36] like that some of the things the test
[52:38] and things that initial Parts um we
[52:41] would administer and sometimes when I
[52:42] would stand in as a principal we would
[52:45] administer those tests we would stand
[52:47] there we would sit in those meetings and
[52:50] then I remember when it would get to
[52:51] certain places with maybe if a child
[52:54] there's certain things that begin to
[52:56] show themselves within over these
[52:59] different battery of tests it it's one
[53:01] of those things that to me I don't want
[53:03] to get political here but the
[53:05] bureaucracy you've got to jump through
[53:06] hoops to jump through another one
[53:08] sometimes you know you could start in
[53:10] September and that child would not get
[53:12] where they needed to get to until April
[53:14] that's right and it just it had nothing
[53:16] to do with us not meeting it just simply
[53:18] is just all of the all of the things you
[53:20] know that do this and do that and so
[53:22] forth but what it is is that when
[53:24] something had had come out that they
[53:27] could see that the the the child itself
[53:29] maybe there was a learning disability
[53:32] maybe there was a different other need
[53:33] that was present they would have then
[53:36] always then within the meeting they
[53:38] would have an advocate one who would be
[53:42] not this Advocate is one who knew what
[53:46] belonged to this parent that's good so
[53:49] they they would be there to watch out
[53:51] you know so you're not putting them in a
[53:53] cuz everything you do with that is
[53:54] always put it to uh placing them in an a
[53:57] least restrictive environment and so
[54:00] everything you do you have to watch all
[54:01] of these checks and things of action
[54:03] plans and those documents and I'm not
[54:06] saying that to get you lost I'm saying
[54:07] it to say say this that there would
[54:09] always be somebody that would be there
[54:12] as an advocate that would know what
[54:15] rights that child had and the parent and
[54:18] would be able to set right along side
[54:20] and and you had to be aware of that they
[54:22] were there to help that that parent
[54:24] along the way now let me say this to you
[54:27] you and I have an advocate with the
[54:30] father Jesus Christ the righteous
[54:33] there's sometimes that you might get
[54:35] yourself in a hole and you don't know
[54:37] how to get yourself out but there is one
[54:40] who knows how he knows how to lead you
[54:42] out and it isn't necessarily so much
[54:44] you're in a hole sometimes you get in
[54:46] your mind in different places when you
[54:49] have failed or you fallen short or you
[54:51] made a mistake or something has come
[54:53] about and you have that constantly
[54:55] before you let me just tell you
[54:57] something friends this is why that among
[54:59] Believers are you hearing me this is why
[55:02] that among Believers it ought to be
[55:04] something that we have so established in
[55:06] our heart we ought to be ready to
[55:09] forgive you say why because that's
[55:12] Godlike he said Thou Art ready to
[55:16] forgive Thou Art plenteous in Mercy and
[55:19] you can't do that unless you've
[55:22] experienced it this is why that when you
[55:25] see somebody else fail and you might
[55:27] look and see their error remember that's
[55:29] an opportunity for you to extend the
[55:33] grace of God to them and stand there
[55:35] with the same spirit of God in your life
[55:38] like an advocate and say that's not my
[55:41] brother it's not my sister they didn't
[55:44] mean it Lord don't hold that against
[55:46] them and go on that's what children of
[55:49] God
[55:51] do is that right an advocate because
[55:56] look at look here in the message what is
[55:59] the Holy Ghost the prophet said what is
[56:02] the Holy Ghost it's an advocate what is
[56:05] an advocator what does it do it makes an
[56:08] advocate it has Mercy it stands in your
[56:11] place it does things that you can't do
[56:15] it's a
[56:25] propetuating sweet that's wonderful but
[56:27] that's your righteousness if you rest in
[56:30] it in that way well I've not done this
[56:32] I've read so many chapters I listen
[56:34] friends I believe there's something in
[56:36] us that we would get into the word of
[56:39] God but you understand our righteousness
[56:42] is not our own it's his righteousness
[56:45] and when we are in him The Advocate
[56:48] stands as our
[56:51] righteousness he stands for you and
[56:54] I Hallelujah
[56:58] man glory be to God it's your healing
[57:01] it's your life it's your Resurrection
[57:03] it's all that God has for you he's an
[57:07] advocate oh he said how we could go into
[57:09] details and speak of how it makes
[57:11] intercession for our ignorance sometimes
[57:14] when we got the Holy Ghost he said we
[57:16] ignorantly stagger into something and
[57:19] the Holy Spirit is there to make
[57:22] advocate for us
[57:24] that's Hallelujah
[57:27] sometimes the things you know let me
[57:29] just say this sometimes you can look and
[57:31] say you got to be careful because if you
[57:33] look and say how could that brother how
[57:35] could that sister stagger into that well
[57:37] you know what God God works out the
[57:39] rough edges on our
[57:41] lives yes and just be careful that the
[57:44] Judgment that you measure out is not
[57:46] measured back to
[57:47] you because you see there's a molding in
[57:50] a shaping of our character that takes
[57:53] place but when God brings things to our
[57:55] attention
[57:56] and it comes to light and we see it as
[57:59] God sees it then a child of God will
[58:02] quickly stand with the side of the
[58:06] Lord is that right notice the holy
[58:10] spirit is there to make advocate for us
[58:12] he's an advocator he's an attorney he
[58:15] stands there and pleads for us we don't
[58:17] plead for oursel because the Holy Ghost
[58:20] in US pleads for us and the Holy Spirit
[58:22] giving utterance sometimes with words
[58:25] you can't understand understand and he
[58:27] makes intercession for us that's what
[58:29] the Holy Ghost is when I walk into
[58:32] anything I walk like a little kid you
[58:36] walk like a little fell now let's just
[58:38] look at this for a
[58:39] moment when you're little when you're
[58:41] little one you know it gets to a certain
[58:43] time of an age and you've told it don't
[58:45] do this and it goes ahead and it does it
[58:50] you didn't remove them from being your
[58:53] child you don't take them and say
[58:56] goodness sakes you're no longer my child
[58:59] you correct them love is corrective why
[59:03] would you correct them because you know
[59:05] that if they keep going that way that's
[59:08] dangerous and so will God God will
[59:11] correct us now listen friends when we
[59:14] stagger ignorantly into things you see
[59:17] God like a little child here we are
[59:19] there's no desire to do things that's
[59:21] wrong sometimes even where a person is
[59:23] has to realize even of Their Own makeup
[59:26] and how that they're made up and to
[59:28] recognize when sometimes they look and
[59:30] say how do I fall into this or how do I
[59:32] fall into that but you know when you can
[59:34] invite the spirit of God and say Lord
[59:37] teach me Lord teach My Hands to War
[59:40] because I don't want to keep falling in
[59:42] the same in the same hole all the time
[59:45] what is it that's a real son and
[59:47] daughter of God instead of putting blame
[59:49] on somebody else it's looking to God and
[59:51] say Lord teach me
[59:54] amen hallelujah that's so good
[59:57] Hallelujah he's an advocator when I walk
[1:00:00] into anything I walk like a little kid
[1:00:02] you know when you're when your kid uh
[1:00:04] your little child when they walk into
[1:00:06] something and you know ignorantly you
[1:00:08] hadn't told them well you don't spank
[1:00:09] them after that you don't spank them if
[1:00:12] you hadn't told them if they touch it
[1:00:14] and you say no no that that's hot and
[1:00:17] and they touch it well you don't spank
[1:00:18] them because of that but if they get
[1:00:21] around it again and they you know how
[1:00:23] sometimes you've seen kids do this where
[1:00:24] they're they're told not to touch it and
[1:00:26] they'll
[1:00:29] do that's
[1:00:31] right well Grace Grace was there the
[1:00:34] first time now Grace is going to come in
[1:00:36] a different measure and it's going to
[1:00:38] correct you to let you know what I said
[1:00:40] I meant even though they may not
[1:00:43] understand it but there's a reason
[1:00:45] you're doing it for them right is that
[1:00:47] right you see we're walking in a dark
[1:00:50] world full of enemies full of sin full
[1:00:52] of traps full of everything you say oh
[1:00:55] I'm afraid
[1:00:56] I'm afraid to take Christian Life I'm
[1:00:59] afraid to do this I'm afraid I'll do
[1:01:01] this don't be afraid we have an advocate
[1:01:06] oh he stands by us he's in us and he
[1:01:10] makes intercessions for us the Holy
[1:01:13] Spirit constantly constantly making an
[1:01:16] advocate for us all the
[1:01:19] time so not only does he stand there as
[1:01:21] our righteousness he's there to to to
[1:01:24] plead on our behalf to make intercession
[1:01:27] for you and I even at times when we
[1:01:30] don't even know what to say maybe you're
[1:01:32] in a situation and you don't you now you
[1:01:34] can't even get down you couldn't get
[1:01:36] down on your knees and pray you couldn't
[1:01:37] walk away and pray but God in the midst
[1:01:40] of it when your heart looking to God and
[1:01:43] now the Holy Spirit our Advocate begins
[1:01:45] to intercede on our behalf maybe that
[1:01:48] comes upon somebody else's heart to pray
[1:01:50] for us I don't know how that God will do
[1:01:53] it how that he does it but I just know
[1:01:56] that he does it that at times when we
[1:01:58] have need of an answer have need of
[1:02:01] Direction when we have need of
[1:02:03] Deliverance God is faithful and he
[1:02:06] cannot fail amen now think about how the
[1:02:10] prophet I like how he puts this uh in
[1:02:12] the message Jehovah Gyra he's talking
[1:02:14] about Abraham and how that Abraham you
[1:02:17] know had raised his hand and you know
[1:02:20] when he had taken Isaac up to the
[1:02:22] mountain there up to mount Mariah and
[1:02:25] remember he had w completely in full
[1:02:28] obedience to the voice of God and
[1:02:30] brother BM says it like this I want you
[1:02:32] just watch how he applies this here he
[1:02:34] says how that he no doubt could look at
[1:02:36] Isaac and say farewell my boy he raised
[1:02:39] his hand and about that time in full
[1:02:42] obedience even if you're doing something
[1:02:45] wrong and walking in obedience the Holy
[1:02:48] Ghost is there to stop you that's so
[1:02:51] good so God allowed the type to go so
[1:02:55] far
[1:02:56] and then God said stay your
[1:02:58] hand what did that the same spirit of
[1:03:01] God that led him to take Isaac up there
[1:03:05] brother Ram says you say I'm afraid if I
[1:03:08] ever receive the Holy Ghost I might act
[1:03:10] indecently don't you worry if it's the
[1:03:13] Holy Ghost he will know when to stop you
[1:03:15] and when to start you he's got the
[1:03:17] button in his hand so he knows when to
[1:03:20] turn on and turn off just throw yourself
[1:03:23] at his
[1:03:24] Mercy boy I tell you that ought to throw
[1:03:27] a lot of worries off right now oh I'm
[1:03:30] afraid I might this or I'm afraid I
[1:03:32] might this well I'm afraid I may
[1:03:34] not be sensitive to him oh yeah come on
[1:03:39] friends I'm afraid see God knows God
[1:03:43] knows exactly what he's doing he he
[1:03:46] works to dispel his fear and as long as
[1:03:48] we're in tune with him and we're looking
[1:03:50] to him we put the word first and we're
[1:03:53] looking to the Lord then the word cannot
[1:03:56] fail right amen this is why the
[1:03:58] scripture says in Psalms
[1:04:00] 37:23 the steps of a good man are
[1:04:03] ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in
[1:04:07] his way though he fall he shall not be
[1:04:11] utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth
[1:04:15] him with his hand Psalms
[1:04:19] 145:14 the Lord upholdeth all that fall
[1:04:23] and raiseth up all those that be be
[1:04:26] bowed down the scripture records in
[1:04:29] Hebrews 1:3 who being speaking of the
[1:04:32] Lord Jesus who being the brightness of
[1:04:33] his glory and the expressed image of his
[1:04:36] person and upholding All Things by the
[1:04:39] word of his power when he had by himself
[1:04:42] purged our sins sat down on the right
[1:04:45] hand of the Majesty on
[1:04:48] high so there there is no possibility of
[1:04:52] the word being
[1:04:54] overthrown you know know the word has
[1:04:56] never failed right never and the word
[1:04:59] Can't Fail right remember it wasn't the
[1:05:02] word that failed in Eden it was one of
[1:05:05] God's subjects that let down on the word
[1:05:08] and if Satan remember if Satan can get
[1:05:11] you to doubt your weapon then he's got
[1:05:14] you
[1:05:14] whipped because your weapon is the word
[1:05:19] it's what the word says not what your
[1:05:22] feelings say that's so good and The
[1:05:25] Advocate is there for you not only to
[1:05:28] stand there and make intercession for
[1:05:30] what you have done or maybe you fell
[1:05:33] here or I've fallen in this here and and
[1:05:35] I made a mistake it's not only there to
[1:05:37] do that but he's also to do for you what
[1:05:40] you cannot do to build up in your life
[1:05:43] to where the things that once haunted
[1:05:46] you no longer haunt you
[1:05:49] Hallelujah that's what the advocate's
[1:05:51] able to do yes sir he does now notice in
[1:05:54] the message one that he says we know we
[1:05:57] make mistakes but we mustn't look at
[1:06:00] that it's not your mistakes because
[1:06:02] you're always going to have them but
[1:06:04] it's following his rules and following
[1:06:07] what he said do stumble and falling
[1:06:10] doesn't have one thing to do with it a
[1:06:12] real true servant if he'll stumble he'll
[1:06:15] get up again if he wobbles God pulls him
[1:06:18] right back in the path as long as he's
[1:06:20] in the path of Duty but if he's off the
[1:06:22] path of Duty God's not obligated to him
[1:06:26] but as long as he's in the path of Duty
[1:06:28] God's obligated to him knowing that he's
[1:06:30] just a man or woman he's obligated to
[1:06:33] that person as long as they're in the
[1:06:36] path of Duty yes
[1:06:38] amen oh my are you catching it tonight
[1:06:42] it isn't just God sitting down with us
[1:06:44] and sitting across you know a table from
[1:06:46] one another with coffee in our hands and
[1:06:47] saying don't worry don't worry don't
[1:06:49] worry don't worry don't worry that's not
[1:06:52] how God does it God God doesn't
[1:06:54] stabilize has us with just rapid fire of
[1:06:58] words but God stabilizes Us by his word
[1:07:02] that's the only thing that can a ever
[1:07:05] stabilize our hearts is the word of
[1:07:08] God listen friends that's why even in a
[1:07:11] service like this on overcoming worry
[1:07:14] this is where that even in this with
[1:07:16] failure if you can just say Lord let it
[1:07:19] drop down to the fifth rib I don't want
[1:07:22] to just be scriptures and quotes that
[1:07:24] I'm rejoicing in in I want to rejoice in
[1:07:27] it but let it so drop inside of me Lord
[1:07:30] God let it become so a part of me that I
[1:07:33] recognize Lord that you cannot fail and
[1:07:37] I can't fail by being in you
[1:07:40] hallu I might stumble and fail I might
[1:07:43] fall but he cannot fail and if I'm in
[1:07:47] him then there is a strength that
[1:07:49] upholds me that lifts me back
[1:07:53] [Applause]
[1:07:54] up that maybe when I feel lower than the
[1:07:57] padding underneath this carpet there is
[1:07:59] a strength of a hand that upholds me
[1:08:02] that lifts me back up and what does it
[1:08:05] do point me to the way
[1:08:09] back
[1:08:15] Hallelujah my
[1:08:17] my
[1:08:19] my oh
[1:08:21] my huh oh my my my my
[1:08:26] Glory Exodus 14 verse 10 sorry I'm off
[1:08:30] in another place
[1:08:33] here oh my maybe the Lord sometime will
[1:08:36] let me preach a message I spoke there at
[1:08:39] the youth retreat and dealt with a
[1:08:40] failing and went through just a Litany
[1:08:42] of people down through time people who
[1:08:44] were R rote off and told you'll never be
[1:08:48] nothing I'm talking about famous
[1:08:51] athletes I'm talking about people who
[1:08:53] end up being famous cartoonist

[1:09:04] start studying it where even there were
[1:09:05] people that said there ain't nothing you
[1:09:07] can get out of this
[1:09:10] right let me tell you something God
[1:09:12] would allow those examples to be for you
[1:09:14] and
[1:09:18] I right okay I'm not going to go through
[1:09:21] the whole list but you even look at
[1:09:23] Michael Jordan didn't even make the high
[1:09:25] school basketball

[1:09:32] guy who pounded a a ball with air in
[1:09:35] it okay that that went around he didn't
[1:09:38] even make the high school basketball
[1:09:40] team his first year
[1:09:43] out but you know what he did he said he
[1:09:45] looked at that he hung up that where
[1:09:48] they have the cut offs and they have
[1:09:50] that where you didn't make the list he
[1:09:51] hung that every day he worked out he
[1:09:54] looked at that
[1:09:56] oh let me tell you something I'm not
[1:09:58] looking at a bunch of fallible men I'm
[1:10:01] not looking at a bunch of fallible men
[1:10:03] in women I'm looking at God's word that
[1:10:05] says you're not going to make it you've
[1:10:07] already made
[1:10:09] it because he already made it and if I'm
[1:10:12] in him the only thing I have to do is
[1:10:15] daily and Ming in my life Lord with all
[1:10:18] of my heart I want to give myself to you
[1:10:20] if there's things that I'm seeing in my
[1:10:22] life right now then Lord your grace is
[1:10:25] sufficient to give me the strength to
[1:10:28] move Beyond it

[1:10:35] overcoming grace of God you'll find
[1:10:37] things in your age right now that if God
[1:10:39] carries when you're 50 years old you'll
[1:10:41] need the grace of God to overcome in
[1:10:43] another part of your life you don't ever
[1:10:46] get to a spot to say well I can hang it
[1:10:48] up buddy it's over with let's just let
[1:10:51] the trophies come in you're going to
[1:10:52] have to fight every day of your life
[1:10:56] you're going to have to tell the Devil
[1:10:58] he's a liar and stand right there on
[1:11:01] God's word day after day there's times
[1:11:03] you're going to have to press beyond
[1:11:05] your own feelings and go beyond your own
[1:11:08] thoughts and your own ideas but you have
[1:11:11] an advocate a strength on the
[1:11:14] inside Hallelujah and you're more than a
[1:11:18] conqueror
[1:11:22] hallu overcoming worry
[1:11:26] oh Exodus
[1:11:28] 14:10 I thought of this I thought oh my
[1:11:30] when brother joosu was doing that at
[1:11:33] testimony wasn't that awesome last week
[1:11:36] man oh man
[1:11:39] hallu I think what brother Joshua these
[1:11:41] these scriptures and I thought my he had
[1:11:43] them there in one of the closing slides
[1:11:45] and he was going through I think one of
[1:11:48] the things like brother justos way we
[1:11:50] were talking about it he said you know
[1:11:51] he says what God he said had called me
[1:11:54] to go through he said he may not have
[1:11:55] called anybody else to go through he
[1:11:56] said but God's called them to go through
[1:11:58] something different that's right but
[1:12:00] it's just to know he's the same God no
[1:12:02] matter the
[1:12:03] circumstance amen aren't you grateful
[1:12:05] for that amen verse 10 when Pharaoh Drew
[1:12:10] nigh the children of Israel lifted up
[1:12:12] their eyes and behold the Egyptians
[1:12:15] marched after them and they were sore
[1:12:17] afraid and the children of Israel Cried
[1:12:19] Out unto the Lord and they said unto
[1:12:22] Moses because there were no graves in
[1:12:24] egypt' hast thou taken us away to die in
[1:12:27] the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt
[1:12:29] thus with us to carry us forth out of
[1:12:33] Egypt is not this the word that we did
[1:12:36] tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone
[1:12:39] that we may serve the Egyptians for it
[1:12:41] had been better for us to serve the
[1:12:43] Egyptians than that we should die in the
[1:12:45] wilderness and Moses said unto the
[1:12:48] people this is important fear ye
[1:12:53] not he he was not going to try to go
[1:12:57] back and try to convince him no he now
[1:13:01] is a word that comes and let me say this
[1:13:03] to you this word that was coming it was
[1:13:06] a word that was coming directly from
[1:13:08] God's
[1:13:10] mind yes sir as a matter of fact
[1:13:12] remember Moses speaks this he's
[1:13:15] prophesying it's it's not it's not Moses
[1:13:19] impression see this is why many people
[1:13:21] asking brother Brandon brother Brandon
[1:13:22] would you come pray for this one brother
[1:13:24] Brandon will you see a vision brother
[1:13:25] Ram said no no you got the wrong idea he
[1:13:27] said this is not Impressions no right
[1:13:30] many times he said people God will do
[1:13:32] something for when somebody one time he
[1:13:34] said and then here they go under
[1:13:35] Impressions no we're not they were not
[1:13:37] going by Impressions Moses wasn't living
[1:13:40] by an impression this was he was in tune
[1:13:43] with God and a crisis arose and there
[1:13:45] was something that Rose from within
[1:13:48] Moses that spoke to that situation
[1:13:51] hallelujah how many know what I'm
[1:13:53] talking about there been things it come
[1:13:55] out that you don't even know where did
[1:13:57] that come from it bypassed your
[1:13:59] reasoning bypassed your
[1:14:02] thinking Hallelujah I never forget when
[1:14:05] Benjamin had that that that uh that
[1:14:07] place on his eye that that tumor it was
[1:14:10] supposed to be we had already made plans
[1:14:12] to have that taken out and here my wife
[1:14:15] nudges me and I I know you may have
[1:14:17] heard that before but she nudges me to
[1:14:18] come up front she said you know after
[1:14:20] they've done everything over at
[1:14:21] Cleveland Clinic and you know sizing him
[1:14:23] up and getting ready for everything to
[1:14:26] take place and she said you why don't we
[1:14:28] just go up and have him prayed for I
[1:14:30] said well okay I'll take him up my dad
[1:14:32] was preaching that night I got up here
[1:14:35] and the brothers the deacons gathered
[1:14:36] around us and we begin to pray and as
[1:14:39] we're praying what came out of my mouth
[1:14:42] instead of asking God to be with us in
[1:14:45] the surgery what came out of my mouth
[1:14:47] and all I could say is I just heard
[1:14:49] myself saying it thanking God for his
[1:14:53] healing Hallelujah
[1:14:55] and I heard myself say that and now you
[1:14:57] know in your own mind you're hearing
[1:14:59] yourself and you're thinking why am I
[1:15:01] saying that
[1:15:03] right and it wasn't but what was it the
[1:15:05] next week we were sitting there at the
[1:15:07] dinner table and I looked over when I

[1:15:42] completely
[1:15:46] gone that's not what I did hallah I
[1:15:51] didn't make that happen that was God in
[1:15:54] his
[1:15:56] sovereignty hallu
[1:15:58] Hallelujah notice this is the same thing
[1:16:01] with Moses you see this is why it's
[1:16:03] trusting the Lord that as you're walking
[1:16:05] with God you put God first God will give
[1:16:08] you what you need to speak in that
[1:16:11] moment take no thought what you shall
[1:16:14] say oh they might try to trap me here
[1:16:17] they might try to trap me there the boss
[1:16:19] is calling me in here the union visor
[1:16:21] this and this and that and but take no
[1:16:23] thought what you shall say if you put
[1:16:26] God first you can walk in there and
[1:16:28] knowing that God is your partner God is
[1:16:31] standing right there with you he's an
[1:16:33] advocate when the prophet was standing
[1:16:36] there and great great intellectual men
[1:16:39] on a tax case and where they were at and
[1:16:42] at that moment the Holy Spirit alerted
[1:16:44] him to propose that question to them and
[1:16:47] then they seen the error of their way
[1:16:51] wow yes sir and the prophet you know
[1:16:54] what I like about it he puts it right
[1:16:55] back to the word take no thought what
[1:16:58] you shall
[1:16:59] say you know what you know what this
[1:17:01] message did this message did the same
[1:17:03] thing that every man down through time
[1:17:06] that caught a hold of the Revelation in
[1:17:10] their age for their word just like John
[1:17:12] wincliff when those men and I I can't
[1:17:15] some of the rest of them tendell and
[1:17:17] they they would stand there and say
[1:17:18] we're going to put a copy of this in the
[1:17:21] plow Boy
[1:17:22] Pocket why cuz it's important to know
[1:17:25] your
[1:17:26] rights those men risk their life so that
[1:17:29] you and I could have this
[1:17:33] Bible is that right yes sir standing
[1:17:36] right there upon God's word that you and
[1:17:39] I can take this word and applying it to
[1:17:41] our
[1:17:42] hearts my they dared against the
[1:17:45] opposition
[1:17:48] Hallelujah that's what this message has
[1:17:50] done the word the gospel was meant to
[1:17:54] live in in
[1:17:56] flesh the gospel has never brought a
[1:17:59] separation between you and God if
[1:18:01] there's anything that brings anything
[1:18:04] and I know that's a poor representation
[1:18:06] but if there's anything that tries to
[1:18:08] come between you and God the message
[1:18:10] never brought it am that includes a
[1:18:13] man's idea when a man wants to try to
[1:18:16] start interpreting the message and say
[1:18:19] this is Brother bram's opinion that's
[1:18:20] brother bram's thought that's a
[1:18:23] veil what I do move the veil
[1:18:28] aside because that Veil is a
[1:18:32] scarecrow are you hearing me this
[1:18:35] message is either of God or it
[1:18:39] isn't if it's of God we owe our whole
[1:18:42] lives to
[1:18:43] it let me just tell you I'm trying to
[1:18:46] say it but it's hard to get it out but
[1:18:48] this word came that it could walk with
[1:18:51] you down the school Halls this word came
[1:18:54] that it could walk with you and live in
[1:18:56] your
[1:18:58] life those men had a burden John tendel
[1:19:02] John W William tendel forgive me man I
[1:19:04] get their names right when they had that
[1:19:06] burden that was a burden God put upon
[1:19:09] their life and that's the same burden
[1:19:11] and it's come in a greater measure in
[1:19:13] the end time that God sent a message
[1:19:16] that this word would take on
[1:19:19] flesh hallu
[1:19:22] Hallelujah that there's no more fails
[1:19:25] between you and

[1:20:19] put our faith and our confidence in the
[1:20:21] word of God you know what I'm talking
[1:20:24] about the denominations can say well

[1:22:04] rose from the dead his words were
[1:22:07] constantly fear not that's what's the

[1:22:28] I'm afraid I'll get
[1:22:30] fanatical I'd rather have a little
[1:22:32] fanaticism than to sit still and do
[1:22:35] [Applause]
[1:22:38] nothing come on friends I'd rather you
[1:22:41] know listen you can't just put it all

[1:22:45] Wildfire you also got to have the other
[1:22:47] set of quotes that says I would rather

[1:28:46] worry that if God is telling you that in
[1:28:49] your
[1:28:50] heart
[1:28:52] Hallelujah Don't You Love
[1:28:54] am glory be to God what are we doing
[1:28:57] overcoming
[1:28:58] worry in the message El Shai let me just
[1:29:01] read we drop this one we'll drop this
[1:29:03] one this is not leaflets to the enemy to
[1:29:05] surrender we're just dropping bombs now
[1:29:08] doing some Daisy cutter work on him
[1:29:10] people are scared out of the message El
[1:29:12] Shad ey oh if I I I I can't I'm afraid I
[1:29:16] might make a mistake make a mistake you
[1:29:19] can't don't do no worse than just to sit
[1:29:22] and do nothing about it get up and be
[1:29:25] going get the job done make some kind of
[1:29:28] an effort you've got to move oh I like
[1:29:30] this part when the Holy Spirit begins to
[1:29:33] move on a person he ought to walk with
[1:29:35] his shoulders back and his head up
[1:29:39] praising God CZ it's God's word it's God
[1:29:42] that spoke the word it's God that give
[1:29:44] the
[1:29:45] promise why don't we just stand and try
[1:29:47] that if God spoke to you you can put
[1:29:50] your shoulders back your head up oh I'm
[1:29:53] not a arant I know in whom I have
[1:29:56] believed he hadn't made me to be the
[1:29:58] tail he's made me to be the
[1:30:01] head God has spoke to my heart you see
[1:30:03] it ain't about us the word takes our
[1:30:06] vision away from us and puts it on him
[1:30:10] and when you get to looking at him you
[1:30:12] can see nothing but sure Victory because
[1:30:16] the word has promised Victory you never
[1:30:19] read in Joshua 1 a promise of defeat God
[1:30:22] never promised defeat and so when defeat
[1:30:25] happened when failure came along Joshua
[1:30:29] never questioned God he went and began
[1:30:31] to examine himself by the word he was so
[1:30:35] sure what God had said and God said I'll
[1:30:37] never fail you I'll never forsake you
[1:30:40] then Joshua knew God never left us
[1:30:43] somewhere we went away from him but he
[1:30:46] said everywhere our foot would tread he
[1:30:50] give it to us and Joshua went to God and
[1:30:54] God restored hallelujah amen why the
[1:30:58] same God that can lead you in Victory
[1:31:01] through your battles amen is the same
[1:31:04] God when you put his word first will
[1:31:06] bring you right back on course amen if
[1:31:08] you get off course it'll bring you right
[1:31:10] back on why we're following him we're
[1:31:15] following him you see that's what the
[1:31:16] grace of God let's stand that's what the
[1:31:18] grace of God comes to do and work in our
[1:31:21] lives is to get our our
[1:31:24] attention from off
[1:31:27] ourselves and on him looking unto Jesus
[1:31:30] the author and the finisher of our
[1:31:34] faith I I I know it's real simple and I
[1:31:36] don't it don't bother me a bit I I just
[1:31:39] I I like to preach the things that God
[1:31:41] puts on my heart that I know will help
[1:31:43] help his children and we look at things
[1:31:46] in overcoming
[1:31:48] worry I don't think there's anything
[1:31:50] greater that God could do than to make
[1:31:53] his word
[1:31:55] real and more real and more sure and
[1:31:58] there's no way to make his word more
[1:32:00] sure than when that word is inside of
[1:32:03] you that's what you that's what you rest
[1:32:05] on remember God he made his word three
[1:32:09] times he's raised that word made it
[1:32:11] positive he spoke it then that word
[1:32:14] became flesh and now that word is living
[1:32:17] behind your Veil yes sir God makes his
[1:32:21] word more positive all the time
[1:32:25] and that's how he raises the standard
[1:32:27] against the enemy so no matter even here
[1:32:30] tonight no matter of where you might be
[1:32:32] standing I want you to know that the
[1:32:34] holy spirit is here to stand on your
[1:32:38] behalf and I want you understand that
[1:32:40] that a walk with God in a Christian life
[1:32:43] is not about that you in your own life
[1:32:46] are perfect now that don't mean that we
[1:32:48] just you understand that we're not
[1:32:50] talking about people who get around and
[1:32:52] say well I can't get over this or I
[1:32:53] can't get over this no there is a place
[1:32:56] of
[1:32:57] overcoming and there is there is a place
[1:33:00] that where you can you can so move in
[1:33:02] God to where you can
[1:33:04] overcome and there is maybe there's
[1:33:06] things that you're dealing with maybe
[1:33:08] maybe it's physically maybe it's
[1:33:09] mentally maybe within your heart you say
[1:33:11] brother Samuel I've I crossed the Riven
[1:33:14] Veil where the where the glories never
[1:33:16] fail but I'm experiencing some things in
[1:33:19] my
[1:33:20] life that I need the grace of God for
[1:33:24] and I need his
[1:33:26] strength and I believe I'm an
[1:33:28] overcomer I believe greater is he that's
[1:33:31] in me than he that's in the world maybe
[1:33:34] you've experienced some news maybe it's
[1:33:37] been some depression maybe it's been
[1:33:40] anxiety maybe there's been some things
[1:33:41] that comes and the enemy wants to just
[1:33:43] torment you in your mind I'm telling you
[1:33:45] there there's an overcoming for that
[1:33:48] there's an overcoming but first of all
[1:33:50] you got you got to recognize don't let
[1:33:52] the enemy start putting you down because
[1:33:55] of what you're feeling in this
[1:33:59] realm you're going to experience things
[1:34:01] in this
[1:34:02] realm but this is why the Bible said
[1:34:05] perfect love casteth out all fear fear
[1:34:11] can come but perfect love says you can't
[1:34:14] stay
[1:34:15] here you can't stay
[1:34:19] here I belong to him
[1:34:22] amen God moving in your heart whatever
[1:34:25] the need is when God's moving remember
[1:34:28] hold your head up right the king of
[1:34:31] glory
[1:34:33] himself has stepped down to speak to
[1:34:35] your heart you can hold your head up
[1:34:38] shoulders back as a son of the king a
[1:34:42] daughter of the
[1:34:43] king you might say brother Samuel I
[1:34:45] don't feel like much of one no no but
[1:34:48] look what the word is saying about you
[1:34:51] that's right brother Samuel I I know I
[1:34:54] need more of God in my life I need a
[1:34:56] deeper walk I need I Lord I need the
[1:35:00] Holy Spirit Well then don't be
[1:35:03] afraid keep
[1:35:05] walking you see God listen a pastor
[1:35:09] cannot bring you in
[1:35:12] condition no man can bring you into
[1:35:15] condition but
[1:35:17] God God's the one who brought Abraham
[1:35:20] and Sarah in condition to receive the
[1:35:23] oncoming
[1:35:25] son that's why the confidence my
[1:35:28] confidence I'm telling you is in the
[1:35:31] word of
[1:35:32] God because the word in the beginning
[1:35:34] when the conditions were
[1:35:36] needed for
[1:35:38] life God spoke and he said let there be
[1:35:42] light and the first light that ever
[1:35:45] struck this Earth was the shikina light
[1:35:48] of almighty
[1:35:49] God it was the shikina light that broke
[1:35:53] back the the darkness that's so good it
[1:35:55] was shikina light that moved to separate
[1:35:59] it his
[1:36:01] word is there to change the
[1:36:04] conditions so that what conditions are
[1:36:07] needed to be met I can't me it on my own
[1:36:11] but God's word will bring and create the
[1:36:14] conditions that's needed for him to
[1:36:16] fulfill his word thank you Father that's
[1:36:19] why that even in every service listen
[1:36:21] friends I got confidence that God there
[1:36:23] could be somebody walk off the street
[1:36:25] right here tonight and God could take
[1:36:27] everything right here tonight fully
[1:36:30] baptize that that person right into the
[1:36:32] body of Jesus Christ it's it's a paradox
[1:36:35] then there might be someone that maybe
[1:36:38] just been coming service after service
[1:36:39] but they're making
[1:36:42] footsteps and there's a desire within
[1:36:44] their heart to serve
[1:36:47] God that's why we don't we don't
[1:36:50] judge one another we don't Jud judge I
[1:36:54] don't take my experience and judge you
[1:36:57] because God works with you in a personal
[1:36:59] way because you know when it's all said
[1:37:01] and done you're the one that's got to
[1:37:03] have that confidence that I've met God
[1:37:06] God speaking to my life you see that's
[1:37:08] where it goes beyond that of a words of
[1:37:10] a man it's not a man telling you you
[1:37:12] know God speaking to your heart you know
[1:37:16] that it's God dealing with your life you
[1:37:17] know that the word's Discerning your
[1:37:19] heart that's why you're not walking on a
[1:37:21] false confidence you're walking on the
[1:37:24] confidence of his word his voice that
[1:37:28] has breathed inspiration into your life
[1:37:32] it's
[1:37:33] God and God's creating the conditions
[1:37:36] that's needed even right here tonight
[1:37:39] yes he whatever the need is in your life
[1:37:43] whether it's for the Holy Ghost whether
[1:37:45] it's to overcome in some some area of
[1:37:48] your life maybe it's to overcome and lay
[1:37:51] aside a weight something that's been
[1:37:53] slow you
[1:37:54] down maybe it's a besetting
[1:37:57] sin but you know what his grace is
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:03] sufficient let me just tell you tonight
[1:38:05] you're more than a
[1:38:07] conqueror through him who loved
[1:38:12] you I can do all things through him who
[1:38:16] strengtheneth me he's here to energize
[1:38:20] your
