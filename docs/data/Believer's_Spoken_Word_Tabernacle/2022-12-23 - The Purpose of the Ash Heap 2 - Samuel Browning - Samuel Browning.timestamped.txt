[38:03] Lord you know what we have need of may
[38:06] you minister to every need Lord that's
[38:09] gathered here Lord
[38:11] granted Lord
[38:13] in the name of Jesus Christ
[38:16] amen
[38:19] amen isn't it wonderful to be in his
[38:20] presence
[38:22] it's just wonderful to be amen gathered
[38:24] together with one another and
[38:27] just a precious time that God has given
[38:30] us
[38:31] we want to look in the scripture thank
[38:33] you musicians amen we want to look in
[38:36] the scriptures here this evening once
[38:38] again and I'm going to go right into
[38:40] verse 23 of Job chapter 19.
[38:43] and I want to just the Lord will help us
[38:46] just to try to resume of where we were
[38:50] last week and looking at this thought on
[38:53] the purpose
[38:55] of the ash Heap
[38:59] Job chapter 19 and verse 23.
[39:04] job says all that my words were now
[39:08] written
[39:09] and all that they were printed in a book
[39:13] that they were Graven with an iron pin
[39:16] and led in the rock forever
[39:20] for I know that my redeemer liveth
[39:25] and that he shall stand at the latter
[39:28] day upon the Earth
[39:31] once you notice that in verse 25 very
[39:33] familiar scripture to us I realize that
[39:35] you as I said to you before you can't
[39:38] listen to yours you'd be hard-pressed to
[39:41] find a message
[39:42] that you would not listen to that you
[39:45] will not hear this referenced this
[39:47] particular scripture but I want you to
[39:50] notice it all comes back down to there's
[39:52] a certainty I know that my redeemer
[39:56] liveth and that he shall stand at the
[40:00] latter day upon the Earth
[40:02] and though after my skin worms destroy
[40:05] this body
[40:06] yet in my flesh shall I see God
[40:12] whom I shall see for myself and mine
[40:15] eyes Shall Behold and not another though
[40:19] my Reigns be consumed within me amen may
[40:24] God bless you bless the reading of the
[40:25] word as you're being seated
[40:29] we begin to look at that last weekend
[40:32] examining that of the
[40:34] Ash Heap and you find that that phrasing
[40:37] as we were looking at it
[40:39] that the phrase itself Ash Heap will not
[40:43] of it doesn't appear like that but we
[40:45] know it when you go to look it up it was
[40:49] refers to that of a of a dunghill and a
[40:51] dunghill is that which is a it's an ash
[40:54] Heath and here it comes from the place
[40:56] to where job when he had been Afflicted
[41:00] in his body
[41:01] and he was sitting set down the Bible
[41:04] says among the ashes and he was scraping
[41:07] the boils where he had been Afflicted in
[41:10] his body and we've we've looked at this
[41:11] for at some point in some time of the
[41:15] afflictions and where that job was at
[41:17] within this trial and as we looked at
[41:20] this within the ashifit refers and I
[41:22] said moments ago to the dunghill it was
[41:24] also a place where the refuse or the
[41:28] garbage was dumped it was known as a
[41:31] place that
[41:33] um in Jerusalem they had the dung gate
[41:35] and the dung gate was that which led to
[41:37] the Kidron Valley and that's where they
[41:40] would carry out the ashes and the dung
[41:41] of the animals and they would do it in
[41:44] that through that gate and put it into
[41:46] that place so that the winds themselves
[41:48] would actually take the stench and all
[41:51] of that and take it away instead of
[41:52] bringing it back in to the city you know
[41:55] the scriptures themselves and everything
[41:57] you know this is why brother Brown could
[42:00] say it so clearly if you read the Bible
[42:02] and do not see Christ in every verse go
[42:06] back and read it again because you
[42:07] missed something
[42:08] because in everything that was being
[42:10] done it was a significance and a
[42:13] testimony because if on this in this
[42:16] asheep it was a a less than desirable
[42:19] place to be and I'll say it like this
[42:21] without the holy ghost coming and
[42:24] drawing Upon Our Lives we would never
[42:27] have come to the realization of the
[42:29] asheep that we were born in
[42:32] as a matter of fact this life as I read
[42:35] that quote to you last week that this
[42:37] life at its best is a smoldering dump
[42:43] that's the that's that's at its best and
[42:46] so but took God coming to bring you and
[42:48] I to that realization and what that
[42:51] realization is is to where how the holy
[42:53] spirit will work and sometimes it's you
[42:55] know a period of time and the life just
[42:57] starts to surrender and you know there's
[42:59] a dying out that has to take place in a
[43:02] life before there can ever be a new
[43:04] birth there's got to be a dying out and
[43:06] the Holy Spirit he comes to work on our
[43:09] lives to bring us to that place to where
[43:11] we can stand there and realize that you
[43:14] know there I don't want anything to do
[43:17] with this world not just that we're
[43:19] there in a condition of well I don't
[43:21] like this that's going on or I don't
[43:23] like this but you know all of that works
[43:25] and sometimes it's a it's a process
[43:27] sometimes dying itself it's a slow
[43:30] process and sometimes even when
[43:32] sometimes to watch and situations going
[43:35] on but you know God is leading that
[43:37] process God is the one that leads each
[43:40] and every one of us into that place of a
[43:42] real experience with with him and it
[43:44] requires dying out until you know how it
[43:47] was in our lives until we came to a
[43:49] place to where we were sick and tired of
[43:53] being us
[43:54] Jacob had to get to a place he is tired
[43:57] of being Jacob
[43:58] and until he got to that place there
[44:00] could never come a change
[44:02] but you see that's an ash sheep as well
[44:04] God brings us to that place of death to
[44:07] where we recognize that I need the mercy
[44:10] of God and then through that
[44:12] resurrection power it lifts us above the
[44:15] stench and the filth of the world and
[44:19] you see this is God's grace to you and I
[44:21] because he's lifted every one of us as
[44:24] Believers from the ash heap of sin and
[44:27] unbelief that we were born in He Has
[44:30] Lifted us because remember contamination
[44:33] is all around but God has come in his
[44:36] grace to lift us out of that stench to
[44:39] lift our lives and transport us into the
[44:43] Beloved when we're safe when we're
[44:45] secure and this is the part that is just
[44:48] tremendous that the prevailing winds of
[44:51] the holy spirit that has brought that
[44:54] change within our life it continues to
[44:57] drive away all the stench and the filth
[44:59] of the world
[45:01] because it's God who comes in our life
[45:03] to drive all of that away and here we
[45:06] are we're setting in a place that we are
[45:09] redeemed we're not of the world we've
[45:11] been born again by the spirit of God
[45:13] that is from heaven and we find job in
[45:16] this situation
[45:19] and what job was looking for is the same
[45:22] thing that you and I look for job in
[45:25] this situation he's sitting there and
[45:28] he's looking for consolation he's
[45:30] looking for Comfort he's looking for
[45:33] something to give him courage
[45:35] you see he's looking for there there
[45:38] would be something around and there's
[45:39] nothing from any other source that's
[45:42] coming to giving comfort
[45:45] as a matter of fact the test itself is
[45:49] coming from every angle it's not just
[45:52] that his children were taken that was
[45:54] that was that was bad it wasn't just
[45:57] that is all of the his possessions were
[46:00] you know what he had in riches were
[46:02] taken it wasn't just that his his health
[46:05] was taken but then he has that of his
[46:08] wife he has that of his friends the very
[46:11] ground that job is standing on he's
[46:14] being tested on whether or not that this
[46:18] is real ground that he's standing on
[46:21] he's being tested on the Revelation that
[46:25] he holds in his heart
[46:27] you know everything that we claim in God
[46:29] we have to prove and it isn't that we
[46:32] have to prove it
[46:33] but it Satan makes us prove that
[46:37] everything that you and I confess and
[46:39] you say well brother Samuel then I'm not
[46:41] going to confess but you're not
[46:43] confessing by Your Own Strength we are
[46:45] confessing of what Jesus Christ is and
[46:49] what he has done and as he has revealed
[46:51] himself to us tests are going to come
[46:53] but the same God that inspires you to
[46:56] speak is the same God who will back it
[46:58] up
[47:00] it's not up to you or I to try to figure
[47:02] out how is this going to be but we stand
[47:05] there on that word and say God this is
[47:07] what you said and I'm saying what you've
[47:10] said
[47:11] so we're trying when none of us are any
[47:13] different when we come into these places
[47:15] that we we we desire to be comforted and
[47:19] to to receive encouragement I don't know
[47:22] about you but when I've come into the
[47:24] moments and sometimes we don't even
[47:25] recognize we're in an ashy we don't even
[47:28] recognize we're in a test or in a trial
[47:30] but there's been times that even
[47:32] throughout the day it might be a day
[47:34] that you're looking forward to there can
[47:36] be things I'm looking forward to I'm
[47:38] looking forward to getting in this vein
[47:40] of thought and so forth but there are
[47:42] times that even within that when you
[47:44] wake up you find yourself I need to go
[47:48] and find a source of strength and of
[47:51] courage
[47:52] anybody know what I'm talking about
[47:54] because there's Gloom that's all around
[47:56] and there's no even when there's no
[47:59] reason to feel gloomy
[48:01] and sometimes with situations come and
[48:04] you know what is it there's something in
[48:06] you that tells you there is a place of
[48:10] strength and courage there's a place
[48:13] that I can put my foot on and I'm
[48:15] talking about you've got an experience
[48:17] in your life but you know how it is when
[48:19] God his presence just comes down and he
[48:22] quickens a word to your life and it just
[48:25] does something to you at that moment it
[48:27] energizes you
[48:30] that's true
[48:32] got a situation here or something in
[48:34] here I don't know if I'll get to it but
[48:36] even when brother Branham was receiving
[48:37] strength and encouragement from his new
[48:40] ministry the Holy Spirit even directed
[48:43] him to words that General Patton and
[48:46] general Eisenhower Miss said and the
[48:48] Holy Spirit directed him even in those
[48:51] places and you say this is the thing it
[48:54] wasn't that those men were spiritual but
[48:56] how the Holy Spirit took those things
[48:58] that were being spoken at that time like
[49:01] Patton says brother Brown said my mind
[49:03] he's hearing a minister on the radio
[49:05] mentioned these things that Patton said
[49:08] don't send me no boys over here I want
[49:10] men
[49:11] I don't want cowards over here people
[49:13] that are afraid to die send me men
[49:16] said something begin to grip my heart
[49:18] and speak to me and he said I've talked
[49:21] oh I remembered what general Eisenhower
[49:23] had said if if I got a if I have put a
[49:26] bullet in the gun and he don't go off
[49:28] but I'm not going to throw down my gun I
[49:30] just take that bullet out and put
[49:31] another one in and I'm going to keep
[49:33] doing it until there's a bullet that
[49:35] fires off he was talking about the new
[49:37] ministry that was moving in in his life
[49:39] and he's recognizing God is speaking to
[49:43] his life to encourage him that I don't
[49:46] know how it's going to be but I know
[49:49] that God said he'd be with me
[49:53] I may have to cover those points here
[49:55] just again but we'll just see you know
[49:57] we need we need encouragement and I I
[50:00] believe that's what we come together for
[50:02] in times like this we come together for
[50:05] encouragement don't we that's why I come
[50:08] to the house of God I come to the house
[50:10] of God not just that my weaknesses would
[50:12] be made known I've Got Confidence in
[50:14] that and I'm grateful for that my flesh
[50:16] doesn't like it but I'm grateful for
[50:18] that because I need to grow I I need to
[50:20] know what I need to be what not only
[50:22] where my weakness is but where do I need
[50:24] to be where do I need to be called away
[50:27] to and I also I need to be in comforted
[50:31] I need to be strengthened I need to be
[50:34] encouraged not that when I leave out of
[50:38] here am I expecting that the test or the
[50:41] trial is going to be gone you know you
[50:43] can set in service and just have in your
[50:46] mind and say well I know it's still
[50:47] going to be there when I get home I know
[50:49] it's they're going to be and you can
[50:50] miss what God has for you
[50:53] but instead it's going to be there but
[50:55] God I need strength for this moment I
[51:00] need sufficient Grace because I'm
[51:02] looking at that I know that's fair but I
[51:05] don't want to face it On My Own Strength
[51:07] I'm here for refreshing from the
[51:10] presence of the Lord he's my redeemer
[51:14] amen this is what job is saying I know
[51:16] my redeemer liveth
[51:20] in other words this life this is this
[51:24] I'm not confined to this here but I have
[51:27] one in whom I belong to I have one that
[51:31] that is liveth to redeem me this is why
[51:34] David could even utter the words bless
[51:38] the Lord O my soul and all that is
[51:40] within me and forget not his benefits
[51:43] he's the Lord that be that that that
[51:46] that that that that brings about
[51:48] forgiveness for all that iniquities
[51:50] heals on my diseases redeems my life
[51:54] from destruction I could say Amen to
[51:56] that who crowneth thee with loving
[51:59] kindness and Tender Mercies who
[52:01] satisfies thy mouth with good things
[52:03] sold that thy youth is renewed like the
[52:08] eagles so we come here we need
[52:10] refreshing from the presence of the Lord
[52:13] we need renewing we need those moments
[52:16] of of reprieve from God's presence and
[52:19] you know think about it job job had
[52:22] personally he had personally heard from
[52:24] God he he knew where he was standing but
[52:27] job did not understand what was going on
[52:30] job did not understand that he was even
[52:33] in a trial
[52:34] he didn't have that understanding but
[52:37] yet he was a prophet
[52:38] and yet it goes on this was said that
[52:41] God God could have broke in in any place
[52:45] and let job know what was taking place
[52:49] but it wasn't necessary
[52:52] that God would have job to understand it
[52:55] at that time because it shows that faith
[52:59] alone is sufficient to guide and direct
[53:03] us through every obstacle that the
[53:05] greatest thing that you and I could have
[53:07] is faith because faith is not something
[53:10] that you and I understand but faith is
[53:13] what is revealed to you and I it's a
[53:15] strength within our life to where when
[53:17] you can't explain things and I can't
[53:19] explain things but I know that beyond
[53:21] the clouds God is still there though the
[53:25] clouds are dark though the skies are
[53:27] gloomy but God is still God behind those
[53:30] clouds
[53:32] glory be to God now I want you to think
[53:36] of this here in this moment in second
[53:38] Corinthians chapter four The these these
[53:41] scriptures just just bless me when you
[53:43] think about it
[53:45] the Bible said we have this treasure in
[53:47] Earthen vessels that the Excellency of
[53:50] the power may be of God and not of us
[53:53] we are troubled on every side yet not
[53:57] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[54:01] despair
[54:02] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[54:06] but not destroyed I want you to catch
[54:08] this here you know what Joe you know
[54:10] what Paul is speaking this is a positive
[54:13] confession
[54:16] yes there's negative circumstances
[54:19] that's all around and there will be
[54:22] but there's a positive confession
[54:26] there's a positive testimony
[54:29] that's why brother Brandon when you you
[54:31] can just type it in you'll find it 17
[54:33] times in the message there never have a
[54:37] negative testimony
[54:42] you know that's a battle
[54:46] that doesn't mean that we're to
[54:47] compromise on it we are tested on that
[54:52] amen We Fear Paul Paul is letting us
[54:55] know all of this is all around
[54:58] but in the midst of it I am not in
[55:02] despair
[55:05] you see this is here's the secret if we
[55:08] could interview Paul we can ask Paul
[55:11] Paul what's the secret behind your
[55:13] confession and Paul would tell you that
[55:16] in the midst of this time I've learned
[55:19] not to complain when the tests or trials
[55:22] are going on I might start to but I
[55:24] recognized if I can just get into his
[55:27] presence
[55:29] and draw strength from him there's a
[55:32] confession that comes forth
[55:36] we got quiet
[55:39] our flesh complains
[55:42] right
[55:43] it complains our flesh does not like
[55:46] this was not Paul's flesh this was not
[55:49] Paul's standing up in the church and
[55:51] people saying well Paul's In the Flesh
[55:53] Paul was not in the flesh he's
[55:56] confessing a positive confession
[56:03] maybe before Paul maybe come to the
[56:07] platform or maybe when Paul if you could
[56:09] have seen earlier in the week maybe
[56:10] there was some complaining that was
[56:12] going on at first when it struck come on
[56:15] they were they're men and men of like
[56:17] passion subject as we are I can bring
[56:19] you a quote with brother Branham in that
[56:21] same place I'm talking about where
[56:22] brother Brown said here I am I'm
[56:23] battling the sinus infection's not going
[56:26] away and what God was trying to get him
[56:28] to do is to accept the new ministry that
[56:30] he confirmed to him and brother Branham
[56:33] here they are they're bringing him
[56:34] antibiotics the brothers are coming and
[56:35] praying for him and brother Brown said
[56:37] the sinus infection isn't budging a butt
[56:39] a bit and I can't even speak to nobody
[56:42] he was so hoarse he couldn't even speak
[56:45] to anybody and he said I got to a place
[56:48] after them brothers left I called media
[56:50] over to me imagine here the prophet of
[56:52] God saying this and he calls meaty over
[56:54] to him and he says you know what
[56:56] sometimes I doubt even whether I'm
[56:58] called or not
[57:01] oh my goodness
[57:03] I don't know about you that don't bother
[57:05] me a bit those kind of things like that
[57:06] I can follow a man like that because
[57:08] that's real
[57:10] you know what that that's that flesh
[57:12] that DNA but there was something greater
[57:14] than the DNA and I'll Branham that
[57:16] brought this message it was Jesus Christ
[57:19] hello him came down and spoke through
[57:23] this ministry is that right
[57:25] so in the midst of it it shows you and I
[57:28] that we can get down we can get in that
[57:31] place but over in the room so thank God
[57:33] for a wife that's a real help me where
[57:35] sister meaty looked at him and said you
[57:37] ought to be ashamed of yourself for even
[57:40] saying that
[57:41] I'd say she ain't like job's wife that
[57:43] was a real one weren't you
[57:45] a real help man you ought to be ashamed
[57:47] of yourself well I don't know if we're
[57:49] going to be able to do this and I don't
[57:50] know oh my but a real helpmate is there
[57:52] to do what encourage
[57:58] mm-hmm
[58:00] oh my I love it when it gets right down
[58:03] to where you can put it in The Lunchbox
[58:04] don't you
[58:06] notice in verse 10 always
[58:09] bearing about in the body
[58:13] the dying of the Lord Jesus always
[58:15] always that the life also of Jesus might
[58:19] be made manifest in our body so there's
[58:23] always the bearing about in the body the
[58:26] dying why that his life might be made
[58:29] manifest for we which live are always
[58:33] delivered unto death for Jesus sake that
[58:37] the life also of Jesus might be made
[58:40] manifest in our mortal flesh so the
[58:45] whole purpose of everything is that that
[58:47] life itself would be made manifest in
[58:50] the only way that that can be manifest
[58:53] is for us to die more to ourselves
[59:00] and I don't know about you but you know
[59:02] I I just say this about I'll just say
[59:03] it's about me I can say you know Lord I
[59:06] Need To Die more but there's things that
[59:07] God has done and he's taken me through
[59:10] and showed me that I I would have never
[59:13] signed up for it
[59:14] and I never would have thought I needed
[59:16] to die in certain areas
[59:19] maybe I'm just speaking for myself
[59:20] tonight y'all can just pray for me but I
[59:22] realize there's certain things that
[59:29] it was all about me dying more to myself
[59:35] it had nothing to do with with anybody
[59:37] else or anything it had more it had to
[59:39] do
[59:42] now look you know job knows he knows my
[59:46] redeemer liveth but this is the greatest
[59:47] Vision Brother Brad would call it it's
[59:49] the greatest Vision that that had been
[59:51] given because Daniel saw the angel the
[59:54] Hebrew children saw the Son of God Noah
[59:56] saw the rainbow Abraham seen God face to
[59:58] face but job saw the resurrection all
[1:00:02] the Patriarchs all the saints they had
[1:00:03] looked forward to that day with an
[1:00:05] assurance through their Visions through
[1:00:06] the revelations that there would come
[1:00:08] that time of a resurrection but job he
[1:00:12] actually saw it and to think you know
[1:00:14] Billy Brown would say it like this he
[1:00:16] says they have to have
[1:00:19] I have to have a crucifixion
[1:00:21] how many knows what a crucifixion is we
[1:00:23] know we can say well you know the Lord
[1:00:25] Jesus was crucified but you know it's
[1:00:27] one of the slowest deaths
[1:00:29] there's nothing instant about it
[1:00:32] it's just slow
[1:00:35] it's just slow
[1:00:38] and they have to have a crucifixion now
[1:00:40] watch out brother Brahman is bringing
[1:00:41] this before you can have a resurrection
[1:00:44] before the church will ever be able to
[1:00:47] see a resurrected power
[1:00:50] before I can ever see a new ministry
[1:00:53] he's talking about the third pool take
[1:00:55] place myself
[1:00:56] and before you can enter into a new
[1:00:58] fellowship with God there's got to be a
[1:01:02] self-crucifixion so there can come a
[1:01:06] resurrection
[1:01:08] let me just lay on this here just a
[1:01:10] moment this is where we're getting to
[1:01:12] the purpose here of of the ashy we've
[1:01:14] got to die out to our own thoughts
[1:01:17] die out to our own ways die out to
[1:01:20] everything that's around us and go
[1:01:23] through the trials and tribulations that
[1:01:25] we might see a new Resurrection a new
[1:01:28] life now he's talking to us as Believers
[1:01:30] then he breaks over and he says before a
[1:01:32] sinner can never become a Christian
[1:01:34] there's got to be a death then a
[1:01:36] resurrection before Abraham could see
[1:01:39] Elohim there had to be 25 years of
[1:01:41] testing before the Hebrew children could
[1:01:44] see the Son of God they had to go into
[1:01:46] the fiery furnace before Daniel could
[1:01:48] see an angel he had to go the Lion's Den
[1:01:50] before job could ever see the
[1:01:52] resurrection he had to go in and lose
[1:01:54] everything he had and then by Vision he
[1:01:57] saw
[1:01:59] brother Brown says if job could stand so
[1:02:01] firmly Upon A Promise how much more we
[1:02:04] ought to do after Christ is raised from
[1:02:05] the dead and become the first first
[1:02:07] fruits of them that slept and he sent
[1:02:09] back the Holy Spirit as a seal of
[1:02:10] Promise upon us that because I live you
[1:02:13] shall live also seeing his great
[1:02:16] presence among us working and doing the
[1:02:19] same signs and wonders that he did on
[1:02:21] Earth giving us the hope so notice
[1:02:24] brother Brahm is bringing that down we
[1:02:26] are seeing as here we are coming
[1:02:29] together the testimonies that that are
[1:02:31] among us we are seeing the same
[1:02:34] resurrection power his great presence
[1:02:38] Among Us it gives us hopes you know what
[1:02:41] hope is it's expectation
[1:02:44] that's why even as well said we come to
[1:02:46] the house of God there should be an
[1:02:48] expectation when we do come to the house
[1:02:51] of God now you may not be sitting in a
[1:02:53] trial you may not be sitting in a place
[1:02:55] of a test right now within this moment
[1:02:57] but God knows what you and I have need
[1:03:00] of he knows what is even coming down the
[1:03:02] road
[1:03:04] and God is working not only to encourage
[1:03:07] us he's there to prepare us he's there
[1:03:09] to strengthen you and I there is so much
[1:03:12] of the multifaceted approach of almighty
[1:03:15] God of how God is dealing with so many
[1:03:18] needs within just one service and
[1:03:20] brother Graham says now if we see that
[1:03:23] right Among Us let's get off the ash
[1:03:26] heat today with a new vision with a new
[1:03:29] power with a new determination because
[1:03:31] we see God in his power and we see the
[1:03:35] resurrection of the things that are
[1:03:37] coming so before any of these great
[1:03:40] Revelations could come there had to be a
[1:03:42] trial to go through
[1:03:45] so the revelations of even how God will
[1:03:49] make himself more real to you and I even
[1:03:52] coming that for there to be more like
[1:03:55] brother Graham says as I'm coming to
[1:03:56] that new ministry and he says even in
[1:03:59] that of for you and I to enter into a
[1:04:02] new fellowship with God I'd say every
[1:04:04] one of us would say Lord I want to be I
[1:04:08] want to be closer to you
[1:04:10] I want more of you I want more of God
[1:04:13] and with that in order for there to be
[1:04:16] more of God it's got to be less of me
[1:04:20] now I'll be honest my flesh when my
[1:04:23] flesh because the reasoning part will
[1:04:24] kick in and say wait a minute we're not
[1:04:26] signing up for a trial
[1:04:30] you might but I ain't
[1:04:33] right because this flesh is a pest house
[1:04:37] this this flesh wants things easy
[1:04:41] this flesh is weak
[1:04:44] it's Earth and vessel when I say flesh
[1:04:46] I'm talking about not just the body I'm
[1:04:49] talking about the spirit
[1:04:52] right the mind all of those parts they
[1:04:55] it wants things the easy way
[1:04:59] but there's a part that is there on the
[1:05:02] inside of us that as we're looking to
[1:05:04] God and we can see Lord I need more of
[1:05:07] you it's God stirring that up in our
[1:05:09] lives I want more of God I need more of
[1:05:14] God in my life
[1:05:16] but you know
[1:05:18] when we come to the ash heaps
[1:05:20] as I said sometimes we don't realize
[1:05:23] that were on the Ashy and we're praying
[1:05:27] I don't know about you but have been
[1:05:28] times as I've been I prayed and asked
[1:05:32] God help me to keep the right attitude
[1:05:34] I'm just going to be real
[1:05:35] help me to keep the right attitude Lord
[1:05:38] because you see thoughts can come our
[1:05:40] way
[1:05:41] feelings our feet listen when the Holy
[1:05:44] Ghost come he didn't do away with your
[1:05:45] feelings
[1:05:47] feelings are still there
[1:05:49] things can come our way it may be with
[1:05:51] even with sickness and even with disease
[1:05:54] and sometimes in the midst of it we have
[1:05:57] to pray God help me to stay focused in
[1:05:59] the right way help me Lord that I
[1:06:02] maintain the right attitude because
[1:06:04] thoughts can come your way but remember
[1:06:07] you can't stop the birds from flying
[1:06:09] over
[1:06:10] but it's to take that double barrel
[1:06:12] shotgun and blast them because what are
[1:06:15] you doing you can't find a roosting
[1:06:17] place here
[1:06:20] right
[1:06:21] we're going to be offended because we've
[1:06:23] also offended other people
[1:06:25] we're disappointed we've been
[1:06:27] disappointed and we've disappointed
[1:06:28] other people right
[1:06:30] sometimes it's even in the midst of
[1:06:32] those situations that we can look and
[1:06:34] say oh my this person or my boss or or
[1:06:38] this or that and we can look at those
[1:06:40] things and yet it isn't about them
[1:06:43] right listen what are you saying I'm
[1:06:45] saying that will stay on the ash Heap
[1:06:49] until we realize
[1:06:51] that that person
[1:06:54] is not the problem
[1:06:56] it's what's causing flare-ups in US
[1:06:59] it's what's agitating us
[1:07:01] whoo
[1:07:05] oh Lord
[1:07:07] you know it's like we want free agency
[1:07:08] for our friends
[1:07:10] we need free agency we want to trade
[1:07:13] people and get other people in and do
[1:07:16] this and do that and man if we don't
[1:07:18] like you know everything is just so used
[1:07:19] to it's like with the social media
[1:07:21] befriend befriend befriend and man if
[1:07:23] this ain't posting this befriend a new
[1:07:25] friend that's easy to do on social media
[1:07:30] getting down home aren't we
[1:07:33] but sometimes the situations we're
[1:07:35] brought into
[1:07:37] we're asking and Lord I'm praying
[1:07:39] brother Samuel I'm praying but I don't
[1:07:42] feel like I'm getting any stronger but
[1:07:43] it's how are we praying
[1:07:45] are we are we recognizing that the ash
[1:07:48] sheep is a place for us to die
[1:07:52] God I need to die more to myself this
[1:07:55] trial is not about anybody else or this
[1:07:57] situation my boss or this it ain't about
[1:07:59] nobody else it's about Lord I Need To
[1:08:02] Die to myself brother Brandon with that
[1:08:04] sinus condition that was going on in his
[1:08:07] body and God was letting him know this
[1:08:10] reason this is going on people are
[1:08:12] coming and praying for you laying hands
[1:08:15] on you the doctors are giving you
[1:08:16] antibiotics but God said I'm keeping you
[1:08:19] on this ash Heap until you accept what I
[1:08:23] have Vindicated already
[1:08:25] now think about how the prophet stood
[1:08:27] there in the message go tell
[1:08:29] and he stands there right after that and
[1:08:31] he says what it is I'm afraid of defeat
[1:08:34] I'm afraid of failing that I would step
[1:08:39] out there and it wouldn't happen
[1:08:42] you realize how God is working with the
[1:08:46] prophet's life
[1:08:47] brother Graham said God knows how to
[1:08:49] keep you on an ashy in referring to that
[1:08:51] situation until he's got the message
[1:08:54] across to you
[1:08:56] oh it sounds almost like us as parents
[1:08:59] sometimes you know when we can you know
[1:09:00] when the discipline comes the older they
[1:09:02] get well you know maybe it's not the
[1:09:03] belt and the timeouts anymore but man
[1:09:05] here comes the lectures and laying it
[1:09:07] out and laying everything else and it'll
[1:09:09] do no good anyhow but you know I mean
[1:09:10] the when it gets down the lectures they
[1:09:12] tune you out you know as they get older
[1:09:14] they let you know hey you know and you
[1:09:15] realize say Lord help me to be short
[1:09:17] sweet and to the point and may the Holy
[1:09:18] Ghost be there to punch it in
[1:09:20] [Laughter]
[1:09:23] but you realize that God knows how to
[1:09:26] hold us there until the message gets
[1:09:28] across to us
[1:09:30] because the whole message is about us
[1:09:32] dying and accepting and brother Branham
[1:09:35] brings that right back around for his
[1:09:37] own life in his own Ministry brother
[1:09:39] Brian said you know what it's like he
[1:09:40] said it would be like a man that has
[1:09:42] been sitting there he's read the word
[1:09:44] read the word read the word read the
[1:09:45] word heard the word preach heard the
[1:09:47] word preach heard the word preach he
[1:09:49] said and all of a sudden something just
[1:09:50] strikes him and he realized hey
[1:09:53] something's talking about me it's
[1:09:55] talking about me in the same message
[1:09:57] it's talking about me he said you know
[1:09:59] what finally happens with that man he
[1:10:01] accepts it what God has said about it he
[1:10:04] said that's exactly where I am with this
[1:10:07] new ministry I must accept what God has
[1:10:12] already confirmed
[1:10:13] now we're talking after Hattie Wright's
[1:10:16] house we're talking with all of this but
[1:10:19] you see God is moving the prophet into
[1:10:21] that face this is 1960. you will hear
[1:10:25] Brother Brown refer to this in 1961
[1:10:28] 1962. why there is a continual dying to
[1:10:32] William Bradham that Jesus Christ might
[1:10:35] be May manifest that's why brother Brown
[1:10:38] could tell Leo and Gene write it down in
[1:10:40] the book he said because the changing of
[1:10:43] the ministry going into the third poll
[1:10:46] will not be so much as a change in the
[1:10:48] ministry as it will be a change in me
[1:10:53] wow
[1:10:58] and to me this is just exactly where I
[1:11:01] believe that how God took the prophet
[1:11:03] that's the way he takes us
[1:11:05] that's the way he takes us right through
[1:11:08] the word of God it's God us yielding
[1:11:10] it's God doing the work it's us trusting
[1:11:13] the Lord
[1:11:15] and dying more and more to ourselves so
[1:11:18] here we are in this place think about
[1:11:21] how that even when you think of how with
[1:11:24] the crucifixion that you know the
[1:11:27] disciples after the event took place
[1:11:30] where the Lord Jesus was crucified
[1:11:33] think about it before the crucifixion he
[1:11:36] could not say all power in Heaven and
[1:11:39] Earth is given to me but after the
[1:11:41] resurrection
[1:11:42] after crucifixion come forth the
[1:11:44] resurrection then he could declare all
[1:11:47] power in Heaven and Earth is given unto
[1:11:49] me
[1:11:50] so it didn't lose power
[1:11:53] he gained power
[1:11:54] think about the disciples here they were
[1:11:57] they were so despondent they were so
[1:12:00] discouraged things had not happened the
[1:12:02] way that they thought they ought to
[1:12:04] happen they were crushed they were
[1:12:06] disappointed and the devil was working
[1:12:09] on them
[1:12:10] to do what bring them to an eye sheet
[1:12:13] and they came to an ashy but it was
[1:12:15] necessary for God to allow them to come
[1:12:18] to an asheep why
[1:12:21] that the resurrection might come forth
[1:12:23] to them
[1:12:24] but when they would see him
[1:12:27] it would stir their hearts in the
[1:12:29] promise
[1:12:31] that that would make known the promise
[1:12:33] to that it would encourage him it would
[1:12:34] take lives that were despondent that
[1:12:37] were disappointed that were crushed with
[1:12:39] all those events and it would encourage
[1:12:42] them in the promises of God think about
[1:12:46] brother Brandon would say it like this
[1:12:47] he says I remember in my own life he
[1:12:50] said on the road down to destruction
[1:12:52] when I heard a sweet voice say I'm Jesus
[1:12:54] I was once dead and I'm Alive
[1:12:56] forevermore and because I live you can
[1:12:58] live also and since that time putting my
[1:13:02] hand in his I've trusted him through the
[1:13:04] Dark Places when the times come where I
[1:13:07] can't see which way I'm going I still
[1:13:11] trust him
[1:13:14] Through The Dark Places places that I
[1:13:17] don't understand I still trust him Now
[1:13:20] watch how he says this every Christian
[1:13:22] believer has to be pushed into those
[1:13:26] trials
[1:13:28] I say Amen to that
[1:13:30] every Christian believer has to be put
[1:13:33] on their ashy so he can come forth with
[1:13:36] an experience I know my redeemer liveth
[1:13:43] not a historical Affair it's not
[1:13:46] something that we are are hoping and
[1:13:48] well it may be or it might be but I know
[1:13:51] like job could say I know my redeemer
[1:13:54] liveth this that reality of I know is
[1:13:57] the greatest revelation
[1:14:00] to our lives
[1:14:02] I know my redeemer liveth
[1:14:06] and I will see my redeemer who is your
[1:14:10] Redeemer job it's God God Is My Redeemer
[1:14:15] job had that Revelation even in that
[1:14:18] moment and it was even in that moment
[1:14:20] the prophet could tell us that the lamb
[1:14:23] that job had been offering up he saw at
[1:14:26] that moment what the lamb meant
[1:14:29] the lamb stepped forward in that moment
[1:14:32] job saw what the lamb was all about
[1:14:35] House of praise God I know my redeemer
[1:14:38] liveth John do you know what's going on
[1:14:40] I don't know what's going on but I know
[1:14:43] in whom I have believed
[1:14:46] I don't know everything that's taking
[1:14:48] place but I know my redeemer lives I
[1:14:51] know that he will bring me out I know
[1:14:53] that he will bring me forth
[1:14:58] God's working you know the Bible tells
[1:15:00] us that all things work together for the
[1:15:02] good to them who are the called yeah is
[1:15:06] that right yeah
[1:15:07] yeah everything they didn't say
[1:15:09] everything was good but it did say
[1:15:11] everything does work together for our
[1:15:12] good
[1:15:14] and God places us on the ashes in order
[1:15:17] to show his glory
[1:15:20] this is why when brother Branham you
[1:15:22] know if I could just take just a moment
[1:15:24] out no doubt we could go through here uh
[1:15:27] this evening as well when brother
[1:15:28] Graham's talking about 31 years of his
[1:15:30] life here he says I want to make my
[1:15:32] testimony this I've seen disappointments
[1:15:35] and they've seen disappointments
[1:15:38] I've seen the time I've asked for things
[1:15:41] cried for things begged for things and
[1:15:44] failed to get them
[1:15:47] anybody say yeah
[1:15:50] but look if I'll just wait patiently
[1:15:53] upon God
[1:15:54] then I know it works just exactly right
[1:15:57] it'll come out exactly right it does
[1:15:59] just exactly the right thing
[1:16:02] he goes in now in this same message when
[1:16:04] he lost his little Sharon Rose and
[1:16:07] brother random said that was one thing
[1:16:09] that stumbled me
[1:16:11] I said how can that be for the good how
[1:16:14] can it be for the good
[1:16:16] but months later
[1:16:18] I seen her standing in the beauty as a
[1:16:20] young girl
[1:16:21] and she was speaking to me standing by
[1:16:23] the side of that wagon I know that she
[1:16:26] would have lived he says this is what I
[1:16:29] know I know if she would have lived she
[1:16:31] might have turned out wrong
[1:16:35] God had to take her while she was tender
[1:16:38] and sweet I know I'll see her again I
[1:16:41] know I shall see her I know it Beyond
[1:16:43] any Shadow of Doubt
[1:16:46] he goes in talking about his wife he was
[1:16:49] 22 years old
[1:16:50] now that she was taken he said I didn't
[1:16:53] know what to do
[1:16:54] I'm just I I want to just this message
[1:16:57] here I've told you this message is 1960
[1:17:00] April uh the 17th is just titled I know
[1:17:04] it's just a short short message but I
[1:17:06] don't know how many times I've listened
[1:17:07] to it here over the months
[1:17:10] right after he makes that statement
[1:17:12] about Sharon Rose and his wife he said
[1:17:14] but today
[1:17:16] I know it was all working for my good
[1:17:20] he didn't understand it then
[1:17:23] well brother Samuel how did he get
[1:17:25] through it he trusted God
[1:17:29] it shows there's going to be things that
[1:17:31] you and I don't understand there's
[1:17:32] things that don't line up that how can
[1:17:35] this be for the good
[1:17:38] but in the midst of it
[1:17:40] has got to be a trust that I Trust You
[1:17:43] Lord
[1:17:45] and that becomes a confession I Trust
[1:17:48] You Lord
[1:17:49] I don't know what's going on I don't see
[1:17:52] this situation you and I have been in
[1:17:54] situations things that you cannot just
[1:17:57] reach out and physically remove or turn
[1:18:00] around or a few words make it go away
[1:18:04] it won't some situations and you say how
[1:18:07] did this be how could this get this way
[1:18:10] but if we could realize it's God
[1:18:12] bringing you and I to an eye sheep
[1:18:17] sometimes we're so interested our flesh
[1:18:20] is interested in wanting to get off the
[1:18:22] ash sheep but the real victory in the
[1:18:26] ass sheep is where more of Samuel is
[1:18:29] Left Behind
[1:18:32] and more of God can come forth
[1:18:38] Hallelujah and God knows just how to do
[1:18:40] that
[1:18:41] if God would ask me to choose it well of
[1:18:44] course it'd just be like when I choose
[1:18:45] what I want to eat I don't choose stuff
[1:18:47] that I don't like to eat I don't chew
[1:18:49] stuff it looks funny
[1:18:51] I don't choose stuff that's moving it's
[1:18:53] got to be dead
[1:18:55] I don't want to eat it if it's moving I
[1:18:57] don't want to eat it with his eyeballs
[1:18:59] in it looking at me either
[1:19:00] I tell the brothers when I go overseas
[1:19:02] take mine out and take the head off
[1:19:05] I don't want it
[1:19:08] right we would choose things that we
[1:19:11] like
[1:19:12] if it was up to us listen I don't care
[1:19:15] how born again you are
[1:19:17] our flesh will never choose the hard way
[1:19:23] that's why I took the spirit of God to
[1:19:25] bring you and I to a real ass sheep to
[1:19:28] recognize that there would be a choice
[1:19:30] that would be made that would be the
[1:19:32] hard decision a great decision a
[1:19:36] momentous decision and what was it it
[1:19:38] was God pulling upon her soul it was God
[1:19:42] pulling upon that Whispers could come on
[1:19:45] what are you going to do with your
[1:19:46] friends what are you going to do with
[1:19:47] your co-workers what is so-and-so going
[1:19:48] to say what are your friends going to
[1:19:50] say now all those Whispers you know what
[1:19:52] that is that stench from the ash Heath
[1:19:55] that's trying to keep us there
[1:19:58] but God in his grace oh you talking
[1:20:01] about the prevailing winds of the Holy
[1:20:04] Ghost brother it's the winds that comes
[1:20:07] by and lets you know there is a fresh
[1:20:10] life there's a fresh experience there's
[1:20:13] a fresh walk there's a renewing there's
[1:20:15] a life that's so far greater than
[1:20:18] anything this world can offer
[1:20:23] my worst day as a Christian
[1:20:25] is better than the best day of the
[1:20:27] center
[1:20:30] you catch that
[1:20:32] how many Justified of that
[1:20:34] amen that's absolutely the truth now I
[1:20:37] want you to watch this testimony here
[1:20:38] that brother Branham said he said but
[1:20:41] today I know it was all working for my
[1:20:43] good
[1:20:44] I know the life had to be ground
[1:20:47] and twisted and squeezed to get what was
[1:20:52] in it out
[1:20:53] remember we are all we delivered unto
[1:20:56] death
[1:20:58] Calvary could have never taken place
[1:21:00] without there being a Gethsemane
[1:21:02] right gethsemane's word was squeezed out
[1:21:05] we would like quick instant come on
[1:21:07] let's get the crucified but there
[1:21:09] there's a whole process we are always
[1:21:12] delivered unto death
[1:21:14] according to the dying of our Lord Jesus
[1:21:16] what was the dying
[1:21:18] to his will
[1:21:20] sure nevertheless not my will
[1:21:24] than will be done
[1:21:26] he was choosing to stand upon the word
[1:21:32] he was making that choice there was a
[1:21:35] dying going on
[1:21:36] that from Gethsemane
[1:21:39] it could go to Calvary
[1:21:41] and before he even got the calvary thing
[1:21:43] about it after Gethsemane he enters into
[1:21:45] pilate's Hall I think he goes in amongst
[1:21:48] people that are going to ridicule him
[1:21:52] speak against him
[1:21:55] ask him for certain things
[1:21:58] here it is in pilate's Hall
[1:22:01] but you know what that is
[1:22:02] it's dying
[1:22:05] he's being tested
[1:22:07] even when he was on the cross
[1:22:10] I like how brother Brown says it I think
[1:22:12] he quotes from Paul Rader all he had it
[1:22:14] would have had to have done he'd just
[1:22:16] give one nod to the angels they were all
[1:22:18] posted
[1:22:20] and that would have been it
[1:22:22] but he was dying to himself
[1:22:25] as a matter of fact when he died
[1:22:28] if we could do a spiritual MRI
[1:22:31] he had not one bit of bitterness in his
[1:22:35] life
[1:22:36] against Pilate
[1:22:38] he had not one bit of bitterness
[1:22:42] against Judas
[1:22:45] oh Lord help us let's follow him now
[1:22:49] see this is why we need the help of the
[1:22:51] spirit of God this is why at times Upon
[1:22:54] Our Ash heaps the spirit of God is
[1:22:56] leading us Lord I'm ready for
[1:22:57] Resurrection I'm ready for resurrection
[1:22:59] and here we find out I'm still in
[1:23:01] Pilates Hall
[1:23:02] how many Pilot's home why because there
[1:23:05] cannot be any spec
[1:23:07] bit bitterness resentment or whatever
[1:23:09] and you realize there's times you got to
[1:23:11] pray that out
[1:23:13] getting quiet now
[1:23:16] in the message super sense when brother
[1:23:17] brother Brown preaches that after he's
[1:23:19] come through the Holy Ghost series and
[1:23:20] just preached the super sign that
[1:23:22] morning brother Brian has given a word
[1:23:24] of counsel to the church spends about 40
[1:23:25] 45 minutes speaking to it before he
[1:23:27] actually goes in to preach the message
[1:23:29] the super sense and it begins to speak
[1:23:31] to him he says now listen let's maintain
[1:23:33] this consecration that has been brought
[1:23:35] about in the church right now we've seen
[1:23:37] God move and he said now Satan is going
[1:23:38] to come and try to tell you things
[1:23:40] against this one against that one and he
[1:23:42] said there might be things he said that
[1:23:44] he said don't you listen to it you turn
[1:23:46] it down right away I don't care if you
[1:23:47] think it's true or not burn it down
[1:23:50] right don't don't entertain it and then
[1:23:52] he goes in to speak he says if there's
[1:23:54] something comes in he says now he says
[1:23:56] if you feel like that there's some a
[1:23:58] little bit of something resentment or
[1:24:00] something he said just get along with
[1:24:02] God and pray it out
[1:24:06] now I know I'm not preaching to Angels
[1:24:10] I'm preaching to all of us tonight
[1:24:12] but you know what it works
[1:24:15] I could stand right there and when I was
[1:24:17] just walking in the yard the other day
[1:24:19] and listening I said Lord I'm a witness
[1:24:21] that works
[1:24:22] I know that works I'm so glad for the
[1:24:25] Holy Ghost I'm so thankful for the
[1:24:27] spirit of God in our life that we can
[1:24:30] pray and submit ourselves to almighty
[1:24:33] God and God brings healing in our life
[1:24:35] don't wrestle with things in your life
[1:24:37] of well why do I feel this way and the
[1:24:39] enemy beating you up why if you fell you
[1:24:41] shouldn't feel this way you shouldn't
[1:24:43] Miss no go to God in prayer and say Lord
[1:24:46] I give this to you this is my brother
[1:24:49] this is my sister or my co-worker my
[1:24:52] boss I give it to you Lord Jesus
[1:24:57] that's right it works don't it
[1:25:00] it might be it clocks in you know Satan
[1:25:03] is there to punch the card the next
[1:25:04] morning what I do pray the same thing
[1:25:06] again
[1:25:07] because it works it's dying out to self
[1:25:13] brother REM says here's what it was
[1:25:16] there was too much branum in there
[1:25:21] I could put myself in there and say
[1:25:22] there was too much Browning in there
[1:25:25] had to be squeezed out before God could
[1:25:28] make himself known
[1:25:30] there was too much of you
[1:25:33] in you
[1:25:35] I want a paradox too much of you in you
[1:25:39] that had to be squeezed out
[1:25:41] till God had to squeeze it out through
[1:25:43] trials and that squeezing was come oh he
[1:25:46] said it's hard when it's coming on but
[1:25:48] after a while the skies clear back then
[1:25:51] you see the purpose of God and that's
[1:25:53] when you can cry out I know my redeemer
[1:25:55] liveth and at the last days he'll stand
[1:25:57] on the earth and though the skin worms
[1:25:59] destroys this body yet in my flesh shall
[1:26:01] I see God these little trials and things
[1:26:04] are just for a moment
[1:26:07] they fade and they pass away
[1:26:10] and he said I want you to remember
[1:26:11] they're done for your good that God
[1:26:14] would get Glory
[1:26:16] let me bring it down here
[1:26:19] Paul says in verse 13 of that same
[1:26:21] chapter
[1:26:23] we having the same Spirit of faith
[1:26:26] according as it is written
[1:26:28] I believed
[1:26:30] and therefore have I spoken
[1:26:32] we also believe
[1:26:34] and therefore speak
[1:26:36] knowing that he which raised up the Lord
[1:26:39] Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus
[1:26:42] and shall present us
[1:26:45] with you
[1:26:47] now I want you to notice that same
[1:26:49] Spirit of faith that I know he shall
[1:26:51] Raise Me Up
[1:26:53] I know my redeemer lives see that same
[1:26:56] Spirit of faith
[1:26:57] that we speak by
[1:26:59] a positive confession
[1:27:02] a positive testimony
[1:27:04] that I know that God is in control I
[1:27:06] don't know all these circumstances I
[1:27:08] don't know all of this
[1:27:10] just sometimes even when it's a sickness
[1:27:13] sometimes it's a sickness that can
[1:27:15] linger only no matter what it is
[1:27:17] disappointments sickness troubles it
[1:27:20] doesn't matter
[1:27:22] it has it all comes along it comes into
[1:27:25] that place that Lord I know that you
[1:27:30] shall raise us up also
[1:27:32] I know you're going to bring me through
[1:27:35] God you're going to bring us through
[1:27:37] you're seeing me through right now I may
[1:27:39] not feel like it but I know you're
[1:27:40] working
[1:27:42] Lord help me to die more to myself help
[1:27:45] me to submit myself in the midst of this
[1:27:47] time lord don't let there be nothing
[1:27:49] that that stands in my life because what
[1:27:52] this ass sheep is purposed for is that I
[1:27:55] might
[1:27:56] have a new fellowship with you
[1:28:00] there might be a Resurrection come forth
[1:28:03] there might be less of me Lord
[1:28:06] and more of you
[1:28:09] that's the purpose of the action
[1:28:11] God leads us to the trial that it would
[1:28:13] be less of us
[1:28:15] and more of him come forth
[1:28:17] for all things Paul could say in verse
[1:28:19] 15 or for your sakes that the abundant
[1:28:22] grace might through the Thanksgiving of
[1:28:24] many redowned to the glory of God for
[1:28:27] which cause we think not
[1:28:29] but though our outward men perish
[1:28:32] let me say Amen to that
[1:28:34] when they asked sheep the outward man is
[1:28:36] perishing
[1:28:39] yet the inward man
[1:28:42] is renewed day by day
[1:28:47] the inward man
[1:28:49] is receiving comfort
[1:28:51] receiving strength
[1:28:53] receiving courage
[1:28:55] for our light Affliction which is but
[1:28:57] for a moment worketh for us
[1:29:01] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[1:29:04] of Glory
[1:29:05] while we look not at things which are
[1:29:07] seen But at things which are not seen
[1:29:10] the things which are seen are temporal
[1:29:12] but the things which are not seen
[1:29:15] are
[1:29:16] eternal
[1:29:21] to think of that
[1:29:23] your stance job
[1:29:25] greatest revelation
[1:29:27] Joe sees
[1:29:30] the resurrection job even seen
[1:29:34] of even in this hour
[1:29:38] of the resurrection of the word out of
[1:29:41] dark denominationalism
[1:29:43] job is beholding this
[1:29:45] in this hour
[1:29:47] it's compound
[1:29:49] I can't go into all that tonight but
[1:29:51] it's compound because when we look at it
[1:29:54] in job 19
[1:29:56] here you come right after this
[1:29:59] in job 20.
[1:30:01] here comes a response from one of the
[1:30:03] one of the friends
[1:30:06] then job 21.
[1:30:08] job goes right back in
[1:30:11] it's like you look at it if you would
[1:30:13] look at Job you'd say job what's going
[1:30:15] on
[1:30:16] but job has had a moment of reprieve of
[1:30:19] refreshing
[1:30:20] of renewal God didn't give him
[1:30:22] understanding of the trial
[1:30:25] God didn't give him understanding but
[1:30:27] what God did was is giving the
[1:30:28] Revelation I know my redeemer lives
[1:30:31] and once God ever let me just lay this
[1:30:34] in once God ever gives the original
[1:30:36] Revelation he can never take away from
[1:30:38] that
[1:30:39] he only adds to it
[1:30:42] unfolds it more and more
[1:30:45] and that's what continues to happen in
[1:30:47] that of job that continues to unfold
[1:30:49] more and more just even to where you and
[1:30:51] I are standing today it's the same way
[1:30:53] in our lives
[1:30:56] same way in our lives
[1:30:57] what God has done originally in our life
[1:30:59] that original work it never takes away
[1:31:01] from it but he continues to add to it
[1:31:04] continues to add
[1:31:08] it continues to unfold himself but the
[1:31:13] ash sheep
[1:31:15] many many different ways
[1:31:18] many things of that ashy
[1:31:21] I think two examples here that I that
[1:31:24] even for brother Branham because we
[1:31:26] could talk about sickness we can talk
[1:31:27] about you know as I said we whether it's
[1:31:30] disappointments it's offenses on and on
[1:31:33] family or
[1:31:34] wherever it could be
[1:31:36] but even how brother Branham as I told
[1:31:38] you was on that ass sheep when he got to
[1:31:41] looking around at Oral Robert's place
[1:31:43] and he said God I must be the biggest
[1:31:45] hypocrite
[1:31:47] you couldn't trust me
[1:31:49] that's what he said
[1:31:51] but then the Lord spoke to him
[1:31:53] I am your portion
[1:31:56] you see it lets us know that sometimes
[1:31:58] even in our feelings about things
[1:32:01] can be an ashy
[1:32:04] well brother Samuel
[1:32:06] how long am I on that ass sheep
[1:32:09] until
[1:32:10] we get the message
[1:32:13] until we get the message I say God help
[1:32:16] me to get the message
[1:32:17] I I'm not saying that from my flesh or
[1:32:19] help me to get out of it I'm saying it
[1:32:21] from here God help me to get what it is
[1:32:24] that you're trying to say to me
[1:32:27] because I know if I'm on on the ash
[1:32:29] sheep there's more of Samuel I want to
[1:32:31] leave behind
[1:32:33] because I know that's what the purpose
[1:32:35] of it's for is that there would be a new
[1:32:38] Fellowship there would be more
[1:32:40] more of you that would come forth in my
[1:32:43] life
[1:32:45] oh God is so mindful
[1:32:47] he knows how to lead you and I into
[1:32:49] those places God knows how he just
[1:32:52] doesn't speak to you and I and say this
[1:32:54] has got to be more of this and more of
[1:32:55] this and but God knows how to bring us
[1:32:57] into these places
[1:32:58] that there brother Brian they're just so
[1:33:01] personable
[1:33:02] it's so personal
[1:33:03] every trial it's so personal
[1:33:06] that's why I could look at your trial
[1:33:08] Brothers train and say oh come on
[1:33:09] brother Shane come on I could but I know
[1:33:12] better than that
[1:33:13] because God
[1:33:15] is working personally
[1:33:17] with every one of our lives and you know
[1:33:20] the thing about it is sister Carmen the
[1:33:22] trial is not to defeat us
[1:33:24] the trial is not to shame us
[1:33:26] the trial is not to put us down
[1:33:29] the trial is so that more of Jesus
[1:33:32] Christ can come forth in our life
[1:33:37] oh God help me
[1:33:39] help us Lord help us Lord to look to you
[1:33:42] help me to die more to myself help me
[1:33:45] Lord in these situations that come about
[1:33:48] help me Lord
[1:33:49] I want to leave more of Samuel behind
[1:33:53] because he's the guy that gets in my way
[1:33:55] he's the one that hinders
[1:33:58] I want to leave more of him behind let's
[1:34:01] pray
[1:34:02] Heavenly Father
[1:34:06] Lord Jesus
[1:34:10] I pray Lord that you just
[1:34:13] just put it all together Lord I always
[1:34:15] just trusting Lord to bring it together
[1:34:18] to our hearts Lord right where it needs
[1:34:20] to be
[1:34:21] that go Lord to encourage us Lord to
[1:34:24] strengthen us the Lord
[1:34:25] in these moments Lord God in these times
[1:34:29] I know Lord should you Tarry
[1:34:34] Lord should you tarry a month
[1:34:37] months year so forth Lord down the road
[1:34:40] we will need to be reminded of these
[1:34:43] things Lord
[1:34:44] will need to be Lord encouraged
[1:34:47] and Lord we Look to You Lord to
[1:34:49] encourage us Lord not just Lord as we're
[1:34:51] speaking about tests and trials if
[1:34:53] that's the way you take it Lord
[1:34:55] but father each time when we come Lord
[1:34:59] to the house of God
[1:35:01] Lord as we come with an expectation Lord
[1:35:04] to hear from you to see
[1:35:06] to see you Lord
[1:35:08] as you would move among us as you would
[1:35:10] speak to our hearts help us the Lord not
[1:35:12] to be so
[1:35:14] Lord consumed with the ash Heap Lord
[1:35:18] that we miss your voice Lord
[1:35:22] but Lord I know
[1:35:23] Lord Jesus
[1:35:25] I know for myself Lord
[1:35:27] and I believe I can speak Lord God for
[1:35:29] every other believer here tonight Lord
[1:35:32] those that are streaming Lord we Look to
[1:35:35] You Lord God
[1:35:37] and say Lord I just need to hear a word
[1:35:39] from you Lord
[1:35:41] I just need a word from you Lord I need
[1:35:45] Lord God just encouragement Lord
[1:35:48] strength Lord from you
[1:35:50] Lord like job

[1:36:54] Lord God when you had taken Sharon Rose
[1:36:56] when you had taken Lord dear God his
[1:36:59] wife even when he goes on to speak Lord
[1:37:02] in that
[1:37:04] that further service of that day where I
[1:37:07] was quoting to Lord referring to of that
[1:37:09] of his new ministry Lord God you had
[1:37:11] begun to speak to him even in that time
[1:37:13] when he was on the ash sheep but he
[1:37:15] realized Lord God that through those
[1:37:17] Visions he had been relying too much
[1:37:19] upon Men been relying upon things that
[1:37:23] are around him and you were Lord
[1:37:24] speaking to him in that moment Lord and
[1:37:27] helping him Lord in that moment on the
[1:37:29] ash Heap Lord Jesus
[1:37:32] there was the Lord that reality Lord as
[1:37:35] the prophet himself as he stood right
[1:37:38] there he had to die
[1:37:40] to that Lord which he was afraid of
[1:37:44] afraid to make a mistake afraid to fail
[1:37:47] Lord he was there standing before him
[1:37:49] but Lord Jesus
[1:37:51] we know Lord we're a product
[1:37:54] that God where our life was able to be
[1:37:56] surrendered to you Lord and died to his
[1:37:58] self and this message Lord has come to

[1:43:41] everything
[1:43:43] is said he will
[1:43:49] foreign
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:44:22] just kind of
[1:44:24] speak
[1:44:26] but I just want to say that um
[1:44:30] the Lord is really
[1:44:32] talk speaking he's really talking to us
[1:44:39] about not going through feelings and all
[1:44:42] that
[1:44:43] and uh
[1:44:45] last
[1:44:47] last Friday I had a dream the dream had
[1:44:50] to do with this
[1:44:53] and um I had a dream about
[1:44:55] the brothers
[1:44:57] asking
[1:45:00] um who who who wants the Lord who who
[1:45:03] loves the Lord and everything and so all
[1:45:05] the church stand up and I stay sitting
[1:45:08] down
[1:45:09] and then I said I started feeling
[1:45:12] like um
[1:45:14] what's wrong with me you know that
[1:45:18] because I wasn't really understanding
[1:45:20] and then I said
[1:45:22] what's wrong with me I really do I
[1:45:25] really love the Lord do I really
[1:45:29] things like that and it was really
[1:45:31] bothering me and then um I said
[1:45:36] no look inside inside of you
[1:45:41] and the Lord Of Glory that's why you
[1:45:44] know and then all those feelings they
[1:45:46] they left left
[1:45:48] so um
[1:45:50] their brother
[1:45:52] um came and preached and he he started
[1:45:55] saying the same things and he says just
[1:45:57] look inside look inside of you the Lord
[1:46:01] that and um that's it
[1:46:04] and um then the brother has been
[1:46:06] preaching about it
[1:46:08] about not going my feelings
[1:46:10] not not by letting
[1:46:13] any anything come and tell you anything
[1:46:16] but just
[1:46:18] believe God the inside that he's he's
[1:46:21] taking care of you he's taking care
[1:46:24] and um I thought maybe I should just
[1:46:27] give you the testimony because so he he
[1:46:30] kind of said you said what I told you to
[1:46:32] say so I um I think it's God trying to
[1:46:37] to tell somebody that the enemy is
[1:46:41] trying to tell them
[1:46:44] they're not no good they're whatever you
[1:46:48] know and and it's just not that it's not
[1:46:50] that just listen to what the brother is
[1:46:53] preaching because God is really leading
[1:46:57] him to um to help you guys um
[1:47:03] not to let the devil defeat you praise
[1:47:06] the Lord and then thank you
[1:47:11] [Applause]
[1:47:18] ma'am
[1:47:22] now
[1:47:24] you know brother Brandon
[1:47:26] mentioned in his own walk with God
[1:47:31] and I don't care how far along you are
[1:47:33] in your walk with God
[1:47:36] the enemy still will try to come that's
[1:47:38] how you we learn through these battles
[1:47:41] to Warfare
[1:47:43] we learned that
[1:47:45] and when I say learn that it doesn't
[1:47:46] mean that the battles don't come it is
[1:47:49] me
[1:47:49] recognizing God gives us Grace to help
[1:47:52] to recognize what's going on
[1:47:55] brother Brandon he said when when I was
[1:47:57] a young Christian
[1:47:58] he said
[1:48:00] Satan used to come and beat me all
[1:48:02] around the stump
[1:48:04] based on my feelings
[1:48:06] he said but then when I recognized
[1:48:09] have met God's requirements
[1:48:11] and I could point that right back to the
[1:48:13] enemy and said no
[1:48:14] you can't accuse me I've met God's
[1:48:17] requirements I've done everything that
[1:48:20] he asked me to do
[1:48:22] it was a learning
[1:48:24] same thing within our lives it's
[1:48:26] recognizing in the midst of all the
[1:48:28] feelings will come
[1:48:30] things come how God would allow us just
[1:48:32] to tap into that for a moment but the
[1:48:34] feelings
[1:48:36] is not who you are
[1:48:39] the feelings are not who you are
[1:48:41] amen that's not who you are
[1:48:45] is who you really are on the inside
[1:48:49] but Brandon said there was too much as
[1:48:51] he as they read that quote he said
[1:48:52] there's too much of you
[1:48:54] in you
[1:48:56] so it's two u's
[1:48:59] there's a u inside of you
[1:49:01] and it takes the word of God to let you
[1:49:03] know who you are
[1:49:06] it's the word that comes and brings a
[1:49:08] discernment and divides bone from the
[1:49:11] moral and pulls out on the inside who
[1:49:13] the real you is because this on the
[1:49:15] outside it can whisper to you and even
[1:49:18] use your own voice that's how thoughts
[1:49:20] will come
[1:49:22] that's one of Satan's tactics to make
[1:49:24] you think that well this is what really
[1:49:27] my desires are that's a lie your desires
[1:49:30] is what's coming from the inside
[1:49:33] my desire is to serve the Lord
[1:49:36] my desire is to live for him
[1:49:39] and you're Discerning that spirit
[1:49:43] that's coming what do I do stand against
[1:49:46] it how do I stand against it by the
[1:49:49] desire that's in your heart
[1:49:52] and say Lord I stand for you Lord
[1:49:56] I stand for your word Lord regardless of
[1:49:59] how I feel
[1:50:00] Thy word is truth
[1:50:06] he is Our Redeemer
[1:50:09] he is our deliverer
[1:50:12] he's an ever-present help
[1:50:14] in the time of trouble
[1:50:18] the hope of glory in our life
