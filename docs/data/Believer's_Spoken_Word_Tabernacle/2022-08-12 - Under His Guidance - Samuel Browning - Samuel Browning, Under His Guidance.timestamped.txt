[34:52] thursday night i moved it from august
[34:54] 25th
[34:55] august 3rd

[35:06] lord willing i leave
[35:08] meetings
[35:09] mexico going from that time forward
[35:13] then we'll return back here that sunday
[35:15] brother ronnie long has seen that
[35:19] so
[35:20] lord willing will be here during that
[35:22] time
[35:23] i just wanted to try to be here
[35:25] that because then that following weekend
[35:28] meetings and these things were already
[35:30] scheduled meetings and things uh indiana
[35:33] so
[35:35] just ask you that you would just
[35:36] continue just keep those in prayers
[35:39] did you do that
[35:40] it's praying that god will just died and
[35:42] directed us lord has
[35:45] or directed this this with
[35:48] mexico here i've just
[35:50] brothers have been trying to been
[35:52] speaking to me since actually since back
[35:55] for a
[35:56] part of last year and so just we've just
[35:58] been praying about that just trying to
[36:00] look at
[36:01] times of
[36:02] just trust that would be okay just so we
[36:04] can be together
[36:06] be some in and out here but no one think
[36:09] would that be good ministry coming in
[36:11] here as well
[36:12] so i want to be sure of that too so
[36:15] let's just look to the word of the lord
[36:17] if we could now in joshua chapter 5
[36:20] verse 13.
[36:34] joshua chapter 5 and verse 13 it says
[36:37] and it came to pass
[36:39] when joshua
[36:40] was by jericho
[36:42] that he lifted up his eyes and looked
[36:46] and behold there stood a man over
[36:48] against him
[36:50] with his sword drawn in his hand
[36:53] and joshua went unto him and said unto
[36:55] him
[36:56] art thou for us
[36:58] were for our adversaries
[37:01] he said nay but as captain of the host
[37:04] of the lord
[37:05] am i now come
[37:07] this is the same
[37:09] pillar of fire that has led israel
[37:13] but now he's become a man
[37:17] he's come down now in a form now it's to
[37:20] lead them into
[37:23] god
[37:24] i i just love this scripture here
[37:28] after that announcement of who he is you
[37:30] know
[37:31] he doesn't have to explain to josh we
[37:33] don't have to go through and say we're
[37:35] going to hold two weeks of seminars and
[37:37] everything he just he just
[37:39] you see he announces who he is
[37:42] and joshua already knows him
[37:45] joshua's been feeding on the word
[37:48] the old porn of the land so now when he
[37:50] says i'm the captain of the lord's host
[37:53] notice the position
[37:55] joshua fell on his face to the earth
[37:59] and did worship
[38:01] and said unto him what saith my lord
[38:05] unto his servant
[38:07] captain of the lord's host said unto
[38:09] joshua
[38:10] loose thy shoe from off thy foot
[38:15] place whereon thou standest
[38:17] his home
[38:19] joshua
[38:21] may god bless the reading of his word as
[38:23] you're being seated
[38:27] just want to speak just a few words here
[38:30] tonight we'll just see how the lord will
[38:33] just take us here
[38:36] but i want to just
[38:37] speak on this thought of under
[38:40] his guidance
[38:42] under his guidance to the guidance of
[38:44] the lord jesus
[38:46] in joshua chapter 6 it has laid out
[38:50] there of them
[38:52] the record of when joshua comes back
[38:54] into the camp of israel after this
[38:57] meeting
[38:58] and he's received the guidance of the
[39:00] holy spirit
[39:02] on how
[39:03] that jericho is going to be taken
[39:07] and i want you just to just to think of
[39:09] this that when we
[39:11] look at that of the promised land
[39:14] and
[39:15] what i don't want to deal with so much
[39:18] tonight or just see how the lord will
[39:19] take it i don't want to deal with so
[39:21] much on
[39:22] types of things i want i just wanted to
[39:24] come right down what's been the burden
[39:26] of my heart for weeks months now is that
[39:28] this would just come right down to be
[39:31] everyday
[39:32] practical application
[39:35] and i want you just to see it in this
[39:37] manner brother brian just a little bit
[39:38] more turn it just a little bit more here
[39:41] i want you just to see it in this manner
[39:43] that when we have come into
[39:45] the promise of the holy ghost
[39:47] not only coming into the holy ghost down
[39:50] just a little bit but coming once you
[39:53] know even as we're coming to the every
[39:55] promise of god including that of the
[39:57] holy ghost there's option there's
[39:59] opposition against
[40:01] brother branham would talk about some of
[40:02] the opposition that you know
[40:04] he says you could take a person who's
[40:06] very nervous and he said here they go to
[40:09] praying about something and they get
[40:10] real nervous he said they'll back right
[40:12] away and say well it just not must not
[40:13] have been the will of god brother braham
[40:16] goes into it says what it is as that
[40:18] that person that nervousness he said
[40:21] then then satan what he'll do he'll move
[40:23] on that the conscience that outer spirit
[40:25] realm and then begin to just whisper
[40:27] well you know it says you know look look
[40:29] at your condition and look how this is
[40:31] but that's the very moment
[40:34] to persevere
[40:35] beyond that barrier
[40:38] that barrier that that comes up there
[40:41] and many times let's just let's just
[40:43] let's just cut to the chase many a times
[40:46] it's the barriers themselves and we
[40:48] allow them to be barriers and remain
[40:51] barriers and get built up as bigger
[40:53] barriers
[40:54] and instead of the time of taking the
[40:58] promise of god now please understand me
[41:00] when i'm talking about taking the
[41:01] promise of god not back away from it not
[41:05] look for an excuse around it but no
[41:08] matter what the situation is we can
[41:10] stand right there and say god has made
[41:12] the promise i'm a believer god's word is
[41:15] true and i'm going to stand on this
[41:17] promise
[41:19] i'm going to stand here if if i go by
[41:22] the way of the grave i'm going to stand
[41:24] on this promise because this is a
[41:26] promise that god has made and god cannot
[41:29] fail
[41:32] and so because we see there's always
[41:34] opposition that's always going to be in
[41:36] front of us when the holy spirit has
[41:39] come now we are in the land of promise
[41:42] it's a land of overcoming
[41:45] there's always going to be oppositions
[41:47] we're not immune as brother braham takes
[41:49] us he says we're not immune from
[41:51] sickness we're not immune from trouble
[41:54] we're not immune from oh you know every
[41:56] decision that i make well it's just
[41:58] gonna every decision is thus saith the
[42:00] lord we know better than that that's a
[42:02] desire of our heart is always to be in
[42:06] the perfect will of god but we also know
[42:09] that we can't just take that for granted
[42:12] it's something that we must seek after
[42:16] it's something that we desire in our
[42:18] lives so when we come into that of of
[42:20] the holy ghost when a life has come in
[42:23] to the holy spirit we recognize it's not
[42:25] a picnic it's not something that we're
[42:28] free from battles or free from wars as a
[42:30] matter of fact brother brandon would say
[42:31] it in another place you never had any
[42:35] battles until you did come into the holy
[42:38] ghost
[42:39] but now he says once you've come into
[42:42] that of the holy ghost there's a
[42:44] constant war going on
[42:48] now within that with that in mind we
[42:50] know that there are promises that you
[42:52] and i we come up before us and there's
[42:55] there's things that for you to possess
[42:57] and we all have if i can say it in this
[43:00] manner just maybe
[43:01] general promises that are are given to
[43:04] us and yet there are things that become
[43:07] very personal that even though they can
[43:10] be general but yet it's very personal
[43:12] such a sickness you know you might have
[43:14] some individuals that they deal with and
[43:17] they battle through sickness within
[43:18] their their body and in their lives and
[43:21] you find others they really don't battle
[43:23] with sickness maybe there's more things
[43:25] that they deal with in the spiritual
[43:27] realm
[43:28] however we go about it that we we are
[43:31] made to be overcomers in this hour let
[43:34] me just say it like this there's not one
[43:36] devil that is going to be able to raise
[43:38] his head at that time and say i wasn't
[43:41] put under foot but on the contrary
[43:44] through a mini-membered body every devil
[43:48] has already been conquered by the blood
[43:52] of jesus christ and we are standing as
[43:54] conquerors and we must never let that
[43:57] testimony do not ever let the enemy take
[44:01] that away from our vocabulary and
[44:04] substitute it with something
[44:07] it doesn't matter how long we've been
[44:09] praying about something god's word is
[44:12] still true
[44:15] now so you know when brother branham
[44:17] would say this and i've been referring
[44:19] to this quote here for a few services
[44:22] and he speaks of how that when a life
[44:24] once gets over in the canaan and they
[44:26] recognize where they belong how that
[44:28] their prayer begins to be turned around
[44:32] and he says you begin to express and say
[44:35] look here satan this is mine
[44:39] you know what we need we need some
[44:41] people with some attitude
[44:43] come on now we don't have a problem
[44:45] getting an attitude somebody comes out
[44:46] in front of us man come on now hurry up
[44:49] check the people out come on we don't
[44:51] have no problem i mean it just wants to
[44:52] rise up
[44:56] come on i'm not preaching to angels this
[44:58] morning
[44:59] this evening but we need to get a little
[45:01] bit of we need to get an attitude a
[45:04] spiritual attitude an attitude that is
[45:06] brought by the word of god instead of
[45:08] like brother bram said in the message
[45:10] ashamed he stands there and preaches
[45:12] that in 65 and he identity recognizes
[45:15] even in his own self
[45:17] to me
[45:18] i would never see this in brother
[45:20] branham but brother branham is
[45:22] recognizing it in his own self he said i
[45:25] i feel like he said it's almost got to
[45:27] the place he said that we're just we're
[45:30] asking the devil to leave instead of
[45:32] adjuring him to leave he said we don't
[45:35] have to ask him we have been anointed to
[45:39] cast him out
[45:40] [Applause]
[45:42] we've been made the head and not the
[45:45] tail
[45:47] sometimes it helps us to remember who we
[45:50] are that's why the word was being
[45:52] ministered even as brother jack was
[45:54] standing on sunday it's a reminder of
[45:57] who we are
[46:00] this is mine i'm a possessor of this god
[46:04] said so move out move off my grounds
[46:08] your ground satan says
[46:10] i've got an abstract deed to it now you
[46:12] know what an abstract is an abstract is
[46:15] everything that was against it has been
[46:17] cleared off
[46:19] when you believe you receive the deed
[46:23] but there might be liens against that
[46:25] deed
[46:27] right there can be bat taxes and water
[46:29] bills and everything else but you first
[46:31] must believe but then the blood of jesus
[46:34] christ the holy spirit comes as an
[46:37] abstract to the deed that gives you an
[46:41] assurance that everything that is on
[46:43] here belongs to me and there is nothing
[46:47] against me that's what the coming of the
[46:49] holy ghost is in this hour
[46:52] the abstract to the title deed
[46:55] no other age could say that
[46:58] are you hearing me we're talking about
[46:59] the end where the fullness of god has
[47:03] come down to clear off every lien that
[47:06] was against the church of the living god
[47:12] so here i've got an abstract deed to it
[47:14] move out
[47:16] you don't if you don't i'll serve notice
[47:19] on you
[47:20] by the holy spirit's guidance
[47:24] and he moves out because he has to now
[47:26] this is a big
[47:28] big big statement in this world we draw
[47:30] our subject our title from under his
[47:33] guidance
[47:34] because joshua
[47:36] has a certainty
[47:38] of promises that no man will be able to
[47:40] stand before you
[47:42] he has a certainty of promise that every
[47:44] place your foot treads upon i've given
[47:46] it to you
[47:48] but it's also balanced with this that
[47:51] we're not just going out like loose
[47:53] cannons and we're the ones determining
[47:55] how things are done
[47:58] because that's where we go on
[48:00] impressions
[48:01] instead of divine inspiration
[48:05] there's a big difference between that
[48:07] and and so when we're looking under the
[48:09] guidance every one of us we desire i
[48:11] believe with all my heart to be under
[48:13] the guidance of the holy spirit now when
[48:16] we look at this this this term let me
[48:18] just read a few things to you on the
[48:20] word guidance a guidance itself is
[48:22] advice or information aimed at resolving
[48:26] a problem or difficulty
[48:29] especially as someone as given by
[48:32] someone in authority
[48:34] i can't think of no greater authority
[48:36] than the holy ghost
[48:38] there's no greater authority than the
[48:39] word of god
[48:41] amen uh here just some words that would
[48:44] be uh uh
[48:45] uh of similar to this would be advice
[48:48] would be counsel would be direction
[48:50] would be instruction and would be
[48:52] leadership how many knows in the
[48:53] scripture it says in the multitude of
[48:56] counsel there is safety
[48:58] so we thank god for inspiration that
[49:00] even in the times that we might not know
[49:03] where to look in the scripture to
[49:05] address the situation or what it is
[49:08] that's in front of us we may not know
[49:10] but the holy spirit is able to assemble
[49:13] that that portion of witnesses that are
[49:16] in that cloud and is able to assemble
[49:19] that council and give you and i
[49:21] direction for what we have need of in
[49:23] our life
[49:24] because in in this moment when we look
[49:27] at this with joshua joshua had a
[49:30] certainty of every promise
[49:35] everything was certain
[49:37] now it didn't mean that everything was
[49:38] going to fall in his lap but notice when
[49:40] it came this to to jericho and this is i
[49:44] i this this lays as a real foundation
[49:47] for everything
[49:49] even within uh this whole journey and
[49:52] overcoming you see joshua had put the
[49:55] word first in the beginning how many
[49:57] remember that
[49:58] as bible readers and then some things we
[50:00] were ministering on that joshua put the
[50:03] word first and and as he's putting the
[50:05] word first he's letting the people know
[50:07] the word is going to make a way for you
[50:09] and you're going to come into the land
[50:12] by the word
[50:13] so you don't come into the land by the
[50:16] word and then set the word aside but now
[50:19] you live by the word as you're in christ
[50:23] and you're looking to him for everything
[50:25] that's in front of you in the landscape
[50:28] that's before you now look how brother
[50:30] random words this these things just
[50:31] struck me you know some time ago in the
[50:34] message blind bartimaeus in 1960 brother
[50:37] branham talks about joshua walking
[50:39] around and you know around jericho and
[50:42] he said it like this he said joshua was
[50:44] walking around and looking at the walls
[50:47] of jericho now i want you to think about
[50:48] this
[50:49] joshua then in our text that we read in
[50:52] joshua 5 this was not the same as what
[50:56] we read in joshua 2 where they're on
[50:59] this side of jordan and joshua sends out
[51:02] spies
[51:03] now on this side of jordan joshua sent
[51:06] out spies now let me ask you this why
[51:08] didn't he send out spies if he already
[51:11] knew the promise was certain
[51:14] it's the same way in our lives
[51:16] healing is certain but sometimes we got
[51:19] to send out spies to see what is the
[51:21] report
[51:22] what are the things that we're going to
[51:24] pray about
[51:26] come in it ain't that we're accepting a
[51:28] report over the samuel i'm not going to
[51:30] accept the report let me remind you in
[51:32] the message how can i overcome 1963
[51:35] because sometimes we we we we can and
[51:37] i'm just going to say we understand what
[51:39] i'm saying sometimes we we still can get
[51:41] in something that where something comes
[51:43] before us and we don't want to deal with
[51:45] it so we just say it ain't there
[51:48] that's not faith that's called
[51:50] negligence
[51:52] come on we very you're not going to do
[51:54] away with jericho's you're not going to
[51:56] do with aoa with ai's you're not going
[51:59] to do away with all those things they
[52:01] are there and it's time to manifest that
[52:04] there's an overcoming power that's
[52:07] greater than your ability that's what
[52:10] these oppositions are about it's not
[52:12] that god doesn't like you it's not that
[52:15] god's trying to trip you up we
[52:17] understand trials are more precious than
[52:19] gold they are
[52:21] opportunities for the glory of god to be
[52:25] made manifest in our life
[52:28] is that right
[52:29] how can i overcome brother brown said
[52:32] you say oh i don't got cancer brother
[52:35] brown said oh no yes you do got cancer
[52:38] the doctor said you had cancer but now
[52:41] let's finish the quote but remember
[52:45] greater is he that is in you
[52:48] than he that's in the world
[52:51] you see you you've got something greater
[52:53] than a doctor's report so we're not
[52:55] going to ignore it and say well that
[52:57] that ain't that that's that you know
[52:59] that don't exist what we are going to
[53:01] say is if if that doesn't exist it's
[53:03] because of a god who is present to
[53:06] remove whatever is there and if it if it
[53:09] is made for me to go through that route
[53:12] then god will give me the strength to
[53:14] live an overcoming and victorious life
[53:17] in the midst of it
[53:20] i may have to ask him daily i may have
[53:22] to ask him moment after moment lord
[53:26] restore my joy lord refresh my joy lord
[53:29] strengthen me
[53:38] sometimes you gotta like i told him when
[53:40] i told our boys when
[53:42] looking at different things and how you
[53:44] know looking at careers and things like
[53:46] that that they're looking into i said
[53:48] look don't just go through college the
[53:50] whole time
[53:51] and think you're getting you're going to
[53:52] do this and you get out the end of the
[53:53] road i set with people at the end of the
[53:56] road all they had to do was do their
[53:58] student teaching and they realized when
[54:00] they got to the end i don't want to do
[54:02] this
[54:04] that's mommy and daddy's dying down the
[54:06] drain
[54:08] i don't want to do this and it's more
[54:10] than just the dying down the drain
[54:12] you've wasted four years
[54:15] come on friends our time is too precious
[54:19] time is too precious and i i believe
[54:21] that i know that as a witness that god
[54:23] will lead us and he guides us he cares
[54:26] about every detail the bible says
[54:28] acknowledge the lord in all things and
[54:30] he shall direct thy pathways
[54:34] i said go out and spy out the land
[54:38] you're interested in going in the
[54:39] medical route there's plenty of medical
[54:41] facilities around here go spy out the
[54:43] land
[54:44] you want to look at physical i'm
[54:46] interested in being a nurse go spy out
[54:48] the land you ask god to connect me with
[54:51] some nurses and ask can i go around oh
[54:54] brother samuel that ain't real spiritual
[54:55] but remember the reason we do on our
[54:58] jobs and the things we do god's already
[55:01] put that talent inside of us and the
[55:03] reason that we do what we do is so that
[55:06] the natural does not become an occupant
[55:10] over top of the spiritual
[55:14] that's why things are prioritized even
[55:16] right now so there's times to send out
[55:18] spies
[55:20] right
[55:24] don't nobody get mad at me but you know
[55:27] sometimes i'm just going to say it you
[55:28] know here i am as a pastor sometimes
[55:30] when i hear things if i step on your
[55:32] feet a little bit you know just say oh
[55:34] that's just brother samuel but you know
[55:36] there's some things i can look at and
[55:38] say what's in that degree what's in with
[55:40] this right here you know because
[55:41] sometimes you would get to the end of it
[55:44] what is the outcome you're intending to
[55:46] do
[55:49] right what's the outcome after it i'm
[55:51] not going to call some out because i
[55:52] could do that i'm going to tell my
[55:54] people i'm talking about degrees of
[55:55] things because when he get gets to the
[55:57] end of it all and and you know when we
[55:59] look at it i believe that we we should
[56:01] send spies out i believe there should be
[56:03] spies out if we're interested in a young
[56:05] lady interested in a young man i believe
[56:07] we need to send some spies out and see
[56:09] what's there
[56:12] help me preach now
[56:14] and this is scripture friends this isn't
[56:17] just going back and reading we're here
[56:19] in an overcoming faith there's a
[56:21] business deal laying ahead of you send
[56:23] out some spies send out some fillers of
[56:26] the holy spirit and find out what's
[56:29] laying there
[56:31] amen when joshua did all of that notice
[56:34] when he did all of that what came back
[56:37] to him was a refreshment in that the
[56:41] lord has given us the city
[56:47] i'm glad for that i i think we ought to
[56:50] send out spies and and look into those
[56:52] things that no matter what it is in the
[56:54] natural whether job whether you know
[56:57] whether it's that of a spouse whether
[56:58] whatever it is a home i believe we need
[57:01] to do those things because how can you
[57:04] know unless you don't send out some
[57:06] spies
[57:09] is that right
[57:11] i mean when i was going into teaching i
[57:13] got around i wanted every opportunity
[57:15] beyond just what they gave me because i
[57:17] wanted to know what this is like
[57:20] i stayed beyond different times oh my
[57:24] i stayed beyond different times i want
[57:25] to know what this is like now listen i
[57:27] seen bad kids
[57:29] i seen all that you know that that could
[57:30] have turned me around right there and
[57:31] said nope ain't going to do this
[57:34] i had nobody talking back to me i i
[57:37] could have i could have made my decision
[57:38] sometimes within that you can say oh
[57:41] brother samuel i need to be strong no
[57:43] remember everything with the will of god
[57:45] are you hearing me now god's will is
[57:48] always accompanied with the dove
[57:51] the dove will never lead you into
[57:54] anxiousness
[57:57] it's just not a pattern but the peace of
[58:00] god is always accompanied with the will
[58:02] of god so let me get back into this here
[58:05] you know his first objective was to take
[58:07] this city so he's looking around jericho
[58:10] and he sees all the doors are closed he
[58:12] sees all the walls now i want you to
[58:14] watch how brother branham words this he
[58:16] said joshua was wondering how
[58:20] that he'd be able to take that city
[58:22] because it was given to him and just
[58:25] what would be the way
[58:27] that god had planned to do it
[58:30] i want you to notice in this quote let
[58:32] me read that part to you again and then
[58:34] i'll go to another quote joshua was
[58:36] wondering how that he'd be able to take
[58:38] that city because it was given to him
[58:42] how am i going to do this not if i can
[58:44] how am i going to do it
[58:46] not if i can not if not if the holy
[58:48] ghost is for me it's for me
[58:52] not if healing's for me it's for me
[58:56] glory be to god
[58:58] he needed to know what would be the way
[59:00] that god had planned to do it
[59:02] in the message uh in the message thou
[59:04] son of david have mercy on me brother
[59:06] bram said one day joshua that great
[59:08] warrior was taking a little walk one
[59:10] afternoon and studying the strategy of
[59:14] how to take that walls of jericho
[59:17] how he was going to do it so if you were
[59:20] to have a coffee time with joshua you
[59:23] would not have heard from joshua well
[59:26] maybe god will
[59:29] god might got perhaps no joshua had
[59:33] already had a crossing of the river
[59:36] jordan
[59:38] there had already been a circumcision
[59:40] every promise in the book belongs to me
[59:44] i may not see the plan the strategy laid
[59:48] out but i know that every promise
[59:51] belongs to me
[59:54] you see god's letting you and i know
[59:56] don't sweat the stuff that ain't your
[59:58] business
[1:00:01] some stuff just ain't your business it
[1:00:03] ain't my business brother brandon says i
[1:00:05] think 1964 in the message look he talks
[1:00:07] about abraham and how abraham himself
[1:00:10] would direct his eyes away from his own
[1:00:12] natural body and away from looking at
[1:00:14] sarah and he speaks of how that abraham
[1:00:17] himself only focused on the word of god
[1:00:20] not on the things that he had no control
[1:00:23] over
[1:00:24] it wasn't his business to change his
[1:00:26] body he wanted his business to produce
[1:00:29] and bring life in his womb and bring a
[1:00:31] lie or bring life and sarah's woman life
[1:00:34] back in his but it was not his business
[1:00:36] to do that
[1:00:37] it was god's business
[1:00:40] i want you to think about talk about
[1:00:42] holding on to a promise of god abraham
[1:00:44] held on to it for 25 years how many how
[1:00:47] many times have we heard that preached
[1:00:50] how many messages that you can pick up a
[1:00:52] message and hear that speak they preach
[1:00:55] and i'm not just talking about jehovah
[1:00:57] jibril series or abraham and abraham's
[1:00:59] grace covenant i'm talking about
[1:01:01] throughout the message you you don't
[1:01:03] hear you can really go without hearing
[1:01:05] jehovah jireh mentioned in a message
[1:01:08] because that's the hour that you and i
[1:01:10] are living in
[1:01:12] that god is calling a people to absolute
[1:01:15] complete trust in him
[1:01:19] there's been other promises that other
[1:01:22] age they've taken but no age has taken
[1:01:26] the promise of the rapture because it
[1:01:28] wasn't their age but this is our promise
[1:01:32] this is our age this is our time
[1:01:37] hallelujah
[1:01:40] i think how the prophet could stand
[1:01:41] there in 1963 when he preaches christ
[1:01:45] the mystery of god reveal calling that
[1:01:47] his seven seal message and he stands
[1:01:49] right there and he lets us know he says
[1:01:51] we know referring back to the seals that
[1:01:54] who that he has come he said but as far
[1:01:57] as the coming of the lord we don't know
[1:02:00] the how or the wind but we know the who
[1:02:02] we know one fold of the threefold
[1:02:05] mystery
[1:02:06] we know who has come he has descended
[1:02:11] down is that right
[1:02:12] then he comes in the message rapture
[1:02:15] what's happening he's following on to
[1:02:18] know
[1:02:19] and he stands in the message rapture and
[1:02:21] the revelation has broke not only of the
[1:02:24] who the lord himself shall descend but
[1:02:26] the how and the wind unfolds
[1:02:31] why because this is our promise the
[1:02:34] mystery of the rapture
[1:02:38] are you hearing me now
[1:02:40] that applies to our everyday life in our
[1:02:43] lunch box
[1:02:45] many times we know the who it's got to
[1:02:48] take god but god lets it wane a little
[1:02:51] bit
[1:02:52] to for us to come to a place and that
[1:02:55] he'll make knowing the how and the
[1:03:01] a wind of times we want it
[1:03:02] instantaneously
[1:03:06] well you know i'm just wanting the lord
[1:03:07] to well there's nothing wrong with
[1:03:09] asking him but remember we know it's got
[1:03:12] to be him to do it
[1:03:14] but there's a how and there's a win
[1:03:18] is that right
[1:03:20] now what let's look at the example
[1:03:22] brother brown took can we
[1:03:24] brother adam did not stop there and say
[1:03:26] well you know i god hadn't revealed you
[1:03:28] know the how in the wind so i'm just
[1:03:29] gonna i'm not gonna preach no more
[1:03:32] he kept pressing
[1:03:34] are you hearing he kept pressing
[1:03:36] in the how in the wind that's the same
[1:03:38] thing within our lives when we are faced
[1:03:40] with promises that are that are before
[1:03:42] us joshua had the token
[1:03:45] of divine assurance
[1:03:47] in his life
[1:03:49] because you we must have the token which
[1:03:51] is the holy ghost
[1:03:53] is that right
[1:03:54] we must have that
[1:03:56] and because it is the token himself that
[1:03:58] is here that can even anoint your faith
[1:04:02] to receive the holy ghost
[1:04:05] so i want to examine here just a little
[1:04:07] bit here tonight on the reality that
[1:04:10] every promise of god is made available
[1:04:13] and belongs to us
[1:04:15] we sing the song every promise in the
[1:04:17] book is mine and it is
[1:04:19] it belongs to us
[1:04:21] but with an assurance
[1:04:23] as we seek his guidance in obtaining
[1:04:26] that promise
[1:04:28] now i want you to think we're living in
[1:04:29] that in that moment where even
[1:04:32] uh where where the lord jesus could say
[1:04:35] in john 5 19
[1:04:38] when the religious and the pharisees at
[1:04:40] that time could not understand why that
[1:04:42] that man who was crippled
[1:04:45] uh there upon the sabbath day why he was
[1:04:48] raised
[1:04:49] they couldn't figure it out
[1:04:51] and jesus responds and says my father
[1:04:54] worketh and i worketh hitherto
[1:04:58] so there's one
[1:04:59] that here
[1:05:01] that's able to move and it's an
[1:05:03] expression of the father
[1:05:06] the will of god is being expressed
[1:05:09] through the life he could say the son
[1:05:12] can do nothing in himself but what he
[1:05:15] seeth the father doing that doeth the
[1:05:18] son likewise
[1:05:20] right you catch that even as brother
[1:05:22] random setting there in that interview
[1:05:23] you know in 20th century prophet over
[1:05:26] and over where brother brad remember how
[1:05:27] many times that brother branham even
[1:05:29] when it come to the statscliff baby or
[1:05:31] there were others that that would pull
[1:05:34] and they would you know brother branham
[1:05:35] why don't you come all you got to do
[1:05:37] brother branham is say thus saith the
[1:05:38] lord and and you look at how
[1:05:41] something like that was missed uh people
[1:05:44] meaning good but i believe we ought to
[1:05:46] have more understanding that you can't
[1:05:48] make thus saith the lord happen
[1:05:51] we can't make it happen like well i'm
[1:05:53] gonna i'm just gonna it's gonna be this
[1:05:55] way you can't make it that way that is
[1:05:58] sovereignly given by god
[1:06:02] are you hearing me now
[1:06:04] uh you know like i said i know sometimes
[1:06:06] there's things that we don't want to go
[1:06:07] through but just because we don't want
[1:06:08] to go through them don't mean well i
[1:06:10] don't want to go through that so i'm
[1:06:11] just going to take this route and i'm
[1:06:12] just going to say it like this and
[1:06:13] ignore that it don't work that way
[1:06:16] that's still selfishness
[1:06:20] say god help me
[1:06:22] god help me
[1:06:24] certain things we want to ignore and we
[1:06:25] want to go around and bypass but god
[1:06:27] knows just what we have need of because
[1:06:30] every opposition is a time for god to
[1:06:33] make his glory known
[1:06:35] in our lives
[1:06:37] and let's just be honest we've got
[1:06:38] greater oppositions in our lives than
[1:06:40] jericho ever was
[1:06:42] we've got oppositions of complexes and
[1:06:44] everything else that's still there after
[1:06:46] receiving the holy ghost
[1:06:48] and there are opposition there but
[1:06:50] here's the good news if you've been born
[1:06:52] of the spirit of god greater is he that
[1:06:54] he is in you than he that's in the world
[1:06:59] i can do all things through christ who
[1:07:01] strengtheneth me so we want to look at
[1:07:03] his guidance in obtaining the promise
[1:07:06] because you know god has a plan for
[1:07:08] everything the bible said all promises
[1:07:11] of god in him are yea and amen unto the
[1:07:14] glory of god by us so you know it always
[1:07:17] depends on what we're looking at
[1:07:21] is to be looking at the promise that god
[1:07:23] has given us it that's what it depends
[1:07:25] you know whatever you look at is what
[1:07:27] you're going to talk about
[1:07:31] now joshua went out and looked at walls
[1:07:35] but he was looking at them walls and
[1:07:37] said how's they going to how's this
[1:07:39] going to happen how we get in there
[1:07:41] because god has given us this city
[1:07:44] joshua didn't get on facebook and
[1:07:46] twitter and start posting about how big
[1:07:48] the wolves were and my goodness what a
[1:07:51] terrible opposition this is and whoa me
[1:07:54] and well my he didn't do that his
[1:07:56] strategy he went out there to look at
[1:07:58] the walls and he said i know that god
[1:08:01] has given us the city he didn't know the
[1:08:03] walls were going to come down at that
[1:08:05] time that way but he knew that god had
[1:08:07] given him the city he said i don't know
[1:08:09] how it's going to happen but i just know
[1:08:12] that god is going to do it
[1:08:17] [Applause]
[1:08:19] glory be to god
[1:08:20] what if joshua would have went up there
[1:08:23] and let's say that joshua winner went up
[1:08:25] you know he just said i'll tell you what
[1:08:27] the land is ours
[1:08:28] and he could have looked over and said
[1:08:30] brother ben you got a you got a chisel
[1:08:31] and a sledgehammer let's go start
[1:08:33] busting a hole in that wall and every
[1:08:35] time we celeste was slain you know we
[1:08:37] removed that sledgehammer we're going to
[1:08:39] say in jesus name every time we take
[1:08:42] that crowbar we're going to do it that
[1:08:43] way you know what that would have been
[1:08:44] he would have built a lot of frustration
[1:08:47] now joshua could have sat there and
[1:08:49] argued and said god has given us this
[1:08:51] land i know god gave me the city but
[1:08:54] it's under his guidance
[1:08:57] it's not us taking the word it's letting
[1:08:59] the word take a hold of us
[1:09:01] that's where real overcoming takes place
[1:09:04] it's not us manhandling the word and
[1:09:06] trying to take the word and i'm gonna
[1:09:08] solve this and i'm gonna solve this all
[1:09:10] it would have been at the wall in one
[1:09:12] little itty bitty spot was some flakes
[1:09:14] of concrete probably and some rocks
[1:09:16] laying right there and joshua would have
[1:09:18] been like many of us frustrated well i
[1:09:21] don't know this is the promise of god
[1:09:24] why is that frustration many times
[1:09:26] because we don't wait on the lord
[1:09:29] but you listen friends now we're living
[1:09:31] in an age everything is so instant
[1:09:35] so you see there's pressures you have to
[1:09:37] understand that it's not
[1:09:39] de-christianizing you and i it's to
[1:09:41] understand there are things that are
[1:09:42] around us that without anybody even
[1:09:44] saying it it just seems to kind of come
[1:09:46] around us and when we get into that mode
[1:09:49] then everything is instantaneous then
[1:09:52] man when i pray i ain't heard nothing so
[1:09:54] i wonder what's going on god doesn't
[1:09:56] always answer
[1:09:58] with the text message right away
[1:10:01] matter of fact when you send a text
[1:10:02] message sometimes you don't even see
[1:10:04] those three dots showing up
[1:10:06] sometimes when you send the text message
[1:10:08] a prayer come on now a prayer to god you
[1:10:10] send it and you look back at it it don't
[1:10:12] even say red
[1:10:15] are you hearing me now
[1:10:17] sometimes we wonder what that i wonder i
[1:10:18] wonder did he get my text message i
[1:10:21] wonder did he get it why it's this the
[1:10:23] conditions of the age that we're living
[1:10:26] in but oh thanks be to god that god's
[1:10:29] word still holds true god hasn't
[1:10:31] forgotten about you god hasn't forgotten
[1:10:34] about your need let me tell you
[1:10:35] something daniel he heard your prayer
[1:10:38] the first time
[1:10:40] you prayed
[1:10:44] the victory is certain
[1:10:48] but it's how
[1:10:51] it's how
[1:10:55] i don't know about you but i don't want
[1:10:57] to be taking sledgehammers and trying to
[1:10:58] take and chip things away that's
[1:11:00] ledgehammer those things will vibrate
[1:11:02] your arms after a while
[1:11:03] right or you're trying to pry things out
[1:11:06] man that just it'd be a lot easier just
[1:11:08] to wait on god and see how god's going
[1:11:09] to do it
[1:11:11] god might my god might at least loosen
[1:11:12] the doors god might we know what happens
[1:11:14] but i'm singing in our own lives we
[1:11:16] don't know maybe the walls will come
[1:11:18] down maybe the wall maybe the doors will
[1:11:20] open we don't know but we can just stand
[1:11:22] there and say lord i know that my son or
[1:11:24] daughter belongs to you i don't know how
[1:11:27] they're going to come i don't know how
[1:11:29] you're going to bring them lord but you
[1:11:31] said that they are in heritage of the
[1:11:33] lord that is given to me you said lord
[1:11:36] that i that i and my offspring will be
[1:11:39] there with you now you can sit there all
[1:11:41] you want and say well brother samuel
[1:11:43] that's only if they're elect everybody
[1:11:45] knows that but when i want to believe
[1:11:48] just like joshua that as for me and my
[1:11:51] house we will serve the lord we are not
[1:11:55] compromisers
[1:11:57] we're believers
[1:12:04] i don't care how black it looks i don't
[1:12:06] care how difficult he looks i don't care
[1:12:08] what the situation is
[1:12:10] there's nothing
[1:12:12] beyond god
[1:12:15] but the greatest thing we can do is put
[1:12:16] away our sledgehammers put away all of
[1:12:18] our chisels because god has not given us
[1:12:21] a promise for us to try to hammer into
[1:12:23] it
[1:12:24] so it depends on what you're looking at
[1:12:27] if you look at your affliction you'll
[1:12:29] never go any further
[1:12:31] if you look at the promise of god you've
[1:12:33] got a right to every redemptive blessing
[1:12:35] that god promised in his word it's yours
[1:12:38] brother braham talks about how a
[1:12:39] christian looks always at the unseen
[1:12:41] things
[1:12:42] i want you to think of that because you
[1:12:44] know that can be somewhat of a vague
[1:12:46] term looking at the unseen things he's
[1:12:48] not talking about these eyes
[1:12:50] right here
[1:12:51] we're looking at unseen things we're
[1:12:53] talking love joy and faith and
[1:12:55] long-suffering goodness meekness
[1:12:56] gentleness and patience those are unseen
[1:12:59] forces that works from the heart of a
[1:13:00] believer but let me just go into this a
[1:13:02] little bit we look at things that we do
[1:13:04] not see
[1:13:06] if we if we're the children of abraham
[1:13:09] then we don't walk by sight we walk by
[1:13:12] faith for abraham walked by faith and
[1:13:14] called those things which were not as
[1:13:16] though they were
[1:13:18] because
[1:13:20] god said so
[1:13:23] how many abraham's children
[1:13:27] then the things that we see around us
[1:13:30] we are able to look at those things and
[1:13:33] say
[1:13:34] this is not not ignoring it it ain't
[1:13:37] like any contradicting one i said before
[1:13:40] but it's looking at the situation i see
[1:13:42] it's there like when brother brandon
[1:13:44] brought that out and i can overcome
[1:13:45] about cancer i see it's there but i'm
[1:13:47] not going to look at my affliction
[1:13:51] are you hearing me oh sure the natural
[1:13:53] thing when any we get sick or something
[1:13:55] like that boy the first thing that comes
[1:13:56] around our way boy there's a little bit
[1:13:58] of pride gets knocked out of our out of
[1:14:00] our heels a little bit we realize man
[1:14:02] just what a helpless bunch of monk that
[1:14:04] we are and how we need the lord and you
[1:14:06] begin to realize like brother branham
[1:14:08] puts it in the message breach it feels
[1:14:10] good to feel good
[1:14:12] is that right
[1:14:13] it's just being honest you know but you
[1:14:15] see we walk by faith by calling those
[1:14:18] things that are as though they are not
[1:14:20] and calling those things that are not as
[1:14:22] though they are
[1:14:26] claiming the promises of almighty god i
[1:14:29] realize that that's almost become how
[1:14:31] satan in ladies mix has almost swept in
[1:14:34] and put those things to the side to
[1:14:36] where we're no longer standing up to
[1:14:38] move on promises of god instead we want
[1:14:41] to take and make excuses for different
[1:14:43] things and accept things but i believe
[1:14:45] as believers tonight we are not setting
[1:14:47] here to make excuses or to accept
[1:14:50] something well this is the way i'll be
[1:14:52] the rest of my life i don't believe that
[1:14:54] i believe that believers are able to
[1:14:56] stand with the promise of god and are
[1:14:59] able to discern between the three realms
[1:15:02] of their life and realize that spirit
[1:15:04] that human spirit that ain't me this
[1:15:07] flesh that ain't me but the real me is
[1:15:10] that soul on the inside that's been
[1:15:13] redeemed by the power of almighty god
[1:15:15] and greater is he that is in me than he
[1:15:18] that's in the world
[1:15:22] oh brother samuel that's awful steep
[1:15:24] well then it was awful steep the way
[1:15:25] brother branham took it brother branham
[1:15:27] sat there at the table and confessed his
[1:15:29] healing
[1:15:32] brother brown never said well you know
[1:15:33] it's a medical condition i'll always
[1:15:34] have this medical condition the way the
[1:15:36] rest of my life
[1:15:38] it had kind of been hard to preach
[1:15:39] divine healing wouldn't it
[1:15:42] you understand how satan will move in so
[1:15:44] subtly where things are become accepted
[1:15:47] it may be something that you could have
[1:15:49] dealt with whether it's medically
[1:15:50] whether it's something some strain
[1:15:52] through your family whatever that it
[1:15:53] might be some besetting sin or whatever
[1:15:56] more we do not have to be acceptive of
[1:15:58] these things we are born of a higher
[1:16:01] life
[1:16:04] but sometimes those things can just
[1:16:06] creep on in there instead of brother
[1:16:08] branham he continued to confess that
[1:16:11] promise
[1:16:13] and you know when he was healed
[1:16:15] when he stepped across
[1:16:18] the banister of time is that right on
[1:16:21] the wings of a snow white dove saw that
[1:16:22] seven squirrel that one how that it
[1:16:24] would be conquered but in the meantime
[1:16:26] what did you hear you heard that
[1:16:29] confession of victory i wonder how many
[1:16:31] people sat in the meetings that dealt
[1:16:33] with ulcerated conditions and situations
[1:16:36] in their stomach that when they would
[1:16:38] hear that testimony that there would be
[1:16:41] a spark of faith that would move down
[1:16:43] there on the inside i also wonder how
[1:16:46] many devils wanted to come to the
[1:16:48] platform and say you're still battling
[1:16:51] it but he could say i'm not looking at
[1:16:54] that i'm looking at a promise that's
[1:16:57] more sure than the symptoms i'm feeling
[1:17:08] joshua
[1:17:09] let me go into this quote here a little
[1:17:11] bit and i'll try to try to come down
[1:17:13] here
[1:17:14] joshua i want you to watch this wording
[1:17:17] joshua
[1:17:18] had no way
[1:17:20] to knowing
[1:17:22] that he could take the city
[1:17:25] are you hearing me now had no way of
[1:17:26] knowing
[1:17:28] he said caleb had no way of knowing
[1:17:30] anything either
[1:17:31] but here's how they
[1:17:33] believed it
[1:17:35] because god
[1:17:37] said so
[1:17:41] believing is greater than knowing
[1:17:45] you can know a lot of things but
[1:17:46] believing's greater than knowing
[1:17:49] right because to believe itself is
[1:17:51] inspiration that has come to your heart
[1:17:53] that goes beyond your reasoning your
[1:17:56] understanding it goes beyond all that so
[1:17:58] joshua didn't know
[1:18:01] he could take that city but he believed
[1:18:06] oh i like that don't you
[1:18:08] he didn't know he could do it but he
[1:18:10] believed because god had said i've given
[1:18:13] you the land
[1:18:15] every promise oh i'll tell you this is
[1:18:16] good this is right down where the rubber
[1:18:18] meets the road it's good things to take
[1:18:20] with us there are things that you and i
[1:18:22] can look at and we do not know
[1:18:25] but we can believe god
[1:18:28] if there's one thing we can do we can
[1:18:30] trust him
[1:18:32] is that right
[1:18:33] hey god god ain't fake news
[1:18:37] now god he said he is the truth the life
[1:18:41] and the way
[1:18:42] right god don't puff you up one way and
[1:18:45] knock it out from you enough no god god
[1:18:47] says is the truth
[1:18:50] and in this hour we're not just talking
[1:18:52] about the truth itself and looking at
[1:18:54] truth but the person of truth himself is
[1:18:58] here and he's revealed himself in this
[1:19:00] generation as the amen
[1:19:05] the soviet of god
[1:19:08] see joshua brother braham said it like
[1:19:10] this joshua had found out that he'd seen
[1:19:12] that great and living god there in the
[1:19:14] pillar of fire and all the miracles that
[1:19:16] he had performed he had confidence that
[1:19:18] god would keep his word
[1:19:20] now footsteps
[1:19:22] is possession
[1:19:25] now i know this is simple we've heard
[1:19:27] these
[1:19:28] statements perhaps many of us many times
[1:19:30] we've spoke of it but but you're making
[1:19:32] footsteps
[1:19:34] we're making footsteps it's not us
[1:19:36] standing in the same place
[1:19:39] there's got to be movement and as
[1:19:40] believers we sure ain't going backwards
[1:19:44] right we're not going backwards
[1:19:46] because even when the battle gets rough
[1:19:48] and it gets hard david said he's making
[1:19:49] my feet like heinz feet
[1:19:52] amen my feet have been planted and been
[1:19:54] established so there are footsteps our
[1:19:56] possession let's take every inch of
[1:19:58] ground that god has given us if you
[1:20:00] haven't got the baptism of the holy
[1:20:02] ghost this is what peter said the
[1:20:04] promise is unto you and to your children
[1:20:06] to them that's afar off as many as the
[1:20:09] lord our god shall call
[1:20:11] i'll tell you if you don't have the holy
[1:20:13] ghost don't listen to a liar and tries
[1:20:15] to tell you it's not for you
[1:20:20] listen to what the word of god is saying
[1:20:23] amen listen to him who is the truth
[1:20:26] notice footprints is possession
[1:20:29] let's go get it it's ours jesus christ
[1:20:32] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:20:34] let's possess it the works that i do
[1:20:36] shall you do also now let me just hear
[1:20:39] this last little statement
[1:20:41] let's possess it
[1:20:43] it's god's promise
[1:20:45] don't look at the circumstances
[1:20:49] don't look at how hard it is let's
[1:20:52] possess the land
[1:20:54] that's how we look at the unseen
[1:20:57] is the word of god comes to us and
[1:21:01] speaks to our heart and that promise
[1:21:04] that god has made and what's inspired to
[1:21:07] our heart that's what we're to take and
[1:21:09] we're to confess it as our own
[1:21:12] listen friends the reason many times we
[1:21:14] don't get any further is because we're
[1:21:16] waiting on something to happen before we
[1:21:18] ever confess anything
[1:21:22] come on now
[1:21:24] oh brother samuel you know i want the
[1:21:25] holy ghost bill so bad david said i've
[1:21:28] set the lord always before me
[1:21:30] i shall not be moved
[1:21:33] if i didn't get it this service i'm
[1:21:34] gonna get it i'm gonna i'm gonna receive
[1:21:37] it he is the pursuit of my life he's all
[1:21:40] that i desire i have set the lord i put
[1:21:43] aside everything else i got everything
[1:21:46] else out of the way i'm only setting the
[1:21:48] lord before me
[1:21:52] every promise let's possess it
[1:21:55] take a hold of every promise of almighty
[1:21:58] god don't look at the circumstances
[1:22:01] don't look at how hard it is let's
[1:22:03] possess the land so that's part of the
[1:22:05] of the possession
[1:22:06] remember the bible would say that even
[1:22:09] will either be justified or condemned by
[1:22:11] our words
[1:22:13] it also said that
[1:22:15] life and death is in the power of the
[1:22:17] tongue
[1:22:19] come on now sometimes the way that we
[1:22:21] talk is what causes the
[1:22:22] atmosphere the things we go to talking
[1:22:25] on and then we start then we start
[1:22:26] confessing those things we've been
[1:22:29] entertaining in that atmosphere
[1:22:31] and it ain't god that confesses negative
[1:22:34] because every promise in him is jay and
[1:22:36] amen
[1:22:39] amen well i must not be that good god
[1:22:42] never gave you that inspiration i must
[1:22:44] not be that good of a daddy i must not
[1:22:46] be that good of a mama i must not be
[1:22:48] that god never gave you that inspiration
[1:22:51] the bible said as a man taketh in his
[1:22:53] heart so easy you need to take the
[1:22:56] thoughts of almighty god i can do all
[1:22:58] things through christ that strengthens
[1:23:00] me i may not be the best or where i
[1:23:02] should be right now but i've got
[1:23:04] confidence that god who has brought me
[1:23:07] this far will direct me the rest of the
[1:23:10] way as a believer as a father as a
[1:23:13] mother as a husband as a wife my god
[1:23:16] will direct me
[1:23:21] i'm weak let the weak say
[1:23:23] i am strong
[1:23:25] let the redeemed of the lord
[1:23:28] say so
[1:23:36] glory be to god
[1:23:41] hallelujah
[1:23:44] first john 5 4.
[1:23:48] i want you just to think of this here
[1:23:51] i'm gonna come down here
[1:23:54] but don't tune me out right now
[1:23:56] just trying to find a stop and stopping
[1:23:58] place here
[1:24:00] joshua had no way to knowing he could
[1:24:02] take that city
[1:24:04] but here's what he did
[1:24:06] he believed it because god said so
[1:24:11] and you see what happened
[1:24:13] joshua
[1:24:15] he didn't pull back
[1:24:17] from jericho
[1:24:18] god had spoke to him
[1:24:21] and said be strong and of a good courage
[1:24:27] and he told
[1:24:28] him where to draw his strength and
[1:24:31] courage from
[1:24:34] is that right
[1:24:37] see many of the times all these that
[1:24:39] we're seeing where joshua was standing
[1:24:41] here as a
[1:24:42] maya is a brother brandon would preach
[1:24:44] it great warrior joshua
[1:24:47] but joshua
[1:24:49] was also feeding
[1:24:50] on the message
[1:24:52] that had come through moses
[1:24:55] because it was those words they were not
[1:24:58] the words of man
[1:25:01] they were the anointed words of god
[1:25:04] that was personal
[1:25:06] here was a promise that was there in
[1:25:09] genesis with a genesis 15 i will bring
[1:25:12] them out with a mighty hand
[1:25:14] one little phrase not even a complete
[1:25:16] sentence but in that phrase would be a
[1:25:20] message that would be sealed up
[1:25:23] in that and then that little phrase
[1:25:26] there would come a lamb stepping forward
[1:25:29] come on now
[1:25:30] there would come a blood to bring them
[1:25:32] out of egypt a token are you hearing me
[1:25:34] when god takes a hold of a promise
[1:25:37] that's god himself stepping down and
[1:25:39] taking his word on himself and now we
[1:25:42] see the lamb step forward now we see
[1:25:45] redemption out of egypt now we're seeing
[1:25:48] all the promises of god it's god
[1:25:50] unfolding it in his time
[1:25:53] and so what god spoke to joshua listen
[1:25:56] joshua you're going to face things that
[1:25:59] could make you afraid
[1:26:02] and listen god wouldn't have put it in
[1:26:04] the word when he said don't be afraid
[1:26:06] don't fear how many times he say that in
[1:26:08] joshua 1.
[1:26:10] it almost sounds like oops somebody made
[1:26:12] a too many copy and paste here no
[1:26:15] god let it be known there's going to be
[1:26:17] time and time again where fear can arise
[1:26:20] but i've given you something that will
[1:26:23] cast out fear when it wants to come
[1:26:26] around your life i've got an anointed
[1:26:29] message where your name is wrote in
[1:26:31] there and you're a part of that word and
[1:26:34] you can draw strength
[1:26:36] from the lord in this hour
[1:26:43] so joshua when he came
[1:26:46] here he is
[1:26:48] joshua is sitting there
[1:26:51] and they've come across the land
[1:26:53] and god's got everything just right
[1:26:59] after they've crossed jordan been
[1:27:01] circumcised they've kept the passover
[1:27:04] now here comes the old corn
[1:27:07] he won the coincidence
[1:27:09] it was right on time
[1:27:13] you know what the old coin was it was a
[1:27:15] product of beth
[1:27:16] death burial and resurrection
[1:27:19] the life that went in the ground now has
[1:27:22] come up and we are partakers of that
[1:27:24] life
[1:27:26] they were eating of the old corn of the
[1:27:28] land the promises that god made they are
[1:27:31] now partaking of that promise
[1:27:34] hallelujah
[1:27:36] and so
[1:27:38] when joshua goes out here
[1:27:41] standing around jericho
[1:27:43] he's been
[1:27:45] he's been feasting on the word
[1:27:48] now friends don't listen now this this
[1:27:50] comes down to everyday life
[1:27:54] sometimes the reason that we
[1:27:58] don't have is like brother brown would
[1:27:59] say angels showing up
[1:28:01] in visitations
[1:28:03] is because
[1:28:04] we failed to keep him on our minds
[1:28:07] over the same if i just didn't have this
[1:28:09] bad situation in front of me you know
[1:28:10] i'd be able to no no you're made
[1:28:13] to possess that situation
[1:28:16] you're made to master it
[1:28:20] i think how god led brother jack
[1:28:22] standing right here the other day
[1:28:25] when he was ministering sometimes he
[1:28:27] said when you don't even
[1:28:29] uh how do you say that about praying
[1:28:30] where it seems like you just can't find
[1:28:32] the words to even pray or you just
[1:28:34] you're so weary he says at that time
[1:28:36] remember he's talking about worship
[1:28:38] start singing a song
[1:28:40] put on some music
[1:28:44] are you hearing me
[1:28:46] put on some music
[1:28:48] put on the message
[1:28:51] oh brother salmon you just don't
[1:28:52] understand no i do understand
[1:28:55] i do understand
[1:28:56] i believe that god has given us just
[1:28:58] what we have need of in this generation
[1:29:03] is that right
[1:29:05] we are made partakers of it so to come
[1:29:07] into that place let me just let me close
[1:29:09] right there
[1:29:10] joshua stands right by that wall but he
[1:29:13] has been drawing from the lord
[1:29:16] so when he comes
[1:29:18] standing and looking at those walls
[1:29:20] he's looking at him
[1:29:22] i'm sure there's a lot of thoughts could
[1:29:24] enter through his mind because the
[1:29:25] devil's always right there to give
[1:29:26] opposition like
[1:29:28] man look at this they can run chariot
[1:29:30] races up there on those walls and you're
[1:29:31] getting into this city
[1:29:33] it's tight buddy
[1:29:34] i don't know how you're going to get in
[1:29:35] there but joshua in the greatest battle
[1:29:38] ever fought
[1:29:39] had
[1:29:40] to take those thoughts
[1:29:42] and bring him into obedience
[1:29:45] and you know the first way you bring
[1:29:46] them into obedience capture them
[1:29:49] and you know the first way you capture
[1:29:50] them stop them
[1:29:52] you say well i can't now you can buy
[1:29:54] your heads and say lord forgive me lord
[1:29:56] god for those thoughts those are my
[1:29:57] thoughts are going through my mind i
[1:29:59] don't want those thoughts in my mind
[1:30:00] lord your word is true
[1:30:02] come on now
[1:30:04] and you're able to take on those
[1:30:06] thoughts that are coming through there
[1:30:07] and say but lord your word is true
[1:30:12] is that right
[1:30:13] now i don't know how it's going to come
[1:30:14] about
[1:30:16] but i know
[1:30:17] that this city belongs to us
[1:30:22] in about that time
[1:30:25] joshua sees
[1:30:27] a man
[1:30:28] now this man wasn't away from the battle
[1:30:32] he was leading him into the battle
[1:30:37] and joshua ran to him drew his sword and
[1:30:40] he wasn't there like christian bookstore
[1:30:42] theology you know with
[1:30:43] flames shooting out his legs and
[1:30:46] no he
[1:30:48] was a man
[1:30:51] despised and rejected
[1:30:54] we didn't steam him not
[1:30:58] joshua drew his sword and said are you
[1:31:00] for us
[1:31:01] or against us
[1:31:03] because if you're against us i'm taking
[1:31:05] your head off right now
[1:31:07] no man shall be able to stand before
[1:31:09] thee all the days of thy life
[1:31:12] it didn't matter how big he looked it
[1:31:13] didn't matter what size he was joshua
[1:31:16] had a promise and he knew listen to me
[1:31:19] he was in line with the word of god
[1:31:25] and those words came out
[1:31:27] i'm the
[1:31:28] captain of the lord's host
[1:31:32] i am come down
[1:31:34] to lead you
[1:31:35] in this battle
[1:31:38] i am come down to lead you
[1:31:41] in victory
[1:31:43] and joshua as soon as he hears it
[1:31:46] he falls down and begins to worship
[1:31:52] don't look funny you and i do the same
[1:31:53] thing as soon as an answer comes
[1:31:55] thank you lord jesus sometimes the
[1:31:58] answer will come in words sometimes
[1:32:00] audibly some indifferent but sometimes
[1:32:02] the answer just comes it's just the
[1:32:04] peace of god it just it just drops down
[1:32:06] and how wonderful it is
[1:32:09] to have an answer from god
[1:32:11] but in the meantime as we're looking at
[1:32:13] the walls know
[1:32:15] that that city
[1:32:16] belongs to us
[1:32:18] this promise
[1:32:20] belongs to us
[1:32:21] and the god who made the promise is
[1:32:23] certain to bring it to past what must i
[1:32:26] do i confess the promise
[1:32:30] bring every thought in subjection to the
[1:32:32] obedience of christ cast down every
[1:32:35] imagination every thought that tells you
[1:32:38] you'll never get over that every thought
[1:32:40] that tells you you'll never get beyond
[1:32:42] it you bring that thought in subjection
[1:32:44] by the word of god you've been given a
[1:32:47] higher authority than any
[1:32:50] ink from a doctor
[1:32:53] is that right we've got a greater report
[1:32:56] i mean my bible doesn't have
[1:32:58] superscriptions written in it does yours
[1:33:00] that has like he's the lord that healeth
[1:33:02] all our diseases and there's a little
[1:33:03] superscript that says accept
[1:33:06] pandemics
[1:33:08] except
[1:33:09] does your say that
[1:33:12] if it did you better bury that version
[1:33:14] are you with me he's the lord that
[1:33:17] healeth all our diseases
[1:33:20] no matter if his physical realm
[1:33:22] spiritual realm so he's the lord that
[1:33:25] healeth all our diseases
[1:33:28] oh glory be to god aren't you glad for
[1:33:30] that
[1:33:31] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[1:33:33] of prayer heavenly father

[1:36:47] of those things that sledgehammer still
[1:36:48] lays in a part of this life here and

[1:37:51] going to confess it until the effects
[1:37:53] and the evidence are evident

[1:38:00] priest of my confession
[1:38:03] you want to make the lord jesus you want
[1:38:05] to draw him near you want you want to

[1:44:25] about this what i've always said
[1:44:28] i come back to an example that i'm so
[1:44:30] glad that we have
[1:44:32] sister dao
[1:44:34] was prayed for
[1:44:36] come right across the prayer line

[1:44:43] she started
[1:44:44] things started coming right back started
[1:44:46] going downhill so brother brother brown

[1:44:58] down here you know you hear brother and
[1:44:59] sister down

[1:45:10] keep taking that medicine he said
[1:45:13] god will confirm all that
[1:45:16] i tell you i could go on and on with
[1:45:18] situations like this i thank god for the
[1:45:21] balance
[1:45:22] of this message
[1:45:24] [Applause]
[1:45:26] there was a big wall standing in front
[1:45:28] of jericho standing in front of him
[1:45:30] jericho whatever you want to call it
[1:45:31] standing in front of brother neville for
[1:45:33] the neville getting to a certain age in
[1:45:35] his body where certain things with with
[1:45:37] men and things like that and troubles
[1:45:39] can come up and brother adam just pulls
[1:45:41] him aside and brother brown tells him
[1:45:42] brother neville there's vitamins down at
[1:45:44] that local drugstore you go and start
[1:45:46] taking these certain vitamins
[1:45:49] why because these bodies are broke down

[1:45:56] where a lady and here he had a situation
[1:45:58] where the baby and everything else
[1:46:00] wasn't getting well and the holy spirit
[1:46:01] revealed by vision that the woman would
[1:46:03] not give it cough medicine because she
[1:46:05] was afraid that giving medicine was a
[1:46:07] sign of no faith
[1:46:09] see how god cares god would address that
[1:46:13] when brother dalton is he's come to me
[1:46:14] i'm going to tell him brother dalton was
[1:46:16] coming through the line with one of his

[1:46:23] line and the little baby the little boy
[1:46:26] and you know there's a lot of people
[1:46:28] that want to be prayed for you could

[1:46:33] brother brother dalton to the side he
[1:46:35] said brother dalton he said i'm going to
[1:46:36] pray for the baby but just so you know
[1:46:39] there's cough medicine down at the store
[1:46:41] that would have helped this
[1:46:45] glory be to god you say brother samuel
[1:46:47] why are you saying glory be to god
[1:46:49] because you recognize no matter how it's
[1:46:51] going to get done the walls are coming
