yes Lord Jesus the truth the way I bless your name [Music] I bless your amen hallelujah what a wonderful privilege that God has given us this morning to be able to come together and amen to Fellowship around the word of the Lord and be able to and receive strength and encouragement and that he'll Minister just exactly ly what we have need of that's my prayer is that God will just speak to us what we have need of there's things that I that he's laid on my heart and we've had here for some time but God knows how to put it all together he knows what needs to be said knows exactly how that the words and the emphasis and so we just we certainly want his his leading this morning don't we amen we're certainly we're not gathered here this morning by accident it's not by chance but this is a it's a real Divine appointment Amen to be able to be gathered in the presence of God sometimes I know we we look at it and and because within the natural and the senses and this realm that we live in it can just seem like sometimes that we're going through the motions is sometimes you feel that way you don't sometimes other times you you feel if I can say it in this way you feel more spiritual and then there's other times where you're acting in obedience to the word not by your feelings cuz if you went by your feelings you wouldn't be here and let me just tell you something that in itself is greater than when you do feel spiritual because God is able to look upon us as his children and say they're not serving me based on their feelings because there's beautiful days out like today today A beautiful day is that right we love the Sun but when it gets the gloom and you get the gray clouds over man those things can be difficult days and times but you see this is where God made it so that our lives were not made to really spiritually be regulated by Lights by feelings this is why that God wanted us and draws us into that of the innermost Court of his presence because that's the shikina light that that's God's own light that's God and no matter what comes no matter what test no matter what trial nothing can put that out that's a joy that's an anchor that no matter how the elements change no matter how things change there's a constant and that's what the true Holy Spirit brings in our lives and through that God gives us a leadership how to really really conduct Our Lives you love him this morning God is so good he's faithful I couldn't help it this morning on the way to to church and I just begin to worship and just just crying and thinking about the goodness of God how God is so faithful and so merciful to us amen and um so I certainly want to say thank you for your prayers for uh my wife and um it um finally got settled pretty late last night and uh but it's right as it comes out of the kidney and I'm trusting that we're believing that that kidney stone is going to fully pass and uh you know when we got in there yesterday the emergency room they said you know are you sure I said we're sure we've been here many times before we're sure U but um I just thank you for your prayers and we're just believing that I'm I'm believing God that while the ministering of the word is going going forth that while she's there at home laying there on the couch that the spirit of God can move right down for that need I believe the same thing for your need amen your loved one those that's not able to be here with us this morning I believe he's the same God he's no respector person he's mindful don't you love him he's so good to us let's just pray Heavenly Father what a privilege it is to be gathered together Lord as brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith now father maybe Lord some Lord here this morning maybe Lord they've had to press Beyond different situations and sometimes Lord even feelings like we just spoke moments ago but father they're standing here because of an obedience to your word and we believe Lord that you have something for us Lord Jesus so Lord we take every every situation we take every concern and we place it on the altar of almighty God for you said if two or three agree is touching any one thing it shall be done amen ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise them up amen I'm the Lord that Health all thy diseases father for every single request Lord upon every heart of your children this morning may you move Lord accordingly may you Lord grant me the grace that I can get out of the way so that you can come and speak to us we want to hear from you Lord just one word just even a few words is more more Lord is more meaningful Lord than anything else now Lord we just invite you take control Lord in the remaining part of this service have your way we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you this morning I I'm going to want to say thank you to the musicians and uh I'm going to invite you into the scriptures here to 1 John chapter 4 and I want to just read just a few verses here and uh I want to say we're supposed to have a fellowship dinner next week but sister Amanda she's going to need some help and um I know she's her her back that's why she's sitting back there from the fall that she had some weeks ago and she didn't ask me to say this and um but I just asking that maybe we can kind of U move together of the sisters brothers different ones and and try to help out and shoulder this that load right now if you have a question because we we all appreciate those Fellowship dinners don't we I do yeah I do I I think it's something that's very it's very beneficial to us as a body and it'll probably be a while before we have another one um but um if if you wouldn't mind it would be a great help just to uh reach out to brother Aaron sister Amanda and ask what can we do in this time to lighten lighten that and to help out so um if uh if you need their number I'm sure someone can get that to you and I hope that's all right if it's not I'll take I'll take the tomatoes for it but I just I really I'm asking for that if we could um also the sample books that are out there of the church age books uh sealed books if you want to order one put it down on the list out there uh for those of you uh frenchspeaking and I know we have frenchs speaking population now so I'm working on that I've got I'm I'm sending out fillers for that brother Barry's supposed to get back with me and I'm trying to to get all of those things filled as well so uh just trusting that'll that'll um come to fruition 1 John 4:1 17 herein is our love made perfect or rather that the love of God May perfect Among Us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world that that's where that comes from because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment and he that fearth is not made perfect in love and we love him because he first loved us amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word I want to to continue on this just to try to he a few moments and try to tie this portion up here this morning as we've been looking at this and I want to begin back as we were looking at this on on the love of God and perhaps just to kind of just move right in and give the the setting for it when we look at that of that scripture of 1 John 4 and I want to just kind of set it in this way and then just move into a few quotations that the prophet makes to kind of draw trying to draw us into the same mind and the thought but you know this scripture when it is speaking here it's never it's not saying that there would not be times that fear will not come around your life it's not saying that you won't experience fear it's not saying that things won't take place in that way but this is what the scripture is referring to it's dealing with where we have a confidence and a settl by the love of God through the holy spirit because the love of God and the Holy Ghost are one and the same that where when we have a confidence that where the love of God has reached in the depths of our soul and has changed our life has changed our nature our desires and our only desire is to please him when his word comes across our pathway and corrects us God it can sting but our desire is to please him and it's also a love that reaches that trust him yes even when things seem to be going backwards yes sir it's a it's a constant that holds you it's it's very much like that in a real Godly marriage that love is the glue that holds you together and that love is what gives you confidence to where you're not worried about one another I wonder where he's at or I wonder where she's at and but it's a it's a real love that gives you a confidence that no matter if you around on another part of the world you've got a confidence by love of that there is no worry there's no fear now if that would be in the natural Union of where you would take a man and a woman that would fall in love and a real a real love within their heart for one another that they can't even explain how much deeper is the love of God because that love that we're speaking of is a fial love between that of a man and a woman and yet we understand in our own lives as as Believers and as married people that I don't want to just walk in my marriage under the aelio love but I want the agape love to be over the AAL love because AAL love is a love that is based on many times of friendships and and there there is a care and and there are things that's there but agape love is where it goes beyond even when there are things that may not be so uh um uh let me say easy or things of where there's disagreement but there's a love that goes beyond that and that's the love that agape love that doesn't keep records agape love I'm I'm just quoting 1 Corinthians 13 it don't it doesn't it doesn't keep any records it's not you know has a file cabinet and digs it out when it's convenient to bring it back up to you no no love doesn't do that now listen our love cannot do that but God's love in our life it it will and it does produce a real true genuine forgiveness yes sir yes sir and it's it's real it's it's a it's a hidden power in our life and it moves in our life and and it works even as we grow in the Lord the love of God as Paul would say it in one way it is shed abroad in our hearts it it's taking over more of Our Lives as the more that we are yielding and giving ourselves to him and then you may ask the question how do I know that I'm yielding more to him how do I know that more is taking over my life well we can watch the attributes of how are things coming about in our life where is there change that's taking place within our life but you know many of the times we do not even realize where we in ourselves are falling short unless the word of God would point it out see this is why it's the beauty of and we need that of Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is quick alive it's powerful it's sharper than any two-edged sword now I'm not saying that the person could but not read their Bible as you would through the week or listen to the message of the hour or even you know maybe you're reading a sign as you go down the road and the spirit of God could strike your heart I believe that we can live so in tune with God to where that God can speak to us even through nature but it doesn't those things do not replace the assembling as the scripture said the assembling of ourselves together because you see it's something about when the Living Word comes forth that it's not anything and and all of that is the Living Word but you understand that when the word comes it will discern Our Lives because sometimes we can feel that everything is right on the money and you know you know we've got our favorite mirror that we like that makes us look skinny instead of plump and we have those things about it and you know certain things and but yet the word of God it doesn't present to us what we're thinking the word of God displays to us the things even that would be lacking in our life now the word of God will come in times and it will correct us like in manners like that show us where we're lacking and then there's other times the word of God will come to encourage us and yet every time God corrects us he's also going to encourage Us in the right matters as well and so these are things within our life that the love of God it is always something in our life that as a Believer it is things that we would say God I believe it should be our prayer Lord I desire more of the love of God I I wanted to so completely take control of every part of my life every relationship I want the love of God to be the the Central and the reigning factor in my life yes sir and you'll find that even as you walk with God how that the love of God even grows deeper I mean because it's God's love that found you and I when we were in our sin is that right it it it it led us to repentance it it didn't show us that hey you're without hope but the real love of God being made manifest shows us there is a way out and I am your way it lets us know there is a way back there is there is a place that of Deliverance there's a place of freedom and and all of that there's a place in my house but that's where the love of God comes it begins to deal with our hearts it begins our minds begin to term to that but with the ultimate goal is where the love of God would find its residence Amen in our heart amen not just in our Minden not just in our emotions it had God the love of God is what's working on our life to turn our life but God's desire is that that love of God his own Spirit his life would fill the very center of our life and that's not something that you you or I have done or could do that's a sovereign work of God there's not one of you nor myself that gave our own selves the Holy Ghost it was God who even by his love would condition our hearts to a place to where our faith would become acceptive in his sight yes that's good and then the holy spirit is the Seal of our faith yeah who's done it all it's God we are his workmanship so it's God working it's not you it's not him that willth nor him that runneth it is God that showeth Mercy amen that's what the love of God at work in our lives now when you look at this throughout let me read a few quotations brother BM says in Divine love and Sovereign Grace he said the greatest hindrance that there is in the church today he says among other people people everywhere is fear but love perfect love cast out fear and it says the reason your fearful is because the right Temperance of love has never entered yet when there's real love all fear passes away when you really love the Lord now what is he speaking of here with the right Temperance it's just as said moments ago where where when the right Temperance where the where the the holy Spirit the love of God has come into the very depths of our soul where it is no longer a wondering did he do it for me am I included in this is this is this really about me but it's where that it actually becomes something that is absolutely personal that Calvary becomes a personal revelation let me just tell you the power of that that if there was no one else he would have did it for you because you belong to him he didn't let me just say this to you he did not become flesh for the masses that's good that's so good he became one of us the Bible said for the son of man is come to seek and save them that were lost that's so good now if you you know my car keys are my car keys if I lose them they're my car keys that are lost they're not yours and this is where when God coming down he come down to find what always belonged to him sin separated us sin got in the way but he came down what brought him down his love it was love that brought him down yes it it was love the where when he walked in a life that was despised and rejected he bore that humiliation he bore that reproach he bore all of the stripes he took it all for you and me that was the love of God being displayed not because we were worthy we weren't worthy we were not we were not living lives even list listen even him seeing way ahead in time and could see the conditions that we would be in the situations that we would be found in but he did not look at the situations and determine whether or not we were worthy of his love because the situations were that you and I were in the darkness that we were enshrouded in that is not who we were it's the atmosphere that was around our life but the love of God came and it broke that atmosphere and it revealed what was there the whole time a son and daughter of God the love of God does not make you a son and daughter of God it only reveals to you who you always were that's why the scripture said beloved 1 John 3 uh uh that now oh consider this love what manner of love that we should be called the sons of God let me tell you something you a person could walk right into a meeting and be bound in everything else and they can the spirit of God takes a hold and begins to say you're my son you're my daughter you say how can you say that with habits and everything else and sin even not have repented yet because the word is letting you know who you are and you're living beneath your privileges Hallelujah the love of God doesn't mince words the word word is Discerning beneath your Darkness who you [Applause] are so good and Satan's always about trying to bring fear yes but there's a place where that of the right Temperance would enter in where you're able to walk daily with a confidence that everything can be going wrong around you you don't even know the next step to take but there's a joy that someone say and it isn't maybe you're even smiling but there's a joy there's something that when you wake up in the morning that you know that you know that you know that you know it's settled like the like the old song said the old account was settled long ago Hallelujah you know what has done that not your works not my works the love of God and you know what it is don't try don't try to to barter with it because you and I could never do anything that would Merit the love of God don't try to work your way into it accept it say God let the love of God let it move deeper into my life Hallelujah Samuel I've had a lot of people let me down let me just tell you even every week even sitting here can let one another down but there is one amen who will never let you down and that is the Lord Jesus Christ as a matter of fact the Bible says even when we ourselves you know be be be in a in a place yet he abideth faithful yes he does even in those times and moments he does not abandon you and I and say I hadn't heard from you in a while I haven't you haven't talked to you in a while or I see you kind of you know maybe you're floundering a little bit and you feel that in your own Spirit but yet listen to me he's not abandoned you he's a friend that sticking closer than a brother he's not a friend that you've got to somehow make yourself do something or look like something or or something in order to be accepted let me tell you he accepted you before the foundation of the world you were accepted in the mind of God where the lamb was slain the pritu your way back the love of God already made a way back Hallelujah that's right and when that strikes that right Temperance of love it settles in it settles into our life let me just say this to you even with that there's things that God continues to speak to us and remind us and tell us who we are because let me just say this to you you see the person in the mirror every single day you have whispered in your ears all your failures all your disappointments and this is this is the challenge and let me just say not only the challenge but this will be such a great Victory is for a people that'll be able to take the word above their own thoughts right right above their own feelings of their own self I'm not talking about where we're ignoring I'm not talking about ignoring sin I'm talking about that you know where you're standing and you're no longer looking at your own self am that will affect the way that you walk in this life when you're no longer looking at your love to God it's not your love you love him because he first loved you your love will wear out my love love would wear out but his love his love endured it moved through Noah it moved through Abraham it moved through Jeremiah it moved through Elijah and the same love of God it moves through your life it's not about your love it's about his [Applause] love the Rapture is about his love coming to claim what his love has perfected is so good Hallelujah for a people walking in these in these places these temporary booths these Dwelling Places and we've got life above us hallelujah life in us the prophet said the church is lacking in Divine love he said I don't mean affection and love one for another I mean agape love have it so richly into your heart until you just love the Lord in everything and you just take his word for it and you don't mistrust him yes Hallelujah that's so good brother BR said the greatest hindrance that the Christian church has is fear Christianity is not a try at it it's a noo it's something that is real let me tell you the whole point of the Gospel is rest is rest rest in what a finished work amen that that's the same way let me just say this to you you can discern every spirit that comes to you if it wants to put a wedge between you and the rest of God that's the devil well brother Samuel I I may not be where I ought to be but remember the spirit of God will never come to a place to point you that there's no way out but even in our error and even in our wrong the spirit of God comes to correct us but he'll always correct us with the view of Calvary but Satan will always punch you to a dead end Street your life is not a dead end [Applause] Street yes we had to come to a place in our life where we realize it's an end of me I'm tired of me you get tired of being Samuel Jacob got tired of being Jacob you've got to get tired of being you and when you get tired of being you then God himself will step in Jacob was a deceiver but on the inside there was a there was a hidden Mystery he was a prince the whole time he was being subdued by so many other things but one moment in the presence of God he came out of there a limping Prince it affected his walk in every other part of his [Music] life yes now rman goes on to say in another place he says said I want to talk on faith a little while just to build up your Christian faith one of the greatest hindrance that the church has got today is that you're scared to death what are you scared about that that's what I'm wondering if you'll just only realize you don't know who you are God you don't know who's sitting next to you right well let me just say let me just pause on this for a moment you're not going to find out who you are from YouTube you're not going to find out who you are you see you see one of the things the devil likes to do is try to Cloud over and he'll want to take you away from the source that tells you who you are that's right come on sometimes you you you you can get down you get all clouded here you know sometimes even from young believers the middle one or more you get down and you get clouded over and you know what it is what Satan's trying to do is break you away from the source that holds the true mystery of your life and releases strength to you that's very true you you can't find out who you are from any other source but the word of God and let me tell you the more time you spend in the word of God you'll find out who you are because the scripture said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God it's going to take a little bit more than just just coming to church on Sunday and just coming on Thursday it's going to require a real relationship and you getting in the word of God yourself to realize that God allowed this to be printed for me this is a love letter to me God sent the message to illuminate this word to my life it was from me God sent the message for me you said do you know he said he didn't say behold I send unto behold I send unto you behold I send unto you Elijah that is so good it's personal the love of God is personal Hallelujah Oh Glory he says oh well you say who's sitting next to me that's my neighbor I know I know him all right but he's a Son of God right adopted by Jesus Christ into the family that's a daughter of God you're sitting next to and who are you if you're a Christian believer you're a Son of God what are you scared about no need of being scared as long as the devil can keep you scared right that's all he wants to do he's got you right then right if he can just keep you afraid now that works even throughout all of our life to it's constant we're the enemy as I said now once we've got that inner man taken care of where the love of God has come in then that through perfect love that's what'll cast out fear because fear has torment fears can come oh don't don't don't let don't let there be a misconception as though that you're going to walk around in this life and you're not going to experience fear from time to time right the prophet himself in the message go tell he was there and had a sinus condition and a and a fever and it wasn't breaking people were praying for him and finally God re God showed up in a vision because he went off into the din room and the reason he went off into the den room is because he had just at this time the you know you're sick we've all been sick and you get into a condition you're a sick man there's things start swirling and he looked at sister mey said you know what sometimes I doubt whether I'm even called or not I thank God those things are included like that so sister mey said the reason he was in that Den room act a little bit like us sometimes she said you ought to be ashamed of yourself he said so I went there just kind of laid over you know the bed I was a little B I got rebuked you know but as he laid there here came a vision of Calvary and the light shining through and the Holy Spirit said now I have confirmed the furtherance of your com your commission to you but you haven't accepted it and so the prophet said then Lord I accept it and he said as soon as I said that The Fever broke Hall the condition broke right there amen and then he goes on to explain to you and I what was going on he said what it was I was afraid of failure and and he goes on to explain what it was he said he takes you know he hears about thing from General Patton on the radio and a quotation and he said so then he refers to that he said what it is he said I've come to that place he said if I put a bullet in and it doesn't go off I'll take it out and put another one in let me bring that down home for us that's putting a promise right in the word of right in the gun if that promise doesn't go off it's filled with all kinds of promises maybe we we got the wrong promise in there but there's a promise for my life for this situation and I'm going to keep on putting bullets in the gun come on Friends these bullets are loaded the promises of God are not duds these are not like a box of snaps you got as a little boy or a little girl you threw this one down it didn't go off you threw that one down and went off then you go back and get this other one throw it down again it don't go off throw it down again it don't go off finally you go over and smash it it don't go off this that's not how the word of God is every promise in him is filled with a boom a yes and amen there's no Duds in the fireworks of God's promises you don't got to doctor it up right just let Faith light it off and have enough humility to say maybe I was I maybe I didn't have the right promise in the gun at the right time but God show me the right bullet to put in this gun prise the Lord is that all right so love brings confidence let me just refer to this love brings confidence that's what the love of God does because love produces Faith that's why Paul could say in that scripture reading there that Christ would dwell in our hearts this was his prayer that we would be rooted and grounded in love how many of you know that with plants plants continue to be rooted down continue to be grounded how many of you know that you plan it it begins to get established but you may have to be really careful with that for a number of years until it finally takes right and that's the same in our life listen the new birth does not come in our life the love of God down and dwelling there in the midst of our soul and all of a sudden we we we don't need anym no we need more we need to grow God is not coming and and forgive me I don't I don't know how I to say it it come to me God's not coming to to Rapture the seven dwares right he's coming to Rapture mature Sons and Daughters of God right we start out as babies right and and even throughout the the time that that we're together but we've got to grow now the scripture says you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've received the spirit of adoption or that which will lead you to full adoption whereby you cry Abba Father so through that through the indwelling of his Spirit that's where you can cry out that th art my father right the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we're the children of God Amen 2 Timothy 1:7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind so it it fear is not of God right amen fear does not come from God that's right now I'm saying that with this regards because situations in life see seasons of Life times of Life circumstances fear can come around your life but I want you this is one place you can stand on that God never gave a spirit of fear as a matter of fact the Bible says in Hebrews 2 he had come to destroy that that which was over men's lives that held him in the bondage of fear what do you talking about the bondage of fear job said the thing which I feared is come upon me what was said that job feared it was death it was the unknown come on down I'm not in the message I don't have time to go through all the quotes but this is the part that job himself it was unknown it was not revealed to them yet but to you and I that the light Paul said in the book of Titus that this light has been brought that light of immortality we have a true expectation listen when the question was rised what happens to man when he died it was through the Lord Jesus Christ that the answer was made manifest when a man lays down and giveth up the ghost what happens to him now came the secret revealed on that Easter morning when the seals of where they tried to seal him in the seal was Broken Hallelujah broken just so you understand the Lord Jesus himself listen this is follow him for a moment one of the greatest acts that he ever did after all the Miracles the Bible tells us in the Book of John knowing that he come from God and goes back to God what a revelation see it only deepened in his life and the very next scripture says he GED himself and began to wash their feet you see what the glor you see what the glory of that Revelation did it brought forth humility it brought forth further service to the will of God and so he knows he knows that there's no there's no question here he is in the Garden of Gethsemane praying three times if it's possible let this cup pass from me Hebrews 5 CH chapter 5: 7 said though he were a son yet he learned obedience through the things which he suffered he was heard in that he feared with strong tears and crying right hallah I ask you what part of the Son of God was in fear was it that was it that inside part or was it that outside realm so you can see yourself hallu you know why he did that he experienced that for you and I he never painted a canvas to you and I as though well well it's soon as you have received this experience you'll never have any more problems in life quite the contrary right amen it is the tests and trials that prove the goods that's in your life it's easy to serve God when there's nothing but Mountain Toops but let it go backwards Let There Be valleys let there be hard times that's going to show what's on the inside and that's what trials do they manifest what's on the inside job never said when I get finish with this trial I'll be gold no he said I am gold right now and I'm going to be gold all the way through the only thing this test and this trial is going to do is prove that I'm gold come on friends don't hang your head on that don't hang your head on that don't let the devil get you hinged in and saying well I've let down here I've let down there but you're standing here this morning and you're agreeing with the word of God rebuke that Devil he's a liar he's a liar Hallelujah you what's taking place you're proving that there's something greater than your own emotions than your own intellect what is it it's real gold Hall real gold doesn't mean everything is absolutely just right everything is perfect and no but real gold is real gold in the midst of the fire it's real gold on the mountain it's real gold in the [Applause] valley and un like Fort Knox God likes to display his gold cuz he knows what God that gold that he's given you where there's a name written it that no no other man knoweth somebody with me now he's given you a stone of Revelation where there's a name written that no man knoweth what what you say what is that talking about that's your justification it is the it is a personal writing and Revelation between you and God that you know you passed from Death unto life you know your life has been changed it ain't about it ain't somebody else's Revelation it's your Revelation hallelujah it's got to be deeper than in someone else it's got to be a personal revelation and you know what that means when they gave that stone in the court when they gave that stone with that name written that only the person knew that their name was written in it it meant you're completely Justified no charges against you and that stone is revelation it's been revealed to you oh my my my hallelujah hallelujah so let me let me just give me a few moments to work with a little bit of this here comes and right why C I can get it right why Christ speak brother BR turns to this sister she's on the platform he the spirit of God's been calling out many people right there as you standing he said you feel now you feel different don't you sis now you go home and be well and the sister asked do you believe I'll be well well sure certainly I believe you're well see you've got that complex wrapped around you but the power of it broke just a few minutes ago now you understand what's happening it's the Holy Spirit telling her to look down your shackles are gone the chain is broken that which has held you and has stopped you and and has held that complex look at it he's telling he's directing her the power of it has broke yes that's how he's he's that's how he's able to say you will you are well why because the complex is broke the power of it let me tell you something friends we've been dealing with this on complexes for a while and let me just tell you something there every one of us even sitting in here right now there's complexes you say well how do I know what's in my life right now don't worry about it but just be like Grant was in the Civil War when they went every time they came to another city that's the time to take that City don't worry about it just take what what God brings you right right when he brings you to take it right there take it right there don't get all worried because that's also part of Satan's distractive ways he likes to smoke and screen and you know distract you out here he like that's why he likes to get your mind going a million different ways while you're sitting right here trying to solve problems what's he trying to do he's trying to distract you from your deliverance the word holds your deliverance and strength as you walk through the weak amen hallelujah watch this this is did now watch this direction he said just keep believing press right on go forward and speak what am I going to speak by his straps I'm Healed see the power of it's broken when the power of Egypt's hold was broken they could go forward but they had to keep going forward there were obstacles in their way but the power of Egypt had already been broken the blood of the Lamb had loosed them when it came upon the door it released them from the power of Egypt's ho and they kept walking till eventually they walked right through the Red Sea and all that was after himen became consumed when it tried to pursue him you say what are you saying I'm saying get so deep in God to where the devil can't even find you I'm telling you say brother Samuel where I'm at right now forget listen forget about where you've been you're looking at where you're at and the spirit of God God is wanting to take you High say God I'm going to rise in the wings of Grace right now I feel the Winds of the Holy Ghost blowing right now I'm going to move on this current and I'm going to rise there what am I going to do I'm going to go deeper in Jesus Christ it's like you're in a house like you're in a house you know how it is you're close to the door you'll hear this right right but you get off in another room you get off in a room that might be more inward I don't care who's out there right you're not going to be hearing it right that's the way it is when you get in Christ and keep going deeper the deeper you go the fainter the fainter the quieter that the devil's Roar and his hot breath and what he wants to say about you get a get further in Christ stop going over to the door don't even look through the people did you hear me don't even look through the people you don't have to answer him his his question has already been answered Hallelujah you ought to say right now boo [Applause] devil stand right up to it you just go on and be well everything will be all right looks all right around you right now where it's dark when you was here on the platform so when she came up brother Joy it was dark but what's happened broke through the clouds broke back brother Aaron she sees the lifeline it broke back she sees that Lifeline how to get back what I do it's broke now when this meeting's over if the clouds try to come back but just take hold of that rope keep keep moving your hands up like the prophet was looking from that rope say God I know you've showed me the lifeline out of here he showed you the lifeline out of here keep walking in the direction where he has showed you [Applause] oh Lord I wish I had I wish I had more strength he said notice you're all right the blessing's on you now if you'll just keep on going let me give you another let me give you another one cuz I know sometimes we come in situation we hear things on the news and then sometimes you experience things in life where fear can come based on those experiences right we have what do we call the acronym PTSD right I mean you got going happen you know like we driving a car you get in a car accident right all of a sudden man coming up to coming up to intersections all and you know it's not saying that we shouldn't be cautious but sometimes sometimes fear can come around a child of God and it become so debilitated maybe if they've gotten in an accident maybe when it's early morning maybe it's night it just it becomes like something that moves around them that at that at night it's just one of those things that just seems like man it just seems to maybe maybe get upon them listen the prophet when that gun went off in his face you remember that when that gun they tried to bore it out to be a weather be Magnum I believe it was and when it went off remember what brother Bram said he did he said I got right in the gun range the next day cuz I didn't want something to set in in my life that is so good I wonder I wonder you see because I I don't believe that brother BR went out to that gun range just walking on the clouds but he went out to that gun range because wisdom was if I set on this that's right fear is going to build right so you know what he did Brother Joy he went put it right went that gun and started shooting I wonder if there weren thoughts going through his mind I know there was he don't have to tell us but when he says that I did it so nothing sets in it shows that if he would have let it it could have set in we're going to preach now this is the time that even through your failures don't sit around and stoop amen amen and where you start carrying your bottom lip around like this come on friends I'm not picking on you I'm trying to remind you who you are your flesh is always going to disappoint you but you've got to look beyond your flesh You' got to think beyond that you got to get right back in the gun range put another bullet in there and fire again cuz if not you'll sit around and doubt will build fear will build and eventually a complex has you wrapped up it'd be easier to get out of a hold of an octopus than that complex maybe we should open the door and just let him out of here no stay around I want to whoop you a little bit [Applause] more watch this I love this 1964 brother is talking to a brother he holds his brother on the platform I'm not going to read that whole thing to you but he holds his brother on the platform goes through the four anointings goes through where we're at in the eagle age and then he's asked the brother you know where we're at you know with the stone coming into the image and he says brother do you believe that that the word in stone the coming one the brother said I do he said you have a very fine feeling sir now what your trouble you've had an accident and in that accident you were gassed with carbon monoxide side gas that is true it poisoned you it poisoned you in your liver and you had trouble with that you had trouble with your stomach the brother said that's right you had trouble with your heart that's right and it's made you a nervous until you built yourself in a complex notice in a complex you see a complex isn't something in here a complex is something that gets wrapped get something that gets built in other words it becomes like the man of the gated community I'm not letting you in unless you can come through this complex that's right that's exactly right they see the very thing with that the reason the whole goal with that is Satan is trying to hinder that's right this man's relationship with God now you might look and say what does him going to work have to do with his relationship with God because if Satan can affect him in one area of his life it'll actually start to spiral depression despondency anxiousness it'll work through every aspect of his life let me just say this to you you might not think that your natural life means too much to God but I want to tell you God's put certain skills and gifts and things within you God's put it within you that you and I are built in order to work labor see achievement and when that doesn't happen it will affect you even in your spiritual walk you know why because you feel useless you feel worthless you feel like I don't have nothing accomplished and that is one of Satan's poys to try to get at you to hinder you because if you can get you in one area that you're doubting or you're feeling down then he Smooths that over and it affects you being yielded at all times to God right everybody with me now that is so good Oh my he says now watch you're poor you must go back to work but you're afraid to go back to work you're afraid of that carbon monoxide gas but it's going to be all right if Jesus will tell me who you are them things was true weren't they if he'll tell me who you are will you accept it and know and go on back and be of a good cheer will you do it I'm asking you will you do it your name is Mr Wagner go on back on your road now let me tell you something if God wanted to he could call your name right here this morning but this word is the one thing that's calling your name it's Discerning your life and you're realizing this is me God is speaking to my life you know what that is that is the spirit of God the same Angel of the Lord that accompanies the message that is Discerning the thoughts and hearts of his people and he's calling your name he's the same yesterday today and forever hallah the mighty Angel is here [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I want you to think of this one I didn't put this one up there but just listen this for a minute this one always struck me brother Bram calls out there's a sister standing on the platform and brother Bram said well he said you you've got a nervous condition a nervous trouble he said but really you're not you're you're really not here for yourself' uh there's other troubles you got and the main thing is there's a young boy about 18 or 19 years old and he's got a nervous trouble I see you go to a doctor and it's a shock treatment on that boy he's a it's a nervous disturbance he's self-conscious he don't like to get around where people's at he is a Christian are you hearing me now the spirit of God is Discerning it he is a Christian but the devil has bound him and he's afraid to come to church but you see what it is beneath all of that he's a Christian and you're here standing in on his behalf you go and be well and the spirit of God will see to it that his life is healed Hallelujah God revealing that truth a young man who was a true Christian he needed help he needed somebody to stand in on his behalf he was afraid to come to church but God rich in Mercy went to where he was at oh the devil would like to run run you away there's times through all your mistakes and your failures he'd like to tell you you're not even worthy to sit on these pews you look at your failures look where you've been and you know what he's trying to do he's trying to build an anxiousness in your life to where all of a sudden the peace that was there and he just starts dropping those thoughts you start entertaining those thoughts you're not worthy to be associated with these people look at your life look at where you're at but you know what you need to do you need to look to what the word has said about your life the word the blood the blood speaketh better things I'm telling you friends receive it this morning the blood speaks better things let me just tell you something God will never run you away as a matter of fact he'll send his servants according to the word he says compel them to come to my Feast compel them to come and receive of my life Christian confession confession let me read these few scriptures maybe you can read this one with me let's read this together in Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ streng Revelations 12:11 and they overcame him and and and they love not their lives unto death Christian confession how many believe that the words that you and I speak are are important they're important very important set an atmosphere around our lives things we think on will set an atmosphere around our lives right that's why the devil likes to play Postman right okay that's why he likes to drop a little something in your life maybe just a little just a little letter just a little something he likes to try to see if you're going to keep that thing in circulation or whether you're just going to say RTS return to Satan wrong address buddy Hallelujah wrong address I don't take junk [Applause] mail that's right thank you Lord that's called spam that's called trash that's called Junk my life is not a garbage Camp all right brother BR this is very important now Eagle stirreth up his nest I'm coming I'm coming down here but just just really really focus with me here a minute an eagle stirreth up her nest and brother brandom is talking about you know he says you got one that's healed and then there's one that sits here it it lingers on a little bit there's another one another one something's wrong somewhere he said sometimes he said I think it this is what it is it's a complex that people build up now just listen he said now you'll resent this when I tell you but it's true you take a child that's been petted that child becomes to a place till it just wants to be petted it builds up a complex and you can't do nothing with that child until you shake them right good he said that's how it is when a person gets sick they become self-pay it here in just a minute that's good that's when a person gets sick they become self ped oh I'm in such a condition I've been prayed for people will say well I don't believe I feel any better you'll never feel any better like that that's not it if that's the attitude don't even approach him at all cuz it's not right in his sight don't have a complex but come with a Burly robust faith that it's a settled thing God said so and this settles it right now now let me just ask you this anybody got a button with this button all of a sudden you're like there it goes robust Faith right if you do can you buy one on Amazon for me and prime it to my house cuz I'd like to have that button too brother Samuel don't you have faith yeah but I'm preaching reality right now because Faith itself is not something you work up that's right come on now that's right faith is sovereignly revealed it is God's will reveal to you are you with me remember when we started this series back in September it's being in the right place having our lives as a channel that's open to God that that can drop at any time right so good but here that that part of Faith well where does faith come from comes from the word of God right sometimes let's just get down home with this sometimes you you you it maybe in your feeling and how you feel and you think oh man man I here's a few days that's went by and man I don't feel like I've really been you know in prayer and and talked to the Lord and and and but let me just tell you something don't make prayer some tradition where you got to go put on some kind of robe with tassels hanging down and don't make a tradition you can talk to him at every time let me just tell you something even in the times where it just seemed like that man it don't seem like it seem like everything is pulled out of you but there still at that time if you'll just raise your hands and say Lord you're worthy amen you may not be doing nothing but just worshiping him but let me tell you something he will draw nigh my God is not an idol he's not a tradition he's not an imagination he is a living reality he is a being Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah yes it's good in it [Music] yeah that is so good sometimes it's just where you put on a message and you just put it on and you know what you're not even worrying about trying to get everything set the right way you just put it on and maybe you put it on and say you know what I've got to go and I got to put a load in the laundry yep right and you put it there on the dryer and you go ahead and have it going you know what's happening there's an atmosphere that's being created amen whether you whether you realize it or not but when you begin to move within that aspect of it right there because you may not even have the strength at that moment to open the Bible you've got other things going on but you're realizing the atmosphere needs to be changed and as an amateur God as a son and daughter of God I have the authority to change the atmosphere how do you change the atmosphere you change it by the word of God and you'll put it on and all of a sudden you'll find an atmosphere being changed I guarantee you one thing you'll think it's by chance you're picking out a message but you watch God will drop something right out of that message you know why because he knows where you're at Elijah he still has angels that are dispatched that will drop what you have need right by the Brook ter oh my could we just give him a praise offering hallelujah thank you Lord Hallelujah he knows where I'm at He Knows My Name he knows my Uprising he knows my Downs sitting marvelous are thy thoughts concerning me oh God [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord said it's not you know he talked about a sister always comes up he said it would stand there and she said she just soon brother brand pray for her name was Sister Rooks he said she's standing right there she was dying with cancer few doctors and everything else he said and she stood right there and said brother Brandon prayed for me she said I went he said I went up and prayed for her and she and said it's all settled it's all over they prayed for me that's what she told the doctors brother BR said now you see he said I I I you know if you say well I I don't believe I feel any better oh mercy don't come like that it's finished when God's word is obeyed it's finished just set your hold like that eagle and let the wind Shake but just hold right there it's finished amen a complex is what he's talking about in this very next part of this quote self-pity you're in a pitiful condition then when you get to pitying yourself I won to ask you to raise your hands but I'll raise mine I've been there right somehow I wish that'd be a street that'd be replaced in the neighborhood right but it's an Avenue we can get into every one of us can that's right are you with me some of you already reading ahead of me right there cuz you a little bit you were afraid to answer and then you read a little bit ahead of me there when you get to pitying yourself you want everybody to pity you and you pity yourself I hit that spot one time oh I love the transparency of God's prophet I hit that spot one time sitting right there on the porch with a breakdown staying 8 days in meetings without coming out for food sleep or anything I stayed right in the platform praying for the sick I got to a place notice I got to a place and I said well I just can't feel any better he got to that place I just can't feel any better but one day he said I heard a scream right and I heard it in a little book called Christian confession if you've never read that that on healing thoughts by FF Bosworth powerful book if you if you read it you'll realize brother BR when he's when he's ministering a lot of that those principles he's bringing it right into right through right all the way through because it's scriptural he said I heard an eagle scream through a little book called Christian confession by FF Bosworth that Christians they confess not what they see but what they believe don't make any difference what you're looking at we don't see by sight we see by our faith no self-pity just speak the word I'm the Lord who heals all thy diseases I don't care what your conditions are if you'll lay a hold on the wings of God's Eternal promise this morning and say it is mine it belongs to me something in me called me here to this Tabernacle to be be prayed for I'm taking a hold of the word and no matter what shape I'm staying right with it you'll get well that's so good Paul said we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it's written I believed and therefore spoken we also believe and therefore speak you are his I'm finished here you're his we have the right to all that he has purchased for us every promise in the Bible is yours it belongs to you when this token is upon you and God has sealed you let me pause here for a minute or brother Samuel I don't believe that I have the token yet then let me just tell you how the prophet goes on to tell us in the message the token he said come being thankful because that that's how you receive the token be thankful because it is a promise that is for you be thankful that's right oh I'm not worthy well none of us are worthy who is worthy who can make you worthy can you make yourself worthy you cannot but he has made you worthy it's him that's calling you to his side be thankful amen when you're approaching the word that's very scriptural be thankful be careful for nothing be anxious for nothing Philippians 4 amen you love him everything that Jesus purchased and promised you in the Bible is yours that's right it's your personal it's your property because it's paid for life is mine he paid for it life is yours he paid for it healing is mine he paid for it healing is yours he paid for it freedom is mine he paid for it Heaven Is Mine he paid for it he has paid the price everything he purchased belongs to the man that holds the [Applause] [Music] token you believe that this morning Lord and the same holy spirit is here to not only give the token but he's here to make good on every Divine promise so good let's bow our heads Heavenly Father dear God you see Lord how the enemy has wanted to hinder this even today Lord you permitted it and he wanted to afflict my wife Dear God but how you rich in Mercy have sweeped down lord God and father I believe for every one of our needs that's right here this morning oh I believe that Lord I believe right here this morning that there is not one person not one person has to walk out of here the same way they came in I believe Lord that there has been realities deliverances healing I believe the Holy Ghost has went forth right while the word's being preached and Lord even as we would stand here and agree together maybe there is one that would say I I I need I need help I need strength I need Faith United with my faith and Lord God as we would go to pray and lay hands on one another according to your word you said if they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover so Lord we're not coming to approach your word based on a formality we are coming in Divine obedience from our heart we believe Lord that the quickening power is in the body the same quickening power that raised our lord Jesus from the grave the same quickening power that has moved Upon Our Life to Quicken us and bring us Lord into this place and so completely Quicken our lives and change our very nature we believe that quickening power Lord moving in the body is present Lord right here to break every complex amen any City that's standing in the front of not a man out of a civil war but out of one in the front of one of your children your Prophet was asked the question as he brought it in greatest battle ever fought how do we how do we do this how do we go about this he said you do it just like Grant did in the war you take it as you come to it Grant took Richmond when he got to it you
