just want to turn our attention to the word just such a wonderful atmosphere amen his his presence draws near where he's invited you know the bible says he he dwells in the praise of his people and we have certainly a lot to to thank him for we're not coming here to the house of god empty you know there were certain feasts and certain offerings that they would bring into the temple and the people would actually eat that offering there even with the priest there are things that god has done in our life that when we come together just even another day that god has given you grace to stand in this hour strength of things that you can look back in your life and know that you're not the same you know that your life has been changed and there you say you have a rest in your heart of overcoming power how god has provided for your life day after day at times that you wondered how that you would make the next step and god came down and ministered to your life so we're not here tonight empty we're here tonight to feast with the king he said behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and will open he said then i will come in and i will sup with him amen we're having communion with the king amen there's there's a rejoicing in our life for his grace and what he has brought us from and what he's doing in our life and where we're going i tell you we've got the brightest future there is i know circumstances might seem dismal but we got the brightest future ahead this is only temporary this is only temporary no matter what your situation is you just say tonight it's just temporary it's just temporary amen let's just go to him in prayer tonight heavenly father oh lord jesus how we love you how we just appreciate you tonight lord oh god your atmosphere the presence lord lord has drawn near [Music] lord is your people lord just entering in and just inviting you lord and worshiping you lord i'm sure that gathered throughout this building here tonight there's testimonies lord god of even from this day there's testimonies from this week lord god father much less from days and weeks gone by there's things lord as we're standing here knowing that lord upon hearts dear god as they worship as they come here lord their lord coming with a praise upon their heart coming with a thanksgiving o god lord for how that your matchless grace o god has guided us through and given us strength lord throughout this day throughout this week oh god now lord i just asked that you would come lord once again although god we invite you lord god father to this pulpit lord invite you to the pew lord we just ask that you'll just come lord for this would be just a protractive gathering if you don't come lord but lord may you come may the master himself come lord and take lord the violin take our lives take your word o god and just lord strike upon it oh god with your spirit lord speak to us lord may you come in a personal way lord for every need lord tonight i pray we just love you lord in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen let's look in the scriptures here to first corinthians 13. amen if you don't mind i'm just going to move right down into verse 4 to begin reading paul as we've been been looking at this in the scriptures of how that paul is dealing with the life and the character it's god's own life that of the love of god and that's what real charity is it's it's something that is uh you know it'd be like let me just say it like this maybe you've never had a situation you know i remember i think one time i remember at a birthday that you know there was you know wanting to play a trick on somebody and so you took a nice wrap and wrapped up a nice paper and you wrapped up some old toy and you gave it to him and they opened up that my they're tearing that package off and my the package the outside looks so nice and then here's this old rusty truck back then they used to make trucks metal you know they weren't plastic i'm not talking about the ones we're driving but you know the ones you play with and you open it up and what's this you see everything looked kind of exciting with the package that was that was the wrapping on the outside but what you're after is what's on the inside and that's what real charity is it's what's beneath the wrapping sometimes the wrapping may not look like much but what's beneath that wrapping and what's in that life so that's what we want to look at in verse 4 of first corinthians 13 says charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not it vaunteth not itself it is not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly that means act unbecomingly or rudely it seeketh not her own in other words it's it's not all about me it's not easily provoked or reviled or angered and it thinketh no evil keeps no records of all the wrong that's ever been done amen may god bless the reading of his word as you're being seated i want to look a little bit more at this tonight on doth not behave itself unseemly and you know when we we look at this i believe as with all the word of god when we look at it we're very to be very honest and look into the mirror of god's word and see a real reflection in our life and really take inventory in our own lives that we want to see we want to see more of god we want to see more of his life flowing through our lives and we realize that it's it's just kind of like you know you look at your house there's a lot of things you can add to your house but if you don't move some things out then it no longer is complementary it becomes cluttered so you've got to take some things out and donate it or whatever you're going to do or move it here move it there or put it down in the basement and wait for 10 years from now but anyway you've got to move some things out in order to have more things come in and that's how it is with god in our life there's things that we begin to see by the word of god things how the holy spirit will deal with our life because there's a desire in our heart to see more of him we we know that this this life that you and i in or that we are walking in it's just a fleeting space of time as james would describe it it's more than ju it's just like vapor it's just it goes by ever so quickly we're here just just for a season of time that our lives would be molded and shaped and prepared for that that time that is coming and that we're headed for so when we we look at this here tonight and think about this i want to just look at it in terms of that how the charity itself it doesn't it doesn't behave itself unseemly or unbecomingly or an unbeseem unseemly behavior or rudeness but there is actually instead it is that of an honor and you know with when we look at it in our life our character itself is molded by the life in us i never forget you know when we were my wife and i were expecting uh paul and you know i already had you know in my heart you know we we had had you know i wanted to name him after my dad and and you know i also wanted to put the middle name of who my dad reminded me of of his stand and things that he had to stand against and things from early years and so that's why his name is james paul and so when we looked at this i remember it happened to be in that year in school now some of you know that work in schools there's sometimes where you run into names that you think oh my that that was a good name i had picked out but they ruined that name for me but i had an individual in class that year whose names happened to be james that guy could steal you blind i mean he was good he could lie straight to your face and make you think he was telling the honest to goodness truth we knew this about this young man now in the midst of that i had a choice of do i continue to you know name him james but you see i wasn't naming him james based on that character that had held that name because when you really get to looking at in the scripture we cringe at the name jezebel is that right even god would pick up that name even as the name balaam and he would use the characteristic of what it represented clear there in the book of revelations but when you look at the actual name jezebel it don't have really a bad meaning but it's the character of life that was displayed that then looks at that name jezebel are you with me so sometimes when we're looking at this we we understand the character itself and that's who you really are our character is molded by the life that's in us that's that's who we really are you take that life and has its place within us there and brother brown would say it like this he speaks he says we've got to take the full gospel and we we have to identify ourselves as full gospel people let's mold our character we're invited to be molded in his image that we might reflect his presence the works that i do shall you do also the life that i live so shall you we're invited by god to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his oh what a thing it is he says then when we let his character be in us then we have become sons by having the mind of christ the mind which is his character your mind makes your character let this mind that was in christ be in you so he says it molds the character of a son of god so our life that of our first birth there was a molding of chara our character in this life but once once that life has come in the character of his life the life that was here inside of this vessel that was here that you or me or anybody else could know you as you were and maybe you weren't bad as what people would call but there's something that's taken place with you that in your life that you're you're not just a church member you're not just somebody who says i believe the message or or you're no longer bound there you know with all with different things and attributes of unbelief but god has come down in your life and your life is set on fire by god it's so there's a different testimony coming out of your life regardless of what you say your life is testifying because there's a new there's a different character of life that's moved on the inside of you it's not you trying to live this life but now it is god's own life that has come to unite with that part of himself that was sown in our life that came straight from the mind of god it was planted here within our body as we dropped from our mother's womb and now that life is on display and it's a molding and a reflection to where others look at you they look at me and say there's a christian there's a believer there's a life that that beats for god so all of that changed because a character of life has moved into our life and i just say it in this manner we're in a journey as we're walking here in this life we've bypassed our theophany we did not come from the attribute to the theophany then down to flesh jesus came that way is that right when he would ask he says glorify me with the glory that i had with thee before the foundation of the world that that theophany is that word body it's a body that's not made with hands it's a spiritual body but yet it's visible there in that realm it is that same realm on the other side where the prophet when he witnessed and he saw there he saw him walking around there in word bodies you and i bypass that to come down in here straight from the attribute and become flesh and you see this is here that where we're living this is the proving grounds you know there's a shipyard i believe it's out in new jersey or off the coast or whatever more they call it the proving grounds they take those naval vessels and everything else and they prove them before they ever commission them for war there's a proving that goes on the the bible says that every son that cometh to god must be tried and chastened and proven and that testing never stops in our life is that right as a matter of fact we are partakers of that right now in our life if we're not partakers of the chasing of the lord then the scripture said we're not sons we're bastards is that right for only sons are actually partakers to receive the correction of almighty god so this is proving grounds this is where the testing and the trials and testing there you know the temptations and everything come around this is where our character is molded and shaped in this time as much that as you and i we we i'll just say it like this for all of us because i believe all of us do we all want the easy stretch we all want the part about it's the flesh part of us we we don't want anything hindered or interrupted we try to look out sometimes for problems and everything else and we try to get away from this or get away from that but yet god remember in this time that we're here he's not the author of confusion he's not the uh he's not a frustration he's the author of peace he knows exactly what he's doing he permits things to come our way that you and i would think why where did this come from such as when david walked out of the city and a man spit on him now remember the messenger that was standing by david said shall i let that dog's head stay on it but david himself oh i wish i could preach on this david himself being a man under authority by god and knowing how god had dealt with his life all along david said don't you touch him god told him to do that are you with me he was able to discern that that this god told him to do that you see it's things sometimes that you and i we don't we don't understand and we we look at it and we see things taking place such as when the scripture says in love does not behave itself rudely or unseemingly or unbecomingly it shows that there are times that come our way will come our way that we might feel to act rudely or unbecomingly to that of a christian but you see this is where by the love of god within our lives there has to be a maturing in our lives you see god does not allow a test or a trial to come our way and give us something to show that we're a failure that's not what it is at all but a tester trial just like the tester trials that you're facing right now in your life and in your walk those tester trials could not have come years ago a month ago even a week ago it's for this moment because there's been a maturing of the very life inside of you that now it will take that test or that trial to further shape and mold our lives this is why as brother branham would pick this up over and over through through the church ages and he would deal with this of the molding the shaping the test of trials that would come our way and he would simply say it in this way character a character itself is a victory not a gift the holy ghost is the gift of god is that right you can't earn it you can't merit it it's the gift of almighty god but character itself is not a gift it's a victory so in order for there to be a victory there's got to be battles and there are battles to prove that there is a greater than he that is in you than he that's in the world to show that you are indeed an overcomer because you are operating by overcoming life through that very seed of god that's placed on the inside of your life i understand sometimes you feel like you're going to crumble sometimes it seems like things are coming from this way this way this way and you feel like i feel like i'm all surrounded around here you feel like this is coming and and this is coming but in the midst of it it's in that time that god himself he declares there's something greater than your humanity your resolve there is a greater one inside of the temple [Applause] hallelujah and god will use tests and trials to show you yes in our humanity there's a breaking point but you can't break that connection between the believer and his god hallelujah glory be to god in the highest character he said simply is never made without suffering a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule let me just bring this down to um you know to maybe to to just to speak of this in this manner you've seen people that all of a sudden here now they are the ceos in the factory and they never wore boots and walked on the ground come on now i i watched people when i taught school they taught for maybe two years and then here they are in administration they have no business being in there i'm just going to speak plainly they've not walked long enough down here to understand everything that goes on are you with me you see god himself he did not come down to just this level or this level brother he came down to where the foxes themselves had dens but he himself had not a place to lay his head he came down in such a way the king of glory and how the prophet would put it and the scriptures would reiterate it it was a humiliation he donned the very robes of humanity to experience testing and temptation the bible says he learned obedience through the things which he suffered he learned the cost of what it meant to obey even when it came down and it was hard and flesh was being pulled upon one way hey listen you and i have never faced something in that grave when he said when he was there in the garden of gethsemane every demon out of torment was there it was like the stands where samson was at when all of them were mocking and scoffing and every demon out of torment was right there in the garden of gethsemane and the conference was held will you go through it and he said nevertheless not my will thine will be done he prayed that way three times aren't you grateful that god himself he paid away for you and i he made a way that you and i as he stood victorious in that arena in that time of test that he might release his life back to you and i that in the midst of this hour in the midst of your trial in the midst of your test that that same life might display itself as the victorious one glory be to god character is a victory it's not a gift a preacher can't hand it to us no it is it is a victory you see we recognize that within this journey that you and i are in how the spirit of god has come in it it quickens that seed on the inside the spirit of god comes with a purpose to quicken the seed of god the spirit of god did not just come upon us to anoint us it came to anoint the word that was already there in our life you see there's a there was a place that god reserved for himself hallelujah god already had prepared a place he made a way that that in this hour that when you and i would have a need that there would be a place that he himself could come and dwell oh a body has thou prepared for me god knew he would have a people in the midst of this generation when it's all sorts of things that are taking place but he already knew there'll be a group of people on earth it's predestinated it's one of the last horns that's on the lamb one of the seven horns is standing here that the lamb is protecting his rights by his life inside of his people that's redeemed by his spirit his power is preserved his glory is preserved brother we're not looking back to something in the past it's a living god right now the lamb is right here among us the living god is operating right here in our midst glory be to god in the eyes so here in this time this is the time in the hour that we are formed to the image of the word we're being matured when we're first born we're a spirit babe in christ and we grow we must grow you see this is why it's important to grow it's something that you know that even as you recognize of the importance it's just like being and recognizing the importance of being in the house of god it's recognizing that even beyond our feelings sometimes of well you know i'll just catch it by streaming or whatever more now if i'm stepping on your toes may i jump on them a little bit this is this should not be an option of though well it's just the same it's not the same streaming is not the same streaming should not be an option unless you are sick unless you're homebound it should not be organizing the weekly activities around well you know what this is kind of pressing so i'll just catch thursday night by a stream let me just give you an information the rapture is not gonna be live streamed it'll be a secret setting going away you won't get a pop-up to let you know hey they're streaming right now so you better get into the live service right now and to recognize it's here under the presence of god as god is dealing with our life and he's been maturing us he's molding us by his presence this is why the prophet could say he said you cannot be good just as good a christian staying home as you can be in the house of god if you look around the house of god or let's look in your living room it's you and somebody else or maybe just you but when you're in the house of god the prophet tells us when believers are coming together that it is more of a pillar of fire that is coming together it is scriptural that the bible said forsake not to assemble yourselves together even the more so [Applause] i'll tell you friends when when people don't do it it's because there's a spiritual deficient somewhere i'm going to preach straight because it's spiritually deficient the world is getting in the way oh my well that's free hallelujah now i want you to think of this when we look at it you see in our lives right now to be a form to the word image to be a partaker of that word to feed on the word these are key important points that brother bran brings out in the message we are formed into the word image we're a partaker of that word we are a partaker of the life of almighty god and we feed on that word we take in the nutrients of that word it's molding us and shaping us listen it's not this scriptures that we read even for a text it isn't you and i walking around and saying well i got to be a good boy or i got to be a good girl remember the bride is not standing on good behavior the bride does not stand on that the bride is standing on thus saith the lord she has come under the blood by the token life of the lord jesus christ it is not she is standing on good behavior it is the life of god inside of us that is bringing forth the behavior of what a real son and daughter of god is as a matter of fact it's the character of life that lay within us that drew us to him in this hour glory be to god so when this life is fully developed it's like a picture when it's fully developed in our lives when it's fully developed here that wheat germ that's placed inside of the crocodile fully developed then we go there the full development is stepping in to that other dimension the full development is that of the rapture you see there's a developing that's going on in our life hallelujah don't don't look at yourself look to him he's the one that is developing our life you see this is why that after it's all said and done this is where the scripture says in 2nd corinthians 5 and i don't want to spend too much time here that for if the earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens i want to just you know to think about this in a minute you know to look at it you know uh how many of you ever you ever uh you knew brother ernie villanueva okay brother ernie was always with brother biscuit and right up there that's where he was there was that brother bernie he went on home to be with the lord just last week there's a statement that he that he that he made i want to read this statement here to me i thought it was absolutely profound i had caught it you know it at one point he said many people think i'm just a human being that has come down to earth to have a spiritual experience no that's not right you're a supernatural being you've come to earth to have a human experience and your mission and your mandate is to overcome the human experience to overcome your eyes ears taste touch and smell conscience memory reason affection and imagination and have the holy ghost enthroned inside of your life i thought that is powerful man we're not a human come down to have a spiritual experience we're a supernatural being let's come down to have a human experience and overcome that human experience by the grace of almighty god my goodness i tell you hallelujah to think of this we we have a place and we're going and to think how paul would write of it like this in romans 8 for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god there's already been a liberty a jubilee that sounded inside of your life amen you've now been connected back with that part of the inheritance the earnest of the spirit of god has come and quickened you and raised you up from the life that you used to live and the way that you used to go and god has come down and he's raised up that life dividing of himself it shows that waiting there on the other side the way that that life how it's had the effect upon your life now you turn from the things of the world and this word has become your all in all jesus christ is your all in all it shows brother you once were disconnected but now you're connected back in heavenly places you've been tied back in to your representation that is standing there before the throne of almighty god blessed be the name of the lord and this creature this new creation this life it shall be delivered from the bondage of this corruption hallelujah in this body there's limitations there's limitations sometimes how long that we can go or endure and even a service is that right there's limitations it's a bondage of corruption we experience sickness is that right we experience weakness in the body of corruption we experience down times it's it's all the bible says hey if the high priest himself was encompassed about with infirmity how much more you and i the reason that he came down and had that experience for you and i that he might be the faithful and merciful high priesthood things pertaining unto god now i want you to think of this of a life of authority living a life of authority because now from the inside it's it's how god has come in that life what is manifested there as a son or daughter of god that has dominion i look at this in this way when brother branham not only would he stand there yielded to god on the platform and the angel of the lord would come down and demon after demon was defeated as the people's faith would raise to recognize there is more than a man who is present the one thing that this message it brought a reality it doesn't leave god at church [Music] when it came time in the home his wife was all the pieces and everything else she was a nervous wreck here he stood with that same kind of authority as the son of god he took dominion over the situation [Applause] glory be to god blessed be the name of the lord oh my i don't want to go there but to think of it this is a life of authority that you and i are called to live a life of authority so not acting unbecomingly but rather in honor to reflect the spirit of that land that we have been born from now here in the in the bible in matthew chapter 8 just set this for a background here here comes a man the centurion in matthew 8 8 the centurion answered and said lord i'm not worthy that thou should has come under my roof now brother ram takes this and even in the message respects he said no doubt this man being a centurion had a wonderful house he said no doubt a big house but look at his response to the lord jesus he says i'm not worthy that thou should has come under my roof here he has he don't just have a house but brother it no doubt is an astounding house but he's talking to one that doesn't even have a place on this earth to call home but you see that he is not honoring that he's honoring the god that is there vindicating his presence he recognizes god his presence in christ and that's where his reverence and respect is now watch how he says this here for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh until my servant do this and he doeth it when jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel so one thing that we begin to see here is that faith itself is based on one knowing the authority that they're given and that authority itself it comes by knowing their position and how that where we are placed under the word so this is where you and i have authority outside of the word we don't have authority is that right but it's inside of the word that we have authority when jesus could stand there he was the word he was not speaking to the devil something separate from what he was he was speaking to what he was what was quickened to him he stood upon that word in the face of temptation he knew what it was to be under authority is that right to think of how that when you see this that faith itself it will operate there with one who knows authority and is under authority lord be to god now i want you to think of this brother graham talks about this this this theory and many places in the message but brother brown talks about it here when he preaches a message jesus on the authority of the word the roman nobleman and on and on in this place of the authority of the word blue brown says hear this man he kept himself in the background he said you know he said i've seen wheat when you drive by the road and you look out there and you see the wheat and it's standing up just like this he said its head is sticking right up he said what it is he said that wheat itself it's got an inferiority complex so it's got to stick its head up like this and it shows there's nothing inside of that head yet but he said when the head itself bows that it shows it's got something in it because when the heart itself is filled with the love of god it bows in the presence of god because it recognizes i'm nothing without him you see when the life has compression from the stalk and it moves through the tassel and it moves into that part of the shock to where now it's time for the life itself to declare itself then the life brings forth a life of humility he said lord i'm a man under authority now brother brown would say it like this he said you know he said in his own line of work he saw who jesus was now think of this he of everything that he did in life think of this all these things all the training that he went through to get to where he was he he there had to be a quality about his life that all the way through he was a man who was under authority and that under that kept on moving him into a place to where he was entrusted with a century of troops it was in that line of work i hope you're hearing me in his own line of work he saw who jesus was because he could look in his own line of work he could recognize even who jesus was that i'm a man under authority they tell me tell your century to do this and i give the orders that's come down he recognized god was present in christ and that all that needed to be spoken was the word and as the word would go forth he recognized that god was present on earth to heal sickness to bring deliverance to set the captive free he recognized the presence of god that was there upon earth how did he recognize it by being a man who's under authority glory be to god now let's look at this just for a moment here on on order and authority you see we've been made kings and priests unto our god revelations 1 revelations 5 is that right there's a two-pole there's a two-fold part in our life you even see that when you read the song of solomon it speaks of how that uh you know the bride is and my how beautiful she is and then right within that same verse of scripture it'll flip and say terrible as an army with banners so there's a part within our life as kings that we reign in this life over sin over the flesh over the devil and over the world is that right we reign as kings under the king of kings and then there's a part in our life that is that of priesthood or priests now when we look at this with that of of a priest look how peter would give this example to you and i in our walk as priest unto god in verse nine you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light you've not just been brought into the inner court and all of a sudden your experience can be blown out no this is not a man-made experience you've been brought beyond just the holy place you've been brought back into the holiest of holies it's coming to a place to where it's no longer your light but david said he is my light the lord is the light of my life so it is that shekinah light it's his abiding presence that no matter how dark he gets no matter how windy it gets you know the stars themselves could be covered in the outer court and the light wouldn't shine is that right weapons out here there could be times in the spirit realm that the candle gets blown out is that right heavy maintenance area but inside of the inside when it's been lit with the life of almighty god there's not enough devils in hell that could ever blow that out it's not a man-made life it's god's own life that's burning in the heart of that individual [Applause] hallelujah is the same original fire that came down and consumed the sacrifice it's the same original fire that fell on the day of pentecost that same original fire the seven licks of it that have come in every generation it's the same original holy ghost amen so we have been called out of darkness and remember what paul said we weren't just in darkness we were we were sometimes darkness we've been called into his marvelous life which in times past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy now watch how peter expresses this priesthood of our lives dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul having your conversation at your conduct honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation so the good works is the life that's lived according to the word right it's not us doing good works as far as i'm going to do this and i'm going to do this good works is the word being expressed we have been ordained unto good works amen so now notice this here in verse 13 submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them to do well now i want to remember this is the same man the holy ghost speaking through peter it's the same holy spirit that when they commanded them to stop preaching in his name the same holy ghost deserved that situation and said we are not going to stop preaching in his name they weren't being disrespectful but they recognize you cross the line as soon as you come against the word because they were not commissioned by the world they were commissioned by god this is exactly where our lives come as believers that how that in the midst of our life think of the lord jesus even when he was here he walked according to the ordinances and things that were there he never told the people in that day you know what you're following me uh you don't need to worry about paying taxes but he said give unto caesar what is caesar's but the verse says give unto god what is god's is that right being able to live that that life that recognize and be able to discern those things that when certain things cross the boundary let me bring this down personal there's things that you can look at in your life that sometimes doesn't seem very obvious and there's got to be a discernment of the spirit of god because you don't have black and white in front of you sometimes you have to discern things and you bring it in this way is this going to draw me and my family closer to god or is it going to get between me and my family and you've got to discern things in that way not about how much better it'll make your life how easier it'll be you've got to have discernment of the holy spirit because satan is like a roaring lion he's seeking whom he may devour brother he'll do nothing to throw anybody off the track you've got to have discernment by the spirit of god in this hour and discernment you don't get it off of a shelf but this is where that feasting on the word of god you've got to have more than milk it takes the meat of the word his presence that's delivered to sons and daughters of god to be able to stand in the face of satan and say i see what you're trying to do but i will not take a shoe latch it from you i will not receive nothing of sodom [Applause] i'm not here about me i'm here on the business of the king for so is the will of god that with well-doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness like i don't have to because i'm a christian see this was what was a custom among the jews now come on friends don't get don't get a stick in the mud on me now this is what this is what peter is bringing out right here don't don't act in a way that well i'm free from all of that you know this is thing some of you that's older you've seen this there's people that's come right around this and it's sad to say they've come right around this message and what it was they were rebellious and hippies out there they came in here they never got a new birth they're still rebellious come on now they never change they cannot wear flip-flops in the natural but they wear tie-dye shirts in the spiritual and spiritual flip-flops subject to nothing at all they do what they want to do they do it when they want to do it now they you see what it is it's coming in they never receive a change of nature they look at the messages though it's something aligning with they always despised authority the message is not a despising of authority the message itself it came to tear down the very kingdom of satan and a hold upon the lies of god's people it came to break the sin and the hold upon that life that that life may walk free it never came to make arrogant people it never came to water your complexes [Applause] that ain't what the message came for the message did not come to make people more and to make them arrogant that is not a work of the holy ghost the message did not come to make them despise government come on that's a working in peter ii peter also in jude speaks that these brute beasts they despise dominion you know what a dominion is authority i'll tell you there's there's a holy ghost that can deal with an inferiority complex there's a holy ghost that can set a life free come on friends oh brother sam you don't know what happened to me in my past but are you going to hold on to that pastor are you going to let the spirit of god take you back into the mind of god and release that hole from upon your life come on you've been trying to escape things all your life and putting blame on everybody else and god's been trying to mold you and bring you to a place to where you submit to him and say god it ain't everybody else's i'm the guy that needs change my goodness the preacher came in there oh my as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of god honor all men love the brotherhood fear god honor the king let me just refer to these places i'm not going to read them i refer to them god is in control let me just tell you something god is in control to who gets to be the supervisor in your shift god's in control and who gets to be president whether they know they are or not god's in control are you with me man's not in control god's in control god has this under his control satan can't make a move [Applause] [Music] well i'm going to read it now daniel chapter 2 daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god forever and ever for wisdom and might are his he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth kings and set us up kings who does it god does it [Music] i mean thing brother branham could stand right there over and over when he preaches uncertain sound and throughout the message and he would let the people know everything that has taken place he said you can't have certainty in democracy brother branham would stand right there and said we don't even know if president kennedy really is the president but you see what it is it makes no difference whether it was done this way or done that way there had to be a pharaoh raised up who knew not joseph are you with me you see god is in control of these things this is why paul could go on to write in romans 13 let every soul be subject under the higher powers for there's no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation but samuel what are you saying i'm saying to you tonight that when we look at the line order even the authority where the roman centurion himself in his line of work by being under authority and recognize how that that authority would operate he was able to tap in and recognize how god is present and know that that same authority when the word is spoken that everything underneath that word is already conquered and to recognize let me just say this to you if your children or anybody else if they look down at adults and talk back to adults and everything else where does that line get drawn you know what that's called babylon confusion because you want them to disrespect teachers and then want them to respect preachers you can't you can't work it that way you see this is where the scripture said the spirit of this world it despises government and authority it's not the spirit of god that does that come on somebody this is why it behooves us you better be careful what you're sowing in your home i'm going to preach and running down there you better be careful what you're showing in your home if you despise so things in there that looks down upon that of authority and those places like that it doesn't stop there with that situation it continues on and on and on to eventually they'll be tearing down the preacher tearing down the pastor and eventually they'll be tearing down you because you haven't taught them how to hold the proper respect the powers that are the authority they're more coming with this meal [Music] you see rulers paul goes into this i i'm not going to read all of that but he goes into it rulers aren't bad he said they're a terror they're they're not a tear under good works they're set forth the government's magistrates and whatever more to punish the evil doers but samuel what are you saying i'm saying that every policeman i see everywhere i've been if i go in to get a coffee and i see him there i'll walk over to him and i'll let them know i appreciate all you're doing i seen a man that was you know maybe an official or whatever more look it's not all necessarily agreeing with the man but look at this look at even how that the nation has went right now you see what's happened in the spiritual in the spiritual seeds that were shown back there when the prophet could call it out in satan's eden an evening messenger and identify the characteristics that was taking place it was seeds that was being called out in that way the reason the delinquency is the way it is now is because the church got away and they rejected the word of the living god and now they're left to their own devices this is why you have those things all the way and the young people and those that's out there going all their ways what is it there's no purpose in life they're looking for purpose and there's always the enemies out there to try to scoop them up and try to give them a purpose and help them to be a channel you realize in the days of noah the bible says the earth was filled with violence through them they became channels for demonic expression but there was a man on earth by the name of noah who found grace in the eyes of god he became a channel where righteousness could be expressed hallelujah what an important time that we are living in we're living in an hour notice as it goes on in romans 13 7 render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honor to whom honor servants be subject to your masters with all fear that's reverence that's not that's not that that's not the kind of fear he taught my reverence brother brown tells us if you can't respect the man you respect the office that they hold not only to the good and gentle but also to the forward [Music] well i don't know but i'd say lord just give me the good and gentle that's what my flesh called for lord give me the good lord i i'll take this burden give me the good and gentle one lord lord i prefer my brother give him the forward one lord not one of us would want the we don't want the forward one right and yet some of the very things that we're trying to escape from is the very tools that god will use to mold and shape us understand i trust that you have the understanding i'm not talking about somebody standing around and taking abuse or or this or that taking place in the workplace that's not right are you with me i'm saying where there's things that get evaluated that if it's constant and you look at it and you really have a real true evaluation and you've constantly got problems at work you might want to go look in the mirror i'm going to preach because it ain't everybody else when it starts happening like that it's just like somebody says well this pastor this this pastor that this church this this church this i got news for you it ain't all the churches and the pastors it's called look in the mirror because if it's the same things the same baggage is there oh my goodness [Music] come on friends these are things god god's not here to condemn us he's here to help us and set us free it's going home time amen i think we understand that and to have wisdom to look at it correctly for this is thank worthy if a man for conscience toward god endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if when you be buffeted for your faults you take them patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently that is acceptable with god here titus 3 1 can i have just a few more moments thank you i'll read quick like brother john lafontaine say i'll pray i'll preach quick you listen fast but notice how titus would be instructed by paul now we read some scriptures before titus 3 last week where he said these things teach and exhort or a couple weeks ago these things teach and exhort exhort the servants so this was part this was not tracks that were handed out there was actually services that titus took and preached on these things you know why titus was a pastor these are not the kind of things that you necessarily would go preach out in a convention it's it's there's a total different thing that's going on but this is a time where it's exhorting the believer it's encouraging them in the manner not not necessarily of things that maybe they don't even know but it's to remind us and god comes down in that season to encourage you and i when you and i are going through the battle here we are under the pressure and the word of the lord comes to encourage you and i it don't mold us the word itself don't come and shape us anybody what it does is encourages us to lay down our will put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work to speak evil of no man to be no brawlers but gentle showing all meekness unto all men who got quiet now watch how paul would bring this i love this this is where we stand we resolve from for we ourselves were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lust and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another but after that the kindness and love of our god our savior toward man appeared what was it had a meeting with melchizedek begin to reveal who you really are hallelujah not by works of righteousness which we have done well i'm going to stop doing this and stop doing that but it's the by the word we're laying it down by the unction of the word but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration the transforming power renewing of the holy ghost which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our savior that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life you know what paul's just let it be known the reason you're different is because he came to you and they need you to be jesus to them hallelujah they might never read the bible but let it be that it's that life of the word that's projecting itself through you that what has appeared to you that marvelous light that brought you out of darkness that same light would shine forth this is a faithful saying and these things i will but thou affirm constantly now so this wasn't just a one weekend deal keep revisiting it that they which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable unto men philippians 2 14 do all things without murmurings and disputings okay say lord help me help me he can he'll come to that lord help me you see what god is doing sometimes the circumstances that we said we're so interested in getting out oh i got to get out of this way when i get out of this i'll just be a better christian but god uses circumstances to mold us and shape us taking away parts that's really not us parts that we've been praying god let me die more to myself and god knows you and i wouldn't just do that just lay it down but it takes character mourning through suffering this is why that you might be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life let me end here here was a man down there in the book of esther by the name of mordecai her uncle there came a man one day here's haman haman gets up into a high position haman his heart is filled with hatred to the jews but he so he comes by all of them down through the you know coming out of the palace and so forth and everybody's bowing to him and oh yes amen and yes haman now mordecai's not a disobedient guy he submits himself to all the ordinance of men but that crossed the line right there mordecai said i ain't bowing to you i'm not doing that kind of reverence to you i'll reverence the position and if you say go do this or instruct this i'll do that but as far as bowing to you i ain't bowing i am worshiping no man you see this is discernment in the time of pressure when pressure was coming here was mordecai able to discern that what he should submit to and what should not be submitted to is that right brother branham himself over and over if you take it and just type in the word cuffs c-u-f-f-s and where he deals with how he's been brought in before kings and they you know take the cuffs out of the trousers and they do all these things and you got to walk before them and you can't never turn your back you got to back away from them you know you back up like this and you walk out and there's even how you talk to him and he brother brown says you don't say hey buddy or or this or that you know there's a way that you you talk to him brother brown would take that and think of all the messages on approach to god god's provided a way of approach brother brown would take that that experience and he would deal with that now he's had those experiences with kings in the natural he had a meeting with the pope that was arranged you've heard this they did they took the cuffs out and everything else and brother brown asked him he said now he said when i get in there what do i have to do all you got to do is bow down on a knee and kiss his hand he said that's out of the picture billy graham met with him all the rest of them met with him but here stood a prophet of god in this age let me tell you something that wasn't just the genes of branham that was a gene of god right there brother that was an elect child of god that was standing there that would represent the wheat coming to maturity in this hour that will not bow the creeds will not bow to darkness we'll not bow to the doctrines of man but we'll stand with just saith the lord hallelujah there's a strength and a power and a vision that has come with this message it's brought a boldness not an arrogance but a boldness to stand on thus saith the lord knowing the authority that we're under and that authority being governed to recognize things that come temptations come to act unbecomingly or rudely you can be pulled temptation is not sin you might have even succumbed to it but the spirit of god on the inside of you charity will not accept that you know what that means you're going through that test again and sometimes there's just certain things about us the way that we're made up well it's just a lot that's got to be rubbed out sometimes you wonder wonder why i attract these kind of people it's because there's certain things that's got to be rubbed out y'all going to preach with me god knows what it takes to expose the greenness in our life because man we feel like our raps are ready wish everybody else just get caught up here i'm rapture ready glory to god come on y'all you sorry hurry up and god says hmm let an offense come your way oh god knows what he's doing i just want to submit i want to submit i i don't want to resist him i don't want to resist i don't want to fight the trial or the test i don't want to fight when the offenses and those things come brother samuel what should we do we should pray over brother brown would say it like this on the message super sense i find all throughout the message brother brown and there's things that where especially you'll find i know you find in other places but you'll find it in the tabernacle a lot i've noticed it when he's there in the tabernacle hill there's a lot of counsel that'll come out with things that's even taking place in the tabernacle and how to handle different things things that's coming up and brother braham says he said you just pray he said until you feel better about that person keep praying until you feel better about that person because it's something about it as you really enter into prayer and are honest with god god's able to melt away and you and i lose sight of the offense the sting of it's not there but the same shall i really be that honest with god yeah he he already knows it but just keep on putting it before him if it's something that's just not set and just right just keep on talking to him about it just keep putting it before him listen he's working he's working amen let's pray hallelujah hallelujah anybody else want to be remembered in prayer here we go so lord mold me lord help me to stand there like the clay on the wheel and be molded amen god bless you let's pray for one another heavenly father lord jesus how we lord are so thankful for your words of comfort exhortation and we're thankful for the reproof and the rebuke as well lord we need it lord you know what we have need a father i pray that lord behind these hands that are lifted up there's hearts lord jesus a heart that beats for you a life that dear god that desires that you would be the one who's reflected through our lives that before we would ever have to ever say a word or a word

i know different ones experience it as well lord we all have different pressures and things that come our way but help us lord to realize that here in the scriptures i believe we have by your presence tonight the lord some of these things that when we look at it as we cement ourselves to every ordinance of man under the discernment of the spirit of god knowing that the governors the magistrates all those things as paul would tell us to pray for all those that's in power we know we're not to pray to turn america around that's not at all it's but it's to pray lord jesus that we might live quietly and peaceably we're longing to be delivered from this bondage of corruption help us lord help us lord i pray that in the line where we are at lord god help us to submit to your molding and to your shaping i realize lord within each and every one of us things that lord that come our way things that take place it's to shape our character [Music] lord you'll never hold us down that's not what you do the lord it's where our character is submitted as the lamb himself submitted his own life so lord god must we submit to the plan of god help us lord may you strengthen each and every one here tonight if there's one lord that doesn't know you in that real personal way in the very depth of their life i pray tonight god that lord it would just move up next to their heart and may every thought of doubt no matter what the enemy would try to whisper to him lord god i ask that the holy spirit would just lord god give them strength to drive that away and let them know lord god it's for them lord that they could receive lord that that character of life that'll mold the very character of jesus christ in their own character help us lord i pray help us every one of us lord i pray [Music] granted lord give us discernment in these things help us lord as fathers as mothers lord god you spoke to us so personally here tonight lord with such discernment and wisdom of the spirit of god help

want you love oh love jim there's just no more love for i could never ever out love the lord or could we just stand and sing it let's just raise our hands i want to live all the way that he wants me [Music] and i want to give lord to surrender afresh until there's no more to give i want your love love chill till there's just no more love for i could never ever out [Music] over and over he molds me and makes me clean to his likeness he fashions the of honor oh i am today all because jesus didn't throw the clay away he is [Music] [Music] that's how he wants me to stay but when i stumble and fall and my best breaks he just picks up the peace [Music] is into his likeness oh he's fashioning the clay a vessel of honor oh i am today it's all because jesus [Music] and he's still working on me to make me want out to be it took him just a week to make the moon and the stars the sun and the earth and jupiter and ohio aren't you glad he's still working on you make me [Music] the sun and the earth and jupiter how loving patient he was he must be he's still working on oh yes [Music] [Music] oh [Music] you know how it is if any of you've ever watched somebody make furniture or you've looked at little things like that and even when it's they're doing the clay on the wheel there's a lot of things at first when they're doing that clay there's a lot of chunks that fly off at first a lot of things you can see really take form wow it's that's a big difference but when it gets down to some of the finishing touches it isn't things that all together you're seeing fly off here this file but it's things that's necessary for the finishing touches just like it changes with wood and things like that when you're working with wood it'll change from where you're cutting it with the saw and things like this and then to eventually get down to a spot you've got sandpaper on it you're putting a certain type of finish on and it's not a maybe a real heavy sandpaper you're down to a detailing time in it and there's certain times in our life god's bringing us to in this hour you may not seem like you're seeing a lot of chunks fly off that don't mean that there's not work going on it's a time of finishing touches it's a time of of detailing and i'm grateful until the time that of the rapture or go by the way of the grave brother brown calls that until this life is fully developed out
