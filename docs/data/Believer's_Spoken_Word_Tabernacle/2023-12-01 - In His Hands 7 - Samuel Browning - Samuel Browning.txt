song Amen man a beautiful reality that man that in the midst of the storm in the midst of everything that's where that's where our real Joy comes from that we know and whom we have believed amen that's why we can worship in the midst of the storm we can worship when everything else is going around you know like John when he looked in as we looked at that on Sunday John heard the 24 Elders worshiping but that's not what moved him he heard the angels worshiping but that's not what moved him but when John looked and he said there's John amen John's worship was personal amen it just Blended right in together amen and I'm so thankful God's a personal God aren't you amen we've got a real a real joy in our hearts amen a real worship and I I tell you this that that song the words and how that I thank you for singing that Paul I didn't ask him to do that but I think it fits so perfectly with what we're going to speak on here tonight because there's no greater reality than to know that God is in control of Our Lives you know when you look at what faith is and brother Bram will take that in the message perfect faith and bring that out for us and Faith itself is not knowing how faith is just knowing God's in control God will work it out I don't know how brother BR said another place of the message he said that's God's business not mine and I I'm grateful for that that I don't have to worry about that it's just a rest that comes to I don't know how all of it's going to work out but I just know that God's got it all in control amen and that's that that's where it's settled at and that's where I rest amen that's not mind over matter that's receiving his word that has life in it and that's what's influencing Our Lives amen don't you love him tonight amen so good to be in the house of the Lord and good to have friend here brother Joshua Martin and brother brother Josh a real faithful Minister and uh We've ministered together there at byc of course he was in the little Tabernacle but it still doesn't matter we ministered together and uh pulled our our weight within that and uh to me they that's a that's a challenge that's a challenge I'd probably be shaking in my boots but uh we're just so thankful the Lord I'm glad our our fellowship that we've that we've have and if you don't know brother Josh some of you probably know his daddy Brother wendle Martin and brother Wendell and uh all the Martins I I'll just go on a record all the Martin they they can sing real good real real blessing to the Bride of Jesus Christ and just a wonderful Ministry uh brother Shawn Martin brother Jonathan of course we know brother Jonathan here and uh so we're just uh so thankful to have them here tonight I want to remind you um here I just spoke to brother joshu just uh yesterday and uh so they're going to be leaving uh it'll be 2: a.m. their time which will be 9900 p.m our time tonight so they'll he and sister Sharon will be getting on the plane and then they'll arrive here on Friday night at 11:00 p.m. so I say praise be to God amen amen so uh I tell you one thing you thought I tease brother joshu he smiled really big when he came home from in March well he's really going to be beaming now so Lord willing he and sister Sharon they'll be here with us on Sunday and uh also to keep in mind my wife and myself we will be out on Sunday but brother Ronnie long will be here uh ministering uh for us and so just if you would keep us in prayer keep brother Ronnie in prayer as well we certainly need the leading of the Lord um let's just go to the Lord I don't want I'm sorry for keeping you standing let's just go to him in a word of prayer and then we'll get right into the word Heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are Lord for the great promise and reality Lord Lord where there's a testimony that Lord that comes from the depths of our being our soul that it is well Lord father when everything else that can be all sorts of situations all around us and you told us Lord in this hour we're living in that would be the background for the Rapture Lord we're surrounded Lord where trouble Lord and and turmoil Lord on every side but oh God I'm so thankful Lord that there is a rest in the heart of the believer Lord we're in a place of rest it's a it's a paradox Lord how that in the midst of this time God we didn't put ourselves here we were drawn here by you Lord there was a seed you placed within us Lord and you've drawn us you've led us we wouldn't even know how to find you Lord but it's you that found us Lord how that Lord through every aspect of life you begin to deal with us and draw Upon Our Hearts and Lord just given us the grace to yield now Lord where we can stand as the psalm Lord would say now is my head lifted up above my enemy oh God how thankful we are Lord that it's you that's lifted us lord it's you that's placed us on a rock Lord what a firm foundation we just love you Lord we thank you Father may you I just ask that you would just come Lord here tonight you're here Lord we sense your presence and we just ask that Lord that you'll just take control of speaker and hearer together Lord that there would be something that would be said tonight that God our lives would be edified in you Lord to be strengthened and to be encouraged Lord may you just have your way we pray Lord May that same inspiration just fall upon us tonight Lord we pray we ask it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen let's go to job 23 God bless you amen musicians as you amen thank you for and the playing and and no familiar place and you really think when are we going to move out of this section of the the chapter but uh we we're getting there I was actually studying a little bit ahead here today and I've been going ahead but uh just a few more places here to look at this and um I want to just read here in verse in verse 8 this is a chapter brother Brandon will refer to very many very much in the message I've heard but now I see many times where he's referring and phrasing of these things uh of where job is at in verse eight it says behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him and on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him remember we're speaking on in the hand in his hands and job is bringing this out we know it's figurative and we recognize that the left hand where he doth work God will do nothing without first revealing it to his servants the prophets so job is aware as a as as a prophet God has spoke to him by inspiration and vision and job is saying I know he's working but I don't know what he's doing right now but then he goes on to say he hideth himself on the right hand that's that's the power of God that's the manifestation of God and as Believers I tell you for me I love to see God move I love to hear from him I love to feel his presence you know classify me however you want to but I I love to feel the presence of God we don't always go by feelings but I tell you I I love as I love to see him and I love to hear him I love to hear the testimonies love to see God move love to see that but notice he hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold notice where job's standing he's certain of of the ground that he's standing on right now my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips so I want you notice job's just not one who's reading the Bible you know here it is in the Stars he's not just reading the Bible but job is used to hearing from God and what God is speaking to him job said I've have not gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed I love that word I have esteem the words of his mouth more than my necessary food I love that job saying I just didn't do them I've esteemed them there's a value to the words that he's speaking to my life hallelujah amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to just say that job as we look at this here he was a type of every believer that values the word of God above every idea above every reason above every thought and we know that even in our lives how God works and Deals and moves within our lives it's uh the word of God is continually moving and there's a there's a cleansing there's a cleaning that's taking place we're being changed from Glory unto Glory and that's something that we're thankful for job had a love for God that it was a love that that job did not give himself no more than you or I have given ourselves the love that God has placed in our heart but the Bible says we love him because he first loved us so it's a love that is reciprocated it's a love that he's projected and we have we have received it and it has changed our lives to where now the reflection comes back to him that we are a trophy of where the love of God has taken effect Upon Our Lives job had an anchor in his life this is definite within everything that has taken place job has an anchor now the think job is a type of the believer not having even the access or the privilege that you and I would have as a Believer to actually have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seal of the Living God upon our soul but job was a type of a of of an individual that it will reflect that just as job by the portion that God allowed it in that time job lived by the word of God job lived he esteemed to live by the word above everything else and here's the thing that we can think of this that within it brother Brian I don't know something just kicked here I don't know what it was but job in all of it he knew he was right in the message message I have I have heard but now I see if you go to that quote there job knew that he was right and here brother BR says when he found out here in the scriptures these fellows come to him his church members everything that once seemed dear to him had turned against him and tried to accuse him of being a secret sinner because all these things had happened to him you hear people yet today say I told you look at him you see that ain't alltogether the truth sometimes it's God testing his people and in this case it was God testing job the best man there was on Earth at that time wow what a compliment you're the best man the best man on Earth God's going to test the best man on Earth amen it's fitted to be tested because what would show was what quality that job was of job was a part of God and here here the best man there was on Earth at the time now I want you to watch this statement now he was holding him then job wasn't holding himself God was holding him because that he knew Job was a prophet that had a vision from God and that he had exactly done what God had told him to do and God was Duty bound to keep his promise to him and I going say it for us as a Believer for me as a Believer for you as a Believer he's our everything yes he is he's everything to me uh that's not just a cliche he's everything it's what he's he's all that I evaluate everything in my life with decisions that I make I you see decisions that you come to a place in really with serving God that it's no longer about is this right or is this wrong it now com comes down to a personal place of where what is it that will please God for the purpose that he's called me for so it has nothing about what's lawful what's not has everything to do with Lord I just want to please you and you know what I don't feel the least little bit restricted amen I don't feel the least little bit robbed or deprived can I get a witness on that tonight I don't feel I don't feel that if there's anything at all I've missed a lot of Heartache I've missed a lot of other everything else but notice like job when job esteemed God's word above everything else not just that job did it you know you can do the word of God but yet not esteem it when you esteem it you value it and job this was something he valued the word of God this was before the trial ever came God's desire was his delight and like job it means everything to us to see him to hear him and even feel his presence I think of it like this if a person could say well you know we don't need to see Miracles anymore that first of all that's contrary to the scripture the Bible say signs and wonders will follow them that believe and if you are born again of the spirit of God you're a walking living breathing Miracle it's the greatest miracle and I'll tell you another great miracle that you're sitting here tonight in your right mind but tell you another great miracle that even if you're not where you need to be with God but you have something in you that presses you to be here you're a miracle cuz I'll tell you Satan wouldn't be encouraging you to be here it's God at work it means everything to us that's why brother BR could say it like this I believe in the Third Exodus he said Lord he said every once in a while towards the end of the message he said just come Among Us and do something so we know you're with us he's our life and when we haven't seen or heard from him especially when things are are taking place things that we're going through in our life things we've experienced and perhaps we've prayed we've waited for just a word from him we waited maybe put on this tape and you know it's but yet there's been a blessing that's come by our way but yet maybe a direct word about that hasn't dropped maybe here we're coming to the house of God and we're maybe expecting a direct word and not a direct word comes or or we're waiting to see this situation moving we don't see it moving but let me tell you we can take consolation that when we're listening to the message we're in prayer and we're looking even as we sat here in the house of God and his presence moves around us his presence is to encourage you and I because his presence is not confined to this building amen he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you you have a confidence that you can say the Lord is my helper amen amen the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver them amen that has that in itself has nothing to do with feeling that's his word God is the god of his word and to think of it when God has given you an act the Holy Spirit when you think of it who is it that made the promise that you and I are partakers of tonight T God made the promise God's the one who made a way why are we living here for why are we the Church of the Living God I don't have this quote up there but just listen to this why are we filled with the Holy Ghost to remember in the time of trouble he is still here amen Wonder that's why we're filled with the Holy Ghost to remember in the time of trouble he is still here amen he stabilizes things he is the same yesterday today and forever he is with us just the same he might be resting a few minutes between meetings but he's still just the same so to stabilize it it's where something is made uh in a way so that it's unlikely to give way or overturn you know those big cruise ships that they have out there and we spoke on that some time ago that those cruise ship they have within them there's a uh a stabilization whole mechanism in there that it'll actually shift things in there to keep that cruise ship balanced even in the midst of the roughest of waters it has things already built into it and let me say this the stabilizers have been put on the ship the prophet made that declaration in this hour the stabilizers have been put on the ship you see we're not under the ideas or the thoughts or the reasonings of a man that's not what this message is this message is the thoughts of God declared to you and I and confirmed and Vindicated by the spirit and you're witnessing the word working in your life and a man's word won't do that amen a man's word will make you act like a man but God's word makes you act like God it brings Sons and Daughters of God so there's a stabilizer that when pressure comes situations come there is is an internal pressurization system that you're equipped with Hallelujah can I say it like this this equipment was in you the whole time but when the quickening power come it activates the [Music] equipment Hallelujah this is why I want you to think of this where we're standing at we are standing upon the word of God Jesus said heavens and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away amen hallelujah think of this in Luke 16:17 it's is it and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tit of the law to fail that tit means even an accent mark even one little part God does not have to edit cut out or or in his word that it's easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one p Hallelujah right let me just say it to you you are a part of this word when he's talking about the word being fulfilled he's talking about you he's talking about me the scriptures said as many as received him to them he gave the power The Authority Hallelujah to become the sons of of God that whole phrase means to come to pass amen the Holy Spirit moving upon your life is the very one who's bringing the word to pass in your life glory be to God God getting us right into position where we need to be you see he's let mean just say it like this he's holding me he's holding you right Hallelujah on and on through the scriptures when you take that phrase of the Lord is my strength David in the opening of Psalms 27 the Lord's the strength of my life when they cross the Red Sea the very first words that come out of Moses uh mouth in the song is the Lord is become my strength hallu amen hallelujah our strength alone Isaiah said even young people their strength alone their stamina is great but that strength will not endure right but there is a strength that endures when our strength fails am that's when God's strength just steps forward and lets us know I've been here the whole time I'm not leaving I'm not turning back I'm the one that's holding you the whole time just this test or trial makes you aware of that it's me it hasn't been you it's been me the whole time now you can clearly see it's me alone I'm the one holding you he's my strength Hallelujah in Hebrews 1:3 speaking of the word almighty God who being the brightness of his glory the manifested word and the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high no way to keep it from coming to pass amen San loved to try to put every road Brock every roadblock to try to hinder you he'll try to put everything he can over top of a seat of God but let me just remind that devil just like you can put a seed and that seed is there in the ground you put concrete over it it'll find a way to get around it the light itself and the nourishment draws it I don't care what the enemy has put around or over your life there's nothing greater than the seed which is the word which is of God in your life nothing can overthrow the word hallelujah you might be standing with doubt but let me tell you something there's a God here that can change your doubt to Faith let me read this out Amplified cuz I want to take these words and verse three of Hebrews 1 he is the sole expression of the glory of God the light being the out ring or Radiance of the Divine and he is the perfect imprint and very image of God's nature upholding this where I want to draw from upholding and maintaining and guiding and propelling the universe by his mighty word of power that's just awesome awesome Amen he's upholding me he's maintaining me he's guiding me and he's propelling me hallelujah hallelujah I want you to think of this it's God who is who is keeping you and I in the message for him will I accept brother Bram said now you've got a way that you say ups and downs and ups and downs he said I would advise you to go to God and stay there until you really born again when trials and troubles and heartaches and disappointments set in something holds not you holding something holding you Hallelujah I don't find that discouraging I find that encouraging that if I was a person Sting with ups and downs I find encouragement hey there's a deeper walk with God than I found amen and God's calling me to a deeper walk he's letting me know there's a deeper walk Hallelujah something holds not you holding something holding you it isn't a question whether I hold on or not it's a question whether he held on or not it isn't looking at me it's looking at him he's the one brother Bram goes on to say in the message love he says to think that perfect love cast out all fear you're not scared about nothing you're just resting you're not oh I may backslide tomorrow I may backslide next week I won't worry about that I'm not trying to hold on he held on for me and he put a love in my heart that holds there it's him holding me not me holding him remember brother Brandon was asked by I think Mr eer pulled up next to him he's walking away from the graveyard Billy said he said how he said how you holding your religion now he said I'm not he said he's holding me he said if it was up to me he said i' turned loose a long time ago because why our strength can give out but there's a strength on the inside that shows there's something deeper than just the DNA of our natural family tree it's the strength of almighty God what's he doing upholding you maintaining you he is guiding you and he is propelling you Hallelujah in his hands glory be to God if it was if it was me holding him I'd probably turn loose but as long as he's holding me he'll never turn loose he promised he would now let's look at this in Psalm 63:7 let's just look at this just for a moment because thou Hast been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I rejoice right you know it'd be like somebody want that don't worry I ain't going to be real long it it'd be just like somebody you know running and say oh you running over to Mama now Mama's Boy I don't care what you call me in the shadow of his wings I'm going to Rejoice you know why I'm safe ever moreall amen I'm safe in the shadow of his wings my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me it upholds me now notice the right hand is upholding me on the left hand he work but it's his right hand that's upholding me that word uphold means to grasp to hold the support attain to lay hold of hold fast in Isaiah 41:10 he said fear thou not for I'm with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness so how does God uphold Us by his word is that right by his spirit because remember his his spirit is his word made manifest true you see to to the believer in this hour the spirit of God is Not Just An anointing or an emotion the spirit of God is the person of Jesus Christ amen it's the word that's here anointing us a living God the spirit of Truth himself that leads us that guides us that directs us notice I'll strengthen thee I'm so grateful for that Psalms 119 uh 116 or verse 116 uphold me according unto Thy word that I may live and let me not be ashamed of My Hope that's my prayer God uphold me according unto Thy word you know there's a lot of things God can do and he does even outside of his word but if he just keep what's inside of here I'm fine amen uphold me according to Thy word that's where I'm resting is on those promises hold thou notice hold thou me up and I shall be safe and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually in other words if you don't hold me Lord I'm not able to see your word as I ought to see it that I can perceive it so god holds us according to his word see this is why the word itself coming into us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the quickening power what it does is it raises up that seed on the inside which is a part of God and then it becomes the word made manifest then you do not think it robbery to be equal with God because you're seeing that same word that same God it's moving in your life there's a sadl within it that you know there's a truth there's a word that's operating in my life and it's holding you it's not just something that you're saying and saying well you know praise God I you know haven't fully backslid all the way no there's a deeper walk than that well praise God I didn't go back on the Dance Floor well I'm glad you didn't but there's a deeper walk than that that's what the word is calling us to uphold me according unto Thy word amen hallelujah not just to be something that's maintained here well praise God I'm not back out smoking and this I'm not back out drinking hey we that that ought to be something that's so far out of sight how is it out of sight because in here there's come an anointing by the I SA of the Holy Ghost a real faith that looks beyond the circumstances and there's no tie or hold to the world any longer go back to go back to what uphold me according to Thy word hallelujah oh Hallelujah God has not called us to be lukewarm Believers but he's called us to be full-fledged Believers that are on fire amen that's why God could said make up your mind I would rather you're hot or you're cold cuz God said the in between I cannot take it right always tease the African Brothers cuz they don't like ice in their water they like it warming so I always give him a bottle of water I said I would that thou were hot or cold so I always tease them about that but you know it's true either be hot or cold I want to be hot don't you yeah notice this word aoli without reading all the Scripture it refers to the word in verse 8 of 2 Chronicles 32 of how that the people rested upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah so the word rested in 2 Chronicles 328 is the same word upholdeth so it's where we're resting not when we're in trauma but we're resting now think about this when we look at this here in the scripture you know there the people were surrounded Jerusalem was surrounded here and then they had threats coming that we're going to come and we're going to dismantle we're going to take apart but God anointed Hezekiah I tell you it took Insight because to recognize that this is not Hezekiah as a man it took it took Insight it took deception you know what it took it took God upholding his people not only did he uphold Hezekiah but God was upholding his people that they could see this is not Hezekiah this is the word of the Lord amen and they rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah Isaiah 26:3 here it comes again thou wil keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee do we got those scriptures okay stayed on thee that word state is the same word upholdeth it ke it stabilizes us Brother s what are you saying I'm saying that remember as we come into the presence of God as we come into the house of God as we're hearing as we're giving ourselves to the word it's God who is maintaining our cause it's God who is strengthening you and I God doesn't remove all the obstacles he strengthens you and and I to be able to stand right in the midst of it brother we don't got the rock of dbal we got the Rock of Ages Psalm 20:6 now I know that the Lord saveth his anointed and he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand some trust in chariots some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God hallelujah how powerful testimonies are amen you remember not only what God did for you but that testimony of what God did in your life is not just for you it's for somebody else and remember the name of God the character of God it was God coming to fulfill his word and God brings it back to our mind hallu verse 35 thou Hast given me me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand hath Holden me up and thy gentleness hath made me great aren't you glad that he he's upholding you amen amen you now when our walk when we Todd with our walk or we you know fall God doesn't reach down you know like when a toddler Falls or or you know if you trip God doesn't reach down if you trip and pick you up and spank you he reaches down his hand and picks you up amen his right hand upholds you verse 17 of Psalms 37 for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the Lord upholdeth the righteous the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and He Delight in his way because you're a tabernacle of the Living God God's living behind your Badger skin God's living inside of you it's God directing your life life you wouldn't know what next step to take but God is guiding you and leading you Hallelujah and with the purpose he's called you to it may not be that he says go here do this but you know God has called me for this purpose so I'm going to make those Footprints according to what God has saidise Hallelujah though he fall he shall not UT UT be cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand amen amen I'm glad about that am Psalm 16:8 I have set the lord always before me I love that scripture because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved amen he's my strength am amen so good to be reminded that the Lord has a clear purpose an objective in our lives and he's going to perform it the same way that he has performed every other promise Mary asked him how shall this be seeing I know not a man he said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow me she submitted to the word of God yes and God brought his word to pass through a yielded vessel amen it's the same pattern all the way down the difficult and the most challenging part is getting us to yield the challenge but I'm grateful God rolls his sleeve up he's up for the challenge oh my so this plan or purpose it's not viable to overthrow see God is moving God is working the promise that he's given us is that when the enemy would come in like a flood that the spirit of the Lord will raise a standard against the enemy what's God doing he's upholding he's maintaining he's guiding and he's propelling all the way down through the ages under that of the lion anointing they could only respond to the anointing they were under right when it came to the ox Anointed The Man same thing with the eagle you can you and I can do nothing but respond to the anointing that we're under oh God I I I I I want that of that eagle anointed to swow like brother John Sanger when he read that quote on Eagle St This n That quote is just so resonated in my heart God let me have Eagle thoughts I just want Eagle thoughts the things that just you know because Satan's always trying to get us to light down here upon this this earth right through every little tactic or thing that he can do to try to bring us down into this realm right yeah that's true we got to live here it's true we got to walk here it's true we got to face the things of life but we don't have to be controlled by the senses of this life we were made to control those things as Sons and Daughters of God I want you to think of this let me just kind of turn I going to turn here just for a few moments in Psalms 145:4 the Lord upholdeth all that fall that almost seems kind of contradictory but it's not God's word can't be overthrown Samson himself was overthrown but the word was not overthrown the word cannot be defeated Samuel what are you saying I'm saying just because somebody or you may not be where you ought to be God has not wrote you off amen hallelujah pise the Lord the Lord upholdeth all that fall I'm glad you say why are you glad because I can remember as a 13-year old boy matter of fact a year old boy when I was baptized did I go all the way at that time no then I remember as a 13-year-old boy my you know had a real touch from God but was it to the depth it needed to be no I didn't know that at that moment so I didn't I didn't continue I didn't continue on the pressures and the things of the world and everything else coming around but you see even though you say oh here Samuel you know just just just tottering just falling then here 19 years old coming home from college the first year and in an unexpected time in an unexpected moment in a basement of all places brother Bill in your basement wow unexpected moment but God takes a hold of my life but Samy did you understand all that was taking place no I didn't but I knew one thing it come to a place God had brought me to a place I no longer want to live this life I no longer want to be bound with these things I no longer want to walk this way you say who put that in your heart God did you see that seed was there the whole time it was there beneath the darkness it might have been like well fall here fall there but the Lord upholds his word his word cannot be over Throne that's why I say I don't care what you see when you look at your children [Music] hen Hallelujah the prophet says it so clearly in the message of how that those little boys of of had he writes were laughing when he was telling the testimony come on somebody we could look at that with scripture and say man you're laughing against the works of the Holy Ghost but God knew what was beneath [Music] there let me tell you what happened in that love humble little home the same almighty God that spoke in the beginning and said let there be light was the same almighty God that came down in that little Shack of haty Rights hall hallelujah whatever you ask for that's she said I want the salvation of my two boys right there they fell across her lap weep their way to Calvary and we're filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah I tell you when I to me when I look at that and I read of that you know what that says it is the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that means everything and there's nothing that can create an atmosphere like the preaching of the word of God in season it inspires our faith to look beyond what we see Hallelujah let me just tell you something the devil never come and get on your shoulder and tell you you you're just getting excited the no God will never tell you that the devil will the devil will tell when you know you flopped before God never tells you that you got to recognize that devil is a liar Hallelujah just like this stuff you see over there I've watched videos of different times and look at the stuff of this with the Hamas that's what the stuff that's going on over there right now they're playing with them it's all propaganda longer they can get something drawn out here this morning or it was last night a few more minutes and the truth was getting ready to end then all of a sudden oh we're going to exchange and I just I just had seen a video where there was some Israelis that stood there and they said look it cannot cease we are not this is what I found tremendous it says we're not we are not doing this out of Revenge we're doing this because to avoid this type of atrocity it said it's not the gods and people it's Hamas and I like I like it they said they said in there to me I I I don't know this this video and the Resolute part of those family members that could stand there and say look at all cost don't stop fighting come on and as they were able to commentate it meaning that that our freedom our liberties that Tranquility here is valued more than just lives that to me it resonated deep in my heart sir Lord I mean even the commentators were blown away by those statements why is because what is Val you more I think that's what's going on there you know that over there is a type of what's going on right here [Music] spiritually Satan's got a lot of little sneaky tunnels he likes to pop out at oh my we could go on that but I I'm going to stay here just on I got to finish this out here right that's a whole another thing but the Lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be bowed down thank you Jesus now I want to just just go here just for a few moments here in the book of Ezra and I'm just going to I want to just look at a few scriptures and just watching this of the hand of the Lord as it's upholding your life when Israel come back from Babylon remember there was a group that came back first and when they came back adversaries came against them that were in the land when they came back from Babylon the 70 years of Exile they laid the foundation then the people of the land it says they came against them with accusations to frustrate that word means to break the purpose and for 15 years nothing was done they just were content with life they were building their houses and they were what what is the HEI chapter 1 goes into it they were just become involved with self the vision and the purpose had become lost so in other words the decisions that Israel was making had nothing to do with the purpose that was above every other purpose the purpose that God called him for wasn't for them to build a house the purpose God called him for was his house you see the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and then all these other things will be added unto you if that if that gets out of order you have to scramble and scramble and scramble and push and chove and you're trying to make things come together that will fall in order if you're under the right order you understand what I'm saying sometimes PE sometimes are our lives we can be enticed to do this and and do this and do that remember there there's blessings when we abide in the order there's a divine order of God and I'll tell you this right here if there's something that that even though that I might be able to have if God sees I'm talking about lawfully God sees Samuel that wouldn't be good for you I don't want it I don't want it if it's going to hinder him working in my life I I don't want it because him he he means more than anything else is that right is that how you feel that's what means more than anything else that's where everything gets evaluated notice I want you to think of this the hand of God now just just a just a few moments here I've got I've got here right in front of me and notice remember when the Bible would say Elisha was standing there and they didn't know what to do in that battle they had went out there in the desert and no water around them they brought a Minstrel and the minstrel began to play the Bible then says the hand of the Lord Came Upon Elisha and then he began to prophesy he began to unfold the Victory and the path of Victory to them Ezekiel we looked at this on some time ago Ezekiel the hand of the Lord would carry him here it would show him things that had taken place were taking place and would take place it was the hand of the Lord showing him all of this now here we come into a moment where Israel the temple has been rebuilt and now it's time for Ezra to come and Ezra comes and I just want just a few scriptures that I'm going to read here that pertain to the hand of God strengthening God's people to fulfill the purpose that God has allotted in Ezra 79 here's Ezra this is the testimony for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon on the first day of the first month came he to Jerusalem according to the good hand of his God upon him how did Ezra know when it was time to go the hand of the Lord see it's God upholding maintaining guiding propelling Hallelujah he knew when it was time because the hand of the Lord where Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments in verse 27 of that same chapter here he says blessed be the Lord God of our fathers which hath put a thing as this in the king's heart to beautify the house of the Lord which is in in Jerusalem and hath extended Mercy unto me before the king his counselors before all the king's Mighty princes and I was strengthened as the hand of the Lord my God was upon me and I gathered together out of Israel Chief men to go up with me so what were the chief men responding to the hand of the Lord that was strengthening Ezra this was their time to go others had went before started got the Foundation built the walls all of those things and finished the temple but now hear the hand of God moving in direction to give them strength to give them the nudge to encourage them onward Ezra 8:21 now here they come out here they come out Ezra comes out loaded with all of these Treasures to go back to Jerusalem loaded with treasures now remember what's between him and getting back to Jerusalem you've got all sorts of land that's filled with Bandits right brother brah will say it over and over ishmaelites is that right notice but here's what Ezra came to he says I proclaimed to fast there not knowing what to do I proclaimed the fast there at the river of ahaba that we might afflict ourselves before our God to seek him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance boy what a way to raise a family I don't know what to do Lord but I know you don't you know how to lead me I'm at a place right here that I don't I I seem like nothing's coming to me but I know you're there to lead me and guide me and you can show me the application for I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and Horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken unto the king saying the hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake Him so we fasted and besought our God for this and he was intreated of us the testimony we're here because of the hand of God God has moved upon the king his hand is moved because it's the time it's the same thing within your life in your job the Bible said that that that that every man's gift he said the gift maketh room for itself are you hearing me oh brother Samuel Prophet Apostle no the gift it's true we can apply it there but the prophet tells us the real gift is that soul that come from God he is Jehovah Gyra God makes a way for himself it's God who makes a way Hallelujah so when opposition comes here we are standing in that time and it just goes to show God said I'm the one holding you the whole time I'm the one that's been strengthening you sometimes you feel like that my everything's going just right and then there's other times where you look and say I don't feel like I can make another step but it's his right hand that's strengthening you and all the time his left hand his purpose is being worked out in our lives not only not only things that we would so much see out here but it's so much that's being gained in here by God and if it's being gained by God then it's being yielded by us one more scripture here here's Nehemiah coming back you know a Here Comes Nehemiah it's time to build the walls up so when Nehemiah comes back and the Bible goes on to say in verse 8 of Nehemiah 2 if they just go to the end of it if that would be all right the Bible Well maybe let me say he gave me Timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which are pertained to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into in other words when Nehemiah came he came with his bag full of what was needed let me tell you something this message is not lacking it listen because you see the message it's Christ amen amen there is no lacking in Christ what God is requiring and you look or even the enemies look and say pile of rubbish who's going to rebuild these Gates who's going to do this let me tell you there is sufficient power in this word to achieve what God has called to be achieved Hallelujah and the King granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me let me tell you as we tell that a gift maketh room for itself God has you where he has you right now and be content in that of the Lord is my helper it's God who's making a way and when God sees fit that I no longer am supposed to be here then God will move me where he needs me to be next a might is started in the prison then I go to Piper's house then I'm back in the prison again but all of those places were necessary parts of Joseph's journey and what I love in the scriptures over and over and over is repeated in Genesis and acts and the Lord was with Joseph oh my don't you love him then I told them the good hand the hand of my God was good upon me and the King's word that he had spoken to me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for this good work he's upholding us even in the midst of the situations and no matter what it is what's important is is that you know that you're anchored right that's what's very important in this hour friends it's an hour as we we hear it over and over and I know even I pray that even as this would go out even over the over all that attend here that call that call this their home assembly and others that would hear and be blessed it's an hour to know where you're standing amen it's an hour to be very very sure it's an hour to understand that's why the word came to make you and I aware bring us to a place to where of rest that's what the coming of the word has done in this hour to bring us to a place of rest and that place of rest is in him he is our Promised Land he is our place of rest is that right it brings us to that place to where we're no longer up and down and in and out but there's a rest in him and like job let me just say it like job job had a value for the things of God there's one thing about it we you know when we look at it that comes that comes by A Love Affair in our life you see I I couldn't look to you or somebody else and say hey you need to esteem the word of God more well it's true we we should esteem it but to realize if you don't if that's not there in your heart to where you valow value his words his words if you don't value it and it's not something that you esteem more than anything else then it's something to say Lord I need to go deeper am and frankly all of us need to go deeper but I think it's very very crucial to understand that that look God's not throwing anybody under the bus the Bible said he upholdeth all that fall and he raiseth up so God's here to take us to a deeper walk right do you realize that they could not go into the holiest of holies on their own they had to go in by the blood is that right and the only way it's God coming down really it's not you and I walking somewhere else it's God it's the blood going deeper in our life because this is his Tabernacle this is to be his Dwelling Place you love him tonight and he's the one who's up holding you he's the one who's giving you the strength sometimes we look and say well you know like Ezra the rest why why is all this this adversity and why is all these uh different things that's that's going on around me I tell you it's just a moment to say Lord just help me in the midst of this just to see you and what I mean by seeing you is to recognize it's him that's holding you and the same God that's holding you now is the same God that's been holding you all along and God allows and he permits situations to arise in our life like example forgiveness well how would we ever be able to how how would you practice forgiveness if you had nobody to forgive but see God calls upon us to do that but you know you can't do that on your own it takes the strength of almighty God it takes God to bring that release within your life is that right this is why when reconciling itself the reconcile forgiveness leads to reconciliation and reconcile means to restore to a former state of Harmony now former state of Harmony doesn't mean you're setting down back at the coffee shop perhaps like you used to but the former state of Harmony is where everything within you is free and clear are you hearing me to where there's no animosity in here there's no feeling in here if there's still that feeling I think we can be honest before God tonight and that's what God wants that's a moment for his right hand to be made manifest that as he works things out in our life I need more I need more of him I want more of him and I just want I want to just rest and just look to him and say God you brought me this far you'll take me the rest of the way if you need a deeper walk with God which all of us do then you know what God's here to take us the rest of the way if you need that of the Seal of the Holy Ghost upon your soul God will take you the rest of the way stay with him amen put your hand in his hand and let him take you there he will take you to where you need to be this is this is our comfort don't you love him amen let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord how thankful We Are Tonight Lord that we have Lord a true Assurance Lord we can look back lord over our lives and Lord just from the beginnings Lord and see Lord that sometimes Lord even in the very beginning when there's hard trials and things that come Lord father that test us because as you said in your word every son that cometh to God must first be tested and tried Lord there's things sometimes that at that moment we did not know how we were going to make it but Lord your strength has proven to be perfect certainly certainly wasn't me certainly wasn't us holding on Lord It's your strength in our life Lord is each one Lord in Journey with you Lord I pray tonight God think of how your Prophet said it like this when the Holy Spirit would St strike the heart for any tonight Lord that hear under the sound of my voice or Lord would stream or archive this if there
