[45:06] Word of God speak raise the name of the

[45:19] me to First Samuel chapter 13 I want to
[45:21] say it's good to be here this morning
[45:22] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[45:25] and it's good to have brother Steven and
[45:27] his family here god bless you brother
[45:29] Steven verse verse 8 of 1st Samuel 13
[45:47] well when that good Thursday night
[45:50] too bad we couldn't have just cancelled
[45:52] his ticket and had him here today so
[45:58] good to be in the Friends of the Lord
[46:02] let's read these few verses of Scripture
[46:05] then we'll let you have your seats here
[46:09] the Bible says and he tarried seven days
[46:14] according to the set time that Samuel
[46:17] had appointed the Samuel came not to
[46:21] Gilgo and the people were scattered from
[46:24] him and Saul said bring hither a burnt
[46:28] offering to me and peace offerings and
[46:31] he offered of the burnt offering and it
[46:36] came to pass that as soon as he had made
[46:39] an end of offering of the burnt offering
[46:42] behold Samuel came and Saul went out to
[46:48] meet him that he might salute him and
[46:51] Samuel said what hast thou done and Saul
[46:56] said because I saw that the people were
[47:00] scattered from me and that thou camus
[47:02] not within the days appointed and that
[47:05] the Philistines gathered themselves
[47:07] together at mcNeish therefore said I the
[47:13] Philistines will come down now upon me
[47:16] to gilga and I have not made
[47:18] supplication unto the Lord I forced
[47:21] myself therefore and offered a burnt
[47:25] offering and Samuel said to Saul thou
[47:30] hast done foolishly thou has not kept
[47:36] the commandment of the LORD thy God
[47:38] which he commanded thee for now with the
[47:42] Lord have established thy kingdom upon
[47:45] Israel forever but now thy kingdom shall
[47:50] not continue the LORD hath sought him a
[47:54] man after his own heart and the LORD
[47:56] hath commanded him to be
[47:58] Hampton over his people because thou has
[48:03] not kept that which the LORD commanded
[48:06] thee amen
[48:09] may God bless you and bless the reading
[48:10] of his word as you're being seated
[48:22] the Word of God is truly we received the
[48:26] forest it is up as David would say it's
[48:30] a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[48:32] path way it's always there and when the
[48:36] Holy Spirit comes by and he brings
[48:39] illumination to his word he brings
[48:43] himself there and begins to make himself
[48:46] known through his word it it gives
[48:48] direction it gives opens up a pathway a
[48:51] channel for you and I to be able to walk
[48:54] and to serve Him according to his will
[48:58] and we find that as we're looking at
[49:01] here within Saul within Saul's life and
[49:05] just looking at where it has come to
[49:08] Saul has been raining as three years as
[49:11] king we find something here and I just
[49:15] asked you just to stay with me here just
[49:17] a few moments and just see how which the
[49:19] pathway God's will take us this morning
[49:22] but we recognize that even though Saul
[49:26] knows the commandment of the Lord but
[49:30] yet he's not kept it I think that we
[49:34] could we could agree firmly on this that
[49:39] it was nothing that was wrong per se
[49:43] with the burnt offering it wouldn't have
[49:46] been that he didn't have the wood in
[49:48] order it wouldn't have been that he
[49:49] didn't have the sacrifice in order
[49:51] it was nothing wrong as far as with we
[49:55] could say the order but then what was
[49:59] missing
[50:00] within it all was the leadership of the
[50:04] Holy Spirit and this is where as
[50:09] fundamental it saw was within this
[50:11] within this time it was a failure to
[50:15] wait on the Lord to bring his word to
[50:18] pass I want to just deal with this this
[50:21] morning just a little bit just on how
[50:23] that gone so press of my heart has
[50:25] throughout the week it it's to have we
[50:29] we you you and I as believers this this
[50:32] is what separates us and may
[50:34] believers is the presence of the Lord
[50:37] and in that the presence of the Lord we
[50:41] know that that's just not a feeling
[50:44] something that we feel when we come to
[50:47] the house of God
[50:48] his presence should be here but remember
[50:52] he says lo when you when you have been
[50:56] born of the Spirit of God he said lo I
[51:00] am with thee even to the end of the
[51:05] world whether you feel him or you don't
[51:11] feel him he is present and I would say
[51:20] that every one of us if we'll be honest
[51:22] we like to feel his presence when
[51:27] there's things that I am supposed or
[51:33] laid before me to do I like to feel his
[51:37] presence I'll just be honest with you I
[51:40] like to feel his presence say brother
[51:42] Sammy of you you ought to walk by faith
[51:44] I am walking by faith but then there's
[51:47] other times sometimes where things you
[51:49] know situations come that I don't feel
[51:53] his presence but I know that this is his
[51:57] word and we can see as we looked at our
[52:01] hearts desire is to walk in obedience to
[52:06] his word to please him this is what this
[52:10] is where we come to so we realized that
[52:14] it's more than just an offering you know
[52:17] this was an offering that's all made but
[52:21] you see God requires more than just an
[52:24] offering he requires an offering through
[52:28] his provided way and then they wonderful
[52:31] that God makes known to you and I his
[52:34] provided way that's that's the grace of
[52:37] God right there if not you and I would
[52:39] be guessing what is the provided way but
[52:42] God opens to our hearts when our desire
[52:45] is really
[52:47] to offer to him and to please him and to
[52:51] serve him and Anna think of this that
[52:53] that through the offering through the
[52:55] offering and I want you just to look at
[52:57] this for a moment
[52:58] through the offering itself
[53:01] the sacrifice is how the way is actually
[53:06] open to you and I the greatest the
[53:11] greatest offering up the greatest
[53:13] offering is that of self-will a
[53:18] surrendering of self-will and that is
[53:21] the greatest challenge in our lives in
[53:26] the garden of gethsemane is where the
[53:29] battle the victory as I brother prayed
[53:31] this morning that is where the lamb
[53:35] prevailed Calvary was only a
[53:40] manifestation of a victory that was won
[53:44] in the Garden of Gethsemane there was a
[53:49] battle lost in a garden and in this
[53:53] garden a battle was won and in this
[53:57] garden the battle the victory is made
[54:00] manifest in this garden it was a victory
[54:07] over self-will three times he prayed not
[54:13] my will
[54:15] vine will be done before the body was
[54:19] ever crucified his own will
[54:24] was crucified not my will vine will be
[54:33] done how many know he prayed let this
[54:37] cup pass from me
[54:41] he knew what awaited him he prayed let
[54:47] it pass from me rather better put it
[54:50] simply like this and souls in prison now
[54:52] Jesus prayed to dodge the cross I like
[55:01] things put that simple it gets down into
[55:03] layman's terms but you see there was a
[55:08] battle that was going on the battle that
[55:10] many times were Lila the battle is not
[55:12] out here
[55:13] the battle is right in here the first is
[55:19] to get the battle stopped there down in
[55:21] that soul that that nature would be
[55:25] changed and transformed to do the
[55:28] perfect will of God and after that then
[55:31] you received power then within your life
[55:34] you received a power through submission
[55:37] that his life can be on display
[55:41] you received an access that you can go
[55:45] to him in the midst of the battle you
[55:47] realize that the battle itself when Saul
[55:50] gives words here about I said the
[55:54] Philistines are around us I said this is
[55:57] going on do you realize he's looking
[55:59] with these eyes he's seeing the enemy
[56:02] with these eyes he's feeling the
[56:05] pressure of the enemy with that spirit
[56:08] and he goes to try to defeat the enemy
[56:14] with his own spirit based on his own
[56:18] eyes but the only way you ever have eyes
[56:24] there's got to be a sacrifice and that
[56:29] sacrifice must be according to God's Way
[56:32] let me say like this there's no way that
[56:36] you and I could be able to see without
[56:40] that of the Holy Ghost the new birth
[56:43] and there's no way we could ever be born
[56:46] again unless there was a sacrifice under
[56:50] the leadership oh oh mighty God he was
[56:54] the Lamb that was led to the slaughter
[56:58] he didn't just go there he was led to
[57:01] the slaughter and because he was willing
[57:03] to go his light was poured out that now
[57:07] through him by the new birth you and I
[57:09] might be able to see to understand the
[57:13] kingdom of God without that there is no
[57:19] seeing constantly within our our being
[57:30] it's a continual battle we know we're
[57:36] not to be pressured or move by time yet
[57:40] we are creatures of time but when we've
[57:42] been born again of the Spirit of God
[57:44] we're no longer just confined to time
[57:48] we're a creation of eternity a new
[57:52] creation in the same old temple amen
[57:56] eternity a part of eternity
[57:59] where in your soul you've passed into
[58:01] that eighth day but yet here you are
[58:03] still standing in this time and it's a
[58:09] battle continually to bring this
[58:11] creature of time subject to that
[58:16] creation of eternity
[58:22] if God has spoken he will not fail
[58:29] he will surely perform his word in his
[58:34] season he will perform his word in his
[58:40] season he will perform his word in his
[58:45] season notice he he he he he will I
[58:55] don't mean to be yelling at you but I
[58:57] wish I had a stronger voice look here in
[59:03] the scripture I'm just going to read a
[59:05] few places here in 1st Samuel 10 8 thou
[59:11] shall go down before me to Gilgal and
[59:14] the whole I will come down unto thee to
[59:16] burn to offer burnt offerings and to
[59:18] sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings
[59:21] 7 days thou shalt tarry till I come to
[59:26] thee joy he said I'm gonna come to you
[59:34] tearing out be there
[59:38] well what time on the seventh day out
[59:40] eat that when I'm supposed to be there
[59:45] the important thing is be where you're
[59:48] supposed to be waiting and looking for
[59:51] the promise don't allow other things to
[59:55] pressure
[59:56] Rahab brother Brandon with the brown
[59:58] bear he got pressured to go feeling like
[1:00:02] how to go with the older if I go with
[1:00:05] the younger what were the older men say
[1:00:07] right now think what brother Brown makes
[1:00:10] a statement like this and he stands
[1:00:12] before his church in the message prayer
[1:00:15] in his presence and he asked the church
[1:00:17] and God forgive me for being dilatory
[1:00:20] you know what dilatory means it means
[1:00:23] lazy now how would we interpret that is
[1:00:26] being lazy because it looks like he's
[1:00:28] moving but what it is
[1:00:30] it was lazy to that of what God had
[1:00:33] shown no matter all that we can do we
[1:00:38] must do oh that he tells you to do of
[1:00:44] all the other efforts and everything
[1:00:46] else you know workers you know the
[1:00:48] scripture speaks up workers and workers
[1:00:50] and workers even leaving that of Satan's
[1:00:52] deceitful workers workers workers
[1:00:55] workers workers those little stand
[1:00:57] before the Lord Jesus did not cast out
[1:01:00] Devils did not heal the sick didn't I do
[1:01:02] this didn't I do this hey they were
[1:01:05] workers but what was wrong
[1:01:10] they didn't come through the sacrifice
[1:01:17] seven days shalt thou tarry till I come
[1:01:21] to thee o my hallelujah you know no
[1:01:26] doubt Saul could have said this is what
[1:01:28] Samuel said hold on a moment
[1:01:30] Samuel might have been the man the
[1:01:32] agency but that one Sam you're talking
[1:01:35] that was the Holy Ghost talkin come on
[1:01:39] somebody just like he told Sarah that
[1:01:41] day at there at the tent he said I will
[1:01:45] return unto thee at the appointed time
[1:01:48] of season I will return and Sarah shall
[1:01:52] have a son it was not that flesh man
[1:01:57] that was gonna be recovery it was going
[1:02:00] to be the Living God on the inside
[1:02:02] behind that skin that would actually
[1:02:06] move down in the coming into Sarah
[1:02:12] here's what he said I'll come to thee
[1:02:15] when I'll come to thee one hour you just
[1:02:20] watch
[1:02:22] I will come to thee if he said that that
[1:02:26] settles it hid no matter if it's a
[1:02:29] several-day
[1:02:30] and all of a sudden here we are we're
[1:02:33] standing and let's just use our time for
[1:02:35] sake of terms let's just say it's 11:50
[1:02:39] p.m. what's ten minutes he said he'd be
[1:02:43] here well it's 11:59 he said he'd be
[1:02:48] here now here's what happens once he
[1:02:56] comes this is the pro MoMA or Jesus help
[1:03:00] me this is the promise when he comes
[1:03:02] when he comes I will show thee what thou
[1:03:08] shalt do so with his coming eyesight
[1:03:12] comes your eyes are anointed to be able
[1:03:18] to see you're looking at the battle saw
[1:03:22] and the battle looks too great how can I
[1:03:24] do this how can I overcome this
[1:03:26] how can I get my son this but wait till
[1:03:29] I come and when I come I will show thee
[1:03:34] your eyes will not be seen
[1:03:38] trembling in what you see around you but
[1:03:44] you'll be resting in me like when Jacob
[1:03:48] came back there into the land Jacob
[1:03:50] called the place maja near the camp of
[1:03:54] the two hosts there was a heavenly host
[1:03:58] and there was an earthly hosts Jacob was
[1:04:02] aware there's something greater here the
[1:04:06] Lord of Hosts is present in this place
[1:04:11] so vision true sight it only comes
[1:04:16] through the true sacrifice that's how we
[1:04:20] receive sight is through the new birth
[1:04:22] this is where it moves from just church
[1:04:26] are you with me it moves from just
[1:04:29] church it moves from just a message or
[1:04:32] the message it moves to a personal
[1:04:35] meaning in our life
[1:04:38] this is what makes the difference him
[1:04:41] when I come I will show thee Abraham
[1:04:51] spoken to by God the Lord told him in
[1:04:55] verse 1 get thee out of that country
[1:04:58] from thy kindred and from thy father's
[1:05:00] house unto a land that I will show thee
[1:05:02] I know this was simple but I'm just
[1:05:05] saying it as he's giving it to me you
[1:05:09] can't it be expecting God to show you
[1:05:12] I'll and if you're not willing to get
[1:05:15] out of your country get out of your
[1:05:19] country get away from your Kendra and
[1:05:22] get thee out to a land I will show thee
[1:05:26] Abraham had to be willing for this but
[1:05:30] let me tell you something
[1:05:31] God's patience is greater than any our
[1:05:34] patients could ever be because the
[1:05:37] opening part of this scripture said the
[1:05:39] Lord had said unto Abraham I wonder how
[1:05:43] many times that God has said to us over
[1:05:47] and over and over again forgive me Lord
[1:05:56] now what's this in 1st Samuel chapter 9
[1:06:00] verse 26 here is where that Saul is
[1:06:04] coming to where Samuel is that God has
[1:06:07] already told Samuel that Saul is coming
[1:06:09] this way
[1:06:10] this is the man that I will send and I
[1:06:12] want you to anoint him verse 26 and they
[1:06:15] rose up early and it came to pass about
[1:06:17] the spring of the day that Samuel called
[1:06:19] Saul to the top of the house saying up
[1:06:21] then I'm a Sindhi away and Saul arose
[1:06:25] and they went out both of them he and
[1:06:27] Samuel abroad and as they were going
[1:06:29] down to the end of the city
[1:06:30] Samuel said to Saul bid the servant pass
[1:06:34] on before us
[1:06:35] and he passed on but stand I'll steal a
[1:06:39] while but I may show thee the Word of
[1:06:45] God notice what he said stand still so
[1:06:49] notice that thy servants pass on bid
[1:06:52] them pass on other words separate
[1:06:55] yourself unto this moment sanctify
[1:07:01] yourself for this moment bid them to
[1:07:05] pass on separation and stand still how
[1:07:13] many times God used this in the
[1:07:15] scripture over and over and over told
[1:07:17] job's stand still right and he tells us
[1:07:21] to stand still sometimes takes the
[1:07:24] driver and bolts our feet in the ground
[1:07:25] and you know cuz you know it's just
[1:07:29] wonder sometimes it isn't right here but
[1:07:32] it's if us in our spirit we start
[1:07:34] getting anxious you must say Amen that's
[1:07:40] the truth well brother saying I got the
[1:07:43] Holy Ghost that's true your salt if
[1:07:45] you've been born again that part has
[1:07:47] been better by the Holy Ghost but you
[1:07:50] still got two realms in your life that
[1:07:55] is a part of time that if you pass if
[1:07:58] you pass in this moment those that have
[1:08:03] been redeemed there is a theophany
[1:08:05] waiting to receive that soul no longer
[1:08:10] that human spirit there then it's
[1:08:16] waiting on that of the glorified body
[1:08:19] that flesh body that is made according
[1:08:24] to God's plan now watch this stand still
[1:08:27] awhile and I will show thee the Word of
[1:08:30] God now watch watch how this unfolds
[1:08:32] here and I want you just to look at
[1:08:34] these at these things that are mentioned
[1:08:36] here in 1st Samuel chapter 10 verse 1
[1:08:38] Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it
[1:08:41] upon his head and kissed him and
[1:08:43] Senators is it not because the Lord hath
[1:08:46] anointed me to be captain over his
[1:08:48] inheritance when thou art departed from
[1:08:51] me today then thou shalt find two men by
[1:08:56] Rachel Sepulcher in the border of
[1:08:59] Benjamin as Elsa and they will say unto
[1:09:02] thee the asses which that win us to seek
[1:09:05] are found and lo thy father hath left
[1:09:07] the care of the asses and SAR with for
[1:09:10] you saying what shall I do for my son
[1:09:14] then shalt thou go on forward from
[1:09:17] thence notice what's happening he is
[1:09:19] showing him the Word of God
[1:09:25] this is what he's doing showing him the
[1:09:28] Word of God before it ever comes to pass
[1:09:32] he's letting him know you're gonna go
[1:09:35] here this will be here you'll go here
[1:09:38] they will say this to you this is the
[1:09:42] Word of God not what's in this right
[1:09:45] here that we're reading it's not going
[1:09:47] to be quoted but 10 commandments
[1:09:49] it's not being quoted leviticus numbers
[1:09:52] none of that is being quoted but the
[1:09:57] Word of God is being made manifest and
[1:10:00] it's it crucial this is like we will say
[1:10:03] boot camp it's training saw to catch the
[1:10:09] will of God the Word of God as it's
[1:10:13] coming to pass been shopped out go on
[1:10:16] forward from there so once this happens
[1:10:19] then thou shalt go on forward from
[1:10:21] thence got to keep moving and thou shalt
[1:10:24] come to the plain of - boy and there
[1:10:25] shall meet the three men going up to God
[1:10:29] to Bethel one carrying three kids
[1:10:31] another carrying three loaves of bread
[1:10:32] and another carrying a bottle of wine
[1:10:34] notice the details the details and they
[1:10:40] will salute thee and give thee two
[1:10:43] loaves of bread which thou shalt receive
[1:10:46] of their hands after that thou shalt
[1:10:49] come to the hill of God don't you see
[1:10:52] every bit of this there are stages where
[1:10:55] the Word of God is being unfolded here -
[1:10:59] Saul himself that he might receive
[1:11:03] confidence confidence that what God says
[1:11:08] it will be there at the right time at
[1:11:12] the right moment - the heel of God were
[1:11:18] the garrison of the Philistines and it
[1:11:20] shall come to pass when thou art come
[1:11:22] hither to the city
[1:11:23] thou shalt meet a company of prophets
[1:11:25] coming down from the high place with the
[1:11:27] psaltery and a tablet and a platf and a
[1:11:29] heart before them and they shall
[1:11:31] prophesy and the Spirit of the Lord will
[1:11:34] come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy
[1:11:37] with them
[1:11:38] and shalt be turned into another man and
[1:11:41] let it be notice this let it be
[1:11:48] these signs are coming to thee that thou
[1:11:51] do has occasion serve thee for God is
[1:11:57] with thee and let it be every time you
[1:12:00] find in the scriptures let it be let the
[1:12:03] word dwell in you richly let let let
[1:12:06] means that it is up to you and I to let
[1:12:10] it so all of these things that Saul
[1:12:14] would see yes this was spoken and this
[1:12:16] is what's happening well there they are
[1:12:18] you know what those bottles of wine oh
[1:12:19] here are those prophets well here's the
[1:12:21] hill of God on all those things all of
[1:12:23] these were junctures all of these were
[1:12:26] that of the Word of God that was being
[1:12:29] shown to Saul and what was spoken he
[1:12:33] would see it it was not just going to be
[1:12:36] a word out here it would be something
[1:12:38] that would be made manifest to him all
[1:12:41] glory to God don't you see this is to
[1:12:45] build confidence in the Word of God but
[1:12:49] when God has said it he will bring it to
[1:12:52] pass let it be when these signs are come
[1:12:56] unto thee that thou doest occasion
[1:12:59] survey this word occasion it's a
[1:13:01] wonderful word it means do for thee as
[1:13:03] thy hands shall find or in other words
[1:13:05] acquire that which has been found
[1:13:09] receive it unto thyself
[1:13:14] so here's one thing forgot to make known
[1:13:17] his word it's one thing it's another
[1:13:23] thing for us to receive it well is this
[1:13:27] just me or is this God's Word come on
[1:13:31] now you know the battle we go through
[1:13:36] it's a battle I mean we could lay lay
[1:13:38] those to continue to lay them out but
[1:13:40] notice with within this here when all of
[1:13:43] this is taking place here is the word of
[1:13:45] God and folding when this you and you
[1:13:47] begin to see this happen you are to take
[1:13:49] it it wasn't that he was walking up and
[1:13:51] taking things from people but what God
[1:13:54] is making now receive it take it in to
[1:13:59] your bosom and say Lord I see what you
[1:14:03] are showing me just like when God makes
[1:14:07] known his will for different things in
[1:14:09] our life hey it isn't that scriptures
[1:14:12] get quoted it isn't that quotes get
[1:14:14] quoted it isn't that the boss shows up
[1:14:16] and all of a sudden he shows up he's
[1:14:18] downloaded the table app on his phone
[1:14:20] and he has something to express to you
[1:14:22] but there's something about it that God
[1:14:24] lets it be no this is my word for you
[1:14:29] and you say Lord I receive it I take it
[1:14:35] to my bosom for God is with thee this
[1:14:41] this is the this is the point God is
[1:14:44] with thee
[1:14:45] you mean God why couldn't God what could
[1:14:48] have just been said hey God is with you
[1:14:50] he wants to make it so no he'll take
[1:14:55] this angle this angle that angle this
[1:14:58] angle and he'll confirm it you know why
[1:15:00] he knows we need that I said he knows we
[1:15:06] need that if we're honest we need that I
[1:15:09] thank God for every confirmation I thank
[1:15:12] God for every confirmation he's ever
[1:15:15] given why because it wasn't just
[1:15:17] something for the past
[1:15:19] it's things I can reach back
[1:15:21] and the spirit of paw will illuminate to
[1:15:23] my heart when I get to feeling down
[1:15:25] we're not kidding
[1:15:27] whoa hello my Moses without bring us the
[1:15:30] people out you shall serve me of this
[1:15:34] mountain it will be a token unto thee
[1:15:46] then the scripture we read in verse 8
[1:15:49] here right in the midst of don't notice
[1:15:51] where this is placed right in the midst
[1:15:55] after ten seven who thank you Jesus
[1:16:01] first samuel 10 8 come on now by time
[1:16:07] thou shalt go down before me to gilga
[1:16:10] and behold I will come down unto thee to
[1:16:13] offer burnt offerings had to sacrifice a
[1:16:16] sacrifices of peace offering seven days
[1:16:19] shalt thou tarry till I come to thee and
[1:16:22] shall be what thou shalt do Saul didn't
[1:16:29] fulfill this but the bride by His grace
[1:16:33] she knows it must be him it must be him
[1:16:37] perform his word in her life she does
[1:16:42] nothing until she has thus saith the
[1:16:47] Lord
[1:16:51] and it was so verson high and it was so
[1:16:58] that when he had turned his back to go
[1:17:01] from Samuel God gave him another heart
[1:17:04] and all those signs came to pass that
[1:17:09] day see it's God building this is child
[1:17:16] training he's building our faith this is
[1:17:20] where that Paul would mention here in
[1:17:22] the scriptures Hebrews 10:35 cast not
[1:17:26] away therefore your confidence which has
[1:17:28] great recompense of reward for ye have
[1:17:32] need of patience that after you have
[1:17:36] done the will of God you might receive
[1:17:38] the promise you can't receive the
[1:17:44] promise until you've done the will of
[1:17:46] God but when God makes known his will
[1:17:52] and you from your heart will obey that
[1:17:56] in your obedience your obedience to that
[1:17:59] word is that he will perform his word in
[1:18:04] my life you see this is one lesson that
[1:18:12] a man after God's own heart will obey
[1:18:15] God to the uttermost he'll wait to the
[1:18:20] last moment as a matter of fact by the
[1:18:24] people of the world and carnal minds
[1:18:26] he might be regarded as a one who
[1:18:31] procrastinates
[1:18:33] not a child of God a child of God is not
[1:18:37] procrastinating they're waiting on him
[1:18:43] the world can look at it how many times
[1:18:47] brother Ram will tell us speech the
[1:18:48] trumpets then he'll tell us in earlier
[1:18:49] parts of the message he said I know he
[1:18:52] said you might think and find this to be
[1:18:54] juvenile
[1:18:56] he said but he changed what I was gonna
[1:18:59] preach he said we just I just want to
[1:19:02] follow his leading something that
[1:19:06] stopped to be juvenile old god help us
[1:19:08] help us to truly be mature men and women
[1:19:12] and women charity has come were able to
[1:19:15] stand with simplicity like children man
[1:19:26] thinks God slow
[1:19:28] he's behind times where he's forgetful
[1:19:32] let me tell you something he ain't
[1:19:35] forgot you he ain't behind times he's
[1:19:40] right on time
[1:19:41] [Music]
[1:19:43] you take that promise in your heart and
[1:19:46] you nourish that promise you take that
[1:19:49] promise that's a seed and you water that
[1:19:52] with praise and worship but the second
[1:19:57] I'm waiting on it to come to pass
[1:19:58] that's your worship you'll continue to
[1:20:01] worship but in the meantime when that
[1:20:03] promise has been made and you can take
[1:20:06] it in your heart and if it's not there
[1:20:08] in the right place right now say Lord
[1:20:11] let it so down into my heart that I can
[1:20:14] go ahead and begin to call those things
[1:20:16] that are as though they be not and those
[1:20:19] things that are not as though they are
[1:20:21] let me go ahead I will Lord shut well
[1:20:25] I'm waiting
[1:20:27] [Applause]
[1:20:32] let me just read just a few a few
[1:20:35] scriptures here Isaiah 30 verse 15 for
[1:20:41] thus saith the Lord God the Holy One of
[1:20:42] Israel in returning and rest shall ye be
[1:20:46] saved in quietness and in confidence
[1:20:52] shall be your strength verse 18 of that
[1:20:56] same chapter and therefore will the Lord
[1:20:59] wait that he may be gracious
[1:21:05] therefore will the Lord wait that he may
[1:21:09] be gracious unto you you just ought to
[1:21:14] take that foot and kick that devil right
[1:21:16] out right now that for will the Lord
[1:21:23] wait the Lord will wait so that last
[1:21:27] moment Pharaoh's army has already come
[1:21:33] down let's just say standing between
[1:21:38] that the pillar fire here let's say
[1:21:42] there was a horse right there God showed
[1:21:47] himself gracious gracious the Lord will
[1:21:56] wait that he might show himself gracious
[1:22:02] and therefore will he be exalted that he
[1:22:06] may have mercy upon you for the Lord is
[1:22:09] a God of judgment blessed are all they
[1:22:12] that wait for him I could go on to
[1:22:18] another to some other scriptures but I
[1:22:20] want to read one here in lamentations 3
[1:22:23] the Lord is good unto them that wait for
[1:22:29] him to the soul that seek of him it is
[1:22:34] good that a man should both hope and
[1:22:37] quietly wait for the salvation of the
[1:22:39] Lord did you catch that in that opening
[1:22:42] verse wait for him and seek him that
[1:22:45] seems contrary it's not it's not
[1:22:50] remember as God is showing his world
[1:22:54] you're receiving of what he is making
[1:22:59] known things that you're praying about
[1:23:02] even in your life you're waiting but
[1:23:07] you're receiving you're taking in every
[1:23:11] little thing as he's showing you're
[1:23:13] taking it in what's happening you're
[1:23:15] being drawn drawn closer drawn deeper
[1:23:18] what is it it's you waiting for him
[1:23:21] you're waiting for him while receiving
[1:23:24] from your being made strong that you
[1:23:31] might wait and you're waiting that you
[1:23:35] might be further strengthened and you're
[1:23:37] further strengthened that you might wait
[1:23:39] and you ain't bet you might be further
[1:23:41] strengthened it is a cycle that's how
[1:23:46] the word comes forth
[1:23:47] it is a cycle hey man it's a word it
[1:23:53] showed underneath the Spirit of God he
[1:23:56] comes forth in the harvest and then we
[1:23:58] Bri grow we benefit of that word and
[1:24:00] then it's sowed back again and then
[1:24:03] there's a harvest and then it's sowed
[1:24:04] back again there's a harvest then it's
[1:24:07] sold back again there's a harvest now
[1:24:18] let me take just
[1:24:22] not so much maybe a little turn here but
[1:24:28] the word when you look Scofield will use
[1:24:34] this word above that passage it's a
[1:24:37] scriptural word that's used even over in
[1:24:39] the book of Colossians it's a word
[1:24:42] intrusion intrusion means to intrude
[1:24:50] probably could ask the school child here
[1:24:55] this morning what does it mean to
[1:24:57] intrude
[1:24:58] but they could probably tell you and to
[1:25:03] intrude means you're not been invited
[1:25:07] you've not been welcomed intrude means
[1:25:14] to put oneself deliberately you can't
[1:25:20] just put oneself deliberately into a
[1:25:25] place or situation where one is
[1:25:29] unwelcome or uninvited yep
[1:25:38] if you know you're really not gonna be
[1:25:40] welcome you know what I'm battling with
[1:25:42] my spirit already huh yeah you know what
[1:25:44] I
[1:25:44] I just stay I want to go
[1:25:52] let me qualify that don't you dare use
[1:25:56] that to miss coming the house of God
[1:25:59] then all right come to the house of God
[1:26:05] no God we have a confidence he's going
[1:26:10] to speak to my heart he knows me I'm the
[1:26:15] apple of his eye I'm not saying that
[1:26:20] proudly I'm saying that to know that he
[1:26:23] is mindful of every little detail
[1:26:26] whether a right walk wrong he is
[1:26:29] faithful yea though I walk through the
[1:26:33] valley of the shadow of death thou art
[1:26:35] with me hallelujah he's an ever-present
[1:26:41] help in the time of trouble mine eyes to
[1:26:52] the hills from whence cometh my help a
[1:26:57] messenger a rather coming to me who's
[1:27:00] engaged in battle there is a messenger
[1:27:03] that will engage with me to put oneself
[1:27:14] deliberately into a place or situation
[1:27:16] where one is unwelcome or invited so
[1:27:21] many places that we can venture into
[1:27:24] that here this morning but I just want
[1:27:28] to move forward here
[1:27:36] in Matthew 22
[1:27:43] verse eight
[1:27:46] here's a wedding supper that's been
[1:27:49] planned the Lord Jesus gives this
[1:27:52] parable first seven verses remember here
[1:27:58] it was first it was extended to Israel
[1:28:03] they were blinded they rejected it that
[1:28:12] we might receive mercy but if I could
[1:28:17] shout it and smile and say don't worry
[1:28:20] Israel your times coming Caribbean God
[1:28:36] we love her but this intrusion
[1:28:48] well the joy this is totally contrary to
[1:28:50] the kingdom of God it's contrary it's
[1:28:56] contrary to even how God deals with our
[1:28:59] life remember intrusion is for one to
[1:29:04] put oneself deliberately into one place
[1:29:11] they might know it's the right place but
[1:29:13] they're putting themselves there
[1:29:17] you understand what that means that
[1:29:19] means your strength your effort this is
[1:29:25] what intrusion your effort yourself
[1:29:28] whatever do you do or I do in South we
[1:29:34] will have to maintain it whatsoever the
[1:29:39] Lord do us no man as no man taketh away
[1:29:44] you go on and on in Ecclesiastes but
[1:29:47] what's this
[1:29:49] Ben he said to his servants the wedding
[1:29:51] is ready but they which were bidden were
[1:29:54] not worthy go you therefore into the
[1:29:58] highways and as many as ye find bid to
[1:30:03] the marriage this is a welcoming this is
[1:30:08] an invitation not intrusion so those
[1:30:15] servants went out into the highways and
[1:30:17] gathered together as many as they found
[1:30:20] both bad and good
[1:30:25] he didn't matter bad or good come he can
[1:30:32] take care of your badness and he'll take
[1:30:35] care of your goodness hallelujah
[1:30:40] His goodness overshadows your badness
[1:30:43] and his awesomeness overshadows your
[1:30:47] goodness
[1:30:51] welcome an or good bring them Lord you
[1:30:56] don't know about on their life no but
[1:30:58] there is a history but it's not this
[1:31:00] history an earthly time but it is that
[1:31:04] which was written in my mind in my book
[1:31:08] I know that him tell him to come can you
[1:31:15] imagine
[1:31:15] here we were do we feel worthy we don't
[1:31:19] feel worthy Lord not me for me yeah he
[1:31:30] comes over he drops a little note by
[1:31:33] your way it's like a handful of meal
[1:31:39] [Applause]
[1:31:44] sent an invitation to me he sent one to
[1:31:48] you this this message of the wedding
[1:31:52] supper is preached to all but it has
[1:31:55] personal meaning we're not intruding
[1:32:04] we've just received of His grace and the
[1:32:10] wedding was furnished with guests and
[1:32:12] when the king came in to see the guests
[1:32:15] he saw there a man which had not an on a
[1:32:19] wedding garment and he said unto Him
[1:32:24] friend see Jesus knew this man but he
[1:32:31] didn't know this man
[1:32:33] he was a church member friend he was
[1:32:38] around the cause of the wedding feast he
[1:32:44] was a friend listen if I was known to
[1:32:48] you as an enemy you tell your family
[1:32:50] watch out for that guy you can't trust
[1:32:52] him you watch everything around him
[1:32:56] because why you wouldn't know me and
[1:32:57] your family would be labeled to me an
[1:33:00] enemy this man was called by Jesus a
[1:33:03] friend he knew Jesus as a friend
[1:33:10] let me tell you something he wants to be
[1:33:14] more than your friend he wants to be
[1:33:18] your lover he wants to be your husband
[1:33:21] he wants to be your everything
[1:33:25] [Applause]
[1:33:27] friends is okay friends are alright but
[1:33:32] there's a deeper relationship than just
[1:33:34] friends
[1:33:35] Jesus himself the progression with the
[1:33:38] disciples servants friends brethren
[1:33:42] after the resurrection friends are
[1:33:46] privileged to hear certain things but
[1:33:49] brethren are there in the house
[1:33:54] sons daughters born in the house of God
[1:34:00] having the wedding garment on that
[1:34:02] wedding garment the baptism of the Holy
[1:34:04] Ghost not a church garment not something
[1:34:07] you can put on Sunday morning and take
[1:34:09] off
[1:34:10] no religion Calvary never gave us
[1:34:14] religion Calvary came the sacrifice was
[1:34:19] made the land was led by the spirit to
[1:34:24] the slaughter why that through the
[1:34:26] sacrifice where the enemy had besieged
[1:34:29] God's people all we were under
[1:34:33] besiegement but there was a dove member
[1:34:43] rose and send that up to glory and the
[1:34:47] devil of the Holy Ghost came back into
[1:34:50] the camp of the Living God and that dad
[1:34:53] was screaming with blood on its wings Oh
[1:34:56] is forgiven
[1:34:59] the sin debt is paid barley grass you
[1:35:04] can walk free
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:11] we're not intruders this man look what
[1:35:18] happened to him he asked him a simple
[1:35:22] question where's your wedding garment
[1:35:26] well Lord you know you don't believe the
[1:35:31] message Lord well you don't read the
[1:35:33] Bible you know I believe your word Lord
[1:35:39] he didn't ask him whether he read the
[1:35:42] Bible he didn't ask him whether he
[1:35:45] believed the message the wedding garment
[1:35:49] will speak on behalf if he's a believer
[1:35:56] understand his life speaks
[1:36:06] here's what happened to him then said
[1:36:11] the King to the servants bind him hand
[1:36:14] and foot
[1:36:15] oh no this cannot be the loving sweet
[1:36:21] Lord Jesus that would look upon this man
[1:36:26] and say bind him hand and feet there
[1:36:38] were those in that wedding supper that
[1:36:40] had an invitation and they accepted this
[1:36:45] man had an invitation but he refused it
[1:36:48] and he wanted his way and so because she
[1:36:53] chose his way he's identified as an
[1:36:57] intruder then if they leave on the Lord
[1:37:01] Jesus Christ he did did he believe that
[1:37:03] the Bible is true he did what's getting
[1:37:07] tight but the difference was he didn't
[1:37:11] have the wedding garment on the wedding
[1:37:16] garment was a display that you have
[1:37:21] received my way to the believersí this
[1:37:32] is contrary to the nature of the Holy
[1:37:34] Ghost our our outside behavior see this
[1:37:41] is where the battle comes the creation
[1:37:45] of time to wait on the Lord the outer
[1:37:50] man look I gotta had this remember the
[1:37:54] simplicity we were looking at with salt
[1:37:57] all those verses of Scripture that I
[1:38:00] read thereof saw find me one of those
[1:38:02] verses except one where it says the
[1:38:05] Spirit of the Lord came on it show me
[1:38:06] one of those verses where it had
[1:38:09] anything to do with feeling and had
[1:38:13] everything to do with him seeing the
[1:38:16] word come to pass what would have been
[1:38:20] discarded that's the word it was for saw
[1:38:24] it was for saw I think of this here look
[1:38:29] at this for a moment think of what the
[1:38:31] Lord Jesus says come unto me all you men
[1:38:37] are heavy
[1:38:38] late and I will give you rest for your
[1:38:42] souls I will take away your
[1:38:46] self-righteousness and I will give you a
[1:38:50] peace that passes all understanding he
[1:38:56] made known to us as we come under his
[1:39:00] leadership in 1st Peter chapter 2 as we
[1:39:03] move under his leadership and grace and
[1:39:07] the attributes moving in our life an
[1:39:10] entrance will be ministered unto you Eve
[1:39:19] intruded into a place she was uninvited
[1:39:26] it was a promise but she had not
[1:39:29] received the invitation into that
[1:39:33] promise yet as far as the way being
[1:39:37] opened you agree with me but what
[1:39:41] happened is she intruded
[1:39:49] sorry i intruded but sara submitted
[1:40:02] sorry i intruded but sara once she was
[1:40:09] changed she submitted she submitted no
[1:40:15] longer intruding she's receiving what

[1:40:22] not an intruder Esther was invited
[1:40:27] Rebecca was not an intruder she was
[1:40:31] invited I'll tell you right now there's
[1:40:36] a greater invitation offered right here
[1:40:37] this morning
[1:40:39] then if the President or any of the
[1:40:41] heads of state would offer you to come
[1:40:43] set at breakfast lunch or dinner with
[1:40:45] them because their kingdoms will fade
[1:40:47] and pass away they can make all sorts of
[1:40:49] promises they might be able to write
[1:40:51] them in with their pen wait till the
[1:40:53] next one gets in he'll open up folders
[1:40:55] and write things his own way or her way

[1:41:00] talking about here this morning you want
[1:41:03] this wedding garment it don't matter how

[1:41:28] woman at the well she stands and as far
[1:41:30] as in her outer garments of herself
[1:41:34] she came to the well at a different time
[1:41:37] than all the rest of the women did
[1:41:47] but that day he had wrote her into his
[1:41:51] appointment book before the foundation
[1:41:57] of the world he made that appointment
[1:42:00] and Jesus keeps all his appointments

[1:43:36] talking to her he said if thou knewest
[1:43:40] the gift of God he weren't talking about
[1:43:44] a ministerial gift he's talking about
[1:43:46] eternal life if thou knewest the gift of
[1:43:49] God you can't earn a gift you can't earn
[1:43:52] this you can't be good enough to have
[1:43:55] this call whether they're good or bad or

[1:44:55] do was come in line with the age
[1:44:58] Lord who was present her need was met
[1:45:06] God and His grace would work to bring us
[1:45:10] in line in harmony you know who was
[1:45:18] talking to you they know the gift of God
[1:45:20] you would say you would say to me give
[1:45:28] me water
[1:45:30] give me drink you would lay down your
[1:45:35] bucket of all your efforts all your
[1:45:38] doings and you would do what I am
[1:45:41] unfolding to you that you might have
[1:45:44] everlasting life everlasting life is not
[1:45:53] just a confession from your mouth it is
[1:45:57] a reality by the person of eternal life
[1:46:01] himself coming in and making his
[1:46:06] personal self known to you that you were
[1:46:11] included in this Paul said like this in
[1:46:22] visions to hate for by grace are you
[1:46:24] saved through faith and then not of
[1:46:26] yourselves it is the gift of God it's
[1:46:33] given you're not intruding you're
[1:46:35] invited Acts chapter 2 verse 37 when
[1:46:40] they heard this they were pricked in
[1:46:44] their heart and they said to Peter and
[1:46:46] to the rest of the Apostles men and
[1:46:48] brethren what shall we
[1:46:52] do
[1:47:01] they couldn't have asked what shall we
[1:47:03] do unless their heart had been pricked
[1:47:06] first what's what Peter says Peter said
[1:47:14] go and join a church let it be one where
[1:47:22] people are friendly that's nice we
[1:47:24] welcome that
[1:47:25] let it be where people are happy that's
[1:47:27] nice we welcome that that's not what he
[1:47:30] said because there has to come the whole
[1:47:35] emphasis of Calvary is that through the
[1:47:38] sacrifice where the lamb was led by the
[1:47:43] devil that we might receive our sight
[1:47:51] repent I've always believed on God but
[1:47:56] have you repented well I've been a good
[1:47:59] boy a good girl but have you repented
[1:48:01] because I don't care how good you've
[1:48:03] been you first must repent we were born
[1:48:06] in sin shape and iniquity you and I
[1:48:10] didn't ask to come that way that is a
[1:48:12] product of intruding into the will of
[1:48:15] God but God came down he didn't intrude
[1:48:18] he made himself a body that he might
[1:48:24] come into and then through that life
[1:48:29] invite you and I invite you and I back
[1:48:36] into his divine will repent
[1:48:46] I know that's a foreign word nowadays
[1:48:49] but it's the gospel if you don't repent
[1:48:54] you're not getting the first-base repent
[1:48:58] means that you recognize you are a
[1:49:00] sinner what I've been raised in church
[1:49:03] all my life I never said a bad word
[1:49:05] never did this and never did that I
[1:49:07] never did that your first birth condemns
[1:49:10] you I don't care if you were known as
[1:49:13] teacher's pet and goody two-shoes you
[1:49:16] must repent I don't care if you kept all
[1:49:20] the commandments you must repent I don't
[1:49:24] care if you know every doctrine the
[1:49:25] message you must repent this is the way
[1:49:32] of imitation repent means Lord I am a
[1:49:37] rich sinner we're saying I know about
[1:49:42] God I think this guy here we talked
[1:49:45] about with the wedding lack of wedding
[1:49:47] garment he not had you beat he was a
[1:49:49] friend
[1:49:50] he didn't just know about God he was a
[1:49:52] friend I'm not mad at you I'm trying to
[1:50:04] bother hunch and the Holy Ghost
[1:50:06] set forth the way repent and and be
[1:50:14] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:50:20] the remission of your sins I was
[1:50:24] baptized in the name of Father Son and
[1:50:26] Holy Ghost that's not what he said well
[1:50:30] that's what the church taught that's
[1:50:31] intrusion not invitation
[1:50:35] the Trinity doctrine is not the divine
[1:50:38] invitation set forth by the divine
[1:50:41] Commission of the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[1:50:45] an intrusion but the revelation of the
[1:50:51] name of Jesus Christ is an invitation no
[1:50:54] other name under heaven given whereby
[1:50:57] men might be saved
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:02] whosoever calls on the name of the Lord
[1:51:05] shall be saved
[1:51:09] invitation don't have to fight pearl in
[1:51:13] true chewing notes an invitation repent
[1:51:17] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:51:20] Christ it goes together I said it goes
[1:51:24] together if you say I've repented and
[1:51:28] you haven't walked into the waters of
[1:51:29] baptism you have not followed the
[1:51:32] Scriptures repent and be baptized in the
[1:51:39] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:51:42] remission of your sins and ye shall
[1:51:51] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the
[1:51:58] understand you shall receive the gift of
[1:52:03] the Holy Ghost
[1:52:05] once you've done what he said dude and
[1:52:09] he moved on your heart to ask what must
[1:52:13] I do if you're coming here and you don't
[1:52:20] feel that way you better pray you better
[1:52:23] say lord help me and move on my heart
[1:52:27] coming to church friends only lasts so
[1:52:30] long if you don't have a real solid
[1:52:32] experience with God this becomes no more
[1:52:35] to you than a mere social club but I'm
[1:52:38] telling you this ain't no social club
[1:52:39] I'm coming here to get myself ready
[1:52:42] to leave this world I want to be ready I
[1:52:45] want to be in every moment for him to
[1:52:48] move well you're just a nut you're
[1:52:53] you're crazy no I'm a believer I hear
[1:53:01] that invitation of what it is for me to
[1:53:04] be set free and you shall receive the
[1:53:08] gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise
[1:53:12] is unto you at the set time I will come
[1:53:19] and when I come I will show thee you
[1:53:24] receive eyesight when I am come
[1:53:29] no wonder David could say in the coming
[1:53:32] of the Lord in Psalms 27 the chapter of
[1:53:35] the rapture now has hidden me in the
[1:53:41] secret of his tabernacle it is pavilion
[1:53:46] now hath he have he he set me up on a
[1:53:51] rock and now shall mine head be lifted
[1:53:56] up above my enemies the first scriptures
[1:54:02] in that chapter
[1:54:04] David's aware of what's all around him
[1:54:08] he's surrounded
[1:54:11] he's encompassed just like at this hour
[1:54:16] all the demon powers surrounding the
[1:54:19] bride just like all men will be gathered
[1:54:22] against Jerusalem surrounded but I am in
[1:54:29] the midst of thee
[1:54:31] [Applause]
[1:54:33] and now shaaban head be lifted up above
[1:54:37] thine enemies
[1:54:49] for by one spirit
[1:54:53] are we all
[1:54:55] baptized into one body scripture read
[1:55:04] before this and acts to you repent
[1:55:07] you're baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:55:11] Jesus Christ let me just qualify this
[1:55:14] there's people sometimes that I've
[1:55:16] stopped that's come here I want to talk
[1:55:20] to him you want to be baptized in the
[1:55:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ why you
[1:55:26] say why would you do that
[1:55:27] because I want them to understand this
[1:55:29] is not Roman Catholicism I want you to
[1:55:35] understand what this means that you
[1:55:38] recognize yourself as a sinner and I
[1:55:42] recognize him that he is my atonement he
[1:55:47] is my lamb I want to be identified with
[1:55:53] his death and be identified in his
[1:55:57] resurrection I want to lose my identity
[1:56:01] and be identified with him now
[1:56:13] when the brothers whether myself or
[1:56:16] other brothers are helped doing the
[1:56:17] baptism you come up here and you step
[1:56:20] down into this tank you're standing
[1:56:23] there
[1:56:27] you can't baptize yourself you come
[1:56:33] there and the brothers will tell you
[1:56:36] times ii maybe they want take a
[1:56:38] handkerchief and just try to cover your
[1:56:40] nose so the water i'm not going to be
[1:56:41] your nose but they'll kind of tell you
[1:56:42] how to what they're trying to do is make
[1:56:45] sure that they've got you in a position
[1:56:46] that they don't drop you but they're
[1:56:50] going to bury you and when you're
[1:56:53] standing there in that tank you
[1:56:57] completely when you feel their hands
[1:57:00] come up and you hear the prayer that's
[1:57:08] been requested feel them Lord with the
[1:57:12] Holy Ghost and then you hear that we ask
[1:57:20] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:57:29] have their hands here you are your
[1:57:35] weight is in their hands
[1:57:40] they take you and submerge you and they
[1:57:46] bring you back up in the name of the
[1:57:51] Lord Jesus Christ and just as it takes
[1:57:55] what we're able to do in following the
[1:57:58] word where we can take and bury you in
[1:58:02] the water but he himself is the one who
[1:58:07] baptizes you into himself and it's the
[1:58:12] same way where you let go of yourself
[1:58:18] and say I'm completely in your hands and
[1:58:28] he takes you down in him and you come up
[1:58:32] still in him your life isn't shrouded in
[1:58:40] the invitation well he has bid you to
[1:58:44] come and you realize like Esther I'm not
[1:58:48] an intruder this is my husband's house
[1:59:00] Heyman's made some awful accusations but
[1:59:04] I've received encouragement through the
[1:59:06] word of the Lord that reminds me of my
[1:59:09] position and who I am and where I'm
[1:59:12] standing where I've been divinely placed
[1:59:14] not because I was worthy but where I am
[1:59:17] placed by him to come before his
[1:59:23] presence
[1:59:26] boldly with confidence as Paul would say
[1:59:32] by the new and living way into the
[1:59:37] holiest of holies he made a way through
[1:59:43] his blood cell wouldn't it be a shame if
[1:59:48] you come to church and you would come to
[1:59:51] church but you never came in here all
[1:59:54] you did you came and maybe you set back
[1:59:57] there in the conference room
[1:59:59] maybe you came in you set right there
[2:00:02] and right there in that foyer

[2:00:16] of church well I I didn't go in the
[2:00:18] sanctuary but I went to the building the
[2:00:23] church but what would you stay out why
[2:00:29] would you stay out well listen I can
[2:00:32] hear it just as good out there but all
[2:00:35] what it means to be in here you can hear
[2:00:41] it out there but you hearing it out

[2:01:58] to encourage him if you're going to
[2:02:00] Cleveland or you're going to Toledo you
[2:02:02] don't go blindly most of us hope our
[2:02:07] phones get it right but you look for
[2:02:11] signs even with your phone and your GPS

[2:02:50] you trade it this morning why don't you
[2:02:53] let God take this word and make it a
[2:02:56] life to you I mean where it's something
[2:03:01] that it's a life to you he's alive in
[2:03:05] your life
[2:03:09] it's a sacrifice to make if we can go
[2:03:16] back to this altar right here and I am
[2:03:18] closing your stand saw it's waiting
[2:03:32] oh no that's an orange car they do have
[2:03:33] a blue car I'm certain my pullet that's
[2:03:38] it the neighbor's house
[2:03:41] Sol's pacing he's pacing looks like he's
[2:03:47] waiting doesn't it he's pacing he's
[2:03:51] getting more nervous more anxious every
[2:03:55] moment the Simon he's waiting no no
[2:03:59] remember when you wait for him you seek
[2:04:02] after him
[2:04:06] what if Saul would have been there
[2:04:08] saying Lord I know Sam is gonna be here
[2:04:14] because he's your mouthpiece he's the
[2:04:18] one that is ordained to offer up this
[2:04:21] sacrifice for the RAM tells us samuel
[2:04:23] was a type of the Holy Ghost the Holy
[2:04:24] Ghost is the one who takes the word and
[2:04:26] shows it to you and I I know he's going
[2:04:28] to show up and Lord you know I remember
[2:04:33] one day right there after I was anointed
[2:04:37] you know Lord I remember when Samuel
[2:04:40] told me that I would run into a couple
[2:04:43] men he told me what they'd be carrying
[2:04:45] told me what they would dress like told
[2:04:47] me even what they'd say to me Lord it'd
[2:04:50] happened right on the dot Lord I didn't
[2:04:53] even have to try to make them stand in a
[2:04:55] place the handkerchief was there the
[2:04:57] glasses were there they were sitting in
[2:04:59] the rocking chair it was right there
[2:05:00] just like you said every detail was in
[2:05:04] place boy he too got on that one whose
[2:05:07] glory to God I feel his presence right
[2:05:10] now
[2:05:10] Saul and Lord I remember after that you
[2:05:13] told me to go up to the hill of God when
[2:05:15] I'd be going up to the hill of God
[2:05:16] there'd be some prophets come down one
[2:05:18] became this one be carrying that glory
[2:05:20] to God it happened just like you said
[2:05:23] but Samuel what in the world would he do
[2:05:25] the same thing I do and the same thing
[2:05:28] you do encourage myself in the word of
[2:05:32] the Lord
[2:05:35] sure there's times we quote promises
[2:05:38] that come to our hearts but there's
[2:05:39] other times the rehearsal is the word of
[2:05:42] God coming to pass in our life and we
[2:05:46] rehearse his faithfulness in the midst
[2:05:49] of that time about that time what's
[2:05:51] happening what's happening at that time
[2:05:52] what's kind of like Samson their muscles
[2:05:55] start to grow them LOX is starting to
[2:05:57] grow out that covenant starting to grow
[2:06:00] out and how you until you're starting to
[2:06:01] get energized right there while you're
[2:06:03] waiting on the sacrifice while the whole
[2:06:05] time you're doing that waiting on him
[2:06:08] you're the one becoming the sacrifice
[2:06:12] you're sacrificing your own will by
[2:06:18] choosing to focus on him who provides
[2:06:23] for himself
[2:06:26] you see God we're coming to a time of
[2:06:29] the year you all know this we're coming
[2:06:31] to a time of the year where there will
[2:06:33] be flowers Easter flowers behind on the
[2:06:37] altars when I used to work for a
[2:06:40] greenhouse and we would deliver Easter
[2:06:43] lilies I would have to ride in a panel
[2:06:45] van then things shoved back in there
[2:06:47] only so high and you get that pollen on
[2:06:49] your nose pollen on your jacket pollen
[2:06:51] all over your self and you're carrying
[2:06:53] them into these big old churches and
[2:06:55] sometimes in churches scared me to death
[2:06:57] when I walk in them they were dark and
[2:06:59] kind of spooky looking I'm not saying
[2:07:01] that to be mean I'm just I'm just
[2:07:02] telling the truth I don't know who's
[2:07:03] gonna pop out of that you know and I'm
[2:07:05] carrying those things up there
[2:07:09] but God don't want flowers he don't want
[2:07:14] all the beautiful things that you can do
[2:07:18] he wants you the altar was made for you
[2:07:24] through his altar he made way that we
[2:07:29] could come to the altar of
[2:07:33] self-sacrifice self-denial let me read
[2:07:39] this to you
[2:07:40] he said warm up to God come back to him
[2:07:44] throw your heart out to him he said I
[2:07:47] was reading a sermon the other night my
[2:07:49] sister brown down here at the conference
[2:07:52] center and how she preached Calvary Road
[2:07:53] a road of sacrifice I hope that's all
[2:07:55] right to say that what a masterpiece of
[2:07:58] a sermon that was what people need today
[2:08:03] is get back on that self-sacrifice lay
[2:08:08] your all lay your all on the altar and
[2:08:11] forget who you are but the son of God or
[2:08:16] the daughter of God walk forward claim

[2:09:22] greatest compliment is to take him at

[2:13:47] garment Lord to come you are provided
[2:13:51] Ward has ever had his bow let me just
[2:13:56] speak to you moment believing is a
[2:13:59] wonderful thing and the scripture said
[2:14:03] whosoever cometh to God must believe
[2:14:05] that he is you see the Living God will
[2:14:11] make himself known as the Living God
[2:14:13] that he's not the god of history that is
[2:14:18] the I am and his speak directly to your
[2:14:23] heart he'll deal with your life letting
[2:14:26] you know things that that you know that
[2:14:32] it took more than natural measures this
[2:14:37] is God
[2:14:39] and in his mercy he will move in that
[2:14:43] manner to stir up faith to believe that
[2:14:50] he is believing is a wonderful thing
[2:14:56] you must believe but let me encourage
[2:14:59] you this morning you've got to go
[2:15:03] further to believe and walk in his word
[2:15:11] of what he would ask of you to believe
[2:15:17] that he is my sacrifice he is my Savior
[2:15:25] you must believe but in your believing
[2:15:32] you must repent
[2:15:37] you must be baptized in the name of the
[2:15:41] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:15:45] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:15:49] Holy Ghost
[2:15:50] that's your promise you see the first
[2:15:53] two you repent
[2:15:55] that's willingness that's surrender and
[2:15:58] then you being baptized
[2:16:00] it's you surrendering hands come and
[2:16:04] take hold of you and they bury you or
[2:16:08] place you submerse you in this water
[2:16:13] representative of a grave and they raise
[2:16:18] you back up identified with your
[2:16:23] sacrifice in his death to be identified
[2:16:27] in his resurrection and then he the Holy
[2:16:31] Ghost comes and he baptizes you in to
[2:16:38] the body not not a church not a building
[2:16:43] not a gathering but in himself I wonder
[2:16:50] as every head is bowed here this morning
[2:16:52] I wonder if there be one you'd be
[2:16:55] willing to stand to your feet you'd be
[2:16:58] willing to say Lord
[2:17:01] I want to do what you are asking me to
[2:17:05] do
[2:17:08] you'd be willing to make that stand for
[2:17:13] the Lord Jesus Christ as he stood for
[2:17:16] you I'm willing to lay my life on the
[2:17:22] altar I'm willing to become sacrifice
[2:17:32] [Music]
[2:17:34] oh ma
[2:17:39] friends I'm not going to scare you and I
[2:17:41] don't mean to scare you but his mercy
[2:17:43] his spirit won't strive always with men
[2:17:50] the same Lord God that it had me to
[2:17:53] speak this this morning it's the same
[2:17:54] Lord God that's been dealing with your
[2:17:56] heart I'll tell you he can do for you
[2:18:00] what you never imagined possible he'll
[2:18:04] take you beyond the church life they'll
[2:18:08] take you into a living reality
[2:18:12] of his presence of who he is
[2:18:17] he'll give you our sight what you never
[2:18:21] had before oh god be merciful would
[2:18:29] there be one god bless you
[2:18:34] hallelujah god bless you dear Jesus
[2:18:41] I wonder this morning we're all here we
[2:18:48] stand we stand many times even in Our
[2:18:54] Lives maybe youth you've repented you've
[2:18:57] been baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:18:59] Christ let me tell you something if
[2:19:02] you've walked in that in faith I want
[2:19:05] you to know he made that promise with
[2:19:07] you in mind you shall receive the gift
[2:19:10] of the Holy Ghost
[2:19:12] he made that with you in mind he knew
[2:19:15] you'd want it and the reason you want it
[2:19:18] because it's a desire a longing for him
[2:19:23] nothing else in this world can satisfy
[2:19:29] god bless your hand any man he sees your
[2:19:32] heart you stand just like that on the
[2:19:38] scripture you know about living God that
[2:19:40] touched your heart you stand right there
[2:19:42] on that word you have need of patience
[2:19:46] that after you have done the will of God
[2:19:48] that you shall receive the promise
[2:19:54] I know I'm also speaking men and women
[2:20:02] sons and daughters lives that have
[2:20:06] already come into this new birth where I
[2:20:11] eyes have been opened her lives have
[2:20:14] been quickened maybe today you can you
[2:20:23] got needs in your life you got things
[2:20:26] that are sitting before you
[2:20:28] you got decisions to make
[2:20:33] you just say like if I just say it like
[2:20:36] this Lord help me to see the simplicity
[2:20:40] as you made yourself known to saw help
[2:20:44] me just to see the simplicity Lord Lord
[2:20:48] you know I love the supernatural and it
[2:20:49] was supernaturally how things were
[2:20:51] arranged how Samuel spoke it and how it
[2:20:53] was set how it was arranged the Lord God
[2:20:55] I realized even a greater supernatural
[2:20:57] part is for me to recognize you working
[2:21:00] in simplicity how many would say lord
[2:21:08] help me to be sensitive
[2:21:11] [Music]
[2:21:13] forgive me for my times of impatience
[2:21:16] and help me Lord luck the example was
[2:21:20] given of Saul if Saul would have just
[2:21:24] encouraged himself in the word of the
[2:21:28] Lord while he was waiting his pacing his
[2:21:34] pacing would have turned into footsteps
[2:21:38] of dancing he would have had joy because
[2:21:45] he would have been rehearsing what you
[2:21:49] are as you made yourself known to him
[2:21:53] Lord I ask Lord God for every heart Lord
[2:22:02] Jesus every hand that's been lifted the
[2:22:07] hearts behind it ask God that you would
[2:22:13] grant to him that petition that requests
[2:22:19] Lord that they've had on their heart
[2:22:22] Saul needed to find some animals Lord
[2:22:28] and you not only showed him and let him
[2:22:32] know where the animals would be and how
[2:22:35] that they were found but you pointed out
[2:22:40] along the way
[2:22:45] the different points of your word Lord
[2:22:50] Jesus I asked this morning may our eyes
[2:22:55] be open Lord in the simplicity Lord to
[2:23:00] see you in action to witness you working
[2:23:06] that this is you what God
[2:23:14] unlike saul we're gonna wait on you and
[2:23:23] seek for you we're gonna talk Lord of
[2:23:30] all your doings and what you've done
[2:23:34] Lord I asked this morning and for every
[2:23:39] one of these requests now for every
[2:23:42] heart Lord that's been lifted every hand
[2:23:45] Lord that's been lifted to say Lord

[2:31:41] Laura Vita God
[2:31:44] we're not intruders we've been invited
[2:31:50] invited attending attending bidden to
[2:31:58] come and he's opened up the way that we
[2:32:06] could come well we know the scripture
[2:32:10] says that we must press but that
[2:32:13] pressing to enter isn't pressing against
[2:32:16] God that pressing is against our own
[2:32:19] self it's going beyond the sound barrier
[2:32:23] of our own selves because of him because
[2:32:30] of him to be identified with him
[2:32:34] oh what a privilege to be invited in the
[2:32:39] presence of the king and to think of
[2:32:41] this this invitation here he is just
[2:32:46] like you come to my house or I come to
[2:32:47] yours if I come to your house I go up
[2:32:52] and I ring your doorbell right knock on
[2:32:54] your door that lets you know that I'm
[2:32:57] there that's what that does it let you
[2:33:00] know somebody's there so you go to the
[2:33:03] door
[2:33:04] you look out maybe the peephole or you
[2:33:06] look out the side lights for you look
[2:33:08] out the window up there you want to see
[2:33:09] who it is because you don't want to just
[2:33:12] let just anybody in but if you're
[2:33:18] expecting somebody you've invited him
[2:33:25] you're expecting and from your heart if
[2:33:32] your heart has been touched by his
[2:33:33] invitation or he is knocking at your
[2:33:38] heart and you're expecting he said
[2:33:44] whosoever heareth my voice and openeth
[2:33:51] open the door I will come into him same
[2:34:00] way he came in Sarah he promised he
[2:34:03] would come I will come unto Him and he
[2:34:10] will sup with me and I with him
[2:34:14] what could I serve him what could you
[2:34:18] serve Him it's his word coming to
[2:34:23] maturity submission in our lives and he
[2:34:31] is partaking of what his life is
[2:34:36] bringing forth in us
[2:34:41] what an invitation what an invitation
[2:34:47] we're not intruders we've been invited
[2:34:52] you see how God leaves this pattern down
[2:34:54] because he knows you and I are tempted
[2:34:57] and will be tempted to intrude not into
[2:35:03] that of what we've already been invited
[2:35:06] into and have already been received into
[2:35:09] but where things will come about in our
[2:35:11] lives who will be tempted to intrude but
[2:35:17] remember God invites us by making his
[2:35:23] word know
[2:35:26] he makes his will known every time we
[2:35:28] could go throughout this building here
[2:35:30] this morning if we said over there at
[2:35:32] the depot and fellowship there's things
[2:35:34] that you could testify in your own life
[2:35:36] where God has showed you and met with
[2:35:39] you from time to time and it's never
[2:35:42] been the same way each time
[2:35:46] yes that's God why why would he do it
[2:35:50] that way he wants us to depend on him
[2:35:55] [Music]
[2:35:59] I know this is simple but my prayer for
[2:36:02] my heart help me just to be sensitive
[2:36:05] and waiting but Simon how do i make
[2:36:11] myself sensitive just stay in him
[2:36:18] take the promises of what God has been
[2:36:21] doing in your life and rehearse that
[2:36:24] maybe or maybe you were one who is
[2:36:27] you're wanting the Holy Ghost
[2:36:31] you take the promises Lord
[2:36:33] you touched my word you're the one who's
[2:36:37] drawn my life you're the one who's
[2:36:40] watched over me Lord you want that
[2:36:43] preacher that yet with my heart it was
[2:36:44] you Lord nobody could know my life like
[2:36:47] that it's you that's answered prayers in
[2:36:50] my life Lord
[2:36:51] you see that's him personally making
[2:36:54] himself known to you he's given you
[2:36:56] ground that you can stand there and in
[2:36:59] the midst of that while you're waiting
[2:37:00] on the Holy Ghost to come you can stand
[2:37:06] there and encourage yourself in the word
[2:37:08] of the Lord
[2:37:10] [Music]
[2:37:12] God is faithful friends he's faithful
[2:37:16] many times we get impatient and because
[2:37:19] things don't happen the way we think
[2:37:20] they ought to happen we get impatient
[2:37:22] and we'll say he didn't answer prayer
[2:37:25] let me tell you something when you've
[2:37:27] stood on God's Word what takes place
[2:37:30] right here things can take place and
[2:37:34] bring a drop right down in your life
[2:37:36] right here the manifestation of it will
[2:37:38] take place you believe that
[2:37:44] he will he will declare his own works

[2:38:02] it all together for us this morning
