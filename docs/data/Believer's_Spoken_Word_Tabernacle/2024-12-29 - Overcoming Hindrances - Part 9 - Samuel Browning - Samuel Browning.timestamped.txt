[43:34] Christ amen and amen amen God bless you
[43:38] let's turn in the scriptures to John
[43:41] chapter
[43:42] 3 and I'm going to begin reading here in
[43:46] John 3 and verse
[43:49] three we
[43:50] were picking up on some of this um last
[43:56] week and I I want
[43:59] to just continue uh upon these upon
[44:03] those thoughts we've been looking at on
[44:05] overcoming
[44:06] hindrances and I want to continue to
[44:08] deal with that aspect today on that of
[44:11] the negative but really dealing with the
[44:13] positive that moves into our life and um
[44:17] you remember we've seen that last week
[44:20] um the picture a lot of us have seen
[44:23] what a negative is and then you've seen
[44:25] the picture that comes from the negative
[44:27] it's really hard if you look just at a
[44:30] negative to be able to see all the
[44:32] details but yet in order for there to be
[44:35] a negative there had to be a picture
[44:37] taken of something somewhere positive
[44:41] like you take a picture of an event or a
[44:44] family picture you had to be there and
[44:47] then when that picture is taken then
[44:49] there's a negative that is made from
[44:50] that we almost have to get out of the
[44:53] digital age for a moment to consider it
[44:54] because we're so used to snapping we've
[44:56] got pictures and submit them to
[44:58] Shutterfly Walmart and whatever more but
[45:00] yet when it still comes down to it
[45:02] believe it or not there are people who
[45:03] still take pictures and there are
[45:05] negatives that are processed in our
[45:08] lives that that negative that part from
[45:11] that positive that was taken that's what
[45:14] God placed in our life even as we come
[45:18] from our mother's womb as a seed of God
[45:21] and then the spirit of God begins to
[45:23] work on our life it brings us into that
[45:25] of birth but we're not fully developed
[45:29] you how many of you remember when they
[45:30] had the polaroid pictures remember that
[45:32] I thought that was the coolest thing in
[45:34] the world and I've seen where they kind
[45:36] of brought some retro things out last
[45:38] year you know around Christmas and man I
[45:40] thought that was great because you know
[45:41] why I didn't have no patience it didn't
[45:43] have to wait it just spit it out and
[45:45] then you know everybody been there
[45:46] Fanning you'd have them all laying on
[45:47] the table and you oh man oh and and
[45:51] that's really how our lives are as a
[45:55] Believer once the the Holy Spirit has
[45:58] brought the new birth in our life we're
[46:02] watching Christ appear in our lives and
[46:07] it's us no longer I that liveth but
[46:09] Christ that liveth in me so I want to
[46:11] read this scripture here out of John 3
[46:14] Jesus said ex Jesus said unto him to
[46:17] Nicodemus verily verily I say unto the
[46:19] except a man be born again he cannot see
[46:22] the kingdom of God and Nicodemus said
[46:25] unto him how can a man be born when he
[46:28] is old can he enter the second time into
[46:31] his mother's womb and be born and Jesus
[46:34] answered verily verily I say unto thee
[46:37] except a man be born of water and of the
[46:41] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[46:43] of God that which is born of the flesh
[46:47] is flesh and that which is born of the
[46:50] spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said
[46:53] unto thee ye must be born again
[46:57] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[46:59] thou hearest the sound thereof but can
[47:03] not tell whence it cometh and whether it
[47:06] goeth so is everyone that is born of the
[47:11] spirit amen may God bless you and bless
[47:13] the reading of the
[47:14] word as you're being
[47:16] seated I'd like
[47:18] to as I mentioned to you moments ago I'd
[47:21] like to uh just continue to speak on
[47:24] that thought of overcoming hindrances in
[47:27] our lives and one of the things that uh
[47:31] the Lord just so pressed on my heart
[47:32] some months ago is dealing with that
[47:34] thought on negative and it's very it can
[47:38] be sometimes depending on our makeup and
[47:41] even when sometimes even if we seem to
[47:43] be a very positive person there's a lot
[47:45] of things that can come around and
[47:47] sometimes that's very negative and
[47:49] sometimes we can catch ourselves and we
[47:51] begin to speak or think in a negative
[47:54] way and I think of it if if the the Holy
[47:57] Spirit would convict the prophet where
[47:59] he would be able to sit down with his
[48:01] wife and say the holy spirit is grieved
[48:03] within me because I've been thinking
[48:07] negatively then I think that God would
[48:10] would would give us the strength that
[48:12] would help us so that in our lives that
[48:15] it's not to say that we're never going
[48:17] to come into certain times because we're
[48:19] surrounded with negative this this
[48:21] entire body that we have it's it's
[48:23] negative but yet when God has come into
[48:26] our life that's the positive there can
[48:29] be a lot of positive things but friends
[48:31] it's just like with everything else in
[48:32] life it will quickly like James said
[48:35] even it'll corrupt it'll fade away but
[48:37] there's one thing that can never pass
[48:40] away and that's the word of God and
[48:43] that's why that it must be the word of
[48:45] God that comes into our life and that's
[48:48] where the new birth that's what it is
[48:50] the word working with our life dealing
[48:52] with our life bringing us to that place
[48:55] of a real TR True full conversion a real
[48:58] true birth and when the positive of
[49:01] God's own life has come in you know it
[49:04] it becomes so real like that of where
[49:06] you begin to see all around us and the
[49:09] things you know life itself and
[49:11] everything that surrounds it just even
[49:13] at its best brother Brown would say it
[49:15] reminds us of that garbage dump and
[49:17] where you can smell just you know things
[49:19] that decomposing you you see all of that
[49:21] around you see all of this life but
[49:23] there's one thing that moves within the
[49:25] heart of a Believer and and that is when
[49:27] God's own life has come on the inside of
[49:29] us then we're no longer looking just
[49:31] through that of Earthly eyes and we're
[49:33] no longer just confined to that of a
[49:36] negative by the first birth but through
[49:38] the new birth there has now come forth a
[49:41] real true positive and the only positive
[49:44] there is and that's God's word in our
[49:46] life and so with that with that in mind
[49:49] and and looking at the realities of God
[49:52] you know um a common term that we would
[49:55] you know hear about and think about is
[49:57] that of a paradox we can see many
[49:59] paradoxes down through the scriptures we
[50:01] think of that of the Red Sea you think
[50:03] of Noah and building the ark and even of
[50:06] Moses leading out you know the children
[50:08] of Israel and think of the crossing of
[50:10] the Jordan all of those things were
[50:12] great miraculous things and that's what
[50:14] a paradox is it's something that is
[50:16] absolutely incredible but it's true and
[50:20] and the real reality when we look at the
[50:22] even the latter part of this scripture
[50:25] where it speaks of the new birth and New
[50:26] Birth is not something that is actually
[50:30] can even be explained it must be
[50:34] experienced it is an experience that
[50:36] comes from God and I'm not I'm not just
[50:38] talking about there can be many
[50:40] experiences we can have many experiences
[50:43] in the presence of God but this
[50:45] experience is that where it goes down to
[50:48] the soul level and there is an absolute
[50:51] transformation in that life when the all
[50:54] where the things of the world have
[50:56] passed away and you say what do you mean
[50:59] by that it's where the very desire for
[51:01] the things of the world is no longer
[51:03] present but the desire is to live and to
[51:07] serve the Living God that in itself is a
[51:10] miracle the new birth itself is is not
[51:13] something that is schooled into our
[51:16] lives but it is a predestinated
[51:18] experience from the hand of God look all
[51:20] the way down through the scripture you
[51:22] will find that the that when each one
[51:24] had their personal encounter with God it
[51:27] was not a pre-planned event by man it
[51:30] was not something that was schooled into
[51:32] him but it was The Sovereign hand of God
[51:35] that would bring his children that he
[51:37] knew was here like he did with Moses at
[51:40] the burning bush like he did with Noah
[51:42] like he did all the way down through the
[51:44] scriptures all the way up to that of
[51:46] even of the upper room it was all God
[51:49] pre-planting that moment wherein by
[51:52] there would be a miracle that would take
[51:54] place and it is the greatest miracle
[51:57] that can ever happen to an individual
[51:59] you know a person could actually be
[52:01] healed I mean we've seen it I I've
[52:02] witnessed it where where lives that you
[52:05] know that have been able to walk that
[52:06] couldn't walk before that's a great
[52:08] miracle that's a tremendous thing and
[52:10] that is a wonderful reality for somebody
[52:13] who was not able to walk but then could
[52:15] get up and walk but you know if time
[52:17] terries you're either going to go by the
[52:19] way of the Grave or there can come to a
[52:22] time again where a different kind of
[52:24] sickness would hit that body that in it
[52:26] self is a miracle but this miracle where
[52:29] God comes down and changes the very
[52:32] nature of an individual transforms it by
[52:35] his power to match his word that is a
[52:39] miracle that not there's not a devil out
[52:42] of hell that can erase that miracle
[52:44] there's nothing in time that can ever
[52:47] stop that that becomes an eternal work
[52:50] of almighty God so now to think of this
[52:54] you know when we look at it this is why
[52:56] that you know when brother BR would say
[52:58] it like this he would say I believe that
[53:00] every Born Again member of the body of
[53:02] Christ is a paradox in themselves I
[53:05] believe each one of you Methodist
[53:06] Presbyterian Lutheran never had an
[53:08] experience or experiened the baptism of
[53:11] the Holy Spirit you were in some formal
[53:13] church that did not believe in the
[53:15] genuine New Birth and has now received
[53:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[53:20] perfect example of a paradox because
[53:23] something happened to you that changed
[53:26] changed your whole being and anyone
[53:29] could look at that and know what a
[53:31] paradox is it's a miracle and he said
[53:35] unless that happens you cannot be a
[53:38] Christian there must be a paradox for
[53:40] you to become a Christian because no one
[53:43] can change a spirit in a man and give
[53:46] him a new birth outside of God God Alone
[53:49] is the only one can do it and it's a
[53:51] miracle how that God can take a man's
[53:54] thinking his ways his life and
[53:56] everything and change it from what it
[53:59] was to what it can be what he can make
[54:02] it so we are not made we are not the new
[54:05] birth is not something that is
[54:07] manufactured by a
[54:09] church it the the you know a church b a
[54:13] church book has no power to change a man
[54:16] a Creed has no power to change a man
[54:19] this is why that when God would show
[54:22] himself to Zachariah and he would show
[54:24] him of the the lampstands he would show
[54:27] him and he would he would Express to him
[54:29] it's not by might nor by power but by my
[54:33] spirit sayeth the Lord I tell you
[54:36] friends that that that is exactly the
[54:38] new birth is not something that we have
[54:40] achieved when God has done such a work
[54:43] in our life it is not our achievement we
[54:46] cannot take one credit for it it is not
[54:49] something where we can ever say that we
[54:51] were seeking God if you ever had a
[54:53] desire to serve God it's because God put
[54:56] that desire within you and it was God
[55:00] that was calling out to that desire and
[55:03] it was not what we did it's what we
[55:06] surrendered ourselves
[55:07] to and that never never ceases in our
[55:12] lives even to that of the consummation
[55:15] of the body change will be a
[55:18] surrendering to the will of God so I
[55:21] want to just say say it in this way when
[55:23] the New Birth has come it's the
[55:25] beginning of Miracles because in order
[55:29] for you to believe in miracles you first
[55:32] must become a miracle and the greatest
[55:36] Miracle is when God can take a life that
[55:39] all everything through Society you can
[55:41] pass them through reformatories you can
[55:44] pass them through AA and everything else
[55:46] but you let them get in the presence of
[55:49] God and when they get in the presence of
[55:51] almighty God and God begins to speak to
[55:54] their heart and melt away everything
[55:58] every excuse and every fear and every
[56:01] doubt and every trepidation the raise of
[56:05] his word will melt it away and God moves
[56:08] down and he brings a complete
[56:10] transformation in that life I tell you
[56:13] that's a miracle and it is the beginning
[56:16] of
[56:18] Miracles you hearing me now it's the
[56:21] beginning of Miracles notice the
[56:23] scripture said wherefore Paul said
[56:25] henceforth know we no man after the
[56:28] flesh yay though we have known Christ
[56:32] after the flesh yet now henceforth know
[56:35] we him no more therefore If any man be
[56:40] in Christ he is a new creature old
[56:44] things are passed away behold all things
[56:48] are become new you know if I paused the
[56:51] service and ran back to the back and got
[56:53] the clothes that I had back there for
[56:55] after I'm finish preaching and I go back
[56:57] there I put those clothes on and I come
[57:00] up here and I step back in the pull pit
[57:02] I'm still the same person I'm just
[57:04] wearing a different outfit of clothes is
[57:07] that right but you see God doesn't want
[57:10] to change the outside that'll come but
[57:13] what God wants to do is not so much it's
[57:16] not a new coat but or or or a new a new
[57:19] coat but God wants to change the person
[57:21] on the inside because when God brings a
[57:25] change down on the inside side that
[57:27] power that Miracle will work its way out
[57:31] in our life and it will show from the
[57:34] inside to the outside that a miracle has
[57:38] taken
[57:39] place is that right it will show that it
[57:42] will display that now remember you know
[57:45] even with the even when you take uh uh
[57:47] uh trees and oak trees and things like
[57:49] that some of the oak trees 30 years
[57:52] before you ever start having you know
[57:53] acorns coming out the sorero C I when I
[57:56] was out there in Arizona just you know
[57:58] maybe now a few months ago and looking
[58:00] at when an arm comes out one arm speaks
[58:03] that it's least been there for 50 years
[58:06] before it'll ever come out and you see
[58:08] these different things even in nature
[58:10] that will testify of how that life and
[58:13] the struggle you know and the growing
[58:16] that takes place but there is a season
[58:18] for everything and that's how it is
[58:21] within the life and the walk of a
[58:23] Believer just as our life and experience
[58:27] of the New Birth has come from the hand
[58:29] of God it's the same way when our lives
[58:32] are surrendered to God God will bring
[58:35] forth himself through our lives so every
[58:39] he's a new creature you know it's the
[58:41] same it's the same uh you know in the
[58:44] same house you know it's just like when
[58:46] others if they're able to recognize you
[58:48] from high school and maybe some of you
[58:49] still got your hair and everything else
[58:51] and maybe you look a lot like your
[58:53] yearbook and people can say hey someone
[58:56] but you know what when when if there's
[58:58] become a change in that person's life I
[59:00] I remember how God God did in my life
[59:03] there could be a lot of things that many
[59:04] people had remembrances of what Sam
[59:07] Browning used to be but when just that
[59:10] moment and then even me testifying and
[59:13] then God testifying through year after
[59:16] year after year it was not something
[59:18] that I had to make but it was a
[59:21] transformation that had happened in my
[59:23] life they recognized the same old t Le
[59:26] but there was new
[59:28] ownership on the
[59:30] inside it's the creative life notice who
[59:34] else can do that it takes the same
[59:36] presence of God that brewed in the
[59:39] beginning there in Genesis 1 to bring
[59:41] forth out of our own lives notice the
[59:43] prophet says it like this in the
[59:45] uncertain sound he talks about that
[59:47] button remember that from last week the
[59:48] little button I talked about he's
[59:50] referring to like a button and he refers
[59:51] to it over and over like a button that's
[59:53] on your shirt when the Holy Ghost has
[59:55] come into a person's life when a man
[59:57] saved that much of him is God that's the
[1:00:01] little light that comes into him to make
[1:00:04] him quit doing what's wrong now if you
[1:00:07] can notice these words if you can take
[1:00:10] all the malice and envy and strife and
[1:00:14] unbelief out you might say how in the
[1:00:16] world could there still be envy how in
[1:00:18] the world could there still be malice
[1:00:20] how could there still be any of those
[1:00:21] things because it's not on the soul
[1:00:23] level when the spirit of God is coming
[1:00:26] down it actually brings such a
[1:00:28] transformation on the inside of that
[1:00:30] soul and then through that God equips us
[1:00:34] as a son and daughter of God and the
[1:00:36] spirit of God working in our lives and
[1:00:39] our heart to actually clean out in our
[1:00:42] heart baggage that's been accumulated
[1:00:45] whether it's through experiences whether
[1:00:47] it's through things of raising
[1:00:49] experiences we've had here uh you know
[1:00:51] something has happened to us as a child
[1:00:53] but the spirit of God there is no
[1:00:55] greater healing in agent than the holy
[1:00:57] spirit because healing does not come
[1:01:00] from the outside in healing comes from
[1:01:02] the inside out is that right when the
[1:01:06] fountains were all polluted and they
[1:01:08] were bitter around that City what did
[1:01:10] Elisha ask for he said bring me a new
[1:01:13] Cru in other words I don't want the same
[1:01:16] old Cru that you've been using bring me
[1:01:18] a new Cru with salt in it and God gave a
[1:01:23] real true Revelation straight from from
[1:01:26] the Throne of God and when that is
[1:01:28] placed in the mouth of those fountains
[1:01:31] out of it is
[1:01:33] sweetened yes sir that's the same thing
[1:01:36] in our lives but notice here's here's
[1:01:37] the key if you can take all the malice
[1:01:41] and envy and strife and unbelief out now
[1:01:45] it isn't God leaving us alone but he'll
[1:01:48] deal with
[1:01:49] us you know you couldn't even know that
[1:01:51] you had something in this way if he
[1:01:54] didn't point it out to you and sometimes
[1:01:56] it's incredible to me it's incredible
[1:01:58] how God will work with our lives he
[1:02:00] could right on day one sit there and
[1:02:03] point everything out in our heart
[1:02:04] remember this is your soul this is your
[1:02:06] heart sometimes what it is our heart
[1:02:08] gets in the way we can get unconfessed
[1:02:10] sin in the heart we can a lot of
[1:02:12] different things can be bottled up but
[1:02:14] we want to have them together we want
[1:02:16] that of our soul to say to our heart
[1:02:18] follow me is that right so to notice
[1:02:22] that that within that and that's where
[1:02:24] Satan always try to battle right there
[1:02:26] in the heart after a life has been
[1:02:28] filled and born of the spirit of God and
[1:02:30] you might you might look at that and say
[1:02:31] well how can it be that there's
[1:02:33] something that I can do as God points it
[1:02:35] out then that's when we step in under
[1:02:38] the authority of the Lord scripture on
[1:02:40] that he said every place that The Souls
[1:02:43] of your feet shall tread Joshua that
[1:02:46] have I given you and the Bible also goes
[1:02:49] on to tell us you will not drive out all
[1:02:51] the inhabitants at once but you will
[1:02:54] drive them out little by little as you
[1:02:57] are
[1:03:01] able so you you can't you know the new
[1:03:04] birth does not all of a sudden start off
[1:03:06] and man I'm completely right there in
[1:03:10] the promised land completely developed
[1:03:12] as a mature Christian I'll tell you what
[1:03:14] the prophet called that he called that
[1:03:17] nonsense he said there's a lot of false
[1:03:19] teaching going on that says today he
[1:03:22] said we're here we are as babies and
[1:03:24] then here we are born again tomorrow
[1:03:26] were mature Sons and Daughters of God he
[1:03:28] said that is nonsense well he said it
[1:03:31] I'll say the same thing it's nonsense
[1:03:33] it's nonsense that the enemy would like
[1:03:35] to try to wear you down and beat you
[1:03:38] down and keep you in a place to where
[1:03:40] you're always wondering in your life and
[1:03:42] in your walk with God but let me tell
[1:03:44] you something when God has transformed
[1:03:46] your life it is a miracle that you can't
[1:03:50] even explain you don't even know how it
[1:03:53] happened but you were there when it
[1:03:55] happened and you say how do I know
[1:03:57] because you have passed from Death unto
[1:03:59] life how do I know what were your
[1:04:01] desires before and what are your desires
[1:04:05] now that's how you know that's a word
[1:04:11] answer right not because I spoke in
[1:04:13] tongues not because I ran not because I
[1:04:15] done that that all can be impersonated
[1:04:18] the rain falleth on the just and unjust
[1:04:20] it can fall on my upon the flesh it can
[1:04:23] fall on the spirit and give a one
[1:04:25] wonderful experience of rain but it's
[1:04:28] got to come down to the
[1:04:30] soul remember the Mana they collected
[1:04:32] which was a type of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:34] God's word coming straight from heaven
[1:04:37] when they collected it they were told
[1:04:39] consume it all in the day whatever's
[1:04:41] left burning with fire cuz if you don't
[1:04:43] it'll get maggots in it but they picked
[1:04:46] up some that fell on the first day and
[1:04:48] they put it in a golden om but they put
[1:04:50] it in a special place they put it in the
[1:04:53] holiest of holies under the president of
[1:04:55] the shik glory and you know what it
[1:04:57] never did contaminate it it shows when
[1:05:00] the Holy Spirit it moves gets down to
[1:05:03] that soul level and produces a change
[1:05:06] I'm telling you the holy spirit will
[1:05:08] never ever contaminate that life it'll
[1:05:11] never break away you are sealed the
[1:05:13] Bible says Ephesians 1 Ephesians 4 you
[1:05:17] are sealed until the day of redemption
[1:05:20] it's not you keeping you it's God
[1:05:23] keeping his word in your life
[1:05:27] my now if you can take all the malice
[1:05:29] and envy and strife and unbelief out
[1:05:32] that that little button like of the
[1:05:34] light and power of God notice that
[1:05:37] little button like of the light and
[1:05:39] power of God will keep growing growing
[1:05:43] growing growing crowding out
[1:05:48] unbelief anybody had something in your
[1:05:50] house you realize and you might think
[1:05:52] you know I'd like to put this in a
[1:05:53] living room you finally realize where we
[1:05:55] going to put it
[1:05:57] I mean if we put we bring another coffee
[1:05:59] table in here somebody's going to have
[1:06:00] it on their lap or either going to move
[1:06:02] out a chair and it's got to go there oh
[1:06:04] this picture would look beautiful are we
[1:06:05] going to take one down and put another
[1:06:07] one up you see what happens is the holy
[1:06:09] spirit has you continue to receive the
[1:06:12] word what's happening the word is
[1:06:13] actually listen to me it's casting out
[1:06:16] the hold upon your life it exposes the
[1:06:19] enemy and as it cast it out it's God
[1:06:22] giving you the strength to be able to
[1:06:25] stand with the word and take the side of
[1:06:28] the word and as you receive that word it
[1:06:30] actually crowds out unbelief to where
[1:06:34] when unbelief or something would want to
[1:06:35] come back it has no place to come back
[1:06:39] to sorry that place has been
[1:06:42] filled that's what we want we want our
[1:06:44] lives to be filled with more of
[1:06:48] god notice he says you don't do it by ex
[1:06:52] exhortations of bodily exercise
[1:06:56] you do it by a Sanctified consecrated
[1:06:59] life that the holy spirit moves through
[1:07:02] you now so it isn't you know us working
[1:07:05] ourselves into a place man I oh Lord has
[1:07:07] dealt with my heart on this and man I
[1:07:09] really got to I tell I really got to do
[1:07:11] this no it's not bodily exhortations
[1:07:13] it's not that of bodily exercise of of
[1:07:16] exhorting ourselves and trying to work
[1:07:18] ourselves into something you never seen
[1:07:20] an oak tree or anything else out there
[1:07:22] saying man I oh I I just got to produce
[1:07:25] these acorns I you know the Sor oh I
[1:07:27] just got to shoot forth these arms and
[1:07:29] oh you know the you know there of the
[1:07:31] clam oh I just got to produce a pearl
[1:07:33] they're not struggling that it already
[1:07:35] lays there all they have to do is
[1:07:39] yield draw from the
[1:07:42] nutrients that are in the soil receive
[1:07:46] from the sunlight and that will take
[1:07:49] place in their lives now notice what he
[1:07:52] said he said a Sanctified means a set
[1:07:54] aside life isn't it amazing how the
[1:07:56] enemy will always if he can't keep you
[1:07:59] from the truth he tries to push you on
[1:08:01] if he can't hold you back one thing
[1:08:03] he'll try to do is try to get our life
[1:08:06] filled with so many other things the
[1:08:09] enemy can look down and hear oh my here
[1:08:12] the soul can be sealed away but then
[1:08:14] he'll try to come in whether it's
[1:08:16] through church problems or whether it's
[1:08:18] through family problems or or things on
[1:08:20] the job or whatever more and he'll try
[1:08:22] to move and find places in that heart
[1:08:25] that's why Paul told the Ephesian
[1:08:27] believers who was a type of those taking
[1:08:30] the promised land you and I it was
[1:08:33] speaking and it said give no place to
[1:08:36] the devil meaning that there is
[1:08:39] possibilities of giving place to the
[1:08:41] devil anybody ever said something or
[1:08:43] done something you had to repent for yes
[1:08:45] all right that that's giving place to
[1:08:47] the devil but you know what as soon as
[1:08:49] you repent and it's there in your heart
[1:08:51] and you repent you are absolutely
[1:08:53] identifying the enemy and as you repent
[1:08:56] and give yourself to God they saying
[1:08:58] Lord I don't want any Retreat for the
[1:09:01] enemy to come back
[1:09:03] to and then we continue to grow even
[1:09:06] from that so it's a consecrated life
[1:09:08] unto God a consecrated to him now notice
[1:09:12] in the Scriptures it says in sec in
[1:09:15] Titus Chapter 3 and verse 5 not by works
[1:09:19] of righteousness which we have done like
[1:09:22] I said in the Book of Ezekiel or book of
[1:09:24] Isaiah when God looked upon and would
[1:09:27] look upon them he would said your Works
[1:09:30] your righteousness is nothing but filthy
[1:09:34] rags when they went about to as far as
[1:09:37] trying to do something on their own they
[1:09:40] were instead of yielding to God's way
[1:09:43] God's word you say how is that yielding
[1:09:45] when it looks like this person is doing
[1:09:47] the same thing as this person remember
[1:09:50] God looks on the
[1:09:53] heart you can have two people doing the
[1:09:56] same thing but it's only received when
[1:09:58] it comes from the heart that's right
[1:10:00] right you can have two people worshiping
[1:10:02] right in church but it's only received
[1:10:04] when it comes from the heart that's why
[1:10:06] when God chose David he was a man after
[1:10:10] God's Own Heart he wasn't a perfect man
[1:10:13] but he was after God's Own Heart oh my
[1:10:16] that's why we want our heart to be in
[1:10:20] it I don't want to just be at church I
[1:10:22] want my heart to be in it I don't want
[1:10:24] to just serve God I want my heart to be
[1:10:27] in it like when Paul Raider gave his
[1:10:30] wife a kiss and walked out of the walked
[1:10:32] out of the house and he turned he heard
[1:10:33] her crying he felt so bad he walked back
[1:10:35] in and he gave her another kiss and
[1:10:37] somebody said what was the different he
[1:10:39] said the second one had some feeling to
[1:10:43] it not by work works of righteousness
[1:10:46] which we have done but according to his
[1:10:49] Mercy he saved us by the washing watch
[1:10:54] this now of
[1:10:55] regeneration and
[1:10:57] renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed
[1:11:01] on us abundantly through Jesus Christ
[1:11:04] Our Savior that being justified by his
[1:11:07] grace we should be made heirs according
[1:11:10] to the hope of eternal
[1:11:13] life now when we look at this on the
[1:11:16] washing I want you to watch this and I'm
[1:11:18] going to read in the Amplified here it
[1:11:20] said in verse 5 he saved us not because
[1:11:23] of Any works of righteousness
[1:11:25] that we had done remember the whole
[1:11:28] thing it's by by grace through faith
[1:11:30] that you are saved not of
[1:11:33] works works are only an appreciation of
[1:11:37] the grace that has come your way amen
[1:11:40] right why why do we dress the way we do
[1:11:42] why do we you know and praying and and
[1:11:44] giving ourselves why do we come to the
[1:11:46] house of God why do we give oursel we
[1:11:48] are doing it not out of law not out of a
[1:11:51] mandate we're doing it out of an
[1:11:53] appreciation for the great gra that's
[1:11:55] coming on our lives so this is what
[1:11:58] Titus is writing about that it wasn't it
[1:12:01] was God who came and sought us out so we
[1:12:04] know it's it's always about yielding
[1:12:06] everybody say yielding yelding that
[1:12:08] word's going to be very important here
[1:12:09] this morning notice by the cleansing
[1:12:12] bath of the new birth which is
[1:12:15] regeneration so God coming down on the
[1:12:19] inside in our life and bringing an
[1:12:22] absolute change within our lives it's
[1:12:25] God coming down on the inside and you
[1:12:28] know God isn't altogether the way God is
[1:12:30] approaching the new birth it's not he's
[1:12:33] trying to get somebody they'll be still
[1:12:35] be they'll be good enough he gets them
[1:12:36] cleaned up enough and then he moves
[1:12:38] inside no God on listen he provides his
[1:12:42] own Dwelling
[1:12:44] Place he is Jehovah Gyra is that not
[1:12:47] right he provides his own Dwelling Place
[1:12:50] when he told Moses and them let the let
[1:12:52] let them make me a sanctuary let me tell
[1:12:55] you they didn't come up with a gold they
[1:12:57] didn't come up with the wood that was
[1:12:59] already here the Bible said in the Book
[1:13:01] of Psalms that the Earth is the Lord's
[1:13:03] with the fullness thereof it might be
[1:13:06] under certain people's possession but it
[1:13:09] actually belongs to the Lord if you can
[1:13:11] look at it today even your whole life my
[1:13:14] whole life it might be it's under our
[1:13:16] possession but it actually belongs to
[1:13:18] the lord it's God's grace that every one
[1:13:20] of us no matter if it's a Believer or
[1:13:23] it's an atheist they owe it to God
[1:13:25] because God has allowed us to get up in
[1:13:28] our right mind and even to breathe the
[1:13:31] air that he himself has provided it's
[1:13:35] Grace my my my my my notice the
[1:13:38] Regeneration so it's now coming where
[1:13:41] God moves down on the inside to that
[1:13:44] that seed that part of him that was in
[1:13:46] there the whole time that part that
[1:13:49] belonged to him God moves down to that
[1:13:51] part on the inside to raise up that life
[1:13:55] and bring that dwelling place that he
[1:13:58] might dwell in that that brings about a
[1:14:00] change in our lives probably every one
[1:14:03] of us here have a cell phone right and
[1:14:06] and if you've ever had to I had to one
[1:14:08] time sometime before on my previous
[1:14:10] phone I had to actually install the SIM
[1:14:13] card that was that was a miracle in
[1:14:15] itself that I got that installed when
[1:14:16] you look at the size of my
[1:14:19] fingers and I remember having to read
[1:14:21] little numbers on there to the guys in
[1:14:23] the network that I'm a part of
[1:14:26] now I had I had a nice phone of course
[1:14:27] it was an iPhone I had a nice phone you
[1:14:30] know and and all these features that was
[1:14:32] on it my nice phone it looked you know
[1:14:34] man it looked just like the other iPhone
[1:14:36] I had and traded in man everything just
[1:14:38] looked just right but you know one thing
[1:14:39] was missing that SIM card I don't care
[1:14:42] how nice the phone looked without the
[1:14:45] SIM card in
[1:14:47] it there could be no
[1:14:50] activation are you hearing me this is
[1:14:53] why when Jesus could say my sheep know
[1:14:58] my voice amen not becoming sheep but we
[1:15:01] always were
[1:15:03] sheep is that right the Bible said in
[1:15:06] the Book of Matthew and the Book of Mark
[1:15:08] that the son of man is come to seek and
[1:15:10] save that which was lost God was not
[1:15:13] lost we were
[1:15:14] lost if you ever lost your keys it's
[1:15:17] your keys even when they're lost but it
[1:15:19] was your keys before they were lost we
[1:15:22] were always Sons and Daughters of God
[1:15:25] that's why God took job in Job chapter
[1:15:27] 42 and said where was you when I laid
[1:15:32] the foundations of the world and the
[1:15:34] sons of God shouted for
[1:15:37] Joy I'm telling you they're shouting for
[1:15:39] Joy over there in God's mind where
[1:15:42] Revelations 138 said the lamb was slain
[1:15:45] before the foundation of the world it
[1:15:47] was not just because of the atmosphere
[1:15:50] but it was actually seeing the Salvation
[1:15:53] that would come when de God himself
[1:15:56] would step down and would Tabernacle
[1:15:59] himself in flesh to redeem you and I
[1:16:02] back to
[1:16:03] himself so let me just say it this right
[1:16:06] here this is a drama that's being
[1:16:08] unfolded this is not something that's
[1:16:10] currently being written and
[1:16:13] edited that's why God don't need schools
[1:16:15] of denominations he don't need the
[1:16:17] Theology of man he's never the Bible
[1:16:20] said lean not to thine own understanding
[1:16:24] is is that right that's the word of God
[1:16:26] lean upon the word of God because
[1:16:28] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:16:31] word shall never
[1:16:33] fail amen amen amen so notice with this
[1:16:37] here cleansing bath of the new birth the
[1:16:40] Regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[1:16:42] Spirit I want to just say it to you like
[1:16:45] this that this in itself the new birth
[1:16:49] and the renewing of Our Lives is a
[1:16:52] complete work of the Holy Spirit from
[1:16:55] start to
[1:16:57] finish sir there is a renewing once once
[1:17:01] that birth has taken place on the inside
[1:17:04] there now comes a renewing and you know
[1:17:07] what it's not the renewing of
[1:17:09] psychology amen are you hearing me it's
[1:17:12] a renewing of the holy spirit so it
[1:17:15] comes back to what I was saying before
[1:17:17] once that Miracle of regeneration has
[1:17:20] taken place you now are a miracle and
[1:17:23] it's the beginning of mirac mirales in
[1:17:25] your
[1:17:26] life let me tell you something the
[1:17:28] things that God has made a way for you
[1:17:30] and I to walk through I I I'm not taking
[1:17:32] away from the Red Sea but let me just
[1:17:34] tell you that was only a type the Red
[1:17:36] Sea spoke of the power of the blood of
[1:17:39] Jesus Christ it spoke of the power that
[1:17:41] would come through Redemption and when
[1:17:43] they got to the other side they had joy
[1:17:45] in completeness is that right it would
[1:17:47] only speak of that it was only a type of
[1:17:49] the antitype that you and I have been
[1:17:51] called to experience to where we can
[1:17:53] look back on the other side and see the
[1:17:55] task Masters that once ruled over us the
[1:17:58] things that we were once subjected to
[1:18:00] and we tried to escape the things that
[1:18:02] even wanted to bring us down and and
[1:18:04] tried to you know en enslave us but
[1:18:07] there was one who came by our way and
[1:18:10] leted us to Victory in
[1:18:14] Jesus it's a renewing of our lives and
[1:18:16] you know what that renewing is still
[1:18:18] going on right here this
[1:18:21] morning there's things that the Holy
[1:18:23] Spirit you know what God God God goes
[1:18:26] into places let me just say this I
[1:18:28] listen everything that helps I say just
[1:18:30] like brother R said the things that God
[1:18:32] provides that helps humanity is of God
[1:18:36] and yet I also realize that you know
[1:18:38] what there's places where a psychologist
[1:18:40] or other people they could try to go but
[1:18:42] you know what there's times where things
[1:18:45] have become so buried in the
[1:18:47] subconscious of man it is so deep there
[1:18:50] to where even the person themselves they
[1:18:52] have come come into that place to where
[1:18:55] it's not even in their mind any longer
[1:18:57] yet it is a hindrance in their life I'll
[1:19:00] tell you there's only one that can
[1:19:01] uncover it there's only one that can
[1:19:03] deal with it there's one that can
[1:19:05] actually takes the power out of that
[1:19:07] torment that could be there in the
[1:19:09] spirit right there in the heart that
[1:19:11] maybe has still been ruling and
[1:19:12] hindering that life and wanting to haunt
[1:19:15] them but now from the inside God threw
[1:19:18] him by a positive experience by a
[1:19:21] miracle that can never ever be reversed
[1:19:24] God will work work through that to
[1:19:26] produce and overtake every area in our
[1:19:30] life that's what I want don't
[1:19:34] you
[1:19:35] Hallelujah we are his workmanship now
[1:19:38] watch this you know because everything
[1:19:41] about us then has become a miracle
[1:19:43] brother BR says it like this his nature
[1:19:46] is a miracle his habits a miracle his
[1:19:48] whole being is a miracle how can you be
[1:19:50] anything else but a miracle your new
[1:19:52] birth is a miracle your new life is a
[1:19:55] miracle even your nature is a miracle
[1:19:57] how can you look how you can look back
[1:19:59] and say them things are dead this is
[1:20:01] right you're a new creature a new
[1:20:06] creation oh my brother RA in prayer our
[1:20:09] heavenly father we are so grateful to
[1:20:11] you that we can be privileged to address
[1:20:13] you as our father for father means that
[1:20:16] we have been begotten of the great God
[1:20:19] that created the heavens and earth and
[1:20:22] we are so happy for this privilege that
[1:20:25] we can think in our hearts then that we
[1:20:27] are Sons and Daughters of God now watch
[1:20:30] this and to see you strictly identify
[1:20:34] yourself in the midst of us that you are
[1:20:38] our father so he he's identifying
[1:20:41] himself in our midst not just here not
[1:20:44] just in our midst but he's identifying
[1:20:46] himself in our midst he's in the midst
[1:20:50] of our life that's where he's dwelling
[1:20:52] when the New Birth has come he's not out
[1:20:54] here on the flesh he's not out there on
[1:20:56] the spirit but he's come to dwell in his
[1:20:59] Tabernacle and his Tabernacle he has
[1:21:03] provided for himself that place that he
[1:21:07] would dwell that seed that portion of
[1:21:09] himself that was deposited in your life
[1:21:12] that was part of your representation
[1:21:15] before the foundation of the
[1:21:17] world notice what are you what to he
[1:21:20] doing changing our thoughts from the
[1:21:23] things of the world
[1:21:25] and I don't mind telling you this is not
[1:21:28] something I don't know what happened
[1:21:33] here it's not something that just all of
[1:21:36] a sudden happens one day at the altar
[1:21:40] the change takes place in our soul
[1:21:42] that's
[1:21:43] true but then this right here changing
[1:21:46] our thoughts from things of the world
[1:21:50] some things God works on our life
[1:21:52] because we have certain Ambitions we
[1:21:54] have certain desires maybe there's even
[1:21:55] been certain upbringings certain things
[1:21:58] that we have been taught and schooled
[1:22:00] and so drilled within us that this is
[1:22:02] priority this is priority I mean may
[1:22:05] maybe let's say you know for example
[1:22:07] maybe it's you know a group of of
[1:22:08] parents that maybe they were raised up
[1:22:10] and maybe you know it was something
[1:22:12] maybe they didn't have college education
[1:22:13] then again maybe they did and here all
[1:22:15] of a sudden there everything to them
[1:22:17] it's it's education it's education it's
[1:22:20] education well sure God don't want us to
[1:22:22] be a bunch of dummies that's right but
[1:22:24] you know what never did God ever provide
[1:22:27] or put us that we would have to seek for
[1:22:29] something above him but he's our
[1:22:32] provider the scriptural principle is
[1:22:34] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[1:22:38] righteousness and all these other things
[1:22:42] will be added unto you now that might
[1:22:44] seem like a simple principle to you but
[1:22:46] you know what for somebody else that
[1:22:48] will absolutely take not only the
[1:22:51] regenerative power of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:53] that brings a new birth but it will
[1:22:55] absolutely take the renewing of the holy
[1:22:58] spirit that will actually have to work
[1:23:01] on that conscience to where that
[1:23:03] conscience in the spirit realm has been
[1:23:06] trained to where they feel as though if
[1:23:08] I don't do it this way I'm a
[1:23:11] failure come on Friends there's
[1:23:13] sometimes you know how it is it's just
[1:23:14] like when brother Ram talked about the
[1:23:15] Pentecostals he said they took the
[1:23:17] genuine articles of God and made a
[1:23:18] tradition out of them they felt like if
[1:23:20] everybody want dancing running speaking
[1:23:22] in tongues they hadn't had service or
[1:23:24] people W run into the altar we believe
[1:23:26] in all those things but we do not have
[1:23:28] to have that in order to have church
[1:23:30] that's just something that happens as
[1:23:33] sovereignly as God would give
[1:23:35] it you see that's part sometimes of the
[1:23:38] maturing in our life you say what where
[1:23:40] is that that's a renewing of the holy
[1:23:42] spirit in our life because you know what
[1:23:45] God don't want us walking around with
[1:23:46] our heads down that's right he wants us
[1:23:50] to walk as Sons and Daughters of God not
[1:23:51] arrogantly but to know who we are and
[1:23:54] you know what he comes to deal with
[1:23:56] those things in our lives just as we
[1:23:58] have need of them so I'll tell you this
[1:24:00] is one thing that has a body how we can
[1:24:02] actually pray for one another when you
[1:24:04] see one you see somebody else that has
[1:24:06] shortcomings I want you to remember look
[1:24:08] in the mirror you've got shortcomings
[1:24:09] too so the one thing that you ought to
[1:24:11] be able to do with the grace of God in
[1:24:13] your heart is to pray for somebody
[1:24:15] else is that right just like the prophet
[1:24:18] of God would say in certain places of
[1:24:20] things that he learned in that time he
[1:24:23] said sometimes he said used to be years
[1:24:26] ago he said we would a lot to it when
[1:24:28] somebody wasn't healed when we were
[1:24:30] praying for him and we would just say oh
[1:24:32] they didn't have enough Faith he said
[1:24:34] and then you come to find out it's
[1:24:37] sometimes unconfessed
[1:24:39] sin it's kind of like having electricity
[1:24:42] right here but you know if the electric
[1:24:45] cord has a short in it don't matter how
[1:24:48] much electricity is here no matter how
[1:24:50] much is down here on the inside the
[1:24:52] heart has to stay in a place to where
[1:24:55] the electricity can flow and this is
[1:24:58] where the renewing power of the Holy
[1:25:01] Spirit comes in this is why God help us
[1:25:03] to be real Priests of God help us to
[1:25:07] help us to sacrifice our own opinions
[1:25:09] about people help us to sacrifice
[1:25:12] self-righteous judgment help us Lord God
[1:25:14] to sacrifice because that is also part
[1:25:17] of our growing do you realize when God
[1:25:19] allows you to see wrong or to see
[1:25:21] shortcomings that is a test to see have
[1:25:24] we matured in our lives or are we just
[1:25:27] going to look down on somebody
[1:25:29] else I'm talking about maturing friends
[1:25:32] the real revelation of the word does not
[1:25:34] make us big AirHeads where we are puffed
[1:25:37] up and everybody else is minial Minions
[1:25:40] that is not what the revelation of Jesus
[1:25:43] Christ does I'm telling you right now if
[1:25:45] you're frustrated get in the presence of
[1:25:48] God and say God wash out all this
[1:25:51] frustration out of my life Lord I want
[1:25:53] to be a Channel of divine refreshment
[1:25:57] when others come into my presence they
[1:26:00] can
[1:26:01] say that's the odor of a Believer woo
[1:26:04] man that's
[1:26:06] refreshing that's my
[1:26:10] desire but God God places Us in that so
[1:26:13] we would pray for one another how many
[1:26:15] going to say Lord I'm going to pray a
[1:26:16] little bit more earnestly
[1:26:18] now cuz what what you need renewing on
[1:26:20] may not be what somebody else needs
[1:26:22] renewing on right
[1:26:24] all right let's let me go on here yeah
[1:26:27] changing our motives and objectives and
[1:26:31] attitudes and every phase of us to love
[1:26:35] you to believe you and know that your
[1:26:37] promises are
[1:26:39] true we
[1:26:41] grow to the full
[1:26:44] stature I want to read this scripture to
[1:26:46] you I'm going to try to deal with it
[1:26:48] just a little bit here in Romans 8 my
[1:26:51] goodness I wish I could just just preach
[1:26:53] a straight Roman Romans 8 that's
[1:26:54] actually what I'm preaching right now
[1:26:56] but out of Romans 8 notice the Bible
[1:26:58] said likewise the spirit helpeth our
[1:27:00] infirmities for we know not what we
[1:27:03] should pray for as we ought anybody ever
[1:27:04] been there as a matter of fact it's
[1:27:07] thing places we dwell often Lord I I
[1:27:10] don't even know how I don't even know
[1:27:11] how to express this I don't even know
[1:27:13] how to pray Lord I mean I'm praying but
[1:27:15] I don't even know I don't know what to
[1:27:16] say but Lord what we do we come into
[1:27:18] that moment Lord you know what I have
[1:27:20] need of Lord God give Lord you know what
[1:27:23] I have need Lord let my heart let
[1:27:24] everything be reconciled to you and see
[1:27:26] what it is it's giving ourselves to God
[1:27:28] then as the spirit helpeth our
[1:27:33] weaknesses oh glory be to God for he for
[1:27:36] he maketh the spirit itself maketh
[1:27:38] intercession for us with groanings which
[1:27:40] cannot be uttered and he that searcheth
[1:27:42] the heart knoweth what is the mind of
[1:27:45] the spirit because he maketh
[1:27:46] intercession for the Saints according to
[1:27:49] the will of God so so the spirit of God
[1:27:51] is not going to make intercession for us
[1:27:54] on something that would somehow Advance
[1:27:56] our
[1:27:57] life out of the kingdom of God that he
[1:28:01] won't do that so that's why we always
[1:28:03] say as a children of God we learn as we
[1:28:06] go on not to call everything a
[1:28:11] blessing we evaluate it a blessing to
[1:28:15] who a blessing to this guy or a blessing
[1:28:18] to this guy big difference this guy can
[1:28:21] be blessed and and this guy gets cold
[1:28:24] weak right not not living an overcoming
[1:28:28] life like he ought to be and that guy on
[1:28:30] the inside let me tell you you you were
[1:28:32] not made you and I were not made to
[1:28:34] thrive as far as within just that of the
[1:28:37] natural we were made to thrive in the
[1:28:40] spiritual and then the natural takes
[1:28:42] care of itself is that right that's a
[1:28:45] scriptural principle I was talking about
[1:28:47] there and we know now listen if you're
[1:28:49] if you're in that place today and say
[1:28:51] Lord man I you know my brother Samuel
[1:28:53] and fear wants to GP us you know what
[1:28:55] this is a place to even begin this is
[1:28:57] where when the scripture the the quote I
[1:28:59] read to you Sanctified consecrated life
[1:29:01] any time you find where God's dealing
[1:29:03] with your life on something and there's
[1:29:05] something whether it's said or it's
[1:29:07] something that the Holy Spirit brings to
[1:29:09] your attention while the word is being
[1:29:11] spoken that's what the spirit of truth
[1:29:12] will do he'll bring things back to our
[1:29:14] remembrance is that right as the moment
[1:29:16] as that comes our way right there while
[1:29:19] you're setting while the word's coming
[1:29:21] say yes Lord be it unto me and you know
[1:29:23] what it'll do it'll push back that fear
[1:29:25] it'll push back that doubt you know what
[1:29:27] it is it's receiving the renewing of the
[1:29:30] holy spirit in our life don't set on the
[1:29:33] word but yield to the word give
[1:29:35] ourselves to the word as God would deal
[1:29:37] with our
[1:29:39] life oh my that's consecrating our lives
[1:29:42] to the
[1:29:43] Lord isn't it amazing how you get right
[1:29:45] into service and all of a sudden the
[1:29:47] devil bring something to your mind oh
[1:29:49] Lord did I close a dog cage at home one
[1:29:52] wonder if I left the curling iron on
[1:29:54] man I wonder if I unplugged the haird
[1:29:56] dryer you know I didn't use that this
[1:29:57] morning I I wonder if I unplugged a
[1:29:59] toaster I wonder if I did this I want
[1:30:00] isin't it amazing trying to divert our
[1:30:02] attention so if he can't hinder it as
[1:30:05] far as to try to build up fear and build
[1:30:07] things up he'll try to divert our
[1:30:09] attention in another way because he
[1:30:10] knows the power listen to me now he
[1:30:13] knows the power of when a Believer comes
[1:30:16] in contact with the word and the word is
[1:30:20] received there is transforming power in
[1:30:23] the word of God is that right there is
[1:30:26] power in the word just like in Genesis 1
[1:30:28] to
[1:30:29] transform conditions and
[1:30:32] situations so notice here as he goes on
[1:30:35] to say he maketh intercession according
[1:30:38] to the will of God the Bible goes on to
[1:30:41] say we know that all things work
[1:30:43] together for good to them that love God
[1:30:46] he never said everything's
[1:30:48] good right I mean you know my wife just
[1:30:51] made some cookies and things like that
[1:30:53] for the holiday
[1:30:54] and and I I love white chocolate oh man
[1:30:56] I love white chocolate and I like them I
[1:30:58] could eat that I could just sit there
[1:31:00] and eat them things but when but you
[1:31:02] know when she goes to making them
[1:31:02] cookies I don't grab you know a cup of
[1:31:04] flour and say boy this is good I don't
[1:31:07] grab just a cup of sugar and say man
[1:31:08] this is good I don't grab you know a
[1:31:11] teaspoon of baking soda or whatever she
[1:31:13] uses but you see when you get it all
[1:31:15] together then there's something good and
[1:31:18] there's a lot of experiences in our life
[1:31:20] that are not good but when when we yield
[1:31:24] to the Lord God brings good out of
[1:31:29] it it was a terrible situation that
[1:31:32] happened to
[1:31:33] Joseph come on somebody it was a
[1:31:36] terrible situation that happened to
[1:31:38] Daniel being took to Babylon Joseph
[1:31:41] being taken down there to Egypt they
[1:31:43] could have played the victim
[1:31:46] card are you hearing me they could have
[1:31:48] fellen under I'm a victim I'm a victim
[1:31:50] of circumstance that's true but they
[1:31:52] chose in the midst of that time and
[1:31:54] God's grace let me tell you it was not
[1:31:57] their works it was the grace of God that
[1:32:01] was there to assist them so that
[1:32:04] bitterness and everything did not
[1:32:07] permeate their lives and hinder God's
[1:32:10] program that's the same way it is in our
[1:32:12] lives friends if not for the grace of
[1:32:15] God if not for God's grace in our life
[1:32:18] for not only pointing things out in our
[1:32:20] life but if it's not for his grace
[1:32:23] coming in and moving with such such such
[1:32:26] Glory of his raise to override our own
[1:32:30] will I'm glad about that aren't you
[1:32:33] notice to be conformed for whom he did
[1:32:37] for whom he did for know Forno he he
[1:32:39] knew us he knew us before the foundation
[1:32:42] of the world is that right Bible said
[1:32:44] our names were wrote in the Lamb's Book
[1:32:46] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:32:48] world he also did predestiny you knows
[1:32:50] our destiny our destiny I come from God
[1:32:53] I'm going back to to God to be conformed
[1:32:56] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:32:59] the firstborn among many Brethren more
[1:33:01] of whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:33:04] called and whom he called them he also
[1:33:06] Justified and whom he justified them he
[1:33:09] also
[1:33:10] glorified and I love how the prophet
[1:33:12] would took that up in 62 jovah Gyra he
[1:33:15] said we're already a finished product
[1:33:17] we're just working our way out to
[1:33:21] it in the message you must be born again
[1:33:23] again the prophet goes on to say born
[1:33:26] Christians grow into the stature of
[1:33:29] Christ as they live these this is two
[1:33:32] important things grow into the stature
[1:33:37] of Christ as they
[1:33:41] live they're born again and their lives
[1:33:44] begin to shape like a baby it takes form
[1:33:47] and begins to grow and the first thing
[1:33:48] you know here they are in full stature
[1:33:50] there you are watch this day after day
[1:33:53] year after year they stay the same now
[1:33:55] he's not talking about never growing
[1:33:57] he's talking about where we are abiding
[1:34:01] in Christ that's so good many come we
[1:34:04] come back to the word if you abide in me
[1:34:07] notice we don't want to be wonders this
[1:34:09] is what the word comes to do Ephesians 4
[1:34:12] said that we be not children tossed to
[1:34:15] and
[1:34:16] fro you see there's a lot of voices
[1:34:18] friends there's a lot of voices in the
[1:34:21] world
[1:34:22] today now you you've you've never heard
[1:34:25] it from me I I don't I don't stand here
[1:34:26] and say you can't listen to this one I
[1:34:28] I've heard a lot of times I've heard a
[1:34:30] lot of things token taken with certain
[1:34:32] quotes and things like that but I'm just
[1:34:33] going to tell you in this manner right
[1:34:35] here if you look to this as your home
[1:34:37] Church God's got this this Avenue is
[1:34:40] what is feeding
[1:34:42] you it's the Avenue that God himself not
[1:34:45] me not me not me not me there's no way
[1:34:48] that I can know the parts about your
[1:34:49] life but it's like you know when you go
[1:34:51] into a doctor's office and you go for an
[1:34:53] appointment what do they do when you go
[1:34:54] back to the room when you come in
[1:34:56] they've already got your chart pulled is
[1:34:57] that right is that right everybody with
[1:35:00] me now they got your chart pulled let me
[1:35:02] tell you something God has our chart
[1:35:03] pulled yes and when God pulls down that
[1:35:06] chart it has all the history about our
[1:35:08] lives it has everything about our life
[1:35:10] and let me just tell you something even
[1:35:12] if I did know all the history of your
[1:35:14] life I cannot fix you but God himself it
[1:35:18] isn't God interested in fixing you you
[1:35:20] are a new creation he brings a trans
[1:35:23] transformation on the inside and then
[1:35:26] from there healing Works its way out in
[1:35:28] our lives so it's him in his designated
[1:35:32] place that has our chart that's right
[1:35:34] now doesn't say that we do not receive
[1:35:36] benefit and help from specialist I've
[1:35:38] been to specialist myself things on my
[1:35:41] back and other things like that but
[1:35:42] those are not my primary doctor but they
[1:35:44] are specialized in certain things I'm
[1:35:46] glad God's got specialist don't you I'm
[1:35:48] glad that God can bring Specialists
[1:35:50] right into the church maybe it's another
[1:35:52] Pastor evangelist teacher God can bring
[1:35:54] those specialists in and God will hone
[1:35:56] right down maybe through a perspective
[1:35:58] and an angle that they're working with
[1:35:59] but it's all for the perfecting of the
[1:36:02] saints that perfecting is that complete
[1:36:06] maturity and growth into Christ that's
[1:36:09] right I tell you when we it's all said
[1:36:10] and done we stand over there Our Lives
[1:36:12] it's all Christ every little bit and
[1:36:14] every piece that we've received but
[1:36:16] thanks be to God for his grace that's
[1:36:17] been able to help us to recognize his
[1:36:20] voice and be able to receive that word
[1:36:22] as it's coming no matter the vessel he's
[1:36:26] using that's part of maturity as well
[1:36:28] too oh my notice but be born again but
[1:36:33] be born of the spirit and grow into the
[1:36:36] stature of Christ you said you see
[1:36:37] brother Dal growing into the stature of
[1:36:39] Christ through your life proves like if
[1:36:42] you were born a prophet you'll remain
[1:36:44] that if you were born a Christian you'll
[1:36:47] remain that if you abide in me and my
[1:36:50] words abide in you then ask what you
[1:36:53] will
[1:36:54] this grows you up into the stature of
[1:36:57] Christ now notice he goes into his own
[1:37:00] personal experience not some young
[1:37:02] lawyer beating screaming crying telling
[1:37:05] you this that and the other and making a
[1:37:07] lot of emotions but somebody who's grown
[1:37:09] into the stature of Christ through the
[1:37:12] years has seasoned out and proved
[1:37:16] standing at the helm did you catch those
[1:37:19] words that are all capitalized right
[1:37:21] there that is not something that happens
[1:37:25] overnight but it is as we submit ourself
[1:37:28] to God and there's a seasoning out
[1:37:31] there's a proving out standing over the
[1:37:34] helm over the years this is why oh my
[1:37:37] you know I think when I was over there
[1:37:39] even Australia and I had had the
[1:37:41] privilege of ministering that youth
[1:37:42] meeting with brother Freddy Esau there
[1:37:44] he's over in New Zealand now but brother
[1:37:46] Freddy 80 some years old my Lord I said
[1:37:48] I hope I'm I hope if God carries I hope
[1:37:50] I can get around like you do man I me
[1:37:52] you stand on CH stand on chairs and
[1:37:54] everything and preach like a house on
[1:37:56] fire and I'll tell you what but you know
[1:37:57] within it there was such a love for God
[1:38:00] such a wisdom and and such experiences
[1:38:02] that he' come through and you know he
[1:38:04] shared many experiences even about his
[1:38:06] own life of things catastrophes would
[1:38:09] come that literally you know just seemed
[1:38:12] like took him off of his rocker but it
[1:38:14] could not separate him from the love of
[1:38:17] God even to where when his wife received
[1:38:19] cancer he looked to God and said Lord I
[1:38:22] have stood and preached your word I've
[1:38:24] opened churches right there in the heart
[1:38:27] of where the city he was at in South
[1:38:28] Africa gangs and everything else around
[1:38:31] and yet you let my wife come down with
[1:38:33] cancer but he said you know what God
[1:38:36] knows how to deal with your life and
[1:38:38] soften you down that's right come on now
[1:38:41] to me you know what I can appreciate
[1:38:42] about that maturity helps us to be
[1:38:45] honest
[1:38:47] too because before that time we want to
[1:38:50] listen it's human nature to want to hide
[1:38:51] everything and I'm not saying you go go
[1:38:53] around and tell everything you got to be
[1:38:55] you have to understand you you shouldn't
[1:38:57] walk around and you got to tell your
[1:38:58] whole life like a book to everybody that
[1:39:00] isn't what I'm saying at all but I'm
[1:39:01] saying sometimes God will allow
[1:39:04] experiences to be expressed to you and I
[1:39:06] in order to be stepping stones of God's
[1:39:08] grace for you and I to walk on it's also
[1:39:11] those testimonies can come where when
[1:39:13] Satan has had you backed into the corner
[1:39:15] and you thought man I questioned God
[1:39:17] maybe I blasphemed maybe I did this
[1:39:19] maybe I done that and the spirit of God
[1:39:21] will come right through a testimony
[1:39:23] through an experience like that and it
[1:39:25] will Rel loose Satan's hold from
[1:39:28] standing over you and torment
[1:39:30] you don't you love how God
[1:39:33] works notice this but you see it's
[1:39:36] seasoned out over the years now you know
[1:39:40] it grows us all the way brother Bram
[1:39:43] goes on to say no other on Christ the
[1:39:45] solid rock we stand all other grounds is
[1:39:47] seeking Sands let denominations Creeds
[1:39:50] come let let isms keep me humble Lord
[1:39:53] stay right with the word and move right
[1:39:55] on through the stream she'll guide us to
[1:39:58] the shore full statur
[1:40:01] man friends we're living in an hour
[1:40:04] where it's time where the Earth is
[1:40:06] groaning for the
[1:40:08] manifestations of the sons of God not a
[1:40:11] big movement not a camp meeting
[1:40:14] somewhere no thank God for every Camp
[1:40:17] Meeting thank God we need meetings but
[1:40:19] the manifestations of the sons of God is
[1:40:22] Not only on a platform not only at a
[1:40:23] meeting but it's just like what took
[1:40:25] place in the prophet's home when his
[1:40:27] wife was all tore up it was a Son of God
[1:40:30] taking Dominion in that
[1:40:33] situation it's coming back to that place
[1:40:37] because it's time it's time for
[1:40:40] Rapture it's time the Millennium is not
[1:40:42] going to be a time of growing and
[1:40:44] preparing right here Rapture is where we
[1:40:48] take our character that's been molded
[1:40:51] and shaped and that's what we take with
[1:40:54] us am is that right that's what we take
[1:40:57] with us there to the other side now
[1:40:59] notice it becomes seasoned out how many
[1:41:01] of you know you know sometimes when
[1:41:03] you're cooking things sometimes we have
[1:41:06] comments you know
[1:41:07] that some of my boys are made on certain
[1:41:09] things and maybe certain places I don't
[1:41:11] like really I'm not sure I don't really
[1:41:13] like going there because they don't you
[1:41:13] know don't really seem like add flavor
[1:41:15] to the food I said that's your
[1:41:20] opinion with a capital O
[1:41:24] but you see you know you have certain
[1:41:26] things and you take I give it to you and
[1:41:28] I give I give it to you and you know
[1:41:29] you're making chicken noodle soup no no
[1:41:31] no no I think it needs more of this then
[1:41:33] I give it to you oh no it's too much
[1:41:35] salt then I give it to you oh no has too
[1:41:38] much pepper I give it to you oh you know
[1:41:41] I think it needs a little bit more
[1:41:42] noodles oh then you give it to somebody
[1:41:43] else oh carrots oh that's me
[1:41:47] carrots you see that's why I'm glad that
[1:41:49] God does not entrust the seasoning of
[1:41:52] our life life to anybody
[1:41:56] else we are seasoned by the holy
[1:42:00] spirit it's God who is seasoning our
[1:42:03] life the prophet said May the salt of
[1:42:06] the holy spirit so season our life that
[1:42:08] there would be such Sweetness in our
[1:42:10] life there would be such a testimony of
[1:42:13] where others would be drawn by the
[1:42:16] sweetness and the saltiness of the
[1:42:18] spirit in our life because you know salt
[1:42:20] was a part of every sacrifice in the old
[1:42:23] Old Testament is that right showing that
[1:42:25] it's not you can't just be letter only
[1:42:27] Paul said letter kth but the spirit
[1:42:30] giveth life it's got to have the salt
[1:42:32] with it because when the salt is in the
[1:42:34] sacrifice it's the character of God's
[1:42:36] own life and when God's own life is
[1:42:38] coming through the sacrifice of the word
[1:42:41] it has an effect Upon Our Life to change
[1:42:44] our lives that our character might match
[1:42:48] his
[1:42:49] character don't you love him yes yes sir
[1:42:52] let me just try to jump head here real
[1:42:53] quick this is why that even when we look
[1:42:56] at in our lives this is why Paul when we
[1:42:59] think of it the holy spirit being the
[1:43:01] tutor how many of you recognize the
[1:43:03] scripture where where Paul would talk
[1:43:07] about yay though doubtless I count all
[1:43:10] things but loss for the Excellency of
[1:43:13] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:43:15] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:43:17] things and do count them but dung that I
[1:43:20] may win Christ I want to read that
[1:43:22] scripture to you out of the Amplified
[1:43:25] version Paul said yay I count everything
[1:43:29] as loss compared to the possession of
[1:43:33] the Priceless privilege the overwhelming
[1:43:36] preciousness the surpassing worth and
[1:43:39] supreme advantage of knowing Christ
[1:43:42] Jesus my Lord and of progressively
[1:43:46] becoming more deeply and intimately
[1:43:49] acquainted with him of perceiving
[1:43:53] and recognizing and understanding him
[1:43:56] more fully and clearly for his sake I
[1:44:00] have lost
[1:44:01] everything and consider it all to be
[1:44:04] mere
[1:44:06] rubbish in order that I may win Christ
[1:44:11] the anointed
[1:44:12] one I want to be more like
[1:44:15] him this is what Paul is speaking in
[1:44:18] that verse I I I want to become more I
[1:44:21] want to become more deeply
[1:44:23] intimately I want to know him more and
[1:44:26] realize the Bible tells us it's the
[1:44:29] fellowship of his sufferings I love the
[1:44:32] part where Paul would say that I may
[1:44:34] know him in the power of his
[1:44:35] resurrection you could say Paul don't
[1:44:36] you already know him in the power of his
[1:44:39] resurrection Paul could say I do but
[1:44:42] many times in my life when the negative
[1:44:45] is all around me negative thoughts
[1:44:49] negative circumstances there are things
[1:44:52] where the ship are being tossed up and
[1:44:54] down and it seems like it's going under
[1:44:57] but at that time the power of the
[1:45:00] Resurrection works from the inside out
[1:45:02] to lift me to change the thoughts break
[1:45:06] back the clouds he was there the whole
[1:45:08] time but the power of the Resurrection
[1:45:10] comes forth from within our
[1:45:13] lives but there's
[1:45:15] Fellowship that comes through the midst
[1:45:17] of
[1:45:19] suffering in the valley that the
[1:45:23] mountaintops will never produce you see
[1:45:26] this is where that even in our lives
[1:45:28] sometimes even we start out young
[1:45:29] Christians and it can actually it can go
[1:45:31] on sometimes you find people that's been
[1:45:33] serving the lord for a long time and
[1:45:35] they search for
[1:45:37] mountaintops they'll go from Mountaintop
[1:45:40] experience to Mountaintop experience to
[1:45:42] Mountaintop experience to Mountaintop
[1:45:44] experience you know why human nature
[1:45:47] does not like
[1:45:49] valleys they'll search for this move
[1:45:51] search for this move wherever it's
[1:45:53] happening seems like it's but you know
[1:45:55] what you never produce fruit on
[1:45:58] mountains it's too cold up
[1:46:00] there you produce food fruit in the
[1:46:03] valley that's Psalms 1 I I just want to
[1:46:06] be where he's at like like what like
[1:46:09] what Moses told him Lord if you don't go
[1:46:11] I ain't
[1:46:12] going I'm going where your presence is
[1:46:16] because that's where there's peace
[1:46:17] that's where there's joy and there's
[1:46:18] fruit that's got to be brought out of my
[1:46:20] life is that right you see this is it's
[1:46:23] just like when we were growing up
[1:46:24] remember when we were you know I know
[1:46:25] every one of us are different I mean you
[1:46:27] know there's probably like maybe out of
[1:46:28] this whole congregation maybe three
[1:46:30] people that wasn't followers when they
[1:46:32] were in school and no doubt some think
[1:46:34] they weren't when they were and you know
[1:46:36] maybe they didn't have the certain
[1:46:37] couldn't obtain the certain brands or
[1:46:39] fit in with certain clicks or get in
[1:46:40] with certain things but it was always
[1:46:42] that desire why it's always a desire to
[1:46:43] fit in always want to be accepted right
[1:46:46] and there's certain things about it you
[1:46:47] know where we're we're trying this and
[1:46:48] then and then this becomes a new style
[1:46:50] this is the new style leave this leg
[1:46:52] down roll this one up to your knee uh
[1:46:54] and then then you know this this becomes
[1:46:55] the new style you know to wear to wear
[1:46:57] your pants like this or wear your shirt
[1:46:59] like this or do this or do that and it's
[1:47:00] always you know trying to fit in always
[1:47:02] trying to to come into that place and
[1:47:04] it's always and within it you always
[1:47:06] find emptiness you don't find that all
[1:47:08] of a sudden you gain more friends as
[1:47:09] soon as the next thing changes from one
[1:47:11] style to the next here you are live you
[1:47:13] are left in a place either get a job
[1:47:15] pick up more hours or hope mom and dad
[1:47:17] got a good income tax return that will
[1:47:19] actually help you to be able to attain
[1:47:21] certain things so you can keep in with
[1:47:24] everybody
[1:47:26] else that's a
[1:47:28] trap and that can be a trap in our
[1:47:31] spiritual walk with
[1:47:34] God I'm not interested in keeping up
[1:47:37] with everybody else thank God for what
[1:47:40] God's doing at so and so's church and
[1:47:42] whatever more but God you know what
[1:47:44] every Church goes through
[1:47:46] seasons is that right every Church goes
[1:47:49] through Seasons sometimes there's
[1:47:50] seasons of dryness there's seasons of
[1:47:52] sewing God will do those certain things
[1:47:54] the prophet tells us to test us to see
[1:47:56] what we will
[1:47:58] do but you know one thing I'm so glad
[1:48:00] about it God ain't going to lose one
[1:48:02] that's right God ain't going to lose one
[1:48:05] sometimes there's things that you can
[1:48:06] say I never was bothered with that glory
[1:48:09] to God I'm
[1:48:10] glad so glad maybe You' got your Sunday
[1:48:13] school star back from when you were just
[1:48:14] a wee little born again Pik you have
[1:48:17] that man that star was on the chart but
[1:48:19] that doesn't mean that everybody else
[1:48:20] had that star on the chart right away
[1:48:23] that's
[1:48:24] right you see it's an individual
[1:48:26] experience and an individual walk that's
[1:48:30] a part of a whole body so if you've got
[1:48:33] three gold stars and I've only got one
[1:48:36] guess what pray pray that he'll get the
[1:48:39] other two gold
[1:48:42] stars right is that all right that
[1:48:44] that's that's what we're here for so
[1:48:46] notice we we come through it's it's
[1:48:48] wisdom through experience remember
[1:48:50] brother R would would take this in
[1:48:52] example in the message humble thyself
[1:48:54] and he would talk about you know how
[1:48:56] that any person's time on Earth as your
[1:48:58] allotted time on Earth you know it' be
[1:49:00] most foolish if we don't serve God but
[1:49:02] you know he he was asking the question
[1:49:04] what what time would we take if we were
[1:49:06] given a choice by God in serving him
[1:49:10] which one of these allotments would we
[1:49:13] take you know birth to 25 if we're going
[1:49:17] to do that brother Ram said if you're
[1:49:18] going to be a heartbreak for the women
[1:49:20] maybe you take that
[1:49:21] one because CU after 25 it's all
[1:49:26] downhill then 25 to 50 you want to be a
[1:49:29] teacher mechanic and one of occupation
[1:49:31] you you this is what I want to be this
[1:49:32] is my ambition You' take that
[1:49:35] one but you know brother BR said if I
[1:49:37] had my choice I would choose 50 to 75
[1:49:40] and then he goes on to say actually says
[1:49:42] if God would allow me Grace to be here
[1:49:44] when I'm 100 I would be better prepared
[1:49:47] now when I would be 100 to get into the
[1:49:50] foreign field now now listen listen
[1:49:53] don't don't don't don't don't look
[1:49:54] around at people that are close to 100
[1:49:56] just stay with me now all right now I
[1:49:58] want you I want you to notice listen
[1:50:00] what he's saying it's a spiritual
[1:50:01] application here he says what it is he
[1:50:03] said I would take that 75 to 100 I'd be
[1:50:07] smarter and wiser I'd be more settled
[1:50:12] I'd know more about what I'm
[1:50:15] doing I wouldn't jump in like I'm
[1:50:18] killing snakes I'd know more about it
[1:50:20] he's talking about in his ministry he
[1:50:23] said it's just like a dog fighting
[1:50:24] a you know more about how to take a
[1:50:26] hold of him you don't jump in there and
[1:50:29] scratch you up you know his tricks in
[1:50:31] what he does and we learn more about the
[1:50:36] enemy so we've got to find out all his
[1:50:38] techniques how he approaches what he
[1:50:40] does learn his punches then you're
[1:50:42] trained to go in on him BR said I
[1:50:45] believe I'd be in better shape now than
[1:50:48] I was when I was 40 years old when I'm
[1:50:50] 100 I'll be even better if God would T
[1:50:53] and I'd tar I'd be in better shape
[1:50:55] because you know more about it you know
[1:50:58] more about what to do and how to handle
[1:51:00] it and how to handle the
[1:51:07] situation how many
[1:51:09] times there's times you know probably
[1:51:12] every one of us have heard this I tell
[1:51:13] you what man when we have children
[1:51:15] they're not going to do this and this
[1:51:16] and this and this I've been there I've
[1:51:19] already seen that usually you I'm almost
[1:51:22] the SP anymore I want to say don't say
[1:51:23] nothing don't don't
[1:51:25] don't because I've seen them do the
[1:51:27] exact opposite of what they said not
[1:51:29] going to do this not going to do that
[1:51:31] boy I tell you what we got children
[1:51:32] it'll never be like this and it'll never
[1:51:34] be like this and then you know here we
[1:51:36] come you know as new parents why do we
[1:51:38] you know we look at things why do we you
[1:51:40] know read you know Parenting Magazine I
[1:51:42] don't know if that's what it's called or
[1:51:43] whatever more you know uh you know maybe
[1:51:46] WR wrote by females that never even had
[1:51:48] children at all you know and yet they
[1:51:49] know all about it you know and then you
[1:51:51] got all these kinds of things like the
[1:51:52] prophet said it talk sounds like when
[1:51:54] they tell you to let that little child
[1:51:55] lay there in the crib and cry cry it off
[1:51:57] he said it don't sound like a very
[1:51:59] professional say that it sounds like a
[1:52:02] witch
[1:52:03] doctor because that very thing he said
[1:52:06] will produce neurotics gangsters you say
[1:52:10] how could that be why where what
[1:52:11] produces a gangster he never had a
[1:52:14] family that accepted him where he could
[1:52:17] fit in why do you think gangs and all
[1:52:20] those other things are rising why do you
[1:52:21] think they come from oh brother Samuel
[1:52:23] there's evil around that's true but do
[1:52:25] you realize friends the reason that
[1:52:27] those things are can be so exploited is
[1:52:30] because there is bruises so deep in
[1:52:33] people that have never had father
[1:52:35] figures never had families and it opens
[1:52:39] them up they want to have a family
[1:52:41] somebody that would have my back
[1:52:44] somebody that actually wants to look at
[1:52:46] my face and wants me to be around them
[1:52:49] and you wonder how those types of things
[1:52:51] happen oh it's just a bad country over
[1:52:53] there Venezuela and this and that it's
[1:52:55] just listen it comes down from
[1:52:58] situations like that I wonder how many
[1:53:02] situations that the Holy Spirit if he
[1:53:03] can comb through here in these
[1:53:06] services and find that there's places in
[1:53:09] our
[1:53:11] hearts that he himself could bring
[1:53:14] healing in our lives and watch our lives
[1:53:18] as a Christian
[1:53:20] grow from that area
[1:53:24] let me just tell you
[1:53:26] something it may not be where something
[1:53:28] right now that you even noticed or you
[1:53:30] even see or aware of but God knows
[1:53:32] exactly where you and I are at and let
[1:53:36] me just tell you something you ought to
[1:53:37] just let it be known right now if
[1:53:39] there's something that stands before you
[1:53:41] if there's something that comes out with
[1:53:43] bitterness of this or that or one more
[1:53:45] listen this is what you ought to do
[1:53:46] don't don't don't don't look around at
[1:53:48] somebody else but invite Lord invite the
[1:53:50] Lord say father Mel away this
[1:53:53] bitterness because the only person
[1:53:55] that's going to kill is
[1:53:57] you bitterness is like you taking this
[1:54:02] and you drinking
[1:54:05] it and I'm waiting for him to fall
[1:54:08] over it won't work guess who gets
[1:54:11] affected right
[1:54:13] me and not only me but my whole family
[1:54:16] then eventually the church because
[1:54:19] bitterness will spread you can't contain
[1:54:20] bitterness you don't lock it up but a
[1:54:22] room you can't just say well it's here
[1:54:25] in this compartment it'll spread but oh
[1:54:28] I say Lord let the renewing rise of the
[1:54:31] holy spirit let it spread in our lives
[1:54:34] as you can let the Holy Spirit take out
[1:54:38] all malice
[1:54:40] bitterness
[1:54:42] disappointment
[1:54:45] hurt but we grow how many say Lord I
[1:54:48] want to
[1:54:49] grow I want to grow Lord I want to
[1:54:52] continue to
[1:54:54] grow let me just try to let me let me
[1:54:56] wrap it up right here because I'm not
[1:54:57] gonna I'm not g to push on I wanted to
[1:54:59] get into Joshua but I'm just going to
[1:55:01] stop right
[1:55:03] here brother Bram takes this takes this
[1:55:06] up here in the
[1:55:08] message and he says in works as Faith
[1:55:12] Express he's talking about when he first
[1:55:14] started
[1:55:15] out I don't want you to read it ahead of
[1:55:17] me he when he first started out he said
[1:55:21] he would come out of those out of those
[1:55:22] healing meetings discernment had taken
[1:55:25] place and he said I was walking on the
[1:55:28] street didn't even know where I was at
[1:55:30] he said I was like a little boy that had
[1:55:32] been trying to
[1:55:34] swim I didn't know how to make The
[1:55:37] Strokes at that time now watch how he'll
[1:55:40] applied this in works as Faith
[1:55:42] Express he says you know he says it's
[1:55:44] like you're learning to
[1:55:47] swim you splash the water you go across
[1:55:50] the pool
[1:55:51] and I made her now after you learn to
[1:55:56] swim see there's a difference between
[1:55:58] learning and you've learned yeah right
[1:56:02] or as they say in the South it learned
[1:56:03] you real
[1:56:04] good after you
[1:56:07] learn to
[1:56:09] swim how do you learn to swim there's
[1:56:11] some mistakes in it that that that are
[1:56:13] made right there's some times where here
[1:56:15] you are in the middle of swimming and
[1:56:16] you realize I got to get to the side of
[1:56:17] the pool right you might you you stand
[1:56:20] come on now don't get quiet on me
[1:56:22] I mean maybe you know you usually you
[1:56:24] had maybe an inner tube kind of close
[1:56:26] together you had an instructor and
[1:56:27] somebody who was there coaching you
[1:56:29] along the way true and before you could
[1:56:33] maybe swim the entire length of the pool
[1:56:36] you might
[1:56:37] say I started out right away I swam the
[1:56:40] entire length of the pool the first time
[1:56:43] okay so maybe you swam it the first time
[1:56:45] but now swim turn around and swim it on
[1:56:47] the way back oh brother Samuel I
[1:56:49] eventually got to there that's how in
[1:56:50] our Christian walk
[1:56:52] there's a growing that's taking place
[1:56:54] but notice the swimming he says after
[1:56:56] you learn to swim it's more graceful in
[1:56:58] the stroke it don't wear you out as much
[1:57:01] you learn how to do it and cut every
[1:57:05] corner and make it better that's more of
[1:57:09] an ease he says you take like a little
[1:57:11] boy that never walked would try to walk
[1:57:13] down this aisle here he would fall down
[1:57:16] a dozen times and be wore out before he
[1:57:19] got here but anyone who knows how to
[1:57:21] walk like an athlete would walk right
[1:57:24] down that aisle and never even notice
[1:57:26] doing it he had to start with that
[1:57:30] coming down the aisle that's what he is
[1:57:32] now though brother Bram said that's the
[1:57:35] same way with preaching Divine Healing
[1:57:38] or anything else as you go along you
[1:57:42] begin to
[1:57:43] learn I don't mind to tell
[1:57:46] you I've learned as a pastor and I'm
[1:57:50] still learning I've learned as a husband
[1:57:53] and I'm still
[1:57:54] learning you know kind of like one of
[1:57:56] the the funny things we were kind of you
[1:57:58] know talking about you know the other
[1:58:00] night and just sitting around talking
[1:58:01] and you know sometimes understand in
[1:58:03] case you didn't notice that I got three
[1:58:04] boys so working with them to understand
[1:58:07] to help them to understand that when
[1:58:08] when we talk about understanding your
[1:58:11] wife or understanding her that doesn't
[1:58:12] mean that you're going to understand it
[1:58:14] it means that you understand how to work
[1:58:16] with it yeah that's right it was a funny
[1:58:19] little video that somebody showed us
[1:58:21] where they she had a nail sticking out
[1:58:23] of her head and she's on the couch with
[1:58:24] her husband and he's looking at you need
[1:58:27] to get that nail out of your forehead
[1:58:28] and she's just talking about you know
[1:58:30] that you know things going on when I go
[1:58:31] to put a sweater on it snags and he's
[1:58:33] just saying as a male would the Nail's
[1:58:36] the problem she don't want the nail out
[1:58:38] the forehead just listen to her yeah
[1:58:41] yeah just Pat her on the hand that's
[1:58:43] right tell her you understand come on
[1:58:44] friends I'm not making fun I'm just
[1:58:46] saying this is real things yes it is
[1:58:49] there are times to solve problems but
[1:58:50] you learn don't you
[1:58:53] Lord I would hope I have more hands up
[1:58:55] as husbands in here you learn some of
[1:58:57] you probably want to raise your feet as
[1:58:58] well but what what he did that
[1:59:00] experiences of saying the wrong
[1:59:03] things right you go and then you thought
[1:59:05] man I should have been the hero I went
[1:59:07] out to get the Hammer with the claw and
[1:59:09] get it
[1:59:10] out but you realize that's not what she
[1:59:14] wanted you might say that's
[1:59:17] confusing but you
[1:59:19] understand you understand
[1:59:22] you understand see how what happens to
[1:59:25] that it's growing now you and you could
[1:59:28] stand as a husband and say that don't
[1:59:29] make sense okay I mean we can talk about
[1:59:32] that later me and you but you could say
[1:59:34] that don't make sense well there's a lot
[1:59:36] of things about us that don't make sense
[1:59:38] to her oh yeah like how that men love
[1:59:43] nothing time what are you doing nothing
[1:59:45] and it is
[1:59:47] wonderful
[1:59:48] wonderful decompression nothing time
[1:59:51] what do you think thinking about
[1:59:56] nothing but you see how do you
[1:59:59] understand
[2:00:00] that oh I know when I when I got before
[2:00:03] I got married I thought I knew
[2:00:04] everything oh man you know I thought I
[2:00:07] knew my wife knew man I thought this and
[2:00:09] that but oh
[2:00:10] boy I realized that you know what
[2:00:13] knowing is it's dying yes it is it's
[2:00:17] dying that's good preaching it's
[2:00:20] learning and you know the the only way
[2:00:22] that we can actually come that way with
[2:00:24] God it starts through a death and a new
[2:00:27] birth and then All Things become new
[2:00:30] there's a lot of things that God will do
[2:00:32] and say places he'll take us through
[2:00:34] that doesn't make sense that's right
[2:00:36] there's things that he will do that we
[2:00:38] can think like Paul Lord if you'll just
[2:00:41] remove this Thorn from my life Lord
[2:00:45] remove this but God could say Paul my
[2:00:48] grace is sufficient because in weakness
[2:00:53] perfect
[2:00:54] weakness my strength is
[2:00:59] perfect do we understand that no we do
[2:01:02] not understand that humanly speaking
[2:01:04] because we look at when we're the
[2:01:06] strongest is when we feel like we're
[2:01:08] right there on the mountain that's when
[2:01:09] I'm at my best and actually that's when
[2:01:12] we're at the most vulnerable moments in
[2:01:14] our life that's right and God brings us
[2:01:16] and lets us come down in the valley of a
[2:01:19] place of surrender because that's where
[2:01:21] fruit is born
[2:01:22] you don't have Rivers up there on the
[2:01:23] top of the mountain but the Bible said
[2:01:25] that a man blessed is the man where his
[2:01:28] Delight is in the Lord he's planted by
[2:01:31] the rivers of Living Water so there's
[2:01:35] understanding that comes our way as we
[2:01:36] grow like the prophet's talking about
[2:01:38] right here we understand a little bit
[2:01:40] more there's things think about it after
[2:01:43] we've passed through certain things when
[2:01:44] brother R would talked to sister mey
[2:01:46] about 18-year-old thoughts here she was
[2:01:48] didn't sister mey live live through 18
[2:01:50] years old she did didn't brother Bram he
[2:01:53] did it's just like as you come through
[2:01:55] things with your children but sometimes
[2:01:57] we can try to see things through
[2:02:00] our
[2:02:02] time and the challenge is can we
[2:02:06] think those thoughts to remember what it
[2:02:09] was like now when we remember what it's
[2:02:12] like it's not compromising but it's to
[2:02:14] think and enter in there but say God
[2:02:17] give me the wisdom to lead them in this
[2:02:20] moment in their life
[2:02:22] because you see when you begin to think
[2:02:24] that way then you're stepping in as an
[2:02:26] intercessor on their behalf Lord help
[2:02:30] them during this time instead of looking
[2:02:32] at them like they're a nutcase what's
[2:02:34] going on why do they think this way why
[2:02:36] is this going on but see when you can
[2:02:37] begin to come into that place Lord I
[2:02:40] remember when I was 16 I remember when I
[2:02:43] was 18 Lord I remember when I was 21 or
[2:02:46] let's bring it to a church body Lord I
[2:02:48] can remember when I first got saved Lord
[2:02:51] I can remember how it was such a
[2:02:53] blessing others took me under their wing
[2:02:55] and helped me out they encouraged me
[2:02:58] they strengthened me they invited me for
[2:02:59] Fellowship Lord God thank you for those
[2:03:02] many of them may maybe gone on to the
[2:03:04] other side but now what are we doing in
[2:03:06] return for that what are we doing Lord
[2:03:10] help me that I can be a blessing
[2:03:13] too because then we can really pray for
[2:03:16] one another don't you love him to me
[2:03:19] it's to me friends it's just tremendous
[2:03:21] how God Works through the body it it's
[2:03:23] absolutely tremendous it's something
[2:03:25] that to under to just our minds cannot
[2:03:27] even fathom it but to know that God is
[2:03:30] working right on time and this important
[2:03:33] statement let me just close here if you
[2:03:35] don't learn there's something
[2:03:39] wrong see experiences doesn't
[2:03:42] necessarily mean we learn that's right
[2:03:44] if we continue to do the same things
[2:03:47] over and over again and expect a
[2:03:50] different outcome it's what
[2:03:53] Insanity that's the definition of it so
[2:03:56] just just just going through experiences
[2:04:00] does not mean we're
[2:04:02] learning but when we're submitting to
[2:04:05] him even when we fall in short even when
[2:04:09] it comes like I was using that
[2:04:10] illustration between husband and wife
[2:04:12] even as we come into those places to say
[2:04:14] Lord help me how to minister to my
[2:04:18] husband help me how to minister to my
[2:04:20] wife help me Lord how to minister to my
[2:04:23] children help me to know how to minister
[2:04:25] to the rest of the body don't you love
[2:04:31] him I want to
[2:04:33] learn because with that right there if
[2:04:35] you've got to learn you've got to learn
[2:04:38] how to accept God and what it really
[2:04:41] means CU if we're not if we're not
[2:04:43] learning we're not
[2:04:46] growing right that's that's exactly what
[2:04:49] the prophet is saying we're not growing
[2:04:51] so one one of the things about growing
[2:04:53] is where we're learning our
[2:04:56] understanding to trust him even our
[2:04:59] understanding of our own self to
[2:05:01] understand your own
[2:05:03] shortcomings come on Friends some people
[2:05:06] need a little bit more sleep than other
[2:05:07] people some need less some need and you
[2:05:09] know what you might think that's such a
[2:05:10] natural thing H Let It Be where somebody
[2:05:14] doesn't receive what they need and it
[2:05:16] can be a great hindrance to their life
[2:05:19] right they think man I'm going going to
[2:05:21] go on a diet and I'm going to fast and
[2:05:23] they end up about eating everybody for
[2:05:24] lunch before
[2:05:26] lunch you might say that's pretty
[2:05:29] natural but it's trying listen it's
[2:05:32] understanding different parts in our
[2:05:34] lives this is why brother BR would work
[2:05:36] with so many different ones he said when
[2:05:38] I get overworked that's when Satan pours
[2:05:41] it on
[2:05:43] me I say Lord help
[2:05:46] us friends I say it right here this
[2:05:48] morning the same spirit of God he's here
[2:05:51] to bring transformation in our lives
[2:05:54] he's here this morning if you've never
[2:05:56] experienced that real miracle in your
[2:05:58] life yield to him let it say God help me
[2:06:01] Lord override all of my thoughts all of
[2:06:03] my fears all of my doubts Lord I commit
[2:06:05] myself to you brother the Samuel I've
[2:06:08] tried it but remember to try it is
[2:06:10] different than surrendering to it you
[2:06:12] can try something like there's sometimes
[2:06:14] there's lots of food I've tried and I
[2:06:17] didn't eat it I tried it but I didn't
[2:06:19] eat it but if you'll surrender and say
[2:06:22] Lord condition My Heart Lord condition
[2:06:24] my life I I I want Lord with everything
[2:06:28] within me I want to be a walking
[2:06:31] miracle that Miracle of where that
[2:06:33] change in my life that was spoken about
[2:06:35] where that growth will come forth and
[2:06:37] others Lord I want that renewing of the
[2:06:41] holy spirit that growth from the
[2:06:44] positive on the inside not this man the
[2:06:47] negative trying to work and trying to
[2:06:50] produce but let me yield to you Lord
[2:06:53] with a consecrated Sanctified life help
[2:06:57] me Lord I want to know you more I want
[2:06:59] to know what pleases you wouldn't you
[2:07:02] want to know listen to me just a few
[2:07:03] moments here wouldn't you want to know
[2:07:05] think about it think about how it is I
[2:07:07] know sometimes we're we're just barely
[2:07:09] able to get in the door here I get it I
[2:07:11] get it I know sometimes even on midweek
[2:07:13] services and other things I know that
[2:07:15] but H think about what it's been at
[2:07:17] times when we've been able to have some
[2:07:20] time to prepare
[2:07:22] before we come to the house of God even
[2:07:25] sometimes it may even be the FIV minute
[2:07:27] drive on the way here sometimes you may
[2:07:29] that praying might seem like the
[2:07:32] farthest thing that your flesh wants to
[2:07:34] do yet you know Lord that's that's what
[2:07:36] I I need to do I need to I need to get
[2:07:38] before you and here you are maybe events
[2:07:40] have happened maybe you got something in
[2:07:41] the mail you didn't open yesterday but
[2:07:43] you opened it on Sunday morning
[2:07:45] breakfast table and it just ruined your
[2:07:47] appetite it actually has ruined almost
[2:07:49] seemed like it overshadowed any
[2:07:50] expectation you would have from the
[2:07:53] things of the Lord and just a weariness
[2:07:55] just a Gloom just an oppressiveness that
[2:07:57] would seem to set down but yet how the
[2:08:01] spirit of God could move right down here
[2:08:03] in the midst of this moment and give us
[2:08:06] a real refreshing to break back those
[2:08:09] clouds to break that back and say God
[2:08:12] just a fresh Lord renewing from your
[2:08:14] presence just a strengthening Lord in my
[2:08:17] life you know it all it all is a
[2:08:19] consecrating you know what it is is that
[2:08:21] right how how many knows what it is when
[2:08:23] you go I know it's very simple things
[2:08:25] I'm not trying to keep it but I'm just
[2:08:26] trying let it be applied to our our
[2:08:28] Natural Life anybody like getting out of
[2:08:30] getting up late and trying to make it to
[2:08:33] work anybody ever had that
[2:08:36] happen I remember one time when I still
[2:08:38] worked in sanduski we were actually
[2:08:40] living over there I just started
[2:08:41] pastoring and I remember the one time I
[2:08:43] had to actually take some things from my
[2:08:44] back the one time and it was not even
[2:08:46] one of those knockout pills but all of a
[2:08:49] sudden I got a phone call and the phone
[2:08:51] call received was my my principal she
[2:08:53] said are you coming in
[2:08:56] today man I mean I already and listen
[2:09:00] this was already late and and and I
[2:09:03] thought oh no I mean you you you just
[2:09:05] you look at it you're like man the whole
[2:09:06] day what's the day going to hold I mean
[2:09:09] you know you're just trying to get ready
[2:09:11] trying to get down the road you're
[2:09:12] wondering what are the kids going to be
[2:09:14] like when I get in there are you hearing
[2:09:16] me now and you just feel like
[2:09:18] everything's going to be going to be a
[2:09:19] ruin and you know how that feels where
[2:09:21] there's times where there's pressure
[2:09:23] situations that just comes and says man
[2:09:25] if I could just call off I would call
[2:09:28] off but
[2:09:29] yet there's such a difference when we
[2:09:33] can actually be able to get
[2:09:35] up maybe only hit the snooze button one
[2:09:38] time get out of bed coffee's already
[2:09:42] on extra shot in there you're ready to
[2:09:46] go man it feels good to get there early
[2:09:49] that's the same way sometimes we learn
[2:09:52] these simple little things in our walk
[2:09:56] with god of just even when we enter in
[2:10:00] coming into the sanctuary getting ready
[2:10:03] to receive from God we start even on
[2:10:06] Saturday night entering in it's not that
[2:10:09] we're bad people then all of a sudden we
[2:10:11] change gears but we begin to realize
[2:10:12] we're approaching the Throne of God and
[2:10:15] you know what we learn we learn as we go
[2:10:18] on because you can see the benefit of
[2:10:20] what you get out of the the service you
[2:10:22] can see the investment that takes place
[2:10:24] don't you love him let's just bow our
[2:10:26] heads in a word of prayer musicians why
[2:10:29] don't you go and
[2:10:30] come Heavenly
[2:10:34] Father Lord
[2:10:36] through the foolishness of preaching you
[2:10:40] chose to save Souls
[2:10:44] Lord father it would not be that of a
[2:10:48] man would not be that of just words
[2:10:51] but Lord God it's your
[2:10:54] strength it's you coming through your
[2:10:57] word and just melding away Lord father
[2:11:01] all of our fears all of our
[2:11:03] doubts Lord God the things that Lord
[2:11:06] that might even be there Lord in the
[2:11:10] heart that Lord where Satan has wanted
[2:11:13] to pres Lord keep that as a
[2:11:17] hindrance is Lord for something not a
[2:11:20] life not move moving on with you
[2:11:26] Lord would you just go down in every
[2:11:29] area of Our
[2:11:31] Lives Lord every one of us that are
[2:11:34] gathered
[2:11:36] here maybe just as every eyes closed
[2:11:39] maybe just as a token to him with just a
[2:11:41] hand or hands uplifted say Lord every
[2:11:44] eye closed Lord just go down in every
[2:11:47] area
[2:11:49] Lord Lord God I want to be consecrated I
[2:11:53] I want to be one with
[2:11:55] you and through that Oneness Lord of
[2:11:58] your life on the inside I I want Lord
[2:12:01] God I I want to know you
[2:12:04] more Lord like a husband and a wife
[2:12:07] would get to know one another and then
[2:12:09] you know Lord each of their children
[2:12:12] Lord each of my each of my boys there
[2:12:13] similarities but there's such
[2:12:16] differences there's certain ways that I
[2:12:18] can approach one that I won't approach
[2:12:20] the other one that way
[2:12:22] but you've helped me to see that
[2:12:25] Lord and that's how you do us Lord as
[2:12:28] your
[2:12:29] children you said in your word you know

[2:12:40] to approach us it'll always be a word
[2:12:42] approach it's always you but you know
[2:12:45] just how to deal with each one of our
[2:12:48] Lives Lord

[2:12:53] through our
[2:12:54] lives may we lord be so
[2:12:58] seasoned by the spirit of God lord if
[2:13:02] there's one here in under the sound of
[2:13:04] my voice this morning that's never
[2:13:07] experienced that miracle in their life
[2:13:09] to where they can look back and
[2:13:12] see my life is
[2:13:15] different it's not something
[2:13:17] that that I've tried or maken myself but
[2:13:22] I see the difference in my life I see
[2:13:27] and I know by that inward desire in my
[2:13:29] life I'm not what I used to

[2:13:37] just consecrate themselves to you right
[2:13:40] now may they just Lord God in your

[2:14:14] that I think about Lord after times that
[2:14:18] my wife and I Lord is when we were
[2:14:20] married there's certain things that
[2:14:23] after some periods of time or we could
[2:14:25] talk certain
[2:14:27] things we could actually begin to
[2:14:29] express certain things to not in a
[2:14:32] manner of criticizing one
[2:14:36] another but in Lord in a manner Lord to
[2:14:39] be able to express maybe certain things
[2:14:42] that were done or said or or not done
[2:14:45] and how that would cause us to
[2:14:49] feel and Lord God we be able to Lord be
[2:14:52] able to talk about those things I to me
[2:14:54] Lord that in itself was such a victory
[2:14:58] Even in our marriage

[2:16:01] go according to what they thought and
[2:16:04] how it should
[2:16:06] be but it went right

[2:35:33] hallelujah
[2:35:37] [Music]
[2:35:43] hallelujah I don't want you to
[2:35:45] misunderstand me but we've just come
[2:35:48] through an election here
[2:35:51] and there's getting ready to be a change
[2:35:52] of
[2:35:54] administration some of that's already
[2:35:55] taken
[2:35:58] place you know it'll change a lot of
[2:36:00] different things that can affect even
[2:36:02] down into the lower
[2:36:04] levels is a change from the
[2:36:07] Top This Is Why when the scripture tells
[2:36:10] us it would do no good to just try to
[2:36:14] take off an arm try to take off a
[2:36:17] foot but God himself deals a Blow To The
[2:36:21] Head of the
[2:36:23] serpent when the Holy Ghost has come
[2:36:26] it's a new Administration in our lives
[2:36:30] Hallelujah and when a new Administration
[2:36:32] moves into our lives not like that of
[2:36:33] even of the Earthly when he moves into
[2:36:36] his rightful
[2:36:38] position he makes us Kings and
[2:36:41] Priests we are now under the
[2:36:45] Dominion in the Kingdom of his dear son
[2:36:50] and under that
[2:36:51] Administration not everything changes
[2:36:53] all at
[2:36:54] once right but what changes is the
[2:36:58] desires and then eventually the way that
[2:37:01] things are done in that Kingdom begins
[2:37:03] to Hallelujah take place in our lives we
[2:37:07] begin to
[2:37:08] realize that though I am a Browning in
[2:37:10] the natural but I'm a Son of
[2:37:13] God so I'm not here to conduct or put
[2:37:17] myself up as a Browning because
[2:37:19] Browning is just like any any other
[2:37:21] piece of dirt that's upon the face of
[2:37:23] the Earth it's what's on the
[2:37:25] inside there's not no matter what your
[2:37:27] last name is no matter where you come
[2:37:29] from I don't you could have come what
[2:37:31] you would think from the best stock in
[2:37:32] the world it don't matter we still need
[2:37:34] the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost
[2:37:36] we're nothing and when the Holy Ghost
[2:37:39] comes in he helps us to see we're
[2:37:40] nothing and we're still nothing and it's
[2:37:43] him but oh in that change of
[2:37:45] administration that's when there's
[2:37:47] things that starts getting past things
[2:37:49] that starts changing in our
[2:37:51] lives can you see that in your own life
[2:37:54] there's changing and you know what the
[2:37:56] changing keeps on going because it's the
[2:37:59] same one in you that created the heavens
[2:38:03] and the Earth how did he create the
[2:38:05] heavens and the Earth did he do
[2:38:07] everything all at
[2:38:08] once
[2:38:11] no he worked on day
[2:38:13] [Music]
[2:38:16] one if we can say time in that way
[2:38:20] to sustain what was coming on in day
[2:38:24] two he would put day one and day two
[2:38:27] together sustained what he would bring
[2:38:29] forth in day three see God works in our
[2:38:32] lives he's building in order to
[2:38:36] sustain what further work he's doing in
[2:38:38] our
[2:38:40] lives you know what's actually happening
[2:38:42] it's God in you in me unfolding
[2:38:47] himself that's what he's doing he's
[2:38:49] unfolding himself he's unveiling himself
[2:38:53] through our
[2:38:55] lives and you know the only thing that
[2:38:57] you and I have to do is die die to our
[2:39:00] own thinking die to our own reasoning
[2:39:02] die to everything around say Lord be it
[2:39:05] unto me Lord consecrate ourselves to the
[2:39:08] word give ourselves you say how do I
[2:39:10] consecrate to the word reading
