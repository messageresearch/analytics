and through the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ man and then it is his sovereign work moving in our life that brings us into the Church of the Living God amen you know there's only one church

there that they're welcome to be here on that Thursday evening and then he also you know we agreed upon that that over there on Friday at 7 o'clock where the cadre will be there as well so you're yeah I would just encourage you to take advantage of that amen and we just we so need just appreciate the Lord Jesus also wanna remind you of prayer meeting here this coming Tuesday night and let's it's 6:30 and I know some of you I don't know we send the emails out and we send other things out and is there prayer meeting tonight how many to get the email okay now how many of you look at the email okay about five of you and if you're not on the email list you'd be upset I'm just picking with you but just read it from now on print it out and put it on the front of the fridge or something is that all right well you didn't say Amen but it but it'll help you it'll help you Amen want to just save as I appreciate brother Jerry being here with us and so appreciate him standing in here and ministering the word while we were away and I just appreciate your prayers I had different ones even from the assembly that just had even text me and let me know that just the Spirit of God had come upon them in prayer and they were interceding they went into a spirit of intercession for those services down Aaron I know that they weren't the only one there were many things there were brothers even coming into those meetings down there that we didn't find out till later but they had had many dreams of God supernaturally moving in those services and I could tell you the very beginning God supernaturally moved there's just so many differences to that we could say here but I won't take the time away how many souls were baptized brother Mike many was there about six or eight you don't remember you'll probably look too nervous brother Michael God God got ahold of brother Michael's life on Tuesday night and he walked into the waters of baptism to take on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and a man and I tell you right while the preaching of the was going forth there were circles taking place right in those services eyes that were crossed were straightened right in those services Amen there were many many demons cast out within those services and in the prayer of many time that's my mom voice didn't go from the preaching it went from the praying and I tell you it was just it was our fillet through and you know you you look at there was nothing out said to you like this there was nothing watered-down about the word that was going forth there was nothing watered about it whatsoever and these young people were rejoicing in the Lord I'll tell you they were having a wonderful time I mean that the building was not too big to run in they I mean they were jumping they were shouting they were being filled with the Holy Ghost I tell you God was doing amazing amazing things I'm glad to be a part of what God is doing in this hour amen amen I just I think God for His mercy a man in the services so I just want to say I certainly appreciate your prayers now while we were gone and we just want to pull on the gift of God morning what God has for us how many believe that God knows what we have need of now what we have need of sometimes isn't always what we might want to receive but if we can say Lord I'll receive what you know that I have need of in my life you know because when you go to a doctor you can only tell the doctor your symptoms but the doctor himself is the one who can diagnose it and make the prognosis on this situation and that's what we want this morning we don't want to take our own will we Lord I want your will in my he knows the decisions he knows choices he knows everything that's before us and he's here in his word to influence our lives that we might make godly choices amen not just in days to come but even in this service right here amen you love the Lord amen let's just stand and we'll just sing the song as brother Jerry would come let's just sing the song Amazing Grace amen you know little Michael was singing up here and little Michael was singing that song and you know he he only sang certain words and I thought you know that's right sometimes we try to know too much and we know so much that we don't we're not even standing on what we know we know a whole lot of things we know a whole lot of quotes we know a whole lot of scriptures but it'd be best just to stand on what you know a man stand on what you know and wait for God to open more to you then you've got ground to stand on Amen that's what we want on our hearts as believers amen not may not know much but as long as we know the author that's what's important that's what's important he is the everything seeing grace [Music] now [Music] good to be here with you this morning let's just bow our heads in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we come before you this point of the service Lord we're asking God for your anointing they're gone for you to come Lord you're the real preacher Lord minister the word to the people today Lord to be a help to them dear God an encouragement I pray dear God of me that their needs be met and made their God there's any bound they'd be set free I pray Lord that you will Lord have your way in this service and have the preeminence in Jesus Christ's name Amen praise the Lord like to read from Acts chapter 16 verses 25 and 26 amen acts 16 verse 25 and that midnight that's what I want to speak on tonight there this morning at midnight and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sing praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly you know we could use some suddenly in our Christian walk suddenly somebody gets saved suddenly somebody gets filled with all that go suddenly somebody gets delivered somebody gets healed he meant and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open everyone's bands were loosed you may be seated the word midnight is mentioned in 13 different verses in the Bible you're familiar with the proverb of it's always darkest before the dawn we know the metaphorical meaning of that proverb but it's not entirely correct the darkest time of night is actually midnight when the Sun is a hundred and eighty degrees from the position where you are that's the darkest time the darkest time of 2019 will be December 21st that midnight that's when the Sun is the earth you know is tilted so we're away from the Sun tilted away from the Sun then the sun's 180 degrees on the other side and it's supposed to be the darkest night of the year but one minute after midnight starts a new day I was thinking of Moses and the children of Israel and you know they were having a very dark time being in bondage and Moses comes to him and talks to them and tells them the Lord has sent me down here and Aaron's going to be with me and we're gonna go talk to payroll and we're gonna get you set free and so the people were excited about this and they they begin to keep the Sabbath again and so they meant they rested on the Sabbath and so then Moses and Pharaoh or Aaron go to Pharaoh and when they get there they tell him let the people go so they can go three days journey into the wilderness that they may worship their God and Pharaoh says I don't know this God of Israel I don't know this God and he said in furthermore the the people or they got too much time on their hands and so from now on we're not going to give him any straw they're gonna have to gather their own straw man I don't want the tally of the bricks to be the same as it's always been so they have to do more since they got so much time to rest then we're going to give them more to do keep them busy and so the rulers the elders of Israel that were kind of officers I think the Bible calls them were set up over the the Israelites they the Italian bricks wasn't being kept up so they beat the officers and then the officers said it's not our fault they didn't know what had happened or what Mosiah I'm gonna give you you're gonna have to make your own bricks out of straw you gather and then they were in great tribulation here and it was a beginning to be a dark time in their lives darker than all the other years of bondage because it was getting greater and the more Moses went up before Pharaoh the angrier Pharaoh God and the more they beat the people and they went up then through nine plagues and each time Pharaoh's heart was hardened and you think about Moses Moses knew because God told him fables not gonna let him go I'm gonna harden his heart but Moses had to go up there anyway and tell him all right the next plagues gonna be this and the next leg is gonna be that and then God's gonna do this and then God's going to do that and knowing that it was going to fall on hardened ears but then finally the Lord moves and begins to speak to Moses and he says about midnight I'm gonna visit through the land and there's going to be death to every firstborn child to every firstborn from the animals all the way up to Faye roll himself and it gives Moses instructions that what Israel's to do was to slay a lamb and to take its blood and put it on the doorpost and that when the Death Angel pass through then it would pass over them that had the blood on the doorpost and so here comes the plague and it happens at midnight and if and then the death angel passes through and brother Branham says that a long about midnight there was a strange feeling of unrest even came over the Hebrews and then the Death Angel passed over every door that had the blood but took the lives of every firstborn from the cattle all the way up to the throne and it happened at midnight a dark time in their lives but at midnight come a dawning of a new day one minute after midnight they were free one time Samson went up to a place called Gaza and what he was doing up there he shouldn't have been up there in the first place the Bible says he went up there to see a prostitute so he shouldn't have been up there but you say well one can draw from this one the grace of God I'm thankful for the grace of God amen but Samson was there in Gaza and then he fell asleep and they the Philistines knew he was there so they were gonna lay and wait for him that in when he got up the next morning they were going to fall upon him and so they shut the gates of the city up fast and said they thought they had him locked inside now the Bible doesn't record why what happened or wide that Samson woke up but whether what it was God that woke him up or dreamed the God give him or whatever it was Samson woke up at midnight and at midnight Samson went up and took ahold of the doors of the gate and he lifted the doors of the gate in the post thereof and he carried them to a hill close to here on a heparin was somewhere around thirty six miles from Gaza and it's not meant that he actually carried him all the way to hedron but he carried him up on a hill from which hedron could be seen and he can't however many miles that was that was if Heda carried the gates one mile that was a miracle of course you know Hollywood paints him up to be some kind of muscle man and people you know amongst even the churches and paint him up to be some kind of muscular fella but we know the Prophet said he wasn't but the miracle was that he was just a natural looking fella but when the Holy Ghost came upon him when God's Spirit came upon him he had great strength slew a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of an ass he killed the lion like as if it was a lamb now back to where we started our text Paul and Silas came into this city and they began to preach in this city and there was a woman that had a spirit of divination on her and she followed them around and and kept proclaiming about them and after a while Paul turns around and rebukes the devil that's honoring cast the devil out the Bible says the devil left immediately and so the Masters of this woman saw that their prophet was going to be gone because they used her for Sue saying and so they laid hands on Paul and Silas and took them into to stand before the magistrate and told these Jews are troubling us and so they commanded them to rent their clothes off and they beat them and it said they laid on them many stripes and they cast him into a prison and then when they once they were casted in prison they told the jailer said you know you keep him fast don't let these two go so the jailer took him and put him on the innermost parts of the jail and then he put their feet in stocks do you know what stocks are it's two pieces of wood or iron or whatever that's made to where it it comes and closes and locks down to where they're on their ankles to where they can't get up they can't move they then and then they book their hands in chains so here they were laying up against this wall and it was it was a dark time for him they had been preaching in the name of the Lord and now all the sudden they had been beat first of all stripped of their clothes and then beat and if that wasn't enough they throw them in prison and locked them fast now if there have been some of the Christians from today they'd have been thinking why did this happen to me but Paul and Silas there was something different about them they knew that no matter where they were they were in God's hands and in the will of God they didn't know why they were in prison they didn't know but they but they were there and so the Bible says about midnight at midnight they began to sing hallelujah headed our Twitter at a time when it looked like things couldn't get no better and it looked like it couldn't get any worse they began to sing and following god if you can take it you can make it going through the trials and things that you face if you can take it you can make it and they begin to sing at a time when and you know there's times in church when we can't hardly get the people to feel like singing in there not in stocks and bonds they're not locked up they had been beaten but here they were in this condition and all of a sudden they begin to sing and worship God and praise God and we know from reading the Scriptures why they were there they were there because there was a jailer and his house that needed saving and the only way they were going to get to talk to that jailer was if they were in jail with him so they had to go where he was so something had to take place to put them there and then when they begin to sing at midnight they earth begin to quake and the jail began to shake and the stocks came off their legs and the chains fell off the hands and the jailer became fearful for he thought the prisoners would escape and that would mean his life so he was gonna take his own life and Baal said stay your hand don't take your life we're all here and that moved on that jailers heart and he said what must I do to be saved [Music] they said be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and thou in thy old house shall be saved why were they there for him many times we get into situations and and as humans we might think of wonder why does this happen to me why was I'm why am I here this job is terrible why am I on this job there might be somebody there that needs sane there might be somebody there you need to witness to I'm in this grocery line it seems like they're taking all day to get me through why am i standing here you don't know there might be somebody that you can say something to God puts us in situations not only to test us but he puts us in situations to be able to reach friends we've got to find the last seed [Applause] in the bible there was a woman by the name of Naomi and she had two sons and her husband and then there come a famine in the land and they went to the land of mold to try to sustain themselves and her husband died and her two sons took wives and they lived there a while and then the two sons died there was Naomi left with just her and her do daughter-in-law and she told them said look there's no hope here I couldn't can't have no more children my husband's gone there's there's no one to take you go back to your people though the one turn turn law is done go back to your people and then Ruth says those famous words that we quote we hear em at weddings sometimes whether thou goest I will go whether their lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God shall be my god so they journey on and Naomi hears that there is bread for the children in Judah and so they travel to Judah and when they get there they Naomi says that she's not gonna rest until she finds someone for Ruth and says there is a near kinsman here and he can redeem the land the belong to Naomi and take Ruth for a wife so she instructs roots said after your gathering in his field said go and lay down wait till he lays down and once he lays down you lay at his feet and then wait and see what he tells you and so root did is her mother Lloyd told her she went and watched for Boaz and after bull has had had had food and drink then he goes to lay down and as he lays down and goes to sleep then Ruth comes in and lays herself at his feet and at midnight boas realizes there's a woman laying his feet I realized this friends and now it's just Ruth and Naomi and no hope for her from Naomi but at midnight Boaz wakes up and realized there's a woman laying at my feet and so Boaz comes awake and asked her what she's doing and she says throw your skirt over me hallelujah the Almighty takes us under his wing I don't know the gift you know God could come in a body to Abraham and talk to Abraham God could come in a body and be the fourth man in the fire but he had to be born like you and I in order to become our Redeemer he had to be born like all mankind in order to be our kinsman and so in the morning just before morning she rises up and leaves so that no one would know she was there and Boas goes out and he's going to redeem this property that belongs to Naomi and he says there's a nearer kinsman than me and he said first must give him a chance so he goes and he speaks to him and says you need to buy this property of Naomi's and in doing so you must take Ruth to be your wife and so this man says I can't do it unless I Ammar my own inheritance and so he said but you go ahead and do it and so boaz proceeds to go forth with it now I've read the scripture over and over and over and I can't figure out whose shoe it was but somebody took off a shoe and handed it to their neighbor according to the scriptures and it was a sign that they were going to redeem be a kinsman redeemer and so this exchanging of the shoe takes place and then boy it says let it be known that I am purchasing this property that belongs to nil me and in doing so I am purchasing Ruth to be my wife somebody had to redeem us not only that he had to redeem some property it had to redeem the earth because it had fallen into the wrong hands so there was a price that had to be paid it had God had to send someone to buy it back and the only one they could find worthy was the Lion of the tribe of Judah and John turned the Bible says to see and beheld it was a lamb as if it had been slain friends I'm going to tell you something Jesus Christ is a lamb for us and he is a lion for us [Applause] the Bible in the Bible Jesus gives us a parable and says that there were 10 virgin and there were five wise and five foolish and the reason that was fired foolishness because they didn't bring any oil for their lands and so they were waiting and you realize this is a tight of the coming of the Lord it's a type of the Lord coming to get his bride and I'm going to tell you something friends we're living in a dark time we're living in a time when this world is almost that is darkness when the Prophet was here he spoke about a clock that they have up in Chicago I believe is called the Doomsday Clock and it measures according to the the likelihood of destruction by nuclear weapons and at the time brother Brenham said he said they said that it was three minutes to midnight but he said now I believe it maybe one minute to midnight so I don't knows that clock it kind of moves back and forth Thursday as the arms race moves I don't know how close it is to midnight but anyway we're very close to midnight or at a dark time and at midnight the cry went out behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and those that had oil in their lamps trimmed their lamps so that they would burn brighter so they go out to meet the bridegroom and the other five by their fire had burned out and they said give us some of your autumn that we may put in our laps and we know the oil represents the Holy Ghost and from that parable we see that only those that have the Holy Ghost are the ones that's going to go in the rapture the ones that's going to be able to meet the bridegroom and they said give us some of your oil they said not so lest we not have enough but you've got to go buy it from those that sell it look friends you can't give somebody the Holy Ghost they've got to get it the way you got it and there's coming a day when the last one will receive the Holy Ghost and when the last one that last seed receives the Holy Ghost then friends the cry is going to go out it's going to be midnight metaphorically speaking of this world it's going to be midnight and the cry is going to go forth and the dead in Christ are going to rise and those that are live and remain are going to be changed and friends we're going to rise up out of the darkness of this world [Applause] there's a young man in the Bible by the name of you tokus I don't know what was going on in his life I don't know what was taking place the Bible doesn't tell us it doesn't tell us what he might have been going through what he had been facing but you know that as a follower of Jesus he had to be facing some trials he had to be facing some tests there had to be situations that he was in at one time or another which he had to call upon the Lord there had to be some time some dark times in his life because it happens to those that follow the Lord because Satan brings the darkness to try to turn you around Satan brings the darkness on and God allows you to try to hinder you in your walk to try to hinder you in your faith and this young man was sitting in church and they were preaching and about midnight he sails out of the loss and hit the floor dead that a dark time had definitely come in his life because I don't know the Bible doesn't tell us his his account between him and God where he how he was he doesn't tell us whether he was ready to go or not I don't know but this thing I dunno Paul went down and laid himself on the young man and said his life is in him still and the young man came back to life one minute after midnight he was back alive again [Applause] was one time that all was bound as a prisoner and he was on his way to go and stand before Caesar because you know Paul said I'm a I'm a citizen I'm a Roman citizen I have the right to appear before Caesar and so they were taking him and he was bound in chains and they had him and many other prisoners aboard this ship and a great storm arose and it looked like that they weren't going to be able to make it through this storm it was taking the ship and the ship was at the mercy of the waters of the storm and where they were sailing at there were Islands and different things but there was rocks that would tear that ship apart so it looked like all hope was gone and then during the night angel award came and appeared to Paul he said Paul you are going to appear before Caesar and no one aboard this ship is gonna die but here's the thing they've got to stay with the ship and the Bible says that they were the men of the ship were about to abandon the prisoners and they're about to put the boats into the water I boots it into water and abandon the ship and Paul calls him and does him don't don't do that where the angel Lord appeared to me this night and told me that we'll all survive but we've got to stay with the ship I'm gonna tell you something friends I haven't I have watched in the church for I pastor and I've seen other churches and there's people that are abandoning this ship but you've got to stay with the ship brother branham never said God ordained tape recorders to take you and they'll get you ready for the rapture but he said God ordained pastors to lead you through together stay with your pastor the Bible says that at midnight behold they saw an island and they tried to turn the ship toward that island and the ship was coming upon the island and rocks started tearing it apart but every man made it some of them on pieces of the ship as it was torn apart but everyone was safe and you imagine as the Sun rose them there on that island on the we will call the beach of that island and just a few hours before they had been in a hopeless situation but God had sent an angel and had come on the scene and had brought salvation to all those they were aboard in other words they were saved from dying David says at midnight I will rise and give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments now I don't know what you may be going through I don't know what you maybe face but I believe there's someone here is facing a dark time in their life and it's time for delivery master musician the altars open or anyone that needs prayer maybe you're going through facing a dark time
