[27:12] about it sometimes you're in a place
[27:15] maybe where you can't get down on your
[27:17] knees you know and to think about it
[27:21] that it isn't the position of our body
[27:24] we would love to get down on our knees
[27:26] or maybe you like playing praying
[27:28] prostrate or whatever but of how that
[27:32] just in the midst of that time if you
[27:33] think about it like when Solomon he knew
[27:36] he says if I just look to thy holy
[27:39] temple thou will hear from heaven and
[27:42] how our heart is turned into that place
[27:45] and say Lord I need you Lord you're my
[27:49] you're my strength and I tell you he
[27:51] knows exactly that heart our life it
[27:54] finds him and it knows exactly the
[27:56] direct GPS coordinates of his temple it
[28:02] knows it precisely oh my in there and it
[28:06] wonderful it little things like that I
[28:09] know it's very very simple maybe I'm
[28:10] just very simple but those are things
[28:12] that I I find to be so dear and so real
[28:15] in my life that no matter where we are
[28:17] we we have always that comfort that lo I
[28:21] am with you always
[28:23] amen Oh aren't you glad for that tonight
[28:29] we let's go right into the word God
[28:33] blessing musicians thank you
[28:35] Exodus 20:5 I want to turn back and just
[28:38] read a few verses of Scripture tonight
[28:46] I just just request that you you keep me
[28:52] in prayer as we fly out in the morning
[28:54] early and then we start right into the
[28:58] services tomorrow night for the for the
[29:01] youth meeting there in Quebec and all
[29:03] the way into Monday morning with that
[29:05] being the final service so you just just
[29:09] just pray I only asked you to pray for
[29:11] me but let's just pray that God would
[29:13] just just really do something god knows
[29:15] who's gonna be there he knows all of
[29:17] them all of the hearts that are there
[29:19] and and that's that's that's all we want
[29:20] we just want the Lord to be glorified
[29:23] within it all and you know I know in
[29:27] myself I said oh lord help me with
[29:29] strength as well with those services but
[29:33] God God is so mindful isn't he it's so
[29:37] wonderful so good to see each and every
[29:39] one of you tonight man I could just
[29:41] stand here and say that and man it's
[29:45] wonderful isn't it
[29:46] amen you expecting to have a good time
[29:49] tonight amen
[29:52] glory be to God well verse 31 let's
[29:56] start in here reading tonight and thou
[30:01] shalt make a candlestick of pure gold of
[30:05] beaten work shall the candlestick be
[30:09] made his shaft and his branches his
[30:14] bowls
[30:15] his knobs and his flowers she belongs
[30:21] entirely to him this is his it shall be
[30:28] of the same you don't you don't belong
[30:33] to yourself anymore do you you you've
[30:35] been bought with a price you belong to
[30:38] him amen verse 32 and six branches shall
[30:45] come out of the signs of it three
[30:48] branches of the candlestick out of the
[30:51] one side and three branches of the
[30:54] candlestick
[30:55] out of the other side three bowls made
[30:59] like unto almonds with a knob and a
[31:01] flower in one branch and three bowls
[31:03] made like almonds in the other branch
[31:06] with a knob and a flower so in the six
[31:09] branches that come out of the
[31:13] candlestick well what happens if there's
[31:15] a branch that doesn't come out of the
[31:18] candlestick then it doesn't belong to
[31:21] the candlestick because the branches
[31:23] that belong to him come out of him they
[31:26] are born from him amen
[31:31] we're not we're not grafted in by a
[31:34] birth but we are birthed through him and
[31:38] in him amen and in the candlestick shall
[31:43] be four bowls made like unto almonds
[31:46] with their knobs and their flowers let's
[31:50] just bow our heads in a word of prayer
[31:51] and how many like to be remembered
[31:53] tonight in prayer
[31:54] may God bless you god bless your hands
[31:57] Heavenly Father Lord as we come together
[32:01] Lord in this time it's a very precious
[32:04] time for his Lord and father as you see
[32:08] Lord every need Lord even what was
[32:10] before the hands were raised Lord there
[32:13] all across this building Lord and I've
[32:16] got my hands up as well Lord Jesus I
[32:18] have need of you Lord and you know the
[32:21] needs behind the hands and you're the
[32:23] only one Lord that that really can meet
[32:26] it Lord and and the real reality of it
[32:29] is Lord you've already met every need
[32:31] but we just asked you to help us to see
[32:34] through Lord God and to be able just
[32:36] that that would so resonate and drop in
[32:39] our hearts Lord and we pray that when we
[32:41] would leave out of here that we will be
[32:43] able to say my it's been good to be in
[32:45] the house of the Lord and father we know
[32:48] that that'll take more than just us
[32:50] coming in these four walls but dear God
[32:53] it'll take Lord a divine operation it'll
[32:55] be a paradox Lord whereby that you can
[32:58] come and move upon our hearts Lord to
[33:00] where that even though we are setting at
[33:03] the address of 15:30 lake breeze Road
[33:06] but father within our hearts Lord God to
[33:09] be
[33:09] caught up Lord God in heavenly places
[33:12] Lord Jesus father to hear from you and
[33:15] that you would minister to the very
[33:17] needs and desires Lord upon our hearts
[33:20] and our lives Lord we stand in need of
[33:22] you because this is a task that man
[33:24] cannot fulfill so Lord we ask that you
[33:27] help us tonight a speaker and here
[33:29] together that you would just move among
[33:31] us in a very special way Lord
[33:33] ministering to every heart Lord we pray
[33:36] Lord we ask it all for your glory in the
[33:39] name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless
[33:43] yous your being seated amen I want to
[33:49] look there in this in distorted
[33:56] a beaten work to display light you know
[34:01] the more and more when we we look into
[34:04] the Word of God and the more that that
[34:07] I've studied and it's not really the
[34:10] study wood you can do only do so much
[34:12] but it takes inspiration dropping on
[34:15] things from the Lord God beginning to
[34:17] connect everything together and more and
[34:20] more than I look at it I come to even
[34:23] the greater realization and what's very
[34:25] simple but that in it all
[34:28] God is not it's not our abilities that
[34:32] God is after but God simply desires to
[34:37] bring us to a place to where we are so
[34:40] completely yielded in his hand that he's
[34:44] able to just reflect his life so
[34:46] perfectly through us I know that we we
[34:50] look at that and and sometimes we can
[34:52] get the wrong thinking and we look at it
[34:54] and say well you know brother Samuel
[34:56] once I've been born again of the Spirit
[34:58] of God that's the greatest yielding that
[35:00] can take place that yielding then makes
[35:03] way for him to then begin to move in
[35:06] your life and it's like a husband and a
[35:08] wife together to where that a husband
[35:11] himself he is wooing that wife and there
[35:13] is you know many times you look at the
[35:16] at the altar when when when they come
[35:18] together at the altar and things like
[35:20] that but Bream tells us back in I
[35:22] believe it's perfect faith brother brems
[35:23] as you watch how those two before the
[35:26] marriage he said their hearts begin to
[35:28] beat as one
[35:29] so the heart's so there's already an
[35:31] invisible union that has taken place but
[35:34] then you find to where that there is a
[35:36] uniting that takes place at the altar
[35:38] but yet and yet even with the
[35:40] pronunciation of that at the altar and
[35:42] what's been done in the engagement it
[35:43] still does not make them one neither
[35:45] does it make them one entirely to where
[35:48] even as they would they go on their
[35:50] honeymoon and all those things but yet
[35:51] the oneness itself continues to grow it
[35:55] continues to develop because there's
[35:57] ways that you're going to be able to
[35:59] know of this person in the care and
[36:01] everything that's gonna take place
[36:03] there's things that win before you were
[36:05] were married and matter we're just gonna
[36:07] go on this before you were married you
[36:09] know you when there was something you
[36:11] had need of you could talk to mom and
[36:13] dad or talk to someone else but after
[36:15] marriage you find yourself confiding in
[36:17] one another and you find that in the
[36:20] midst of it that the whole ministry is
[36:22] is bringing about that rest and that
[36:25] trust because we have entered into his
[36:27] rest and that's exactly the way that the
[36:29] Lord Jesus ministers to our life it's a
[36:32] it is a ministry that ministers that
[36:34] rest that is we're in that we have
[36:36] ceased from our own works and we're that
[36:38] God Himself is not interested in you and
[36:41] I trying to make the word work but all
[36:45] he wants is us to be surrendered to him
[36:48] because he's the one that brings the
[36:51] word to life and he's the one that
[36:53] brings it to work in our life you say
[36:55] well then what's my part in it yielding
[36:57] you might say well brother Samuel that's
[36:58] simple but it's it's the thing about the
[37:01] yielding is us even sometimes our mind
[37:03] and our thoughts even the way that we
[37:06] think about certain things can actually
[37:08] hinder that he wants us in a place to
[37:10] where there's no timidness or anything
[37:13] about that would pull back in our life
[37:15] but that it would be so so so
[37:18] surrendered to him and if that's what
[37:20] he's calling for that's his desire then
[37:23] it's gonna take him alone to do this and
[37:25] I'll tell you it's not something that
[37:27] we're looking at just in the future but
[37:29] it's something that even right now
[37:30] that's taking place and all across this
[37:33] building all the way through each and
[37:34] every one of us even those that are in
[37:36] invisible audience tonight you could
[37:38] raise your hands and say lord help me to
[37:40] yield more help me just to submit myself
[37:43] more Lord to you and in your presence
[37:46] and it's not just something when we come
[37:47] to church we realize that submission it
[37:50] starts here but yet it keeps on going
[37:52] throughout the day you know it's even
[37:55] throughout the day when there's thoughts
[37:56] can come in your mind may be thoughts
[37:58] against somebody else or or if something
[38:00] can be said or or this or that or the
[38:02] enemy can try to take the word and and
[38:04] you'll try to run you down with the word
[38:06] but it takes in that moment to come back
[38:08] and submit and say no I won't have any
[38:11] of that we are submitting ourselves in
[38:13] the very presence of Jesus Christ
[38:15] because to remember that in the midst of
[38:18] it it is it is a trust that God is
[38:21] moving in our life you know God he takes
[38:24] instruments that he uses but yet God
[38:27] will not force himself in any instrument
[38:30] and you look at each one that God has
[38:32] used down through time all the way from
[38:34] the Old Testament into that of the New
[38:36] Testament it was never a forced
[38:38] operation and then when you think of it
[38:40] how brother branham will talk about a
[38:41] gift within a person's life but the remm
[38:44] says that gift is not like a knife for a
[38:46] person takes and cuts their way into it
[38:48] now you look and you might say well how
[38:51] does that pertain to me because I don't
[38:52] have a ministerial gift but yet each and
[38:54] every one of us are gifted and we have
[38:57] our part within the body of Jesus Christ
[38:59] when you look at how that the tabernacle
[39:02] itself I think I don't know may year ago
[39:04] or so we ministered on this that in the
[39:06] tabernacle there were each one was so
[39:09] divided among the children of Israel to
[39:11] where each one would have a part as far
[39:13] as well among the Levites and the
[39:15] different families that they would have
[39:16] a part that they were designated as the
[39:18] porters of that particular part now that
[39:22] part remembers we looked at it sometimes
[39:24] it's just the define flower
[39:26] their whole part was watching over to
[39:28] make sure there was fine flower then
[39:29] somebody else was watching over to to
[39:32] make sure of the hangings and the
[39:33] curtains and somebody else was making
[39:35] sure that all of the instruments that
[39:38] were to be used that they were clean and
[39:40] made ready each one had their part
[39:43] without one doing their part then you
[39:45] would begin to see a breakdown you would
[39:47] see that the tabernacle itself was not
[39:49] fun
[39:50] chinning in the way that are not a
[39:51] function you begin to lay that pattern
[39:53] down not only for the age but then you
[39:55] bring it from the age you bring it down
[39:57] into every local assembly you bring it
[40:00] down into every family it keeps running
[40:02] the pattern runs all the way through
[40:04] because even in every one of our life
[40:06] there is things that you and I cannot
[40:08] just watch upon one gate we have to be
[40:11] porters upon every gate we have to watch
[40:14] and be ready we can't just be given into
[40:16] one area but we always have to be ready
[40:19] and looking to that of the Lord and you
[40:21] begin to find that how that within it
[40:23] all that every one of us coming back to
[40:26] the thought about if I don't have a gift
[40:27] ministry or gifting me how does that
[40:29] pertain to me because God takes listen
[40:32] to me now God will take a ministerial
[40:34] gift just like he takes that gift that
[40:37] he is sent to a generation which that
[40:39] light that seven star that star that God
[40:42] will sin and God not only is is giving
[40:45] forth his revelation through that
[40:48] ministry but also that ministry is an
[40:51] example of how that God wants to use his
[40:55] children you know it's like this how
[40:57] many of you ever read lyrics to a song
[40:59] and you might have read lyrics to a song
[41:01] and yet you never heard that song and if
[41:04] I called you up here and said come up
[41:05] here and sing the song he ain't even
[41:08] heard it so you wouldn't know how it
[41:10] goes you wouldn't know the tempo of it
[41:12] you wouldn't know that but yet you find
[41:14] somebody who sings that song and you're
[41:17] able to just kind of flow with how
[41:19] they're singing that song well you'd be
[41:21] even Barisan to get up and sing a
[41:22] special after only here in that song one
[41:24] time because even though you start
[41:26] hearing it if the song itself starts to
[41:29] imprint but yet you may not have the
[41:31] melody and the harmony and the tempo and
[41:33] all those things just downright you may
[41:35] not even have your key of how you're
[41:37] going to sing that song just right but
[41:40] nonetheless over time you yourself get
[41:42] to a place to where that you will know
[41:45] that song and feel confident in singing
[41:47] that song I'm going to tell you tonight
[41:49] we've got one song there's been one song
[41:52] of redemption down through the ages and
[41:54] that song in itself each and every one
[41:57] of you have a part in this song and in
[42:00] that part within that song God has one
[42:02] that he will show
[42:04] and begin to remake known his revelation
[42:06] in this generation and you and I can see
[42:09] that and then it will break off from
[42:10] there into other gifts and it keeps on
[42:12] moving down in the body to where that
[42:15] the body itself is so centrally focal I
[42:18] thought centralized focus upon the Lord
[42:21] Jesus Christ to where when you look at
[42:23] him you don't see big eyes you don't see
[42:25] little use all you see is Jesus Christ
[42:28] reflected in bright form what is that
[42:31] that's every gift that is set up on
[42:34] earth you got a gift in your life and
[42:36] that gift that's in your life will
[42:37] declare him to be the same yesterday
[42:40] today and forever you had a gift in your
[42:43] life you didn't know it but there was a
[42:45] drawing that was drawing you to this
[42:47] place of the word where the promise is
[42:50] born in this hour and a gift in your
[42:52] life as it finds its place around the
[42:55] revealed word it's just like that of the
[42:57] wise man it will declare the
[42:59] characteristics of Jesus Christ to be
[43:02] the same yesterday today and forever who
[43:05] is it that brings you into position it
[43:08] is Christ himself working and moving
[43:11] through and by a start not a natural
[43:13] star but a supernatural star it's
[43:17] reflecting his life his image and it
[43:20] brings you and I into position that we
[43:23] might reflect him this is all God's
[43:26] doing it's all his working and so when
[43:28] we're looking at this a beaten work to
[43:31] display life this this this this
[43:33] candelabra was not something that they
[43:36] brought out of Egypt it was not
[43:37] something that they found along the way
[43:39] but remember this is a spiritual pattern
[43:42] that God himself has set forth of this
[43:45] is a part that would be in the
[43:47] tabernacle that God has ordained for the
[43:50] children of Israel that they would make
[43:52] him a sanctuary that he may dwell in the
[43:54] midst of them you find this this over
[43:57] here to where that in the book of
[43:59] Zechariah it speaks of it and I'm not
[44:01] going to read from the scriptures we did
[44:03] last week but you find of how that God
[44:05] shows this right here almost in the
[44:08] middle of the Bible he shows it and then
[44:11] you find out that God here it is he
[44:13] picks it up clear over in the Book of
[44:15] Revelations because
[44:16] all the way through all God has desired
[44:20] to do all God's desire is to Tabernacle
[44:24] inside of man and it's God's desire to
[44:26] reflect his life it's God that
[44:29] accomplishes what he has said you
[44:32] realize any overcoming any victory in
[44:35] our life has not been because you and I
[44:37] have will have taken something boy I've
[44:39] taken the word and I but you're taking
[44:41] of the word if will phrase it that way
[44:43] it's not actually you handling the word
[44:46] member a gift is not like a knife to cut
[44:48] your way into it but the real taking of
[44:51] the word is where you've submitted and
[44:53] the words took hold of you and the word
[44:55] begins to work and move through your
[44:57] life and through it all it's God himself
[44:59] getting the glory all that he asks for
[45:02] us is healed
[45:03] that's it so here Zachariah you know is
[45:07] is is catching this of the candlestick
[45:11] and and he catches of a candlestick with
[45:14] gold and seven lamps that there would be
[45:16] there in in a bowl that's on top of it
[45:19] and held that there would be seven pipes
[45:20] to the seven lamps and remember he's
[45:22] asked he the angel asked him what is
[45:25] this and and zechariah being a true
[45:28] prophet of god he you know even though a
[45:30] prophet is given to be able to interpret
[45:32] but a prophet himself does not have the
[45:34] ability in himself to interpret but he
[45:37] receives one from god who's able to tell
[45:40] him this is what this means is that
[45:43] right think of how the prophet was
[45:45] setting there when the seven seals
[45:46] themselves were at work to be open and
[45:49] remember as he said i've set myself
[45:50] apart within this room and how that the
[45:53] angels were coming there day after day
[45:55] after day he himself look at this he was
[45:58] getting ready to take old context that
[46:01] he had preached from before but God
[46:03] himself brought a stop to an aren't you
[46:06] glad that there are things that maybe
[46:07] you've wanted to take old context you've
[46:10] wanted to take old things but aren't you
[46:12] thankful that you are in contact with
[46:14] that of the angels of the Lord because
[46:16] you are seated in Christ and the angels
[46:19] of God ascending descend on this access
[46:22] and it's there that Christ Himself is
[46:25] able to minister and the context that
[46:27] you used to look at you
[46:29] believe used to act by that Christ
[46:30] Himself comes down and says no we're not
[46:32] going that context any longer aren't you
[46:35] glad how can that be how could that be
[46:39] because you have one that is ordained to
[46:43] receive that
[46:43] oh my think of this how that Zechariah
[46:46] when he when he is he this has made
[46:49] known to him of what this is the angel
[46:52] that that came to him begin to let him
[46:54] know this is what this candelabra this
[46:56] is what this means the seven can the
[46:59] candlestick and it's seven lamps
[47:01] it is not by might not by power but by
[47:04] my spirit saith the Lord of hosts
[47:07] o my very important not just safe the
[47:10] Lord says the Lord of hosts
[47:12] because in there is an encompass meant
[47:15] of this among the believers oh my now I
[47:19] look at this and I think about it of how
[47:21] that within this it's speaking that as
[47:24] brother Branham puts it like this he
[47:26] said what the angel was speaking to
[47:28] Zechariah he was saying to him that
[47:31] there is nothing that can be done by the
[47:34] church outside of me it has to be Christ
[47:38] is that right he says this is what you
[47:41] see means that the church cannot
[47:44] accomplish anything by its own might or
[47:47] power but by the Holy Ghost so you see
[47:50] the whole working of the Holy Ghost even
[47:52] after you and I have been born again of
[47:55] the Spirit of God this working of the
[47:57] Holy Spirit through the word is bringing
[48:00] us to that realization and you know what
[48:02] God will allow you and I sometimes to
[48:04] try things on our own might he'll allow
[48:06] us to try it on our own power
[48:08] he will allow us to try to do things on
[48:10] our own and it comes to naught you say
[48:13] well I'm trying to do this according to
[48:15] the word but are you doing it by your
[48:16] might are you taking a hold of the word
[48:19] by your power or is it the word taking a
[48:22] hold of you there's a great difference
[48:26] because with the word itself remember
[48:28] there were many who rose up before the
[48:31] Lord Jesus himself and they led many
[48:33] people astray out in the desert is that
[48:36] right there are many Moses himself tried
[48:38] to take a promise and he put his own
[48:41] might and his own power
[48:42] or behind it but did it work it did not
[48:45] but what would enough happening is Moses
[48:47] was frustrated and said how to
[48:49] understand this of course not because it
[48:51] is not Moses strength that was to
[48:54] deliver the children of Israel it was
[48:56] not Moses who made the promise God made
[48:59] the promise and God who made the promise
[49:01] is the glove to come on the scene at his
[49:04] ordained time and God Himself will make
[49:08] that promise come to life and come to
[49:10] pass glory be to God what an assurance
[49:14] that we have in him amen this is where
[49:18] that when we look at this here that the
[49:21] oil itself is drawing out of the two
[49:23] trees and the Prophet will place it like
[49:25] this he'll speak to those two trees as
[49:27] we looked at it last week of the old and
[49:29] new Testament then then as he moves on
[49:31] down in a further part in Zechariah that
[49:33] the two anointed ones the Prophet will
[49:35] pick it up there after the seals are
[49:37] open you'll say these two are the two
[49:39] witnesses that are to go into Israel
[49:42] anointed of the Lord and you look at it
[49:44] remember we said scriptures have a
[49:45] compound meaning and when you look at
[49:47] and that Israel themselves does not
[49:50] receive a different experience than what
[49:52] you and I received remember it's only
[49:54] the elect of God that can actually be
[49:56] born again or be sealed because when God
[50:00] seals you it is God's stamp of his life
[50:03] his insignia we are sealed away in him
[50:07] he is saying this belongs to me so the
[50:10] same word now that has taken place down
[50:13] through the Gentile ages for some 2000
[50:15] years over seven over seven Church ages
[50:18] that same God will rise up anointing two
[50:20] men with the Spirit of Moses and Elijah
[50:22] and they will go forth with the same
[50:25] message that remember was ministered
[50:28] here on the true baptism of the Holy
[50:30] Ghost coming forth from the true
[50:32] atonement which is Christ himself and
[50:35] that ministry will call them from
[50:37] traditions of offering this animal and
[50:39] offering this animal don't you see where
[50:41] this is at that the Ministry of Moses
[50:44] and Elijah coming in that time what the
[50:46] seventh trumpet is to them is the same
[50:48] thing the seventh seal is to you and I
[50:50] where Christ Himself these seven seal
[50:53] stepping out of
[50:54] book he has given meaning to the history
[50:58] of what has taken place all the way down
[51:01] we're not just referring to the
[51:02] scripture as stories and history we see
[51:05] it as tides we see it that it spoke of
[51:09] Christ we see that it speaks of us so it
[51:12] is not something to where we just remain
[51:14] in that it actually comes to reality in
[51:17] moose from type 2 Anna type who alone
[51:20] can move the word from types to Anna
[51:22] types Christ verse nobody else can do it
[51:24] but Christ himself you say well how can
[51:26] that be because it must be Christ that
[51:29] will move it from a type to an Anna type
[51:31] because the Anna type is Christ himself
[51:34] coming in the midst of his word to
[51:36] fulfill that word and make it live and
[51:39] when it is Christ it will always glorify
[51:43] God any so called Anna type that doesn't
[51:50] glorify God is false it's not a true
[51:53] Anna type hmm so you've got to look at
[51:57] the type and then you'll see the Anna
[51:58] type and when you see the Anna type it
[52:01] brings the type to life what are you
[52:04] saying
[52:04] but I'm saying we're drawing oil from
[52:07] the old and from the new although the
[52:09] Holy Ghost itself would move in the old
[52:11] it would move upon prophets of old it
[52:14] would move upon David David said take
[52:16] not thy Holy Spirit from me but remember
[52:18] there they could not because the
[52:19] atonement had not been offered it could
[52:21] not actually grab ahold to bring a
[52:24] quickening a new birth not whereby that
[52:27] only bat can come through the offering
[52:29] of of the true atonement which is the
[52:31] Lord Jesus Christ but yet the Holy
[52:33] Spirit moved there it spoke and it gave
[52:36] witness of this coming time even when
[52:39] you look at Solomon's Assembly when
[52:41] Solomon was preparing to dedicate the
[52:44] temple remember here David was not known
[52:46] by God you can't do it it's gonna be
[52:49] your son that will build this tabernacle
[52:51] and when Solomon is moved under under
[52:54] the direction and the pattern where did
[52:56] the pattern come from the pattern was
[52:58] handed from David the Bible said David
[53:00] communicated the pattern by the spirit
[53:03] on to Solomon oh this pattern was not
[53:06] just handed down three courts and here
[53:08] in there
[53:08] you see the Old Testament itself it
[53:11] speaks of the coming of the Messiah it
[53:13] speaks of the new birth
[53:15] it speaks of this time of God himself
[53:18] coming to indwell in his children and it
[53:20] speaks of the catching away
[53:22] it speaks of God's redemptive work not
[53:25] only among the Gentiles but God's
[53:26] restorative work to bring Israel back to
[53:29] her rightful place Oh My glory be to God
[53:32] don't you love him so to think of how
[53:35] that within all of this it's God working
[53:41] it's God moving it's God performing his
[53:47] word so it's everything itself nothing's
[53:50] out of time all all the same no we're
[53:52] we're so behind that no we're not we're
[53:55] right on time you see that top pattern
[54:00] can actually hinder you yielding anybody
[54:05] ever got nervous
[54:06] I don't ask you raise your head because
[54:08] you can praise your feet too when you
[54:10] get nervous about something or anxious
[54:12] about something it's like right then
[54:14] this becomes a fog they're right I need
[54:19] to think about this on what I want to do
[54:20] in this but lord I mercy don't put us in
[54:22] a crunch situation
[54:23] oh brother send up save it save it save
[54:29] it
[54:29] you're still flesh too but it's there
[54:33] when we get into though into those times
[54:35] it actually can remove us from yielding
[54:38] but you see God his desire is remember
[54:41] that we would be in arrests of that we
[54:44] can yield yielding being sensitive to
[54:49] his voice because it's him that's
[54:52] bringing this word to pass oh my so to
[54:55] think of this of how that in the midst
[54:58] of it we find here in the Book of
[55:00] Revelations
[55:00] tchau chapter 1 verse 12 here is John
[55:03] John's in the midst of this time and
[55:05] here he is on the Isle of Patmos and the
[55:08] Bible says that here that John remember
[55:11] he heard behind him was that lack of a
[55:13] trumpet that was that was speaking and
[55:16] John the Bible says in verse 12 I turned
[55:20] to see the voice
[55:22] so the trumpet it wasn't just of just a
[55:25] sound but the trumpet it had a meaning
[55:27] within it it was actually a voice so
[55:31] John is speaking this voice it held
[55:33] something of an order for his life like
[55:36] there's certain key things that maybe
[55:38] your mom would say and that would be
[55:39] different from my mom and she'd say
[55:41] certain things you would have a cue
[55:43] about that of knowing what to do you you
[55:45] see it's like a trumpet that's sounding
[55:47] you say but it's a mean you don't know
[55:49] she can sound like well we won't go
[55:52] there but a nun nonetheless it is a
[55:55] voice that will that rings out and here
[55:58] John himself notice what he said John
[56:00] said that I turned to see the voice that
[56:04] spake with me and once you catch this I
[56:07] can't deal with this a lot tonight but
[56:09] this voice it was a voice that here it
[56:12] was uttering it was going forth but yet
[56:15] it had signification it had meaning to
[56:19] John and John turned to see the voice
[56:22] that spake unto him and when he being
[56:25] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[56:28] don't you realize that to even turn to
[56:31] the voice is turning from the direction
[56:33] you're glowing and turning to the voice
[56:35] of one who is calling you the voice of
[56:38] one who is speaking to your life if you
[56:40] if you keep looking another way and
[56:41] somebody's talking to you that's very
[56:44] disrespectful but when somebody's
[56:46] talking to you and you know they're
[56:47] talking to you
[56:48] what do you do you turn to them you
[56:51] acknowledge them and there's got to be
[56:53] something of an interest and this has a
[56:55] personal interest to John's life just
[56:58] like the ministering of the Word of God
[57:01] by the Holy Spirit
[57:03] it holds meaning to our lives there can
[57:06] be a lot of things that could maybe
[57:08] delight us or interest little hobbies or
[57:10] something that we have but nothing
[57:12] should have more meaning nothing should
[57:15] have a greater resounding call upon our
[57:17] life than the voice of the Lord Jesus
[57:19] Christ I'm not just talking about when
[57:21] you surrendered your heart to God I'm
[57:23] not just talking about when God cleans
[57:25] your life up I'm not just talking about
[57:27] how to where when he himself filled you
[57:29] with the Holy Ghost I am
[57:31] if all of that has taken place then he
[57:33] should still have the preeminent voice
[57:36] of our life it should still be his voice
[57:39] that is preeminent above every other
[57:41] voice cause every other voice that comes
[57:44] around is a voice that will try to
[57:46] confuse you it's a voice that will try
[57:48] to upset you
[57:49] it's a voice that does not have any
[57:51] message or mystery about your life but
[57:55] the one who holds the mystery of our
[57:57] life the one that has a real message for
[58:00] our life is the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:02] himself but remember if you get too busy
[58:06] you can't hear his voice because his
[58:09] voice is not a earthquake his voice is
[58:12] not fire his voice is still small voice
[58:25] God was letting the Elijah know come
[58:28] back to stillness watch how God worked
[58:30] with Elijah when Elijah was all tore up
[58:32] God didn't come out there - Elijah
[58:34] Elijah what in the world are you doing
[58:36] here
[58:36] open of the Samuel he did say what do us
[58:38] now here yes h EA r what do you hear
[58:42] right what do you hear he's talking with
[58:48] Elijah but he's not demanding of the
[58:50] Elijah you see he's bringing him back
[58:53] into a place even though Elijah is the
[58:55] prophet of God even though in Elijah is
[58:58] to be used by God even though there's
[59:00] more for him to do he can't be taken off
[59:03] the scene brother joy until he's
[59:05] anointed Elijah but yet God cannot force
[59:09] him he's got to be yielded so God didn't
[59:15] speak to him in a earthquake fire it's
[59:19] still small voice why call me it looked
[59:24] like he was calm already because he was
[59:25] tucked in away in a cave no he was all
[59:27] anxious and all tore up and I'm the only
[59:31] one you see he was having a pity party
[59:32] I'm the only one ah it's just me I maybe
[59:38] I like feeling alone well I'm gonna tell
[59:41] you right now if the thought comes to
[59:42] you I'm the only one
[59:44] you know that's not of God because
[59:48] you're not alone there is a many
[59:50] membered body glory be to God don't you
[59:54] let that be an excuse don't let the
[59:56] devil put that in your mind or in your
[59:58] heart well I'll tell you what I really
[1:00:00] work sir God if I had more know that
[1:00:03] it's not runs required what's required
[1:00:04] is letting go and letting him and you
[1:00:07] can look at it and say God if I'm here
[1:00:10] in this circumstance if I'm here in this
[1:00:12] moment then your steal God how can I
[1:00:15] talk about God being a God of the line
[1:00:18] god of the bear and then I look at
[1:00:20] Goliath and say I don't know about this
[1:00:22] but he's the same God he's the same God
[1:00:26] either he's the same or he's not but
[1:00:30] remember he will not override our will
[1:00:35] now this is the mystery sometimes you
[1:00:38] look at and you think well sometimes I
[1:00:41] pretend - no you know God did things for
[1:00:43] me and Here I am still praying about it
[1:00:45] and you know I don't even think I need I
[1:00:47] didn't think I had the faith for it I
[1:00:48] was still praying god help my faith to
[1:00:50] rise and here I come to find out the
[1:00:52] promise is already fulfilled it's
[1:00:53] because faith itself is not a mental
[1:00:55] intellectual substance but faith itself
[1:00:59] is a subconscious working faith itself
[1:01:02] is a revelation from God come on now
[1:01:05] every one of us have had faith like
[1:01:07] brother Graham talks about and works of
[1:01:08] faith Express trying to work ourselves
[1:01:10] up into a healing or work ourselves up
[1:01:12] into something else but yet we all find
[1:01:15] out that's all our power
[1:01:16] that's all our my but the Spirit of God
[1:01:18] sovereignly can drop a little word in
[1:01:20] our heart that's all it takes
[1:01:22] it's all it takes once he's dropped that
[1:01:24] it's over it's something that has been
[1:01:27] ignited within us and we begin to
[1:01:29] reflect what has been ignited that
[1:01:31] promise within our hearts so then when
[1:01:34] we're looking at this here we find that
[1:01:37] how that God will will move in the midst
[1:01:40] of this time and here years standing in
[1:01:42] verse 13 in the midst of the seven
[1:01:45] candlesticks one like unto the Son of
[1:01:48] man so here he is in this vision so the
[1:01:51] voice that's speaking to him is one who
[1:01:54] is likened to the Son of man standing in
[1:01:56] the midst
[1:01:57] the candlesticks and I remember the
[1:01:59] candlesticks look at how that it would
[1:02:01] speak of the plurality here but yet it
[1:02:03] only is truly one there's one beaten
[1:02:06] work they are all of one of the same but
[1:02:09] it is Christ himself that is actually
[1:02:12] the one who he is drawn to its Christ
[1:02:15] one like unto the Son of man in that
[1:02:18] that he sees walking in the midst of the
[1:02:20] seven golden candlesticks is that right
[1:02:23] here clothed with the garment down to
[1:02:26] the foot and Girt about the paps with a
[1:02:28] golden girdle what is this this is
[1:02:30] Christ in bride for me this is Christ
[1:02:34] dwelling in the midst of his church
[1:02:36] because remember here the atonement the
[1:02:39] offering was offered up is that right
[1:02:41] there had to be an offering up
[1:02:43] touch-me-not I've not yet ascended then
[1:02:45] he has since then his sins up comes back
[1:02:47] down walks among forty days on the earth
[1:02:50] with the disciples and so forth
[1:02:52] available proofs instructed them in the
[1:02:54] kingdom and then here after he has spoke
[1:02:57] to them they're on Mount Olivet notice
[1:02:58] he ascends up the Bible says that there
[1:03:01] were many who saw him ascend up and then
[1:03:03] in the Book of Luke it says they
[1:03:04] returned back to their to Jerusalem with
[1:03:07] joy because there was a certainty that
[1:03:09] the promise now that had been spoken now
[1:03:12] that promise they were returning with
[1:03:15] joy to believe that that promise is for
[1:03:17] me I am part of that promise I've seen
[1:03:19] the resurrection now I myself can be a
[1:03:22] partaker of that resurrection not just
[1:03:24] somebody who witnesses about it but
[1:03:26] somebody who's a real witness of the
[1:03:28] resurrection where he himself raises you
[1:03:31] from death unto life so when we look at
[1:03:34] this it is the very Ministry then of
[1:03:36] Christ himself as our high priest that
[1:03:39] he himself after he's offered up here
[1:03:42] he's ascended they're up before the
[1:03:44] Father here before they go to Pentecost
[1:03:45] and then at the day of Pentecost here
[1:03:48] comes the very Ministry of the high
[1:03:50] priest himself there was a changing of
[1:03:53] the priesthood and here he begins to
[1:03:55] minister the promise that pertains to
[1:03:58] the children of God what's he doing he
[1:04:00] is gathering his body
[1:04:02] that's upon earth his children his seed
[1:04:05] he's gathering them by his word he's
[1:04:07] induct
[1:04:08] them into his body so then it is his
[1:04:13] life his branches his knots his flowers
[1:04:17] his his his his and she gladly gladly
[1:04:22] loves to be identified in him yeah this
[1:04:27] is his Gloria
[1:04:28] it is his righteous not mine it's his
[1:04:31] yeah I don't want to be found having my
[1:04:34] own righteousness that's to miss it but
[1:04:36] to have his righteousness or glory be to
[1:04:40] God
[1:04:40] so here when you find that how that John
[1:04:43] himself here this is may known and
[1:04:45] revealed to John here you find that in
[1:04:48] this revelation and my we could really
[1:04:50] deal with this a lot but you begin to
[1:04:52] see that here is John cut away within
[1:04:54] this time and and what you find you find
[1:04:56] a principle that's all encompassing that
[1:04:59] any vision or anything of the word
[1:05:02] listen to me now any voice you know you
[1:05:06] got a try for spirit you're with me now
[1:05:08] you see anything anything that does not
[1:05:13] exalt Jesus Christ now let me let me go
[1:05:16] on now that does not exalt Jesus Christ
[1:05:19] to be the Lord of all the Almighty God
[1:05:23] the Redeemer that does not exalt him
[1:05:27] into that place that does not keep him
[1:05:29] the center of what it is that we're
[1:05:32] thinking we're feeling or whatever voice
[1:05:34] is talking to us listen to me now it
[1:05:36] doesn't matter even if it is scriptures
[1:05:39] that's coming to us we don't discern it
[1:05:42] by the scriptures you discern it by the
[1:05:44] voice behind it how do i discern the
[1:05:46] voice because the voice itself cannot
[1:05:49] cannot diminish the very character and
[1:05:52] life of Jesus Christ now you might look
[1:05:55] at the word that's coming to you and say
[1:05:57] yep this lines up exactly with the black
[1:05:59] and white but the actual motive and
[1:06:02] objective behind it can be as ranked and
[1:06:04] as foul as a possum as a poke at it can
[1:06:07] be so bad why because it's the motive
[1:06:10] and objective what's behind it you with
[1:06:14] me that matters a lot because what we
[1:06:16] offer up to God dogs are looking at so
[1:06:18] much what we offer he's looking at what
[1:06:21] what's behind it so this is where
[1:06:24] anything that doesn't exalt Jesus Christ
[1:06:27] now I'm talking about exalt him in the
[1:06:30] midst of our life do you realize that
[1:06:32] even when the Spirit of God deals with
[1:06:34] our hearts to repent or to make
[1:06:36] something right do you realize when we
[1:06:38] submit to that that is exalting Jesus
[1:06:41] Christ in his rightful position because
[1:06:43] you are saying no sir I will not give
[1:06:46] this place in my heart I will not give
[1:06:49] it place in my mind I will not allow
[1:06:51] this to control me or dictate my actions
[1:06:54] anymore I want Christ to have the sinner
[1:06:58] you realize this is important now you
[1:07:00] said Lord I want you to do that but
[1:07:03] remember not by power not by might but
[1:07:05] by my spirit saith the Lord so you walk
[1:07:11] the spirit to move you got to come back
[1:07:13] in corn into the word to come back
[1:07:15] according to the word it's much deeper
[1:07:16] than just the print you've got to come
[1:07:18] back to the character who with now
[1:07:22] notice this here everything else if it
[1:07:25] doesn't how did the Prophet tell us very
[1:07:27] simply and Christ the mystery over and
[1:07:29] over and over any revelation that
[1:07:33] doesn't bring this revelation to light
[1:07:36] it's false it's got to be Christ all the
[1:07:41] way through old and new Testament what
[1:07:45] are these two trees standing on either
[1:07:47] side see it's giving life you know you
[1:07:51] can look back in your life and we look
[1:07:53] back and see where Rebecca's life we
[1:07:55] look back and see in Esther's life we
[1:07:57] look back what are we looking at we're
[1:07:58] looking at the flow of oil that's coming
[1:08:00] down through the Old Testament types of
[1:08:03] those lives even though they may not
[1:08:05] have prophetically said something but
[1:08:07] their life left left out and resounded
[1:08:10] prophecy in its life is that right what
[1:08:14] is it that's all you're traveling down
[1:08:16] from the Old Testament right when the
[1:08:19] Lord Jesus walked with them on Luke 24
[1:08:21] he stepped out from the side of the road
[1:08:23] and he begin to take those things that
[1:08:26] beginning with Moses things concerning
[1:08:28] himself are you talking about a meeting
[1:08:30] he preached a message called the mystery
[1:08:32] of history and he
[1:08:34] shall he begin to go through and
[1:08:35] identify himself in the scripture my man
[1:08:42] who glory each moment so look at how
[1:08:46] that this revelation it will always I
[1:08:49] want you to catch this now it'll always
[1:08:50] exalt Jesus Christ this is why we must
[1:08:56] bring every thought into subjection
[1:08:59] every thought into the obedience of
[1:09:02] Christ the Bible goes on it talks about
[1:09:06] this condensation I I'm just gonna move
[1:09:09] on for sake of time it talks about this
[1:09:10] condensation in Hebrews 2 it comes to
[1:09:14] that place to where that he here he
[1:09:15] himself now is not ashamed to call them
[1:09:19] brethren in verse 11 and he says I will
[1:09:22] declare thy name unto my brethren in the
[1:09:25] midst of the church while I sing praise
[1:09:27] unto thee O glory in the midst of the
[1:09:31] church this is the same thing that he he
[1:09:34] said in Psalms 22 22 I will declare thy
[1:09:37] name unto my brethren in the midst of
[1:09:40] the congregation will I praise thee the
[1:09:43] name is is his life I've come in my
[1:09:45] father's name his life the expression of
[1:09:48] that life here he is declaring that name
[1:09:51] what's he declared he's declaring that
[1:09:54] that name is meant not only the same
[1:09:57] name but that name is the same power
[1:09:59] that was there and lived in our Lord
[1:10:02] Jesus Christ that same power now is
[1:10:04] released back to the Church of the
[1:10:06] Living God he's singing praise notice
[1:10:09] the Bible said singing praise and when
[1:10:11] you begin to look that up and study it
[1:10:13] you realize the phrasing that is used
[1:10:15] under inspiration that Paul would catch
[1:10:17] it is a hymn that is sung that a hymn
[1:10:20] that is being declared and hailed to the
[1:10:23] victor hail to the victor this song that
[1:10:26] the Messiah that Christ Himself is
[1:10:29] singing and declaring in the church is
[1:10:31] that I am the mighty Conqueror that I
[1:10:34] have conquered at all that I am to
[1:10:37] deliver that I am the one he is
[1:10:40] declaring
[1:10:41] is victory and how can he declare his
[1:10:44] victory he declares his victory through
[1:10:46] the vessels that he has purchased with
[1:10:49] his blood that he has called that he has
[1:10:51] sanctified and he feels them with his
[1:10:54] life and he takes a lot to where the
[1:10:56] Prophet said a woman to where the dogs
[1:10:59] would not even Hal her name but the
[1:11:01] power of God comes down and raises up
[1:11:03] her life what is that
[1:11:05] that's the manifestation of his victory
[1:11:08] its Christ singing in your life he's
[1:11:11] singing the song hail the victor hail
[1:11:14] the victor hail the victor glory be to
[1:11:19] God he's singing his song glory be to
[1:11:25] God so we notice here he is in the midst
[1:11:29] of the congregation now remember this is
[1:11:34] his rightful place is it right
[1:11:36] this is his rightful place but in order
[1:11:39] to come into the midst of the
[1:11:42] congregation speaking of his people of
[1:11:44] your life my life to come in the midst
[1:11:48] of it to be the center to be the head of
[1:11:51] that he himself who was the head was the
[1:11:55] greatest Almighty God went and became
[1:11:58] the lost welcomed in Suncheon
[1:12:03] he cloned and send it down to do what
[1:12:07] what was this about you know how the
[1:12:10] scriptures portray what love God had
[1:12:12] commended on us when we were yet sinners
[1:12:14] Christ died for us first John chapter 4
[1:12:16] how did his love God projected his love
[1:12:20] to us there then while we were yet
[1:12:22] sinners yet he loved us what expressed
[1:12:25] his love not just that he came down but
[1:12:27] that he gave himself I had power to lay
[1:12:31] my life down in power to raise it up as
[1:12:33] the Good Shepherd of the sheep fold he
[1:12:35] laid his life down not for the goats for
[1:12:41] the Sheep there'll be some that benefit
[1:12:45] of that but they can never become sheep
[1:12:47] but the sheep or why he came
[1:12:52] oh ma look at--look friends look at the
[1:12:55] grace of God if there if there was no
[1:12:57] fall in the beginning there would have
[1:12:58] been millions of people that would have
[1:13:01] never been born you with me if it had
[1:13:04] just been what was there at that moment
[1:13:06] it would have only been the elect of God
[1:13:09] that would have been populated upon the
[1:13:10] earth but notice the grace of God so
[1:13:13] moves into such a place to where His
[1:13:15] grace is so great remember how Paul
[1:13:17] talks about his grace abounds His grace
[1:13:20] spills over into the book of life you
[1:13:23] with me now notice this here he is in
[1:13:26] the midst of the congregation he can't
[1:13:28] take this by force he takes this by love
[1:13:32] he Woo's you and I to himself but he
[1:13:37] doesn't all of a sudden pounce out after
[1:13:39] and say ha ha I got you know that's a
[1:13:41] deceiver well he does he Woo's us and he
[1:13:46] don't stop wooing us
[1:13:47] he keeps ruinous keeps wooing us keeps
[1:13:51] fooling us he's wooing us Oh Samuel that
[1:13:54] sounds like a happy marriage oh yes it
[1:13:56] is absolutely it's a happy marriage he's
[1:13:59] wooing us along he doesn't want us doing
[1:14:01] something out of fear out of timidness
[1:14:03] and I can't because you know what that
[1:14:05] restricts the flow of his life if it's
[1:14:08] out of fear oh I've gotta do this huh
[1:14:10] boy I've got at noon you can come in so
[1:14:12] tight and so tensed up he can't move at
[1:14:14] all all of a sudden you just don't
[1:14:17] understand what kind of a day that I've
[1:14:19] had you don't understand it but I'm sure
[1:14:21] every round throughout this assembly
[1:14:23] here we've all had days like that and
[1:14:24] you know sometimes it's been on the
[1:14:26] Sunday morning but things didn't go just
[1:14:27] right you put on the shirt that had the
[1:14:30] stain on the pocket didn't realize it
[1:14:31] you know what I mean or the toast got
[1:14:34] burner this happened or that happened
[1:14:35] you know but look what's all that is
[1:14:38] it's the enemy to try to get you to
[1:14:40] tighten up to where that God Himself is
[1:14:44] not able to flow through your life do
[1:14:48] you realize what that means Satan is
[1:14:50] scared he's scared that you and I offer
[1:14:54] if they yield my if they get yielded and
[1:14:57] they yield to him I won't have nothing
[1:14:59] to do he's afraid of yielding
[1:15:04] yeah because he knows what standing
[1:15:07] behind this set in a trickle of water
[1:15:10] brother this is a power gig
[1:15:13] come on now we're not living off drops
[1:15:16] we're living from the Fountain of Life
[1:15:18] there is a fountain that is open in the
[1:15:22] house of David let me tell you something
[1:15:24] model is that speaking for Israel but
[1:15:27] remember you are that tabernacle you are
[1:15:30] that temple that was spoke up in the
[1:15:32] book of Acts here you are raised up
[1:15:34] because he hath put you together you are
[1:15:38] ordained as stones into this body lord
[1:15:45] have mercy
[1:15:46] let's look at this order of the lighting
[1:15:49] a little bit look at this order of the
[1:15:52] lighting now let's kind of move from
[1:15:54] here where he moves in the midst of our
[1:15:56] lives what's how this says in numbers 8
[1:15:58] verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:16:01] saying speak unto Aaron remember who
[1:16:05] Aaron is he's a hot feast and say unto
[1:16:08] Him when thou lightest the lamps the
[1:16:12] seven lamps shall give light over
[1:16:15] against the candlestick now notice this
[1:16:19] is just not something that's just you
[1:16:23] light them how you feel like Latin
[1:16:25] America's the high priest is given
[1:16:28] orders this is how your tool item it's
[1:16:33] not just any way not just any fire there
[1:16:37] is a way and the real true way is that
[1:16:45] as it says in the last the seven lamps
[1:16:47] shall give light over against the
[1:16:51] candlestick remember without the
[1:16:54] candlestick there is no seven lamps are
[1:16:57] you with me without the candlestick
[1:17:00] there are no seven lamps without the
[1:17:03] Lord Jesus Christ there are no seven
[1:17:05] messengers there are there is there is
[1:17:10] no there is no seven churches without
[1:17:12] Christ
[1:17:15] so without him none of this would be
[1:17:18] because it's his branches his schnapps
[1:17:20] it's his ministers it's his children
[1:17:23] it's his body his his his his his and
[1:17:29] the seven Lance shall give not made give
[1:17:33] light over against the candle stick and
[1:17:40] Aaron did so he lighted the lamps
[1:17:45] thereof over against the candlestick as
[1:17:47] the LORD commanded Moses so he lighted
[1:17:51] them now the question is I know some of
[1:17:54] this is review but still it's it's good
[1:17:56] so look at how the Lord will take us
[1:17:57] through it how where does he get the
[1:18:00] fire from you know that so that that's a
[1:18:02] very important thing where he gets the
[1:18:04] fire from if it's a man-made constructed
[1:18:06] fire this won't work remember God is
[1:18:09] laying a type here that is to be
[1:18:11] fulfilled in an anti-type it's not them
[1:18:13] getting together and bajate you would
[1:18:14] hear you you rub these two parts
[1:18:16] together and I'll tell you what does
[1:18:17] bill you you go over there and get some
[1:18:19] newspapers huh I'll tell you what you'll
[1:18:20] get some little twigs and then we got it
[1:18:22] we got to get this fire going no this
[1:18:24] was not a fire that man had to get going
[1:18:26] this was not a fire that they had to
[1:18:28] work up are you with me they couldn't be
[1:18:33] fire they might have been able to do
[1:18:35] this and do that and and do that but yet
[1:18:37] this fire itself in order to light these
[1:18:40] candlesticks had to be a fire that came
[1:18:43] from the presence of Almighty God notice
[1:18:46] this in Leviticus chapter 9 verse 23 and
[1:18:48] Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle
[1:18:50] the congregation that came out and
[1:18:52] blessed the people and the glory of the
[1:18:54] Lord appeared unto all the people notice
[1:18:57] the glory of the Lord appeared unto the
[1:19:00] people and there came out a fire out
[1:19:03] from before the Lord his presence his
[1:19:07] person there came out of fire this was
[1:19:11] not an earthly man-made fire so this is
[1:19:16] not anything that can be worked up and
[1:19:20] it consumed upon the altar the burnt
[1:19:24] offering and the fat which when all the
[1:19:27] people saw they
[1:19:28] crowded and fell on their faces what
[1:19:32] took place on Calvary God Himself
[1:19:37] consumed the sacrifice he shall see his
[1:19:42] soul and shall pleasure when he had made
[1:19:48] his soul an offering for sin remember
[1:19:52] even when the widow of Zarephath when
[1:19:55] she spoke to by the prophet Elijah make
[1:19:58] me a cake first she has two little
[1:20:01] sticks and she puts them sticks together
[1:20:05] to make a fire those two sticks
[1:20:08] represent Calvary it was fire on and on
[1:20:12] you see this through the scripture that
[1:20:13] the fire itself this is not something
[1:20:15] that is new or strange to the believers
[1:20:18] it's fire God has many different places
[1:20:20] to where that fire itself will come
[1:20:22] right out of the rock many different
[1:20:25] places to where even the fire itself was
[1:20:27] in a bush and yet it didn't consume the
[1:20:29] bush in that amazing same way the fire
[1:20:32] is inside of you it's consumed a part of
[1:20:34] you but yet here it is it lives and
[1:20:36] manifests itself still within this bush
[1:20:41] glory be to God
[1:20:43] oma think of this it could not be a
[1:20:46] strange fire remember when those I
[1:20:49] believe it was about you and they dad
[1:20:52] remember the sons of of Levi
[1:20:55] when they tried to take in sensors and
[1:20:59] remember God it wasn't so much the
[1:21:02] incense it wasn't so much even that of
[1:21:05] the different sensors but yet those
[1:21:07] sensors were identified with them and
[1:21:09] even though the incense itself it could
[1:21:11] have been according to the recipe but
[1:21:13] the fire itself was strange fire and God
[1:21:19] let it be known I don't want no strange
[1:21:21] fire you you realize the fire is still
[1:21:25] here friends the fire comes when the
[1:21:28] sacrifice is ordered right and remember
[1:21:31] you and I are charged in Romans 12 to
[1:21:34] present your bodies as a living
[1:21:36] sacrifice
[1:21:38] you want the
[1:21:39] of God to flow you wanted to move
[1:21:41] through your life listen don't get down
[1:21:43] in the Molly groves but recognize but
[1:21:46] that same fire is there that same fire
[1:21:49] is there to move what must I do submit
[1:21:52] yourself as a sacrifice now listen to me
[1:21:55] it might cause you to sacrifice your
[1:21:57] thought about something your thought
[1:22:00] about something your feeling about
[1:22:01] something your idea about something you
[1:22:03] realize that one little thing could be
[1:22:05] holding back the fire of God when you
[1:22:07] begin to look at that you'll say this
[1:22:09] don't mean nothing compared to the fire
[1:22:11] of God you see when we begin to look at
[1:22:18] things in terms of what we value
[1:22:20] sometimes and then begin to look at what
[1:22:22] could be no comparison at all so here it
[1:22:26] has to be a fire from off of the altar
[1:22:29] of the Lord notice this in the patmans
[1:22:31] vision how brother Aaron puts it here he
[1:22:33] says the lamp was lit in a special way
[1:22:36] first the priests took fire from the
[1:22:40] sacred altar which was originally
[1:22:42] lighted by the fire of God heal it now
[1:22:46] watch disorder heal it first of all v
[1:22:49] lamp that was sitting on top of the bowl
[1:22:53] not to the side the one that is on the
[1:22:56] top of the bowl remember the whole part
[1:22:59] is the candlestick he has branches that
[1:23:03] come out of it you with him he's not
[1:23:06] exalting a branch a branch itself that
[1:23:09] exalts itself above the candlestick is
[1:23:12] not a branch of the Lord there right
[1:23:15] first Thessalonians chapter 4 that this
[1:23:17] man called the man of sin setteth in the
[1:23:19] temple tent temple of God exhort in
[1:23:21] there exalting himself as though he were
[1:23:23] God but he's not of God and watch this
[1:23:27] order here the lamb that was sitting on
[1:23:30] top of the bowl who's the first lamp
[1:23:37] that got the Holy Ghost
[1:23:42] Jesus yes sir yeah because those who are
[1:23:50] born born born in the kingdom remember
[1:23:53] the least in the kingdom is greater than
[1:23:55] John the Baptist
[1:23:56] why because you are born of the Holy
[1:23:59] Ghost
[1:24:00] so who's the first one remember on whom
[1:24:04] thou shalt see the spirit be sin and
[1:24:08] remain the same is he
[1:24:13] so what lamp was the candlestick he are
[1:24:18] you with me here so we find the lamb
[1:24:21] that was sitting on top of the bowl he
[1:24:23] then lit the second lamp from the flame
[1:24:26] of the first land no notice it's not
[1:24:28] it's not having the torch and then
[1:24:31] you're going from the torch and light
[1:24:32] this one then you like this one you like
[1:24:34] this one but the life travels from one
[1:24:38] to the next to the next why because the
[1:24:42] life itself is not entering the body
[1:24:44] exiting the body entering the body
[1:24:46] exiting the body you are sealed with the
[1:24:50] Holy Ghost until the day of your
[1:24:53] redemption
[1:24:54] it doesn't throw inflow outflow inflow
[1:24:57] out no sir it comes in and it seals that
[1:25:01] age then there is a moving on to the
[1:25:04] next stage and the Holy Spirit moves
[1:25:06] calls out the elect of God that are laid
[1:25:08] and ordained in those respective beds of
[1:25:10] time and it seals them with the Holy
[1:25:12] Ghost glory be to God so here this
[1:25:16] lighting he then lit the second lamp
[1:25:18] from the flame of the first lamb you
[1:25:21] know what that means it's the same fire
[1:25:24] of God dwelling in your heart as the
[1:25:26] same one that fell on the day of
[1:25:27] Pentecost it's the same fire of God
[1:25:31] who's that administered by our high
[1:25:35] priest the Lord Jesus Christ are you
[1:25:40] with me man can talk to you man can
[1:25:44] witness pastor can talk to you prophet
[1:25:46] can speak to you all those things but
[1:25:48] man cannot give the Holy Ghost that is a
[1:25:51] work that's sovereignly done by the
[1:25:53] shepherd himself
[1:25:54] is that right the whole word itself
[1:25:57] calls us into a place of submission and
[1:25:59] recognizing his presence
[1:26:01] the third lamp received its fire from
[1:26:03] the second lamp as did the fourth
[1:26:05] receive its from the third and so on
[1:26:06] until all the seven lamps were burning
[1:26:09] this holy fire from the altar being
[1:26:11] passed from lamp to lamp is a wonderful
[1:26:15] type of the holy spirit in the seven
[1:26:17] Church ages the original outpouring of
[1:26:20] Pentecost which outpouring came direct
[1:26:22] from Jesus on the mercy seat is in doing
[1:26:26] his church through all the seven ages
[1:26:29] and showing forth perfectly that Jesus
[1:26:33] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:26:36] forever so that that transmission
[1:26:42] declares him to be the same so if there
[1:26:46] is a message or something that is taken
[1:26:47] now listen to me even if it's something
[1:26:49] that a person can look at that.look how
[1:26:51] things are taken so out of context
[1:26:53] within the scripture there can even be
[1:26:55] things it sells that even how how it is
[1:26:57] that that it will lay within the message
[1:26:59] but yet it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:27:01] bring those things together and it will
[1:27:03] always highlight Jesus Christ to be the
[1:27:06] same it will not be strange fire it will
[1:27:10] always be the original fire that's what
[1:27:13] it's intended to be you with me it's so
[1:27:16] when we look at this it must be Clare
[1:27:19] him to be the same so if something
[1:27:22] coming forth somehow alters or changes
[1:27:24] the doctrine says well I don't think we
[1:27:26] need this anymore this really isn't
[1:27:28] necessary you better watch that slant it
[1:27:31] might be using dead old scriptures might
[1:27:34] be losing using genuine quotes but you
[1:27:37] got to watch the spirit behind it
[1:27:40] because what will the spirit exalt you
[1:27:44] with me look at this bowl can I have a
[1:27:49] few more moments Zechariah for to notice
[1:27:53] where this bowl is at and he said unto
[1:27:56] me what sea is down and I said I have
[1:27:58] looked and behold a candlestick all of
[1:28:01] gold with a bowl upon the top of it and
[1:28:04] his seven lamps thereon it's seven pipes
[1:28:07] to the seven lamps
[1:28:08] which are up on the top thereof so Lotus
[1:28:11] you're not pouring in from the bottom
[1:28:13] you pour it in from the top down so the
[1:28:17] oil itself it is poured in there from
[1:28:21] there in the very midst remember all the
[1:28:23] branches themselves receive their oil
[1:28:26] from that of the candlestick and the
[1:28:30] bowl is on top not on the bottom it's on
[1:28:33] there of the top and it must flow all
[1:28:36] the way down and then there is wicks
[1:28:39] that are ordained within these these six
[1:28:42] branches that come out of it there are
[1:28:44] ordained wicks that move through each
[1:28:46] one of these seven candlesticks that are
[1:28:48] ordained by God now notice remember what
[1:28:50] the Lord Jesus said he told them in the
[1:28:53] Book of Luke I know familiar scriptures
[1:28:55] with us but he said behold I send the
[1:28:56] promise of my father upon you but tarry
[1:28:59] you in the city of Jerusalem until you
[1:29:01] be endued with power from on high
[1:29:04] little Samuel that's really simple
[1:29:06] that's right it did not come out of a
[1:29:09] seminary it did not come out of the
[1:29:11] Temple in Jerusalem it came from on high
[1:29:15] this life does not come out of a church
[1:29:18] this life comes from on high it's
[1:29:21] because he himself the bridegroom this
[1:29:23] message that you and I so enjoy and
[1:29:26] delight from it was not a message of an
[1:29:29] earthly voice it's a heavenly voice amen
[1:29:34] endued with power from on high
[1:29:37] amen here it is in the book of Acts when
[1:29:40] the day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:29:42] were all with one Accord in one place
[1:29:45] see what they were ready for they were
[1:29:48] ready for fire what showed you they were
[1:29:51] ready they were in one Accord in one
[1:29:52] place that itself is a miracle when you
[1:29:57] study this word Accord right here I've
[1:29:59] studied for many years now not been able
[1:30:00] have been fully able to preach on it but
[1:30:02] one Accord it speaks of a divine
[1:30:03] arrangement of a harmony like to consist
[1:30:06] among a symphony where they're so in
[1:30:08] sync with one another though different
[1:30:09] in temperaments and makeup but is so
[1:30:13] able to be brought in such
[1:30:14] synchronization to where that he himself
[1:30:17] is able to be the sound that comes
[1:30:21] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:30:25] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and
[1:30:28] it filled all the house where they were
[1:30:30] sitting and there appeared unto them
[1:30:32] cloven tongues like as a fire and he sat
[1:30:36] upon each of them here's the continuance
[1:30:40] who thou shalt see the Spirit of God
[1:30:42] descending in remaining the same as he
[1:30:47] cloven tongues of fire came it wasn't I
[1:30:50] don't know it sure sure I don't know I
[1:30:52] don't know about this one no no he won't
[1:30:54] gonna miss its target the Holy Ghost
[1:30:56] don't miss his target the Holy Ghost
[1:30:59] great mama
[1:31:00] Eagles she knows who belongs to her good
[1:31:04] ol repeater God and they were all filled
[1:31:06] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:31:08] with other tongues as the Spirit gave
[1:31:10] them utterance
[1:31:11] here's the ministry what is this the
[1:31:13] ministry of our high priest who was it
[1:31:16] that lit and ordered these lamps Aaron
[1:31:19] the high priest is that right so here is
[1:31:23] the Ministry of the high priest showing
[1:31:26] here he is on his minute oriole seat -
[1:31:28] now the Holy Spirit is released back now
[1:31:31] into the Church of the Living God
[1:31:34] identifying you and I in the true
[1:31:37] atonement Psalms 133 verse 1 behold how
[1:31:42] good and how pleasant it is for brethren
[1:31:44] to dwell together in unity lord have
[1:31:45] mercy I don't even see this this is just
[1:31:47] like verse 1 of x2 in it they were all
[1:31:50] together in one Accord in one place lord
[1:31:52] have mercy
[1:31:53] how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
[1:31:56] together in unity who can bring that
[1:31:59] unity about nobody but God and God will
[1:32:04] work and work and work and work because
[1:32:06] it ain't just about unifying and Stella
[1:32:08] I'm gonna stand hand-to-hand here but
[1:32:09] it's about being heart-to-heart are you
[1:32:12] with me if your hand to hand and not
[1:32:14] heart to heart remember that's something
[1:32:16] that God looks upon and he frowns out
[1:32:18] are you with me it's got to be
[1:32:21] heart-to-heart
[1:32:22] so how pleasant it is for brethren to
[1:32:25] dwell together in unity it is like
[1:32:31] the precious ointment upon the
[1:32:34] candlestick upon the head that ran down
[1:32:38] upon the beard even Aaron's beard that
[1:32:45] went down to the skirts of his garments
[1:32:49] it's the same Holy Ghost that made its
[1:32:53] way down to the foundation with five
[1:32:55] streams of grace you with me
[1:32:57] stats are a perfect man then same
[1:32:59] strings of God's flowing grace it makes
[1:33:02] its way down the five streams of grace
[1:33:03] to bring an actual birth and growth and
[1:33:06] building off now just go down just so
[1:33:09] far know it goes all the way down what
[1:33:11] for foundation and builds on up so that
[1:33:13] we grow up into Christ in all things as
[1:33:16] the dew of Hermon
[1:33:18] hey anybody ever heard do fall I heard
[1:33:22] ring but heard rain this past week on
[1:33:25] the road what days we had it up I've
[1:33:26] been so locked away I don't remember
[1:33:28] what days we had it but I know we had
[1:33:29] rain this week and you can hear rain
[1:33:31] can't you how many like rain well I do I
[1:33:35] like it to water my plants and water my

[1:33:56] yet it is something that takes place and
[1:33:59] you don't hear it

[1:34:05] it's going it's like silent you can wake
[1:34:10] up and you see the do there and you look
[1:34:12] at the do that's come down up on the
[1:34:14] ground you see that visitation of do and
[1:34:16] then next thing you know you get back
[1:34:18] with your cup of coffee and you look at
[1:34:19] say what the do go it didn't announce it
[1:34:25] was going but the Sun let the do know
[1:34:29] it's time to come back home the Sun let
[1:34:33] the do know it's time to rise back up
[1:34:36] and that Sun rising on that do little
[1:34:38] Dew Drop lord have mercy it begin to
[1:34:40] move and that little Dew Drop begin to
[1:34:42] quiver who-whoa glory
[1:34:46] hallelujah what's the Sun the Sun is
[1:34:47] calling it back home a little Dew Drop
[1:34:49] boy it's on that grass blade well it may
[1:34:51] not be a big church I mean a big grass
[1:34:52] blade but that little do is just that
[1:34:54] little Dew Drop it's just there whoo
[1:34:55] it's going around and around and around
[1:34:57] and before you know it in a moment and a
[1:35:01] twinkling of an eye it's gone it's gone
[1:35:08] that's the same you know that's a
[1:35:10] promise to you and I God promised that
[1:35:13] that was the one of the blessings that
[1:35:14] Abraham gave up on Jacob of the do
[1:35:17] notice this do of Hermon and as the dew
[1:35:19] that descended upon the mountains of
[1:35:22] Zion for there the LORD commanded the
[1:35:24] blessing even life forevermore let's
[1:35:27] just stop I can't go no further
[1:35:29] here is that life the promise of his
[1:35:32] life moving down into the body he's the
[1:35:35] life giver he's the one who gives and
[1:35:39] who has given you in our life so if he
[1:35:42] has given us life he's brought us to
[1:35:44] himself given us of his life then it's
[1:35:47] because of his desire to work through us
[1:35:50] I want you just to think of this here
[1:35:53] for a moment that that term in that
[1:35:55] thought line of a beaten work when you
[1:35:59] look at how that within that word beaten
[1:36:02] work sometimes the word beaten it really
[1:36:03] has a strong connotation especially in
[1:36:05] the hour and the time that we we live in
[1:36:08] but it means a work that's been shaped
[1:36:10] and it's been formed it's got a purpose
[1:36:13] in mind and Christ himself has formed
[1:36:18] you and I he's called us out of the
[1:36:21] world remember the Bible says in Hebrews
[1:36:23] chapter 12 now how that we are I've been
[1:36:26] chastened and we are chastened we are
[1:36:28] corrected Warchild trained remember how
[1:36:31] the word itself it comes like a
[1:36:32] schoolmaster to guide us and direct us
[1:36:34] but after he himself after he has come
[1:36:37] moved into our life we no longer need a
[1:36:39] schoolmaster do this and do that it
[1:36:41] becomes a subconscious working in our
[1:36:45] lives even of things that we and
[1:36:47] ourselves would not have maybe an answer
[1:36:49] to someone says hey you think this would
[1:36:51] be alright you look at I
[1:36:53] no it's got a question about Shabbos let
[1:36:55] alone because I don't know what to do in
[1:36:56] this it's just something you it's just
[1:36:58] something to registers I don't know I
[1:37:00] will just have to wait and see cuz I
[1:37:01] feel a little something about it someone
[1:37:03] say what what's wrong here I don't want
[1:37:04] to just feel it something I don't know
[1:37:06] maybe it's just me maybe there's just me
[1:37:08] and there's been times it has been just
[1:37:09] me times it has been just you but I
[1:37:11] would rather be it like that then of all
[1:37:14] the other times where we've went and had
[1:37:16] to repent you with me so within the
[1:37:22] midst of it this beaten work to think of
[1:37:26] it he's got a purpose of how that he's
[1:37:28] ordained for each of our lives and he's
[1:37:30] called us wherever that you are at and
[1:37:33] wherever that you are placed at your job
[1:37:35] school wherever it is God his desire is
[1:37:40] that the illumination of his life would
[1:37:43] reflect through you to be a witness in a
[1:37:47] dark world to be a light in your heart
[1:37:53] to be a light among your family you know
[1:37:57] what the light is the light is a witness
[1:38:01] it's a witness that not only he's still
[1:38:04] the same but the light and how it's
[1:38:07] shining in this hour
[1:38:08] it's a witness it's time to go it's time
[1:38:13] to go and how that God has called us by
[1:38:19] to himself our life every test and every
[1:38:24] trial everything that comes our way if
[1:38:29] we can we recognize this I believe how
[1:38:31] the Lord's been speaking to us for some
[1:38:33] time with tests and trials remember
[1:38:36] every one every true test and trial is
[1:38:41] predestinated by the hand of God and
[1:38:45] within it all listen to me
[1:38:47] within it all sometimes you may you
[1:38:50] might look at anything I feel a million
[1:38:53] miles away that's you feeling that ain't
[1:38:56] the truth but when you can recognize
[1:39:00] he's just as close just as near as he
[1:39:05] was
[1:39:06] when you was on the mountain he's not
[1:39:09] went anywhere he's in the midst of your
[1:39:13] life but the working of the test and
[1:39:17] trial that's predestinated by God is
[1:39:20] working the beating out the moving away
[1:39:24] of this guy who gets in the way
[1:39:27] this guy gets in the way let me tell you
[1:39:31] something we'll go into this later on
[1:39:32] some services this guy is not the wick
[1:39:37] this guy is not the wick this guy right
[1:39:41] here is against the program of God this
[1:39:46] guy is your biggest enemy Paul didn't
[1:39:51] say I was given a phone in my soul to
[1:39:53] keep me humble where did he say was
[1:39:55] given that thorn in my flesh what to
[1:40:00] keep the flesh down so that Christ might
[1:40:06] be strong and reflected through him I'll
[1:40:12] tell you what if Paul needed help like
[1:40:14] that we need it I'm not asking for
[1:40:19] thorns because we already got this thorn
[1:40:22] was not secret sins this thorn was that
[1:40:26] within his life see what God did God
[1:40:29] brought Paul to a realization of what
[1:40:32] this thorn was he said I besought him
[1:40:34] three times to take it but what did God
[1:40:38] say my grace is sufficient my grace is
[1:40:45] sufficient you say God knows exactly
[1:40:48] everything that is taking place
[1:40:50] this is his help to you and I to help us
[1:40:54] stay humble we need it we need it
[1:41:00] this guy would get out of order real
[1:41:02] quick but thanks be to God the high
[1:41:04] priest is in the house and he knows how
[1:41:06] to order the lamps don't you love him
[1:41:10] order my steps come musicians order my
[1:41:13] steps in your word
[1:41:15] amen you love him we want to see him
[1:41:19] reflected in our lives because without
[1:41:22] him or nothing or nothing well we want
[1:41:27] to do whatever job that we're on or
[1:41:29] wherever we go we want to know we our
[1:41:32] desires whenever we leave they may not
[1:41:35] know my name but they may say who was
[1:41:36] that guy something different that who
[1:41:39] was that lady is something that we want
[1:41:42] Christ to be the impression that's left
[1:41:47] upon people that's our desire because we
[1:41:51] want to be a true lamp that shines our
[1:41:55] light over against the candlestick it's
[1:42:00] to highlight him you love him let's pray
[1:42:04] together
[1:42:06] Lord Jesus father you're so mindful Lord
[1:42:13] you're so precious Lord as we look over
[1:42:19] Lord Jesus no doubt Lord for some of us
[1:42:23] Lord familiar places but oh how Lord
[1:42:27] we're not looking at it as places that
[1:42:30] we know in the scripture
[1:42:33] but we see Heavenly Father that even as
[1:42:37] we look at this it's just like your word
[1:42:41] where you would have them pack up the
[1:42:44] tabernacle in a certain way a certain
[1:42:46] order and then you would have them
[1:42:49] unpack it in a certain way and set it up
[1:42:52] that order took place over and over Nord
[1:42:59] your word is like a treasure where we
[1:43:03] pull out things both old and new but
[1:43:06] over and over Christ Himself is still
[1:43:10] set up the same way and Lord Jesus this
[1:43:16] is our desire the continuity of your
[1:43:19] life Lord in us that our life would
[1:43:22] reflect that same continuity to the
[1:43:25] taking down to the raising up Lord may
[1:43:29] you be glorified in our lives Lord
[1:43:32] father as we look at this Lord a beaten
[1:43:36] work to display light father you are our
[1:43:40] light without you we have no light
[1:43:45] Oh God without the oil without the fire
[1:43:48] we have no light but all Lord Jesus what
[1:43:52] a reality that the fire comes to prove
[1:43:57] that the oil is oil oh jesus how we love
[1:44:02] you tonight Laura I asked tonight good
[1:44:06] father that you would help each and
[1:44:09] every one of us maybe there's one that's
[1:44:11] here tonight that lord in their hearts
[1:44:14] just Lord desiring just to say Lord I
[1:44:18] want more of you Lord so I want to give
[1:44:22] more of myself Lord want to surrender
[1:44:25] more to you lord rahl up into my life oh
[1:44:30] god your presence your life Lord father
[1:44:35] granted Lord made Lord Jesus you find of
[1:44:40] our lives to where the word is it's
[1:44:42] coming forth the Lord Lord as you speak
[1:44:46] to us O God you are wooing us to
[1:44:51] yourself Lord you are drawing us Lord to
[1:44:55] you lord I pray that God that you'll
[1:44:58] just Lord move upon every heart if
[1:45:01] there's Lord any life or God that
[1:45:03] doesn't know you in that way may the
[1:45:05] Lord just surrendered to you Lord right
[1:45:09] now Lord may they just allow you to
[1:45:12] become the principal theme of their life
[1:45:15] Lord in the midst of it Lord and I pray
[1:45:19] that God for each and every one of us as
[1:45:22] believers Lord Jesus
[1:45:25] help us to be more yielded to you Lord
[1:45:31] Lord God it's you Lord as I think back
[1:45:34] to the scripture where it says he maketh
[1:45:36] me to lie down in green pastures Lord
[1:45:42] that's a work of you our Shepherd aware
[1:45:47] that our lives would be free from
[1:45:49] parasites a ministering of unity Lord
[1:45:53] and where that God there is such a sense
[1:45:57] of rest and care nor Jesus how do you
[1:46:05] minister to us Lord it's not like hands
[1:46:09] being taken upon us and shaken no no no
[1:46:13] no no no that that brings fear but Lord
[1:46:18] God over and over your hand is extended
[1:46:23] more to minister to us to speak to our
[1:46:27] hearts I think of wow your prophet put
[1:46:29] it there
[1:46:30] concerning revelations chapter 1 when
[1:46:32] John fell down you spoke to him and said
[1:46:35] fear not I'm he was dead and I'm alive
[1:46:41] forevermore
[1:46:43] your prophet took us right there and he
[1:46:45] says what he was ministering to John is
[1:46:50] the same thing he ministers to every one
[1:46:53] of his believers love courage and
[1:46:58] ability it's not our ability that we
[1:47:02] have it's the ability to get out of the
[1:47:05] way it's the courage that is able to
[1:47:09] submit and rest in your hand under that
[1:47:13] love that's projected and then received
[1:47:15] and reciprocated back through our lives
[1:47:19] help us Lord Father I know that in our
[1:47:23] lives
[1:47:23] Oh mile there could be so much so much
[1:47:27] or so many things Lord from down through
[1:47:31] time like the earth itself bears marks
[1:47:34] and scars they can go down ever so deep
[1:47:36] and they can find certain things that
[1:47:38] took place Lord sometimes Lord there's
[1:47:41] marks there scars that buried deep Lord
[1:47:43] in the caverns of our life Lord the Lord
[1:47:48] Jesus you are greater Lord you're
[1:47:54] greater
[1:47:55] you're able to help us and minister in
[1:47:59] such a way and this is what you do your
[1:48:01] love is a sanctifying love it's a
[1:48:04] cleansing love it takes away our
[1:48:06] thoughts of such inferiority it takes
[1:48:10] that away because that's a hindrance to
[1:48:12] your Lord it takes it away it cleanses
[1:48:15] us it cleanses us from looking at
[1:48:18] ourselves and saying I nothing I don't
[1:48:20] know why God even want me that hinders
[1:48:22] you because Lord humility is not
[1:48:26] thinking less of ourselves it's thinking
[1:48:30] of ourselves less and more about you
[1:48:36] help us Lord our desire is to fulfill
[1:48:40] your desires let them so resonate
[1:48:45] through our hearts in our lives burn
[1:48:48] like the flame Lord God in our homes on
[1:48:53] our jobs among our families in the
[1:48:57] church Lord one to another Lord granted
