[38:55] you are too
[38:57] praise the lord zechariah chapter 12
[39:01] verse 8 and
[39:05] just look to the lord right now
[39:08] he would just just direct us here
[39:12] i want to just move into that on verse
[39:13] 8.
[39:16] the scripture says in that day
[39:20] shall the lord defend
[39:23] the inhabitants of jerusalem and he
[39:27] that is feeble among them
[39:30] at that day shall be
[39:34] as david and the house of david
[39:38] shall be as god as the angel the lord
[39:42] before them and it shall come to pass in
[39:46] that day
[39:47] but i will seek to destroy
[39:51] all the nations that come against
[39:54] jerusalem and i will pour upon
[39:59] the house of david and upon the
[40:01] inhabitants of jerusalem
[40:03] the spirit of grace and of supplications
[40:07] that's
[40:08] the baptism of the holy ghost
[40:12] it's the same holy ghost that god
[40:16] has poured out upon the gentiles
[40:22] and israel receiving their day of
[40:24] visitation
[40:25] but we see the parallel of his working
[40:27] in our life
[40:29] he's the one who defends
[40:32] us are you with me
[40:36] he's defending his word
[40:40] and our protection it's in him
[40:47] and they shall look upon him whom they
[40:50] have
[40:50] pierced and they shall mourn for him
[40:54] as one mourneth for his only son
[40:57] and shall be in bitterness for him as
[41:00] one that is in bitterness
[41:02] for his firstborn we've moved to verse 1
[41:06] of
[41:06] zechariah 13.
[41:10] in that day there shall be a fountain
[41:16] not a cistern not a man-made source of
[41:20] water
[41:22] not a place that's depending on local
[41:25] revivals
[41:27] where the water washes down
[41:30] all off the roof all the dirt and the
[41:33] grime and
[41:34] how many of you ever had a cistern
[41:38] growing up we did i was glad when we
[41:41] moved to sandusky
[41:44] i remember turning on the water
[41:48] green bugs coming out
[41:51] i remember that it was a cistern
[41:55] and i also remember at times when there
[41:56] was a drought we had to call for
[41:58] somebody else to come bring
[42:00] water and fill that tank
[42:04] because if it didn't rain and wash off
[42:06] the water into there
[42:09] then we had no water but this
[42:12] is a fountain he opens yes
[42:18] this is god fulfilling his word
[42:23] you know he said in his word if any man
[42:25] believeth on me as the scripture
[42:27] has said aren't you glad he opens
[42:31] your eyes to what the scriptures really
[42:34] are saying he opens the way to the
[42:38] living waters
[42:39] and when he opens that fountain then out
[42:42] of
[42:43] your belly it's not just a fountain
[42:45] that's that's as though it's out here
[42:47] no he brings that fountain of life
[42:49] within you
[42:52] like brother branham standing at that
[42:54] bubbling brook and said what is it that
[42:56] makes you bubble
[43:00] i stood there just the other day what
[43:01] makes you bubble hallelujah
[43:04] it's something behind me amen
[43:08] water's coming out so deep one of the
[43:10] brothers told me in that water he said
[43:11] i've stuck he said
[43:13] i said down in there he said a real long
[43:15] stick a pole he said
[43:17] nine ten foot he said it still would not
[43:19] reach the bottom
[43:23] which is like a little hole but there's
[43:27] precious water it's cold it's refreshing
[43:32] you can drink from that water
[43:37] i'm glad that there's a fountain
[43:41] filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's
[43:44] veins
[43:45] where sinners plunge beneath the flood
[43:47] lose all
[43:49] their guilty stance this is that
[43:52] fountain
[43:54] in that day shall there shall be a
[43:56] fountain opened to the house of david
[43:58] and to the inhabitants of jerusalem
[44:02] notice it's not just for everybody
[44:05] it's for those in whom it's intended for
[44:09] for sin and for uncleanness
[44:14] let me just follow this up that part of
[44:17] it
[44:18] when i just said it's not for everybody
[44:20] although
[44:21] the preaching of this gospel it goes to
[44:25] all
[44:26] it's put before every man a decision
[44:30] that they must make will you come to
[44:34] these waters
[44:37] it's open to all brother branham would
[44:40] preach christ the mystery said oh i hope
[44:41] you just don't think this is just to
[44:43] this little group of people he said it's
[44:44] to everybody
[44:46] if they will receive
[44:49] isn't that powerful all you have to do
[44:52] is receive it
[44:55] how do i receive it believe it say amen
[44:59] be it unto me
[45:02] and it shall come to pass in that day
[45:05] sayeth the lord of hosts that i will cut
[45:07] off the names of the idols
[45:09] out of the land and they shall no more
[45:10] be remembered
[45:12] and also i will cause the prophets
[45:15] and the unclean spirit to pass out
[45:19] of the land may god bless you bless the
[45:22] reading of his word as you're being
[45:23] seated
[45:28] so as we are looking here
[45:32] in the word of god and just looking at
[45:35] this thought that is just
[45:41] so much here just upon my heart there's
[45:45] just been so many things we'll say
[45:47] within the past
[45:49] year and a half almost two years just so
[45:51] much of
[45:53] and just waiting on the lord and god
[45:56] just dealing with things on my heart
[45:58] just seeing this of the time where we're
[46:00] at
[46:00] and the parallel of god working with
[46:04] with israel and to keep in mind that
[46:07] what
[46:07] what god how god has dealt
[46:11] even with israel in that of the election
[46:14] through his sovereign grace
[46:16] it's the same god who works in our life
[46:20] by his sovereign grace
[46:23] and so when we we look at this here
[46:26] in the scriptures it speaks of how
[46:30] that god would make make
[46:34] known or to those who would be
[46:37] thought of as feeble god in that day
[46:40] will make them as david and remember
[46:45] david was not the choice
[46:49] or seemingly the one that would be
[46:52] chosen
[46:53] to be king his stature was not a stature
[46:57] that
[46:58] would be something that they would be
[47:01] able to put
[47:02] faith in his stature remember
[47:06] they had god had given them a king
[47:09] that in stature matched the other kings
[47:12] of the nation but god as the scripture
[47:16] is so
[47:17] clear to guide you and i and i believe
[47:20] it is within every part in his word and
[47:22] every part of our life that that god is
[47:26] letting us know
[47:27] that we do not see things as god sees it
[47:31] there's things that we would pass over
[47:33] sometimes even it might be a scripture
[47:35] you might even be looking at what you're
[47:37] reading in in your devotion
[47:39] it can be even what is read for a text
[47:42] and you might
[47:42] look over it and say how is that going
[47:45] to minister to my need
[47:47] but you see god is the god of his word
[47:50] and he knows exactly how to minister to
[47:53] our needs
[47:54] right on time you see this is an hour
[47:58] this is a time where um
[48:01] the god of this evil age satan is
[48:04] exalted to the throne
[48:06] of worship in man his wisdom
[48:09] knowledge the bible tells us in the book
[48:11] of daniel prophesying
[48:13] even of this time that knowledge shall
[48:16] increase
[48:17] the wisdom of man how would so increase
[48:21] and we can look at all that and there's
[48:23] certain things that we say
[48:24] my i'm glad you know this convenience or
[48:26] i'm glad this convenience or i'm glad
[48:28] this convenience
[48:29] there's certain things that we've
[48:30] benefited from the knowledge
[48:32] increasing but yet within it all this is
[48:35] where
[48:36] we we we we must uh reside in our hearts
[48:40] to recognize
[48:41] that it's not upon knowledge and wisdom
[48:44] by which we know god or can even
[48:48] figure out his word or even that
[48:51] of our own lives but it comes down to
[48:54] it's god coming and faith is what brings
[48:58] him on the scene
[48:59] and god god has a way through his word
[49:03] to where he comes and to even that that
[49:06] would try to figure him out
[49:07] and try to put a pathway for him to come
[49:10] god
[49:11] just comes in a manner that it defies
[49:14] all
[49:14] odds it defies the very wisdom and the
[49:18] counsel of man
[49:20] because god's counsel his thoughts
[49:23] are higher than our thoughts
[49:26] and so i believe the prayer from my
[49:29] heart would not be
[49:30] that god you come according to our
[49:32] thoughts i don't believe that's the
[49:33] desire here
[49:34] and i believe that we can change in our
[49:36] hearts so align it and say god
[49:39] let your thoughts be my thoughts lord
[49:44] lift me into your thoughts because i can
[49:46] tell you
[49:47] his thoughts are not based on the
[49:50] reasonings of
[49:51] can you or can't you his thoughts are
[49:55] i am the lord and there's no one else
[49:58] beside me his thoughts lifting into his
[50:03] thoughts
[50:03] it brings faith in our lives it brings
[50:06] something in our life that even that we
[50:09] stand
[50:10] in amazement and what is moving in our
[50:12] life
[50:13] why because that is the supernatural
[50:16] god he overrides all reasoning and all
[50:20] the
[50:21] the elements of man and he displays
[50:23] himself
[50:24] that he is the living god
[50:31] they that are feeble shall be as david
[50:37] this reality that we read of here in the
[50:40] scripture
[50:41] that is made available to us through and
[50:44] by the blood
[50:45] of the lord jesus christ where he would
[50:48] make a way
[50:48] that that same life that was there
[50:52] in the blood that brought our lord and
[50:54] savior
[50:55] to earth and he gave his life that same
[50:58] god
[50:59] who dwelled in that body it was for a
[51:01] purpose
[51:02] that he might make real to you and i
[51:05] that i have already redeemed you
[51:09] it was his desire to make that real
[51:12] because when you recognize you're
[51:14] redeemed
[51:15] you recognize the power and the whole
[51:18] that was upon your life it is broken and
[51:22] you have been brought back to whom you
[51:24] really
[51:25] belong to and who you always were
[51:30] hallelujah through the simplicity
[51:33] god veils himself in simplicity
[51:38] in looking at the word when the word
[51:42] is coming to pass it moves from just a
[51:45] written word
[51:46] that is a promise and it becomes
[51:50] a living fountain it becomes a reality
[51:54] it becomes that of god himself taking on
[51:58] the form of his word and as you yield to
[52:01] that word he's calling you to yield
[52:04] to it oh glory be to god as you yield to
[52:07] it
[52:07] it's his strength his power that's in
[52:11] work that's bringing you
[52:12] and releasing the hold of the enemy
[52:16] from upon your life brother and sister
[52:19] at church can't do that
[52:21] a man can't do that there's only one
[52:23] that can do that and let me just
[52:24] announce to you
[52:26] he's already done it
[52:32] recognize that a heart that desires to
[52:34] be free
[52:35] when that freedom and sound of jubilee
[52:38] begins to ring in their heart there's
[52:40] not enough
[52:41] devils out of hell that can hold them
[52:44] back
[52:48] hallelujah
[52:52] there's a purging that takes place
[52:55] this fountain cleanses he just don't
[52:59] forgive but the real depths of god's
[53:02] forgiveness
[53:03] it's a purging of the conscience of
[53:05] purging what i'm speaking of
[53:07] is the soul it's that word that is
[53:10] sprinkled there
[53:11] has a pure water upon the conscience
[53:14] it's god that brings a change
[53:17] to where he removes that to where
[53:19] there's no more
[53:20] desire amen
[53:26] amen is god's working
[53:29] and this is what god makes known to do
[53:33] to israel during that time as
[53:37] the bride is taken in rapture
[53:40] at the marriage supper of the lamb and
[53:43] he slips away from the marriage supper
[53:45] of the lamb because
[53:46] there's got to be an appointment you
[53:48] know how it is when you're at a wedding
[53:50] supper and i don't want to
[53:52] dwell upon this so much this morning but
[53:54] you know how it is you know
[53:55] everybody is anxious you you're there
[53:57] you know and
[53:58] and and when thank goodness the
[54:00] carnality doesn't go over there
[54:02] right thank goodness we're not waiting
[54:03] on oh do they get all their pictures
[54:05] taken we're starving to death i wish
[54:06] they
[54:07] thank god that carnality doesn't go over
[54:09] there
[54:10] are you with me but we shall sit down
[54:13] and the bible said
[54:14] he will wipe away not send somebody else
[54:17] to do it
[54:19] he will come and wipe away every tear
[54:25] brother samuel i don't understand that
[54:27] how am i going to have
[54:29] memories of victory and my brothers and
[54:32] sisters and yet
[54:33] he'll remove away all of that of the
[54:36] memories of all the
[54:38] failures and the memories of this one
[54:40] didn't make it or that one did
[54:41] how does he do that it's a paradox
[54:45] [Music]
[54:46] the same way that he moves in your life
[54:48] now it's a continuation of his power
[54:51] over there
[54:53] but after you get done here as things
[54:56] are winding up and you know how it is
[54:58] with a wedding supper
[54:59] you start going around and you're
[55:00] fellowshipping with different ones
[55:02] he slips away at that time
[55:06] all the nations are they're gathering in
[55:08] because remember
[55:10] satan is cast out when the bride goes up
[55:13] in rapture
[55:14] and the bible says wall to the
[55:16] inhabitants of the earth in that time
[55:18] for love the devil has come down to you
[55:21] so here he is and the bible said he know
[55:23] that he has but a short time he's going
[55:26] throughout the earth
[55:28] think of it he's going and assembling
[55:30] those
[55:31] nations that to come against israel and
[55:34] and frankly
[55:35] they're all against israel god has given
[55:38] a grace
[55:38] even in this hour let me tell you and
[55:41] this is not
[55:42] putting our president up but let me just
[55:44] tell you it couldn't have been a
[55:45] politician in the white house
[55:49] jerusalem had to be recognized as the
[55:51] capital
[55:52] of jerusalem let me just tell you
[55:56] god in this hour when men were promoting
[56:00] churches and creeds and ideas and all
[56:03] sorts of things
[56:04] god anointed a word of promise a man
[56:07] with his spirit
[56:09] that was able to declare and point back
[56:11] to you and i
[56:12] the real chosen place of worship that
[56:15] you and i might have
[56:16] real liberty and to recognize that the
[56:19] name of the lord jesus christ
[56:22] is not just a name it is a life of a
[56:25] person
[56:26] who is the way the truth and the life
[56:30] it took eyes to reveal that way
[56:33] and to say this is my beloved son
[56:37] hear ye him
[56:39] [Applause]
[56:41] we're standing there on mount
[56:43] transfiguration
[56:44] we've received hear you him moses and
[56:48] elijah
[56:49] is to speak to the 144 thousand hear
[56:52] him this is the one and then walking off
[56:54] of the mountain right into the
[56:56] millennium
[57:08] so close i say glory be to god
[57:15] hallelujah let me just tell you the
[57:18] greatest privilege we just don't know
[57:20] about the promise
[57:22] we are called into this promise
[57:25] by this promise to become this promise
[57:29] and that this promise might be made
[57:31] manifest through
[57:32] our mortal bodies
[57:34] [Applause]
[57:38] hallelujah
[57:40] he slips away and he comes to make
[57:44] himself known
[57:46] to the 144 thousand remember moses and
[57:49] elijah
[57:51] have been preaching revelations 11
[57:54] they have been preaching the same
[57:56] characteristics of their ministry
[57:59] that was in the old testament follows in
[58:02] this
[58:03] same characteristics they try to take
[58:05] them fire issues out they try to take
[58:08] them you see
[58:09] the enemy cannot touch them until god
[58:12] has finished with them
[58:14] until they have finished their testimony
[58:16] let me just tell you something
[58:17] there's not a devil of cancer there's
[58:20] not a devil
[58:21] that can take you until god's purpose
[58:24] has been fulfilled in your life
[58:29] because this word this message brother
[58:32] and sister
[58:33] it's a written expression of god's life
[58:36] inside of your eye hallelujah it's the
[58:39] same
[58:40] holy ghost riding betrayal again
[58:43] in the life of the believer it's a proof
[58:46] of the testimony
[58:48] of jesus christ in the midst of
[58:51] his children i am the same god
[58:54] i am the same yesterday today and
[58:57] forever
[58:59] i change not i'm the same god who part
[59:03] of the red seas
[59:05] and the same god who made a way through
[59:07] the jordan
[59:08] i am that i am the same god
[59:14] [Music]
[59:16] hallelujah
[59:26] that's why the devil's trying that's why
[59:28] he's been after israel
[59:30] trying to destroy him because if he can
[59:32] destroy him and write wipe them out
[59:34] then there is he can say there's a
[59:37] promise
[59:38] that god has not been able to keep
[59:42] this is why the enemy has been hot on
[59:45] your trail
[59:47] this is why you find situations arising
[59:51] and that arise but remember the enemy
[59:54] can do nothing
[59:55] except god give him permission
[59:59] and if god gives him permission it is an
[1:00:01] opportunity
[1:00:02] for god to step down and display
[1:00:06] his glory and his power and to declare
[1:00:09] this is my child this is my son this is
[1:00:12] my daughter
[1:00:13] you've gone far enough
[1:00:14] [Applause]
[1:00:24] they come to know under that ministry
[1:00:28] of the two witnesses they come to know
[1:00:32] his mighty power his mighty
[1:00:36] acts of salvation
[1:00:39] it becomes personal to them what they
[1:00:41] themselves cannot understand
[1:00:44] becomes personal to them
[1:00:47] they see themselves in the word are you
[1:00:50] catching the parallel
[1:00:52] it's god directing you and i that we
[1:00:55] might see ourselves
[1:00:56] in the word and we can see ourselves in
[1:00:59] the word
[1:00:59] that god is keeping his word it gives us
[1:01:02] strength to stand
[1:01:03] upon the promises of god and say the
[1:01:05] same god
[1:01:06] that has kept this word he's the same
[1:01:08] he's god of his word
[1:01:10] he'll keep every word what does it do it
[1:01:12] builds genuine
[1:01:13] faith in the word of god
[1:01:20] my mama
[1:01:24] i feel like preaching a little bit
[1:01:27] thank you lord glory to jesus
[1:01:31] zechariah 10 1
[1:01:35] ascii of the lord reign
[1:01:38] in the time of the latter rain
[1:01:42] god makes known his seasons
[1:01:47] then we can ask for what he desires for
[1:01:49] us to ask for
[1:01:51] remember he cannot do anything unless we
[1:01:53] first ask for it
[1:01:55] but it takes him to alert us to what we
[1:01:57] must ask for
[1:01:59] and to give us faith to ask for that to
[1:02:02] believe
[1:02:02] that's for me so the
[1:02:06] lord shall make bright clouds and give
[1:02:08] them
[1:02:09] showers of rain to every one grass in
[1:02:11] the field
[1:02:12] for the idols have spoken vanity and the
[1:02:15] diviners have seen a lie
[1:02:17] and have told false dreams they comfort
[1:02:20] in vain therefore they went their way as
[1:02:23] a flock
[1:02:24] they were troubled because there was no
[1:02:27] shepherd
[1:02:28] mine anger was kindled against the
[1:02:30] shepherds and i
[1:02:31] punished the goats for the lord of hosts
[1:02:34] hath visited
[1:02:35] his flock the house of judah and hath
[1:02:37] made them
[1:02:38] you catch this he has visited them
[1:02:43] who his flock the house of judah
[1:02:48] you know why god has visited you because
[1:02:51] you
[1:02:51] belong to him
[1:02:55] me god visited me in the condition
[1:02:59] where i was at in the pigpen god visited
[1:03:02] me
[1:03:03] god visited you
[1:03:06] not because of the condition we were in
[1:03:09] but because
[1:03:10] of what was beneath the darkness of our
[1:03:14] life
[1:03:17] promises of the programs of man will
[1:03:20] make you a better
[1:03:21] guy we'll make you a more moral man
[1:03:23] we'll do all this
[1:03:24] all of those things fail they can make a
[1:03:28] person a
[1:03:29] good moral person which i think anybody
[1:03:31] would want to have a good moral person
[1:03:33] in their neighborhood we would applaud
[1:03:35] that especially in this hour
[1:03:37] but that is not salvation religion is
[1:03:41] the works of man it's only a covering
[1:03:43] to try to cover up what the real issue
[1:03:46] is
[1:03:47] that needs to be dealt with but
[1:03:49] salvation
[1:03:50] is of the lord he comes to save
[1:03:54] his own he sends his word he visits our
[1:03:57] lives
[1:04:00] never forget when god was dealing with
[1:04:02] my heart god was visiting my life
[1:04:05] visiting me in dreams visiting me
[1:04:07] brother samuel did it turn you around no
[1:04:09] i was still running i was still going
[1:04:12] the way i was going
[1:04:13] but he was visiting me
[1:04:18] he knows what he's doing
[1:04:21] i guarantee you one thing my mom and dad
[1:04:24] it would have looked like i don't doubt
[1:04:26] for a moment
[1:04:26] the devil didn't tell them look at god
[1:04:29] and even hearing your prayers
[1:04:31] you're going completely the opposite way
[1:04:33] look at him
[1:04:34] he's worse off now than he's ever been
[1:04:36] but brother they had confidence
[1:04:38] because there was a token applied in
[1:04:40] their own life
[1:04:42] and they knew what a rascal and a
[1:04:44] stinker that they were as well
[1:04:46] i don't care how kind of a goody two
[1:04:48] shoes that they were i love you mama
[1:04:50] i don't care what they were and
[1:04:52] everything they can rely upon
[1:04:54] brother they knew that they had to have
[1:04:56] jesus christ
[1:04:57] the power of god to change their life
[1:05:01] and they held to that same power and
[1:05:04] said god what you did for me
[1:05:06] you do it for sam your lord you'll
[1:05:08] change his life
[1:05:09] you'll transform his life what was that
[1:05:12] that was there
[1:05:13] moving and saying pour out the latter
[1:05:16] rain
[1:05:17] deal with his life
[1:05:25] he have visited them and have made them
[1:05:28] as his goodly horse in the battle
[1:05:33] my lord my lord
[1:05:37] hallelujah you take a horse
[1:05:40] and you look back at its pedigree and
[1:05:42] you see this horse
[1:05:43] and they look back through the line oh
[1:05:45] it's stubborn it's this
[1:05:47] it's that they bring it out to the
[1:05:49] auctions like they do down in mount hope
[1:05:51] in amish country on the front on on on
[1:05:54] on friday mornings
[1:05:55] and they walk them horses around there
[1:05:58] you know the amish people they don't
[1:06:00] they don't buy them scallywag horses the
[1:06:01] horses you pass by

[1:06:06] many times on race tracks are you with
[1:06:09] me

[1:06:12] say i think this horse can pull me
[1:06:14] i think this horse will be all right you
[1:06:15] know what they want to see they want to
[1:06:17] see
[1:06:17] the character they want to see the
[1:06:20] pedigree
[1:06:21] let me just tell you something our first
[1:06:23] family tree
[1:06:24] did not have much of a pedigree to offer
[1:06:27] but he was able to look and see that sea
[1:06:31] that he planted on the inside and say in
[1:06:34] that seat brother there's
[1:06:35] papers there's papers that go along with
[1:06:39] that seed
[1:06:41] all it needs is the seed of life
[1:06:44] to raise that into an expression
[1:06:47] of a divine pedigree as a son and
[1:06:50] daughter of god
[1:06:52] amen that's why god that's why god has
[1:06:55] visited your life
[1:07:00] hallelujah not an accident it's
[1:07:02] purposeful
[1:07:04] [Applause]
[1:07:10] the devil tried to tell you you're here
[1:07:11] for nothing or you don't understand this
[1:07:14] and you don't understand this you just
[1:07:16] look at that devil
[1:07:17] and you say shut your mouth i
[1:07:20] didn't bring myself here i may not
[1:07:23] understand everything
[1:07:25] but i know that god has spoke to my
[1:07:29] heart
[1:07:29] i know that god is dealing with my life
[1:07:36] and he that becomes the good work shall
[1:07:39] perform it until the day of jesus christ

[1:08:12] who's able to bring redemption who's
[1:08:14] able
[1:08:15] to bring on the resurrection and the
[1:08:17] rapture who's able
[1:08:18] and i looked no man was worthy but out
[1:08:23] of him

[1:08:57] himself known
[1:09:01] out of him came forth the corner the
[1:09:04] foundation stone
[1:09:07] the rock on which you're positioned
[1:09:10] this rock that he said he had set you up
[1:09:13] on
[1:09:16] you know brother adam you couldn't climb
[1:09:18] up there
[1:09:20] are you following me now you can't climb
[1:09:23] up there

[1:09:29] what god has done for the messenger the
[1:09:32] same god
[1:09:32] has put you and i on the rock of divine
[1:09:35] revelation
[1:09:38] men have tried to climb this great
[1:09:40] mountain
[1:09:43] but god himself is the one who
[1:09:45] translates us
[1:09:46] who puts us who places us upon a sure
[1:09:50] foundation and what is that place he
[1:09:53] positions us
[1:09:54] it's in himself in divine love
[1:09:59] what brought you from where you were
[1:10:02] loved
[1:10:05] what drew you who would have invited you
[1:10:08] who would have spoke to you
[1:10:09] who would have had any dealings with you
[1:10:12] god
[1:10:14] his love
[1:10:17] and he called you cleaned you up
[1:10:21] and transformed you for what that
[1:10:24] by his love working in your life
[1:10:28] it would produce a faith and a
[1:10:30] confidence
[1:10:33] in him what are you resting in
[1:10:37] his workmanship
[1:10:45] out of him oh my
[1:10:48] this is a this is one of those
[1:10:50] scriptures
[1:10:51] like others it's like a ch a can of
[1:10:54] juice concentrate
[1:10:58] mixing it up out of him comes forth the
[1:11:01] corner
[1:11:02] out of him comes forth the nail you know
[1:11:05] the bible speaks in isaiah 22
[1:11:07] about the nail ezra when they come back
[1:11:10] in the land say
[1:11:11] he hath given us a nail you know what a
[1:11:13] nail is for
[1:11:14] to fasten you to something
[1:11:18] and notice he has given his
[1:11:22] life his life through him by
[1:11:25] redemption that what that you and i are
[1:11:27] not separate
[1:11:28] separated from the word of our true
[1:11:31] identity
[1:11:32] but it is him that fastens us up
[1:11:36] unites us plants us positions
[1:11:39] us in him out of him
[1:11:42] comes forth the nail
[1:11:47] hallelujah i'm nailed in tied in
[1:11:50] tangled up shut in with jesus
[1:11:58] but sammy you're you're in a cocoon yeah
[1:12:01] i'm in him now remember what takes place
[1:12:04] in him
[1:12:05] is a mystery
[1:12:08] he had an old ugly caterpillar comes in
[1:12:14] but once that cocoon is opened up
[1:12:18] at the appointed time out comes forth
[1:12:21] a beautiful butterfly
[1:12:26] you understand creation testifies
[1:12:30] of the power of his godhead
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:34] creation nature testifies
[1:12:37] of the true witness
[1:12:42] look sometimes to a tree i mean did
[1:12:44] anybody in their yard like a tree that
[1:12:46] doesn't have leaves on it
[1:12:50] you look out there and say that tr you
[1:12:52] don't look at them and say in that a
[1:12:53] beautiful tree
[1:12:54] honey in the bark nights with all that
[1:12:56] moss over it there's no leaves on the
[1:12:58] tree
[1:12:58] not one of you say that
[1:13:02] but what you start looking at is saying
[1:13:03] you know what i think we need to get rid
[1:13:05] of that
[1:13:07] right but in the wintertime you know
[1:13:10] looking at that tree
[1:13:12] you know it's only a matter of time
[1:13:14] until life comes back up in the roots
[1:13:16] the life will come to the roots and
[1:13:19] bring forth
[1:13:20] that of the leaves and then you'll stand
[1:13:22] there once again once the winter of
[1:13:24] death has passed you'll see the
[1:13:25] resurrection of the spring
[1:13:27] you see the height of the summer and
[1:13:29] then the fall itself
[1:13:30] will tell of the fall death sets in but
[1:13:33] then light comes back
[1:13:35] it's all a testimony of the true witness
[1:13:38] of jesus christ
[1:13:40] all nature testifies of the power of his
[1:13:44] godhead
[1:13:47] out of him the battle bowl
[1:13:51] out of him the battle bowler it is him
[1:13:55] who breaks the bow
[1:13:58] when that of the millennium in the
[1:14:01] beginning
[1:14:02] and here preparing for that the bible
[1:14:04] says he will beat
[1:14:05] their beat their swords into plowshares
[1:14:11] war will be broken from around the earth
[1:14:14] the bible says
[1:14:15] that the earth land sea and sky will be
[1:14:18] filled with the knowledge of the lord
[1:14:21] amen and there will be peace as he sets
[1:14:24] on us on the throne of david
[1:14:27] the same way it is that he breaks the
[1:14:30] battle bowl
[1:14:31] out of your soul
[1:14:34] our own soul and nature was enmity
[1:14:37] against god
[1:14:38] even trying to perform religious acts
[1:14:42] it's enmity against god what must i do
[1:14:45] except
[1:14:46] what he has already provided
[1:14:50] and he's the one that will come and do
[1:14:52] away with the enmity and strife he'll
[1:14:55] put peace
[1:14:56] in your soul come unto me all you that
[1:14:59] are heavy laden
[1:15:00] and i will give you rest for your soul
[1:15:03] this is what god's peace does in your
[1:15:05] life it transforms
[1:15:07] your life he is our peace
[1:15:12] who's broken down every wall
[1:15:15] he breaks the battle he breaks
[1:15:20] hallelujah and the bible says here
[1:15:24] notice this working out of him
[1:15:27] every oppressor together
[1:15:31] what's the oppressor one that could walk
[1:15:33] through the land and say
[1:15:38] one who oppresses
[1:15:43] and he said i will break out the
[1:15:45] oppressor
[1:15:47] god deals with the one who says
[1:15:50] i can't get free of this you know what
[1:15:52] kind of life i live
[1:15:54] you know what kind of life you recognize
[1:15:56] that there's hearts that cry out
[1:15:58] even right now that say god i want to be
[1:16:00] free
[1:16:01] i don't want to be driven to do these
[1:16:03] things let me just tell you
[1:16:04] legion was crying out that way it was
[1:16:08] not his mouth
[1:16:09] it was that seed on the inside you would
[1:16:12] never have looked at legion you'd have
[1:16:14] been destined to get
[1:16:15] preachers to go around him and the
[1:16:17] community but rather
[1:16:19] the difference was when jesus came
[1:16:22] there was something down on the inside
[1:16:25] faith coming by hearing
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:30] the prophet said there wasn't enough
[1:16:32] devils
[1:16:33] that could keep him back
[1:16:38] do you see the power of responding
[1:16:42] to the call that's going forth within
[1:16:44] you
[1:16:45] he calls brother there's gotta be
[1:16:48] something to catch that call
[1:16:49] there's something or day to catch that
[1:16:52] call to catch that
[1:16:53] ring of freedom
[1:16:56] [Music]
[1:17:00] but after he met jesus
[1:17:05] he went back a different man
[1:17:09] i'd say there were people still running
[1:17:11] from him
[1:17:13] but when he walked in the house that day
[1:17:16] his family knew
[1:17:21] something's different
[1:17:24] something's happened to daddy
[1:17:27] let me just tell you something it's a
[1:17:29] difference when you don't have to tell
[1:17:31] nobody
[1:17:33] it's a difference where you don't have
[1:17:34] to be you just are in liberty
[1:17:37] to be who you always really were
[1:17:42] he set you free are you hearing me this
[1:17:45] morning
[1:17:46] he sets you free he sets the captive
[1:17:49] free
[1:17:56] and verse 5 and they shall be as a
[1:17:58] mighty men
[1:18:01] which tread down their enemies in the
[1:18:03] mire of the streets in the battle
[1:18:06] and they shall fight because the lord is
[1:18:09] with them
[1:18:10] and the riders the powers that are on
[1:18:12] horses shall be confounded
[1:18:14] and i will strengthen the house of judah
[1:18:17] notice
[1:18:17] i will strengthen
[1:18:21] i will save the house of joseph i will
[1:18:24] bring upon that i will bring them
[1:18:26] again to place them
[1:18:30] for i have mercy upon them and they
[1:18:33] shall be
[1:18:33] as though i had not cast them off
[1:18:38] amen what a paradox
[1:18:43] to be able to so deal with the past
[1:18:46] in your life to where
[1:18:49] it is such a paradox you can say
[1:18:52] well i know i you know those things that
[1:18:55] were done
[1:18:57] but that's not me that's not who i am
[1:19:02] that's not who i am and yet a person can
[1:19:04] say
[1:19:05] oh no no no samuel i remember i remember
[1:19:08] when you used to do this
[1:19:09] i remember when you used to do this but
[1:19:11] you see it's not this that's been
[1:19:13] changed
[1:19:14] yet
[1:19:17] it's this on the inside in the temple
[1:19:21] there's new ownership that's moved on
[1:19:24] the inside
[1:19:26] i didn't change my habits he changed my
[1:19:29] nature
[1:19:32] there's new habits that come with a new
[1:19:34] nature
[1:19:36] there's a different wall that comes with
[1:19:39] a new nature
[1:19:41] what does that his spirit of grace
[1:19:45] that is poured out upon my life
[1:19:49] it causes me to ask it causes me
[1:19:52] to desire his grace for my life
[1:20:00] oh glory be to god
[1:20:10] i stood right here we didn't own this
[1:20:13] church at the time
[1:20:15] i stood right here
[1:20:18] sure i had already been baptized once
[1:20:21] i was how was that mom
[1:20:24] 10 11 i remember
[1:20:28] this time you didn't have to be baptized
[1:20:30] again yeah i know
[1:20:33] but you know what there was something
[1:20:36] that god had done in my life
[1:20:40] that i had a real understanding of it
[1:20:42] yes
[1:20:44] it wasn't just something that i had just
[1:20:46] went along
[1:20:47] and had just done i wasn't just doing
[1:20:51] something careless before but
[1:20:53] you understand i stood right here
[1:20:58] from where god had just brought a man
[1:21:00] from some weeks back
[1:21:03] a man that had said i can never
[1:21:06] stop doing this i don't i can't stop
[1:21:08] doing that i can't stop doing this
[1:21:10] and i was standing right here and i
[1:21:13] remember
[1:21:14] as i testified some of you were here a
[1:21:16] few people we were on here on a saturday
[1:21:19] and i said if they would have asked me
[1:21:21] or somebody told me
[1:21:22] a few weeks ago you'll be standing here
[1:21:25] and you'll be walking into the waters of
[1:21:27] baptism your life you will have turned
[1:21:30] over to the lord
[1:21:31] i said it i said i would have said
[1:21:33] you're crazy
[1:21:35] even though god was dealing with my life
[1:21:37] it shows you
[1:21:38] the paradox of his power
[1:21:41] i didn't know what was taking place
[1:21:43] brother aaron
[1:21:45] i didn't know why he was visiting me in
[1:21:47] dreams
[1:21:49] why were the things he was pointing out
[1:21:51] in my life
[1:21:54] why were the things that he was taking
[1:21:56] out desires i didn't know what was going
[1:21:58] on
[1:21:59] but i'm just here to tell you it was a
[1:22:01] paradox and it's still a paradox
[1:22:03] can you explain it i cannot explain it
[1:22:06] but i
[1:22:07] know what he has done
[1:22:12] [Applause]
[1:22:14] let me just tell you right now those of
[1:22:16] you praying for your children
[1:22:18] you don't got to look nowhere else you
[1:22:20] can look god put a testimony before you
[1:22:23] of of an individual who was running
[1:22:25] completely the opposite way
[1:22:27] who even the people of the world had
[1:22:29] given up on
[1:22:32] he'll be nothing and you know what if it
[1:22:34] had not been for the mercy of jesus
[1:22:36] christ
[1:22:37] that's exactly right i may not even be
[1:22:39] alive on the earth today
[1:22:41] for the life than where it was going but
[1:22:44] god
[1:22:44] who is rich and mercy
[1:22:52] me just tell you mom and dad you might
[1:22:54] think they're going 100 miles an hour
[1:22:56] the other way what should i do you keep
[1:22:58] praying all the more
[1:23:00] you're not walking by sight you walk by
[1:23:04] pay
[1:23:07] it's a paradox of his power
[1:23:13] hallelujah
[1:23:17] oh glory be to god
[1:23:20] hallelujah hallelujah and they shall be
[1:23:24] as though i had not cast them off you
[1:23:26] understand what that means brother aaron
[1:23:28] you're not walking around someone well
[1:23:31] i'm not worthy i'm not worthy
[1:23:33] it's true there is not one of us who
[1:23:35] were worthy
[1:23:36] but he has made us worthy
[1:23:40] there's nothing you and i could ask for
[1:23:42] but you know what
[1:23:43] he has given us faith and a confidence
[1:23:46] to
[1:23:46] ask for what rightfully belongs to your
[1:23:49] eye let me just tell you something
[1:23:51] he wants to give you the holy ghost more
[1:23:54] than you want to receive it
[1:23:57] it belongs to you he made a way that you
[1:24:00] could have it
[1:24:05] amen hallelujah and the same one
[1:24:08] who sent the lord jesus the same one
[1:24:11] who moved back and rolled back the
[1:24:13] waters is the same god
[1:24:15] here this morning to roll back and park
[1:24:18] the waters of unbelief
[1:24:20] the waters of doubt
[1:24:21] [Applause]
[1:24:23] he's the same god
[1:24:28] i am the lord their god and will hear
[1:24:31] them
[1:24:32] and they of ephraim shall be like a
[1:24:35] mighty man did you catch what this is
[1:24:37] saying
[1:24:38] shall be as mighty men hallelujah
[1:24:42] not that they are mighty men not that we
[1:24:45] are mighty people
[1:24:47] it's not a mighty people it's a mighty
[1:24:50] god
[1:24:54] in his people it's not
[1:24:57] mighty men and women it's a mighty god
[1:25:01] wrapping his life in our lives
[1:25:07] i want to remind you paul would call the
[1:25:10] attention to the corinthians
[1:25:12] he would let them know you said you see
[1:25:15] after your calling
[1:25:17] there's not many who are noble rich
[1:25:20] or mighty who are called
[1:25:25] but god had chosen
[1:25:29] the outcast the weak
[1:25:35] that which the world or anybody else
[1:25:36] could say that one
[1:25:40] but god looketh not as i see
[1:25:44] god looks on the heart
[1:25:48] when god chose david he saw a place
[1:25:51] a heart where he could be a great big
[1:25:53] god
[1:25:56] he that is feeble shall be as david
[1:25:59] god calls the weak listen to me now
[1:26:03] listen but what gets in the way pride
[1:26:12] three temptations lust of i lust the
[1:26:15] flesh and the pride of life
[1:26:18] pride will keep back that which is weak
[1:26:21] from surrendering their weakness they'll
[1:26:24] keep their weakness and say
[1:26:26] well i can't do this because of this and
[1:26:27] i've got this and i've got that
[1:26:29] and i've got this
[1:26:32] but when you're ready you might say i am
[1:26:34] a nobody no no
[1:26:36] when you're ready to really become a
[1:26:37] nobody
[1:26:40] not in pride hide behind your weaknesses
[1:26:44] well i can't do this and i can't do that
[1:26:46] but when you're willing
[1:26:47] to become weak to become a nobody
[1:26:50] then god says that's an empty vessel
[1:26:55] that's a vessel that the rest could say
[1:26:57] that's a frail
[1:26:59] weak earthen vessel but god said that's
[1:27:04] where i put my power
[1:27:06] [Applause]
[1:27:08] and your life now this wine is better
[1:27:12] than the first wine
[1:27:14] are you here this life the life i now
[1:27:18] live in the flesh i live by the faith of
[1:27:21] the son of god who loved me and gave
[1:27:23] himself for me
[1:27:25] it's a different life and god takes
[1:27:30] weakness
[1:27:32] let's just face it we all have pride
[1:27:35] right
[1:27:36] right we all deal with pride that's
[1:27:39] that that that's part of the pedigree of
[1:27:41] the first birth
[1:27:42] and the and the new birth raises us
[1:27:45] into a place to give authority and
[1:27:48] dominion
[1:27:48] and very important spiritual discernment
[1:27:52] to array to recognize the encroachment
[1:27:55] of the enemy
[1:27:56] to try to hinder god from working in our
[1:27:59] lives
[1:28:06] let me just
[1:28:11] verse 8. i love this
[1:28:14] i will hiss for them
[1:28:18] i will hiss for them that word hiss
[1:28:21] means
[1:28:22] i will pipe or i will whistle
[1:28:25] there'll be a melody that i will call
[1:28:29] for them with
[1:28:30] hallelujah you know god's gonna finish
[1:28:33] that song of moses
[1:28:35] are you with me god's gonna finish that
[1:28:37] song of moses

[1:28:58] the earth that
[1:28:59] are part of the symphony of the word

[1:31:17] this for i have redeemed them
[1:31:21] you know he already redeemed him on
[1:31:23] calvary
[1:31:27] before i ever was standing here before i
[1:31:30] ever was kneeling
[1:31:31] in brother bill's basement before he
[1:31:34] ever filled me with the holy ghost i was
[1:31:35] already redeemed
[1:31:38] i was already you know what he was doing
[1:31:41] he was calling me
[1:31:42] into the place of redemption
[1:31:46] and what the holy ghost does remember
[1:31:48] his work listen to me now
[1:31:50] his work of you even believing on him
[1:31:54] as your lord and savior is a work of
[1:31:57] redemptive power
[1:31:58] but there's more power and then he comes
[1:32:02] to do what
[1:32:03] clean up your life
[1:32:06] what is it more working of his
[1:32:08] redemptive power
[1:32:10] and what does it do it's to build faith
[1:32:13] that he himself might step inside of you
[1:32:17] and make his known in you and through
[1:32:20] you
[1:32:21] his power
[1:32:26] he that is feeble shall be as david
[1:32:34] are you with me
[1:32:40] egypt was a mighty nation
[1:32:44] israel was in bondage they were in egypt
[1:32:47] was a mighty nation
[1:32:49] they had power over israel
[1:32:54] but god didn't raise up the amorites or
[1:32:57] another nation
[1:32:58] to come over and destroy him god could
[1:33:02] have taken another army that would have
[1:33:03] been
[1:33:03] similar you could have maybe matched up
[1:33:06] a little bit better
[1:33:08] god wasn't trying to match up with their
[1:33:11] earthly
[1:33:12] military wisdom power
[1:33:16] amen but here
[1:33:19] god said i'm going to come
[1:33:23] and do this in simplicity how are you
[1:33:26] going to come
[1:33:27] i'll come in the form of a runaway
[1:33:28] prophet
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:34] i'll come in one who's been running from
[1:33:37] it that recognized
[1:33:38] his strength and knowledge of the word
[1:33:41] cannot deliver him amen but when he met
[1:33:45] god
[1:33:46] god stepped inside
[1:33:51] hallelujah it was not moses it was god
[1:33:55] in moses i
[1:33:58] have come down to deliver them
[1:34:03] god anointed his prophet with the word
[1:34:07] what was the word to do it was to
[1:34:10] announce
[1:34:11] judgment on egypt and proclaim
[1:34:14] liberty to israel
[1:34:19] the heart of the message was
[1:34:22] let my son go
[1:34:26] that he might serve me
[1:34:29] all the acts of power that were
[1:34:32] displayed
[1:34:33] was to build faith not in pharaoh
[1:34:36] it hardened his heart
[1:34:40] but it was to build faith in the hearts
[1:34:44] of israel for that exodus night
[1:34:48] god by his grace would send a prophet
[1:34:51] with a pillar of fire
[1:34:53] vindicated word
[1:34:58] you call this a great army
[1:35:04] god's backing him up
[1:35:09] are you with me god is backing him up
[1:35:12] god let him out and brought him to a
[1:35:14] place
[1:35:15] where the enemy thought he had him
[1:35:19] but what the enemy didn't know you've
[1:35:21] been suckered
[1:35:26] you've been fooled this is an ambush
[1:35:30] that's set for you
[1:35:33] he didn't know but that day was his last
[1:35:36] day
[1:35:38] what israel didn't know was that day
[1:35:41] there'll be no more cries of the tax
[1:35:43] masters over you
[1:35:47] god took the situation to do what
[1:35:50] swallow up all of that which was
[1:35:53] after them brother let me tell you
[1:35:56] something
[1:35:57] the devil can't follow you through the
[1:35:59] blood
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:03] he can't make it amen
[1:36:07] because if he could he'd be your brother
[1:36:11] he can't make it he can try to send
[1:36:14] impersonation
[1:36:15] but he can't make it you couldn't have
[1:36:18] made it either
[1:36:19] but god passed you safely to the other
[1:36:23] shore
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:25] god has placed you in a position where
[1:36:27] you're not
[1:36:28] running and looking back over your back
[1:36:31] you are not the tail
[1:36:32] you were made to be the head god has
[1:36:35] given you authority god has pointed out
[1:36:39] if you only look on the shores of your
[1:36:41] life
[1:36:42] he'll show you those dead egyptians
[1:36:45] those task masters
[1:36:46] that i want to run you down those task
[1:36:48] masters
[1:36:49] whip you and put you this reminds you
[1:36:51] this and that he'll show you
[1:36:53] they are dead

[1:37:08] i will sow them notice and they shall
[1:37:10] increase as they have increased i will
[1:37:11] sow them among the people
[1:37:13] they shall remember me in far countries
[1:37:15] and they shall live with their children
[1:37:16] and turn again
[1:37:18] israel was dispersed after the rejection
[1:37:21] of messiah
[1:37:22] sprinkled here yeah here here
[1:37:26] i asked you a question were they loved
[1:37:29] in those other countries

[1:37:43] have
[1:37:45] the guards outside of their schools
[1:37:48] in europe but you know what
[1:37:52] god permits that you know why
[1:37:55] they got to get back into their land
[1:37:59] god permits things to arise
[1:38:05] if god had left you or me in our comfort
[1:38:08] zone
[1:38:09] brother think about where we would have
[1:38:11] been but god started removing things
[1:38:13] around us
[1:38:14] he starts dealing with our life why he's
[1:38:16] got to get us in place
[1:38:20] and he's doing it
[1:38:23] no matter how you try to resist it he's
[1:38:25] doing it
[1:38:30] hallelujah hallelujah and i will bring
[1:38:32] them

[1:38:35] will gather them out of assyria i'll
[1:38:36] bring them into the land of gilead and
[1:38:38] lebanon
[1:38:38] and place shall not be found for them
[1:38:41] and he shall
[1:38:42] pass through the sea with affliction and
[1:38:44] shall smite the waves and the sea
[1:38:46] and all the depths of the river shall
[1:38:47] dry up and the pride of assyria shall be
[1:38:50] brought down
[1:38:50] and the scepter of egypt shall depart
[1:38:53] away
[1:38:56] god is speaking of bringing
[1:39:00] israel back home

[1:40:17] administering doctrine that denies the
[1:40:21] power
[1:40:22] of a living lord jesus christ

[1:45:09] fell
[1:45:10] in the upper room is here this morning
[1:45:13] what do i do jump
[1:45:17] jump he's there to pack you
[1:45:20] from death unto life
[1:45:22] [Applause]
[1:45:26] hallelujah this gathering disassembly
[1:45:30] has god bringing us and drawing us to
[1:45:33] himself
[1:45:41] as he said concerning israel so has he
[1:45:44] done the same for you and i
[1:45:46] am amen i will say to the north
[1:45:50] give up my sons
[1:45:53] give up my daughters
[1:45:58] are you with me you've got the spirit of
[1:46:00] god inside of you
[1:46:01] and lay claim on your children
[1:46:06] these are promises in god's word oh i
[1:46:08] don't know if they're going to make it
[1:46:10] you cast that devil out
[1:46:13] well brother simon you know if they're
[1:46:14] predestinated to make it you
[1:46:16] claim them you claim your loved ones
[1:46:20] don't look at the condition they're in
[1:46:23] but
[1:46:23] say lord jesus as you got a hold of my
[1:46:27] life lord
[1:46:28] get ahold of their life lord
[1:46:31] let me just tell you they might have to
[1:46:33] pass through the sea
[1:46:34] they might have to pass through a lot of
[1:46:37] affliction
[1:46:38] but what he said i'll be with you
[1:46:41] god won't lose one
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:44] [Applause]
[1:46:47] it's a paradox of his power
[1:46:55] i will strengthen them verse 12
[1:46:58] i will strengthen them in the lord and
[1:47:01] they shall walk up and down in his name
[1:47:05] saith the lord
[1:47:10] he that is feeble
[1:47:13] shall be as david amen
[1:47:21] what did god tell he speaks this is this
[1:47:24] is god speaking to israel
[1:47:26] in the book of job when god speaks in
[1:47:29] many places in the old testament
[1:47:32] of israel coming back into their land he
[1:47:35] speaks of them
[1:47:38] as they are dead but he said i
[1:47:42] will bring them to life in ezekiel the
[1:47:46] valley of dry bones
[1:47:48] in the book of isaiah thy dead men shall
[1:47:51] live you
[1:47:54] who were dead in sin in trespasses
[1:47:59] has he quickened
[1:48:03] and this is where the testimony comes
[1:48:05] out we say
[1:48:06] that in confession to the lord let the
[1:48:09] weak say i am strong
[1:48:11] that scripture it comes right at the end
[1:48:14] of scriptures right before it in the
[1:48:15] book of joel that speak of beating
[1:48:18] the swords into plowshares letting the
[1:48:21] weak say i'm strong is not a scripture
[1:48:23] for the millennium
[1:48:25] it's a scripture heading into it
[1:48:30] where israel can say
[1:48:34] i am strong where you can say
[1:48:38] i am strong i can do all things
[1:48:43] through christ who strengthens me
[1:48:46] be strong in the lord and in the power
[1:48:49] of his
[1:48:50] might our lord jesus the bible says
[1:48:54] crucified in weakness but he was raised
[1:48:58] by the power of god
[1:49:04] he is our strength
[1:49:07] he is our strength the holy ghost the
[1:49:10] word of god
[1:49:12] in the life and heart of a believer
[1:49:16] don't just leave it in the prophet don't
[1:49:19] leave it in your pastor
[1:49:20] don't leave it in your daddy don't leave
[1:49:22] it in your mama
[1:49:24] don't leave it in your husband don't
[1:49:26] leave it in your wife
[1:49:28] if this same spirit that
[1:49:31] raised up jesus from
[1:49:34] the grave dwell in
[1:49:38] you it will quicken
[1:49:42] your mortal body
[1:49:46] it's the paradox of his
[1:49:50] power that god would take
[1:49:54] a people a life that is of weakness
[1:50:00] and god will take that life that
[1:50:02] surrenders to him
[1:50:03] and make his power known
[1:50:07] through that life
[1:50:11] i say be it unto me lord amen
[1:50:15] amen
[1:50:19] what must i do surrender yield
[1:50:22] as a vessel yield to him
[1:50:25] yield to him the more we can empty out
[1:50:29] the more he can pour himself in
[1:50:32] as he told the little woman as
[1:50:35] elisha told her she said
[1:50:39] there's a creditor that's come from my
[1:50:41] land
[1:50:42] and they're going to take this land from
[1:50:44] me and they're taking my children from
[1:50:46] me
[1:50:48] and she needs to know how do i deal with
[1:50:50] this situation
[1:50:52] i've got somebody who's coming to take
[1:50:53] what belongs to me
[1:50:56] you know what elisha tells her he
[1:50:58] doesn't say
[1:50:59] oh go get all the military go get all of
[1:51:02] this go get all of that
[1:51:03] no no you know what he says go tell your
[1:51:06] sons
[1:51:08] go borrow empty vessels
[1:51:11] from your neighbor how is she gonna
[1:51:14] reclaim
[1:51:16] what belongs to her empty
[1:51:20] vessels how's she going to
[1:51:23] stop the creditor from coming empty
[1:51:27] vessels that become full
[1:51:30] of oil
[1:51:34] so as a wise virgin
[1:51:38] she gets vessels ready
[1:51:41] for the miracle
[1:51:45] and he told him don't just borrow a few
[1:51:50] gather all you can
[1:51:55] they bring them all in the house they
[1:51:58] close the door
[1:51:59] behind them
[1:52:02] this is not a public display
[1:52:07] this is a intimate working
[1:52:10] of the holy ghost
[1:52:14] the rest of the world won't believe it
[1:52:17] he's not in there
[1:52:18] making oil the god
[1:52:22] whose earth the earth is mine he said
[1:52:26] and the fullness thereof god created
[1:52:30] in that room when the door was shut
[1:52:34] god created what was able to
[1:52:37] answer the creditor's question
[1:52:40] amen he that had a lean against him
[1:52:44] the oil came as an abstract
[1:52:47] the oil came to move all that was
[1:52:51] against her
[1:52:54] and everything that the devil
[1:52:58] would like to try to take from you
[1:53:01] what's the answer
[1:53:02] empty vessels
[1:53:07] empty vessels what did he have in the
[1:53:10] upper room
[1:53:12] what did they have in the upper room
[1:53:14] empty
[1:53:16] vessels they had hauled
[1:53:20] themselves into the upper room
[1:53:25] what does god call by his word as he
[1:53:28] calls for israel to come together
[1:53:30] he's calling for empty vessels
[1:53:34] and he comes to cleanse
[1:53:38] and fill their life
[1:53:43] samuel my vessel let me just tell you
[1:53:48] even if you already have the oil
[1:53:52] of the holy ghost in your life
[1:53:55] listen to me now even with the oil of
[1:53:59] the spirit of god in your life
[1:54:02] say god fill every
[1:54:05] fiber of my being
[1:54:10] i want to empty up every excuse
[1:54:16] i want to empty up all of samuel's pride
[1:54:21] because samuel's got a lot of stinking
[1:54:22] pride i want to empty up
[1:54:26] why because the more that i can empty
[1:54:30] the more he can feel amen
[1:54:36] i can't feel it but i can empty by
[1:54:39] saying lord
[1:54:41] i surrender lord i let down
[1:54:46] and here the door is closed
[1:54:51] the curtains drop the rest are on the
[1:54:53] outside
[1:54:54] not knowing what's going on but
[1:54:58] out of that little room
[1:55:01] walks a little woman with
[1:55:04] a word that has become substance
[1:55:09] and as she walks out with that oil
[1:55:12] it's through that oil that she pays
[1:55:16] off the debt
[1:55:19] and she lives the rest of her life
[1:55:23] by that oil hallelujah
[1:55:30] this is the lord's doing and it is
[1:55:33] marvelous in our eyes
[1:55:37] the coming of the holy ghost it makes
[1:55:40] known
[1:55:41] you're redeemed the call of the spirit
[1:55:44] of god upon your life
[1:55:46] is calling you into the place of
[1:55:48] redemption
[1:55:49] he's letting you know i have already
[1:55:51] redeemed you come and accept what
[1:55:53] belongs to you
[1:55:55] what's he doing he's calling you into
[1:55:57] that little place
[1:55:59] to where he can shut you off from the
[1:56:01] world
[1:56:02] and unveil himself and i am the one who
[1:56:06] answers and deals with the sin question
[1:56:08] i
[1:56:09] am the one who settles the debt i am the
[1:56:12] one
[1:56:13] who is your ransom
[1:56:18] from every home
[1:56:25] let's pray heavenly father
[1:56:32] you've delivered your word to our hearts
[1:56:38] now lord you know
[1:56:42] i know how the enemy
[1:56:45] would have wanted to battle but you're
[1:56:48] greater
[1:56:51] your word has went forth
[1:56:55] there's not enough devils out of hell
[1:56:58] that can keep your word from coming to
[1:57:00] pass
[1:57:02] there's not enough unbelief
[1:57:06] that can stop when a heart begins to
[1:57:10] believe not believing what they can do
[1:57:15] but to believe
[1:57:18] the living god is right here among us
[1:57:22] and he's calling me
[1:57:25] dear jesus i pray this morning
[1:57:30] if there's any lord that the door
[1:57:34] the curtains as it were around their
[1:57:35] life has not dropped down
[1:57:40] may they receive that invitation this
[1:57:42] morning
[1:57:45] may the lord take of their life and
[1:57:47] surrender
[1:57:49] and i pray god for our hearts
[1:57:53] lord lives that you've already sealed
[1:57:57] filled with your spirit
[1:58:01] lord i come back you draw me right back
[1:58:03] to this place
[1:58:05] so i'll pray this is also
[1:58:09] lord if there's any whether they're here
[1:58:11] or streaming by way of internet
[1:58:14] maybe lord they felt
[1:58:18] the holy spirit upon their life
[1:58:23] but they know it's never went to the
[1:58:25] depth of their soul
[1:58:28] where that fountain becomes a spring of
[1:58:32] living water out of their life
[1:58:35] issuing forth holiness cleanliness
[1:58:38] not generated by self but that which is
[1:58:46] propelled
[1:58:48] by the strength of the lord in their
[1:58:49] life
[1:58:51] may they invite you to be the lord
[1:58:56] of their life may they say lord
[1:59:01] go deep in me lord take me into the
[1:59:05] depths of god
[1:59:08] and lord for those
[1:59:12] those of us lord that
[1:59:15] filled with your oil
[1:59:20] if there's some wicks that need to be
[1:59:22] trimmed
[1:59:25] maybe from the cares of life it's gotten
[1:59:28] to look gotten a little
[1:59:29] carboned up this is lamp trimming time
[1:59:35] time to remove the carbon of the world
[1:59:39] time to remove what would hinder that
[1:59:42] flame
[1:59:44] from burning because the flame itself
[1:59:48] is what manifests the quality
[1:59:51] of the oil that's in it
[1:59:55] [Music]
[1:59:56] lord forgive us lord
