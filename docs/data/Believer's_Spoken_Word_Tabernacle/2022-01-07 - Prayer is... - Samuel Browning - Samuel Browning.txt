father lord what a privilege it is lord to be gathered together lord you see and you know there's many needs lord among us lord different ones dealing with different sicknesses lord in their body father we just ask that god that you would just continue to move for each one of them father we're thankful god as we hold that promise lord in you lord you said you'd take sickness from among us we know that these bodies are still sin lord as much as we try they're still under that curse that soul that's been redeemed it's been anchored in you then lord we have promises that through this journey that you've given to us then lord is your children we are thankful for this bread lord for healing is the children's brain it's opportunities lord that you come and you make yourself known the lord where our bodies would feel and respond in a certain way but god how that resurrection power moves in oh god as a witness lord father one of these days lord as we stand there lord on the other side there'll never be another prayer that's offered up for sickness there'll never be another prayer that's offered up oh god for discouragement or any situation at all lord for any lord soul or life or deliverance but everything will be met lord in that moment so lord we just ask for your grace that as we're journeying lord through this this moment lord this space of time that god that you would give us of your grace that we might be able lord to stand and lord move faithfully in the purpose o god that you've allotted for each of our lives lord i pray that god that you'll just lord continue to watch over lord us as an assembly as your children lord not only as we gather here but lord knowing that god as they go and we go into our different places lord to work places lord that we would have to go lord and different things to be done but lord we we do all of these things in the name of jesus christ to know that god that it's you that goes before us it's you that's going with us lord and we're trusting you lord every step of the way lord god for lord you've never failed us lord you cannot fail lord your word you exalt your word above your name lord and we know that your name lord is your word being revealed you will keep your word o god and lord we just ask you that you would keep us lord may you continue to strengthen every one of your children lord watch over them lord minister lord healing to their bodies those that lord are sick lord we pray oh god that lord you'll just minister in a special way for every need now lord as we turn our attention to the word just ask that you had just come lord and break the bread of life to us don't mean to step out of the way lord that you'll just step into this channel and lord just express those things that you've inspired to my heart lord i i desire to be led by you this evening oh god that you'll be the speaker lord that every one of us that lord are gathered whether by way of here over the internet where lord our walk and our life in you would be the lord enriched oh god with the spiritual vitamins of the word we just give ourselves to you now father in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen i want to just read the text here this evening out of luke chapter 11 in verse 1. i want to just perhaps mention a few things while i have you standing just for a minute and just just kind of some housekeeping things that we have to kind of do or visit even in this time we we we know that even in the area that we're living in uh there's been it's quite a quite a surge that's taking place um even right now and you know these things they eventually they spike and then it goes down but we just just want to just admonish you and ask you which you've done a wonderful job as an assembly i've had different ones have sent me text or you've called if you've had a question about coming if you didn't feel well or you were in contact with someone and we certainly appreciate all of that because we we want to be mindful of one another and so i just want to you know ask you because i've had to ask um even of different ones you know hey we need to get a test and so forth because it's it's a benefit for you as well as anybody else to know these things and these are just some of the protocols we have to go through and i can tell you for my own self as i stand here we've already had to do it at different times already through this year in order for me to stand here and minister not because i had i had something a symptom here or there but even with um our boys at times and so we'd we work to try to get a rapid test and i know right now it's the it's the hardest thing in the world to try to get a test uh you try to get the tests and things i remember back during december it was booked clear into i think the first parts of january who knows where they're at now and uh i know even with trying to find uh one of those little test kits or whatever they put out and it's just it's it's it's kind of a it's a place where we we're at and it's uh something we don't want to look at like a hardship i want to look at it in a manner and say lord just help me you just direct me you know one of the things we're looking at last week when daniel daniel was unaltered he prayed he did everything he did from before and there's things we can do we can we can stand on the word of god but we also remember standing on the word of god is also having patience in all things sometimes our patients can we're kind of thin and we can get frustrated and sometimes ah i'm just gonna but we want to go through everything in in the right way and we have been i want to commend you for that and i just say it like this if you're you know if you're sick or you're sniffles or whatever more or you're not feeling well and you've got a question about it please call brother gomez or brother richard because if chances are if you call me at some time and at any time and you don't get my phone right away that's because i'm probably i'm in the middle of even praying or i'm in the middle of a thought and sometimes i don't even break out of those channels even for my family they know i'm in a channel and just i'm going moving in that channel so it would be very very good just to call brother richard or brother gomez and uh you know if you've got questions about something but if you're sick just just be cautious about it whether you or someone in your family like i said i've stood here at times when i've had to make sure i had we had a test done so i know that one of the boys didn't have something before i came and stood here and ministered and if you have any questions it's just like the things i know i say follow the cdc protocol and you think which one you know it's you know it changes changes changes changes everything is changes but there's some things that's very clear even right now within the five to seven days and you know and just to say it it's it's very um very clear that's out there if you have questions without be laboring it's very simple if you you know if you're sick or you know or someone's in your family just um err on the side of caution you can call us you can talk to us and that's been done i know that i commend you as even those who are not here tonight that's been done uh to where you've done that very very well and i just want to encourage you even throughout this time so let's look here in the word and if i forgot something i'll pick it up lord willing on sunday but here on luke chapter 11 verse 1 and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john taught his disciples and he said unto them when you pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth give us day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil amen may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i'd like to read a quote here out of birth pains i don't know if they have those things up okay so we don't have them you just have to listen to me then but i want to say i just appreciate brother alexander being here and ministering in the word of the lord of what god has spoken and you know i my wife told me she had received the link from down there we were at brother reyes and she said oh my goodness she said you read the same text that was that was read here and i i think was just a little bit of a different angle and some things and um but i just in it all we we thank god for his mercy and i really appreciate your prayers it's just always a wonderful time to get down there with um to be there with brother ray and the saints i always told them i said it's kind of like a second home i just always enjoy enjoy going there and being with being with those brothers and sisters there so much and the message birth pains and i want to just take a title here tonight and just some things just really um burning on my heart just some inspiration just from some messages and things i've been just going through and listening without even this intent but certain things just begin to drop at a certain time and i'd just like to speak on two little words prayer is prayer is in the message birth pains brother bram says you know we could sing too much we could shout too much till we got hoarse we could sing at the wrong time or shout at the wrong time but here's one thing we're never out of order when we're praying and we realized brother brown how many times when he would even come to the platform and he would speak to the people and give direction he said now even while the word is going forth you be in a spirit of prayer so it's moving into that place even as the word is going forth you're entering in it with a spirit of prayer the lord passed by my way lord speak to my heart lord direct the man of god and he quotes the scripture out of timothy i would that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without doubt father it is the greatest privilege that a mortal ever had was to close his eyes and open his heart and speak to you we know that you hear if you could just if we could just believe that you hear for jesus said if you ask the father anything in my name it'll be granted that was on conditions if we wouldn't doubt it and we understand there's all sorts of things that can try to come at us to doubt and there's sometimes where we don't in ourselves feel like as though our prayer is going anywhere but if i can get to it to certain places here tonight its faith itself is not based upon our feelings prayer being heard and prayer being answered has nothing to do with our feelings it has everything to do with our faith and this is where that when our heart and our life is lined up and just just settled with the lord then we can have a confidence that when we're praying that that prayer is going up and there's nothing can stand in the way of that prayer from being answered and being heard so i just want to take just a few a little a few things here on what prayer is and just say it in this way there's probably not a religion that and i and i say religion that is out there where there's not some form of prayer in it or where they do some sort of prayer or chants or something but to understand that prayer it's not a ritual i never forget when my uncle ronald he was there and we were he was marrying one of my cousins and he was standing there you know and here uh you had another man in that particular church where the cousin was getting married and you know he was all robed out and he had everything you know and they were practicing for the wedding and he looked over at my uncle and he said he said where's your prayer book at he said where are you going to pray and he said i don't have a prayer book and um my uncle ronald you know he said well you don't have a prayer book he said no he said well how do you pray so i just pray from my heart i just talked to him from my heart and that's prayer is is something it's very real it's not a ritual it's not even anything that should that we should even make a ritual or make a tradition this is why the scriptures would admonish admonish us to being instant in prayer to praying always because prayer is is a worship prayer is an atmosphere prayer is a place that we are able to live in it's not a ritual it's not something that well i have to do this prayer is a worship it's a time of deep sincerity and consecration in the presence of the lord i can i can say this as we go through it that there no matter what the situation is within a life no matter what you are feeling within your life hurt heartache disappointment discouragement whatever the feeling might be you can you can put it all together but there is nothing that can really minister to you and i when we come through those points in our life as prayer can and prayer meaning that it's just as you and i we would talk to one another and you know there's times when we talk to one another and maybe sometimes with my wife or she can say honey what's wrong and i oh i'm nothing she knows me enough by now that maybe there's something on my mind or something's wrong and you see if we can just in that moment with god god already knows what's on our heart and you're not in defeat when you say lord i'm hurting you're not in defeat you're there before the very one who's able to minister the remedy that you and i have need of for hurt there's not a prescription you can take for hurt there's prescriptions that will drown you or try to drown that hurt out but there is not a prescription that a mortal can take that will release hurt you can have stitches put in a in a wound here on your arm hand wherever you can even have that of a bone that is broken you can have that set but there is none that can heal the spirit a wound or a herd like the lord jesus can he knows what it is to be wounded he he took all of that for the chastisement of our peace and we can go to him in honesty you might say well i'm afraid the enemy will hear me you've got a channel that's open between you and god when you go to god in prayer you can be open and honest before god and invite him in to minister to your need god doesn't want us and he does he doesn't want us coming before him and pretending you know uh many things that we could talk about with hurt and you know we could start quoting things and quoting scripture but you know we just save our time if we just cut to the chase and say lord i'm hurting or lord this situation here this has been said or this has taken place or this is going on the job you know we know all of the we know the scriptures we know the quotes but prayer that doesn't nullify that prayer is the avenue to come in contact with god and i can tell you i know there's witnesses out here as well i'm a witness there comes a release in your life to be able to handle those things you could tell me you could tell anybody else but it'll never release it but when you get in prayer with god god's the one he'll release it many times when i can stand and talk with others and speak to them and point them into those places even in that time there's a relief that'll come but how can courage get on into prayer and you'll find as you put your heart out before god god will come on the scene prayer is a place of openness prayer is not a place to be closed off there's times where you don't want to know and let the right hand know what the left hand is doing even in the body is that right yet the bible would say confess our faults one to another it's having wisdom so there should be that of a love of god god will place relationships in the body so that you and i might have those that we can go to and pray and we will pray for one another yet there's times where within we don't let the left know what the right is doing we just go before god in prayer that's a channel that's given to you and i in prayer here in matthew chapter 6 verse 5 when thou prayest now notice how jesus has expressed this when thou prayest thou shall not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward well what would their reward be wow man they can really pray they're really people of prayer but that doesn't mean they're people of prayer jesus remember he spoke to the pharisees the same ones he's speaking of now calling them hypocrites they would go into a widow's house and they would make a long prayer it was all about attention for themselves prayer is not about me prayer is not about you sometimes we start out with our needs we start out with these different things but prayer is really not about me prayer is about you and i coming into that contact with god and god releasing to you and i the strength that we have need of sometimes the answer doesn't come right away sometimes the situation doesn't dissolve but this is where the bible says that we receive strength paul writes of this in first corinthians 10 in psalms 86 it speaks of it we go from strength unto strength it's strength that we receive from god now notice but when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut the door pray to the father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly so remember within these scriptures i'm reading you remember within the three polls of brother adam's ministry we have the first poll you know the taking of the hand and here what would take place upon the hand would speak brother branham was instructed by the angel how to read that of what was taking place the disease that was going on in the body then it came there the discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart is that right then the third phase of that would be the very opening of the word come into that place of a union to where christ and his bride would come together in a full union where the bride walks under the headship of the word of god when we're brought into that place of supreme and complete victory where we're walking in that place that as brother branham would see that in the vision and he wasn't understanding what was taking place but remember he would see this great gathering of people then he would say well there's going to be a prayer line and you know the prayer line how long it was and then his attention would be directed to this little room a little place that was there and remember brother branham was noticing within this as it was directed there how that there were people coming into that little prayer room on cots some on crutches and as they came into that place they passed through there and on the other side they were no longer on crutches they were no longer on a cop and there was a person asking them standing there with a notepad and asking them what happened what happened in there and this was their testimony i don't know what happened but they knew something happened see that's a reality of a word experience that you know something has happened in your life it's a word of god that is set down and it has changed us it's not some location out here that we have to go to it's the living christ that is among us the living god that is right here among us that when we can go to him in prayer then we find such a release i never forget that here you know and individuals were sitting here tonight and years ago i think maybe back in 2005 or four or three i don't know and i was preaching on those on the different within that of the little room and i'm just speaking on that in a sunday morning service and after the service was over here a brother got down and began to pray and the things that he was getting ready to pray about he was getting ready to pray about certain things god remove this lord dissolve this instead what began to come out of his mouth was we begin to thank god for the deliverance because it was already gone why we are right here in the presence of almighty god this is the presence of the living god it's me it's coming into his presence let me tell you something he's close he's right where you're at he comes right there to your heart all you have to do is enter in when you sense that how the spirit of god is moving in your life that's the water being troubled that's the time to move into it whatever he says to you move right into that at that moment in time let it be spontaneous as it comes to you move with that pulsation so i i want to say with this and i i trust that i didn't move too far off on that but when thou prayest notice he's telling he's instructing that to enter in to that secret place that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to go into a closet in your house what it means is it's a place because you'll find in the scriptures that even as they would resort to prayer by riverside is that right the bible tells us that in the book of acts prayer is a place where you and i can get alone solitude with god brother branham as you know i would hear different testimonies when i was in jeffersonville this past year i can hear these things on tape as well but sometimes you have certain insights that are given to you how sometimes brother branham himself he would just get out and drive just to talk to the lord just to get away just to break away sometimes you understand we know how it is sometimes it's just the monotony of the situation but there is something that propels our heart we want to speak to almighty god oh my now notice this he said when you pray in verse 7 and but when you pray notice he's not saying say a prayer but he says when you pray praying is just like if you and i sat down at a table for coffee or we sat down to talk or we're in the living room or wherever we're at we sit down and we talk i mean you don't want me approaching you with a bunch of puffed up language thou paul i love us though god doesn't interested in all the you don't have to have king james english to press god as a matter of fact you may not even know the words but you can send up the abcs like the little boy who just simply said to abc's he had confidence that god knew what he had need of and god would put the words together god's not interested in that you and i both i hope you do you appreciate people that are just real and genuine people that you can just simply be yourself around is that right you just you want to be there and that's what god wants he wants out of you and i he wants us to be ourself to let it all to let it down because if there's something in our life that's not right he's the one that can help us he's not the one we should be running from we ought to be running to him whatever that we have need of he's asked you and i over and over and over his word ask me ask me ask me oh my don't use vain repetition repetitions as the heathen do for they think they shall be heard for their much speaking but be you not therefore like unto them for your father knoweth the things you have needed before you ask him just just drawing out of this message i want to read this out of the message the supernatural and i just just just just listening just meditating on some of these things and brother brahma is talking about the hidden life and the life behind the veil and how god's made a way for us to come behind that veil he comes into that place of prayer he said prayer is not a perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to god prayer is not get down shut your eyes thinking about your washing or your work you're doing and we didn't understand brother simon i don't try i know neither do i it just comes we have to move beyond it right maybe it's thinking about a job that you're going to do and how do i do this to this and you're you know you've just been thinking about it but all of a sudden here you're in prayer and you find yourself thinking about don't get defeated just say lord help me to move beyond this barrier lord because me focusing on it never got it done before but i know that lord that all that i have need of including that issue i can find that answer in you lord prayer is a sincere thing it's talking to god it's not get down shut your eyes thinking about your washing or your work you're doing and say lord help me and john and he'll miss jones and so forth that's not prayer that's repeating some words but prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you're in the presence of god and you're moving to to then in the deepest sincerity now watch this approach first it's a worship o jehovah how i love you that's first notice teach us how to pray this is how he says when you pray say our our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name that's worship thy kingdom come thy will be done notice i we want your will we want the influence of that that kingdom that which is in the unseen to affect this visible realm the unseen to contact the unseen inside of me that it might become visible in my life see it's placing ourselves prayer is placing ourselves under him so first it's worship because i i could we could ask you to raise your hands how many times where we go you go into prayer and you don't feel like praying come on this this this body does this the body doesn't say hey let's go pray no the body doesn't say the but you get down to pray oh have you paid this bill ooh have you looked at this oh have you noticed this oh have you know that it's you see what it is it's satan trying to distract it it's not that you're evil so just either lying it's not that there are receptors that are still in this flesh in that carnal part about you and i this is why we have to bring it to the lord in prayer and even when you go to god in prayer at times when you don't feel like it you feel like my i just you know i feel like i failed today or i feel like hey hey you can't even approach god in that way just be honest and say lord today you know what i really don't feel so great but lord i want to come and enter into your presence because lord you're a sanctifier you're a cleanser i want to talk to you lord yes oh my just be real prayer prayer is how and that worship and you'll find yourself just beginning to worship and you know sometimes the reason that we don't enter in and think of all of everything that goes on in life sometimes it's just like with prayer we're trying to fit prayer in just like we try to fit dinner in right if we try to we're just trying to say well where did it get to today or where did this get to today or where did this and we're working to try to fit prayer in i i know this that even when my wife when you know when we had our boys things changed my wife was one you know when she wasn't working before we had the boys for paul my wife was was you know she would be off during the day she would have her time and when she didn't uh wasn't working and i mean she would be off in in the one spare bedroom and you know she had her time but now all of a sudden when the kids come along you don't have everything's not controlled you don't have everything controlled but this is where prayer this is where we learn even in all of our lives that prayer is not a ritual so that does that means it doesn't have to be in an altar it doesn't have to be beside my bed i don't even have to be on my knees but prayer is a condition of the heart you can enter into a moment of prayer and i looked at that many times again for my wife over the ironing board over times when she was making you know uh you know things for the for for the boys and things and you know just everything's on such a you look at the schedule and everything's all sort so you know seems like it's all scattered but there are things i'll say it like this with prayer there's things that we can ask god even in our lives as brothers and on and on to say lord i want to be very intentional about this so lord help me and show me we're saying teach us to pray i'd say lord help me to see lord the the what would be the best time or where i can move into these times asking god and taking advantage of these moments and of these times and don't get beat down if some things come happening within a day's time but don't ever become complacent with that either it's the balance so first it's a worship sometimes you get lost you'll get lost in worship oh jehovah i love you just begin to you know what you can sing i mean you can sing even if you can't sing you can sing you can begin to sing you can begin to talk to him elisha wasn't in an atmosphere to bring the prince of god down so he said bring a minstrel sometimes put on some instrumental music put on some other music are you with me we're talking about what prayer is and how to approach these things prayer is a time of really being shut in with god and that should be the very focus and say lord i want to be shut away in your presence lord then after the worship of prayer then you come with a sincere heart asking if you abide in me not go out from behind the curtains in the world today remember he's talking about the tabernacle and run around and try to get back in the curtains tonight if you abide in me and my words abide in you otherwise if you're like aaron's rod that's pulled up to the shekinah glory by the golden pot of manna where you can eat it at any time and your soul is refreshed and blooming and yielding abiding if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it'll be given to you when we look at that in the in the word thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth even as it is in heaven i don't have to tell one of you tonight that you realize that we're still walking in a mortal body we get tired we get weary we still have that within our body and to recognize that that of the kingdom itself coming down it's not so much that the kingdom itself or that it's god coming down here rather it's god taking us up there it's that going into the realms going into his presence and i don't want to get into that tonight but there's all around the things that you can't see sometimes you can experience it you can see it sometimes in a service you can feel it even when you're praying you can feel it at different times it feels like an atmosphere you're trying to get through and it just seems like it's an atmosphere that's just wanting to just come upon things just remember what that is it's spirits that's out there it's trying to hinder but don't operate are you hearing me now don't operate by your feelings it's in that time where you've got to operate by faith jesus stood there before lazarus turns and said father i thank thee for i know thou hearest me always when daniel prayed he didn't get the answer for 21 days later i don't want to deal with that tonight but his prayer was heard the first time he prayed you say what happens if we go by feelings well you know what happens if we go by feelings well i don't want to be acting you're not acting you're standing on god's word and there's times we stand on god's word when we don't feel inspired when we don't feel you know like my goodness no we stand on his word because it's his word and his word is true and his word cannot fail and that's where we even want to say god even in that hour being honest lord help me i don't want to stand on my feelings braham said it like this prayer is not exactly bringing god down to man it's bringing man up to god as you pray you lose sight of these earthly things you sway out into somewhere else way beyond and on and on and on till you become into his presence and brother branham would take us there and show us think about standing before the presence of god and in his presence before his throne even for that person who has done wrong you can't accuse him before the throne now in any of the other places you can accuse them lord they've done me wrong and they've done but when you get before the throne you can't stand there and accuse him but what you find yourself doing is is entering in on their behalf and looking and saying lord they didn't mean to do that well by the same i don't know if they did or not but you see you're entering beyond the earthly atmosphere and god's letters god's letting us know even by way of this and we can take take many scripture but letting us know by way of this there is victory in prayer it's victory and prayer it lifts us up above the earthly confines our feelings and let downs and situations and on and on and i'll say it in this manner again that prayer itself brother branham would say it let me just add another it's a key that opens every door it's a key that opens every door and brother brahm thanks the people and he says regarding prayer he says that's the secret to all the mysteries of god that's the key that opens the door to everything of god is prayer it's the key it's more on that part but i want to just move on so prayer is staying in contact with the heavenly father it's staying in fellowship it's just like right here i'm not going to be too much longer but i don't want to i'm just going to be a couple more moments but prayer you know it's staying in fellowship how many times you sit down with somebody and say hey brother what's been going on let's let's have some coffee and catch up why because you had a lot of time did maybe you've seen one another but you haven't talked to one another you can come to church you see him working but maybe you haven't talked to him maybe haven't really been talked to him and really had that openness with him but prayer is fellowship if there's someone if i can say it in this way that you understand it if there's one person you want to be buddies with it's with the lord jesus if there's one person you want to tell everything it's him see somebody see you you get within things here and think about it you know you can have a situation going on and you go tell this person you go tell that person of course nowadays the way things are people just tell everybody on facebook is that right that's not what a christian does can we have an access to go to god in prayer and it doesn't you can you can you can you could tell other people they can't help you but god can help you you can tell them you're just as burdened when you leave from talking to them but prayer is is a place that you can stay in fellowship you stay in contact and it's necessary as an individual as a person you can say well i believe i've got the holy ghost then as you have the holy spirit in your life you must stay in fellowship you must stay in contact with god and and i say it in this way and it's not in a way necessarily to scold you but it's a way to say praying over our oatmeal is not prayer that's part of prayer receive all things with thanksgiving but that's not our prayer life but our prayer life is and where there's a time it's a way with god where we have time we're getting away with god and sometimes those things vary in our life sometimes you'll have more time in certain seasons of life certain times of life even during a week sometimes you'll have more time on this day or this day don't get all down because i don't have to have time this day or this day but look at the times and the days that you do have and make the most of it it's storing up prayer is storing up i'm going to read this statement here just a moment prayer is is extracting there from the presence of god and you you and i both know what it is when we are in god's presence you come out of god's presence and i tell you it doesn't matter what has been taking place or what's going on it's just you've got such a rest you've got a piece about it even how you're looking at things because you're no longer looking at it we're no longer looking at it through earthly earthly means think about the lord jesus you had to stay in fellowship now watch this it's not it's not supper person remember god became one of us where god came down and god so became one of us as he created and made his own tabernacle that he could dwell in so i want you to think of this hear the lord jesus in luke 6 12 it says it came to pass in those days that when he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to god on and on you can find to the scriptures that the lord jesus spent much time in prayer he was the bridegroom he was the keystone to the old testament the rapture of the old testament saints and here look where his walk was at he spent much time in prayer brother branham is taking us into a place on the healing of jairus's daughter and he refers back to this place in the scripture he says just in the previous of this chapter or i think it's a luke 8 where he's speaking of jairus's daughter being healed we find there a place where the son of god spent so much time in prayer and if jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and i have to spend in prayer much time in prayer if you only knew what time in prayer meant i'm just going to touch this here sometimes when you're in prayer god changes the complete destination of different things that's going to happen anybody felt like you were between a rock and a hard place you go into prayer and something and it seems like you know we could sit down and talk and say brother samuel there's just no way around this there's just no way around it and as humanly speaking as we could see we would be right there's no way around it humanly speaking but this is the access that we have in prayer we go to god in prayer and knowing having this consolation that god can change the whole situation moses spoke prophetically inspiration caught him there as he stood before the red sea we're between a rock and a hard place inspiration caught him but then you find the flesh part come out and he begins to speak to the lord first inspiration he spoke to the people then he comes to god and god speaks to him and says why are you crying unto me when you when you read that in the scripture when you read it i don't read it where it sounds like that he's crying but you see god hears what's behind our words and god could hear that within moses voice and it seemed like you know here inspiration spoke not moses inspiration spoke to the people of god to stabilize them but then god is looking down there in moses and it seems as moses is crying and god speaks to that inner man on the inside that one who's been equipped with that meeting of the burning bush and god speaks to that man and reminds him i have commissioned you i have equipped you what is this red sea between you and the mountain i said i would bring you back to glory be to god he had an intimate moment with god where he was open had to be an openness brother joshua to where god could look down in there and god could see i can be i can be myself with moses i can let him know i can speak to him in this way and he'll side with the word it was an open channel and he spoke god moved that red sea he didn't just move the water they weren't walking on squishy ground they walked on dry land it was the breath of the lord of hosts that went forth it was his name as isaiah records it being uttered out that caused that sea depart there's times when you need a sea depart you need god you're a waymaker i need a way here lord prayer is a place that you can go to god sometimes when you're in the complete destination of different things that's going to happen he said he said god changes pardon me the complete destination of different things that's going to happen he said do you believe it he said it might be something fixing to happen and your prayer could change the whole situation the realm goes on into that into that quote and i'm just going to skip over certain things here just for this moment he reiterates how jesus spent much time in prayer when you look at this in john 6 the disciples went on without him that's a fly i would welcome that maybe babies let me know spring's coming buddy [Laughter] think of it think of it jesus spent much time in prayer to stay in contact to stay in fellowship it's just like between those of you that are married you know you can be in the same house and eating at the same dinner table and going through everything and sometimes you have to just say you know what we need to reconnect because even through the busyness of life you just have to say you know we need to reconnect you have some time we just we just just step away and just just just reconnect and you sense that that's the way it is with god there's times as you sense that you know what lord i just need to really reconnect and there's times that you may we've been in prayer but there's times where you say you know what i want to take some time this weekend or i want to take some i just i just want to get to god in prayer there's a lot of needs i don't know about you but there's a lot of needs there's needs there's different ones with paul and different things i write it on my calendar write it in notebooks write any different things trying to remember and it's not about that i have to remember at all neither is it to you to remember it all but we're a body god places things upon the hearts of his people i'm closing i'm going to close on this quote some of you think yeah right i am i'm not close here they went on without him brother adam said see he says they went on and i may not included this part on the display but he says they went on without him he said they were going in the absence of the holy spirit or christ then in visible form on the road over trouble set in usually if you start anywhere without christ trouble's on its roof just as soon as the devil sees you out of fellowship with christ right then he will set out for you as hard as he can just as soon as he sees you away from prayer away from consecration satan will catch you right then if he possibly can prayer prayer is prayer is our contact with god we stay in fellowship with god stay available as a channel of the living god it's a place that we can go to before the throne of god and talk openly with boldness can talk openly without any reservedness of speech and to know that he hears us and if he could hear moses and tell him not to cry how much more can he hear you and i and he's there to equip us with what we have need of and i'll say it in this manner if there's things that i could look at and say just even in this year i pray god help us even as a church that every one of us that our prayer life would deepen you know it's one thing we've had prayer meetings here at the church at times over the years but it's not just to have prayer at church it's to have prayer in her home and just ask god to just direct you and see the value as many other places i could have read to you tonight but there is prayer is is of such a value and just to think and think of it in that way to stay in fellowship to stay in contact with all mighty god it's a privilege that we've been granted brother brown called it the greatest privilege that we've ever been given is to enter in to his presence let's pray heavenly father lord jesus there's many things that i know over a very familiar subject lord that you would take us and there's many different avenues that more that we could go but we certainly only want to lord move in the avenues that you would see when we would have need of lord fathers we look into this tonight lord with prayer i pray oh god for every one of us lord i think as we start this new year out and i know we're already lord a number of days already into it but all god may just be what resonates in our heart just seeing that value of prayer and just to enter into that oh god just to take it lord into and to move into this channel knowing that not just when there's situations that come up like a red sea or a mountain but those are those are examples those are testimonies those are moments that where you convey to us by experience the power of prayer now lord you've placed this in our hands [Music] help us lord i pray that god that you would forgive us lord and help us lord to be more dedicated more sincere [Music] in these things lord i i believe and i i know it lord for a fact [Music] that god the effect of our services the effect of services the effect of lives being touched the effect or god of healing of deliverance the effect of these things oh god it's time that's spent in prayer it's not the ministry ministry is set forth to encourage to minister the word that our faith would rise within that finished as you would speak to us lord correct us where we're wrong so there will be no hindrance in fellowship and to encourage us to move closer move deeper lord i'm asking tonight that for every one of us lord myself lord included god i want a deeper prayer life in this year lord god a deeper prayer life that's the key over and over lord your prophet would say it in two different places that's the key that's a time that's a place of fellowship it's a place of openness it's a place of safety it's a place where lord we can be open with you and we can lord jesus move into a place to receive strength into our lives father i pray tonight no matter what that need is there might be one lord here tonight or listening that they might look at themselves and say what about me brother samuel i've not even come behind the veil yet but lord may they see and realize that that hunger that's in their life if the only event to that and lord come to you in prayer you said if we ask you for a piece of bread you won't give us a stone [Music] how much more they that ask for the holy ghost shall your heavenly father not give it lord whatever that need might be may there be a confidence lord that as they would approach and if there's something that would be out of line then god you are faithful to show whatever it would be out of line because the desire is to be lined up with you grant that father i pray tonight whatever the need is lord healing in the body the soul the spirit i just invite you to move in the name of jesus christ amen you know i thought very much of this is maybe you want to stand i thought of [Music] we look over a familiar point like this prayer is so many things sometimes it's looking at the value of what we have in our hand [Music] i've heard many different ones tell tell a similar story when i nine years ago or so when we purchased the black car that we have standing there and i'm looking at the key fob and i see lock and unlock and trunk and alarm but what's this other button with a circle with an arrow what's that i'm looking at i don't know what it is i had no id i didn't know what it was [Music] so i i asked so you know what i did i went over to the gentleman there were others were drawn up the contract and said hey what what is this button right here you don't know what it is no here's what he did he demonstrated it [Music] i seen where the lights came up i said oh my goodness you mean this car's got auto start that might not seem like a big deal to you but for me when i had to go and come out of the school at times i wanted them windows defrosted and other things like that but you see i had already made the decision on the car it was already mine i mean technically we're just finishing some things up but i didn't know what i had i didn't know what i had but somebody was there to let me know what i had and then even after that how to use it and what times to use it what's appropriate times and this that's how god comes down he lets us know this is the most powerful weapon i've given you it's kind of like that where he shows us look what this can do look how it look how it gonna move for you aren't you glad he comes down like that i'm so glad about that amen let's just sing let's just worship him just for a moment here he deserves more time but let's just just worship him again [Music] the world around me fade away [Music] oh yes jesus [Music] draw me closer lord foreign [Music] draw me closer lord to [Music] around [Music] oh draw me closer [Music] lord foreign [Music] let's pray together i have a prayer cloth in my hand i preach with it tonight it's gonna go to sister maria let's just agree to the lord agree together in prayer

ask that that same holy spirit lord would move down for our sister oh god and set in order lord and lord relieving her of all that discomfort and those spasms satan we adjure you in the name of jesus
