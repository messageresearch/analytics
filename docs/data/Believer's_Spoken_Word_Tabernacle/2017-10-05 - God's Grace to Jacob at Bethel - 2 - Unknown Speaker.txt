something way out there that's his life becoming preeminent in his body amen amen you love him you're so good to be back together again amen certainly appreciate your your prayers when we were gone we just had a I read a real good time and just glad to be back home there are the archives are on the men's meeting org so you can you can look those up if I believe they would be a blessing to you and I feel like I'm still trying to recoup those of you that's been in the men's meeting you know what I'm talking about from you go from right in I think the first sessions and is at 9:30 and then I don't think we left out of that room aside from lunch and of course I didn't go to dinner because I had to speak that night but and we didn't leave out there I think to attend or after so it's almost 12:00 over 12 hours there in just one six sessions one right after another and so the Lord was certainly merciful to us and just had so many many wonderful things that the Lord spoke to our hearts and challenged our lives I can say one thing I was challenged was really really really challenged and edified by the word of the Lord just to see not only the because the timing the hour that we are living in but then how that God just comes down to deal with our lives so that there is nothing that wonders what he want desires to do that nothing hinders that from coming forth so we certainly thank God for that we want to go right into the word tonight into Genesis 28 verse 10 and we want to read just a few portions of scripture verse 10 through verse 15 we've been reading from there and just trusting that God will give us direction to continue to move within those parts again tonight amen verse 10 and Jacob went out from bear sheba and went toward haram and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the Sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and laid down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land whereon thou liest the V will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and indeed and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whether thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee up amen let's just go to the Lord in a word of Prayer tonight Lord Jesus father we are standing here Lord God Lord in our post Lord here this evening and Lord as we are looking into your word Lord we are Lord truly in need of you Lord the author Lord who Lord gave your word Lord by inspiration Lord God from your very breath the Lord you your word Lord God you spoke Lord and moved upon Lord the prophets - right Lord every one of these Lord details and everything that goes with it Lord so we Lord are asking tonight Lord that you would just pour out Lord of the inspiration Lord upon our hearts and our lives that we might be able to receive Lord strength tonight Lord or God for our journey Lord that we are in Lord may you move Lord God for every need for every life right now Lord may you provide Lord God just exactly Lord as you see Lord fit Lord and what would be pleasing to you Lord we pray Lord we ask that you'll just have your way Lord forgive us Lord if we have said or thought anything wrong in any way Lord we commit ourselves Lord into your hand Lord and ask for your solemn Direction Lord that you would be glorified we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen and may God bless you as you're being seated I want to continue to speak on that thought God's grace to Jacob at Bethel and when you we zero in here on it we find of how that Jacob has we've been looking he doesn't come to this place as though that it holds significance for him but yet it is is there that God is going to meet Jacob and God is going to speak many things to Jacob even concerning his life this is a this is a time where that God is going to speak personally to Jacob and he's received counsel from his mother from his father but now he's he's going to have God speak to him right on and directly and God is going to we see in the scripture of God is promising him is committing himself to a fulfillment within Jacob's life and God is God always is commits himself to his word now when we look at it within Jacob's life right now Jacob if we can if we would type this out Jacob within his life he's not he's not been fully converted he's on his journey he has a desire for the birthright and go out his spoke to him gave him direction and now he meets God we're in that God makes known to him that he's the one that's been watching over his life all along and he will continue to watch over his life and bring him back into this place so when we're looking at this and we think of it in the scripture of how that Jacob laid down and the scripture said he comes into a place to where he slept and then he dreamed and when when he dreamed the scripture tells us in verse 12 that behold a ladder what he dreamed was a that of a ladder the set up on earth and the top of it reached to heaven and when you you think of this yeah I want you just to I want to just pause just for a moment in light of this that when we think of God's grace God's grace is not how that much of the world has interpreted God's grace to be they they look at God's grace as as as an allowance for permissiveness that God is somehow giving them a license and he understands that they can't live a victorious life but that's not what grace is all about grace is the grace of God is God providing the very remedy and what is needed that you are I cannot provide that's the grace of God so when we are looking at it we find God's grace if we just look at God's grace we find in the very beginning when this earth was in a condition of darkness and void it had not the ability for for it to transform the condition it was in it didn't have that but it needed it needed one greater than itself to upon the situation and we find that God's grace God seeing the need he speaks he speaks out his word and the Spirit of God begins to go in order to bring forth and perform the word that he's spoken that's the grace of God we see that that God's grace is there providing that even when the fall would take place in Eden that here when man was seeking to provide something to be able to stand before God's presence because they knew that they were not able to stand in his presence grace its South provided a voice to call him out of hiding grace provided the the blood of an innocent one grace provided clothing that they could stand in his presence that is the grace of God great the grace of God also provided when God looked upon the condition of the world and he's seen the the state that it was in yet there was one who by the name of Noah that God would make himself known to Noah of the impending judgment and he would also make known to Noah that that that this is the way of escape and I am your way of escape because it is the Word of God that came to Noah and that word itself it became the very Welling place the leadership the grace of God to Noah that Noah in that hour there was a way of escape provided that was God's grace it was God's grace that also when Abraham within his life he was down in the end and in the land of Babylon and to think of it even though that even in each of these that were speaking of the earth being a redeemable attribute of God even and how that God moves down upon the creation that has fallen those being attributes of God each one of these being attributes of God but yet being an attribute of God it is not something that the attributes of God are able to do on their own accord but they need one who is greater to move the scene and that one who moves on the scene then it supplies to them what they have need of in the hour and where they're at that's the grace of God so here God provided not only speaking to Abraham but then the leadership to bring Abraham out of the land where he was and then even to tell him when he arrives within the land that God have was calling him into grace was providing that so I think we're beginning to see a picture grace the grace of God does not leave us where it finds us that's not grace that brings disgrace Jude talked about there were men who crept in unawares who turned to grace the grace of our God and of our Lord Jesus Christ into lasciviousness they turned it into uncleanness but the grace of God it pipes within it the the power and authority to bring truly a deliverance and to bring the person or that one into the condition that God is requiring so we could go on and on with that but I think that that we see the point that how that grace itself is not something that Noah merited it's not anything that I any any person that we have spoken of here that they merited it but it is something that is sovereignly given by God because only through them by the grace of God can the children of God come out and meet the need and the challenge of the outter if it's not provided then we don't know which way to go so with the grace of God here's the leadership of God here's the Spirit of God it's it's directing in to fulfill God's purpose in that hour so then we we see within the midst of it that there is a strain that remains in fallen man and that strain that remains is just as it was in the very beginning when when man fell it was to do something of themselves rather than accept what God had provided it shows that there's nothing that we can do that God connect that God will accept but what we what we desire is to accept what God has provided and when we accept but God has provided and we live by that then it is God himself through that us accepting God's grace then it is God coming and working in our life him performing what He is calling for and grace not only makes known the way grace also brings and releases what is needed to bring about what he's calling for it that's the grace of God so here we find that when Jacob comes into this place here that as we've said before Jacob does not see this to be a place of significance but yet when he comes into it here we find that God makes himself known to Jacob and really there's two to two words that I'd like you to I wouldn't want to hone in on here tonight and that is looking at this ladder and looking at the stone because when we see this here brother Ram tells us in the message of over Jireh and he's giving that parallels how that the message of grace God gave it to Abraham unconditionally in the second paragraph of Jehovah Jireh he talks about how that he it lasted on on up until Exodus there to where then they themselves begin to put something into it as though they had to do it and then in the last the last paragraph he says just like Nimrod he had to have something to do so he built a tower but God just showed Jacob a ladder grace Jacob did not merit this ladder he comes to a place of rest he's in a place of exhaustion he can go no further and when he's in a place where now he dreams and what God does is showed to Jacob what he himself has provided that this is the answer think of how Nimrod Nimrod and those under an inspiration and inspiration to want to get to heaven sure there was an inspiration but Otis but notice what came along with that inspiration that that that inspiration whereby that they were anointed to move in that they were making stairs they were making of that which would have sinned up but yet it was a perversion because it was man's doings and anytime we take anything outside of what God has provided it's a perversion God lays it down so simple that you and I all that we must do is accept it and walk in it it does it doesn't mean it's not about whether you can explain it or not it comes back to what it comes back to is this is God's Word I just just was listening here earlier in the week and brother I'm speaking in the message in those Redemption messages Redemption and joy Redemption and completeness Redemption and power and in the message Redemption and completeness brother Graham says if I knew had friends that they had already went on over there and they come on and would they already went on and and they had made it but they came back to me and they told me brother Branham don't go any further it's not true it's not genuine it's not real brother Graham said I would steal go on anyhow he's paralleling that with how that even he says if I prayed for ten thousand tonight hey everyone I'm dying I'd be standing here tomorrow night praying for ten thousand more why because it's not based upon people's experiences this is cops word there's a lot of people that can have a lot of experiences but there's one that is true and it's solid and that's the Word of God that's what we're anchored on them said I would still keep going on I'll tell you the only thing here listen friends you know what that is that's an experience you hear me that's an experience there is nothing that could talk you out of it and experience is an anchor and I'm talking about the depth of an experience to where you've met God face to face and your life has changed forever it becomes everything to you that's an experience so here when we we see this this ladder this excess notice of how that the Scripture speaks of how that the ladder the ladder itself in verse 12 that it was set upon the earth and the top of it reached to heaven but it doesn't specify in the scripture where is the ladder set up on earth yet we know that ladder is going to be set up on earth Jacob knows that and he recognizes that reaches unto heaven so here is the access route here is the access the channel the opening to lift up out of this realm there's got to be something that can lift us out of here it was set up on the earth but it doesn't specify where upon the earth to whom upon the earth but we know that it says it reaches under heaven and the angels of God ascending and descending upon it and this we know verse 13 and the Lord stood above it they men and this is what the Lord said standing above it I am the Lord God of Abraham that father not Abraham that grandfather because I don't have grandchildren every one of my children are not they're not second born third born but every one of my children are first generation every one of my children are first born so he's declaring that I though you came through Isaac and Rebecca but I am your father so now the word is letting it be known as it standing above the ladder that I am your father they meant I have the complete oversight over your life in the message infallibility of God spoken word let me just go through this brother brems says we take Jakub he lays down God shuts him off and gives him a coma of a vision he looked up and he saw a ladder fastened up in heaven to God's throne and reached all the way to the earth and the angels ascending and descending on the ladder up and down now all through the years we find out that this was a beautiful promise here that God had promised a way of escape a ladder to climb on a sure foundation God had promised it but it was hooked in glory to the throne of God but where could he find a place on earth to hook it to now we're talking about a ladder I used to be afraid of heights and I still AM that probably seems like they don't make sense I don't like being up in high places but I will go up to high places is that Alright I really don't like climbing a ladder but I will climb on ladders but there's one thing about when I'm climbing on a ladder the first thing I'm checking is not just where it's resting but I also want to make sure the ground it's set on is solid I don't want it sitting you know when I go to climb enough to where it's already wobbly if it's wobbly down here when I get partway up it's going to even be further to me when I'm in that state further wobbly so there's got to be a firmness a surety down here amen no wonder as punkers to let every man work out his own salvation with fear and trembling is that right so it's got to know that foundation and and to know that foundation is not just a feeling not just a thought but it's a reality within our life to where that's through that reality we can look back we know we no longer lock the things we used to love but we also see the fruit of God that is moving through our life there's a foundation he tried to hook at one time upon the Jewish nation he found out that he couldn't do it he knew what he was going to do all the time because he promised to see and the seed was in Jacob then but he couldn't hook it on Jacob discipline er couldn't do it because Jacob was a sir planner but that seed that faith seed was resting there neither could hook it on Abraham little fellow setting out there backslide little shyster lying treating his wife the way he was he couldn't hook it on that he couldn't hook it on many of these other things he couldn't hook it on the temple jesus said there be a time when there won't be one stone left on another he tried it on the patriarch David and he took Bathsheba for a wife Uriah had him killed everything that he tried to hook it to it wouldn't anchor every one of those were giving glimpses in part but yet he couldn't hook the ladder in one of them what does it show it shows the weakness and the fallow ability of man it shows that this cannot be a ladder that simply hooked into flesh amen it cannot be just flesh because flesh failed but it's got to be one who's greater than that afresh and that can only be one and that's God oh my look at the grace of God in Isaiah 28:16 therefore thus saith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure stone he that believeth shall not make haste this stone has got look at it look at him says I lay who laid this stone the Lord Himself laid this stone it wasn't a stone that was provided by man it wasn't a stone that was provided by the prophets but it was the stone himself that moved upon the prophets that would even speak and give even designation to that which and who he is here is I lay in Zion highly a precious stone a fried stone think of it has he walked upon this earth he was tried he was tested he was ridiculed he was exiled by the religion of the day they're right they didn't even they were not they didn't recognize him but yet now the trying of that stone is that we're an anchor that we see it in tight we see the block you see it in David where David is facing the life you see a part of that you see a characteristic that is a part of that stone but yet David it couldn't be hooked in David you see a part of it they're in Abraham and see it on down but yet it could not be hooked in them highly in Zion so look how God would place this here even in 1st Peter chapter 2 verse 4 because notice this this stone that I lay in Zion we know it's speaking not just of Israel but as a speaking Zion is speaking spiritually of the bride notice here how that he is a tried stone a precious stone a sure foundation and first Peter chapter 2 verse 4 says to homecoming as unto a lively stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious who is he is the foundation stone but notice what he's doing he's letting to be known that he's the foundation stone of which all other stones that are a plant of him are brought together and just as all of these qualities speak of him that is a tried stone a precious stone it's a sure stone that same reality speaks in the life of a believer chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect and precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded confounded means shall not be ashamed let me just let me put it real clear you might be out argued you might be out debated that might be printing there might be individuals you can talk to but they could pluck questions at you and everything else and you don't have the answer right there but you're not confounded if your experience is here then you could be but when the experience is down there you cannot be confounded because this can be shaken but this right here cannot be shaken this is a real true stone even Joseph who was very close in the perfection but yet we seen in the midst of a pressure situation he was shaken hallelujah but yet notice how that in the midst of it unto you therefore which believe he is precious and unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has made the head of the corner let me go on here the infallibility of God spoken word brother an refers to the scriptures I just read about that stone being laid in Zion and then he moves on it says and then God being God in heaven with the ladder hooked into his own throne he hooked it also in none other but the son of man Jesus Christ the Cornerstone God don't want his ladder slipping around why you I just don't he wanted slipping around it ain't about him it's about you it's about me it's gotta be made sure the word of the Lord is tried and it is sure his reputations on the line God don't want his ladder slipping around he tried to hook it through a covenant with Adam he broke it he hooked it to a covenant with any broken but God made the Covenant unconditionally and he hooked into Christ Jesus bear it's anchored there's no slipping and sliding there's no way of getting away what is it it's hooked by God above and by the Son of God beneath and what is it it's a pathway it's a traveller's way from earth to glory hey man this is the way God said I will provide I am that way for he provided that of even the flaming sword of a chairman to keep the way back to the Tree of Life notice how he's revealing note it as he revealed himself all the way down even in this place to Jacob it's grace revelation is not merited revelation is what we pray for that's why the importance of it can never be over emphasized the Prophet as he as he as he speaks there in that particular place and I brought this - to the brethren in that meeting when he says may God by his Spirit continue to give us life-giving revelation and that word continuous means cycles that keep on unfolding with no reversals there is no reversal to divine revelation in the life of a believer for in God himself his desire is to reveal and when he reveals it's for that word to now have preeminence and when the word has preeminence there is now a part of that Kingdom being restored that three-fold purpose works over and over and over and over till it comes to the final culmination notice here is Jacob let's look down a little bit further in Genesis 28 16 Jacob awakens out of his sleep and he says surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not hallelujah so he's aware he's aware by this dream you know this isn't something that that the scriptures would lay before us that Jacob in a manner is questioning but what has been shown and declared the Jacob he recognizes that the Lord is in this place he could have went to many other places but you know what God was going to meet him in this place there was a significance behind this place and God was going to meet him there God arranged everything like we looked at it God arranged the path wings for everything to be there just at the right time God knew Jacob was gonna be out of strength he knew Jacob was gonna need a place to rest God knew what you would need in this age got knew what you would need in this hour God knows that we would take it would take more than any other age it was going to take not just a portion but would have to be the full unfolding and dispensing of Christ Himself coming back in the church hallelujah if not there would be no rapture God knows and he is making ready he provides all those things and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place he was afraid the presence of God you know brother Branham he says it is a sign of the insertion with what's approaching he said I'm very weary right now for what is approaching I to see the magnitude of it Bill Graham talked about when that the Friends of God comes and I I tell you you know you know how it is when the prints of God there's times how the prints of God comes you don't feel like doing nothing it just it just it's a solemn fear you just you don't even want to move oh yes like many times have it asked for the brennaman and we and I know how not only myself but others speaking here don't you feel like shopping says none other but the house of God and this is the gate notice this realization of Jacob he goes he goes right on back to sleep comes to a place now he goes right on back to sleep and Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it now he doesn't receive there's no Direction nothing that we can see right now to where that there's been direction but it's something that would resume within Jacob so I already God is showing in tight that this place and it would be all the spiritual significance that there will indeed be one who indeed is the gate of heaven there will indeed one that is coming that will indeed be the very happen at the house of God the tabernacle of God's own life indeed but notice how Jacob he takes that stone he sets it up for a pillar he declares this stone that I'm resting on he's going to become established our foundation and he pours oil upon it what was it Jacob acting out in tight what God himself God provided it was not Mary that provided that body it was not anyone that provided it but God provided it this stone that Jacob picks up he didn't provide it it was there the Lamb that Abel offered he didn't provide it it was there and Jacob recognizes this tone he sets it for a pillar and he a nice it same thing that takes place at the River Jordan here comes one here comes this chief Cornerstone here he is moving in slips right down into the water everything continues on no doubt that has many were rejoicing things keep going on but for John things change that day for the life of the Lord Jesus things change that day because now it comes time for this word that is laid there from now since his birth now for this word it's been ignited or quickened and it's now time for this word to be expressed under the knighting what a knighting Redeemer anointing is that right he poured that oil on the top of it that the heavens were open and the Holy Spirit descending down in the form of a death God coming upon his stone one that was provided among many other of humanity but God provided this stone amen jesus said in John 1:51 hereafter you shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man in John 14:6 he said I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me in the mighty Conqueror the prophets said it like this he said all that old prophet when he laid down there on the bed of stone that night and his pillar of stone he saw the angels ascending and descending the first place it was descending and ascending but this time it was God in man ascending and descending on the ladder of Jacob so now what was a ladder shown in type to Jacob that access now had become flesh you see that word that grants access must become flesh the word Christ must it must become flesh and what does it do opens up a way to you and I otherwise we're looking at the letter we're looking at the way there's no way there must be one who Leah's failed in that word to step forward and take the seals off of himself and come down to you and I it must be him that steps out of the way fales himself and that brings you and I into the veil of the word hallelujah her mother rest of the world can say you're crazy you've lost your mind but you veiled behind the word hey man because the word itself that was letter has become spirit and life and truth and it's dwelling behind your flesh why because grace provided one to step out when he broke every power fought every domain sets at the right hand of the Majesty on high far above everything Satan has fought this all down through the ages he still fights this ladder the channel notice the probably calls it the channel of the Holy Ghost in this dark world is laying open for whosoever will may come and be baptized into this great channel of his blessings and receive redemptive blessings that he died for Genesis 28 19 here Jacob he calls the name called the name of that place Bethell and the name of that city was called loose at the first but say no that's not the first time it's called Bethel mill it is the first time he names it in the scripture we read it in Genesis where it speaks of Abraham camping close on this side of Bethel but notice where did Jacob get this to call loose Bethel where did this come from God's mind he's walking in tune with God and God gives to him the name of what to call this place yet it was a place that God in the time of Abraham God recognized it as beth-el but now Jacob himself moved by inspiration said this is Beth el OMA and Jacob vowed a vow saying of God be with me will keep me in this way that go and will give me bread they eat and raiment to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my god this is what I want to get to in verse 22 and this stone notice he comes back to this stone he anoints this stone but now in between the time of his vow he comes back to this stone why because it's gonna have to be this stone all of these things that Jacob is vowing he ain't gonna be able of his own strength to keep it but you know what God's already told him I will not leave the until I have performed to these those things that I have said amen and this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house and of all that shall give me surely I will give the tenth unto thee now you know I got to readin on this some weeks ago and brother Branham you know he picks it up and brother Branham talks about how that in the message enticing spirits and he says I like this he said Jacob pulled up a stone one time and laid his head on it and it still recognized today as the the throne of stone or the stone the the stone of stone but the great men of the earth still packed that stone around for the kings to be inaugurated over the top of this stone just a common old stone laying in the field I read a lot about those things looking on a lot of different history and a lot of things this is the point that there would be people who would take of of of the stone and it would say that this stone you know if if it is it is if it isn't it isn't but there's still a great point to be made to wear that the Prophet would pick it up that people would still regard this stone when there is a king coming in to be inaugurated and it's down through history where they'll take this stone they proclaim the stone to be the stone that Jacob slept on is the stone that Jacob anointed with and and and you know establish it as a pillar they would take that stone and they would inaugurate King's on that stone this is the point behind it though they even how the Prophet make it it was a common old stone laying out there the Bible said there wasn't any beauty that we should desire him it's been moved right in among the rest of the stone but there was something different about this one from all other stones a many would be through this stone that there would be many sons and daughters inaugurated into the kingdom of Almighty God it would be on this stone that many sons and daughters of God would be born again and will be placed into the Kingdom of Almighty God it would be of this stone that that kingly rain and that priestly origin Highland moves forth over this stone it's also called the Stone of Destiny this stone reveals your destiny because it reveals who you are where you come from I have no God of that father Abraham Google revita God just a common stone in the eyes of many no reputation he took no reputation he took the form of a servant that right this is where that he could declare when he asked them who do other stones say that either stone in some say you Jeremiah some say you're this I'm saying that who do you say I am Dodd's of Christ that precious stone payment that was the Christ the Son of the Living God and even What did he say thou art Peter the stone spoke back thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it it's a sure foundation they remember stone him end that life wrapped in that created blood cell but when there was a blood that loose man from the hold that the devil did he claimed he could put on and in the spirit God's a life that was wrapped in that cell that could seek out his children and could relieve them from the oppression and the bondage they were in by what moving away by the atmosphere all the things of the contaminants of their life and doing the work within them that creates a real true pillar in their anointed with the same oil is that right can I have just a few more moments he says what is it it's a pathway it's a traveler's way from earth to glory and you can't fail there's great companies of angels up and down here ascending and descending picking up the weary and the sick healing their bodies and showing visions and mighty signs and wonders can't fail it can't slip it can't slide you're safe God said so that settles it forever notice it can't slide it can't fail and what is it you're safe why because we are in that ladder God's great channel by lot by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth we are brought into that channel and angels are ascending and descending on the ladder angels are ascending and descending here on the Son of Man ascending and descending upon the word why to minister to you and I the minister stress to you and I listen friends the battles were fighting or not flesh and blood amen these are these are battles that have men that were fought before there was ever a human immortal upon the earth here it was between that of the angels there were angels who stood and there angels who fell remembers every language the first estate and there are those who held they men and the angels of God are here gathered around that same word the same word that Satan Lucifer rhetoric letter rebellion against they are gathered around that word and remained around that word and God himself has brought that life that word down to you and I and the angels of God the great hosts of God our impact among those who fear Him think of this the Lord Jesus himself the lamb of God dealeth the tabernacled in flesh and here he is he goes through the battles he goes through the tests and as after he comes out of the temptations angels came and ministered unto him all right Nigel their lives who got down and he got back there in the cave but the Brennan referred to that as the mind of Christ was there in Elijah but now in that mind of Christ pulled back Elijah didn't know what to do he ran brother Brown likens that down to the seventh seal and how that in our life there's things sometimes that we know what to do other times we don't know what to do but there is a place that we can run to we're tempted sometimes to go running our own little cave and there's times we have written running our own little cave we've had our own little pity parties about things come on friends but God still has angels to prepare some for you hey man the angels of God we're preparing meat and cakes on the fire for Elijah rise and eat Dean strength Elijah who loves it the angels of God are coming the word oh my it's hooked around the heart of God of heaven hooked around the Son of God down here and were brought into it through the Son of God we ascend to him oh my what you scared about I promised his hook between God and Christ we're in between them no he will give his angels charge over thee you believe that there's angels that are given charge over you I don't know about that brother Sam no well there's many places in the world but you notice that the devil himself when Satan was walking around he told God concerning Jobi says I can't touch him because you got a hedge all around him there are angels that were in charge that man those angels aren't in charge of keeping your soul the Angels didn't save your soul but the angels are sent and they're there to minister to us along the way your mind no wonder brother Graham would open the service many times God may the Angels take their post may they come and walk up and down the aisles Lord may they give strength the Lord to us as your children as we're gathered at Bethel tonight amen that's my desire I don't want to come to church and it not be Bethel hey man I want to come to church and it's Bethel the Living God is present you mean things may not happen just exactly like it did a previous service that's not what determines that but we want the presence of God where God is coming down through him by his word and we know that we have met face-to-face with the Living God one who deserves our life one who knows all about the circumstance and one who is the answer to it and all up and down the angels of God unkempt about those who fear me and all up and down when we're making this foundation climbing each day higher and higher each day brings me one round higher higher as I move up up anybody want to move up huh there's things sometimes that you feel like are afar off but you got a ladder and that ladder is the channel of the Holy Ghost hey man we're not looking at the word as though it's us performing it but lord I need more of you who is the word to come and fulfill it in me amen anything happens if I fall along the road or something happens to me there's a great host of angels standing there to pick me up sometimes when you thought like you were about ready to give up you were ready to quit you were ready to give in but you can't understand what it is that turned around to tell you first of all there's got to be a time post there but there are angels of God that come and minister to you because God just don't want to type o sitting in your soul and you're weary in your spirit your gloomy in your spirit your your-your-your gloomed in your mind but he wants to encourage you go to be a god if I follow he picks me back up think of that even how the prior to Calvary he when the Lord Jesus come out of praying about going to Calvary the angels were there and ministered unto him ministers Ian do you realize friends that these things right here is that all along the way I don't I I don't doubt this at all I know this I know this by an experience that it has been so many times that God has come on the scene when maybe that I've been down where I've been discouraged and God the angels of God have made a sweet by yes sir think of this now of how that even Paul look what Paul would say here Paul is in the midst look at him he's in the of distress and many times you find we're poles in the midst of distress they would send out Titus they would send out Timothy and after everything was going on Paul would say all the situations that are taking place but yet when they returned bringing word of how you stand in the faith that encouraged us it didn't take away the situation I hope somebody still hearing me tonight that doesn't take away the situation we're in it encourages us with strength to press on the angels coming in ministering to the Lord Jesus did not relieve the cross it gave him strength to go on amen that's why brother Adam would even say and something that which sometimes we could take so for granted but he would talk about in the message perfect faith opening in that message and he said you know there's times I get gloomy I can relate to a man like that these other times I get gloomy and Satan gets to telling me nobody loves you nobody cares about you that right now we could take that quote and stop right there and we could create a little commune or in a fellowship session of pity party but I don't believe that's why that's included in the message there is direction that's given there because the Prophet said then I come out and I look and see people who stayed around - for the second service on a Sunday night instead of driving back to Georgia he said then I'll put that right back in the devil's face and say what about that I'm putting many of cards back in his face I put many attacks back in his face I put many a email back in his face the proud the point is put it back in his face and say this is true you're lying I know you were lying what is it that which is sent to Minister strength to us along the way person said brother Samuel I don't need that you need first of all you need help over that self-righteous lion spirit all I need is Jesus I do too and I need him to show up in flesh too I need him to make himself known in his body God has made it that way that we have that we so work together as a body of believers that's why when he said when one hurts we all heard when one rejoices we all rejoice Oh can't fail there's no failing in it it don't rest upon what I do it rests upon what he did it's already finished the believer once anchored in Christ coming through the door back there put on this highway you can't get any way but straight up to God with it angels to take care of you let me just say it plain you didn't put yourself on the ladder you didn't provide the ladder and there ain't a devil out of hell can take you off the ladder because you know what that there is no desire to come off this ladder Amen you have been baptized into the body of Jesus Christ what a security it's not getting up on a ladder oh honey honey honey honey check the ladder you get the going like that and very soon it's gonna be sliding off when I'm on the ladder I don't want nobody shaking it I don't want nobody messing around with the ladder hey brother Samuel hahahahaha I don't want that happening we have fun with my feet are on the ground with yours but this ladder here is a true precious tried stone detach the trows everything will come away to try to shake us but in moving the ladder the ladder can't be shaken because that stone is firm it's fixed the ladder is firm his fits and we are on the ladder and if we start shaking a little bit there's angels ascending and descending it like the first time you know second time I flew to Ghana and I rode first-class every time I go overseas God please open a first-class I got in there in first class and man I'm telling the truth like I had my own little suite yeah they gave me a menu and I got to looking at the menu and I thought I was supposed to pick off a menu like you do at Cracker Barrell one or more no you select from every category in there sir and by the way what can we get you to drink right now what can we get for you taking my shoes from me hanging my shoe hanging my coat up you know putting my shoes in the closet here can we can we can recline your seat for you can we do there all these things you know because of the class that you're in today man and you know what there's a class that you and I are in there's a class that's already been provided it was not something that we could pay for we did not have the money to get into this class but he himself who is the firstborn class he brought us into this class and we have the angels of God that are there to minister unto you and I let Stan we can't slip we can't slide you might get weak hey man you might get weak you might as the Prophet said in a 35 their brother Brian he said our foundation stands sure foundation of God God laid enzyme the cornerstone there we are can't slip can't slide can't move then we come into the door through Christ put on here oh we may have our ups and downs along that's true sickness and trouble but remember there's a great company of angels all along the road bear thee up at any time taking you up or on up when you fall he promised it you made away God has provided by His grace the way for you and I to be able to live a victorious life an overcoming life strength that he's provided to you and I'm sometimes along the way as we look at it sure we get week we're tried and we're tested but you realize it's a statement that I heard and I thought that's a profound statement if there is something that has no resistance against it it's not faith but real faith always has opposition always that's what makes it faith if it has no opposition it's not faith but faith always has an opposition why because it allows the faith itself to declare itself God permits the test God permits the trials God's not worried about the slipping and the falling he's not worried God's see this is secure it's secure in him we are secure in him that's where we rest we rest in him God is overseeing all of this when we have been brought in to the body by the new birth that seed has been quickened you can no more die and God can die [Music] but that's why it's important to be in that body that's why it's important Jacob could look at this time right here and Jacob could say what God spoke to but if you'll notice within this Jacob is still gonna go do what Jacob wants to do but he knows that God is real knows God's watching over his life but you see the difference is that where you and I can come into that place and the Spirit of God will bring us into that place to where it's not just us meeting God in terms of just I realize he's a lot but we recognize he's everything lord I must have you I must have you and God sweeps in and brings that transformation in your life it's a reversal that which can never be reversed what you're loving I'll tell you with all with this and - and Lord may we just give ourselves more fully - I don't want to try to find my way I don't have to find my way I want to just yield to the way that you're opening our lives are pre-planned God has everything down does that mean he's gonna do everything for us quite the contrary he won't do it for us but he will guide us he will lead us as we yield to him and as we yield then he'll bring us into those places under his leadership in his direction that he might move upon our lives according to his faith what Jacob saw what's his avenue of escape or Jesus [Music] or how could we stand here tonight Lord in need of you Lord Lord in many different paths and walks of life many needs many situations or but father we have the utmost confidence Lord that you are over all these things I pray tonight God that Lord Jesus if there's one that's here that does
