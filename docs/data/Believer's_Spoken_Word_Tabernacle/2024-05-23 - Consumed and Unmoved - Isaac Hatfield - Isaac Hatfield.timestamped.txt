[40:47] promised saying yet once more I shake
[40:49] not the Earth only but also heaven and
[40:52] this word yet once more signify the
[40:54] removing of those things that are shaken
[40:56] as of things that are made that those
[40:58] things which cannot be shaken May remain
[41:01] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[41:03] cannot be moved let us have Grace
[41:05] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[41:07] reverence and godly fear for our God is
[41:10] a consuming fire Amen in Matthew 17 just
[41:15] the first eight verses here talking
[41:17] about the mount Transfiguration experim
[41:20] experience it says after 6 days Jesus
[41:23] taketh Peter James and John his brother
[41:26] and bringeth them up into and high
[41:27] mountain apart and was transfigured
[41:30] before them and his face did shine as
[41:32] the sun and his rment was white as the
[41:34] light and behold there appeared unto
[41:36] them Moses and Elias talking with him
[41:39] then answered Peter and said unto Jesus
[41:41] Lord it is good for us to be here if
[41:43] thou Wilt let us make here three
[41:45] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[41:48] and one for Elias and while he yet spake
[41:51] Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them
[41:53] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[41:54] which said this is my beloved Son in
[41:57] whom I am well pleased hear ye him and
[42:00] when the disciples heard it they fell on
[42:02] their face and were sore afraid and
[42:03] Jesus came and touched them and said
[42:05] arise and be not afraid and when they
[42:07] had lifted up their eyes they saw no man
[42:09] save Jesus only amen if we could bow our
[42:12] heads for word of prayer if you have a
[42:15] need tonight just lift it before the
[42:17] Lord and he sees he sees your heart
[42:20] Heavenly Father Lord we call upon your
[42:22] name tonight father for we realize Lord
[42:25] that we have no ability of Our Own Lord
[42:27] and Lord every human ability father
[42:30] would would get us nowhere but Lord we
[42:32] yield ourselves to you tonight asking
[42:35] Lord that you just take a hold of this
[42:36] service and use it for your glory in
[42:39] some way Lord just to speak to the
[42:41] hearts of your children father Lord that
[42:43] we may each leave here a little closer
[42:45] to you than when we came father I pray
[42:47] that you just Minister Lord bless this
[42:50] assembly father and those that maybe
[42:52] even couldn't be here tonight I pray you
[42:54] be with them where they're at father and
[42:55] encourage them along the way Lord as we
[42:58] commit this service into your hands in
[43:00] Jesus name amen you may have your seats
[43:03] as we just want to take a little thought
[43:05] out of that on consumed and unmoved uh
[43:09] consumed and on moved just some things
[43:10] that have been on my heart just been
[43:13] studying some on hear ye him and on the
[43:15] voice of the Lord and brother Brandon
[43:18] preached this service many times and he
[43:20] shows that it was a type of the coming
[43:22] of the Lord and here on Mount
[43:24] Transfiguration was a type of the coming
[43:26] of the Lord and he said it showed the
[43:28] order of the coming there was Moses
[43:30] which represented the dead Saints and
[43:32] Elijah represented the living Saints and
[43:35] then there stood Jesus glorified as a
[43:37] type of the coming of the Lord and he
[43:39] even would show that in the chapter just
[43:41] before that that it was written that
[43:44] there he said I say unto you there be
[43:46] some standing here which shall not taste
[43:48] a death till they see the son of man
[43:50] coming in his kingdom and he he showed
[43:52] that it wasn't that um that they would
[43:55] uh live to see the the Fulfillment of
[43:58] the coming of the Lord and its entirety
[44:00] because he didn't even say that all of
[44:02] you standing here he said there be some
[44:04] standing here which we'll see see him
[44:06] coming in his kingdom and those some
[44:09] that were standing there were Peter
[44:10] James and John and he was about to take
[44:12] them up on the mount and show them the
[44:14] order of the coming of his kingdom and
[44:17] there they would see him standing there
[44:19] and so and so he would begin to show us
[44:22] that you know in the order of his coming
[44:24] that there will be a Moses and Elijah
[44:26] and of course we know that that the the
[44:28] two prophets will go to Israel but also
[44:31] we've received an Elijah in our hour
[44:33] before the coming of the Lord he said
[44:35] behold I will send unto you Elijah and
[44:37] we've seen Moses and the type of Israel
[44:40] returning to her Homeland and and and
[44:42] we've seen those things happen in our
[44:44] hour but here he said he's showing them
[44:45] an order of the coming of the Lord but
[44:48] but then he would say it's also how the
[44:50] Bible all ties together he said he said
[44:52] and I know that the correct order of
[44:54] this scripture is the coming of the Lord
[44:56] but he began to take it also as a type
[44:58] of adoption how God took his son up onto
[45:01] the mountain and Peter called it a Holy
[45:04] Mountain but brother Brandon say it
[45:06] wasn't so much that it was a Holy
[45:07] Mountain but there was a holy God up on
[45:10] the mountain and as they gathered there
[45:13] God was adopting his son for for for he
[45:16] wasn't making him his son he was already
[45:18] the Son of God but he was adopting his
[45:20] son for he hadn't just been gatting
[45:22] about he hadn't just been going about
[45:25] just living any kind of life he had been
[45:27] about the father's business he he had
[45:29] been obedient only doing what the Lord
[45:31] commanded him to do and so God was about
[45:33] to adopt him on Mount Transfiguration
[45:36] and he brought three Earthly Witnesses
[45:38] up on the mountain Peter James and John
[45:41] which represent faith hope and charity
[45:44] and he brought three Heavenly Witnesses
[45:46] Moses Elijah and Jesus which represent
[45:49] law Justice and mercy and Peter got
[45:51] excited at the supernatural you see
[45:54] there Jesus was transfigured before him
[45:56] his face Shone like the sun a cloud
[45:59] overshadowed them and Moses and Elijah
[46:01] appeared and Peter got all excited at
[46:03] the Supernatural and said well let's
[46:05] build three Tabernacles one for Moses
[46:07] one for Elijah and one for Jesus but the
[46:11] problem was that Moses only represented
[46:13] the law and the law was only a policeman
[46:15] that could put you in jail the the law
[46:17] could only condemn you the law could
[46:19] only lock you up and put you in jail and
[46:22] so Moses uh P Peter wanted to build a
[46:24] tabernacle for the law but the law had
[46:27] no Redeeming Grace and and and the law
[46:30] had had a period of time where the voice
[46:32] of the Lord spoke out on Mount Si and he
[46:35] gave them the Ten Commandments and said
[46:37] take heed onto it said the law had a
[46:40] place there was a time when the voice of
[46:41] the Lord that rang out was ringing out
[46:44] the voice of The Commandments but but
[46:46] but the law was only a shadow of good
[46:49] things to come and and and but here was
[46:51] one coming on the scene who wasn't after
[46:54] just the law but he was after the order
[46:56] of MDC here here the one standing up on
[46:59] that mountain was one that was a priest
[47:02] not made after the law but after the
[47:04] power of an endless life and and when he
[47:06] came on the earth he would speak you
[47:08] know that it said that you shall not
[47:10] kill but I say that whosoever whosoever
[47:13] is angry with his brother without a
[47:14] cause is already killed and you shall
[47:17] not you shall not commit adultery but I
[47:19] say unto you whosoever lookth upon a
[47:21] woman you see here was coming one on the
[47:23] scene and he wasn't changing the law for
[47:25] for God's word cannot change but he come
[47:27] and he magnified the law and it was
[47:30] Jesus it was the Fulfillment of it
[47:33] coming on the scene and and so Peter
[47:35] said well let's build a tabernacle for
[47:36] Elijah but you see Elijah only
[47:38] represented God's justice you know there
[47:41] was a time where Elijah went up onto the
[47:43] mountain and the king of Samaria wanted
[47:46] him to come down off the mountain so he
[47:48] sent an army of 50 and said go on up and
[47:50] get Elijah off that mountain and so they
[47:52] went up and Elijah said if I be a man of
[47:54] God let fire fall from Heaven and
[47:57] consumed this Army and fire fell and
[47:59] consumed them and so the king said well
[48:01] it must have just been an electric storm
[48:03] and so he sent another Army and fire
[48:06] fell and consumed them and brother B
[48:08] said until he got tired of sending 50s
[48:10] and and that was God's justice that was
[48:13] what God's justice would do would would
[48:15] consume and Destroy and brother brand
[48:17] would say I don't want God's justice I
[48:19] want God's mercy I want God's love and
[48:23] God's grace and so but he said thank the
[48:25] Lord Before Peter could ever even get
[48:27] through saying that brother brandom said
[48:29] that God nipped it in the bud before he
[48:32] could ever even finish what he was
[48:33] saying there come a voice that rung out
[48:35] from heaven and said this is my beloved
[48:37] Son and whom I am well pleased hear ye
[48:40] him and when they looked back the law
[48:42] had passed away Justice had passed away
[48:45] and they looked and they saw Jesus only
[48:48] there he was standing on that mountain
[48:49] and everything had passed away and all
[48:52] they could see was Jesus and that's
[48:54] where you got to come in your life and
[48:56] that's the problem I think many times
[48:58] even around the message is that people
[49:00] only go far enough to see the law they
[49:02] only go far enough to see the Justice
[49:05] all they see is a set of rules that I
[49:07] got to dress a certain way I got to live
[49:09] a certain way if I don't read my Bible
[49:11] enough I'm going to go to hell and they
[49:13] live in a state of bondage and legalism
[49:15] because they never got far enough to see
[49:18] Jesus only they never got far enough to
[49:20] see Christ in this message but if you
[49:22] ever get far enough to see Christ to see
[49:25] a living reality and realize that this
[49:27] is God's love to you this is God's mercy
[49:31] that he's reached down in this
[49:32] generation to pluck you up out of your
[49:34] miserable condition it'll bring a
[49:37] liberty in your life you're not just
[49:39] consumed with a bunch of of legalism and
[49:42] and until you get a holier than thou
[49:44] attitude that I'm better than you
[49:46] because I've done more with my own works
[49:48] or or or or or just God's justice but
[49:51] you've looked and you've heard the voice
[49:52] of the Lord in this message amen you've
[49:55] heard more than the voice of William
[49:57] brandom but you've heard the voice of
[49:59] Jesus and you've looked and you saw one
[50:02] that's able to bring you into
[50:04] relationship where you're no longer just
[50:06] serving the lord because you have to not
[50:08] to go to hell but you serve him because
[50:10] you love him amen and you realize that
[50:13] you're saved by his grace you're saved
[50:15] by his blood you're saved by his
[50:17] sacrifice on Calvary oh and that
[50:20] sacrifice is the power that it takes to
[50:23] save you brother Brandon would begin to
[50:25] show us that salvation is not Jesus plus
[50:29] salvation is Jesus alone you don't look
[50:32] and see Jesus and the law you look and
[50:35] you see Jesus only and that is the basis
[50:38] that you are saved by it's not his blood
[50:41] plus your conduct brother Ben it's not
[50:43] your blood plus what you can muster up
[50:45] and do you're going to make mistakes
[50:47] you're going to be full of failures and
[50:50] you're going to get back up but but but
[50:52] but that your salvation is not based
[50:54] upon your Works your salvation is B
[50:56] based upon the blood and the power of
[50:59] the blood and the blood only oh and
[51:02] that'll bring a settl to your life if
[51:04] you can ever realize that that even in
[51:06] the midst of your mistakes and your
[51:08] failures that that does not change how
[51:11] God sees you oh brother Brandon would
[51:14] tell us that I believe if you if you are
[51:16] saved you will do good you you you
[51:18] you're not just going to you're not just
[51:19] going to disobey the Lord if you sin
[51:22] willfully then then there's something
[51:23] wrong but but but but it but that
[51:26] doesn't change how how you're viewed in
[51:29] the eyes of
[51:30] God oh you got to see Jesus only hear ye
[51:34] him and brother Brandon preached this
[51:36] message 20 times on tape that I counted
[51:39] and so he must have been trying to get
[51:41] something to us he said it's a small
[51:44] text but he said obedience to that will
[51:46] bring will bring a repeat of Pentecost
[51:49] he said why would you hear him because
[51:51] he's the only one that can save he's the
[51:53] only one that can heal he said I'm I'm
[51:56] the Lord and I heal all your diseases he
[51:59] he said he said he was uh wounded for
[52:01] our transgressions he was bruised for
[52:03] our iniquities and the chastisement of
[52:05] our peace was upon him and by his
[52:07] stripes we are healed and he's the only
[52:09] one that can heal you that's why we want
[52:11] to hear him because because it's his
[52:14] voice that makes the difference he's the
[52:16] only one who has eternal life brother
[52:18] brenon said he's the only one who can
[52:20] beat you and stand between man and God
[52:22] and Bridge the way and make a way for
[52:25] you he said no law can can do it no
[52:27] judgment can do it no Works can do it
[52:29] it's nothing but the love of Jesus and
[52:32] so there's power in hearing him if you
[52:35] could ever hear him correctly it could
[52:37] be a word of Salvation that would pass
[52:40] you from death onto life it could take a
[52:43] man seeking the Holy Ghost and give him
[52:45] the Holy Ghost it could take a cancer
[52:48] ridden patient and make him so cancer
[52:51] free it could it could take blind eyes
[52:53] and open them it could take deaf ears
[52:55] and open it's the power of the word of
[52:58] God not just a dead letter but the word
[53:01] of God as it comes forth in power and
[53:04] demonstration and falls in the good
[53:06] ground of your heart it'll bring to pass
[53:08] exactly what it said it would do because
[53:11] it's it's God's word it's the it's a
[53:14] word of authority this voice that we
[53:16] have received is a voice of authority
[53:19] and and brother Brenham said after all
[53:21] he's the voice of authority and God
[53:23] himself witnessed so at this time when
[53:26] he said said hear ye him he said there's
[53:28] many doctrines there's many isms he he
[53:31] said but hear ye him because he's the
[53:33] voice of final Authority he's the one
[53:35] that'll speak he's the one that said the
[53:38] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[53:40] word will never pass away says so he you
[53:42] him he's the one to listen to you see
[53:45] there there's a lot of voices in this
[53:47] world there there's the voice of
[53:49] politics there's the voice of Hollywood
[53:51] there's the voice of the church that's
[53:53] just trying to get more members and
[53:55] brother Brandon would say there's the
[53:56] voice of the false prophet there there's
[53:58] all kinds of voices that have come into
[54:01] this age to try to distract you but when
[54:04] you realize that that voice is contrary
[54:06] to the word then you can recognize that
[54:08] it's the enemy trying to distract you
[54:10] that when the true voice comes that you
[54:12] wouldn't be able to recognize it or that
[54:14] you wouldn't listen to it but there is a
[54:17] voice of authority and when that voice
[54:19] ever once speaks it's the authority on
[54:22] the subject it's the yay and amen it's
[54:24] the finished work
[54:26] because it's the voice of God and when
[54:29] God speaks that settles it because his
[54:32] word is the power of authority and the
[54:35] Roman the Roman Centurion recognized
[54:37] that he recognized that he could say
[54:40] that I'm not even worthy that you come
[54:43] into my house he said but just speak the
[54:45] word only and my servant will be healed
[54:48] you know gyrus had said that if you
[54:50] could lay your hands upon my daughter
[54:53] but this man this man as a Gent
[54:57] and Jesus would commend him and say I
[54:59] haven't found so great a faith not even
[55:01] in Israel but he recognized what
[55:04] Authority meant and he as a man of
[55:06] authority could command his soldiers to
[55:09] go and they would go and to stay and
[55:12] they would stay and as a man of
[55:13] authority he recognized what a voice of
[55:16] authority would do and when he seen
[55:18] Jesus com into the midst he recognized
[55:21] if he could just speak a word if he
[55:23] could just say one word then that would
[55:25] settle it forever that would change it
[55:28] all you don't even have to come to my
[55:30] house just speak a word let let one word
[55:33] come forth from those lips of almighty
[55:35] God and that'll change everything
[55:38] that'll be the answer that'll be the
[55:40] final say over the situation and then I
[55:43] won't have to listen to any other voice
[55:45] because I'll know the answer and you may
[55:47] not be able to stop every voice from
[55:49] coming into your head but you can choose
[55:52] which one to listen to and you don't
[55:54] have to listen to any voice of the devil
[55:56] you don't have to listen to any lying
[55:58] vanity come back to the voice of God
[56:01] come back to the word of God and let
[56:03] that be your absolute let that be your
[56:06] Shield let that be your anchor in the
[56:08] times of trouble when the enemy comes in
[56:10] like a flood oh you say I don't have to
[56:12] listen to any voice that would try to
[56:14] persuade me to give up or try to
[56:17] persuade me to let down the guard or try
[56:19] to persuade me to let down the bar and
[56:22] just live a halfway life or or or just
[56:25] to just to not be so uh hard on the
[56:28] devil and to let let things come into
[56:31] your life but if it's contrary to the
[56:33] word then then don't take heed to that
[56:37] voice but take heed to the voice that
[56:40] has spoken from heaven for it's the
[56:42] voice of authority anden when he speaks
[56:45] that settles it but but but we've been
[56:49] told take heed see that you refuse it
[56:51] not amen and that's what he told us in
[56:54] Hebrews refuse not him that that
[56:56] speaketh and brother BR said hear ye
[56:58] himym it's a challenge it's a command
[57:01] it's a pardon it's all that you have
[57:04] need of if you'll just accept it in that
[57:06] way but brother Brandon would teach us
[57:08] and he would tell us a story many times
[57:10] about that young man who had been guilty
[57:13] and he was going to be executed and
[57:15] Abraham Lincoln wrote him a pardon but
[57:18] he wrote it and it wasn't on any fancy
[57:21] letterhead it was just on a piece of
[57:23] paper and he wrote a pardon to that
[57:25] young man but that young man didn't
[57:28] receive it because it didn't come the
[57:30] way he thought it would come and it
[57:32] wasn't on a pretty letter and he so he
[57:34] thought it must not be real and so he
[57:36] refused it and he was executed and they
[57:39] had to come to the decision that a
[57:41] pardon is only a pardon when received as
[57:44] a pardon and so brother Brandon would
[57:46] teach us that if you spurn Mercy there's
[57:49] nothing left but judgment so see that
[57:51] she refused not the voice but take heed
[57:54] to the voice of authority
[57:56] uh there was a boy one time and he was
[57:59] he was sentenced to the I believe it was
[58:01] to be hung and his mother felt so bad
[58:04] for him that she went before the
[58:06] governor and she crawled on her hands
[58:08] and knees to the governor and pleaded
[58:10] for his life and so the governor said
[58:12] okay I'll go down and I'll talk to them
[58:15] so the governor went over to the jail
[58:17] house he went in the cell with that
[58:19] young boy and he said young man can I
[58:22] speak to you for a moment young man I've
[58:24] got something to tell you can I speak
[58:26] speak to you but that young man said no
[58:28] can't you see I'm nervous can't you see
[58:30] I'm about to die I'm nervous can't you
[58:33] see and so the young man wouldn't give
[58:35] no time to the governor and so when the
[58:37] governor left he asked the guard who was
[58:40] that man he said it was the governor you
[58:42] you're so silly that the governor was in
[58:45] your cell and as he hung on that hanging
[58:47] block he was thinking oh the governor
[58:50] was in my cell but I refused to hear his
[58:53] voice and so the voice of authority has
[58:55] the ability to Pardon you but see that
[58:58] you refuse not him that
[59:00] speaketh and hear ye the voice of the
[59:03] Lord anden and this this in the days of
[59:06] Jesus he was preaching about how I am
[59:08] the door and I am the Good Shepherd and
[59:11] there he was preaching I have power to
[59:13] lay down my life and I have power to
[59:16] pick it up again and when he spoke that
[59:19] that said in John that there was a
[59:20] division therefore again among the Jews
[59:22] for these thingss and many of them said
[59:25] he hath the devil and is mad why hear ye
[59:28] him and E said these are not the words
[59:30] of him that hath a devil can a devil
[59:33] Open the Eyes of the blind oh there was
[59:36] a voice of authority on the scene and he
[59:38] was speaking forth a message I have
[59:41] power to lay down my life I have power
[59:43] to lift it up again I am the door I am
[59:46] the shepherd to the Sheepfold no man
[59:48] comes to the father but by me and they
[59:51] said he's a he's a man he's beab he's a
[59:54] man full of devils and there was a
[59:56] division among them oh my and we've had
[59:58] a voice of authority in this age he's
[1:00:01] come a mighty Angel has descended
[1:00:03] clothed with the cloud and brother
[1:00:05] brandom identifi that as the Supreme
[1:00:07] judge the supreme authority no other
[1:00:10] voice no other one like this and he come
[1:00:13] forth and yet still the question remains
[1:00:16] why hear ye him the devil still goes
[1:00:19] about like a roaring lion saying oh he
[1:00:21] was just a man oh he was just a Kentucky
[1:00:24] hillbilly oh it was just his opinion why
[1:00:27] hear you him why you hear him is because
[1:00:30] he's the voice of authority oh but there
[1:00:32] is a people that have heard the voice
[1:00:35] and they've taken heed to it and it
[1:00:37] hasn't sounded back in condemnation but
[1:00:40] it sounded back in pardon that you are
[1:00:43] the sinless Spotless bride you never did
[1:00:46] it in the first place you are free you
[1:00:48] are not guilty but I've called you out
[1:00:51] of denominations I called you to be my
[1:00:53] people oh and you heard the voice of par
[1:00:56] oh there was a division among them oh
[1:00:59] but you got to know what side of the
[1:01:00] Divide you're on oh I am not on the side
[1:01:03] of the divide with the critics that say
[1:01:05] he's full of devils but I am on the side
[1:01:08] of those that were beyond the curtain of
[1:01:10] time saying we are resting on it we are
[1:01:13] resting that you taught what Paul taught
[1:01:15] we are resting that this is a voice of
[1:01:17] authority and it's good enough to take
[1:01:20] care of my children and it's good enough
[1:01:22] to take care of my family and it's good
[1:01:24] enough to take care of my oh it's good
[1:01:26] enough to put me in a Rapture and that
[1:01:29] sounded back pardon on your life you are
[1:01:32] free you are no longer guilty come out
[1:01:35] of the jail cell you're free to worship
[1:01:38] you're free to live a holy overcoming
[1:01:40] life you're free to believe this message
[1:01:43] oh we are not on the side of the divid
[1:01:45] is the critic we are on the side of the
[1:01:47] believer and the voice that comes back
[1:01:50] over your life will not be a voice of
[1:01:51] judgment it'll be a voice of pardon oh
[1:01:54] it's a beautiful saying when the voice
[1:01:57] of authority becomes a voice of pardon
[1:02:00] he's the judge he has the power to to
[1:02:03] condemn and send you to hell but you
[1:02:06] received his word and it sounded back
[1:02:08] pardon you're free ah you never did it
[1:02:12] in the first place oh you don't have to
[1:02:14] carry that condemnation any longer
[1:02:16] there's no condemnation to them which
[1:02:18] are in Christ Jesus oh who walked not
[1:02:21] after the flesh but after the spirit and
[1:02:23] it was a voice of pardon it's a voice of
[1:02:26] authority and there's power in accepting
[1:02:29] that voice it's that voice that that's
[1:02:32] persuading you it's that voice that's
[1:02:35] that that's keeping you why we're still
[1:02:38] here why we're still pressing there's a
[1:02:40] voice persuading us you see in the Bible
[1:02:44] when when in the First Kings there's a
[1:02:48] story of of Ahab and Jehoshaphat and
[1:02:52] Micaiah and Jehoshaphat had joined ranks
[1:02:55] with Ahab and brother Brandon would say
[1:02:57] that's where he made his mistake he
[1:02:58] should have never joined up with Ahab
[1:03:00] but they joined together and they said a
[1:03:03] Ahab said well will you go down with me
[1:03:05] to ramoth Gilead and and you
[1:03:07] intellectually that was a good idea
[1:03:09] maybe because it did belong to them when
[1:03:12] Joshua had divided the land ramoth
[1:03:14] Gilead did belong to Israel and so they
[1:03:17] were going to go up and possess it but
[1:03:19] the thing was was that Ahab was was not
[1:03:21] living the way he should have and and if
[1:03:25] he would have just went back to the word
[1:03:27] and lived the right kind of life then
[1:03:30] maybe things would have been different
[1:03:31] but but he wasn't he wasn't living right
[1:03:34] and and there was a prophecy over his
[1:03:36] life that that Elijah had already
[1:03:38] prophesied that the dogs would lick his
[1:03:41] blood and so here he is saying will you
[1:03:43] go up with me to ramoth Gilead and there
[1:03:46] is Jehoshaphat and he said well let's
[1:03:48] consult the Lord about this and let's
[1:03:50] see what the Lord has to say and so
[1:03:53] there came 400 prophets and and and
[1:03:55] there they were saying go up and take it
[1:03:58] go up and take the land you know God is
[1:04:00] with you and and there zedekiah even
[1:04:02] came with two horns and he said by these
[1:04:05] and even even gave thus sayith the Lord
[1:04:07] by these we'll push back the Army by
[1:04:10] these we'll take the land but there was
[1:04:12] a Micaiah in the land and the thing
[1:04:14] about Micaiah was he he had already
[1:04:16] heard the prophecy of Elijah and so Mah
[1:04:20] as a as a true prophet of God could only
[1:04:23] stay with the word and so when they
[1:04:26] consulted Micaiah he he he said he said
[1:04:29] uh I see Israel uh Fallen you know I see
[1:04:33] them scattered like sheep and so there
[1:04:36] was Micaiah and he said you know that
[1:04:39] Ahab would be like I I told you you know
[1:04:42] he's always prophesying evil against me
[1:04:44] I I told you I didn't like this man he
[1:04:47] he never has anything good to say but
[1:04:49] but how could he when Elijah had already
[1:04:51] prophesied evil over Ahab and so we find
[1:04:55] that you just can't bless what God has
[1:04:58] cursed and so Micaiah could never bless
[1:05:01] Ahab when God had already cursed
[1:05:04] Ahab and brother Brandon when he was
[1:05:06] here he told us that America had
[1:05:09] rejected the the the the message and
[1:05:11] that they they would never have Revival
[1:05:13] and they were going into
[1:05:15] destruction and the young man got up
[1:05:18] behind him and said you know well
[1:05:19] brother Brandon may have said it was
[1:05:21] over for the Pentecost and things like
[1:05:23] that he said but it's not over for me
[1:05:25] and brother would say he just didn't
[1:05:26] know which end of the horn he was
[1:05:27] blowing out of because how could you
[1:05:30] bless what God had
[1:05:32] cursed and it's just the same for the
[1:05:35] positive that how can you curse what God
[1:05:37] has blessed and and balam found that out
[1:05:40] one time when he tried to curse Israel
[1:05:43] uh because BAC wanted them to come and
[1:05:44] curse Israel and then trying to curse
[1:05:46] them all he could do was bless them and
[1:05:49] all that ever came forth was blessings
[1:05:51] because you just can't curse what God
[1:05:53] has blessed amen so you got to find what
[1:05:56] side of the prophecy you're on you got
[1:05:58] to find where you're at in scripture and
[1:06:01] realize that no matter how many voices
[1:06:03] ever try to curse you if the voice of
[1:06:05] authority has ever once blessed you then
[1:06:08] you're blessed brother then you're then
[1:06:10] you're blessed sister if the voice of
[1:06:12] this word has called you blessed then no
[1:06:14] matter how many voices there's not
[1:06:16] enough voices in this world that could
[1:06:19] ever curse you and me because God has
[1:06:21] called you blessed and that's the voice
[1:06:23] that we're worried about and so Mah came
[1:06:26] up and prophesied and Ahab went up and
[1:06:29] he ended up dying up there in battle
[1:06:31] because that was what had been
[1:06:32] prophesied over his life but Micaiah
[1:06:35] said I I seen a vision of a lying Spirit
[1:06:37] coming up before the Throne of God and
[1:06:40] God would say that who shall we get to
[1:06:42] go down and persuade Ahab to go up to
[1:06:44] ramoth Gilead that he might fulfill what
[1:06:47] was spoken and so a lying Spirit came up
[1:06:49] from hell and persuaded those 400
[1:06:52] prophets to prophesy a lie that he might
[1:06:55] go up oh are you hearing me and fulfill
[1:06:58] what what Elijah had prophesied you see
[1:07:01] Micaiah could only say what Elijah had
[1:07:04] said amen and Peter on the day of
[1:07:06] Pentecost when he got up he said this is
[1:07:09] that which was spoken of by the prophet
[1:07:10] Joel and he was quoting what the prophet
[1:07:13] had already said amen and so and so we
[1:07:16] stay with the prophet am mean we stay
[1:07:18] with the word and when he had done that
[1:07:21] the lying Spirit went up and persuaded
[1:07:23] Ahab to fulfill what was spoken over his
[1:07:25] life and so and so and so there's a
[1:07:29] spirit sent into this earth right anden
[1:07:31] but if a lying Spirit could persuade
[1:07:33] Ahab to fulfill prophecy then what about
[1:07:36] a bride amen that's been prophesied over
[1:07:39] that there would be a bride without spot
[1:07:41] or wrinkle that there would be a bride
[1:07:44] that wouldn't fall like e fell there
[1:07:46] would be a bride that was going to make
[1:07:48] it there would be a people that would go
[1:07:50] in a Rapture and me and you've not been
[1:07:52] persuaded by a lying Spirit but God sent
[1:07:55] a spirit of Truth into this age that's
[1:07:58] persuaded your life to come out from
[1:08:01] denominations come out from among every
[1:08:03] other voice and follow me amen and it's
[1:08:06] a voice that's persuading you amen when
[1:08:08] every other voice is telling you to quit
[1:08:11] amen every other voice is telling you
[1:08:13] just to give up and just just to stop
[1:08:15] where you're at amen but there's
[1:08:17] prophecy over your life it's becoming of
[1:08:20] you to stand it's becoming of you to
[1:08:22] fulfill all righteousness amen
[1:08:25] and you must fulfill what's been spoken
[1:08:28] over your life amen so God has sent a
[1:08:31] voice Amen to call you out and to lead
[1:08:34] you and to guide you and to persuade you
[1:08:37] keep pressing hold fast don't give up
[1:08:40] persevere now is not the time to lay
[1:08:43] down the sword now is not the time to
[1:08:45] give up amen do you hear the voice
[1:08:48] coming forth out of this message to keep
[1:08:50] pressing amen when brother Brandon went
[1:08:52] beyond the curtain of time there was a
[1:08:54] voice when we said do I have to go back
[1:08:56] and he said yeah but keep pressing keep
[1:08:58] pressing am mean there's a Heavenly
[1:09:00] voice that's persuaded you oh not to
[1:09:03] give up am mean it's what's persuaded
[1:09:06] you amen it's that voice that persuaded
[1:09:08] Rebecca am me it was the voice of elazer

[1:09:14] leave houses and lands to leave father
[1:09:17] and mother and we've you've had a voice
[1:09:20] come in this age it was the voice of
[1:09:22] elzer and it's persuaded you it's
[1:09:25] persuaded you to follow him oh and you
[1:09:28] say Lord to whom would I go I mean I I'm
[1:09:33] persuaded that you alone hold the words
[1:09:35] of eternal life where else could I go
[1:09:38] besides you Lord and it's tugging at you
[1:09:42] and it's persuading you amen you see
[1:09:45] Paul was a man persuaded he said I'm
[1:09:48] persuaded that he which has spoke it is
[1:09:51] able to perform it and the one that
[1:09:54] speaks is able to perform what he's
[1:09:56] spoken and mean you can sit there and
[1:09:58] worry about it all day long about how
[1:10:00] you're going to perform it and how
[1:10:02] you're going to manifest it but God's
[1:10:04] never called you to perform it God's
[1:10:06] just called you to believe it God's just
[1:10:08] called you to hold on to the promise
[1:10:10] because the voice that spoke it is the
[1:10:13] voice that will perform it oh he's a God
[1:10:15] that speaks and he's able to take care
[1:10:17] of his word and when it will not return
[1:10:20] void oh and he's the one that spoke this
[1:10:23] Rapture he'll be the one that will
[1:10:25] perform it amen and and he's not called
[1:10:28] you to man to manifest the word uh
[1:10:31] through your own ability but he's just
[1:10:33] called you to to to to not to to but
[1:10:36] just to manifest it as a vessel as a
[1:10:39] surrendered vessel and mean you don't
[1:10:41] have to manufacture it you don't have to
[1:10:43] you don't have to to work it up oh
[1:10:45] you're just like a sheep that bears wool
[1:10:48] and it just comes forth and manifest out
[1:10:51] of your life because that's who you are
[1:10:53] because you are a son and daughter of
[1:10:55] God you will manifest the word of God oh
[1:10:59] Paul would say I am persuaded that he's
[1:11:01] able to keep that which I've committed
[1:11:03] unto him against the day amen he's able
[1:11:06] to keep it that which I've committed
[1:11:08] unto him amen are you persuaded are you
[1:11:12] persuaded that that that that this voice
[1:11:15] is is a is a voice of authority amen
[1:11:18] then you have a then you can then you
[1:11:20] can commit something into his hands and
[1:11:22] let go and let God take care of
[1:11:25] Amen brother brandom told us that one of
[1:11:27] the the most powerful weapons in the
[1:11:29] hands of the church is a committal amen
[1:11:32] that you can commit something into the
[1:11:34] hands of God and he will perform it and
[1:11:37] me he will take care of it and and you
[1:11:39] sit and you lay awake at night worried
[1:11:42] about about your job and about your
[1:11:44] children and worried about your future
[1:11:47] and worried about this and that and you
[1:11:48] worry yourself to death thinking about
[1:11:51] all these things but just commit it into
[1:11:53] the hands of God Amen he spoke it and
[1:11:56] he'll perform it amen he'll take care of
[1:11:59] it oh you've held it in your hands long
[1:12:01] enough haven't you held it long enough
[1:12:05] uh maybe a mother here that you've held
[1:12:07] it so long till it weighs on you but but
[1:12:10] I am persuaded that this voice that has
[1:12:14] spoken he's able to keep that which he's
[1:12:17] that which you commit into his
[1:12:19] hands oh it's the voice of God and and
[1:12:23] we're persuaded
[1:12:25] and and that's why we persevere uh
[1:12:28] because it's this voice pulsating into
[1:12:31] our hearts and sometimes you get weary
[1:12:34] and sometimes you feel like throwing in
[1:12:35] the towel and and then you come to
[1:12:37] church on Sunday morning and brother
[1:12:39] Samuel's preaching away and all a sudden
[1:12:41] it becomes more than the voice of
[1:12:43] brother Samuel but God picks up that
[1:12:45] voice and begins to speak don't give up
[1:12:48] don't give in you're a Son of God keep
[1:12:50] pressing and all of a sudden that voice
[1:12:53] begins to persuade you to keep going oh
[1:12:57] it's not a lying spirit that we're
[1:12:59] persuaded by it's the spirit of God
[1:13:01] that's persuading our lives back to the
[1:13:04] voice we're not here to to to lift up
[1:13:07] ourselves we're here to lift up lift up
[1:13:09] the voice of God uh the Bible said if I
[1:13:12] be lifted up I will draw all men unto me
[1:13:15] and brother brandham said hear ye him
[1:13:18] he's the one that can save you he's the
[1:13:20] one that can heal you he's the one
[1:13:22] that's responsible for this he's the one
[1:13:24] respons responsible to his word he said
[1:13:26] preach it from the pulpit whatever
[1:13:28] wherever you are lift him up give him to
[1:13:31] the people hear ye him amen Amen brother
[1:13:35] Samuel we have no ability as humans to
[1:13:38] to fix problems and and to answer
[1:13:40] questions but we're here to exalt The
[1:13:43] Voice hearing him and if he be lifted up
[1:13:47] he can take care of every situation he
[1:13:50] can take care of every problem amen just
[1:13:52] hear ye him don't uh you got some come
[1:13:56] sometimes come to the place where you
[1:13:57] stop exalting the problem and you start
[1:14:00] exalting the solution you start exalting
[1:14:03] the voice and mean I don't understand it
[1:14:05] Lord but I'm listening I don't
[1:14:08] understand it Lord but I'm trying I'm
[1:14:09] trying to pay attention to your voice
[1:14:11] Lord what do you have to say about it
[1:14:13] Lord what do you think about it anden
[1:14:15] we're not here to lift ourselves up
[1:14:17] we're here to lift up the voice of the
[1:14:19] Lord because brother brandom taught us
[1:14:21] that a true Mount Transfiguration
[1:14:23] experience didn't glorify Moses it
[1:14:26] didn't glorify Elijah it only glorified
[1:14:29] Jesus Christ and a true Mount
[1:14:31] Transfiguration experience will only
[1:14:32] glorify Jesus Christ and a true adopted
[1:14:36] son or daughter is not here on the earth
[1:14:38] to build a kingdom for themselves oh
[1:14:40] you're not here on the earth to build up
[1:14:42] something for yourself look at me look
[1:14:44] at what I can do look at what I've done
[1:14:46] for the Lord but we're here to point to
[1:14:48] him and lift up Jesus Christ and say
[1:14:51] look at him hear his voice he's the one
[1:14:55] he's the one coming in power it's his
[1:14:57] kingdom that we're interested in oh hear
[1:15:00] ye him hear the word of the Lord and
[1:15:02] lift him up amen we're not here to
[1:15:04] establish ourselves we're here to
[1:15:07] establish the word of God in the hearts
[1:15:09] of the people amen that they might come
[1:15:12] into into a solid Church uh so that a
[1:15:17] young person that's so unstable could
[1:15:19] come to a place of rest to come to a
[1:15:23] place of solidness and never come
[1:15:26] through our ability it'll come through
[1:15:27] the word of the Lord amen we're about
[1:15:31] the father's business and that's to
[1:15:33] vindicate the word we've got one
[1:15:35] objective win souls we've got one mode
[1:15:38] of love one objective mind the father
[1:15:41] keep the word I mean that's our desire
[1:15:45] and if that's not your desire I mean you
[1:15:48] got to look at yourself say Lord what
[1:15:51] kingdom am I working for what what
[1:15:54] kingdom am I labor in for amen if I were
[1:15:56] just to get up here just to try to say
[1:15:58] look at me amen and try to build a
[1:16:01] kingdom for myself amen it in a blink of
[1:16:04] an eye it would crumble down again but
[1:16:06] if we labor for the kingdom of God I
[1:16:09] mean it's an eternal Kingdom that's why
[1:16:11] we're here to labor not just to not just
[1:16:14] to build numbers I mean if God does it
[1:16:16] that's great but but but the main thing
[1:16:19] is we want to get the people to Jesus we
[1:16:21] want to get them to an experience and we
[1:16:23] want to get them to a reality we want to
[1:16:26] get them to the kingdom of God we want
[1:16:28] to get them to a place where where if we
[1:16:30] never see him again on this Earth we
[1:16:32] know that we'll meet them in eternity
[1:16:34] and that's the kingdom that we're
[1:16:36] working for we're not working for the
[1:16:38] kingdoms of of our own selves but we're
[1:16:40] laboring for the kingdom of God Amen
[1:16:43] brother Brandon preached this message
[1:16:44] hear you him and one time he preached it
[1:16:47] in an arena and he he was talking about
[1:16:49] calling a prayer line and he said well
[1:16:51] we can't call a prayer line maybe
[1:16:53] because of of of the situation this is
[1:16:56] an arena and he said Brothers we'll be
[1:16:58] fighting Brothers tomorrow night but
[1:17:00] tonight is the house of God and that's
[1:17:03] the thing that a prophet could come on
[1:17:05] the earth and he could turn an arena
[1:17:07] into the church anden but what we never
[1:17:09] want us do is turn the church into Arena
[1:17:12] and turn it into a bunch of fighting and
[1:17:14] a bunch of bickering and a bunch of
[1:17:15] arguing but we're here to lift up the
[1:17:17] voice of the Lord we're here to lift up
[1:17:20] him he you him he's the Alpha and Omega
[1:17:23] he's the problem Sol
[1:17:25] is's a yay and amen oh lift up him and
[1:17:29] let him come down oh and take care of
[1:17:31] the problem oh it it's a word of Pardon
[1:17:36] amen it's a
[1:17:38] reality oh hear ye himen but we are but
[1:17:42] we are in a fight amen it's just that
[1:17:45] you got to learn how to fight amen some
[1:17:48] Sometimes some of us might be built a
[1:17:50] little bit a little bit quick to the gun
[1:17:53] and that's okay but you just got to
[1:17:55] yield that to the Lord amen and instead
[1:17:57] of using that on your brother and and
[1:17:59] you use it on the devil for Paul said we
[1:18:02] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:18:04] against principalities and Powers
[1:18:07] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:18:08] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:18:11] in high places amen and Peter when he
[1:18:14] was on the earth there there he was and
[1:18:16] he was ready to cut off the ear of that
[1:18:18] Soldier amen but then he went up to the
[1:18:20] upper room and God sent down a power on
[1:18:23] his life and he he became became the
[1:18:25] spokesman for the day of Pentecost and
[1:18:27] brother Bram said we got to fight he
[1:18:29] said but pick up tonight and receive the
[1:18:31] Holy Ghost and defeat every devil of sin
[1:18:34] drunkenness whatever it is we've got him
[1:18:36] on the run to be conquered and he would
[1:18:39] tell us about Arnold Von Winkler how how
[1:18:41] how Arnold Von Winkler gave sticks and
[1:18:44] stones and and gave him to his army to
[1:18:47] follow him and fight but brother said we
[1:18:49] don't got sticks and stones but we got
[1:18:51] the word and the spirit anden and we're
[1:18:54] commanded to fight against this devil
[1:18:56] amen friends we we've got to fight we
[1:19:00] we've got young people that that need
[1:19:01] the Lord we've got people that that are
[1:19:04] in real battles and so and so we've got
[1:19:06] to fight we've got something worth
[1:19:09] fighting for anden we've got a kingdom
[1:19:11] worth laboring for that it's worth
[1:19:13] getting down on your knees and and
[1:19:15] saying Lord I need you right now Lord
[1:19:18] I'm in a real situation Lord and you've
[1:19:20] given me your word and you've given me
[1:19:23] your spirit so Lord I I've come to fight
[1:19:26] for fight for my promises I've come to
[1:19:29] fight Lord that you would that you would
[1:19:31] come in on the my behalf Lord and Rescue
[1:19:35] Me Oh in this dark trial uh you see it's
[1:19:38] becoming of you to fulfill all
[1:19:41] righteousness it's becoming of you to
[1:19:43] keep pressing you know when brother
[1:19:45] Brandon preached that message it
[1:19:47] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[1:19:49] there he was preaching that while his
[1:19:51] mother Lay Dying in the hospital and
[1:19:54] there he was and he would preach away
[1:19:56] and said but it's becoming of me now to
[1:19:58] stay with this word it's becoming of me
[1:20:01] now and he would come to that end of the
[1:20:03] service and say that the devil's been
[1:20:05] trying to get me out of this Pulpit all
[1:20:07] this time but it's becoming a me and he
[1:20:09] would begin to stand there as a Son of
[1:20:12] God in his position and say it's
[1:20:15] becoming of me now to stand for this
[1:20:17] word and amen it's becoming of you as
[1:20:20] Sons and Daughters of God to stay in
[1:20:22] your position oh the devil will try to
[1:20:25] persuade you out of your position try to
[1:20:27] persuade you not to come to church try
[1:20:29] to persuade you that that you're never
[1:20:31] going to make it or that this Holy Ghost
[1:20:33] isn't for you or that Joy isn't for you
[1:20:37] or that peace isn't for you oh that
[1:20:39] you're never going to rise to the level
[1:20:42] of a real son or daughter you'll never
[1:20:44] be able to be the type of Christian that
[1:20:45] your pastor is oh but take heed to the
[1:20:48] voice of the Lord that's persuading You
[1:20:50] Stand Fast oh don't leave your position
[1:20:54] oh and brother Brandon preached that
[1:20:55] message and he came back and preached
[1:20:57] the comforter that evening and he would
[1:20:59] say m Mama doesn't know it but he kept
[1:21:02] her alive amen Jesus was there taking
[1:21:05] care of Mama while brother brandom stood
[1:21:07] in his position amen and if you stay in
[1:21:10] your position as a as a son or daughter
[1:21:12] of God he's able to take care of every
[1:21:15] situation he's able to take care of your
[1:21:18] family he's able to take care of your
[1:21:20] loved ones he's able to take care of it
[1:21:23] oh he's able to take care
[1:21:25] just just commited onto him and stay in
[1:21:27] your position oh he'll take care of iten
[1:21:32] but we've had them we've had something
[1:21:34] that's come in this age and and there
[1:21:36] they were on that mount Transfiguration
[1:21:38] and what was Mount Transfiguration doing
[1:21:40] it it ended the
[1:21:42] struggle because God was establishing a
[1:21:45] kingdom and it would no more be just the
[1:21:48] words of the law and the prophets but
[1:21:50] here the fullness of the word was coming
[1:21:52] in their midst and and he was man esting
[1:21:55] and vdic vindicating the words uh that
[1:21:58] have been spoken by the prophets before
[1:22:00] him he was the
[1:22:02] manifestation of the prophet's words and
[1:22:05] here the prophet would would cry out
[1:22:07] thus sayith the Lord but now he would
[1:22:09] come on the earth and say I say unto you
[1:22:12] here he he was had come from partial
[1:22:15] realization brother BR say to perfect
[1:22:17] realization he in the in in the days of
[1:22:21] the Israelites they had Mana from heaven
[1:22:23] but Jesus was the the true bread from
[1:22:25] Heaven they had partial salvation under
[1:22:29] the blood of bulls and goats but here
[1:22:31] was the one that was would bring the
[1:22:34] fullness that he could enter in once and
[1:22:37] shed a blood for our sins and it would
[1:22:39] say Israel had light but now True Light
[1:22:41] had come now the Fulfillment of light
[1:22:44] has come and said Moses was a prophet
[1:22:47] but Jesus was the prophet amen David was
[1:22:50] king of Israel but Jesus was the greater
[1:22:53] David he he was theing king of kings and
[1:22:56] Peter wrote about this in second Peter 1
[1:22:58] and said whever I will endeavor that you
[1:23:01] may be able after my decease to have
[1:23:04] these things always in remembrance for
[1:23:06] we have not followed cunningly devised
[1:23:08] fables when we made known unto you the
[1:23:10] power and coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:23:12] Christ but we're eyewitnesses of this
[1:23:15] Majesty for he received from God the
[1:23:18] Father honor and Glory when there came
[1:23:20] such a voice to him from the excellent
[1:23:22] Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I
[1:23:25] am well pleased and this voice which
[1:23:27] came from heaven we heard when we were
[1:23:30] with him in the Holy Mount and said we
[1:23:32] also have a more sure word of Prophecy
[1:23:34] where unto you do well that you take
[1:23:36] heed amen see that you refuse it not as
[1:23:40] onto a light that shineth in a dark
[1:23:42] place until the day Dawn and the day
[1:23:44] star arise in your hearts oh he said
[1:23:47] knowing that no Prophecy of the
[1:23:49] scriptures of any private interpretation
[1:23:52] you see up to that point there may have
[1:23:54] been people going about saying this is
[1:23:55] how the Messiah will come this is how
[1:23:58] it's going to be here's my
[1:23:59] interpretation of it I think this is how
[1:24:01] it's going to be but now they would no
[1:24:03] longer have to be held under the
[1:24:05] confusion of private interpretations
[1:24:09] because God interprets his word by
[1:24:11] bringing it to pass and here was the
[1:24:13] true interpretation of the word the
[1:24:16] Messiah had come God had answered their
[1:24:19] cry and they could not they could walk
[1:24:21] in the light of that Vindicated word and
[1:24:23] they would no longer have to be under
[1:24:26] confusion because the Messiah had
[1:24:29] come and that Vindicated word could
[1:24:32] consume their minds consume their lives
[1:24:36] amen amen something's going to consume
[1:24:38] Our Lives amen uh I think sometimes not
[1:24:43] all of it's bad but sometimes maybe uh
[1:24:46] uh Hobbies consume our lives and and
[1:24:49] certain things consume our lives but
[1:24:51] something's going to consume your life
[1:24:53] amen h as a human being and and there's
[1:24:56] going to be something that that has
[1:24:58] preeminence in your life but but I'm so
[1:25:00] thankful that that that Paul told us
[1:25:02] that our God is a consuming fire amen
[1:25:06] and fire is the most consuming thing
[1:25:08] that there is and and so brother brandom
[1:25:10] said we just need the fire he said let
[1:25:13] the fires go out in your church brother
[1:25:15] and the church is gone he said he would
[1:25:17] tell a story about this I believe it a
[1:25:19] Baptist preacher who had got saved and
[1:25:21] they were trying to tell him that uh you
[1:25:23] can't preach like that anymore he said
[1:25:25] if you don't quit preaching like that
[1:25:26] you're going to kill your church and
[1:25:28] brother B said he said look at here
[1:25:30] Elder he said any church that ever dies
[1:25:32] with Holy Ghost fire in it he said I'll
[1:25:35] climb them old Vines out there to the
[1:25:37] top of this Pinnacle lay my hands on it
[1:25:39] and say bless it is the law the dead
[1:25:41] defying the law he said they don't die
[1:25:44] they just get alive they die to the
[1:25:46] things of the world in order to come
[1:25:48] alive in Christ Jesus amen and fire has
[1:25:52] been God's program amen throughout the
[1:25:55] Bible in the Book of Genesis brother
[1:25:58] Paul that if they wanted to come into
[1:26:00] the garden and get to that tree of life
[1:26:02] they had to come by those cherubims
[1:26:04] right and those cherubims would hold
[1:26:06] that fiery sword and guard that tree of
[1:26:09] life and they would keep them out from
[1:26:12] that garden and now those chims are are
[1:26:15] not keeping us from that tree of life
[1:26:17] now they're ushering Us in amen but but
[1:26:20] they still have that element of fire
[1:26:23] because brother B would tell us that he
[1:26:25] said notice Holy Spirit fire guarding
[1:26:28] the gate he said and today that's what
[1:26:30] guards the gate he said if you're scared
[1:26:32] of Holy Ghost and Fire you'll never get
[1:26:34] in fiery the sword of God God is a
[1:26:37] consuming fire watching that tree
[1:26:40] guarding that tree of life anden and God
[1:26:43] Appears in fire god appeared in fire in
[1:26:46] the burning bush with Moses that right
[1:26:48] brother Aaron and go God God appeared in
[1:26:51] fire amen before Daniel and and the Dan
[1:26:55] of lions and those Lions wouldn't even
[1:26:57] touch him and that in the presence of
[1:26:59] that Pillar of Fire like that old song
[1:27:02] brother Brandon was saying it's the
[1:27:03] oldtime Holy Spirit and the devil Don't
[1:27:06] Go Near it that's the reason people fear
[1:27:08] it but it's good enough for me it's the
[1:27:11] fire of God and God Appears in it and he
[1:27:15] appeared in it on the road to Damascus
[1:27:17] amen he appears in Fire H but but it's a
[1:27:21] consuming fire and mean and the first
[1:27:23] time fire was mentioned in the Bible was
[1:27:25] when Sodom and Gomorrah uh uh it began
[1:27:28] to telling how they were judged as fire
[1:27:30] and brimstone fell upon him in judgment
[1:27:33] anden and Jude picked that up in in the
[1:27:36] book of Jude and and says even as Sodom
[1:27:38] and Gomorrah and the cities about them
[1:27:40] in like manner giving themselves over to
[1:27:42] fornication and going after strange
[1:27:44] flesh are set forth an example suffering
[1:27:47] the Vengeance of Eternal fire it's fire
[1:27:51] that completely consumes and and does
[1:27:53] away with anden and and but but when
[1:27:56] brother Brandon picked up that that
[1:27:58] verse on Eternal fire he said that is to
[1:28:01] be completely consumed and done away
[1:28:03] with man as we begin to draw it to a
[1:28:06] close here he is making this point that
[1:28:09] there is a a consuming fire but they
[1:28:12] would ask him about you know brother
[1:28:14] they would ask brother brandom about a
[1:28:15] question on eternal hell and I love his
[1:28:18] answer he said will it just be like
[1:28:20] regular Brimstone he said I believe
[1:28:22] it'll be a million times worse than that
[1:28:23] I I believe you couldn't describe it by
[1:28:25] fire by literal fire he said the only
[1:28:27] reason it's put by fire is that fire is
[1:28:30] the most consuming thing that we have it
[1:28:33] absolutely consumes and destroys
[1:28:35] everything fire does he said well then
[1:28:37] it'll be in there but you'll have a soul
[1:28:39] that'll have to be punished through some
[1:28:41] kind and then he stops and he says now
[1:28:43] we have to watch the word fire because
[1:28:46] the Holy Ghost is used the Holy Ghost
[1:28:49] and Fire cuz Holy Ghost Fire Burns sin
[1:28:52] out see and makes clean
[1:28:54] amen so you see friends there's going to
[1:28:56] come a time in your life where you'll
[1:28:58] have to come in contact with fire and
[1:29:00] you'll either be saved by fire or you'll
[1:29:03] be destroyed by fire but there is God's
[1:29:05] got of fire and mean and just as he'll
[1:29:08] use that Holy Fire to cleanse this Earth
[1:29:10] that a bride May dwell on it amen in in
[1:29:13] in the in the world that is to come so
[1:29:16] there is a fire that he sends down to
[1:29:19] clean out your heart and clean out your
[1:29:21] life that he may dwell in it and and God
[1:29:24] God still got a fire to consume
[1:29:27] sacrifices I still believe that you can
[1:29:29] lay yourself before the Lord as a
[1:29:31] sacrifice and he's still got a fire that
[1:29:34] he'll send down and he'll consume you as
[1:29:36] a pig and rebirth you as a lamb and
[1:29:39] rebirth you as a Son of God and that
[1:29:42] Fire released in the church amen will do
[1:29:44] more than any any program will ever do
[1:29:48] than any soup supper would ever do than
[1:29:50] than any psychology will ever do it's
[1:29:53] the fire of God God that will birth you
[1:29:55] into a Son of God it's not the it's not
[1:29:58] uh it's not some wild fire it's it's
[1:30:01] God's fire God's had a fire through all
[1:30:03] generations it's the same fire that Paul
[1:30:06] met it's the same fire that Moses met
[1:30:09] it's that same fire that's still in our
[1:30:12] lives today that comes and burns out sin
[1:30:15] and consumes you as a Living Sacrifice
[1:30:19] oh and it's a fire that'll keep you it's
[1:30:21] a keeping power in the heart of the
[1:30:24] believer and me brother bam say you
[1:30:25] can't burn it out and mean they tried to
[1:30:28] burn it out in the Hebrew children and
[1:30:30] me and they there was brother said how
[1:30:32] could fire burn fire and there was a
[1:30:35] fire in those children that couldn't be
[1:30:37] burned out no matter what trials they
[1:30:39] went through no matter but the bible say
[1:30:41] that they didn't even smell like fire
[1:30:44] amen and sometimes you go through a
[1:30:46] trial and as a real believer if you
[1:30:48] didn't tell somebody about it they would
[1:30:50] never know it because you don't smell
[1:30:52] like fire you don't look burn at all but
[1:30:55] there's a fire in you that has kept you
[1:30:58] through many trials and many
[1:31:00] tribulations he brother said you can't
[1:31:02] boil it out they couldn't boil it out of
[1:31:05] John uh in that vat of oil because he
[1:31:08] said how could you boil fire with fire
[1:31:11] there was a fire in John that no devil
[1:31:14] could boil out no enemy could take that
[1:31:17] from him it had been lit by God and it
[1:31:20] kept him through all of his days and me
[1:31:22] you can't blow it out and there's not
[1:31:24] enough cold spells to blow it out
[1:31:26] there's not enough indifference Sister
[1:31:28] Kim to blow it out there's not enough
[1:31:30] fighting and bickering to blow it out
[1:31:32] and mean it'll keep you in the midst of
[1:31:34] every trial and tribulation and mean
[1:31:37] there's not enough Winds of Doctrine to
[1:31:38] blow out the fire of God in his church
[1:31:42] amen amen because brother BR told us
[1:31:44] that when a man walks in the light the
[1:31:46] wind follows and me and when the
[1:31:48] children of Israel walked in the light
[1:31:50] brother there was a wind that came
[1:31:52] behind him and split that Red Sea wide
[1:31:54] open that they could walk through it and
[1:31:56] when men of God Walk In The Light
[1:31:58] there's a wind that follows and when we
[1:32:01] walk in the light of this Vindicated
[1:32:03] word there is a wind of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:05] that follows amen and that wind is
[1:32:07] greater than any wind of doctrine that
[1:32:10] wind is greater than any wind of
[1:32:12] adversity or any wind of Opp opposition
[1:32:15] it it's the fire of God that's consumed
[1:32:18] our lives and brother once you once been
[1:32:20] saved by fire you can't be destroyed by
[1:32:23] fire and me the fire of hell has no
[1:32:26] power over your life and me atomic fire
[1:32:28] can't hurt you once you've ever once
[1:32:30] been consumed by the fire of God anden
[1:32:33] judgment has no power over your life why
[1:32:37] is that because uh he that heareth my
[1:32:40] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:32:43] shall not come into judgment shall not
[1:32:46] come into condemnation but has already
[1:32:48] passed from Death onto life when you
[1:32:50] heard this word it released a pardon
[1:32:53] over your life amen in judgment fire
[1:32:56] cannot ever affect you which have been
[1:32:59] consumed with the fire of God it's the
[1:33:02] same fire that's been through all the
[1:33:04] ages it's the same fire that was lit on
[1:33:08] that sacred altar brother Brandon would
[1:33:10] tell us about that he's like there
[1:33:12] here's this this lamp post it's not so
[1:33:15] much a candle because a candle fire
[1:33:18] doesn't last but he would begin to
[1:33:20] describe to us that God had had a lamp
[1:33:23] with with with seven seven different uh
[1:33:26] torches for The Seven Ages and God lit
[1:33:29] that fire uh the priest took that fire
[1:33:32] from the sacred altar which God had lit
[1:33:35] and they lit that first candle and
[1:33:37] brother Brandon said it was like the
[1:33:39] outpouring on the day of Pentecost and
[1:33:41] then they would take that first candle
[1:33:43] and light that second candle and the
[1:33:45] third and fourth and fifth and sixth and
[1:33:47] seventh and and God had seven Messengers
[1:33:51] assigned to keep that flame burning
[1:33:53] through those Seven Ages uh but you know
[1:33:56] when one age would come and that
[1:33:58] messenger would go off the scene they
[1:33:59] would denominate and that fire would go
[1:34:02] out and brother Brenham said they would
[1:34:03] have to pass the torch light to the next
[1:34:06] one and and they said the methodists you
[1:34:08] know they were doing good but they
[1:34:10] denominated and the fire went out and
[1:34:13] and the torch light went on but but
[1:34:15] friends now we're in the final age and
[1:34:18] there's not another age coming and so if
[1:34:21] we if if if we ever let the fire go out
[1:34:23] there's not another age coming to pick
[1:34:25] it up amen but I'm so thankful that God
[1:34:29] has predestinated a bride that that
[1:34:32] would not denominate that that that
[1:34:34] would not add or take away one word amen
[1:34:37] but but but but if if through all those
[1:34:40] ages denomination was what put that fire
[1:34:43] out and then God's got a prde on the
[1:34:45] earth and he's got a message on the
[1:34:47] earth that can't be denominated uh you
[1:34:50] know brother brenon would say that
[1:34:51] usually after about three years the
[1:34:53] message that would come would go off
[1:34:55] into organization he said but this one's
[1:34:58] been going for nearly 20 years he said
[1:35:01] and it's still going
[1:35:03] because this is the wheat now this is
[1:35:06] this can't be
[1:35:07] denominated and that was nearly 60 years
[1:35:10] ago so the same fire am mean that
[1:35:13] brother brandom enjoyed is the same fire
[1:35:16] that we're enjoying and it's never going
[1:35:18] to go out it's never going to diminish
[1:35:22] anytime that fire would would start to
[1:35:24] maybe get low that priest would just
[1:35:26] come by and pour more more oil in amen
[1:35:30] and God me and as brother Brandon would
[1:35:33] say that there there would be a wise
[1:35:35] virgin that would have oil in her lamp
[1:35:38] and and she would have the fire on that
[1:35:40] oil she would be able to reflect the
[1:35:42] word and you would be able to
[1:35:45] enjoy a Revival that would never end me
[1:35:49] because it's fed by the word of God and
[1:35:53] and and it makes you a a lasting people
[1:35:57] it makes
[1:35:58] you if this is a kingdom that cannot be
[1:36:01] moved brother Shane and and that kingdom
[1:36:04] is in you then that makes you
[1:36:06] unmovable amen you feel like I mean uh
[1:36:10] any day now I'm just going to I'm just
[1:36:12] going to crumble any day now I'm just
[1:36:14] going to come to my end and and maybe
[1:36:17] just any day now I I'll just my my Folly
[1:36:21] will be made known and and I'm just
[1:36:23] going to crumble but but that's not how
[1:36:25] this Kingdom Works friends when this
[1:36:28] kingdom is in you it's a kingdom that
[1:36:31] cannot be moved am me and before there
[1:36:33] ever was a world to fall apart before
[1:36:36] there ever was a denomination to fall
[1:36:38] apart you were in God you were in that
[1:36:42] unmovable one and so when he expressed
[1:36:45] you forth as an attribute in this age
[1:36:48] and then he birthed you into this
[1:36:49] Kingdom it's a kingdom which cannot be
[1:36:52] moved you can't not be shaken anden
[1:36:55] there may be a lot of voices trying to
[1:36:57] persuade you to to give up uh trying to
[1:37:00] persuade you that that that is it is
[1:37:03] this all really true uh can I trust it
[1:37:06] can I really trust it for my family can
[1:37:08] I can I really trust it oh but there's a
[1:37:11] jean seed in there that speaks back I've
[1:37:15] already taken heed to the voice I've
[1:37:18] already heard I'm satisfied I am
[1:37:21] persuaded that there is no other voice
[1:37:24] oh that I need to listen to but this
[1:37:26] voice amen there's a there's a lot I I I
[1:37:29] I know how how how the devil works
[1:37:32] sometimes I I mean I don't know if I've
[1:37:34] got him all the way figured out but but
[1:37:36] I know that he he likes to talk a lot
[1:37:39] and he'll get in your mind and he'll
[1:37:42] he'll try to talk and talk and talk but
[1:37:44] but but he has no place amen and you you
[1:37:48] have a right as a son or daughter of God
[1:37:51] to refuse that voice and say no I I've
[1:37:55] already heard the voice of the word and
[1:37:58] this voice says I've already made it
[1:38:01] this voice says that it's for me this
[1:38:03] voice says that that I I can't miss it I
[1:38:06] came from God and I'm going back to God
[1:38:10] this voice speaks better things over
[1:38:12] your life than what the devil will tell
[1:38:15] you take heed to the voice of the Lord
[1:38:18] hear ye him there's power in that voice
[1:38:22] there's power that it can lead you to an
[1:38:24] overcoming life it can lead you to
[1:38:27] victory you can live a stable life in
[1:38:30] the midst of instability in the midst of
[1:38:33] a world falling apart amen amen how many
[1:38:37] witnesses are here in the building that
[1:38:39] that this word brings stability to your
[1:38:41] life how many you you can see that that
[1:38:46] there is something about this I mean
[1:38:48] there's nothing stable about me there's
[1:38:51] nothing stable about about my mind about
[1:38:55] sometimes even my spirit it's up and
[1:38:56] down but there's something about this
[1:38:59] word that I've anchored into it's a
[1:39:01] stability it's a
[1:39:03] solidness it's an absolute amen amen and
[1:39:08] and and as the musicians
[1:39:10] come there's there's when you could look
[1:39:14] you could look at a picture on the wall
[1:39:17] of of a of a of a fire and you could
[1:39:20] look at that picture and you could say
[1:39:22] mama what's that fire all about what is
[1:39:25] that and it it's it's not a painting
[1:39:27] even of a fire it's not even someone's
[1:39:29] imagination it's it's a picture of a
[1:39:31] fire that actually happened and they say
[1:39:33] well you know few years ago we had this
[1:39:37] great big fire and it was it was so
[1:39:39] wonderful you say my that's nice I I'd
[1:39:43] like to enjoy that and and and you you
[1:39:45] go through that stage sometimes as a
[1:39:47] Christian where where you hear the
[1:39:49] pastor talking about it and and you hear
[1:39:52] about it but but but you say my I'd like
[1:39:56] to have that for myself and and so maybe
[1:39:58] you walk outside and just a just an
[1:40:02] illust just something that maybe the way
[1:40:04] my mind works and and you see a great
[1:40:06] big bonfire and you say my that looks
[1:40:10] kind of like that picture I'd like to
[1:40:12] I'd like to be a part of that and you
[1:40:14] walk out and my you get warm from that
[1:40:17] you get warm from that fire you say my
[1:40:19] this is just like that that this is this
[1:40:22] and it's a real fire fire and it keeps
[1:40:24] you warm but then the minute you walk
[1:40:27] away all of a sudden that warmth leaves
[1:40:29] you and you think my how could that be
[1:40:32] that fire is is so real and it's so warm
[1:40:35] but but but brother Brandon would take
[1:40:38] that and show it like like coming to a
[1:40:40] meeting you know and you come to a
[1:40:42] meeting and it's it's the fire of God is
[1:40:45] being poured out and it's it's real fire
[1:40:48] and it's it's real fire that's being
[1:40:50] poured out and touching lives and and
[1:40:53] and but sometimes I I I if you're if
[1:40:56] it's just uh you know maybe you're not
[1:40:58] all the way uh where you should be with
[1:41:01] the Lord then when you leave he would
[1:41:03] talk about how sometimes those those
[1:41:05] Campground cramps set in and and you
[1:41:08] think my I I wish I could just keep the
[1:41:11] victory I I wish I could feel that way
[1:41:13] all the time and it wasn't that it was
[1:41:16] fanaticism no it was real fire and you
[1:41:19] were really feeling that effect but but
[1:41:22] it you see how brother brand would take
[1:41:24] how the Pentecostals could have that
[1:41:26] baptism on the spirit and and and have
[1:41:29] it on their every day of their lives and
[1:41:31] go to hell and you think my how could
[1:41:33] that be but just like standing before a
[1:41:35] bonfire you could stand before that
[1:41:37] bonfire every day of your life and and
[1:41:40] feel warmth but the minute you walk away
[1:41:42] you'll get cold
[1:41:44] again but but but you're a you're you're
[1:41:47] a you're a three compartment individual
[1:41:49] right and brother Brandon would teach us
[1:41:51] that every every house really has three
[1:41:53] rooms you know you have your kitchen you
[1:41:55] have your living area and then you have
[1:41:57] your
[1:41:59] bedroom and
[1:42:01] so there's I talked to a buddy one time
[1:42:04] and he said that a house fire can be
[1:42:06] fully consumed within five minutes I
[1:42:09] thought my Moses spent five minutes in
[1:42:12] front of that burning bush and it did
[1:42:14] more for him than than anything in the
[1:42:17] world could ever do than 40 years in
[1:42:19] Egypt could ever do and it brought his
[1:42:21] stability to his life and then it said
[1:42:24] how most house fires start in the
[1:42:26] kitchen I thought my there's that
[1:42:28] there's that outer realm and and you
[1:42:31] feel that fire and but as that fire
[1:42:33] begins to Creep from that kitchen it
[1:42:36] begins to creep into that living room
[1:42:38] but if that fire ever once gets in that
[1:42:40] bedroom oh then brother it's a fully
[1:42:43] consumed fire it's a fully consumed
[1:42:46] house and and this fire that I'm talking
[1:42:48] about it's the fire of God anden and if
[1:42:51] that fire gets on your flesh
[1:42:53] it'll make you dress right it'll make
[1:42:56] you car of yourself right that fire gets
[1:42:58] in your spirit it'll make you act right
[1:43:00] it'll give you a good spirit it'll give
[1:43:02] you brotherly kindness it it'll give you
[1:43:05] Joy but that fire every once gets into
[1:43:07] that soul and brother you are you are
[1:43:10] sealed for eternity you you won't be
[1:43:13] shaken you won't be moved you'll believe
[1:43:16] this word all the days of your life
[1:43:19] because it's the fire of God Amen and
[1:43:22] and as we stand our feet amen amen
[1:43:25] that's my
[1:43:26] desire I know it's a little chopped up
[1:43:28] tonight but but maybe if I don't know if
[1:43:30] we know that song consume me Lord with
[1:43:33] the fire of your spirit and me that's my
[1:43:36] prayer and man no matter how far you get
[1:43:39] even if you have been sealed sometimes
[1:43:42] you just get a little you feel like you
[1:43:44] get a little
[1:43:46] cold sometimes you've had that fire for
[1:43:48] years and years and you feel yourself
[1:43:51] just getting a little bit distant from
[1:43:53] the Lord amen but when it come to that

[1:55:05] hallelujah amen what a wonderful
[1:55:08] [Music]
[1:55:09] word that's truly that's what this this
[1:55:12] message is really is what it's all about
[1:55:14] it's a word of
[1:55:16] authority it's a word of Pardon it's a
[1:55:19] word of
[1:55:20] Grace you know it's all all it's all
[1:55:23] about how we receive it Hallelujah a lot
[1:55:26] of voices I I love how that brother
[1:55:28] Isaac brought that out that to recognize
[1:55:31] that as a Son of
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:34] God you do not become a son and daughter
[1:55:37] of God and we've heard this for years
[1:55:40] right you don't become that on a certain
[1:55:43] day that's why the real reality you
[1:55:48] always have a charge over the enemy me
[1:55:53] amen it would not matter of the greatest
[1:55:56] thing that a person could even be bound
[1:55:58] with or going through you know there
[1:56:01] wasn't enough demons to keep a man that
[1:56:03] we don't even know his name but he was
[1:56:05] called Legion yes right brother BR said
[1:56:09] he made a decision that he wasn't going
[1:56:11] to let them Devils keep him from Jesus
[1:56:14] you see what it showed was as a Son of
[1:56:16] God has Authority even to make a
[1:56:19] decision
[1:56:22] that's how it is in every situation amen
[1:56:26] and it brings it back to where that all
[1:56:27] of them like brother Isaac was saying
[1:56:29] all of those no matter what voices are
[1:56:31] going through your mind let me tell you
[1:56:34] something God will never and has never
[1:56:37] told anybody you can't find me one
[1:56:39] scripture where God ever told somebody
[1:56:42] you're not a
[1:56:44] son he's not even the one who
[1:56:46] discouraged the 10
[1:56:48] spies he never said nothing he never
[1:56:51] said he didn't love him they didn't
[1:56:53] believe his love for them yeah they
[1:56:56] didn't trust him but God never said that
[1:56:59] you said what are you saying brother
[1:57:00] Samuel is the voice that says speaks to
[1:57:04] you and it's a condemning voice that's
[1:57:06] not God's
[1:57:07] voice the voice of God will never
[1:57:10] condemn you he'll convict but conviction
[1:57:12] always shows you
[1:57:14] Calvary and Calvary always reveals who
[1:57:17] you are and Calvary always reveals the
[1:57:20] way out of whatever it is Calvary is the
[1:57:23] way out that we can follow him that's
[1:57:26] right through the blood no matter what
[1:57:27] the situation no matter what the need
[1:57:30] trial test habit Whatever It Is God has
[1:57:34] made a
[1:57:36] way and we just follow those bloody foot
[1:57:38] Footprints and this this word when God
[1:57:41] speaks a word like this you know God
[1:57:44] brings it he could have he could have
[1:57:46] let brother Isaac call out your
[1:57:47] situation or my situation or what's on
[1:57:50] my heart God could have done that but
[1:57:52] you see the spirit of Truth we're not in
[1:57:55] an age or a moment where the spirit of
[1:57:57] Truth is being introduced to the
[1:58:00] church he's
[1:58:02] here he's here and when he says when he
[1:58:06] said when he speaks he'll bring to our
[1:58:09] remembrance God speaks right over our
[1:58:11] life and we can go right down into it
[1:58:13] and it's as though we are here one onone
[1:58:16] and it's right here on the back wall now
[1:58:18] if God needs to call it out he can call
[1:58:20] it out but you see that Church of the
[1:58:22] Living God is no longer in an
[1:58:24] introductory stage to the spirit of
[1:58:26] Truth the spirit of Truth has come and
[1:58:29] Jesus Christ has been properly
[1:58:32] identified Among Us is that right God
[1:58:35] can use any gift that's true God will
[1:58:37] use he gets them out and use them as he
[1:58:39] needs them but the spirit of truth comes
[1:58:42] and to make known in our life and he'll
[1:58:43] speak to our hearts and all we have to
[1:58:46] do is yield amen and that word let me
[1:58:49] tell you I don't care what the enemy
[1:58:51] says I don't don't care what thought
[1:58:52] comes in your mind you take what God has
[1:58:57] spoken let every other word be a lie but
[1:59:01] let God's word be true amen God says
[1:59:04] God's word has never been
[1:59:08] defeated they'll never find a record
[1:59:10] where God's word Was
[1:59:12] Defeated When anybody let down on it
[1:59:15] that's when defeat come but never is
[1:59:17] there defeat in the word of God amen
[1:59:20] amen so let's hold to that
[1:59:23] amen when the word of God directed
[1:59:25] Samson go pick up that Jawbone the
[1:59:27] spirit of the Lord anointed him and
[1:59:29] directed him to pick that up and you
[1:59:32] know what that was the word of the Lord
[1:59:35] same thing with I with shamgar with the
[1:59:37] ox go the word of the Lord when God
[1:59:39] directs You by his word you take a hold
[1:59:42] of that word and stand there on your
[1:59:44] god-given ground and don't back down for
[1:59:47] one thing that word will see you through
[1:59:50] amen amen yeah brother Bram talked about
[1:59:53] that eagle being out there and all them
[1:59:54] chatter coming around of those Chipmunks
[1:59:57] he said I looked over at that eagle he
[1:59:58] wasn't a bit nervous brother BR said it
[2:00:00] like this in 64 questions and answers he
[2:00:02] said it's the same way it is he said as
[2:00:05] the eagle trusted those wings he said
[2:00:07] that's the same way this word will pack
[2:00:09] us away it'll Lift Us in situations
[2:00:13] it'll Lift Us in circumstances and it's
[2:00:16] lifting us and it's going to lift us
[2:00:18] into
[2:00:19] Glory Hallelujah this word has Authority
[2:00:22] has power in it and I believe we as a
[2:00:25] standing as the Church of the Living God
[2:00:27] we're sufficiently impressed amen with
[2:00:29] the word that's in our
[2:00:31] midst amen you Lov him
