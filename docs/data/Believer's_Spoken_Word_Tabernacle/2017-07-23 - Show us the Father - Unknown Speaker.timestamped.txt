[40:24] father's house are many mansions if it

[40:42] you know Thomas saith unto Him Lord we
[40:46] know not whether thou goest and how can
[40:49] we know the way and Jesus said I am the
[40:51] way the truth and the life no man cometh
[40:55] unto me cometh unto the father but by me
[40:59] if he had known me you should have known
[41:02] my father also and from henceforth you
[41:05] know him and have seen him
[41:07] and Philip saith unto Him Lord show us
[41:10] the father and it suffice us may be
[41:13] seated what I wanted to minister on this
[41:18] morning is show us the father brother
[41:24] Branham says and the message preached in
[41:27] 53 said let's take God in his universe
[41:30] God in His Word God and his son and then
[41:34] bring God down in his people and see if
[41:37] he isn't here in his people today you
[41:42] know the first Bible wasn't written in
[41:49] Word form God wrote it in the universe
[41:55] brother Branham said his first Bible was
[41:57] in he saw God in nature
[42:05] he spoke and said you know how you have
[42:08] a flower garden and you plant your
[42:11] flowers and they're there for a season
[42:14] and then as the first frost comes and
[42:18] the flowers die the petals fall off the
[42:22] stem dries up and everything's gone
[42:25] there's no nothing there to say there
[42:27] ever was a flower there and he says
[42:31] aniseed those down on the ground and
[42:35] when the freeze comes and freezes about
[42:37] 4 to 5 inches down into the ground the
[42:40] seed bursts open their industry there's
[42:44] nothing left
[42:45] everything's gone except there's a germ
[42:49] of life that no man has ever found and
[42:52] never will
[42:53] there's a germ of life that's laying
[42:55] there and as sure as there is a tomorrow
[43:00] when the spring comes that flower would
[43:03] come back forth again brother Branham
[43:06] said if God can make a flower that way
[43:08] how much more man that we're here for a
[43:15] season and those of us that go by the
[43:18] way of the grave there's nothing left
[43:22] behind physically to show we were ever
[43:25] even here just like the flower it's gone
[43:31] you're gone but just as sure as that
[43:37] flower races in the spring so will you
[43:41] in the resurrection I like that song
[43:45] brother Terry till those things there
[43:47] will be another spring a man will rise
[43:50] again
[43:52] I'm brother brown I'm spoken in a
[43:55] message preached in 53 and he said there
[43:59] was a hybrid man-made seed of corn and
[44:05] he said if you at that time and said if
[44:08] you took that man-made seed of corn and
[44:11] put it to the one that had grown in the
[44:14] field he said you couldn't tell the
[44:15] difference between
[44:16] they both look the same he said if you
[44:20] cut him open they both seemed the same
[44:22] but he said the only way you could tell
[44:25] the difference was to bury him and said
[44:28] when you bury him the ones just wanted
[44:30] they're both going to rot but one's just
[44:33] gonna rot and be no more but the one
[44:36] that has the germ of life in it is gonna
[44:38] come forth again and it'll bring bring
[44:42] forth a stalk of corn and then you take
[44:47] those seeds and plant those and they'll
[44:50] bring forth stalks of corn he was
[44:54] telling this to a preacher one time and
[44:57] he said preacher you better hold my hand
[45:00] because I'm getting ready to embarrass
[45:01] you he said this is just making me very
[45:05] real religious you can take two men both
[45:12] them look alike
[45:13] both of them act like Christians but one
[45:15] of them's got a germ of life which is
[45:18] the Holy Ghost and you'll rise in the
[45:20] resurrection and the other will lay
[45:21] there you know to see the Bible in
[45:26] nature it's not just to see God's in
[45:28] nature because of the magnificence of it
[45:31] but there's a manifestation of God's
[45:34] Word in action in nature remember when
[45:39] brother branham witness to the infidel
[45:42] brother branham didn't quote any
[45:45] scriptures from the Bible brother
[45:48] Branham began to point at God in nature
[45:52] and the infidel then saw God in nature
[46:06] I looked it up thinking about this earth
[46:10] that we live on and I looked it up when
[46:14] the earth is twenty five thousand miles
[46:16] around at the equator and it makes a
[46:20] full turn every 24 hours
[46:25] that means it's traveling at one
[46:28] thousand forty one point seven miles per
[46:32] hour how do we stand in one place you
[46:40] say gravity explained to me showed me
[46:44] gravity they said gravity is produced
[46:50] because the world is spinning around
[46:53] that's what science says but cut me off
[46:57] a piece of gravity and give it to me try
[47:04] to can up some gravity you can't do it
[47:09] to me it's a mystery of God say what
[47:15] keeps us on this earth because we're
[47:17] supposed to be here that's what I say
[47:20] that's where God put us and it don't
[47:24] matter how fast the Earth spins or how
[47:26] slow it spins God put us here we're
[47:29] going to be here until the coming of the
[47:31] Lord it orbits around the Sun at 67,000
[47:38] miles per hour and it just hangs up
[47:45] there what keeps the earth up there it's
[47:48] God the Creator he put it there by what
[47:54] manner did he put it there by a spoken
[47:57] word he spoke the word and it became the
[48:03] power of the spoken word you know
[48:08] brother Branham said if man could just
[48:11] open his eyes and look around he'd see
[48:13] God everywhere want to read this to you
[48:22] around says he said I looked and the Sun
[48:26] was setting over on the west peeping
[48:28] through that crevice of the mountains
[48:30] like that I thought old great Jehovah
[48:33] his eye on the sparrow how did he stands
[48:36] in the heavens and his eyes look out and
[48:38] he sees every move not a sparrow could
[48:41] touch the ground without him seeing it
[48:43] you see God in his son said can't you
[48:46] see him that way think of him in the
[48:48] sunset or the sunrise and then I
[48:51] happened to look where the Sun was
[48:53] shining against this water and stuff and
[48:56] it made a rainbow across the canyon
[48:59] there and I looked at the rainbow and
[49:02] said Oh glory to God I just love to look
[49:04] at God in his nature don't you and I
[49:07] said looky there
[49:08] you gave Noah the rainbow sign before
[49:13] the time the water had never come this
[49:16] way so the waters the elements couldn't
[49:19] make that colors and now you gave him
[49:23] the rainbow sign that you would never
[49:25] destroy the earth no more by water then
[49:29] I happen to think again that when John
[49:31] on the Isle of Patmos turned around
[49:34] and seen Jesus sitting there to look
[49:37] upon as a rainbow his sardis and jasper
[49:41] stones which was Reuben and Benjamin and
[49:43] the first and last which he is and which
[49:46] is shall come the root and offspring of
[49:50] David the Morningstar and over him was a
[49:53] rainbow with seven golden candlesticks
[49:57] meaning that he had a covenant for the
[50:00] last seven church ages and when the deep
[50:04] beginning to call to the deep rolled
[50:06] down in my heart I said God Here I am
[50:11] way up here it's supposed to be hunting
[50:13] and I got real happy and I set down my
[50:15] gun and rounding around the tree I win
[50:17] just as shouting as hard as I could
[50:20] somebody come up there they'd have
[50:22] probably put me in an institution for
[50:24] insanity but I was having a glorious
[50:26] time and they can say crazy if they want
[50:31] to don't make me no difference I got my
[50:34] eyes on Calvary and I loved him I
[50:37] worship Him I seen him out there and I
[50:39] said God there you are in the sunset
[50:41] here you are in the rainbow there you
[50:43] are in the wolf over there you are in
[50:45] the elk oh where are you lord and here
[50:48] you are in my heart
[50:50] and I said glory to God around around
[50:53] around around that tree I went again
[50:55] well I was just having a big time just
[50:58] kicking up the brush and everything else
[51:02] God out in the universe God all over the
[51:07] earth and he said in God in me in my
[51:10] heart that's a mystery hidden the
[51:20] message to you 9 time ensign brother
[51:22] branham said fish unites themselves
[51:25] before going before the spring run out
[51:29] in the ocean you can find them what we
[51:32] call Humpy's the salmon and when they
[51:35] come up there before the run comes in
[51:38] you'll see them by the tens of thousands
[51:40] out in the sea coming around the round
[51:43] salt salt water but they're actually
[51:45] freshwater fish
[51:46] and here they come right up that fresh
[51:48] water and they go up for a spawning
[51:51] season and they go up there and spawn
[51:53] about every four years and die as soon
[51:58] as they spawn and you know they're going
[52:00] to die and you couldn't stop them for
[52:03] nothing they'll jump fish ladders and
[52:06] everything else getting up there knowing
[52:09] they're going to their death but the law
[52:11] of nature makes them knowing that they
[52:14] go up there and spawn in the old and die
[52:16] and the young ones come off and
[52:18] something unites them together then and
[52:21] out into the ocean they go
[52:23] it's uniting it's a law you just can't
[52:26] be God's law pardon me I looked it up
[52:47] salmon
[52:49] spend about 3 to 5 years in the ocean
[52:51] until they reach maturity as soon as
[52:55] they reach maturity they come up and
[52:58] gather themselves into the bay and they
[53:03] wait there and wait there and wait for
[53:06] the rain to come for the rain to come
[53:09] and for it to raise the waters levels up
[53:12] and then they start going up the stream
[53:15] I thought about that and I thought you
[53:19] know if we would just stay in the
[53:22] presence of the word as it's being
[53:25] preached and just stay there and keep
[53:27] waiting there be patient God's doing the
[53:33] work and he promised you know what he
[53:35] promised he promised he would finish the
[53:37] good work that he started
[53:42] they fight to get back to where they
[53:46] came from where they respond that they
[53:52] recognize the water in the very place by
[53:54] the sense of smell
[53:56] it's the sense of smell in the water how
[53:59] they know where to go they say that
[54:02] salmon that have been raised in the
[54:05] hatchery and let to go out in the ocean
[54:08] will come back and try to jump into the
[54:11] pipe going back into the hatchery
[54:13] because that's where they came from
[54:17] hallelujah there's a sixth sense that
[54:22] the believer has it's called faith and
[54:26] that's how we know where we came from
[54:28] and where we came from we're going back
[54:32] amen hallelujah God testifying in nature
[54:40] and we're gonna go back and we'll jump
[54:43] through trials and everything else
[54:45] nothing's gonna stop us just like it
[54:47] couldn't stop the salmon there's nothing
[54:49] gonna be able to stop this why it's
[54:51] where we came from the devil's got up
[54:56] his traps and his nets and everything
[54:58] else but you know why we're gonna make
[55:00] it because we're ordained to make
[55:03] [Music]
[55:04] [Applause]
[55:08] hallelujah I looked up and studied about
[55:17] another animal an insect it's called the
[55:21] monarch butterfly and I found them to be
[55:25] quite interesting and they eat from the
[55:33] milkweed plant that's where that they'll
[55:36] lay their eggs on the underside of the
[55:38] leaf of the milkweed plant and when the
[55:42] young hatches first eats the shell which
[55:45] which encased it and then it begins to
[55:51] eat on the milkweed plant and the only
[55:54] thing it does just eat it just keeps
[55:57] eating and you know if if that
[56:03] caterpillar had emotions it would say
[56:06] the only thing that makes us happy is
[56:08] eating eating from that plant that's the
[56:14] only thing that makes us believer happy
[56:16] eating of the Word of God we can't go
[56:19] without it we've got to have it people
[56:27] don't understand you for that people
[56:30] that go to church just to be a church
[56:33] member and say that they're a church
[56:35] member and you know better not the
[56:39] preaching go longer than about 10 to 12
[56:41] minutes 15 at the most I've preached
[56:50] before and and crammed a lot in 15
[56:53] minutes but I'm glad I don't have to go
[56:58] by that timeframe this morning
[57:05] it feeds for about two weeks and
[57:08] develops into a caterpillar about two
[57:09] inches long then after a while that
[57:13] counter pillar attaches itself to a twig
[57:15] there and begins to weave from a gland
[57:20] that's in its mouth it weaves a cocoon
[57:23] around itself until it's completely
[57:28] encased and then it takes about two
[57:33] weeks in about two weeks time you can
[57:36] see through that cocoon that becomes
[57:39] translucent you can see the outline of
[57:42] that butterfly that's formed inside that
[57:44] could come you know what it's waiting
[57:47] for it's waiting for to come forth from
[57:50] that cocoon and when it comes forth its
[57:57] wings are all wet and gooey in that
[57:59] they're kind of plaster down so it
[58:02] begins to pump blood out to those wings
[58:05] and the wings begin to expand and they
[58:10] begin to to dry in the air and then when
[58:15] blood is pumped all through the wings
[58:17] and they've dried in the air then the
[58:19] butterfly can fly but you know there's
[58:23] something that protects it and what
[58:26] protects it is a poison that's inside
[58:31] the milkweed what protects it is it's
[58:35] protected by what it needs and they say
[58:45] it doesn't need any camouflage but
[58:49] instead it has that bright orange color
[58:53] on it the work can be readily seen and
[58:57] that tells the birds and so forth don't
[59:00] touch them
[59:03] that's just something God in nature
[59:08] [Applause]
[59:13] they'll travel for miles
[59:15] some of them travel 1802 miles to from
[59:22] where they were born in this summer to
[59:24] where they're going to winter at and
[59:29] they don't produce in the winter they
[59:34] have to come back and it's the next
[59:37] spring they winter they come and gather
[59:47] about they said in southern Canada and
[59:49] begin to migrate south and some migrate
[59:54] to Mexico and some others migrated to
[59:58] Cuba sums of the Pacific Grove as well
[1:00:03] as California they traveled great miles
[1:00:08] we're traveling on a long journey and
[1:00:12] we're waiting we're waiting as we toured
[1:00:17] it what is it to produce Christ turns me
[1:00:28] to John chapter one
[1:00:45] John chapter 1 verses 12 and 13 brothers
[1:00:51] excuse me you're my mouth's a little dry
[1:00:53] this morning but as many as received him
[1:01:04] to them gave he the power to become the
[1:01:07] sons of God even to them that believe on
[1:01:11] his name which were born not of blood
[1:01:15] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the
[1:01:18] will of man but of God I wrote some
[1:01:25] notes down here to myself it takes grace
[1:01:29] to turn an ugly caterpillar into a
[1:01:32] beautiful butterfly
[1:01:36] everything the caterpillar needs to
[1:01:39] become a butterfly is already in him
[1:01:40] when he's born he just has to eat
[1:01:45] there's not really any beauty about the
[1:01:48] caterpillar you can't look at him and
[1:01:51] imagine that he could possibly change or
[1:01:53] transform into something beautiful if
[1:02:05] the process of transformation of God's
[1:02:08] sons and daughters you might look at
[1:02:10] them in a caterpillar stage and say how
[1:02:13] ugly why these are not perfect they
[1:02:16] shouldn't be happy and shouting why
[1:02:19] they're just ugly caterpillars you're
[1:02:25] right but we're gonna stay in the
[1:02:26] presence of Jehovah
[1:02:29] and keep eating the word and drinking of
[1:02:31] the spirit until one day I'll be even as
[1:02:34] he is I thought about the bride coming
[1:02:44] forth from the Seven Church ages it's
[1:02:47] like a cocoon that has kept the bride
[1:02:51] but brother Branham said now the whole
[1:02:54] bride the bride the part of the bride
[1:02:58] from each age coming together oh there's
[1:03:03] a great uniting that's gonna happen amen
[1:03:08] it's not just us or those from our
[1:03:11] church age that come up in the
[1:03:13] resurrection with the bride from every
[1:03:15] age comes up in the resurrection how to
[1:03:20] loo your that wonderful that's to me to
[1:03:25] fathom that to fathom the resurrection
[1:03:28] to begin with is by faith we take it and
[1:03:31] accept it but then we've heard maybe
[1:03:36] perhaps most of our lives about the
[1:03:39] resurrection and about our loved ones
[1:03:42] coming back but it ain't just them
[1:03:44] Paul's gonna arise too and it's not just
[1:03:52] him all those that believe the word he
[1:03:55] preached they're gonna resurrect to all
[1:03:59] those ones that gave their lives during
[1:04:01] the time of the Dark Ages they're going
[1:04:05] to rise again hallelujah brother Branham
[1:04:11] said the angel told him to each be
[1:04:13] gathered to their own and when they come
[1:04:21] up before the Lord he said will be
[1:04:23] presented first that messenger and said
[1:04:28] if he's accepted then all of those that
[1:04:32] believed his message will be accepted he
[1:04:35] said if he's accepted said which he will
[1:04:37] be
[1:04:39] which he will be and he said there's
[1:04:44] voices that shouted were counting on the
[1:04:48] house
[1:04:49] hallelujah aren't we counting on that
[1:04:52] honey he said will Paul have to come up
[1:04:56] and be presented the same way said yes
[1:04:58] he said well then I preached what Paul
[1:05:00] preached I Tim preached nothing
[1:05:03] different he said then what Paul
[1:05:05] preached amen
[1:05:08] I don't got nothing to preach yourself
[1:05:13] what the Prophet preached hallelujah and
[1:05:19] I'm happy to do it
[1:05:20] oh my I tell you his grace is sufficient
[1:05:24] isn't I think about the grace of God in
[1:05:29] my own life and how did there was times
[1:05:37] like I could have lost my life once over
[1:05:42] in the Gulf I stopped with my foot just
[1:05:44] hovering over a tripwire of of mine and
[1:05:51] I stopped because someone else saw it
[1:05:53] and screamed out my name and I stopped
[1:05:57] mid-step they said don't move I looked
[1:06:02] down there was it was God because that
[1:06:07] individual be able to see because that
[1:06:11] individual was setting up in a truck and
[1:06:16] I was going to ground guiding and he saw
[1:06:19] it from setting up in a truck it was God
[1:06:22] that directed him to see it and call out
[1:06:24] my name
[1:06:27] he said why didn't God direct you to see
[1:06:30] it God wanted me to know that it wasn't
[1:06:32] anything that I could do to save myself
[1:06:36] I was running from the Lord that's why I
[1:06:42] ended up over there I was running from
[1:06:45] God I was running from the call of God
[1:06:47] on my life I didn't want nothing to do
[1:06:50] with it anymore
[1:06:51] I wanted to be free from it but you know
[1:06:57] what you can run as hard as you can when
[1:07:00] God has called you nor danger you'll
[1:07:02] never get away from him you might leave
[1:07:06] and try your best to get away but you
[1:07:09] know what the word that you've said
[1:07:12] under will keep ringing in your ear and
[1:07:17] there's something in your heart that
[1:07:20] never quits pulley and there's a desire
[1:07:25] that you just can't escape and that's a
[1:07:29] desire to actually serve God I remember
[1:07:39] praying when I was over in the Gulf and
[1:07:45] it was like there was a dark sheet had
[1:07:48] dropped down it was like there wasn't no
[1:07:49] God at all no matter what I said when I
[1:07:52] prayed it seemed like there was no God
[1:07:54] that he wasn't hearing me then one day
[1:08:00] when we were crossing the border into
[1:08:02] Iraq I begin to pray in myself sitting
[1:08:07] in the cab of a truck we were pulling
[1:08:12] the command center behind us in this
[1:08:15] truck and there was another young boy
[1:08:19] that worked for me that was driving the
[1:08:21] truck and I began to pray then was in
[1:08:24] myself and I said God if I went too far
[1:08:28] I'm sorry and if I went too far but I'm
[1:08:33] going to go to hell it's because I
[1:08:34] deserve it it's not because of you I
[1:08:36] still love you and I said but even if I
[1:08:42] went too far
[1:08:43] if you just spare me why I can go back
[1:08:45] and get my kids in church I'll do it
[1:08:49] even if I've got to do it and knowing
[1:08:53] that in the end I won't wake it and then
[1:08:57] I ask God I said Lord I know I'm here
[1:09:02] because I was running from me and I said
[1:09:04] so don't let none of these boys and
[1:09:06] women and men that's with me don't let
[1:09:08] none of them lose their life not one of
[1:09:12] them it was we lost her life when I said
[1:09:21] that the presence of God is held down
[1:09:24] into the cab of that truck young man
[1:09:28] that was driving a truck looked at me
[1:09:30] and he said what is that I sense the
[1:09:36] presence of God I said I've been running
[1:09:39] from God
[1:09:40] I said now he's answered my prayer he
[1:09:42] said he started crying
[1:09:44] he said I'm a Pentecostal boy from
[1:09:47] Kentucky and he said I've been running
[1:09:49] from God to things that I wanted to get
[1:09:53] right so he got right sitting in the cab
[1:09:55] of that truck His grace is sufficient
[1:10:22] and the message is super signed brother
[1:10:25] Branham said when God gave the sign this
[1:10:28] will be a sign God will be dwelling in
[1:10:30] flesh you knew that would attract the
[1:10:34] people it did for as many as received
[1:10:36] him to them gave me the power to become
[1:10:39] sons of God and it's supposed to attract
[1:10:43] the evening light people when the same
[1:10:46] light shows God and Christ are one Peter
[1:10:52] said let it be known unto you that God's
[1:10:55] made the same Jesus whom you crucified
[1:10:57] both Lord and Christ
[1:11:01] a sign evil spoken of but the evening
[1:11:04] light is here there's something that has
[1:11:10] attracted us in this day and you know
[1:11:17] there could be many that some we would
[1:11:21] come in contact with sometimes even
[1:11:23] family members they would look and say
[1:11:27] well you're in a cold but I'm not
[1:11:35] following a man I'm following the
[1:11:39] message and God had brother and said God
[1:11:46] could have chosen any way that he wanted
[1:11:49] for the word to be delivered he could
[1:11:53] have chosen the Stars he could have
[1:11:55] chosen the son of the moon said but he
[1:11:57] didn't he chose man and I believe that's
[1:12:01] one thing that all people all word they
[1:12:03] just can agree upon God chose man to do
[1:12:06] it and I believe that we received a
[1:12:13] prophet in this last in time and I
[1:12:23] believe that the message has gathered
[1:12:25] the people the evening light people
[1:12:29] brother BAM call us I'm a mess of
[1:12:36] perfection he said now he knows you he
[1:12:39] knows every one of you he knows just
[1:12:42] what you're desiring as many as received
[1:12:45] him to them gave he the power to become
[1:12:48] sons and daughters of God hallelujah
[1:12:56] who did he give the power to to us to
[1:13:05] become sons and daughters of God do you
[1:13:10] know what we had to be born
[1:13:14] sons and daughters of law to become sons
[1:13:18] and daughters of God the message of
[1:13:29] mighty God and build he said but when he
[1:13:33] come Express exactly like the Testament
[1:13:36] said he would be expressed then all
[1:13:40] those who was redeemable believed it
[1:13:43] because they were thoughts of God the
[1:13:47] attributes of him at the beginning was
[1:13:49] made flesh and redeemable and was
[1:13:51] brought back to guard as many as
[1:13:54] received him to them gave he the power
[1:13:56] to become sons of God because they were
[1:13:59] redeemable they were from the beginning
[1:14:02] in the expression I often think about
[1:14:08] the woman at the well who was a
[1:14:10] Samaritan and I like the way jesus said
[1:14:17] I have need to go by Samaria he told his
[1:14:23] disciples I have need to go by Samaria
[1:14:28] I'm glad yet need to go by where I was
[1:14:35] I'm glad he yet need to go by where I
[1:14:38] was you god bless you brother crest I
[1:14:42] was thinking about you on Thursday
[1:14:44] we certain a song then Jesus came and
[1:14:46] every time I sing that song makes me
[1:14:48] think about you brother really crest me
[1:14:51] y'all maybe you don't know him as long
[1:14:54] as I've known him you just sing that
[1:14:55] song and nobody could sing it like he
[1:14:58] did power of God redeemable that woman
[1:15:06] that the well was a redeemable thought
[1:15:09] of God
[1:15:12] brother branham said in the back part of
[1:15:15] god's mind he had some thoughts and he
[1:15:21] says and those thoughts were expressed
[1:15:24] and became flesh here on earth and those
[1:15:28] thought because they were in his mind
[1:15:31] from the beginning they're redeemable
[1:15:34] redeemable thoughts of God and every one
[1:15:39] of them will be redeemed no man can come
[1:15:53] to me he says except the father draws
[1:15:57] him and all the father have past tense
[1:16:01] given to me will come to me to the word
[1:16:05] how can they come unless they were
[1:16:09] ordained to come as many as received him
[1:16:13] to them gave you the power to become
[1:16:15] sons of God see because their names were
[1:16:19] on the book he come to redeem that that
[1:16:22] was on the book think about that our
[1:16:26] names were on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:16:30] before the foundation of the world think
[1:16:36] about that before your mom and dad
[1:16:40] before your grandparents before your
[1:16:42] great-grandparents before your
[1:16:44] great-great grandparents before any of
[1:16:46] your ancestors before any of mankind
[1:16:48] ever came on this earth before there
[1:16:51] wasn't earth before there was a son
[1:16:54] before there was anything when there was
[1:16:57] nothing but God
[1:16:59] [Applause]
[1:17:01] your names were written on the Lamb's
[1:17:05] Book of Life it wasn't at some time
[1:17:11] later on that our names came on there it
[1:17:14] wasn't that God looked down and said
[1:17:16] well I think I liked this individual
[1:17:18] pretty much I think I'll put his name on
[1:17:20] there no you were thoughts of God we
[1:17:23] were already in the mind of God when
[1:17:26] there was nothing that exists but God
[1:17:28] before there angels to worship God even
[1:17:31] brother man said before there was angels
[1:17:33] he wasn't even God he was just a self
[1:17:36] existing one so even before he was God
[1:17:39] your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:17:42] [Applause]
[1:17:48] praise be to God you couldn't help
[1:17:54] become and there was nothing gonna keep
[1:18:00] you from the pure truth the common
[1:18:17] people heard him gladly says in the
[1:18:19] message of Christ the common people
[1:18:23] heard him gladly and as many as came to
[1:18:25] him to them gave he the power to become
[1:18:28] sons and daughters of God in glory
[1:18:31] tonight anchored away until a day of
[1:18:34] complete Redemption the body being
[1:18:36] raised again or the body change I don't
[1:18:46] know about you but I have a fight every
[1:18:49] day with this old flesh I would think by
[1:18:58] now maybe I could have had this old boy
[1:18:59] conquered
[1:19:01] but then I realized the only way you're
[1:19:04] ever going to conquer this flesh is to
[1:19:06] kill it and one day the I thought about
[1:19:16] in the garden how that when Jesus cursed
[1:19:22] the serpent he said on your belly shot
[1:19:26] that crawl and the dust shall you eat
[1:19:29] all the days of your life before the de
[1:19:33] serpent became something that slid it on
[1:19:36] the ground he walked on two legs
[1:19:39] he was a closest thing to man so what
[1:19:47] changed him how did he change it wasn't
[1:19:51] magic but because God spoke the word you
[1:20:00] know we're all made up of molecules and
[1:20:02] atoms and what they call everything has
[1:20:06] a molecular structure this desk has a
[1:20:12] molecular structure that makes it solid
[1:20:17] water has a molecular structure that
[1:20:20] makes it liquid and I thought what
[1:20:24] changed the serpent to be like a snake
[1:20:28] by the spoken word of God the molecular
[1:20:31] structure of that serpent changed if God
[1:20:41] by the spoken word could change the
[1:20:43] Serpent's molecular structure then
[1:20:48] there's something wrong with our
[1:20:50] molecular structure because we weren't
[1:20:52] created to be sick we weren't created to
[1:20:55] grow old we weren't created to die
[1:21:00] God created us to live so all it's going
[1:21:09] to be is a spoken word of God that will
[1:21:11] change this molecular structure which
[1:21:14] we're walking around in now and it'll be
[1:21:17] a new body I'm looking forward to that
[1:21:20] new body I have dreams from time to time
[1:21:24] about getting a new body and there's one
[1:21:28] thing I always remember about every
[1:21:30] dream that new body had hair one of
[1:21:41] these days it's going to be there again
[1:21:42] brother Brown said he never lost the one
[1:21:44] of them I heard somebody criticized
[1:21:53] brother Branham over that I said well
[1:21:58] then why if he never lost the one why
[1:22:00] was he bald well all the hairs still
[1:22:05] there is just something happened that
[1:22:08] makes it worry it won't it won't grow
[1:22:11] and stay it'll break off as it grows
[1:22:15] that's the truth you ask any brother
[1:22:22] that's lost his hair if his head looks
[1:22:25] slick on top that's cause he shaves it
[1:22:37] that's the truth the hair is still there
[1:22:41] under the skin it just won't grow but
[1:22:45] one day it's going to be there again I
[1:22:49] don't get me wrong it ain't just hair
[1:22:51] I'm looking forward to
[1:22:58] as I got older I get aches and pains I
[1:23:05] never had before
[1:23:07] there's things I look around I see young
[1:23:10] men in their teens or early 20s and I
[1:23:16] see things they do and I know I can't do
[1:23:18] it anymore
[1:23:21] nice to go out and play ball and play
[1:23:24] football and all that play tackle Lord I
[1:23:28] wouldn't want to play tackle today I
[1:23:32] went out and I tried to play baseball
[1:23:35] with some young people I limped around
[1:23:40] for three weeks I pulled something I
[1:23:46] don't even know what it was
[1:23:52] this body hurts and it's dying everyday
[1:24:00] you know we've got loved ones just went
[1:24:03] on by the way the grave and we're
[1:24:04] looking forward we know where they are
[1:24:06] and we we can take the Bible says
[1:24:10] comfort one another with these words
[1:24:14] and we can take comfort from that
[1:24:17] knowing where they are and knowing
[1:24:19] there's going to be a resurrection but
[1:24:23] we got loved ones are still here and if
[1:24:26] we were asked to be honest say are we
[1:24:30] ready for them to go on and we want them
[1:24:32] to stay we'd say we want them to stay
[1:24:36] well somebody's got to be alive and
[1:24:40] remaining when the rapture takes place
[1:24:43] we can't all go by the way of the grade
[1:24:46] somebody's got to be here because that
[1:24:49] part to God's words got to be fulfilled
[1:24:51] as well and so I hate to watch my loved
[1:25:02] ones grow older I know I'm getting older
[1:25:06] as I get older they get older and I look
[1:25:12] and I see the signs things that happens
[1:25:15] to him because they're growing old and I
[1:25:20] wish they didn't have to grow whole
[1:25:24] Samuels
[1:25:26] little boy the other day said my mom's
[1:25:30] not looking old is she
[1:25:44] oh I tell you when I got memories that I
[1:25:49] don't want
[1:25:50] I got memories I can't get rid of and
[1:25:57] they haunt me from time to time I know
[1:26:00] what it is Satan can get around in that
[1:26:03] realm and try to cause trouble and he'll
[1:26:07] bring up things from your memory so
[1:26:10] remember when you're done this remember
[1:26:11] when you did that and it'll haunt you
[1:26:17] but one day I'm gonna receive a new mind
[1:26:24] and the memory of sin the memory of sins
[1:26:28] want to be wiped away I hate to talk to
[1:26:42] maybe my loved ones not making it but I
[1:26:50] know when I get a new memory I'll never
[1:26:51] remember them as that only ones I have
[1:26:56] memory are the ones that did make it cuz
[1:27:02] Heaven's not going to be a sorrowful
[1:27:04] place where the RAM said in one place
[1:27:11] that we first get there we'll look
[1:27:12] around and we'll see what's on so it
[1:27:16] didn't make it or so and so didn't make
[1:27:18] it you said but then he'll come around
[1:27:20] and wipe our memories clean yeah and
[1:27:24] when we remember it anymore there's not
[1:27:30] going to be no tears no sorrow I was
[1:27:36] thinking this morning I asked my mom I
[1:27:39] said you think dad's made it around to
[1:27:43] everybody he knew yet
[1:27:46] as we were talking about so many that we
[1:27:48] had known that's went on to see the Lord
[1:27:52] some you don't know him it's some of you
[1:27:54] here this morning with no I brought
[1:27:56] mentioned in my mom about brother
[1:27:58] Hankins
[1:27:59] and he's done went on to be with the
[1:28:02] Lord and we got to just mention about
[1:28:07] different ones we've been talking about
[1:28:09] it since my dad passed mom showed me a
[1:28:13] picture the other day it was brother
[1:28:14] Miranda and my dads together at a fellow
[1:28:17] shoot I thought they're together again
[1:28:22] and you know what they're not feeling
[1:28:25] any sorrow because they've left us here
[1:28:30] they don't know any sorrow but they're
[1:28:37] waiting they got maybe more that they'll
[1:28:41] greet on that side before the rapture
[1:28:44] takes place but they're waiting on the
[1:28:48] resurrection just as much as you are
[1:28:52] they know where they are and they know
[1:28:56] that there's coming a resurrection and
[1:29:00] they know that they'll be reunited with
[1:29:03] their loved ones here but they know it
[1:29:07] in a greater way than what we can know
[1:29:09] it being here on this side I believe
[1:29:13] that it's even greater identified Christ
[1:29:33] of all ages for the Benham says but the
[1:29:35] Word was made manifest as many as
[1:29:38] received him to him them gave me the
[1:29:40] power to become sons of God and so it is
[1:29:44] today when we see this great Holy Ghost
[1:29:47] move made manifest as many as received
[1:29:51] him to them gave me the power to become
[1:29:53] sons and daughters of God Christ
[1:29:57] identified the same by his
[1:29:59] in every generation how do we know that
[1:30:05] gods in our mist by the manifestation of
[1:30:13] the word as it's transforming you and I
[1:30:19] we're being transformed by the renewing
[1:30:23] of our minds we're being changed and it
[1:30:35] started on the inside and it's working
[1:30:40] its way and working its way and working
[1:30:42] its way we look in the mirror and we see
[1:30:50] what living in this falling condition it
[1:30:55] does to us but we're being transformed
[1:31:03] we're changing inside and one day the
[1:31:08] outside is going to change to match the
[1:31:11] inside I like brother Branham said God
[1:31:21] took a picture of us when before the
[1:31:26] foundation of the world think about that
[1:31:32] before sin had ever touched us before
[1:31:38] sickness had ever touched us before age
[1:31:41] had ever touched us and he says this
[1:31:46] life is just the negative and to get the
[1:31:53] picture you got to develop the negative
[1:31:58] but we're going to go back to be exactly
[1:32:01] like that picture God took of us before
[1:32:05] the beginning hallelujah do you know
[1:32:11] what that means the body that we'll be
[1:32:17] in then will have never known sin well
[1:32:25] they've never known sin I look forward
[1:32:30] to that I look forward to that to be
[1:32:38] manifest in a body that has never known
[1:32:41] sin I heard minister say many times one
[1:32:53] minister said he said I want to be there
[1:32:56] when the Lord kicks the devil in the pit
[1:32:59] and I thought I want to be right there
[1:33:02] with you I want to be part of that too
[1:33:08] I saw my son beginning when they crown
[1:33:12] him Lord of all I'll be there well I
[1:33:15] want to be there also when he kicks the
[1:33:18] devil into the pit at the end of the
[1:33:20] millennium why because that old boy
[1:33:25] heads gave me a lot of problems there's
[1:33:38] been a change in there's been a change
[1:33:41] in you you know what I know you're glad
[1:33:46] you're not who you used to be
[1:33:52] never glorify that old man I've seen
[1:33:59] people talk about someone's grandfather
[1:34:03] until in their eyes they became
[1:34:06] glorified and they talked about the old
[1:34:09] man before he became to serve the Lord
[1:34:12] I've become glorified in the eyes of the
[1:34:15] grandson he said I'd like I'd like to
[1:34:23] know him when he was like that he
[1:34:27] wouldn't he that grandfather wouldn't
[1:34:29] want him to be known that way this and
[1:34:36] everything we say and do let's give God
[1:34:37] glory
[1:34:38] let's tell let's tell our loved ones
[1:34:41] that are here with us let's tell our
[1:34:44] children about the change that God's
[1:34:47] wrought in our lives and let's testify
[1:34:53] to them there needs to be a change
[1:34:55] having in them if they're going to make
[1:34:57] this rapture hallelujah he's wonderful I
[1:35:14] see God everything I look at around me
[1:35:23] we see God everywhere show us the father
[1:35:28] and trust this morning that maybe I've
[1:35:35] just brought back to your remembrance
[1:35:36] these things to encourage you it's same
[1:35:40] God that's all around us is in us this
[1:35:47] we talk about the universe and how great
[1:35:50] it is how magnificent Stars hanging in
[1:35:54] space and so on did you know what the
[1:35:59] greatest miracle is
[1:36:01] they say there's a miracle of birth when
[1:36:04] they young when the child is born it's a
[1:36:06] miracle you know what's even a greater
[1:36:09] miracle it's when they're changed when
[1:36:16] they received the change and become
[1:36:18] born-again Christians that is a miracle
[1:36:26] people say where are the miracles that's
[1:36:28] where they're at
[1:36:30] we're being changed I'll tell you what
[1:36:34] friends I want to see all my kids
[1:36:36] changed and enough time Terry's I want
[1:36:39] to see my grandchildren come to serve
[1:36:42] the Lord and I keep before my
[1:36:47] grandchildren I keep before them the
[1:36:50] things of the Lord I'd like to see them
[1:36:53] rejoice in church
[1:36:55] I know Samuel I can't preach without
[1:37:01] mention grandchildren one time or two
[1:37:03] Sam used to always tease me about it
[1:37:07] y'all know brother David you know his
[1:37:11] son Michael well Michael gets out and
[1:37:14] dances just like David does he gets up
[1:37:18] on the table of the coffee table at home
[1:37:20] stands up there and he gets older
[1:37:22] something that he pretends as a
[1:37:24] microphone and he'll just talk and
[1:37:27] talking talking talking I say he's
[1:37:29] testifying
[1:37:31] he'll just talking talking talking there
[1:37:33] and then then he'll start singing a song
[1:37:37] he does exactly what he's seen his daddy
[1:37:39] do brother David can't get up and sing
[1:37:42] with that first testifies and I think
[1:37:47] that's wonderful because God has changed
[1:37:50] brother David in such a way that that's
[1:37:56] the reflection that he's having on his
[1:37:58] son that's the example that's being laid
[1:38:01] down
[1:38:04] you know if you take and put them under
[1:38:06] the atmosphere of the world you'll see
[1:38:09] that begin to reflect on them but keep
[1:38:13] them under the atmosphere of God
[1:38:16] I remember Sammy and I was talking about
[1:38:24] this the other day I remember staying at
[1:38:26] my grandmother Browning's house and we
[1:38:32] would we'd pray a couple of times a day
[1:38:35] she'd had prayer and when it was time to
[1:38:39] pray why I had to get down to she made
[1:38:44] sure I coming in the room and got down
[1:38:45] to pray too and I remember thinking just
[1:38:49] a young boy
[1:38:50] how much longer is she gonna be praying
[1:38:52] I remember when I got a little older I
[1:38:59] was out mowing their lawn one time and I
[1:39:04] was a teenager and I was I hadn't
[1:39:06] dedicated my life to God and I came in
[1:39:10] walked in through the utility room and
[1:39:14] when I walked in there I heard her call
[1:39:15] out my name in prayer but I slipped on
[1:39:19] back out the door but I never forgot it
[1:39:22] I was raised in there Chris Christian
[1:39:34] atmosphere the Bible says raise a child
[1:39:39] in the way she should go when it's old
[1:39:41] you know not the part where as a
[1:39:47] teenager I had to have my own experience
[1:39:49] just like mom and dad had I had to have
[1:39:52] my own experience with God and in the
[1:39:56] right time it's season idea how does the

[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:12] don't you're loving this morning
[2:00:16] appreciate the word of the Lord let's
[2:00:22] just thinking Alleluia you know that
[2:00:26] that that butterfly if it had a voice as
[2:00:30] far as why you and I have a voice you
[2:00:33] would thank God for that milkweed it
[2:00:37] would thank God for the points in it but
[2:00:40] you know it does have a voice its voice
[2:00:43] is not like how you and I would say
[2:00:45] words but it has a voice that is a
[2:00:48] greater voice than even words it has a
[2:00:51] voice that expresses the mystery that's
[2:00:53] in the milk thistle plant through its
[2:00:57] life because this is not the blood of
[2:01:00] Abel that says you're guilty you're
[2:01:03] guilty you're guilty
[2:01:04] this blood as the Prophet said in a
[2:01:07] message talking this blood he said you
[2:01:09] all came it can change
[2:01:14] Abel's blood can only point out the
[2:01:16] wrong but the blood of Jesus Christ can
[2:01:19] say cane I can change you sure is out
[2:01:23] getting change King because he released
[2:01:25] his Abel on the inside and Abel on the
[2:01:28] inside brings Cain subject to the word
[2:01:31] greater is He that is in you this is the
[2:01:36] blood of Jesus speaking better things
[2:01:39] even through our life were living day by
[2:01:41] day his prophesy we're seeking a city
[2:01:45] whose builder and maker is gone because
[2:01:49] we've already met the king and priest of
[2:01:52] that city a man the prophet of that city
[2:01:56] I'm not Catholic
[2:01:57] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ is
[2:02:00] amen amen the angel of the Lord the Holy
[2:02:02] Spirit Christ Himself moving in our
[2:02:06] midst to draw us into that place and
[2:02:09] give us what we need to cross oh my what
[2:02:15] a blessed moment where we are standing
[2:02:17] in the brink of time right now thank God
[2:02:22] for His grace
[2:02:24] the only thing that we see the
[2:02:26] admonition we look at those things at
[2:02:28] times we can look at the things in
[2:02:29] nature look at nobody told him it's like
[2:02:32] the trapdoor spider and those things you
[2:02:33] know sometimes I I've seen a little
[2:02:35] moody films I I still looking back from
[2:02:38] what we're back from the 67 I still look
[2:02:40] at how those left there with amazement
[2:02:41] each time and I say you know nobody
[2:02:44] thought this this baby trapdoor spider
[2:02:46] nobody taught it that when it hatches
[2:02:49] eat eat that you know or even that Walsh
[2:02:52] Meleager that one got to remember the
[2:02:53] trapdoor spider part but nobody would
[2:02:55] that teaches that that that wasp when it
[2:02:58] and he hatches to start eating the
[2:03:00] tranche Allah that its mother killed and
[2:03:02] put there in the ground nobody has to
[2:03:05] tell it start eating this it knows when
[2:03:07] it's born
[2:03:09] that's the same thing with houses
[2:03:11] children of God the Word of God it just
[2:03:14] rings in our hearts we don't know the
[2:03:17] full depths of it we don't know that but
[2:03:19] one more as we're feasting on it we're
[2:03:21] we're drawing in the strength and what
[2:03:23] we're drawing in is it's like an
[2:03:27] invisible substance it doesn't have that
[2:03:29] color but inside of us it brings forth
[2:03:32] the color that is in that substance I
[2:03:36] thought of that when the Spirit of God
[2:03:37] was bringing that out this morning I
[2:03:39] thought of revelations 9 oh I love that
[2:03:42] chapter you say how can you love that
[2:03:44] chapter it talks about those there's all
[2:03:46] those that the bit being loosen and all
[2:03:48] those demon spirits and everything and
[2:03:50] that tells like scorpions because the
[2:03:52] beginning of the next chapter
[2:03:54] revelations 10 verse 1 says and I saw
[2:04:01] and means I'm not finished I have
[2:04:06] something that comes beyond this or how
[2:04:11] we're thankful to the Lord because those
[2:04:14] spirits they could touch everything else
[2:04:16] in the earth but it says don't you touch
[2:04:17] anything that is green well has the seal
[2:04:20] of God in the forehead are we thankful
[2:04:23] for the seal of God amen thank God for
[2:04:26] the sealing angel God came and the man
[2:04:33] clothed in fine linen oh we thank God
[2:04:36] this morning don't you just love him
[2:04:38] say law justice just as that butterflies
[2:04:41] but the jury was just moving by
[2:04:43] inspiration that salmon and all of those
[2:04:46] other things like even the earth to
[2:04:48] think of it it's not a hill they're like
[2:04:50] the models we have in our science class
[2:04:52] you know Anna on a transparent string so
[2:04:56] the kids are able to see it's standing
[2:05:01] [Music]
[2:05:04] to recognize at all all of creation all
[2:05:08] of those things they're doing what is
[2:05:11] within them they yield to it
[2:05:13] and what does it do you see there's
[2:05:19] another trapdoor spider
[2:05:22] [Music]
[2:05:24] you see because one that's seen the
[2:05:27] image in that same light he keeps
[2:05:28] bringing forms here we stand 2,000 years
[2:05:32] later after Calvary about same life
[2:05:36] being reflected in his children a month
[2:05:42] what must we do feed let's just feed on
[2:05:46] the word because within that word is a
[2:05:49] transforming power
[2:05:53] amen it won't be overnight but there is
[2:05:57] coming a day in a twinkling of an eye
[2:06:00] but you see well sometimes we get in
[2:06:03] that one God is moving times you don't
[2:06:10] always hear it but remember when they
[2:06:13] were constructing that temple there in
[2:06:14] the days of Solomon there one the sound
[2:06:16] of a hammer heard but there was still
[2:06:18] work going on sometimes you don't hear
[2:06:21] sound sometimes you do hear sound but in
[2:06:23] it all God is working in it just
[2:06:26] wonderful to see his grace to sense his
[2:06:31] moving in our life and says from my
[2:06:33] harnason Lord I want to be more
[2:06:35] sensitive more surrendering
[2:06:39] I believe the word does that for us I
[2:06:41] can't listen to a message I can't read
[2:06:44] in the scripture I can't come to the
[2:06:45] house of God without it coming to that
[2:06:47] place and say Lord I want to be more
[2:06:48] surrendered it challenges us this word
[2:06:51] reaches to the depth of our life let's
[2:06:56] pray let's give him thanks before we
[2:07:00] move into a praying asking for his grace
[2:07:04] to go with us let's just let's take a
[2:07:06] few moments and let's just Thank You
