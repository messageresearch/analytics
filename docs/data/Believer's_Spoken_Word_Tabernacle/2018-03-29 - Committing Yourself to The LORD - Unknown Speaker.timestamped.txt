[29:19] [Music]
[29:31] Hey
[29:34] I believe that tonight that's our
[29:45] confession has done and made known to
[29:51] our hearts what a what a blessed
[29:54] privilege it is and reality within our
[29:57] hearts know that we serve it's not just
[30:02] something that you know it's known
[30:04] because that in itself is not anything
[30:07] that just by words can be proven but it
[30:12] is that which God Himself comes and
[30:15] prove that he indeed is alive in that
[30:21] wonderful that brings that brings the
[30:23] real comfort and confidence in our
[30:25] hearts and our lives in the word of the
[30:27] Lord we just want to ask you to stand
[30:30] with us and we want to go right into the
[30:32] word totally good to be good to be back
[30:36] home with you and I certainly say I just
[30:39] appreciate the prayers Wow who has gone
[30:42] there with the saints that are there in
[30:44] Connecticut just ask you just continue
[30:47] to keep them in prayer that the Lord
[30:49] would just open the door for whom he has
[30:54] stand-in there as a pastor and we just
[30:57] the Lord just led us on a channel with
[31:00] some things that we spoke on there and
[31:02] the Lord just just richly just so
[31:06] wonderful see God just come behind his
[31:09] word and moving I just bring confidence
[31:11] to the hearts of the people and you know
[31:13] God knows exactly he knows what he's
[31:16] doing so we we just thank the Lord for
[31:19] that and still just have received even a
[31:22] testimony the other night from the
[31:24] services there and so we just thank God
[31:26] we know that all we can do is be vessels
[31:29] but it's in God's hands God comes and he
[31:32] moves through his word to minister to
[31:34] our heart
[31:35] you're loving tonight amen
[31:38] let's look here in the scriptures in 1st
[31:40] Peter chapter 2
[31:47] and we want to just read a few verses of
[31:50] Scripture here
[31:57] verse 13 a little bit of a longer
[32:01] passage reading here but in verse 13 of
[32:04] first Peter chapter 2 submit yourselves
[32:09] to every ordinance of man for the lord's
[32:13] sake whether it be to the king as
[32:16] supreme or unto Governors has unto them
[32:21] that are sent by him for the punishment
[32:23] of evildoers and for the praise of them
[32:27] that do well for so is the will of God
[32:31] that with well doing you may put to
[32:34] silence the ignorance of foolish men as
[32:38] free and not using your liberty for a
[32:42] cloak of maliciousness but as the
[32:45] servants of God so when you look at this
[32:49] here in the scripture and verse 16 think
[32:52] of this of how that even when the
[32:55] disciples were brought and there in the
[32:59] very beginning of the book of Acts and
[33:01] they had or they had posed the question
[33:03] to the council there should we obey
[33:08] God's words or your words they were not
[33:12] being arrogant and neither were they
[33:15] taking and using their liberty for a
[33:18] cloak of maliciousness so what Peter is
[33:21] dealing with here by the Spirit of God
[33:23] is is that where that the Liberty of God
[33:27] that is set us free is not in a manner
[33:30] to say I don't have to do that because
[33:32] I'm a Christian and we're not talking
[33:35] about when things infringe upon that
[33:37] within the word but we even look at
[33:40] things that where you have your bosses
[33:42] you have your kings you have different
[33:43] ones and there are requests that are
[33:45] made sometimes even in the workplace and
[33:48] different things that you look at and
[33:50] you think that's unreasonable with me
[33:56] but here Peters saying don't use your
[33:59] liberty for a cloak of maliciousness
[34:02] another that you don't have to move
[34:06] along with that but he rather he says
[34:09] honor all men love the Brotherhood fear
[34:13] God honor the king servants be subject
[34:18] to your masters with all fear not only
[34:21] to the good and gentle but also to the
[34:24] froward it's easy when it's to the good
[34:27] in general but the froward this is where
[34:31] the trial of faith comes for this is
[34:38] think worthy if a man for conscience
[34:41] toward God endure grief suffering wrong
[34:46] for what glory is that if when you be
[34:49] buffeted for your faults you shall take
[34:52] it patiently but if when you do well and
[34:56] suffer for it you take it patiently this
[34:59] is acceptable with God right here in
[35:03] this scripture there's a lot of
[35:04] suffering that we that can be done that
[35:07] is not even anything that is actually
[35:10] the perfecting or the molding of our
[35:12] faith but we can still learn from even
[35:15] things that we and ourselves would bring
[35:18] on ourselves you with me it's not this
[35:23] is the things it's it's easy for us to
[35:25] look at that and say well you know take
[35:28] patiently for my for my faults but yet
[35:31] if you do well and suffer for it you
[35:33] take it patiently this is acceptable
[35:35] with God for even hereunto were he
[35:40] called because Christ also suffered for
[35:44] us leaving us an example that ye should
[35:48] follow his footsteps who did no sin
[35:52] neither was guile found in his mouth who
[35:56] when he was reviled reviled not again
[36:00] when he suffered he threatened not
[36:03] but committed himself to him that
[36:06] judgeth righteously who his own self
[36:10] bare our sins in his own body on the
[36:12] tree that we being dead to sins should
[36:16] live unto righteousness by whose stripes
[36:19] you were healed for ye were as sheep
[36:22] going astray but are now returned unto
[36:26] the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls
[36:30] let's just let's bow our heads in a word
[36:33] of Prayer
[36:34] Heavenly Father Lord as we just Lord
[36:38] arrive and come to this place Lord in
[36:41] the service dear God we're just looking
[36:44] to you tonight that you would just lord
[36:47] help us Lord to together collectively be
[36:50] able to move out of the way and Lord
[36:52] that you would come and speak to us Lord
[36:55] our hearts Lord minister to Lord our
[36:58] needs tonight father Lord we give
[37:00] ourselves to you and that you would have
[37:03] your way among us in the name of Jesus
[37:05] Christ amen amen god bless you may be
[37:08] seated
[37:09] man it's good to have ones with you I
[37:13] know brother Kadima text me today
[37:17] knowing that that he's back and we just
[37:21] asked that God will give him strength
[37:23] within his within his body and from the
[37:26] flight and everything that is there
[37:31] where he's been and traveling and all
[37:34] the events that's taking place and just
[37:36] continuing to keep them in prayer and
[37:39] say it's good Carlos and mr. Herman
[37:45] we're gonna make it by God's grace
[37:48] through this flu season we're gonna make
[37:50] it through this flu season don't shake
[37:52] my hand but we're gonna make it have
[37:57] like walk walk through any bacterial
[37:59] mist when we come in the door you know
[38:01] and like a relaxing like security
[38:03] blankets you know so we were just so
[38:07] thankful to God for His mercy and I just
[38:09] want to take a thought here tonight and
[38:12] look at this thought for a few moments
[38:15] on committing yourself
[38:17] to the Lord and this this very word out
[38:21] of that scripture verse 23 where it
[38:24] speaks from verse 21
[38:26] even through verse 25 of what the Spirit
[38:29] of God even in those previous scriptures
[38:31] have spoke of that it lets us know that
[38:34] what is being called for that this same
[38:38] life in that dwelt within the body of
[38:41] Jesus Christ that it has within it the
[38:45] apps' the ability and the strength that
[38:49] we can live this kind of a surrendered
[38:52] life and this is example you know many
[38:55] times when things that take place when
[38:57] they're going to come out with a new
[38:58] model of a vehicle or whatever more they
[39:01] have what they call a prototype and
[39:03] prototypes they're really not real there
[39:06] are things that you look at them they
[39:08] look nice and sometimes they you know
[39:10] they fit them on a certain scale and
[39:12] then they'll make them bigger and larger
[39:13] but they're only all they are is just to
[39:16] be able to look at it but the Lord Jesus
[39:18] Christ was not a prototype it was God
[39:23] come down and dwell among us take upon a
[39:26] body made in the likeness of sinful
[39:29] flesh just as you and I dwell and walk
[39:32] in this mortality and he showed and
[39:35] demonstrated and was an example to us of
[39:38] what a son and daughter of God is to be
[39:41] in God and so when we look at that this
[39:45] is a confidence that we can have it's
[39:47] not the confidence of our own ability
[39:50] but it's the confidence that is in him
[39:52] and the confidence of an inward work
[39:54] that what not only he has done but what
[39:57] is continually being unfolded in our
[39:59] life a committal itself is not something
[40:02] that in any way that I would even
[40:05] venture to give to you that it is
[40:08] something that is just named and claimed
[40:11] how committal itself is not just
[40:13] something that is just somewhat easily
[40:17] done but a committal itself is where
[40:19] there is a real a surrender to Almighty
[40:24] God even in every situation and
[40:26] sometimes that committal it takes us
[40:29] time of praying and
[40:31] really recognizing what the real battle
[40:34] is and that's things that it's that we
[40:38] need the help of the Holy Spirit in
[40:40] looking at this because we are always
[40:42] approached the enemy is constantly
[40:45] approaching us on every side the Bible
[40:48] says he is a roaring lion roaming to and
[40:52] fro seeking whom he may devour so he's
[40:55] constantly he's constantly as brother
[40:58] BAM will tell us in the message contest
[40:59] he's constantly studying of even how
[41:02] that we would handle that word and so we
[41:06] don't want to focus upon that our
[41:09] victory over the enemy is the victory of
[41:12] Christ in our lives and it is with that
[41:16] continual committal of our own lives
[41:19] unto Him now you think of this here when
[41:21] any of you have ever been in any type of
[41:23] a Mabius procedure a surgery and maybe
[41:26] you haven't but at least you could even
[41:28] relate to this that when you come into
[41:31] that place to even commit to have such a
[41:35] procedure or whatever more you have to
[41:38] be at at rest or to where that you are
[41:41] at that place to be able to relinquish
[41:43] yourself into the hands of that surgeon
[41:46] or that individual for them to be able
[41:48] to perform the task and you know I want
[41:51] you to think of this there they they
[41:53] know even as you're coming into some of
[41:56] those procedures you know they can come
[41:57] in and they'll talk to you and they'll
[41:59] go through all of those extra lengths
[42:01] the doctor in itself doesn't necessarily
[42:03] have to come in and see you before he's
[42:05] gonna operate on you and open you up but
[42:08] what he does has come in and he's
[42:10] talking with you
[42:11] many times they'll have the bedside
[42:13] manner they'll just Pat you on the on
[42:15] the hand they can tell you no and they
[42:18] can ask a person are you nervous no no
[42:20] I'm not nervous I'm fine I'm totally
[42:21] calm
[42:22] I mean they they'll know that and so
[42:23] they come in their objective is to try
[42:26] to settle you as much as as much as what
[42:29] they can and then there's things that's
[42:31] going to be given that will actually
[42:32] help you and calm you down and then we
[42:35] know even when it comes to if it's
[42:37] necessary for an anesthesia all of that
[42:40] to take place in order for them to
[42:42] perform what needs to be done and I
[42:44] sell you this tonight that God has not
[42:47] left it to you and I for us to rely upon
[42:49] our own strength or our own abilities to
[42:52] be able to bring ourselves to a
[42:54] committal but he himself knows exactly
[42:57] how to move touch our lives speak to our
[43:00] hearts to where that we ourselves are
[43:02] relaxing in his presence to where that
[43:06] he can move and perform his word in our
[43:09] lives that is that is him that is able
[43:12] to create that atmosphere and that
[43:14] brings our hearts into submission or
[43:17] committal to him so this word committal
[43:20] itself is to give into the hands of
[43:23] another and in the Simonian church age
[43:26] brother Branham he puts it like this he
[43:28] says the very character of Jesus was
[43:32] perfected by suffering and he goes on to
[43:35] say of how that Paul spoke that he's
[43:38] left the church a measure of suffering
[43:40] that they to by their faith in God while
[43:43] suffering for him would come to a place
[43:47] of perfection and we were looking at
[43:50] this year for some time that this
[43:52] perfection that God is calling for and
[43:55] desires out of our life is not the
[43:58] perfection in the sense that you never
[44:01] make mistakes that is that's the wrong
[44:04] goal but the perfection that begins from
[44:08] within our lives by moving into that
[44:11] perfection of Christ's own life then it
[44:14] is him himself the yielding the
[44:17] submission it never ceases it doesn't
[44:21] stop it continues to move and think
[44:24] about which there with the tenseness of
[44:26] time and the tenseness of life you know
[44:28] it's no Marvel for for a young couple
[44:30] when they are married you know for the
[44:33] the committal and the submission back
[44:35] and forth but let the tools and the
[44:37] tests and the trials of life let the
[44:39] disappointments let discouragement let
[44:41] other thing itself have come at
[44:44] different times and then it becomes a
[44:46] challenge to be able to commit because
[44:48] you have to be able to remove anything
[44:51] that is in between that we're not wanted
[44:54] that would it'll not allow you to be
[44:56] able to commit or
[44:57] submit yourselves to one another and you
[44:59] realize that even with that within a
[45:01] marriage it's not something that is just
[45:04] someone swooping down and removing but
[45:06] there must be the objective and the
[45:08] desire to see this middle wall of
[45:10] partition or to see that which is there
[45:13] dissolved you with me so it requires a
[45:19] continual sacrifice a continuum this is
[45:22] where Paul would say that we are to give
[45:25] our lives as a continual sacrifice unto
[45:29] the Lord this he helps us he brings us
[45:33] into this place of committal he brings
[45:36] us here
[45:38] he's a gentleman is that right
[45:41] he does not force himself he does not
[45:44] demand himself he's a gentleman so he
[45:48] must create the atmosphere that
[45:51] dismantles doubt fear worry dread he
[45:56] must he is the one to provide that is
[45:59] that right the Bible says in Psalms 23
[46:02] regarding the Lord is my shepherd I
[46:03] shall not want
[46:04] he goes through the entirety of the
[46:06] chapter and even into the verse he
[46:08] maketh me to lie down into green
[46:10] pastures that whole verse of scripture
[46:12] deals with the shepherd himself moving
[46:15] and where that there is an environment
[46:17] and an atmosphere where the sheep are at
[46:20] peace with one another and the Sheep are
[46:22] at rest with the Shepherd because he
[46:24] cannot make them lie down force them to
[46:27] but he must create the conditions that
[46:30] they themselves feel safe in order to
[46:33] lay down so it Christ himself it is him
[46:37] that not only is the author the finisher
[46:39] of our faith but even through the whole
[46:41] building it is him working in our lives
[46:44] that we are submitting to him I tell you
[46:46] what that just that just makes me want
[46:48] to shout it makes me just want to want
[46:49] to run because it's him that's working
[46:52] over our lives even for us to even have
[46:55] faith in a promise of God that you might
[46:58] need in your life yet God Himself here
[47:01] is up to him exclusively to create the
[47:04] conditions that are needed in order for
[47:07] those conditions to be met it requires
[47:09] him to come
[47:11] the scene if we could do it we wouldn't
[47:13] need him but we need him to come God's
[47:19] will as the Prophet puts it here God's
[47:21] will for us is perfection and that
[47:24] perfection is is patients which is
[47:27] waiting on God and waiting for God this
[47:32] is the process of character development
[47:36] now you know to think of how God Himself
[47:39] so became one of us to where that God
[47:43] soul subjected himself to take upon a
[47:46] body of flesh that he created to come
[47:49] and dwell in and God would come and walk
[47:51] within that blood that body of flesh we
[47:53] know purpose for redemption but God
[47:56] moved and walked within that body of
[47:58] flesh and that body of flesh through the
[48:01] Lord Jesus he experienced everything
[48:04] that you and I experienced he
[48:07] experienced fear come on somebody he
[48:11] experienced temptation this was not an
[48:15] act that he went through he experienced
[48:17] this now remember God cannot be tempted
[48:21] so God had to so subject himself to take
[48:25] upon a body that he himself could
[48:28] experience what it was like for man to
[48:32] undergo temptation God was never tempted
[48:34] but God through this working in there in
[48:38] the office of his son how that God was
[48:40] able to so move within this that he
[48:43] might understand you and I and that
[48:45] through his glorious character to see
[48:48] the very perfection of the character of
[48:50] the Lord Jesus Christ it was not a gift
[48:54] it was a victory is that right but it
[48:59] was waiting on God and waiting for God
[49:02] he had there was a there was a purpose
[49:07] for him coming to this earth there was a
[49:10] purpose and within that purpose we we
[49:14] recognized that when we look at this
[49:16] statement I think of that the very
[49:18] character of Jesus was perfected by
[49:21] suffering that
[49:24] this perfection that we look at it's a
[49:26] it's a complete submission I want you to
[49:30] think of this this submission when when
[49:32] God identified himself he identified
[49:35] himself as a dove when he identified his
[49:39] sign he identified his son as the lamb
[49:41] is that right one that was one that was
[49:45] of itself helpless in itself is that
[49:48] right
[49:48] Jesus said the son can do nothing in
[49:52] himself but what he seeth the father
[49:54] doing that doeth the son likewise now
[49:59] remember Jesus was pulled to change
[50:03] situations sometimes is that right he
[50:06] was pulled to change the situation there
[50:09] in the time of Lazarus truly was he
[50:14] spoke and remember they said the one
[50:16] whom thou lovest he was pulled to that
[50:19] but he he stood in the midst of that
[50:22] time and he was he did not try to change
[50:25] the situation's but look at his life his
[50:29] life was completely given over to what
[50:32] was it that the father wanted to be done
[50:35] and not just what but even when that's
[50:38] the will of God the will of God is not
[50:40] just one but the will of God also has
[50:42] within it the timing what is his timing
[50:46] so he's showing this of
[50:48] house now what what was back there now
[50:51] here we see coming before us this second
[50:54] Adam the second man Adam were watching
[50:57] this unfold and we're watching what we
[50:59] see is alive that is a life of complete
[51:02] perfect submission so when we look at
[51:08] this we look at in the midst of it that
[51:12] as he would say the Lord Jesus was not
[51:14] mute at all during his time here and in
[51:19] his earthly journey even within the
[51:21] midst of those three and a half years he
[51:23] was not mute concerning his what the
[51:26] purpose of his time and what it was for
[51:29] him coming here he knew that even John's
[51:32] ministry called out behold the lamb of
[51:34] God which taketh away the sin of the
[51:36] world
[51:37] was his future office has priestly
[51:39] office so he knew that in order for that
[51:42] he's author everything his whole journey
[51:44] I want you to catch this now he's in
[51:46] Jesus he knew who he was
[51:48] and he also with identified what his
[51:51] purpose was and that's what he lived in
[51:54] he lived in what the word had said of
[51:57] who he was and in everything here he is
[52:03] even after a great healing takes place
[52:05] he'll speak to them of how and show to
[52:08] them the Bible says of how the Son of
[52:10] Man should suffer after coming out of
[52:14] the out of out of a healing and he'll go
[52:15] right in and he's showing these things
[52:17] throughout the time with the disciples
[52:19] so he's clearly disclosing yet the
[52:22] disciples are not catching that we know
[52:24] that they're not catching this of what's
[52:26] going on but he's letting him know this
[52:28] is the suffering that's going to take
[52:29] place I want you to think of this the
[52:33] whole time when we look at it the Lamb
[52:36] himself had to be willing to go to
[52:39] Calvary
[52:41] it couldn't be drug to Calvary he had to
[52:45] be willing to go I want you to look at
[52:48] this here in has the time is drawing
[52:52] down in John 10 verse 17 look at these
[52:55] statements just so just tremendous it's
[52:57] just so illuminated to my heart
[52:59] therefore doth my father love me because
[53:02] I lay down my life that I might take it
[53:06] again my father loves me because I lay
[53:11] down my life that I might take it again
[53:14] his life could not be taken from him he
[53:17] had to lay it down in order to take it
[53:21] again he had to lay it down he had to
[53:24] make a decision to lay his life down I
[53:26] hope you're with me now but that to lay
[53:29] his life down was not just something
[53:31] that was just could be done notice God
[53:35] even coming to if we can say it like
[53:37] this the apex of his purpose in walking
[53:40] here upon this earth God himself must
[53:43] create the conditions that will actually
[53:45] bring the
[53:47] into complete perfect submission to the
[53:50] fulfillment of the promise of the hour
[53:52] Oh glory be to God this is the parallel
[53:57] this is our parallel in this hour this
[54:01] was the son of man in this hour so it's
[54:04] the same working in the end in the body
[54:06] where the son of man himself is
[54:08] revealing his life to you and I what's
[54:14] this verse 18 no man taketh it from me
[54:18] but I lay it down of myself I have power
[54:24] to lay it down that's power
[54:26] he didn't it not all of these great
[54:29] miracles that were done but yet notice
[54:31] the purpose here all of the miracles all
[54:34] of those things we're clearly showing
[54:36] this was a man approved of God are you
[54:39] with me but yet notice the greatness of
[54:42] the authority the power that lay within
[54:45] his life was I have authority to lay my
[54:48] life down Oh glory be to God I tell you
[54:54] tonight that even when a when a seed yet
[54:57] not quicken but yet having a seed on the
[55:00] inside of potential you have within you
[55:02] the potential in the Spirit of God moves
[55:05] upon the life you have with it in it
[55:07] authority that's reading within there to
[55:10] say I received that authority to lay
[55:13] down my life and take up my cross and
[55:16] follow him the Spirit of God moving on
[55:19] you gives you authority you see how that
[55:23] God here in his bosom rested the
[55:25] authority to lay down his life and
[55:28] that's the same thing in our life it
[55:30] rests within our lives by the quickening
[55:33] power raising the seed to life lays the
[55:36] authority to lay our lives down I die
[55:44] daily I lay down daily
[55:54] and I have power look at this and I have
[55:59] power to take it again not only to lay
[56:04] it down but to take it up again this
[56:09] commandment have I received of my father
[56:13] Oh glory be to God we're watching this
[56:23] committing that it's taking place I want
[56:26] you to think of this he was he was
[56:31] ordained to this moment will you agree
[56:36] with that now let me take it another
[56:39] step will you agree that you're ordained
[56:43] for this moment yes you are
[56:48] but suddenly I don't feel but you're
[56:51] ordained for it
[56:53] you see listen it took the Spirit of God
[56:57] to quicken the promises to him you with
[57:02] me
[57:03] it took the Spirit of God coming to
[57:05] quicken the promises to him so he could
[57:08] stand and what he was speaking of the
[57:10] promises these were part of the promises
[57:14] that lay on the grounds that was a life
[57:17] to him
[57:18] he understood him at that time the
[57:21] disciples with him
[57:22] did not understand what he was speaking
[57:23] of but it was important that he
[57:25] understood he knew you see an
[57:31] understanding is that it had lifted him
[57:33] out of just this realm of where he was
[57:36] walking but here he was walking in the
[57:38] midst of them and in and through it he
[57:41] was ordained to this / no one else could
[57:44] have taken his place you agree with that
[57:46] no one else can take your place the same
[57:52] Spirit of God that moved upon him and
[57:55] the same authority what word speaks of
[57:59] the groom also speaks of the bride so
[58:03] they have that authority this is not
[58:05] just loose
[58:06] words friends but it's true that you and
[58:08] I might understand that having power to
[58:11] lay our lives down there is that which
[58:13] within our lives that the Spirit of God
[58:16] moving upon our life's not demanding but
[58:19] moving on our life literally draws out
[58:22] of us what he desires it doesn't force
[58:28] anything he draws it out of us it's
[58:33] committed to him no doubt you've been
[58:36] through circumstances I have maybe
[58:38] you're in tonight you have no idea how
[58:41] this is all gonna come out you have no
[58:44] idea how certain things are gonna work
[58:46] out you have no idea you don't know
[58:48] every little thing a little every little
[58:50] step of the way but what it brings you
[58:53] to brings me to is a place to where that
[58:56] we must commit ourselves unto the Lord
[58:59] and the whole situation what it is that
[59:03] we're trying to make sense of you know
[59:05] if there's things going around even in
[59:07] your mind or whatever more you have to
[59:09] commit that to the Lord and say Lord I
[59:11] give the battle to you Lord
[59:15] commit it into his hands and watch it in
[59:19] his hands watch him take control because
[59:23] you cannot make urine you're not made
[59:25] you're new you and I are not built to be
[59:27] able to try to handle these these these
[59:29] spiritual battles on our own
[59:31] the Bible says put on the whole armor of
[59:33] God whereby you might be able to stand
[59:36] against the wiles of the devil and don't
[59:38] just put it on you've got a shield raise
[59:41] that shield up and quench the fiery
[59:43] darts of the enemy take that sword that
[59:46] is given and cutting down you say how
[59:49] can I do that stand up on whom God has
[59:52] revealed to you that you are and
[59:56] standard you say how do I do that by the
[59:58] helmet of salvation that I know in whom
[1:00:02] I happy leave I know what he has done in
[1:00:05] me and then you look to the breastplate
[1:00:09] of righteousness to know that my heart
[1:00:11] desires
[1:00:12] they reflect him I only desire him
[1:00:15] you see what your glorying in is the
[1:00:18] armor that the chief captain has given
[1:00:21] you all it takes all it takes is just
[1:00:30] saying even in your heart right now
[1:00:32] you know I say I don't feel but just say
[1:00:35] in your heart because before you say
[1:00:37] this let me just ask you isn't he worthy
[1:00:42] listen he able hasn't he proven himself
[1:00:45] over and over he overthrew our unbelief
[1:00:49] he overthrew our doubt he overthrew all
[1:00:52] things that were against us then you can
[1:00:55] just say in your heart Lord I commit
[1:00:57] this to you I I give it to you because
[1:01:01] my worrying about it
[1:01:03] all of these things doubts and fears and
[1:01:05] things I committed to you and you know
[1:01:08] what you're doing you give it to him
[1:01:10] who's able to move on your behalf and he
[1:01:15] loves to do that because that's personal
[1:01:18] to you glory be to God your love no man
[1:01:26] taketh my life from me I want you to
[1:01:27] watch this how Peter picks this up in
[1:01:29] Acts chapter 2 verse 22 you men of
[1:01:32] Israel hear these words Jesus of
[1:01:34] Nazareth a man approved of God among you
[1:01:36] by miracles and wonders and signs which
[1:01:38] God did by him in the midst of you see
[1:01:41] he was a vessel you catch that God did
[1:01:43] by him how could God do this because he
[1:01:47] was a vessel he presented himself as a
[1:01:50] vessel there right as ye yourselves also
[1:01:55] know him being delivered by the
[1:01:58] determinate counsel and foreknowledge of
[1:02:00] God well Judas betrayed him no he was
[1:02:08] delivered by the determinate counsel and
[1:02:12] foreknowledge of God God just allowed
[1:02:18] the pieces to come together to fulfill
[1:02:22] what was already in his mind
[1:02:25] you understand me the council is not
[1:02:28] something that's going on now but right
[1:02:31] now is the reflection of the council
[1:02:33] that already took place and let me tell
[1:02:35] you something that council that took
[1:02:37] place meeting has been adjourned for
[1:02:41] recess recess yes to come down and
[1:02:44] express myself and collect my attributes
[1:02:47] and come back home
[1:02:51] council has already been recessed so
[1:02:56] here Peter is letting it be known that
[1:02:58] you see you see how Peter resting within
[1:03:01] this this is also his own life as well
[1:03:05] that he's resting in the Living God as
[1:03:08] all of the believers on that you know
[1:03:10] what there is nothing that's gonna touch
[1:03:12] our lives until God says and their
[1:03:15] purpose is served come on home
[1:03:18] how is he looking at that because he's
[1:03:21] looking at the example we have taken and
[1:03:28] by wicked hands have crucified and slain
[1:03:30] whom God has raised up and having loosed
[1:03:33] the pains of death because it was not
[1:03:35] possible that he should be holding of it
[1:03:38] it's hard not to hold still on those
[1:03:40] things in preach but we got to go on
[1:03:43] here
[1:03:44] two chapters later John 1227 the Lord
[1:03:49] Jesus says now is my soul trouble no I
[1:03:54] read to you two chapters before I have
[1:03:57] power to lay my life down I have power
[1:04:00] to take it up again
[1:04:01] no man taketh it from me but in verse 27
[1:04:05] here he says now is my soul troubled and
[1:04:08] what shall I say father save me from
[1:04:13] this hour but for this cause came I unto
[1:04:17] this hour
[1:04:18] and he says father glorify thy name
[1:04:22] then came there a voice from heaven
[1:04:25] saying I have both glorified it and will
[1:04:28] glorify it again save me from this hour
[1:04:34] but notice he sees he save me from this
[1:04:37] hour
[1:04:38] but for this hour came I aware of his
[1:04:42] purpose the in order to fulfill that
[1:04:46] purpose
[1:04:47] it requires full committal just like in
[1:04:53] the scripture mine my heart just went to
[1:04:55] this here and my Bible opens to it in
[1:04:56] John 17 verse 1 these words fake Jesus
[1:05:00] and lifted up his eyes to heaven it said
[1:05:02] father the hour has come glorify thy son
[1:05:05] that thy son may also glorify thee O
[1:05:07] glory Peter God glorified let me read
[1:05:11] this I don't know I didn't include this
[1:05:12] this just this just came here as thou
[1:05:15] has given him power over all flesh that
[1:05:17] he should give eternal life to as many
[1:05:19] as thou has given him glorify thou me
[1:05:26] thy son that thy son may glorify thee so
[1:05:33] the glory of God notice here's God's
[1:05:35] glory to where that the son could so
[1:05:39] reflect the glory of God through a
[1:05:42] complete perfect submission none of us
[1:05:47] will disagree that he lived a submissive
[1:05:51] life is that right he lived a submissive
[1:05:56] life he followed he said that his desire
[1:05:59] upon this earth I came not to do mine
[1:06:02] own will he had a personal will are you
[1:06:07] with me but he says I came not to do
[1:06:11] mine own will
[1:06:12] you see Jesus here he understands what
[1:06:16] it's like when we are even looking and
[1:06:19] desiring to find God's perfect will for
[1:06:22] our lives he understands that because
[1:06:25] our own will can be pulled in a certain
[1:06:28] way even when we're approaching things
[1:06:30] of testing the trials and decisions of
[1:06:33] life he understands that that's why but
[1:06:36] as we go to him as our faithful high
[1:06:38] priest he knows and understands us and
[1:06:41] is able to minister to that and you
[1:06:43] realize this that it isn't even and what
[1:06:45] I say though I believe that we ought to
[1:06:47] go to him and bring our cares
[1:06:50] unto him because he said cast your cares
[1:06:51] upon me because I care for you but the
[1:06:54] Bible has placed me by his own spirit
[1:06:56] that same life within you and I is a
[1:06:59] mediator even within our lives he even
[1:07:03] knows what to pray for when we ourselves
[1:07:05] don't even know what to pray for is that
[1:07:07] right it's a spirit of intercession hey
[1:07:10] man we're not Ben we're not disconnected
[1:07:12] from our high priests but our high
[1:07:14] priests we are united with him
[1:07:21] it's committal notice in Hebrews five
[1:07:24] seven who in the days of his flesh when
[1:07:27] he had offered up prayers and
[1:07:28] supplications with strong crying and
[1:07:30] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:07:34] from death and was heard in that he
[1:07:37] feared though he were a son yet learned
[1:07:40] he obedience was this very obedience is
[1:07:43] submission compliance by the things
[1:07:46] which he suffered and being made perfect
[1:07:51] he became the author of eternal
[1:07:52] salvation and through all them that obey
[1:07:54] Him called of God and high priest after
[1:07:57] the order of Melchizedek aren't you glad
[1:08:00] that God became one of us oh my brother
[1:08:08] sister he knows exactly he knows exactly
[1:08:11] how to move for our hearts notice let's
[1:08:14] go to this in the garden in Matthew 26
[1:08:17] verse 36 then cometh Jesus with them
[1:08:23] unto a place called Gethsemane and said
[1:08:26] unto the disciples sit ye here while I
[1:08:28] go yonder and pray and once she just to
[1:08:30] catch this here tonight I'm not gonna
[1:08:32] elaborate on this but notice his
[1:08:33] approach in the midst of this time I go
[1:08:38] yonder and pray I'm going to pray prayer
[1:08:45] to commune with his father you with me
[1:08:51] who was he who is he praying to he was
[1:08:53] praying to his father that dwelled
[1:08:55] within him
[1:08:59] fundamental foundation of faith when you
[1:09:01] pray in the name of Jesus Christ is the
[1:09:03] spirit of Jesus praying through you
[1:09:07] it's our high priest be the dog
[1:09:12] now watch this the verse 37 and he took
[1:09:17] with him Peter and two sons of Zebedee
[1:09:20] and began to be sorrowful and very heavy
[1:09:25] that phrase I've referred to it many
[1:09:27] times they were very heavy this is the
[1:09:29] apex of depression that's exactly what
[1:09:32] that phrase means in the Greek it's the
[1:09:35] height there's no other there's no
[1:09:36] greater depression than this right here
[1:09:39] very sorrowful sad
[1:09:42] why was he sad because he loved his
[1:09:47] disciples listen to me now
[1:09:50] he loved the fellowship with them he
[1:09:55] loved the sunrise and the sunset he
[1:09:59] loved those things but he realized that
[1:10:05] his left for them was greater than just
[1:10:09] a love that would stay here and just
[1:10:12] would remain that would not be able to
[1:10:15] help them so a deeper love is such a
[1:10:20] love that he now is committing himself
[1:10:22] to be willing to go this is this is the
[1:10:29] outworking of what was spoken I have
[1:10:31] power to lay my life down I'm not gonna
[1:10:34] ask you to raise your hands it's many
[1:10:36] times it's easy for us to speak promises
[1:10:40] that belonged to us but then when the
[1:10:43] actual moment comes when we're at the
[1:10:45] moment of that promise to be fulfilled
[1:10:48] remember listen that's when everything
[1:10:50] is set against you
[1:10:52] and to remember to remember that Satan
[1:10:56] is always there to try to upset at the
[1:11:01] verge of the fulfillment of the promise
[1:11:03] you try to tell you're not worthy you
[1:11:06] try to tell you it's enough for you
[1:11:07] he'll give all these other things but
[1:11:09] listen you can always discern his voice
[1:11:12] because his voice is a voice of
[1:11:14] condemnation I want you to think of this
[1:11:19] God Himself is not gonna honor a voice
[1:11:22] of condemnation even when you're seeking
[1:11:24] for a promise God Himself will not bring
[1:11:26] condemnation if there's anything that
[1:11:28] needs to be rain right he brings it to
[1:11:31] your heart with the desire that you will
[1:11:33] repent or relinquish from that right
[1:11:35] there and that the promise might be
[1:11:38] fulfilled God desires to fulfill hears
[1:11:41] word I don't think we can ever say that
[1:11:48] I don't think we can ever say that
[1:11:49] enough we are constantly bombarded with
[1:11:52] battle but I believe it's where within
[1:11:55] our hearts that through the maturing of
[1:11:57] the presence of God by his word is to
[1:12:00] bringing you an eye to the recognition
[1:12:02] of the voice and discerning that voice
[1:12:05] and withstanding it greater is He that
[1:12:11] is in you that he that's in the world
[1:12:15] you are not you are not the devil's
[1:12:19] punching bag no sir you have been made
[1:12:25] the head not the tail come on somebody
[1:12:32] even with that right there no matter how
[1:12:34] gloomy it could be you can say Amen no
[1:12:37] you may not be a a man tonight but right
[1:12:39] in your so you say Amen well you find
[1:12:42] that a man and that a man will start
[1:12:43] kicking up amen
[1:12:45] then maybe you know another day a man
[1:12:47] you know it's just it's picking up what
[1:12:49] what's that you have to start there's
[1:12:50] footsteps come on somebody there's
[1:12:53] footsteps are possession it has to start
[1:12:57] with this word and here is God
[1:12:59] ministering his word to lift you an
[1:13:01] in his promises my soul then he said
[1:13:05] unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful
[1:13:08] even unto death tarry ye here and watch
[1:13:10] with me and he went a little further
[1:13:12] fell on his face and prayed o my father
[1:13:15] if it be possible let this cup pass from
[1:13:17] me nevertheless not as I will but as
[1:13:21] thou wilt you know when I look at this
[1:13:27] he prayed this three times but let's
[1:13:30] just look at every every every time each
[1:13:33] time this is my opinion I'm not here to
[1:13:37] preach my opinion but I can say it like
[1:13:40] this if we can look at this scripture
[1:13:41] this right here in the latter part was
[1:13:44] the theme of his prayer you understand
[1:13:49] I'm saying I don't believe he just went
[1:13:50] and said and said I'll align oh my
[1:13:52] father if it be possible let this cup
[1:13:54] pass from me nevertheless not my world
[1:13:57] thing will be done but he's in prayer he
[1:14:01] went to pray praise prayer is communion
[1:14:05] come on somebody right now this is not
[1:14:08] communion this is me speaking or the
[1:14:11] Lord speaking and you listening but when
[1:14:13] you get home maybe on your way home
[1:14:15] you're driving or tomorrow morning or
[1:14:17] whatever here you are you'll be
[1:14:18] communing with the Lord speaking to him
[1:14:20] he's speaking back to you prayer is
[1:14:23] communion but here there is a communing
[1:14:29] that's going on here's the purpose
[1:14:31] here's the height here's the fulfillment
[1:14:33] of his journey upon earth listen this
[1:14:39] right here is not about casting a devil
[1:14:42] out of somebody this part right here is
[1:14:45] not about one who was sick with a palsy
[1:14:48] raised up this right here it's not about
[1:14:49] one who was who was dumb and cast
[1:14:51] himself in the fire and was delivered
[1:14:53] this is not about that
[1:14:54] this is overcoming his self are you with
[1:15:01] me in order for this promise to come to
[1:15:05] fulfillment it's got to be a complete
[1:15:08] committal
[1:15:11] and here he is in prayer see this is
[1:15:14] showing you and I how is it when I'm
[1:15:17] going through a tense when I'm going
[1:15:18] through a trial when I've got a
[1:15:20] situation that I just cannot make heads
[1:15:22] or tails out of he's showing you and I
[1:15:25] this is how you approach it in prayer
[1:15:29] and every one of us every one of us this
[1:15:34] is how that we look at it Lord if it's
[1:15:37] possible
[1:15:38] take this trial away Lord nor if it's
[1:15:41] possible let this bad circumstance go
[1:15:44] away Lord if it's possible Lord is that
[1:15:50] right or below Samuel I don't pray to
[1:15:53] dodge and avoid and avoid trials you
[1:15:56] know what brother Ram said no I'm not
[1:15:57] interested in somebody just quoting me a
[1:15:59] quote we're not talking about being
[1:16:02] politically correct we're talking about
[1:16:05] our own will
[1:16:09] you know how brother BAM said it three
[1:16:11] kinds of believers Lord don't take the
[1:16:12] trials from me just give me the grace to
[1:16:13] go through it amen
[1:16:15] but you recognize that he himself had to
[1:16:19] be committed to that what about the
[1:16:27] examples with the tax case pressure came
[1:16:30] on come on somebody wants it to end come
[1:16:35] on somebody but you see within this this
[1:16:38] it all still comes down we understand
[1:16:41] that God bring it out to our hearts that
[1:16:43] there is no other way for us to receive
[1:16:46] or come to perfection and the molding of
[1:16:49] our character outside of trials but
[1:16:55] here's the good part he said I'll be
[1:16:57] with you
[1:16:59] here's the good part he said my grace is
[1:17:01] sufficient here's the wonderful thing is
[1:17:04] that he will bring forth out of our life
[1:17:06] what he knows is there
[1:17:10] as Paul could tell you and I these
[1:17:13] temporary afflictions prayed the third
[1:17:19] time but notice how he says in verse 45
[1:17:23] he comes to them wakes him up you see
[1:17:26] they're sleeping this is not their time
[1:17:29] they're sleeping don't want somebody
[1:17:33] Polycarp and the rest I mean when Martin
[1:17:35] Luther when Martin Luther thought that
[1:17:36] time in Wittenberg that he was his time
[1:17:38] you weren't sleeping he was what praying
[1:17:41] come on he was praying he was communing
[1:17:48] behold the hours at hand and the Son of
[1:17:50] Man is betrayed into the hands of
[1:17:52] sinners rise let us be going behold he
[1:17:56] is at hand that does betray me I want
[1:17:58] you to think of this how many times do
[1:18:00] you read in the scriptures where the
[1:18:01] Lord Jesus himself when they sought to
[1:18:03] come and take him he would slip up many
[1:18:08] times he would slip out he would slip
[1:18:10] out of the way now the one thing that we
[1:18:12] can look within that it wasn't the
[1:18:14] timing
[1:18:16] it wasn't the timing there are times
[1:18:19] that the Lord Jesus stood right there in
[1:18:21] the midst of the temple and spoke
[1:18:23] directly to them face-to-face and he
[1:18:26] called them to the word that they said
[1:18:29] they were living by and then there are
[1:18:31] other times when they would arise with
[1:18:33] questions the Bible said vehemently
[1:18:35] press upon him what did he do he went
[1:18:38] out well why did he do it like that
[1:18:43] because that's what the Father wanted
[1:18:49] the whole purpose of the coming was not
[1:18:52] to be able to disprove everybody was not
[1:18:57] to make everybody believers he came for
[1:19:01] his own that's the whole objective when
[1:19:06] he comes in every generation he does not
[1:19:08] come to make everybody in that
[1:19:11] generation a believer he does not come
[1:19:12] to try to disprove everybody no he comes
[1:19:15] for his own that's what he comes for
[1:19:21] Rhys let us be going it would I look at
[1:19:24] this here he could have he he could have
[1:19:28] went anywhere all of these places even
[1:19:32] where is that Gethsemane all these
[1:19:34] places are very very much set for who he
[1:19:40] is the purpose of his life worries that
[1:19:42] all of these things are purposely
[1:19:44] positioned I don't have time to go into
[1:19:48] that but I assure you I want you to see
[1:19:51] this is that he just he could have run
[1:19:53] from the situation but what gave him the
[1:19:56] strength to stand chapters before I read
[1:19:58] to you my soul is troubled read to you
[1:20:01] the very first part of this he's
[1:20:02] entering into this very sorrowful very
[1:20:05] heavy a height of depression but what's
[1:20:08] he doing with that he's taking it to
[1:20:11] this Father in prayer he's committing
[1:20:14] himself to his father brother Adam made
[1:20:19] this statement I didn't put this one on
[1:20:21] on there but I because I don't want to
[1:20:22] read the whole thing but brother Ram
[1:20:23] tells us of all the demons that gathered
[1:20:26] around there that moment to try to
[1:20:29] persuade him and remove him from the
[1:20:32] objective even Satan came upon Peter
[1:20:36] Andrew Peter said no Lord it shall not
[1:20:39] be and Jesus discerned it and said Satan
[1:20:43] gets out behind me thou art an offence
[1:20:47] to me what did he consider an offense
[1:20:50] anything that hindered the purpose of
[1:20:54] God's desire and will for his life
[1:20:58] anything he discerned it is that he
[1:21:02] dispensed a Peter that's my buddy that's
[1:21:04] a good guy Peter you know he loves me
[1:21:05] Peter would do anything for me no he
[1:21:07] discerned it at that moment and said
[1:21:09] thou art an offence
[1:21:11] it wasn't Peter you a Satan that was
[1:21:17] trying to get him to dodge
[1:21:25] remember Center like this and
[1:21:27] conferences I never heard him say like
[1:21:30] this before but he's talking of how that
[1:21:33] here God is speaking to him through the
[1:21:36] Sun he said the angels are listening so
[1:21:38] what's gonna be your result
[1:21:40] he said the whole world's laying on your
[1:21:42] shoulder do you want to pay the price or
[1:21:45] what do you want to do you can come
[1:21:48] right on now without death what do you
[1:21:52] want to do you can come on right now
[1:21:54] without death hello Moses was packed
[1:22:01] away Elijah was packed away come on
[1:22:04] somebody write all of this right here as
[1:22:07] he said he you could he could have come
[1:22:10] on right now without death but there
[1:22:13] would have been no redemption and that
[1:22:17] was his purpose his purpose was to bring
[1:22:22] Redemption
[1:22:24] our purpose is vessels that Redemption
[1:22:27] might be finished up my think of this
[1:22:36] the Bible says let me just skim over
[1:22:39] this here he was the scriptures already
[1:22:42] prophetically spoke in Isaiah 53 he
[1:22:44] opened not his mouth
[1:22:46] it already spoke of the character in
[1:22:49] their life this is what it will do open
[1:22:51] not his mouth were there pressures to
[1:22:54] open his mouth were there things that he
[1:22:58] could have I'm gonna defend myself I am
[1:23:05] going to I'm going to lay it all out
[1:23:07] what's he tempted
[1:23:12] sure he was the scriptures are emphatic
[1:23:17] to state to you and I he opened not his
[1:23:20] mouth
[1:23:23] the Bible tells us in Luke 23 that even
[1:23:27] while here he was going to Calvary on
[1:23:30] the cross I'm just going to mention to
[1:23:32] her a first the first few scriptures he
[1:23:35] says Harriet's crucified and here he is
[1:23:37] Father forgive them for they know not
[1:23:40] what they do
[1:23:42] he's living by his own word forgive them
[1:23:49] remember what he said
[1:23:52] remember he said if you and your life
[1:23:54] have told anything that when there's not
[1:23:57] forgiveness how that the mountain itself
[1:24:00] will not move God will not hear your
[1:24:02] prayer here is the great test in the
[1:24:06] midst of this time he's being railed
[1:24:07] upon he's been reviled if you're the son
[1:24:10] of God
[1:24:11] come off the cross and prove yourself
[1:24:13] and you've got all sort and you've got
[1:24:15] all power you see it was not this was
[1:24:18] not easy as a matter of fact he opened
[1:24:22] not his mouth
[1:24:22] it was the whole atmosphere was contrary
[1:24:26] to where that this was something easy it
[1:24:30] was not easy
[1:24:31] but what policy able to do this not
[1:24:35] because listen to me now not because he
[1:24:38] was virgin born he was able to do this
[1:24:43] because the lamb had come to a place of
[1:24:46] such submission to the Heavenly Father
[1:24:51] he trusted him you know what I'm saying
[1:24:57] in the book of Psalm 69 because thou
[1:24:59] trusting me my darling he trusted him to
[1:25:06] walk into death he trusted him he has in
[1:25:09] my head that word was quickened to his
[1:25:11] life destroy this temple and in three
[1:25:13] days I'll raise it up again they derided
[1:25:17] him they mocked him even even to
[1:25:23] malefactors one of the malefactors
[1:25:25] even speaks to him the same thing
[1:25:30] railing on him if thou be the Christ
[1:25:32] come down off the cross and save us but
[1:25:35] there's one that guy might have been the
[1:25:40] biggest robber and biggest sinner within
[1:25:43] the village everybody might have known
[1:25:45] that guy is a biggest Reber and
[1:25:47] everything else and everything but what
[1:25:49] they didn't know was the last
[1:25:51] conversation they didn't know the
[1:25:54] closing moments this was arranged God
[1:26:00] had arranged this here was his lamb he
[1:26:04] was the Lamb of God they're hanging o
[1:26:06] Calvary and here this man at that time
[1:26:10] it wasn't that God inspired him the
[1:26:12] robber do whatever he did but God
[1:26:14] permitted it why here he is in position
[1:26:17] to be able to testify after Pilate has
[1:26:21] said I find no fault in you after the
[1:26:23] rest of them said this man Herod said
[1:26:26] this man I don't find any fault in him
[1:26:28] and here stands one of the malefactors
[1:26:31] that said this man has not done anything
[1:26:36] to deserve this you might go week after
[1:26:43] week month after month in the workplace
[1:26:46] and it might seem like everybody's
[1:26:50] against you it's a spirit but God's
[1:26:55] standing for you
[1:26:59] God will have somebody to stand up and
[1:27:01] testify you with me gotta have somebody
[1:27:05] stand up and give witness and give
[1:27:07] testimony yes sir oh my lord I don't
[1:27:13] know where time goes this wood preacher
[1:27:17] away but it's so wonderful brother BAM
[1:27:22] tells it like this in identification I'm
[1:27:23] closing he tells in the message
[1:27:26] identification of how that Satan could
[1:27:30] list then there and look and say this
[1:27:32] this can't be God manifested in flesh
[1:27:38] taking whippings like this can't be you
[1:27:44] see what Satan has saw is God's creative
[1:27:47] power he's watched God be able to move
[1:27:52] on the scene when Satan had stirred up
[1:27:55] Pharaoh's army to chase him and he's
[1:27:57] witnessed of how that God has come on
[1:27:59] the scene and drowned them all but all
[1:28:02] those things were all types cuz every
[1:28:06] one of those was Satan being allured
[1:28:09] into an ambush Satan still didn't catch
[1:28:14] it this right here where he's looking at
[1:28:16] I don't have to how can this be hit
[1:28:18] they're saying this and he's not saying
[1:28:20] nothing about it he's not doing anything
[1:28:22] it can't be ambushed he's never seen
[1:28:31] this displayed in this manner hamana
[1:28:37] brother branham said it like this I want
[1:28:40] you to listen this now he said Satan was
[1:28:42] watching at that he put a rag over his
[1:28:44] face soldier smote him in the head with
[1:28:46] a stick then passed it one to another
[1:28:48] said now if you can see these visions if
[1:28:50] you be a prophet
[1:28:52] tell us who hits you and he never look
[1:28:54] at this he never opened his mouth you
[1:28:59] believe he could have told him who was
[1:29:00] hitting him I believe so I believe he
[1:29:03] could have told him where you live I
[1:29:04] believe he could have told him what they
[1:29:05] just done but he never opened this mouth
[1:29:09] you know why
[1:29:10] he wasn't gonna clown for them there
[1:29:14] were times he opened his mouth and
[1:29:15] there's times he bitten open his mouth I
[1:29:18] want you to watch what the Prophet
[1:29:20] saying here he never opened his mouth
[1:29:22] Satan said that can't be the Son of God
[1:29:25] it just can't be he wouldn't put up with
[1:29:28] that but sons of God put up with
[1:29:31] anything as long as they know they're
[1:29:33] doing the will of God and that's what he
[1:29:36] come to do criticism whoo sons of God
[1:29:43] put up any by like criticism I'm glad
[1:29:51] nobody raised your hand I'm gonna call
[1:29:52] you a liar in here nobody likes
[1:29:55] criticism is that right but here was
[1:29:59] criticism constantly the Bible said he
[1:30:02] was despised and rejected of men now
[1:30:06] watch how brother man goes the very next
[1:30:07] code after this
[1:30:08] now with our message can we stand by the
[1:30:12] looking glass of God's Word and see
[1:30:15] Christ reflect in our own lives then can
[1:30:18] we bear such and the reproach of the
[1:30:21] message that we're standing for someone
[1:30:24] can say something about it and yet you
[1:30:25] just don't open your mouth and say
[1:30:27] nothing about it why would you not open
[1:30:30] your mouth because he never opened his
[1:30:32] mouth under send me Jesus was not
[1:30:37] interested in their blog post these are
[1:30:40] not interested in their YouTube videos
[1:30:42] he's got a purpose to serve who probably
[1:30:45] puts it in another place for the message
[1:30:47] he said Jesus was so focused on the
[1:30:50] purpose of God for his life he ignored
[1:30:53] the criticism Oh God let us be so caught
[1:30:57] in the purpose of God for our life
[1:31:00] because through that we receive strength
[1:31:04] to look above criticism
[1:31:12] he was an example prophet said have we
[1:31:16] sons and daughters of God God reflects
[1:31:20] his character in us then we become like
[1:31:22] him
[1:31:22] oh he said that's my desire I think
[1:31:25] that's every believers desire is to
[1:31:27] become more like him now there's no
[1:31:34] doubt about it that all around us here
[1:31:36] myself included there's times we've
[1:31:38] opened our mouth when we shouldn't have
[1:31:41] the Bible says when he was reviled he
[1:31:45] reviled not back the Bible says that
[1:31:47] there was no guile found in his mouth it
[1:31:53] wasn't that he it wasn't that well he
[1:31:55] didn't open his mouth he didn't say no
[1:31:56] there wasn't anything within him there
[1:32:00] wasn't anything within him look brother
[1:32:05] Samuel that's completely impossible I
[1:32:07] agree with you when it comes to us flesh
[1:32:10] and blood but here right here on this
[1:32:15] earth right here walking in a body like
[1:32:18] our own body he committed himself he
[1:32:24] committed himself but some how do I
[1:32:26] overcome that commit it to the Lord go
[1:32:31] to one the latter quotes I I'm gonna
[1:32:32] read this before I want to read this
[1:32:34] before we pray life story it's right
[1:32:39] after Psalms 91 life story if someone
[1:32:43] talks about you and you talk back about
[1:32:46] them God can't fight your battle you're
[1:32:49] fighting it yourself and watch these
[1:32:52] words this is this is clear just let
[1:32:56] loose and let him do it just let loose
[1:33:05] and let him do it and just commit it
[1:33:14] we can worry about it we can even stew
[1:33:18] about it week we can we can all of those
[1:33:24] things can remain listen friends those
[1:33:27] things can remain within us but this is
[1:33:32] where just let loose how do I let loose
[1:33:35] how can I let loose first of all you
[1:33:39] have to make a separation from it and
[1:33:43] recognize it this is a fault
[1:33:46] this is laying in me that's that's part
[1:33:50] it that's where it starts because what
[1:33:51] you're doing you're now distancing you
[1:33:53] you're seeing this for what it is
[1:33:55] you're just letting loose now you can
[1:33:58] let him come and say Lord remove this
[1:34:02] Lord I commit to you the RAM says that's
[1:34:10] the greatest weapon that I know of of a
[1:34:13] Christian today is a committal to God
[1:34:18] when you can't do nothing about it
[1:34:21] you've been there maybe there tonight
[1:34:24] when you can't do nothing about it just
[1:34:28] commit it to him
[1:34:32] but some you don't understand no I have
[1:34:36] to commit things to him too and I've had
[1:34:39] to but you know even and coming to that
[1:34:43] I've said this over and over I don't
[1:34:47] want to just approach something and say
[1:34:49] well this is what the word says and just
[1:34:52] say it but I want to say Lord this is
[1:34:56] what you're calling me to help me to
[1:35:01] commit to you even if you realize what
[1:35:05] what what this is a need ask him to
[1:35:09] create the conditions to move so that
[1:35:14] the committing comes that submitting
[1:35:17] comes that cleansing comes just commit
[1:35:22] it to him look at this God will take
[1:35:26] care who will God will God will take
[1:35:34] care of it not you and God not me and
[1:35:37] God God will take care of it you've done
[1:35:41] your part committing it to him you know
[1:35:46] you take something you committed it took
[1:35:50] a promise whatever it whatever it might
[1:35:52] be and you take that and you commit it
[1:35:56] to the Lord in prayer
[1:35:58] but the brem tells it like this and this
[1:36:00] is how we can apply it across every part
[1:36:02] of our life he said it's just like was
[1:36:05] the need for healing in your body he
[1:36:09] said in a committal a committal says
[1:36:11] lord I accept your healing for my body
[1:36:18] and he says from that from that very
[1:36:22] thing he says you he said here's what
[1:36:24] you must do
[1:36:26] surrender yourself entirely to Christ
[1:36:29] and surrender your mind to his word and
[1:36:31] he says say this Lord I won't act upon
[1:36:35] my own feelings upon my own thoughts I
[1:36:38] will only act upon your word I'll have
[1:36:42] no control of my own thoughts concerning
[1:36:44] it I will act that's a committal when
[1:36:50] symptoms arise feelings arise things
[1:36:53] that arise against what I stand on your
[1:36:55] word you see you can come out of the
[1:36:59] service out of the service here and I
[1:37:01] want you to what I want you to see you
[1:37:03] come out of it the devil's gonna be
[1:37:05] waiting
[1:37:06] whether it's tomorrow whatever more but
[1:37:08] don't look at that and say huh it was
[1:37:09] just all elevated no Simon
[1:37:11] now you said no but what I'm trying to
[1:37:12] show you is is that as he stands there
[1:37:14] to try to bring up the symptoms you
[1:37:18] stand there and say the Lord's healed me
[1:37:20] you don't matter if it's physical or
[1:37:22] it's emotional spiritual meaning God
[1:37:24] sealed mine and you stand there on that
[1:37:27] word
[1:37:27] that's a committal to the Lord any
[1:37:30] feeling anything that arises anything
[1:37:32] that through the midst of that trial or
[1:37:34] that test you stand up on that committal
[1:37:37] whatever it is that you're facing
[1:37:40] committed to him say lord help me help
[1:37:46] me Lord to commit it to you you see the
[1:37:49] Lord Jesus himself here he was he was
[1:37:51] going through a test he was coming into
[1:37:54] the greatest trial but he didn't
[1:37:57] approach it casually and same ordained
[1:38:00] for this he felt the pressures the
[1:38:04] committal was his soul where his life
[1:38:08] could be so submitted into the hands of
[1:38:12] God I hope you understand this Jesus
[1:38:16] never had to take a xanax to go to
[1:38:18] Calvary I'm not putting anything down on
[1:38:21] this I want you to understand God so
[1:38:24] moved upon his life to where he never
[1:38:27] had to take a downer or an upper or
[1:38:29] anything it's so moved him to a place of
[1:38:33] submission the reason I say that is not
[1:38:36] for you to be focused on medication I
[1:38:38] say that so that you might understand he
[1:38:41] who is the God of all peace will give
[1:38:44] you the peace to submit to what word
[1:38:47] that he drops upon your heart it will
[1:38:51] not be something where you have to be
[1:38:52] anxious the Bible says be careful for
[1:38:54] nothing be anxious for nothing just
[1:38:59] resting
[1:39:01] isn't he wonderful he's faithful Church
[1:39:05] he's faithful he knows your need
[1:39:07] he knows my need and you know he's here
[1:39:11] to minister to us let's pray anybody
[1:39:18] like to be remembered in prayer tonight
[1:39:25] Heavenly Father or do you see throughout
[1:39:30] the building Lord Jesus the needs of
[1:39:34] your children we all Lord stand in need
[1:39:36] of you father as you spoke so clearly to
[1:39:40] us tonight the committing of ourselves
[1:39:43] to you we see the example that's been
[1:39:46] laid out before us and we realize more
[1:39:49] that it's the submitting of our self our
[1:39:54] will to your will Lord we're thankful

[1:50:26] hi Saints I'm glad that you all keep my
[1:50:31] father in prayers you all know he had a
[1:50:34] stroke back in late January early
[1:50:38] February and my mother and my sister and
[1:50:42] I almost every other week or every other
[1:50:45] day we go and see them and from the time
[1:50:49] he went to the hospital to the time
[1:50:52] where he's at right now he's in the
[1:50:54] nursing home he's slowly progressing to
[1:50:58] where he knows his family he knows his
[1:51:01] name he knows some of the family members
[1:51:05] if by looking at your face he would
[1:51:08] recognize some of you but he doesn't
[1:51:10] know the names slowly he's trying to
[1:51:13] remember all that we got the word that
[1:51:16] if he keeps us up within eight months
[1:51:20] down the road that's what they're
[1:51:22] telling us within eight months he might
[1:51:24] get to come home if he does what he's
[1:51:26] supposed to do we're hoping that for my
[1:51:31] mom's sake and for my sister and I say
[1:51:34] otherwise he's going to have to stay in
[1:51:37] the nursing home the rest of his life
[1:51:38] because of his stroke really got him
[1:51:42] down we almost lost them I'm just so
[1:51:47] glad that God is with him the whole
[1:51:49] entire time I see the progress from
[1:51:53] right when he went from the hospital to
[1:51:56] now it's a miracle that God's right
[1:51:59] there with him amen
[1:52:02] [Applause]
