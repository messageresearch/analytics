[38:57] together there's needs
[38:58] amen and i'm glad that he's the one who
[39:01] comes to
[39:01] meet those needs so we just want to just
[39:04] be in prayer for that brother alexander
[39:06] will be standing in here
[39:08] on sunday and then also keep in mind the
[39:10] following sunday brother ronnie long
[39:13] will be here it'll be on the 25th
[39:16] so let's look here in first corinthians
[39:18] 13
[39:19] 4. charity
[39:23] suffereth long and is kind
[39:30] not itself and is not puffed up
[39:34] may god bless you bless the reading of
[39:36] the word as you're being seated
[39:38] i want to go to psalms 145
[39:44] and as we we look at this
[39:47] in the in the scripture and seeing
[39:51] how that paul would would capture and
[39:57] expressing to the church of the living
[39:59] god of what
[40:00] real charity is you remember
[40:04] paul would also write in the book of
[40:07] colossians he would write in each of the
[40:09] in each
[40:10] of the books he would deal with with
[40:12] charity
[40:13] and in the book of colossians paul would
[40:16] write
[40:17] about above all things put on charity
[40:21] and that
[40:21] that phrase put on it means to
[40:25] sink into a garment
[40:28] and those are things that for in our
[40:31] lives where we are
[40:32] constantly challenged and i believe the
[40:34] desire of every believer
[40:36] is that christ would be reflected
[40:40] through our lives and in every situation
[40:43] there's some situations that are more
[40:46] glorious to us than there are
[40:49] in other situations but regardless
[40:53] we want him to be glorified
[40:56] let me just give you an example it's
[40:58] very glorious when we can stand and we
[41:00] can give a testimony and say
[41:02] god has come god has completely healed
[41:05] me the
[41:06] lord touched me and then to have the
[41:09] the the contrast of that would be able
[41:12] to say
[41:12] here we are still we're still suffering
[41:15] but god is faithful and in all things
[41:19] it's glorifying
[41:20] god it's giving god glory and knowing
[41:23] that god
[41:24] has everything in control and god's
[41:26] working it out and how that
[41:28] when we we see this of the love of god
[41:32] and to see that such a such a contrast
[41:35] with this last part we've been looking
[41:37] at it for some services that
[41:39] it's not puffed up it's not that which
[41:41] is lofty or
[41:43] to bear oneself lofty or to think of
[41:46] oneself
[41:47] above another or proud and we know that
[41:50] that's a battle each and every moment
[41:52] and every day of our life
[41:54] because the first birth itself it came
[41:57] by pride
[41:58] and so god by his grace humility
[42:02] comes into our life to grant to you and
[42:04] i and bring us to a place
[42:06] of overcoming and give us the victory
[42:09] that we might be able to
[42:10] recognize that opposition recognize
[42:13] pride because pride
[42:14] is such a subtle little deceptive thing
[42:16] i just was reading where the prophet was
[42:18] speaking of it
[42:19] and he speaks to a woman and he says oh
[42:22] sister he says
[42:23] i see he says the lord has already
[42:25] healed you he said but you got
[42:26] a little hottie about your healing and
[42:29] now that sickness has returned
[42:31] so we always want to look at it and say
[42:33] god
[42:34] thank you for your mercy lord thank you
[42:37] for your grace lord
[42:39] and to recognize that in everything
[42:41] we're nothing
[42:42] but he's everything and this is where
[42:45] when david would
[42:46] would write here in psalms 145 he would
[42:49] say
[42:50] i will extol thee my god o king
[42:54] and i will bless thy name forever and
[42:56] ever
[42:57] every day will i bless thee and i will
[43:00] praise thy name forever and ever
[43:04] great is the lord and greatly to be
[43:07] praised
[43:08] and his greatness is unsearchable
[43:12] one generation shall praise thy works to
[43:15] another
[43:16] and shall declare thy mighty acts
[43:19] i will speak of the glorious honor of
[43:21] thy majesty
[43:22] and of thy wondrous works and men shall
[43:26] speak of the might of thy terrible that
[43:29] means awesome
[43:30] acts and i will declare thy
[43:33] greatness so the greatness of god
[43:37] is not a it's not a thought but the
[43:40] greatness of god
[43:41] is an actual display of who he
[43:44] is but greatness is not displayed the
[43:48] greatness of god is not something that
[43:50] is displayed
[43:52] how that of the world what the world
[43:54] calls great because remember
[43:56] what the world calls great god calls
[43:59] foolish
[44:00] but what the world calls foolish that's
[44:02] what god calls great
[44:04] and god has so placed it within his word
[44:07] now
[44:08] god will never do anything outside of
[44:10] his word he could
[44:11] but he won't do anything outside of his
[44:13] word so
[44:14] he when god has given his word remember
[44:17] when he spoke his word
[44:19] his thought and even the season the time
[44:22] the vessels all of that is laying within
[44:26] that word
[44:27] and it's god has totally is entrusted to
[44:31] himself
[44:32] to bring that word to pass men can look
[44:35] upon that word and say
[44:37] does this mean this or does this mean
[44:39] that or could this mean this or could
[44:41] this mean that
[44:42] and then those can be things that you
[44:44] and i can look at and we can even see
[44:47] even in the time that we're living in
[44:49] even as we've looked at the message
[44:51] we've looked here at the scriptures and
[44:53] we see things that sometimes maybe we
[44:56] had
[44:56] thoughts like this or thoughts like this
[44:58] but one of the great things is is that
[45:01] we didn't have thoughts that were
[45:03] periods we had thoughts that were commas
[45:05] and thoughts that were open to being
[45:07] removed
[45:08] and it's open to god coming and god
[45:11] fulfilling
[45:12] his word because you or i would miss it
[45:16] if not for the grace of god that's given
[45:18] to our lives
[45:20] to be able to recognize god at work
[45:23] god vindicating his word god vindicating
[45:26] his promise
[45:26] not just looking at a ministry and
[45:29] saying wow
[45:30] what a great ministry wild signs and
[45:32] wonders but to have
[45:34] an unction of the holy spirit to
[45:36] recognize
[45:37] the ministry that god has sent in this
[45:40] hour
[45:41] that it is the fulfillment of the
[45:43] promises that he has made that's the
[45:46] grace of god
[45:47] we didn't give ourselves that that's
[45:49] god's grace that you and i
[45:51] can see that that part in the scripture
[45:54] and that same grace
[45:55] that's given that we can see that god
[45:58] fulfilling the scripture is the same
[46:00] grace
[46:01] that's given to us that then we step
[46:04] in to the word to that part that's to be
[46:07] fulfilled
[46:08] and it's not us fulfilling it it's god
[46:11] fulfilling his word that he promised
[46:14] through you and i in his season in his
[46:17] time
[46:17] through his subjects and it is it is
[46:21] his work and it is marvelous
[46:24] it's beyond that of what men look at it
[46:28] comes in such simplicity even when john
[46:32] was standing here and they looked at
[46:34] those scriptures
[46:35] of how the high places would be made
[46:38] plain and low places would be exalted
[46:40] and they they had in their mind of how
[46:43] that that was going to be
[46:44] but god made that scripture manifest
[46:48] through the ministry of john the baptist
[46:52] here came a man that was not part of
[46:54] their seminaries
[46:55] he was not part of their training he was
[46:58] not part of any of that
[46:59] he was a man that god here he was in the
[47:02] wilderness
[47:03] here he has brought at the time where
[47:05] the ministry is supposed to be
[47:07] god is arranging everything in its
[47:10] season and here was a fulfillment of the
[47:13] word
[47:14] and yet the people are looking right
[47:16] past it let me just say this to you
[47:19] we can understand those things or know
[47:21] those things but let me just tell you
[47:23] something
[47:24] god is still god he's still
[47:27] fulfilling his word he's still
[47:30] passing over the wise and he's still
[47:33] revealing himself to the symbol
[47:36] the simple that just simply says this is
[47:38] your word lord
[47:40] and i'm trusting in you you'll give the
[47:42] unction
[47:43] you give the direction the same god that
[47:46] could lead
[47:46] israel and say pack up it's time to move
[47:49] we're looking to the same pillar of fire
[47:52] the angel of the lord the holy spirit
[47:54] that's leading us from glory unto glory
[47:58] and it is the greatness of god that as
[48:01] we see
[48:02] on display it is the greatness of god
[48:05] that we
[48:06] see that god displaying even his
[48:08] attributes and his
[48:10] and his life and his nature think of the
[48:12] lord jesus when we've been looking at
[48:14] this
[48:15] in in a couple of services here he come
[48:18] and you know brother bran would say it
[48:19] like this
[48:20] that there was 99 of the people and 9
[48:23] 10 didn't even know he was here on earth
[48:27] even right there the bible said he came
[48:29] to his own
[48:30] and his own received him not they kept
[48:33] on probing him tell us whether you're
[48:35] him or not
[48:36] show us or do this but you see it's not
[48:39] god it's not put on like that by
[48:42] believers
[48:43] believers just simply believe it
[48:46] it's something that moves beyond this
[48:48] side beyond these ears
[48:50] it moves down deep and it just it
[48:52] settles down you say
[48:53] this is good this is reality this
[48:57] is life this is truth it just it's
[48:59] something and you know
[49:00] what's awesome god doesn't ask you and i
[49:03] to explain it he just
[49:05] asked can't you believe it because if
[49:08] you can believe it and receive it in
[49:10] that way
[49:10] the same god that's vindicating that
[49:13] word is the same god that in his
[49:15] greatness will come in such simplicity
[49:18] and make it so real in your life and
[49:21] through your life
[49:23] it's greatness how the lord jesus he
[49:25] would come
[49:26] as we've been looking at in such
[49:28] humility that the
[49:30] very god of heaven brother brandon would
[49:32] put it like this humiliated himself
[49:34] he took upon a garment in the likeness
[49:37] of sinful flesh
[49:38] here was the king of glory you would
[49:40] expect kingly garments
[49:42] but he came in a garment that was
[49:44] promised according to his word
[49:46] in order to redeem you and add he took
[49:49] not on him the nature of angels
[49:51] he took on him the seed of abraham the
[49:54] promise of his word
[49:55] and when every time god comes and the
[49:58] word is being fulfilled
[50:00] god is present because it's god failing
[50:03] himself
[50:04] wrapping himself up in his word and
[50:06] making that word
[50:07] manifest to his children and his
[50:09] children
[50:10] recognize him very god of heaven
[50:14] humiliated
[50:15] himself and you know you see these are
[50:19] things
[50:19] as as brother braham goes on he says he
[50:22] says
[50:22] but we don't want to be humiliated and
[50:24] he goes through what god is
[50:26] asking of things he says you know that's
[50:28] the reason the women don't want to let
[50:29] their hair grow out they they don't want
[50:30] to wear dresses like they should they
[50:32] they they get humiliated but jesus he
[50:35] said
[50:35] constantly look who he was greatness
[50:39] he said i'm going to say something
[50:41] greatness humiliates itself
[50:44] great humble humbles greatness humbles
[50:48] itself
[50:48] greatness now i want to just deal with
[50:51] this a moment here
[50:52] humiliates itself it doesn't mean
[50:55] to look down upon yourself
[50:59] [Music]
[51:01] but it really means to have a real
[51:04] conscious
[51:05] awareness of who you and i are
[51:09] in reality we're just 84 cents of
[51:13] dirt but on the inside
[51:16] not the outside but on the inside
[51:20] is on the inside
[51:23] is real cold it's what's on the inside
[51:26] not on the outside remember even the
[51:29] world itself
[51:30] satan paints it out it's it's what's on
[51:32] the outside
[51:33] and it's attractive but then you find no
[51:35] substance
[51:37] of what's on the inside god veils
[51:39] himself
[51:40] in the substance of his life and of his
[51:42] word
[51:43] and it's not the character on the
[51:45] outside or the
[51:46] the visage on the outside it's what's on
[51:49] the inside the scripture said
[51:50] there was no beauty we should desire him
[51:54] no form no covenant it wasn't anything
[51:57] about
[51:58] outside that was so oh attractive as a
[52:01] matter of fact
[52:01] he was a spindly looking fellow
[52:05] he would be one that was looked right
[52:07] over but god
[52:08] chose it that way
[52:12] this was greatness so if that greatness
[52:15] as it was made manifest to where he
[52:18] would humble himself
[52:19] and at the very even at the closing out
[52:22] before heading to the garden
[52:24] he would he would adorn himself with
[52:28] or gird himself with with that of a
[52:30] towel
[52:31] and he would he would fetch water and he
[52:33] would wash the
[52:34] feet of the disciples he would bring
[52:37] himself
[52:38] into a place it wasn't just that he was
[52:41] walking in the likeness of sinful flesh
[52:43] but he humbled himself
[52:44] he became lore became a foot washed
[52:46] funky because
[52:48] there were many who were walking around
[52:50] in bodies though that
[52:52] it was not virgin born but yet here they
[52:54] were walking around
[52:56] in human bodies but here the god of
[52:58] glory
[52:59] he came down greatness and he humbled
[53:01] himself
[53:02] to become a footwash flunky and he
[53:04] humbled himself
[53:06] and washed their feet and he humbled
[53:08] himself
[53:09] even to another degree that not just
[53:11] death
[53:12] but the death of the cross
[53:16] that's greatness that greatness let me
[53:19] just say this
[53:21] that greatness was all about you and me
[53:25] that greatness was not about him amen
[53:29] he endured the cross for the joy
[53:33] that was set before him what was that
[53:36] joy
[53:37] you and me that that life that that was
[53:40] there
[53:40] resting inside of that vessel might now
[53:44] be imparted into you and i that
[53:47] redemption might come to you and i
[53:49] that we might be brought back how could
[53:51] you and i be brought back
[53:53] because greatness came down and
[53:56] took the bling
[53:59] took the blame that you and i could go
[54:02] free
[54:05] oh glory so this same greatness
[54:10] is made manifest within
[54:14] the body the same way that this life
[54:17] as it was in the groom it's the same way
[54:19] that this life is
[54:21] in the body of believers it won't act
[54:23] any different
[54:25] he said if this spirit if this if that
[54:27] spirit the race of jesus from the grave
[54:30] dwell in you it shall also quicken your
[54:32] mortal body
[54:34] you know act the same way the works that
[54:36] i do shall you do also
[54:38] it'll act the same way it's the same
[54:40] jesus
[54:42] in a different form amen
[54:45] paul writes this in philippians 2. think
[54:48] of how paul
[54:49] here he is writing of this character in
[54:51] this life
[54:52] we read the latter scriptures but now
[54:54] he's dealing with
[54:56] this life this character being expressed
[54:58] in the body
[54:59] if there be any if there be therefore
[55:02] any consolation in christ
[55:04] if any comfort of love if any fellowship
[55:07] of the spirit
[55:08] if any vows and mercies
[55:11] fulfill you my joy that ye be
[55:14] like-minded having the same love
[55:18] being of one accord and of one mind
[55:21] now this scripture here this is an
[55:24] admonition now to a life that has really
[55:28] been redeemed when we're redeemed we no
[55:31] longer want our own choice
[55:34] we want his choice we want his leading
[55:37] and when the word is put before us it is
[55:40] a standard it's that which we are
[55:43] reaching for
[55:45] or were yielding to and saying god
[55:48] be it unto me we've become so so aware
[55:51] of this part
[55:52] it's already in our nature but god makes
[55:55] us aware of these things
[55:57] in this time how can there be
[56:00] a like-mindedness how can there be the
[56:03] same love
[56:04] being of one accord and of one mind how
[56:06] can this
[56:07] be as paul is speaking of discomfort
[56:11] any fellowship of the spirit it can't be
[56:14] unless
[56:15] there's a like-mindedness how can
[56:18] how how can this like-mindedness be is
[56:21] it a man that gets everybody together
[56:23] and
[56:23] now we're just going to brainwash people
[56:26] not at all
[56:26] this is why it takes the holy spirit
[56:30] and every life just coming into that
[56:32] admonition
[56:33] giving their life to the lord let me
[56:35] just say it very personally
[56:36] as the word is coming forth not just in
[56:39] this service
[56:40] as you're reading in the scriptures as
[56:42] you're listening to the message
[56:44] it's really giving yourself to the word
[56:48] when you do that the effect is a
[56:51] like-mindedness
[56:53] because the word will produce the word
[56:58] so this isn't something we sat down and
[57:00] we're gonna have a class and let's all
[57:02] think the same and let's no this is a
[57:04] work of almighty god
[57:07] this is why paul would say in romans 12
[57:09] 16
[57:10] be of the same mind one toward another
[57:14] in romans 15 5 now the god of patience
[57:18] and consolation that's comfort grant you
[57:21] to be like-minded one toward
[57:23] another according to christ jesus notice
[57:27] these are things that when you read this
[57:29] here this should be something that we
[57:32] esteem we pray we say god
[57:35] grant among us lord there's a real
[57:38] like-mindedness
[57:39] because you see he says that ye may with
[57:42] one mind
[57:43] and one mouth glorify god even the
[57:46] father of our lord jesus christ
[57:48] so that we're saying the same thing
[57:51] this is this is the desire because where
[57:54] there is division
[57:55] there's no unity where there's no unity
[57:59] there's no power is that right
[58:02] before the holy ghost ever came
[58:05] on the day of pentecost the bible says
[58:08] they were in
[58:09] one mind and one accord
[58:12] what brought that unity prior to the
[58:16] holy ghost coming
[58:17] was the vindicated word of the hour
[58:21] and the disciples who were sad now here
[58:24] they are
[58:25] the word comes and begins to gather them
[58:28] and as the word is revealing itself that
[58:31] indeed
[58:32] the word has been fulfilled it brings
[58:35] them
[58:36] into a place that does this promise that
[58:39] now is for us of the holy ghost and what
[58:42] did they become
[58:43] centered on they did not become centered
[58:45] upon
[58:46] one another they became centered on the
[58:49] vindicated word
[58:51] that was in their midst oh my when they
[58:54] got their eyes on him
[58:56] completely on him away
[58:59] from all of their cells there was an
[59:02] expectation that they entered into that
[59:05] upper road
[59:06] there's no doubt they were in tighter
[59:08] quarters than they had
[59:10] ever been it wasn't a comfortable spot
[59:13] there was 120 that were gathered there
[59:16] they once spread out like you and i but
[59:19] you know what
[59:20] it didn't matter they were there
[59:23] under the commandment of the word
[59:26] and they had an expectation a day when
[59:29] you get our eyes
[59:30] off the things of the world and we have
[59:33] our thighs on the things of god
[59:35] brother this is the product there is a
[59:39] light
[59:39] mindedness
[59:42] because this is not the work of man this
[59:44] is not brochure
[59:46] sent out and said okay let every baptist
[59:48] church preach the same thing
[59:50] we'll deliver it in your mailbox and and
[59:52] you read through everything
[59:53] that ain't how god runs this program the
[59:56] same god that had paul
[59:57] preaching that reality of jesus christ
[1:00:00] is the same god
[1:00:02] that gave it to peter and when they met
[1:00:04] up having never seen one another
[1:00:06] they were preaching the same gospel
[1:00:09] whether god is the one who's over his
[1:00:12] church
[1:00:13] it's god that brings about a real
[1:00:16] like-mindedness in unity
[1:00:18] and speaking the same thing it should be
[1:00:20] a reality in our life
[1:00:22] that if the enemy would rise up we ought
[1:00:24] to save the same faith
[1:00:26] get behind me devil loose my sister
[1:00:29] loose my brother heal my sister heal my
[1:00:32] brother
[1:00:33] it ought to be a same mind why we're
[1:00:36] looking
[1:00:37] at the living god
[1:00:42] this is why paul this was this would see
[1:00:45] you see
[1:00:45] the enemy's objective is to try to bring
[1:00:49] division he'll use anything
[1:00:52] he'll use anything because you see when
[1:00:54] thoughts themselves start going
[1:00:56] as though well
[1:01:00] well if they only seen it like i see it
[1:01:02] if they don't right there that's
[1:01:03] division
[1:01:04] that's the vision boy if they got to
[1:01:06] what maybe they need to get our pastors
[1:01:08] tapes or they need to get brother satan
[1:01:09] no no they
[1:01:10] no no nobody has any exclusive on the
[1:01:13] holy ghost
[1:01:15] are you with me the holy ghost it's the
[1:01:17] same holy ghost
[1:01:18] moving throughout the bride body god has
[1:01:21] not entrusted it to one man upon this
[1:01:23] earth
[1:01:24] to keep the bride in line there's not
[1:01:26] one man that the bride
[1:01:27] oh right now upon the earth the man the
[1:01:29] bride's got to go listen to this man
[1:01:31] god has sent his messenger the message
[1:01:34] has come
[1:01:35] and the same god who sent the messenger
[1:01:38] with the message is the same god that's
[1:01:41] here
[1:01:42] confirming that message in the hearts of
[1:01:44] his children
[1:01:45] and making it live
[1:01:48] [Music]
[1:01:50] a lot of things around us pardon me for
[1:01:52] taking it off
[1:01:53] this time but you know there are a lot
[1:01:55] of things around us to try to
[1:01:57] to try to break and distract this is why
[1:02:00] friends we need the discernment of the
[1:02:02] holy ghost
[1:02:03] you can't face this world without the
[1:02:06] discernment of the holy ghost
[1:02:08] you get away from the word you get away
[1:02:10] from your discernment
[1:02:12] because we are called to discern that
[1:02:15] knoweth now we stand here to say
[1:02:17] we're not gonna give the devil one inch
[1:02:22] this is why paul is even right about
[1:02:24] this even in the corinthian church
[1:02:26] he said in first corinthians 1 10 i
[1:02:28] beseech your brethren by the name of our
[1:02:30] lord jesus christ
[1:02:31] that you all speak the same thing and
[1:02:33] that there be no divisions among you
[1:02:35] that you be perfectly joined together in
[1:02:37] the same mind
[1:02:38] and in the same judgment for it hath
[1:02:40] been declared unto me
[1:02:42] of you my brethren by them which are the
[1:02:44] house of chloe
[1:02:45] that there are contentions among you and
[1:02:48] it goes on
[1:02:49] you know some are saying i'm a palm
[1:02:50] apollos i'm a cephas and
[1:02:52] i'm of christ i just stay home is christ
[1:02:54] divided has paul crucified for you
[1:02:57] or were you baptized in the name of
[1:02:59] christ or paul
[1:03:01] you see paul is identifying
[1:03:04] this division
[1:03:07] division tears down unity it removes
[1:03:11] power you say something if the holy
[1:03:15] ghost
[1:03:16] is inside of you you can't rest
[1:03:19] until you're united in brotherhood
[1:03:24] you might have to wait for somebody to
[1:03:26] simmer down but your heart
[1:03:27] there's a longing in your heart that you
[1:03:30] don't want
[1:03:31] anything in there it's to restore
[1:03:34] broken fellowship where did that come
[1:03:37] from
[1:03:38] that didn't come from our genes brother
[1:03:41] our genes ain't that strong
[1:03:44] our genes hope sometimes can remember
[1:03:46] certain things
[1:03:47] we can have certain feelings of
[1:03:49] disagreement but
[1:03:50] god himself when man had stepped over
[1:03:53] the line
[1:03:54] and disbelieved the word and went out
[1:03:57] in unbelief god himself came down
[1:04:01] in a time where he could have condemned
[1:04:03] man but he spoke out
[1:04:05] i'll make a way back for you
[1:04:09] a longing in his heart to be united with
[1:04:12] his children
[1:04:17] hallelujah you see there were some
[1:04:19] evidently when you read this in the book
[1:04:21] of philippians
[1:04:22] there evidently was you know a few i
[1:04:24] don't know
[1:04:26] this here in verse 2 these two name
[1:04:29] two names forgive me for not being able
[1:04:30] to really pronounce them right but i
[1:04:32] want to butcher them but
[1:04:33] paul called them right out i beseech you
[1:04:35] that
[1:04:36] they be of the same mind in the lord
[1:04:39] evidence they were kind of
[1:04:40] had their own little separate things
[1:04:43] hello
[1:04:44] see that's the enemy to try to get
[1:04:46] things isolated
[1:04:50] where oh my if they could only see the
[1:04:53] message worth the way
[1:04:54] the way i'm seeing it
[1:04:57] if the way you're seeing it is making
[1:04:59] you feel a little bit higher
[1:05:00] i don't want to see it that way because
[1:05:04] when i realize this
[1:05:05] you're looking above greatness
[1:05:08] i don't want to see it that way i i want
[1:05:10] to see it in the turn the reality
[1:05:13] of greatness because when you really see
[1:05:15] the word
[1:05:16] for what it is and when the word is
[1:05:18] revealed it don't make you feel like a
[1:05:20] stuffed shirt
[1:05:21] as a matter of fact when god comes down
[1:05:23] it's such a humility to stretch your
[1:05:26] heart
[1:05:26] not just for him revealing himself but
[1:05:28] it challenges
[1:05:30] our life and it examines our lives
[1:05:33] there's things that as it comes over we
[1:05:34] can say
[1:05:35] god forgive me why because the word as
[1:05:38] it's being revealed
[1:05:39] is a molding and a shaping of our
[1:05:42] character and we realize
[1:05:44] we didn't give ourselves this
[1:05:47] understanding
[1:05:52] so in order for this same mind it
[1:05:54] requires a submitting
[1:05:56] to one another we're not talking about
[1:05:58] submitting to sin
[1:05:59] we're talking about as submitting
[1:06:02] yourselves to one another in the fear
[1:06:05] of the lord
[1:06:08] so this display of character notice how
[1:06:11] paul would write it
[1:06:12] goes on in philippians 2 3 let nothing
[1:06:15] be done through
[1:06:16] strife or vainglory that that's through
[1:06:18] a boastfulness or to try to put
[1:06:19] somebody's self forward
[1:06:21] but in loneliness of mind let each
[1:06:24] esteem other
[1:06:25] better than themselves
[1:06:28] look not every man on his own things but
[1:06:30] every man also on the things of others
[1:06:34] lowliness of mind that means to have a
[1:06:37] humble opinion of oneself
[1:06:42] i i know we all like to think we've got
[1:06:44] that
[1:06:47] but we don't
[1:06:50] there's things that we steal within our
[1:06:52] lives is still bringing that in
[1:06:54] it's objection it's it's daily friends
[1:06:58] listen it never gets to a spot to where
[1:07:01] this
[1:07:01] isn't there this is the admonition of
[1:07:04] the word because as long as we're
[1:07:06] walking
[1:07:06] in these bodies it's gonna have to be
[1:07:09] brought
[1:07:10] subject to the word you realize even
[1:07:13] when you feel like
[1:07:14] somebody's a little wrong remember how
[1:07:16] the prophet brought it he said you feel
[1:07:18] like somebody's a little wrong
[1:07:19] he said don't let anything set in your
[1:07:23] heart
[1:07:23] at that time they might be wrong
[1:07:26] but don't set in your heart and let
[1:07:28] anything set in that
[1:07:30] my goodness how could they not see this
[1:07:31] or how could they not but just
[1:07:33] pray for him because to know that it's
[1:07:35] god's grace to you
[1:07:38] is that right yeah look at this paul
[1:07:41] would
[1:07:41] bob would have steamed this here you
[1:07:43] know about one's littleness in ephesians
[1:07:46] four
[1:07:46] he said i therefore the prisoner of the
[1:07:48] lord beseech you that you walk worthy of
[1:07:50] the vocation wherewith
[1:07:51] you're called with all lowliness
[1:07:55] and meekness and what meekness is to
[1:07:57] give place
[1:07:59] give place with long suffering for
[1:08:03] bearing one another in love boy these
[1:08:05] are scriptures that
[1:08:07] this part right here wow and
[1:08:09] everything's on the mountaintop
[1:08:10] everybody's agreeing with us everybody's
[1:08:12] going these aren't made manifest
[1:08:14] right but in order for bear somebody in
[1:08:17] love
[1:08:18] there's got to be something that you've
[1:08:20] got to forbear
[1:08:24] we wouldn't esteem that is the glorious
[1:08:26] thing boy that ain't the same as walking
[1:08:28] on the water
[1:08:30] but it requires the same humility
[1:08:34] it requires the same greatness
[1:08:39] remember there were many times where
[1:08:41] they
[1:08:42] said things about him pressured on him
[1:08:45] pressed him the bible says the
[1:08:48] imminently
[1:08:49] that he would say something jesus
[1:08:53] removed himself and went out of their
[1:08:55] midst jesus
[1:08:56] never felt obligated to debate anybody
[1:09:01] or to prove anything to anybody he
[1:09:04] didn't have to prove nothing because
[1:09:05] it it ain't something where you've got
[1:09:07] to prove something to a believer
[1:09:09] well i have to do this or no no no no
[1:09:11] greatness itself
[1:09:13] god makes himself known
[1:09:16] in simplicity notice this notice with
[1:09:18] loneliness
[1:09:19] and meekness with long suffering for
[1:09:21] bearing one another in love
[1:09:23] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:09:26] spirit
[1:09:26] in the bond of peace so this is not just
[1:09:29] something that just says
[1:09:30] well you know what listen i tell you
[1:09:32] what sarasara
[1:09:34] this is just going to happen i mean
[1:09:35] we're all believers
[1:09:37] paul didn't write it that way paul wrote
[1:09:39] it that here we are to endeavor
[1:09:42] be diligent to exert oneself
[1:09:45] to present oneself in a way for what for
[1:09:47] what cause
[1:09:48] for the unity of the spirit in the bond
[1:09:52] of peace
[1:09:54] brother branham would say it this way in
[1:09:55] my new ministry he said greatness
[1:09:58] as he's talking about greatness because
[1:10:00] he speaks of how john here john the
[1:10:02] baptist steps out
[1:10:03] clothed with the you know
[1:10:06] camels you know and the hair around him
[1:10:09] and yet god said there's never been one
[1:10:14] greater solomon
[1:10:18] was a great one on and on we could go
[1:10:21] david and on and on
[1:10:23] but here was john and john steps out
[1:10:26] as the messenger of the covenant to
[1:10:28] introduce the messiah
[1:10:31] he's yielded to that word and he stands
[1:10:34] right there
[1:10:35] and god called that greatness
[1:10:40] but it didn't look great according to
[1:10:41] the world
[1:10:43] because you see worldly pride
[1:10:46] it'll search out for what's the most
[1:10:49] beautiful place i can go
[1:10:51] what and it looks for beauty
[1:10:54] where does that come from that first
[1:10:56] birth
[1:10:58] satan is in beauty
[1:11:03] not godly beauty that which is
[1:11:06] sinful beauty that which attracts
[1:11:10] based on just the outside without
[1:11:13] substance it should be the
[1:11:16] substance on the inside that attracts
[1:11:21] you see this is why if it's just well
[1:11:23] just the beauty of the church then they
[1:11:25] got to have beautiful
[1:11:26] programs gotta have a beautiful pastor
[1:11:29] in this day and age you know you gotta
[1:11:32] have you gotta you know he just gotta
[1:11:33] speak just so and
[1:11:34] the guy can't sweat and everything else
[1:11:36] puts me out it just all these things
[1:11:38] gotta be just so and this and that and
[1:11:40] everything else
[1:11:41] you see what it is it's got to keep it
[1:11:42] up but when
[1:11:44] it is the very beauty of jesus christ
[1:11:47] it's
[1:11:47] not about how together how things look
[1:11:50] i'm not saying that you don't have a
[1:11:51] nice place
[1:11:52] i'm saying that it comes down there's a
[1:11:54] substance on the
[1:11:56] inside it's like when a man marries a
[1:12:00] woman if it's
[1:12:00] just because if she's displaying herself
[1:12:03] in a way
[1:12:04] that's what she's going to attract
[1:12:07] are you with me that's why it's got to
[1:12:09] be a real
[1:12:10] jesus on the inside a real god on the
[1:12:15] inside
[1:12:16] it's god that attracts his people my
[1:12:19] sheep
[1:12:20] know my voice hallelujah because the man
[1:12:24] he's
[1:12:24] marrying that character that's right
[1:12:27] this outside
[1:12:28] it'll fade it'll get old and everything
[1:12:31] else
[1:12:32] but there's a character that's the real
[1:12:34] person
[1:12:35] that you're united to oh i feel like
[1:12:38] preacher
[1:12:39] i'm telling them that there's hard times
[1:12:41] it comes there's
[1:12:42] tests and trials there's things
[1:12:44] sometimes that don't look so good
[1:12:47] but here is jesus in the midst of it all
[1:12:50] and brother dave he's sweeter tonight
[1:12:53] than he ever was
[1:12:55] he's more precious tonight i'm more in
[1:12:58] love with him tonight
[1:13:00] than i was at first why because we're
[1:13:03] united
[1:13:04] with the real character of jesus christ
[1:13:12] hallelujah and this is real greatness
[1:13:16] greatness brother brown puts it like
[1:13:17] this he says
[1:13:19] greatness that's a great person that'll
[1:13:23] take the blame for everything
[1:13:28] just say help me jesus
[1:13:32] because you know we want to give our
[1:13:33] side of it
[1:13:35] somebody has said something i mean we
[1:13:37] want to give our sign we've got to
[1:13:39] justify ourselves now i'm not saying
[1:13:40] there isn't time to justify ourselves
[1:13:42] but sometimes we're put in situations
[1:13:45] and we can either just because sometimes
[1:13:48] even when you try to justify yourself
[1:13:50] you you really look like the guilty part
[1:13:54] what would it be better to do well if
[1:13:55] you try to justify yourself
[1:13:57] then how all of this comes out it'd be
[1:13:59] better just to take the blame and say
[1:14:01] just let it pass on the blame for what
[1:14:05] it ain't about you it's the body
[1:14:08] he took the blame greatness took the
[1:14:10] blame
[1:14:12] for the body this is why paul said in
[1:14:16] romans 12 3
[1:14:17] for i say through the grace given unto
[1:14:19] me to every man that is among you
[1:14:21] not to think of himself more highly
[1:14:25] than he ought to think but to think
[1:14:28] soberly in other words feet on the
[1:14:31] ground
[1:14:33] according as god hath dealt to every man
[1:14:36] the measure of faith
[1:14:37] who dealt who dealt to man god
[1:14:41] what measure of faith we're talking
[1:14:42] about we're not talking about your faith
[1:14:44] we're talking about the faith of the son
[1:14:46] of god
[1:14:48] it's that faith that paul said i live by
[1:14:51] and
[1:14:52] that faith the love of god is what
[1:14:55] pushes our faith
[1:15:00] so who who dealt it to us he did
[1:15:03] this is how we think soberly
[1:15:08] not to think more highly of ourselves
[1:15:10] than we ought to think
[1:15:12] brother brown puts it so simple he says
[1:15:14] you know
[1:15:16] if you want to know how great you are go
[1:15:19] get a bucket of water
[1:15:21] and put your finger down in the water
[1:15:23] and pull it out
[1:15:26] and you won't see where you put your
[1:15:27] finger in
[1:15:30] because we're nothing amen
[1:15:34] hallelujah god don't need us no
[1:15:37] we need him amen you see how the spirit
[1:15:40] of pride
[1:15:41] works in the last days i am
[1:15:44] rich and have need
[1:15:48] of nothing they believe
[1:15:52] they reach the apex they have cut a hold
[1:15:56] of everything of what it was all about i
[1:15:58] don't have need of nothing
[1:16:00] but the sad part about it is they're
[1:16:02] deceived
[1:16:04] every day of our life we have need of
[1:16:07] god
[1:16:09] we have need of god i don't care how
[1:16:12] beautiful the church is
[1:16:13] i don't care how wonderful the preaching
[1:16:15] we need
[1:16:17] him we need the holy ghost to come down
[1:16:20] and change lives we need the holy ghost
[1:16:23] to come
[1:16:24] and perform his word we need the spirit
[1:16:27] of god
[1:16:27] to move down in our life and mold our
[1:16:30] character
[1:16:31] and bring us in a place where we walk in
[1:16:33] humility
[1:16:34] not with our chest stuck out and our
[1:16:37] nose up in the air
[1:16:38] but we walk with humility to know it's
[1:16:41] god's grace that revealed this truth to
[1:16:44] me
[1:16:47] be conscious he says of your of how
[1:16:50] little you are now i want to just
[1:16:52] let me just deal with this just a just a
[1:16:54] fraction of a moment
[1:16:55] be conscious of how little you are i'm
[1:16:58] not talking about
[1:17:01] the words that daddy ran you down by i'm
[1:17:03] not talking about what mama said or the
[1:17:04] teacher
[1:17:05] or somebody else that puts you down that
[1:17:07] ain't what we're talking about
[1:17:09] because that ain't truth
[1:17:12] are you with me you may not have been
[1:17:14] and been an engineer but you ain't dumb
[1:17:15] as a box of rocks
[1:17:17] is that all right you see there's a lot
[1:17:19] of things you could heard
[1:17:21] in your life it ain't true
[1:17:24] but being conscious of how little you
[1:17:27] are is to recognize
[1:17:29] our need of god it's not
[1:17:32] focusing on our weaknesses well i'm not
[1:17:35] good at this i'm not going
[1:17:36] that's not be you're being conscious of
[1:17:38] the wrong faith it's to be conscious
[1:17:40] of how little we are i don't care if
[1:17:43] you're the smartest person
[1:17:44] i don't care if you're the most educated
[1:17:46] the richest it's
[1:17:47] to be conscious of how little
[1:17:51] we are and that doesn't always mean
[1:17:54] walking around and saying
[1:17:55] i'm so little i'm so little because
[1:17:57] sometimes people say that and they
[1:17:59] are not telling the truth they don't
[1:18:01] believe it no more than anything
[1:18:05] are you with me oh i'm just the least
[1:18:07] now sometimes
[1:18:08] listen friends there's a reality is it
[1:18:10] that we want to look at that in the
[1:18:12] right way
[1:18:13] it's not looking down on ourselves but
[1:18:15] to recognize
[1:18:16] we are in need of god's amazing grace
[1:18:21] when paul could say how god came into
[1:18:24] this world
[1:18:25] to save sinners of whom i am chiefest
[1:18:28] paul looked at his life
[1:18:29] he didn't deserve what god had done for
[1:18:32] him matter of fact he said i
[1:18:34] blasphemed in ignorance he didn't
[1:18:36] deserve the mercy of god
[1:18:37] but god said the ribbon paul said the
[1:18:40] reason god
[1:18:41] did it that way not only was i in his
[1:18:43] thinking and his choosing
[1:18:45] but it was a pattern of the salvation of
[1:18:48] god
[1:18:49] that would go forth to others to
[1:18:51] recognize
[1:18:52] that a life can say i might have went
[1:18:55] too far
[1:18:56] but it can't go further then the grace
[1:18:58] of god can reach
[1:19:00] down and deliver it
[1:19:03] that's a real pattern that god
[1:19:07] paul's life
[1:19:11] hallelujah so he says
[1:19:15] brother says you know don't try to be
[1:19:18] you know you try to be a little
[1:19:19] something but be what you are
[1:19:22] i mean god made you what you are he
[1:19:24] wants you to be you
[1:19:25] and once you be like nobody else just be
[1:19:28] you
[1:19:34] be who god made you to be
[1:19:37] paul said i am what i am by the grace of
[1:19:40] god
[1:19:43] now that don't mean we walk around
[1:19:44] saying well i've always been stubborn i
[1:19:46] guess i'll just discover it no no no you
[1:19:47] taking that way too far
[1:19:50] we're talking about being little being
[1:19:53] yielded
[1:19:54] in the hands of god to say god i need
[1:19:56] you
[1:20:01] luke 18 9.
[1:20:07] jesus he gives this example
[1:20:10] he spoke a parable unto certain
[1:20:14] which trusted in themselves
[1:20:17] that they were righteous and despised
[1:20:20] others
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:24] these are the kind of people you don't
[1:20:25] want to have coffee with
[1:20:29] they'll pick you apart
[1:20:32] they'll let you know the scripture that
[1:20:35] you got wrong
[1:20:36] they'll finish a quote for you or you
[1:20:38] understand what i'm saying
[1:20:40] it's they were righteous but they
[1:20:44] despised others
[1:20:45] this cannot be the righteousness of god
[1:20:48] this is self-made righteousness
[1:20:53] it's a homemade recipe two men
[1:20:56] went up into the temple to pray the one
[1:21:00] a pharisee
[1:21:01] and the other a publican wow to contrast
[1:21:05] huh
[1:21:06] the pharisee stood and prayed thus with
[1:21:09] himself
[1:21:10] that's right because god went with him
[1:21:13] god i thank thee that i am not
[1:21:17] as other men are what a time of prayer
[1:21:21] bragging to god at least i'm not like
[1:21:24] this one and i'm not like that one lord
[1:21:26] i'm not like the rest of the people down
[1:21:28] there have believers spoken word
[1:21:30] tabernacle
[1:21:31] god i thank you don't worry god ain't
[1:21:35] even in the in the prayer room and you
[1:21:36] ain't even made it to the throne
[1:21:39] oh my the pharisee stood and prayed thus
[1:21:42] with himself
[1:21:43] god i thank thee that i am not as other
[1:21:46] men are
[1:21:47] extortioners unjust adulterers
[1:21:50] or even as this publican i
[1:21:53] fast twice in the week i give tithes of
[1:21:56] all that i possess
[1:22:05] and the publican standing afar off would
[1:22:10] not
[1:22:10] lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
[1:22:13] but smote upon his breath saying god
[1:22:17] be merciful to me a sinner
[1:22:23] be merciful to me i tell you this man
[1:22:26] went down to his house
[1:22:28] justified rather than the other for
[1:22:31] everyone that
[1:22:32] exalteth himself shall be abased
[1:22:36] and he that humbleth himself shall be
[1:22:40] exalted
[1:22:43] you see things that we look at sometimes
[1:22:46] even in
[1:22:47] thoughts and thoughts sometimes of pride
[1:22:49] and listen these are things sometimes
[1:22:51] that we look at that
[1:22:52] it can run it can run different even in
[1:22:55] lines maybe some things that
[1:22:57] you know you've been through and it can
[1:22:58] also run sometimes with different
[1:23:00] strains and
[1:23:01] and so forth where there's things that
[1:23:03] maybe for some they have to watch over
[1:23:04] this a little bit more and others
[1:23:06] in this way but in all things we need to
[1:23:09] watch over it and guard it with the
[1:23:10] grace of god
[1:23:12] i believe god speaks to us in this way
[1:23:14] to help us to be able
[1:23:15] to to further understand to be on guard
[1:23:18] to
[1:23:18] to be ready to endeavor to say lord help
[1:23:21] me lord
[1:23:22] to catch that because the very moment
[1:23:24] brother brown tells like this he said
[1:23:26] the very moment you get puffed up
[1:23:27] is the very moment god pulls back
[1:23:31] so when we we look at this here
[1:23:33] sometimes it's things where
[1:23:35] complexes complexes can can develop
[1:23:38] brother graham says you know he says the
[1:23:39] blood of jesus christ will never give
[1:23:41] you a complex
[1:23:43] education learning knowledge
[1:23:46] that can bring complexes and so when we
[1:23:49] look at this sometimes he says
[1:23:51] it can move in a complex of i'm a little
[1:23:53] bit bigger than somebody else i'm a
[1:23:55] little bit better than somebody else and
[1:23:57] i know a little bit more than somebody
[1:23:59] else
[1:24:01] notice how paul would put this here and
[1:24:03] let me just try to bring this down to a
[1:24:05] close
[1:24:06] in romans 12 16 he says picking up the
[1:24:08] same scripture
[1:24:09] now he says mind not high things
[1:24:14] but congdon sinned to men
[1:24:17] of low estate now paul's not speaking of
[1:24:22] men who you know where you go out and
[1:24:24] you're mixing with the world and
[1:24:26] partaking of the world that's not what
[1:24:27] he's speaking
[1:24:29] this term of low estate would deal with
[1:24:31] things of
[1:24:33] humility those that may be uh maybe
[1:24:36] would be of a
[1:24:37] of a lower state or or wherein they're
[1:24:39] in a situation of maybe
[1:24:41] depressed or in grief or they're in
[1:24:43] sickness paul would write of this
[1:24:45] he talks about of how that when they
[1:24:47] were cast down it means the same thing
[1:24:49] when they were in a state of needing to
[1:24:51] be comforted
[1:24:52] god sent titus to them and it was
[1:24:56] comfort to them when they were cast down
[1:24:59] so what a challenge to my not high
[1:25:01] things because
[1:25:02] as we said when paul would write these
[1:25:04] things it would speak even as he said
[1:25:06] let a man not think more highly of
[1:25:08] himself than he ought to think
[1:25:10] so there's a things that we have to keep
[1:25:12] in regards and say lord
[1:25:14] help me now remember as we've looked
[1:25:15] ahead and just stepped
[1:25:17] you know stepped into it for a little
[1:25:18] bit god has also provided for you and i
[1:25:21] knowing that a time we need divine
[1:25:24] assistance to keep ourselves
[1:25:26] in a place where god can use us there's
[1:25:28] a part of it there's a measure of it
[1:25:30] that god gives to you and i to keep
[1:25:32] ourselves humble that we would say lord
[1:25:34] help me not to rise above that
[1:25:35] but yet god as he would to paul he would
[1:25:38] give and there would be a messenger of
[1:25:40] satan to buffet him
[1:25:42] lest he should be exalted now how that
[1:25:45] god
[1:25:45] god determines that i don't know how
[1:25:47] that god looks at it and says uh you
[1:25:49] know what
[1:25:50] this very thing right now paul's
[1:25:51] eyesight it's got to go out right now
[1:25:53] why to
[1:25:54] keep him in that place of looking up to
[1:25:56] me god knows that i'm glad
[1:25:57] i'm glad it's not up to me i'm glad that
[1:26:00] god's entrusted us
[1:26:01] there's a desire in our heart to keep
[1:26:03] ourselves humble lord
[1:26:04] help me stay humble help me to recognize
[1:26:07] when a wrong thought would come in
[1:26:09] help me lord not to look down if there's
[1:26:11] something that maybe
[1:26:12] somebody else doesn't see help me not to
[1:26:15] look down on them i want you to
[1:26:16] understand this
[1:26:17] there's times sometimes where maybe
[1:26:19] someone has stood and whether it's been
[1:26:20] here
[1:26:21] or somewhere else and i can hear maybe
[1:26:23] something being ministered and i realize
[1:26:25] oh
[1:26:25] they haven't read this yet or they
[1:26:27] haven't read this quote they haven't
[1:26:28] seen
[1:26:29] where the prophet has brought these
[1:26:30] things together so that they're not two
[1:26:33] separate points anymore
[1:26:34] but you know what i don't know i don't
[1:26:36] wait to be in the service and pull the
[1:26:38] individual side and say hey let me tell
[1:26:40] you this let me tell you this if god
[1:26:42] permits that opportunity to come with
[1:26:45] that brother
[1:26:45] then at that time i would be able to
[1:26:48] share with that brother
[1:26:49] hey have you seen this in the message
[1:26:51] have you seen this right here
[1:26:53] have you seen this have you seen where
[1:26:54] brother braham says this and begin to
[1:26:56] speak of in a way and i've done it that
[1:26:58] way
[1:26:59] by the grace of god many times sometimes
[1:27:01] i just come back
[1:27:02] right back around and realize god gives
[1:27:04] grace and i have to stand here and
[1:27:05] correct it
[1:27:06] without putting any light on anybody
[1:27:09] it don't mean that i'm right i'm just
[1:27:11] saying there's a standard in god's word
[1:27:13] that we're holding to there's certain
[1:27:14] things that can be preached and i can
[1:27:16] look and say well they haven't read this
[1:27:17] they haven't read that book yet
[1:27:18] they haven't heard this one more but it
[1:27:20] isn't something that i'm above anybody
[1:27:22] else
[1:27:23] their desire should be that what god has
[1:27:26] opened to our hearts
[1:27:27] that god would open it to everybody's
[1:27:30] heart
[1:27:30] and to know that god is no respecter
[1:27:34] of person and you know what regardless
[1:27:37] if i get to say something to somebody or
[1:27:39] not
[1:27:39] hey they got the same master and the
[1:27:40] same boss i do
[1:27:43] god didn't send me to correct everybody
[1:27:46] i'm so glad about that
[1:27:47] i'm glad that we can just be yield of
[1:27:50] the lord
[1:27:50] and just follow his leading mind not
[1:27:54] high things to things that would put us
[1:27:56] in the light
[1:27:58] of something that would put it out here
[1:28:01] there could be a lot of temptations even
[1:28:03] with things that's around right now that
[1:28:04] you have at your fingertips
[1:28:06] to post this or post that or pull what
[1:28:08] should i do
[1:28:09] always examine your motive and object
[1:28:15] always examine your motive and objective
[1:28:18] mind not all things mind not high things
[1:28:21] but
[1:28:22] condemned sin boy that's a big word
[1:28:24] isn't it
[1:28:25] condemned sin which means what to lower
[1:28:28] yourself
[1:28:32] where does that example come from from
[1:28:35] god
[1:28:36] that was real greatness that was
[1:28:39] displayed to you and i
[1:28:40] this is why peter would say and i'm
[1:28:42] closing
[1:28:43] likewise you're younger submit
[1:28:47] yourselves
[1:28:48] unto the elder gay all of you
[1:28:52] be subject one to another so not just
[1:28:55] young
[1:28:56] to the older but all
[1:29:00] be subject one to another that word
[1:29:03] subject doesn't mean
[1:29:05] the just way you're under no that means
[1:29:08] voluntary attitude
[1:29:12] it's voluntary for what what what's the
[1:29:14] goal
[1:29:15] unity the body
[1:29:18] friends every decision that we make
[1:29:22] it should be about the body
[1:29:25] the moment we get going in our own
[1:29:27] tracks we're losing the focus
[1:29:30] this is why the scripture says
[1:29:31] discerning
[1:29:33] the lord's body
[1:29:37] yeah all of you be subject one to
[1:29:39] another and be clothed
[1:29:40] with humility for god resisted the proud
[1:29:45] and giveth grace to the humble
[1:29:49] and then he want more grace i do
[1:29:53] i do i want more of it lord
[1:29:57] and how do how do we become recipients
[1:29:59] of it
[1:30:02] by holding at bay pride
[1:30:07] holding it at bay the bible says the
[1:30:10] fear of the lord is to
[1:30:12] hate evil pride
[1:30:17] it was hard but to hold that at day
[1:30:21] listen you can't keep a thought from
[1:30:23] coming up in your mind you understand
[1:30:24] you can't keep that thought
[1:30:27] but you can say lord forgive me
[1:30:30] even though it's not your thought but
[1:30:31] right then there lord i give no place to
[1:30:34] this here
[1:30:37] i only want you by jesus
[1:30:41] because there's only one great one among
[1:30:43] us amen that's him
[1:30:48] he's our savior he's our deliverer he's
[1:30:50] our redeemer
[1:30:51] he's to be the object of all of
[1:30:54] our worship our adoration our affection
[1:30:58] and let me say this he's in his body
[1:31:04] he's in his body may god help us
[1:31:10] heavenly father
[1:31:13] dear lord jesus
[1:31:18] lord i know that as we
[1:31:21] look upon your word look into it lord as
[1:31:25] you would speak to our hearts
[1:31:27] my lord how it challenges our lives
[1:31:33] i don't believe there's a time lord
[1:31:36] we can hear your word and our hearts and
[1:31:40] lives not be
[1:31:42] challenged
[1:31:44] your god
[1:31:47] we want lord with all that's within us
[1:31:50] as paul would admonish the believers
[1:31:53] put on charity
[1:31:56] above all things
[1:31:59] peter would write be clothed in humility
[1:32:08] lord it would be like that of a of a
[1:32:10] belt the way that it's wrote there in
[1:32:12] the scriptures
[1:32:14] one of servitude
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:18] that would be the display of greatness
[1:32:23] among the body of jesus christ
[1:32:26] lord i realize is each and every one of
[1:32:29] your children
[1:32:31] we realize lord that
[1:32:35] there's lord been times different ones
[1:32:38] lord that's
[1:32:39] passed through here lord some lord have
[1:32:43] gone on some lord may be gone back out
[1:32:46] in the world
[1:32:49] lord i know that that's at every in
[1:32:52] every assembly
[1:32:55] sometimes lord god is we're looking upon
[1:32:57] your word
[1:32:59] you've never given an exemption
[1:33:01] [Music]
[1:33:03] in a manner to say well if they're not
[1:33:07] if they're not really exhibiting a life
[1:33:09] of a real believer
[1:33:11] then this doesn't apply but quite the
[1:33:15] contrary
[1:33:15] [Music]
[1:33:17] it applies lord sometimes lord there's
[1:33:21] things
[1:33:22] lord that's very tough
[1:33:25] lord in order to hold the body together
[1:33:29] in unity
[1:33:30] it takes the holy spirit it takes hearts
[1:33:34] inclined for one promise
[1:33:37] one purpose we're looking and we're
[1:33:40] living for the coming of the lord
[1:33:43] holding lord to the message that you've
[1:33:46] given to us
[1:33:48] that which is lord given us life
[1:33:53] there's one goal that we have lord
[1:33:56] there's one purpose
[1:33:58] help us lord as we look at this we
[1:34:01] realize that lord
[1:34:03] our adversary and your adversary
[1:34:07] the enemy he's always
