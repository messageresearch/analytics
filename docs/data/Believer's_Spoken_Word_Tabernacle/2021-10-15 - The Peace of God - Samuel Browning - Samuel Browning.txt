presence is lord jesus what a faith that it renders lord a trust lord that you're going to just rest in that reality that you're present lord you've got every circumstance you have every situation you've got it in control ward lord i think of a song that was wrote i don't know how many years ago but the words of that song that course it says it like this sometimes he calms the storm other times he just calms me amen lord jesus you know what we have need of tonight it's not us lord to dictate to you what's needed we make our requests known lord to you and we trust you you know exactly what our needs are lord and father whether you calm the storm or you calm us lord we ask the lord that you would just have your way for every request that's upon the hearts of your children tonight may you lord help me that i could step out of the way and this congregation lord that father it wouldn't even be in our minds lord of of what day it is of the week but we would recognize that you're the god who does not change it doesn't matter what day of the week lord what service it is you're the same almighty god hallelujah and so lord we just invite you lord here tonight your children as we've gathered here lord and father from the cares of this day to lay it aside and to press in your lord in this moment lord because we want to have a meeting with you you know the needs in our life and you even know what lays ahead of us you know those things that lord that your grace has brought us through and and we just need to hear from you lord so we ask that god that you would help us together lord that we'd be able to step aside tonight and that right here lord in this service lord a real a supernatural lord reality o god where you are just speaking lord lip to ear to our hearts and our lives oh god our hearts would be so charged and comforted and strengthened lord that any darkness lord that's tried to cloud around our life oh god that the light of god would just press it right back lord i pray and just shining in lord with clarity and strength lord right in our lives lord with refreshing lord in your presence we pray may you just minister to every need lord god we love you and we thank you we trust you lord jesus we love you father in the precious name of jesus christ amen hallelujah amen we could just sing that on and on amen i love that song that's just such a precious song you you find yourself singing amen those songs like that in many different times when you know i think how the song we i don't know when we sing that song take the name of jesus with you did i have you sing it on sunday sunday my lord but it's true it's true you know there's so many things sometimes when when as the bible said when snares and temptations around you gather breathe that holy name in prayer you know there's times when it's when it's easy there's times when it's easy to to pray or there's times it's easy to praise but it's in those times when it's difficult times that when you just can press through and just say lord i need thee oh i need thee but samuel do you do that yeah i do that because this is this is a constant it's a constant time i need thee but say it must be when you fell on the mountain no no in the times of the valley lord i need thee and then in the times when it seems like that everything you know everything's being pointed out but i can say lord you're good you're faithful lord you're faithful in everything amen oh glory be to god let's just look into the word of the lord tonight in psalms 23 i'm going to start there i want to just move right on into this tonight and uh ask you just to be in prayer for us lord willing my mom and i are going to be traveling together i'm going to drop her off in west virginia and then i've got to keep going to north carolina i've got meetings there this weekend and so i just ask that you just just keep us in prayer god will just strengthen us and guide us for those services there and um also brother boaz romero it's been a while since brother boaz has been here but brother boaz is going to come and take the service i hear the lord willing on sunday so you just be in prayer for that and amen we'll just want to turn our attention here to the to the word of the lord we've been reading out of psalms 23 and i've got a just as a a thought out of here it's still dealing with what we were working with but i want to just really move right into that tonight and hopefully we can get to it we'll see how far we get with this but i'd like to speak on the peace of god the peace of god psalms 23 verse 1. a psalm of david the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies and thou anoint us my head with oil and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever amen may god bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i'd like to draw your attention here into verse four and we've been looking at this in the home and i just would ask you just to invite the holy spirit to say lord just bring this real personal to my heart and just allow god just to break it down because you know this as a believer that when the scripture says that this when the spirit of truth has come he will lead and guide us into all truth and there are things that you and i are aware of as believers at times when we've sat in a service or you're listening to a message you're reading out the scriptures and there are things that are spoken to your heart that are not even wrote there or that even you're not hearing in that message or you're not even hearing it by the voice of the individual that god is viewing using but yet you're hearing god speak to you and it's a way how god takes it you know just that way that god takes it to you is the same way that god will deal with a minister that sometimes there's things that you can hear and a thought just starts coming in it just starts building and god begins to press upon something that you're you begin to see something that how god just begins to press that and it now becomes a thought that god's wanting to convey in there and i know i believe that god when we're looking here in the scriptures we just invite him just to come and just speak to our hearts help me god to apply this in my own life and if there's something that needs to be said lord just guide brother samuel help him just to step out of the way that he can say things that needs to be said in verse 4 it says yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me i want you to catch this in the scripture david never said that there wouldn't be conditions around that wouldn't try to cause fear but what he said is is that i will i will fear no evil so it's around but i won't fear it but here's where he's drawing his strength to cast out fear that wants to come for thou art with me amen so and so this is the way the scripture said perfect love it cast out all fear and you see when when we look here in the scripture evil as we see this in the scripture evil is present but there is a light that is present to light up the way that's what makes it a shadow because there is light present and david he takes drawing comfort as a believer that though there are times of darkness that come i will not fear the evil because you are with me and all throughout this building here tonight we've all been in situations and and places where fear has tried to encroach upon our life and i'm talking about even as a child of god sealed with the spirit of god there's things to how the enemy can even try to come into your mind and into your spirit and try to trouble you there's things sometimes that we begin to recognize that there's some things that we've got to tune out and tune in too there's things that you know that that within it that i i just share this with you as it comes to me my wife and i i told you about a time i preached at a church there in prescott i wasn't even supposed to preach there at the latter part of that of those meetings and i'd come down and i was getting on my way to the airport and we ended up ministering there that night i told you it was so important i had no no dress clothes to even preacher then i preached in crocs and jeans and everything else now what i didn't what i wasn't aware of when we went into that church that night i didn't put two and two together that some of the prayer requests that had been offered up for even people that were dealing with covet and things like that was right there i think god because all of a sudden then when i begin to put some two and two together and you know the enemy's always there to give you two and two are you hearing me because let me just pause and say this we understand i don't even like to give it space to even deal with it but we understand it's real but it's not our master is that right we never let flu master us never let sinus never let nothing it's real we don't we we understand we're not foolish where people say oh that stuff ain't real we're not fools we are believers are you with me so we recognize within these within these things i'm just sharing something very personal with you that after we got out of that service that that night and begin to realize you know when and you start you know you start hearing things you're hearing certain people you know you're coughing and everything else going on and you're hearing different things you know we get back into the place you know the family that we are staying with and that night you know we didn't get very much sleep at all maybe about i don't know even if we did get sleep at all that night because we had to get up at 1 30 and go to the airport and turn the car in so we're laying there and i'm telling you that satan wanted to come and try to bring fear now i didn't say nothing to my wife but how the enemy was battling her that whole night she didn't get a moment's worth of sleep either and satan has come in there trying to battle within the mind look where you're at now and look where this and look where that i'm just exposing that devil and you see the thing that he was wanting to try to do was to try to bring fear you say brother samuel what did you do i looked to the lord and i began to just pray as i laid there on the bed i began to pray for my wife she was she was there sometimes in and out you know the restroom there are those couple of hours and we just begin to pray now i didn't know until the next morning here we are 1 30 in the morning on our way and then she's sitting in the car beside me and she starts testifying because when the enemy was trying to come at her she starts testifying about reading messages while she was there in the bathroom and back and forth looking up things that the prophet of god had said regarding things where fear and anxiety and things would want to try to come i tell you there's a way to meet the devil there is a place that you and i have we're not naive to say well no this ain't going to come around me as a believer no it'll come try to come around but this is where we've got to draw our strength from i will fear no evil i mean what's to fear when there's no evil around but david said thou art with me and that's where i'll draw my strength from i'll tell you what as i began to lay there and i began to pray and i said god i know you're the one that led me here i didn't even plan on this lord matter of fact when i went to went there to the finally went to church that night i wasn't planning on preaching i was planning on hearing that pastor i wanted to hear him preach you know i wasn't planning on that but i said lord you sent me here and you're the one to keep me you're the one to watch over she said what was it you were looking at it's trusting in the lord i didn't know everything and how things would come out but i knew god was in control are you hearing me you see there's times where sometimes as you're poking holes and it all of a sudden just doesn't go away what do you have to do continue to poke holes and what did you do i turned my attention by the grace of god to the lord i begin to worship i begin to thank god begin to thank him for his mercy and knowing in his keeping power and the same time that's where my wife was at and i'll tell you what we had a spell on our way back to the airport you talking about a time of fellowship she began to rehearse things she was reading i began to say things here we didn't know what was going on at that time but i could sense that spirit of anxiety and fear was wanting to come around but thanks be to god for the unspeakable gift of god to propose in that devil that's just a personal testimony and every one of us have been in round situations like that situations that come up you say brother samuel what is it that fear i think how brother ernie uh villanueva right or wrong he he you know brother ernie could come up with some acronyms he came up with fear i think i shared this with some of you brothers fear false evidence appearing real that's all right in it that'd be good for the refrigerator that'd be good for the mirror that'd be good for us to post all around you see when we look at it here because the children of god are not to be controlled by fear we're not to be controlled by fear in psalms 27 verse 1 that when we look at this david would say the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear not what whom the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid now this is here is a ruddy little man that's speaking these things so it's not the physical stature that he matches up but he's recognizing like paul could write in ephesians 6 that the light what gives him strength what does light do it exposes and pushes back darkness what does light do in our life it pushes back darkness this this is why the prophet would read this text for the rapture message because in the hour that we're living in darkness is so thick the bible said in the time of egypt it was a darkness that could be felt the bible tells us it's a gross darkness that gets upon the people where people will believe lies and spirits have so overtaken people's lives that they can't recognize truth they can't discern right from wrong where this is at it's a gross darkness the bible says in isaiah that's upon the people and if not for god's grace remember we were sometimes darkness not just in it we were darkness but now what made the difference god came on the scene now are ye light in the lord and what does that light do in your life it's not a man-made light this is not starlight this is not candlelight this is shekinah light that's what the holy ghost is and if you rest within the shekinah light of god and rest within that word it'll push out fear when it wants to encroach i don't care who you are i don't care how long you've been around you got to be real you don't fool nobody you ain't fooling god if you got to be real and that's the way god will come on the scene be honest with him if there was something i was fearful about i'd be honest with him because he already knows and i'd say lord give me strength lord is that right i mean different ones of you you know as you've been through times of surgery and things like that i've had things there in the home and things sometimes that you have to deal with and you know everything that you're going through you have the things that can be all all around but to think how david would liken it that it's light that he receives strength to cast out that fear it's the strength of the lord in his life that allows him to say of whom shall i be afraid now he said when the wicked even mine enemies my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear you catch what he's saying my heart shall not fear the war should arise against me in this will i be confident what are you going to be confident in not in what i see around me i'm going to be confident in the lord is the light of my life the lord is the strength of my life that's where i'm gonna draw my source of strength and comfort from is the things of almighty god and notice how david would speak of desiring to be in the air and he said i've desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble i want you to catch this in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me this is dealing with the innermost chamber the secret place it's dealing with god coming to reside there in the soul taking us where our lives are hidden in god through christ he will take me in the time of trouble in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall we hide me he shall set me upon a rock this ain't nothing that we do it's what he does when does he do that in the time of adversity in the time of trouble you see his closeness this is what i want you to catch from this even as we looked at the husbands and so forth his closeness his presence he does not distance himself from us but rather in times of heartache he draws near and he takes us deeper he takes us deeper is that right you see this is why in isaiah 43 1 how the lord would write and say but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by name thou art mine this understanding alone is enough to cast out fear that i didn't seek god god sought me i you know you and i could have lost lost sight of god but god never lost sight of me it wasn't me that was looking for god god came looking for me it wasn't i that you know god wasn't lost and i found him i was lost and he came and found me [Applause] is that right and this is where then fear not fear not based on that reality that this is god's working let me just say it as it comes to me this is why brother branham tells us in marriage and divorce and he speaks of that scripture whatsoever god hath joined together let no man put asunder and brother brahman says that revelation he says when that revelation that this is your spouse that's yours the rest of your life is that right it's it's an anchor it's an absolute it passes all understanding it's an anchor it's something you come back to just like in your life hey come on am i preaching now it's just like in our life when we're dealing with tests and we're dealing with trials how do you make it through the test and trial you draw from that experience on the sacred sides of god's grace you draw strength from there when it seems like all chaos and everything is around you you've got a source of strength a hidden light where you can draw strength and in your life you're able to stand there even when you don't know what's going on you don't know how things are going to turn out but you're standing there not by your own strength you're standing there by the strength of the shady eye fear not verse 2 oh my when thou passer through the waters notice not if when no wonder in the vows for better for worse these ain't disney world vows hello somebody they live happily ever after they never ever had any argument or as brother john lafontaine said he did fellowship but you see what brings happiness what brings joy it depends on the resource you draw from the things of this world is temporal are you hearing me if you try to live on the things of this world and bring that into your marriage it's temporal you you are meant and built to live and there's one place that you can actually be satisfied and that's not that's in the lord the lord is my shepherd and i shall not want it's there's no way let me just say this to you there's no way i can meet the need and everyone and for my little darling sitting right there there's no way she can meet the need for me of everything she's a great help she's a great comfort but you see that relationship that i have with the lord by the grace of god that's where i draw strength that when adversity comes up that when misunderstandings arise that when situations come that though she can stand there and comfort me with the word of the lord but i've got to have that comforter myself i've got to have that experience that i'm drawing strength from in the lord is that all right because she's not my personal walk with jesus neither am i her personal walk with jesus amen i might be her husband or pastor and everything but i'm not her personal walk with jesus she has to have her own personal walk i'm not her victory she has to have victory in jesus are you with me but it sure helps when i have victory [Music] oh let's finish this scripture when thou passeth through the waters i will be with thee lord you mean you just can't make the waters go away lord i'd like the waters parted god's letting them know i parted them before i'm part of them again but you have to walk through them through the rivers they shall not overflow thee all right look can we just go around them no but i'm telling you they will not overflow you when thou walk us through the fire wonder if them hebrew boys was fellowshipping on this one hallelujah when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee did it happen or not it happened everyone on the red sea the jordan there when they stood in the fiery furnace it shows that there's nothing that can overtake a believer oh my tester trial that god allows to come away but he said he is faithful to see us through he's right there with us and this is why here it would read in psalms 32 verse 1 behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as a hiding place notice a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadows of a great rock in a weary land see god makes this real it's like the little boy when his remember his mama told him brother brown tells his story in mighty gardenville before us and remember he that she's telling him junior and you know the storm is outside and you know junior we're christians and and you know we believe in the lord and and junior says your mommy i believe all that he said but in times like this i need a god with skin on it he was asking mommy to sleep by him that night you know what mommy would be the comfort for him that night it wasn't going to be the storm's getting taken away but if you come by me mommy then it don't matter what kind of thunder lightning and everything else comes around i've got a comfort that i can go to sleep and sleep like a baby oh if we would just invite jesus come on friends instead of trying to make and figure out our own problems and put them together you only make a bigger mess out of it what should i do invite jesus where do i invite him invite him to put this skin on lord you can use this skin you can use this vessel you can use this veil lord god oh my you see sometimes we're so interested that we're the one that well i've got to attend the garden but remember adam tended the garden under the leadership and the direction of god this was not his own doing his own choosing his own his own will doing that it was surrendered under the headship of god so as adam was walking under the headship of god then it would have an effect there even within his home and within there of the surroundings notice a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a dreary land and david goes on to say in psalms 23 4 thy rod and thy staff they comfort me see the guidance that comes along the way and there's also you know how it is with that shepherd's the hook or crook or whatever they call it that that little part that bends around is to reach out and sometimes when that lamb is looking the wrong way going the wrong way it has to reach right out around that and bring it back into the right way because sometimes we get to wondering about things or looking at things and sometimes the the longevity of time sometimes the longevity of things we're praying about let me say this abraham waited 25 years brother branham waited to the change of his body the healing of his stomach are you willing are you with me he kept preaching he kept pressing he kept pressing and kept looking to the lord is that right paul remember paul with his eyes he even said i besought the lord thrice take it away and god said my grace is sufficient you know paul said i'm going to quit asking for and looking looking in a manner that this is going to be completely healed i'm going to pray for healing and god healed him and then after time he would come back but in the midst of that time listen to me now in the midst of that time it was paul's attitude that invited the presence of god it's not just a given that when we're weak we're strong he said i will glory in my infirmities that the power of christ and that phrase means the tent of his dwelling hallelujah might rest upon my life that the shekinah in the midst but this happened you don't know sometimes how hard things are i think we all do and that that's one of the greatest tricks of the devil is to so isolated says oh nobody knows how you suffer nobody knows what you go through and nobody but jesus knows we may not have been through the exact same situation or the same thing but we all have tests and trials we all have pathways that we come through it doesn't help and maybe you could look at somebody else and say they ain't never been where i've been but he knows all about it and in reality he's not been in every path but he's conquered every gate because every temptation will come through one of three gates i flesh is that right thus pride of life all those things but he conquered the gates of the united states he conquered every gate because you see even as a sister sister could not say well jesus understands me jesus does not understand in that capacity but he understands as our high priest of what we go through of what it would feel like and we could come to him and he understands us he doesn't he just moves on our behalf he senses our weakness thyroid and by staff they comfort me no matter how long it is that comforts me oh my through that through that whole dark veil as paul would write in hebrews 13 5 let not your conversation be let your conversation be without covenant and be content with such things as you have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee and so that we might boldly say the lord is my helper my secure one who comes to my aid one who comes to minister to me and i will not fear what man shall do unto me notice psalms 23 5 thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over and when you look at every one of these places here in psalms 23 even in this scripture right here the enemy's not removed as far as well there's no enemy there's no evil around but quite the contrary david's aware are you with me he's aware of the evil he's aware of the enemy but his focus is not on the enemy or the evil his focus is is thou has prepared a table for me amen in the very presence of mine enemy thou anointest my head with oil you know when they anoint them with oil it's to keep all the parasites and the bugs and things like that i'm going to say god i need my head anointed to keep out all them lying thoughts and those things that want to try to come in i need my head anointed with oil oh brother samuel i've got the anointing oil in my soul thank god for that but we need also the anointing of the holy spirit even in our minds that's our responsibility to keep that in our lives like we've been looking at that in the courts is that right sometimes people wonder why they don't have peace what kind of things are you listening to what are you reading amen we've got to filter in this hour oh brother samuel you're saying i should be i need i'm saying you should be wise if there's things that's troubling you and bringing fear into your life and i say that you've got authority as a son and daughter of god to say you're not coming in here to be able to stand there at the door and say you're not coming in this home many times before things ever get in the home they've already got here in the mind notice this is where a strength that think of how that the bride in the song of solomon she can draw strength of knowing when she said i i can set under the shadow under his protection under his headship under his leadership with great delight what brings a comfort what brings a comfort what brings a comfort to you and i in coming here to this church and coming into a service oh is it the music that'll fade right oh it's the way you know things this is preacher that that'll fade right what is it that's to be the comfort and the strength of our life is the holy ghost the word of god you see the word it's not a letter it can be a letter but when the spirit of god comes upon that word as he has in this hour it's no longer letter it's energizing it's pulsating it's releasing strength to our life to discern present situations by an unfailing and unchanging god that lets himself lets himself be known i am with you this is where we draw strength psalm 1 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful this is a blessed man because you see the seed of the scornful is a critic looking at everything and criticizing it let me tell you something you go to criticizing things eventually that critical spirit will turn right on your family you hold everybody else in such a light and this and that eventually it'll turn right on your family it will foster criticism are you hearing me this is why when brother van tells us those little them little boys or the little kitties when they spoke to elisha and said go on up old ball head brother brown said what it was they were speaking against was the message of elijah in the message respects he said they spoke against the message of elijah where did they learn that but the band tells us their homes their homes now no not one of us likes to be picked apart anybody like to be criticized good i don't want to pray a line spirit off nobody nobody likes to be criticized you know they get this term you know they would throw it around we taught and some of you experienced in your job constructive criticism oh yeah i believe in constructive criticism but there ain't not none of us none of us including me right here loves criticism sometimes we we need it right sometimes we need it but not not we do not invite that neither do we want to make that a part of our home because within that right there it does not invite the presence of the lord there is no table prepared in the presence of the enemy there is no anointing of the head cups are not running over but rather look at this look at this this is important his delight is in the cleveland browns nope don't say that his delight is in espn his delight is in the law of the lord if the delight is in anything else it's wrong brother deals with this so clearly the love of god should be so prevailing in our hearts the holy ghost should be so prevailing in our hearts brother adam says when the church doors are open we can't wait to get in here and have fellowship with our brothers and sisters we don't only fellowship while the word is coming forth but we fellowship even as we have times afterwards to be able to you know stand and talk to one another we need that you say but samuel i don't need it well i do can you do it for me i need it right i need it how many else need it well but i'm okay with it but it's gonna be on my terms that selfishness what about when somebody else needs fellowship and encouragement it might just be extending a hand to encourage them along the way my my my i'm trying to get to the peace of god i don't know if we're going to get there tonight or not but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day in day and night you see what you feed on that's right you'll meditate on this was one of the secrets in the land in joshua 1-1 but it's also one of the areas that the devil likes to trouble the devil likes to so fill our minds and get them occupied on so many things and sometimes listen to me now sometimes there's things that you have to get on you have to get on your mind sometimes there's things you have to read through like whether it's an insurance policy or whatever it is you don't understand what i'm saying there's things sometimes or whether you want to read it or not you've got to get out the magnifying glass and read it you've got to understand it is that right and really the frustrating part comes in and saying i don't want to take no time to do that but we realize we must govern the affairs of this life lest they govern us our whole objective as a believer is to see to it that our lives do not become governed by things of this world that we've allowed to go by and then blaming on an attack of the devil instead of us taking initiative hello sometimes the devil's getting blamed for everything he said where in the world is that coming from i didn't mean that that wasn't even my fault that was just their negligence well i tell you the devil let that plumbing come loose in my house and yet you know you had a drip well the devil did this and the devil did that and the devil said lord have mercy i'm getting blood i'm getting all kinds of credit for things i didn't even do that was their negligence they knew that drip hello somebody you see there's things that we in our life is to occupy our life in a sense as a believer to say god there's no way that i can rely upon myself to try to catch everything but i can say lord help me to so order my steps that there are things when they arise that it does not come between you and me sometimes like i said there's things that come about in our life that we have to attend to there's things that sometimes we have to take time but there's seasons there's seasons seasons and notice what he shall be like he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper that's the kind of man i want to be it's kind of man i want to be it's kind of christian that we all want to be that's the kind of man i want to be to where that the roots were planted planted meaning before the foundation of the world we were already planted in god but now the reality of the holy ghost has birthed us into the body of jesus christ and our roots are tapped into a source of life rivers of water we're drawing strength well where does that strength grow it moves up through our life fruit comes forth leaves what are leaves for healings of the nations what water leaves fellowship hello somebody leaves a green speak of life fellowship leaves can blow is that right how did david know to go and to attack the army and pursue his god said when thou hear the wrestling of the wind in the mulberry tree it wasn't good enough just to have branches it had to have leaves and it was the angels that blew those leaves i believe that's how our lives are to be sensitive as paul said let brotherly love continue for some have entertained angels lives that invite the angels to come live that invite ministering spirits to come amen and to minister and to help brother samuel do i have that kind of authority you do as a son of god you have authority we have authority i have authority to live life in that place that invites the presence of god see let's go now to verse six this scripture right here is where i want to draw from here just a few moments and i'm not even going to get anywhere close but we'll start into this here surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever we not only need leadership leadership is going before us showing us the way not just somebody telling us the way but leadership is an expressed image is that right it was the evidence of life that brought leadership to the infidel as brother branham stood there life he saw the expression of god's life from that of nature tied into the healing of that woman and what was it it was life the presence of god that brought leadership for that situation so just you think how brother brandon stood there brother brown didn't go down are you listening to me brother brown didn't go down through chapters he didn't quote brother branham took something under the leading of god that that man knew about all right let me just tell you put that devil on the run that devil wants to tell you well you don't know a lot of scriptures you don't know a lot of quotes there's a lot of people can know a lot of scripture and know a lot of quotes but don't know the life i'm just going to preach it ain't about that because listen kids don't need a lecture come on now there's things that man didn't need a bible study he was already an infidel try to quote scripture to it you'd have never turned him around brother brahm didn't use quotes on him but he under the inspiration of god at that moment he had a heart for that man are you hearing me he had a heart for that man and god began to give him an example of something that was right there that god's life had been a witness season after season after season after season something he had walked by all of his life but that moment that apple tree was yielded in the hands of god that he could express the very god that would take that life down in the roots and raise it back up it became a place that the prophet can point to and say there is a god the same god that did it there is the same god that raised that woman up what was it it was the life of god giving leadership in that moment that's the seventh seal seven sealing out here in doctrine it's the coming of the lord the coming of the lord in the fullness of the holy ghost and it opens and makes the people ready for the corporal coming amen we not only need leadership remember god told it and told israel i'll go before you but then he also said when you read in the scripture how many of you read that read that word re-reward it read that in the scripture re-reward it means i've got your back i'll be right behind you so i want you to think about it god's before us and god's behind us what a place to be no place but the saying i'd rather be we could really sing that song no place brother brian i'd rather be him right behind right before us and also he's our re-reward he's the one bringing up the rear why would we need that because remember we need the goodness and the mercy of the lord because even at times as we're looking we fall short and we fail and in a home we're going to disappoint one another in a church we're going to disappoint one another preach with me now we're going to do that you know why because we're still humans sons and daughters of god but are still walking in fallen humanity our soul is in and not in a fallen condition when we've been born of the spirit of god we have the strength and the light of god on the inside praise the lord but sometimes where we have trouble is with one another's humanity and this is why we need the grace of god this is why god does not want a church that well i'm going to go to church where everybody agrees with me well maybe you're the reason they came up with clones maybe we just need to put a 3d printer in print and print a bunch of you out god don't want it that way you know why there's certain things about you that shows greenness in me there's certain things about me shows greenness in you that's right is that right well it's the truth so we need the goodness and mercy of god to follow us because we fall short many times this is where our scripture comes in that we've been looking at charity does not behave itself rudely now if you notice in that verse 5 it seeketh not her own not easily provoked thinketh no evil all of those things that are dealing with right here within charity all of this that's right here it deals with inwardly amen now the love of god will never do this but the love of god will have to correct that feeling of love in that spirit realm are you hearing me you see behavior matters to god this is why in our life god will not keep offenses out of our heart the bible said again no place to the devil god won't keep those offenses out that's for you and i will be lord that's where you and i just say lord cleanse those offenses is that right see this is where it becomes our responsibility as a priest i mean we could just preach this right in on a sunday and deal with it because there is a lot of working that takes place and must there's a continuum within our life so we need the grace of god within every part of our life i won't ask you to raise your hands but how many times you said things that you need to repent and you had to repent whether it's to your spouse or whether it's somebody or maybe you were just talking and you said you know what forgive me i should have never said that i just was get i was a little frustrated or i mean however you want to you know smooth the frosting on and i blew up sex however you want to call you know i like how brother brown says it in a message of grace brother brown's talking about the family of god and brother brahms talking about how that when god provided for israel everything he provided a prophet a pillar of fire he provided of his word god did all that according to his promise and when god when here when the lord came down and began to deal with israel begin to bring them out you find israel get to a place they started complaining where's the water right where's the food all right you just brought us out here to die didn't you now all israel didn't do that right remember there was a mixed multitude that's right but i want you to remember remind you and this right here god spoke about this people they wearied him you know why because they were complaining let me just tell you something there's a lot of things that you and i could complain about i'm preaching now there's a lot of things we could complain about there's a lot of things about one another we could complain about come on now but let me remind you what brother adam tells us in united time and sign he talks about he realizes that as he gets older there are certain things that maybe is going to make him nervous and maybe get under his skin a little bit but brother barham asked god he said i have asked god he said because a lot of times when you get older you get cranky and crabby that's what he said now here's what brother branham said brother bram didn't say you know what but i got the holy ghost so i don't have to worry about that he didn't say that he said what i've asked god he said i do not want my life crowned with that kind of a spirit he said i've asked god to crown my life with the fruits of the spirit he said you take a life that's complaining he said and complaining constantly about this complaining constantly like that he said that weakens faith complaining weakens faith if that weakens faith think about what complaining can do within a home y'all gonna be glad i'm gone this weekend huh think about what it could do you continue picking at things and picking at things and picking at things and picking at things what does that do it weakens weakens whoo we're getting somewhere now the brown said just like a husband he said takes a wife he's tying this in like a husband take a wife he says if you'll be a good woman you take care of the house you'll be true to me if you'll clean my clothes we have children you'll be a mother to them if you'll do those things i'll work till my hands bleed to make you living if you'll do it but then think what if that woman turns wrong lives lazy and won't work and won't do nothing right here in this quote we could also add another line right now what happens if that man turns lazy come on now because we know we've got enough and listen it ain't been oh this is the way it is listen that's the influences that's been sown seeds all the way on down notice then it takes grace to keep that family together brother branson said oh god it's taken grace the grace of jehovah to keep his family together it's taken what grace brother brown talks about that when they came out and how they complained and this and that but notice what god did he fed him he took care of him he loved them he moved him around what did that because they deserved it no all right brother brown said his grace did that amen his grace did that the bible says that their shoes did not wear out neither did their clothes wear bear what did that god his grace took care of them even in their times that really was not real lovable was not real in regarding or deserving and grace is not about what we deserve because if we got what we deserve but his grace did it because of his promise and the grace went with the promise of god i want you to think of this let me let me close here on just i have just about five more minutes can i take that and i'm gonna close i'll let you know when to start your watch but i want you to think of this here brother braham takes the dedication in god hiding in simplicity and revealing himself in the same there in jeffersonville when they're dedicating the tabernacle and brother brahm says this is not the true tabernacle but he speaks and he identifies clear over there in the future home of where when that new city as it sets down here upon this earth brother brown goes through that of what day we're looking forward to but brother braham he makes a statement and he says but let us so characterize our lives that we would worship here as if we were all ready once you think of that potential you see what this message does it lets you know of the potentials that lay within how can that be possible because you have received the spirit of that land and by having the spirit of that land remember a house is not the people who live in it it's the order of the family that lives there is what's called a house that's a direct quote it's the order think about it the spirit of god as it said how what did the spirit when it said i saw the spirit of god descending from heaven as a bride adorned for her husband amen what is it showing is showing that the spirit of god coming down it's characterized in that of a bride who is adorned for her husband so it's reflected it's a life that is reflected the adornment the order of that land is what we live by amen that's the bible philippians chapter 3 for our conversation meaning our constitution is in heaven and i've got a representative over there i've been brought in contact by the baptism of the holy ghost my theophanies right there your theophany's right there who got representation before the throne of god and god says you never did it in the first place what are you involved i've been brought back to the first place so let us so characterize our lives as if we're already there on the other side let me read this here in closing colossians 3 12. put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye i may not be real smart but i know this if it tells me to forebear that shows me there's going to be times i've got to forebear and there's times i got to forgive then that tells me there's times i've got to forgive there's going to be times arise it tells me there's also going to be times that there's going to be times arise samuel you're not an angel you're going to have a quarrel but even as christ forgave you so also do you and above all things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful amen let it rule let it be the umpire what let the peace of god be the absolute let it be the umpire let it be that which it sorts things out and not to allow anything to disturb peace you see for the life of a believer let me just leave you with this for life of a believer that has experienced and has received the peace of god the dove of god in their soul your life is a peacemaker [Music] that is the reality that you live from a person that likes turmoil likes to dig their heels in likes to do all this this is where they have to start to evaluate no matter how much knowledge they have of scriptures and everything else the bible said blessed are the peacemakers amen for they shall be called the children of god see the peace of god is something that comes to you and you and i experience and then our lives are filled with the peace of god and our lives are lived as believers to make peace making peace ain't compromise but neither is making peace stirring up trouble all right man i wish i had two more hours on this right now influence of another look what david said david said i placed the lord always before me how many remember that scripture i placed the lord always before me look what brother of them says that i shall not be moved moreover he said then when i do that my flesh shall rest in hope when i do what place the lord before me because i know he will not leave my soul in hell neither will he suffer his holy one to see corruption for the lord is always before me whenever wherever you go place god if a man gets angry and cusses you place god between you and him if a guy calls you a holy roller place god between you and him if the wife gets angry with you place god if the husband gets angry place god if the children aggravate you place god whatever you do place god papa mama gives you a little spanking and corrects you place god remember what god said about it bring up a child in the way it should go always remember place god put god before you and you'll have reverence for god and respects for him and you know what that translates to when you have respect for god and respect for him you'll have respect for everybody else place god what's been placed within our lives this this place and we just lord willing next thursday we'll get into it a little more the peace of god i believe i believe with all my heart that this it's god's desire that our lives it should be lives of peace yes our homes you know look there's times where we have to we have to fight the devil there's times we have to stand right there with the sword and and cutting down there's times we have to stand are you with me there's times we have to stand there and correct situations but it's not in our heart to love to correct situations if it's in your heart to love to tell people where they're wrong then something's wrong with your heart because the predominating part is the peace of god but see love will drive us to bring correction but when is received the bible says it yielded peaceable fruits right so the objective is is you want peaceable fruits so even in correction of children correction of things in the home it matters how things are corrected in order to yield peaceable fruits see this is the desire of our lives because once that peace of god has come to our life and there's there's been a peace that passes all understanding it's a peace between my god and i then the desire is is for peace because you see what happens when there's not peace the dove takes its flight but simon whose responsibility that's that's our responsibility when something arises place god amen now i want to just i close here don't allow the enemy take what the things that's been said tonight and if you let me just tell you something as a believer as a son and daughter of god let me just say this to you you've got more authority in heaven than the angels so there's no circumstance there's no situation the devil wants to bring whispers and things that would try to trouble and bring fear and oh i gotta do this and all i got a believer is not to work by anxiousness it's to be moved with the peace of god you've got authority to stand in every situation you've got authority to stand there but let the peace of god reign and be the umpire in your heart you know what i mean by that where the peace of god says that's a foul ball get that out of here you can't you can't use that attitude with this you can't see let the peace of god rule let him be the one who governs within within your life let him be the one that's there and no matter what situation arises as far as for our flesh it's more than a match for our flesh but it's not a more than a match for god over the same i believe that but maybe god wants to borrow you to prove that through and your situation in your life becomes the platform for god to step out on how many say lord you can use this platform you can use this platform lord let me be surrender let me be governed let my life be under the control of the peace of god let that be what i invite in my home let it be what i invite in my life let's pray heavenly father lord i want to say thank you for your mercy tonight would we be without you lord father i i don't know lord maybe lord sitting here tonight or maybe lord would hear this message or stream it at a later time but god i pray if there's one that doesn't know the peace of god that has not come to that place lord of real rest in you i pray tonight lord may it not just be another moment that's taken for granted but may it be a time that they just reach out to you and

david said he teacheth my hands to war hallelujah lord it has so much to say within it that we need your instruction we need your leadership lord [Music] sometimes lord as we're looking at situations we're just wanting the situation to go away but sometimes the lord right there in the midst of that situation what you're waiting on us to ask you is teach me lord teach me lord teach me lord show me
