amen God bless you musicians I want to say thank you and the song service this morning and God bless each of you and it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen we want to turn in the book of Hebrews to chapter 10 this morning and let's welcome each of you here I want to read here in verse 26 of Hebrews chapter 10. and the scripture reads like this in verse 26 for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall Devour the adversaries he that despised Moses law died without Mercy under two or three Witnesses of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy thing and half done despite unto the spirit of Grace for we know him for we know him that hath said Vengeance belongeth unto me I will recompense saith the Lord and again the Lord shall judge his people it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God I want to go back to verse 29. and that's where I want to draw the thought here this morning and where it speaks wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of Grace and I'd like to just speak if the Lord will help us this morning on the spirit of Grace amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as we're being seated I want to just lay some background here with these scriptures just for a few moments because this portions of scripture along with Hebrews 6. it was very much a question in people's minds and the Holy Spirit in this age that we're living in God sending his prophet in this hour would go right into these scriptures that in some ways have Satan I'm gonna just say it in this way Satan has got a hold of it at times and he's wanted to haunt people with these scriptures I've set many times over times during the years sometimes where within this where someone had thought in some way of well did I uh you know did I uh did I did I cross the line and I just say it over and over as brother Branham because that same tormenting Spirit Came Upon individuals many times you would find when brother Brahman the prayer line when women were going through a Time the time of life and that weariness and how Satan would hit that upon them and you find the Holy Spirit would call that out and say you haven't crossed the line and you recognize that though maybe they weren't where they should be and some were where they should be with God but nonetheless God in his Mercy is here to always uncover the work of the enemy because God's desire is for you and me that we would walk with Clarity before us and let me just say it this way that if there's one promise no matter what that promise is that has not been obtained yet God's desire is that there would be such a clear pathway and that that promise itself would be so evident before you that your faith would be built in him to obtain that promise and God makes and he is the God who provides he's the sufficient one and I want to just just look here upon this scripture here just for a moment when we deal of the spirit of Grace because every one of us within our lives not only have we needed Grace we still need the grace of God and just to understand this that you'll find that the Holy Spirit through the message of the hour the Rapture itself is that of the grace of God it's rapturing Grace so we understand as we were looking at last week thee we're living in the time of the shout and within that shout there are shoutings of Grace this word is coming to encourage age you and I and I want you to understand as we look at even a few things here to kind of set the course not that what I'll tarry in today but to understand the word of God is here to bring us from where we are to where we should be and it's to encourage us if we're here then he wants to encourage us to move on deeper and so God's desire is to do that because when we look at this I want just laying this as he just is delivering it to my heart now that there are things that we could we do desire to see God to do but brother Brown would make it so clear to you and I that he says many people are saying well if God will just take this from me then I'll serve him if God will just do this and brother bran brings it down to the authority that somehow we seem to let slip away from us that we have the the authority to make a decision and the way that we make a decision is based on his presence that's dealing with us you can't make a decision based on where you're at or what entrapments or situations or I'm caught in this you can't make a decision based on that because you'll never have any faith to climb out of that but you have to make your decision based on the Living God who is present and dealing with your heart and just turn loose and say Lord take me there because he's the enforcer of his word is that right that's why brother Bram comes on to say so sometimes when we wonder why am I not seeing this in my life the way it should be I'm asking God to take it brother bam tells us there and this is out of marriage of the Lamb that I'm referring to he says but you've got a decision to make and I just want to say to you the authority and the power right now is not something that's far out there it's right there with you there's an authority that you have that the word of God you know the scripture says as many as believed him to them he gave the power the escousia the right to become the sons of God so it is God's presence that ministers to you and I those rights that belong to you and I it's so it's him it's him that is giving us Grace it's the spirit of Grace that's coming to encourage us into his grace into his word so this this when we look here in the scripture we find that in Israel as Paul is dealing here in in the book of Hebrews and remember among the Hebrews here when you you take into the Hebrew series when brother Branham is going through that series brother Brown is dealing very much the spirit of God just as it was here within Hebrews is setting that place is setting the church into a place to realize that you're not resting upon your Works you're resting upon the grace of God now that's not to say well I don't have to do nothing that's not what it's saying it what it's simply saying is is that if we are trusting in our works to somehow Merit something from God we're missing the grace of God that is there ministering to us that we might yield Our Lives to him you see the law in itself it only comes to point out that you're wrong that you're guilty but Grace comes to Maine to men Minister Redemption to you and I and that's what the grace of God has come forth to bring us into the promises of almighty God and we we need the grace of God in our lives uh throughout our lives and when I say that of the grace of God I'm not speaking of and I trust that you understand me of where we live a life that's a life of imbalance and we're in and out and up and down truly there is Grace that will hold to a person can really come to a place because if they belong to God they're going to come to that place but I'm talking about a Grace because the Bible says that we would approach the throne of grace and I I just believe and I know as a witness it's not just it's not just Grace for failings and mistakes we need that but it's Grace that when the word speaks to our lives and God ministers to us and we say Lord granted Lord God let it be in my life Lord Jesus because we're not approaching uh the Judgment seat remember the same seat with blood on it was a seed of Mercy but with the blood off of it it became a judgment seat we are not approaching a a seat that is empty of blood but as a matter of fact it is blood covered and that's what this message is it's the revealing of the blood covering it's the revealing of the blood it's the revealing of God's presence and working that is Mindful and mindful and great to work with every situation so here Israel's in a journey and they're in a journey to a Promised Land and Joshua brother Brown will take this over and over Joshua being a type of the grace of God that was with them through the whole entire Journey because it was Grace that gave them a prophet Grace provided the pillar of fire that accompanied it to confirm what this vessel is saying it's not the vessel it's my word this is the season because when God's speaking a word God is there to fulfill that word are you with me God's there to fulfill it and the pillar of fire was there as the grace of God provided to a company that messenger and that message and let me just say this the pillar of fire has never left this message [Music] is the same Pillar of Fire that is leading us all the way into the body change it's God that is quickening you and I and he's making the promises of God more real to you and I and is changing our lives from Glory unto Glory so it was the accompaniment of God's grace that brought signs and wonders and miracles there in Egypt it was it was the signs and the voice that came behind that sign it was Grace that provided the power to part the Red Sea as a pain a path to escape their pursuers it is the same Spirit of Grace that would take them across according to the word of God in the appointed time it is Grace that would move down to make known the time of the promise but we would know that we would know that at kadish barnia but they would not accept God's grace to take them over regardless of the obstacles now I want you to see this here this morning God's grace was providing for them all along even where God would send spies into the land to bring back fruit to walk around the the land and as they came back remember There Were Ten that came back with an evil report it wasn't that there weren't Giants over there there were giants over there there was some big walls there were some big obstacles to be taken but there were two of them Caleb stood up and said we're more than able and if the Lord is for us and he is for us how do you know he's for you Caleb look where he brought us out we sure didn't get ourselves out of Egypt we didn't open the Red Sea right we haven't provided this manner uh we're not the ones that has provided the water it's the rock that's followed us you see what was Caleb doing Caleb was mindful of the Living God who had been pressing all the time and Caleb was receiving that Grace in his life and that's why he could see more grace are you with me now because that the word as we receive Grace the grace of God it brings us into a place to see more of God's grace because it is the grace of God that takes you and I from this point to this point from this point to this point from this point to this point it is the grace of God and this is where the scripture that we're reading here is many examples in the scriptures that it applies to where it speaks where they who despised Moses law died under two or three Witnesses uh and and I I don't want to get into just too many examples of that this morning but I want to just say that in this here that if there is something in your heart that says Lord I care about your word I care about what your desire is I may not understand it but I care Lord and I I desire Lord that as that care let it deepen in my life let me tell you that's something there that's in your heart that's not despising the spirit of Grace it's inviting the grace that's being ministered to you my my mind and half done despite so they come to a place but have done despite and to despite the spirit of Grace how many know that that the Lord Jesus when they were speaking concerning him and they called him Bill said bobbin everything else and he says you speak one word against the son of man it'll be forgiven you but when the Holy Ghost has come to speak one word against it it'll never be forgiven you in this life and in the world to come he was letting him know because what was the coming of the Holy Ghost that is God vindicating not only what he was proving in the ministry of the son of man when he was here but now the coming of the Holy Ghost says everything that was Vindicated everything that he said it is now in full force that Liberty has come and he indeed is the true Lamb of God do you realize what the coming of the Holy Ghost is in your life in my life it is a Vindication that he is the true Lamb of God and I am a part of that not just something we talk about we don't just talk about Calvary we have experienced that day on Calvary it has been that which has touched our life our hearts have been have been brought to that place that we and ourselves recognize that he did it for me and the revelation of Jesus Christ breaking forth upon our life and let me just say it like this may we never ever get to big or too tired of taking trips to Calvary just hearing the prophet even the other day of listening to a message and brother Brown says we just need another trip to Calvary you say what is it with the trip to Calvary it's a humility it's recognizing we're nothing of our own it's recognizing he's made the full purchase for you and I and recognizing that no matter what the need is and the obstacle I don't care how great it looks it's to recognize that he made a way for you and I and the spirit of almighty God the spirit of Grace is here to make real and to bring you into every single promise that God has made it's the spirit of Grace and that's what the Holy Ghost is so to despite that remember to despite it is is uh and I just want to refer I didn't want to put these on the screen but it's too insult or to re uh shamefully entreat or to behave uh in a very stubborn like way uh to injure one by speaking evil of them so uh when we look at this to do despite to the spirit of Grace God bringing them along and brother Brandon would say it like this in the unpardonable sin he said sin is rejecting the will of God sin in its initial form is to reject the revealed word of God or will of God when God has revealed something as his will and to reject that is to blaspheme or to reject God remember what Cain did God Vindicated Abel's sacrifice right and Cain got upset about it but then God came to Cain and he says if you'll just do like your brother if thou do us well Thou shalt also be accepted and brother Brandon brings that down for us and says if you'll do like your brother's doing I'll accept you God's acceptance of Cain was not to make him a bride member but at least he would have respect unto the Vindication of the witness of the Holy Spirit but Cain was unable to Humble himself in God's presence are you hearing me now Cain was able to Humble himself brother bran brings us out he was able to Humble himself to build a church to build an altar to bring fruits but he wasn't able to Humble himself to this level of humility to the word of God you say well what would be able to do that it would be an offspring of God that would be able to Humble themselves to God you say well show that in the scripture it's very clear God himself humbled himself to become one of us he became his own word the word was made flesh he took upon him the prophet says it like this a body of humiliation the body that surrounded the king of glory it was not fitting for the king of glory but he became one of us as the prophet said he took our form upon him that he might mold his character inside of you and I because there had to be a propitiation that would go before you and I to meet the justice of God then we might receive God's mercy Sin Sin notice in its initial form is to reject the revealed word of God and brother Brown continues there's many uh scriptures that or quotes that I could go to but I I want to lay this in because uh the message of the hour lays it so clear and brother Brown picks this up again within this thought he said Paul here is speaking if a man ever comes to a spot that he's been saved and Sanctified the blood sanctifies Hebrews 13 12 and 13 says the blood sanctifies and then comes right up to the gate of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and because of prestige or denomination refuses to walk in it now let me just let me just let's clarify this right here anything that is esteemed above the word of God let me tell you something there has been lives that have turned away the grace of God for relationships are you with me they've they've turned the grace of God for the opposite sex I'm going to preacher now they they have taken that and even when God you say what do you mean by that I'm talking about when God would bring to the attention that this is the grace of God moving for that life and here that they would just want to just seemingly walk away now let me just let me just put a precursor here let me just say it like this right here friends and there is nothing and no one that this guy writes off are you understanding me God himself is the one who interprets this he didn't leave it to you he didn't leave it to me because let me just put another quote out there in the message Paradox brother Brandon said you take an unbeliever that's sending here tonight and here he is speaking against these things and you let the Holy Ghost get a hold of his life he said the next night he'll be standing up glorifying God and testifying to the mercy of God so I do the same believe it's something that to take Serious are you with me now that person said now see brother REM said that person is lost and can never be saved for he's done despite even to the very works of Grace that's called him up to that place and shown it to him and then turn around and walk away from it he counts the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was crucified Christ was crucified as an Unholy thing because watch this now because the blood that saved him and Justified him and Sanctified him brings him up to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then he walks away and leaves it now brother Brandon goes on to say you're catching that the blood has been working all along it's just like God's grace brought him out of Egypt and it's God working all along all right are you with me now let me just say it like this just because you've seen somebody or know somebody that you say Well it don't seem like they've went on with God you commit the grace of God and you commit that life to the grace of God just as you commit your own life are you hearing me now this morning God's grace bringing us up into a place to where there's something to wear that brings us up to that of the baptism of the Holy Ghost now what she says brother and said I'm setting a pattern I'm taking a lot of time but look Judas Iscariot followed those same tracks he was justified by Believing on the Lord Jesus and then accepting him and his personal savior he was Sanctified and give powers to cast out Spirits put his name on the Lamb's Book of Life but when it come to Pentecost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the word he showed his colors that's what the Canaan spies did and that's exactly what Esau did now remember Esau was a good moral person Esau was a better moral person than Jacob is that right now to come to that notice into the fullness of the word now when we look at this brother bam would also go on to say he's talking about the True Vine and false Vine he said they're both growing side by side and did you realize that Judas Iscariot was treasurer of the church and out of the same tribe of the Lord Jesus he was a big man Brothers with the rest of them sat in the same Pew sang the same songs worship the same God preach the same gospel and was Judas do you realize that same spirit moves right up through the church but where Judas showed his colors was at Pentecost just before Pentecost before they really got born again brother Brian said people will do the tonight he said many people don't believe there's such a thing as an experience of being born again they say it's all in your mind no it's in your heart now brother Brandon goes on the message the token and wants you to watch how he speaks of this scripture here and he's Abraham we just want to break in on this part and has done despite unto the spirit of Grace which come from the blood he said Minister remember good man moral man whatever you are and you know that God taken cigarettes from you women you know he has taken shorts and short hair and everything you know he did that now if he's if if he's not done that yet let him do it the more you give yourself to him it's him that takes things away from your life are you with me but remember you've got to make a decision and what encourages and strengthens your decision is your heart submitted in obedience to the word of God not your feelings about it not all your pastor present where you're standing but where the Living God is right before you and making his word known that's a time to act on it and say be it unto me Lord according to Thy word let the same grace of God that brought me to repentance May the same grace of God work to dismantle every unclean habit every unclean thing out of my life let it sanctify my life oh god notice he taking it out of your life how by decision there has to be a decision that's made in other words we can't set neutral and expect God to do things I'm telling you this morning remember you've got Authority you don't become a son and daughter of a God here at the altar you do not become a son and daughter of God when you get the Holy Ghost you become a manifested son and daughter of God but it is that being a son and daughter of God that the word comes to give you power right it gives you the authority to make a decision and say I'm not going to live here no longer I'm not going to make an excuse for the condition I'm going to take God at his word that's the grace of God that's a heart that though you might say but where I'm standing but you're not looking at where you're standing you're looking to the spirit of Grace that is coming to lead you on sometimes let me kind of come back to this sometimes the reason lives can come up to a certain place and then they kind of want to go away because Satan wants to discourage that life are you hearing me he wants to discourage that life and then he starts coming in there well the promise isn't for you and this isn't for you let me tell you something you'll never hear God ever say words like that [Music] never has God ever said that you can't find one scripture where God has ever told somebody that A promise is not for you but it's on the contrary God has taken his promises he manifests his promises and in turn Works to encourage you and I and sometimes listen to me the way the enemy will work upon a life is to work in such a way and you don't realize listen to me this is why brother Adam says that when you've given your heart to God he said you go forth with the confession he said I don't care what anything else says you get it from The Altar and say Lord the Lord Jesus has forgiven me of my sins he is my savior and brother Brahm said you watch that confession it will work righteousness in your life what are you saying I'm telling you throw down fear because they don't got no value in it fear is only put there to try to hinder you and hold you back from what the promise that God has for you your faith can never rest in your own abilities because you don't have the strength to do this but your faith must Rest In The Sovereign Grace of almighty God the spirit of Grace that moves down to bring such a change in your life sometimes you get around well you know the devil's telling me this and the Satan's telling me this and I no he comes and he wants to say all sorts of things to all of us let me just ask you this right here what have you been given your ear to her the most sometimes it sometimes it's what you're feeding on that allows things to build up in your life are you hearing me it's what you begin to feed on and it builds up to a place you say brother Samuel what do you say I'm telling you to evaluate you me evaluating your life where you're at with God if there's things in your life that you don't feel like you can even make a step forward and the enemy is wanting to bring such condemnation on your life I'm telling you there is the spirit of Grace right here this morning if you just accept it here we are say God I've allowed too many other cares of life I've allowed too many other things hey come on I ain't preaching the angels I'm preaching to Sons and Daughters of God that are still in this flesh body [Music] and if you can accept that it is the spirit of Grace that's Desiring to lead you out of that trap you've got in and I say that in the name of the Lord I want to just say it like this brother as you turn around and do despite and count the blood of the Covenant as it was an Unholy thing who Sanctified you and brought you this far who took the things out of your life Francis and who gave you a desire to serve God but the man said like these spies they come up around the Borderland and they looked over and said well I know it's there but the obstacle is too green we look like grasshoppers they perished in the wilderness borderline Believers don't know watch this don't just come this far and say I believe the message you obey the messenger now you first got to believe before you can obey but believing is not obeying obeying is submission and yielding in your heart to his presence I know it's simple but that's what obedience is and that's what God requires you know Saul had a great sacrifice Saul did a lot of things but God said hey you know what I don't care about all these sheep I don't care about all these oxen I don't care about all this your parading in front of here what Maya what I esteem more than anything else is obedience to my voice even when it don't make sense to you when it steps on your toes no matter what it is against your own better thinking obedience to the word of God is better than any sacrifice that you can make is that right that's what took place in the Garden of Eden disobedience one under deception and one disobeyed with his eyes open and God leads us back to a life of obedience that's what the spirit of Grace comes to do is to do what lead the Lambs of God into life because you always were a sheep so the spirit of Grace the spirit of the doubt seeks out the lamb yeah and just as it led the lamb to Calvary to the Fulfillment of every word The Same Spirit of Grace moves upon the Lambs of God to lead us into the Fulfillment of the word ah notice he says I believe the message he said you obey the messenger come into Christ and you say well I believe every word said brother Branham that's good but that's just being able to read take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ be in you now let me just give this scripture here as we prepare to turn here just a moment in Matthew Chapter 5 Verse 6 I I trust that you can understand that where we are standing in this hour that for a Believer when I read those scriptures there before you'll never find a Believer there in those scriptures but you'll find those that will come up through the baptism of the Holy Ghost that come up which is the fullness of the word the word living out in the life of the believer deity being expressed but we'll come up to that and say we're not able over some excuse and speak ill of the word of God let me say this there's never been a mortal that could ever live the word of God under their own strength and their own Merit there's no freedom in that whatsoever but there is a freedom that comes with knowing the Lord God even the prophets like David and others that receive a visitations of the spirit of Grace but never had the privilege of the indwelling of the spirit of divine grace is that right that's why David could say take not thy free spirit that of Grace away from my life Lord God but restore unto me the joy of thy salvation but you and I have been given the privilege on this side of Calvary and in this hour to be a partaker of the grace of almighty God the spirit of Grace that lifts you and I from a sinner into a place as a saint when it transforms our lives from that of just our unearthly mortal walking around to a manifested son and daughter of God what does that the spirit of Grace [Music] that's why it it is his presence that energizes you and me to say be it unto me Lord according to Thy Word that's why you know you got respect you know like I said there might be a life that maybe they've come to a certain place with God and maybe they you know it kind of kind of Fallen away and fallen off but that scripture ain't applying there that scripture only applies when those who come up and willfully stand and reject the truth wipe their feet on it that's the place where the scripture applies to but if there is something that moves in your heart let me tell you you didn't put that in your heart but this is what you need to do don't just let it be a desire that's there in a holding pattern say God you made a way for this desire to come to a full reality I'll do whatever it takes Lord whatever the word requires Lord I want to come all the way this is why the scripture applies Matthew 5 6 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled see a person's even blessed to want it just blessed to want it for those who hunger and thirst who put that in their God that's why the Holy Spirit last week as we were preaching on the depths of God's grace where a person said you don't know my condition brother brother Brown you don't know my condition I'm this and I'm that and I'm winning then this and brother Abraham says you're not past the stage of redemption you're setting in this church this morning do you realize it's God that song you just sung there's one more move God's the one that has the last word [Music] I feel like preaching right now we are living in the hour of the revealing of the amen of God he who has the final word your situation is not the final word your family tree is not the final word your inabilities are not the final word your failures are not the final word but the amen of God the Soviet of God the god that's here to uncover who you really are the god that's here to speak over your life and that you can rise in that Grace and bless yourself in the god of the amen truth the god who's revealing you always were a son and daughter of God who calls you God who's drawing your life take that devil like that song you sing the precious love of God no wall he won't tear down rehab was walled in but he tore it down to get to her she couldn't tear down that wall she couldn't see her way out but God tore it down how did he tear it down he teared he tore it down with seven mysterious Thunders he tore it down with the word of Grace and shoutings of Grace oh they were walking in silence around and around but eventually on that seventh day they were to walk seven times and there was to come a shout out of them at that time what was it it was the grace of almighty God there's no situation brother Samuel that's an awful deep statement he's an awful big God [Applause] if you want to limit God that's up to you but God is not limited to me [Applause] now let me just trying to work this in here so the grace of God the true Spirit of Grace it comes forth with a message to advance the Church of the Living God forward it's always to be going forward not staying the same not going backward but going forward and incidentally staying the same is actually backsliding because he's moving on and we're staying the same so let me just say it like this we want to be content with the presence of God but never complacent in our walk we want to be content with him right but the brand says to be sufficiently impressed with the word that's in our midst the one who's working but we don't want to become complacent there's more of God for us right you're hearing me now now so we understand this that there is a call now I want to go here to Exodus 33 verse 12 and I want to work with this advancement of Grace here just for a little bit and maybe laying some groundwork for some for for services ahead in Exodus 33 verse 12. and Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou Hast not let me know whom thou Wilt sin with me yet thou has said I Know Thee by name and thou Hast also found Grace in my sight so Lord you've told me that I have found Grace in your sight I found favor now therefore watch this in verse 13. now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I might Know Thee that I might find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people now notice God's already told him you have already found Grace in my sight he couldn't say this to God if God hadn't already made it known to him and God just didn't say something God Vindicated it with his presence because he told him go down there and I will be with thee right God said I'll be with him now Moses is carrying this in his heart thou hast thou have found Grace in thy sight now he's asking in verse 13 if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I might Know Thee thy way thy character thy nature thy life thy person I want to see you Lord I you spoke to me you've showed your grace to me but I want to know your way let me tell you what this is this is a man a Son of God that is Desiring for more of the grace of almighty God this is a life that is saying I do not trust my own way because I've walked that before I've done Moses before you know they say do you I've done Moses before and it don't work out too good I've tried to do a lot of things tried to accomplish a lot of things but I don't want my way this is a man that has experienced the grace of God and knows the authority of the spirit of Grace to bring Liberty and lead him further I want to go on don't you I'm gonna go on I believe I found Grace but this is the desire of my heart show me thy way Lord remember Samuel don't you believe he showed you thy way yes but he doesn't stop you see it's us beholding him the moment you take your eyes off of him when we get to feeling confident comfortable and somehow along the line we'll never say it but it's like we get this feeling in our Humanity it's something we always will have to battle that we can never ever come to a place of being self-reliant I'm not just telling you that you experience that in your own Christian walk with God when there's things that you begin to get your eyes off on other things and how does that happen it can happen with somehow with us not even saying anything but where we begin to become a little bit confident and when we get a little confident and a little comfortable we stop being as diligent as we ought to be oh not me brother Samuel know every single one of us we need the grace of almighty God that's why that within this life Paul never said oh who shall save me from this wonderful man he said this Wretched Man this Wretched Man let me tell you who we pack around with us is a Wretched Man a wretched woman and we need God show me Lord thy way Lord Lead Me past the Lord the insecurities in my life Lead Me past the complexes Lord lead me past Lord God all the strains of the family Lord show me thy way that I might Know Thee you know the longer you're with and really with somebody you get to know them a whole lot more my wife and I by the grace of God here on Tuesday we just celebrated our 25th anniversary and I'll tell you this right here I know her a whole lot more than what I did when we first started talking [Applause] I know it's amazing because I only look 17 years old but it's true we've been married 25 years but she knows me a whole lot more too come on as husbands and wives you know one another what's wrong nothing yeah right we know one another is that right what does that the relationship that's the same way it is with God and let me just tell you something God ain't finding out about brother Joshua he already said before your members were even were even written there we're even manifest in his book and he said I know you're going in and you're coming out and he said I want to let you know I've already preserved it and I made a way it ain't God finding out about me he already knows me he knows my strengths he knows my weaknesses and yet despite it all it wasn't anything that hindered him from choosing you or me because we are a part of him God's Got Confidence in that word that's packed beneath all the mother the dog the buck in our life I think if somebody called it the grab bag of life show me now thy way that I might Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight so showing me thy way that I might find Grace I want to find more grace I want to find more grace is that right but I might find Grace in my sight and consider that this nation is not people now watch how God responds in verse 14 and he said my presence paneer my face my person shall go with thee now God's already told him I'll go with you but here's the situation that has arose in the camp and you know God allows situations that will cause you and I to call out on him come on Friends God knows and God permits God shows that even in this when what has taken place in the camp with Israel's Disobedience and you know what happened with the gold calf and everything like that but here right in this particular place how that God would speak to him my presence shall go with thee now let me ask you whose presence was it he met at the burning bush it was God who was it that that went down to Egypt with him it was God who was it that was there when the rod was thrown down it consumed Janice and generate it was God on and on we could go who was it when Moses himself would speak and then speak prophetically to the people and say don't fear these things and then turn around and show the humanity and the weakness of Mortals and cry to God and God would pick it up we don't read it in the scripture cry but God picks it up why cry thou unto me what God was reminding Moses is Moses in the midst of this trouble and situation your forgetting who you are if you can remember who you are I the Lord have made you who you are and I'm standing right here with you there's not an obstacle too big too great that the word won't bring down and make a way through God was encouraging him but here he stands and God knows just what you and I need to hear my presence shall go with thee you know it'd be one thing it's like you've heard this story brother bam tells it you know he heard about uh brother Dan Daisy always told the two you know we're saying had a man and a woman you know and uh the woman hadn't heard her husband say to him say to her in a long time I love you except for when they first got married and she asked if she had anything wrong nope nothing wrong really you sure nope nothing wrong he said well she said well you ain't you ain't told me that you love me he said if anything ever changes I'll let you know I'm glad God ain't that way I'm glad God ain't that way I'm glad God sends cards I'm glad I'm glad God brings me flowers I'm glad that God wants me to so dwell in his love in my life well what some of the ways well it always sometimes isn't flowers it's just him letting me know don't go that way don't continue that thought don't keep that attitude that's his love to me he's letting me know I don't want you to go that way that's his love to me that's just as good as a bouquet of flowers that's just as good as something that sweeps down that's a blessing because from my heart I want to continue in the grace of God oh Hallelujah my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest my mama verse 15. now here's what Moses said If thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence boy that'd be a good thing to put on the refrigerator and everything else before any decision is made Lord if your presence ain't going with us on this right here remember his presence will always accompany his word if your presence ain't going I don't go now Moses could sit there and argue you know he could have said but this is your word God we're supposed to go we're supposed to do this but there's always a correct way God's presence is always there to confirm the word confirm the season and confirm that this is the people of the promise remember when Ramos Gilead was promised to the children of Israel and you find that in the days of Ahab that here Ahab wanted to go up and take Ramos Gilead he asked for Jehoshaphat to come and when Jehoshaphat came Jehoshaphat can only agree with the word in the fact that Ramos Gilead did indeed belong to the children of Israel but you see it was not just an Israelite obtaining a promise but it must be according to the word and the word itself is more than just a letter but it must be the person or the nature that is according to the person of almighty God what was it ahab's life his character was not a fit character to take what the promise us that God had given to him well what would it have taken humility obedience is that right that's that's the coming of the Rapture the bride will take the Rapture by the word is that right oh my my mama If thy presence go not with me carry us up not fence for wherewith oh I like this for worrying shall it be known here that I and thy people have found Grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us now I want you to watch this showing that we have found Grace in thy sight how how is this going to be known that we have your favor is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the Earth so what is it that brings the distinction or the separation is the grace of God going with the people of God it's advancing in God's grace so Grace is not just something that as the church World wants to paint it as indeed Grace is a forgiveness of sin but remember how will we know that your grace we have obtained Grace and thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us thy presence is Among Us in what in the Fulfillment of your word understand now not talking about just a feeling or an anointing where people can run and jump and and all of those things like that we believe in Emotion I I believe in that but you understand it's something that's deeper than just speaking in tongues or some some sort of evidence out here it's a life and an Evidence that's lined up with the word of almighty God if it's not taking the people on into the grace and the promises of God it's not a move of God because a move of God is the spirit of Grace advancing the people on think about it God's grace is not going to keep us here forever we're at the end time the grace of God is moving us into a place of in my father's house are many mansions God's grace is there's an ushering in of the rapture oh my and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou has spoken for thou has found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name now let me move on the spirit of Grace here just for a moment in Zechariah Chapter 12 verse 9 . so this Spirit of Grace is more that we could read with that event of Moses where God reveals himself and what he is and his faithfulness but I want you to notice the next place in the scripture where it is mentioned the spirit of Grace because the spirit of Grace is the advancement into the promises of God for our lives let me just tell you justification is a promise sanctification is a promise the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a promise and there's more promises to take are you with me Zechariah 12 and verse 9. and you say what more promises could it be it's God wanting to sow mold our character to match his character it's true the token is the necessity for the rapture it's very true but let me tell you what the token does the token doesn't bring complacency because it's rapturing Grace now that same grace of God comes to minister to you and I if we have become complacent if we have to encourage Us in the things of God are you with me I can't get into all this today but the great the spirit of Grace comes to you and I to minister to our lives in that way but we don't ever want to have the thought of well I've already made it I know there's quotes and I believe that those quotes holding in the scripture where they need to hold but when you recognize you already made it you're like David going to the battle against Goliath brother Brahm said he went dancing down there he was full of joy you know why he already knew the battles won see this is why the Holy Ghost it's not just we get this and then now I go worry about all of life no no no we're not here for this life we're not here for this life we're here for him and when his purpose is fulfilled then we're gone it's not according to what we think about life are you with me sometimes in life we get to thinking that a full life is well when a full life you know I graduate from college and I get a job and however you want to place this and I obtain us I obtain a uh you know a career and I have to know house and I obtain of this and I have married and I have life and I have grandchildren but who said that's complete who said that's the purpose there are purposes in there but remember we are not promised the longevity of that because it's not about us serving our purpose or our wants it's about us serving his purpose [Applause] oh friends if you can see that this morning it'll cause you to turn loose of whatever is holding you back whatever's keeping you back from any promise it'll cause you to turn Lucifer to realize it ain't about well when I get this straightened out and I'm gonna get this straight now it ain't about waiting it's let God do something right now for you Zechariah 12 verse 9. and it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem and I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn here is Israel a people they were blinded for our sake they were blinded in their blindness they rejected the Messiah but God had a promise all the way back all the way through and in the midst of it through their blinding we have received sight as the Gentiles the supper that they were called to you remember the parable the supper that they were called to to be a partaker of the feast that the Lord had made what Feast was that it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was the outpouring of the life of the atonement but they begin to make excuses of why they couldn't do it and then the in that Parable it goes out and says then none of these shall eat at my table but go out into the highways and the hedges and so forth and compel them because my house shall not be empty now let me tell you this right here God's Grace has reached down through the Gentiles and God has called out a group of people for his namesake he has taken lives down through time that they him themselves even had to continue to bathe in the grace of God after they had received it and after the grace had changed their lives Paul could speak to him in the book of Corinthians and them still remembering the vile condition that they were in but the grace of God would mention to them this is what you were at one time but you have been Justified you have been washed by the blood of the lamb and by his Spirit you are standing Justified what was it God's grace to lift them into that position and all the way down through the Gentiles even in the age that you and I are living in with such confusion when things are all around and and tradition and everything is at its height with with all kinds of Creeds and dogmas and and this is the way and this is the way and this is the way and this is the way and this is the wing and this is the way and you're looking at all around but God in his grace makes known his way for you and I let me tell you if not for the grace of God we wouldn't be able to find our way out of a paper bag [Music] if not for God's grace we wouldn't even know how to cross the fence but God in his grace and let me tell you how simple God made it God took a little look God took a man that wasn't very tall at all in stature wasn't very tall among the theologians either didn't even have a seventh grade education but God took a vessel that was willing to surrender and submit his heart to God and God brought forth a message of grace to you and I when you and I couldn't find our way but God in his grace he shined his life upon our pathway it wasn't you looking for God it was God came looking for you think about it when this is poured out upon Israel it is not Israel that has got themselves in position to receive the Messiah but there's been some hard trials the tender hand of Jehovah he said I'll cast held in the north give up my sons I'll tell the South give up my daughters I'll tell the West I'll tell these give up my sons and my daughters I bring you back home because the promise is when you get back in your land that's where the Messiah is going to come that's why when that Rabbi when they were afraid to get on that plane they were looking at that scripture and that Rabbi Anointed with the spirit of God here he goes back into the scripture of Isaiah and he says it says they shall go back on the wings of an eagle was able to understand in the airplane it wasn't so much the airplane it was God it was gone identifying this is the Fulfillment of Prophecy it wasn't an airplane taking them back it was God fulfilling his word [Applause] and let me tell you before you ever you and I ever got to a place before you ever may be darkened these doors God had to deal with your heart and let me tell you though you couldn't hear his voice maybe to like it's like my voice coming across this speaker but I want you to remember that those trumpets sound out to call Israel back home and the prophet said he's already supernaturally preached those in the revealing under that Sixth Seal [Applause] let me tell you this message has sounded out it's the faith of God placed upon this generation the spirit of Grace that's been poured out not poured out in a vial but poured out through the shofar poured out through the Ram's Horn porn now in Jubilee pouring out and come back to your possession it's the spirit of Grace that is anointing you David with the word of almighty God yeah which is small in stature thou which is little oh God let us always be little in our own lives foreign this message has sounded out it's brought you to where you're at despite all your doubts despite every trap in every web and everything of unbelief that the enemies wanted to wow and bring around in your life brother Samuel is their hope for me if there's something in your heart that is crying out for the Living God there is hope [Applause] what do I do listen to this hand listen to that voice because just as Israel getting into this place God bringing them into this position back into Palestine I don't mean to labor on this but it's just as it's coming I don't have this road down but just it's coming you realize they went back into a land where a language had died it died they call those who went there Zionist where has there ever been a language died that that language came back well brother Samuel that's for the Jews I'm talking about a language that's deeper than the Jews I'm talking about the language of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the language of the word we're at churches and dogmas and isms and seminaries have wanted to change the language of the word but God there's been scientists that have been anointed by the spirit of almighty God [Applause] we're standing where we're standing because of God's grace and let me just say it like this here I am as a young boy and yes as a young boy but I thank God for the veterans that's went ahead of us maybe veterans didn't see this or see that but they stood faithful for what they did see and they made a way that where we're standing right now it took some zionists to stand there and say you ain't taking away this right you're not taking away the holy ghost from the church you're not reducing it to a Creed you're not reducing it to a beliefism you're not going to take this away [Applause] and God has got some people in this hour yeah 11th Hour workers [Music] lives that have received the indwelling of God's grace and they are the Lamb's protection upon this Earth what is it witnesses that God still delivers that the Holy Ghost is still real that God still heals the sick that God still delivers the oppressed God still loosens lives from the grip of cancer Hallelujah [Music] what has brought us to this the spirit of Grace poured out poured out upon us poured out upon us and they are in their place when that 144 000 receives their visitation They will receive the two witnesses that will preach this same message this message of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he will make himself known to them you know what he will do he will come and amen the message just as he's right here amending the message [Applause] they will experience power signs wonders Miracles right there with the preaching of those two witnesses and you know what it does it causes them here they are looking for him and He makes himself known to them he vindicates according to his word how much more God bringing you and I into the place for rapture if they have to be there to receive their visitation and it wasn't all picnic baskets to get there there's many that died in concentration camps is this okay but they'll receive their white robes under that fifth seal and brother Branham said just as Joseph stepped forward to reveal himself to his brethren he says when he steps forward and like that altar he says to reveal himself to his brother and here they underneath the altar will catch that Revelation he's the Messiah what are you saying I'm saying there's things going on in both dimensions [Applause] is being reflected on Earth it's the spirit of Grace to not only to recognize Where We Are Who We Are and who were in the presence of let me just say it this way it's imperative it's important that you move with the grace of God because without moving with God's grace it moves on without you and you can't say that you've received it because Grace is not something that's just here that allows us that you can just go on and continue that's not what Grace it shouldn't that's not that's not the true expression of Grace but what Grace should do to your life is to realize Lord you're my way maker when God Reveals His grace more to you and me it don't make me want to live loose I want to be more fervent I want to serve him more I want to I want to be pleasing to him I don't want to just look at well this is okay good my God must be okay with this one thank God for his good no no but it's to receive that Grace because you see if we re as you receive that Grace in your life there's more grace for you to walk in I want to walk in this advancement of the spirit of Grace I don't believe at all I'm speaking to people who despise the grace of God listen that's an awful big Broad and deep statement I don't believe that I believe that I believe that God has sent me to speak to people who care and I believe I'm looking at people who care I believe I'm looking and preaching to people who say you know what I want to experience more of God's grace there's more ground to be taken there's more cities to be taken I want to experience more of God's grace how do how do I do that well as God deals with you whatever it is that God deals with you on move upon that don't say well I'll wait till I get this no if there would be something in the way I'd put that aside from the way and say God give me the grace that I need I want to go on with you remember you have the authority to make the decision you have that Authority and that decision it welcomes God to move you realize God never made the decision for the spies they made it but Caleb and them also made a decision and you know what their decision was based on the word they had watched God walk or work all along and they knew this is God letting us know he's with us and see you know what I'm going to take what he's saying beyond what you're saying beyond what my feelings say or even what my eyes see I'm gonna take What God Says you love him oh let's walk with the spirit of Grace let's walk with the spirit of Grace step by step and you know what he's bringing us into position he's bringing us into position he's the one assembling his body together Stone by Stone piece by piece Heart By Heart Life by life he's assembling Us by his grace and I say Lord if you're not going up I don't want to go but I want to go where you're going where you're leading you're showing me your way your character let my character be molded to match there that's sonship you love him let's pray [Music] Lord Jesus thank you Lord for your mercy and your grace Lord Jesus thank you for the spirit of Grace Lord how that it's you we see it and Lord I I it just becomes more real to us it's you working and at work in our lives Lord I know that you you know every one of our needs you know exactly where everyone is at but I pray Lord there's one thing as we look in your word it makes a difference in our lives and that's the grace of God and Lord Jesus like Moses we're asking oh God for more grace Lord Grace that you would unfold to us your way Lord continue to show us Lord continue Lord for every life no matter where each life is at Lord may I pray God May there be lorda a heart that's there that is Lord willing to lay aside Lord our own will and to accept your will Lord I pray Lord Jesus may you grant it Lord here this morning The Same Spirit of Grace that Lord brought Israel out took Israel in that same Spirit of Grace is right here this morning the same Holy Spirit Lord to lead us into the fullness that you've called us to Lord you're here to do for us this morning maybe it's a sickness Lord that's standing before one of your children maybe Lord It's something they're going through in their Spirit Lord emotionally maybe in their body Lord we ask that may that same Spirit of Grace move down lord for their need right now Lord for that harder that life that Lord has not really surrendered to you maybe they believe the message and that's that's good but Lord may they take of that of the spirit of Grace and says come fully into Christ and Lord those of us Lord that we've come Lord and I believe Lord standing Lord I believe that Lord in my life Lord I know what you've done Lord for me but I want more Lord I want more I want more Lord and I know Lord that in order for more to be shown to us it's the requirement that we walk in the grace that's already been shown or as we walk in the light as he's in the light your Prophet said then watch more light unfold Lord I pray this morning if there's one that's weary if there's one Lord you you brought that around in the first part of the service I believe that maybe they got a little discouraged they got sidetracked there's some things that Lord [Music] not just for those sitting here but those listening Lord by way of internet right now they've become Lord sidetracked overwhelmed with Satan's lies and doubts and discouragement foreign Lord trying to satisfy first and bring comfort but there's no one that can Comfort us like you Lord may they take the words that are spoken as shoutings of Grace just as when you speak to Israel in that moment Comfort she Comfort she my people oh God I'm asking Lord that may Lord the voice that's behind my voice Lord may have penetrate Lord the darkness the doubt Lord that is there any confusion that's wanted to hinder Lord that life may you lead them out Lord I pray oh Shepherd great Shepherd granted Lord gather them Lord I pray like you gathered your disciples like you've gathered us Lord like you're Gathering Lord the 144 thousand Gathering for the promise granted Lord I pray [Music] Lord for every one of our hearts Lord just want to be in that right place want

let that stand in a way that's that's a spirit that's trying to hinder you but take the spirit of Grace it's calming you on no matter how many times you try you're trying it's not in vain but if you just look to him Look to Him Look Away to Jesus he's the one who's in our midst through all of the preaching through every part of this of the service when everything is said and done it's him when the prayer of benediction has been prayed and we depart from the prince of one another in this place what matters is that we have recognized his presence we not remain not remember every scripture every quote that's not what it's about God is unfolding himself by his word in his word to let you know he cares about you and he is here to do for you let me tell you it's God's grace that deals with the heart to bring us here is that right it's God's grace that deals with our lives even before the service began this morning it's God's grace that has dealt with our hearts like he dealt with Rebecca's heart before elieza ever got there it's the grace of God [Music] and it's God's grace you don't realize that brother Ben tells us he said it's the angels of God as it comes up in just A little nudge you should go forward you should act upon this it's the angels of God brother Samuel where are we we're on Mount Zion and there's an innumerable campman of angels all around the presence of God to do for you and I all that we have need of nah I don't have no need to stand up here and ask him for a motorcycle because that's not what's inspired to my heart right now and plus I don't have a need for it but what he inspires to my heart is what I have need of and the same God that asked the prophet that day how many squirrels do you need do you need and he told him how many he needed and he spoke even out of situations where no squirrel would come you know what that was that wasn't so that we would have a story of squirrels being created it was God letting you and I know that his word brings forth Sons and Daughters of God out of situations that looks like no way can a son or daughter of God be down beneath that is what God was letting us know in this generation that the word the spirit of Grace comes to bring you and I out it's God listen to me it's god making that Creation in your heart that's not my words that's the words of God spoken through a prophet God fulfilling his word and that's what's making that Creation in your heart it's God it's the Creator and that same creator that is working to bring that creation for you to even believe and say Yes Lord I I believe that same God is present to create a new creation the same God that creates faith the same God that creates cells that were taken by cancer the same God who creates broken where Brokenness is and brings restoration he is the same creator but must I do move upon the creation as he's working in that Creation in your heart it's God creating that faith it's God creating faith that's the grace of God that's God's grace Hallelujah amen God bless you we're going to let you be dismissed In The Name Of The Lord Heavenly Father Lord we just ask as we leave this building and leave the presence of one another that our requests and desires that your presence would go with us Lord [Music] show us that way in every Avenue and every facet of Our Lives show us that way Lord Lord Lord God if we're offered anything may we look to you and say Lord if your presence go not with me I don't want to go Lord Jesus may you Lord I pray your presence even Lord as we leave our heads are laid upon our pillows tonight should you Tarry and in the morning should you tarry throughout the day should you tarry may your presence continue as Lord our hearts entertaining entertaining your presence Lord
