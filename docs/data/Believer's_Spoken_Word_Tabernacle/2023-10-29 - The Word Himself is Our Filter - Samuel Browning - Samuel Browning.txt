you care Lord we love you and we thank you now Lord in Jesus precious name amen and amen amen you love him amen amen amen if you would um turn with me in your Bibles to Numbers Chapter 19 I want to just uh mention to you this um coming week brother Alexander mulus will be here on Thursday for us and brother Nathan Erikson will be standing in on Sunday as well um I have uh meetings there in uh the state of Washington uh that with Brother John Andes that my wife and I and um Paul's going to go with us on this so we'll be making our journey uh out there and so we just ask and certainly covet your prayers that you would just uh just pray for us that God will have his way in the in the services and uh in the meetings and uh I just want to say I didn't get a chance to mention very much from even where we had uh meetings the previous week there with um brother Jim shoem mate and the marriage banquet was there on Saturday but we certainly appreciate your prayers and just to see how God just so sovereignly comes in in the services and things to where that afterwards you know you you you understand how that God has moved so precisely for needs and hearts to minister to lives that even recently have just come to the Lord and God just takes a you know a thought and just drops a thought on your heart and begins to minister amen and God cares about us he cares about his children and and so I just I want to say thank you your the prayers the Lord has just there with many different um needs I believe the Lord uh met and so I want to say thank you for your prayers and I didn't get a chance to do that on Thursday I want to mention to you as well that the love offering and we were scheduled to take that on U next Sunday but since I'm not going to be here I want to just wait until the following Sunday if that'd be all right so the deacons are posted on that um I'm not going to go into the depths of the need but it is uh for someone that the deacons um had brought this to my attention that has as a part here of the assembly so I know there's been those that's already wrote and they've already uh um placed it in the box back there or in the baskets you can just write love offering if you feel to do it ahead of time and which some have so we just um ask that you would do that I know that uh you know know we don't have any none of us are rich none of us are wealthy but I know that one thing our our God is sufficient amen and so let's just let's just be in prayer about that as well I want to just ask you as we prepare to read our scripture here this morning I have uh a text here of a few verses I'm going to read and I'm just certainly asking that you would help me and pray that God will just help me to deliver it as he's put on my heart a few weeks ago the Lord just really begin to deal with this subject and I've just been pouring over it here didn't know exactly when we were going to speak it but I want to speak here this morning on a thought the word himself is our filter the word himself is our filter in numbers 19 verse1 and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring thee a red heer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face and elazer the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the Tabernacle of the congregation seven times and one shall burn the heer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he burn so want you just to focus on that it's to burn the whole hepher not just part of it and not just Parts but the entirety which speaks of the entirety of the word verse 6 and the priest shall take Cedarwood and hisp and Scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning hepher then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the evening and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and B his flesh in water and shall be clean until the even and then we want to really draw from verse 9 here and a man that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the hepher and lay them without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of Separation it is a purification for sin so we want to look at that thought the word himself is our filter may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as your being seated I think as I go through here today and um we uh I'll have some different slides at times that I'll have the brothers have them to pull up at times and um things that in order to give us a a visual and some points to think of in concerning this but I want to just draw your attention and I'm sure that the the title that the Lord has pressed on my heart will will mean very much to you and I I just say it in this way the background we've been looking at with the depths of God's grace we've been looking at humility and uh one of the things that so uh struck my heart when we were looking at these things is you know the holy spirit will start starts taking you and channeling you into certain thoughts uh within the message and so with from the previous uh few few weeks just over and over I can't even tell you how many times uh where the Lord referred me back and then I just have continued to pour through it and that is the message of a thinking man's filter and so I'd encourage you that even after this morning after we're finished here this morning even through the week and through the time uh to go through and to listen to that and it's just just a wonderful message to glean from of what God has given and provided for us and we want to try to tap into that a little bit this morning so I may we'll just see how the Lord will take us but I want to draw your attention to a few places in our text because the Old Testament itself I know that there is in incredible I was talking with um one particular uh brother here some weeks back and he was speaking of one of the relatives in his family who uh a very good Baptist man but you know and even would uh speak and things like that but he said I've I've never went into the Old Testament at all and I I don't you know not not to really read it and I've never preached from it and I I just say it in this way remember when the Holy Spirit would would speak to the prophet when the squirrels uh right there where they were spoken to existence and he was there up Sportsman's Hollow and he saw those rainbows and even where the same thing that was mentioned there where Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new it's God that has laid down in type all the way through the Old Testament now I I will say this in a manner that with without the Holy Spirit uh giving us direction of this there's many men that have went through the Old Testament and pulled out symbols here and there and but you know God has a way of vindicating what is really the truth behind the symbol or behind the act that was done because everything itself is to point to Jesus Christ everything so if there's anything any thought or any symbol that any way takes away from him from being the same then it's not the right thought it's a thought to be laid aside and say Lord I want your thought so we understand that from the Old Testament into the new the Old Testament when we look at it of Old and New Testament is two books it's that of Groom that of bride because here Christ himself come to fulfill the Old Testament and now through his life now comes forth the new testament which is his life in The Believer so we see within the book two book two books old and new it's husband and wife so there's not contradictory but they are complimentary they are one and so when we look here in the book of of numbers uh uh when we see this the Bible I want to just draw your attention to certain points in here before I go any further it says the red heer must be that sacrifice with no spot no blemish you know it can't even have one hair that's off C not even one hair the rabbis when they look for that even as they started years ago there in the 90s and bringing that back into Israel and looking at it in preparation for temple worship there is such a scrutiny upon that sacrifice you would say well why would that be I want you to think about it because God himself never came down with Hit and Miss he fulfilled the entire book are you with me it wouldn't have been enough just to fulfill this prophecy and leave this one undone because it's a fulfillment of the word of God it was God no one Jesus Christ was no less he was all of God it was God made flesh Among Us so the red heph must have no spot or no blemish and has never can never have been yolked it must be an innocent one yolked meaning that it's never been yolked up with anything so it it can't be something that's been used elsewhere but it some something that has never been yolked it speaks of the word of God himself it's not yolked with the denomination it's not yolked with a man God does not take a denominational truth and bring it forth but God himself it's only God bringing him forth himself forth it also must be led forth without the camp it cannot be killed within the camp remember the Bible says in Hebrews that he suffered without the camp and Paul said let us go forth unto him without the camp is that right and that camp that even that you and I look at is the camp that goes beyond just of of denominational thinking which when we think of denominational thinking a person can have denominational thoughts and not even have the particular name of a denomination they've got their own brand and their own thought line to things but so we understanding that it's beyond the reasoning go beyond the reasoning because man can know God he can reason things out you can reason the truth out man can reason out the scripture man can say this is true and that is true and that's true but you got to go beyond that you got to go beyond that because to go beyond that is to go into the camp of the Living God because you see we must go unto him and go into the camp of the Living God the supernatural go beyond our own ideas go beyond our own thoughts that's what the grace of God comes to call us beyond that and all of that red heer is to be burnt with fire not just parts of it but all of it so it's in it's it is speaking of the entirety of the word of God and all of the parts there's many great things that we could bring forth out of there but like when it's placed in with the types of the cedar wood and you know the scarlet and the hissop and the cedar wood speaking of the Cross and Scarlet speaking of Lamb's wool died red and and that of hup speaking of the common faith and brother Ram says that that's the humility which the gospel should always be presented in so it's all of this must be brought together and with that of the heer and the ashes themselves after what has been offered are gathered by a clean man and they're kept in a clean Place mixed with water and used for a water of separation of purification from sin so and I want you to notice this last part which we read in the scripture there it says it in this manner and it shall be kept for the congregation of Israel God has a specific mind a specific people when God has made a propit tuation and a way this is to be kept for the children of Israel let me just say this to you and this morning me and you both God himself knew that you and I would be here in this age he knew there would be a desire in our heart for him and God has provided for you and I a true filter that we might be free of the contaminants of the world the world system the church system from every defilement of sin and everything that's unlike him God has provided this himself for you and I Lord now the Bible says with that in mind the Bible says in Ephesians 5:22 I want you to think of that of how that it's kept wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their their own husbands in everything now I don't want to get off on this here this morning but when we read the word submit and subjection it's not a demand and it's even greater than just obedience it's honor it's where it's an obedience out of love because one could obey even their husband could even obey the word and it not be correct because it must be in love amen it's honor so now verse 25 husbands here this is this is tremendous husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it who is he he's our he's our husband he gave himself for us what was the purpose of his coming his purpose of his coming is to redeem Hallelujah the Bible said the son of man has come to seek and saved that which was lost so at one time it wasn't lost the gospel isn't God coming down and you know somebody here or there is going to feel sorry for him and you know they're you know have a little bit of an emotional move but it's come to claim back what belong to him this is the savior of the body just like when Adam when the fall had taken place and Eve was moved by an anointing of deception Adam himself was not deceived Adam himself saw what was needed in that hour in order to protect her from the wrath of God it must and it would require that seed of himself to be placed within her and he took her unto himself so where Satan had went to bring the distance God here in a type Adam coming down which would be a type of the second Adam and would take a bride unto himself you and I who were unworthy we and ourselves were unfit we were undone we were born in sin shaped in iniquity and come to the world speaking lies but down beneath that darkness in our lives was always a son and daughter of God and in order in order for the wrath of God to pass over in order for the grace of God to come to you and I it must come to where that God can come down and he unites with his bride once again his children in a union by his Spirit living inside of you and I then these two have become one so I think this is very 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and he gave himself for it when I think of this of the filter of the word of God the thought thoughts that ring through my heart is it's made possible by the grace of God grace made this possible why what what was the purpose that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish this is the purpose of him coming the savior of the body that he might give of himself in order to sanctify and cleanse that this this church his body his wife that he chose before the foundation of the world because remember Jesus said you've not chosen me but I have chosen you you could say well I made a decision to serve God but you couldn't make that decision unless God himself there was a decision already made before the foundation of the world the Bible said in Revelations 13:8 the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and Isaiah when he speaks in Isaiah 53 he's not speaking of and he will and he will but he speaks in past tense that it's it's finished he was despised he was rejected Isaiah was picked up by the spirit of the Living God and he saw the finished work the coming of a redeemer that's why the Sons and Daughters of God shouted for Joy that's why God could take job when job could not understand what was taking place in his life and job was looking all around and God first of all the first place that God would take him to before he ever would begin to unfold to job you're in a process job right now but he first would take him back to the foundation that is sure where were you when the Sons and Daughters of God shouted for Joy Hallelujah so it all speaks of redemption when we read here in numbers 19 it speaks of redemption it's Christ he is that red heer Hallelujah he came down in order to pay the the alls sufficient price for you and I but let me just say this this is where this is where it it becomes different for you and I we're not just looking out on Calvary and saying oh oh how I thank God for a sacrifice but we're recognizing that sacrifice it came to do a real work in my life it came to sanctify me and clean me up it came in order that that life inside of that blood cell might come and bring me into rightful position in the body as the Lamb's wife it's not just a good story this Bible is not a collection of good stories that are somehow fitted to make people feel good or Sunday school eligible this is the book of redemption it's a book of Prophecy hallelujah it's God's mind revealed his will revealed in letter form Hallelujah Bible would say that it was by the grace of God that he would taste death for all men that he who was rich became poor for our sakes for our sakes I want you to think there's a lot of times with filters moving into my point here a lot of various filters No Doubt out with in our mind you can go through a lot of things with that of the filter you know there's every filter itself and uh it always has a specific purpose you have a coffee filter coffee filters for coffee but but why why I mean I love coffee but it's to filter out the grounds and to allow the coffee to pass through the furnace filters that we have they're for a specific purpose they're to allow the air that the unit is drawing through the return to take pull air out of here and whether we need it heated or cooled but the filter is to block out stop unwanted things whether it's allergens or dust so there's purposes there's a reason why you would choose you wouldn't put a coffee filter on the furnace right there's water there's water filters on our refrigerators right sometimes people have water filtration systems on their water coming in their home because it's what they call hard water what do they have to work with but that filter is for a specific reason it's to filter out unwanted things and allow desirable things to pass through it is that right now I'm going to have them here in just a moment I'm going to have them display a few things here you're aware when brother Brandon went through this of a thinking man's filter and uh I just I'm just as the Lord just pressed on my heart with this Bri if you give me that first slide this is this is probably the the only time I think uh here we would have a cigarette displayed in church and believe me I really wrestled with that but you know a couple weeks ago the Lord and I didn't know when it was going to be but he put on my heart for visual cuz sometimes the visual part but you remember when brother Brown talks about he's walking through the woods and he said when he was walking through the woods and i' I've got some things even to say with this here but as he was walking through the woods brother BM says I I happen to look down when he's getting shot at all around and he said I looked down and I seen this cigarette pack and brother BR didn't want to call the name but he says I seen where it was a certain tobacco company and he said' this is what it said a thinking man's filter and a smoking man's taste and brother Bram said I thought if a man could think at all he wouldn't smoke right now let me just tell you of the deception within this brother BR points this out and as I've been studying on this and looking at this I remember growing up as a young boy and I remember seeing on the back of you know fil and stream and you know you go to the barber shops the magazines you news and World Report laying around and you'd see the marbor man and whatever but when I went back into this time frame I saw going along with this same thing I saw what was presented the kind that your doctor smokes the kind that your dentist approves of actual advertisements like this what was it it's to it's a deception to cause the alertness to go down this is okay and so then if you go to the next go to the next slide for me brother Bram said when he read that that slogan and I've got a purpose in coming to this as we tie it together he said he said the slogan he said something seemed to say with me maybe go back to the previous side some something said to me the Sloan's all right and brother BR says it came to me that deceitfulness in the natural realm there in the tobacco is something on the order of churches today a deceitfulness and he says the whole world has become a great deception of what is really true and what's right I mean the prophet is seeing it in seed form there what we're seeing is no longer seeds we're seeing the fruit of it we're seeing and we're living in a day where right is called wrong and wrong is called right we're living in a day and you would if you know you and I were looking at that you would say well that's confusion I want to remind you Babylon is confusion her religion promotes confusion there were those who came out out of there but they went right back to her because the Bible says this had daughters also and she was full of Blasphemous names is that right this is the scripture what's Blasphemous name is to have a name with no life now the deception that's here now go to that next slide if you could this is where and Visually just to now to check in from this because I I I you know I I'm probably certain that every one of us at some point in time but I don't know even for our young kids and I hope for our young ones they never never have to see this and never know of it but to understand where the Holy Spirit would direct the prophet within this particular thing when he would look at that package of where they were promoting a filter in that time and they were promoting that filter as a way of well you know you're not you're not getting anything through it you know you're able to smoke and it's a whole lot less coming through you're not getting anything and brother Bram said here they've broke this down in the World's Fair and and we know this but they break it down and yet when they put the filter on there it's still why would a person smoke because there's a desire for nicotine right why why don't they take this laser pointer and suck on it it doesn't have anything I mean they would know right you don't you don't you wouldn't take the brother B say give them a clothes pin they would say what that's silly why would I suck on a clothes pin because they know the desire they have and there's something they need in order to satisfy that desire and so even with this filter the deception and the deceiving part is it's still it's still nicotine coming through there it's still evil that's coming through there it's still all those things so so it's not as what it's being presented now I want to go in here to the next scripture if you keep that maybe visually in your mind I want to just think here in this in this manner God has never put it in the hands of man to come up with a filter for his soul God has never entrusted he's not entrusted you he's not entrusted me hey come up with a filter try try to make yourself acceptable well what you know God has never done that you know why because God also recognizes that that we even in our reasonings we would do everything to the best of our reasoning but there would still be that which would still pass through it would not be sufficient it would be one man conferring his judgment his thoughts upon another man and we're all condemned are you with me the search was made is there one worthy Hallelujah there was no man worthy the Bible says in Revelations 5 they searched here stood Moses here stood Elijah here stood Jeremiah not one of them was worthy they were wonderful they were prophets of God instruments used in their day and their hour but not one of them could take the book not one of them could do for another righteous men holy men but men that nonetheless were born in sin shaped in iniquities but God said I will provide for myself Hallelujah I will be their atonement I will become their filter I will become their source of Purity that's why reasonings itself will never work and it never has worked but it's God himself that provides the standard and filter for man to be able to stand in his his presence and I don't know about you but I want to stand in his presence that's my that's my whole goal is to enter the Kingdom of Heaven to enter the kingdom of God that's my whole goal is to stand there on that day the Rapture is what means [Applause] everything are you hearing me church this is what decisions are based on in our lives amen numbers or Hebrews n look at this type that was given Paul picks the type and brings it full circle in verse 13 of Hebrews 9 if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh so when man had done wrong when man had sinned God provided a way through the that of the red hepher the ashes thereof to where that the ashes with water could be sprinkled upon that man now let me just tell you something God wasn't going to go and try to just Chase everybody down but you see you say well brother Samuel isn't it God isn't the the goodness and the mercy of God following after me let me just tell you what it is it's the presence of God and if there's something in your heart that desires to be right with God it's because there is a place where you can be right with God and it's God he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me if I be lifted up and so the man Desiring to be in Fellowship where did man get that longing to be in fellowship with God that longing came from God where is that longing that is within you that was in you to long and to search for a living God something you desired that you couldn't even put your finger on it come from God it was God drawing upon your life and when God's drawing let me say this to you when God's drawing upon your life God has the remedy he himself is the remedy for every sin for every habit for everything that is wrong he is the answer let me tell you you can visit a million and one doctors I believe doctors are God's agents but let me just tell you something friends we need something more when it gets down into the spirit realm where there's been wounds there's been things that's been placed there where there's a need of healing there's only one that can bring sufficient healing there in your life I'm talking about the Lord Jesus Christ he's all that you have need of so to s that point up is everything when he's drawing up on your life is because he already has the answer he is the answer it's coming and that the ashes themselves that that mixed with water might be sprinkled upon your life you say what is that that's the word and the spirit coming together right it's not just a it's the water amen the water is the spirit the ashes of the word is the water and the spirit coming together that deals with our life that brings conviction in our life I say thank God for that praise God I don't know about you but do you would you rather go to a church come to a church where everything is padded on the back and my everything's real good that that might suffice okay down here but if there's something within you that really is longing for God you will not be satisfied because there's a thirst there's a hunger for the Living God this type could cling to the purif of the flesh but it never dealt with a desire in man it never dealt with what made him do it in the first place and never brought him into the true relationship and fellowship that God intended but notice in verse 14 but how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience that's your soul from dead Works to serve the Living God hallelujah called to serve the Living God to purge it means to cleanse listen not just free from from from from what has been done but it's also to take care of not just the guilt but the problem sir that's what this purging does it don't just put away it's not just a putting away of the remission of sins but it deals with what is it that caused it in the first place listen friends that's why the gospel comes to direct us to look deep into our life that's why I believe that you know you would not be satisfied I remember in my life I was not satisfied with just the repetitive repentance of the same things over and over and over and over it's something because you're looking and say I continue you to fall to the same things I need a strength I need something we know what's right but I need the life of the sacrifice not just to forgive me but I need full pardoning Redeeming Grace I think you understand friends without me having to break things down in that manner there are things that we have to repent of that has nothing to do with a new birth there's times we have to repent to one another there's times we we we're constantly Before the Throne of God are you hearing me but I'm not talking about practicing sin is that understood now I want you to think of this this purging God himself provided the filter there in the beginning and we understand that even in the hour here where Christ himself stepped forward and he provided himself The Living Word let me say this Peter walked with the living word he walked with the Living Word but Peter he Peter was not able nor the rest of the disciples to pass their life fully through the filter until that word had been offered up once the word had been offered up once Calvary came once the blood had been shed now came forth once Calvary came forth what is it it's the burning of the red heer now from Calvary comes the memorial of that sacrifice and the spirit of God the spirit that was Within in that blood cell comes to seek out the worshippers and call to you and I and draw us and woo us back together but Peter and them could not pass their lives through until the sacrifice was offered up but when that sacrifice was offered up when they stood there that day on the day of Pentecost they were not just speaking good words these words were anointed and quickened by the spirit of God inside of them that had quick their lives to the word the old had passed away and behold all things had become new the filter was the filter himself was on display are you understanding me they had they had this of the law and of the prophets but it could not clean a man's Soul that's why I said very clearly the title of this message is not is not just to say the word is our filter but the word himself because the word is a person yes it's a person of Jesus Christ that reveals himself and the meaning that it has to you and I we're not just looking at him as another oh this is another move my this is good but we look from within our hearts this is my soulmate this is my husband how do you know it's love at first sight I may not be there yet but there's something it's become Nothing Else Matters right now this word is an absolute to my life everything else every other Pearl I get rid of every other Peril I have found the pearl of great price I have found that which will change my life that's how much it means to us I forsake everything else eyes for none other but down Through the Ages man be to tamper with this filter when it entered into listen when it entered into the first age in the Ephesian age man had already started to tamper with the filter not God the spirit of God begin to call out but man begin to Tamper because he wanted certain people in the church you know if they preached in a certain way you know your Aristocrats and your government and your kings and monarchs well they wouldn't want to be around it it's just like the enemy would like to tell you well if you do this or you live this certain way you'll not have any friends let me tell you something there are no friends in hell I'm being very straight there's no friends in Hell there's no buddies in Hell there's no Clicks in [Applause] hell it's [Music] serious it's why it speaks to what is the value of your life right now there's only one who can stand for you and I let me just say this to you on that day it'll not be brother Samuel standing for you it'll not be brother Samuel saying well the Lord they came you know they came pretty regular and they might have been a good tipay I don't know that but I you know whatever it might be it's not going to be brother Samuel the stand has got to be made right now that who is standing for you are you standing for him have you accepted him received his advancement of Grace to your life see God wants to dismiss all fear down here that's what perfect love does and let me just say this too hell is paved with good intentions hell is full of good old boys Brother Sam you shouldn't say it that's straight oh I should I should but I don't say it with meanness I say it because the grace of God that you would understand you could work yourself to death but you cannot work yourself into the kingdom of God God provided a purification for sin God's provided a liberty for it you see what God came to deal is with the inside part now notice I want I have to lay this in this background here that man begin to sew it up they begin to tamper with this filter you find there in the Ephesian age you find it in the pergan age s remember every age and then it gets to a place where God has made a promise I will restore who's going to do this I will restore saith the Lord God begins to raise up justification what does it do it's filtering out the Believers but it's not the complete filter then sanctification comes a little bit deeper right but it's not the complete filter then you have the restoration of the gifts in Pentecost toza street but it's not the complete filter there's an advancement of the light but in the evening time there shall be light in the evening time this is where the scripture could say let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his bride the Lamb's wife hath made herself ready this is why the scripture would say in Revelations 10:8 that the mystery when the seventh angel would begin to sound that the mystery of God should be finished what is the mystery of God it's the Holy Ghost In You amen that's the mystery of God it's Christ in you baptizing you into the body of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah making up that of the bride all the way like Luther the feet and the legs then you have Wesley here the heart the chest the Torso then it comes into the zuza street the mouth are speaking the supernatural comes back among the church but then God promised he would send eyesu and after the eyes have come in and enters the intelligence into the church the mind of almighty God so what is it it's a complete body that is standing upon the Earth brought back by God himself amen the true filter of the word of God this is why brother brandham would make this statement he would refer to the people he said I've just finished preaching on the Seven Seals and brother Bram takes it in there with that sick seal because you're realizing and aware that that six seal is a tribulation seal right I I don't want to go into that and to preach that that's that's a tribulation seal I don't plan on being here but I see great parallels in it and how God affects and influences our life now but under that sick seal it's a purging seal it's a purging there'll be lives during that time that'll make their decision whether to continue with denominational systems or not there'll be decisions that's made that are very important but the bride will be gone let me just say it like this every everything as the prophet said is to be purged under that seventh seal and that seventh seal it is Christ himself that has come among the church I I don't believe this terminology loses you or bothers you but just to bring it down in Simplicity that even when you hear Brother brand preaching the seven seal message and people are looking and saying where's the point where's the place where is it what he said he's laying it out the whole time it's been Christ all along that's why in that message that's why he's rehearsing the Miracles everything that's been done the word restoring that's why and people saying okay what is it and what is it he's declaring what is that I walk on the road of emus it's been Christ here the whole time walking with us and it's a time of unveiling why because the marriage of the Lamb has come and there's a bride on the scene and takes that call of those seven unknown mysterious Thunders to awaken her so that seven seal is Christ [Applause] himself Hallelujah the grace that has come down Through the Ages now presenting himself that I am your husband I am your lord I've come to satisfy all requirements of the Kinsman I paid the price for Redemption I made a way and now I've come to clear every lean against the Church of the Living God that the church might go in [Applause] Rapture this is why there had to come a purging in the church than Lord and that's why the seven seal had to come that's why the this message had to come that's why this message is not another idea of man it's not man ruling over man if you do this and do this and do this you'll be accepted it's the word of God what's been lifted up is the word of God I want to get to a few things here but I want to read this quote my I love this out of the seven seal brother brah says I thank him for Jesus Christ Christ for without sending him for the pritu of our sins we'd all be in a muck of sin with no hope but by his grace his blood cleanses all sin just like the drop of ink in a bucket of Clorox you'd never find the ink again when our sins are confessed it's put in the blood of Jesus Christ they'll never be known again God forgets them they never ever was done and as long as that sacrif I is laying therein an atonement for us then that's all that's it see we're not Sinners no more we're Christians by the grace of God remember in our own selves we'd probably be just as bad as we ever was in our own selves but see the grace of God has appeared to us and that's what's made us what we are today Christian brothers and sisters Hallelujah I want to say it like this brand if you put that other that third slide up there and I'm just going to refer to a few scriptures the Bible says that as she puts that up there the word is our filter in John 522 the father judgeth no man but ha committed all judgment unto the son you see to reject the word himself made flesh is to reject life that's why friends when people walk away from this revealed truth everything begins before the physical starts it's a falling and there's no place to stop Brother Sam you're just saying I'm not just saying that I could give you stories of individuals that once had big churches but because of the compromise on this word now their own family don't even go with them their own family has went away into a Presbyterian Church I'm not saying that to put anybody down I'm saying friends that this word in itself to reject the word made flesh is to reject the Living God the Pharisees the Israel they reverenced the law and the prophets but they couldn't recognize God made flesh and they called him be so what the point that I'm making here is that the word itself remember our thought the word himself is our filter which the person of Jesus Christ is the holy ghost in the form of the word he's the provided filter the purification of sin for the believer and as the entirety of the red hepher was to be burnt it speaks of the entirety of the word of God coming forth in order to bring complete cleansing it's a word bride that's going in a rapture it's not going to be a a bride that oh she's got a broken ankle just just one little word that you know just wasn't able to know it's got to be word on top of word line on top of line precept on top of precept here little there little is that right that's and this is the refreshing the rest it's got to be a word bride this is why Jesus could say man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God this is why even when we look at the Bible in in Revelations 19 it speaks where the marriage of the Lamb has come and is and the description and how it said For unto her is granted to be clothed with the fine R fine Vine linen which is the righteousness of the Saints and it said blessed are they that are called to the married supper of the land for these are the faithful and true sayings of God what are you saying brother Samuel I'm saying God in this hour took what men had cut out and what man said was not important and God said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God God himself and that's why I say the filter of the word we look at this in the filter of the word listen friends how many denominational standards are there thousands I think the last the last count you could you would have to spend almost how many it's 3,000 I thought it was 33 at one point 33 you could spend days of your life trying to find what's right and no doubt some of you God touched your life and maybe you passed through one of them but you couldn't stay there I want you to understand this friends I'm not against the people listen now brother Bram said I'm not against the people I'm against the filter the system I'm not against the people it's the system because the system is deception telling the people they're okay they're all right and when the word of God is opened well you know our our our our our group of men have have learned that it really you know it doesn't matter women can have short hair that ain't what the Bible says well it don't matter you know man can look like a that ain't what what the Bible says but you see look how the enemy wants to even take those things and say well that's insignificant let me just tell you something clothing speaks yes when Tamar herself listen to me now I could spend a month of Sundays on this tamarrow herself when she wanted to get the attention of Judah the Bible said she put on garments of harlotry the clothing sent a signal amen when God came down in the garden it didn't just well they F fig leaves figs are the only plant where there's multiple seeds at once clothing is a sign it's either a sign of rebellion or it's a sign of obedience brother Samuel don't the heart have to I agree the heart has to be right I agree and when the Heart Is Right everything else will get lined up because the control center is in the right place everywhere in the scripture with makeup everywhere in the scripture Jezebel did it not to appear before God I'm saying this for all that's here as it's pressed on my heart for even our young people every time even with makeup and hair through the scriptures when God wanted to speak concerning Israel in Jeremiah in Ezekiel in Isaiah and he would call out their Rebellion he said cut off your hair because it spoke of rebellion are you hearing me friends yeah I'm not saying these things to being indiff this is the word of God and if we look at something and say well that's just a menial thing it's noten it's every word of God and if you want God to do something in your life brother BR said if you won't even let your hair grow if you won't even take off the makeup and quit wearing the pants how can you expect God to give you the Holy Ghost you got to me business with God the Lamb's wife ha made herself ready listen that's not the only words in the Bible let me just tell you also what the prophet said at the end of a thinking man's filter he comes to the very latter part of that and he said and you men he said because I've seen some wearing dresses he said where it exposes they're underneath who we're getting tight now he said right among the Pentecostals and everything else he said that's just as bad my goodness hey I I'm a thinking man are you thinking man thinking woman I'm friends listen I'm not saying these things would be hard God knows my heart but I'm saying it in a manner that hey has called to be the Bride of Jesus Christ every word matters but you realize listen I've got family right in denominational systems that over time they never would have put on anything but a dress but they're counsel these are not just things I read in the message but you hear them where they're allowed to do certain things they cut certain things out and they still condone worldliness condone The Cutting of hair and they lay onto the speaking of tongues as the evidence and on and on say brother Samuel what is that that's called a church filter see everyone can claim well the word is my filter but is it is it right or is it a filter that's got a it allows a certain little bit of the world to come through you wonder why people choose certain things they choose you know why same way we talked about you have a coffee filter for coffee furnace an AC filter for furnace you wanting to keep certain things out and let certain things in and the filter where they'll take this right here how many are holding this today but yet with the ideas of man and man interpretation it's a man-made filter not producing a bride for Jesus Christ but that's where the grace of God has come across our pathway and what an accountability we have are you hearing me because the Bible said whosoever adds to the word or takes from it their part is taken out of the book of life now listen there's some things it you don't you don't need a prophet before it's wrote right here in the scriptures is that right it's wrote there but it goes to show that that's the difference of where a church filter because you see a church filter well you know it it comes down to where they want to take so much of the world but they want to satisfy a desire that's still in there because let me tell you something everything within man man wants to worship I don't care if he's an atheist he wants to worship the Infidel he'll worship his family worship his car worship His Wife she'll worship her husband she'll everything because man is meant to worship religious in order to satisfy a religious part but to think of it even when the Pharisees look look even as we said that when the Pharisees themselves when they came here they with the tradition that was around and they were trying to approach the Lord Jesus but everything was so bound up with Traditions they have made made the word of God of none effect the word could not become effective let me tell you friends the greatest thing that we can do is not just not just to reason with the word but give ourselves to it I want you to think of this here just a moment that Soul itself is the most important important part of our life Bria go to the last slide I I I took this from a there was a I have a drawing of this but I went over this other one here and I want to just take this it's a little hard to read in here but this is a this is man as a Triune being this is how we're made up body these are your five natural senses Spirit here's your five spiritual senses memory conscience affection imagination and reasoning but down in that Soul it's Faith or doubt right that what God is after is this soul to be the control tower all through the scripture the soul that sinth it shall die Jesus said what will man give in exchange for his soul right soul is the most important David said my soul thirsteth for a living God because this is the control tower in man this is the place of God's rest amen when God said let him make me a tabernacle there were three courts to the Tabernacle right you had the Tabernacle of the congregation you had the holy place and you had the holiest of holies God's desire to dwell in the midst of man but there must be a purification for sin there must be that which could deal with that of the sin question because remember the Holy Spirit everybody with me because remember the spirit of God God this is where brother Bram could say how a person he said here they can come into a church and through a church filter a church filter says well you felt his presence and my you know you ran or you dance nothing wrong with running or dancing but well you spoke in tongues or any of that but listen if it never gets down here it's only out here true it's only on the spirit and what happens there's never a change this is why that even gifts a person can be so gifted and yet down here on the inside it'd be dark that's why when the Bible says on that day many will come to me and say Lord Lord have we not prophesied preached in thy name cast out devils and he will say depart from me you workers of iniquity promoting a false filter I never even knew you why they never had a relationship they were anointed but never had a relationship with God that's why the message of the hour I just feel so moved in my heart when I thought of with thinking of this and meditating on it God for our young people for others here we hear of the message of the hour you've heard as it's been poured over but let me tell you how privileged you are to have set before you a thinking man's filter where God himself has provided and kept for you in this generation a wicked generation and you hear that thought the message of the hour I'll tell you what it is it's Christ himself being revealed to you as your sin offering as your sin barrier as your Redeemer it's not just a good teaching it's not just good Doctrine that's why friends listen that's why there's even though I'm not throwing off but that's why I'm saying it's got to go go deeper than just good Doctrine and acknowledging that the doctrine is true there's men many that have acknowledged the doctrine is true now at war against it why cuz you got to know him more than just in your reasoning you can reason now well that's true well that makes sense and that's logical and that's logical you don't know God by Logic you know God by Revelation this was why when we look at this the Bible says remember a thinking man the Bible said a prudent man lookth well off he sees where he's going not just looking here and now for the pleasure that's here now you know because like brother Bram said that the church will allow you to be a member here you're in good standing and this and that but a prudent man is looking far off what he sees and he hides himself he makes preparation for what's coming on let me tell you friends the things that we see see going on in the world and I want you to catch this the people even of the world there's the nervousness people don't realize what's taking place even we see this with Israel but you know what time after time and time again people have become numb numb I'm not against that I'm saying they become numb I'm saying how much for you and I we should not be people that are numb God I don't want to be lwed to sleep you say what do you mean by la la to sleep I'm talking about I don't want to become so wrapped in the cares of life that I'm missing God right Among Us I don't want to become so wrapped in my own life in my own world to where I missing what God is doing and he wants to do in my life you see when you and I came here in this world we didn't come with a with a Fighting Chance in our life as I said many some of you may have started in another place maybe you started in a Catholic Church spoke to your heart you realize that's the only thing you knew I mean hey there's been individuals that had their start on Jesus of Jesus of Nazareth some individuals that got touched on watching a little house in the prairie and where the Bible was open you oh I can't go listen it's it's about what was started it's not about where they are at now I could call out the minister he's a faithful Pastor in this message where that happened but started in his life so it's not it what matters is is that there's something that you couldn't be satisfied right I want you to understand this I'm not going to tear here long there's something within your life this is a message that's a call to Rapture that's right and you couldn't be satisfied there is is there going to be lives outside of the Bride that's saved yes but not in the Rapture I I'm I I think God for his grace that spills over onto that but my focus what I'm called to is to the message of the hour I'm not called because I'm better than somebody else you're not better than somebody else as a matter of fact Esau was a much better man than Jacob look at the scribes in Pharisees compared to uh the disciples look at David's band of Warriors my goodness a bunch of outcasts but you see it's God's looking deeper let me just tell you what that was in your heart the whole time where you couldn't be satisfied it was a seed of God and I tell you that seed of God it was search SE in for the right filter it wasn't you brother BR says it's that seed in you that was drawing but Sam what are you doing I'm putting it all in the hands of God because it's us responding to the quickening power it begin to draw through the word and as our lives begin to draw through the Living Word who is the Living Word it's Christ right Among Us a living God drawing our lives through that it can't draw nothing down into our lives but the Holy Ghost we begin to draw you draw your life through the word right here and listen friends it filters out everything of the world it filters out every habit draw it through there noce just drawing through the word of God through Christ giving ourself to him are you hearing me it's that filter this filter that God's provided that God said I'm not going to let I'm not going to let my bride be manhandled I'm not going to let her have to wonderer and figure her way out but I have kept and reserved for my bride this token in the end time I have reserved for her the true filter of the word God has brought it back into complete expression to our lives to where when you draw your soul through this filter The Living Word of God you come out with a holy man's taste amen you come out with a soul that lines up with every word of God you see why because you can't draw anything through here other than the quickening power oh it's in there in the blood where all the guilty stains are lost it's where every it's where every habit meets the Conqueror of it it's where every sin question is settled amen it's where you're able to walk as a son and daughter of God because there's a filter that's been been provided in this hour that no matter how dark and how Wicked it is but there's a filter where you can filter your life through and there's not one word not one word that your soul can't say Amen to if there's one if there's one thing in there where you say well I don't know brother Samuel that's just you know I'm not sure if that's just really don't don't take that friends well this isn't really that important that's called taking away you can take away from the word without taking a scripture out of the Bible that's right and you can add to it without actually writing another one we want to take it as God has given it and what does it do it produces a son and daughter of God one whose heart and mind is stayed on God what am I talking about I'm talking about the Living Word of God I'm talking about the Holy Ghost I'm talking about God himself coming down into your life to where you and him are no longer Twain but you're one but Sam you don't know of you don't know of all of my past listen the filter of the Living Word is more than enough to take care of all of your past and open to you the victory for the future he's more than enough his blood is sufficient this word I'm telling you to receive that word the word is more than enough to do the work in your life it'll take care of the problem there in the soul and'll bring a real birth on the inside friends just don't settle for anything out here don't settle for anything outside of fully completely surrendered to the word of God you love him are you thankful for the word himself who is our filter Hallelujah amen that he provided for you and I what we would have need of he provided for you young men he provided for you what you would need in this hour God provided he provided what I would need he provided what we would need in our homes as husbands and wives for our children God's provided in this hour and I think just as much as we have screens on the windows to keep out the bugs and other things God's provided a token in this hour he said apply the token and keep Satan at Bay there's an oil on the inside of a believer of a dove you know a dove never has to take a bath because it's got an oil on the inside and that oil on the inside it comes from the inside out and it cleans its feathers amen it cleans its feathers comes from the inside that oil of the holy spirit in the life of a Believer if you should happen to be get entangled if you get cold there's an oil on the inside that comes forth to free you there's an oil see your heart on the inside that's what makes you look to God every moment in your life Lord am I being pleasing to you that's what brings conviction in your life that's what causes you and I to examine Our Lives is because it's Christ dwelling on the throne the church member doesn't care about that but as the Bride of Jesus Christ I care about what my husband thinks I I want to do I want to live the way he wants me to live it's listen I'm not miserable I'm the H one of the happiest man alive he changed me he put his life within me amen it's not something I have to do I don't have to live this way I remember trying years and years ago I remember how miserable that was remember a lot of fear but he came amen he came well I know I sat in a message church I was raised you know here it was until I was 19 years old I tried but you know one day God there's there's there's a time and when I say there's a predestinated time I don't want you to say well I'll just wait till tomorrow you may not have till tomorrow if you feel God tugging at your heart right here this morning it's is the time to surrender all it's a time to lay it all down well what would so and so think who cares what so and so thinks if they're a real believer they'll be there like David saying thank you God for Your Glory thank you for your glory moving down in our midst Hallelujah but to draw our lives through that Living Word what it does it brings an absolute change in our life and it's not just something when we're just changed and we become wow that's a good citizen that's a good person no he's my life he's my all he's the reason of decisions that we make why we do what we do I'm not just what if what if I just as a husband and wife my wife and I what if I made decisions that was just based on me where would my house be where would it be are you hearing me but you see this is why the decisions that we make when when when Christ has been our choice we no longer want our own we've been redeemed we've been redeemed I don't I don't want nothing you say what do you say I don't want to hold nothing I don't want nothing held in my life there's nothing nothing that's worth in this world there's no grudge there's no sin there's nothing that's worth it that's I don't want anything between him and me where does that come from because his love like you heard last Sunday the unconditional Covenant requires unconditional love husbands love your wives even as Christ so loved the church and gave himself for it we are standing here with this Living Word filter of himself because he provided it he provided it he didn't ask me to come up with it he didn't say Samuel you try to find out what's right you try to find out your way but he came by our way Hallelujah and he said my sheep they know my voice amen hallelujah begin to draw through that word change comes in our life as we're taking in the word and drawing our life the only thing that can pass through the word of God the Living Word is the Holy Ghost and then you know what it does it produces a righteous man's taste where we long for him for righteousness and I'd say listen let's just let go and let God have his way I'd say throughout this congregation I know in my heart is these things that God's LED on and I've been very much in prayer with it I in prayer in every service but I just was very even more nervous within this particular service said oh God even as I was leaving out of here last night I said 'lord you didn't lay this on my heart just to give me something because there was already a a subject to be ministered on but God there's a purpose and I believe God has a purpose I believe God's interested when you looking at the message of the hour God's interested so that you can see this is the word himself your filter and look it's filtering every everything through when the Bible says repent that's the first question have you repented have you received have you walked into the water baptism have you been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because it's to pull through the word have you received the Holy Ghost hello that's that's the filter and then your whole life comes through him I say this a thanking man and a thinking woman thinks about where they're going to stand one day and I want to be found standing on his side right now cuz where I stand right now is where I'll stand over there do you love him oh my thank you Lord Jesus as musicians would come I trust the word not not only has been a blessing to your heart but I trust that God that spoke to your heart and I trust within this moment it's just not listen friends even in these Services we just don't want just another service we want to evaluate is everything in my life lining up with the word of God and if it's not this is an opportunity maybe there's something that's laying in your life that you've not made right but as the word is coming forth with the spirit it brings conviction the ashes the water together and it leads you leads you to a place of what reconciliation it leads you to a place the mercy of God that's been kept for you and I in this hour I tell you there are things that I thought in my life I thought when God got a hold of my life how would I ever get Beyond I'm just being honest with you but you you know someone was talking with me here just some time ago said brother Samuel what was it I said he came someone was dealing with certain things and I said talking with him on the phone and I said he came and he took it out of my life I wanted it gone but he took it I I didn't have to change it brother Ryan it wasn't what I tried to change I couldn't change the things I was looking at things I was doing I couldn't change that but he but he L Sam you what happened I just I'm just tell you very simple I begin to draw even as as I'm surrendered in Repentance to the Lord God dealt with my heart I just began to draw did you understand everything no no I I didn't understand everything and I'm not asking you that's not what God's telling you he's saying come to me the alls sufficient Fountain he will give you the understanding that you have need of because you could understand all Mysteries and not have passed through the filter you could have all gifts and not have passed through the [Music] filter is that the scripture 1 Corinthians 13 without the love of God in your soul the Holy Ghost that's why the scripture said whosoever loveth the are the things of the world the love of God and even his heart but begin to draw through this the things of this world Amen begin to flee my language changed lust fled away clothing Things music what was it because there was a desire on the inside that was longing for God and I can't say it enough as the prophet said it was that seed on the inside that was in you already that began to draw on the filter what was it drawing for the quickening power that it needed where is that seed at right down in here it's God's bedding ground it's God's womb and it was drawing how how many can say Lord take me through your filter take me through your filter Lord I stand there as brother BR preached that Lord he said if I got one prayer take me through your filter I say Amen Lord everything all that I am all that I am all that I am take me through your filter Lord let everything in my life that's that's a desire I want him to be reflected is that your desire Hallelujah as we just prepare to have a word of prayer I just just say to you this morning just be obedient to the Lord I'm not going to pull on anybody I it's not pulling but I want to just be mindful of this moment and this time if You' like prayer you're you feel God dealing with your heart you feel in that place that Lord I want to make a stand for you Lord I want my life I want to draw through that filter the filter of the word himself I see it's you Among Us it's you that's Discerning my heart it's you Lord that brings conviction even as I just walk into the sanctuary I feel the presence of God I remember God never said nothing to Adam and Eve they hid themselves because they [Music] knew but why don't you let him take care of that that you can stand in his presence not just here at church but in your home in your car in your life why don't you let him do that why don't you let the word himself who is your filter you could try to cling cling up your life you could try to straighten it up I'll do this or I'm going to No No Surrender it say God I'm not going to try my own filter my own ways it don't work I'm going to take the word himself the Living God testimonies right Among Us not just the word dealing with our life the presence of God been moving around service after service testimonies of the Living God right here in our midst healing that's been done cancer who could do those things but God Amen not just Miracles alone but the word dealing with our life that's him friends he's all of that is because he loves you he cares for you he's making himself known I say this morning with a young old middle I say want an opportunity in the presence of the king himself to move upon that for every life that's here Heavenly [Music] Father Lord the invitation Lord that throughout your word has spoke to our lives Lord I've maybe it's been Lord in a chopped up way but I pray that God beyond all of it that it's been you that it's you that the people could see your love for us Lord the provided way that you made for us Lord that to live in Victory to live in fullness of life where they don't have to live in condemnation they don't have to live below their privileges Lord there's power Lord in the word of God there's power to deal with every sin there's power to deal with every habit there's power Lord oh God a transforming power the Lord takes our lives and changes [Music] us from death unto life there's a transforming power that Lord when we walk into your presence Our Lives Lord are are moved by your your presence that every part of our life Lord that's that's I pray God that's the burden Lord that every part of our Lives to be lined up with you I don't want to just be I I want Lord I don't believe any heart here wants to just be Associated around the church just to be Associated around the message oh God We Want to Love You Lord our heart's desire Lord is within everything and I pray God and your grace sweeping down here this morning Lord I pray that God knowing that there is forgiveness Lord there is Grace there is Mercy like this ashes were reserved and kept for the congregation of Israel so is the mercy of God God kept Lord for your children Lord may you give Grace Lord in every area Lord May Lord we realize the value Lord for lives and hearts just as your spirit would bring a real deep Lord reflection in our life Lord to realize that every decision Lord God is your Prophet I think at the end of that message you would say filter it all through the word of God [Music] Lord it matters it matters to me it matters to us Lord I pray father I know there's Grace Lord here this morning there's Mercy for lives Lord not only to bring that confession along with the word but God grace to go and to to straighten things out Lord if there's a trap that one has fallen into there's no trap That's too great Lord as we pull through the word we find as we pull through the word Lord that like Joshua we're to give heed to all the word that God there's a place as we can walk with you Lord there's a place Lord where life can be renewed and restored I want to say thank you Lord for this filter Lord not the filter of man's thoughts or ideas I'm so grateful Lord but the filter of the word himself thank you Lord Jesus
