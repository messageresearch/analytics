[32:41] we we just thank God for that and so we
[32:45] just it's just it's really something and
[32:48] I forgot about that
[32:49] [Applause]
[32:55] we had that all here coming around this
[32:57] year so we whether Joe Slade was in May
[33:00] and we we were there for that and
[33:02] mentioned that and I just had forgotten
[33:04] where the Brian I certainly apologize
[33:06] for that brother William we were able to
[33:10] be there today and so we just were just
[33:14] so thankful because we know the journey
[33:15] wasn't easy it took a lot of sacrifice
[33:19] you know a lot of study and things like
[33:22] that so well let's just turn into the
[33:27] word is we're there in 1st Samuel 14 and
[33:29] we're just going to read a few verses of
[33:31] Scripture and then I'll continue on when
[33:33] you're seated but let's start at verse
[33:35] 24 now the setting were reading here
[33:40] we're a couple weeks ago on a on a
[33:43] Thursday where Jonathan and his
[33:46] armor-bearer
[33:47] remember they went up and took the
[33:50] garrison there the Philistines and
[33:53] remember Jonathan was there to make he
[33:57] made the testimony that there is no
[34:00] restraint with the Lord to save whether
[34:02] with you know one or with many numbers
[34:07] themselves is not what God needs he just
[34:10] needs surrendered hearts so when we look
[34:15] at this then this is what we're going to
[34:17] read into here tonight is where that
[34:20] when the battle itself when they had
[34:22] defeated there of the Philistines and
[34:24] then now when Israel had begin to move
[34:28] behind what what had taken place there
[34:32] after Jonathan and his armor-bearer had
[34:34] went to the garrison and defeated those
[34:36] Philistines
[34:37] let's read in verse 24 and the men of
[34:40] Israel were distressed that day my what
[34:44] a condition to be in as an army
[34:46] for Saul had a jerd the people saying
[34:50] cursed be the man that eateth any food
[34:55] until evening that I may be avenged on
[34:59] mine enemies so none of the people
[35:03] tasted any food and all they of the land
[35:06] came to a wood and there was honey upon
[35:11] the ground and when the people were come
[35:13] into the wood
[35:14] behold the honey dropped but no man put
[35:18] his hand to his mouth for the people
[35:20] feared the oath but Jonathan heard not
[35:24] when his father charged the people with
[35:26] the oath wherefore he put forth the end
[35:29] of the rod that was in his hand and
[35:32] dipped it in a honeycomb and put his
[35:35] hand to his mouth and his eyes were
[35:38] enlightened then answered one of the
[35:43] people and said the highfather straitly
[35:45] charged the people with an old saying
[35:47] cursed be the man that eateth any food
[35:50] this day and the people were faint then
[35:54] said Jonathan my father hath troubled
[35:58] the land see I pray you how mine eyes
[36:02] have been enlightened because I tasted a
[36:06] little of this honey amen may God bless
[36:09] you bless the ring of the word as you're
[36:12] being seated let's just continue on a
[36:14] little bit if we could here
[36:17] now what's what Jonathan says here in
[36:19] verse 30
[36:21] how much more if happily the people had
[36:26] eaten freely today of the spoil of their
[36:29] enemies which they had found for had
[36:33] there not been now a much greater
[36:36] slaughter among the Philistines and they
[36:39] smote the Philistines that day from
[36:40] McMaster a Jalan and the people were
[36:44] very faint notice how the scripture
[36:46] keeps pointing out the condition the
[36:49] people were in the people were faint and
[36:52] the people flew up on the spoil and took
[36:56] sheep and oxen and calves and slew them
[37:00] on the ground and the people did eat
[37:02] them with the blood then they told Saul
[37:06] saying behold the people sinned against
[37:08] the Lord and that they eat with the
[37:09] blood remember it was not to eat the
[37:12] blood because the life is in the blood
[37:15] and he said you have transgressed roll a
[37:19] great stone unto me this day and Saul
[37:22] said disperse yourselves among the
[37:24] people and say unto them bring me hither
[37:26] every man his ox and every man his sheep
[37:29] and slay them here and eat and sin not
[37:32] against the Lord in eating with the
[37:34] blood and all the people brought every
[37:37] man he has ox with him that night and
[37:39] slew them there and saw build an altar
[37:42] unto the Lord the same was the first
[37:44] altar that he built unto the Lord now
[37:47] Saul makes a decision here if you just
[37:51] bear with me a moment he makes he makes
[37:53] the decision let us go up and pursue the
[37:56] Philistines further and they they
[38:01] mentioned to Saul let us consult the
[38:04] Lord so God doesn't answer them and
[38:07] Saul's trying to figure out why is it
[38:09] God answering what's wrong and then
[38:12] there comes down a lot between the
[38:14] people and Saul and Jonathan love a lot
[38:17] falls on Saul and Jonathan then they
[38:19] separate Saul and Jonathan and the lot
[38:21] falls on Jonathan and so Jonathan was
[38:25] the one as we read in the beginning that
[38:27] had
[38:27] Eitan of the honey and he had tasted of
[38:32] it but Jonathan didn't hear what his
[38:34] father had said when his father gave the
[38:38] order for no man to eat anything until
[38:43] the evening so Jonathan did not hear
[38:46] what his father had said so remember now
[38:49] now that the lot has fallen on Jonathan
[38:51] you know Saul makes makes the statement
[38:54] that whoever it falls on that man's
[38:56] gonna die well notice how that the
[38:58] people want you to watch this now here
[39:02] you find that in verse 43 that Saul said
[39:06] to Jonathan when the lot had fallen on
[39:08] Jonathan tell me what you have done and
[39:10] Jonathan told him and said I did but
[39:12] taste a little honey with the end of the
[39:15] rod that was in my hand and lo I must
[39:18] die and saw answer God do so and more
[39:21] also for thou shalt surely die Jonathan
[39:26] you know we could just preach here for a
[39:28] lot there's a lot of times where you
[39:30] want to be careful on the oaths you make
[39:34] there's another place in the scripture
[39:36] we don't have time to deal with it we're
[39:38] even one of Israel would come back in
[39:40] after a great battle and said I'll
[39:42] sacrifice the perfect the first thing
[39:43] that is all he ended up sacrificing one
[39:45] of his children so you want to be very
[39:48] careful on those things so now let's
[39:51] look at this and verse 45 what how the
[39:53] people rise up the people said to Saul
[39:56] shall Jonathan die who hath brought this
[40:00] great salvation in Israel
[40:04] god forbid as the Lord liveth there
[40:07] shall not one hair of his head fall to
[40:10] the ground for he hath wrought with God
[40:15] this day so the people rescued Jonathan
[40:20] that he died not now I want you to think
[40:24] of this and I want to just tried all
[40:26] this tonight just to just to maybe start
[40:28] in on this a little bit and the thought
[40:31] that just permeating over some time is
[40:34] fasting instead of feasting
[40:37] the Bible tells us in the book of
[40:39] Ecclesiastes that there is a time for
[40:44] everything and we understand that here
[40:49] that Saul has called for the people to
[40:54] go into a time of fast
[40:57] in the midst of battle
[40:59] and you don't want a fast in the midst
[41:02] of battle you need to be feasting or you
[41:05] need to be feeding so it's even at the
[41:09] time of discernment Paul that solve
[41:12] calls for this this removal or this fast
[41:15] and in the midst of battle and I would
[41:18] say to us tonight and from even from
[41:21] this moment forward you never in the
[41:24] midst of battle you never want to stop
[41:27] feeding now what I'm gonna deal with
[41:32] here I'm talking about spiritually
[41:35] feeding you can fast naturally you can
[41:39] fast and pray and that is right on with
[41:42] the scripture but do not do never ever
[41:45] forsake Horta for fast spiritually when
[41:50] you ought to be feasting spiritually
[41:52] because in the midst of that time that's
[41:56] when you really need to be eating now
[41:58] let me just say it like this we are in
[42:00] the midst of the greatest battle that
[42:03] has ever been fought it is not something
[42:05] that's coming it is here it it but there
[42:09] has been a preparation that has been
[42:11] made for us in there and there is a
[42:13] people on the earth who are feeding from
[42:17] the promises of God in this hour and the
[42:21] greatest battle ever fought it is it is
[42:23] such to the place it's a culmination of
[42:26] this hour the Bible would refer to the
[42:29] conditions in this hour that as it was
[42:31] in the days of Noah and I don't think
[42:33] we're in disagreement with that
[42:34] whatsoever the Bible says that the earth
[42:37] was filled with violence through them
[42:40] this is a very time where you you know
[42:43] violence we've seen it even this past
[42:45] weekend once again when all types of the
[42:48] shootings and everything that that is
[42:50] going on and you know people are trying
[42:52] to blame it on this and blame it on that
[42:53] the real reality is it's demon spirits
[42:57] that have been released and if so taken
[43:00] over where humanity is so yielded to
[43:03] them and the enemy is so blinded to
[43:05] people to where they're trying to
[43:07] address certain things and those things
[43:09] are not the reason at all but what it is
[43:12] it's
[43:13] spirits that is actually coming through
[43:14] remember the Bible says the earth was
[43:17] filled with violence through them so
[43:19] there had to the channels that was
[43:21] actually the data was actually set aside
[43:24] violence could come into the earth but
[43:26] just as there was people who were panels
[43:29] for violence to come through there was a
[43:31] man on earth at the time by the name of
[43:33] Noah that he and his life was a channel
[43:36] that righteousness could come through so
[43:39] God always has a witness there's a
[43:41] standard that is always present to rise
[43:44] up against that of the flood of the
[43:46] enemy so we're living in the culmination
[43:48] of the culmination hour that the
[43:51] wickedness of Solomon even as it would
[43:53] speak it's a it's the most deceptive
[43:56] time since the time of Eden and remember
[43:59] within the time of Eden of the deception
[44:01] that took place is to present to Eve
[44:04] that God is a great big loving God he's
[44:08] full of grace and yet which he is but he
[44:11] is also a God of his word he's a God of
[44:15] judgment he said what he meant and he
[44:17] means what he said he will stand upon
[44:21] that word and for those who refuse to
[44:23] walk in that word and recept that word
[44:26] judgment is coming upon them so we
[44:29] understand that in this hour that every
[44:32] demon is released against the believers
[44:35] in this hour it is an hour of warfare
[44:39] and engagement on every hand it is a
[44:42] time that the times of rest are few
[44:46] remember the Bible would talk about how
[44:48] that you would see the persecution the
[44:50] trials and so forth in the book of Acts
[44:53] in the Bible wouldn't go back and say
[44:54] then the churches had rest in Judea and
[44:57] roundabout there were times of trials
[44:59] into that those times of rest are a time
[45:02] that we need to be sure that we are
[45:04] getting refreshment from the presence of
[45:06] the Lord not just wiping our Brown say
[45:09] praise God for the grace of God that
[45:11] brought me through that but to
[45:13] understand and this is scriptural when
[45:15] Jesus was finished when the testing and
[45:18] the temptation was over God specially
[45:21] sent angels to minister unto him that he
[45:25] might be strengthened so God's got your
[45:28] address God knows when the trials gonna
[45:30] come to the end because remember the
[45:32] trial didn't take him by chance
[45:34] God himself made sure that the trial had
[45:36] your address if you changed addresses it
[45:39] got your forwarding address so that the
[45:42] trial arrived on your doorstep because
[45:44] the trial of your faith is more precious
[45:46] than gold but remember every trial has a
[45:50] beginning and every trial has a ending
[45:53] there's times of rest and I think that
[45:57] within the hour that we're living in we
[46:00] see that the enemy to understand he's
[46:03] constantly studying and he's testing his
[46:06] strength you know the enemy is like you
[46:09] know a little brother that you know he
[46:11] realized he can't beat the bigger
[46:12] brother right now so the little brother
[46:14] will kind of you know you know do a
[46:16] little bit of things and you know he'll
[46:17] lift a little bit or he'll do this and
[46:19] do that what's he trying to do he's
[46:21] trying to make another run at it and see
[46:23] now if he can actually outdo the bigger
[46:25] brother the enemy is always testing his
[46:28] strength he's coming at you and I with
[46:32] strength to see it is there a strength
[46:35] within us that is greater now it doesn't
[46:37] matter how many times that he's been
[46:40] defeated we might have got pulled a few
[46:43] inches but within it there's an anchor
[46:45] that is holding us and that is keeping
[46:48] us and by the grace of God there is
[46:51] training that has taken place in our
[46:53] life and is for knocked out punches
[46:57] so what I'm talking about is warfare I'm
[46:59] talking about battle because remember
[47:02] each and every day of our life I don't
[47:04] want to say we run headlong into the
[47:06] devil brother Ram would speak that
[47:08] concerning himself I would say that
[47:10] probably for more of us we run into the
[47:12] imps the the Lord the demons everyday we
[47:15] run into that headlong everyday now when
[47:19] we know when we look at this here you
[47:21] know even though there are times that we
[47:23] would fast in the body from natural food
[47:26] there should be there should never be a
[47:28] fasting spiritually we are we are to
[47:32] stay build up spiritually by praying by
[47:36] itself when you just to look at this
[47:38] with honey and honeycomb you realize
[47:40] that this is an all season and all year
[47:42] round but this is an specific season and
[47:46] here when the people of God were
[47:49] forbidden not to eat during this time
[47:52] and here they were withheld from honey
[47:55] and here was the honey the honey was
[47:57] dropping on the ground here was the
[48:00] honey cold it was something that all
[48:02] they had to do was reach down and pick
[48:05] it up it was there it was made available
[48:07] to them you know I love that I could
[48:09] preach on that a while to think about it
[48:12] that the honey itself there's times
[48:13] where God wants you to climb up and get
[48:16] things is that right
[48:17] but then the honey itself is speaking of
[48:20] that life that it God would allow it to
[48:22] drop to such a place he would not matter
[48:25] where you are at that honey can reach
[48:27] where you're at but in order to get the
[48:30] honey there's got to be a little bit of
[48:32] humility to reach down and pick it up
[48:34] and say I take this and make it mine but
[48:37] here you know Saul has troubled the
[48:39] people he doesn't realize that he's
[48:41] troubled the people but he is causing
[48:43] them to withhold from feasting - from
[48:48] eating and instead they're fasting and
[48:51] you know what wasn't what it actually
[48:53] did it led to the people sinning against
[48:57] the Lord
[48:58] you know I won't ask you to raise your
[48:59] hand but probably every one of us in
[49:01] here have been guilty of this at one
[49:04] time or another
[49:05] where sometimes you get to go Indian
[49:07] without eating food and you get
[49:09] maybe busy about your daily activities
[49:12] or you you know get lost you know with
[49:14] things maybe you're studying in the Word
[49:16] of God and before you know it you find
[49:18] yourself oh my I have an 8 but you begin
[49:21] to get other things coming around that
[49:24] you start getting a little irritable you
[49:26] know your sugar starts getting low or
[49:27] you start getting frustrated or antsy or
[49:30] you start getting nervous or other
[49:31] things like that you know brother good
[49:33] thing about it is your wife can say you
[49:35] know what the problem is you're hungry
[49:37] so you know but the time the thing of it
[49:40] is sometimes when we get to that place
[49:42] we go to start reaching for things to
[49:45] eat that really are not gonna be good
[49:49] for us at all
[49:50] they're not going to help us they're not
[49:52] gonna strengthen us
[49:54] it's not gonna minister sustenance to
[49:57] our life and you know so when we're
[49:59] looking at this now in a spiritual
[50:01] context here here the people because
[50:04] they were in a place of faintness they
[50:08] were hungry when then the battle itself
[50:11] had had a commence and now the people
[50:16] were in a place to pursue after the
[50:19] enemies they only could pursue a certain
[50:22] distance the Bible says they pursue from
[50:26] McMaster a Jalan but remember what
[50:29] Jonathan said how much more how much
[50:32] greater the victory would have been it
[50:35] wouldn't have only been something where
[50:37] the people would have only went part way
[50:38] a third of the way two-thirds of the way
[50:41] or half of the way but it would have
[50:43] been the people would have pursued the
[50:45] Philistines fully if they had not been
[50:49] faint so a real spiritual diet is
[50:53] important in us pursuing after the enemy
[50:56] defeating the enemy and seen to it that
[50:59] the enemy himself is chased out of our
[51:02] land so here you know when you look at
[51:05] it the the you know Jonathan states that
[51:08] of how greater the victory would have
[51:10] been but there was a faintness among the
[51:12] people and I think naturally you and I
[51:14] can relate to times when we're faint
[51:17] when you're weak and you don't feel like
[51:19] hey I don't have the energy I don't have
[51:21] the strength and I don't
[51:22] like I have this to do this but you know
[51:24] that in the natural but here we're
[51:27] talking about and applying it in the
[51:29] spiritual realm where in our life it you
[51:32] know we are constantly in moments and
[51:35] many of the times we're constantly being
[51:37] tested we're in battle
[51:39] there's warfare that's taking place and
[51:41] Anna and it's to be within a within a
[51:44] measure that we and ourselves are built
[51:47] up in the things of God and to realize
[51:50] it that you know it's not something that
[51:52] God will do for us but quite contrary
[51:55] the scripture admonishes us that our
[51:58] feeding our spiritual diet our building
[52:02] up is our responsibility amen so when we
[52:08] look at this here the people were
[52:11] actually withheld from the right thing
[52:14] and when they were withheld from the
[52:17] right thing and then they came upon the
[52:19] spoil begin to just you know killed the
[52:23] oxen and the Sheep and all those things
[52:25] it was nothing wrong with the animals
[52:30] what it was they were consuming it in
[52:33] the wrong manner
[52:37] they were withheld from the right thing
[52:39] but then they went and started consuming
[52:42] but they consumed what would be the
[52:45] right but in the wrong manner now you
[52:49] know brother Randall places it like this
[52:50] in faith is the substance he said you
[52:55] know he said concerning the day that
[52:57] we're living in people he said when
[52:59] they're hungry
[53:00] they'll eat from anywhere if children
[53:02] and people are starving
[53:04] they'll eat from a garbage can that once
[53:07] eat from a nice table but if they are
[53:10] hungry
[53:11] they'll eat somewhere so I think real
[53:13] true ministers of the gospel ought to be
[53:16] up and going and ought to be giving the
[53:19] people the right things meat in due
[53:23] season
[53:24] now that meat in due season it's not
[53:27] just you know teaching of the mysteries
[53:31] all of that has its part because to
[53:32] understand that God has given his word
[53:35] in this hour to you and I and limited
[53:38] let me just say this to you the seventh
[53:40] angel messenger whom God has sinned and
[53:42] vindicated with that truth it was to
[53:45] identify that where we are it's to
[53:48] identify the Living God is present and
[53:52] it is to announce to us the promises
[53:54] that concern us in this hour and to tell
[53:57] us to get ready for the bridegroom is
[54:00] coming so that is all necessary and to
[54:04] see these these as the Bible would say
[54:07] in Revelations 19 the true sayings of
[54:09] God that this word is coming open but
[54:13] also to understand that the meat of a
[54:16] meat in due season that there are times
[54:18] where there has to come correction in
[54:22] our life as well there's times that has
[54:24] to come where though with the Holy
[54:26] Spirit coming through the word and it
[54:28] brings repentance you know repentance
[54:30] itself isn't just something and
[54:32] understand this I believe in the
[54:34] clothesline preaching I believe that's
[54:36] part of the gospel but you understand
[54:38] repentance itself it's not just limited
[54:40] to that there are things within our life
[54:42] that when the Spirit of God is ministry
[54:44] we can see places in our life where
[54:47] we've been letting down we need to be
[54:49] picking up
[54:50] and so the repentance has taken place in
[54:52] our life because this is a place of
[54:54] checking out we want to be examined by
[54:57] the Holy Ghost because our desires we
[55:00] want to be found ready because we
[55:03] believe that he's coming back like he
[55:06] said and that is our hope that is our
[55:09] consolation we are looking for his
[55:12] coming so with that in mind this is why
[55:15] we need the Holy Ghost coming through
[55:18] the word the Holy Spirit giving
[55:20] direction for the hour that we're living
[55:22] in we do not need a man you do not let
[55:26] me just say it like this and bring it
[55:27] from me you do not need my thoughts you
[55:31] do not need even let me say like this
[55:33] you do not need even the things then
[55:35] maybe that God has me looking into and
[55:38] studying and and just saying well and
[55:40] we're gonna deal with this but it comes
[55:42] down to God knows when he opens his word
[55:45] what is the correct season to bring that
[55:48] word forth that what we need is the
[55:50] leadership of the Holy Spirit and you
[55:53] know and I would just say it like this
[55:54] God knows that probably you know earlier
[55:57] on you know when when I was ministering
[55:59] when I first started out you know when
[56:02] God gave me something to preach I just
[56:03] preached it you know so I was just
[56:05] something he gave it to me and I
[56:07] preached it and the inspiration it came
[56:09] with it but you know as time comes on
[56:11] and you you know that that the Holy
[56:13] Spirit and the word you know the word is
[56:15] no longer just like puzzle pieces but
[56:18] now you're seeing a picture it's an
[56:20] entire picture and now it's just simply
[56:23] where you're standing in saying Lord
[56:24] where do we need to focus on what part
[56:28] of the body right now where do we need
[56:30] to go so it's not about what do I preach
[56:32] it's with what that you are inspiring
[56:35] and laying out before me what do we have
[56:39] need of in this hour I think it's just
[56:42] how precise God is you know you know one
[56:45] of the brothers here just even on Sunday
[56:47] when I finished ministry and said you
[56:49] must have been walking with us and the
[56:51] conversation on yesterday they said
[56:53] because we just got done talking about
[56:55] that little white button
[56:58] but you know how many times listen that
[57:01] ain't me I'm not even even within that
[57:04] that even if I knew that what goodness
[57:06] would do if it's not in season it's
[57:08] gotta be and God brings inspiration to
[57:10] my heart and that inspiration sometimes
[57:13] brother Dave let's sit back and look at
[57:15] it I'll say my lord how we gonna bring
[57:17] all this about how's it going to come
[57:18] but I know if he's given the inspiration
[57:21] then he will bring it forth to his
[57:23] children because he's the one that
[57:26] delivers it so with that in mind we we
[57:30] look at this and I'm glad we got a place
[57:32] to come to aren't you I'm glad that
[57:35] we've got a place that we can come and
[57:36] hear the Word of God being preached the
[57:39] pure unadulterated word where the Holy
[57:41] Ghost will move and it deals with hearts
[57:44] and lives and it's changing us and
[57:47] transforming our lives so I believe with
[57:51] all my heart if we look in 1st Samuel
[57:53] chapter 21 we find the scripture here in
[57:56] verse 1 it says David he came to Nob -
[57:59] Amalek the priest and Amalek was afraid
[58:02] at the meeting of David remember now
[58:04] David has already been anointed king but
[58:07] David is running from Saul right
[58:09] Jonathan's just told him daddy means you
[58:12] harm and he said to him why aren't you
[58:15] alone and no man is with thee and David
[58:18] said to Amalek the priest the King have
[58:21] commanded me business and has said unto
[58:23] me let no man know anything of the
[58:26] business where about our Cindy and what
[58:29] I have commanded thee and I have
[58:31] appointed my servants to such in such a
[58:33] place now remember remember when the
[58:35] Lord Jesus would he was called into
[58:37] question there among the Pharisees and
[58:39] they said you know why you heal a man on
[58:42] the Sabbath day remember how Jesus said
[58:44] have you not read that David entered in
[58:48] and he ate that bread which that
[58:51] belongeth to the priest and you see
[58:54] Jesus is trying to get them to think
[58:56] that those men were so if I can say like
[58:59] this so confined to eyes eyes let me get
[59:02] it right now teas eyes and teas but they
[59:05] couldn't see the God inside of the world
[59:09] they were so concerned or confined with
[59:12] the print that they couldn't see and did
[59:15] not know the nature remember what Jesus
[59:18] told him he said you do not know love
[59:22] and mercy and that's the operation of
[59:28] the word the world is not operated by
[59:31] law or by force the word is operated by
[59:34] love faith worketh by love
[59:39] is that right now it would look like
[59:42] what I just read to you it would look
[59:44] like David was telling a lie but you
[59:47] gotta remember what King he's talking
[59:49] about he ain't talking about Saul he
[59:54] said the King hath amendment he David
[59:56] he's talking about the one that David
[59:59] should say thou art my King Oh God
[1:00:02] David was king of Israel but he always
[1:00:04] made sure this there is the King above
[1:00:07] the King here in Israel David was
[1:00:10] letting to know I'm about my father's
[1:00:12] business I am about my father's business
[1:00:15] so there is a need for food
[1:00:20] hmm give me five verse three give me
[1:00:24] five loaves of bread oh lord have mercy
[1:00:26] give me five loaves of bread in my hand
[1:00:28] and what there is present and the
[1:00:30] priests answer David had said there is
[1:00:32] no common bread under my hand but there
[1:00:35] is hallowed bread in other words there
[1:00:36] wasn't just bread in in his house but
[1:00:38] but the bread was handled it was a bread
[1:00:40] that was there in the in the holy place
[1:00:43] that was there you know the outer court
[1:00:45] the inner court and the holiest of
[1:00:46] holies it was there in the holy place
[1:00:49] and that's what he's saying behind the
[1:00:50] bread I don't got no common bread in my
[1:00:52] house but what I have is how old bread
[1:00:54] if the young men have kept themselves at
[1:00:57] least from women and David answered the
[1:01:00] priest and said Albert Ruth women have
[1:01:02] been kept from us about these three days
[1:01:04] since I came in and the vessels of the
[1:01:07] young men are holding oh my there's
[1:01:09] those three days three stages of God's
[1:01:12] grace come on somebody three days they
[1:01:15] had been kept and now what are they
[1:01:17] vessels that are set aside for God to
[1:01:20] move down in and the vessels of the
[1:01:22] young men are holy and the bread is in a
[1:01:26] manner common remember what is it that
[1:01:29] made the bread holy
[1:01:32] it's where the bread resided it's the
[1:01:36] presence of God that made the bread holy
[1:01:39] and David is declaring the presence of
[1:01:43] the Lord is with us and we are with him
[1:01:47] so this bread though it would be common
[1:01:50] but yet in this vessel it is Holland
[1:01:54] oh brother sister don't you understand
[1:01:57] when we're taken in the word oh my this
[1:02:01] world that's rich this word that's the
[1:02:03] Kings word this word that's so precious
[1:02:06] and we look at our lives and say Lord me
[1:02:09] me but he says remember my presence is
[1:02:13] with you I'm coming into power and I'm
[1:02:16] bringing you with me your lives have
[1:02:20] been set aside that this word would
[1:02:24] dwell inside of you hallelujah
[1:02:29] so the priest gave him hallowed bread
[1:02:32] for there was no bread there but the
[1:02:35] shewbread that was taken from before the
[1:02:38] Lord that word Ashu bread it is the
[1:02:41] bread of his face the bread of his

[1:03:29] because as we feed on the word then we
[1:03:33] are formed into the word image now watch

[1:04:00] before me in the presence of mine
[1:04:04] enemies
[1:04:05] Oh glory be to God hallelujah you
[1:04:10] believe that when you're in the midst of
[1:04:11] the darkest of tests and trial that you
[1:04:15] can be in a time of feasting
[1:04:19] how many witnesses I got on that all
[1:04:22] around this building there are witnesses
[1:04:24] of that that in the midst of the time
[1:04:26] when it would look like conditions lend
[1:04:30] itself to gloom and you might feel
[1:04:32] gloomy here and and down you know within
[1:04:35] your spirit but yet within your soul
[1:04:38] there is a deep satisfaction and then
[1:04:41] you begin to think about the goodness of
[1:04:43] God you begin to take on the coming of
[1:04:46] the Lord and you realize that this will
[1:04:49] not always be he is my strength he is my
[1:04:52] satisfaction he is the one I worship he
[1:04:55] is what delight Ian brother let me tell

[1:05:01] presence of your enemy here you are
[1:05:04] feasting on the good things of God when
[1:05:07] this old flesh said I'll just stay home
[1:05:10] I don't feel like it but the inside man
[1:05:13] says get up we're going tonight I am
[1:05:16] going to feed on the things of God
[1:05:18] beings this man says I did it's too much
[1:05:21] I really don't feel real good but the
[1:05:23] inner man says I need to hear from God
[1:05:27] and you know what the truth of the
[1:05:29] matter is the inside man actually leads
[1:05:32] the outside man to a blessing thou
[1:05:38] anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:05:39] runneth over brother Graham said
[1:05:43] children gets hungry if they can't find
[1:05:46] something to eat
[1:05:47] they'll eat in a garbage can but God
[1:05:50] listen this now will produce the food if
[1:05:54] they're just ready to take it and what's
[1:05:57] how he's moving through this how that
[1:05:59] ministers ought to be set aside he's
[1:06:02] dealing with how that the word is to be
[1:06:04] ministered the truth meat and due season
[1:06:07] now notice moving it into this time that
[1:06:10] there is a place that is provided for
[1:06:12] you and I that would God will produce
[1:06:14] the food if we're ready to take it
[1:06:18] now watch this in Psalms 104 verse 1
[1:06:21] bless the Lord O my soul O Lord my god
[1:06:25] thou art very great thou art clothed
[1:06:29] with honor and Majesty now skipping a
[1:06:32] few verses who maketh his angels spirits
[1:06:35] his ministers of flaming fire David
[1:06:39] being a part of the Old Testament he
[1:06:41] still recognized that there were
[1:06:44] ministers because remember David's a
[1:06:46] believer are you with me David knows
[1:06:49] that his great brake brake brake brake
[1:06:51] brake brake brake brake
[1:06:52] granddaddy abraham believed in preachers
[1:06:55] normal help me now because paul picked
[1:06:58] it up in galatians and said god seeing
[1:07:00] and that the heathen would be justified
[1:07:03] preached unto abraham body is a preacher
[1:07:08] now you may not have an apostle prophet
[1:07:11] teacher any of that gift in your life
[1:07:13] but you understand me your life allows
[1:07:16] god a platform my mama God can be right
[1:07:20] there on the job he takes the platform
[1:07:22] in your life
[1:07:23] hey ma'am there's a text that is taken
[1:07:26] in your life and the Holy Spirit will
[1:07:28] actually exhibit and show forth the
[1:07:31] witness of life that causes thirst
[1:07:35] oh this is what David recognized who
[1:07:40] maketh his angels spirits his ministers
[1:07:43] a flame of fire what are they for what
[1:07:46] are the ministers for why what is this
[1:07:48] what is this set aside for remember Paul
[1:07:50] picks it up and says they are to
[1:07:52] minister unto those who are heirs of
[1:07:55] salvation servants is that right now
[1:07:59] watch this oh I love this in verse 14
[1:08:01] look how David picks this up talking
[1:08:03] about bless the Lord O my soul he he
[1:08:05] calls it the grass to grow for the
[1:08:08] cattle
[1:08:10] and herb that's vegetation for the
[1:08:14] service of man that he may bring forth
[1:08:17] food out of the earth well you get steak
[1:08:24] out of cattle and I don't really care
[1:08:27] what what cut you're thinking about
[1:08:28] right now whether it's ribeye sirloin
[1:08:31] filet mignon or whatever it is that
[1:08:33] you're thinking about right now
[1:08:34] if that cow don't eat you are not going
[1:08:38] to be knit you don't end up at some
[1:08:41] fast-food place that we won't call the
[1:08:43] name up but that cow's gotta eat right
[1:08:47] you know and this is just talking about
[1:08:50] you know we want the cows that are not
[1:08:51] shot with antibiotics we want grass-fed
[1:08:53] cows
[1:08:54] that's natural right we're not getting
[1:08:57] into that but you understand people are
[1:08:59] looking at you know there's an
[1:09:01] importance of what I'm eating what has
[1:09:03] that didn't eat don't go home and look
[1:09:09] at your labels tonight under you might
[1:09:10] may not be able to sleep he calls it he
[1:09:12] de who does the lord cosa the grass to
[1:09:16] grow he knows the cattle needs grass and
[1:09:19] he causes the grass to grow
[1:09:23] whether you might water it you might
[1:09:25] fertilize it you might do everything
[1:09:27] else but it is not that that makes it to
[1:09:30] grow there's a germ within that grass
[1:09:32] when the conditions are right the grass
[1:09:34] will grow and he make herb for the
[1:09:39] service of man that he may bring forth
[1:09:40] food out of the earth and lying that
[1:09:43] make us glad the heart of man and oil to
[1:09:47] make his face to shine and bread which
[1:09:49] strengtheneth man's heart I want you to
[1:09:53] think about this how all the processes
[1:09:56] had to go through
[1:09:58] in order for these things to be eat
[1:10:03] enough
[1:10:09] in order for you and ad to eat certain
[1:10:11] fruits you say well it's an apple tree
[1:10:14] it's going to grow apples it won't
[1:10:16] unless it's been pollinated you with me
[1:10:21] well it'll just grow tomatoes no it's
[1:10:23] got to be pollinated that's why you get
[1:10:24] flowers flowers are not for what we look
[1:10:27] at flowers at home that's so beautiful
[1:10:29] hold that apple tree in the spring oh my
[1:10:32] look at those bosses those blossoms are
[1:10:34] not there for you to admire those
[1:10:36] blossoms are there and what is to come
[1:10:39] out of that is there's going to come
[1:10:41] forth the fruit that will conceal a seed
[1:10:44] that has alive that is the same life
[1:10:48] that's in that tree it's a thing all
[1:10:51] it's a process of reproducing itself are
[1:10:54] you with me now so to think of the
[1:10:57] process you and I were not out there and
[1:10:59] saying well come on bees bees come on
[1:11:01] come on come on bees bees come on I need
[1:11:04] you to come over here this this tree and
[1:11:05] then listen there's what I need you to
[1:11:07] do I need you to go from this flower to
[1:11:09] this flower I need you to get in here
[1:11:11] you know to this pistol I need you to
[1:11:13] prove into this I need you to do that
[1:11:15] you don't have to do that it's within
[1:11:18] bees to do that
[1:11:19] bees are living creatures that know how
[1:11:23] to bring germination they themselves
[1:11:27] don't do it you know just that they're
[1:11:29] the ones that as far as they know what
[1:11:31] they're doing they're just in there
[1:11:32] getting the nectar but as they're
[1:11:33] rubbing around all that stuff is coming
[1:11:35] off of them don't you understand what I
[1:11:37] mean it takes living creatures to cause
[1:11:41] life to pass think with me scripturally
[1:11:44] now God said I'm calling you to a land
[1:11:47] flowing with milk and honey what was he
[1:11:51] let them know this is a land of living
[1:11:54] creatures the lion hallelujah the ox the
[1:11:59] man the Eagle the presence of God is
[1:12:03] here in this land that's what God was
[1:12:07] letting them know they're bees that
[1:12:09] pollinate hallelujah
[1:12:12] that grass can grow the cattle can grow
[1:12:17] God's let them know I've got all of this
[1:12:21] taken care of and on top of that job
[1:12:27] said I've got oil I got one that'll make
[1:12:30] your glow you're glad
[1:12:31] make your heart glad in that something
[1:12:34] godly ones just thinking of our food but
[1:12:37] he said I want to make your heart glad
[1:12:39] sometimes you see people walking around
[1:12:41] so sad but you see you get to drinking
[1:12:44] home this wine let drink on that one and
[1:12:46] let that one move within your life
[1:12:48] brother he it takes sadness away I'm not
[1:12:54] saying they're not times where things
[1:12:56] were down but you got you understand
[1:12:57] what I'm saying it depends on what
[1:12:59] you're drinking amen if what your drink
[1:13:04] is not strong enough get a hundred proof
[1:13:05] wine get some wine that's gonna put some
[1:13:08] joy down on the inside amen drink some
[1:13:12] of that wine Oh mom before you know it
[1:13:15] you lose track of yourself
[1:13:19] hallelujah it's a complete cycle that's
[1:13:23] what I want you to see in in Psalms 104
[1:13:25] look how God even mentioned this in
[1:13:27] Ezekiel 20 verse 6 in the day that I
[1:13:30] lifted up my hand unto them to bring
[1:13:33] them forth out of the land of Egypt into
[1:13:35] a land that I had searched out or is
[1:13:38] spied for them flowing with milk and
[1:13:41] honey which is the glory of all lands
[1:13:46] I'm telling you where we are living is
[1:13:50] the glory of all ants I'm not talking
[1:13:52] about this nation I'm talking about in
[1:13:56] the Holy Ghost in cries and the promises
[1:14:00] of the sound this is the glory of all
[1:14:03] lands
[1:14:08] what's the same process in Revelations
[1:14:10] 10 verse 8
[1:14:12] this is after the seventh angel has
[1:14:16] sounded forth and the voice which I
[1:14:21] heard from Earth
[1:14:24] not in what it said but the voice I
[1:14:28] heard from heaven spake unto me again
[1:14:31] see it's so important that we're not
[1:14:33] just hearing an earthly voice because of
[1:14:37] all you hear is an earthly voice then
[1:14:39] there's no continuation but it wasn't an
[1:14:44] earthly voice it's a heavenly voice come
[1:14:49] on somebody amen and the which I heard
[1:14:53] from heaven spake unto me again and said
[1:14:56] go and take the little book which is
[1:14:59] open in the hand of the angel which
[1:15:01] standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:15:04] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:15:07] him give me the little book and he said
[1:15:10] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[1:15:13] shall make that belly bitter but it
[1:15:15] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey let
[1:15:19] me just tell you something
[1:15:21] there are supplied digestive juices
[1:15:25] there within that seed that God placed
[1:15:28] within you and when it has been
[1:15:30] quickened there it has the ability to
[1:15:32] digest and bring that word from word to
[1:15:36] flesh and I took the little book out of
[1:15:41] the Angels hand talking about the mighty
[1:15:43] angel I took it out of his hands and I
[1:15:45] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:15:48] as honey and as soon as I had eaten it
[1:15:50] my belly was bitter
[1:15:55] how many know the hard part isn't saying
[1:15:58] Amen to it the hard part about is dying
[1:16:01] daily yes sir my belly was bitter you
[1:16:06] know you go to a restaurant oh my oh
[1:16:08] look at those rolls smell that yeast
[1:16:12] that cinnamon butter oh my and that
[1:16:16] steak and you go ahead and eat it and
[1:16:18] then after you get done eating it yeah
[1:16:20] ha ha ha I too much
[1:16:22] I shouldn't hate all that South line
[1:16:26] you'll do the same thing again 400 them
[1:16:33] too much but notice this he said unto me
[1:16:36] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:16:42] peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:16:45] kings
[1:16:48] mmm-hmm hey man now I want you to watch
[1:16:52] this this cop here just a moment hear
[1:16:54] the word again was used twice is that
[1:16:57] right that word again is a word here in
[1:17:01] the Greek it means the idea of a Silla
[1:17:06] Tory repetition and what that of a Silla
[1:17:09] Tory repetition is a circuit it's like
[1:17:12] that of an electrical circuit it keeps
[1:17:15] on it comes from the source and it comes
[1:17:17] right back to the source that's sending
[1:17:18] it it keeps on coming it keeps on moving
[1:17:21] in that way you see the word of God it's
[1:17:25] not something that is just sown in our
[1:17:27] hearts and we say well praise God I got
[1:17:30] that I understand that no the only way
[1:17:32] we understand it is when it brings forth
[1:17:34] in our life and when it brings forth in
[1:17:36] our life then here we are actually even
[1:17:39] not just by hearing it but by doing the
[1:17:42] Word of God we are living from that word
[1:17:44] that word is becoming manifest in our
[1:17:46] life but remember every word is a seed
[1:17:49] and it brings forth a crop so in the
[1:17:53] crop comes forth we eat but then we eat
[1:17:57] to have strength to sew back what we
[1:18:00] have received and when you sew it back
[1:18:02] then what happens more comes from what
[1:18:05] your soul it's not a diminishing of the
[1:18:09] things of God it is an increasing it's
[1:18:14] an abounding that's why when you can
[1:18:17] look at it especially even the older
[1:18:19] ones or anybody been serving the Lord
[1:18:20] for any length of time you can look at
[1:18:22] and say mind you know I don't know what
[1:18:24] it is but you know just right now it
[1:18:25] just seems like the word is it's more
[1:18:27] clear it's more precious to me it's more
[1:18:30] well that's that's how the word should
[1:18:31] be what is it it's because of that of
[1:18:33] Silla Tory repetition it's been taken in
[1:18:36] it's been digested you've had to die to
[1:18:39] it but then the word has been sown back
[1:18:42] and the word is becoming greater and
[1:18:45] greater and greater and greater why
[1:18:48] because you saw it back you harvested
[1:18:50] and eat of
[1:18:51] and that's why the things that we are
[1:18:53] hearing that the Spirit of God not man
[1:18:56] is bringing to you and I it shows even
[1:18:59] where the maturity is at from the seed
[1:19:03] that's been received and so bad and has
[1:19:06] been tended to harvested ain't so bad
[1:19:09] you see it is a repetition that's why I
[1:19:17] rejoices my heart when I see young ones
[1:19:20] coming in or when I see souls coming in
[1:19:22] why it's the effect of the word that has
[1:19:26] been received not just preached not just
[1:19:31] preached it's got to fall into good
[1:19:33] ground then what does it do you take of
[1:19:39] it eat of it and so back into the earth
[1:19:45] hello glory be to God well that's
[1:19:49] exactly the way that the rapture is
[1:19:51] going to be you see this is why praying
[1:19:56] for the services is so important and
[1:19:59] this is where let me just let me just
[1:20:00] say oh I just just trying to really lay
[1:20:03] here in these moments just real teach
[1:20:05] and I want you understand just just
[1:20:07] laying it in to where the rubber meets
[1:20:08] the road
[1:20:08] Amen like baloney in the lunch box you
[1:20:11] take it with you apply to your life it's
[1:20:14] why praying for services the enemy will
[1:20:18] try to fight everything he can you know
[1:20:20] that before even coming to service and
[1:20:23] even today and I I know where you go
[1:20:25] through a work week and you know you
[1:20:27] don't come out of work today but you
[1:20:29] understand what I'm saying
[1:20:30] even your sacrifice of even you praying
[1:20:34] and you may not have but a smidge it's
[1:20:36] worth of time but you say Lord you know
[1:20:38] my heart and then throughout the day
[1:20:40] you're praying in your heart you know
[1:20:42] the Bible it says pray always
[1:20:45] is that right praying always amen so
[1:20:49] here we want to pray for the services
[1:20:51] and say the Lord would you come down and
[1:20:55] minister to our needs those needs that
[1:20:59] you see and you know about wood and
[1:21:03] there's needs on our hearts in this
[1:21:06] service we're gonna set and we're going
[1:21:09] to pray in our hearts while the word is
[1:21:11] coming forth and expect God to come to
[1:21:16] our tent door closed he promised it his
[1:21:20] coming is not a chance
[1:21:22] it's a promise he said wherever two or
[1:21:25] three are gathered together I will be in
[1:21:28] your midst is that right
[1:21:30] he told Abraham the previous chapter
[1:21:33] I'll visit Sarah according to the time
[1:21:35] of life in this coming year so Abraham
[1:21:38] was sitting in the tent door wait I
[1:21:41] wonder how many fellas he saw go by no
[1:21:43] doubt a lot but there was something
[1:21:45] about this one
[1:21:46] why was he sat in the tent door because
[1:21:50] God had already told him he's coming God
[1:21:54] said I'm coming with a message I'm
[1:21:56] coming with a message I'm coming with a
[1:21:58] message gets her as well Abraham said
[1:22:03] I'll be waiting
[1:22:06] after he stopped laughing after he got
[1:22:11] over the even Layton so in the service
[1:22:17] we're gonna be expecting and praying
[1:22:19] while we're listening and feeding on the
[1:22:22] Word of God this is why brother Branham
[1:22:25] would talk about how you know in every
[1:22:27] aspect of the service it talks about the
[1:22:30] song service how the song service its
[1:22:33] create an atmosphere of worship now I
[1:22:37] just say it like this and I don't make
[1:22:38] no apologies and nobody but you know
[1:22:40] what we may not worship like other
[1:22:42] people do and that's fine as long as
[1:22:44] other people don't want to try to take
[1:22:45] the way that they do it and try to apply
[1:22:47] it here I do not want a pattern after
[1:22:50] Branum Tabernacle sorry that's not my
[1:22:52] objective
[1:22:53] I want a pattern after the leadership of
[1:22:56] the Holy Spirit amen brother Branham
[1:23:00] gave direction there are things that he
[1:23:01] put down and you all know this some of
[1:23:03] you are older you understand and know
[1:23:05] this this has seemed like it's been a
[1:23:07] battle through the ages we're people
[1:23:09] people not ungrounded and not having
[1:23:12] discernment get a hold of the church
[1:23:15] order and what they want to do they want
[1:23:17] to make sure everything's so cut-and-dry
[1:23:20] they want God to come according to how
[1:23:23] they want God to come and how they think
[1:23:25] he ought to come brother sister that's
[1:23:27] not God that's an idol you've got people
[1:23:32] that have all kinds of things drawn up
[1:23:33] well brother Branham did this from
[1:23:34] another end that would you there did you
[1:23:36] meet him well no I have just listened
[1:23:38] escaped but not just this unjust that so
[1:23:39] you don't know and you weren't there and
[1:23:41] your call you're creating all of this
[1:23:43] that's called an idol you don't know but
[1:23:48] there are listen what is the whole
[1:23:51] preface or what is the whole principle
[1:23:54] that was laid down that Christ is to be
[1:23:58] the exalted one the one who has lifted
[1:24:01] up all of our worship everything is to
[1:24:05] point to him it's to glorify the Lord
[1:24:07] Jesus Christ the ministering of the word
[1:24:10] is to glorify Him
[1:24:13] and if that's our focus then I'll tell
[1:24:15] you what there'll be a lot of things
[1:24:17] where people will see the similarities
[1:24:19] but what they'll see the similarities is
[1:24:21] that Jesus Christ is the focus and I
[1:24:26] hope that don't miss thing you a little
[1:24:27] bit but you know where I stand on it
[1:24:32] because there's a lot of things that
[1:24:34] people can look at in this like I told
[1:24:37] you the other day
[1:24:38] there's people can look at things and
[1:24:40] they'll call they'll say things and I'm
[1:24:42] an under one I really want to go into it
[1:24:44] they'll say all sorts of things and what
[1:24:46] it is they're reading quotes without
[1:24:48] discernment of the Spirit if you've got
[1:24:52] any little bit of emotion in your
[1:24:54] worship your Pentecostal what is that
[1:24:58] lack of discernment reading the quotes
[1:25:04] well the real truth of it is in my sting
[1:25:07] and say outs or no man but the real
[1:25:09] thing that would help a whole lot of
[1:25:10] people if they would just get under a
[1:25:12] godly pastor who's filled with the Holy
[1:25:15] Ghost who can take the word balance that
[1:25:18] were not the man but there's a gift in
[1:25:20] his life that would help them so they're
[1:25:22] not unrest and unstable and wandering
[1:25:25] around and wobbling around God makes you
[1:25:27] to be in position I'm not here to preach
[1:25:35] on all those things but I'll tell you
[1:25:37] you know this is what we stand for this
[1:25:39] is what we believe we believe in genuine
[1:25:42] worship if somebody believes and says
[1:25:45] we'll always should sing is the only
[1:25:46] belief songbook brother branham never
[1:25:48] said that you said that when brother
[1:25:52] brems said we ought to sing
[1:25:53] old-fashioned hymns you understand what
[1:25:55] he's talking about it's words it's songs
[1:25:58] that have meaning to them
[1:26:02] not make a tradition that every church
[1:26:06] has gotta have a hymnal and the only
[1:26:08] songs we can sing or out of a hymnal and
[1:26:10] it's kind of come out of and only
[1:26:12] believe songbook man has done that not
[1:26:16] the Holy Ghost I'm not against nobody I
[1:26:22] love everybody but if that's how
[1:26:24] somebody believes then maybe this thing
[1:26:27] to church for you
[1:26:34] because I'm gonna sing I believe he's
[1:26:36] coming back like he said I'm gonna sing
[1:26:40] he's away maker because I know him to be
[1:26:42] away maker are you with me you see this
[1:26:48] is where it takes discernment it's not
[1:26:51] just taking quotes about drums and this
[1:26:53] and that and going and playing then it's
[1:26:55] Clemen and held those things out there
[1:26:57] loosely it's about having real spiritual
[1:27:00] discernment this is an our friends where
[1:27:04] spiritual discernment is necessary I
[1:27:08] mean my lord you'd have to get rid of
[1:27:11] the whole Book of Psalms then I'm not
[1:27:13] you understand I am not upset at the
[1:27:15] least a little bit but I want you to
[1:27:17] understand worship itself you don't know
[1:27:19] how that worship service is gonna go I
[1:27:22] mean it might be you know it is well
[1:27:24] with my soul it might lead into further
[1:27:27] along and then you come on Sunday
[1:27:29] morning and here they are by and by when
[1:27:32] the morning comes
[1:27:33] why because just as much as God leads
[1:27:37] the minister he's gonna lead the song
[1:27:39] leader
[1:27:42] I want people to feel free I want people
[1:27:49] to worship that listen that doesn't mean
[1:27:51] that I put a stamp on everything there's
[1:27:53] things that maybe have been sung and I
[1:27:55] said nope no more there's things that I
[1:27:58] believe I believe it ought to be a
[1:28:00] holiness within our worship I believe
[1:28:02] there ought to bring the presence of God
[1:28:04] now let me just tell you something as
[1:28:06] much as a person could be judgmental
[1:28:09] about music and songs or whatever more
[1:28:11] let me tell you something a critical
[1:28:13] resentful spirit will keep the Holy
[1:28:15] Ghost out of the meeting are you with me
[1:28:22] critical spirits are dangerous friend
[1:28:25] because all it is it becomes a pool for
[1:28:28] other spirits to come to Hey when
[1:28:32] brother Randall when they were Devils
[1:28:33] being cast down remember where do those
[1:28:35] epileptic demons go they went to those
[1:28:38] who were being year Everett you know how
[1:28:42] it is you might go to a church and I
[1:28:44] might go visit to a different church
[1:28:46] when you go to a different Church you
[1:28:48] remember every Church he is sovereign
[1:28:52] how did we get here every Church is
[1:28:59] sovereign when I go somewhere hey listen
[1:29:01] if they believe in singing standing on
[1:29:04] your feet the whole service what are you
[1:29:05] gonna be doing how stand on my feet the
[1:29:07] whole service
[1:29:16] and if so all of the atmosphere is sent
[1:29:18] right so then when the minister comes
[1:29:21] out brother Ram said when a minister
[1:29:23] walks into a congregation of people
[1:29:25] praying in the anointing of the Spirit
[1:29:28] you're bound to hear from Hitler
[1:29:31] that's just all there's no way to keep
[1:29:34] from it
[1:29:35] look at this in proverbs 31
[1:29:39] now what's what's what's what's how the
[1:29:42] Lord has taken us here he's bringing it
[1:29:44] on down even to a responsibility for the
[1:29:47] food that were to partake of there's a
[1:29:49] responsibility that Minister has
[1:29:52] congregation has are you with me now
[1:29:56] watch this proverbs 31:10 who can find a
[1:30:00] virtuous woman for her price is far
[1:30:03] above rubies the heart of her husband
[1:30:07] does safely trust in her so that he
[1:30:10] shall have no need of spoil
[1:30:16] she will do him good and not evil all
[1:30:19] the days of her life
[1:30:21] who can find a virtuous now this is
[1:30:23] speaking of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:30:28] now watch this in verse 14 she is like
[1:30:34] the merchants ships
[1:30:37] what do merchant ships bring goods where
[1:30:43] do they bring goods from from an unseen
[1:30:46] shoreline they bring it from distant
[1:30:50] shores to a destined sure she is like
[1:30:56] this is what she's likened unto
[1:30:58] merchants ships now how'd you hit that
[1:31:01] wonderful not just a merchant ship but
[1:31:04] merchants ships this is what she's like
[1:31:07] why because remember she don't just have
[1:31:10] pastors she'd got evangelist come on
[1:31:14] somebody
[1:31:14] she consist I'm using the words of the
[1:31:17] Prophet she consists of and he goes
[1:31:20] through the five ministerial offices she
[1:31:22] consists of nine spiritual gift she does
[1:31:25] listen you're a part of that it's not
[1:31:27] something lesson that the Ministry
[1:31:29] appear in this and no it's all together
[1:31:32] when it says she is is talking about all
[1:31:35] of us amen we are loaded with precious
[1:31:41] cargo
[1:31:44] whoo the merchant ships are coming where
[1:31:48] they coming from
[1:31:49] Oh they've been over there visiting
[1:31:51] Tyree they got gold with them
[1:31:54] whoa I see that merchant ship what's
[1:31:57] that one oh that's got the filet mignon
[1:31:58] on it it suggested just a second no it's
[1:32:02] loaded with filet mignon what's that one
[1:32:07] oh that's got rice on it who's got
[1:32:12] potatoes on it
[1:32:14] I know I'm simple but you God God just
[1:32:20] uses my simple little humanity I have to
[1:32:22] try to get a point across I wish I had
[1:32:24] better examples but you can tell what I
[1:32:27] like and God just happens to use that so
[1:32:30] he has a real sense of humor so to think
[1:32:32] of this it's lacking unto merchant ships
[1:32:35] that brother just wait you can't see you
[1:32:37] don't see the shore where that merchant
[1:32:39] ship was but that ship had to make the
[1:32:42] journey to a distant Shore that you
[1:32:45] can't see and that had to be a purchase
[1:32:47] made and there had to be a cargo placed
[1:32:50] on there and then there that ship comes
[1:32:53] back with that cargo that ship has an
[1:32:56] ordained port let me tell you something
[1:33:00] God has all of this orchestrated he
[1:33:04] knows where he's directing the merchant
[1:33:06] ships he knows where the docks and the
[1:33:09] chapters and the verses and what is to
[1:33:12] be loaded in there he knows the
[1:33:14] inspiration striking here and the
[1:33:17] message that he's given of how this will
[1:33:19] stand the house and this will stand out
[1:33:21] and what does he do he loads up the
[1:33:23] merchant ship and says head on back
[1:33:26] there oh my it comes into Shore and what
[1:33:29] does it do it deposits those heavenly
[1:33:33] Goods not in a warehouse it deposits it
[1:33:41] in living Tabernacles oh this one right
[1:33:50] here okay it goes right here oh this one
[1:33:52] right here goes right here oh this one
[1:33:56] right here it goes right here and you

[1:34:04] what it was

[1:34:08] in the merchant ship and you believed it
[1:34:13] you expected it you were praying for it
[1:34:16] and that's why it could work that's why
[1:34:19] there was a merchant ship going to an
[1:34:22] unseen force because you're praying you
[1:34:25] got needs you've got desires and God
[1:34:28] brings it in God sends it back club
[1:34:30] brings a tear drop sends it back you
[1:34:31] understand what I'm saying I'm going

[1:34:46] to God amen it comes from with heavenly
[1:34:49] places hallelujah and you know what it

[1:35:48] that he has had laid in from me verse 15
[1:35:57] can I have just a couple more minutes
[1:35:59] let me just try to close out this
[1:36:01] scripture here she rises
[1:36:09] notice how the scripture said she rises
[1:36:12] why her light has come she rises she has
[1:36:18] strength to rise when the Sun Goes Down
[1:36:20] the moon rises she Rises also while it
[1:36:25] is yet night the church ages the time of
[1:36:29] night a time of darkness the church is
[1:36:33] to shine in the absence of the Son of
[1:36:37] God are you with me and he is walking in
[1:36:41] the midst of the seven golden
[1:36:42] candlesticks he is our life
[1:36:45] he is our illumination he is our all at
[1:36:48] all
[1:36:49] we are vines of the brand we are
[1:36:53] branches of the vine amen we are
[1:36:56] declaring the moon she rises and while
[1:37:00] it is yet night oh it's darkness of
[1:37:02] night but she rises up and what does she
[1:37:05] do she gives him meat to her household
[1:37:08] in the midst of darkness but yet here
[1:37:11] she is giving me to her household aren't
[1:37:14] you glad to be part of the household of
[1:37:15] faith
[1:37:17] Abraham's household amen Abraham's seed
[1:37:21] amen there's meat provided for you and I
[1:37:23] amen there has been food that has been
[1:37:26] stored up and the same Holy Ghost that
[1:37:30] stored it up is the same Holy Ghost
[1:37:33] that's revealing it and giving out that
[1:37:35] word just as we have need of it what is
[1:37:41] she she rises up and a portion to her
[1:37:44] maids you know what it is she's a
[1:37:46] faithful steward she is giving out a
[1:37:49] food to sustain her household through
[1:37:51] the darkness it's a darkness that can be
[1:37:53] felt there's demonic oppression and
[1:37:56] spirits everywhere but she rises in the
[1:37:59] midst when she could cave him she could
[1:38:02] give him she could lay down but there's
[1:38:04] a power within her that she can't lay
[1:38:07] down it's a power that rise
[1:38:10] raises up and she gives meat in due
[1:38:14] season you realize your prayers is what
[1:38:20] brings him on the scene he comes on the
[1:38:24] scene but to think about it you can come
[1:38:27] to a service and what it does to your
[1:38:29] heart as a believer it just just
[1:38:31] something for you as he shows up and
[1:38:34] begins to minister to his children let
[1:38:38] me just tell you something as a pastor
[1:38:40] sometimes I can set and I look at things
[1:38:42] and maybe somebody's singing a special
[1:38:44] or here they are entering into the word
[1:38:46] and you see what's going on I'll tell
[1:38:48] your brother they might have every bit
[1:38:50] of right to just coward the hell and lay
[1:38:53] down but in the midst of the time here
[1:38:55] they are they're lending their lives as
[1:38:58] a sacrifice and you watch the Prince of
[1:39:00] God come right down and begin to move
[1:39:03] down upon that life why it invites the
[1:39:06] presence of God for he dwells in the
[1:39:09] praises of his people
[1:39:13] she's like Ruth she goes out and gets
[1:39:17] handfuls of purpose seeing just gleaning
[1:39:21] in any field brother she's in Boaz's
[1:39:24] field

[1:39:37] fault in you there's a blood that
[1:39:39] speaketh for you that speak of better
[1:39:42] things they met a word that is able to
[1:39:46] transform her from a mower batters to a
[1:39:49] daughter of God to a princess of God to
[1:39:52] one in the very Kings lineage what did
[1:39:54] that the very presence of Almighty God
[1:39:58] she's dwelling in his field giving out
[1:40:01] portions that are needed and brother

[1:45:05] he will bring correction
[1:45:13] I think probably correction how probably
[1:45:15] done more correction behind closed doors
[1:45:17] then probably what our just as much as
[1:45:19] what has come across the pulpit but
[1:45:20] sometimes that's how God directs it I
[1:45:23] don't get to choose that he does but I'm
[1:45:27] glad
[1:45:29] you understand what I'm saying
[1:45:30] correction itself is not joyous
[1:45:35] but god knows what we have Nina
[1:45:39] and we want to want to be something to
[1:45:41] wear it maybe a visitor or somebody
[1:45:43] could come in here not just a visitor
