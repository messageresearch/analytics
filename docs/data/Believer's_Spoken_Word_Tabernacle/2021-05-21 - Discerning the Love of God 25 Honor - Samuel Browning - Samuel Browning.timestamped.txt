[38:35] this is
[38:36] paul is dealing with with
[38:39] what real charity is and we know that
[38:43] as the scripture lets us know this is
[38:46] not
[38:47] this is not apart from god but this
[38:50] charity
[38:51] this we're speaking of this is god
[38:54] this is god's own life it's god's own
[38:57] expression
[38:58] and look how paul would place this here
[39:00] he says though i speak with the tongues
[39:03] of men and of angels and have not
[39:06] charity
[39:07] and become a sounding brass or a
[39:10] tingling symbol
[39:12] though i have the gift of prophecy and
[39:14] understand all mysteries
[39:17] and all knowledge though i have all
[39:19] faith so that i could remove
[39:20] mountains and have not charity i'm
[39:23] nothing
[39:25] though i bestow all my goods to feed the
[39:27] poor and though
[39:28] i give my body to be burned and have not
[39:31] charity
[39:32] it profiteth me nothing what paul's
[39:35] dealing with here
[39:37] there's got to be a real substance
[39:41] behind it all if there's not the real
[39:44] substance of love of
[39:46] everything even when you look at that
[39:48] very last verse of all of the
[39:50] great sacrifices that could be made yet
[39:54] if it is not charity that's abiding
[39:58] there
[39:58] motivating that life then all the
[40:01] sacrifices
[40:02] all of the great things mean nothing
[40:06] amen verse 4
[40:10] charity suffereth law is kind
[40:13] it envieth not and it vaunteth not
[40:16] itself
[40:18] and it's not puffed up it does not
[40:21] behave itself
[40:23] unseemly and that's where i'm going to
[40:25] stop here for tonight may god bless you
[40:27] bless the reading of his word
[40:28] as you're being seated
[40:32] you know there's times when we
[40:36] look here in the word of god and you we
[40:38] can read over
[40:40] these parts here as we god has just been
[40:43] taking us through this
[40:45] and so many times we can we can read
[40:48] over
[40:49] the word of god and
[40:52] yet when god begins to move
[40:56] through his word and begins to really
[40:58] bring discernment to our hearts and our
[41:00] lives
[41:02] this is a time that we really find a
[41:04] real reflection
[41:06] we find in our hearts that sometimes
[41:08] there's things that can be
[41:10] shown up in his presence that maybe at
[41:13] any other time there's things that we
[41:15] would just
[41:16] kind of go on past us i'd say that here
[41:19] tonight that anyone who's been serving
[41:21] the lord for any
[41:22] length of time at all that you find that
[41:25] the longer that you serve the lord
[41:27] you find how that there's times you're
[41:29] able to look back in your life
[41:31] and there's things that you didn't see
[41:33] back there
[41:35] but god knew they were there i'm not
[41:37] talking about
[41:38] sin of something hidden about running
[41:40] around the world i'm talking about
[41:43] things that were still there within our
[41:45] life of
[41:46] pride and everything else and it doesn't
[41:49] mean that all of a sudden once we
[41:50] begin to see all this and see that it
[41:53] doesn't mean that
[41:54] seeing it that it's always all gone it
[41:56] just is god's grace to you and i
[41:58] to realize that it's god letting us see
[42:01] that
[42:02] because he wants to operate more freely
[42:06] and more fully in our life and so it's
[42:09] remember everything how god reflects his
[42:12] life
[42:12] he doesn't do it by force in our life
[42:15] god does it by submission
[42:17] it's things to where god moves by his
[42:19] presence and
[42:20] that we would recognize his presence and
[42:22] then yielding our lives to him and
[42:25] obeying his word and simply believing
[42:29] because before you can obey it
[42:30] you first must believe it and obeying is
[42:33] a reflection of
[42:34] believing it which all comes back to a
[42:37] reflection of
[42:38] recognizing him and these are things
[42:41] that you can look back
[42:43] you know we can look in our life and i
[42:44] thank god for these moments
[42:46] because within it we can see then
[42:50] as we then look even at others and with
[42:53] uh among situations and our prayer
[42:56] becomes a little different
[42:58] we've been we begin to pray in a manner
[43:01] of
[43:01] understanding we begin to pray in a
[43:04] manner of where
[43:05] it's reaching out and say god just as
[43:08] you were
[43:09] merciful to me just as lord that there
[43:12] were things that
[43:13] that that i can look back on and say my
[43:16] i see this here god you're the same god
[43:19] for me
[43:20] you're the same god for my brother same
[43:23] god for my sister you're the same god
[43:25] and it
[43:26] it brings about a place you know to
[43:28] where
[43:29] god lets us know it's not a moment of
[43:32] getting down on ourselves
[43:33] but it's a moment of god's grace and
[43:36] reflection
[43:37] so that you and i can be able to yield
[43:40] more to him
[43:40] that more of his life can be reflected
[43:43] in our own lives
[43:45] and many times in the scripture you'll
[43:47] find things that
[43:48] you know brother branham will take
[43:50] things when he's writing
[43:53] like in the church ages and he's dealing
[43:55] with uh
[43:56] the part there out of the tyrann age and
[43:59] he's
[44:00] speaking of how it's worded there in the
[44:01] scripture uh
[44:03] thou hast not known the depths of satan
[44:05] and brother branson says
[44:06] theologians have just they said
[44:09] exhausted themselves
[44:11] trying to figure this out but he says
[44:14] they're silent on it he said but it's
[44:16] really quite simple if you just
[44:19] take the opposite from what the depths
[44:22] of satan is
[44:23] and begin to look at the depths of god
[44:26] once you see the depths of god
[44:28] which is this clear over here then
[44:31] you'll know the opposite of that
[44:33] is the depths of satan so many things
[44:35] that we can see that within it
[44:38] that there are times like in this verse
[44:40] that it does not
[44:42] behave itself unseemly so these are
[44:45] things we went from
[44:47] the very first verse here in verse 4
[44:49] where it
[44:50] has its dealing with what is here
[44:52] inwardly
[44:53] but now how paul would write even in its
[44:56] display
[44:57] or the expression of this and i i tell
[45:00] you
[45:01] when we see this of of behavior it
[45:04] does not behave itself unseemly or
[45:07] meaning
[45:07] rudely or unbecomingly and i want to go
[45:11] back into a scripture here tonight in
[45:13] psalms 105
[45:14] and as we're we're we're going to that
[45:16] scripture there
[45:18] just to think of this expression within
[45:21] our life
[45:21] and to see how that god himself
[45:25] god values that of honor that of
[45:28] reverence to where god would write in
[45:30] his word
[45:31] that he would speak to you and i not
[45:33] just to honor
[45:34] have honor among ourselves but to honor
[45:37] all men
[45:38] now god was never ever ever putting it
[45:41] out there that we're to honor
[45:42] sin or to honor wickedness but god did
[45:45] say
[45:46] honor men is that right honor the king
[45:50] whether you agree with him or not is
[45:51] that right it's it speaks of the
[45:54] honoring we can bring it on down honor
[45:56] your boss
[45:57] whether you agree with him or not it
[45:59] goes on and on
[46:00] through the scripture god loves and he
[46:03] delights
[46:04] in honor
[46:08] and in order to honor in order to honor
[46:12] it requires humility
[46:17] it's easy to be humble because you don't
[46:19] have to be when everybody agrees with
[46:21] you
[46:21] [Laughter]
[46:22] but it's when somebody doesn't agree
[46:25] with it
[46:26] or it's when somebody doesn't do
[46:28] something to you that's
[46:30] seemingly good but now how is
[46:34] now how is the behavior going to be
[46:36] translated i want to remind you of this
[46:38] very thing sometimes that we look at
[46:40] and i look at things here within the
[46:42] message and i know i'm not odd
[46:44] but i realize with this when i thank god
[46:47] brother ram will take in christ the
[46:48] mystery
[46:49] and i and i look at this how brother
[46:51] brown will take almost
[46:53] 35 40 some minutes here and he'll
[46:56] deal with even the behavior among the
[46:59] church of the living god
[47:01] he'll take time and deal with that then
[47:03] he speaks of the future home
[47:05] in 1964 he'll take the first part of
[47:08] that message
[47:09] not five minutes not ten minutes but a
[47:12] good
[47:13] chunk of it at the beginning and he'll
[47:15] speak of the character
[47:17] that's on display at the blue board at
[47:20] the motels
[47:21] at every place else and he'll speak of
[47:23] that character
[47:24] and that life that's on display just
[47:27] simply put in this manner
[47:29] this world is not our home
[47:33] we are delegates of that
[47:37] heavenly jerusalem
[47:40] we are not we are not of this world
[47:43] we're not to be
[47:44] caught up with this world we're not to
[47:46] act like this world
[47:48] but we are to reflect that
[47:51] world of our new birth that
[47:54] city where we're going
[47:58] hallelujah we've received the life of
[48:01] that land
[48:02] into us or we've been accepted into him
[48:06] there's a molding and a shaping in this
[48:09] life
[48:10] that makes us ready for that over there
[48:13] many of you right now are going about
[48:15] and you're getting your plants maybe or
[48:17] your tomato plants or
[48:18] or whatever you're doing there's
[48:20] probably not anybody here that's grown
[48:22] them from a seedling
[48:23] but you're gonna go to the store maybe
[48:25] you'll get your petunias or your
[48:26] or maybe you'll get your rose bush that
[48:29] you're wanting or
[48:30] or your hydrania but when you go get it
[48:33] you're going to have to bring it home
[48:35] you're not going to be able to live and
[48:36] leave it in that pot
[48:38] you're going to have to transplant it
[48:41] from
[48:41] that pot into a place in your flower bed
[48:45] or
[48:45] your garden or wherever more and that's
[48:48] exactly what the rapture is all about
[48:51] it's transplanting taking the character
[48:54] that has been molded and shaped in our
[48:57] life
[48:58] and then placed there in that other body
[49:01] that's exactly
[49:02] how brother brahms said in the future
[49:04] home he said the rapture
[49:05] it's a transplanting it's taking the
[49:08] character
[49:09] that's been reflected and molded and
[49:12] shaped and brother braham tells us
[49:14] we are molded and shaped until we're
[49:17] ready
[49:17] to go into that god knows what he's
[49:21] doing
[49:22] and all of this throughout when we
[49:24] consider this with
[49:26] with honor and how that as as we look at
[49:29] this
[49:30] in psalms 105 let me just get to it in
[49:33] psalms 105 verse 8
[49:35] here david is esprit is expressing
[49:39] of how that they should glory the god
[49:42] of israel how they should sing glory to
[49:44] him and he said
[49:46] he hath remembered his covenant forever
[49:49] aren't you glad god remembers his word
[49:51] yes sir
[49:52] amen and he loves it when you remind him
[49:55] of his word
[49:56] that shows you believe it god
[50:00] loves it when you put his word right
[50:02] before god this is what you said in your
[50:04] word
[50:04] god this is what you promised he
[50:06] remembers his covenant and
[50:08] oh it thrills his heart when his
[50:11] children
[50:12] remember it and bring it back to him
[50:15] the word which he commanded to a
[50:17] thousand generations
[50:19] which covenant he made with abraham and
[50:21] his oath unto isaac
[50:23] and confirmed the same unto jacob for a
[50:26] law
[50:26] and to israel for an everlasting
[50:28] covenant
[50:29] saying unto thee will i give the land of
[50:32] canaan the lot of your inheritance
[50:34] when they were but a few men in number
[50:38] yea very few and strangers in it now
[50:41] here david is going back under
[50:43] inspiration when you we're just looking
[50:45] at abraham
[50:46] or we're looking at jacob he's not even
[50:49] altogether talking about the multitude
[50:52] that came out of egypt or those who of
[50:56] israel were in that multitude even
[50:58] though
[50:59] that they themselves were not even
[51:01] though it was a large group of people
[51:03] but it was not in comparison to a lot of
[51:05] other nations
[51:07] are you with me but notice here
[51:10] when they were but a few men in number
[51:12] ye very few
[51:14] and strangers in it when they went from
[51:17] one nation to another
[51:19] from one kingdom to another people he
[51:21] suffered
[51:22] no man to do them wrong yea
[51:26] he reproved kings for their saints
[51:29] saying touch not mine anointed and do my
[51:32] prophets
[51:33] no harm let me just say this to you when
[51:36] god
[51:37] as david is declaring this here
[51:40] remember as they would come through
[51:42] abraham here is
[51:43] abraham moving through the land here is
[51:46] jacob
[51:47] god their god has a word that's to be
[51:50] fulfilled
[51:51] let me say it like this as they even
[51:53] came out of israel
[51:55] what they were under was the anointing
[51:57] of the word
[51:58] in that hour they weren't following
[52:01] their own leadings
[52:02] and it wasn't that god said well these
[52:05] are my people and they're just
[52:06] off doing their own things and and oh
[52:08] somebody came against them and god said
[52:10] oh no you can't come against my
[52:11] children. that's not it at all
[52:13] they were under the word they were under
[52:16] the pillar of fire they were under the
[52:18] leadership
[52:19] of the holy spirit their identification
[52:23] was not their own they were identified
[52:26] by his presence when amalek came against
[52:31] him
[52:31] he was coming against god
[52:35] when edom came against him they were
[52:38] coming
[52:39] against god when pharaoh came against
[52:42] him
[52:42] he was coming against god god didn't
[52:45] look at it like you're picking on my
[52:47] kids
[52:48] god took it personal you're coming
[52:50] against me
[52:53] you know what that means when we stand
[52:55] there on god's word
[52:57] and believe god's word we're standing
[53:00] under that word
[53:01] submitting our lives where doubt is
[53:03] confessed
[53:04] unbelief is confessed sin has confessed
[53:07] let me tell you something
[53:08] it's not the enemy coming after you he's
[53:11] disrespecting the god
[53:13] that's anointing your life and then god
[53:16] takes
[53:17] that person
[53:20] that's not my anointed and do my
[53:23] prophets no harm
[53:27] god takes it personal this is why listen
[53:30] to me now
[53:31] this is why god values honor
[53:35] god values honor and how things and i
[53:37] can't get it tonight
[53:39] but even how things of authority will
[53:41] flow
[53:42] and follow god values that
[53:45] and god even in the valuing of this here
[53:48] under his word where there's a people
[53:50] that are marching
[53:52] under the word of the lord this is not
[53:54] their own anointing
[53:56] this is not their own imagination let me
[53:58] say this to you
[53:59] you're not here by your own imagination
[54:02] you're not here by your own devices
[54:04] you sign say there's a lot of things i
[54:06] don't understand but there's one thing
[54:08] about it
[54:09] you know god and you know god and his
[54:11] mercy
[54:12] of how god has dealt with your life
[54:14] where god has brought you to
[54:16] and you're walking in reverence in
[54:18] submission
[54:19] to god
[54:23] the difference between israel and all
[54:26] other nations
[54:28] was god you take god away from israel
[54:32] they're like all the rest of them you
[54:35] take god away from the church
[54:36] just like all the rest of them it's god
[54:39] that makes a difference
[54:41] there's one thing that makes a
[54:42] difference about your life and my life
[54:45] god you take god away from us we're just
[54:48] like any other mortal
[54:49] that's why we face some of the same
[54:51] problems we face some of the same
[54:53] challenges come on now
[54:55] we face some of the same sicknesses and
[54:57] through
[54:58] all of those things there's one thing
[55:00] that makes the difference
[55:01] god
[55:04] it's god hallelujah
[55:08] you see this is why when moses would
[55:10] write it like this
[55:12] moses as remember when here
[55:15] moses is is uh communing with the lord
[55:19] after everything and some things had
[55:21] taken place there in the wilderness
[55:23] and he's and he's asking the lord
[55:25] remember
[55:26] the request was to see him
[55:29] was to know who is it that you're going
[55:31] you said you would sin with
[55:32] us and remember then how that hear
[55:36] god speaking to moses
[55:39] and moses i'd want to just cut in on
[55:42] this where moses says
[55:44] if thy presence in verse 15 go not with
[55:48] me
[55:48] carry us not offense for wherein shall
[55:52] it be known here that i
[55:53] and thy people have found grace in thy
[55:56] sight
[55:57] is it not in that thou goest with
[56:00] us so shall we be separated i
[56:03] and thy people from all the people that
[56:06] are upon the face
[56:07] of the earth it's his presence
[56:11] that makes a difference
[56:14] hallelujah this is what the baptism of
[56:17] the holy ghost does
[56:18] it brings god's presence personal in
[56:21] your life
[56:23] amen it brings it personal
[56:27] in our lives no i'm with thee always
[56:31] you see in here in in the message
[56:34] respects
[56:36] brother adamus is speaking of things
[56:38] that and he's
[56:40] speaking to the tabernacle there and the
[56:42] peoples they're gathering
[56:44] of all the events that they are seeing
[56:47] taking place
[56:48] and he's admonishing the people there
[56:52] that in everything that we see going on
[56:55] that we give respects to it
[56:59] i can't get into a lot of other things
[57:01] here tonight but even in things where
[57:03] brethren says
[57:04] when i seen the holy spirit sometimes he
[57:06] said i've seen it
[57:07] he said a genuine anointing but
[57:09] sometimes people would get in the flesh
[57:11] he said but don't say nothing against
[57:12] that
[57:15] is that right and he takes us into this
[57:19] scripture here because
[57:21] as we're talking about behavior we're
[57:24] talking about
[57:24] honor we're talking about honor
[57:28] he takes us into the scripture in
[57:30] ecclesiastes 12
[57:31] 13 and i'm just quoting from this from
[57:34] the quote
[57:35] let us hear the conclusion of the whole
[57:37] matter fear god
[57:39] and keep his commandments for this is
[57:41] the full duty of god
[57:42] and brother graham takes it up like this
[57:44] he says see the conclusion of the whole
[57:46] matter
[57:47] is to fear god
[57:50] you cannot have respects until you have
[57:54] fear you've got to have
[57:57] fear of god we're living in a time
[58:00] it's been going on but we're living in
[58:03] an
[58:03] hour where there's no fear of god we're
[58:08] living in a time and brother and sister
[58:09] i'm just bringing this very
[58:11] very down here we're living in a time
[58:13] where it's not just out there
[58:15] those are spirits people don't even
[58:17] recognize it
[58:18] it's spirits that's behind them this is
[58:21] why you and i we must
[58:22] have the discernment of the holy spirit
[58:25] in our lives
[58:27] to be able to recognize when we look at
[58:29] one another
[58:30] we're not just looking at flesh and
[58:32] blood we are looking at a son or
[58:34] daughter of god
[58:37] hallelujah and you might say well you
[58:40] know god showed me that this one in the
[58:42] son or that one's a daughter
[58:43] i doubt that i doubt that very much
[58:47] because the devil don't even know that i
[58:50] know who that's for but it's free
[58:52] packaged on it with a ribbon
[58:55] and let me just say this to you that god
[58:58] did not even have that pointed out with
[59:00] judas
[59:03] none of the rest of the disciples knew
[59:05] about that
[59:08] and even though jesus knew of that
[59:12] he never behaved himself unseemly
[59:15] to judas are you with me it wasn't
[59:19] anything that
[59:20] could give it away
[59:24] hallelujah that's exactly
[59:27] help us lord jesus
[59:28] [Laughter]
[59:30] help us lord
[59:33] amen oh glory be to god i'm just trying
[59:37] to stay on this here
[59:38] be good you cannot have respects until
[59:41] you have fear
[59:42] you've got to have fear of god the fear
[59:44] of god is the beginning
[59:46] of wisdom now he said that don't mean
[59:48] you're afraid of him
[59:49] but that means that you are giving him
[59:52] respects
[59:53] and reverence and when you respect
[59:56] god you fear god remember the big
[59:59] difference this is not a slavish fear
[1:00:02] this is a reverence to him
[1:00:05] it's respecting him he says you
[1:00:08] fear that you might displease him in
[1:00:11] some way
[1:00:12] you fear lest you would do something
[1:00:14] wrong you wouldn't
[1:00:16] want to
[1:00:19] brother brahma says it like this i fear
[1:00:21] my mother now some of you his kids might
[1:00:23] just say hey that's exactly right
[1:00:25] it means something about respecting her
[1:00:27] not talking about how big of a switch
[1:00:29] she's got
[1:00:30] i fear my mother i fear my wife
[1:00:34] i fear my church i fear all of god's
[1:00:37] servants
[1:00:38] unless i should put a stumbling block
[1:00:41] somewhere
[1:00:42] in their way i fear the people i fear
[1:00:45] the people of the city
[1:00:46] unless i should do something wrong that
[1:00:49] would cause them to
[1:00:50] think that i wasn't a christian
[1:00:55] this is real honor charity does not
[1:00:58] behave itself unseemly
[1:01:02] it operates with a real reverence and
[1:01:04] fear
[1:01:05] because remember the scripture says if
[1:01:08] you cannot
[1:01:09] love them you seek how can you say you
[1:01:12] love god whom you've never seen
[1:01:15] and love itself love is a product
[1:01:19] of respect love brings
[1:01:22] respect is that right it brings fear
[1:01:26] it brings a reverence it brings things
[1:01:28] where it needs to be
[1:01:29] now notice this is as he goes on to say
[1:01:32] before you can have respect
[1:01:34] you've got to have fear god demands it
[1:01:37] god demands respect god does it he
[1:01:39] demands it
[1:01:40] and fear brings it now let's go in here
[1:01:43] to the scripture here just for a moment
[1:01:45] in revel in romans 12 verse 9.
[1:01:48] and i read this i read this to you
[1:01:50] starting out the last time but i want to
[1:01:52] set this
[1:01:53] just a little bit of a course here
[1:01:54] tonight let
[1:01:56] love be without dissimilation
[1:02:01] that means without hypocrisy we could
[1:02:03] say amen
[1:02:06] but this is where it has to be an amen
[1:02:08] when you don't
[1:02:09] feel loving when somebody's maybe
[1:02:13] wronged you or said something about you
[1:02:15] and you say oh i just brush it all off
[1:02:18] you're lying
[1:02:20] every one of us have a part about us
[1:02:23] nobody likes to have things said about
[1:02:26] you wrong
[1:02:27] thought about you wrong nobody likes
[1:02:29] that nobody said
[1:02:30] oh i'm just oozing out even with
[1:02:32] yourself being built up
[1:02:34] in the love of god it's where you have
[1:02:36] to lean
[1:02:37] on the inside man because there's two
[1:02:40] parts of you
[1:02:41] that has not been changed
[1:02:46] hallelujah this is why we have to draw
[1:02:48] from an inside man
[1:02:50] above all things put on sink into
[1:02:53] charity
[1:02:55] let love be without dissimilation now
[1:02:59] this this very part right here it might
[1:03:01] mean it's going to take
[1:03:02] some real time of prayer
[1:03:06] god i don't feel the way that i need to
[1:03:09] see god will work with people who's
[1:03:10] honest
[1:03:12] god don't mess around with people who
[1:03:14] are hypocrites oh i just
[1:03:16] love everybody but if there's things
[1:03:18] that's there just be honest
[1:03:20] god will come and help you he'll help
[1:03:22] you to move through that
[1:03:23] you're able to pray through that until
[1:03:25] you get the feeling the right way
[1:03:27] that don't make you not a christian that
[1:03:29] means you're standing there as a son of
[1:03:31] god
[1:03:32] and you're laying claim to the ground
[1:03:34] the body which is not your inheritance
[1:03:36] but your possession and i will not allow
[1:03:39] sin
[1:03:40] to reign in my mortal body i
[1:03:44] will not allow it to reign there
[1:03:47] that same word that uh brother jim used
[1:03:51] here last week kingdom
[1:03:52] basilio is the same word i just quoted
[1:03:55] let not therefore sin
[1:03:56] be healed kingdom reign in your mortal
[1:03:59] body
[1:04:01] we're of a different kingdom
[1:04:04] let love be without dissimilation look
[1:04:07] out look how he goes on to say this
[1:04:08] abor that which is evil
[1:04:13] wow i mean this didn't didn't it
[1:04:15] automatic switch
[1:04:18] y'all quiet
[1:04:22] please to that which is good these are
[1:04:24] things
[1:04:25] that will be done by a believer
[1:04:29] even when it comes to that of evil abhor
[1:04:32] it
[1:04:32] shun it turn away from it
[1:04:37] once again it's things sometimes that we
[1:04:40] have pictures painted out here
[1:04:42] and when god begins to show the evil we
[1:04:44] say oh
[1:04:45] that was evil oh lord you meant that was
[1:04:48] evil
[1:04:49] and god said yeah but you was thinking
[1:04:51] it was all right come on now
[1:04:56] but cleave to that which is good there's
[1:04:59] only one i know that's good and that's
[1:05:00] him
[1:05:02] be kindly affection one to another with
[1:05:05] brotherly love
[1:05:06] in honor preferring one another notice
[1:05:10] in honor preferring one another
[1:05:13] this this whole word on earth it deals
[1:05:16] with
[1:05:17] a deference which is a humble submission
[1:05:21] and a respect a reverence which is
[1:05:25] a deep respect for someone or something
[1:05:28] a regard to treat
[1:05:29] with deep respect
[1:05:32] i'm going to be honest with you those
[1:05:35] are things sometimes
[1:05:36] it's very challenging and you can say
[1:05:39] man if you want her i'll just say man
[1:05:40] for all of you
[1:05:41] it's challenging sometimes you
[1:05:43] understand it's little foxes that spoil
[1:05:46] the vine
[1:05:47] it is we're living in the hour of the
[1:05:49] manifestations of the son of god but we
[1:05:52] cannot be ignorant
[1:05:53] about the enemy and thinking god's just
[1:05:55] going to override it
[1:05:56] this is our responsibility the headstone
[1:06:00] above us
[1:06:01] his life reflecting down into our life
[1:06:03] it's in
[1:06:04] our hands that our lives stay as
[1:06:07] channels
[1:06:08] that are clear that he can operate
[1:06:10] through
[1:06:12] always remember one thing that my daddy
[1:06:14] told me he said
[1:06:15] son is when i first started even first
[1:06:17] started preaching and he said
[1:06:19] sonny said always live in this way he
[1:06:21] said take like a garden hose
[1:06:23] he said sometimes he said you know how
[1:06:25] what's happened he said is where it's
[1:06:26] hard to get that water out
[1:06:28] i said yeah i remember when there was
[1:06:30] kinks especially a lot of them old hoses
[1:06:32] we had man i mean you know
[1:06:33] you had something to be on 20 foot
[1:06:35] you're going to have kinks in those
[1:06:36] hoses
[1:06:37] and you'd wonder why isn't the water
[1:06:38] coming out the water's on
[1:06:40] he said son live your life so there's no
[1:06:43] kinks in the hose
[1:06:44] he said because it won't be anything
[1:06:46] wrong with the water supply
[1:06:48] there ain't nothing wrong with the
[1:06:49] nozzle on it it will be the kinks that
[1:06:52] you
[1:06:52] allow in the hose
[1:06:56] are you with me this is why the channels
[1:06:59] in our life
[1:07:00] that god directs you and i we are to be
[1:07:03] the branches
[1:07:04] he's divine nothing wrong with the vine
[1:07:06] the light is just as
[1:07:07] powerful in the vine but now how we need
[1:07:11] the grace of god
[1:07:12] in such a measure so that the life of
[1:07:15] the vine
[1:07:16] might pulsate through the branches
[1:07:20] is that right god never put the prophet
[1:07:22] on autopilot
[1:07:23] not at all he put things before him
[1:07:27] how are you going to handle this
[1:07:28] remember there's a great track test
[1:07:30] there's a great trial god didn't tell
[1:07:32] him what the test or the trial was
[1:07:33] coming up
[1:07:35] is that right but god let him know
[1:07:37] there's a test there's a trial that's
[1:07:39] coming
[1:07:39] it behoove of how that brother brown
[1:07:42] would conduct himself
[1:07:43] in many of those situations
[1:07:49] my goodness
[1:07:53] sometimes i think we're thinking glory
[1:07:55] to god i tell you what lord pack me away
[1:07:58] it's time it's time to go in the rapture
[1:08:00] but we've got a responsibility
[1:08:02] if we can't reign as sons and daughters
[1:08:05] of god here
[1:08:06] how are we going to do it over there but
[1:08:08] there's got to be the character
[1:08:10] it's not just power there's no problem
[1:08:13] with the power
[1:08:14] it's character that goes with it
[1:08:20] reverence and deference and i believe
[1:08:22] that's what we that's what we desire
[1:08:24] in our hearts that's why we're here
[1:08:26] tonight
[1:08:27] is that right you see this is where
[1:08:31] as we see this in brother branham as he
[1:08:35] would
[1:08:35] write of this and speak of this and
[1:08:37] preferring one another
[1:08:39] always prefer one another he said that's
[1:08:42] the life
[1:08:43] of christ to prefer your brother or your
[1:08:47] sister
[1:08:48] and that prefer in honor in respect
[1:08:52] not only what's deep seated but also
[1:08:56] a respect that's expressed
[1:09:00] so that's the life of christ to prefer
[1:09:03] your brother sister prefer means
[1:09:06] they're before you they're above you
[1:09:11] this is what this is what it's speaking
[1:09:13] of matter of fact let me pick up that
[1:09:15] scripture philippians 2 3 and then i'll
[1:09:17] move on
[1:09:18] let nothing be done through strife or
[1:09:20] vainglory that's us putting ourselves
[1:09:22] forward
[1:09:24] but in loneliness of mind
[1:09:29] let each esteem other better than
[1:09:32] themselves
[1:09:34] better than esteem prefer
[1:09:38] this means to think better
[1:09:41] say god help us yes help us lord jesus
[1:09:48] if they were wrong brother brown says if
[1:09:50] they're wrong
[1:09:51] that's all right you'll never make them
[1:09:54] any better by kicking them around
[1:09:56] put an arm around them and pick them up
[1:10:03] i referred this made a comment
[1:10:07] sometimes when we're looking at honor
[1:10:11] sometimes there's things that we look at
[1:10:13] where honor is due
[1:10:15] or sometimes where it's very easy it's
[1:10:17] very easy for honor to be given respect
[1:10:21] sometimes it's very it can be
[1:10:24] challenging sometimes it's our just
[1:10:27] just our thinking about things could be
[1:10:30] very challenging
[1:10:31] our thoughts about what we see somebody
[1:10:33] doing or why they're not doing this
[1:10:34] let me give an example brother brown
[1:10:37] used
[1:10:38] brother brown made a statement where
[1:10:40] evidently there were
[1:10:41] after there were things that got set
[1:10:43] into the tabernacle one man
[1:10:45] wrote and said my you've got such a
[1:10:48] ministry
[1:10:49] like the ministry of elijah and here you
[1:10:52] are
[1:10:52] taking weeks off and going and setting
[1:10:55] next to a stream
[1:10:57] you should be ashamed of yourself
[1:11:00] so brother billy paul said daddy can i
[1:11:02] write him back no this isn't
[1:11:04] the message so he writes him back he
[1:11:06] said sir he said brother
[1:11:08] he said i want you to remember he says
[1:11:10] you said that his ministry compared to
[1:11:12] that of elijah
[1:11:13] he said i remind you that elijah set by
[1:11:16] a stream for
[1:11:17] a great period of time and brother brahm
[1:11:21] is dealing with dealing with situations
[1:11:23] of things that sometimes
[1:11:24] how things in our mind the way that we
[1:11:28] think sometimes that we can get our
[1:11:31] thoughts about something to where
[1:11:33] we're actually judging what somebody
[1:11:35] else is doing or they're
[1:11:36] not doing and immediately that sets in a
[1:11:39] place that
[1:11:40] we in our minds no longer lowly
[1:11:43] but we've set ourselves up in a place to
[1:11:46] they should be doing this
[1:11:47] they should be doing that or they should
[1:11:48] be right
[1:11:50] but the brand brings it on down he says
[1:11:52] but we are led by the spirit of god
[1:11:59] somehow that fits in there there's a lot
[1:12:02] more
[1:12:02] there's a lot more to say within that as
[1:12:04] it falls that many times
[1:12:06] this is where at times things comes in
[1:12:08] as our thoughts
[1:12:09] our thinking about things and i think if
[1:12:13] we can just
[1:12:14] recognize it that way that it's simply
[1:12:16] our thoughts are our thoughts
[1:12:18] and they're always subject and under
[1:12:21] the lord god what do you say lord
[1:12:28] look at this because there's sometimes
[1:12:31] in situations of things that we
[1:12:33] we can come in contact with where
[1:12:37] it's not easy for honor to be given
[1:12:41] and those are things even our brother
[1:12:42] branham would address us on that he says
[1:12:44] you respect you
[1:12:45] he would speak of how you respect the
[1:12:46] office
[1:12:48] that the person would hold you know
[1:12:51] sometimes maybe your boss
[1:12:52] you you can't respect the man but you
[1:12:54] respect the office
[1:12:56] i mean the guy might be a womanizer and
[1:12:58] everything else he might be a drunka
[1:13:00] you know an abuser and everything else
[1:13:02] your respect is not
[1:13:04] for his actions not his wickedness
[1:13:07] it's the office his wickedness does not
[1:13:10] give a license to dishonor him
[1:13:14] are you with me that's for another time
[1:13:17] but let me just stay with this here
[1:13:19] these are things that's very very
[1:13:20] important now
[1:13:22] brother brandon would talk about with
[1:13:23] reverence he speaks of how david he said
[1:13:26] notice
[1:13:26] david said the lord is always before me
[1:13:29] reverence
[1:13:30] we ought to honor one another respect
[1:13:32] one another's brother
[1:13:34] and sister that's a good sign of
[1:13:37] christianity
[1:13:39] from your heart love those who do not
[1:13:41] love you
[1:13:43] love the unlovable jesus said if you do
[1:13:46] favors for those who do
[1:13:47] favors for you well the repub the public
[1:13:49] not republicans
[1:13:51] the publicans do the same thing you must
[1:13:53] be kind to those who are unkind to you
[1:13:56] do good for those who would do evil to
[1:13:59] you
[1:14:01] you believe these are just good words
[1:14:07] yeah these are good words but when you
[1:14:10] got to live them it's
[1:14:11] it's like coming back up you swallow it
[1:14:13] back down
[1:14:15] oh it's wonderful in the mouth but it
[1:14:17] gets down here
[1:14:20] oh because why there's a life
[1:14:23] is pushing out it's a molding of a
[1:14:26] character as we're eating the book
[1:14:28] we're taking of that life it's molding
[1:14:31] there's a power that comes with that
[1:14:33] word as we're
[1:14:35] taking that word in we find our
[1:14:37] character
[1:14:38] being molded and shaped you don't always
[1:14:40] see it right away but a test or a trial
[1:14:42] comes up in your
[1:14:43] and then god will allow it to come up to
[1:14:46] show you
[1:14:47] you're not the same there's molding
[1:14:50] that's taking place in your life
[1:14:52] you're being changed from glory unto
[1:14:54] glory unto glory
[1:15:00] just let me just move to this point here
[1:15:02] tonight and and
[1:15:03] i want to just come to this place with
[1:15:08] this
[1:15:10] you look at david and this for some
[1:15:12] years and times it's just all
[1:15:14] this this whole part is spoke on at
[1:15:16] different times with david and saul and
[1:15:19] things but it's just been something
[1:15:20] so it means so personal to me i can see
[1:15:24] so many things within this this part of
[1:15:26] it to where
[1:15:27] we know the types of saul coming in and
[1:15:30] saw being the people's choice and
[1:15:33] saul being a type of where that
[1:15:35] organizational spirit
[1:15:36] entered in and they wanted to be like
[1:15:38] the world
[1:15:39] but then we find in a place to where now
[1:15:43] when god has come to a place where he's
[1:15:45] rejected
[1:15:46] saul spewed him out he's rejected him
[1:15:50] now it comes to a place that god said
[1:15:52] i've got one that i've
[1:15:53] i chose one to myself
[1:15:57] and he led samuel to that place and we
[1:15:59] know that
[1:16:00] he directed samuel with the anointing
[1:16:03] oil with the word of promise
[1:16:06] to anoint david under the sacrifice
[1:16:11] and here is it's a secret coming and
[1:16:14] here
[1:16:14] here we find this of here's david he's
[1:16:18] anointed king
[1:16:19] in israel there's so many parts you
[1:16:21] could preach every
[1:16:22] attribute of first corinthians 13
[1:16:26] in david's life right here david doesn't
[1:16:28] run away from that meeting
[1:16:30] and say i've been anointed
[1:16:35] no what was done in secret he will
[1:16:37] reveal
[1:16:38] openly so here's a working
[1:16:42] that's taking place in david's life
[1:16:46] and the scripture would say it like this
[1:16:48] i i may not read all of this scripture
[1:16:50] i'm just going to refer to them tonight
[1:16:52] but it would speak of how that david
[1:16:54] himself
[1:16:55] here after he's anointed he comes there
[1:16:59] and you know there's a defeat there of
[1:17:02] goliath
[1:17:02] and after that there are very important
[1:17:06] words
[1:17:06] that we find throughout the scriptures
[1:17:09] it speaks in first samuel 18
[1:17:11] 5 that david went wet went out whither
[1:17:14] so ever
[1:17:15] saul sent him and behaved himself
[1:17:19] wisely david never said i don't have to
[1:17:22] do what you're telling me
[1:17:24] because i've been anointed king.
[1:17:28] he showed there was a reflection
[1:17:32] of the throne being reflected
[1:17:36] in his behavior are you with me
[1:17:40] he was being reflected he behaved
[1:17:42] himself as a wise virgin
[1:17:44] wisely one was filled with oil
[1:17:51] think about this things were told
[1:17:54] and saul got angry so got angry that
[1:17:58] sauce killed thousands david's is ten
[1:18:00] thousand saul got upset
[1:18:02] jealousy
[1:18:06] he's jealous we can go on and on an evil
[1:18:10] spirit comes upon saul
[1:18:12] think about this david has been playing
[1:18:15] for saul
[1:18:17] he's been playing the harp to do what
[1:18:20] to drive away that evil spirit to change
[1:18:24] to try to change that atmosphere that's
[1:18:26] around there
[1:18:27] but twice the bible says saul picked up
[1:18:30] the
[1:18:31] javelin and threw it at it once would
[1:18:34] have probably been enough for me
[1:18:39] because saul was a sharpshooter
[1:18:42] are you with me but twice the bible says
[1:18:46] if you refer to it first samuel 18 11 he
[1:18:48] threw it at it there was two different
[1:18:50] times
[1:18:52] look what david's doing david is
[1:18:54] continuing
[1:18:55] to present himself and honor
[1:18:59] saul why is he honoring saul
[1:19:02] because the lord hath anointed him
[1:19:09] he could have acted rudely unbecomingly
[1:19:14] he could have said why are you doing
[1:19:16] this to me see this just shows
[1:19:23] but what here's the thing what saul
[1:19:26] begins to go through and say verse 12
[1:19:31] saul was afraid of david because the
[1:19:34] lord
[1:19:34] was with him and was departed from saul
[1:19:39] saul could see god
[1:19:42] was with david it wasn't just in
[1:19:46] killing goliath but many some of the
[1:19:50] times
[1:19:50] there was goliath on the battlefield but
[1:19:52] he also had to kill the goliath that
[1:19:54] wanted to raise up in his life to get
[1:19:56] back at saul
[1:19:58] come on there's a lot of goliath that's
[1:20:00] already been removed from your life my
[1:20:02] this went drinking winter makeup winter
[1:20:04] this winter that winter this went but
[1:20:07] now it comes to a time in the morning of
[1:20:09] character you say
[1:20:09] oh god and there's no desire to be that
[1:20:12] way to have that feeling
[1:20:14] there in your life but there's a molding
[1:20:16] and a shaping that's going on
[1:20:17] what's happening he's preparing you for
[1:20:19] the throne
[1:20:22] he's preparing you to rule and reign
[1:20:25] with him
[1:20:27] even as he overcame and is sat down with
[1:20:29] his father in history
[1:20:32] the bible goes on to say verse 14 and
[1:20:35] david behaved himself wisely
[1:20:38] in all his ways and the lord was with
[1:20:40] him
[1:20:42] he keeps on saying this in verse 30
[1:20:46] david behaved himself more wisely than
[1:20:48] all the servants of saul
[1:20:49] so that his name was much
[1:20:53] set by
[1:20:58] most of you if not all of us know
[1:21:02] david he's a man
[1:21:06] that's on the run he's regarded as a
[1:21:09] fugitive
[1:21:12] saul's after him this is a man when he
[1:21:15] sets down
[1:21:16] he's got to watch his back he's got to
[1:21:19] watch the people he's talking to
[1:21:23] he's got to keep an eye out the whole
[1:21:26] time
[1:21:28] and here god arranges a situation
[1:21:33] in first samuel 24 and i'm not going to
[1:21:35] read it
[1:21:36] but saul comes to rest in a cave and
[1:21:39] he's seeking after david
[1:21:44] let me just say this to you if this
[1:21:47] events have been different i wonder if
[1:21:50] we'd read any more of david
[1:21:55] but you see listen to me now god had
[1:21:57] anointed
[1:21:58] david there's nothing
[1:22:02] listen to me now there's nothing that
[1:22:04] could keep david
[1:22:05] from getting to the throne
[1:22:09] i could really preach right here but all
[1:22:12] the molding that has to take place
[1:22:14] throughout until it's ready to rain
[1:22:19] all of that molding through there it's
[1:22:21] not going to be handed to david
[1:22:24] david's going to have to run for his
[1:22:25] life this is not a game
[1:22:27] he's running for his life he's dodging
[1:22:30] he's moving around
[1:22:31] but at the same time character is being
[1:22:34] molded
[1:22:35] what's coming out what god saw in him
[1:22:38] from the foundation of the world
[1:22:40] here's a man after my own heart put him
[1:22:43] under pressure
[1:22:45] and it'll come out
[1:22:48] hallelujah god didn't have confidence in
[1:22:50] the flesh of david
[1:22:52] it was a seed that was inside of david
[1:22:57] hallelujah and here in verse 4
[1:23:02] the men of david said to him here saul
[1:23:04] asleep
[1:23:05] behold the day of which the lord
[1:23:09] said unto thee behold i will deliver
[1:23:12] thine enemy into thy hand
[1:23:13] that thou mayest do to him as it shall
[1:23:15] seem good unto thee
[1:23:18] then david arose and cut off the skirt
[1:23:21] of saul's robe privately and it came to
[1:23:24] pass
[1:23:25] that david's heart smote him because he
[1:23:29] had cut
[1:23:29] off saul's skirt
[1:23:34] that's the kind of heart we want to have
[1:23:37] a heart that's tender
[1:23:39] brother brahm says i want to be so
[1:23:40] sensitive till i'll know
[1:23:42] the least little thing that grieves him
[1:23:48] david said unto his men the lord forbid
[1:23:51] that i should do this thing unto my
[1:23:53] master
[1:23:54] the lord's anointed to stretch forth my
[1:23:57] hand against him
[1:23:58] seeing he's the anointed of the lord you
[1:24:00] know what david's doing in this verse
[1:24:02] he's giving honor to his men
[1:24:05] because he's leading them they need
[1:24:08] leadership
[1:24:10] they need leadership they're looking at
[1:24:12] going this way or
[1:24:14] going that way they need led and god
[1:24:18] through david honors those men at that
[1:24:21] time
[1:24:21] knowing their desire is to serve him
[1:24:24] and to serve david so god provides
[1:24:27] leadership
[1:24:28] that that can continue
[1:24:31] that's honor no wonder the bible would
[1:24:35] say
[1:24:35] husbands giving honor unto the wife as
[1:24:38] unto the weaker vessel
[1:24:41] is that right so david
[1:24:45] he stayed there i i don't have time to
[1:24:47] just
[1:24:48] go with all this but david stayed his
[1:24:50] servants with these words
[1:24:53] and suffered them not to rise against
[1:24:55] saul
[1:24:57] but saul rose up out of the cave and
[1:24:58] went on his way and david also arose up
[1:25:01] afterward and went out of the cave
[1:25:03] and cried after saul saying my lord the
[1:25:06] king
[1:25:08] what honor a man that's been chasing you
[1:25:11] down
[1:25:13] a man that's tried every little way to
[1:25:15] lay traps for you here and there
[1:25:17] come on now he set this up and set that
[1:25:20] up and set this up
[1:25:22] had spies spying on you and yet the
[1:25:24] response is
[1:25:25] my lord the king david this was without
[1:25:29] the holy ghost
[1:25:30] how much more with the holy ghost
[1:25:34] hallelujah amen we're talking about a
[1:25:37] reflection of the throne
[1:25:39] david stooped with his face to the earth
[1:25:43] and bowed himself
[1:25:46] david submitted himself he goes on you
[1:25:49] know see
[1:25:50] david just speaks of it how's
[1:25:53] he shows him the skirt god the lord
[1:25:55] delivered you into my hand today
[1:25:58] but to show you i will not touch
[1:26:02] the lord's anointed you see
[1:26:05] david's honor was to the word
[1:26:09] this was a testimony of the king
[1:26:13] that god himself would set up his own
[1:26:16] son
[1:26:18] it would be an honor to the word
[1:26:21] above his own hunger and honor to the
[1:26:24] word
[1:26:25] above every test and temptation and
[1:26:28] everything that would come his way
[1:26:29] he would be tested in all points such as
[1:26:32] we are
[1:26:35] it would be a test but yet
[1:26:38] he would honor the word above
[1:26:41] his own feelings his own wants
[1:26:46] are you with me here is david
[1:26:50] let's say no i will not touch the lord's
[1:26:53] anointed it's the word david is honoring
[1:26:56] that's a contrast to saul saul has not
[1:26:59] honored the word
[1:27:00] when it what fits saul works for saul
[1:27:04] works this time it's all right if i've
[1:27:06] got to step in and be the priest i'll
[1:27:08] step in and be the priest and the
[1:27:09] prophet
[1:27:10] saul had no thoughts about crossing over
[1:27:12] and taking another position
[1:27:14] or moving into other areas of authority
[1:27:16] thought nothing of it
[1:27:18] why fear was removed from saul
[1:27:21] for him to even intrude in the office of
[1:27:24] a prophet and say
[1:27:25] well i'll just offer it up on my own god
[1:27:27] has an
[1:27:28] order and you cannot go outside of the
[1:27:31] order and god said well i'll just bless
[1:27:33] it
[1:27:33] god blesses the order of his word
[1:27:37] given by his spirit amen hallelujah
[1:27:41] when god came down to the tabernacle in
[1:27:43] the wilderness that was god saying
[1:27:45] this is my order come from vision
[1:27:48] to word now to manifestation
[1:27:51] same way in that the river jordan save
[1:27:54] away
[1:27:55] in this hour where god unites with his
[1:27:58] bride
[1:28:00] it's come under the order of the word
[1:28:02] and it welcomes his dwelling
[1:28:07] here's david
[1:28:13] so i i just there's i i'm just going to
[1:28:15] refer to
[1:28:16] this you know saul comes to place
[1:28:18] remember what he's witnessing
[1:28:21] he says you're more righteous than i
[1:28:26] bet if we ask david david you ever think
[1:28:28] you'd hear saul say that
[1:28:30] i don't know if he'd ever say it or not
[1:28:34] but david wasn't doing what he was doing
[1:28:37] to have saul say this to him
[1:28:39] what david did he did it as unto the
[1:28:42] lord
[1:28:43] he knew that even in the midst of
[1:28:45] pressure when things were being said and
[1:28:48] things were being done
[1:28:49] if i stand upon god's word he honored
[1:28:52] god's word and because he honored god's
[1:28:54] word
[1:28:54] he could honor a man that was in the
[1:28:57] wrong
[1:29:00] are you with me he could honor saul
[1:29:04] look at this you see in first samuel 24
[1:29:08] 20
[1:29:11] here's what saul says after seeing this
[1:29:15] now behold i know well that thou shalt
[1:29:18] surely be
[1:29:18] king and that the kingdom of israel
[1:29:22] shall be established in thine hand
[1:29:25] nobody
[1:29:26] told me nobody told saul
[1:29:30] david didn't run headlines david didn't
[1:29:32] put it on his facebook
[1:29:33] david didn't put it on twitter david
[1:29:35] didn't
[1:29:37] it was something to be displayed
[1:29:40] it's a character to be displayed
[1:29:44] what more fitting for a kingly character
[1:29:48] than to be tested by another king
[1:29:52] than to have a king who's coming to hunt
[1:29:54] you down
[1:29:56] wanting to kill you wanting to do
[1:29:58] everything he can
[1:29:59] to take your life but it wasn't saul
[1:30:03] it was the spirit are you with me it was
[1:30:07] a spirit behind him
[1:30:08] david knew that david knew that
[1:30:12] think of this there was a reflection of
[1:30:14] royalty going on
[1:30:20] you remember when the news came some
[1:30:24] some fellas thought they were bringing
[1:30:25] some good news to david
[1:30:29] the malachite came to david and said
[1:30:32] saul and jonathan
[1:30:35] are gone
[1:30:38] he begins to speak to david remember he
[1:30:41] announces
[1:30:43] that saul was still struggling for life
[1:30:46] and he
[1:30:47] went and finished him off
[1:30:50] david said dumb dumb dumb
[1:30:54] david took that man and he told the rest
[1:30:57] of him
[1:30:58] kill him he said because i would not
[1:31:01] touch the lord's anointing
[1:31:03] and you didn't know better but you
[1:31:05] touched god's anointed
[1:31:06] your life shall not remain
[1:31:09] what reverence that david had for saul
[1:31:13] even to where he would call out for not
[1:31:15] just jonathan
[1:31:16] but saul as well they were swifter
[1:31:19] than eagles let all israel mourn
[1:31:23] david mourned this is why another part
[1:31:27] we're not even close to it
[1:31:28] this is why love does not rejoice in
[1:31:30] iniquity
[1:31:31] love rejoices in truth
[1:31:36] hallelujah then you had another one that
[1:31:40] came
[1:31:42] they come to it you know you see things
[1:31:45] that took place
[1:31:46] david would not condone animosity
[1:31:50] against saul's house even when joab
[1:31:52] came against abner david said that blood
[1:31:55] will not be upon me
[1:31:57] and when it came time for solomon to
[1:31:58] take the throne
[1:32:01] one of the things that david tells
[1:32:02] solomon don't you let his head stay on
[1:32:05] him
[1:32:06] why because joab will do what joab wants
[1:32:09] to do
[1:32:09] when it fits joanna when he wants to be
[1:32:12] compliant he'll be compliant
[1:32:14] are you with me he went right up the
[1:32:16] things that joy did
[1:32:17] you see what it shows is self-will can't
[1:32:21] make it into the kingdom
[1:32:23] self-will is to be surrendered and
[1:32:25] dissolved
[1:32:27] to the leading of the lord oh my
[1:32:31] think of this here comes remember they
[1:32:34] killed one of the sons
[1:32:36] of ishabeth the these it's funny how you
[1:32:38] know it's something that
[1:32:40] these these men missed the anointing of
[1:32:42] the hour
[1:32:43] they killed uh and i don't know if i got
[1:32:46] the name right
[1:32:48] is she'll beth or whatever it is but
[1:32:51] they
[1:32:51] they killed him and they come running to
[1:32:54] david
[1:32:55] we have taken away those of
[1:32:59] a son of your adversary of your enemy
[1:33:04] david said kill him
[1:33:08] because you've touched the lord's
[1:33:10] anointed
[1:33:13] david never stood there and said you
[1:33:15] know what saul got what was coming to
[1:33:17] him
[1:33:18] he should have never did what he did
[1:33:21] isn't it funny how when somebody does
[1:33:22] this wrong we just know we've got thus
[1:33:24] saith the lord and whoever they are
[1:33:26] they're wrong the wrath of god is upon
[1:33:29] them
[1:33:31] oh my i'm glad it wasn't upon me
[1:33:35] because there's no doubt there's been a
[1:33:36] many times i've been wrong
[1:33:41] then you have even of that of jonathan's
[1:33:44] son
[1:33:45] where david even asked chapters and
[1:33:47] chapters later
[1:33:48] is there any one of saul's household
[1:33:51] still left
[1:33:52] that i may honor him is there anyone
[1:33:56] left
[1:33:57] that i may honor him and there was one a
[1:34:01] son of jonathan remember how
[1:34:04] david had him bring him david said he'll
[1:34:07] always eat
[1:34:08] at my table you'll always
[1:34:12] eat here it's a behavior
[1:34:16] that's fit for the throne and we're
[1:34:19] going
[1:34:21] we're going in a rapture
[1:34:24] what's going to be raptured is character
[1:34:28] sometimes the things like this we can
[1:34:30] read about
[1:34:32] and then the times when we're going
[1:34:33] through it but just to remind
[1:34:36] just to remind you maybe strip your mind
[1:34:38] here
[1:34:39] going through it and feeling certain
[1:34:42] ways
[1:34:44] having certain feelings arise does not
[1:34:47] make you a sinner
[1:34:48] or an unbeliever or a make-believer
[1:34:52] there's a struggle but as a son and
[1:34:54] daughter of god
[1:34:55] it's an opportunity to prevail to allow
[1:35:00] god's word to prevail
[1:35:04] this is why in our lives oh god
[1:35:07] keep me close to you lord
[1:35:10] keep me close to you this is why there's
[1:35:13] a
[1:35:14] sure the baptism of the holy ghost in
[1:35:16] our life it's brought a change in our
[1:35:18] life
[1:35:19] that's absolutely right it changed our
[1:35:22] desire
[1:35:23] it changed our nature there's things
[1:35:27] that
[1:35:27] still how the enemy would want to come
[1:35:30] but there's a strength on the
[1:35:31] there's a strength on the inside there's
[1:35:33] a desire
[1:35:35] that wants to please the lord
[1:35:38] and because of that desire that wants to
[1:35:40] please the lord
[1:35:41] that fears him
[1:35:46] in all of these things this is why we
[1:35:50] stand and say god
[1:35:52] mold me and shape me lord jesus
[1:35:56] this feeling that i have or it's
[1:35:58] something that god makes known in your
[1:36:00] life
[1:36:00] don't pull back on it that's the time to
[1:36:04] surrender
[1:36:05] that's the time to say lord cleanse me
[1:36:08] lord
[1:36:10] lord remove that lord in my life lord i
[1:36:12] don't want that there
[1:36:13] you see this is why you're you're
[1:36:15] standing like david where david said i
[1:36:17] hate that which thou hatest oh god
[1:36:19] stand on the side of the word stand
[1:36:22] against the opposition of the enemy
[1:36:25] and stand there god is faithful
[1:36:28] to his word this is the desire that we
[1:36:32] have
[1:36:33] in our life what pulsates in our hearts
[1:36:35] is
[1:36:36] that his life would be reflected in us
[1:36:40] not just in here but out there
[1:36:44] no matter where we go it's that
[1:36:48] the testimony that's left behind if
[1:36:50] that's a christian
[1:36:52] there's something real about their life
[1:36:55] because whether we
[1:36:56] know it or not somebody's watching our
[1:36:58] life
[1:36:59] you've had it sometimes on the job
[1:37:01] you've had it in other situations you've
[1:37:03] had things that come your way
[1:37:04] where things you could act unbecomingly
[1:37:08] maybe you did act a little rudely but
[1:37:11] what did you do with that did you turn
[1:37:12] right back around did you tell your
[1:37:14] family
[1:37:14] i shouldn't have acted this way i
[1:37:16] shouldn't have went this way
[1:37:18] i shouldn't have said that or go to your
[1:37:20] boss you know what
[1:37:21] i said that in the wrong way
[1:37:24] forgive me i might disagree with you
[1:37:28] but you're still my boss
[1:37:32] this is we're talking about character
[1:37:34] that's going to the throne
[1:37:37] reflect it oh god listen friends don't
[1:37:39] don't get down on yourself that's not
[1:37:41] why god brought it
[1:37:42] take it in tonight and say lord be it
[1:37:44] unto me
[1:37:46] let him just brood over your life let
[1:37:47] him just move in your heart
[1:37:49] let him just change you because he
[1:37:51] brings us to our attention
[1:37:52] because he loves us and he remember what
[1:37:55] he told us at the beginning
[1:37:56] he wants to reflect his life deeper
[1:37:59] through our lives
[1:38:01] amen let's pray heavenly father
[1:38:07] lord jesus
[1:38:10] you know every heart lord you know every
[1:38:13] every life
[1:38:15] lord as we look upon these things lord
[1:38:20] your god just just skimming through that
[1:38:24] and seeing
[1:38:26] in a reflection of a life thereof david
[1:38:30] lord jesus i'm
[1:38:33] sure the scriptures doesn't record it
[1:38:36] but i'm sure
[1:38:38] david had a lot of thoughts that went
[1:38:40] through
[1:38:41] the scriptures don't re record it lord
[1:38:44] altogether
[1:38:46] how that david had struggling
[1:38:49] i wonder how many times in prayer
[1:38:53] that david had for saul
[1:38:57] how many times the where you come to a
[1:39:00] place
[1:39:01] to where david could move into a place
[1:39:05] lord of prayer to where lord he was
[1:39:10] interceding for saul he wasn't putting
[1:39:14] him down in your presence
[1:39:17] lord god he would be praying for him
[1:39:20] and through that lord well
[1:39:23] we read of the strength that he received
[1:39:27] from you
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:29] no wonder lord how the prophet would
[1:39:33] be led by your spirit to take psalms 27
[1:39:38] as the text for the rapture
[1:39:42] to give the setting we knew lord that
[1:39:46] say many that were on the scene
[1:39:49] many knew first thessalonians first
[1:39:51] corinthians 15
[1:39:53] many of these promises if they would
[1:39:55] think about the rapture
[1:39:58] but your prophet when he would take that
[1:40:01] he would when he reads that text he said
[1:40:03] i'm doing this for a background
[1:40:07] lord of background is a setting
[1:40:11] where things lord would come up and
[1:40:14] come against us david david
[1:40:18] he declared from his life the lord is
[1:40:20] the strength
[1:40:21] of my life and lord as believers tonight
[1:40:27] your god i believe i'm one of them and i
[1:40:28] believe i'm speaking to believers
[1:40:30] tonight
[1:40:31] hearts that desire more than anything
[1:40:34] lord that your life would be reflected
[1:40:37] through us
[1:40:39] lord jesus we're not perfect but neither
[1:40:42] are we making excuses for anything lord
[1:40:45] we want to be molded we want to be
[1:40:47] shaped lord god i pray lord help us lord
[1:40:52] help us to die more to our pride
[1:40:55] help us to die more to our own feelings
[1:40:57] about things
[1:40:58] die more to our thoughts help us to
[1:41:00] recognize the lord and not get
[1:41:03] not get down or come under condemnation
[1:41:06] for
[1:41:07] dealing with things like that but may we
[1:41:08] recognize lord
[1:41:10] those are things lord how the enemy
[1:41:12] would come
[1:41:13] he would come against us but may we
[1:41:15] recognize this is an opportunity
[1:41:18] we're taking a stand against that
[1:41:22] because lord we love you
[1:41:26] we fear you lord we fear
[1:41:29] lord as brother brown could say i fear
[1:41:31] my mother fear my wife he went
[1:41:32] on and on and on and on help us lord
[1:41:36] tonight
[1:41:37] help us to grow lord truly lord
[1:41:41] if i were just to look at this
[1:41:44] by my own mortal strength i can say
[1:41:47] there's
[1:41:48] no way that i'm so glad
[1:41:52] it's not by my mortal strength lord
[1:41:56] i'm grateful lord god it's by your
[1:41:59] strength
[1:42:01] lord we know that but lord the life
[1:42:03] that's within us that paul says within
[1:42:05] us that desires
[1:42:07] that stands against that lord may lord
[1:42:10] is the children of god tonight
[1:42:12] may they recognize lord that that's part
[1:42:15] of the victory itself
[1:42:17] is recognizing that opposition
[1:42:20] recognizing lord that that's not
[1:42:23] part of who i am it's not part of my
[1:42:27] nature that's
[1:42:28] there's they're not comfortable with
[1:42:30] those feelings or thoughts or whatever
[1:42:32] when they come

[1:42:48] transplanting lord
[1:42:50] where the character that's been molded
[1:42:52] and shaped in this life
[1:42:54] will be placed there on the other side

[1:43:01] reflections

[1:43:42] [Music]
[1:43:50] word
[1:43:52] [Music]
[1:43:55] [Applause]
[1:43:55] [Music]
[1:44:04] sing
[1:44:05] [Applause]
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:18] foreign
[1:44:21] [Music]
[1:44:30] [Applause]
[1:44:32] oh
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:59] i
[1:45:00] [Music]
[1:45:10] his presence
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:35] [Applause]
[1:45:39] [Music]
[1:45:47] [Music]
[1:45:51] you know you think about it we've
[1:45:53] ministered on this before
[1:45:55] it's right here even in medical science
[1:45:58] and so forth
[1:45:59] how many when they'll talk about when
[1:46:01] they go to deal with a cancer patient
[1:46:04] that many of the times when they'll deal
[1:46:06] with one thing first thing they'll deal
[1:46:07] with
[1:46:08] is is there anything in their life a
[1:46:12] grudge
[1:46:13] unforgiveness or any of those things
[1:46:16] they said because if there's something
[1:46:18] like that that's there
[1:46:20] the medicine generally doesn't work
[1:46:25] then you find the things that
[1:46:29] you know you they find the things and
[1:46:31] this is just
[1:46:32] things you know years and years ago i
[1:46:34] brought out what brother branham
[1:46:35] remember he tells about
[1:46:36] worry causes cancer and goes through
[1:46:38] these things he talks about grudges
[1:46:44] i'm not saying that everybody that's had
[1:46:46] dementia or whatever more but
[1:46:48] find out how medical science goes into
[1:46:49] that they says a lot of times it's time
[1:46:51] to be very tied into where there's a
[1:46:52] grudge there's something that's been
[1:46:54] held there
[1:46:55] that's not been tended to let me just
[1:46:58] say this to you
[1:47:00] whether that's a hundred percent
[1:47:01] accurate or not
[1:47:04] i don't want no grudges
[1:47:07] i don't want nothing in my life
[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:10] but jesus i don't want to give no place
[1:47:14] to the enemy i don't want to give no
[1:47:16] excuse
[1:47:17] david could have gave a lot of excuses
[1:47:20] he could have done everything in the
[1:47:22] world against saul
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:27] but i wonder how many times brother
[1:47:29] brian that david was off somewhere
[1:47:31] praying
[1:47:33] god this feeling lord i have
[1:47:37] lord what saul has done but through
[1:47:39] prayer he would press into a way to
[1:47:41] where
[1:47:43] he would feel sorry for saul
[1:47:47] he would get to a place to where he went
[1:47:49] no more complaining
[1:47:51] he said brother samuel how can you say
[1:47:54] that
[1:47:54] because his respect to saul
[1:47:58] kept going that shows that david got to
[1:48:02] a place
[1:48:03] before god because we can never stand in
[1:48:06] god's presence
[1:48:07] and accuse somebody else
[1:48:12] if we can accuse anybody then we're not
[1:48:13] in his presence
[1:48:15] but when we get in his presence we can't
[1:48:17] accuse anybody
[1:48:19] the braham says you'll find yourself
[1:48:21] praying for them and
[1:48:22] having an understanding for them
[1:48:26] i tell you this is deep with cream on
[1:48:27] top
[1:48:30] it's not deep because i'm preaching it
[1:48:31] that's deep because this requires
[1:48:34] a real wrestling it out it requires
[1:48:38] strength from god
[1:48:42] like you have the same way i'd love to
[1:48:44] have a switch i can just
[1:48:46] flip somebody says something the wrong
[1:48:48] way to
[1:48:49] that switch just flips boy autopilot
[1:48:53] no it don't happen that way
[1:48:57] but there is something that is automatic
[1:48:59] on the inside
[1:49:01] and that's charity and charity says
[1:49:05] you can override it you can override it
[1:49:12] oh i'm so grateful well when we consider
[1:49:16] where we're going
[1:49:17] where we're going what god has called us
[1:49:20] to
[1:49:20] we look everything around oh god it's
[1:49:23] not just where we're going
[1:49:25] but that his life might flow freely
[1:49:29] flow freely let's sing it one more time
[1:49:32] [Music]
[1:49:40] singing
