[29:02] all my gratitude?

[29:26] short once again. All my words fall
[29:30] short.

[29:37] Yes, Lord. Where can I express
[29:44] all my gratitude? I could sing these
[29:47] songs.

[33:33] fire inside of those lungs. Get up.
[33:41] Oh praise to come on my soul once again.
[33:45] Come on my soul. Oh, don't you get shy

[34:05] So I'll throw up my hands and praise you
[34:10] again and again.
[34:14] All that I have is a
[34:20] new
[34:27] and I know it's not much but I'm nothing
[34:31] else fitting for the king
[34:35] except for a heart single.
[34:49] Let's all sing this now as brother
[34:51] Samuel comes. So I throw up. So I throw
[34:54] up my hand.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand this morning. Raise you
[34:58] again and again.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Cuz all that I have is a high.
[35:07] Hallelujah.
[35:11] Hallelu.
[35:15] And I know it's not much, but I have
[35:19] nothing else for the king
[35:24] except for a heart single.
[35:32] Hallelujah.
[35:46] Praise the name of the Lord Jesus.
[35:50] Praise the name of the Lord.
[35:52] Amen. God bless you.
[35:55] Amen.
[35:58] If you don't mind, I'll let you have
[35:59] your seats. I didn't communicate that
[36:02] with Paul, but um so good to see each
[36:04] and every one of you here in the in the
[36:07] house of the Lord. And uh we so thank
[36:10] God for his mercy and giving us grace to
[36:13] be able to be together
[36:14] &gt;&gt; once again. And um it's always such a
[36:17] real treat, amen, to be able to come to
[36:20] the house of the Lord. I mean I amen to
[36:23] no matter as brother Bram describes it,
[36:25] an everpresent water of the rock. He
[36:27] said, "No matter what is going on,"
[36:29] &gt;&gt; he said, "To a believer, it's a joy to
[36:31] go to the house of the Lord."
[36:33] &gt;&gt; And that is absolutely, I have found
[36:35] that to be the truth. Amen. It truly is
[36:38] that of a joy. It's a joy to be able to
[36:40] come together. Amen. To fellowship
[36:42] around the word of the Lord because
[36:43] sometimes when we when we walk in here,
[36:46] we maybe don't feel uh as joyous, but
[36:49] it's not the joy is not what is based on
[36:51] our our flesh.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; That's a joy the world gives and the
[36:55] world can take it away. But there's a
[36:57] joy that is on the inside that when we
[36:58] know we've passed from death unto life.
[37:00] And that's what gives us strength
[37:02] through every trial, through every
[37:03] circumstance, what what gives us the
[37:05] grace to press on. Amen. Through it all.
[37:08] And I'm glad it's a reality. Aren't you?
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, um, musicians, God bless
[37:14] you. Thank you. Um, so appreciate that
[37:16] this morning. And so appreciate the
[37:19] worship.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I just wanted to I mentioned on
[37:22] Thursday I did want to uh share just a
[37:25] few slides with you before I I get into
[37:26] speaking here uh this morning just on
[37:29] our uh the trip there just to uh to
[37:32] Belgium um which I think I even had
[37:36] communicated with you uh regarding
[37:40] we were supposed to uh fly out there on
[37:43] on Monday of that of that week. I
[37:46] believe it was the 29th and uh of course
[37:49] we knew the windstorm we had here and uh
[37:52] that was quite that was quite the
[37:53] ordeal. And then uh Tuesday we got um
[37:57] got the news my flight was delayed to
[37:59] Detroit. They had switched everything
[38:01] around and so I just I just told my wife
[38:04] I said just take me to the airport so I
[38:07] can talk to somebody at the front
[38:08] counter. And um so you know how that is
[38:12] when you fly. You know the the apps are
[38:14] amazing. Uh the app has really helped me
[38:16] a lot over the years, but sometimes even
[38:18] with the apps and those things that are
[38:20] going on and let alone try to get
[38:22] through uh you know to talk to somebody.
[38:24] Good luck on that one. Um and and there
[38:27] was a lot of backup from the weather. So
[38:29] but God made a way and uh we so I thank
[38:31] the Lord for that. I had to fly into uh
[38:35] uh Amsterdam right over here in
[38:36] Netherlands and then we took just a city
[38:38] hopper and came over here into Brussels
[38:40] and that's where the where we flew into.
[38:43] And then uh from Brussels uh brother
[38:46] David uh Iberson and them were right
[38:48] around Gent just a little past Gent in
[38:50] the city called Nazareth. And so uh we
[38:53] went there and I got in on that day
[38:56] which I think would have been Wednesday
[38:58] afternoon. And then uh so this is um
[39:01] this is brother David. You probably
[39:03] remember brother David from being here.
[39:05] The one time he's here. He preached on
[39:07] belittling spirits. Um brother David has
[39:10] really preached some wonderful um
[39:11] services. one that was it's really made
[39:13] its way around quite a bit and that is
[39:15] pressure to prophesy. It's been a very
[39:18] powerful service as well. Um so that um
[39:22] that we arrive there and um uh then here
[39:27] we have uh brother Kyle, brother Kyle
[39:30] Morton right here from uh he's from um
[39:33] Vancouver, Victoria Island. uh he
[39:35] pastors a a group there that u brother
[39:39] Bisco had encouraged him to start
[39:41] because of the the traveling back and
[39:44] forth across from Van Victoria Island to
[39:46] Vancouver it's quite expensive so for
[39:49] the people the believers that are there
[39:51] so brother Kyle um he was there with me
[39:54] ministering this is brother David again
[39:57] and then brother Simeon his brother and
[40:00] uh so this was a time right here that
[40:02] we're out there standing on the on the
[40:04] pier out in in the ocean. This is after
[40:05] the pressure had released from the
[40:08] services, but I was freezing to death.
[40:11] It was so cold. All I could think about
[40:13] is let me get back to the end of this
[40:15] pier because I have been promised a
[40:17] coffee.
[40:18] And so you can kind of you can kind of
[40:20] see that, you know, like right here that
[40:22] it's just the way things are are are
[40:25] kind of uh back in here. We were out
[40:27] standing and looking back in towards
[40:29] Newport and Newport is clear on the
[40:31] coast over on the west. And so this is
[40:34] the hostel where the uh young people
[40:36] were staying. So we actually had to um
[40:39] walk between buildings and uh this was
[40:42] the uh welcome. It's quite a production
[40:44] that uh that is put on in a big event
[40:47] center. And they've been doing this for
[40:50] for 30 years. And it was actually
[40:52] brother David when he was just a young
[40:54] man that just had the burden to uh seen
[40:57] the need to have youth meetings. And so
[40:59] when he took it to his his pastor then
[41:02] then all this uh was started there's a
[41:04] lot of a lot of different testimonies
[41:06] that have come out of there just as much
[41:08] uh like that of the different meetings
[41:11] that we have here in the states uh where
[41:14] you have different a lot of where where
[41:16] hearts have met the Lord in a personal
[41:17] way and then uh now those lives are
[41:20] serving God in some capacity. Um this is
[41:24] uh this is brother Simeon that puts all
[41:26] this together. So we I knew this going
[41:28] into it that all of this data that all
[41:30] that had registered where everybody came
[41:32] from. It also gives you a little bit of
[41:34] the uh the age ages that are there. And
[41:37] so we we had some that were there that
[41:39] were uh uh 34 and plus. And I I really
[41:42] to me when I'm coming into a meeting
[41:45] like this, I'm always very I'm very
[41:47] thankful that um even the older ones
[41:51] that they will come because they
[41:52] recognize that there's an also a part
[41:55] about giving back
[41:57] &gt;&gt; and giving back is also being part of
[41:59] helping create the atmosphere. And that
[42:00] that to me is always an encouragement
[42:02] because it it shows a little bit that's
[42:03] gone beyond self. And uh even when uh I
[42:07] speak to those at uh TWT in the
[42:09] afternoon session um down there in uh
[42:12] St. Mary's, I think it's the 19year-old
[42:15] and up, I'm always encouraged by the
[42:17] amount uh that's there um you know
[42:20] because that really shows a lot and and
[42:22] I understand that there are those that
[42:23] are coming because they have real needs
[42:26] in their lives and um as well and uh but
[42:29] it's just so encouraging and then so
[42:31] there was such a such an age group. It
[42:33] also helps in the preparation as you're
[42:35] getting ready. And um so you know, I
[42:38] looked at this one here and I I don't
[42:39] know I don't think they shared this, but
[42:41] boy, that boy and girl is pretty close.
[42:47] So I always get I always get chuckles
[42:49] out of those things, you know. I'm
[42:50] looking at all this right here. And so
[42:51] they have everything broke down, you
[42:53] know. And uh so this is where this right
[42:55] here in blue, and I don't know, I I may
[42:57] be in the way, but this in blue, this is
[42:59] where all of the um participants in the
[43:04] conference, this is where they all came
[43:06] from. It's
[43:07] &gt;&gt; in the blue. So there was just a a lot
[43:11] of different countries uh that were
[43:13] represented there. And so um you have
[43:16] just uh in the uh the event center there
[43:20] in the main um auditorium or sanctuary
[43:23] and um you know you can kind of um see
[43:26] they're worshiping there at the one part
[43:28] and brother Mark from in England there
[43:30] is uh is leading them and in some
[43:34] worship and so um they're really having
[43:37] a wonderful time in the Lord and um this
[43:41] is brother David just greeting also the
[43:44] people and the the young people kind of
[43:46] giving some directions and things like
[43:48] that and all that has taken place and uh
[43:51] one thing I found that I I so I really
[43:54] love because
[43:56] one thing that's been such a burden on
[43:58] my heart is discipling and the
[44:00] importance of that and to really
[44:01] understand what that is that there is
[44:03] such a an encouragement just as uh
[44:05] brother David uh came into um in the in
[44:10] the having of those meetings really
[44:12] working to labor within it. The the goal
[44:15] that they have even within this now it
[44:17] may be hard to see it but you see you
[44:19] take individuals like you'll take like
[44:21] brother Mark right here at one time
[44:22] brother Mark was just 11 12 13 year old
[44:26] young man sitting out there and now it's
[44:29] coming back and giving back and then you
[44:31] take brother Caleb brother Caleb's a
[44:33] translator in French was also one that
[44:36] was a recipient before but you know just
[44:38] working and and getting others getting
[44:41] the young people involved to where that
[44:43] they're uh part of the vision. And I
[44:45] certainly believe it like this that um
[44:49] you know I always feel um I always feel
[44:51] kind of strange anymore. Brother Kyle
[44:54] when I was there, brother Kyle was
[44:56] talking about, you know, how he had
[44:58] contacted me and about us, you know,
[45:00] with ministering together. And he said,
[45:01] you know, brother Samuel being a
[45:03] seasoned minister. And I thought, I
[45:05] don't when I look at myself, I look at
[45:06] myself as a young man.
[45:09] And that's the comfort, you know, it's
[45:11] like uh when I go to ministers meetings
[45:13] and you know there, you know, I had
[45:14] other brothers looking and saying, "Hey,
[45:15] we want we want to know what what your
[45:17] thoughts are and things." And I think,
[45:18] man, I my comfort is is always having
[45:21] those ahead of me. uh the older ones,
[45:23] you know, because um it's just such a
[45:25] such a blessing. I've been so blessed by
[45:27] by wonderful uh mentors um all along the
[45:31] way. And but I I say it in this way that
[45:33] I I don't believe we got to wait to a
[45:36] certain age to be effective.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; I I take the scripture that Paul told
[45:41] Timothy, he said, "Be thou an example."
[45:45] &gt;&gt; And so we don't have to wait. We we can
[45:47] be an example. We can begin to move and
[45:49] to act right now. is, you know, and ask
[45:52] the Lord, God, what would you have me to
[45:53] do? Uh because I certainly believe
[45:56] that's part of Christianity. I believe
[45:58] that with all my heart. I don't believe
[46:00] Christianity is like a restaurant. We go
[46:01] in and eat and then we just don't do
[46:03] nothing. Part of Christianity is what we
[46:05] take in and then how it's lived out and
[46:07] how that we serve the rest of the body.
[46:09] That's a that's a real vision. So,
[46:12] brother Kyle, he brother Kyle just he
[46:15] preached some just some wonderful
[46:16] messages there in the morning and just
[46:19] how God just so um brought things
[46:21] together. I've always I always marvel at
[46:23] this of how that um you know you never
[46:26] speak and never we never converse on
[46:28] what we're going to talk about and um
[46:31] sometimes you know I've had in times
[46:32] past where a brother will ask me what
[46:34] what's your theme and I'm like I don't
[46:36] like to do that because sometimes that
[46:38] can change and so you know I'll try to
[46:41] go along which the Lord did take me
[46:42] along the theme line of arise and shine
[46:45] uh within this meetings and I really
[46:47] spoke three services on fatherhood and
[46:50] dealing with uh us and becoming being
[46:52] sons and how God works with our lives.
[46:54] But um you know there's things that God
[46:56] can so change. But brother Kyle, he he I
[46:59] just watched how God just so brought
[47:00] things where brother Kyle would stop and
[47:02] it would just lay in then for the night
[47:04] service of where we would go. And
[47:06] brother Kyle preached the mornings and
[47:08] then of course we had uh the evening
[47:10] services and brother Jonathan um was was
[47:13] my uh interpreter. And so uh we were so
[47:18] thankful uh for for those brothers. they
[47:20] were very very good and uh it was they
[47:23] they they did everything to keep up and
[47:25] and so it was it was a great blessing.
[47:28] And then this was the dining hall and I
[47:30] was able to see that a few times and uh
[47:33] just right outside the dining hall right
[47:35] here you could look right out and see
[47:37] the ocean. So those are the uh and this
[47:40] dining hall it's a it's a historical
[47:42] building. um when you brother David was
[47:45] pointing this out. He didn't realize it
[47:46] until oh it might have been a year ago
[47:49] or so and his mother was even going back
[47:51] through the Fox's book of martyrs and
[47:53] how John Fox actually landed in Newport
[47:56] where we were at and so um there's a lot
[47:59] also a lot of different memorials but
[48:00] this is a historic building so they're
[48:03] actually uh working to redo all of that.
[48:05] So I I think they may actually have a
[48:07] pause on the Newport youth meetings
[48:09] there for at least a year or two because
[48:11] everything has to be done with
[48:12] historical beating uh buildings with
[48:14] such intricate detail. So um but uh and
[48:18] then this was u these pre these are
[48:21] pictures where the pressure is off.
[48:24] I'm the pressure is off. This is Sunday
[48:27] evening right here. Of course, you guys,
[48:29] by the time I'm sitting down right here,
[48:30] you all were just maybe getting out of
[48:32] service here on Sunday afternoon. And
[48:35] so, brother, brother Yoan, Brother
[48:37] David, Brother Simeon, and of course,
[48:39] Brother Kyle, and we're just uh moments
[48:41] away from going to our hotel and then
[48:43] going to fly out the next day. And of
[48:45] course, this is after we came off of
[48:46] that long walk on the pier. And yes, you
[48:49] do see a waffle sitting in front of me.
[48:51] And the waffle was instigated by Brother
[48:53] Trevor. Brother Trevor, you know, he was
[48:55] there last year and preached. Oh, you
[48:57] got to do a waffle. you got to do a
[48:58] waffle. I said, I I don't I don't I
[49:00] don't I don't eat things like that. And
[49:02] I said, I'm not saying I wouldn't like
[49:03] them, but you know, we were there and
[49:04] they were they were after me. Yeah, you
[49:06] just got to try it. And so we did. And
[49:09] um so then I I always thought was funny
[49:11] is that when I would ask them, I would
[49:14] ask I said, "I want an Americano. That's
[49:16] what I want. I want a black Americano."
[49:18] And they well that that's just coffee
[49:20] here. And so I said, "Well," they said,
[49:22] "You mean you want it strong?" That's
[49:24] strong. I want it strong. That's how I
[49:26] like it. So they, it was kind of funny,
[49:29] you know, I'm asking for that over there
[49:30] and I thought they would they would
[49:32] know, but they they knew how to take
[49:33] care of it. So, um, but the Lord was so
[49:36] was so good. Uh, I want to just, yeah, I
[49:38] wish there's more that I could convey to
[49:40] you. U, but to see, uh, your prayers
[49:44] within it all. I so appreciate your
[49:45] prayers. Uh, not only for the safe
[49:47] travels, but for those of you that have
[49:48] traveled, you know, it's important for
[49:50] your luggage to arrive.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; And so that was that was such a key. I
[49:56] was praying. I I told him I said pray
[49:58] for not only my flights but pray for my
[49:59] luggage uh that that it will arrive. So
[50:02] uh God was gracious and you know you
[50:04] know how little things come along the
[50:06] way and you can kind of get a little
[50:07] nervous because when I had to pass
[50:08] through Amsterdam they were having
[50:10] issues with getting luggage connected on
[50:13] flights and things. I thought, "Oh no,
[50:15] Lord Jesus, just watch over my bag,
[50:17] Lord." I'm not trying to be selfish, but
[50:20] just watch over my bag, Lord. You know,
[50:22] I don't mind preaching in jeans. I don't
[50:24] mind doing that at all, but uh Lord
[50:26] knows I you know I don't want to have to
[50:28] go out and get other things when you're
[50:29] there. But uh God was merciful, but most
[50:32] importantly um the Lord just moved in
[50:35] such a marvelous way uh within those
[50:37] services and um just just met just so
[50:41] many different needs. And you see um the
[50:44] young people just responding to the word
[50:46] of God right from the very start. And
[50:48] then um it was the second night uh we I
[50:51] still had one more night left to
[50:52] minister, but I knew going into the
[50:54] services on that second night and what I
[50:56] was going to uh felt led on my heart to
[50:59] really deal with and really work with
[51:01] deliverance, deal with spirits and just
[51:03] really focus on God bringing God's care
[51:06] down of how God cares for our hearts.
[51:09] And so with that um you know we we had
[51:12] um we had a prayer line. we had two was
[51:15] going and just the amount of needs that
[51:17] um
[51:22] that passes through. There's things and
[51:24] it's it's it's not the first time that
[51:26] you you're praying for needs like this,
[51:28] but it's just it's things at times that
[51:30] it's just um well, it's beyond what your
[51:34] mind can even comprehend sometimes the
[51:36] things that worth the young people have
[51:39] dealt with and what they're dealing
[51:40] with. And um but you know, I'm grateful
[51:43] that within it all that God does care.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm grateful that there is a bomb in
[51:49] Gilead that can bring healing to the
[51:52] soul
[51:53] &gt;&gt; as well as to the emotional realm. That
[51:55] no matter what tragedy, what travesty,
[51:57] what has taken place, whatever lays
[51:59] there, I'm glad there's healing.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I'm just so thankful to the
[52:04] Lord and um um you know, for all that he
[52:07] done. And like I said, Brother Kyle just
[52:09] to me preached just some wonderful
[52:11] messages. He really laid a lot of things
[52:12] in with a lot of with teaching and
[52:15] things like that. Just was just solid.
[52:18] Very, very good. So, um, if you have an
[52:21] opportunity, if you'd, you know, like
[52:22] maybe those services there that Brother
[52:24] Kyle had spoke, I believe you'd be
[52:25] blessed. Um, I know I had sent you the
[52:27] link and maybe if you, uh, if you didn't
[52:30] get it because you're not on Telegram, I
[52:32] can send that link to you. um because I
[52:35] think you would certainly be blessed by
[52:37] that. So I want to say thank you. Thank
[52:40] you for your your your prayers and your
[52:42] support and what a comfort it was um
[52:45] while we were there and how God did
[52:47] move. So if we could let's just stand
[52:50] and I want to I want to go right into
[52:56] uh the scriptures here in Matthew
[52:58] chapter 16.
[53:06] And perhaps just for time, there's
[53:08] certain things I'll just try to
[53:10] abbreviate without uh trying to ra
[53:13] without compromising the context of what
[53:16] we want to look at here this morning.
[53:20] And um I'll just kind of preface it in
[53:23] this way is that
[53:25] I I want to really to focus on divine
[53:30] revelation. We've been dealing with the
[53:32] embracing of deity, embracing
[53:36] uh the Holy Spirit that's in our midst,
[53:38] embracing this word. And I want to deal
[53:40] with divine revelation. And I want to um
[53:44] to really focus on that and and that
[53:46] even in a manner that would be um the
[53:49] way I look at this this morning to how
[53:51] God has taken it is um it shows the
[53:54] seriousness of where we're at and it
[53:58] also unveils the approach to God as well
[54:02] and things that when we're looking we're
[54:04] not left in a helpless situation but we
[54:09] can pray and we can ask God and God will
[54:13] certainly move on our behalf. And so I'm
[54:17] very thankful for that. We're never with
[54:18] we're never without a hope without a
[54:20] hope or an out. In Matthew 16, when
[54:23] Jesus came into the coast of Cesaria
[54:25] Philippi, he asked his disciples,
[54:28] saying, "Whom do men say that I, the son
[54:32] of man, am?" And they said, "Some say
[54:36] thou art John the Baptist and some Elias
[54:39] and others Jeremas or one of the
[54:42] prophets." And he said unto them, "But
[54:46] whom say ye that I am?" So at first he
[54:49] asked, "Who do men?" It's a different
[54:51] crowd. They then men had their answer,
[54:54] but then he comes down personal.
[54:58] Who do you say that I am? And Simon
[55:01] Peter answered and said, "Thou art the
[55:02] Christ, the Son of the living God." And
[55:05] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[55:07] "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for
[55:09] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[55:12] unto thee, but my father which is in
[55:16] heaven, and I say also unto thee, that
[55:18] thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
[55:21] will build my church, and the gates of
[55:24] hell shall not prevail against it."
[55:26] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[55:28] prayer.
[55:29] Heavenly Father, Lord, as we have just
[55:33] read Lord in your word. Now Lord, we
[55:38] certainly believe this Lord and we know
[55:42] this by experience in our own life that
[55:44] God it is not a flesh and blood affair.
[55:49] We know that God that you use man but
[55:52] Lord it is never man imparting
[55:55] revelation from one to another. It is
[55:57] you, Father, that does the work. So
[56:00] Lord, as you come Lord, and it's you
[56:03] that opens the eyes, may you just speak
[56:06] to our hearts, every one of us, Lord, in
[56:08] a very personal way, Lord, that Father,
[56:11] even if we are are sitting here, Lord,
[56:14] in a place this morning, that dear God,
[56:18] that we have completely experienced,
[56:21] Lord, the divine grace in our life,
[56:23] Lord, of this blessed revelation of
[56:26] Jesus Christ, Lord, it gives us, Lord,
[56:29] are just a real uh a real direction,
[56:33] Lord, and even how to pray for our loved
[56:35] ones, how to pray for others, Lord. And
[56:38] I pray that God that you'll just, Lord,
[56:42] help me. Let the man part step aside.
[56:45] May you come and speak to our hearts in
[56:47] a personal way, Lord. And I pray for
[56:50] those, Lord, that are not able to be
[56:52] here, Lord. You see how sickness has
[56:54] Lord just wanted to just move, Lord,
[56:57] among us. And we so thank you, God, for
[57:00] your grace touching us, Lord. Different
[57:02] ones, Lord, that where we've, Lord, been
[57:04] out for some time, but your grace has
[57:07] restored us in our bodies. And there's
[57:09] others, Lord, they need that touch.
[57:11] Would you visit them right where they're
[57:13] at, Lord, in their home right now, Lord,
[57:16] we ask for you, Father, the great
[57:18] enforcer of your word, Lord, for it's by
[57:20] your stripes we're healed. And we ask it
[57:22] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[57:26] God bless you as you're being seated.
[57:29] Amen.
[57:36] Pardon me.
[57:44] So I want to I want to focus here upon
[57:47] this uh aspect of it in looking at um
[57:52] divine revelation and within the
[57:55] scriptures as it says in the book of
[57:59] Hebrews, faith is the substance of
[58:02] things hoped for and the evidence of
[58:05] things not seen. For by it the elders
[58:09] obtained a good report. And through
[58:12] faith we understand that the worlds were
[58:14] framed by the word of God, so that the
[58:17] things which are seen were not made of
[58:20] things which do appear. But without
[58:23] faith, it is impossible to please God.
[58:28] For he that cometh to God must believe
[58:30] that he is, and that he is a rewarder of
[58:33] them that diligently seek him.
[58:37] So when we realize that when we're
[58:40] speaking of divine revelation and it's
[58:42] such a a vast uh subject and topic but
[58:47] yet it yet in the simplicity and I trust
[58:50] that that's what would be conveyed is
[58:52] that divine revelation is what brings
[58:54] you in contact with the source of life
[58:59] because every promise of God must be
[59:02] accepted by faith and faith Faith is a
[59:07] revelation of God's will.
[59:10] This is why that even as we if you think
[59:14] back over the previous weeks have we've
[59:16] been looking and really um laboring on
[59:18] those scriptures where Jesus said, "How
[59:20] long have I been with you?" Because the
[59:24] whole revealing was also to reveal what
[59:28] God's real purpose was. And that was for
[59:31] God to come and to dwell in man. That's
[59:34] what the Messiah would also reveal. And
[59:38] then we find that when um things did not
[59:40] go according to how the disciples
[59:43] thought that it it would go, but yet God
[59:48] coming down becoming one of us. He went
[59:50] and paid the price. And then in Luke 24,
[59:52] he steps out and begins to gather them
[59:54] because now now is their portion of the
[59:59] coming of the Lord being that they have
[1:00:02] to be gathered to that word to receive
[1:00:04] that word that Jesus said not only will
[1:00:07] I be with you but I'll be in you because
[1:00:10] when he was with them they didn't have
[1:00:12] perfect oneness. The prophet also goes
[1:00:14] on to tell us when he was with them they
[1:00:16] didn't have perfect faith. He said
[1:00:18] because it takes the Holy Spirit in your
[1:00:20] life to bring that perfect faith. Yet
[1:00:23] they had faith to a measure to cast out
[1:00:26] evil spirits to go preach the gospel,
[1:00:28] right? But then they came to that place
[1:00:31] of that epileptic child and so forth.
[1:00:33] And then brother Rama always pick up on
[1:00:35] that and especially in the message
[1:00:37] perfect faith. And he deals with how the
[1:00:39] only way that you can have that perfect
[1:00:41] faith and to be a candidate for that to
[1:00:44] to move is for to have the Holy Spirit
[1:00:47] dwelling within our lives. And so that
[1:00:50] real revelation is what brings is what
[1:00:54] um brings faith and it reveals God's
[1:00:57] will. It's revelation that stabilizes
[1:01:01] our life. It gives us it gives us the
[1:01:04] clarity of what we are to pursue. So in
[1:01:07] other words, it's just like when a
[1:01:09] person is coming to receive the Holy
[1:01:11] Ghost, they first of all have to know
[1:01:13] what the Holy Ghost is.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; That's why you just can't say receive.
[1:01:17] You you've they have to know what that
[1:01:19] is. That that's then that's where you
[1:01:21] start to God reveal to them what this is
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; because like the prophet is he tells us,
[1:01:28] you have to come with faith. So, it's
[1:01:31] faith in the living God just like every
[1:01:33] promise. And that's why the prophet
[1:01:35] would tell us in desperation, he said,
[1:01:36] "If you're coming across the platform,"
[1:01:39] he said, "and you're coming up here for
[1:01:40] prayer and saying, I don't know if God
[1:01:42] will heal me. I've been prayed for this
[1:01:43] or that." He says, "You might as well
[1:01:45] just stay in your seat because nothing's
[1:01:46] going to take place because you have to
[1:01:48] have faith.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Faith is not a hope so, but faith is is
[1:01:52] where it is anchored and you can't
[1:01:54] explain it." And so Jesus here when he
[1:01:57] he picks this up and he says in Luke 10
[1:02:01] and verse 21, he says, "In that hour
[1:02:04] Jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said, I
[1:02:07] thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven
[1:02:09] and earth, that thou hast hid these
[1:02:11] things from the wise and prudent, and
[1:02:14] has revealed them unto babes. Even so,
[1:02:17] Father, it seemed good in thy sight. All
[1:02:20] things are delivered to me of my father
[1:02:23] and no man knoweth who the son is but
[1:02:25] the father and who the father is but the
[1:02:28] son and he to whom the son will reveal
[1:02:31] him. And you you find how brother
[1:02:34] Brandon will always take when he will
[1:02:37] quote this scripture here out of Luke
[1:02:39] and Matthew and brother Brandon will
[1:02:41] always put that on unto babes such as
[1:02:44] would learn and it's expressing what
[1:02:47] what that is expressing of is that of
[1:02:49] that of humility
[1:02:52] because the in the the the scripture
[1:02:55] tells us that to when we see the mighty
[1:02:59] hand of God we see God moving
[1:03:02] Then at that moment as you see God
[1:03:04] moving, God vindicating his word. That's
[1:03:07] true. It doesn't mean that you have to
[1:03:09] understand it. It's that you recognize
[1:03:12] that's God.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; That this is God that's that's speaking
[1:03:16] to my heart. This is this is this is
[1:03:18] something more than a man. This is God
[1:03:22] who's moving. You see God coming and
[1:03:24] vindicating his word. Then that's the
[1:03:26] time to humble ourselves under the
[1:03:28] mighty hand of God. and then he will
[1:03:31] exalt us in due time. It's not it's we
[1:03:35] it's not us having to exalt ourselves.
[1:03:38] It's not us having to bring ourselves
[1:03:41] above sin. It's not us having to bring
[1:03:44] ourselves beyond an unbelieving
[1:03:46] condition. But it is the power of God
[1:03:49] that comes through the submission of our
[1:03:52] heart to God who is revealing himself to
[1:03:56] be the same yesterday, today, and
[1:03:58] forever. And so, you know, I know that
[1:04:00] might seem very uh it might seem very
[1:04:03] simple, but remember the Pharisees and
[1:04:06] the men and all the way through the
[1:04:08] scriptures, many saw the word being
[1:04:12] vindicated from Cain all the way down,
[1:04:15] but they saw what was truth, but they
[1:04:19] weren't willing to submit to it.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; They stood in opposition to it. But then
[1:04:26] there were others who saw it to be
[1:04:28] truth. BUT IT WAS MORE THAN just truth.
[1:04:30] They saw it as the source of life. Now
[1:04:33] what did that? What separated what made
[1:04:37] the difference is divine revelation.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Divine revelation is so important. This
[1:04:43] is why that the prophet would say that
[1:04:46] regarding revelation that he says it can
[1:04:49] never the importance of revelation can
[1:04:52] never be overemphasized.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say I'm not talking
[1:04:58] about the book of revelation. I'm
[1:05:00] talking about all revelation
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; because revelation is God's channel of
[1:05:07] speaking to your heart. Right?
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; And this is why remember when brother
[1:05:11] Brandham takes that and you you hear him
[1:05:14] refer to this multiple times in the
[1:05:16] message and I I love the time there in
[1:05:19] who is this Melzdc where he's speaking
[1:05:21] to a man that's you know come out of
[1:05:23] training from from um seminary and you
[1:05:26] know he's oh you know brother Brandham
[1:05:28] you you're off on this with the trinity
[1:05:30] and so forth and and brother Brandham
[1:05:32] just you know dropping just simple
[1:05:34] questions and and I want to say this
[1:05:35] brother Brandham was not a positioner or
[1:05:37] a debater.
[1:05:39] He was a son of God.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; He wasn't a fighter.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; He was just It was just There was times
[1:05:46] like Brother Brham says, you know, you
[1:05:48] you just start plugging the holes and
[1:05:50] eventually the rabbit can't run. But
[1:05:52] Brother Brand never went. It's just
[1:05:53] like, look, this is why, let me just
[1:05:55] show you this. This is why Brother Bram
[1:05:57] says he remember he got a letter,
[1:05:59] unveiling of God, I believe it's where
[1:06:00] it's at. Brother Bram got a letter and
[1:06:02] he found out this somebody was just
[1:06:04] going right down through the time and
[1:06:05] raking him over. And brother Bram said,
[1:06:07] "I come to realize it was a woman
[1:06:09] preacher." He said, "So I thought, I'm
[1:06:10] not even going to give my time to that."
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Why? It didn't merit it.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; You see, and this is where that we need
[1:06:18] the real sovereign grace of God because
[1:06:20] our heart, listen now, if our heart is
[1:06:23] right, uh, debating is all about proving
[1:06:26] or winning an argument.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; That's not about helping a soul.
[1:06:30] But when even in the helping of a soul,
[1:06:33] remember where the prophet he's telling
[1:06:34] this in uh uh I believe it's marriage
[1:06:37] and divorce uh that he's standing there
[1:06:39] and he says here I am standing outside
[1:06:41] and he's you know and here's a there's a
[1:06:43] man that came by and you know he's
[1:06:44] talking to brother Brandham about
[1:06:45] serpent seed and and he says well
[1:06:47] brother Brandham if if that's what took
[1:06:49] place in the garden where's it at now?
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says I just paused for
[1:06:54] a minute. I I didn't know what to say.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; I love that transparency.
[1:06:59] I love that. Don't you?
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said all of a
[1:07:02] sudden he said the HOLY SPIRIT SAID,
[1:07:03] "TELL HIM IT'S RIGHT HERE."
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Without any explanation, BROTHER
[1:07:08] BRANDHAM SAYS, "IT'S HERE." And he said,
[1:07:10] all of a sudden the man said, "Well,
[1:07:11] SURE IT IS, BROTHER BRANDHAM." That's
[1:07:13] exactly right.
[1:07:17] YOU SEE THE POWER OF INSPIRATION. GOD
[1:07:20] HELP US. AND I'M NOT WANTING to say that
[1:07:22] we become make ourselves odd and
[1:07:24] strained when we just walk around and
[1:07:26] we're looking at our family and we're
[1:07:28] all our eyes are bugged out and what are
[1:07:30] you doing? Well, I'm waiting on a
[1:07:31] revelation before I can talk to you. No,
[1:07:33] no, that that's not what that's not how
[1:07:35] Brother Brandham was going about that.
[1:07:36] We were not. Remember, we were we were
[1:07:39] uh counseledled. DON'T MAKE yourself
[1:07:42] odd.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. The world already labels
[1:07:47] believers that have come in contact with
[1:07:50] that other world as odd.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; But we don't have to make OURSELVES
[1:07:54] NOTHING. JUST BE A BELIEVER.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be called odd because
[1:08:02] you've made yourself odd because that is
[1:08:04] odd.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; That was deep.
[1:08:12] But you you realize that it's the THE
[1:08:15] WHOLE GOD'S DESIRE IN revealing himself
[1:08:19] is to get his program across.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; It's also revelation is a channel that
[1:08:26] Satan cannot get into.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot know this revelation.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; HE HAS KNOWLEDGE. THERE'S THINGS HE'S
[1:08:37] LOOKED AT. THERE'S THINGS HE'S SEEN. BUT
[1:08:39] HE CANNOT know this revelation. Now you
[1:08:43] might look and SAY, "WELL, CAIN KNEW THE
[1:08:45] PERFECT WILL OF GOD." That's right.
[1:08:47] Brother Brand tells us perfect
[1:08:49] transformation, God's power to transfer
[1:08:51] form. He said, "Satan knows the will of
[1:08:54] God, but refuses to do it."
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Now, this is where we want to drop in on
[1:08:58] knowing it versus it being revealed.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE between
[1:09:03] knowledge and revelation. Right.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; A PERSON CAN HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS
[1:09:08] THE TRUTH but never give themselves to
[1:09:10] it. You say, "WELL, THEN HOW DO THEY
[1:09:12] COME TO A PLACE? HOW DID YOU COME TO A
[1:09:14] PLACE TO WHERE YOU give yourself to it?"
[1:09:16] It's got to be revealed.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; It must be revealed. And I'm grateful
[1:09:21] for the grace of God that comes by and
[1:09:24] reveals himself to you and I.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Bram says it's like a
[1:09:28] man who's sitting and he's heard the
[1:09:29] preaching of the word all of his life.
[1:09:31] HE SAID, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING
[1:09:33] JUST STRIKES HIM AND HE'S LIKE, "WHOA,
[1:09:35] THAT'S WHAT IT IS." AND HE SAID, "AS
[1:09:37] SOON AS IT STRIKES THAT MAN," HE SAID,
[1:09:39] "RIGHT THERE, HE CONFESSES IT. HE'S
[1:09:41] SAVED. IT'S DONE."
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; IT STRIKES JUST THAT WAY. SO, HOW SHOULD
[1:09:46] WE BE PRAYING, "OH, GOD, LET THE
[1:09:48] REVELATION STRIKE, LORD."
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; that's a sovereign work of God. This is
[1:09:57] why your new birth and my new birth is
[1:10:00] not born of the will of flesh.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; It's not born of a church. It's born of
[1:10:07] God.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; It's God working. God will work through
[1:10:11] individuals to influence, to display, to
[1:10:14] encourage us, but it's all a work of
[1:10:16] almighty God.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; And this is why when brother Brandham in
[1:10:19] with this particular uh uh uh uhh
[1:10:22] brother, he says, "Well, I can't accept
[1:10:24] revelation." And brother Bram says it
[1:10:26] like this. Then there's no way for God
[1:10:29] to ever get to you
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; because it's hid from the eyes of the
[1:10:34] wise and prudent and revealed to babes
[1:10:37] revelation such as we'll accept it
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; and learn. There'd be no way for God to
[1:10:43] get to you because you close yourself
[1:10:45] off from him. So revelation, he said
[1:10:49] that's everything. That's that's what
[1:10:51] there's no other way to God only by
[1:10:53] revelation. When you realize that Job,
[1:10:55] this is why brother Bram will pick it up
[1:10:57] in the closing services in ' 65. I've
[1:10:59] heard but now I see on the wings of a
[1:11:01] snow white dove, invisible union, bride
[1:11:03] of Jesus Christ, trying to do God a
[1:11:05] service. And there's a theme that is
[1:11:07] even interwoven in there of of how with
[1:11:10] the revelation being so uh important
[1:11:14] because these men did not even have a
[1:11:18] written Bible. But brother Bram says
[1:11:21] what they had was revelation. And he
[1:11:23] said, "After all, that's what's more
[1:11:26] important."
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham WASN'T DOING AWAY
[1:11:28] WITH THE BIBLE. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS
[1:11:30] VERY CLEAR BY SAYING, HE SAID, "WE'VE
[1:11:32] had men that's argued over words, and if
[1:11:34] we can, Brother Brand, if we can JUST
[1:11:36] GET THEM TO SAY THIS word correctly, or
[1:11:37] they study this language, AND BROTHER
[1:11:39] BRANDHAM SAID, THAT'S NOT WHAT'S NEEDED.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; WHAT WE NEED IS THE HOLY SPIRIT TO GIVE
[1:11:45] A REVELATION OF WHAT IS ALREADY LAYING
[1:11:48] THERE."
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT GOD HAS PROMISED. AND
[1:11:52] THAT'S WHAT HE'S DONE. AND HE'S STILL IN
[1:11:54] THE MIDST OF THIS AGE REVEALING HIMSELF.
[1:11:56] THE MESSENGER HAS COME AND GONE. THE
[1:11:59] MESSAGE HAS BEEN DELIVERED. BUT THE SAME
[1:12:01] GOD THAT INSPIRED THE PROPHET WHERE THE
[1:12:04] PROPHET DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO LOOK
[1:12:06] IN THE SCRIPTURES UNTIL GOD TOLD HIM
[1:12:08] WHERE TO LOOK.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Standing in the message rapture, he
[1:12:12] said, "YOU HEAR THESE MEN TALKING ABOUT
[1:12:14] PROMISE OF THE HOUR, MESSAGE OF THE
[1:12:16] HOUR." He said, "What they're referring
[1:12:17] to is THE PROMISE THAT GOD HAS MADE."
[1:12:19] AND HE SAID, "WE WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW
[1:12:21] WHERE TO LOOK IF THE HOLY SPIRIT HAD NOT
[1:12:25] GUIDED US THERE."
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; SO THIS MESSAGE IS NOT THE ENTHUSIASM OR
[1:12:32] IMPRESSIONS OF A MAN THAT I FEEL LIKE WE
[1:12:35] NEED THIS RIGHT NOW. THAT'S NOT WHAT
[1:12:37] THIS MESSAGE IS. AND NEITHER is our
[1:12:39] lives to be under that kind of a
[1:12:41] governance either.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; God knows what we have need of.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; He supplies all that we have need of.
[1:12:47] And a matter of fact, when God ministers
[1:12:49] to our needs, there's ways and many
[1:12:51] times God will do things. Let's just say
[1:12:53] in a service, it can come through by way
[1:12:55] of a text that you would never have
[1:12:57] selected or thought that that through
[1:12:59] that text. And it isn't necessarily
[1:13:01] maybe that text, but it's how God is
[1:13:03] going to speak and bring that word to
[1:13:05] such an application in our hearts to
[1:13:07] where the very answer that we've been
[1:13:09] looking for, we hear our answer coming
[1:13:13] from God's own voice.
[1:13:15] It really gives us a confidence to say,
[1:13:18] Lord, no matter no matter where I'm at,
[1:13:20] I've come here and I'm going to receive
[1:13:22] from you this morning.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; So divine revelation, the whole church
[1:13:30] is built upon that and that's what makes
[1:13:32] a difference. Now, brother Bam will take
[1:13:36] this in Christ the mystery of God
[1:13:37] revealed and he's picking up what we
[1:13:40] just read in Matthew 16 where he says
[1:13:45] they he asked them the question what do
[1:13:47] you think that I am now he says and then
[1:13:51] he asked the question what does man
[1:13:53] think I am I want you to catch this what
[1:13:55] does man think I am today he's a
[1:13:58] philosopher this social religion he was
[1:14:01] a good man we believe his teaching is
[1:14:03] right? Subject to be lived by. I think
[1:14:05] it'd all make us better if we did. We We
[1:14:07] ought to have churches and so forth.
[1:14:09] Brother Bram said, "That's a Santa Claus
[1:14:10] story."
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; See, the message is not something just
[1:14:16] to make you live better.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; The message is not just something that's
[1:14:21] good.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; The message is not just something that
[1:14:24] is, well, this is perfect truth. It's
[1:14:26] life.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Because this message is Jesus Christ.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; That's not me propping it up. GOD'S
[1:14:33] ALREADY VINDICATED IT. GOD DOESN'T NEED
[1:14:35] IT'S NOT GOD DOESN'T NEED ME TO PROP IT
[1:14:37] UP. GOD'S ALREADY VINDICATED THIS TRUTH.
[1:14:39] AND NOW HIS SOURCE OF VINDICATION IS NOT
[1:14:43] ON A PLATFORM. HIS SOURCE OF
[1:14:44] VINDICATION, YOUR LIFE IS THE PLATFORM
[1:14:47] THAT JESUS CHRIST IS BEING DISPLAYED
[1:14:50] THROUGH.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE HE WANTS TO BE DISPLAYED
[1:14:52] THROUGH. THAT'S THE PLATFORM. THAT'S
[1:14:54] WHERE HE WANTS TO LIVE OUT HIS LIFE. AND
[1:14:56] ALL OF YOUR WEAKNESSES, EVERYTHING ELSE
[1:14:58] IN YOUR LIFE, THOSE ARE ONLY
[1:15:00] OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOD'S GRACE TO SHINE
[1:15:02] THROUGH IN YOUR LIFE TO SHOW THAT THE
[1:15:05] MIGHTY CONQUEROR IS STILL INDEED THE
[1:15:08] SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that God pulls back on
[1:15:14] when he looked at your life or looked AT
[1:15:16] MY LIFE. LISTEN, EVEN AFTER THE HOLY
[1:15:18] SPIRIT HAS COME AND NOW GOD BEGINS TO
[1:15:20] WORK WITH OUR CHARACTER, God is not
[1:15:22] looking at this sweating bullets. He has
[1:15:25] provided all that is necessary and all
[1:15:27] that's needed and all that is needed is
[1:15:29] the character of his own life on the
[1:15:32] inside.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; And then that re revelation continuing
[1:15:35] to unfold not outside of us but in us.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Remember he said he would come in and s
[1:15:43] with us.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; So we see him on the outside. That's
[1:15:47] where what builds our faith when you can
[1:15:49] recognize who's in our midst. But then
[1:15:51] as we recognize who's in our midst,
[1:15:52] who's knocking on our door, when we let
[1:15:54] him in, then when he comes in, then he
[1:15:56] begins to reveal himself.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; AND AS HE'S REVEALING HIMSELF, REMEMBER
[1:16:01] HE that revealing OF HIMSELF IS NOT JUST
[1:16:04] TO YOU, in you, but now through you.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; That's the objective of this word. In
[1:16:10] other words, to where his seal, his life
[1:16:13] is what's on display and that's what's
[1:16:15] shown. Brother Ram goes on and says it's
[1:16:17] not an expression of some church that we
[1:16:20] should express something. It's a life
[1:16:23] that you don't live yourself, but he
[1:16:25] comes in and lives by himself and you
[1:16:29] become a PRISONER TO ANY HUMAN
[1:16:32] intellectual being at all. You're led by
[1:16:34] the spirit. Right?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; This is why listen, the message has got
[1:16:40] to become personal.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Because it can't just be, well, our
[1:16:45] church teaches this. It's not an
[1:16:46] expression of a church.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; If it just remains that way, IT'S ONLY A
[1:16:51] SEASON OF TIME.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S NOT NOTHING TO HOLD YOU.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; YOU IT'S GOT IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
[1:16:57] WHERE YOU RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S HIM
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN EVEN RECOGNIZE YOUR
[1:17:02] WEAKNESS. LORD, I NEED STRENGTH IN MY
[1:17:05] LIFE TO QUENCH THESE DESIRES.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RECOGNIZING WHO'S IN OUR MIDST.
[1:17:10] THE SAME ONE WHO WALKED ON THE WATER.
[1:17:13] THE SAME ONE WHO TOOK A LITTLE LAD'S
[1:17:15] LUNCH.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRAM SAID, "YOU GOT A LITTLE
[1:17:19] FAITH? PUT IT IN HIS HAND TONIGHT."
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "YOU GOT PROBLEM WITH LUST? PUT
[1:17:24] IN HIS HAND."
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "WATCH WHEN YOU PUT IN HIS
[1:17:28] HAND, AS THE SERVICE GOES ON, YOU'LL
[1:17:30] FIND your life being changed."
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:33] Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; GLORY be to God. What a place of safety.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Brother, this ain't an insurance
[1:17:41] advertisement with hands open. This is
[1:17:43] blessed assurance.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; JESUS IS MINE. OH, WHAT A FORETASTE OF
[1:17:47] GLORY DIVINE.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. This is why brother Ram just
[1:17:52] reading these to lay these in for us. He
[1:17:54] says, you know, he says when a real man
[1:17:59] is to lose his own thoughts and his own
[1:18:02] way of thinking, not come up blindly
[1:18:05] like that. No, no, you come up with your
[1:18:09] right senses.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; And Christ takes you over and expresses
[1:18:14] himself.
[1:18:15] He says when Christ takes you over,
[1:18:18] he'll express that word right through
[1:18:20] you because it's him.
[1:18:23] Let me just pause here just for a
[1:18:24] moment.
[1:18:28] God has examples setting throughout an
[1:18:32] assembly.
[1:18:34] Let me just say even to the older ones
[1:18:36] as pillars of thisam of this assembly is
[1:18:40] to be an example of what God can do,
[1:18:44] what God has done. Because to be able to
[1:18:47] look, let me just say to the younger
[1:18:48] ones to understand this is that everyone
[1:18:52] that you see sitting around here is an
[1:18:54] older elder. It isn't that life has been
[1:18:57] easy.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; It isn't that things have been handed to
[1:19:00] them. It isn't that that they have a
[1:19:03] greater mind over matter. Oh, if I only
[1:19:05] had that fortitude.
[1:19:07] God don't no flesh can glory in his
[1:19:09] presence. There might be some really
[1:19:11] gifted people mentally and everything
[1:19:13] else, but that's not what's holding you.
[1:19:15] I'm going to tell you when you look
[1:19:16] around what it what is holding is the
[1:19:18] revelation
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; because revelation is lifegiving.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; That's where when you have been at maybe
[1:19:25] your lowest moment of discouragement,
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; weary and even as an elder you felt like
[1:19:34] just just you felt like giving in.
[1:19:35] There's no desire to go back to the
[1:19:37] world.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; But you just you just you you run out of
[1:19:40] strength. SOMETIMES YOU GET WEARY. YEAH.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO SAY THIS. GOD BLESS YOU
[1:19:46] FOR BEING FOR STANDING AND LETTING THAT
[1:19:48] WORD HAVE PREEMINENCE IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR BEING AN EXAMPLE. THANK
[1:19:53] YOU FOR BEING A TESTIMONY. BECAUSE EVEN
[1:19:55] AS I STAND RIGHT HERE THIS MORNING, I
[1:19:57] KNOW THERE ARE LIVES SITTING RIGHT HERE,
[1:19:59] RIGHT NOW THAT THAT AS FAR AS HOW YOU
[1:20:02] FEEL, HOW THINGS ARE GOING ON, YOUR
[1:20:04] EMOTIONS, THAT IF YOU WENT BY THAT, YOU
[1:20:06] WOULDN'T BE HERE AT ALL. BUT GOD'S GRACE
[1:20:08] IS SUFFICIENT. AND YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
[1:20:11] YOU LOVE THE LORD AND SAYING, "GOD, I
[1:20:13] NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU, LORD." YOU MIGHT
[1:20:15] BE LIKE ELIJAH THIS MORNING. I NEED,
[1:20:18] LORD, THE ANGEL WITH SOFT HANDS.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; I NEED, LORD GOD, THE RAVENS TO DROP
[1:20:25] SOMETHING MY WAY, LORD.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, yes. Yes. BECAUSE IT'S
[1:20:33] IT'S CHRIST. WHAT WAS IT THAT KEPT THE
[1:20:35] REST of them resolute and pressing on?
[1:20:38] It was that revelation and I think we
[1:20:40] can see what the importance of
[1:20:42] revelation is. LISTEN, MOSES KNEW WHAT
[1:20:45] THE TRUTH WAS, but it wasn't revealed to
[1:20:47] him,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; He had knowledge of it. In the face of
[1:20:51] knowledge, he went and killed one, one
[1:20:53] Egyptian. But when WHEN WHEN WHEN
[1:20:56] OPPOSITION CAME, he ran. Right?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; But the difference WAS WHEN HE MET GOD
[1:21:02] FACE TO FACE
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; AND NOW IT WAS NO MORE JUST A KNOWLEDGE
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; but it was revealed
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; a revelation. He saw his part. HE SAW
[1:21:12] GOD UNFOLDING HIMSELF WHEN HE WENT BACK
[1:21:15] DOWN TO EGYPT. AND THE BROTHER, YOU KNOW
[1:21:16] HOW BROTHER BRAMBLE DRAMATIZED IT, A
[1:21:18] ONE-MAN INVASION.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T WALKING DOWN THERE WITH AN
[1:21:22] ARMY BEHIND HIM.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; HE WAS GOING DOWN THERE NOW. HE HAD A
[1:21:26] WIFE. HE HAD YOUNGANS.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, FRIENDS. YOU SEE, LISTEN, JUST
[1:21:32] EVEN IN THAT, WE COULD JUST PREACH A
[1:21:34] FAMILY SERVICE. LET ME TELL YOU
[1:21:36] SOMETHING. GOD DOES NOT GOD DOES NOT
[1:21:38] JUST HAVE LIVING A VICTORY LIFE WHEN
[1:21:41] YOU'RE SINGLE.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD'S CALLED YOU EVEN IN YOUR
[1:21:44] SINGLENESS TO MAKE READY FOR WHEN THAT
[1:21:46] MOMENT COMES IN MARRIAGE. AND THEN EVEN
[1:21:49] IN MARRIAGE, GOD IS PREPARING YOUR LIFE
[1:21:51] ALL ALONG BECAUSE IT ALL IS CHRIST BEING
[1:21:55] EXPRESSED. YES.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD WORKING.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; There's understandings that I have about
[1:22:07] God's word that not just since I got
[1:22:10] married, but even as I've continued on,
[1:22:12] there's understanding that I have
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; since I've had not only the children,
[1:22:17] but continuing to work with them,
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; continuing.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; It's an understanding. And you see, you
[1:22:25] see within it, God is working through
[1:22:27] all of those areas and all of those
[1:22:29] channels. It's not let me hurry up and
[1:22:31] get this out of the way so I can get on
[1:22:32] and serve God. We are serving God
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; when I'm sitting down with my children.
[1:22:35] I'm serving God.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; I'm serving God just as much as when I'm
[1:22:39] sitting in front of my computer or I'm
[1:22:40] listening to a message. I'm serving God.
[1:22:42] Now, if my serving my children crowds
[1:22:44] out the other things, then I've got the
[1:22:46] wrong balance.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because I really
[1:22:49] can't serve them unless God's got first
[1:22:51] priority. Because who's the source of
[1:22:53] influence? Paul said, "Follow me as I
[1:22:55] follow Christ, not follow me as I follow
[1:22:57] me."
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU SEE, CHRIST MUST BE THE SOURCE
[1:23:02] OF INFLUENCE.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:04] So now we find that in in in in in in
[1:23:08] the time even that where we are at even
[1:23:11] in this moment. I just want to refer to
[1:23:14] a few places in scripture where Paul
[1:23:17] picks up in Timothy of the condition
[1:23:19] that would exist where where where
[1:23:23] individuals lives would have a form of
[1:23:26] godliness
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; but deny the power. In other words,
[1:23:32] they want
[1:23:34] all of this. They want the resemblance.
[1:23:39] They want the intellect. They want the
[1:23:42] knowledge,
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; but they don't want the life.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; It's a form of godliness. So when you
[1:23:51] have a form of godliness, you can have
[1:23:53] on the outside even things that look
[1:23:56] exactly right, but on the inside it's
[1:23:59] empty.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; It's a dark cavern, a deep place THAT'S
[1:24:04] WHAT DOING WHAT? IT'S CRYING OUT. LIKE
[1:24:06] LOOK, THE PROPHET PICKS THIS UP AND THE
[1:24:08] LADY WILL SEE AN age and he says in this
[1:24:10] age that promises such success and yet
[1:24:14] he say yet he says we're living in the
[1:24:16] age THAT IS MORE NEUROTIC
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; THAN ANY OTHER AGE.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; AN AGE HE SAID WHERE PEOPLE take a pill
[1:24:23] TO GO TO BED AND A PILL TO GET UP.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; AN AGE THAT'S PROMISED SUCH SUCCESS. HE
[1:24:28] SAID AND YET LIVES ARE FILLED WITH
[1:24:31] DARKNESS.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; IT'S A CRY. YOU KNOW WHAT THE CRY IS
[1:24:35] FOR? LEADERSHIP.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID IN THE
[1:24:39] MESSAGE SHALOM AS WELL AS COME FOLLOW ME
[1:24:41] TO THE GRADUATES. HE SAID LOOK YOU YOUNG
[1:24:44] PEOPLE. HE SAID YOU'RE PRIVILEGED TO BE
[1:24:46] RAISED AND TAUGHT IN THE HOME THAT
[1:24:48] YOU'RE IN.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; HE SAID SOME OF THESE OTHER YOUNG
[1:24:51] PEOPLE, HE SAID THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE
[1:24:53] YOUNG PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU. HE SAID AND
[1:24:56] YET THEY'RE OUT DOING THE THINGS THEY'RE
[1:24:58] DOING. HE SAID BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT BEEN
[1:25:01] TAUGHT ANY DIFFERENT. HE SAID YOU HAVE
[1:25:04] TO WATCH WHO THE LEADER IS AND WHAT THE
[1:25:07] LEADER IS TELLING THEM. HE SAID THE EVEN
[1:25:10] WHERE THE WORLD BECOMES A MIXTURE IN THE
[1:25:13] CHURCH.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN THE WORLD GET IN THE CHURCH WHEN
[1:25:16] THE HOLY GHOST IS NO LONGER THERE AND
[1:25:19] THE WORD IS NOT PREACHED? THEN IT
[1:25:21] INVITES THE DARKNESS OF DEVILS TO COME
[1:25:24] IN.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IN OUR HOMES, THAT'S WHY THE
[1:25:28] TOKEN HAS GOT TO BE APPLIED. THE TOKEN
[1:25:31] MUST BE ON DISPLAY IN OUR LIVES
[1:25:34] PERSONALLY.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF NOT, IT COULD BECOME WE CAN
[1:25:41] HAVE all the right things. You can have
[1:25:43] the right pictures. You can have the
[1:25:44] right sayings,
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN QUOTE THE RIGHT THINGS.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'VE GOT IT'S GOT TO BE LIFE ON
[1:25:55] THE INSIDE. That's right.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; And every one of us, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN
[1:25:58] TELL YOU'VE BEEN AROUND PEOPLE THAT are
[1:26:00] miserable.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about how they look
[1:26:02] right here. They can have a they can
[1:26:04] have a smile that's bigger than Bozo THE
[1:26:05] CLOWN,
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; BUT INSIDE they're miserable.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? IT'S A CALL FOR LIFE.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; God spoke of this in his word in first
[1:26:16] in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2. Even this
[1:26:19] is one other place. The mystery of
[1:26:21] iniquity does already work. What's
[1:26:23] iniquity? It's knowing what is right
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; but refusing to do it. Remember how
[1:26:28] brother Brown tells us and how can
[1:26:30] overcome remember the place remember he
[1:26:32] walked over that log that was laying in
[1:26:33] the water
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; he jumped on it and a chunk of it fell
[1:26:36] off and he says that's the problem with
[1:26:38] Christians they've been laying in sin so
[1:26:41] long till they become dirty
[1:26:45] things just fall off chips just things
[1:26:47] just fall off it because you see that
[1:26:49] tree that tree weren't made to lay in
[1:26:51] the water the tree was made to be
[1:26:52] planted
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; right
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; are you with me now this is why brother
[1:26:57] Bram says in token and how can overcome.
[1:26:59] He says just to be around it is to make
[1:27:02] yourself worse.
[1:27:04] I want let me just touch that a little
[1:27:05] bit to be around it. I thought we want I
[1:27:07] thought we want to be around life. We
[1:27:09] got to be around the source of life. But
[1:27:11] it depends on your attitude towards the
[1:27:14] source of life.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; If your attitude towards the source of
[1:27:18] life becomes dismissive, then it's
[1:27:21] really destructive. It depends on how we
[1:27:24] look at it there. Well, you know, that's
[1:27:26] not really that important. and that's
[1:27:27] just not really, you know, I, you know,
[1:27:29] I I just think that's a little bit
[1:27:30] overboard. I think that's a little
[1:27:32] extreme. Or I I think this and it
[1:27:33] becomes TO WHERE WE KNOW OR IT CAN BE WE
[1:27:36] KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT AND GOD, I'M REALLY
[1:27:38] GOING TO DO IT. I I'M REALLY GOING TO
[1:27:40] TRY. BUT LISTEN, WHAT GOD'S WANTING IS A
[1:27:43] SURRENDER,
[1:27:45] not human efforts.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; It's surrender. That's what that's all
[1:27:51] that God asks for is Lord, I surrender.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; I submit Lord
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; I submit. This is why the scripture
[1:27:57] says, "And because they would not
[1:28:00] receive the love of the truth that they
[1:28:02] might be saved." What's the what's the
[1:28:05] love of the truth? It's the Holy Spirit.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; It's God tabernacling inside of you.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Now, the scriptures in between there.
[1:28:14] What would give them even an inclination
[1:28:17] to resist it? Because of signs and
[1:28:20] wonders. That's what that passage is.
[1:28:22] Even in between where people have
[1:28:24] resisted, what God wants to do is dwell
[1:28:28] on the inside.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose is to
[1:28:31] tabernacle
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; inside of man. God just doesn't want to
[1:28:35] anoint our flesh, anoint our spirit to
[1:28:38] where we can many exploits. That's not
[1:28:41] that's not the objective. God wants to
[1:28:43] live inside of our life. And that's the
[1:28:45] greatest exploit is when he takes a life
[1:28:48] and changes that life from death unto
[1:28:50] life. He changes the very desire. He
[1:28:53] changes the very nature of THAT LIFE AND
[1:28:55] THAT LIFE BECOMES A DISPLAY of the glory
[1:28:58] of God.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Paul would go on and speak about it in
[1:29:03] Hebrews 10 on how that you know they
[1:29:05] they received the you know will sinning
[1:29:09] willfully after receiving the knowledge
[1:29:10] of the truth because it just really
[1:29:12] become dismissive. The knowledge of the
[1:29:14] truth is become is to become face to
[1:29:16] face with it but it's a knowledge of it.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:21] And like the man who was gathering
[1:29:23] sticks in the time of the Sabbath there
[1:29:25] in the book of Numbers, that man knew
[1:29:27] that it was wrong to do what he was
[1:29:29] doing. You could read this, I think it's
[1:29:31] numbers 15, 16, 17. The man knew, he
[1:29:34] knew what was wrong. He went ahead and
[1:29:35] did it anyhow. And when he went ahead
[1:29:37] and did it anyhow, they put him in
[1:29:39] stocks and said, "What should we do to
[1:29:41] him?" Moses said, "Let's wait on God."
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; What happened is that man was stoned
[1:29:45] because he knew better than what he was
[1:29:49] doing. YES,
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; HE HAD KNOWLEDGE OF IT.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT'S WRONG. YOU SEE, THIS IS
[1:29:54] WHERE IT COMES IN to where even when we
[1:29:56] have knowledge OF THINGS AND SAY, "GOD,
[1:29:59] REVEAL IT TO ME, LORD. Reveal it to me,
[1:30:02] Lord Jesus."
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. God,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; because remember the prophet said many,
[1:30:08] he said, "Those that will be crying for
[1:30:10] the rocks to fall on them." That's what
[1:30:12] he said in the sixth seal. Those that
[1:30:13] will be crying for rocks to fall on them
[1:30:15] will be many that sat in these meetings
[1:30:17] and had heard the word preached to them.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; It's very important. I'm not trying to
[1:30:23] scare you. I'm I'm just delivering a
[1:30:24] word to understand the divine revelation
[1:30:27] how important revelation is.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE KNOWLEDGE will never put life
[1:30:32] into you.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; KNOWLEDGE CAN MAKE YOU A GOOD DEBATER.
[1:30:36] RIGHT?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; IT CAN MAKE YOU A GOOD OUTSIDE MESSAGE.
[1:30:40] BUT THE MESSAGE IS NOT AN OUTSIDE
[1:30:42] CONFORMITY. IT'S THE POWER OF
[1:30:44] TRANSFORMATION THAT MAKES YOU A SWEET,
[1:30:47] TENDER, FLEXIBLE BELIEVER WITH CHRIST
[1:30:51] EXPRESSING HIMSELF THROUGH YOUR LIFE.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; That's what this Holy Ghost does.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; This is where they came. Remember, even
[1:30:58] in the days of the Lord Jesus where they
[1:31:01] came to a place and they said, "We're
[1:31:03] not have this man reign over us. We do
[1:31:05] not we don't want him reigning over us.
[1:31:08] That's that's how that that with within
[1:31:10] it even how the church world came and
[1:31:14] they can COME TO A CERTAIN place that
[1:31:16] even brother Bram says they appreciate
[1:31:17] the Holy Ghost but they don't WANT HIM
[1:31:19] REIGNING.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T WANT him reigning IN THEIR
[1:31:23] LIVES.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T WANT HIM CHANGING THE THINGS
[1:31:27] within their lives
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE MAN IS BUILT to worship.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's going to worship
[1:31:34] something.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; He'll worship his job, may worship his
[1:31:37] wife, may worship may she may worship
[1:31:39] her husband, WORSHIP CHILDREN. WHERE MAN
[1:31:42] IS BUILT TO WORSHIP.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; EVEN THE ATHEIST IS A WORSHSHIPER.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; HE WORSHIPS HIS OWN THEORIES.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY WORSHIP? YEAH. HE GIVES HIMSELF
[1:31:54] TO HIM.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; MAN IS BUILT TO WORSHIP. AND THIS IS WHY
[1:32:02] THAT SATAN, HE KNOWS THAT.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; AND SATAN IS ALWAYS IF HE CAN JUST GET
[1:32:08] SOMETHING A LITTLE OFF TRACK.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL HE WANTS TO DO. GET IT A
[1:32:13] LITTLE OFF TRACK AND THEN HE GETS HEADED
[1:32:15] TOWARDS THE WRONG WAY. SO THIS IS WHY
[1:32:17] WHEN JESUS SAID, "I AM THE WAY, THE
[1:32:20] TRUTH, AND THE LIFE." IT'S VERY, VERY
[1:32:23] IMPORTANT TO SAY, "GOD, AS YOU TOLD
[1:32:25] DAVID YOU WOULD REVEAL UNTO ME THE PATH
[1:32:27] OF LIFE, THEN LORD, THAT'S A PROMISE for
[1:32:29] me."
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:32] Now just listen to this just for a
[1:32:34] little bit.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; It's out of God's wrap gift.
[1:32:37] Brother Bram says now the reason they
[1:32:40] don't want to accept this wrap package,
[1:32:42] they know what's on the inside of it.
[1:32:44] Key is they know and they don't want it.
[1:32:48] That's the reasons in the church and
[1:32:49] people today and the governments in the
[1:32:51] land will not receive God's Christmas
[1:32:53] present is because they know what's in
[1:32:55] it. They don't want it. It'll make women
[1:32:58] act different. It'll make men act
[1:33:00] different. You'll have to bear the name
[1:33:01] of a fanatic. You'll have to take the
[1:33:03] way with the Lord's despised few. You'll
[1:33:05] have to clean up your life. You'll have
[1:33:06] to quit your meanness. You'll have to
[1:33:08] stop your doing wrong, cheating,
[1:33:09] stealing, lying, committing adultery.
[1:33:11] You'll have to STOP ALL THESE THINGS.
[1:33:12] And the people don't want it. Although
[1:33:15] they may know
[1:33:18] it's right,
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; but they don't want it because it brings
[1:33:22] too much truth to them.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Because the light exposes.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. That's right.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; IT UNCOVERS THEIR SIN. They don't want
[1:33:33] it. THEY DON'T WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH
[1:33:34] IT. They keep AWAY FROM IT. AND THAT'S
[1:33:36] THE WAY IT IS TODAY. THEY KNOW WHAT WAS
[1:33:38] WRAPPED in it. And that's why they set
[1:33:40] away with it. They don't want it. Same
[1:33:42] thing today. They don't want the Holy
[1:33:44] Ghost today is because they know what's
[1:33:47] wrapped in it. They can watch a person
[1:33:49] receive the Holy Ghost and stand out
[1:33:51] there and see that woman maybe as low as
[1:33:53] she could be till even the dogs will
[1:33:54] hardly look at her and see that woman
[1:33:56] come up from the altar, a new person to
[1:33:58] see that woman clean up her life and get
[1:34:00] out and act like a lady. See the one
[1:34:02] that runs to bridge parties, smoke four
[1:34:04] or five packs of cigarettes a day, hang
[1:34:06] around the saloons like a regular
[1:34:07] barfly. And they know if they ever
[1:34:11] accept this gift of God, it's wrapped in
[1:34:13] the package called Jesus Christ. It'll
[1:34:16] spoil every bit of their worldly funds
[1:34:19] cuz he won't stand for it.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; It does something to them. It changes
[1:34:24] people. But people don't want to be
[1:34:26] changed.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; They know that's not revelation. They
[1:34:31] know.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; You see, just knowing that life still on
[1:34:36] the inside, the love for the world
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; is still there. It's not to a place of
[1:34:43] dying out because there's got to be a
[1:34:44] dying out
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; before he'll come.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a dying out. Sometimes
[1:34:52] that dying, it's a slow process
[1:34:54] sometimes,
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; It's a slow process.
[1:34:58] But the thing of it is is that our
[1:35:00] prayer is is God, may it be that that's
[1:35:02] leading to death that new life might
[1:35:04] come.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Right. So now, like brother Bram, he
[1:35:08] goes into that like with Legion. And he
[1:35:09] said, "You know those people down in
[1:35:11] Gadra, they wanted to be left alone.
[1:35:14] They told Jesus, "Get out of here."
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; You know what THEY WANT? BROTHER RAM
[1:35:18] said they were more comfortable with
[1:35:20] devils.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE THING. SOMETIMES
[1:35:24] INDIVIDUALS HAVE BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH
[1:35:26] DEVILS.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT DEVILS THAT HAVE
[1:35:29] TORMENTED FAMILIES.
[1:35:31] AND IT'S BEEN LIKE CYCLES THAT CAN RUN
[1:35:33] IN A FAMILY. IT'LL KEEP IT IN PLACE. LET
[1:35:35] IT GO OUT HERE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
[1:35:37] BOOM, right back in the same thing. let
[1:35:39] it go out here and boom, RIGHT BACK IN
[1:35:40] THE SAME THING. IT IS A DEVIL, NOT THE
[1:35:43] INDIVIDUAL, NOT THE FAMILY, BUT TO
[1:35:46] UNDERSTAND THERE'S GOT TO BE ONE WHO'S
[1:35:49] STRONGER THAN THAT SPIRIT TO CAST THAT
[1:35:52] SPIRIT OUT.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BROTHER RAM SAYS THE MAN THAT
[1:35:55] WANTS TO GET SAVED, HE'LL COME TO THE
[1:35:57] ALTAR AND HE SAID, AND THEN HE'LL BE
[1:35:59] BACK THERE THE SAME THE SAME THING AGAIN
[1:36:01] TOMORROW NIGHT. HE SAID, "WHAT IT IS,
[1:36:03] IT'S A SPIRIT KEEPING THAT PERSON FROM
[1:36:06] ACCEPTING WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY DONE FOR
[1:36:09] HIM."
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; AND THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL IS TO
[1:36:13] CHALLENGE THAT DEVIL.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU SEE WHY the devil wants to
[1:36:16] keep you from the house of God?
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Come on now. HE CAN LET YOU STREAM AT
[1:36:20] HOME AND YOU GET A YOU GET A NOTION TO
[1:36:22] GO GET YOUR SWEET TEA, SAT DOWN IN THE
[1:36:24] CHAIR. I KNOW GOD CAN REACH RIGHT WHERE
[1:36:26] PEOPLE ARE AT. I BELIEVE IN THAT. BUT
[1:36:28] LISTEN, FRIENDS, THE BIBLE SAID, "DON'T
[1:36:29] FORSAKE TO ASSEMBLE OURSELVES TOGETHER."
[1:36:31] IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS WE COME IN HERE
[1:36:34] THAT WE'RE NOT JUST HERE JUST FOR
[1:36:36] OURSELVES. WE'RE HERE TO CREATE AN
[1:36:38] ATMOSPHERE. WHEN WE COME TO THE HOUSE OF
[1:36:40] GOD, THIS IS WAR.
[1:36:44] THIS IS WAR. THIS IS WHERE DEVILS ARE
[1:36:47] CONFRONTED IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; DEVILS ARE PUT ON NOTICE. YOU CAN'T HAVE
[1:36:52] THEM. THEY'RE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:36:56] DEVILS ARE CAST OUT BY THE PREACHING OF
[1:36:58] THE WORD. DEVILS ARE CAST OUT BY THE
[1:37:01] LAYING ON OF HANDS.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; It's spiritual warfare.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN HAVE YOUR THOUGHTS CHANGED TODAY
[1:37:07] AND THEY'LL BE RIGHT BACK WHERE THEY ARE
[1:37:08] TOMORROW. IT'S MORE THAN CHANGING YOUR
[1:37:10] THOUGHT. THE HOLY GHOST IS NOT A GOOD
[1:37:12] THOUGHT AND THE DEVIL A BAD THOUGHT.
[1:37:14] THEY ARE REAL.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; LEGION, he wanted help.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; And that one I like how brother Ram said
[1:37:27] it. One soul cried out and Jesus crossed
[1:37:31] the sea to get to him.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; I tell you right HERE THIS MORNING, ONE
[1:37:35] CALL, GOD WILL CROSS WHATEVER'S in the
[1:37:37] way.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; IT MIGHT BE A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES OF
[1:37:40] LIFE, BUT THERE IS NOTHING THAT WILL
[1:37:42] KEEP BACK GOD FROM COMING TO ONE OF HIS
[1:37:45] CHILDREN TO SAY, "LORD, I NEED HELP.
[1:37:47] LORD,
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; the Bible says in John in John 14:17,
[1:38:00] even the spirit of truth, whom the world
[1:38:02] cannot receive, because it seeth him
[1:38:04] not, neither knoweth him, but you know
[1:38:06] him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall
[1:38:09] be in you. Brother Ram will always take
[1:38:12] will take that scripture because the
[1:38:14] world cannot receive because it seeth
[1:38:17] him not.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Who do men say that I am? Good teaching
[1:38:21] subject to be lived by. The world cannot
[1:38:24] see him.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram will take that in the
[1:38:27] message the comforter and says as long
[1:38:29] as you love the world, in other words, a
[1:38:31] person is content right where they're
[1:38:33] at.
[1:38:35] They're they're content. They love the
[1:38:37] world and they're content. You have to
[1:38:40] get to a place to where you're sick of
[1:38:41] it.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing. And you know
[1:38:44] what? God knows how to bring a life to
[1:38:47] that place.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; That's why I pray for him many times.
[1:38:50] Take peace from them, GOD.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. GOD, REVEAL YOURSELF, LORD.
[1:38:54] JUST LET GET THEM TO A PLACE THAT WHERE
[1:38:56] ALL THEY CAN DO IS LOOK UP AND SEE YOU,
[1:38:58] BROTHER SAMUEL. YOU OUGHT NOT PRAY THAT
[1:38:59] WAY. I'M PRAYING FOR A SOUL, NOT FOR
[1:39:01] NATURAL PROSPERITY.
[1:39:04] I'M HERE TO MINISTER FOR SOULS AND LIVES
[1:39:06] AND TO KNOW WHAT GOD DID FOR ME. HE'S NO
[1:39:09] RESPECTOR OF PERSON. HE'LL DO FOR YOU
[1:39:11] JUST THE SAME.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETIMES GOD'S GOT TO GET THAT SEED
[1:39:15] TO ROT AND BREAK DOWN. BUT IN ORDER FOR
[1:39:18] the seed to rot, it's got to be in the
[1:39:20] right water. Right.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; When we put seeds, I could have them in
[1:39:24] packets when I was in the classroom. But
[1:39:26] as soon as I took those seeds, I could
[1:39:28] take them in a wet paper towel and I
[1:39:30] soaked that paper towel and I put them
[1:39:32] seeds inside of that wet paper towel. I
[1:39:34] could come back within two days, the
[1:39:35] seeds had already started to sprout. You
[1:39:37] know why? Because the water had been
[1:39:39] trapped around that seed and it broke
[1:39:42] that old seed coat away. AND WHEN THAT
[1:39:44] SEED COAT GOT BROKE AWAY, WHAT WAS
[1:39:46] INSIDE THAT little kidney bean, a germ
[1:39:48] that was on the inside, it began to poke
[1:39:50] ITSELF OUT. THIS IS WHY THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:39:54] moving right around in THE SERVICE AND
[1:39:56] PRAYING, "OH GOD, LET THE SPIRIT OF GOD,
[1:39:58] LET IT SO TOUCH THEIR LIVES AND LET THE
[1:40:00] WORD OF GOD, LORD, DON'T LET THEM WHEN
[1:40:02] THEY LEAVE OUT OF HERE, MAY IT JUST
[1:40:03] VISIT THEM ON THEIR PILLOW, LORD GOD,
[1:40:05] MAY IT BE WAVE AFTER WAVE, LORD GOD,
[1:40:07] BRING SUCH CONVICTION TO THEIR HEARTS
[1:40:09] AND THEIR LIVES UNTIL IT'S A COMPLETE
[1:40:11] surrender and submission."
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] Or would you rather have a kind old
[1:40:22] priest,
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; somebody pat you on the back? I'm not
[1:40:26] talking about BEING HARD. I'M NOT
[1:40:27] TALKING ABOUT BEING MEAN. BUT THE GOSPEL
[1:40:29] IS IS STRAIGHT, FRIENDS. WE'RE NOT HERE
[1:40:31] PLAYING GAMES.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; OUR SOUL IS AT STAKE.
[1:40:35] THERE'S THINGS THAT EVEN AS PARENTS THAT
[1:40:37] HAVE CHILDREN THAT YOU'VE GOT TO COME TO
[1:40:39] A PLACE AND SAY, "MY KIDS ARE NOT GOING
[1:40:41] TO GO THE SAME WAY I WENT."
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT INTO EGYPT.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; NO, SIR. IF WE COME OUT OF EGYPT, OUR
[1:40:51] KIDS DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK DOWN TO
[1:40:52] EGYPT.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; COME ON, FRIENDS. IT'S SAY, "GOD, LET IT
[1:40:57] BE SO REAL. LET JOSHUA BE SO REAL IN MY
[1:41:01] LIFE, LORD." AMEN.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LET ME tell you, just to be
[1:41:05] raised in a good message home, it's
[1:41:07] going to take more than that.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; But that is a real powerful thing.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; And when I'm talking about being raised
[1:41:14] in a message home, I'm not I'm not
[1:41:16] talking about we're just as reciting
[1:41:18] things and it's just dry dead religion.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT A LIFE THAT'S LIVED
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; WHERE THERE'S A LIFE THERE'S NO TELLING.
[1:41:28] THERE'S NO QUESTION WHO MOM AND DADDY
[1:41:30] have first in their life.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Even when you're offended at church, who
[1:41:35] you got first in your life,
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; it'll come out.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; It'll come out.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; See, this is why that revelation, it
[1:41:44] will it will supersede. It will
[1:41:46] overpower. It will overthrow because you
[1:41:48] know why that revelation is not
[1:41:50] something that is of man, but it comes
[1:41:52] straight from the throne of God.
[1:41:54] So you know when we think of this you
[1:41:57] know the reason they don't want
[1:42:00] the Holy Ghost they see it now that
[1:42:03] quote I just read to you brother says
[1:42:04] they see it they see what it does
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; right
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; but they say I don't want that I don't
[1:42:09] want to change my associates I don't
[1:42:11] want I don't want to stop that
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; I don't want to lay that down I don't
[1:42:16] want I don't want to quit that what it
[1:42:18] is listen now this is very important and
[1:42:21] this is even how that you go about and
[1:42:23] you pray even for your loved ones. It's
[1:42:25] because they have their own thoughts on
[1:42:30] what the Holy Ghost is.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; They're thinking that the Holy Ghost is
[1:42:35] another person coming in and living with
[1:42:38] the person that's already there.
[1:42:41] God don't cohabitate.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; That'd be miserable. Can you imagine
[1:42:45] somebody coming in your house, Brother
[1:42:47] Carlos, and they don't like what you
[1:42:49] like on Mondays and Tuesdays?
[1:42:52] They don't like their bisay with fries.
[1:42:56] They tell Sister Irma, I like my bisay
[1:43:00] with potatoes. I like them mashed.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; I think right now you'd be showing them
[1:43:06] the door. I know you well enough. You'd
[1:43:08] be telling Show them the door. This is
[1:43:09] my house.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; See, that's Listen to me. Until that
[1:43:13] first nature, until it gets to that
[1:43:15] place where a person is absolutely tired
[1:43:17] of it, that's how they look at the Holy
[1:43:19] Ghost. I don't want nothing coming into
[1:43:22] my house and telling me what I can do.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; They know what the Holy Ghost is, but
[1:43:28] it's not been revealed. Because when
[1:43:30] it's revealed, you see him to be full of
[1:43:32] glory,
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; peace, your satisfaction. You find him
[1:43:36] to be all THAT YOU EVER EVER LONG FOR.
[1:43:39] HE'S EVERYTHING.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; HE'S BEYOND WHAT YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER SAM, HOW CAN YOU SAY
[1:43:46] THAT?" BECAUSE THAT WAS ONCE ME. THAT'S
[1:43:48] WHAT ONE'S EYE IS SITTING IN A MESSAGE
[1:43:50] VIEW. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT IT was
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; because until God reveals it to you.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; You think it's just about it's it
[1:43:59] basically it's just religion. It's what
[1:44:00] you can do and how you can live and you
[1:44:02] look kind of get to look at it like I
[1:44:03] can't live this. And you know what?
[1:44:05] Nobody can live it. That's why it takes
[1:44:06] that's why it takes to present ourselves
[1:44:08] IN OUR RIGHT MIND BEFORE THE LIVING GOD
[1:44:11] AND SAY GOD I SURRENDER.
[1:44:14] AND THEN HE COMES AND TAKES CONTROL AND
[1:44:16] THEN HE LIVES HIS OWN LIFE THROUGH you
[1:44:20] and me.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; And this is why that you know it has to
[1:44:25] come to that place of because Satan will
[1:44:28] try to anoint that first nature.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; He'll try to do that. You know even when
[1:44:33] God is leading a life down a pathway of
[1:44:35] surrender, he'll come and try to anoint
[1:44:37] that first. What are your friends going
[1:44:38] to say?
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; What are your associates? How you going
[1:44:40] to explain this?
[1:44:42] Right?
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; If I'm not mistaken, you already made
[1:44:45] some professions like this before, but
[1:44:47] you've backtracked.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do now?
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; You know, they're going to laugh at you.
[1:44:52] They're going to laugh at you anyhow.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to reason you into it,
[1:44:58] but I'm just trying TO SAY IN HELL, HELL
[1:45:01] THERE IS NO FRIENDS.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE TELLS US IN THE BOOK OF JOB,
[1:45:05] HELL IS NAKED.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; There is no covering. There is no
[1:45:10] escape. AND THERE ARE NO BUDDIES. THERE
[1:45:12] are no friends. THERE ARE NO HANGOUTS.
[1:45:14] There are no associations. It's Lord
[1:45:16] Jesus. How did I get here?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Let's say I don't think we need to
[1:45:21] preach about hell. I think I think we do
[1:45:23] cuz hell's a real place.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; The prophet took me multiple messages
[1:45:27] souls in prison. NOW YOU LISTEN, YOU'RE
[1:45:29] NOT going to scare the bride into
[1:45:31] position.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; But let me just TELL YOU, JUST AS MUCH
[1:45:34] AS HEAVEN IS A REAL PLACE, HELL IS A
[1:45:36] REAL PLACE.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME? IT'S ANOTHER DIMENSION.
[1:45:40] IT'S A REAL PLACE.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAID HE HE SAID, "I BELIEVE
[1:45:44] YOU." SAID, "I'VE BEEN in both."
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; And then he saw the influences of what
[1:45:50] he saw in hell walk off of that
[1:45:52] escalator in in JC Penney.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; And one of the things he saw, he saw
[1:45:56] those women painted up down there and he
[1:45:58] saw them come right out of that
[1:45:59] escalator. He said, "Oh, dear God, I'm
[1:46:00] back in hell again."
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; It was what was there.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; It was what was there.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Now listen now. Think about this.
[1:46:10] Tell them I said hello whoever that is.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; I want you to want to think about this.
[1:46:16] You know when they when they've rejected
[1:46:19] God, when you reject right, you have to
[1:46:21] take wrong. When they refuse the Holy
[1:46:24] Ghost, they refuse God's program, they
[1:46:27] refuse everything. And let me just say
[1:46:28] it like this. I'm friends. I'm I'll just
[1:46:31] I'll stay with this. I'll stay with I'll
[1:46:33] give you a quote. Brother Bram said,
[1:46:34] "Everything that helps is of God."
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:46:39] But I'm going to say this THAT BECAUSE
[1:46:42] of the church world and where they have
[1:46:44] got to of self-help
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; and have this GROUP WE'RE GOING TO TEACH
[1:46:51] we're going to teach men on how to do
[1:46:53] this and how to over YOU'RE NEVER
[1:46:56] SELFHELP WILL NEVER DO IT.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; NOW LISTEN THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT
[1:47:03] CAN BE POINTED OUT THAT ARE TRUTHS IN
[1:47:05] GOD'S WORD.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; All right. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT
[1:47:09] CAN BE POINTED OUT FROM THE BOOK OF
[1:47:10] PROVERBS AND GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN. BUT
[1:47:13] IT MUST BE BY THE HOLY GHOST IN our
[1:47:16] life.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT GOING TO BE MIND OVER MATTER
[1:47:19] BECAUSE THE NEW BIRTH IS NOT MIND OVER
[1:47:22] MATTER. THE PROPHET TELLS US THAT NEW
[1:47:24] BIRTH IT IS NOT SCHOOLED INTO YOU,
[1:47:27] TAUGHT INTO YOU, DRILLED INTO YOU. IT IS
[1:47:31] A SOVEREIGN WORK OF THE Holy Spirit
[1:47:35] between you and God.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:38] That's the truth.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; So, it's not knowing well I I I know
[1:47:43] enough of the message. I know enough.
[1:47:45] You know,
[1:47:49] sometimes
[1:47:51] that's what's happened is people have
[1:47:53] become filled with knowledge. You can't
[1:47:56] tell them nothing. You can't lead them.
[1:47:58] They can't they they won't they they'll
[1:48:00] shut down God's voice.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; You know why? They've taken their
[1:48:04] knowledge and their understanding of
[1:48:06] quotes and scriptures and they are their
[1:48:10] own shepherds.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; When you reject the the voice of God,
[1:48:16] you're going to give heed to some voice.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; This is this is this ISN'T ABOUT THIS
[1:48:22] AIN'T ABOUT BROTHER SAMUEL. IT'S ABOUT
[1:48:24] GOD.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT GOD. YOU YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:48:27] FOLLOW SOMEBODY.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; You're going to follow somebody. Now, I
[1:48:30] want YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS. THIS IS
[1:48:32] WHY LIKE BROTHER BRANDON SAYS MANY many
[1:48:34] are still claiming to be Pentecostal
[1:48:36] because they belong to a Pentecostal
[1:48:37] church. And brother BRANDON SAYS THAT
[1:48:40] DON'T make no more a s a horse than to
[1:48:42] live in a barn. Don't you appreciate
[1:48:44] those real simple vernaculars?
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; I mean, you know, now I know I know in
[1:48:49] today's culture, you know, if you live
[1:48:50] in a barn, well, you feel like you're a
[1:48:52] chicken, you'll go live in a barn.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; You know, what are you today? I don't
[1:48:55] know. You know, like I heard one brother
[1:48:58] kind of cutting around. And he said they
[1:49:00] were offering the women to get on the
[1:49:01] plane first. So I just said today I feel
[1:49:02] like a woman.
[1:49:10] He was just messing around. But you know
[1:49:13] you know the whole thing about it is is
[1:49:14] that being just being somewhere don't
[1:49:17] make you what you are.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; And this is why that even within this
[1:49:21] that he says no more it don't make a
[1:49:24] Christian belonging to this church or
[1:49:25] that church. HE'S STILL A SINNER UNTIL
[1:49:27] he's converted. And when HE'S CONVERTED,
[1:49:29] HE'S BORN AGAIN AND CHANGED OVER AND THE
[1:49:31] HOLY Ghost has come in and made him a
[1:49:34] new creation.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; You understand? THIS IS WHY JUST BEING
[1:49:39] AROUND THE MESSAGE IS NOT ENOUGH.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WE SAY, "OH, BROTHER SAMUEL,
[1:49:43] THAT'S SIMPLE. WE KNOW THAT." BUT I
[1:49:45] REALLY wonder I LOOK AT THINGS EVEN AS
[1:49:48] I, YOU KNOW, UH, EXAMINE THAT IT CAN
[1:49:50] BECOME SOMETHING WHERE THE WE'RE WE'RE
[1:49:52] NOT IN THE FIRST GENERATION OF THE
[1:49:54] MESSAGE.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE IN NOW SECOND, THIRD, WE'RE
[1:49:58] ON DOWN
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; INTO A SECOND GENERATION WHERE IT IS
[1:50:02] WHERE IT IS IT CAN BECOME VERY MUCH SO
[1:50:04] JUST VIEWED AND LOOKED AT AS A AS A AS
[1:50:07] AS A WHOLE BANK OF truths
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; that we pledge allegiance to.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THAT
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; THE AMISH HAVE THAT.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; MUSLIMS HAVE THAT. IT MAY NOT BE THE
[1:50:21] TRUTH, BUT THEY HAVE A A BANK OR A A
[1:50:24] WHOLE GROUPING OF THINGS THAT THEY HOLD
[1:50:26] TO. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS MESSAGE CAME TO
[1:50:29] PRODUCE.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE CAME TO REVEAL CHRIST AND
[1:50:33] PUT CHRIST INSIDE OF YOU.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO PUT TWO AND
[1:50:39] TWO TOGETHER, BUT Christ in you has put
[1:50:43] you in the word together.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; And it's Christ revealing himself in you
[1:50:47] in humility, in simplicity.
[1:50:50] It's you Christ living his own life
[1:50:52] through your life.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Because remember Peter, he couldn't even
[1:50:57] read his name on a box car.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; He couldn't.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; But he knew God.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So divine revelation
[1:51:07] becoming that very source of life.
[1:51:11] When that's revealed to you, listen now.
[1:51:14] When something's revealed to you,
[1:51:17] that's where you begin to investigate
[1:51:20] it.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; That's where you can really look into
[1:51:23] it,
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; And then that's where you start to
[1:51:26] embrace it
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; when it's been revealed. Not what we
[1:51:29] know,
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; but when it's been revealed.
[1:51:33] It's kind of like when you think about
[1:51:36] it, like right up here, if I if I were
[1:51:40] to ask
[1:51:42] someone
[1:51:44] and ask you, I have something in my coat
[1:51:47] pocket right here. What do I have in my
[1:51:49] coat pocket?
[1:51:51] In my suit pocket. What do I have in
[1:51:53] here?
[1:51:57] Any thoughts?
[1:52:01] What' you say? Phone. Do you know that
[1:52:03] for sure? Nope.
[1:52:06] Could be. Anybody else? Oh, this is
[1:52:10] different, brother Samuel. That's all
[1:52:11] right.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Handkerchief.
[1:52:15] Well, it's close. That's where a lot of
[1:52:16] times when I carry it.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Cough drops.
[1:52:20] Pretty close.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Do you know that for sure?
[1:52:30] fisherman's friends.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Now it's not a guess.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Now you know I can put it back in here.
[1:52:38] And when I put it back in there and I
[1:52:40] ask you what's in here,
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; fisherman's friends, right?
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz it's been revealed.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; WHEN IT'S REVEALED, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
[1:52:49] ASKING FOR.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SEEKING FOR. IT'S
[1:52:52] BEEN REVEALED. THAT'S WHY REVELATION IS
[1:52:56] SO IMPORTANT. THAT'S WHY THAT MANY CAN
[1:53:00] JUST LOOK, LET'S JUST COME INTO CHURCH
[1:53:01] AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE A CHURCH AND
[1:53:03] I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE A GOOD PERSON AND
[1:53:05] AND IT'S NOT THAT.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT BEING A GOOD PERSON. IT'S OH
[1:53:09] GOD, REVEAL YOURSELF, LORD.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; It's not just a good bank of truth. It's
[1:53:16] not just a GOOD COLLECTION OF SERMONS.
[1:53:18] NO, REVEAL, LORD, WHO YOU ARE. Because
[1:53:22] once it's revealed, you know what you
[1:53:23] can do? I'll take one of them cough
[1:53:25] drops.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; You know what you're asking for. And you
[1:53:28] know what? When you ask, you got faith.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Nobody has to pump you UP AND SAY, "COME
[1:53:33] ON, let's get it going just right. We're
[1:53:34] going to get it run. WE'RE GOING TO GET
[1:53:35] MOVING JUST RIGHT." SO YOU CAN ASK when
[1:53:38] it's revealed. You could walk right up
[1:53:40] here and say, "I'll take one of them
[1:53:41] cough drops." You know why? Cuz I got a
[1:53:43] need on my throat.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS. THAT'S THE
[1:53:48] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE AND
[1:53:49] REVELATION.
[1:53:51] KNOWLEDGE, YOU DON'T REALLY SEE WHAT'S
[1:53:53] THERE.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU DO, YOU REALLY DON'T, I
[1:53:57] DON'T WANT THAT. BUT WHEN IT'S
[1:53:58] REVELATION, YOU SEE WHAT IT IS.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU SEE THAT BY REVELATION, YOU
[1:54:02] SAY, THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL. IT'LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
[1:54:08] THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL. IT'LL REARRANGE YOUR
[1:54:13] WARDROBE. IT'LL CHANGE YOUR FRIENDS.
[1:54:15] THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; IT'LL MAKE YOU A LIVING WITNESS. THAT'S
[1:54:20] WHAT I WANT.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be A CHURCH MEMBER. I
[1:54:24] DON'T WANT TO BE KNOWN JUST AS, "OH,
[1:54:26] YOU'RE A MESSAGE BELIEVER." NO, I WANT
[1:54:27] TO BE KNOWN AS A MESSAGE BELIEVER that's
[1:54:29] full of the spirit of God.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; A CHRISTIAN, A BELIEVER. WHAT GREATER
[1:54:34] compliment could we have?
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; That's when we see beyond knowledge.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; You never look at fisherman's friends
[1:54:45] the same way, will you?
[1:54:51] Can I have just a few more moments?
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; the only way, this is out of God's
[1:54:59] wrapped gift. The only way anybody in
[1:55:00] the world will ever know what's in that
[1:55:03] package, it has to be revealed to you.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; This the same message where Brother Ram
[1:55:08] says, he's just talking, I just quoted
[1:55:09] to you where he says, "They know what's
[1:55:11] in it. They know what's in it. They know
[1:55:14] what it'll make them do. They don't want
[1:55:16] that truth in their life that'll call
[1:55:18] everything out.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; But he says ever, the only way you ever
[1:55:23] know what's really in it, it's got to be
[1:55:25] revealed to you.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; You'll turn it down. You'll say it's
[1:55:28] fanaticism.
[1:55:29] But when you get the revelation, you'll
[1:55:32] seek for it.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; You'll open up and God will come in and
[1:55:36] suck with you and you with him when
[1:55:37] you're ready to open the door and let
[1:55:38] him in. You mean God's not showing up
[1:55:41] with a SWAT team? Nope. The Holy Ghost
[1:55:43] is not a SWAT team.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. Right?
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not somebody coming
[1:55:49] down to beat down the door. Nope. That's
[1:55:51] not what the Holy Ghost is. The Holy
[1:55:52] Ghost, what it is, is meldting our will
[1:55:56] down. And you know what? God knows just
[1:55:58] how to get every life into a place to
[1:56:00] say, "I'm tired of this."
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Even after the new
[1:56:05] birth has come, he still works in our
[1:56:07] life that way to bring things to light
[1:56:09] in our life and say, "Lord, I don't want
[1:56:11] to be what I'm seeing in the mirror no
[1:56:13] more.
[1:56:14] I want to see, Lord, I I want to see you
[1:56:16] in that area of my life. And he says,
[1:56:17] "That's just what I was wanting for you
[1:56:19] to say." And Lord, I I'm not HERE TO
[1:56:21] MAKE EXCUSES ABOUT IT. I'M JUST HERE TO
[1:56:23] SURRENDER MY WEAKNESS, LORD. COME PULL
[1:56:25] YOURSELF IN THROUGH THAT CHANNEL, LORD,
[1:56:27] AND REFLECT YOURSELF. It never stops
[1:56:31] surrendering.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, he says, "But one time you open up
[1:56:37] that heart, you'll never know what it is
[1:56:38] until it's revealed to you. But when
[1:56:39] it's revealed to you, then you'll go to
[1:56:41] hunting for it."
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. You know why? It's become the
[1:56:44] pearl of great price to you.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Everything else just gets thrown aside
[1:56:48] like this don't mean nothing. HANG
[1:56:49] HANGING ON TO WHY WAS I WHAT WAS I
[1:56:51] TRYING TO HANG ON TO THIS FOR? WHY WAS
[1:56:53] I?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; BUT it's when it's revealed.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Now, let me close up on this point here.
[1:57:04] I actually got two more points, but I
[1:57:06] want to close on this one. Remember
[1:57:08] Jesus would lay us in the scripture and
[1:57:10] he would say
[1:57:12] whosoever
[1:57:14] that you receive that I send in my name
[1:57:17] you've received me
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; multiple places in the scripture and he
[1:57:20] goes on receive a prophet in the name of
[1:57:22] a prophet receives a prophet's reward.
[1:57:24] Same same bank of scriptures. So within
[1:57:27] that, brother Brown tells us in spoken
[1:57:29] words original seed, he'll take that and
[1:57:31] he'll say the only way that we can serve
[1:57:32] God is by receiving the servants that he
[1:57:36] sends on earth.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; So God makes known his way and God
[1:57:41] reveals himself even through a messenger
[1:57:44] of the age and then God will come right
[1:57:45] through the the ministry that comes
[1:57:47] under that un under that under that um
[1:57:50] that that messenger and carrying that
[1:57:52] same message. But this is what's a very
[1:57:55] um a real concerning point even within
[1:57:59] this of when you think about Lot's wife.
[1:58:03] And when you look at Lot's wife,
[1:58:06] let me see. I thought I had I thought I
[1:58:08] had this here. Some of you are just
[1:58:10] like, "Oh my goodness."
[1:58:14] I think I thought I had it there. Jesus
[1:58:16] just says, "Remember Lot's wife."
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:58:19] And um I was just you know I'm just just
[1:58:22] meditating and how the Lord will just
[1:58:24] just bring things to you when as I've
[1:58:26] just meditating across many of these
[1:58:29] things and out of the message how can
[1:58:31] overcome
[1:58:32] brother Brown takes this with
[1:58:34] remembering Lot's wife and he speaks of
[1:58:37] how that Lot and his two daughters he
[1:58:40] said how they went on he said but his
[1:58:42] wife she started out and she done all
[1:58:45] right she left she left Sodom
[1:58:49] I want you to watch how brother Bram
[1:58:50] says this. Can I have just a few
[1:58:52] moments?
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; It's very it's very important because
[1:58:56] well, let's just look at it here.
[1:58:58] Brother Bram says that's like many of
[1:59:00] you. You've left these things to take
[1:59:02] your stand after you searched it through
[1:59:05] the scriptures and you found out it's
[1:59:07] right. You've seen the vindication of
[1:59:10] Almighty God. Not by what somebody said
[1:59:13] was a vindication, but what the Bible
[1:59:15] said would be, and here it is, is doing
[1:59:17] it. You saw it was the truth. You've set
[1:59:20] out to leave Sodom, leave the
[1:59:22] denomination, leave the things that bind
[1:59:24] you to a creed, and to follow Christ by
[1:59:27] the Holy Spirit vindicating himself by
[1:59:30] the written word. In other words, you
[1:59:32] took the Bible instead of the creed
[1:59:35] you've set out to follow. Well, Lot's
[1:59:39] wife did the same thing.
[1:59:42] That's a pretty powerful statement.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Lot's wife searched even that out and
[1:59:46] said, "Yep, this is truth.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; She set out to go with Lot, follow her
[1:59:52] husband, her children, her loved ones."
[1:59:54] But this is the key. It wasn't in her
[1:59:57] heart. She still loved the world.
[2:00:02] It was a knowledge, not a revelation.
[2:00:06] She searched out. She saw the
[2:00:07] vindication. She searched it out. Like
[2:00:09] brother Bam says, "You've taken the
[2:00:11] Bible, not the creeds." And she started
[2:00:14] out, but it wasn't in her heart.
[2:00:19] She still loved the world. It's possible
[2:00:21] to make a start and still be the world
[2:00:23] in you. She never overcome. And even
[2:00:25] though she was well on the road, it
[2:00:27] finally overthrowed her. And she had to
[2:00:29] take that one big long last look. And
[2:00:32] there's where she got caught. Don't even
[2:00:36] look back. Don't have no desires. Keep
[2:00:40] going. Put your mind on Calvary and keep
[2:00:44] moving forward.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; He said she started out as an overcomer,
[2:00:47] but she never did overcome.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; She couldn't stand the test. He said she
[2:00:53] had to look back to see what the rest of
[2:00:55] them was doing. And she's, this is
[2:00:58] brother Bram going through what she
[2:00:59] would have been saying. Oh, you know, I
[2:01:01] had some good friends down there. After
[2:01:03] all, this might be just a little move. I
[2:01:05] I don't know whether it could be right
[2:01:06] or not. I I've only got this man's word
[2:01:08] for it, though he's my husband. And your
[2:01:10] prophet said, "Your pastor is your
[2:01:11] husband spiritually speaking." And he
[2:01:13] says, she says, "Now, whether it could
[2:01:15] be right or not, I don't know. Maybe his
[2:01:17] revelation wasn't right." You see, it's
[2:01:20] not a revelation to her.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; She doesn't even know.
[2:01:25] Is his revelation. She doesn't even
[2:01:28] know. See, she's, you know, because it's
[2:01:31] not in her heart. She has knowledge, but
[2:01:34] it's not revelation.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Because if it's revelation, she would
[2:01:37] seek after it.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; She would seek her heart already because
[2:01:42] with with revelation for revelation and
[2:01:44] that part to come the the the the
[2:01:46] desires that of the world, it just
[2:01:48] starts to flee and then God can move in.
[2:01:52] Notice, brother Bram says, if you're not
[2:01:54] perfectly satisfied, you're not
[2:01:57] perfectly know that it's the word of
[2:01:58] God, then you can't go. You got to
[2:02:01] really be sold out. You've got to know,
[2:02:04] not say, "Well, I see others doing it. I
[2:02:07] see a sign." Israel started out the same
[2:02:10] way. Two million strong, but ended up
[2:02:12] with only two men. They saw the works of
[2:02:14] God, saw the manifestation of the
[2:02:16] spirit, saw great mighty miracles being
[2:02:18] down in Egypt and everything. But it
[2:02:20] wasn't in their heart. They didn't
[2:02:23] overcome. They just came out and they
[2:02:25] perished in the wilderness.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; But there was two by the name of Joshua
[2:02:31] and Caleb.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; And to show that they had more than just
[2:02:35] a knowledge, but it was a revelation.
[2:02:38] God said concerning Caleb, he's got a
[2:02:40] different spirit.
[2:02:43] Caleb, that revelation is what caused
[2:02:46] him to look beyond every
[2:02:49] every bit of odds that was against him
[2:02:51] and say, "God's with us.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; And if God's with us, who can be against
[2:02:55] us?"
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; That's the power of revelation. That's
[2:02:59] what revelation will take a heart and
[2:03:02] that life as God would begin to reveal
[2:03:04] himself to that life and break away just
[2:03:07] the desires of the world and they the
[2:03:09] the love of the world all of that is
[2:03:11] fleeing that they that it might become a
[2:03:14] uniting between them and Christ this is
[2:03:17] why friends within this and I I just say
[2:03:19] this here just just go ahead and close
[2:03:22] this is why it's so imperative and so
[2:03:24] important this revelation it must be in
[2:03:27] our hearts
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; When it's in our hearts, it shows where
[2:03:32] it's at.
[2:03:34] If it's just in our knowledge, it'll
[2:03:36] show.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; But if it's in our heart, there's a love
[2:03:39] affair. It's a love affair with God.
[2:03:42] It's there there's a relationship.
[2:03:44] There's a life that's lived that it's
[2:03:47] not what you're trying to do. It's what
[2:03:49] Christ is doing through you. It's it's
[2:03:53] it's where you see the desires of the
[2:03:55] world. Your nature has been changed and
[2:03:58] the only desire you have is to please
[2:04:01] the Lord Jesus
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; and you can hear him. You can see him.
[2:04:04] You can see him in his servants. You can
[2:04:06] hear his voice. You can hear him. You're
[2:04:08] recognizing the word because the word is
[2:04:10] your husband,
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; not a man. The word is your husband and
[2:04:14] you're submitting to that word, being
[2:04:17] led by that word. This is where divine
[2:04:20] revelation is so important
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; because just to have a knowledge of it
[2:04:30] where the love of the world is is is
[2:04:31] still there
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; but when it when it's revealed you say
[2:04:35] brother Samuel what would it take even
[2:04:37] for that place even to come and how God
[2:04:39] begins to break forth and reveal
[2:04:43] is where the person gets to a place and
[2:04:46] God knows how to bring us to that place
[2:04:48] is where they're tired of living where
[2:04:51] they've lived.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; If you're content with where you're at,
[2:04:58] God's not going to he won't he won't
[2:05:00] manhandle nobody.
[2:05:02] But this is how God works to deal with
[2:05:05] lives to draw you in a love affair.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Because God don't want you serving him
[2:05:09] under fear because
[2:05:12] at least a little bit you get fear
[2:05:14] lifted out then you you go right back.
[2:05:16] God don't want you serving out of fear.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; He wants a true a true reverence. And
[2:05:21] that reverence is is Lord, I love you. I
[2:05:24] just want to please you, Lord. And it's
[2:05:26] where you're moving on just like Joshua
[2:05:28] and Caleb. It's you you just see the
[2:05:30] word as it's opening right before you.
[2:05:32] And it also gives you wisdom. Maybe as
[2:05:37] look sitting right here this morning. It
[2:05:39] gives wisdom where the prophet would say
[2:05:41] it like this. He said this is where he
[2:05:44] says we need to pray for God to give us
[2:05:49] revelation.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; I would say this just as the prophet
[2:05:54] echoed this within the message. He said
[2:05:57] we need to ask God for continuous
[2:06:00] lifegiving revelation. He said, "Ask God
[2:06:03] to give us a fresh revelation and then
[2:06:07] by it become the living word made
[2:06:11] manifest."
[2:06:13] So divine revelation, this is our this
[2:06:16] is our approach to God. This is how we
[2:06:19] see God. This is how we know God. This
[2:06:21] is how we come into relationship. It's
[2:06:24] all by divine revelation. So people
[2:06:28] could look at the same thing. Abel and
[2:06:30] Cain looked at the same thing. What made
[2:06:33] the difference? Revelation.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; It's it told within their offerings.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; And see, that's what that's what that
[2:06:39] that's what expresses even out of our
[2:06:41] own lives is Lord, I don't want to just
[2:06:44] offer something that's just out here.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; But you're calling upon this.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; He's calling on the offering from our
[2:06:53] lives that our lives would be
[2:06:55] surrendered. Our lives would be all. And
[2:06:57] I I just say it in this way as I close.
[2:07:00] That's something that you can take and
[2:07:02] you can ask God. Say, "Lord, reveal
[2:07:05] yourself to me." Maybe you're in a place
[2:07:07] here this morning. You say, "But Sam,
[2:07:09] I've never been able to come to that
[2:07:10] place of surrender." Then what a what a
[2:07:12] key. How God in his mercy would bring us
[2:07:15] into those places of a key to where with
[2:07:17] that we can say, "Lord, reveal yourself
[2:07:19] to me, Lord. Make yourself known to me,
[2:07:22] Lord. God, make yourself real, Lord.
[2:07:24] take everything out of my life that's
[2:07:26] unlike unlike you. You know what? Say,
[2:07:28] "Lord, change my desires." Be honest
[2:07:30] with God. Don't just, "Well, brother
[2:07:32] Samuel, I still love those things." Be
[2:07:34] hon.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Invite God in.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Like I told the young people over there,
[2:07:39] I SAID, "INVITE GOD INTO your playlist."
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; You got a playlist that YOU'RE ASHAMED
[2:07:44] OF. INVITE GOD INTO IT.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; INVITE GOD INTO THOSE AREAS OF YOUR life
[2:07:49] and watch what HE'LL DO. DON'T DON'T BE
[2:07:51] TOO BIG TO SAY, "GOD, I'VE GOT A
[2:07:53] PROBLEM. I REALIZE I STILL LOVE THE
[2:07:55] WORLD. LORD, I NEED YOU, LORD. I NEED
[2:07:58] YOU TO CHANGE ME. THIS IS A SERIOUS
[2:08:00] CONDITION, LORD.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; But I know your arm is not too short,
[2:08:04] Lord. I know you're mindful of me, Lord.
[2:08:06] Father, I want I I need more than
[2:08:09] knowledge. I need a revelation, Lord.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; I need to see you, Lord, so that I can
[2:08:14] see that in that package." Lord God
[2:08:16] begin to seek after with all my heart to
[2:08:18] where the love of the world has fled
[2:08:19] away.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Watch what God will do. Begin to invite
[2:08:22] him.
[2:08:24] Begin to invite him. You hear what I'm
[2:08:26] saying? Begin to invite him. There's
[2:08:27] all, oh, brother Samuel, that this
[2:08:29] didn't happen in this service. I'm not
[2:08:30] worried about if something happened in
[2:08:32] this service or not. There's things that
[2:08:33] already when one piece of sand is set in
[2:08:35] motion, it's already a testament that
[2:08:38] the REST OF THE MOUNTAIN IS ON ITS WAY.
[2:08:42] IF THOU SHALT SAY UNTO THIS MOUNTAIN, BE
[2:08:43] PLUCKED UP AND removed and cast in
[2:08:45] yonder sea, it shall be even as they
[2:08:47] have said in thine heart. And this
[2:08:49] revelation is right here in my heart.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; And that revelation in my heart is for
[2:08:54] your your heart, for your life as well,
[2:08:56] too. Because it's not the revelation of
[2:08:58] Samuel Browning. It's the revelation of
[2:08:59] Jesus Christ.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE SAME ALMIGHTY GOD THAT
[2:09:04] changes lives again and again and again.
[2:09:06] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:09:08] forever.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why for your loved ones,
[2:09:13] even in all of our lives, Lord, I mean,
[2:09:15] what are you doing when you're asking
[2:09:17] God about Lord, what road do I take?
[2:09:20] What career do I take? Lord, do I go
[2:09:22] here or do I go there? You need you pray
[2:09:26] and ask God, Lord, I need you to speak
[2:09:28] to me. You know what you're asking God
[2:09:30] to do? Reveal himself.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I I I need a revelation. I don't
[2:09:34] want to just go out here and just when
[2:09:36] I'm out here just, well, I may be so, I
[2:09:38] could be so. I don't know. I mean, you
[2:09:39] know, brother so and so told me that I
[2:09:41] should move here and so I don't want to
[2:09:42] I'm not going nowhere because brother so
[2:09:44] and so told me cuz brother so and so is
[2:09:46] not my Holy Ghost.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? This is why that the
[2:09:50] moves of God that have went on around
[2:09:53] even doctrines, you hear them? Their
[2:09:55] founders have gone. I'm talking about
[2:09:57] even around this truth. Their founders
[2:09:58] are gone and they gather and play that
[2:09:59] founders tapes.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; Why? They're lost without direction.
[2:10:05] That's true.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; But once you've been brought in contact
[2:10:07] with Jesus Christ, this is why, friends,
[2:10:10] you've not been united with a man's
[2:10:12] personality.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; You've been united with Jesus Christ.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus Christ is he that liveth
[2:10:20] forever and ever.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; This man or anybody else can pass right
[2:10:24] off the scene. It could be my last
[2:10:26] service. It could be the last time. But
[2:10:27] you know what? He will still remain.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; And what he started, he'll finish. Yes.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. This is why that our
[2:10:36] victory, this is why that everything
[2:10:37] doesn't tie around upon a man. We're not
[2:10:40] resting on a man. Don't rest on the arm
[2:10:42] of flesh.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; You don't rest on the arm of flesh. You
[2:10:45] rest on the living God.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talked to brother Sher.
[2:10:52] Brother Sher got a kidney condition. He
[2:10:54] said, "I know brother Brandham and I
[2:10:55] know brother oral Roberts and I know
[2:10:57] them and I'm going to have them go pray
[2:10:58] for me." He had Oral Roberts go pray for
[2:11:00] him. It went away and came back. He went
[2:11:02] he went over to he went over to brother
[2:11:03] Brandham. Brother Brham said, "Brother,
[2:11:05] brother shared, I can't see nothing
[2:11:06] wrong in your life. I don't see anything
[2:11:07] wrong." And you know what? They prayed.
[2:11:09] They prayed it would lift up and then it
[2:11:10] would come right back. Finally, brother
[2:11:13] Sherid was laying on the operating
[2:11:14] table. And he's laying there. He said,
[2:11:16] "Lord, you know I love you."
[2:11:19] And he said, "Such a sweet peace came in
[2:11:22] that operating room." He said, "The
[2:11:24] doctors," he said, even when they
[2:11:25] performed that operate, they said, "What
[2:11:27] a success and a smoothness." And brother
[2:11:29] Brand picks it up. He said, "You see
[2:11:30] what it was?" He said, "Brother Sheret
[2:11:33] had got his confidence built in who he
[2:11:36] knew."
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Vessels that God was using, but God
[2:11:41] don't want you resting on no man.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; This message is not about you and your
[2:11:47] mama and Jesus. This message is not
[2:11:49] about you and brother Brandham and
[2:11:51] Jesus. This message is not about you and
[2:11:53] BROTHER SAMUEL AND JESUS. THIS MESSAGE
[2:11:55] IS ABOUT YOU AND JESUS.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; That's who it's about. That's right.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go through nobody.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; You get in him. That's what's important.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TALKING ABOUT JESUS ON the
[2:12:08] main line. Tell him what you want.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I TELL YOU FRIENDS, IF THERE'S ONE
[2:12:15] THING AT ALL HERE THIS MORNING, THE
[2:12:17] PROMISE IS SET BEFORE US. SURE. the
[2:12:20] seriousness of it which I believe God in
[2:12:22] his grace points us to the realness and
[2:12:24] the seriousness of it that even even as
[2:12:26] parents even as others that we can pray
[2:12:29] and when you listen to me now listen
[2:12:31] older ones listen to me now even even
[2:12:33] those that were moved in among younger
[2:12:35] ones listen don't go around and picking
[2:12:39] people apart
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; well they didn't see this and they
[2:12:43] didn't see this
[2:12:45] pray more than you pick
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; and pray that God will take that picker
[2:12:50] away from you.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Because you WERE IN A MESS, TOO.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Are you HEARING ME?
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT GOD'S SOVEREIGN GRACE
[2:12:58] REVEALING HIMSELF TO YOU, YOU AND I
[2:13:01] WOULD BE IN THE SAME PLACE.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT HERE BECAUSE I WAS A PASTOR'S
[2:13:05] SON.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT HERE BECAUSE I HEARD THE PROPHET
[2:13:08] PLAY THROUGHOUT MY HOME. I'M HERE
[2:13:11] because of God's grace.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD REVEALED HIMSELF TO ME THAT
[2:13:16] THIS IS LIFE. AMEN.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; AND GOD BROUGHT ME TO A PLACE TO WHERE I
[2:13:21] NO LONGER I GOT TIRED OF BEING Samuel
[2:13:23] Brownie.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I still am.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; He's still my biggest enemy. You know
[2:13:29] what reveals him to be my biggest enemy?
[2:13:31] When I get in the presence of my Lord
[2:13:33] Jesus.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; That ought not be strange to you. Esther
[2:13:37] invited Hmon to a banquet every time.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Come on over, boy. I'M GOING TO EXPOSE
[2:13:43] YOU IN THE PRESENCE OF MY HUSBAND. WHERE
[2:13:45] DO YOU BRING YOUR ENEMY? DAVID SAID, "HE
[2:13:48] HATH PREPARED FOR ME A TABLE IN THE
[2:13:50] PRESENCE OF MINE ENEMIES."
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; I TELL MY ENEMY, "RAISE YOUR HAND, BOY."
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; MY ENEMY SAYS, "HEY, IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT
[2:14:03] JUST TO STAY HOME. YOU YOU'LL BE ALL
[2:14:05] RIGHT THERE." BUT SOME ON THE INSIDE
[2:14:06] SAID, "NO, SIR. I NEED TO BE PART RIGHT
[2:14:08] THERE AND UNITE THAT LICK OF FIRE AND
[2:14:11] PULL ON THE GIFT OF GOD. I NEED TO HEAR
[2:14:13] FROM GOD."
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE not my boss. I'm yours.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all need to tell yourself
[2:14:22] that. You need to tell yourself that.
[2:14:24] You can tell you tell that frown, tell
[2:14:26] that. You know what? You're not my boss.
[2:14:28] That's right.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; I'm yours.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Wow. That's powerful, isn't it?
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Simple.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; I know it's very simple, but you know,
[2:14:36] that's the whole reality of the gospel.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful? If I can have the
[2:14:40] musicians come and that song,
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; you didn't have to open my eyes. Right.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, you could have easily passed me
[2:14:48] by.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; He could have passed me by. See, then
[2:14:52] then we know how to pray. You and I'm
[2:14:54] not saying we didn't know how to pray
[2:14:55] before, but sometimes we can become
[2:14:58] or we almost think repetition is what's
[2:15:01] going to get it. It ain't repetition,
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; And a people need to hear, "I need to
[2:15:04] hear the same thing over and over and
[2:15:05] over and over and over." It's true that
[2:15:07] what we hear over and over is a call to
[2:15:09] the life of God, right? And let God's
[2:15:11] life live through us. But we need the
[2:15:14] revelation.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; There's hearts and lives.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Even lives that maybe they've walked,
[2:15:22] they've been baptized in the God touch
[2:15:24] their heart. They need they need a
[2:15:27] deeper revelation. They need a
[2:15:28] revelation to know God wants the
[2:15:31] tabernacle in me.
[2:15:34] And friends, I I really encourage you
[2:15:37] just be honest with God.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you right now, listen
[2:15:40] to me. I'm not ashamed of one of you.
[2:15:45] You could take the vilest person could
[2:15:47] come in here. I'm not ashamed.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm not interested in this church
[2:15:52] having a certain look for nobody else.
[2:15:54] I'm not interested in putting on a show.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; I don't care what anybody else thinks
[2:15:59] cuz I'm not interested in what anybody
[2:16:00] else thinks. I want to know what God
[2:16:02] thinks.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make this a place so
[2:16:06] everybody all pat me on the back. Oh,
[2:16:07] brother Sam. It ain't about that. I want
[2:16:10] God to live inside our hearts and lives.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; I want God to have the preeminence.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; So this is why that even that I pray
[2:16:19] even as I pray. I trust you do.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; I think you need I think we need to to
[2:16:23] come to this place. I know sometimes you
[2:16:25] you may not see Listen to me now. You
[2:16:27] may not see sometimes the movement that
[2:16:29] you want to see. Don't start
[2:16:31] complaining.
[2:16:32] Give God time.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Give God time. If you'll take that and
[2:16:37] really get Listen to me, friends, the
[2:16:39] power of prayer can never be
[2:16:41] underestimated.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; You've got love. WE'VE GOT LOVED ONES.
[2:16:46] THERE'S THOSE THAT HAVE SAT RIGHT HERE
[2:16:48] BACKSLIDERS. I DON'T CARE HOW LONG
[2:16:50] THEY'VE BEEN OUT.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; You've seen God bring individuals that
[2:16:57] have been away for 20ome years.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; God bring them right back.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; And they're different.
[2:17:05] They're different.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; God's hand is not too short.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Samuel, what do my children
[2:17:13] need? What do my loved ones need? You
[2:17:15] say, "God,
[2:17:17] make yourself known to him."
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Get them to a place, Lord, to where the
[2:17:22] love of the world, it's just it's lost.
[2:17:25] It's it's lost its hold, lost its its
[2:17:27] its taste.
[2:17:30] Anybody know what I'm talking about? I
[2:17:31] listen, you don't have you didn't even
[2:17:33] have to be out in the world. Some of
[2:17:34] you, I realize you never were out there.
[2:17:36] I say, glory be to God. What a powerful
[2:17:39] testimony you have
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; of not being entrenched in the things
[2:17:42] that's out there. Don't no don't let the
[2:17:44] devil try to minimize that. That's a
[2:17:46] powerful testimony that God has been
[2:17:49] able to keep you by his grace until he
[2:17:52] would tabernacle himself in you. What a
[2:17:54] powerful testimony.
[2:17:57] But God's got testimonies all around
[2:17:58] this congregation of what his mercy has
[2:18:01] done.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; He's got testimonies that can be pointed
[2:18:05] to and say, "God still delivers."
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe your situation right now, you just
[2:18:13] like to say, "Lord,
[2:18:15] I want this situation. I want my life to
[2:18:17] be a testimony.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; I want my life. I want my situation."
[2:18:23] Maybe you're home. Lord, I want it to be
[2:18:25] a testimony.
[2:18:27] Listen, let me tell you. God will never
[2:18:29] If he went to Simon's house
[2:18:32] and he and he was invited, Brother
[2:18:34] Carlos, he knew he weren't going to be
[2:18:36] welcomed, but he went there anyway.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; He'll always come where he's invited.
[2:18:41] But if you invite him,
[2:18:43] welcome him.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord,
[2:18:47] I'm tired of trying to figure this out."
[2:18:52] Welcome. Hallelujah.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Lord God, you you take control in this
[2:18:57] tabernacle. You take control, Lord. Even
[2:18:59] as young people, Lord, you take control.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; I don't want to try to I don't want to
[2:19:06] try to live what I think the message is
[2:19:08] about. That's still wondering.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; I want you to live, Lord.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; I want this message to live in me.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; I want Christ to live in me. I don't
[2:19:19] want to It's It's not up to me to try to
[2:19:20] figure it out. It's just give myself and
[2:19:23] you'll live live yourself through me.
[2:19:28] I believe all throughout this
[2:19:29] congregation, we can even say here this
[2:19:31] morning, Lord,
[2:19:33] live through me, Lord.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; I know there's many been serving God for
[2:19:39] a long time,
[2:19:43] but you go through different seasons and
[2:19:45] times of life.
[2:19:48] And God makes himself known to be the
[2:19:50] same, but he'll deal with us in that
[2:19:53] season.
[2:19:54] And he'll make himself even that much
[2:19:57] more real. Brother Bram had three pools
[2:20:00] in his ministry.
[2:20:02] And every one of them that every
[2:20:03] transition
[2:20:06] was not for more of William Brandham. It
[2:20:09] was actually less of William Brandham
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; and more of God.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; And that's the same way it is in the
[2:20:15] seasons of our life. The transitions God
[2:20:17] brings us into places where we say,
[2:20:19] "Lord,
[2:20:21] we say, Lord, I surrender." There's
[2:20:23] things that you can see about your life
[2:20:25] right now that you didn't see a year
[2:20:27] ago. Right?
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; There's things that you can look at now
[2:20:31] and and you would have never saw it. It
[2:20:32] wouldn't matter. Yeah. I could have sat
[2:20:33] down with quotes or what more. Not that
[2:20:35] I saw it, but I'm just saying. But when
[2:20:37] God speaks to you,
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; see that relationship between you and
[2:20:40] God,
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; And he's not interested. He don't he
[2:20:43] don't put you down, but he's interested
[2:20:45] in causing you to surrender.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; No wonder the Bible said, "He had
[2:20:49] brought me to his banqueting table, and
[2:20:51] his standard over me is love."
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him this morning?
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Could we just give him a wave offering?
[2:20:57] Lord, I love you. I just appreciate you,
[2:20:59] Lord.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God, for your mercies.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Through the year of 2025, thank you for
[2:21:05] your mercies, Lord.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; God, grant this to be the year in 2026
[2:21:10] of the prodals coming home. LORD, GRANT
[2:21:12] THIS, LORD, MY SON, MY DAUGHTER. LORD,
[2:21:15] GRANT IT, LORD, MY CHILDREN. GRANT IT,
[2:21:17] LORD, IN MY HOME. LORD, GRANT IT, LORD
[2:21:19] GOD, WITH A HEALING OF DISEASES AND
[2:21:21] SICKNESSES, Lord God, for you're still
[2:21:23] the same, Lord God. Grant, Lord, the
[2:21:25] outpouring of your spirit, hearts and
[2:21:27] lives, Lord, being changed. Grant, Lord,
[2:21:31] create in me, Lord.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Create in me, like the prophet said,
[2:21:35] what's lacking. Create in me, Lord.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Make me to hunger. Make me to thirst.
[2:21:40] Make me more humbler.
[2:21:42] Grant it, Lord.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:49] Lord Jesus,
[2:21:52] we say amen. Lord, we say amen.
[2:21:55] We say amen to your word.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Father, as your prophet has taught us,
[2:22:01] there's no higher court of appeal
[2:22:05] than the presence of God
[2:22:08] when your word has been spoken.
[2:22:11] Lord Jesus,
[2:22:14] I pray right now,
[2:22:17] Lord, through the the simpleness
[2:22:21] of your word that has been spoke to our
[2:22:24] hearts,
[2:22:25] may each and every one of our lives,
[2:22:29] Lord, we leave out of here
[2:22:33] even with a
[2:22:36] a real clear vision before
[2:22:42] What I'm holding for lives
[2:22:46] that God will become
[2:22:50] fully overtaken by the spirit of God
[2:22:55] tabernacling deity.
[2:22:58] Your word won't return back to your
[2:23:00] void. I'm holding, Lord God, for your
[2:23:04] word to bring healing in homes.
[2:23:08] I'm holding, Father, for your word to
[2:23:11] bring deliverance to the captives.
[2:23:14] I'm holding to your word, Lord God,
[2:23:18] for the prodals to come home.
[2:23:21] Granted, Lord God,
[2:23:25] you know right where they are.
[2:23:28] You know right where they are. I pray
[2:23:30] you deal with them right where they're
[2:23:31] at. Lord,
[2:23:37] may the remembrance of your presence
[2:23:39] where they've sat, Lord, in meetings,
[2:23:41] may it sweep over them right now.
[2:23:44] Deal with them, Lord, just as you would
[2:23:46] deal with every heart that's here. And
[2:23:49] Lord God, any love of the world melted
[2:23:51] away, would you, Lord?
[2:23:54] Oh God, I pray
[2:23:58] Lord God those Lord dealing with
[2:24:00] different sickness and ailments Lord in
[2:24:02] their body.
[2:24:04] Father we take the promise of your word
[2:24:10] and we hold to that Lord
[2:24:13] by your stripes we were healed.
[2:24:19] Oh God grant it. Not only Lord God for
[2:24:22] afflictions in the body but Father there
[2:24:24] in the spirit or the mind. Lord I pray
[2:24:27] father in the name of Jesus Christ may
[2:24:30] every tormenting spirit dear God may it
[2:24:34] be broken.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:24:39] Dear God, MAY I PRAY, FATHER, THE hold
[2:24:42] that the enemy has wanted to put around
[2:24:44] holds and lives AND FAMILIES. LORD, MAY
[2:24:46] IT BEGIN TO GIVE WAY, LORD GOD, LIKE THE
[2:24:48] PHILIPPIAN jail gave way, LORD GOD. MAY
[2:24:51] EVERY HINDRANCE, EVERY WALL, Lord God,
[2:24:53] like whether it was holding in Rahab,
[2:24:55] may it be brought down, Lord, that your
[2:24:57] children can walk forth with freedom.
[2:25:02] Help us, Lord. Help us God as we Lord
[2:25:06] would unite our hearts and our faith
[2:25:08] together to pray knowing
[2:25:13] it's revelation.
[2:25:16] It must be revealed.
[2:25:19] Help us to be Lord not a hindrance but a
[2:25:23] channel.
[2:25:26] We know Lord that we can't give somebody
[2:25:28] else a revelation. But oh God, help us
[2:25:31] to be the right kind of display.
[2:25:34] Help us to be like your prophet would
[2:25:36] talk about that man who was a outside of
[2:25:39] that bar. And that little boy ran in and
[2:25:42] got that owner and said, "Hey, your
[2:25:43] sign's down." He said, "My sign?" He ran
[2:25:46] outside and looked up and said, "My sign
[2:25:48] ain't down. It's right up there on the
[2:25:49] building." He said, "No, I'm talking
[2:25:51] about your best sign." And he pointed to
[2:25:54] that drunk that was laying on the road.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the best sign you've
[2:25:58] got of what you got in there."
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may our lives be the best sign.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Not that we in ourselves are better than
[2:26:06] anybody. That's not it at all. But may
[2:26:08] our lives be the real sign
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; of what this is all about, Lord.
[2:26:17] May our lives be the display
[2:26:21] of Jesus Christ.
[2:26:23] Help us, fathers, mothers, husbands,
[2:26:25] wives, children, young people. Lord God,
[2:26:27] I pray Lord for the young people, Lord,
[2:26:29] that gathered here. Lord God, I pray,
[2:26:32] Father,
[2:26:34] realizing, Lord God, what a blessing it
[2:26:36] is to be able to be raised in a real
[2:26:39] godly home, to be taught the precepts of
[2:26:41] God.
[2:26:44] Father, to have Lord that protection, to
[2:26:46] have that encouragement, but Lord God,
[2:26:49] may they realize that that's all
[2:26:52] protection,
[2:26:55] but it's not going to be about what they
[2:26:57] do, but rather accepting
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; what you've done for them. May you
[2:27:03] reveal yourself to each one. Lord, make
[2:27:06] yourself known. If there's a need here
[2:27:09] this morning, Lord, that my upon a heart
[2:27:12] it just seems like so impossible, Lord.
[2:27:15] Maybe it's darkness and such gloom and
[2:27:17] doubt has gathered around and just
[2:27:19] oppressiveness.
[2:27:21] Father, I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:27:24] Christ.
[2:27:26] May that darkness, Lord, give way
[2:27:32] at the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:27:35] May the light break through, Lord God. I
[2:27:37] pray
[2:27:40] grant it Lord to where Lord they can
[2:27:42] grab a hold of that line. They can grab
[2:27:44] a hold and you can lead them right out
[2:27:47] of that darkness. You can lead them
[2:27:48] right out of that depression. You can
[2:27:50] lead them right out Lord God of that
[2:27:52] gloom that Lord where it looks like
[2:27:54] there's no way out. That I pray God
[2:27:56] there's a lifeline in the building this
[2:27:57] morning. There's a bloodline that's
[2:28:00] here. There's a Holy Ghost that's here.
[2:28:03] Grant it Lord I pray. Grant it Lord
[2:28:10] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:28:14] Amen.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, buddy.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; You didn't have to open my eyes.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to stand.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Could easily
[2:28:30] pass be
[2:28:34] for the age I was living
[2:28:39] in
[2:28:40] was wretched
[2:28:42] poor
[2:28:44] and and blind.
[2:28:49] But then I heard you recognize
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; I sing you day
[2:28:56] serent sea
[2:28:59] and perfect
[2:29:01] faith
[2:29:04] the preach
[2:29:06] and the message of grace.
[2:29:10] And Lord,
[2:29:12] I thank thee.
[2:29:18] And I just want to thank you, Lord.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Father, for letting me hear your
[2:29:30] word.
[2:29:33] What have I done to deserve
[2:29:38] such glories revealed
[2:29:42] in me?
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; Thanks for that special
[2:29:51] night. Oh, when I saw your glorious
[2:29:59] light,
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; came face to face with eternal life.
[2:30:07] And Lord,
[2:30:10] I made me
[2:30:16] not even in my wildest
[2:30:20] dream.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. That's right.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; Did I think I see
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; as the coming
[2:30:32] of the Lord, the rapture
[2:30:37] is my story.
[2:30:43] Oh, I have moved.
[2:30:46] Now I see
[2:30:50] God in
[2:30:53] simplicity.
[2:30:57] The spoken word is original
[2:31:03] and
[2:31:05] I
[2:31:09] hallelujah.
[2:31:11] Oh, I just want to thank you. Oh, could
[2:31:16] we just thank you? Thank you, Lord, for
[2:31:19] letting me hear your word.
[2:31:25] What have I done
[2:31:29] to deserve such glory revealed
[2:31:34] in me?
[2:31:38] Oh, thanks for that special
[2:31:43] God.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; When I saw your glorious
[2:31:51] life,
[2:31:52] you came face to face with eternal
[2:31:57] life. Oh, and Lord,
[2:32:01] I thank thee.
[2:32:08] Hallelujah.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; You know, I think about this
[2:32:13] cuz there's there's certain flavors that
[2:32:16] I really don't care for.
[2:32:20] I've got these things everywhere.
[2:32:25] And you know, they're kind of strong
[2:32:26] fisherman's friends.
[2:32:30] And there was a time I, you know, was
[2:32:34] preaching a meeting and I needed a cough
[2:32:35] drop. get that dry coughing. You know, I
[2:32:37] was up there starting to print. I needed
[2:32:38] them. I think I took the first offering
[2:32:40] of cough drops. I had all kinds laid up
[2:32:43] here on me. But, you know, we talked
[2:32:46] about knowledge. You could look at know
[2:32:47] what's in that package even and if you
[2:32:49] look at say, I don't like honey lemon.
[2:32:55] I don't like that.
[2:32:57] But if you get desperate enough,
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; you don't care if it's honey, lemon,
[2:33:03] cherry, mint, you say, "Give me one of
[2:33:06] those. I have needs."
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; God knows how to bring desperation.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; You know, it's like a
[2:33:17] it's like a woman getting ready for
[2:33:20] birth. Sometimes they have to go ahead
[2:33:22] and induce that birth. And sometimes
[2:33:25] what they'll do is they'll start a drip.
[2:33:28] There's little things that they'll start
[2:33:29] doing to get it bringing it to birth.
[2:33:35] Guy back there on the drum with drums
[2:33:37] was kind of a stubborn one coming out.
[2:33:41] He was a little overdone when he came
[2:33:43] out, but
[2:33:45] they had to start doing things. And you
[2:33:46] know sometimes when you do that what
[2:33:48] they call a a drip and it just what it
[2:33:51] does is it starts the system moving
[2:33:53] towards birth.
[2:33:56] I believe God
[2:33:58] God start a drip.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; Person can walk right. God's starting
[2:34:04] that drip. You know what he's doing?
[2:34:05] He's bringing it right in condition.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; He's bringing a riding condition. Aren't
[2:34:11] you Aren't you thankful for how God
[2:34:13] works?
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. when you can you can pray and then
[2:34:16] you can say, "God, just just be real
[2:34:18] through my life. How however you want me
[2:34:19] to speak to my loved ones because
[2:34:22] one of the greatest things is just show
[2:34:24] them you care,
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; Show them you care
[2:34:28] and you're right with them."
[2:34:31] Brother Bram never distanced himself
[2:34:33] from Billy Paul when Billy Paul was
[2:34:34] going through all his time.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; Neither did Brother Bram go and go
[2:34:38] fishing with him and preach at him.
[2:34:42] Sometimes I know that harder based on
[2:34:43] how our makeup is, but he didn't. But
[2:34:46] you know what it was? It was God with
[2:34:48] skin on.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; That that's what's important. Just be
[2:34:52] God with skin on. But the same I can't
[2:34:54] put everything there. You don't need to.
[2:34:55] Let God in you. God knows right to give
[2:34:57] you what right words what to say at the
[2:34:59] right time. And what's most important is
[2:35:02] the display of Christ through your life.
[2:35:03] Right?
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; Think about that man who was one to the
[2:35:10] Lord, gave his life because he saw a
[2:35:12] mother dear, but he saw loyalty.
[2:35:16] What about the brother who saw the sun
[2:35:18] rising and setting? He brought back
[2:35:20] everything he heard the preacher preach
[2:35:21] the songs of sung, but he surrendered
[2:35:23] his heart to God. See, God's sovereign.
[2:35:26] Every experience, just like your
[2:35:28] experience, it's personal.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; It's personal. God knows just how to get
[2:35:33] a hold of their their lives, your
[2:35:36] children, your loved ones. God knows how
[2:35:39] to break down every wheel. So, Brother
[2:35:41] Samuel, what what do we do? Have
[2:35:43] patience with God.
[2:35:46] Don't get in no hurry,
[2:35:48] but get desperate.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Get desperate for their souls.
[2:35:53] And you way the desperate for their
[2:35:55] souls, it's more praying
[2:35:59] than it is talking.
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's praying for them. Enter in
[2:36:04] for them, Lord, because you know where
[2:36:06] you were and you know where they are.
[2:36:09] And they they can't I couldn't
[2:36:12] understand. But Joey, there's no way I
[2:36:14] could understand. I I thought it was
[2:36:16] something that I would do. And that
[2:36:18] nature within me, how can that be? I
[2:36:20] didn't want I didn't All I saw was
[2:36:22] conflict. But when God breaks down that
[2:36:26] nature to where the love of the world,
[2:36:28] brother Brian, it just
[2:36:31] it gets that place that you say, "I
[2:36:32] don't care if they are Honey Lemon.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; I want him.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; I want that Holy Ghost."
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; I want him to change my associates. I
[2:36:41] want him to change my life completely. I
[2:36:43] want him.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; God knows how to do it.
[2:36:49] &gt;&gt; He knows how to start that inducing of
[2:36:52] labor.
[2:36:53] get it everything just right in place.
[2:36:56] God is so faithful, friends. Don't you
[2:36:59] love him?
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; Don't you appreciate his mercy?
[2:37:06] He has shown
[2:37:09] the light
[2:37:12] all around me
[2:37:14] so that I
[2:37:18] can clearly
[2:37:20] see. Oh, that if it
[2:37:24] was
[2:37:25] before
[2:37:27] the lighthouse.
[2:37:30] Tell tell me where
[2:37:33] will this
[2:37:35] ship be?
[2:37:37] And I thank God
[2:37:41] for
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; Let's pray over this for Okay.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; I owe my life to him.
[2:37:55] Jesus
[2:37:57] is the lighthouse.
[2:38:01] Oh, and from the rocks
[2:38:06] of sin.
[2:38:08] And he has shown
[2:38:11] his light all around me
[2:38:17] that I might clearly
[2:38:21] see.
[2:38:23] And if it was sent for
[2:38:29] the lighthouse,
[2:38:32] tell me where
[2:38:34] would this ship be?
[2:38:40] There's a lighthouse
[2:38:44] on a hillside
[2:38:48] that overlooks.
[2:38:52] I see.
[2:38:55] When I'm tossed,
[2:38:58] it sends
[2:39:00] out
[2:39:01] a light
[2:39:03] that I might clearly
[2:39:07] see.
[2:39:10] Oh, and the light
[2:39:12] that shines
[2:39:17] now
[2:39:18] will safely
[2:39:20] leave me. Oh,
[2:39:25] if it wasn't
[2:39:28] for the lighthouse,
[2:39:32] oh, my share would sail no more. And I
[2:39:40] thank God.
[2:39:47] Oh, I owe my life.
[2:39:54] Oh, for Jesus
[2:39:58] is the lighthouse
[2:40:03] and from the rocks of sin.
[2:40:09] And he had, oh, thank you, Lord, his
[2:40:13] light, a revelation all around me that I
[2:40:20] might clearly
[2:40:22] see.
[2:40:24] And if it wasn't
[2:40:28] for
[2:40:29] the lighthouse,
[2:40:33] tell me where
[2:40:40] now everybody
[2:40:43] that lives
[2:40:44] around me.
[2:40:47] Oh, they say tear that lie. house down.
[2:40:54] Oh, you see all the big ships,
[2:40:58] they just don't sail here anymore.
[2:41:03] Ain't no use of it standing
[2:41:07] around.
[2:41:08] But then my mind goes back to that
[2:41:14] stormy
[2:41:16] night. Oh, thank God. Just in time, I
[2:41:21] saw the evening light and the light from
[2:41:27] that old message last.
[2:41:31] Oh, it stand
[2:41:34] upon there on here. And I thank God
[2:41:42] for
[2:41:44] the for this lighthouse.

[2:41:52] I owe my life to him. For Jesus
[2:41:57] is the lighthouse.
[2:42:03] from the rocks
[2:42:06] of sin and he has shown
[2:42:12] his life all around me. Thank you Lord
[2:42:16] Jesus that I might clearly
[2:42:21] see
[2:42:23] and if it wasn't
[2:42:27] for the lighthouse.
[2:42:32] Tell me when.
[2:42:35] Amen. Let's sing a second verse just one
[2:42:37] more time. Oh, now everybody
[2:42:42] that lives all around us,
[2:42:47] they say tear that lie house down.
[2:42:53] Oh, you see all the big ships,
[2:42:57] they just don't sail here anymore.
[2:43:02] Ain't no use of it standing.
[2:43:06] Oh my. But then my mind goes back to
[2:43:13] that stormy
[2:43:15] night when Oh, thank God. Just in time I
[2:43:20] saw the light and the light from that
[2:43:26] old light
[2:43:30] house that stands
[2:43:33] there upon a hill. And I thank God.
[2:43:41] Oh hallelujah.
[2:43:43] I'm so thankful for the lighthouse. I
[2:43:46] owe my life.
[2:43:50] Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.
[2:43:53] For Jesus
[2:43:56] is the lighthouse
[2:44:01] and from the rocks of sin. And he has
[2:44:08] shown
[2:44:11] the light all around me
[2:44:16] that I might clearly
[2:44:20] see.
[2:44:21] And if it wasn't
[2:44:25] for
[2:44:27] the lie,
[2:44:30] tell me where
[2:44:32] would this
[2:44:34] ship be?
[2:44:36] And he has shown
[2:44:40] his light
[2:44:42] all around me
[2:44:46] that I might clearly
[2:44:50] see.
[2:44:52] And if it wasn't
[2:44:56] for
[2:44:57] the lighthouse,
[2:45:00] tell me where
[2:45:03] would this
[2:45:06] ship be? Hallelujah. Oh, aren't you so
[2:45:10] glad for that this morning?

[2:45:15] song before we go. Well, I don't know
[2:45:18] how. I don't know why. I cannot explain
[2:45:24] the love of God for my soul. But down
[2:45:28] inside of me, when I hear the word, my
[2:45:33] heart says
[2:45:35] amen.
[2:45:37] I say amen.

[2:45:46] that you can't see now.

[2:46:45] with Jesus Christ.
[2:46:50] Well, I don't know how. I don't know
[2:46:54] why. I cannot sway.
[2:47:00] Oh, but deep down inside of me, when I
[2:47:04] hear God's word, my heart says
[2:47:11] I
[2:47:14] don't know how. Oh, I don't know how. I
[2:47:19] don't know why. I cannot explain. Oh,

[2:47:32] heart says,
[2:47:37] "Oh, I say, oh, that sounds real good."
[2:47:40] Let's just sing that once again. I don't
[2:47:42] know. I don't know how. Oh, I don't know
[2:47:46] why I cannot explain. Oh, the love of
[2:47:51] God in my soul. But deep down inside of
[2:47:55] me, it's been revealed to me.
[2:47:58] Oh, my heart says,
[2:48:02] oh, I say amen.
[2:48:06] When he speaks to me, I say amen. When
[2:48:12] he reveals his word to me, I say amen. I
[2:48:17] see him so clearly now. I say amen.
[2:48:22] He is real.
[2:48:25] I say amen.
[2:48:31] Hallelujah.
