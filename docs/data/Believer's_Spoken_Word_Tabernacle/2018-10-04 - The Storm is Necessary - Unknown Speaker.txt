these days we're gonna see him face to face and we will crown him the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and that manifestation is in our life right now think about him there is nothing that he has not already overcome there's not one devil that has not been defeated already and with greater that is he that is within you you have already overcome it's to recognize the king is within you amen end it wonderful tonight a man won Liberty as sons and daughters of God that we have to be able to worship the king amen you're looking forward to the word tonight amen we're so glad to have a man first of all the Lord Jesus here with us because really this wouldn't be much of a service if it wasn't for him but all how we are thankful for God's great bouquet of so many gifts that he has and the avenues and the approach you know why God didn't have to do it that way God could a guy who gave every minister a gift that would be the same way but that isn't God's Way God doesn't in an angle in a variety so it always comes back to one thing we're depending on him our dependence is not on a man it's on Jesus Christ and I'm glad that he's in our midst tonight aren't you and where the son of man is oh my all sorts of things will take place is that right when the son of man was right here walking among us it didn't stop the moving as a matter of fact the moving of the Spirit of God and moved from what was a shadow now to substance he's the same yesterday today and forever amen oh man and we're glad that brother Padre has come by our way and we so appreciate our brother hey man our brother

liberty tonight we want the Lord to have his way don't we amen there's no telling what can take place and what God can do but he'll do everything according to his word [Music] I'm sure I crossed over the line I'm so glad talk about the line that separates the darkness from the light I saw and I cross she across one more time [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey man praise the Lord that song is a revelation amen not that I'm going to cross over the line I crossed over huh amen I'm so glad about that you know this is a good time to be happy about what the Lord is doing in your life amen because if you can be sad and depressed Satan gets sweep you right out from under the presence of God amen so we're happy about what God is doing we think and praise the Lord for being here amen greeting from back home amen from Pastor Fernandez and all the saints of God and like brother Samuel said that blessed thing is that the Lord Jesus is here a man that's who we come to see I say we come to hear Amen let's just have a word of Prayer we appreciate all the songs of Zion we will have some prayer and then we're gonna get into the Word of God and maybe have a need you can acknowledge it by uplifted hand let's pray Lord Father we thank you tonight Lord and Lord to know that you remain forever faithful no look we have scripture Lord that we can use as a top pose such as Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever nor such as I'm the Lord and I changed not and Lord God we take those words in child bosom Lord and we live by them daily Lord and Lord God we're just asking you Father you would just continue Lord to form and shape us into the image of your mind Lord that is not our will to be done but your will and Lord however you see fit Lord to get us to that place Lord where we're perhaps your material Lord Lord where we are in the very likeness and image in which you created mankind to be Laura put a complete surrender in our lives Lord Lord that will follow as you lead will listen as you speak Lord and Lord God we just thank you so much Lord for the Amazing Grace the unmerited favor that you've given us long floor we can look around Lord and at times like these and services like this Lord that people are not even pressing out to come to church in it's becoming a battle and Lord was so thankful Lord that we tonight don't have to battle that issue we here Lord and Lord God we've come to hear from you in order to hear what you would say to us Lord forgive us our sins and trespasses on nor the areas in our lives Lord that no one else sees but you Father keep that precious blood of Jesus atoning in our lives father we pray that you would bless the service tonight Lord according to your will in the precious name of Jesus Christ we pray and church say Amen amen those you have your Bibles turn to Deuteronomy eighth chapter Deuteronomy eight praise the Lord you'd around me eight and then we're gonna go to the Book of Jonah and start reading that verse one Deuteronomy 8 and 1 if you ever say man all the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your father's and thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble the and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments or no and he humbly and suffered lead to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou Lewis not neither did I fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord love man lives Jonah chapter and we also want to start at verse 1 in the Book of Jonah and from there we're going to go to Psalm 77 Jonah chapter 1 verse 1 it says now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah and say I mean the son of a Midtown saying arise go to Nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me but Jonah rose up to flee unto Tosh's from the presence of the Lord and went down to Joppa and he found a ship going to tosha's so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto Tosh's from the presence of the Lord but the Lord sent out a great wind unto the see and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken a man Psalm 77 Psalms chapter 77 let's read verse 17 Psalm 77 and 17 the Bible says the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine arrow also went abroad the voice of thy Thunder was in the heaven the lightnings lightened the world the earth trembled and shook he made me a lord blessed to read of His Word you can have your seats tonight Amen everybody happy tonight amen praise the Lord I just kind of want to uplift for you tonight a man tonight by God's grace it may not seem like it with my topic but we're trusting in the Lord amen tonight by God's grace I want to use for a subject the storm is necessary amen the storm is necessary hallelujah you know one thing I'm learning to understand is that God he he doesn't do things the way we think it ought to be done amen but whatever God does he has a purpose behind it and you know in in times when we're going through things you know a lot of times we actually question why or why me you know or why am I going through this or what did I do you know you're a Christian there's a purpose behind it amen God is up to something amen and you know the devil thinks he's so smart cuddly but he's like I said like this Satan is only a tool in God's hands and it's smart and as shrewd as he is he can never get the jump on God perfectly he'll never catch God by surprise you never say God okay now you need to add some faith to them in the situation gods don't have to do that name Han because whenever you go through God is already prepared huh he's already giving you the goods he's already made away he's already praying for you the only thing you need to do is say no I believe and keep going forward hallelujah but you know in times where we're testing and we go through trials the human element gets in the way the human element we we begin to slow up and you know the first thing first things happen when we go through trials and tribulations let me let's get the church on the same record we ain't going to test somebody saying man we hate being tested but the only way for you to get to another level is to go to a test even the nuns out to rims you know without jobs and different things before you can be a nurse or a doctor you got to go through years of strenuous testing colors to be proven you can walk in that in that room and and say hey just don't mean nothing to me I can do this I know I can't have the ability and then say do you have a degree hallelujah did you pass the test hallelujah that's required for you to call yourself something a man and you know that's what God does God gives us spiritual test after test why because we got to be proven to be able to call ourselves the sons and daughters of God hurry everybody can't carry that label only those that have been proven can call themselves the children of God who you if you ain't been through nothing that means you ain't got no experience and the worst kind of person hallelujah to come and do something hallelujah the first time is a person with that experience all nervous all shook up and and hands shaking and everything else maybe it's a hot surgery you think that person want to do that if they haven't been proven no it's a very scary thing hey man and I'll say tonight huh Lia serving God can be very scary if you don't have any experience hariya but God gives us experiences so we can keep pressing amen and by those experiences hurry we'll be able to weather the storm oh yeah hey man but you know before I get going real good hallelujah let's talk about Jonah hey man you know Jonah you know we always look in the Bible and in the night when preaching I don't want us to to listen to the word and say well I know who that's for I know who that's for you know they go through this they going through that I'm talking to you tonight I'm talking to me tonight huh you know we spend so much time how do you taking the word and and using a shovel when we scooping it and throwing it over we're scooping it and throwing it to somebody we're scooping it and digging it deeper we need everybody need to put the shovels down the night and grab some ranks and pull everything to yourself hungry put it back to your chest through the mistakes to yourself pull the good to yourself pull everything about you to yourself and stop blaming the people you fellowship with [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because when we stand before God we all stand and say where Lord brother Samuel did this - that ain't gonna fly it the judgment because it's what you've done with the word that you've been hearing Amen you know what I hear people say all the time I had a family member tell me you say you know that's good you're going to church you in middle setting everything but I've seen too much you know for me to trust preachers she been through a lot of storms he's letting those storms affect whether God is true on that okay but I want you to understand tonight that the majorities of the storms that we go through the devil didn't cause them you are got a church in you honey lot of times we go through things that we say the devil does the devil that the devil does I want you to know the majority of your trials and tribulations come from God you can rejoice I rejoice for you that means if God is doing it hungry I've already got the victory because it promised me then I can bear [Applause] all right but the first thing we do we go through trials and tribulations who the devil does the devil that devil devil devil devil no stop prophesy the devil the devil beat me up the devil devil devil did you go get in prayer and you talk about the deli even more to God [Music] and what you think God doing why you there lifting up the devil are you opposed to be praying to him [Applause] the general in my children the devil in my spouse the devil on my job and God is sitting in listening you like he already knows where he created the devil for he wants you to understand that he's stronger than the devil oh yeah that he o my church look at the advantage we got amen you know right now it's football season and I know up here that's the fight call honey we were raised and Buckeyes those of y'all who try to like y'all know what I'm talking about shame oh I know you probably the first one sitting your house when nobody's looking with your will read sweat on or your book I had or whatever oh yeah and then you get to church when we start talking about natural teacher shake huh but you know her there are rivalries that that's all over the earth looks like we have a ride back home it's called honey titles and Gamecocks huh we have those riders that go from here to here it doesn't matter how many times this team wins that team that loses they said we'll get them next year and they start preparing her for the battling man they stop prepared they learn about whether they lost they are preparing to weenie oh yeah and you know what they do they go back and they watch the film honey what they started do they develop study habits they start to study their adversary they started you get the stars of the team we realize their strengths and their weaknesses cuz they want to stop that person from making everybody else great and sometimes God would attack somebody in your church that's leaves a child because that person has the ability to make you great you is like any like exterior here in this moment they say they say but what's the difference between uh uh get about LeBron what's the difference between Kobe and Jordan LeBron ain't even in the category Hutton if you really know what you really know what skill is running even there hey man I grew up in an air hose with a man defying gravity they had to put him on the back of a shoe [Music] Ronnie never change the game like that huh and Kobe was so bad they stopped calling him the black mama turn there before they had a game they had to prepare to how to stop these two men oh yeah but you know where they started studying and studying studying tape about these two people and everything they said about these two and said okay now we know it was great but what about these guys that made a team makes bad what about you tonight you bring it to the service that'll make this service that makes this service better or is it better yet you should even been here how is access question you say well I'm a son of God I'm a doing a god actual self this question can you miss Church for a week and nobody won the way you are you in trouble in your Christian representation on earth is very sad if you can be gone from a family this was supposed to be a family usually go missing hallelujah on the back and some people on the back of a milk carton even gone from turn so long missing have you seen them but you don't leaving me go Harley for a week or so and nobody even inquires where you are that speaks a lot about your Christian life that speaks a lot about the atmosphere behind you and brother Samuel preachers notice to be true because certain preachers Holly will you come certain places we have people that connect with your ministry and they automatically start to a man when those people not then service saying hey man they say I wonder what so-and-so else today I won't live how many of you are those kinds of people honey if you can just miss chances nobody wonder where you are but you weren't here and maybe brother Saturday say have you seen sister so-and-so today why because she's connected to that let's change clothes what is it about your life that makes this church pal hey man because the Bible says whatever gift we have whatever we are is he fine he's supposed to make somebody else's life better and some of us are so caught up in our own child old tribulation we don't even understand that God is using you because somebody's watching how you going through your store but you started talking about the devil the devil does to do it I'm sorry brothers y'all know I'm a walker camera someway but you know but you know Church will you think about storms deaths and all these things we go to you we need to realize that earlier even where we are right now those of us feel the Holy Ghost and coming to church faithful God ain't done with us let's deal more he won't out of us so he he he loves us to have victories and he allows us to have defeats honey because those are things honey are gonna remind us that God is victorious oh yeah because without the valleys you never know what a mountain experience is like you never appreciate the goodness of God the grace of God the mercy of God you have to have times where you are and out lord help me and we got to be thankful that we have a god that can hear your cries never Papa I brought a message called deep color to the deep it has to be a date to respond oh my church with some of us ain't storms right now but I want you to think about it the pastor you think the person that's aggravating you maybe God trying to get you to a place you know what blew me away the Prophet was in a stage in his life and he was we understand that God used the Prophet matter calculate man mighty use him mightily but then in other stage in his life the Lord came to him and told him if you be more sincere prayer lies blinded eyes covered over deaf deaf ears middle and God comes and tells him if you be more sincere you'll see even more than now I'm an eye that just listening to that I don't think that he wasn't sincere grabblings that there was a whole nother level they he hadn't reached her if that's too simple a whole nother plateau who they had even reached and God came and told him hey you oh yeah you need to be more sincere what did God do God start Holly putting him in position sucker yeah well he had to humble himself huh certain things had to happen different things had to take place why cuz he could talk to God that's why I read Deuteronomy he says hey remember how I led you these 40 years in the wilderness we say honey they were in the wilderness because all the backslidden believers that was that know the Bible says God led him there God took that turn remember he'll be led by a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day and whenever that town stop they stops whenever that that cloud move they move so who had them in the wilderness you what the devil is doing God said okay you gonna march out you for 40 years cuz you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get all this mess up the church some of us are still in the same positions we was last year you know what you still got mess in your life you find yourself going in circles in circles in circles until you get to a place where it's cleaned out you never get no victory huh and you know nowadays we come to church and this is not a rebellion you come to church and people not even excited anymore where's the excitement going to G are you looking at what's going on we have a Trump we have a president that fits the description of prophecy hooyah well at any time holier he has seen us enjoy nuclear war just to prove he can do it cuz you know he's a man that you can't tell him something he can't do here so you can do it nobody's saying all right mr. rocket man keep messing with me you're gonna wish you never had he's even thinking about the consequences of that but anyway I didn't go on that cuz I know we got some you got some Lovells in here but you don't matter me one I don't care who become the president nobody they fulfill the scripture I say Amen hey baby black blue green now you look like somebody from Star Trek say beam me up Scotty I don't care huh long as I can see the word being fulfilled I know where I'm standing oh yeah but you know God say I've led you I've led you here these 40 years honey I've led you here hurry first thing God wanted to do he's seen the storm this trouble hurry to Humble them huh first thing a child does God is trying to Humble us a man God want us to fall on our knees hallelujah and sometimes we don't even know what's wrong but God wants to get there and say Lord whatever I've done whatever I shouldn't have done lord help me to get it right the worst kind of attitude to have is a self-righteous attitude and you go to God no I'm a son I'm a daughter I don't deserve this how do you know what you deserve in God's eyes Paul said we die daily that must be we mess up every day so we need the blood in our lives never come to God self righteous holy prophet prophet try daddy pray for somebody died he said God you owe me an explanation he said don't you ever talk to God like that he said God let him sweat for about 3-4 weeks I even talked to him and then God came back and straightening my plug whoa what are you too much you too my something that hurt when God come and taking you out holy God come sit you and pointy spiritual finger in your nose what a certain feeling right that's it ponies finger and you'll know basically telling you ain't nothing I'm God can't you leave me sometimes God has to bring us back to reality hallelujah we're not the greatest gift given to mankind huh the greatest gift given to mankind he's Jesus Christ and we ought to be glad that we can serve him 32 Jesus but you know Church hallelujah you know trials come and say hey I want humble you indeed said he say you know what I'm gonna do he said I want to prove you you so you let tests and trials come to preview a man who to the death to all your pretties that thought you gonna backside all the people that thought that the message wasn't true and it couldn't change your life God say I'm gonna prove you I will prove that the Holy Ghost is real imma prove that healing is real imma prove that salvation is real imma prove that delivers is real goddess in a storm cuz he's spitting in the spirit to rim oh you looking at the Devils they see watch this and you stand on the word they say to whom shall I go you say to all your critics ain't going nowhere you say to your doctor I still believe that he's a healer even if I don't get healed on the side [Applause] oh my he's that want to prove prove you and then he comes until the children is your I did just to see what was really in your heart that's why God allows stores you know the greatest example one of the greatest example one of the greatest storms ever was the still not not not Florence not just one that just came y'all y'all thinking down south Florence as a bad start well it was for some people outstanding care along we didn't get touch all we got is a little bit of wind little bit of rain so tell us that breeze was nice did somebody else it was horrendous honey so you can see somebody going through something and you can judge it by your own experiences oh boy I can imagine what you're going through and they might be impressed and lord I thank you for your grace no I'm just I'm just I'm touched remember they they beat up Paul and they do that now Paul II beat up disciples and they do the mouth and they just a cell phone they start giving God praise and they praise the Lord we got beat up in the name of Jesus my every book they give God praise they said it was happy that they received persecution in the name of Jesus first and that's the attitude we ought to have when we're going through a storm hello but these storms are necessary earlier you know in choosing their Israel honey they had to go through all of that because God had to team the crowd down hallelujah so the faithful ones would have a story to tell hallelujah remember how he had to take them a certain way they had to be there hurry to see the Red Sea standing in the mist hurry but the believers got a story to tell they telling children holy how Pharaoh was chasing you they came out easy and God him the way of the Red Sea he wasn't Moses are you it was gonna lead to church and I'm here to say today honey if you got a Holy Ghost feel pastor standing behind that sacred death it ain't him Luton is gone reading him you know Moses get to the spot where the storm is so bad yeah you know what blows me away honey one thing about storms they're gonna be a big old category whatever five but when that thing hit land it breaks off into other stars and sometimes we have issues in our lives we have storms in our life carnal storms in our life and we don't deal with them they break off into other things and because of that word situation now you got other things happening in your life because you didn't deal with the store huh so you got to allow God hallelujah to deal huh to show you what to do in the midst of a storm the best thing you can do heylia in a storm is hath not to stop that's the worst thing you can do you know I see people when I be driving I Drive all the time storm coming they pull it over my mind said I'm like hey if I'm coming if I'm coming to uh Lorraine or sheffield wherever I'm at right here and I'm coming here I'm always South Carolina and Israeli in South Carolina ain't stopping because my hope my faith is get it ain't raining the whole way up there so I'm gonna keep driving hallelujah so I'm naked in the area where the Sun is shot but I gotta keep going in the midst of my stole hallelujah because even when is raining the Sun is still out oh yeah but storms are necessary oh my oh let me speed up a little bit Church when we looking we look right here in Deuteronomy how we see that the Lord said I did this to prove you to Humble you the show it was in your heart and God had already told them that I've given you the promised land but you got to go through these stores huh you got to fight yeah huh you got you got to be out there with all these unbelievers who who are in the church and they worshipping other gods he says doing all this to humble improve you hallelujah and then those see when you come through a storm you got a different attitude Hollis Chuck everything we need is already in the scripture and you take Joshua and Caleb those boys were in some some hard storms I mean they were in a storm when it looked like holy the Prophet was gold anyway and Josh was saying ain't going nowhere till you come back and we got those kind of people right now huh still waiting on the Prophet to come back but then you had somebody like a Caleb Polya who believed that message hallelujah who was a warrior a man but his attitude was a little different a man he said I was I was 40 years old I first called me honey and I'm just as strong now as I was dead honey what was speaking experience was speaking earlier he's fought many battles are you not caleb is in position where he happened to other young people go get a mountain nice edifying the body huh now he's helping one another a man he's come to his storm and he's realized the script to say trouble don't last always huh but spawns come so that God can come on scene I hope she turn the Testament sister windy right here she just came out of a store yeah sisters wind is from Hong Kong and her family is in Hong Kong she's she one of us now she'd been here a long time no matter fact she's going to school and Carolina where I'm from but you know the Lord led her up this way when she got witness too hard and she's been a long time honey but you know what just recently since the wind it normally takes vacation and go back and see her family three weeks vacation you know she's been on a job a long time honey and you know this year she already took to eat two weeks of it and she said I got this last week I'm gonna spirit my family it's not a Hong Kong gonna be my family so when it came time to set things up for that last week the boss said no oh you got it three days she said what three days storm start for me she said no no I always stand the policy I always get three weeks she said well things have changed and as of now you only get three days boom got a little darker she says no I think um you know I've been here so many times that you know I always get this every year and a boss like look we under new management now it's thundering we own the new management and and that's it and you just forget about it it's just a windy saying I need you to come on the scene so she goes back one more time she goes back one more time to the boss and she says and I'm paraphrasing some of you can go access to windy for all the details first thing you can do and tell me your testimony cuz imma tell it I'm gonna tell it if God gave you some victory that belongs to us that blows up somebody need to hear that God is still on the job God is still the supervisor God is still controlling vacation and sick time and raises and promotion God is still on the job Dargis dig your 40-hour check when you ain't got number three days begin you know well that done then come like that some people get scared they stop close their windows go sit in a corner fear worst thing you can have in a storm is fear she emails the boss one more time she says something to the effect now what are we gonna do bout my vacation time and boss is like she's already told him no at least two times already this last time boss got real direct I thought we already talked about this that was it in the email that was almost a hurricane now it's just the wind he comes to church and she's all broken cuz she won't go see her family but she know God is able oh yeah so she brings her situation to the altar and you know what she says to me when we praying she said this may seem kind of silly but I want a vacation time I wanna go see my family no that's why he's called Jehovah holy God indwells with his family oh yeah God is a family man huh yeah so you only do see your family is definitely in the will of God because God is a family man hallelujah Hey so we prayer by oh yeah we pray about her getting that time I say Lord let something happen hurry where she get her time oh yeah she said holy Sh with the word hallelujah I think was Tuesday when they work Tuesday hallelujah the CEO on a couple of new balls come flying in hurry who meets the new boss sister Whitney somebody gonna hit me huh I'm going to see my booth and I space safe doesn't give up hallelujah Saints fans firm on what you believe her you st. has a long-range station holy and the Boston help us ladies saying I can't approve so sister Whitney goes over her head sometimes you need to fly above the storm that's where he goes below she starts talking to the CEO he says she said this is a this is a text to me she says he she explains the situation to him and the CEO says hey that's a no-brainer you got your other week I don't care who's saying what you got your other week now go change the ticket so you can go see you he's still the same guy tonight hurry I'll tell the church see honey that was necessary then she go through that storm so those of you in here tonight got problems on your job honey you had to hear that testimony so you know that God is still able she's happening people's lives some friends of mine I don't know if I told the testimony about there's a baby in it huh a man he was some friends of mine in London they were trying to have a baby for 10 years honey since that miscarriage at the miscarriage so the pastor got anointed he didn't know what to tell her so God told him talk to the husband and whenever this issue of a baby comes up you tell him when your wife talks about the baby you say there's a baby in there switch to the hospital gotta know at home she took a pregnancy test came back natives he looked at and saying there's a baby in here touch can you believe God when that's nothing to believe in [Music] can you believe God when the storm is hailing hallelujah he says disobey be in it you know Church they wonder and the wife was like she goes to the plastic past I don't want something dead inside of me I've been through this over and over again he told the husband you tell her there's a baby in it she goes to the hospital take a pregnancy test the nurse come back and you know the song is my problem why they always bring you bad news with a smiley face she took a pregnancy test nurse come on smiling you ain't bringing closer looks at the nurse looks at his wife and he says there's a baby in here right in the nurse face hey can you testify by God's goodness right when the devil look like he got you huh right will you're backing up against the wall can you still say God is able we didn't look like everything is falling apart can you still say my god real profile is what does he say I'm the Lord and I changed not that means oh yeah if he gave oh yeah oh baby to bear inhaler he has to do it again to somebody else if he gave a baby for Baron Sarah he has to do it again he said there's a baby in there they go back home now I want you to keep in mind honey she's in the time zone with her cycle is coming honey but every test she take his negative so she maybe took another pregnancy test came back negative husband walk over to there's a baby in it and it seemed ridiculous honey but you know what some people pulling over in the storm did you put your wipers on fast ain't gotta pull over I got some way to be honey yeah I got I got on weather tires huh we don't make it

to say whether you weak or not is a lot this human church whatever the devil can say to you is a loss he can't tell the truth so he come to you and tell you you don't follow you say you are lying because you tell you not a Christian you say you a liar you come and say you ain't got the Holy Ghost you say you a liar you say you say you ain't got no figure you say devil you are a liar he can't tell the truth oh hey stones come for purpose they're necessary in this innocence this is this nurse she looks at the wife she says honey I'm sorry but you're not pregnant husband is on the side now the nurse gets real sneaky she's been there all that time and she tells the wife honey trying to whisper devil in a little whisper oh you're the word slender me slender me silently whispering that's what Satan is he's old he's a slender on whisperer he not a nurse to the nurse she didn't already told you ain't pregnant what's the same one honey he didn't owe her a tattoo time there's a baby in it and now she comes and she thinks she gonna help the situation she said she gonna help the storm out you can't help me in my store I got to go through it all I need you to do is pray unless I get stopped and you got the vehicle to pull me out honey and sometimes we get stopped and that's when you need to sit a word honey you need to call that person up and say brother sister I'm praying for you huh hook me up and pull me out of the mud hallelujah you know nurse comes over there everybody all right you know I know sometimes we only have 45 minute we should be so far beyond that nowadays

identify yourself with that victory what about church do you identify yourself with the victory what victory Jesus went down inhale hallelujah he took the speed from the devil of death hell and the grave holy you defeated cancer diabetes high blood pressure he defeated depression and we are connected to that victory as you don't want me to dance in your church well I'm sorry [Applause] come on somebody Jesus did it but I was there I got something to shout about earlier some of us need to be like the blind man oh yeah ask him how old I know I once was blind but now I see that he's gonna go axe him go ahead god I did it huh hey Briggs how you remain saved when you go up the old storm I tell you go ahead God are you doing it oh I feel resurrection power in the brain somebody to reach up and grab your blessing holy she wants something right now hurry some people don't like it in a storm the greatest thing about being in the storm is visibility huh it's sometimes in a storm huh you got rain I'm gonna tie some stuff you got rain coming down in the midst of a storm rain is a type of the annoying King maybe God trying to get you to catch the anointing for your life in the midst of the storm honey next thing you may have in the storm is Thunder huh Thunder tax the voice of God dog funny but you know the part I like that so misunderstood every good good good storm huh and I don't has rings and I don't have thunder but that's lightning and what happens when that lightning come home that lightning makes everything dark holy in exposing holy real that lightning hit her and what you couldn't see when I lighten his you can see where you're going in Holy Church we got lightning in this church we not only got the rain of thunder we got the lightning Oh church we got something to look forward to we spend too much time in church you know in our own human ability saying give me something I never heard before brother bring bring me out a good thought what good is that when you can't rejoice in what you already know I said we should be resistant I you reading scripture and a period you know before the game even get started they start singing they are my mother huh you know we can hear we need to have in our spirit there's no God like Jehovah oh yeah we didn't have every praise is to our God we need to come in here under 19 the rain goes the Thunder gonna come but I need that lightning hug to show me where I'm at huh and if you ever get stuck by lightning you will never be the same some people get hit by lightning they die that's what we need more of in church some people need to get hit by lightning spirits on lightning so they can die to their beliefs I'm sorry I need to come out so close but but but it's it's amazing to me brother Samuel why is it so hard for us to worship God in church this is our ground [Music] seyton ain't got no right holding this up what do you do is he come in here you come to church and you put up yellow yellow tape I don't want no shouting so all the way back here and we follow the devil up we come here with a way you know it's just gonna be a regular service who told you that I know God ain't told you that Satan won't seem to be a regular service to you but you know every time we get together hurry the supernatural can take place it don't have to be a special meeting you know had to be a three-day weekend huh when you believe that's when it can happen that's when it can happen when you believe and when you believe the CEO said let me jump on a plane let me confirm a thing but anyway don't get nervous I'm about to close a nurse honey she comes out and she says I'm sorry honey you're not pregnant you've been saying there's a baby in there nursed and heard that a couple times so he over here nurse trying to get real sleep then we'll try to whisper to say hey you're not pregnant and don't listen to your husband cuz all we gonna do is discourage you but you know we talk about how high eagles fly you know Eagles can also hear good and she thought because he was over there he couldn't hear her honey and she tried to saw a seed of doubt he went right over there and he said there's a baby in there oh yeah if Satan is whispering to you tonight telling you that I'll try to work up your emotions you need to tell that Whisperer shut up devil I was believing to Russia I was born to worship and better yet hurry better yet the pocket already solving over they here already so me beyond the curtain of time streaming out saying we were resting on that shut up devil victory is mine I will overcome victory is mine in the name of Jesus Christ God allows the storms to come cuz it's working for your good sometimes those storms come with a heavy heavy pole why stop the drop and sometimes we need services like this honey where the Spirit is hi honey so those people who are Sunday Christians when they come they'll be wondering what in the world happening here Thursday night it was a soaking rain hallelujah and we come to church he's still wet colors we still stepping on it oh yeah he's on your shoes hallelujah that's what it was a good part out then the good kind of storm surge hallelujah her with storms come and they fly the area we want the Holy Ghost to fly this area tonight [Applause] stalls are necessary make a long story short I need to come down reason why where Jonah he told Jonah when she go to Nineveh crowd I guessed that great wicked city and Jonah and his mind he's like they don't deserve it they don't deserve it I ain't hang on God they didn't do too much eye wink God made us to jela Jeter jealous and sometimes we don't witness the people because we think they're gonna reject but we got to tell her but if God telling you to speak you ought to speak cuz he gonna back you up hallelujah oh yeah and you know Jonah ain't no going down to Joppa pay my ticket I'm going to holler you're toxis and he thought it was over but you know what blows me away but Samuel will look at people like like Jonah and we say Oh Sir Percy Baxley need not the message remember God says the storm huh you know sir I don't make my comments on people when they when they leave or they do whatever that's between them and God know is he's keeping me anchored I'm good I continue to pray for that person but it ain't mine it ain't my calling to be the challenge I'm like God you be merciful - and a lot of times harder people can realize they made a mistake but they don't come back because of how we handle them when they left no Jonah gets in the boat and he we look at John say go back slaughter brother Brown said you want her back slide on the back side he was in the will of God you say buddies come on how was he in the will of God I'm gonna give you one of the closest examples that he was in the will of God remember the Bible says and God to win the storm was necessary yeah it wasn't the devil doing it huh it was one of his children hardly on that boat and God had to send a message telling so he beginning to stir up the travels ho getting a mess up the tickets and all these things just to get his servant to pray and sometimes gotta do things like that just to show you he still hears your prayer hallelujah God I caused a storm so you can follow your knees and desperation just so he confirmed to you that you are still a child of God Jones on the boat God since the storm so much to catch John one Maxine listen storm came the marinas they start looking at each other you know what did you do what's going on they go to wake up Jonah in the midst of a storm now this is the question how could Jonah have peace in the midst of a storm he's actually the only other person that was on a boat that slept in the midst of a storm was the Lord Jesus Christ so he was out of the will of God how could he ever be a type of Christ in that moment he was a type of price shipping on the boat in the midst of a storm I don't know about you when I'm out of the will of God I can't sleep if I wasn't messed up I can't get no rest but the Bible say Jonah was fast asleep sleeping good now I don't sound like a man out of the will of God to me now don't bring an uncertain sound or what I'm saying and there's some people that do things and they just don't have no conviction I ain't talking about that huh Jonah had conviction but you notice God sent a storm hey everybody on the boat all uptight and they begin to say we're gonna roll away we go get John hey y'all throw me overboard hey man we can't do this we care about you we can't do you know me oh listen to the words coming out of my mouth throw me overboard sometimes God has to speak to us like that like we don't understand what he's saying joe said to me we said no we gonna throw your boy out yeah and the waters got worse who made the waters worse God Joe say tie me up don't be a boy there's a purpose for that storm it was a bigger purpose than Jonah I want you to go back and read it Jones I don't the boy they do Jonah overboard once they threw him overboard the storm ceased what happened after that the men on the boat Saturday knees and they started offering sacrifice to God they started worshipping God and they made a vow to God if Jonah would've never been on that boat that wouldn't never happen so sometimes in the midst of your storm there are people that God want to get to but the only way you can get to them is if you go through a storm oh yeah there are people in your family that's watching your life hallelujah and by yo storm they may be saved [Applause] because Jonah was on that boat those mean how do you cry like the god holy offered sacrifice and they worship dollar if Jonah Willis went straight to the elevat-- God would have never got those men back so sometimes there are people in your path that God is trying to get you and the only way he can get to them is if you go through something and you don't even know what he's doing but God is setting it all up honey God already had a special preparing fish there hallelujah go ahead God I'm worried about Jonah he had everything hooked up for Jonah he was worried about those meal Aleppo and the choosing a little thing you say oh say my wife say my husband stole no I say for children stole sometimes it's how you go through it dictate whether they come to it cuz they watching you you the one go around here to my joke are real did you put you in position to prove it and God God is so wise honey now he had two agendas the middle of the boat he took care of him honey put Jonah in the fish honey now this fish that has no brain to comprehend it doesn't have a GPS or map in his hand some kind of way it stays like there three days long enough for Jonah to get his heart right God is so good to the nightlife what why my garden is just low don't worry everything is gonna work everything is gonna man down God is doing he's doing something so unbelievable he gonna blow your mind there's a guy Liza taking this loan he's working everything out he came towards us enough time 3 that he crying out now he's back in profit status storm was necessary honey demanding repentance is only the joining the fish Hollow he's in the fish's belly fish fish don't know nothin hold the fish no he's supposed to go swallow man [Music] now let me ask you a question from that time how many times have you ever heard about a fish smaller than me you heard him bite no man but this was a special fish swallow Jonah Holly hey man the storm was necessary honey in church oh now I will show you how powerful disease now cuz we know when storms happen normally the fish don't get washed up on shore cuz they know what's going on they go a different direction honey because they're connected with nature office this fish stayed in the storm it didn't run for his life oh yeah it's instinct totally circle around this boat stay right here huh Leah and your dinner is gonna come in the form of a man I will change Oh daya today I want you to tell the devil if the devil saying you don't deserve it I want you to tell the devil God can do what you wanna do [Applause] [Music] if God will bless us God can do what you wanna do say don't you tell me I don't deserve it I decide what god bless me with fish scoops him up stays I did by truth a half is is that this swimming so John can get his alright now Jonah back in profit moles Lord how to look to all the temple he's in prayer more than everything I did all of a sudden the fish gets to a certain spot where he's starting to feel sick and he ain't gonna go to the bottom and die he's gonna go to the shore the storm was necessary and God is wisdom honey and everything set up because he knew that the people of Nineveh worship the fish God and not this big old fish hurry follows up a God throws of a god named Jonah proclaiming holy the Lord of lords and the king of kings this man comes with a message not talking about the fish God but talking about the God of God the strong was necessary church that meeting was the greatest revival ever recorded by one man besides the Lord Jesus Christ I think it was over 250,000 people repented from that message a storm is necessary what is God trying to do in your storm I know we said a lot of things but I want you to realize there's a purpose it's necessary God so Joseph and he was a sheep his brothers bowed down to him his mom and Daddy bowed down to her honey but how he got to that point he had to go through a storm holy cow patia his brothers being jealous of him was necessary huh his God is daddy giving him that special made coat that was necessary why because they started up the spirit of jealousy it wasn't the devil making him jealous who was it God knew exactly what was gonna happen Don say you know what I want you to make that boy's special coat cause it's gonna round your brother's up and Joseph need to get to the throne storm was necessary honey he goes ahead Joseph my boy boy I just love you trying let's go you try that : throw him in the pit we don't get rid of him you just wait one day we gonna get when Dad it around we're gonna get rid of no spirit of jealousy who allowed that to come and Joseph skip it it was necessary honey cuz he had to be bought into slavery to get the part of us out and then hot air particles wife look at hey big boy how you doing come on I want to eat lunch with you that lust demon was necessary Oh cuz Joseph had to show the devil holy that lust had no power over him it was necessary huh so I could be written in the Bible so a young man could see honey that God is greater than us he wiggle out his clothes and run from her next thing you know she tell allow them that allow was necessary why so he can get locked up not in a jailhouse running a jailhouse oh the gift didn't stop the storm didn't change who he was say I said this the other night huh look I thought storm goes in to tell everything but when that storm leaves an apple tree is still an apple tree the storm don't change the seed oh yeah hey no matter how hard it broke no matter what category it is hurry when the storm is over an apple tree is still an apple tree and when the Sun shines he's gonna produce apples although working oh good he's in jail running the jailhouse hurry because the wife didn't own up that was necessary why because he had to meet the bacon the butler why because they had a dream a man hug and you had to hear that dream hallelujah and he not only that he had to get forgotten sometimes we're going through things and feel like God don't hear our prayer but God just want to see if you're gonna remain faithful Lulu you you want to see if you gonna remain faithful no joke joseph state is running the jailhouse huh and then you know certain things happen hug one of them head get cut off and the other one go back to what they were doing and then next thing you know pharaoh has a dream remember the bacon but Lana dream Joseph interpreters in those dreams was necessary so that the one that was gonna be restored he could go back with the testimony to be able to tell honey the king that there's a man in your jailhouse tapes why are you going to your store earlier no matter what you're going through tonight when you get home I want you to look at your mirror and you say you know what devil God is in control boo devil I said boo devil booty back bhudev Oh you thought it was over you quit when I say boot elbow I ain't going nowhere cuz God is in control Pharaoh has a dream he tell us to the but I believe the butler tends to the butler buzzing I remember my mistake there's a man in your jailhouse that can interpret dreams so it was necessary that Joseph didn't already get delivered the dreams and everything had to take place so that not only when he's exhausted he's exhausted above anybody else because he's not just gonna be huh an advisor he's gonna be adviser to the through basically haruya god had to do it in such a way where Joseph can run the kingdom had people saying bow the knee Joseph is come the store was necessary so that the people could see God behind skin a man that could tell what's gonna happen in seven years to come and in seven years after it was necessary oh yeah you don't want to say it like this but it was necessary for brother Branham to lose his little baby huh it was necessary that he lose his wife huh because if God would have done that we would have never heard this message come on musicians I'm closing I'm closing come on there's a lot of things that have taken place turkey honey it was necessary that I got cancer in my brain so I could go all around the world and testify that God is a healer the devil don't get no credit God allowed me to go through it so I can tell my god still remains to be true it was necessary for me to get brain cancer select doc I get glory I hope you looking at your storm different I hope you're looking at a different Church David said in Psalms 119 he said it was

trying to close that was one storm where they were on the boat and the Bible says water was in the boat now and then here comes Jesus walking on the storm was necessary so that somebody holy might know how they could turn h2o solid that's what he did huh whew the purpose of that stall to show Peter and the disciples that you can walk on water if you keep your eyes on Jesus tell me what else came out of that did anything else come out of that no God wants to show them that you can control the store another place that woke him up I lose they disturb him he got up he said peace be still did

to enjoy him you know something you enjoy you don't you don't worry about time and honestly tonight when brother cadre was ministering and then he talked about coming to the end I felt like he just got started and that's the truth you know sometimes we have to recognize friends that sometimes and I'm not just talking those here but those on streaming as well to recognize God is not confined to time sometimes we can get so much in our mind to where this has to be done in a certain time and you got to know this in a certain time in you and how do you know it may not be that God is testing your patience to see will you praise him will you worshipping will you hold on how do you know and I say oh my every opportunity that we have it ought to be an opportunity to worship Him let go we sing that song so often let go and let God have his way but you know what that's the real reality when we're willing to let go God moves in such a wonderful way how many you know that's the truth those testify even from brother Randy's the church it's the same way once you let go and let God move you know what God doesn't have to have numbers all God needs his lives that are surrendered to him that love his appearing and love for him to move boy it's easy to preach after this but you know the reality if we look at something we can become so selfish we can be say I've only come for the word we'll remember the word is not a letter the words a person we have overcome that trinitarian devil we don't look at and say wow we don't need the moving of the Spirit if you don't need the moving of the spirit then you don't need the word because the spirit and the word are one are you with me we are they are one we need the moving of the Spirit of God as he moves to confirm the word that right God comes right behind right in the worship right through the word and he comes and has worth standing there how many times we're here on tape where the Rebbe says less water this word to come less water it less water the word that come oh my I tell you what I just I believe that God has spoke to our hearts tonight I believe that with all my heart now you know someone might look at that and say well that ain't deep preaching it's deep I'll tell you what right now that is the Seventh Seal moving through your life and a trial we can preach that on down that that's what it is see it's the uncovering of that mystery of Christ all the way as it was through Joseph and I'll tell you what it just so struck my heart back there how many times that we've you've read the story you heard the story how many times we've preached on it but back there in that time lord have mercy it just sparked just inspired my heart the path to fulfillment it was not a path that any of us would have chose we would not have chose this pathway as far as within our own self but thank god there's a seed of God on the inside of us that's been quickened that's the real you and me on the inside and that real son and daughter of God it yields to the paths of God's fulfillment there's no way we would have chose these things Joseph wouldn't have chosen if Joseph would have known what that coat of many colors are gonna do he would have returned it he would have looked on a receipt 30-day return policy and returned it no there's too much trouble I don't I don't need that wheat but you know what God knew exactly he was doing you know what it brings us to such a reality you know the whole thing that God was speaking once again to us over and over of all these avenues rest rest I'm over this and they're wonderful when the disciples after they'd already been filled with the Holy Ghost then when Herod and the rest of them started coming against him they got up there in the upper room they got up there again gathered together and they began to pray and they said Lord thou art the Almighty God not the creator of heaven and earth you know they begin to recognize this is not about Herod they put God above gods above this situation I tell you what my goodness you see these kind of things like this how the Lord speaks to our heart it'll give you more strength to fight the devil then if you got eight hours of beauty sleep this right here will cause you to get up in the morning before your arm gets off yes sir you're ready I mean you're charged and ready to go you know why because God Himself has spoke to that part of himself on the inside and that part on the inside of himself has heard him tonight and raised up above all other voices and has been encouraged and strengthened and he said let's go were there were there don't you love the Lord hmm oh my I'll tell you what we so appreciate how God spoke to us tonight this word every one of us can identify I'm sure Lord you spoke to me tonight and you know I'm glad he does that he loves me he loves you he lets us know that any wonderful amen brother Wang would you come and dismiss us in a word of Prayer oh my I'm so glad we want to say we but the cadre we're gonna hold our brother in prayer so thankful for the gifts that God has placed within his life amen and the cotton no matter where you go can we just hope I lift our hands
