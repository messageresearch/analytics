uh last week I may have to extend it into the following week I'm not sure but I wanted to give the young people those that were at the camp and opportunity if they'd like to give a testimony and I think that uh had at least one that responded and so we'll uh wait and I know that there's some that's not here this morning but I want to just say is if all you wanted to come you can go ahead and take that mic I want to just say just a wonderful time I don't I really can't recall last week when I stood here we had kind of went through some things and I think there's been others it's battled with some sickness and things and I think sometimes it seems like when you come back from a a meeting like that and different things and like God's grace I didn't get sick but I just said you know the enemy's just upset and I know there were others but you know you know that different ones that had felt a little sick and things like that but God is so faithful amen so we just just so thankful to see and hearing the different testimonies that had come in from the camp already and just some different ones that even that I had received even there personally and so I just want to give any and if there's anyone after Paul that would like to go you just have to make yourself ready for that go ahead amen amen praise the Lord amen good to be the house Lord isn't it praise God Amen well uh mine's very uh mine's very short very simple but uh you know you just have to forgive me I've kind of been battling sickness lately and it probably was from Camp maybe a little bit a little bit run down I guess but we just but we just had such a a wonderful time in the Lord at the camp and uh that's the prince of God just really coming down strong and uh for myself you know myself I've been kind of struggling with a lot of things lately and uh battling a lot of different things and just want to know if really that God was with me the whole time and um and uh they at the at the camp they had brother Nathan had a um had a session uh for 21 and up he had it in a little room somewhere over in the I think next to the dining hall and uh he had different ministers different ones spoken you know I think Dad he also spoke there too and brother Oglesby and uh for myself you know I'm kind of in a point in my life with college and different things you know where to go what to do with my life you know it's a very very pivotal time you know and so I just uh you know I had a lot of questions and everything's with purpose and uh it just uh it's just amazing you know just a lot of different things I've been praying about and just really thinking on and uh and over in the 21 year old session they had a brother Oglesby had opened up with purpose he opened up he talked about it and uh it's just a lot of questions I had you know that were answered and and even uh and and of course when you know it you know Dad he talks about the same thing I mean it's like they didn't even share notes or anything they just were all you know just you know it just it was just they all follow the mind of the Lord and uh and I went through the prayer line uh the other night and I just uh said Lord you know I don't know you know I have a need but you know of course I couldn't I couldn't say what it was I didn't know how to say it or really be honest with you you know I don't know if you all ever been there or not but you know you just like well I'll just I'll just I'll go through and you know I'll just I Lord I've needed you and and uh they were just the you know brothers are praying so I was just praying just believing and you know and brother Wayne you know and said something to me and uh brother brother Steve caressel I think he had said somebody said like you know just got easy just pray for me say Lord God bless my brother Lord Lord he said brother he's said brother he's never left you he's never left you so I'm just I was just so glad about that just so thankful for that praise God amen you know he's just with me all he's just been with me I know it just for my life no for all of our Lives he's been with us all the way and he managed to continue to be with us and I was just uh you know for myself you know it may not have the results may not happen you know all the way maybe through the night but it's just continued to just just continue to go on you know I just been starting to see results this all through my life from that night and there was one day at work I mean for myself you know I always sing all the time wherever I go it's not just here I mean it's everywhere it's at home at my job you know I'm passing selling chicken just singing away I just don't care where I'm at I'm just gonna have church I don't have I'm just gonna have a good time and there was one I think it was the Tuesday I got back home and uh I was just I was just having a good time I started singing a song that brother Andrew Spencer uh sang at the choir and I just really started singing I started dancing started getting the moves and all that and one of the one of the one of the customers out there they said you know you're not just happy you got joy she said you Joy that's different than happiness so I thank God for that just thank God for touching me and hey man just uh so looking forward to what he has in store amen so thank you it's good to testify so just really quick not like a huge testimony I mean it is kind of for me but different complexes I had carried throughout my life when I was like a young middle teen I don't want to get into what those were obviously for obvious reasons but um it was things that just the devil had told me a bunch of lies about whether it was you know just a lot of different things in my life where things happened in my life where disappointments discouragements happened but you know God's really been working in my life and I can see I can look back to a Time like one example is when brother Andrew Spencer was preaching and he said you know the devil's been fighting you and he's been battling you he's like but you're but you walk through the door didn't you and I stood up and I started you know clap my hands worshiping because I realized that there was a point in my life where I wouldn't have wanted to be at a camp meeting like that and that changed for me and to even being the type of involved in the type of ministry and to respond to the ministry the way I was able to at that weekend that was incredible to me because again that was a complex I had built and I just you know Lord Set Me Free I believe and because I went through the prayer line one of the things that brother uh Joe Adams was talked to me about was he he came up I was coming through the line and then he grabbed me and he said I said you forget all those complexes and I I talked to him earlier that day but I don't know if it was the discernment of the Lord because I I didn't mention anything about different ways in my mind was working on certain things but I just was an awesome meeting I'm just thankful to God for his work in my life [Applause] amen so Camp um just a lot of things you know like byc he got the Holy Ghost you know but at twt I was just you know hoping for a refilling you know and uh I was just you know praying you know and uh he just ah I just started just confessing that I had a refilling and then I just felt that fire in my soul so God still refills amen [Applause] I should have and I realized that uh even if we got back from byc um and I realized that this morning that I I thought oh my goodness and even after last week I thought man I didn't even allow time for for testimonies and that's just uh not that I don't believe in them I do believe in them but sometimes my mind the way that I operate is just a one-track mind and that's just not when I stand Here on a Sunday morning but even throughout the week sometimes my wife will catch me you should say are you there and you know the things you're studying you're praying about and it's just you get into a vein of a channel and I don't say that to make myself anything it's just that's just how I am I've talked to other brothers and know some of my buddies and things like that they can kind of get into a little bit of a discussion I said look I'm not even going down that track to get into discussion on this and post this and I said because I get into a vein and I don't want nothing taking me from that vein nothing and I said I don't even I said for me it's just like somebody sends me something or whatever more I don't go look at it watch it read it or whatever right away I just I wait and then there comes a time that I can do that but I just want to say I appreciate the testimonies I know that little Aaron wasn't here and anybody else that wants to give a testimony anyone well I don't say anyone but but there was from Camp even though I know others have testimonies as well too so I got to preach sometime here this morning but I think it'd be good with no doubt we need to have a testimony service and so I apologize for not having that laid out and may the Lord help me and my wife my my personal secretary she's the one that really helps me and reminds me and uh this post to note today I actually wrote that on my own usually she has my Post-It notes waiting on me and so I appreciate that because she knows I need that help within that so I just want to say I'm so thankful to see what God is doing and you know it's funny because uh well I could talk a lot more you know within just seeing what God has done from byc and then in twt I'll tell you what it's just some powerful services and what God has done in in the services there and so we just thank God for a life-changing God God is still moving God is still changing lives and God knows exactly what we have need of Amen so I think it's one of those things where I look at it with the the youth and the and the young people I believe brother Brahm says every generation deserves a fresh chance at the word of God and and I think of it in in this way that um you know God has sent a word in this hour that's for for all of us it's for every age and that word comes to bring a real change and a real Liberty in our lives that's the same Lord Jesus Among Us and to me it's nothing to me I Get No Greater Joy than to see lives that have just been set free and God takes a hold of that life and we're just so grateful for that and uh so we just want to say God bless you this morning I want to also greet the visitors amen God bless you amen sister Linda sister Kylie amen God bless you all for being here I know was there anybody else you greeted as a visitor okay brother Mark sister Doris well they're not visitors but yeah you're you're here but we're glad we're glad you're here amen and we're glad to have you here in the house of the Lord with us and now so glad to be together if we could let's just stand and we'll change the order of the service here this morning let's go to uh in our Bibles to Titus Chapter 2. foreign in here Titus Chapter Two Can I have a little bit more in this monitor please Titus Chapter 2 and I want to begin reading it verse 11 I'd like to just be able to pick up if the Lord will help us from last week and just to continue on this thought on Grace appearing amen make let's just look to him in a word of prayer before we read Heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are Lord to be gathered together once again Lord in your presence Lord and to hear from you father Lord we thank you for every testimony thank you for what you're doing Lord in the lives of your people Lord I know that God that even Lord right here Among Us Lord there are many things sometimes Lord that aren't always visible but lord it's the things that God that you are doing Lord inwardly Lord it works its way out Lord as your Prophet Lord was so clear to speak to our life to speak to us Lord that Healing Begins on the inside Lord you know each of our needs Lord you know every life Lord and we pray that God that you'll just come Lord by our way this morning in a special way Lord may you come minister to our hearts Lord and just help me Lord that I can just be able to step aside and step out of the way oh God that you can just deliver Lord that which Lord that you Lord desire Lord to speak to our hearts Lord father from the Time Lord that's given Lord of studying and just meditation and prayer but Lord You're the same God who gave the inspiration and the Direction Lord for the thoughts Lord and we ask that you come Lord here this morning Lord and be the speaker Lord among us Lord come speak to our hearts Lord come minister to every need that's here Lord we just Reserve ourselves To You O God that in everything you might be glorified Lord we give ourselves to you now Lord and ask that you administered every need Among Us in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you love him amen I'm thankful we didn't have to canoe in here today see different ones it's made it through the storm and I know different ones all the way across and I don't know if that had different flooded basements I don't know if you knew this or not but I was mentioning it when we were praying in the back I I looked over it last night you know on Thursday night there were eight tornadoes that touched down from Portage then it went Vermillion touched down and then and all the way across the last one was in Chardon so it came all the way across and it just kept you know the different ones but I thank God for his Mercy yes and I know that different ones I know that I had neighbors all around me that uh you know you start seeing in the carpet laying out on the streets and the Furnitures from the basements and things and so you know my heart just really went to them and I expressed that to them and but I'm glad to be here this morning glad that God has made a way and my heart's desire is Lord that he'll just come by our way and he knows what we have need of you know even when we Face even the storms of life God knows what we have made of and Lord I just pray as Lord just come by our way and encourage us amen strengthen us Lord minister to our hearts so Titus Chapter 2 Verse 11. the scripture says for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself of peculiar people zealous of Good Works amen may the Lord bless the reading of the word as you're being seated here this morning I want to continue to just that that point and that thought on Grace appearing and this is where in the in the scriptures as we've been looking at that thought on the grace of God and we've been looking at that now for some for a few weeks but I want to look at this just a little more here this morning and I want to just dive right back into that and try to just resume where we were last week in Titus Chapter 2 verse 11 out of I want to read out of the Amplified version it says for the grace of God which is his unmerited favor and blessing has come forward or appeared for the deliverance from sin and the Eternal salvation For All Mankind so that appearing to for that to appear this very word it deals with where something becomes visible where something itself becomes light where it becomes known where it becomes manifested and we went into the scriptures and we were looking at the on the appearing and when Grace itself that has appeared this Grace has come the grace of God Has Come forward that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men and when we think of that with the grace of God we know that that that term and I don't want to get bogged down with this because I'll get to it but the term Grace itself is many times where we see that's been down uh even not just now but it started in the early church age Satan is always attacked the true grace of God and that's where I remember when Paul and uh Jude under inspiration he the admonition was to contend for the faith uh earnestly contend for it for the faith that was once delivered to the Church of the Living God because he said men have crept in unawares now they when they crept in they didn't come the right way because anyone who comes through the door you've got to come through the word you've got to come through Christ is that right I mean you come in through him then you have experience not only have has the grace become visible to you but now you have become a partaker of it and now that same Grace is visible in your own life and so he says that there were men in that time that had crept in that had turned the grace of God into our lasciviousness now we know if Satan has done anything to want to come and to take away of the grace of God He is we recognized that his whole point within it is to try to take what God has desired for you and I to be a partaker of and so to recognize if we can say it in this way we want to look at that Grace that has come to us even in this hour and so when we look back at Matthew chapter 1 and verse 21 the scripture says and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now I want you to notice this he shall save his people from their sins he's not talking about the Jews he's talking about his elect seed he shall save his people from their sins not in their sins but from them so the word save is the word Sozo and that word it means to save or to keep safe and sound and to rescue from danger or destruction it is to also to save one from injury or Pearl to save a suffering one from perishing one suffering from disease to make well to heal to restore to health and to preserve one who is in danger of Destruction or to save or rescue God is still in the saving business remember they were on the the the the the the the sea that night and and here he was uh you know they were about to sink and they called out to him to awaken him and said awake and save us lest we perish so at least they knew who to call on and he stepped forward and he brought Deliverance to them by taking care of not only what was causing the disturbance but the Bible said as soon as he spoke peace be still not only did the storm and the wind stop but immediately the waves stopped now you know after a storm goes through waves don't stop right away but he was over the storm and there over that of all of creation you think of evil when Peter himself was going down and he you know he had got his eyes off the Lord Jesus and he started to go down and anytime a person ever gets their eyes off of the Lord they are going to begin to sink but at least Peter had enough about him to realize the one who bid me even though I had got my eyes off of him but saved me Lord and here as he reached out his hand the one who bit him come reached down and lifted him above that water and they made it back to the boat now when we look at this with saving I want to just look into it diving into it just a little bit in Matthew 18 11 for the son of man is come to save that which was lost I want to say that when God became flesh he was on a mission this was not a haphazard event because we recognize predestination is not something that is a new doctrine predestination was not something that William Branham came up with it is the scriptures all the way through you can preach it from Genesis 1 clear to the closing scriptures in the Bible and to realize it that it's not us and ourselves that gives ourselves Faith to believe that but it is God in his infinite Mercy as he's passing by it's like a great magnet that's coming down whatever is magnetized and has those properties in it when that magnet passes by it only stirs up the properties that was already in it and that's exactly when the presence of God begins to move down through a group of people through a body Believers through an age it's the same great magnet of the holy spirit that it'll draw upon those that are magnetized to it now you know when things are magnetic ties either further away you get the less the pool is but the closer you get the stronger the pool is and if you can just call ask that God loosen everything out of my life that's bowling me down hindering me Lord and stopping me from making my way to that magnet God will come on the scene and God will do that for you you believe that amen I'm standing as a witness we Are Witnesses of the grace of almighty God amen God never asked me or you to free ourselves but we have to fight for it is that right is something to press for and say Yes Lord that's my desire now so he came to save that which was lost so if it was lost and there had to be a time that it wasn't lost but he came to find what was lost and remember it wasn't God who was lost it was you and me who were lost when he came he came to seek and save that which was lost now Isaiah 45 21 I love the Scripture it says let me go to the bottom here and it says Tell ye and bring them near yea let them take counsel together who hath declared this from ancient time who had told it from that time have not I the lord and there is no God else beside me a just God and a savior there is none beside me adjust God and a savior you know God had manifested this attribute of Savior time and time again in the Old Testament remember the scripture we read uh last week out in Nehemiah chapter nine where according to his manifold mercies he here he sent saviors unto them to save them now the man himself whether it was Gideon Moses Elijah on and on those men within themselves did not have anything or any ability to save those people but they had come in contact with the presence of God and they were standing as yielded vessels with a direct word from almighty God and there would be signs and wonders that would accompany that word and remember to show that it was a word from God it never left the people in bondage that's how every message is judged we judge them with the message by the word we judge the signs and one by the word and to realize when it is God it does not leave us in the same mess that he found us in God is a savior he's a just God and he is a savior oh mama so every time God would send this and he would manifest himself there is none else beside me verse 22. now and when you think about it in each of those times Israel did not deserve it one time is that right they didn't deserve it you and I didn't deserve it you see what Grace Grace is not something that you or I deserve it is God in his grace listen for you and I to even begin to hunger after God it is God's grace moving upon our life that begins to draw Upon Our Life the Bible said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled and brothers said for that scripture to be moving in your life it shows the Holy Ghost is upon you not in you yet but upon you and what's God doing he's stirring up that desire on the inside even when Israel would be in Babylon to come back into the land of Israel God said he would begin to move upon their heart and he would begin to cause that their heart where they would begin to seek after him with all their heart he said then I'll be found in you how can that be unless there is the grace of God moving upon the people of God in that hour is that right look unto me notice verse 22 look unto me and be saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else oh I love this I have sworn by myself the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear do you realize that God moving upon your life and bringing salvation to your life even everything that you were wrapped up in no matter what sin complexes and whatever that God rides in in Victory in your life as you surrender and he makes those Devils bow down to him he makes them bow down and recognize he's still the mighty conqueror right here in 2023 it doesn't matter with the darkness is upon us it's a gross Darkness but he's still the mighty conqueror glory be to God every demon has to bow to the name of Jesus Christ every devil I I've not seen one that he hadn't conquered even in this age that we're living in in the time of prevailing spirits but he's still the mighty conqueror First Timothy 1 15 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of whom I am chief and Isaiah 53 10 yet it pleased the Lord let's break in on this of Calvary yet it pleased the Lord to Bruce him he hath put him to grief when wind Thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfying by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong that word strong is messiah's brothers because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors we were slave to sin and one of the first words and first that begins with Redemption is someone has to come into the market and make a purchase and God himself came became one of us and he made the purchase but not only did he purchase us but he also bought us out of the market where we could never ever be sold again [Music] That's The Power of redemption oh my amen now think of it here in Mark chapter 10 verse 45 I'm just giving these scriptures here for weaving the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many First Timothy 2 5 for there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time in Galatians 1 3 Grace be to you and peace from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our father to whom be glory forever and ever amen now coming back to that scripture in Titus Chapter 2 notice verse 14 who gave himself for us once again there is a reason that he came he came to redeem right he gave himself for us now the scripture would tell us in John 3 16 and 3 17 that whosoever believeth in him might be saved right might be saved but there is a place that's greater than might it's a place of security and that's a place in him right and that's comes through the baptism of the Holy Ghost then we are baptized in him but yet there are many and we understand that by the scripture that there will be there's many different classes that are saved but they that they are not part of the Bride of Jesus Christ they will not be in the Rapture they will miss the wedding supper they will miss the Millennium is that right and they will receive or be granted to enter into life standing there at the white Throne judgment but the Rapture is for the Bride of Jesus Christ is that right so there is there is a saving when it says that it came into the world to save Sinners Like Paul said of whom I'm chief he did come in order to save you and I to rescue you and I to deliver us to bring a Deliverance in our life that's why the grace of God appeared because we were not able and could not do anything on our own I won't want you to leave this back just 2 000 years ago but it's the same Lord Jesus come right here Among Us in the promise of his word that's why when a person says well you know I just love Jesus you can't love Jesus and not love his word if you don't love this word you don't love Jesus because he is the word made Flash so let all the defectors detractors and everything else say well I just want Jesus Jesus is the word you can't say you love Jesus and you don't love his word [Music] you see what you find as many are with caught up with the concept of Grace that for that that has been given by individuals that have never experienced Grace are you hearing me now I believe I want you to understand I believe there's some that's out there that like brother Brown said there are those that will be saved that if they're trusting in their Church they're lost but if they're trusting in Jesus Christ for their salvation they're saved and you know here's the reality of it if there's not a hunger in them for anything more they're not ordained to anything more but if there's a hunger in your heart for more there's ordained for more right we're not here I'm not here to put anybody down I'm just here preaching a message that is calling to the Bride of Jesus Christ that's the only ones that will respond to this word are you hearing me you can't teach it in hammering in it is given by the election of almighty God that's why the prophet said your experience is not taught into you it's predestinated by the hand of almighty God I hope you listen to me now that's where sometimes we get ahead and we want to push on things and push on things listen everyone has their appointed season where God comes down and fills them with the Holy Ghost you're not going to get ahead of it you're not behind that get as everything is right on time but you see it's Satan's desire to try to bring confusion frustration build complexes and everything else but listen this is where your focus needs to be if there is any promise to be given and obtained it will be according to the grace of God so let me just encourage you like this turn your eyes away from your efforts from your trying and let your eyes be placed on the Lord Jesus and listen this is how I would pray in this hour I would say God lead me to the place of where I need to be in my life he's faithful as a Shepherd to lead us to that place to bring our hearts into that condition God knows what he's doing listen the same God that brought Sarah and Abraham in condition to receive the promised son he's the same God right here this morning that's able to bring your heart your life right into the place it needs to be what do I need to do surrender to the grace of God that's appearing to your life and in humility say God bring me to that place Lord lead me to that place foreign [Music] Hallelujah oh my well brother Samuel why is Faith preached and why sometimes when faith is preached and you know things are preached with healing and things are preached on the baptism of the Holy Ghost because let me just tell you God's a sovereign God knows every moment are you hearing me God knows every moment it's no surprise you got the holy ghost at this point or that point there's no surprise to God it's all arranged by God it don't mean he's going to drag us into it or push us into it it's God that is aligning everything remember brother random when he went into that room it was sure that that little boy was going to be healed and brother Brandon went over that morning picked that little boy up pray for him he got worse preach with me now that's the same thing that happens many times even with lives just wanting to seek the Holy Ghost seeking for healing and what it is is trying to reach out within that but let me just say this to you it's a promise that God has given and just as much as the prophet himself had to wait on God that who needs to sit in this chair where these glasses need to be and who needs to be in the house God himself knows how to put everything in order and all he needs is for you and I to surrender to him that's the same way with your loved ones it's the same way with your children God is the one who orchestrates everything say God let my frustrations be buried in the blood of Jesus Christ because we're all human we all get frustrated but Lord let my frustrations be under the leadership of the Lord who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself are peculiar people zealous of good works now I want you to notice this that he might redeem us from all iniquity so he's removing us from all of that redeem us paying the price and to purify to bring that cleansing and to bring a people unto himself a peculiar people one that he himself is able and designates these are my people and resilience of good works now this is why in Hebrews chapter 12 it says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the same and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God now I want you to notice this it would seem like a commonality that where our lives and people can read the Bible they can talk about Jesus they can talk about God but remember he is not only the god of history but he's the same God right here this morning he said I'm the same yesterday today and forever is that right so to see the looking unto Jesus there there is a catching when we look at the scripture that in that time Not only was was the word being delivered in that hour to those in the among the Hebrews in that time and when Paul was delivering this but it was also speaking of the hour that you and I would be living in where it would call you and I to look away from all the tradition and the isms of man to get our eyes off of ourselves and to look unto Jesus now now you know right now if I were to tell you to look at something and say you know if we had clear windows here and I could say look at that buck over there there's something that I'm seeing that I'm telling you about and what I'm telling you about I'm trying to get your attention to look to that thing right I'm not trying to get your attention to look to me but what I am saying is about an object that I'm seeing and the focus is so that your attention it actually follows to see the object that the word is proclaiming is there and so when we recognize in this hour there is a promise that God gave for this hour for this time there was the promise of the Resurrection sign it was the promise of the Messiah in this hour that the same God that meant Abraham the same God who came down and through the body of our Lord Jesus and paid the price also announced to you and I that there was coming this time and when the son of man in his coming would be revealed once again as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot he announced the same Resurrection sign that would be among us is that right so it wasn't just healings yet healings were prominent yet Miracles and signs and wonders and my goodness the signs and wonders that were done but you realize that there was a voice that came with these signs and wonders there was a voice that was to call us away and point us to the one who is doing the things that we see being done it was to call us out of organizationalism call us out of our own ideas and call us into the place of the land of promise is that right now to think of it brother Rand would say it just like this I don't have the quote up there but to thank God would speak this in the message I've heard but now I see he said to think of it you're looking at it with your own eyes The Living Word of God made manifest the promise of the hour in the last days you're looking with your own eyes at the Living Word interpreted in natural form God Among Us God interpreted his word right through a prophet and the same God that was interpreting right through his Prophet is the same God interpreting right through his body in this hour not just to God we've heard about but I have heard but now I see thee right so it's a promised word for this hour now you notice God has uh brother Brown would talk about this of gifts that God would place in the church and how you know God sets the gift it's not a man that aspires you know to uh you know to go and do something and he might be ever so inspired to do this or that but he may not be qualified and it may not be what God has him has for him to do but you see God has those that as brother bran puts it that our ambassadors of God that are able to go into the heavenlies and able to bring out their the great unknown Supernatural to discern and bring things out that the natural mind cannot perceive now this is God's grace to you and I and he says what it does it brings out the mystery of God and foretells things and things that has been and things that will be let me just say it like this just as Elisha stood there that day and he could say to gehaza who was all troubled that he said there are more with us than there are against us but gehaza was not able to see that right now to tell you the truth according to what the prophet said Elisha didn't see it either but Elisha knew God and knew God was a god of his word it was a type of an Elisha in this land in this day a type of the Bride that says I don't have to see it I don't have to feel it I've already met him and I know he's a god of his word whether I see it feel it or not God made the promise and I know him he's my God and I am his son or daughter and Elisha was so confident he said God loosen his eyes that he can see what's already here and remember God didn't bring those angels down they were already there and that's why the prophet could announce to you and I he said to God that always was and is he said he's always been here but now our eyes have been loosened to see him ah I think of how brother Branham just listened to it this morning and brother I'm talking about in the message of Grace he said you know when they were walking on the road doing mess he said they had a little bit of an inclination that it was him all along because there was something that was moving and Stern but they didn't know it are you with me you see God's a god of certainty he works to move from just inclinations to maybe souls he works to bring certainty in our life and how is that certainty brought by the grace of God has God Appears and makes himself known to you and I aren't you grateful for that friends that ain't us that makes ourselves certain it's God it's God revealing himself so that comes out of that of the Unseen it becomes visible before us now notice in Zechariah 4 verse 6 notice how that this speaks in this hour and you realize that this scripture we I've been reading from here just a little bit but I to realize that this scripture was not just something that was pertaining to that of when they returned back to Babylon but this scripture was prophetic of the hour that we're living in where the Temple of almighty God God's Dwelling Place would be built back by the power of almighty God it could not be built on the shifting Sands of man's reasoning are you hearing me God did not borrow any of man's ideas all right now we're going to preach now but brother Samuel but brother random he pulled from this he pulled from that he wasn't pulling from a man remember those men had spoke certain things Larkin and all the rest of them are you hearing me now but this ministry of Elijah is an assembling of Truth Elijah never packed the rocks to the mountain they were there already but somebody had to know how to put them in order and the reason he knew how to put them in order and where to go is because he said after it was all said and done I have done all of this according to Thy word so in this hour where men have proved that and Truth here and Truth there it is a time that truth itself would be assembled by the spirit of Truth himself through the ministry of Malachi 4 it would be by the spirit of God energizing that word that would energize the hearts of the believer with Rapture and Grace are you with me Zechariah 4 I'm talking about the real reality of Grace Zechariah 4 6. then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord and desirable memory he's looking at the seven golden candlesticks and he said this is the word of the Lord unto zerubbabel according to the according to the Lord saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts I won't ask you to try but how many of us have tried to do things on our own come on now made a lot of made a lot of promises let me just tell you something there ain't no promise that you can keep on your own you know are you hearing me you got it has got to be one that comes and gives you the absolute strength to keep his word and the way that that comes is thereby being obedient to his word is that right God gives us Grace for that right there now Zechariah 4 7 who art thou old great Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the hedged on thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it now I want you to know the very important the prophet would continue to emphasize this in in the message of Grace and say to notice it's not the Cornerstone he's bringing forth the headstone it's the time that we're living in it's the capping off it's the finishing of the mystery of God now I want to dive into this here just a moment crying Grace Grace unto it now brother Adam says it like this he says now according to the prophecy there will come The Headstone and he said I want you to notice that when The Headstone comes the prince that's going to cry out the message will cry Grace Grace so that's what the message is Grace Grace for it's by grace are we saved that none of Works lest any man should boast and the message of Grace listen this now has been tramped under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace come on Friends some of them runs out into eternal security some runs out into everything else but the true message of Grace Remains the Same and that's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the grace of God that we're all saved by now watch how he takes this turn now so in the deity of Jesus Christ if the Lord God would come there and confirm that that is the truth and not only that he's talking about Divine Healing but by his word he confirms it's the truth and by signs and wonders he confirms us the truth then also Grace is the truth you catch what he's saying that this message of Divine Healing that has been attacked and been criticized you know how many times you stand there and the prophet standing and here over and over and again and he says I sense that Spirit coming in here and saying he's just reading their mind and then to have the where others that when there have been those that's been healed right there in the meeting they've had others that have come around and say well I don't think they ever had a problem in the first place I don't think they had this and then there were others that remembered there was a man who was healed there in the media many and there was there was different ones that were and then all of a sudden the the situation reoccurred in their life and then a Critic wanted to rise up and say see there's nothing to it and brother Brown Listen by the scripture is able to point them out that Peter himself as long as he kept his eyes on the Lord he never sunk and your healing itself will hold out as long as your confession holds out but you get among unbelievers and unbelieving spirits and those spirits will work to do what destroy what God has brought about in your body let me just tell you that's why if you're living in sin and in sin don't expect to get no better until you're ready to forsake sin if you ain't ready to forsake sin and separate don't expect God to do nothing are you hearing me [Music] I'm telling you friends it's true notice see this look at this he confirms it's the truth then also Grace is the truth then why would anyone criticize and say that Grace is wrong that we're saved by works now remember brother Ramos just told us in the opening part of this message here that he has been so criticized on preaching the message of Grace huh and what what Grace is that that we're not saved by works right we are saved let's just let's just read through it we are saved by grace and that through faith not by works work shows that you have been saved so work shows that you have been saved but what saves you is the grace of God grace saves you Grace is what God does for you works is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you but by grace are you saved now watch he said some people things because I go join a church and put my name on the book that's all I have to do some people think because I shout that's all I got to do others think because I speak with tongues that's all I have to do now you realize what's happening here he's dealing with these doctrines so-called of Grace put your name on the book should get happy enough to shout you've got it speak with tongues you've got it but that's not the true grace of God some things because I got power to heal the sick that's all you have to do it's not it's the grace of God that saves you God's Amazing Grace I cannot trust in any merits and some said well there's a great man that that man I've heard him stand up and do this and I've heard him stand up and do that and Paul said in First Corinthians 13 though I speak with tongue of men and angels though I have discernment though I have gifts to feed I'll take all my goods to feed the poor though I can move mountains with faith though I have knowledge to understand all things I am nothing till love comes in which is Grace God has to do it you can do all these things and still be lost remember there are going to be many that will come before him on that day and say didn't I and he's going to tell them you never receive my grace depart from me I never knew you they preached in his name cast out devils and all those things but you see now we're God's Great you see what the grace of God comes to do the grace of God comes to put us in a place of Surety and divine Assurance in the Kingdom of almighty God it's Grace that saves you God's grace to the human race and brother Graham said to think of it I was thinking of that Grace immediately after that appeared Friday morning just at the break of day up there in that field when I sat on a log and later and bear and tears coming down in my eyes and remember this was the second time that the squirrels were called into existence that's where the three rainbows had come saying that you know going into one bowl I've done that Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new he says oh God Your Grace has stooped to save me why did you ever have such pity upon a poor illiterate Wretch like myself anybody else feel that way how did you ever come down to our humble little Tabernacle where peace and people of little Walk of Life poor have nothing in this world and steal your grace is spread abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit that you heal our sickness and save our sins which I corrects this save us from our sins rather and make us your people and deal with us now I want to just just kind of change you just for a moment and looking at the effects here of the grace of God appearing to us because when we recognize this just as much as the message of true Grace has been attacked Satan also was attacking Divine Healing right and saying it's nothing and you know I I thought about it you know when you used to see where even they'd have ambulances you know you could you could uh you know look at clips and things like that in Jack Cole's meetings they would have ambulances would bring people and deliver them right into those meetings put them on stretchers try to get and try to get a home under the hospital do it now listen friends I'm not against the people but you see the where the climate and everything has got to are you with everything has gotten you wouldn't see that now everything is so in there there's not even a reverence from the things of God if you find even one person that has a little bit of reverence for God and I ain't talking about some ball player that looks up and says Jesus help me make a dunk God don't care about dunks and touchdowns sorry that's another God that's being worshiped are you hearing me amen that's that Babylonian religion that's spread throughout all the Earth because he said if I be lifted up I'll draw men unto me is that right so we see that there is there's effects of this of Divine Healing when Grace appears to a person's life when Grace appears and it's personal it's personal how Grace appears like the song We Sing of Amazing Grace the hour I first believed it is Grace that appeared to you and I and not only did it appear but by the grace of God you received his appearing I want you to watch this even when it looks because this word saving it's the same word that's used even within healing because think of how when the Lord himself would say through David that I'm the Lord that that that forgiveth all that iniquities and healeth all thine diseases remember there was the woman who came into Simon's house and she made her way and began to wash his feet and as she washed his feet made her way all the way past all of them because she had heard that he was there all the rest of them were making fun of him but she went by and she went home and gotcha if I could say like this she robbed her piggy bank and went and got the best one met because she knew who was there she was convinced it was the grace of God that was appearing what was it it was something moving in her heart do you realize when the prophet preaches that message Jesus keeps all of his appointments and it's been said all the way through the message the reason that Jesus kept that appointment was not because of Simon but he kept that appointment because he knew she was gonna be there and the grace of God has kept the appointment in his word to this generation because he knew you were going to be here he kept it for this moment knowing you and I would be here it's the grace of almighty God aren't you glad he ain't like you and I that we look at a reminder that comes up on the phone and says I got 10 more days for it to do move move it to the next day uh I don't need to do that today we'll move it to next week come on I'm not the only one who does that I've got other things going on but I'm glad with Jesus when he comes to fulfill his word it does not matter the situations that you're in it doesn't matter what's taking place when the grace of God has come to appear on the scene at that moment God has arranged everything and there's not enough Devils that can hold her back you realize this woman she had many complexes about her life she had many complexes about her life but in the midst of all that there was something beneath all those complexes that says I can't get rid of these complexes I I myself I can't do it but there's one who's there if I can just get to him Hallelujah here it is I feel it the prophet said what it was he said there was something pulsating in her she did not know how to answer the request she was being called to do but she responded and God made a way he opened up The Fountains of her tear ducts and it poured down and she washed his feet [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah she made her way through every form of criticism she made her way through every scoffer let me tell you something it may not be people that are critics but you'll have to press yourself through every lie that the devil has ever said over your life everything ever accomplished everything he's wanting to bind you back you know he's done that because he knows there's something about your life and he's trying to hold you back from the real reality that God has for you what made you to hunger for God God put that in there [Music] and he said to the woman Luke 7 50. thy faith has saved thee go in peace that Faith yeah her faith was responding to his faith he just let go her faith let go responded to his faith Luke 18 41 remember this being attacked it works the same way in the grace of God in our life Luke 18 41 here comes one who was blind remember um uh might switch my mind right now Bartimaeus and then asked him he said what will thou do in Luke 18 41 what I shall do unto thee he said Lord that I may receive my sight I wonder how many men we hadn't seen them but how many people has walked by him day after day after day after day but he heard and Faith cometh by hearing are you hearing me Faith don't come by listening faith comes by hearing there's a famine in the land is that right and the famine is hearing the word of God ain't for listening to it we've got Tate's books Bibles but it's for hearing it are you hearing me that's where the famine is in the hearing are you hearing me now so the hearing he's hearing this and what's it doing it's pulsating upon his heart for the condition that he's in if there's a faith that is being built in that hour in that moment in that time and notice as it's being built Jesus said unto him receive thy side thy faith has saved thee we don't even have a record that Jesus laid his hands on him the word loosened what was on his life we're going to preach now the prophet tells us when it comes to that of a deaf spirit he said when it comes to that of a of a blind when one's blind he said what it is he said it's a spirit like a transparent band that's upon that nerve and what it is it's squeezing it off it's a spirit is that right but you see God comes along and he's addressing the problem true he's speaking receive thy sight and as that word his Faith's already been has been built but now it responds into that place receive thy sight when that is spoken and it is received that Spirit loses its hold upon his life his seeing comes open can't you see it's a spirit that would want to keep you back from receiving the Holy Ghost it's a spirit that would want to keep you back from receiving your real Deliverance it's a spirit it's like that woman that was there in that um Institution brother Brandon walked into that mental institution he came in to pray for people and here stands here stands a woman a woman constructs right here brother Ram's looking around he said good Lord where do I start at he looks at her don't look like nothing's wrong nothing don't look like nothing's wrong is that right and here's what she says start with me start with me oh yeah there'd been a condition in her life of where things had happened at a very young age taking advantage of and things been look what it did it just continued to build Upon Our Life build Upon Our Life you see what Satan was one to do was try to Rob value tried to take purpose try to Rob all of these things and moving on down the line to where eventually here she was sitting in this kind of a condition and brother brother Brown speaks to her and she said you know there's been many times where she's been told by people well you just need to do this and you just need to do that and you just need to do that and brother Bram told her he said sister he said what it is it's a spirit she said brother Bradham I've always believed that's what it is you understand friends it's Spirits it's not people of well if they could just muster it up it's not the DNA of man [Applause] it's a spirit are you hearing me that's the same way it was with that of healing in the body that's why cancer it's a spirit diabetes it's a spirit blood pressure it's a spirit depression it's a spirit anxiety it's a spirit Hallelujah oh my notice receive thy sight thy faith has saved and let me just tell you what to do when that old spooky Spirit wants to come around because every listen let me just tell you something friends don't ever put depression on your door are you hearing me listen I'm going by what he's telling me to say right now don't ever sign for a box of rattlesnakes and become a Confessor of how big they are well they're this long they're this long they got this many diamonds on them shame on you you're to be confessing the promise of almighty God let me just say it listen friends there are people that deal with that of depression and I know of different ones right now that deal with that in battle with that even in other assemblies and they're standing right there on the promise of God they're not defeated they're standing on the promise of almighty God are you hearing me now it ain't because they don't got faith it ain't because they're weak some situations friend where there's people that are standing there and they're looking to God and let me just tell you something God is a Waymaker yes sir didn't talk to a brother here not too long ago some time ago and he said you know God is making a way from my wife I said amen don't ever let go of that promise you keep confessing that promise remember when brother Berry preached that message feeling all alone when Elijah got down in that situation he said God never came down and told Elijah snap out of it buddy right right that's words of encouragement snap out of it buddy got quiet now don't worry when you have times that you need to snap out of maybe somebody'll say won't you snap out of that bed snap out of this and snap out of that you understand we're not dealing with DNA it's the grace of almighty God but God came down and remember he sent the angel with the softest hands got the best cook to do what nourish his servant and what I'm saying no matter what condition it is don't ever hang that sign on your door this is what I'm saying don't let it become the predominant of the conversation I'm and this there is afflicting my body but by his stripes I am healed this is going on but by his stripes I am healed is that right oh my by faith hath saved thee and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying God and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto God now think of this woman who had an issue of blood I my you know I could go through many examples and she said in her heart in Matthew 9 21 if I may but touch His Garment I shall be saved or the word whole Jesus turned about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good Comfort thy faith hath made the whole and the woman was made whole from that hour bring us to that place brother Brown in The Sixth Seal as he's talking and he's giving rehearsing of that land over there and we saw hope and he saw those that went beyond the curtain of time and he's rehearsing that as he's standing at the end of The Sixth Seal and after he gives that testimony and he's speaking about that of what he saw on the other side there's a sister sitting there that's in need of healing and brother Brown they sing a little song where the brain goes right into a little song and then he speaks to this sister and it's going to break in on it in The Sixth Seal he says now see how much better it is amen that's it go and be well amen the grace of God has appeared to you to make you well talking about the other side that's perfect healing and look at the effect of the grace of God appearing to that little lady who is in need of healing in her body so healing in our body is God's grace appearing to you and I it was God's grace that appeared to Legion it was God's grace that appeared to the ten lepers nine of them left but one came back and said thank you is that right so here it's God's unmerited grace and I just let me just try to my you know time just just gets right away from us but you know when brother Brown is talking about this with healing he talks about for a born-again child of God he said when death I want to just read this Redemption and completeness in joy he said to every believer Born Again child of God when death comes stealing to the door prematurely the angel of God stands between you and the sickness now if you want to run on into that that's your business now you hear me now the angel of gods if he wants to if Satan wants to take your life prematurely here he's coming but the angel of God will stand between you and that sickness talking about premature now if you want to run on to that talking about run on into that that that sickness that's your business but you don't have to he's standing between you and death do you understand it is a choice that's given you don't have to run on into that sickness now he said 23 years ago in the Jewish Hospital Dr Morris Fletcher gave me three hours one of the best surgeons here in the city gave me three hours to live and I'm living tonight oh he said why by unmerited Grace the angel of God stood between me and death to protect me and I accepted it and in gratitude by God's grace I want a half a million souls to him tonight see it's a choice you don't have to go that route the same way it is with healing it's the same way it is with sin it's the same way with any situation whether it's sickness or whatever you don't have to go that way let me just tell you something what about those that with cancer that here that they went on home to be with the Lord they didn't lose the fight against cancer are you hearing me stood stood Toe to Toe and tenacious even to the last moments maybe of their last breathing but they didn't lose the battle God wasn't weak in that case they received their healing they received it on the other side God is Not defeated [Music] because there's nothing listen now balance out with that quote there's nothing going to take you out of here until God's purpose has been served and if the enemy shows up you say how do I know if this is premature or not faith will always find the perfect will of God and move in it is that right but in the meantime I'm not accepting anything and we don't ever have to accept anything as being that this is the way that it's going to be from now on we have promises in God's word and Grace has appeared to us to make these things real oh my don't you love him oh blessed be the name of the Lord could I have just a few more moments let me just drop this in here Ephesians 2 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast I know that's that's a very I love that scripture but it's a very scripture that sometimes you can hear from individuals they're going completely the opposite way well it's not of Works no no that's not what it's saying just as it was with the woman that had the issue of blood the lepers blind Bartimaeus and the rest thy faith save thee their faith recognized his presence and when you recognize his presence it releases to you what you desire in your heart so here for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God it's God that has moved upon your life it's God that moves upon your heart not of Works lest any man should boast that's why listen sometimes you ever get you ever get in your ear well you're just getting worked up you you just you're just getting worked up you're just getting all worked up and and you you just claiming a promise you know that you nearly no you know there ain't no way let me tell you something God don't work that way God don't work that way to come around to his people and tap them down that ain't how God works but it's Satan that's wanting to trouble your mind because you want to know why the promises of God are inherited by faith you receive it by faith not by feeling but he asks do you believe so no matter what the need is do you believe so not a Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them my mama I want to keep going but I don't want to just I don't want to force anything Hallelujah let me just read this last statement and I'm just gonna we're gonna stop right here brother Brown is talking in the pergamian age and he says for though we are saved by grace apart from Works true salvation will bring forth works or deeds that will please God so true salvation will bring forth those Works First John 3 7 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth or worketh righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he's talking about an inward work Brianna skip to that to that last the next quote there the one says the pergaman church age right after that let me just stop here on this quote this will sum it up if a man fears that he might not please God then let him fulfill the word if a man wonders if he will hear those words well done good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of God in his life and assuredly he will hear those words of praise the word of Truth was the Criterion then it's the Criterion now there isn't another standard there isn't another Plumb line and as the world is going to be judged by one Christ Jesus even so it is going to be judged by the word if a man wants to know how he is making out let him do as James suggested look into the mirror of God's word so the same God that brings salvation in healing is the same God who brings salvation to the soul the same God that moves down to redeem from all iniquity as the same God who purifies cleanses and God himself brings forth a people that are zealous of good works not doing something out of a merit but doing it out of appreciation The Works that are done is because of something inwardly that has taken place because in each of these cases of sickness in the natural when sicknesses you're healed of one sickness it may be another sickness that'll come later on because these bodies are still sin but it's still an Evidence of Resurrection but it's something that God is pointing to deeper it points down into the depths of our soul that there's a God that comes right Among Us the grace of God to bring about a real change in a person's life that takes a hold of that life and transforms it by his Amazing Grace what do I do receive it you receive that Grace for every need that you have in your life it's important to receive that Grace now look you and I both know if there was something that I had and you wanted you wouldn't just walk out of the door you would make your way to receive it right so to receive it is to acknowledge Him that's extending that grace to you to know that the same God for whether it's healing in your body this morning healing in your soul healing in your mind healing in your spirit I am the Lord that healeth all right it's the grace of almighty God what do I do first right even in your heart if there's things that's there Lord I walk away from within my heart to separate from sin and to walk fully in his presence if there's something that's there that that seems to be plaguing hold your confession of God's promise and God's word and walk forward with him let's pray Lord Jesus Lord you know you're the one Lord to bring everything together to put it together Lord I pray Heavenly Father

mighty conqueror Lord You're the same God who breaks the bands Lord not only the band's Lord that God removes blindness and gives Lord hearing Lord to the death but you're the same God who breaks the bands Lord of sin Lord God Upon A Life father you're the same almighty God in every way Lord I pray Lord Jesus may you Lord God granted Lord and confirm to every life to every need Lord that's
