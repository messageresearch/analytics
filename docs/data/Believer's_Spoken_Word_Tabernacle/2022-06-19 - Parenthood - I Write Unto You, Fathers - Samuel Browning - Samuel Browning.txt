complete um so brooks concrete from lorraine finished that all the walkway and phase two will begin here shortly all the wood that you see up is uh gonna be rod iron railings and then where the wood steps are right now will be concrete steps and then once those are completed we'll have the metal roof extension over the front porch and the ramp so this is an example of the railings now we can't install these until two weeks that's just the way that brooks told us the concrete has to occur cure and harden so the wood's going to be up for quite a while but just know that it won't look like that forever and then last offering on 612 we received eight hundred ninety seven dollars and fifty seven cents so that put us a total of fifteen thousand a dollar and fifty seven cents so let's [Applause] so phase one has been paid for we have a leftover balance of 201.57 cents for the railings in which i have uh the two steps that will go on both sides and that also be brother samuel's back step and then the step right here out this exit and then this exit all for seven thousand four hundred and thirty five dollars a lyria concrete step will take care of that and then we're still working on the metal roof extension so the special offerings will continue for a couple more months and we'll keep you updated on that and then i just wanted to share some pictures just how it was a lot of work so just i'll just kind of go through these quickly it was uh the parking lot was a mess that's why we had to cancel so this is monday they're just forming up where they're gonna pour and then uh getting ready to the footer here that was about i don't know three or four foot deep so they did this on monday here's tuesday it's tuesday they're forming the the other side of the porch the ramp there so you can see the front block there's it's been poured and hardened and then this is all ready to go for the pour on wednesday which wednesday was like 100 degrees and i don't know how they did it but they did it they did a nice job i'm not gonna be their salesman but they did a nice job anyway so here they uh poured this is wednesday in the 100 degree weather the handicap ramp there and sidewalk they poured that front porch area and the parking area and then to the to the playground so this was all done on wednesday real quick here's thursday so thursday we had a day uh brother brian

the sisters trying to come in with this you know you got to pull your clothes up and then paint legs and everything but thank god i appreciate i appreciate what god's doing to our brothers and they're

amen the joshua and mariah god bless you good to have you here with us amen other visitors god bless you amen good to have you here amen it looks good out there doesn't it and uh i just you're so thankful amen for what the lord has done and what he's doing and i heard brother shane going over that with you to know that if we left it like it is right now it would look like it did before it does now so all of that's coming in process so we just want to turn our hearts and our attentions to the word of the lord and certainly want to greet all the fathers today may god just richly bless each and every one of you and just just a thought on my heart this morning that we want to speak on and kind of go along that direction but some things that has a real application to us in all parts of our lives because the word that god sent us and not just what he sent us in this hour but every age it is the pulsation of our heart that that word is preeminent in our lives and becomes expressed in our life the brandon made a very tremendous statement in the church age book when he spoke about the amount of truth that came in luther's day they said there was enough truth it would have revolutionized the world but here's what prevented it you know we can say well well the seals had to be opened the truth but what brother brown was talking about is the truth that had been given at that moment he said what men begin to do with it is they begin to listen to it in order to debate and he said instead of listening to it for a practical outworking in their lives that's what makes that's what separates a believer from just an ordinary person because a believer desires that christ would be preeminent in her life that is the goal and what we are put here for is that wherever we go wherever we are homes and everything that they can know that a christian has been here in other words we put it plainly it's once again god with skin you know the christian bookstore sold a lot of they sold those bracelets and different things ww jd what would jesus do well let me just put it very personal if you want to know what he would do look at what he is doing and look where he has veiled in his bride right now because that can be left up to interpretation to any man but god declares himself his attributes and who he is so that we can know in a reality this is what he's doing this is our our call i must be about the father's business amen as we stand and pray we want to also remember i think prayer requests i didn't hear all of those so maybe it was in there i'm sure it was we want to just continue to remember her sister doris she's been in the hospital here for through the week and she's doing she's doing much better she just needs her appetite and things to come back and she's what the doctors have said at this point they were able to identify by yes yesterday is that she does have i think brother mark was telling me here i can't find the text on here right now but where it was a slight pneumonia there in the lungs so the greatest thing we can do is and i know the prayer request that already went out is just to keep her in prayer also sister linda i want to just continue to lift her up in prayer and i've said this i say to you many many times but i think it bears repeating when you hear a report of what god is doing like when we talked about sister linda she was supposed to go home on june 17th but she didn't go home on june 17th and so they're just you know they were wanting to do a little bit more tests and things like that she's she's strong and i told her the other day on the phone when i as soon as she texts me about everything and i i just said it this way i said i don't look for satan to show up but i know with all these reports he's going to rear his ugly head but we are armed with the sword of the lord wherever his head comes up it's coming off brother samuel you you shouldn't speak that way brother branham takes a statement in 1965 the message of shame he said i feel in myself he says i've almost got to a point it's like i'm asking the devil to leave instead of adjuring him to leave his room what's he reminding us of and that message ashamed if we are ashamed of the son of man in this generation we should not be ashamed of this word this word has come to let us know who we are our god-given rights in this hour we don't have to back up we don't have to beg we don't have to plead we have god-given rights in this hour that we can stand there and the prophet could say and mighty god unveiled before us when that word has become foreign in our life then doom devils are on the run and he could say in 1962 wisdom versus faith when he's speaking of this word becoming prim in our life he says satan be careful with that group [Music] this is what the son of man has announced that's the power of this word it's not me it's not you it's christ in us and recognizing like david goliath was more than a match for david but he wasn't more than a match for god [Music] hallelujah that's why when we're lifting up this message we're not lifting up a man we're lifting up the son of man jesus christ oh my i'm not even going to preach on that this morning but i think it bears it bears mind when these things come up still keep on praying even more the earnest not oh oh praise the lord she's going home on june 17th we can just pull back on the prayers we keep praying we keep praying we keep swinging that sword we keep pursuing going right after it and i believe with all my heart we're not waiting on the bride to become a mighty army she is now a mighty army that satan's trick is to push something way out here right now right now right now so let's just go to the lord in a word of prayer maybe if you have an unspoken need a request you just like to make it known to the lord say father pass by my way you know the need lord heavenly father we are standing here this morning god it's your children oh god so thankful for the blood of the lamb so grateful lord that father that pathway that way has been revealed you have made yourself known to us in this hour oh god lord what a privilege it is to be under the blood of the lamb oh god life lord that brings transforming power and of faith and stability lord in our hearts and our lives father this morning there are needs that we spoke of of sister doris and sister linda and lord i know that behind every uplifted hand there's a need lord that's just as important to that heart lord and father you don't you don't lord make differences and and put things in as though one need is greater than the other we can look at things sometimes lord and we see needs within that manner and in that way but lord with all these needs this morning lord god we present our token lord with these requests lord that you would just move for sister doris lord strengthen her in her body oh god i pray father may you move lord for her in a special way continue lord you've you've been moving lord just even the testimonies lord without time lord for me to go into but just saying lord how you're moving and i ask oh god you continue to strengthen her sister linda like oh god lord we are thankful thankful for your mercy lord and i pray that god that lord jesus you would just continue to move for each and every need behind those uplifted hands lord lord i i am certain that right here this morning god you're a dissolver of every doubt i'm certain lord god that father no matter what that need is upon a life or upon a heart and maybe it's discouragement maybe it's frustration lord maybe things lord that's been attempts and it seems like failure but oh god you're the god who ministers lord to that which is thought to be impossible and you make it known it is possible to them that believe oh god will you just come by this morning lord and speak to our hearts speak to every need and lord we just want to honor you by having a heart that's open lord and to receive and yield of our lives to you lord we love you and we thank you now lord in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen if you'll turn with me to first john chapter 2 amen first john chapter 2 and i'm just going to read just a few verses of scripture this morning and verse 12 i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake verse 13 i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one i write unto you little children because you have known the father and i have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning and i have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of god abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one so i'd just like to speak this morning on i write unto you fathers may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i realized sometimes that when we could begin to look going over looking at messages and dealing with family and everything else i realized sometimes that we all could get our toes ready to draw up in our shoes because of things that we can look at in our own selves and say well i'm not perfect or i haven't been perfect or maybe i didn't come out of a perfect home or maybe you said and say well i didn't really do a great job let me just say this to you i've learned this over the years of times of setting with with individuals where they would come after services when i would deal with things first of all the word of god is to be applied in every aspect and every part of our life secondly don't let the enemy condemn you to where you close off to where he can't to where god can't minister to you because no matter what has been done you can't live in the past god doesn't keep you in the past but what he does when he comes with his word is where we're able to identify we can see the wrong but also see the grace that we can move forward and no matter where we're standing at here this morning you might say well i'm no longer a father but you're many of you are grandfathers and there's still a responsibility that goes along with all of that so but there's the things that we can do because there's also young ones that's coming on others the children those that will and so forth these things are all necessary in the word of god they are not things when brother branham himself it's all the way through the message brother brown never handed people books and said well just look at this right here brother brahm didn't do that that's not what this message come to do matter of fact the lord jesus never did it paul never did it either paul took many many many chapters and wrote of how the life should be reflected in the home and how things should be conducted now i know the logical thing we could say is as well you know just get the people to the holy ghost and i agree getting the people to the holy ghost but you know what it doesn't then become something on autopilot this is why the word of god is ministered in our life to speak to that innermost part of our being and to give us direction in our life we we i'll say it like this we are people that are not to walk with presumption or assumption we are to be intentional people in this hour satan is not just assuming and whatever goes he's intentional everything that he's built even up to this time to think how things move from movie theater to television now here to the media the internet and everything else it keeps on he's intentional even with the things that he has done and placed out there even advertisements you can say i don't have none of those things but even advertisements and imagery that's put before us it can i'm just talking about advertisements and i'm not talking about advertisements for beer and cigarettes i'm talking about advertisements for things that'll even be put on a label of going to get your first mortgage i pay attention to a lot of things what are they putting before people on on marriage and everything else what are they putting before how are they doing this because you see satan wants in a way he doesn't come right out and wham like that but satan has a way that he wants to come to where it just becomes something you've seen enough to where it just becomes acceptive but we are called by the children by the by as the living god that the world should not be the influence on our lives god has set a standard in this hour and the standard is not a book it's not a tape it's not even a bible but the standard is christ who is the word now made flesh in our lives and that's a standard that speaks against the enemy hallelujah god said when he speaks in the natural that that our children are to speak at the gate god has children that speak at the gate the gate is jesus christ have a place that we can speak we we know where we are standing and i want to speak here uh just this morning just for a little bit and on on this thought uh the lord had placed on my heart probably a month ago or so i don't remember just one day in the middle studying the inspiration just dropped i laid everything else aside other outline and just went through it as god was just bringing it and i want to speak on that i write unto you fathers and if we could go back to verse 13 and i want to draw your attention here in this verse of how john would write this and he would specifically say i'm writing to fathers i'm writing to young men and i'm writing to children the holy spirit is writing here to all that are present fathers meaning those not just that have children but fathers meaning men who are established in the word of god men that others can look at and not just look at but can even go to and are in example and if they are an example fully and established now we can look and say well what about the young men well paul did write and say that we're not to despise our youth is that right and john is not by the spirit of god discretion minimizing that of the young men and the children but he's showing that there is all levels of maturity and it's all as the as the lord tarries that will continue to be in every assembly it should be there should be fathers here and the father is not well i've been in the message for 50 years you might be in the message for 50 years and you're still a child that all right i mean you you realize this in the world that there's individuals that they might be 30 years old and you get around them or 40 years old and you realize these people are chronologically 40 years old but they're so immature there's no stability in their lives right they get their you know they have uh disagreement with their boss well fine i'm leaving immaturity they've not been taught how to handle conflict we can go on and on and pull from this the conflict's always going to be around you you don't run from conflict but you learn how to submit yourself in the midst of conflict conflict isn't you rising up it's submitting to one who is greater than you i'm writing unto you fathers those who are established so there's a responsibility that is fathers that we have young men meaning those who have such zeal and strength they've got stamina now every one of us you could take somebody here in my you know youthful 46 years of age and there could be others that they might be 50 they got more stamina than me you can't compare me to them others it might be 30 and they have less than you you we do not compare that god has made every one of us differently for a purpose is that all right but a young man this is why writing in the scriptures it is good for a young man to serve the lord in his youth young men and so forth have strength and stamina that's why you know i had a brother ask me one time and you know he was wanting me to go to it wasn't a brother who comes here from india but they want me to go to india's one i was in some meetings with them and oh i want you to go to indy you know sometimes we'll go over there for six weeks i said brother i said you're you're an elder to me i said and you realize i said i'm a pastor i said let me also tell you with being a pastor i'm a homebody as well i like to go drop it and come back but i'm a pastor i've got other responsibilities i can't do that and go for six weeks on end but i said you know what some of the evangelists and get some i said the younger ones he said we're sending some of the young ones i said well you know what we keep sending them and praying that god that that effectual which it is having an effect i said that's what we need to do we utilize we're not trying to do it all ourselves we want to utilize everything that's around us right i mean can you imagine if the pastor is the one the pastor's the trustee the pastor's the deacon the pastor's the law and creditor the pastor's this the pastor's that wow i don't know where this is just it's all sorts we you know this is where we all should be in a place and saying god what would you have me do right here in this assembly what would you have me do what would you have me do is that right now fathers young men having strength and children newborn babes all of these parts to me this is incredible because with the father a father has seen things as it comes along even in stages and is there to minister nourishment along the way every one of us as fathers have got get and we'll get frustrated sometimes you're expecting more maturity or more things than what you're seeing right now i'll say amen for everybody lord it's true all right we're going to do this we're going to do that we're going to do this the room's going to be picked up here this and all of all these things right now as a father you realize i love you all but i told my boys i said look if god tarries i'm gonna have some daughter-in-laws and they are not gonna be your maids that's what i tell them you can ask them right now take them out and ask them say let me hear everything oh there's more than just that statement but there's things because you also want them to recognize you're a part of what goes on you just don't bring home the bacon the ham the pork chop whatever you want to call you just don't bring that home and say well i did my part and kicked my feet up you don't do that but a father is there to direct and to lead that household to be a help are you hearing me our heavenly father when he came down our heavenly father came down and says i did not come to be ministered to i am come to minister show us the father show us the father i write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning so paul is we're seeing this here because in a church my i'm just trying to get moving but i ain't even got off this this scripture but this this part of it all are present within an assembly fathers young men and children and you can put within that category just don't leave it for men but even across believers and we as believers it's working it's laboring it's ministering to all those parts because if god parries for those of us who stand as fathers now the young men will become fathers those who are children moving from young men uh to to fathers moving it's always it's a cycle you say listen how is it a cycle the scripture says in revelations 10 8 that we're to eat this book this word become one with this word and thou must prophesy again and the word again means that of a cycle or cyclic in nature in other words whatever you sow when they sow wheat over here in this field they they they are going you take from the crop that's coming in there's part you partake of and then there's a part you take and you sow back for another crop this word will reproduce jesus christ in every generation if he continues or tarries a hundred year from now i pray to god that it pulsates in our heart i want my children to be higher than i am i want them to be further along than what i am because that's the pulsation of this word when brother branham made the statement you know how he makes it things that are to be and other places in the message he said young men would take this message and sweep it sweep it onto the coming of the lord they'll take it higher it didn't mean the young men would become smarter it doesn't mean the young men or they'll know more than the prophet that's the problem sometimes sometimes people feel like that they know more than the messenger well brother branham made a mistake here brother bannon made an opinion there god never called anybody no one to do that i'll tell you what happens when you do that you're setting a pathway for your church you're setting a pathway for your home if he hadn't this happened here what about the rest of it well say you shouldn't be that bold oh i should be that bold because let me tell you there's others being bold calling things out [Applause] the bible says we ought to be able to rightfully divide the word but let me say this to you and i is to recognize who was revealed to us in this generation it was the son of man the lord jesus christ revealing himself through a son of man when jesus could say when you have seen me you have seen the father [Music] can i say this brother branham through his ministry could declare when you have seen this ministry jesus christ being reproduced again you have witnessed the same lord jesus christ beyond the veil beyond the veil for the randomness not jesus christ but it was jesus christ veiled behind badger skins [Applause] because with the purpose and intent that what is veiled when this message was being delivered that that same message would be conveyed in a bride badger skins it would be god with skin on it oh they would start as children you know when you start with your child they're staggering they're walking assembling this maybe they applied this a little wrong but you're right there you don't say ah you did that wrong no no you know how it is with the fingers you know you the training wheels you know you you take one off and leave one on and then eventually take that off and you've got a hold of their seat and you do that a number of times and any kids who have training those cover years right now eventually you know as you you get into a certain spot and they're used to you holding on the back of that seat holding on the back of that seat and pretty soon you know you're feeling are they balancing it you let them go a little bit and you're checking that out then eventually you know when to let go they might get a sting up near a knee get stung up but that's why they still sell peroxide but samuel this is this is not a mother's day message well it applies to us all but if mama had her way mama would have mattresses set all along the sidewalks oh junior don't fall they might be 40 years old junior don't fall why that's the heart of a mother are you hearing me that's the heart of a mother and let me tell you something god is our father and he's also our mother [Applause] all these parts exist i don't i'm not i'm not bothered by brother saying aren't you down no i'm not down at all there we should be in an assembly children young men and i'm not putting you here and putting you there and putting me here i'm saying that should be if we have all fathers then we've got a problem then maybe fathers aren't doing what they need to be doing come on now but you see all the way through god has these set in place and each have their responsibility now the word known means to become acquainted with that's what this word knows you have known the father you become so acquainted with him you know what that speaks of relationship i can't dive that deep into that today but it speaks of relationship you see to the greeks it was all about knowledge this word known it's i know this and i know that and i know this and they knew they knew it but to the jews one did not know something until it was a practical or an outworking in their life now let me just say this to you there's things how when we're looking in the word from children to young men to fathers fathers did not become fathers because they were hearing the word and not praying over it let me preach now fathers did not become fathers because well they just were in the church long enough and i know the message they become fathers because praying that that word will become so preeminent god clear out traditions i have in my mind lord you're the father i never had you can say that you can also say lord jesus you are the one to instruct me there's examples around but lord if there's anything in my life that would hinder it see it's a relationship between you and god you don't become fathers without a relationship and look a person can say well i'm a child of god that's wonderful but you ought to want to become a young man in other words where you are now are moving with a zeal and a courage to move within the kingdom of god and then as a father one who's able to stand there with stability and strength to be an example to be a help to somebody then maybe let's say going to a brother and you don't have to go over and say hey brother you know i noticed by the way you're doing this and doing that and doing that sometimes i didn't know the earth here because that just goes but it's operating see a father is one who operates by wisdom sometimes it ain't even saying the noticeable paul said i have become all things to all men that i might win some to christ why the objective i just heard brother branham yesterday on my way home brother braham said in in shows the father listen to those messages and brother branham said and once again you've heard this he said there's nothing wrong with the product that we have he says but it's our presentation many times you see listen when you have the objective the goal is that a life is fully converted but you can't always come at a person and say you need to be converted sometimes you need what you need what we must have is let the effectual working of your conversion start to whet their appetite hallelujah practical outworking now in the message the token let me refer to a few of these places i think we're settled on that we recognize as a father a young man and a child we all have that as a congregation we have it within our lives the main thing that we want to do is is say god let this word be so preeminent in my life that's why different ones of you different ones i've told you i've said it right from the platform get in the message get in the message put the message of the hour on play it in your home you have it on phone we have it right before us over the same i don't completely understand let me tell you something what the message is the message is not a new idea [Applause] we have over i don't know how many thousands and thousands of man-made ideas this is not the message is a call out of babylon you know what babylon is it's confusion it's confusion telling oh jesus christ he's the greatest thing and then they're out here living any old way you see him outside a church and you realize church is only a club it's no more than the moose lodge or uawr being a member of whatever political party i'm preaching straight this morning but the message is a life it's the reproducing of the lord jesus christ according to his word in a body of believers not a man's idea [Music] this message come to call us out of confusion you know brother braham tells us in the token here and i just want to refer to certain places here it speaks of how jacob would tell his wife and all them to wash up their clothes and put everything put away their gods see it was in preparation right for a meeting with god see everything with prayer get everything ready get ready for this meeting with god joshua would say before crossing over wash your clothes come not at your wives and so forth get ready for within three days we'll cross over jordan he was getting ready and was applying the token but the brand says get ready apply it believe it clean up let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you that's right it'll take an effect you catch what he's saying let them see it what's he talking about the token the life of jesus christ let them see it in you and it will take effect we all right now in this building could say god help me to die more to myself oh no don't put that on me thank you are you very what a wonderful brother-in-law [Applause] after service if we're sitting down somewhere you can grab one of those fans like the ten commandments [Music] i'd say he's a good guy i just i would be i i'd be i'd be sick tomorrow if i have that blowing on me right now but notice let him see it in you it'll take an effect sometimes when we get confused is we're wanting our knowledge to have an effect our knowledge will not have an effect and knowledge doesn't have an effect it's not knowledge that produces change it's relationship let them see it in you so so first of all it's having that relationship with god then that relationship with god then it'll have an effect on them when here when the lord jesus come what did he say his purpose was i am come here for this one purpose to reveal the father brother graham said it this way in the church age book he said the sun did not come to reveal the sun the sun came to reveal the father i love that statement man he came to reveal that that's that's where you and i are called is to reveal the lord jesus christ [Applause] that's why people ask what you believe where do you go to church you know what they're trying to find what husband are you united with and all of a sudden you begin to speak and say well you know uh we believe the full gospel okay uh that's narrowing it down you're definitely not catholic um you see it starts funneling it on down okay so now we got all these thousands that's still out there maybe upc jesus only maybe then you narrow then you're narrowing it on down and saying well we believe that a person must be born again still leaves you out there well you know the baptists believe that the pentecostals believe that but how do they believe it do they believe it the way the word teaches it or do they believe it the way that their factory seminary puts it out are you hearing me you know why they have to have seminaries because they don't know the holy ghost and jesus said when he has come he will teach you that's why no man has a right to stand in the pulpit until he has met the pillar of fire jesus christ face to face because otherwise it's his ideas his theories and he's not under the leadership of the holy spirit because the church of the living god is not led by man's ideas man's creeds they're led by the holy ghost [Applause] in this hour that's a foreign thing i'm not getting what i minister from my mailbox or my inbox coming straight from the throne of god like it does to every other every other minister of god because it's not one me or me trying to figure or find things out sometimes i can see needs and i've got to pray about it for so long sometimes god will address it here sometimes you address it in a different way but the time you've had to learn that yes and you could probably put that in capital letters i've had to learn that what a beauty it is when you learn and you can realize god's got this in control sometimes men are their sometimes men are their own stress factors is that right i mean pastor can be stressful but sometimes pastors are their own stress that's a separate one lord remind me of that one tomorrow [Laughter] notice this it'll take an effect how many believes them the holy spirit will have an effect you don't have an effect it has an effect in our home and in our lives let me just continue reading here then apply the token in prayer so letting them see it and then also applying it in prayer why do we pray do we pray hoping god's going to do something that ain't prayer prayer is you ask in believing you believe that why that's why you're asking right we're saying i ain't seen no different that's why the scripture says uh in the book of luke i think it's also in matthew when jesus is talking about the unjust judge we read that i think on the thursday night and then in another place he said he that knocketh he that asketh sometimes we think we're so i'm so big in faith i just asked one time and bless god i'm not going to ask no more you need a pen to deflate your air but a real child of god asks keeps asking keeps asking keeps asking keeps asking keeps asking keeps asking keeps asking keep saying ask keeps asking why do you keep asking it's not because of you have a lack of faith you're asking because i believe that god is the one to take care of this need because i can't do it but christ in me and what does prayer do prayer is not just asking him but through prayer when we get before the throne of god we start entering in to the footsteps of one another not god change so and so change so and so change so and so never work brother ram said when we really get before the throne of god he said what maybe somebody wronged us he said we'll actually start getting before the throne of god if we get there we will start saying lord my brother they didn't mean to do that my sister you see you start moving why you're in the atmosphere of the redeemer the high priest one who moves and is merciful and is faithful you begin to start put your because you can never ever move or allow the flow of redemption to move through your life without getting in the shoes of others oh they hurt me i know they meant to do it they might have maybe they did but a believer gives the benefit of the doubt now we're talking about when brother carmel is here and he preached on bitterness we're talking about where chambers in our lives we want treasuries of god's love treasuries of goodness i don't want treasuries like them guys when nehemiah was coming back and he found some of them was in cahoots with others and they were storing up their stuff in the tabernacle of god we stand as children of god and say uh-uh not in this temple the bible's told us offenses will come you have to look for them they come like a mailman delivering letters oh and they're more sure than publishers clearinghouse too apply it in prayer with consideration and with believing apply it with such love and so forth till you know it's going to take place just you catch what he's saying here apply it with such love that you know it's going to take place you see love remember the book of galatians faith worketh by love you can't have faith in your but this is where prayer listen to me now don't don't get oh brother samuel i'm i'm there i've been in that no listen this is where it has to come down to a place you can't address needs in your home and other place if you're not in love with the lord like you ought to be that relationship has got to be strong between you and god it's where we when situations come up really the first thing we want to do we need to do before we ever start praying about the situation is this lord take control of me come on if we just be honest here and you know and stop you know glorifying these natural elements are only worth 84 cents and i've got this down god take control of me take control of my thoughts and my emotions because there might be certain feelings or certain thoughts but that's first of all it's surrendering ourselves in the hands of god so many times we can quote the scripture resist the devil and he'll flee from you but we miss the first part of that scripture which is the strength to resist and that is submit yourselves to god submission means our feelings our thoughts our attitudes are being submitted all to him he could probably preach a month or sundays on that last statement i made with letting our loved ones see it in us so how many times brother branham took questions of even between where you had a spouse serving the lord one not or one going to a methodist church and and one wanting to come to the tabernacle and brother brahma dressed he addressed that all you know i'm glad god had him address that what wisdom brother samuel how can you say it because i know sometimes that no where we're at in our journey sometimes i can look back even in certain things and look back and say god has given me grace to grow not that you become loose but that you realize my perspective on that just wasn't exactly where it needed to be see part of maturity is being able to recognize the greatness of our need in him and that we within ourselves can do nothing and you see brother brandon because think about it i mean brother joyce it maybe have been us we had been saying you make sure he's got to come with you bless god if he don't you divorce him i got pages and pages and pages on those things you know what brother brahms said to them when we're not having service here go with them it ain't because you're looking for food but what is it doing to win that life oh brother samuel they want to go to a family barbecue on sunday that don't apply that don't apply that don't work well i'm going to win them to cry win them to what when them to sunday's a special day we'll just be religious around the grill we're going to have a good family time without jesus christ being the center you see without him and your life being the center where is the drawing power what are you trying to draw them to well i want us just to be a nice family i want us just to be this it should be that god i want your life to lay touch an impression upon their lives like to smell when they're cooking those hamburgers or them steaks and they're just getting them seared and putting the garlic salt on them and the butter so it'll sizzle and all of a sudden you're there going lord have mercy boy i want hungry but now i'm ready is everything ready to go you're not saying it in a take charge voice you're saying it in angry is everything ready why you're s everything's got perked up there that's that's that's how christ living through our life is to be right but i want what you got right you better all right apply in confidence believing it's going to help when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband talk to your wife talk don't worry i got my timer i always do but when i look at this as i'm reading through it and i've prayed god just take the lord as we're standing here as i do each time and amplify what needs to be amplified talk to not lecture husband you should never talk to your wife as though she's your little girl and sisters you should not talk to your husband as though he's a little boy god didn't call you to raise him either way i know miriam young and raise him as you want him to be no that that that's not a quote train them in the way that they should go no that's not that don't apply to marriage but come on sometimes we're good lecturers daddy's too lord you know as we have to change as our kids get older and you start recognizing wait a minute here and i'm just it's hard it's hard because you're trying to find that because their steel has to be let me tell you something i can't get into all this today but standards and boundaries start from when they are young and all the way till they're older just because they're 18 does not mean well they just do what they want you know if they want to go to church i should have a paddle and take you in my office but you know what that because that has become the attitude of the home optional brother samuel don't they all have to have their own they do have to have their own experience but this is what i'm talking about fathers young men and children all are on different levels fathers know those same boundaries and standards have to be put in place that you just don't say well they're young men now i mean they're young men they're a marine age i mean come on autopilot but paul through titus said older brothers fathers not just older ones but fathers get a hold of those young men speak to them about being sober-minded in other words their minds all out here but try to draw it in and you can't go up and just say well you shouldn't be that way you shouldn't be this way how do i know that because you condensed to remember when you and i had 18 year old thoughts am i preaching the message that was what sister meaty had a problem with when rebecca ran out the door what do you expect me to be some wallflower in here playing rock and roll music on the piano in the house watch how brother branham approached that boy i tell you brother branham did not say she's 18 years old she can listen to whatever kind of music she wants to listen to in the house not at all but listen to me neither was brother brown i'm a dictator that's why everything starts when they're little and goes all the way up so by the time they get to that and then pressures are coming they're experiencing music out there experiencing this there has been standards and boundaries all along you say boundaries tell me what keeps the ocean in check is it a new standard no same moon and what is the moon the moon is the type of the church keeps things in check i put it to be an ornament there in the seasons and to declare the different seasons that's why we need as parents as husbands as wife is let the light shine on me because god has placed me here to be a father to be a mother to be a wife to be a husband all those parts of grandfather let the rays of the light so shine so that might emanate through my life over the time i walk on the water and walk on your wife's heart walk all over your husband this gospel produces a life that goes outside a church that's the effect that's what the gospel that i preach it has an effect i'm not preaching something that i'm not a partaker of i'm preaching what i know to be the truth that's why brother branham lays it so clearly by the word of god you marry someone who believes like you believe [Applause] the problem with ahab and jezebel ahab did ahab was a wishy-washy guy we're just loving jesus you know and he married jezebel she's so beauty she's so pretty brother braham said that had to be the only thing she got going for her because she was a cruel woman in heart so what are you really marrying not this because this gets aged i mean [Laughter] comb went out of my cabinet a long time ago but where do you what do you marry character that's what you set your anchor in is real character i'm just going i'm going to preach while i'm here i don't care if a young man or a young lady comes to church with you i watch them how they behave in church and if this is the most boring thing in the world for them let me tell you what your home's going to be your home will be hell you want somebody that'll walk with you be a help with you somebody who loves the lord with you as a matter of fact you want somebody who loves the lord even in a greater way than you do so it'll challenge your walk with god [Applause] you don't want to have to pack them and pack them and pack them you weren't meant to be anybody's pack mule and even if your spouse isn't serving the lord you're not their pack mule be thou an example because i'm putting anybody down from decisions but these things i got to speak plain as it's coming to me girl might be the nicest person in the world doesn't mean that that should be your husband or your wife whoo mama apply it now watch this effect here i'm going to end on this quote but you know that can be deadly i got just a little bit more to go here apply it and create that atmosphere around you oh so applying it there's an atmosphere that comes that'll just that they'll just drop right into it before anything ever started coming out of the earth in genesis 1 the spirit of the lord applied himself he didn't stand way back he applied himself that's what it means he began to he began to make love laying over now that didn't mean he's just letting the earth go no he there there is standards there is that which coming he's applying that word but notice there is with such a love that it's going to come to pass there is an atmosphere that must be present that's why in your homes all of our homes your atmosphere is very important things that you give yourself to what you allow in your home i'm just saying this to be very clear spirits travel by words it's very very very little samuel this is so simple i know i know i know i know but you know i kind of feel like brother branham when they kept on probing him and i'm hearing this all the way when i was traveling brothers brother branham you need to be teaching these people uh algebra come here i'm going to pray for you brother brian said i appreciate that brother i want to go on with god but if you'll let me return the favor too and let me pray for you because how can they learn algebra if they don't know their abcs that's it brother bill always believe christ simple it's simple but god help me to be simple this message does not cause us to be i know and bless god you gotta come to our church and we've got the unfolding of the fold of the unfold and we fold and we fold and we i do too when we fold sheets and towels and everything else but when i consider an unfolding i'm looking at when god unfolds himself he is coming to fold himself into somebody wow lord this is they'll just drop right in if you got the token you create a spirit around you a power a power that when you walk people know that you're a christian they love you for love for you to say something to them they believe your word and what you say they hold on to it that's it apply the token and then walk with it prayer with a such a love such a confidence being salty and that appliance let me say this right now the strength of your relationship with the lord will also translate to that of your household are you hearing me it it translates to that it has in other words there there's an effect that comes from with that let me just maybe that's i don't mean the same thing but i don't want that to be algebra let's just bring it down here for people like me in other words a people a person cannot say i'm got such a wonderful relationship with the lord my prayer life's so good and they're bitter that that don't work oh i got such a wonderful prayer life that i'll tell you brother so-and-so and sister so you're going through the motions but you're really not praying this is why listen who we're trying to uncover here is the enemy you're not the enemy i'm not the enemy let's let it be known satan is the enemy his objective is to try to come and hinder relationships because he knows the power of christ being revealed through a father through a mother through a husband through a wife through a brother through a sister he knows the power of that that that itself will have more effect than every word that we can say that's why i would be just encourage us and i'm just going to stop here that's why i just encourage us we didn't get very far page two that's because we had a big definition on page one and we'll pick it up at another time here but if applying it let me just stop with this say this see sometimes on the stop we're doing a rolling stop like i tell my boys when i'm in the past you see uh you stop i hadn't seen the white line yet so it made me thrown up here am i right brother rocco i'm not just looking for a stop sign i want to know the white line so it's not right here maybe it's up there i need to roll on up there a little further but to apply it but joy to apply it this word that god has given us you know what i love about this we don't have to be the smartest person in the world i don't have to know every quote in other words i've got to be able to give that and i recite the quote i don't have to know every verse now that's not excusing us not giving ourselves to the lord but what's important is that our lives what we are hearing and we're reading it's soaking in down here it can come right in right here but remember as it comes down here so god i want it to sink down in here listen i want to apply it that is part of applying it lord i want this word lord teach me lord show me the things i i'm seeing some things right here this morning but i'm asking you lord to teach me and to show me you know what that is that's relationship with the lord jesus christ he's not given you a word and he's not present to make it live that's brother aaron when when satan came to eve in the form of the serpent he came to her and said yea hath god said god meaning object one whose self-existence far off he wasn't self-existent not at that time remember he existed with his thoughts now his thoughts have become manifest and god had already revealed himself as lord god jehovah one who's not it's not existing with his family but one who has become family and what satan was trying to do is your daddy don't understand it your mama won't understand it oh they're so far off and they're so this and let's just be honest as parents that's where i believe the holy spirit would take the prophet and tell us regarding that was sister rebecca and she ran out that way and brother brown could tell sister meaty meaty she's 18 years old and he didn't say well we just need to let her do what she wants to do you know she's an 18 year old she can vote i could make some comment i won't she can vote you know she can do this we're not letting society determine maturity that's a big problem right now preach brother samuel you got mature men maybe drawing social security in a basement playing a video game whoa i see that stop line i see it way on out there but what did he say you gotta think 18 year old thoughts you know what sister meat he said sister amanda she's gonna say glory to god who pray you know what she said that's my daughter she didn't realize you know what brother brown had to tell her meaty i am your husband father of the children but what's been spoken is the same thing that god has spoken to other parents he didn't say those exact words but he told her he said he's letting her know this is not just a dad and mom conversation god the prophet looks like friend this message is not from the mind of a man it came from the mind of god so everything that in our homes it should be with the application of everything the principles should be from the word of god not subtly intentionally not something we nail up on a wall but something that we is within our lives you've got to think 18 year old thoughts yay hath god said he doesn't even understand you look at him he's off looking at his phone and you're in your bedroom and there's no relationship whoo brother carl is that stop lying back there by you somebody keep moving that strip on the floor you understand what i'm saying what's he trying to do trying to put it in a manner god had already revealed himself as one with his family other words you're tempted come to me come to me i'm not going to look and say how could you joy how could you be tempted that way boy you ought to know god wants to so make himself known by his word that the word is not something that's canceling you out but if there's something that's wrong in your life you have a place to come to somebody to talk to god with skin on i write them to you fathers because you have known him who is from the beginning i write unto you young men the zeal and the strength that's necessary right now to take this message and press it on right unto your children oh for you have been forgiven of your sins i write unto you that you don't have to look over your shoulder your sins are forgiven press on to perfection press on to the mark that's not somebody who's distant that's somebody who's right there walking with you heavenly father lord i i don't know where to stop it lordy i thought i could see a place lord earlier even when i was looking this morning just sensing lord but i'm always father and i know lord your children they feel the same way and that's what they desire lord as a pastor as any man of god any ministry that stand here is just obey the lord because lord this this spiritual food its nourishment to us now father would you help us lord i'm asking you lord humbly as a father and as a husband lord in the natural i'm asking you lord god as a pastor i'm asking you all of these things and i believe there's others lord that they'd like to join in the same request help me lord to apply this token in the right way lord because it can't just be applied anyway it's got to be applied as your prophet put it he said in prayer with love and consideration applied in confidence applied in such love lord help god every [Music] each and every one every parent every spouse every child of god right here this morning lord i'm sure we all can look under the great mri of the word of god as it searches the very intense things of our heart or maybe there's one here this morning that they still have ought in their heart against maybe a parent but may they recognize god and enter in right now and realize lord that they can't carry that on in their life not not just me telling them lord but to realize that satan would love that scar to so affect them and how that they would relate to others raise their children or it goes on and on how they would relate to others in the body of christ they might lord god be a wonderful believer wonderful brother and sister but maybe lord god recognizing like paul would say don't give no place to the devil if you recognize there's something and you might even have a right to have that ought or to have that hurt but as a lamb of god why don't you just forfeit it to the lord and say lord i just give it over to you i committed to you lord i i surrender i don't want anything lord to hinder that relationship i want you to teach me papa help me lord god maybe he is sitting here this morning maybe 70 years old maybe 80 i don't know i don't know the exact ages and things like that but i pray i look at it here in this year as of this day this very day father's day in 1995 is where the holy spirit took a hold of my life [Music] 27 years later [Music] i love you more now lord and i know i realize i need you more now lord god i need you lord and i'm sure that every one of our my brothers and sisters can say the same thing lord as we as we grow in you [Music] we learn to rely less upon the flesh and rely upon the holy spirit [Music] lord we're thankful we don't all like your prophet would teach us over and over we are not born fully matured [Music] even spiritually your prophet would take us lord all the way through the message showing us how we grow even how paul would write that in the scriptures we grow lord god that's our desire we want to grow i want to grow lord in every capacity lord god that as a son of god as a husband as a father i don't want to just lord you know i've asked you and i continue to ask me help me to be a better daddy teach me father teach me to be a better husband help me lord show me i'm not coming to i don't want a plateau no plateau that's the same as being backslidden you come to a spot you're no longer on fire and moving forward but lord god i want to keep moving [Music] i find where your prophet could stand there and on the wings of a snow white dove in 1965 and he could refer to after the seals had been opened and he would stand there where he would wrote in rock in white eagle right there on that mountain in arizona he would speak let the let the dove the holy spirit in eagle time prophetic time let it lead us let it guide us eagle the sharp eye that's able to reach down and uncover things in our life that has been hindrances things that god could say i'm here to free you my son i'm here to free you my daughter oh we can be fully brother samuel are you saying i'm not sealed i'm not saying you're not sealed you can be a sealed away believer in jesus christ and the holy spirit can go down and begin to deal with complexes deal with things that maybe you've carried as a child scars and other things and he can go right down remember he is jehovah rafa not just when you've got a cut on your body but he could go down and like no other he can minister to your spirit won't you just let him do it the prophet would say in that place think of it one growing and maturing and in prayer to the lord jesus he could say lord this word this revealing of yourself has led me to a faith i've never had before this is where lord as our faith must continue to grow our lives as children of god must continue to grow help us lord no matter where we would fall at children young men or fathers no matter i'm glad to be here and i want to keep pressing on if i'm a child i'm glad to be here i'm glad my sins are forgiven i'm glad to be here a part of the body i want to keep pressing on if i'm a young man i'm glad to be here things that god has begun to open and show me i want to use the zeal and the strength under his leadership if i'm a father i want to be effectual because a father is not somebody who has on a designated long robe or badges on the sleeve that recognize i've been around the message or i've been in this church for so long right no no that's not a father but i went out to consider the prodigal son when he came home this is what i see as a father one who was willing to take his garment and pull it up and tuck it [Music] as one who is girded so that he can run to meet his son it was a shame for a patriarch that his legs would be shown but lord that was only a great type of how that in humiliation you came down to rescue me rescue my brothers rescue my sisters lord god help us help us lord help us a lot help us to apply it lord the applying of the word lord sometimes the applying of the word or it may not seem real real spiritual but the word is the word and the holy spirit would give us direction no no this is not done in the house but it's not just we don't do this we don't do that but it's it's there sometimes that application of the token oh it isn't quoting revelations chapter 8 and there was a half hour of silence no but the application of it well i'm going to set it down and i'm going to play a tape so they can hear it that's wonderful but the application of it it comes down how do you apply it when they're three years old four years old you apply the word the living before them there's boundaries there's judgments there's justice there's that within the word of god even the simple things of obedience and respect [Music] that's applying the token oh god help us sometimes lord we've made the applying the token we've made it so way out there and so deep that we've missed the opportunities and our responsibility that that application it comes down in every facet of our life god grant us the strength anybody want to be remembered say lord help me i got both of my hands up if i had more hands i'd put them up i'm not saying that to cause you to do it i'm just saying god help me maybe you don't even have children right now maybe this isn't just about whether you have children or not you might be a grandfather might be whatever as a believer all across the board lord help me lord help me lord god in the application of the word teach me lord grant it lord god may you just move lord across every need you know where that need is specifically in each of our lives you're that kind of a father that you know your children lord god not one who's distant from us not one who can't understand us but one who's right here with us thank you father minister to your children lord god even as we would leave from this place here in the lord in in in a time and i pray that god even through the week through the day lord as we meditate upon that and that's a that's the heart's cry lord help me to apply it lead me direct me lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen don't you love him hallelujah amen i want to share something with you but i let's just sing let's just sing we'll we'll get to it at another time don't you love him amen oh i just appreciate the lord so much maybe i will go ahead and share it real quick [Music] you know when billy brother billy paul he once serving the lord brother billy paul tells his testimony he came in and brother brown think of this brother iran was preaching the message the prodigal son [Music] and in the midst of that message a deacon feels so impressed he goes and sits down by brother billy and says you need to give your life to the lord you need to do this brother billy paul after the service walked on but the next day brother branham had a meeting with brother billy palm and he said billy i want you to know he said i talked to that deacon he said because what he did was not right brother braham said i told that deacon when god deals with his heart god deals with his heart but see god's dealing sometimes we're not seeing the movement right there and we're just saying jesus here here it is he's not moving is this all right he ain't gonna trip are you he ain't moving so jesus i'm just gonna bring him along jesus i'm gonna jesus i'm helping you you ain't helping jesus you ain't helping jesus you think i could do that did you you ain't helping jesus like that but see i'm going back where you were but here's what brother branham did when brother billy paul he wasn't living there in the house he was living down with his grandma that one brother brown that was he went down there brother branham every tuesday was fishing day with billy paul and it went because brother branham liked fishing it was because [Music] he won't come to where i am i gotta go to where he is [Music] it didn't mean that brother branham walked over there to him and said all right we're going to spend time together chapter 3 she must be born again god take a hold of my no i'm not saying things to be funny i'm trying god's given direction on how to apply it if if brother branham had done that billy paul would have been further on away you know what he needed he needed contact with god sometimes it's not what we're saying remember apply it and let it create an atmosphere sometimes we're wanting to see come on again sometimes we're wanting to see this on out here lord i want to see this but genesis 1 said the spirit of the lord god said let there be light what was he speaking to the need that was present to address the darkness there are seeds that's down beneath that darkness you got to believe that there's a son and daughter of god beneath that child of yours there's a son and daughter of god beneath that wife or that husband yours you've got to believe it that way you say why do i have to believe it that way because then you can recognize if that's what it is that the desire is then you operate by the things of god and recognize your words matter your words matter [Music] words create an atmosphere is that right but then after after those words the bible said after the words went forth remember the spirit of god travels with the word [Music] this is why the words must be spoken and it isn't always quote in scripture sometimes you need to be the scripture in flesh [Music] but they need to be born again be an example of born again we're not people aimlessly wandering around are you hearing me now i don't want people to sh i don't want people to shut me out but then we're not talking about appeasing people but i'm talking about letting that life make contact it's an atmosphere what brother graham say that atmosphere they'll drop into it it might be your grandson or your granddaughter and here you are sitting on the bank hey house think going to school [Music] what are you doing opening up conversation i have become all things through all men then i might win some to christ man it keeps opening that's part of our application it don't that don't seem you're okay you can go on back maybe for now that don't seem real spiritual does it brother aaron man that's real i'll tell you what i'm really deep i'll let them i'll let them know about the white horse rider and the raiders right now i'm not making light of those things but sometimes what what it is they need to see is they need to see the power in you that's already overcome the white horse the red horse the black horse and the pale horse and let him right in in power in our life for the seals are not a teaching the seals are not a doctrine the seal is the uncovering of satan's attempted destruction and the revealing of the mighty conqueror who's in our midst that's what the seven seal is it brings him down to earth in perfection in bright form if i can put it this way it's now jesus walking in shoe leather with a lunch box to your job the seventh seal brother adam preached the seventh seal to the infidel with the apple tree [Music] come on is that right he preached it it's christ there is an intelligence that's controlling the life in that tree he's letting him know there's a greater intelligence that if you let him he'll take a hold of your life and he'll control your life to where your life will produce what the word said it would produce [Applause] amen it's relationship [Music] timer's still on but it's in the red [Music] but i believe god has spoken to us so personally help us aren't you glad i want to be helped i want to be healthy i want to be helped i want to be helped so don't ever remember how the scripture said brother joy who had despised the day of small things it's like when you you take your grandchildren hunting and things like that and others i ain't blessing that because it's hot but you know what i'm talking about right here i'm talking i'm preaching the things that i believe when the young people we started having youth meetings and some of the rest of them started coming josh you remember this you and brian others who know it as well too well so he's gonna have to call some people's names that i could call it shane because you know what when we believe it or not [Music] sister roseanne we had some of the first youth meetings you could hear a pin drop if i wasn't talking nobody was talking now against the place and say hey i'm going to do a bible study here and they're talking they're just i love it but you know some of it where it comes down to i had i began to ask god lord how do i how do i get them to talk how do i get to them how do i get to them because i want to reach that heart [Music] so i know these guys and some of the rest you know rocco he's not here
