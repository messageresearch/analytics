We long, Lord, for that moment to be able to see you face to face. But Lord, until that moment arrives, we're expecting to see you in this service. We're expecting to see you, Lord. And father each part of our life Lord moment by moment by moment Lord as your prophet would tell us that dear God our lives to be occupied and he would say plant the potatoes Lord God I want to see you father in every potato that we're planting and all that we're doing I want to see you Lord I want to see your coming Lord in every decision that lays before me I want to just sense your influence Lord God for Lord Jesus that's what we're trusting in Lord we're living in an hour Lord God that fathers beyond that of what our reasoning Lord God beyond what Lord the mind of mortal man but Father we're thankful God for the privilege to be able to enter into that intelligence oh God it's not an artificial intelligence it's the mind of Christ and how privileged we are Lord we want you to know we we love you Lord We're so appreciative, Lord, in this hour, Lord, for you're the real source of life. You're our source of strength. You're our everything, Lord. You're our everything. We love you, Lord. We so appreciate you. We just want to see you more. May you just come by our way tonight, Lord. Just come and breathe, Lord, upon your word. breathe upon our hearts, Lord, that we might see you, Lord, and see ourselves in the word and, Father, see the application of it in our lives, Lord. Make it real to us, Lord. I pray. Granted, Lord, we just commit ourselves, Lord, into your hands tonight. Ask you'd just come minister to every single need, Lord. We love you and we thank you, Father, in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. Amen. It's so good to be gathered together and u just so appreciate um your prayers and uh Lord willing here maybe on Sunday I'll try to [clears throat] share just a few photos and things with you from the meetings there in in in Belgium in Newport. And I certainly um you were certainly a part of it and uh you may not have been there physically but your prayers and um I tell you I could certainly I sense the prayers and and just to be able to I don't know just to be able to describe all that that the Lord did within those meetings. Um it was just just really well it's always miraculous when he comes &gt;&gt; and um you know where hearts were delivered, hearts were filled and and hearts were settled. And so we so so thank God for his mercy and just a wonderful wonderful group of people. And of course, brother David Iverson, we were blessed to have him here on that one Thursday when he spoke about belittling spirits. And some of you remember that and that was just a powerful service. And so we just so appreciate brother David and the saints there. And uh but uh it's good to be back home. And uh I think I'm I think I'm finally starting to get my feet under me. And uh it's just one of those things you feel real good and you and then all of a sudden it seems like the battery wants to wear out and run down real quick. But uh nonetheless, it's it's good to be back home. And uh so it's good to see each and every one of you. Amen. Let's read here just one one verse of scripture, then we'll let you be seated. For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, in returning and rest shall you be saved. in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. Now, God had laid this out to Israel be the whole background of it, which is not what I'm going to really focus on tonight, but Israel was under [clears throat] they were under siege or and Judah was under siege and God was admonishing them not to trust in the arm of flesh or the arm of man. And you'll find that repeated many times in the scripture because there's always a part about within us that we can somewhat incline to that of the flesh. And that's something we always got to push away. It's just and the flesh isn't the just these 16 elements. It's your spirit, your human spirit as well. Many times we'll have to push those things away. reasoning and you know you you have to push those things aside whether it's a doctor's support or or you're praying for a loved one and you've got to you've got to go beyond what you can see what you hear and even the reasoning that's there and you have to just push that away and say look I'm not going to rest on that it's not even going to be my strength that's going to get a hold of them it's not going to be my strength that's going to change the doctor's report but it's going to be the Lord &gt;&gt; Amen is faithful and so within this I love that scripture In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. Amen. May God bless you as you're being seated. I want to read one more scripture here before I give you my title tonight. John writing and says, "Now, little children, abide in him that when he shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming." If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him. Now in the Old Testament, a man was deemed righteous by doing or following as what he did. But this scripture, as John would write of this multiple times, it's dealing of with the inward work of the grace of God in the heart of an individual to whereby it's righteousness from within. So it's not me doing something to obtain righteousness or merit righteousness, but it is coming back to the work of the grace of God in our life and then from out of our life comes forth a righteous work because there's a real there's a real fountain, a real source on the inside. And I want to draw [clears throat] from this here tonight in these two scriptures and speak on a godly confidence and um begin to look at this here and how God will just take us through this in this moment. Brother Bram says it like this. He says, "Men and women who's made in the image of God stand and say that God's word is not right. They doubt this and they doubt whether it's so or not. And there's a fountain to take care of that." So there's a fountain to take care of instability. There's a fountain to take care of up and down. There's a fountain to take care of, you know, did God mean it or does this or there's a fountain that'll take care of all unbelief and bring us to a place to just simply trust God's word because he said it. Because once we've been brought in contact with God by a relationship and a love affair because that's the whole theme of the gospel is a relationship. That was God's desire to uh come back into that place within man that he had in the garden of Eden. Now evidently and it's very true that through and by the shedding of the blood and then the sending of the Holy Spirit, the spirit of God coming into the heart of man is able to take you and I to a place that was much deeper than what Adam and Eve were. Because where Adam and Eve were at, they could fall from it. But where God has taken us in Christ is sublime security. &gt;&gt; And that's that is God's work because God never saves you knowing that he's going to lose you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is this is God's work in our lives to bring us to that place to where that he would dwell in the very midst of our life and our life actually uh is no longer about us but he's the very theme of our life. He becomes the focal point and the reason for every decision that we're making and we're bringing all things uh in focus within this. So uh Luke, brother Ram goes on to say in this same quote he said I was speaking on a private interviews today and I met a couple a man and his son and I said you can never never go forward until you're perfectly satisfied and know without a shadow of a doubt you're walking in God's will. And then when you know that you're in God's will and walking in his way, nothing can stop you &gt;&gt; because you know where you're standing. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the way you're going. You you know what what what you got in your mind. You know what the will of God is. And then you can do it. And so we understand that with God's will, it's many things that continue to unfold as we walk along the journey. Uh even brother Brandham being the prophet of God, I like how brother George Smith would put it. He said many people he said think he said as though that brother Brandham just could look ahead and just see everything. He said, "But no, he had a walk just like you and I." That God doesn't show us five miles ahead. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Now, God will show a prophet what he needs to see, but remember, just like Jacob, just like Elijah, just like Elijah, on and on we could go. God only shows a prophet what he wants them to know. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And this is why that brother Brandham would say it. Kinsman Redeemer and other places where individuals even testimony there in Shreport. Oh, brother Brandham, I guess you really don't have to pray as much because God just shows you every little thing to do. And he says, nope, that's not true at all. He says, as a matter of fact, he said, I have to wrestle it out even much more than what you do. Because God has a way of so placing it to where that dependency will be so great upon him. And the closer that we get to him, the more or I would say the less reliant that we become on ourselves. And sometimes we don't realize just even much or how much we are still reliant upon our own feelings, upon our own thoughts. But you know, God's not worried about that. He knows all that's going all it needs is a little bit of maturity coming into his presence. And God wants us to agree with the word. He doesn't want to us to force the word upon us and to where that we're walking and we don't understand. But to understand is not that we not that we have everything figured out, but we know that God is present and we're able to see that this is God's plan. I don't know how it's all going to work out, but I know that God's word cannot fail because God cannot fail and he is the word. So when we're walking where we have a place where we can walk with safety and real strength, I I love this scripture here in Isaiah 32:17. The Bible says, "The work of righteousness shall be peace." So the real working of righteousness and and this is even prophetically speaking of Israel and their return, but even how God would minister to them then and to us, the work of righteousness shall be peace. That's what the work of the Holy Spirit comes to minister into our life. Remember the Bible says that as in Isaiah, Paul picks it up in Romans that uh that how beautiful are the feet of them that that bring glad tidings of peace. In the book of Isaiah, it would write our God reignth. And it would speak of the peace that has been brought between God and man. Because when when when the whole the whole cusp of the gospel is that our faith would rise to accept what he's already done. It's a finished work. It doesn't have to go to Calvary. There's not one more thing that he has to do. As a matter of fact, even when God has sent this message in this hour, it was to open or to reveal the way that man had wanted to close off and be closed off to for uh for the believer and God to come back together. But God himself rent the veils of tradition in this hour. So, we're not looking at God through the veils of tradition. We're not looking at God through the veils of a man's ideas. God has rent those veils to where that you as a believer now have come back to as it was on the day of Pentecost and as it was in the day when they walked with God in the cool of the evening. The prophet brings that down in the message, the oneness to where God has brought us back into that place to be able to hear lip lip to ear from God to where it is God. Now God can God will use the agency of a man but it's not a man that's revealing it to you. Remember Jesus said flesh and blood have not revealed it unto you but my father which is in heaven. So this is why it's imperative and necessary for the Holy Spirit to be among us. The spirit of truth to come and reveal his word. Because if we've ever got anything that's come from God, it's truly just come that way. It's because God in his mercy has alerted us and spoke to our hearts. And if it hadn't been for him, it would go right over our heads. So it all comes down to God's grace. So then when you see the whole work of righteousness is peace. The gospel is not meant to bring agitation or condemnation. The gospel does when it's preached. It brings conviction. But it brings conviction because the present a presence of God comes down to convict that heart for to expose the enemy and to and that an individual can realize I don't have to remain in this condition anymore. And the presence of God drawing near to you and I is what lets you and I know who we are. It's like the the young man who was with amnesia in his mind. The prophet tells it at the end of spiritual amnesia. They let him off the bus and they they noticed the guard started noticing this boy. He started looking around and so he thought he'd watch him and finally that boy he started walking over the hill and the guard followed him from a distance. He kept on walking crest that hill and over that hill there was a little cabin and as he walked down that hill &gt;&gt; right out there on the porch there was a father &gt;&gt; and the father stood up and he ran to him and he said, "THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE DEAD." He said, "But I knew you would come home, my son." &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? YOU JUST HAD TO GET HIM BACK IN HIS FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE PRESENCE OF GOD &gt;&gt; HAS COME BY HIS WORD. IT'S FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS. &gt;&gt; WE WERE IN HIS MIND. We were with him the whole time. WE WERE TRANSFERRED DOWN INTO THE LOINS OF THE LORD JESUS. WE WERE ALWAYS A PART OF THE WORD. AND YOU GET A DUCK AROUND WATER, IT'LL RECOGNIZE WHAT IT IS. YOU GET AN EAGLE UNDER THE UNDER THE UH THE PRESENCE OF MAMA EAGLE, it'll recognize &gt;&gt; who it is. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT GOD DOES TO BRING AN awareness and bring a confidence of faith in our lives to rise within his presence. It brings about a peace within our life. And the effect, I love that. The effect of righteousness, quietness, and assurance forever. &gt;&gt; It'll be undisturbed security. That's the effect of this righteousness. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that the enemy won't come and try to trouble your mind, &gt;&gt; but you've got a peace that passes &gt;&gt; all understanding. Amen. &gt;&gt; When when you can't put two things together, but there's a piece that's greater than what you can put together. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S A PIECE THAT HOLDS YOU. &gt;&gt; IT HOLDS you in AN UNDISTURBED SECURITY. IN OTHER WORDS, IT CAN NEVER, NO MATTER WHAT SITUATION, NO MATTER WHAT DOUBT, NO MATTER WHAT THE ENEMY WOULD WANT TO TRY to bring, THERE IS NOTHING can separate you &gt;&gt; from God. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, watch how Paul would write this in Romans 5. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. There's an expectation that faith has given us and not only so but we glory in tribulations also. That last part of that scripture there before I go on that becomes part of growth in our life. &gt;&gt; It didn't say that we'll enjoy them. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; It didn't say that we'll be getting on Facebook and saying, "GLORY TO GOD, I'VE GOT THE BIGGEST TRIAL OF MY LIFE." &gt;&gt; NO. Gloring in our TRIBULATIONS IS NOT PUTTING on a show. IT MEANS A CONSTANT CONSTANT CONSISTENT WALK WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? IT'S NOT BUBBLE DANCING. IT'S NOT GOING AROUND AND I'm going to dance ALL AROUND BECAUSE I'M GOING THROUGH A TRIAL. THAT'S NOT WHAT GLORING IS. GLORING MEANS is that there IS A CONSISTENT AND CONSTANT WALK THAT THE TRIAL THAT THE TRIBULATION IT CANNOT BREAK FROM the confidence THAT GOD HAS PUT IN YOUR LIFE BUT THERE IS A CONSISTENCY that moves on in your life and you realize OVER TIME YOU COME TO THAT UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS EVALUATING your life Lord IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG IS THERE ANYTHING OUT OF TUNE IS THERE ANYTHING OUT OF LINE and then WHEN YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THAT REMEMBER THE PROPHET TAKES us through that in the messages be certain of God. And it's a real key OF INSTRUCTION BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TO BE walking with presuming. But we are to take THE WORD IN BECAUSE IT MATTERS TO US AS BELIEVERS. WE'RE NOT JUST WALKING AROUND AND WELL, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT. BUT IT MATTERS TO YOU AND I. LORD, I WANT TO KNOW IS THERE SOMETHING THAT I have done to displease you? &gt;&gt; Is that how you feel? Amen. &gt;&gt; And believe IT OR NOT, WE'VE done things that displeased him. &gt;&gt; SURE, THE PROPHET did things that displeased him. Matter of fact, the angel of the Lord didn't visit him for 6 months. &gt;&gt; I can go into all of that, BUT YOU SEE, GOD [screaming] SHOWED US WITHIN things through even the training and the maturing. And you know what, brother Brandham could have been a stuffed shirt and kept it all up. But let me just tell you, brother Brandham, he want I'm I'm not glorifying A MAN, BUT GOD DID THIS FOR YOU AND I SO THAT YOU AND I SEEN A SON OF GOD COME TO MATURITY. AND TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE WITHIN US THE SAME QUALITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE SEED THAT IS DWELLING THERE, WHEN THAT GETS TOGETHER, IT WILL PRODUCE THE SAME CHARACTER OF CHRIST. I DON'T NEED TO BE A PROPHET. GOD SENT A PROPHET TO THE AGE. HE DON'T NEED ANOTHER MAJOR PROPHET. THE WORD HAS ALREADY BEEN DELIVERED. GOD HAS ALREADY COME AND MANIFESTED HIMSELF. NOW IT'S TIME FOR THAT WORD TO LIVE IN FLESH. &gt;&gt; THAT WORD TO ACCOMPLISH AND ACHIEVE A BRIDE THAT IS CROWNED AND CAPPED WITH DIVINE LOVE. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And it's working. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's working. &gt;&gt; So, not only so we grow and we glory. So we're not just looking for in the coming of the Lord, but we are are gloring and trusting in the constant and consistent walk knowing knowing what that tribulation workketh &gt;&gt; patience. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember James would write faith workketh patience. There's no other way to have patience &gt;&gt; than without tribulation. Patience is endurance. It's longsuffering. There's no way for patience a completeness. And God's desire for you and I is to have a patience. This is why James would even admonish us, let patience have her perfect work. &gt;&gt; That you be lacking nothing. So tribulation workketh patience. Now I remember separating our flesh from what's on the inside. Our flesh, your flesh, my flesh does not like tribulation. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; And I don't care what size it comes in. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's a small milk carton or a gallon. &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO. &gt;&gt; YOUR FLESH AND MY FLESH does not like tribulation. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Our flesh does not like inconvenience. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; I mean, and it and it ONLY IT ONLY COMPOUNDS IN THE HOUR WE'RE LIVING IN. We're living in a time of great pressure. We're living in a time there's pressure from the workplace, pressure from school, PRESSURE ALL AROUND. Pressure is mounting. &gt;&gt; But I'm glad there is A PLACE that we can go to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let off the pressure. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT AT YOUR WIFE or at YOUR HUSBAND. I'M TALKING ABOUT IN HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SEE, THAT'S PART OF RECOGNIZING even in our own lives, OUR WALK WITH GOD is recognizing even the FRAILTY OF THE HUMANITY AND AND GETTING AWAY even in the times on your walk or your ride home from from work and things AND AND JUST POURING YOUR HEART OUT TO GOD AND JUST SAY, "GOD, I'M HERE TO LET OFF THE PRESSURE." &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO LET OFF THE PRESSURE, LORD, BECAUSE IT'S MOUNTED. IT'S BUILT UP, LORD. AND AND I'M FEELING THE PRESSURES. And we know what you know what I'm talking about where it just gets so hard that sometimes with pressure YOU JUST YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR MIND'S being squeezed in a mail press. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD'S FAITHFUL &gt;&gt; KNOWING that tribulation workketh patience and patience experience and experience hope. So hope expectation is what comes out at the end of it and what what comes even as a product. Not only patience but all of these things become a product and then it's a hope that maketh not ashamed. It becomes an expectation where you can go to somebody else that's going through the deepest of trial and say brother or sister I'm praying for you. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Just hold on. God's working. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may not feel like it but God's working. &gt;&gt; Yes he is. I may not been through the exact same thing, but I just want you to know God is faithful. &gt;&gt; I believe you believe THAT, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW GOD [screaming] IS WORKING ALL THINGS OUT. &gt;&gt; There's an expectation. Do I know how? I don't know how. IF WE KNEW HOW, IT WOULDN'T BE FAITH. &gt;&gt; But there's a real expectation that we CAN HAVE. LIKE JOB could say, I KNOW WHEN I COME OUT OF THIS, I'M GOING TO COME forth as pure as gold. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; I'VE ENTERED THE TRIAL AS GOLD. I'm going to come out AS GOLD. THE TRIAL IS NOT GOING TO DEVALUE ME. THE TRIAL IS NOT GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM MY EXPERIENCE. IF THERE'S ANYTHING AT ALL, IT'S GOING TO PUT STRENGTH IN MY LIFE. IT'S GOING TO BRING ME INTO A GREATER REALIZATION WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; Hope maketh not ashamed &gt;&gt; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts. Why? because God's love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. So there is an incentive. You know, a lot of times they have incentives for things that you can do and you know, they'll have you there's all little tricks and things they'll have you do out in society and, you know, incentives to get people buying and, you know, come in and play our great game and and scratch off the card, spend 50 bucks and we'll give you a a $5 toy and, you know, it just all there's an incentive, but that the I'm talking about a real incentive tonight. Faith is love's incentive. It's the incentive to love. The prophet said, "The only way you can have faith is have love first out of desperation." Faith is love's incentive. It's an incentive to love. If you don't have love, you can't have faith. right &gt;&gt; now. Well, brother Ram, when we dealing with this here in desperation, because remember you uh we understand that even as we uh come through 1 Corinthians 13 that many even of the nine spiritual gifts from the gift of faith to on and on it it would require faith. And this is why Paul would even write and say though I have faith to move mountains &gt;&gt; and I don't have the Holy Ghost don't have love then I'm nothing. Right? &gt;&gt; So it has got to be something that is there and a faith that when we're talking of this faith, we're talking about a faith that comes through and by a settled life and where the LOVE OF GOD BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAS been deposited in that life. We're so we're TALKING ABOUT A GODLY CONFIDENCE. Remember a consistent constant walk and that's what the Holy Spirit produces in our life. This is why brother Rab said, "How can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her?" That's felio. But what about goppo to God? If you don't love God, if you said you loved your wife and you never tell her about it, never sat down and make love to her and expressed it to her, kiss her, hug her, tell her she's the best cook in the country, all the things that you know, I mean, we know how to complain when it's not right. &gt;&gt; You think you could have got these noodles a little bit more tougher? We know how to complain &gt;&gt; that we're natured in that way. And once again, pressure adds to that, &gt;&gt; right? So, but but notice, you know, I think it ought to be something we focus on and say, "God, help me to be attentive. Help me to be attentive, &gt;&gt; right? Help me to BE ATTENTIVE. DON'T DON'T LET THE THE tongue and my mouth be loose." &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, listen. We should be as guarded with our family as we are with one another. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING TO PRAY for even in this coming year &gt;&gt; because we can become very common to one another. &gt;&gt; And we need God's help. But I believe there's great victories. Oh, it may not seem like a great victory, but I believe that's a great victory. &gt;&gt; I believe that's a great victory. OH, IT MAY NOT BE A public show, but after all, what God is doing in this hour, he's not going to rapture a public show. He's rapturing a secret work that will be revealed openly. &gt;&gt; IT'S BEING REVEALED OPENLY THROUGH CHARACTER BEING MOLDED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS &gt;&gt; WHERE THE WORD'S BEING TAKEN IN AND THERE'S THE DYING TAKING PLACE ON THE INSIDE THAT THE WORD MAY COME TO THE FOREFRONT. WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE BEING brought to a Mount Carmel showdown. &gt;&gt; WHERE THE SECRET WORK WILL be revealed openly. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said if if you love her, you express it. And that's the way we do God. When we love him, we tell him about it. &gt;&gt; We sat down and we adore him and worship him. And see, love drives us to do that, &gt;&gt; right? Not that we always feel like it, &gt;&gt; but you know, you ever get around in times and I don't know. I mean, you know, you just get to just thinking about the Lord and just you just tell him, "Lord, I love you." &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I just appreciate you. When you just you just think I mean, it just COMES ALONG YOUR PATH. LORD, I THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; I appreciate you, Lord. I love you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SOME SPECIAL TIME. YOU JUST EVEN AT THAT MOMENT, LORD, I WANT YOU TO KNOW I LOVE YOU. MAYBE THERE'S A THOUGHT. MAYBE AS HE BEGINS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HE'S DONE AND WHAT HE'S DOING IN YOUR LIFE AND HOW HE'S MINISTERED TO YOU AND YOU SAY, "LORD," YOU JUST GET BESIDE YOURSELF, MAYBE THERE AT THE WORK AND SAY, "I love you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I appreciate you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; LOVE DRIVES US TO DO THAT. HE SAID, "NOW, what if there was something that had to be done for your wife? She got cancer, TB, and she's fixing to die. It would throw you into desperation." And he says, "Now we must have love before we can have faith." &gt;&gt; And when we HAVE GENUINE LOVE, WHAT DOES IT DO? IT PUSHES our faith out on the battlefront for God. &gt;&gt; Genuine godly love for God and for his word and for his people will push faith out there. Love just takes a hold of faith and says, "Come on, let's go." And it goes out BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT LOVE DOES. YES. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR CHILD HAS WOKE YOU UP in the middle of the night and you don't know how you're going to clean EVERYTHING UP. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE EVEN GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH TO THE MORNING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S SO GOOD. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT. [screaming] LOVE DRIVES YOU TO DO THAT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW IT SEEMS LIKE THE PIECES ARE ARE EVERYWHERE AND AND CIRCUMSTANCE. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO COME OUT. BUT LOVE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL DRIVES YOU OUT THERE TO DO THAT. HOW MUCH GREATER WITH GOD I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE RAM UP THERE, LORD, BUT I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS GOING TO BE A RAM UP THERE. &gt;&gt; SHAMGAR DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WOULD BE THOUSANDS FALL. ALL HE SAW WITH INSPIRATION WAS THAT OX GOAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. &gt;&gt; HIS LOVE, HE BEGAN TO REMEMBER, I'm a covenant keeping. There's a covenant keeping God. &gt;&gt; There you go. Come on now. &gt;&gt; And God made a covenant with me. I don't have to stand back here and let them come in and take everything from us. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Good preacher. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, BILL RAM TELLS US WHEN HE GOES INTO THAT ABOUT SAMGAR, HE SAYS THAT THAT'S HOW THE DEVIL WANTS TO DO. HE SAID, YOU LET A GOOD MEETING HAPPEN. YOU LET GOD BEGIN TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU AND THE DEVIL IS RIGHT THERE TO SHOW UP TO TRY TO TAKE IT FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; AND IT WON'T ALWAYS COME THE WAY YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT. IT MAY NOT BE THROUGH THE SAME WINDOW. IT MAY NOT BE THROUGH THE SAME TEMPTATION, BUT YOU CAN COUNT ON THE DEVIL BEING THERE. BUT LISTEN, DON'T MISS WHERE GOD IS POINTING OUT IN HIS WORD THE OX GOLD AND SAY, "DEVIL, I'm ready for you." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD HAS ASSURED ME OF THE COVENANT. &gt;&gt; AND LOVE PUT HIM OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; WHAT PUT DAVID out there on the battlefront? &gt;&gt; LOVE. LOVE PUT HIM OUT THERE. BEFORE DAVID EVEN HAD ANY ANY VISION, DAVID ALREADY SAID, "WHY'S EVERYBODY STANDING AROUND? THIS guy out there running his mouth. &gt;&gt; Remember what his brother said." Oh, &gt;&gt; so you think you're more spiritual. &gt;&gt; We know. You know the scripture. We know that they they're they're so-called discernment. &gt;&gt; But suspicion's not discernment. &gt;&gt; We know the naughtiness of thine heart. That's so good. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE WHAT THEY COULDN'T DO IS NO MATTER HOW THEY WANTED TO SHAME HIM AND AND EVERYTHING ELSE, THEY COULD NOT TAKE AWAY THE EXPERIENCE AND RELATIONSHIP THAT DAVID HAD WITH GOD AND DAVID SAID, "I'M NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THAT." RUNNING DOWN GOD'S PEOPLE. DAVID COULD EVEN LOOK AT THE MAN THAT WAS BELITTLING HIM AND SAID, "I'M NOT GOING TO STAND. YOU'RE YOU'RE AN ISRAELITE. YOU GOT A COVENANT [screaming] WITH GOD. AND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THE DEVIL RUNNING YOU DOWN, MY BROTHER." AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, WHAT [screaming] LOVE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; LOVE OUT ON THE FOREFRONT. THAT'S why the prophet said when David WENT DOWN THAT HILL, HE SAID he went down there dancing cuz he already knew &gt;&gt; the victory &gt;&gt; belong to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So love just takes a hold of faith, grabs it by the hand, and says, "Come on, let's go." THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT ISN'T FAITH DRAGGING LOVE. &gt;&gt; LOVE GRABS A HOLD OF FAITH AND SAYS, "Let's go." &gt;&gt; Glory be to God in the highest. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram goes on. John 14:23, Jesus said, "If a man loves me, he'll keep my words." Now, you can't keep his words without having faith in what he said. If he loves God, then he keeps God's word. If he said, "I'm the Lord that health thee," HE BELIEVES THAT. LOVE MAKES HIM BELIEVE IT BECAUSE LOVE DOMINATES ALL. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL SAID IT AIN'T FOR YOU AND LOVE SAID SHUT YOUR MOUTH. &gt;&gt; COME ON FRIENDS. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IT LIKE THIS. HE SAID IF SOMEBODY CAME TO ME AND THEY TOLD ME BRANDHAM IS NOT LIVING TRUE TO YOU, HE SAID I WOULD DOUBT [screaming] THEIR WORD BECAUSE I'VE GOT A LOVE AND A CONFIDENCE TO KNOW HER. AND HOW MUCH MORE ABOUT GOD WHEN THE DEVIL WANTS TO COME AROUND AND SAY, "GOD DON'T LOVE YOU. GOD DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU. GOD DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR SICKNESS. HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN? IT'S BEEN THIS LONG. HOW MANY PRAYER [screaming] REQUESTS HAVE YOU WROTE? HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU PRAYED? WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO?" HE'S TRYING TO BREAK YOUR CONFIDENCE IN GOD. BUT LOVE STANDS THERE AND SAYS, "I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. I DON'T [screaming] KNOW HOW." BUT LEFT SAID, "COME ON, FAITH. WE'RE GOING TO STAND RIGHT HERE ON THE FRONT LINE." [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause] &gt;&gt; THEY CAN CALL US A FOOL. THEY CAN CALL US CRAZY. THEY CAN SAY, "YOU AN OLD MAN AND YOU'RE MAKING A PAYMENT ON A DOCTOR BILL. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY, BUT I'M [screaming] GOING TO STAND HERE BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT GOD HAS SAID." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And love says, "Give me your hand, faith. Let's go." G. &gt;&gt; Well, faith says faith don't say how it's going to be. Faith is just a master of every circumstance. &gt;&gt; Faith just says it's going to be. &gt;&gt; How? I don't know, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE. &gt;&gt; GOD [screaming] WILL MAKE A WAY. &gt;&gt; HE'S OPENED SEAS BEFORE. HE'S OPENED RIVERS BEFORE. HE'S KEPT MY BRETHREN IN A FIERY FURNACE. HE KEPT DANIEL IN THE LION'S DEN. HE'S THE SAME [screaming] GOD. AND HE MAKES no difference cuz he's not a respected person. That's so good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which cannot be removed. &gt;&gt; But abideth forever. As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth, even forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous. I want you to catch this verse. I I can't really deal with this right now, but I want you to notice the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. And if they put forth their hands unto iniquity, then the rod is coming. But when the rod comes, it's only to bring the righteous back in line &gt;&gt; because the wicked won't come back in line. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because the wicked is resting in reasoning. The wicked is resting in their own understanding. BUT THE RIGHTEOUS WILL HEAR THE WORD AND THEY'LL RESPOND TO THAT WORD. GET BACK IN LINE. GET BACK IN STEP. GET YOUR EYES BACK ON THE WORD. THE RIGHTEOUS WILL respond right back to the word. &gt;&gt; But they that trust in the Lord. You can't have trust in the Lord and it be partial. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's got to be complete. &gt;&gt; It can't be part trust here and part trust in mama, part trust in, you know, in your job. It's got to be trust in the Lord. Because you see, when it's not, you become a divided person, &gt;&gt; and you become interested in trying to accommodate yourself to all of those other people that you're trusting in. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU TRUST in the Lord, YOU ACCOMMODATE YOURSELF TO THE LORD. AND THE BIBLE SAYS it like this, he'll make your enemies to even be at peace with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You see, THIS IS THIS IS THE PROMISE. THEY THAT TRUST IN the Lord shall be like Jerusalem that is founded on Mount Zion. AND YOU KNOW GOD, OUR LIFE, OUR EXPERIENCE WITH GOD is founded on divine revelation. &gt;&gt; And divine revelation is not something that's been schooled into you. It's not something that's been wrote on a board and you memorized and repeated and after. That's not revelation. But revelation holds within it. I'm not talking ABOUT KNOWLEDGE. I'M TALKING ABOUT REVELATION. REVELATION HAS A POWER, A CREATIVE POWER WITHIN IT. JUST LIKE WHEN THE LIGHT THAT SHINED, WHEN THE WORD WAS SPOKE IN THE BEGINNING, IT IT PUSHED BACK THE DARKNESS AND REVEALED WHAT WAS DOWN THERE, HOUSED IN THAT DIRT. IT BROUGHT FORTH THAT LIFE AND THAT SEED. AND THAT'S THE SAME THING REAL true revelation does. REVELATION PACKS WITHIN IT TRANSFORMING POWER. IT PACKS WITHIN IT GRACE AND MERCY AND TRUTH AND AND WISDOM. IT IS FULL OF ALL OF THE NUTRIENTS. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID, "OH, HOW WE NEED TO ASK GOD FOR A FRESH REVELATION AND THEN BY IT BECOME THE LIVING WORD OF GOD manifested &gt;&gt; because we can't be the living word manifested without there being a revelation." &gt;&gt; Because who's the revelation? It's him. &gt;&gt; It's him. It's becoming one with him. Because you know it's just like you know when you you look with that it I love many times how Spurgeon Charles Spurgeon will say some powerful things you know and he would say it's good to understand much and to trust in the Lord with growing knowledge but dear soul if you do not know much yet if you're trusting in the Lord you shall be as mount Zion which cannot be removed sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory be to God. YOU SEE WE'RE NOT LIKE THE WIND. Believers aren't like the wind depending on you never know which way it's going &gt;&gt; right. You don't you don't know which way it's going. You we we just had those strong wind days here uh last uh when was it the week ago or however the days all mixed up for me. But you remember those days and how you know you don't know which way it's coming. It coming from this way coming from that way. You don't know. But but you see God wants to bring a confidence. It's a steadiness. It's assurityity. It's a straight going forward. Now notice in Proverbs 3:21, "My son, let not them depart from thine eyes, but keep sound wisdom and discretion, and so shall they be life unto thy soul in the inner part, and grace to thy neck." They what what will bless you inwardly will affect your life outwardly. &gt;&gt; Amen. So to lay to take a hold of the of wisdom and discretion, then thou shalt walk in thy way safely. That's securely, and thy foot shall not stumble. WHEN THOU LIEST DOWN, thou shalt not be afraid. Yay, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. Be not afraid. You know, some of you need to take that that verse of scripture and put it on your alarm clock and say, "Lord, this is my promise." &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. IF THE DEVIL'S BEEN PLAGUING YOU WITH NIGHTMARES and dreams AND EVERYTHING ELSE, YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS SCRIPTURE AND APPLY IT. THE WORD WAS MEANT TO BE APPLIED. &gt;&gt; LORD, YOU SAID YOU'D MAKE MY SLEEP SWEET. YES. &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT MAY NOT BE A TESTIMONY THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING TO SEE, but the many and people know you well enough, they'll be thankful for you getting a lot of sleep. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the most crankiest people when we don't get sleep. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Besides being angry, [laughter] &gt;&gt; come on, friends. &gt;&gt; God is NOT GOING TO LAY DOWN AND SAY, "WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. HE'S GOING TO NO. GOD GAVE US COMMON SENSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO KNOW THEN SAY, "GOD, I NEED STRENGTH IN MY BODY." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I thought right before I was getting ready to go out on on that that the second night was ministering there in Newport and I already already the burden in my heart. I knew there was going to be uh even after that service was going to be praying prayer line. I knew that in my heart. So I I I was back there and I started feeling weak and I thought, "My goodness, I've ate so much protein today and things and I just but I feel weak." Well, you know what I realized is I don't know how long that I'm going to be out there. So I looked through all the chocolate [laughter] &gt;&gt; and I l found a granola bar. I passed all the chocolate aside and I ate a granola bar because you know why? I found myself getting weak. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. I know that ain't very spiritual, but it will help relationships. [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't say amen too loud because I don't want you to get elbowed. &gt;&gt; Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh. For the LORD SHALL BE THY CONFIDENCE, &gt;&gt; AND SHALL KEEP THY FOOT FROM BEING TAKEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU MIGHT FALTER, BUT GOD IS YOUR CONFIDENCE THAT'LL keep your foot from being taken. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF DECISIONS. THERE'S THINGS THAT'S BEFORE US. THERE'S THINGS THAT CAN EVEN LOOK GOOD, FEEL GOOD, SOUND RIGHT, BUT KEEP WISDOM. Keep discretion. Keep it close to you. Let it let it be down in the depths of your life so that it will affect and be the influence. And the Lord will be your confidence. Lord, I'm resting in you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 33:5, "The Lord is exalted, for he dwelleth on high." I love that. He hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness, and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation. THE FEAR OF the Lord is his treasure. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful and wonderful treasure that we have as a believer. the fear of the Lord because that that is a very that the fear of the Lord is clean and the fear of the Lord is is a reverence to the things of God. It's not a slavish fear. It's not a oh if I don't do this God's out to get me. That's not the fear of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But the fear of the Lord is a reverence &gt;&gt; like like the prophet when he preaches the message respects and he covers all of that and the value of respects and real godly fear. But notice will be filled with judgment and righteousness and wisdom and knowledge and under understanding shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation. THIS IS WHY BROTHER BRAM SAYS REMEMBER remember um Elisha and Gahesa and Gahesa went out there and he was trembling because all he saw was one part of the battle. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; All he seen was the doctor's report that was handed. BUT ELIJAH STEPPED OUT THERE AND SAID, "GOD," HE DIDN'T CONDEMN HIM. HE SAID, "LORD, OPEN HIS EYES." &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, BROTHER RAM SAID, ELIJAH DIDN'T EVEN SEE THOSE ANGELS. &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE JUST TOOK CONFIDENCE IN THE WORD, BUT THE AN ANGELS OF GOD IN CAMP AROUND THOSE THAT FEAR HIM AND TRUST HIM. &gt;&gt; ELISHA HAD ALREADY HAD CONTACT WITH IT. BUT YOU SEE, THAT'S THAT'S HOW CERTAIN IT WAS. ELISHA DIDN'T HAVE TO GO OUT THERE AND SAY, "LET ME SEE IF GOD'S STILL HERE." HE KNEW GOD GOD IS RIGHT AROUND ALL THE TIME. I'VE SEEN HIM. HE'S GIVEN HIS WORD. I'M GOING TO STAND ON HIS WORD. AND STANDING ON THAT WORD [screaming] BROUGHT THE EYESIGHT THAT THAT MAN needed to stabilize him. &gt;&gt; Once he could see, &gt;&gt; there is more with us. &gt;&gt; Soon as his seeing changed, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Oh, sometimes that's what God, that's what we need is our seeing change. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the way we're looking at things, friends, we God, we we need our seeing change. Lord, help me to see it the way you're seeing it. Help me not to look AT IT THE WAY THAT I've got it all FIGURED OUT. AND I THINK THIS AND YOU SAY, "WELL, BROTHER SAMMY, THE WAY I'VE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT, LET ME JUST say it to YOU THAT THE WAY YOU'VE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT IS GOD, THEN WHY ARE YOU feeling the way YOU'RE FEELING? YOU CAN'T HAVE THINGS FIGURED OUT AS THOUGH IT'S GOD TELLING YOU THINGS AND YOU STILL GOT GRUDGES AND YOU STILL GOT MALICE AND YOU STILL GOT ENVY AND YOU STILL GOT A GOT A TERRIBLE ATTITUDE. THAT AIN'T [screaming] GOD. BECAUSE WHEN GOD GIVES A VISION, IT DOES NOT LEAVE THAT THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; A lot of times that's our own suspicions. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good. THAT'S GOOD. [snorts] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY EVERYTHING'S GOT TO BE CHECKED BY GOD. YES. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING'S GOT TO I DON'T CARE IF IT'S BEEN 10 OUT OF 10 BEFORE. IF IT'S NUMBER 11, IT better be checked. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Why? Because an evil spirit can come right in &gt;&gt; because remember when God calls the sons of God together, the prophet tells us question and answers on the Holy Ghost all the way uh God being misunderstood. Church order 1963 on and on. He said 1964 question and answers. HE SAID EVERY TIME WHEN THE SAINTS ARE GATHERED, HE SAID SATAN IS RIGHT THERE AS WELL. Are you HEARING ME? THIS IS WHY WE DO NOT TAKE EVERY SPIRITUAL HAPPENING AND DECLARE IT TO BE OF GOD. BUT LET EVERYTHING BE BROUGHT TO THE WORD OF GOD AND LET IT BE PROVEN. &gt;&gt; YOUR FEELINGS AND MY FEELINGS ARE NOT THE URUM. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. &gt;&gt; YOUR FEELINGS AND MY FEELINGS ARE CALLED IMPRESSIONS. &gt;&gt; Good preaching. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. BUT YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK, LOOK BEYOND GOD. I NEED SIGHT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THINGS FOR HOW they really are. &gt;&gt; Now remember Abraham here, Abraham comes up to the mountain and Hebrews 11 records it that he he was accounting. This was his thoughts. Abraham had got to such a place when in his walk with God that he didn't run. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Y'all didn't hear me. I said he didn't run. &gt;&gt; This was something that was very hard. This was harder than famine in the land. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This was harder. EVEN AFTER THE VISITATION OF ELOHIM, he lied &gt;&gt; again. &gt;&gt; That besetting sin was right there. resurfaced. &gt;&gt; That tendency was right there. But through the revealing, listen, but through the revealing of Elohim, not only did it take care of their bodies, it took care of what was needed. &gt;&gt; Because you don't find Abraham doing that again. &gt;&gt; This was the hardest thing that they've had that he's had to go through. Hey, look, Lot was a hard thing for Abraham. &gt;&gt; He loved Lot, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD ASKED YOU TO SEPARATE from something, you listen, it's not hard to separate from the boss. you don't care for, &gt;&gt; right? It ain't hard to separate from the friends that made fun of you and run you down and, you know, picked at you. That ain't hard. &gt;&gt; You're like, "Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless your name, Lord. I love you so much." NO, BUT GOD CALLS YOU TO SEPARATE FROM WHAT? THINGS THAT WOULD BE CROWDING out his love that wants to spread out in your life. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO SPREAD FORTH in your life. And and it was hard when he had to separate from Lot. But he came to this point in his walk with God. And God knew this was in Abraham the whole time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But God didn't microwave it. God didn't do it overnight. A lot of misunderstandings along THE WAY. A LOT OF FAILURES THAT GOD ALLOWED TO BE INCLUDED. But none of them failures, none of them failures, I don't want to do this cuz my Bible's ALREADY TATTERED. BUT NONE OF THEM FAILURES OF THE OLD Testament could get over here in THE NEW. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? COULDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; COULDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE BLOOD. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET WHEN HE PREACHES PERFECT STRENGTH THROUGH PERFECT WEAKNESS AND HE TAKES ABOUT 45 MINUTES IN THE BEGINNING OF IT AND HE'S DEALING WITH HOW WHEN GOD WRITES OUR DIVINE COMMENTARY, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE YOUR MISTAKES THAT ARE WRITTEN AND THAT ARE MENTIONED BECAUSE THE BLOOD IS SUFFICIENT TO TAKE CARE OF IT. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz the blood is the ultimate editor. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; It's the ultimate editor before it goes published. &gt;&gt; Before it's published up there, it's the ultimate eding tool. &gt;&gt; It's not artificial intelligence. It's divine intelligence. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Abraham goes up there. Notice there's these wording when Abraham comes up to this place in Genesis 22. And God AFTER HIS HAND IS DRAWN BACK AND GOD SAID, "NOW I KNOWEST THAT THOU WHAT? Fearest God." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Right. &gt;&gt; Now, you mean to tell me God couldn't have already seen this in him? He did. &gt;&gt; But God wants to see it made flesh, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Cuz you want to know why? Every time that word is becoming flesh in your life, like it is right here, this was an example of God becoming one of us. And the same way when that word remember the prophet tells his future home he said when God thought of himself becoming tangible he thought of you and me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; SO EVERY TIME when the word it's the word becoming tangible THE WORD BECOMING FLESH. IT'S GOD COMING FORTH IN OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; THOU KNOWEST THOU FEAREST thou reverence reverence me. You've not withheld thine only son from me. Notice the prophet said Abraham had to love God to believe him. &gt;&gt; Watch this. You love him and the more you love him, the more faith will accumulate. &gt;&gt; Let me read this here. We're bound, Paul. Paul Paul says, "This is one place. We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meat." When you read first Thessalonians, first Thessalonians, he's admonishing them to grow in faith. But now he says, "Because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity." See, there's no way for faith to grow. And charity is down here like a little peanut. it won't work. See, it grows the it's the love of God working in our lives that causes us to submit. You realize like brother Bram tells us in that statue of a perfect man, he said it's the divine intelligence that's working all of these things down through here. So it is it is divine love that brings even you and I into a place. You know, even when God corrects us and deals with and brings us to a place to where we can actually look and we can see ourselves in the word and say, "Oo, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; forgive me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord." Do you realize that's a love of God? &gt;&gt; And then as we'll submit to that, the love of God goes to work to bring forth in our lives what only he can do. He's not asking you to bring it forth. &gt;&gt; Remember, he's the vine, &gt;&gt; the energy. We're the branches. and the charity of every one of you toward all toward each other aboundeth. So that we ourselves glory in you and the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure. So how is this how is this that their faith and their charity is growing? Does faith and charity grow when we're just sitting around and we're listening to the word of God? Well, faith cometh by hearing. &gt;&gt; Right? But the only way that faith can grow is when there's test and there's trials. &gt;&gt; When there's situations that merit for growth. So the love of God is not going to not going to blossom forth within our life without having opposition to it. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? You know what it is? The reason the opposition comes is to expose the frailty of the vessel &gt;&gt; and to break down the will because remember in order for this to be our will has to be submitted to God. &gt;&gt; And so God knows just how to get us into that place to where within that we can recognize and then with the right kind of a fear we can reverence God. And like Abraham offered up his only his only son. You know the prophet types that in patriarch Abraham and he says what Abraham was doing there is he took what God had given him. He said that's like you as the believer when God has quickened your soul on the inside by the new birth. He said, "Then you walk forth to offer your all to God because from that very place in your life is where a growth of a son and daughter of God grows from." And so here you are. We're called over and over and over again. We're called to an altar. And the altar is not out here. Remember the prophet will tell us in the Revelation series, "The altar's in the mind where God will meet you and you know him." Then he'll say, "The altar is in your heart." Because it's really about self-will. It's about us letting down our own will. And God God allows situation. You know, God knows just how to get us into a place to where our will is broken. &gt;&gt; That is so true. &gt;&gt; And here's the thing about it. He don't feel no different about you or me than anybody else. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? God don't feel no different of, oh my, it took this long to for this one and their will to be broken. God don't feel no different at all. God's interested in his word is going to come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There might be some stubborn dirt, but God knows how to deal with the dirt in order to bring forth the seed. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? All of the things that we've been packed in, the baggage and everything that we collected along the way, the prophet called it the grabag of human life. Things that we've come, all this, we've come packed into our lives. But God gives us grace. Remember the prophet said it like this in the message absolute. He said, "God made me like this." He said for a reason so that when he came he could dig everything out of me. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY DIG IT ALL OUT OF ME DID SURRENDERING. GOD BROUGHT US INTO A PLACE TO WHERE OUR HUMAN FRAILTIES WILL BE EXPOSED. AND YOU MIGHT THINK MY THEY WERE SO GREATLY EXPOSED LAST YEAR OR LAST MONTH, BUT keep walking with God. There'll be more human frailties exposed. accumulate. The Ram says when you are converted to Christ, a love to Christ, then you accumulate a faith in Christ like you would to your wife or to your husband. You accumulate a faith that you walk in that faith. And I I know he said just something about you. You just got something that anchors there. So it's a faith that accumulates. So you mean it isn't all just like we I could ask you right through here that those of you those of us that are married your faith would be greater tonight than what it was should be what it was when we walked down the aisle. &gt;&gt; It's greater because why the love love is really grown. &gt;&gt; Marriage is a place where love for love it's a bedding ground. It's a place that love itself can begin to grow. It's a place that faith can begin to accumulate. Think about your walk with God. You can't listen. You can't separate your walk with God and then and then look back over here. But you got to see God allowed those things to be examples and shadows of what that relationship is with you and him. Because even right now, you take, Brother Ram will say it like this. He said, you take for example somebody, he said an older veteran. And now it don't matter just because they've been old. It don't matter. It don't mean because they're old and they've served God for a long time that man that they got roots real deep. Sometimes they may not have roots real deep. Maybe there's a lot of other things they've accumulated or allowed to be accumulated in their life and instead of being sweet and instead of being welcoming, they're actually kind of cranky. They're actually bitter. There's been a lot of things come along, but they've accumulated the wrong things. You've got to be careful what you accumulate. &gt;&gt; And I'm talking to some of them. We're talking to everybody here, but I know in examples I can use in the natural, sometimes you can begin to accumulate things in the garage, accumulate things in the basement. I'll never forget right before we moved and you know I had no idea we were going to move and that that fall I was working on things clearing out things out of the shed clearing out things out in the basement the storage room where I'd be down there praying I was clearing THOSE THINGS OUT I LOOKED OUT ON THE CURB and I thought DEAR LORD THEY WOULD THINK WE'RE moving right I'm f I'm surprised I didn't have all the little rain stand come up HERE AND SAY WELCOME YOU'RE ONE OF us [laughter] I used to drive by the curb and I think dear God if I was a garbage man I'd quit couches and everything else thrown out there AND THINGS ALL PILED UP ALL ALONG THE CURVE. I dear Lord, it'll take one truck just to make it down two of these places here. &gt;&gt; True, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But you see, we can accumulate the wrong things. BUT IF WE HAD IF THE ROOTS ARE DOWN DEEP, &gt;&gt; then you want HOW DID THOSE ROOTS get down deep? Because there's been a lot of storms. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; You know when you take new trees when they've I remember one time they planted some trees for me and they said, "Oh, the trees will be all right. You don't need to stake them." Okay. &gt;&gt; There was some good good size aritas. Good size. You don't need to stake them. Let me tell you. Let me tell you what happened. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORM, I HAD TO GO OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; SO ANY TREES THAT I PLANT NOW, I DON'T CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE. I'M GOING TO STAKE THEM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I KNOW HOW THAT WIND COMES ACROSS ON MY BACKYARD. AND THANK GOD I STAKE THOSE THAT WE PLANTED BECAUSE IF NOT, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RIPPED OUT. LIKE I LOST A couple of them because they got RIPPED OUT. &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD LISTEN, WHEN WE'RE STARTING IN OUR WALK WITH GOD, GOD STAKES our life. &gt;&gt; God puts supports around you. &gt;&gt; Amen. NOW THE SUPPORTS AROUND YOU and I are there to help us, &gt;&gt; encourage us. &gt;&gt; Hey, how you doing? You doing good? God's good, ain't he, brother Paul? He's wonderful. That's a support. &gt;&gt; He doesn't need a scriptural lecture from me. &gt;&gt; He needs support. &gt;&gt; God is good. &gt;&gt; God is faithful. The word will be preached. The word will be delivered. But you see, it would be just like somebody if you're telling somebody that needs an heart operation or they've got heart problems, it would it would you you'd be beating a dead horse if all you did was just talk about their diet, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Ain't going to work. &gt;&gt; Right. That's good. &gt;&gt; You've got to say, "Lord, give me the words &gt;&gt; on what needs to be said, if anything at all." &gt;&gt; Come on now. That's good. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Sometimes we're so interested in just throwing out words, but sometimes, listen friends, what what the world needs and what people need that are coming here, they need God with skin on it. &gt;&gt; Come on, FRIENDS. NEED GOD WITH SKIN ON IT. BE A SUPPORT. BE A HELP. BE AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO THEM. LET [screaming] THE WORD OH, BROTHER SAMUEL, THEY NEED THIS. THEY NEED THIS. BE PATIENT and let the word do the work. &gt;&gt; BE PATIENT AND LET GOD TAKE CARE OF IT BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY ONE CAN do it. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Your impatience, your frustration ain't gonna get nowhere. Let God do the work. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Accumulate a faith in Christ. Oh God, help us to accumulate the right things. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "I want you to take everything that's been done in this time," he said, and let it be accumulated in your heart. All the signs, the wonders, the word, let it be accumulated in your heart. Say, God, that's that's what that's what we want. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We want the right things to be accumulated. The right things to be built up within our hearts and our lives. &gt;&gt; We want our hearts to be filled with God's word. Amen. Let's stand. Thank you Lord. Godly confidence. A godly confidence. Abraham accumulated faith. His trust. You've seen this. Abraham's trust it grew. His faith. How did his faith grow? Because his love grew. And as the love of God, as it grows, even in Abraham did not have access like you and I have. But he was able to come to that place to where we read about in Genesis 22 where he would withhold nothing and stand on God's word. You know that's the ultimate achievement is just God's desire. Listen, every sign and wonder, every event that took place on the platform, every testimony that we have, it's wrote down. It's all for one purpose is to let you know just how much God cares for you. &gt;&gt; God is mindful. And it's to for us that our hearts it would be built. Faith would be built. And that it doesn't come overnight. But it takes God will put things in your life right now. It might be a Genesis 12. It might be a Genesis 13. Might be a Genesis 14 because every one of those were tried. Genesis 14, the king of Sodom came to him and said, "Hey, here let let me give you some riches. Let me let let me ensnare you with Lady Oia. And Abraham said, "You can save it because I didn't go out here to make a name for myself. I didn't go out here for riches. I've not come here for that. Purpose I went is to free my fallen brother." &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; He withtood all the offers that king of Sodom offered him. You know what he offered him? Think about it. Slime pits. You think, "Oo, that's oil." &gt;&gt; Offered him money. That's why the prophet said that there's just as many pineers as there is millionaires. &gt;&gt; You know what a pineier is? It's one that's always chasing money. &gt;&gt; Everything's about money. Life is about money. No wonder the Bible says that the root of all evil is money. &gt;&gt; And yet you have to have it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But I would say Lord, not at any compromise to your word. &gt;&gt; All around this this congregation, we've all and we will be will be tested. A lot of times people like to rehearse that. Brother Bram given the three pitfalls of ministry. That's true. It's true. Those things are very real. But I want you to also understand that those things and even when you look at pitfalls of money and everything else, there's things that's for some people, they'll never'll be never that'll never be something that they have to persevere and overcome behind. But then there'll be other people that'll actually have to say, "That overtime is pulling my strings, man, just to think what I could have." &gt;&gt; And then you realize, you know what? Pretty soon it'll either be on the curb. &gt;&gt; Or it'll be in the junkyard. &gt;&gt; That's why James admonishes us to labor for those things that do not corrupt. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Labor for the meat that does not perish." &gt;&gt; And I I believe it like this. I I believe we can be this honest with God is say, "Lord, help me to have the right balance." &gt;&gt; Help me to have the right balance, Lord. that in everything that you Lord are first. You you might be at that Genesis 14. Maybe you're at Genesis 15, Lord. I don't know how it's going to be. Maybe Genesis 16, maybe there's a maybe there's a a way that's been taken with with, you know, and here's Hagar. But regardless, Abraham through it all, God was working and he brought corrections through it all. But no matter where it is, God is going to deal with each of our lives right where we're at. &gt;&gt; That's right. In other words, God is not going to give you a trial or a test that would be a Genesis 22 back in Genesis 15. &gt;&gt; We're not built to handle it yet. &gt;&gt; God's interested, and it's not that you would fall away from being a son and daughter of God, but God's interested in his word coming forth. He's interested in his word becoming flesh. So God knows just the right, like the prophet calls it in the church age book, the personal temptations that are fitted for this moment. &gt;&gt; But I say, Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord, that in this this moment right here, I can't look ahead to tomorrow, but right in this moment, this season that we're in right now, help me &gt;&gt; Lord, I want the word to be flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, in this season, &gt;&gt; Samuel want the word flesh already before. Yeah, but it's there's got to be more. &gt;&gt; It's more of God taking over more of Samuel. &gt;&gt; It's an accumulating more and more. You know, you get to a place with your wife or your husband, you know them. &gt;&gt; They don't even have to say anything. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's so true. &gt;&gt; You already know their likes or dislikes. You could walk into a house where you are invited and you could already know And you just already know. Hey honey, would you like some salt? You already know. You You already know it's not salted enough. You know them. Some of y'all looking at me like you're giving away secrets. That's how it is with God. &gt;&gt; You get to know him. &gt;&gt; You get to know his ways. And all of that tribulation workketh patience. Patience experience. Experience hope. And hope maketh not ashamed. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for real stability. &gt;&gt; Thank God for confidence. It's not a confidence that's come from man. It's confidence that's come from God. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Father, we just Lord ask that right here tonight Lord just let your your word just be so planted in our hearts. Help us Lord. But I pray no matter where we're at in our journey, no matter where we're at in our walk, Lord, whether it's Genesis 12, 13, 14, 15, all the way up, Lord, to 22. And then even after 22, after such a powerful time on that mountain, Abraham walked off of that mountain and Sarah went on home to be with you. right after a high mountaintop experience sometimes Lord those are the very hardest times of our lives and you know that Lord and we need you. So Father all throughout this congregation may you be Lord the very confidence in each of our hearts. If there's one Lord that hasn't come to that real settleness, Lord, in their heart where the love of God has brought that peace, Lord, that's passing all understanding and that that testimony just bears witness in their life, Lord. There's been a passing from death unto life. Their life has been changed. And the only thing, Lord, that they live for is to please you, to serve you, Lord God. And father, we know that we can't serve you without having a heart to serve one another. So help us, Lord God. I'm standing here, brothers and sisters, pressures all around us. All around us. Lord God, we hear the the the scriptures ringing out right through the headlines. Wars and rumors of wars. Nations positioning themselves. Oh God, things that's being strategically done, help us. Help us to make every moment right now, Lord, count. Cuz we don't know what tomorrow holds. We don't know what the next year holds. But God, right now, living in this moment, Lord, I want to be I want to be closer to you, Lord. I want to be more like you, Lord. I want this word to live in me, Lord. And Father, as you're moving in my heart and in my life, help me. I don't want to live a selfish life. Help me, Lord, to be a support to someone else along the way. Help me to be an encouragement, Lord, to someone else that would encourage them, Lord. Maybe they're going through the hardness of trial. Maybe, Lord, God, discouragement. Maybe it's a young one, Lord, a new one. Help me, Lord. Help me to be an encouragement. Help me to be one, Lord, that would encourage them. Oh, grant it, Lord God. Give us the right words to say, Lord. Give us, Lord, the Father, I pray in everything, Lord, we want, Lord, our desire. I believe there's been an accumulation, Lord, of faith. But Lord God, like even there's more quotes that I have down that I couldn't even get to tonight that your prophet stands right there at the end of super sense preached right after the super sign right after the Holy Ghost series and he says, "Oh God, I want more of that faith. I want more faith in this upcoming year." When the enemy comes and batters in my mind, he said, "Lord, I want that shield of faith that can block every one of those darts that comes. I want more faith, Lord. I must have more faith. &gt;&gt; Find it, Lord. In successive years going on the request. Why? Because every season demands more. But Lord, it's not us supplying it. It's us yielding. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may that be Lord the real the real part in our lives. and realizing Lord, it's not in my trying, it's not in my running, it's not in my struggling, it's in yielding. That reverential obedience, the fear of the Lord to humble ourselves and say, "Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord." Grant it, Lord. I pray, Father. Bless your children tonight, Lord. Dear God, as we go, Lord, would even go here in just a few moments our separate ways. Be with them tomorrow. Give them strength, Lord. May you help us, Lord, in that chapter where we're at, like in Abraham's life. Help us. Help us, Lord, that we might walk with a real godly confidence in you. In you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead. Through it [singing] all, Lord.
