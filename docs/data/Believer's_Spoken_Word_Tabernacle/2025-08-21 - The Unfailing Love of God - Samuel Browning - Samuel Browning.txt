So good to be in the house of the Lord, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Caroline, welcome back. That must mean school. School starting. Amen. Amen. So, we're just so thankful to be in his presence. And Amen. Brian, Sister Bar, welcome back. Different ones. Forgot to welcome brother Aaron back there. Everybody, we've had waves of sickness. And um but God is faithful. &gt;&gt; He's been so good to us. And uh so we are just so thankful for the mercy of the Lord. I I'd like to get right into the word here tonight. And so thank you musicians. Thank you, brother Brian. Amen. Just a little something here on our hearts that we just like to share with you and just trust it'll just be a an encouragement to your hearts. And uh Amen. I believe that's what we come for is that the word would always be an encouragement to us. And may God just direct us and direct the word to our hearts and amen to us according to the needs that we have in him. Amen. So, I want to just uh read here from this portion of scripture and I'm just going to really preach from those three words tonight and just using that for just a a basis of where we'll draw from. I just also want to ask that you would um uh keep my wife and I and I think Zachary is going with us too. We have meetings that's scheduled there in uh um Louisville, just south of Louisville, Kentucky, uh with brother Diego and just a real good brother. And so we have some meetings that are scheduled. There have been scheduled for this weekend. So um we just ask certainly for your prayers. Brother Isaac Hatfield, he'll be here um on Sunday. And uh so we just want to remember that in prayer. And I know the Lord is here with us. Amen. to minister to our needs. And so I certainly just uh just covet your prayers as well. And uh I really mean that, friends. I don't just say that to say that. I really mean that with all my heart. I I have that to me. I you know, I find that to be of great comfort. Like brother Bram says, I can always count on those back home that are praying because it's not just me, but your prayers are are being prayed and and lifted up before God. And God's the one that's directing the word, Amen. to his to his people. And we just want to put our little part together wherever our part is. Amen. We want to put it together for the kingdom of God. And like the prophet said, making that final push. Amen. Because we believe one of just one of these moments, that last one's going to come in. &gt;&gt; God, bring it to where it needs to be. And that's that's it. We go home. So, we're laboring for that. Amen. So, let's read here in the scriptures 1 Corinthians 13:8. Charity never faileth. But whether there be prophecies, they will fail. Whether they be tongues, they shall cease. Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. &gt;&gt; And when I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childish things. Aren't you grateful for the tutorship of the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; Dealing with our lives, working with our lives, teaching us. Amen. Molding us and shaping. Amen. I'm thankful for that. Amen. Because you know what? He's never taken anything from me that uh that wasn't his word. But he's always just made his word more sure, more real, and he just grounds us in him. Amen. It's just a settling in him. For now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abide of faith, hope, charity, these three. But the greatest of these is charity. And I'd like to speak on the unfailing love of God. The unfailing love of God. Let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are so thankful Lord for your grace once again. Lord and dear God as Lord we just to speak and to talk about the love of God where would we ever begin and where does it ever end Lord I'm thankful that love just as we can see it is has no beginning has no ending Lord for love like your prophet said and the scriptures declare love is eternal &gt;&gt; as John would Right. God is love. And Lord, to see that great attribute of love that has been expressed, Lord, you just didn't leave it, Lord, wrapped in words. You just didn't, Lord, leave it, oh God, there, Father, upon the page and what would be expressed and rehearsed, but you manifested your love to us, Lord. You have Lord shown and expressed it. The writers have Lord taken from this Lord of that expression God that even as they walked with you here Lord when you were here in your earthly body that earthly temple that had been purposed and Lord just so prepared Lord to you might come and understand us and you might come and redeem us that you might come and fully dwell in us oh God. Lord, men have tried down through the ages to try to comprehend, tried to even express the love of God. But Lord, it does not lay within our finite power to Lord comprehend. Lord, I'm so glad about that, Lord. I'm so thankful that the love of God, it surpasses, Lord, the the very knowledge, Lord, of man. And it oh God it just Lord passes Lord beyond all reasoning beyond all imagination. And Lord, it's just a reality that Lord anchors within our soul, Lord. That Father, to know that God, you loved us first, Lord. And Father, all that you have done, every every single example through the scripture, Lord, you have given an example of your love and your care and your desire, oh God, to fully bring us back home safely. Lord, as the scripture said, Lord, even in this time, Lord, for then, Lord, we shall see face to face, Lord, to be known, even as we are known. And Lord, we realize that as we're walking in this world, Lord, it's a, as your prophet described it in words that, oh God, it's a a dark and a gloomy world, but faith lightens up the way, Lord, that we can see one step at a time, Lord. Oh God, how we're thankful for the grace of God that shines upon our path, Lord, that we might, Lord, be able to put one foot in front of the other, Lord, and to know that God, one of these days, Lord, we shall rest safely in heaven shore, Lord. Oh, we're longing, Lord God, for we believe that any moment, Lord Jesus, is truly, Lord, the climaxing, oh God, of that coming that is set hold to our hearts, Lord. And we're so thankful, God. So thankful for your mercy. Now, we just ask that you would come, Lord, be the speaker here tonight, Lord. Lord, I pray what, Lord, I could not get away from, Lord, upon my heart, Lord, and you've directed me here, Lord, in just a few moments in the latter part of this evening, Lord. Oh, God, to take me from where we were, Lord, looking at going. You know our needs, Lord. And I pray that God, may the word just reach to every one of our hearts, Lord. And when we would leave from this place, may we be settled, satisfied, and overwhelmed with your love, Lord. Grant it, Lord, I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you as you're being seated. I want to just look here in that word and the word unfailing itself as we look in the scripture that charity never faileth. It's it it's unable. It's not able to fail. And certainly we understand that this charity that's being spoken of that this is more than just human love because human love our our human love at times it can fail because human love itself down here on this level it's everything if if the conditions are just right then you know it it it will it will show itself but that's why we must have the love of God because there's going to be many times and we already see this within our journey as Christians that where conditions themselves are not favorable conditions but if the love of God is there that the love of God does not look at conditions but it's an unconditional love and it's actually that which will come in and move us and pulsate through our lives. It will actually, as the prophet said, it will come and it will override our file love. You see, God when the when the Holy Spirit, the agape love is come in, he sets down right in the middle of our lives and he's to be the very influence in in in our lives and to influence every part of our life to direct us. And that's that's what he wants to do to just influence us. And that's and that's what we want the love of God. And we we need the love of God to influence us because with walking still in these uh bodies of time, we as I said, we can be very limited uh to that of conditions. And that's why that even as we uh stand here tonight, we're gathered here tonight. I'm sure that there could have been many other reasons or there could have been other things that maybe you could have done, but you laid those aside. No matter how pressing it might have been, you laid it aside to be in the house of God. And the prophet, he says it like this in the church and its condition. He says when you do things like that, you lay things aside to be in the house of God. He said that's a sacrifice. And he said with that sacrifice, he said you watch God will come and bless that sacrifice. &gt;&gt; There's times we sacrifice to lay aside that and even in how we might feel. And and I'm not talking about, you know, coming to the house of God if you're not feeling well and you're sick, but I think you understand what I mean that sometimes it would just you, you know, even in our spirit, you get weary or you can get down and you don't you don't necessarily feel like worshiping maybe in the way that you would uh normally worship when it just seems like it's just a time where, you know, nothing has to be done or or even encouraged. you're just I mean you may even have to pull over on the side of the road. You're just you're you're in worship. But then there's those other times that where you don't feel like it, but there's something that moves you beyond just a conditional love. That's the love of God. And where it moves into your heart to say, "Lord, I love you." &gt;&gt; It may not look the same as it would maybe in other times, but your but the love because it's not your love. It's his love. It's be it's it's not my love. It's his love. It's it's it's his love that's come and it's caught a hold in in that part of himself that he deposited in your life and through that it reflects his love right back to him. So we're not loving him with our love. We're loving him with his love. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it's his love that that pushes that moves our love even into action. And I think about it as it's read I believe it's in the per Pamian church age where brother Brandham says notice God commended them for their faith their love. And he says I want you to notice he's not talking about his faith at that time. He's talking about theirs. But how could we you or me or even that in the per Pamian age ever have faith that is commendable? love that is commendable or even to be called the faithful. How could that be made possible without the faithful God? &gt;&gt; It's impossible without God. And that's why I think we can take such a consolation in the scriptures. If God be for us, &gt;&gt; who can be against us? Because it's the faithful God. He he never gave up when when when situations look so bleak. I think how the prophet says it in the masterpiece. I love how he says he says when the fall had taken place and situations had the report had come back he said did God just leave the masterpiece fallen face down he said no he came down and he began to by his word declare I will make a way back and he be to work he's a faithful through all all the obstacles through through every situation that even when they could say well Look, look at the end of Noah. But God wasn't God knew all of that. But it wasn't about the end of Noah. God achieved through Noah what God desired to achieve. &gt;&gt; And Noah was declared righteous. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? It's the same way when it came that it came through Abraham. It came then through Isaac. It came through Jacob. It came through Joseph. The righteousness of God prevailed through their and over their humanity to what God desired to achieve. He achieved it. &gt;&gt; So when we look at this unfailing of the love of God, the word unfailing means without error or fault, reliable, constant. I want to just say this, you know, at the crossing from time to eternity because these these scriptures that I read, pardon me, I I want to just refer back to this this opening scripture that we read, Paul when he's saying charity never faileth. And he speaks of how prophecies they shall fail. In other words, he's not look he's not looking down upon prophecy. He's not looking down upon tongues. That's not the whole that's not the context. What Paul is saying is these are a part of the journey. God knew that you and I would would have needs in our life. God knew at times like the prophet said that there would be things that would not be wrote in here. Questions we would have in life, maybe even decisions that were to make with. And the prophet said God provided gifts that he has placed within the body to help you and I even in those kind of times. God knew we would need all of this during the journey of time. But after after that that passage of time is over and then we have crossed that dividing line of time and eternity and we stand there on the other side. I'll never preach another sermon. There'll never be another another gift that's been used. But all of that has been endowments that God has given for you and I in this journey. &gt;&gt; And I want to say what Paul is saying is that every one of those things are are are a part of the journey that God has given. Well, you know, brother Samuel, the the enemy's taken them like this. Enemy's taken like that. That's true. But I'm not focused on what the enemy has done. If we're standing on the word of God, it's the love. Listen, it was not man who gave the gifts. It is God who gave the gifts. They're love gifts. The prophet called them. He said they were gifts of engagement that God gave. And God gave those. And he says as the bride of Christ, we declare that we are his bride because we receive that engagement ring which is that of God's the gifts coming into the body. And we receive that. There's not one gift that that the bride of Jesus Christ. I'm talking about the true bride. We're not. You don't go beyond. Well, we're beyond the gifts. No, we all the way through &gt;&gt; until these mortal bodies are changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God said it in the church and no one can take it out. &gt;&gt; Love never fails. It will direct. It's the oversight. So you know this journey of time but love love love itself I want you to think of this because love itself when this journey of time is over love itself that we've received in our hearts that has drawn us and brought us to where we are has been with us through every test through every trial. That's true. &gt;&gt; Has ministered to us at every moment that we've been down. &gt;&gt; We've been discouraged. &gt;&gt; Has anointed others to reach out to us. All of that at when we cross from this time veil of time into eternity. We cross right into the very atmosphere of the love of God that's in our soul. &gt;&gt; The prophet said perfect love. That's he said there's no there's no other way he said it like this in the sixth seal than to describe it other than you've just arrived. And I want to say this to you, you and I. God is working on our life and he's bringing us to a place that is certain. And he's doing that by his word. He's building us up. He's molding us. He's there's a maturing that's going on in our life. And you know when we stand there on that day, it will be declared, "You have arrived." He's working here in time. He's molding us. He's shaping us through all the hardships, the tests, the trials, through everything that comes our way. God is working all of this out because at the end of the day, it's character that is taken in rapture. And that character is gold. No wonder David said that that precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. It doesn't seem in our mind because we miss our loved ones. We miss those that's gone on. &gt;&gt; But you see, when we when God when we look at it from God's eyes, it doesn't take away our sorrow. And there's truly a comfort when we know where one h has gone and entered in. It's a comfort, but it doesn't take away the sorrow. Paul said, "We sorrow not as others." He didn't say, "We didn't sorrow." But God when that scripture said precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. That very scripture means it's that which is harvesting out of the earth a precious mineral. And God himself has allowed the gold of his own life of deity and his life coming in and molding you and I and shaping you and I. And then when it comes to the end, whether you and I go by the way of the grave or in the rapture, it will be the very harvesting &gt;&gt; of character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the only thing, and I'll just say it like this, the only thing even we can say now is what we will say then, Lord, &gt;&gt; it's because of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love that song. Because of who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I give you glory. &gt;&gt; Because of him. &gt;&gt; Because of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my, look at this. When brother Brandham, he would say it like this on the unfailing of of of the love of God. And he says, "Though though I speak with tongue of men and angels and have not love, it profit me nothing. Though I give all my goods to feed the poor, it profit me nothing. Though I have power to move mountains and so forth, it profit me nothing. Where there is prophecies, it'll fail. And where there's tongues, it'll cease. Where there's knowledge, it'll vanish away. But when perfect love has come into the human heart, all demons in hell will never be able to upset it. I want you to be I want you to lock in on this right here. He didn't say, remember when Jesus said, "Upon this rock, I will build my church." And that rock is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally. &gt;&gt; That's that he did it for you. you were included in him and that his grace is sufficient and what he started in your life, he will see it all the way through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. Let me tell you, it's not the let me say it like this. It's not the revelation of put your name there. That's not what the new birth is there. It's the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally. It's not about It's not about you. It's about what he has done for you and you are included in him. You are identified in his sacrifice in his suffering and by the Holy Spirit drawing upon your life you have made a choice under the influence of the Holy Spirit to say I want to be identified with Jesus Christ. What caused that to rise in your heart? It is the revelation of Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit the love of God reaching out to your heart that would cause you to rise and say I want to be identified with him. Why? because you were identified with him before the foundation of the world. Where were you at Job? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation of Jesus Christ. It's God unfolding himself. &gt;&gt; What an anchor. It didn't say, Lotus, all demons in hell will never be able to upset it. It didn't say at times you may not be upset. It didn't say at times that you may not be frustrated. &gt;&gt; It didn't say at times that you may not be weary. &gt;&gt; It didn't say that. What what cannot be upset? The love of God. &gt;&gt; That's why it's important the love of God in your heart because because the love of God in your heart, the Bible said perfect love casteth out fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, the perfect love of God. And sometimes you might get out of tune. I can get out of tune. Come on. We We've all been there. been get out of tune. But the Holy Spirit comes right back in and he knows his instruments. He knows his symphony. He knows the strings, the predestinated strings of our lives. And he can come right back in and begin to bring it in synchronization with his word. And what does it do? It brings it right back to the melody that I'm the Lord that health all thine diseases. I'm the Lord that forgiveth all thine iniquities. I'm the Lord that has watched over all your life. It brings it right back in sync with his word. And that's his word that you're standing on. His word cannot fail because he can't fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter. So you might as well just just tell the devil to get out of here on my shoulder trying to accuse me for when I've got frustrated or I got down or you know. But you see what's happened. And the love of God draws you back to the sacrifice where you can say, "Lord, you are my propituation. Forgive me for entertaining that thought. Forgive me for getting down. Forgive me for getting frustrated. Forgive me, Lord, for doubt entering in." What is that? It's the love of God that draws you back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No wonder Paul could write, "I am crucified with Christ." Right. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. Paul, how how are you getting up every day? &gt;&gt; By this? &gt;&gt; How are you dying daily by this? Here's the Paul could say, "This is the secret &gt;&gt; of my life." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He goes on, I do not frustrate. I'm not I'm not trying to debate with the grace of God. I'm not I'm not in any argument with God's grace. For if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. He died in vain. But he did not die in vain. &gt;&gt; It's what is it doing? It's resting in that finished work of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not my feelings, but I'm resting in what he that begun this good work in me &gt;&gt; shall perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. Where is it? I've got a destination. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've got a destiny. That destiny is perfect love. That destiny is the rapture. That destiny is the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just tell you, wherever you're at right now, it might be a tester, might be a trial, wherever it's at, do not tell anybody that that is your current address because your mail is not to be a forwarded to the trial that you're going through or the tribulation that you're in. That's not your destiny. &gt;&gt; Your destiny, Zion, is the rapture. &gt;&gt; You're passing through the valley of Baka. But Baka is not your new address. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your address is in Christ and it's never changed. No matter the conditions, no matter the feelings, no matter the circumstance, the address remains the same in Christ. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul could write. You talk. I want you to watch this. Paul could say this word yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are shaken as things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. This kingdom is his word made power. And I love the the very phrase cannot be moved means it cannot be shaken. It's unmoved. It's not liable to overthrow and disorder. It's firm and stable. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see this is why that God's desire that the word, the love of God that it comes in to the human heart. It comes into our lives in the depth of our soul and it raises up a son and daughter of God because there the love of God, it abides. It remains. It's constant. It doesn't matter what can come around in your spirit realm. It doesn't matter what can come around in your flesh. That word cannot be overthrown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not liable to overthrow. Oh well, you know, well, Polycarp went to the state, but it wasn't overthrown. Who was not overthrown? The word was not overthrown. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many that stood there, teenagers all all the way through, I think perpeta, different ones that wrote in the Fox's book of martyrs. young people that stood there, men and women down through the ages. Let me just say this. I'm talking about you who stand day in and day out. &gt;&gt; You and I will run to them in that day and say, "Oh my Polycarp, I can't wait to meet Polycar. I can't wait to meet them all." But to stand there and say, "Oh my, thank you, brother. Thank you for the encouragement that you gave me down in this age." And it just it it it blows your mind to think that the prophet said that they will come to you and want to know how did you make it through because this is the most deceptive age. But if it's the most deceptive age, then God himself was responsible for given such clarity, such certainty that would bring such stability of something that would anchor you and I and hold us &gt;&gt; through all sorts of deception, through every trial, through every tribulation. &gt;&gt; And I want to say, he's been faithful. &gt;&gt; He's been faithful. God promised he would send this message and he did. The angel of the Lord accompanies this message. Hallelujah. God is faithful. God has come to make this word live in our lives. I want to say God is faithful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is faithful. When we didn't know many different times, how is this going to come out? How is this situation going to come out? But God's word is faithful because God is faithful. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just read a few scriptures. Matthew 5:18. Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tit, even even an accent mark shall in no wise pass from the law, &gt;&gt; till all be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; You think God isn't concerned about every &gt;&gt; little part of our life? He's not just looking at big parts. You and I sometimes we look at just big parts. Sometimes when things we're overwhelmed by something that's a big part to us and then other things in our life that maybe we don't feel so overwhelmed and maybe we're not as fervent as we are in other times. But God, even through the midst of that, God himself will not allow one jot or one title &gt;&gt; to fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know how it is for you and I sometimes you're doing a job painting or whatever more. Y'all know what I'm talking about. We've got some parts even in this building where it's just like we've got enough. We've done we've done enough. Just that's all right. That piece ain't there. It's all right. It's okay. I mean, it's I'm done, man. I mean, it's enough, right? It's like sometimes people putting in carpet, you know, maybe they're doing on themselves and finally they get back there and they're like, "Nope, not in that. I don't feel like stretching no more in that corner. Let's just let's just put the subwoofer over that part right there." Not God. Not God. God don't do that with his word. He don't do that with our lives. He don't get to a spot and say, "Look, I I've been trying to stretch. I've been trying to minister to this in your life. I've been trying." No. God will continue to work. You know why? He cannot give up because he cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even when you and I can look at and say, "Lord, I I don't see how this could be. I've tried this or I've tried that." But you know what? God himself, he's bringing us to a place, you know, the whole thing is is for you and I to rest and allow him to do what only he can do and what he will do. Because remember, he doesn't want our signature mixed up with him. He wants his signature to be over everything in our lives, &gt;&gt; you know, cuz like some people have like woodworking and other things like that and they want to know, well, who made it and who who made this and who made that? What furniture place made this? Let me tell you something. And God himself has his signature all over our lives. &gt;&gt; Matthew 24:35, "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "It's easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tit of the law to fail." &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but when I was, you know, when I was teaching school and things, I think about that tit right now. I think about how many times I'd have different ones come to me and man I I was just I think I think I I think phonics for me I think I was taught to just memorize. I don't know that for sure but I kind of think that way because I have to kind of the way I have to kind of go through words and things like that and I can butcher them. But you know so I'd have kids names and I I would look at their names and I would think well you know uh you know trying to pronounce their names and you know some would have that little hyphenation that little accent mark. Hey, they wanted me to know that accent mark meant to do something, &gt;&gt; right? So they wanted me to know that. So I would many times I would have to write it out and I would just write out above their name how how it sounded to me. So when I would see the name I I would read it in that way. I'm saying it this way that God just does not and he will not bypass one little part of his word. He's not one that just gives up. He's not one that throws in the towel. He's there for the long haul to bring us home safely. &gt;&gt; This is why brother Brown would say it like this. Just listen. He said, "If God has said anything, it's the most solid foundation we can rest on." Faith can rest on no other. Faith cannot find its resting place upon the shifting sands of people's ideas. But it takes its everlasting stand upon the immovable rock of God's eternal word. We can rest on it if God said so. That should settle it. Oh my. He says, but there's nothing, he says, that can be any more up to-date than what God has said. He said, you know, I feel like, he said, I feel like, you know, that brother there in the south where they said, Moses, why do you pack that Bible? Now, remember, brother Ramry tells a story and Moses Moes couldn't read the Bible, but he packed the Bible. And he said, why do you pack it? You can't even read a word on it. Why do you carry that Bible under your arm? And the expression from the old man was, "I carry it, boss, because I believe it. And I believe it so much that I believe it from kiver to kiver, and the kiver also, for on the kiver, it's written, holy bible. I'd rather be standing on this Bible in the hour of my death than to be standing in heaven." &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "That's quite a statement, Mo, for you to make." He said, "The reason I say it, boss, is because it's more sure to stand than heaven is. For the Bible said, "Heavens and earth will pass away, but my word shall never fail." Oh, brother Ram said, "I think we all feel like that." Let God's word, way he wrote it. No private interpretation, just speak for itself when no one's polluted it. Read it, believe it. It may seem strange, some of its quotations, but sometimes works in mysterious ways, his wonders to perform. We must believe it. Let me just tell you what to do. Quit filtering the word and receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't filter it. Even listen, I know it has to come in our mind. But don't try to filter it out as far as does it make sense? Does this apply to you? Just say, Lord, this part that of the word, you are the word. I'm a part of the word, and I am going to accept what you have already said about me. I'm not going to filter it out. I'm not going to filter it through my own failures. I'm not going to filter it through my own humanity. I'm not going to filter it because I want it pure. So, I'm going to accept the pure word of God and let the pure word of God produce pure faith, &gt;&gt; pure love, pure change, pure righteousness, &gt;&gt; it's stronger. It's stronger than the world. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh my," think of this. The Bible said, "For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man is the flower of grass. The grass witherth, and the flower thereof fadeth away, but the word of the Lord endureth &gt;&gt; forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is the word by which the gospel is preached unto you. Look at the scripture here. Isaiah 55. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not hither, but waterth the earth, and maketh it, and bring it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sewer, and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not &gt;&gt; return unto me void, &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing where unento I sent it. You know what I'm thankful for when he sent his word. Listen, it wasn't me or you per se that actually received it. It's that part of God on the inside that is actually who you and I really are. It's the part that actually the word came and it's that it be to draw upon that part in our life and it's captured right there. And you know even as the word is working in our life. Oh like Abraham the prophet tells us that Abraham had misunderstandings of the promise. You remember the different things in Abraham's life. But did Abraham's misunderstandings or did he allow his misunderstandings to keep him back from the promise of God? Not at all. Why? There was the purpose of God that was working in his life and could not be defeated. It'd be like you and I. Here we are. We're trying to draw something or maybe you're trying to do something, lay bricks on top of one another. And you have a brickmason out there who's who's very wellkilled within it. And here he knows how to put that mortar on. And I watched those guys out there one day at the brick layer inside of there out there in South Amherst. And man, them guys are just moving with their hands and putting that stuff down there just like that. And you know what? If you or I were doing it and picking it up, you know, the boys tried to do it. This was years ago trying to do it and look at all those things. And you know those guys say, "Uh-uh." And no, put put it like this. And so they kept working with them and trying to, you know, help them to do it. I'm glad that God when God looks in you and I and goes, "Uh-uh. It ain't uh-uh that you're not a son. Uh-uh that you're not a daughter. It's uh-uh that that's not how my word is to come forth in that of your life. Here, let me show you again. He's faithful. He's a hands-on teacher. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has given. He made a way. He provided so you and I would not be left to our own demise or our own wonderings. He said, "If I go away, I will I will give you another comforter." And that another comforter is himself in the form of the Holy Ghost, the fulfillment of his word that you and I can rest in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory. It'll not return unto me void. So, let me just read you a few of these. I'd rather be statements. The prophet saying, "I'd rather have favor with God and be called a holy roller fanatic, whatever they want to call me, and have favor with God to know that he's standing here this afternoon than all the wealth Chicago's got or all the glory the world has got." Listen this one. I'd rather be standing right here now holding this picture with the pillar fire telling you what that is and know that he's standing right here within 5t of where I'm standing right now. I'd rather have this feeling and consolation that I have right now than to be the king over all the earth for a million years. &gt;&gt; He said, I'd rather another place. He said, I'd rather be standing right here with the love of God in my heart, trying to tell others about it than anything I know in the world. I have a peace that nothing else could put there &gt;&gt; like Jesus Christ has. Romans 5 verse one. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God &gt;&gt; through our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the Lord Jesus will never come and trouble his peace that he's given to you. &gt;&gt; His peace is his word. His peace is who he is. It's an attribute of who he is. But it's always Satan's business to want to try to get us in turmoil, &gt;&gt; wondering, pressures, situations that can come. But I want you to remember this is a peace that Jesus said the world never gave you. &gt;&gt; Cuz he said, "My peace." You see what he's saying? I leave with you. what what I have what has held me what has been present through my journey &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave it with you how could he leave his peace it was his life &gt;&gt; that would be deposited that through the midst of all the situations of life there is a peace that Paul would write of by experience and say it's a peace that passes all understanding It's a peace that doesn't even make sense. It's a peace that dwells right in the midst of your life. And let me just tell you this, don't even try to make sense of it. &gt;&gt; Just rest in it. &gt;&gt; Because you cannot, nor can I with our finite mind explain it or ever pin it down. Cuz if you could do that, you could pin God down. &gt;&gt; You could explain God. But God is not explainable. He's not even meant to be explainable. He's meant to be believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The greatest compliment the prophet said that we could ever do, the greatest, how how many say, "Lord, I want to give you the greatest compliment." The prophet said, "The greatest thing we could ever do," he said, "is to believe what he said." &gt;&gt; That's the greatest thing that we can do. You know, when you take the word into your life, every one of us here at different times, you've been sick in your body. Maybe you had to go take an antibiotic. And that antibiotic would have so much of a poison within it and so much also of within the antidote that it would actually go to work. A certain part would actually go to start working and killing those other germs. And then the other part would actually go to start mending some of the tissue and things and whatever that's broke down. I want you to think about this that the word of God is so powerful when you take God's word into your life and you just receive it. You don't you don't take an antibiotic. Now, I know some people read on the on the on the prescription bottle and they'll read uh may cause drowsiness and they're they're thinking they need to take a nap and you say, "Wait a minute. You ain't even taken it yet." I mean, they're already got, you know, the couch lined up. But you notice when you go to you you just you take that medicine, whether you get it from Myers, Walgreens, wherever you know, you're waiting on it and they finally say, "Hey, we got your medicine ready for pickup." You go get it and you say, "Okay, take with food or take with a glass of milk or take with this." You go get it and you begin to take it down. You do not worry about where that medicine is going to go. You You've got confidence that the doctor has been able to determine, oh, you have an upper respiratory. No, Zpack's not going to work here, but this is what's going to work. Oh, you got a sulfa allergy. Okay, this is what's going to take place. You've got a confidence in the doctor in whom you've told your symptoms that he has wrote the prescription. And by the way, he's practicing medicine. But our God is not practicing. Our God is faithful. He every word that he has prescribed, he's never changed the prescription. If you'll just take that word in and look at what the word, the writing upon the bottle said it would do, it will fulfill it in your life. Just take it as he said take it and say, "I believe it, Lord. I accept that, Lord." And watch the medicine go to work in your life. &gt;&gt; Why? cuz it cannot return back to him void. &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory be to God. Hallelujah. I don't think I read verse two yet. By whom also we have access. Thank you, Lord. By faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of the Lord. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation workketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed. My expectation when someone gives a testimony, I believe that the Lord has healed me. &gt;&gt; Right? Maybe they maybe the way that they have to go through something, maybe it's a surgery, it's still God's healing. &gt;&gt; If they even if they here, they can testify it's in their hearts that you know what, God has healed me. The Lord's my healer. And they're standing up on that. Maybe they go by the way of the grave. But listen, their expectation is not ashamed. If they can if they would be clear at the very last moments of their life, there was be no recanting. there would be no remorse. It would be that same testimony because whether healing is in this side or healing on the next side, the grace of God that has been provided for you and I to move from this realm into that realm, God's grace is sufficient. And the love of God that came and brought us and drew us unto him, he said like David, the yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. And the prophet said, "The only way there could be a shadow is because there's a light that has come into that valley." Our lives were filled with darkness. But God, rich in mercy, stepped down in our valley, and he is leading us out of that valley. The same way he leads a soul across to the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's faithful. &gt;&gt; Hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts. It just it's ever expanding. It's ever expanding. You say, "Brother Samuel, how does the love of God expand in our hearts?" Right here. Through tribulations. &gt;&gt; Through tribulations, the love of God, it expands, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It becomes greater. &gt;&gt; It becomes more sure. Look, there's things right now that you have that God has brought you through even in the past month, &gt;&gt; the past year that you knew would have never even thought about, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But God has brought you through. I want to ask you, what brought you through? What brought you through? What brought me through when we would feel like throwing up our hands? What is it &gt;&gt; that would bring us through? What is it that would direct us and turn us back around? I'll tell you what it is. It's a love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a love of God. You can't get away from the love of God. &gt;&gt; The love of God is shed abroad in your hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. Here it is. Second Thessalonians chapter 3. We have confidence in the Lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which which we command you. And the Lord, sorry, direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ. I love that. &gt;&gt; Who's going to direct my heart? When when my heart, like David said, is overwhelmed, what did he say? Lead me to the rock &gt;&gt; that is higher than high. &gt;&gt; Lord, direct my heart. &gt;&gt; Direct my heart, Lord. I want to just say that even tonight. Lord, direct my heart. Lord, &gt;&gt; direct my heart into what? Into the love of God, bring moving deeper there into the love of God. when situations arise. I I don't know about you, but as I look at this scripture and ponder on it, all I can think of is is is a ship or something that would be so tattered and oh, in the midst of the storm. But to know that there's a place, a safety, a safe harbor, there's a refuge, there's a place that God in his grace can direct us into. I like how the songwriter says it. He said, "Sometimes the times he calms the storm and other times he just calms me." &gt;&gt; The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ. &gt;&gt; It might be a doctor's report. It might be a job. It might be a situation. And the God in his grace will direct your heart right into the love of God and the patient waiting. Lord, as David said, and I'm a testament, I've never seen the righteous, forsaken. &gt;&gt; Never seen one of his children, the righteous, ever begging for bread. &gt;&gt; I've never seen that. You say, "Brother Sam, why why would you quote that?" Cuz those are my promises. Those are your promises. This is God's word. Listen, God knew that you and I would have need of this even in the time that we're living. And God has made this word so real and so sure to where you and I, we're not just New Testament Christians. We are Biblebelieving Christians all the way from the Old to the New. Cuz we realize that Jesus of the New is Jehovah of the Old. And to know that he's the same almighty God that condescended, came down, became one of us, and is now dwelling in us and leading us and guiding us. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for that? Oh God, I wonder how many times even as a family we could even get around your children, different ones, somebody going through something, just just take them by the hand and say, "Let's let's just let's just go to God. Let's just go to the Lord in prayer." Why? He's our strong and mighty tower. He's our place of refuge. He's a place that I can let off the pressure. He's a poised one that is right there. He's not a long distance call. He said, "I'd be right there with you." He said, "Ask the Father anything in my name and I will do it." He's right there. He said, "I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age. Though I may not feel it, he's faithful to his word. And his word is greater than my feelings &gt;&gt; or the circumstance I might find myself in." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. as Abraham's seed. Think of it in Hebrews 6:13. For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swear by himself, saying, "Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee." And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. &gt;&gt; Abraham had to press beyond his own thoughts. Amen. &gt;&gt; God gave him strength to press through all the unbelief. God gave him strength to where he could look in the mirror and his his back was more crooked the next day than it was the day before. But God gave him grace to look beyond what he was seeing in the mirror and to take what God had already said about him. Come on, Abraham seed. You need to look beyond just what you in your thoughts and oh this is how I am. You don't understand. No, God understands. And God don't waste words, friends. What God has said concerning you, that's what he means. He is the amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said that, oh, what a blessing it is for those who will bless themselves in the God of truth. To bless yourself in the God of the amen. How do I bless myself in the God of the amen? By accepting what he said with an amen. So be it. Regardless of my feelings, regardless of my thought, I'm blessing myself in the God of the Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory be to God in the highest. For men verilely swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife, wherein God willingly, more abundantly to show unto the heirs. Aren't you glad for that? The heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath. No. So he already gave his word, but now he steps to make an oath regarding his word. He's making it double sure. &gt;&gt; Double sure. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the day of the double portion. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the day where Job had restored devil unto him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. We're We're living in that day of the devil where God that has spoke his word fulfilling that word. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; I just want to say thank you Lord. Thank you, Lord, that by two immunable things in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, a great comfort, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. Which hope, which expectation we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enterth into that within the veil. Brother Samuel, I I don't see it all yet, but you've already there's an anchor that's already entered into the veil. You are already connected in the veil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The coming of the Holy Spirit is the abstract to the title D. What does the Holy Spirit do to you? It brings you back into heavenly places, your rightful position in Jesus Christ. And it's like that little person had that that that remember that kite brother Ram talks about cloudy day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How many ever had them cloudy days? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cloudy days. Here she was. She just had that little that little cow. Little kite here. A man came by there and looked at it. So what what you got on the other end of that stream? She said a kite. He don't see it. She said that's what I got. Well, I don't see it. Oh. She said it's up there. She said, "Because every once in a while, I feel a little tug." &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you feel that tug, &gt;&gt; brother? That tug that came around and begin to tug on your life. It didn't leave you a Catholic. It didn't leave you a Baptist. It didn't leave you a Pentecostal. It didn't just leave you around a message in a church. It's pulling you. What is it? It is that perfection that is calling you back to perfection. It's God, his word that he's making known that he's bringing you back to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And through that, &gt;&gt; he's bringing you back to yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's breaking amnesia around your life and my life. &gt;&gt; Even in situations, maybe maybe there's a spiral that comes up in your life. But God's grace is sufficient. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; To break the amnesia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He did it. He did it before and he brought you to where you are now. He's the same God that no matter the situation that can bring you right back to who he's revealed you really are. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whether the forerunner is for us entered sure and steadfast within the veil, even Jesus made an high priest after the order of Melzdc. I want to just say it like this. The Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter 1 that he in verse three if you don't mind let me just go to there. It said who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power. And when he had by himself purged our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. It's finished. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, no matter what situation came, even down through the Old Testament, even when the fall came in the garden, it could not stop the word. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, every situation where the enemy has wanted to ensnare God's children and put a trap and say, "I got them here. I got them here." God himself has moved down within those times to reveal another one of his great compound redemptive names. He has made himself known that I'm your peace. That I'm your banner. I'm your shepherd. I'm your healer. I'm your righteousness. He has moved down time and time again. So God does not run when adversity comes to your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Boy, if I could run right now, I would. He don't run when adversity comes to your life. As a matter of fact, he will hold the angels back and say, "I'm going down myself." He came down in the fiery furnace. Wormwood wanted to flood it out. He said, "No, &gt;&gt; I've got an appointment in the midst of this trial, in the midst of this time. I've got an appointment in the midst of Lady Oia with my bride where there's all sorts of things wanting to bind her hands and tie her up and lay her down. But I've got an appointment to walk in the midst of the fire. [Applause] They didn't know about the appointment, but I knew about the appointment &gt;&gt; and allowed them to declare their faithfulness in the midst and stand there and say, "I don't know what's going to take place, but I know one thing. We're not bowing, and our God will deliver us out of your hand." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; However he chooses, but he's still the deliverer. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Incredible how those who threw them in burned up. And yet God allowed the king to be able to look in and say, "Wait a minute. How many did you throw in? We only threw in three, but I see four down there. And that one is like unto the son of man." The son of God walking in the midst of the flame of fire. See, God allowed the testimony of that king to witness who was in the midst of that situation. You think your testimony and your life that's being lived on a daily basis when at times you maybe don't feel so spiritual. You don't feel so up in the air. But let me tell you something. There is in the middle of this watch, in the middle of the timing of your life is a mainspring that keeps time. And it's your life that's ticking out that's causing others to look and say there's something on the inside that's greater than them. It's something that's keeping time and rhythm with the word. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; No wonder David would say, "Uphold me, Lord, &gt;&gt; unto thy word that I may live. Hold me according to thy word." Sorry. "Uphold me according to thy word that I may live. And let me not be ashamed of my hope. Hold thou me up and I shall be saved. I will have respect unto thy statutes continually. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, get ready. Hebrews 10 verse 12. I want you to I want you to watch this. I'm going to have him play just about nine minutes of a tape. I I I could have read it, but it better. I just want Brother Ram to say it. I want you He's gonna put it up here, but I want you to follow along with it. Just let me read this and then I'm going to have brother Brian play. Just nine minutes. But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever &gt;&gt; sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foottool. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram's going to come on here. Go ahead and get it up, Brother Brian. He's going to come right on here within this and say he's waiting for you at the end. He sent the Holy Ghost to bring you all the way through this journey. Everybody see that? Okay, we tried to make it as big as we could. I'll get my head out of the way. Would it help if I turn this off these lights? Would that help y'all? You say, "I don't know." Does that help? &gt;&gt; Really realize what you're doing. May God be merciful to me. The blood of Jesus is on your hands. Don't you go out and start living the same life that you did. That blood will condemn you at the end of the judgment. &gt;&gt; You better have the life that's in that blood to return to your life's blood. Return to your heart and make you live a different Christ, a different person. &gt;&gt; The worshipper once purged. Watch here. But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sin for how long? &gt;&gt; Ever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That shameless eternity. Forever sat down at the right hand of God at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where's he at? At the end of the road. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; You remember Sunday before last? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the Sunday I preached and illustrated the little ark of Moses that was going down to the bull rushes and everything. You remember how the you old people got the crying and shouting when I was preaching to the children had all them little black and blue eyes sitting up here on the front row. Tell them if you lose your life you'll find it. If you keep your life you'll lose it. You remember that church? &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember when I was in illustration gave the illustration of that morning when Jehawk and when Amra Aaron and Miam all down before daylight with their hands up in the air saying God you gave us the baby. Now we're giving it back to you. You give it to us. It wasn't ours. It was yours. You give it to us and now we give it back to you. We keep it. The witches of hell will kill it. Them old long hooked old women come out there, take her little head and bust it against the wall, we'll lose it if we keep it. But if we give it back to the one who gave it to us, &gt;&gt; we'll keep it. &gt;&gt; That's the same thing in your little bark this morning, brother, sister. You've got a cargo in there, the precious cargo of the world. &gt;&gt; It's called your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, keep it. Live the way you want to. You'll lose it as certain as I'm standing here. &gt;&gt; And if you give it back to God and surrender your will, you'll keep it. &gt;&gt; You'll find it. Jesus said so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember, and when they pushed this the treasure of their heart, when they pushed it out into the river, oh crocodiles coming up, I could see God, I said, raised from his throne. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a lot of trials goes on down here. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's somebody looking at him all the time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They love not their life unto death. &gt;&gt; One poor Abraham with his only beloved little child, little chihahaki pet just nursed it to her bosom and then had to put in the ark and push it out into the bull rushes where the alligators were packed. All little babies there when she was standing there in the tears running laying down her cheeks. God said, "Come here, Gabriel. Come here. Want to show you something. I got somebody that really believes me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, let me be that type of person that can say God said so. It's right &gt;&gt; and be so dead to anything else. Comes a pound and brass or tingling. &gt;&gt; Come here, Dave. All you angels come out here. &gt;&gt; I want to show you something. See that man down there, his hands up, pushed his own baby out. &gt;&gt; I gave it to him. has given it back. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I see that he keeps it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Gabriel called 10,000 angels on marching orders. &gt;&gt; I want them out here. Gabriel sounded a little trumpet across the quarters of eternity. 10,000 armed angels walked down say yourself up and down the river. See, there's no alligator. Nothing else going to touch one of that. It was give back to me. &gt;&gt; Gabriel said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; glory, &gt;&gt; chief captain, where are you going to be?" I'm going to be at the end of the line. &gt;&gt; I'm going to receive down there. That's the same thing he does today. When a man puts his trust in the Lord, Jesus, confesses his sins, the Holy Ghost takes a hold of that man and Christ stands at the receiving end. So through many world pools and alligators and scary spooks and everything else we come through through many dangers I have already come. &gt;&gt; It's grace that's brought me safe thus far. It's grace that'll take me all. &gt;&gt; Who's at the receiving end? Listen. forever sat down at the right hand of God from henceforth up down at the end of the road expecting till his enemies be made his foottool. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here it is. Here's the last turn on the bolt. &gt;&gt; Here's the last spot with the torch. Here's the last drive of the nail. &gt;&gt; This is the one who clinches eternity to eternity. And in there, the sword of God's deliverance went through the heart and hanging up his delegation &gt;&gt; to the Holy Spirit. Here it is. Hebrews 10:14. Listen. Not my word, but God's word who spoke it before the foundation of the world. It has to be so. &gt;&gt; For by one offering, he has ped. Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfected forever them that are sanctified. &gt;&gt; Look at it. Look at it. &gt;&gt; Perfected. How long? &gt;&gt; Till the next time you get on a &gt;&gt; with your neighbor. Till the next time you see somebody, some man or woman are lustful. Until the next time you see a chance to tell a big lie. until the next time you see where you can net someone and hurt them and drive them away from church. So sometime you can criticize somebody. He has sanctified forever forever for the Holy Ghost. You might say something sometimes wrong. That's right. You might do something sometimes wrong. That's right. But as soon as you do it, watch the next verse. &gt;&gt; What the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my I just can't preach anymore. &gt;&gt; Look, the Holy Ghost is a witness to us. [Music] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a witness. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. to us after that he has said before this is the covenant what I will make with them in those days sayith the Lord I'll put my law in their heart and in their minds will I write them and their sins and their iniquity will I remember no more praise God &gt;&gt; oh God &gt;&gt; every man that has this hope purifies himself God is puremen Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Our heavenly father, &gt;&gt; we thank thee this morning for the purging of the Holy Ghost, for the grace of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were sinners, unrighteous, ungodly, unlovable. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Without God, without hope, alienated in the world. And Christ come and tuck our place by fornowledge. God saw us in this condition knowing that we were hungering and thirsting. No wonder Jesus said they shall be filled not become members. Not they shall join but they shall be filled. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hungering and thirsting for our righteousness. In other words, hungering and thirsting knowing that we can do nothing in ourselves no matter what we do. The devil could make us impersonate every gift. Could make us go out and lay hands on the sick and they had recovered. Could make us speak with tongues. Could make us interpret tongues. To make us have wisdom, knowledge. But that doesn't take it. Lord, you said many will come in that day and say, "Lord, Lord, have not I done these things in your name?" He said, "Depart from me, you workers of iniquity. I never even knew you, oh God. Then let our hopes be built on nothing less than Jesus blood with righteousness. &gt;&gt; For all around our soul gives way and he's all our hope and stay. For on Christ the solid rock I stand. All other grounds is sinking sand. &gt;&gt; To know him is life. &gt;&gt; Yes Jesus. &gt;&gt; Not to know the orders. Amen. &gt;&gt; To know him the person. I pray father for every sinner in the building today that you'll save them just now and may they without any emotion without any contradictions from the devil but may they with a true unadulterated faith believe what they've heard preached and accept &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit who brought it &gt;&gt; grant it Lord or in his name we asked him. &gt;&gt; And with our heads bowed, &gt;&gt; I wonder if there's someone here this morning now. I want your level, honest, truthful. No matter what you've done, no matter how many starts you've made or how long you've gone to church, are you sincere from the depths of your heart of this that knows that the things of the world has passed from you to know that day after day and year after year, it continues on. your anchor holes. May somebody honor foreshadowed at the end of the road where this great kink will be drawn out. There's somebody there tugging at your heart knowing that someday you'll be lifted up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If that's not gone from your heart today, friend, it &gt;&gt; fellow citizens, pilgrim. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. so much in it. I don't worry, I'll send you all the audio clip of it, but &gt;&gt; one part of it that just all of it stood out. But he's he's waiting at the end. &gt;&gt; But he's right here with us the whole way &gt;&gt; to bring us all the way home. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I love how brother Brandon when he says that he says when the Holy Ghost he said takes a hold of that man and Christ stands at the end at the receiving end. He'll go through many whirlpools. Everybody been through a whirlpool. &gt;&gt; Not talking about a washer either. &gt;&gt; A whirlpool. And in a whirlpool you're just you're spinning trying to get your bearings right? Notice this is what the prophet said. He'll go through many whirlpools like Moses in that little ark, &gt;&gt; alligators and scary spooks and everything else that we've come through. Even things as brother Brandon went through within all that. How long are we perfected until the next time we make a boo boo? Until the next time. He went through a whole whole litany on that quote. I'm not going to read back over that. He went through a whole thing. How how long? We're perfected &gt;&gt; forever. &gt;&gt; Right. When he when he did the work of redemption, &gt;&gt; he's not standing up. He sat down. &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, he's at the receiving end. He has confidence in his word. &gt;&gt; And if you can receive it, it's him in you believing his own word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. the unfailing love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe tonight, I believe the Holy Spirit has pointed that out. Musicians come. I believe tonight that if we can take that like brother Brand was bringing that out just to accept it, Lord, in the way that the word was brought and preached tonight, &gt;&gt; he said, "Lord, I accept it." He said, "The Holy Spirit move right into that right there." I believe right here tonight, the Holy Spirit, I know he's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know God's here. Just just accept it. Accept it. Don't reason with it. Just take it in. &gt;&gt; It's mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just go to him in a word of prayer. If you'd like to stand, God bless you tonight. Amen. I know we have many, no doubt, many different needs. We spiritual needs. We got physical needs, emotional. Whatever your need is tonight, I want you to know that God cares. He cares about your need because he cares about you. He loves you. He cares about you. Safest place you can stand is on his word. Lord Jesus, thank you, Father, for your grace to us once again this evening. Thank you, Father, for just taking us through, Lord, these places, Lord, in your word, Lord. How how rich and how precious. What a comfort Lord. What a strength. What a refreshing and what an objective Lord. What a consolation that it is that Lord that each one if there's one that doesn't have have that Lord God love of God there in the depths of their heart but yet they know that it's your love that has been dealing with their lives the whole time working with them. You've been patient, but father is just even in this moment is just to Lord lay lay aside the filtering of their own thinking and just take the word the pure word just to take it in and say amen Lord so be it in my life &gt;&gt; Lord maybe it's a a need Lord for deliverance maybe it's a need Lord for a besetting sin, a weight. Maybe it's a need, Lord, for healing. But right here tonight, Lord God, we want to accept your word and say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord Jesus, to lay aside every thought, Lord God, every every thought, Lord, that we could have regarding ourselves. But you're not you're not speaking to us, Lord, based on of where we are here just upon earthly things. When you spoke to Job, you never mentioned one thing about the earth where he was standing. You never mentioned one thing about what was going on, but rather you took him back. Where were you when I laid the foundations of the world before that? When the sons of God shouted for joy, where were you, Job? Lord, maybe Lord, one of your children's in a whirlpool right now. Maybe there's a current maybe wanting to pull them like a rip current that we've been reading about seeing all this going on on our lake out here. Just had three people this past weekend. Lord, two young men there at Huntington Beach. The gentleman over there at Edgewater Pier fell off. Rip currents. They're giving announcements over. We see them come across our phone. Beach hazards. Lord God, a current that would pull somebody under. Lord, I pray right here tonight, Father. Lord God, I see, Lord, where they'll actually give like videos and demonstrations and they tell them, "Don't try to fight that current. Just go to one side." Lord, right here tonight, we want to side with the word. And Lord God, if there's any current Lord that Father underneath, if it's torment, Lord God, if there's any unsettling Lord, underneath, Lord, that would be trying to pull or hinder, Lord, oh God, any voice, Lord, of the accuser, Lord, oh Father, I pray tonight, may the great peace of Almighty God, may the God of peace, may you step forward, Lord. May you lead your children, Lord, lead them out, Father. I pray God of any rip current Lord of unbelief Lord, any rip current of doubt, Lord, any whirlpool, Lord God, where, Father, they're trying to find their bearings, Lord, and it just seems like it's spinning around and around. Maybe they're not in in a whirlpool, but maybe, Lord God, it's an alligator that Lord has approached this ark that they are sealed within with that pitch. And Lord God, like the enemy wanting to try to tantalize at that seal, wanting to try to tease at it and poke at it. Oh God, I pray right here tonight, Father, like your prophet said that the angels of God were right there over that ark and every time one of those alligators or crocodiles would come up around it, he said in another place, one of the angels would push its push its head back underwater with its foot because you've got angels all the way up and down this river of life. Lord God, they are stationed just like the prophet walking from that balcony, Lord, in that Houston coliseum when he spoke about there being over 500 ushers. And they later interviewed Sister Mey, she said there wasn't even close to that whatsoever of that many ushers. But what it was is the prophet was seeing in another realm. It was the angels of God that had lined the aisle as he walked from the balcony up there, Lord, to that place. Oh God, if Father, you were so mindful of your word, Lord, to prove it, Lord, and you wanted to have your picture taken with us, Lord, then how much more, dear God, have you not allow aligned the angels, Lord, right along, Father, the way all the way back home. As a matter of fact, on this ladder called Jacob's ladder, the fulfillment of the word, our Messiah, there are angels ascending and descending upon this ladder as we're on our way back home. &gt;&gt; It's not just one angels, not just five. It's innumerable. Innumerable. We're on our way home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, I pray right here tonight. &gt;&gt; May you grant the request in every life, hearts that Lord would say, I want the love of God in my heart in the very depths of my life to root out everything that's unlike God. I want that solidness, shity, and that settleness, that rest in my life. Lord, that's what I want. Maybe you would be one to say, Lord, I want that. Lord God, make it so clear. Make it so real to me, Lord. Would you just Lord God, just make that real, Lord, that in my heart, in my life, that settleness, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God, grant it right here tonight, Lord, I pray, Lord, those that are sick in their body, Lord. Maybe they've got a condition. Maybe they've received a report. Maybe something that's come. Lord God, Father, that Lord would be like a whirlpool and they don't know how to get out of it. But Father, you're at the end to receive us. And the Holy Spirit is right here with us. You are seeing us through every test, every trial. Your word will not return to you void. It cannot be defeated. You can be defeated. Grant it, Lord, I pray. Lord God, may you push every head of every alligator, every opposing spirit, Lord God. Father, that which would want to steal and try to consume the joy of my brother, my sister, that Lord God, that would want to try to take away from what you've done. Lord God, maybe Lord, it's a mistake like the prophet as he gave us right there in that message, Lord God. something, Lord, that it's been said or done. But yet, we can see the faithfulness, the strength of that work, as he said, from eternity to eternity. For by one offering has he perfected forever them that are sanctified, and he has sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high. Grant it, Lord. Guide us, Lord. Strengthen us. Encourage us. That's what you've done tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, we raise, Lord God, beyond our human love, Lord God, it's agape of love that's touched our hearts and warmed us once again tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stirring up that Lord God in our lives, Lord. Beyond the conditions, beyond situations, we raise our hands, Lord. We say we love you, Lord. We trust you, Lord God. I I don't know, Lord God, what what world pulls next or alligator, but I'm not worried about the world pulls an alligators as long as I know that I'm safe in you. &gt;&gt; Safe in God's pavilion. Safe in this ark. Safe where the pitch of the atonement of his life. Grant it Lord God in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; for the glory of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Oh, let's just worship him a few moments. Do you love him? Don't you love him? [Music] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. [Music] As I look back on this road I've traveled, I see so many times he's carried me through. [Music] And if there's one thing I learned in my life, it's my redeemer, &gt;&gt; oh yes, &gt;&gt; is faithful and true. My redeemer is faithful and true. Everything he has said he will do. Every morning his mercies on you. My redeemer is faithful and true. Sing that first verse again as I look back. Cuz as I look back on this road I've traveled, I see so many times he's carried me through. If there's one thing I have learned in my life, it's my redeemer is faithful and true. Oh, my redeemer is faithful and true. Everything he has said he will do. And every morning his mercies are new. My redeemer is faithful and true. Oh yes Lord. My heart rejices when I read the promise. There is a place I am preparing for you. I know someday I'll see my Lord face to face cuz my redeemer is faithful and true. Hallelujah. Oh my redeemer is faithful and true. Everything he has said he will do. Every morning his mercies are new. Oh so new. My redeemer is faithful. And just say that second verse again. My heart rejoices, Lord. Oh, my heart rejoices when I read the promise. There is a place I am preparing for you. [Music] I know someday I'll see my Lord face to face. Cuz my redeemer is faithful and true. Oh my redeemer faithful and true. Everything he has said he will do. Oh, every morning. Yes, his mercies are hallelujah. Oh yes, they're so new. Cuz my redeemer is faithful. Oh, I think that bears repeating. One more time. Oh my redeemer, he is faithful and true. Everything he has said he will do. Thank God. Every morning his mercies and new. My redeemer is faithful and true. Yes, my redeemer is faithful and Oh, one more time. My redeemer is faithful and true. Hallelujah. Sing one more song. I am a friend of God.
