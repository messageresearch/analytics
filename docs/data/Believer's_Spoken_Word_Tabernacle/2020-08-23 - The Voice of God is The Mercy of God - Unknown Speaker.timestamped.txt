[38:22] in a moment
[38:23] in a twinkling of an eye
[38:28] when you look at that in the scripture
[38:29] it's a moment it's that which is unable
[38:32] to be divided
[38:34] you know there's a lot of things you can
[38:35] divide
[38:36] right you keep on getting things smaller
[38:39] until we physically cannot divide it
[38:42] but then you can go to a certain machine
[38:43] and they can divide it like they divide
[38:45] atoms divide molecules but to understand
[38:48] that there's a moment
[38:50] of what god has done in your life that
[38:52] moment can't be divided
[38:55] and when this right here this body is
[38:57] changed it'll be a moment just like that
[39:00] moment
[39:02] it cannot be
[39:03] divided
[39:05] glory be to god
[39:08] you can't divide christ
[39:11] you can't divide him
[39:13] oh my don't you love him this morning

[39:50] where you're at but i want to speak not
[39:52] only to you but
[39:54] also to speak to the parents there's
[39:56] different things that i could
[39:58] you know read to you and
[40:00] refer to you from the scriptures and
[40:02] from the message but i want you to
[40:04] understand we're
[40:05] we we have things all around us that
[40:07] we've we know uh god has dealt with
[40:11] um
[40:12] we understand just like when the prayer
[40:14] requests have been mentioned here
[40:17] different ones in the assembly here even
[40:19] how god uh has has completely
[40:22] brought them through that of of the
[40:24] covid
[40:25] we know that uh we're not exempt or
[40:28] immune from sickness
[40:30] but we're also instructed by god not to
[40:33] fear it
[40:35] now let me just say it like this i know
[40:38] heart disease i know diabetes i know
[40:40] blood pressure i know all that stuff
[40:42] it's run in my family from way on back
[40:46] now
[40:47] to not fear it does not mean that i go
[40:49] hog wild and just eat whatever i want to
[40:52] eat
[40:53] well i've already lost you already right
[40:55] now
[40:59] you understand there's certain
[41:00] weaknesses that's in my body now i
[41:02] realize i realize that i can't you know
[41:05] make myself you know i where i'm going
[41:07] to live beyond a certain time or what
[41:09] that's all in god's hands
[41:11] but this is my desire while i'm here
[41:13] i want to give my very best to him
[41:17] i want to give my very best
[41:19] there's certain things that i know if
[41:20] i'm going to preach there's certain
[41:21] things i won't even eat the day before i
[41:23] won't even touch certain things i don't
[41:25] want anything to hinder that now that
[41:27] may seem kind of extreme to you or
[41:29] whatever but i don't like to be hindered
[41:31] even when i'm ministering
[41:33] but these are things that when we look
[41:35] at this with even the virus and that
[41:37] which is around us i know there's a lot
[41:39] of reports we've talked about that and
[41:41] it's just like this
[41:43] i've mentioned this to you before i'm
[41:45] not ignorant of it neither are you and i
[41:48] don't think anybody's ignorant of what's
[41:50] going on that's right
[41:53] come november
[41:54] things will start to lay down
[41:56] does it mean the virus is going to go
[41:58] away
[41:59] no
[42:00] are you with me there's a lot of things
[42:03] that's being hyped a lot of things
[42:04] that's being said a lot of fear a lot of
[42:07] things what's the best thing that can be
[42:08] done tune that out
[42:12] and look to
[42:14] jesus
[42:18] and i say it very clearly god didn't
[42:20] mean for you to live in a cave the rest
[42:21] of your life
[42:25] promise after promise is laying right
[42:27] here in the word
[42:30] a there's a there's a there's a quote
[42:32] i wish i could just read it here
[42:35] but the spirit of god comes down and
[42:37] deals with a man 1964 on the platform he
[42:40] had been poisoned with carbon monoxide
[42:43] poisoning
[42:44] he had developed a complex
[42:47] a fear
[42:48] about going back into work listen to me
[42:51] now
[42:52] the spirit of god picks that up and says
[42:55] sir
[42:57] you're poor
[42:58] and you've got to go back to work
[43:02] but he said jesus christ set you free
[43:07] go and be of a good cheer
[43:10] i'm telling you the authority of the
[43:11] word we're under
[43:14] doesn't mean we're immune from it
[43:15] doesn't cause us to act
[43:17] careless or reckless or arrogant but we
[43:20] are walking this is a time to live upon
[43:23] this word live in this word it's a time
[43:26] to take god at his word
[43:29] and the bible says lord i'm with you
[43:31] always.
[43:33] amen now i'm not talking about god
[43:35] didn't tell me to go walk into a coveted
[43:37] ward and go pray for everybody that
[43:39] ain't what i'm talking about
[43:41] but if god did tell me just like he's
[43:42] told the brothers who walk into the
[43:44] leprosy colonies then we obey god and
[43:47] know that god's our protection
[43:49] when you have to go back to work or you
[43:50] have to go back to school or whatever
[43:52] don't fret
[43:54] commit your ways unto the lord
[44:01] listen
[44:02] somebody sent me a little
[44:04] uh um
[44:08] a little um we call them means i think
[44:10] that's what you call them
[44:12] and it showed you know
[44:14] people walking in walmart with their
[44:15] masks but but but they said oh my
[44:18] goodness i better not go to church
[44:19] because if i go to church the devil
[44:20] might get me
[44:22] now i know that may if those of you
[44:24] streaming and you don't don't don't take
[44:26] that wrong but i just want you to
[44:28] understand as you go back into school
[44:30] and you go back into different places
[44:32] god told joshua don't you fear
[44:39] god said don't you fear
[44:41] there's a place of safety that's in
[44:43] goshen
[44:46] and with many different ones that you
[44:49] know just like
[44:51] i believe you know
[44:53] individuals trying their best to try
[44:55] like like we all are trying to do what
[44:57] we can even as an assembly and as a
[44:59] church to do uh the best within the
[45:02] situation we're not ignorant of satan's
[45:06] devices
[45:07] but we're looking to god
[45:09] and i i that that the scripture in the
[45:11] book of zechariah is what has so stood
[45:13] out to me where god told israel in that
[45:16] time of with their time of visitation
[45:18] that's coming he said i'll be a wall of
[45:20] fire around you
[45:22] remember it won't be the walls of
[45:23] jerusalem in that hour that will be a
[45:25] protection of 144 000 because even the
[45:29] orthodox jews will rise up against that
[45:32] 144 000.
[45:34] there will be a small remnant 144 000
[45:37] but god says my word will be a wall of
[45:40] fire around about you
[45:43] amen so we're we're not arrogant we're
[45:45] not ignorant of it but the thing is that
[45:47] we want to do because with many of our
[45:49] you know different ones you know of
[45:51] different brothers and pastors and
[45:52] whatever more and you know sometimes you
[45:54] get into that and people say well this
[45:56] should have been done and that should
[45:58] have been done and this should have been
[45:59] done and nobody knows what in the world
[46:00] was being done or wasn't what being done
[46:03] but i i'll say to you right now
[46:05] that there's one thing about it
[46:07] this we will see the media is really
[46:12] an instrument of trying to control the
[46:14] people
[46:16] it's propaganda
[46:19] they want to throw things in and cite
[46:21] things and stir things up and this and
[46:23] that and you got this man standing this
[46:25] way and this man standing this way and
[46:28] um i just i say that to you because as
[46:31] as parents when we go back into
[46:33] our schools like uh like even you know
[46:36] for
[46:37] um
[46:38] you know our children and things like
[46:39] that the boys i know they're my our
[46:41] oldest two are not able to go back out
[46:43] there to the uh college the classes they
[46:46] tried to sign up for classes that would
[46:47] be on campus and
[46:49] then get these that are online and
[46:52] uh but uh you know zachary he's got
[46:55] some class that he'll be going to that
[46:57] will even be outside of the home so
[47:00] i know different ones that that are
[47:01] going back and i just i pray that god
[47:04] this morning will comfort you because
[47:06] his parents and his children there are
[47:09] it's going to be a different environment
[47:11] you've got a you know wear mask and
[47:13] everything else and
[47:15] and
[47:16] you know the things that you've got to
[47:17] comply with and i pray for those of you
[47:20] that's that's teachers
[47:22] brother danny do you have to go back
[47:24] brother and i you already did and i pray
[47:27] for those of you that's teachers because
[47:29] i you know every time they add something
[47:30] to the agenda that you got to do i mean
[47:33] you can just imagine trying to keep
[47:35] masks on little guys
[47:37] and let alone having big guys who are
[47:40] clowns with a mask you know you can just
[47:42] imagine that so um we we want to just
[47:46] keep everything in prayer and you just
[47:48] remember that when you walk into that
[47:50] classroom
[47:51] he said
[47:53] i am with you
[47:56] he said i'll never forsake you
[48:01] amen he he specifically as he told the
[48:04] prophet in this hour it was not listen
[48:06] to me that promise that he made real to
[48:09] him of matthew 28
[48:11] don't you fear to go anywhere
[48:13] no i am with thee always that is a
[48:17] promise that is given to the believer
[48:20] who is walking in the word
[48:23] [Applause]

[48:27] god is our provider
[48:29] god has been seeing us through god will

[48:48] up and he preaches in the message all
[48:50] things he said even death is given to

[49:34] he's waiting
[49:36] i don't say those things lightly i say
[49:39] that because we recognize that when we
[49:41] look at all this and these things that
[49:42] are around us we recognize that that
[49:45] that even death itself to a believer
[49:49] it is no longer our slave or our master
[49:55] it is there to pull us

[53:07] lord i
[53:10] i'm not very good at these things
[53:12] lord i
[53:14] [Music]
[53:15] many times lord my words they fail me i
[53:18] get nervous
[53:22] but i pray that
[53:25] god i know lord is your children
[53:29] this burden lord has been on my heart
[53:31] since all this even began lord over five
[53:33] months ago i thought lord
[53:37] there's got to be a resuming
[53:39] and may you give us the strength
[53:42] may you give us the courage
[53:45] give us wisdom lord
[53:49] god there's testimonies that even right
[53:51] here in this assembly
[53:52] [Music]
[53:53] where
[53:54] people that you caused a sickness in
[53:57] their home
[53:59] and they were homesick
[54:01] not they but they were caring for for
[54:03] that which is sick in their house
[54:06] if they had been there in that
[54:08] department
[54:09] at that moment
[54:11] they would have had to quarantine
[54:13] without pay
[54:18] but you seemed to it oh it was an
[54:20] inconvenience to them
[54:23] but you seem to it that they weren't
[54:24] there
[54:25] during that time
[54:28] so lord they were the only one out of
[54:29] that whole floor
[54:31] that was able to go back to work
[54:34] now lord
[54:36] those things right there when i i see it
[54:43] i know from their heart lord they're so
[54:45] thankful they see your hand of mercy
[54:48] [Music]
[54:50] but i believe that's a witness i believe
[54:52] that's
[54:53] lord of witness to each of our hearts
[54:55] and our lives
[54:58] that god you're watching out for us
[55:02] and we ask that you would help us to be
[55:04] sensitive not anxious
[55:07] not nervous
[55:08] but to be sensitive
[55:10] [Music]
[55:12] this is lord the simplicity that's given
[55:15] to us as believers to follow
[55:18] the leading of the holy spirit
[55:21] the lord is daddies and mamas and
[55:24] i know grandparents have the lord the

[55:48] god i i want to say
[55:51] i pray that you would help them
[55:53] to get what they need to get
[55:56] and may there be such a filter on their
[55:58] life that would filter out all the junk
[56:03] because lord we realize that even in
[56:06] many of these institutions
[56:08] that are out there i knew it when i was
[56:10] there
[56:11] many of them lord they've got their own
[56:14] agendas
[56:17] we see it
[56:18] we see those agendas coming out in the
[56:20] streets and everything else now
[56:23] but god i'm so thankful we've got
[56:26] our eyes are set
[56:30] on another city

[56:41] of that city

[56:51] down in babylon lord it's wrote of them
[56:54] daniel well we know he was a servant of
[56:56] god but daniel
[56:58] he had great understanding in the
[57:00] sciences
[57:02] he had great understanding that your
[57:04] word tells us that but he didn't rest
[57:06] upon that
[57:10] may the lord god each and every one of
[57:12] the
[57:13] of the children the teenagers and so
[57:15] forth lord going to school

[1:00:36] jeremiah chapter 38 and i'm going to
[1:00:38] read a few verses of scripture here
[1:00:49] jeremiah 38 and
[1:00:52] verse 14.
[1:01:02] now this this portion of scripture that
[1:01:05] i'm going to we're going to read i
[1:01:08] so lord just really pressing on my heart
[1:01:10] from
[1:01:12] um
[1:01:14] as we've been reading here and and
[1:01:16] looking at this
[1:01:17] with
[1:01:18] impending judgment that was coming upon
[1:01:21] israel
[1:01:22] and we read in the earlier parts last
[1:01:25] week
[1:01:27] on
[1:01:28] ibedemalek the ethiopian and how that he
[1:01:31] heard that jeremiah had been cast into
[1:01:33] the dungeon
[1:01:34] and he lowered down with such care old
[1:01:38] rags old cloths
[1:01:40] that he could put up on the cords and be
[1:01:43] raised up
[1:01:44] there was a
[1:01:47] ebenmelec
[1:01:49] recognized
[1:01:51] jeremiah was
[1:01:53] and he recognized
[1:01:54] the word of god
[1:01:57] who he recognized he recognized god was
[1:02:00] represented in their midst
[1:02:05] and so
[1:02:06] now we come after that has been done
[1:02:09] he's been raised he's been raised up by
[1:02:13] the bed melech the king's servant now
[1:02:15] here we come to zedekiah the king which
[1:02:17] was indeed the king
[1:02:19] at this time
[1:02:21] and i want you to notice here how the
[1:02:22] king's approach
[1:02:25] this is not the first time jeremiah or
[1:02:27] hell had audience with him this is the
[1:02:30] second time
[1:02:31] but then zedekiah the king sent and took
[1:02:35] jeremiah the prophet unto him
[1:02:37] into the third entry that is in the
[1:02:40] house of the lord
[1:02:42] and the king said unto jeremiah
[1:02:45] i will ask thee a thing
[1:02:47] hide
[1:02:48] nothing
[1:02:49] from me
[1:02:51] then jeremiah said unto zedekiah
[1:02:54] if i declare it unto thee
[1:02:58] wilt thou not surely put me to
[1:03:00] death and if i give thee counsel
[1:03:04] will thou not hearken unto me
[1:03:06] yes that jeremiah is asking
[1:03:09] verse 16
[1:03:11] so zedekiah the king swears secretly
[1:03:15] unto jeremiah
[1:03:17] saying as the lord liveth that made us
[1:03:20] this soul recognizing god's the creator
[1:03:23] i will not put thee to death
[1:03:26] neither will i give thee into the hand
[1:03:28] of these men
[1:03:30] that seek thy life
[1:03:33] now how many questions did he answer
[1:03:36] one
[1:03:38] he didn't answer
[1:03:40] the second question
[1:03:42] will you hearken
[1:03:44] unto me
[1:03:46] the answered one
[1:03:47] but not the second one
[1:03:49] may god bless you bless the reading of
[1:03:51] the words you're being seated
[1:03:55] i want to speak on that thought here
[1:03:57] this morning
[1:03:59] the voice of god
[1:04:02] is the mercy of god
[1:04:05] the voice of god
[1:04:07] is the mercy of god
[1:04:10] they were standing in a great place of
[1:04:12] reverence you recognize many times how
[1:04:15] that
[1:04:16] um
[1:04:18] things can be
[1:04:20] orchestrated
[1:04:21] as backgrounds
[1:04:23] that the backgrounds will actually try
[1:04:26] to say something or try to sway people
[1:04:30] in a certain way
[1:04:32] here zedekiah has has asked for audience
[1:04:36] with jeremiah
[1:04:38] now remember he's also been the one
[1:04:40] already who
[1:04:43] after they had already had a a council
[1:04:45] before right after zedekiah became
[1:04:48] put in as king
[1:04:50] that
[1:04:52] he wouldn't hearken then to zedek to
[1:04:54] zedekiah or to jeremiah
[1:04:57] and then there were men who came along
[1:04:59] and said
[1:05:01] that were connected with hananiah and
[1:05:03] they said this guy speaks treason he's
[1:05:05] speaking
[1:05:06] against the nation of israel
[1:05:10] but what you see when when when when
[1:05:13] when spiritual discernment when when
[1:05:15] when eyes are left from a people and
[1:05:18] people leave the word
[1:05:20] they'll believe anything
[1:05:23] when what happened with eve when here
[1:05:25] cain came along
[1:05:28] what did she say
[1:05:29] i've gotten a man from the lord
[1:05:33] in one part of that
[1:05:35] it was true in the sense of there's a
[1:05:38] law of reproduction
[1:05:41] but in the sense that it was god's
[1:05:43] desired
[1:05:45] will
[1:05:46] that she would give herself
[1:05:49] to that
[1:05:50] of the serpent the enemy using that tool
[1:05:54] to then bring forth cain
[1:05:56] that was not god's program
[1:05:59] but you see she had gotten away
[1:06:01] from the word to where it should just
[1:06:03] believe anything
[1:06:06] now the thing is is that
[1:06:08] the people
[1:06:09] had gotten away
[1:06:12] from the word
[1:06:13] to where they couldn't understand
[1:06:16] god had called israel to of a certain uh
[1:06:20] the name that god would use you find it
[1:06:22] in the book of
[1:06:23] deuteronomy uh jesus which is god's
[1:06:27] ideal character of israel
[1:06:30] of how that her life of how israel was
[1:06:33] to live and how they were to walk before
[1:06:36] god but she drifted from that
[1:06:39] character
[1:06:41] you see this is why it doesn't matter so
[1:06:44] much about we can look back at history
[1:06:47] and say well you know we're relying on
[1:06:50] this from history but remember
[1:06:52] what what was in the history is truly
[1:06:55] past
[1:06:57] you can't live off of the history
[1:07:00] you've got to live
[1:07:02] off of present tense
[1:07:05] jesus said man shall not live by bread
[1:07:08] alone but by every word that proceeds
[1:07:10] from the mouth of god
[1:07:12] when he sent moses to deliver
[1:07:15] uh the the the children of israel he
[1:07:18] never sent him with the i was
[1:07:20] right
[1:07:22] his name was not revealed as the i was
[1:07:24] or i will be but it is the i am
[1:07:28] and that's how god he reveals himself to
[1:07:32] his children in this hour and that's
[1:07:34] what draws you to him is because he
[1:07:37] reveals himself as the ever-present god
[1:07:42] the i am that i am
[1:07:45] it is a reality it might seem like a few
[1:07:47] words but god that is revealing his
[1:07:51] character his nature and that is he is
[1:07:54] the ever-present god
[1:07:57] they had lost their sense of discernment
[1:08:00] and they were taking the word that was
[1:08:03] being spoken in this time by jeremiah it
[1:08:07] had even from the time of isaiah they
[1:08:10] were looking at it as being a treasonous
[1:08:13] word you're speaking against the nation
[1:08:15] of israel and god wasn't speaking
[1:08:18] against as far as the the nation god was
[1:08:21] coming against the sin that had drew
[1:08:24] them from the character that his word
[1:08:28] had brought them out of egypt and was
[1:08:30] desiring to form inside of their life
[1:08:34] they had drifted from what god had
[1:08:37] desired
[1:08:41] it wasn't treasonous but you see this is
[1:08:44] why spiritual discernment is so
[1:08:47] necessary in our life and in our walk
[1:08:55] we have to rely on him because there are
[1:08:58] things that you and i are brought face
[1:09:01] to face with that emotionally we would
[1:09:04] side emotions can be moved even in the
[1:09:07] wrong direction that's what satan did to
[1:09:09] eve
[1:09:11] he began to talk to her then he started
[1:09:13] to touch to it touch her her emotions
[1:09:16] moved her in disobedience to the word
[1:09:20] spiritual discernment will help you to
[1:09:24] discern even though emotionally you feel
[1:09:26] pulled this way but spiritual
[1:09:28] discernment will keep you centered on
[1:09:32] the word and it'll override that emotion
[1:09:40] i mean the backdrop what a place i mean
[1:09:42] if we're looking at a photo op here
[1:09:46] my
[1:09:48] here he is standing in the third entry
[1:09:50] to the house
[1:09:51] of the lord
[1:09:54] and here he is he's asking inquiry of
[1:09:56] jeremiah i don't want you to hide
[1:09:58] nothing from me
[1:10:01] the reality of it is is that zedekiah is
[1:10:04] hoping
[1:10:05] trusting
[1:10:07] somehow
[1:10:08] jeremiah is going to
[1:10:10] change what he said originally
[1:10:13] but god don't change his mind
[1:10:17] he said i'm god and i change not
[1:10:20] men change but god don't change
[1:10:24] his nature disposition what it was
[1:10:27] before is still the same today
[1:10:34] and one thing we would look and say oh
[1:10:36] my
[1:10:37] zedekiah is here speaking to him
[1:10:40] in the uh you know the third entry to
[1:10:43] the house of the lord what a reverence
[1:10:46] but you see
[1:10:48] all of that is is uh important to
[1:10:51] reverence the house of the lord
[1:10:54] i mean we shouldn't come in here and
[1:10:56] just talk
[1:10:59] we shouldn't just let me just preach a
[1:11:00] little bit
[1:11:02] we shouldn't just come in here and plop
[1:11:03] down and just expect and say well you
[1:11:05] know what god's been giving us good
[1:11:07] services man i i can't wait till we get
[1:11:09] in there you've got to make an
[1:11:10] investment
[1:11:13] and that investment means even in you
[1:11:15] getting here and coming in here and
[1:11:18] praying and seeking out the lord not
[1:11:20] just slipping in here well you know i
[1:11:22] just praise god i barely made it
[1:11:27] try that on your job and see if it works
[1:11:31] [Applause]
[1:11:37] sweet jesus
[1:11:43] in the book of malachi they were
[1:11:44] bringing sacrifices to god that were
[1:11:47] lame blind and whole and god said go
[1:11:51] offer that to your governor your boss go
[1:11:54] offer that to them see if they'll accept
[1:11:56] that
[1:11:56] amen
[1:12:00] he deserves our very best
[1:12:04] amen he has given he didn't give a
[1:12:06] second best come on somebody
[1:12:10] jesus is not the second person of the
[1:12:12] godhead it's god himself come down
[1:12:17] he gave us himself
[1:12:21] [Applause]
[1:12:24] [Music]
[1:12:28] i think that's a little extreme those of
[1:12:29] you that work on machines
[1:12:31] you don't just punch the clock and go on
[1:12:33] over there and start working on a
[1:12:34] machine you get in there enough time
[1:12:36] they got they got things they're going
[1:12:37] to tell you like such things like
[1:12:39] they'll say hey you know uh brother joey
[1:12:41] don't call your brother but i will they
[1:12:42] say hey brother joy look that that third
[1:12:44] floor up there
[1:12:45] don't we've already got the trim taken
[1:12:47] care of on that floor up there all you
[1:12:48] got to do is start right here and on
[1:12:49] this here or when you get on the machine
[1:12:51] hey we're we got we got a repair man
[1:12:53] over there on this right here you have
[1:12:55] to get debriefed before you start into
[1:12:58] that
[1:12:58] lord i did not know we're going to go
[1:13:00] this way
[1:13:02] but you see what it is there's an
[1:13:04] investment to what you're doing
[1:13:09] don't give that first place and give god
[1:13:12] second place
[1:13:13] he deserves first place
[1:13:15] any knowledge you have any skills you
[1:13:18] have any ability you have the job you
[1:13:20] have the clothes on your back the air
[1:13:23] that you breathing it belongs to him
[1:13:25] he's allowed you to use it
[1:13:33] reverence
[1:13:35] what a reverential thing it was all my
[1:13:39] zedekiah
[1:13:41] it's here the third entry of the house
[1:13:43] of the lord
[1:13:46] but you see
[1:13:48] god is looking for a deeper reverence
[1:13:52] god doesn't want a photo op all right
[1:13:54] all right
[1:13:55] amen
[1:13:58] well i'm identified with the message
[1:14:02] having a book don't identify you with a
[1:14:04] message
[1:14:06] having a tape having a picture having
[1:14:08] your belt buckle having water visiting
[1:14:10] all the sites don't identify you with
[1:14:12] the message
[1:14:16] the only way you're identified with it
[1:14:19] is to have the living god living inside
[1:14:24] of you
[1:14:31] reference like a photo op
[1:14:36] god wants a greater reverence
[1:14:39] the reverence that god looks for
[1:14:41] is a life
[1:14:43] that would be willing
[1:14:46] to let itself
[1:14:48] down to him
[1:14:49] that he can come and tabernacle his life
[1:14:54] inside yes
[1:14:58] this is what a real true marriage and a
[1:14:59] real true union is about
[1:15:02] it's not about 50 50. right right
[1:15:06] it's about
[1:15:07] how can i please
[1:15:08] one another
[1:15:10] amen
[1:15:16] now god let me just refer to this
[1:15:18] without
[1:15:19] taking time necessarily to read it
[1:15:23] not that i don't think it needs to be
[1:15:24] read it's very important
[1:15:27] but in hebrews chapter 12
[1:15:30] paul
[1:15:31] under inspiration he he brings
[1:15:34] the comparison of where israel was
[1:15:37] called
[1:15:38] to
[1:15:39] uh mount horeb
[1:15:41] but on that mountain remember god was
[1:15:44] going to speak to him and it thundered
[1:15:46] it rumbled even a beast that touched the
[1:15:49] mountain
[1:15:50] had to be slaughtered and israel said
[1:15:54] let not god speak anymore
[1:15:57] but let moses speak
[1:15:58] [Music]
[1:16:00] you see god's desire was that he would
[1:16:02] speak
[1:16:04] through
[1:16:04] man
[1:16:06] it would be
[1:16:08] for
[1:16:08] mankind one of the greatest stumbling
[1:16:11] blocks
[1:16:12] it would be the simplicity that would
[1:16:15] actually go beyond the reasonings and
[1:16:17] would actually be that that would
[1:16:19] overthrow the reasonings of man is god
[1:16:22] to come down in a man a person who is
[1:16:25] fallible full of mistakes uh maybe he
[1:16:28] had said this wrong or you know the men
[1:16:30] should have said this and he said this
[1:16:32] but yet it takes a real faith and faith
[1:16:36] itself is that which comes by an
[1:16:38] experience that gives you an eyesight to
[1:16:41] be able to look beyond that flesh and to
[1:16:44] recognize that that is god and that's
[1:16:47] god speaking to me
[1:16:51] god chose fallible men the infallible
[1:16:54] god chose fallible men
[1:16:57] to come down and use and speak his word
[1:17:02] through and it would be that word when
[1:17:04] the rest of him would say
[1:17:05] he's just a man ah he's just a man but
[1:17:08] there's something about it that the
[1:17:10] elect of god can recognize though that's
[1:17:13] a man but coming out of there is the
[1:17:15] worship
[1:17:16] that moves from that of mount horn
[1:17:19] where the laws were given thou shalt not
[1:17:22] and thou shalt not and thou shalt not
[1:17:24] remember the law
[1:17:26] was needed
[1:17:28] because how could there be a penalty
[1:17:30] without a law
[1:17:32] it's like out here 35 miles per hour
[1:17:34] right you don't believe they'll enforce
[1:17:36] it
[1:17:37] go 35 and one quarter over
[1:17:39] by god's grace i've never been pulled
[1:17:41] over but you understand you you know
[1:17:42] this
[1:17:43] what good would it do did not have a law
[1:17:47] but you see law
[1:17:48] was that which spoke
[1:17:51] and it was brought it was condemnation
[1:17:53] it pointed out you're guilty
[1:17:56] but this in itself
[1:17:59] what it was all part of the plan where
[1:18:02] god himself where we were held guilty
[1:18:05] our nature
[1:18:07] our nature
[1:18:09] was contrary to god's nature
[1:18:13] but down on the inside beneath that old
[1:18:16] nature there was a seed of god on the
[1:18:19] inside
[1:18:21] amen
[1:18:22] that's why it would bother you wasn't
[1:18:24] just your conscience there's a seed down
[1:18:27] there on the inside
[1:18:29] as much as you tried to fit in with the
[1:18:31] world you couldn't fit in with them
[1:18:34] you might do some of the things they do
[1:18:36] say some of the things they say partake
[1:18:38] of some of the things they partake of
[1:18:40] but you still can't fit in
[1:18:45] amen
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:49] it'd be like trying this is made out of
[1:18:51] triple brick this this building on the
[1:18:52] outside it'd be like taking a triple
[1:18:54] brick and or taking another kind of
[1:18:57] brick or another color and trying to fit
[1:18:59] it in here it would stick out like a
[1:19:01] sore thumb
[1:19:04] come on eagle you were in the chicken
[1:19:06] yard
[1:19:08] they made fun of you and all those
[1:19:10] things this is why because god won't
[1:19:13] allow you to get comfortable because
[1:19:15] that's not where you belong that's not
[1:19:19] who you are
[1:19:23] [Applause]
[1:19:27] paulden brings it you're not come to
[1:19:29] mount horeb
[1:19:31] you come to mount sinai sinai or uh zion
[1:19:34] sorry my my mount sign mount zion this
[1:19:37] is where you come you come
[1:19:40] to this
[1:19:41] this living reality of the city that new
[1:19:44] jerusalem the living god dwelling
[1:19:48] in the midst of his people not just god
[1:19:51] dwelling in the man christ jesus but now
[1:19:55] that same god who came down and he paid
[1:19:59] the price he redeemed us he sent back
[1:20:01] the holy ghost so that the same holy
[1:20:04] ghost would live and continue on the
[1:20:07] work that has begun there in his life he
[1:20:10] is the apostle of our profession and the
[1:20:14] apostolic age is still in session he's
[1:20:17] still calling lies to himself the gospel
[1:20:20] is still going out he's still filling
[1:20:23] with the holy ghost
[1:20:24] he's still sending you you might wonder
[1:20:27] why am i in this department why am i
[1:20:29] going to work over there you are sent by
[1:20:32] god as a representation
[1:20:36] of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:20:42] your life is a witness
[1:20:45] that god is alive
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:50] don't take that lightly
[1:20:52] your life is a witness
[1:20:55] that god is alive
[1:20:58] your life is a witness that god is not
[1:21:01] confined to church walls
[1:21:03] your life is a testimony that is not
[1:21:06] bound by traditions and creeds and
[1:21:09] reforms but your life is a testimony let
[1:21:13] me tell you what god does sounding out
[1:21:15] through your life you might look back
[1:21:17] and say well i wish i hadn't done that
[1:21:18] in my past i wish i hadn't done that in
[1:21:20] my past your past has been chopped off
[1:21:24] when you've been filled by the spirit of
[1:21:26] god the abstract to the title deed has
[1:21:29] come it has joined you into that real
[1:21:33] eternal germ of god there's an
[1:21:36] expression that's going forth in your
[1:21:38] life and the very things about your life
[1:21:41] somebody else might be bound with that
[1:21:43] or seemingly maybe something less but
[1:21:46] there's a testimony out of your life
[1:21:48] that they aren't going to some place
[1:21:50] over in israel mount zion but mount zion
[1:21:53] is a dwelling place where the spirit of
[1:21:56] the living god there's a representation
[1:21:59] on earth that there is another city
[1:22:02] there is another kingdom there is
[1:22:04] another king there is the king of kings
[1:22:07] and your life is an expression of it as
[1:22:10] the word has moved inside of you
[1:22:14] more than a photo op
[1:22:30] verse 24 of that i will read this one
[1:22:33] this is what we're called to
[1:22:35] and to jesus
[1:22:36] the mediator
[1:22:38] of the new covenant
[1:22:44] now listen to me carefully
[1:22:46] jesus said
[1:22:48] no man
[1:22:49] cometh to the father
[1:22:51] but by
[1:22:53] me
[1:22:56] you can't get around him
[1:22:58] you can't go over him
[1:23:02] you can't go under him
[1:23:04] are you hearing me we're gonna pick this
[1:23:07] up you can't get to him you cannot get
[1:23:10] to god you cannot get back into the
[1:23:12] promises without coming through jesus
[1:23:14] christ
[1:23:15] and he is the word
[1:23:27] aren't you glad you've been invited back
[1:23:28] home
[1:23:30] [Applause]
[1:23:36] hey the reality of it was we were on
[1:23:38] that train and they're just having to
[1:23:39] make a rest stop
[1:23:42] we were under spiritual amnesia
[1:23:49] boy let me just preach what i got in
[1:23:51] front of me
[1:23:53] but you happen to recognize
[1:23:56] something
[1:23:57] that's familiar
[1:24:00] familiar to this no familiar to this
[1:24:08] and jesus the mediator of the new
[1:24:10] covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[1:24:13] that speaketh better things than that of
[1:24:16] abel remember this blood
[1:24:18] speaks better things
[1:24:20] this blood has a voice
[1:24:23] this blood is not there saying uh you're
[1:24:26] guilty you're guilty you're guilty this
[1:24:29] blood says
[1:24:30] all are guilty but i've set you free
[1:24:34] will you accept your freedom
[1:24:37] [Applause]
[1:24:39] that's the sounding of this jubilee the
[1:24:42] acceptable year of the lord
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:51] and the scripture said see that you
[1:24:53] refuse him not verse 25
[1:24:55] that speaketh for if they escape not who
[1:24:58] refused him that spake on earth much
[1:25:00] more shall we shall not we escape if we
[1:25:02] turn away from him that speaketh from
[1:25:04] heaven whose voice then shook the earth
[1:25:06] this time notice the contrast coming
[1:25:08] from mountain horror mount sinai but now
[1:25:11] he hath promised saying yet once more i
[1:25:13] shake not the earth only but also
[1:25:16] heaven
[1:25:17] heavens and earth will pass away
[1:25:21] is that right there's got to come a
[1:25:23] change of administration
[1:25:26] amen
[1:25:27] the earth is a redeemable attribute of
[1:25:29] god
[1:25:30] there's got to come a passing away of
[1:25:33] the world
[1:25:35] and the heavens
[1:25:37] all of the contaminants the pollution of
[1:25:40] demons devils that are there in the
[1:25:43] atmosphere listen this is bible for we
[1:25:45] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:25:48] against principalities and spiritual
[1:25:51] wickedness in high
[1:26:01] satan has control of every kingdom
[1:26:07] yeah he has control of every one of them
[1:26:11] but there's one kingdom
[1:26:13] he don't have control over him
[1:26:16] and that's the kingdom of god amen
[1:26:19] he's afraid of the kingdom of god
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:24] the kingdom of god is god's word made
[1:26:27] power to you
[1:26:29] in you and through you
[1:26:31] we receive a kingdom a god of a dominion
[1:26:35] that of a domain that of an authority
[1:26:37] because the very king himself by his
[1:26:40] word he comes and he sets down on the
[1:26:43] throne of our heart courage we wouldn't
[1:26:45] have this kind of a courage if it wasn't
[1:26:48] for him
[1:26:49] if we were looking at something fleshly
[1:26:51] to back us up we would not have the
[1:26:53] courage to stand but the courage comes
[1:26:56] from knowing in whom we have believed
[1:27:00] and to know who's there backing us up we
[1:27:04] got the same back-up plan that david had
[1:27:07] we got the same back-up plan that the
[1:27:09] hebrew children have we got the same
[1:27:11] back-up plan that elijah has brother
[1:27:14] there ain't nothing breach beats this
[1:27:16] plan it's not on the exchange you can't
[1:27:19] sign up for it but you can't accept it
[1:27:23] you're talking about a health plan it
[1:27:25] will change your soul and it will lead
[1:27:29] to the change of your body
[1:27:34] whereby
[1:27:36] we receive
[1:27:38] receive receive
[1:27:39] a kingdom
[1:27:41] which cannot be moved
[1:27:44] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[1:27:46] god acceptably with reverence
[1:27:48] and godly fear for our god
[1:27:51] is a consuming fire
[1:27:57] remember
[1:27:59] here we are standing
[1:28:03] in this hour
[1:28:05] in a time
[1:28:07] that god would declare
[1:28:09] our position
[1:28:10] in the scriptures
[1:28:12] where we're at we're in a time of
[1:28:14] fulfillment where things have been laid
[1:28:16] as types
[1:28:17] it's now in a time of fulfilling
[1:28:20] those types
[1:28:22] god would express and identify
[1:28:25] the age the time the characteristic of
[1:28:28] this age
[1:28:29] this age is known as the lady of seeing
[1:28:31] age
[1:28:33] ladies means what
[1:28:35] people's
[1:28:36] rights yes
[1:28:39] that's what it means
[1:28:42] people are fighting for rights
[1:28:50] but if that's happening in the natural
[1:28:52] and believe me they're spiritual their
[1:28:54] spirits influencing that
[1:28:58] daniel prayed
[1:29:00] and he had to wait 21 days
[1:29:03] because the prince of persia withstood
[1:29:07] gabriel from coming right
[1:29:10] but then michael showed up
[1:29:16] let me tell you something the devil has
[1:29:18] tried to stop you might have prayed and
[1:29:20] there's prayers you pray and the devil
[1:29:23] has tried to stop it but you let christ
[1:29:25] show up
[1:29:26] [Applause]
[1:29:33] hallelujah
[1:29:35] you might be waiting on your gabriel
[1:29:37] that has a special message for your life
[1:29:40] but remember it'll be christ that'll
[1:29:42] break through and allow gabriel to come
[1:29:44] to you
[1:29:47] you see the only thing that satan would
[1:29:49] like to hold it back that's why he'll
[1:29:51] try to sit in service and get your mind
[1:29:53] on this get your mind on this and then
[1:29:55] he'll raise up your own flesh and
[1:29:57] everything else in this situation well i
[1:29:59] can't oh that don't you realize what
[1:30:01] that is that's the prince of persia
[1:30:04] that's trying to withhold you but if
[1:30:06] you'll stand right there on god's word
[1:30:09] he said ask the father anything in my
[1:30:12] name and i will do it brother that will
[1:30:14] invite michael to show up and you'll
[1:30:17] receive your answer you'll receive the
[1:30:20] deposit of the message in your soul
[1:30:27] [Applause]
[1:30:31] you can't keep back god from his
[1:30:33] children
[1:30:35] the devil can try to wind him in all
[1:30:37] kinds of turmoil and wind them in this
[1:30:39] and wind them in that but you can't keep
[1:30:42] god back from his child
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:45] there ain't enough corn chucks there
[1:30:47] ain't enough pig manure there ain't
[1:30:48] enough pig pens there ain't enough to
[1:30:50] keep god back from one of his children
[1:30:56] oh if you can receive it this morning
[1:30:58] he's pulling on you
[1:31:00] [Applause]
[1:31:05] he said behold i stand at the door and
[1:31:08] knock
[1:31:11] amen

[1:32:19] there ain't no keyhole on the outside
[1:32:22] the only one can open it is you
[1:32:25] the knocking at your door is his voice
[1:32:28] talking to you
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:33] and that's his promise i will come in

[1:32:48] ever came out with it better homes and
[1:32:50] gardens you didn't realize that your
[1:32:52] life was meant to be a garden of eden
[1:32:55] he already had it you just let him get
[1:32:58] back inside his garden let him get
[1:33:01] inside of your life he will bring forth
[1:33:03] the fragrance of the lily of the valley
[1:33:06] he will bring forth all the sweet spices
[1:33:09] he will cause his life to so move
[1:33:12] through your life to where he finds your
[1:33:15] life
[1:33:16] a place of rest
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:24] i'm proof he knows how to clean up a
[1:33:25] life
[1:33:26] [Applause]
[1:33:30] and there's a lot more in here that as
[1:33:31] well as like that but you might be
[1:33:33] sitting here as a young person somebody
[1:33:34] else said well i never did anything but
[1:33:36] you still need your life cleaned up
[1:33:38] you still need your life you still need
[1:33:40] your nature changed so that it's one
[1:33:42] with god
[1:33:45] notice as he goes on we we understand
[1:33:47] that as here zedekiah is there with
[1:33:51] jeremiah in verse 17.
[1:33:54] notice jeremiah as we continue there
[1:33:57] he says to zedekiah thus saith the lord
[1:34:00] the god of host
[1:34:01] the god of israel
[1:34:03] notice
[1:34:04] who's speaking
[1:34:08] are you with me
[1:34:10] thus saith the lord
[1:34:12] the god of hosts
[1:34:16] not host
[1:34:17] hosts
[1:34:18] earthly
[1:34:20] and heavenly
[1:34:22] amen
[1:34:23] when jacob was coming back to bethel
[1:34:27] what did he call he he comes into that
[1:34:29] place he calls it man em which is what
[1:34:32] the cap of two hosts
[1:34:35] what host was it the earthly host and
[1:34:38] there's a heavenly host
[1:34:41] there is an earthly host he is god we
[1:34:44] might look right through here god might
[1:34:46] have a handful ten now i trust it's
[1:34:48] everybody in here that god can sow our
[1:34:51] lives or so surrender that he could work
[1:34:53] through but remember it's not our hands
[1:34:56] doing it it's him working through his
[1:34:58] body but we are not alone
[1:35:00] we are encamped about by angels
[1:35:06] he's the god of hosts
[1:35:08] he's letting jeremiah know that all the
[1:35:11] angels
[1:35:14] the anointings they come with the word
[1:35:18] there's protection in the word
[1:35:22] there's defense security peace
[1:35:26] life in the word
[1:35:29] the god of hosts the god of israel
[1:35:32] look at this
[1:35:34] if thou wilt assuredly
[1:35:36] go forth
[1:35:38] unto the king of babylon's princes this
[1:35:42] is what they were calling treason
[1:35:45] yes as israel
[1:35:48] we want us to go out to babylon
[1:35:51] out to the king who's here
[1:35:56] see what zedekiah and many were wanting
[1:35:59] they wanted because what they had saw
[1:36:01] the chaldeans babylonians had come up
[1:36:03] and encamped around the city
[1:36:05] this is just a chapter even before that
[1:36:08] and the egyptians had come up
[1:36:11] and jehovah
[1:36:12] was king
[1:36:14] and the egyptians were able to put
[1:36:16] pressure on the chaldeans and cause the
[1:36:19] chaldeans babylonians to flee
[1:36:24] you know it's just like when somebody
[1:36:25] sometimes can get into a hot thick mess
[1:36:30] oh lord i need you
[1:36:32] oh lord i need you
[1:36:34] brother say i know i need you
[1:36:36] oh i need this
[1:36:39] but the reality of it is they don't want
[1:36:41] god
[1:36:44] they want their mess fixed
[1:36:47] y'all gonna preach with me now
[1:36:49] but you recognize if you never get what
[1:36:52] it is on the inside corrected you'll be
[1:36:55] in another mess
[1:36:59] because it's this guy on the inside that
[1:37:01] needs to be lined up
[1:37:05] when you really received a message
[1:37:08] it straightens out what's been a mess
[1:37:13] are you with me
[1:37:15] but you see they would look at it as
[1:37:17] though why in the world should we go out
[1:37:19] to babylon this is what they were
[1:37:21] calling teresa
[1:37:22] you're against us no no no
[1:37:24] god let them know
[1:37:26] even if all the chaldeans were wounded
[1:37:28] this is what he said in the word even if
[1:37:30] all the babylonians were wounded
[1:37:32] they would be back here again
[1:37:34] how
[1:37:35] god already said judgment is coming from
[1:37:39] that nation
[1:37:42] and they came back
[1:37:46] they came back now here is the mercy of
[1:37:47] god
[1:37:49] that would actually express them
[1:37:50] zedekiah's got a choice remember he's a
[1:37:53] leader
[1:37:54] right
[1:37:55] you hear me daddy
[1:37:57] husband
[1:37:58] he's a leader
[1:38:02] a leader
[1:38:03] it's time to lead
[1:38:06] leadership is not something it's many
[1:38:08] things what people want but in this day
[1:38:10] and age leadership is what they once
[1:38:12] handed to them
[1:38:13] i mean they just graduated kindergarten
[1:38:15] and they want to be part of they want to
[1:38:16] be a ceo right
[1:38:18] just makes sense right
[1:38:20] i mean you know i just started working
[1:38:22] you know wendy's how to be the boss here
[1:38:26] aren't you glad that we've grown up a
[1:38:28] little bit
[1:38:31] the older you get the more you want to
[1:38:32] try to say i don't want that
[1:38:33] responsibility i don't want the
[1:38:35] responsibility because every decision
[1:38:37] itself there's a lot of things that's
[1:38:39] tied to it
[1:38:40] you start watching the footsteps you
[1:38:42] take of how everything is tied to it a
[1:38:44] little bit more closely
[1:38:46] well that was free
[1:38:49] you won't get that from dr dobson but it
[1:38:50] will come from the word of god
[1:38:52] if thou will assuredly go forth unto the
[1:38:55] king of babylon's princes then thy soul
[1:38:59] shall live
[1:39:01] and this city shall not be burned with
[1:39:04] fire and thou shalt live in thine house
[1:39:07] but if thou will not go forth to the
[1:39:09] king of babylon's princes
[1:39:11] then shall this city be given into the
[1:39:13] hand of the chaldeans and they shall
[1:39:14] burn it with fire and thou shalt not
[1:39:16] escape out of their hand
[1:39:18] what's he asking zedekai to do
[1:39:21] put your life
[1:39:23] into the hands of the word
[1:39:26] and go out
[1:39:28] amen to the king of babylon
[1:39:32] remember where all this plays in
[1:39:34] judgment is coming
[1:39:36] do you want an escape that's right do
[1:39:38] you want mercy
[1:39:41] see this is god's mercy his voice is
[1:39:44] telling them put your life
[1:39:47] take your life and put it
[1:39:51] into the hands of god
[1:39:53] in his word
[1:39:56] what zedekiah's response
[1:39:59] zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah
[1:40:02] i am afraid
[1:40:05] of
[1:40:07] the
[1:40:08] jews
[1:40:10] the jews
[1:40:13] you're not afraid of the chaldeans
[1:40:16] he's more afraid
[1:40:18] of the jews
[1:40:20] than he is the chaldeans
[1:40:24] that i'm more afraid of the jews i'm
[1:40:26] afraid of the jews that are falling to
[1:40:27] the chaldeans lest they deliver me into
[1:40:30] their hand
[1:40:31] and they mock me
[1:40:35] isn't this just how the devil wants to
[1:40:37] paint
[1:40:38] what a real surrendered life is
[1:40:41] you're a weakling
[1:40:44] you're weak
[1:40:46] as far as in my life i'm as weak as we
[1:40:49] can be
[1:40:51] you might have all the muscles in the
[1:40:52] world you might be as big as goliath you
[1:40:55] might have legs that look like pillars
[1:40:57] you might have such a personality but
[1:41:00] let me tell you something you're no
[1:41:01] match for the
[1:41:02] devil flesh and blood cannot defeat
[1:41:06] satan
[1:41:08] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[1:41:11] kingdom of god
[1:41:12] we're talking about spiritual powers
[1:41:15] that have been in conflict since it was
[1:41:18] back there in heaven and let me tell you
[1:41:20] something the devil didn't win in heaven
[1:41:23] he got kicked out
[1:41:26] he led aside by rebellion he told a tale
[1:41:33] a lie and he drew a third part of the
[1:41:36] angels
[1:41:38] is that right
[1:41:40] that's true
[1:41:41] this conflict has been going on down
[1:41:44] through time there's only one thing that
[1:41:45] can overcome that spiritual power it's
[1:41:47] got to be a greater spiritual power
[1:41:49] there's only one that can then overcome
[1:41:52] one who's strong that's a stronger one
[1:41:53] come on the scene
[1:41:58] i'm afraid of the jews isn't that the
[1:42:00] case of where many would say well if i
[1:42:03] do this you know my husband will leave
[1:42:04] me or my wife will leave me or what
[1:42:06] about brother so what about so and so
[1:42:08] what will my friends think what will
[1:42:10] this you see it's never about people way
[1:42:12] out there
[1:42:13] it's fear
[1:42:14] about what will so and so think
[1:42:17] it's quite simple either you want to
[1:42:20] surrender your life and dwell with god
[1:42:22] or you're desiring to go to
[1:42:27] all hell
[1:42:28] maybe jesus put a little bit of
[1:42:29] sweetener on that before you help you
[1:42:30] get it down it's quite simple
[1:42:33] you what what it is that you value what
[1:42:36] it is you value and you hold on to it
[1:42:38] where will it lead
[1:42:40] you amen it'll either bring your soul
[1:42:44] into the presence of god or it'll
[1:42:46] continue to harden your heart and harden
[1:42:49] it and harden it and harden it because
[1:42:51] you are afraid
[1:42:54] what will they say
[1:43:01] if you're going to stand on god's word
[1:43:04] god's going to back up his word amen
[1:43:07] i said god will back up his word
[1:43:09] god himself will come and stand inside
[1:43:12] of you
[1:43:13] there's not no doubt one person in here
[1:43:16] that's already experienced this sure
[1:43:18] when god got a hold of my life that
[1:43:19] friends try to call friends tried to
[1:43:21] come around hey why don't you come on
[1:43:23] out to the bar with us why don't you
[1:43:24] come on out i said i don't go them
[1:43:26] places no more well why and why not
[1:43:28] you're afraid are you afraid i said no i
[1:43:31] said they're somewhere i don't know
[1:43:32] where it's at in the word but there's
[1:43:33] somewhere in the word that said how can
[1:43:35] two or three that how can two or three
[1:43:38] agree and walk together how can they
[1:43:41] accept they agree and i said something
[1:43:44] has happened inside of my life that
[1:43:46] cannot agree nor does it desire those
[1:43:49] things
[1:43:51] well you can just drink a coke or pepsi
[1:43:56] just want to make sure they wouldn't
[1:43:57] offend me coke or pepsi
[1:44:00] i said i don't want to be in them places
[1:44:05] i have no desire for them
[1:44:07] you see what i'm talking about the
[1:44:09] gospel is not self-reform if it was
[1:44:11] self-reform every church would have a
[1:44:14] down path people would have it down path
[1:44:16] this is not a come in a craft session
[1:44:19] where you make yourself a christian this
[1:44:22] is where you come and you lay your life
[1:44:25] on the altar of god and god takes that
[1:44:27] old nature out of you and he places that

[1:46:12] false prophets pat you on the back and
[1:46:15] when they speak powdered sugar flies out
[1:46:17] of their mouth
[1:46:18] but a true prophet is come and is armed
[1:46:21] with the sword of the lord and brother

[1:46:51] family it wasn't you know like i had to
[1:46:52] go back and face something strange or

[1:47:01] they knew the sam that had walked out on
[1:47:03] that friday
[1:47:04] they had walked with on that shift

[1:47:10] it was a different one
[1:47:16] there was a one that walked in i'm
[1:47:17] ashamed of this but i'll say it for to
[1:47:19] show how god works by his power
[1:47:22] i said god i need you to change my
[1:47:24] language
[1:47:25] i can't even control my language i've
[1:47:28] got so far within that god i need you i
[1:47:30] need your help
[1:47:32] let me just tell you something
[1:47:34] that right there even when that was
[1:47:35] prayed when god had got a whole my life
[1:47:37] there was many things of how god just
[1:47:39] just took right from my life but i never
[1:47:41] forget when i walked up on that factory
[1:47:43] floor it got up there on the second
[1:47:45] second or third floor i got ready to
[1:47:46] walk out there for the shift and the
[1:47:48] spirit of god he spoke to my heart he
[1:47:50] said i want you to notice i've changed
[1:47:52] your language
[1:47:55] hallelujah
[1:47:57] glory be to god he changed it it wasn't
[1:47:59] what i did it wasn't reform i've saved
[1:48:02] this so many times say this so many
[1:48:04] times say this so many times it's not a
[1:48:07] work of flesh and blood i'm talking
[1:48:10] about a supernatural god
[1:48:16] if you don't get nothing else out of
[1:48:17] this service it's nothing more than a
[1:48:20] supernatural god and you must meet that
[1:48:24] god
[1:48:28] when you meet him
[1:48:29] you won't be worried about who mocks you
[1:48:33] let me preach why i'm on it
[1:48:35] the reason the devil wants to try to
[1:48:37] hang that out and it'll come right to
[1:48:38] your mind right now what happens if you
[1:48:41] make a move what happens to that wife
[1:48:43] what happens to that husband what
[1:48:45] happens to your friends what are they
[1:48:46] going to say you know he's trying to do
[1:48:48] he's trying to bluff you
[1:48:51] amen he's trying to intimidate you
[1:48:54] he's just doing what galactic to david
[1:48:57] you aren't but a ruddy youth they sent
[1:48:59] you out here
[1:49:00] you ain't even fit for the dogs he was
[1:49:02] trying to get him and hinder him but
[1:49:05] david had received a word
[1:49:10] david received a word that was bigger
[1:49:13] than goliath
[1:49:15] we've received a word that's bigger than
[1:49:18] any devil out of hell
[1:49:21] we've received a word that's greater
[1:49:26] the devil wants to try to mock
[1:49:29] and try to run down
[1:49:30] i say you ought to stand
[1:49:33] in the very move
[1:49:34] in the very rushing wind of the holy
[1:49:37] ghost and let him breathe
[1:49:40] a breath of courage a breath of reality
[1:49:44] a breath of transformation from the
[1:49:46] supernatural god
[1:49:48] [Applause]
[1:49:51] [Music]
[1:49:56] hallelujah
[1:49:58] thank you lord
[1:50:00] bless the
[1:50:05] lord hallelujah
[1:50:10] jeremiah said
[1:50:13] verse 20
[1:50:16] they shall not deliver thee
[1:50:20] that should have been it right there
[1:50:26] amen
[1:50:27] but if you're looking at jeremiah
[1:50:29] it's just a man
[1:50:31] then you question it
[1:50:34] he was a man
[1:50:37] it's true
[1:50:39] he got ready just like any other man
[1:50:40] would get ready
[1:50:44] fought sickness
[1:50:46] got weary got tired
[1:50:48] but he was god's prophet
[1:50:52] he was god's spokesman
[1:50:54] with god's
[1:50:56] message
[1:50:59] look what he says
[1:51:01] obey
[1:51:02] i beseech thee
[1:51:04] the voice of the lord
[1:51:07] which i speak unto thee
[1:51:09] so
[1:51:10] it shall be well
[1:51:12] unto thee
[1:51:14] and thy soul
[1:51:16] shall live notice
[1:51:18] is this not the gospel
[1:51:21] i'm the lord that
[1:51:23] forgiveth
[1:51:25] all thine iniquities deals with your
[1:51:27] soul first
[1:51:28] and healeth all thy diseases
[1:51:32] it's an inward work that starts
[1:51:34] a transformation
[1:51:35] and it leads to a transformation out
[1:51:37] here amen
[1:51:39] it's a change that's going on
[1:51:41] and you find that change once that
[1:51:43] change even how god is dealing of
[1:51:45] dealing and drawing a life to himself
[1:51:46] there's a change going on
[1:51:49] you might sit and say well brother
[1:51:50] samuel i know i've not received the holy
[1:51:52] ghost yet but you know there's a change
[1:51:53] going on in your life
[1:51:55] god is moving sovereignly on your life
[1:51:58] like he did on the earth at the
[1:52:00] beginning the earth was meant to be
[1:52:02] around the s-u-n but it took the esso in
[1:52:06] to bring the earth around the s-u-n it
[1:52:08] has taken the holy ghost to move and
[1:52:11] bring you and i into position in himself
[1:52:14] in the word and as we will yield to it
[1:52:17] oh we might start out like a big old as
[1:52:19] brother ram described it a clinker
[1:52:21] clunker of ice that is way out there it
[1:52:24] doesn't look like anything at all but as
[1:52:26] it begins to come around that of the sun
[1:52:29] and it's brought into position oh
[1:52:31] there's still darkness there's still
[1:52:33] chaos there's all types of voidness
[1:52:35] that's about that but if it'll stay
[1:52:37] right there the voice of god that has
[1:52:40] brought it there in position as it
[1:52:42] yielded to it it will begin to work on
[1:52:45] that life and the seeds that it's
[1:52:47] already planted there by his word it
[1:52:49] will actually cause those seeds to come
[1:52:52] out in its ordained season
[1:52:56] it's true your whole life is not going
[1:52:58] to be a garden of eden
[1:53:00] but your soul will be
[1:53:02] amen
[1:53:02] [Applause]
[1:53:04] because it's in the soul that god chose
[1:53:07] to put his headquarters
[1:53:09] it's in the garden of eden where he
[1:53:11] chose to put the union of his son and
[1:53:15] his son's bride
[1:53:16] are you with me this is why the outer
[1:53:18] two parts of our life there's got to be
[1:53:21] the headquarters the headship of the
[1:53:23] word on the inside the garden of eden
[1:53:26] then it will control
[1:53:28] the rest
[1:53:32] y'all with me amen
[1:53:37] praise the lord
[1:53:39] let me read these scriptures here
[1:53:41] out of mark 8 verse 34.
[1:54:02] and when he had called the people unto
[1:54:03] him with his disciples also
[1:54:06] he said unto them
[1:54:07] whosoever will come after me
[1:54:10] let him
[1:54:12] deny
[1:54:13] himself
[1:54:16] so jesus will never come around and pick
[1:54:19] you up by your shirt color
[1:54:21] call her however you want to say it
[1:54:24] he we don't come around and do it
[1:54:27] but he brings us to a place to where
[1:54:30] we
[1:54:32] will let ourself down
[1:54:35] now you might say glory to god brother
[1:54:37] samuel i've already denied myself i've
[1:54:40] been born again of the spirit of god
[1:54:41] wonderful
[1:54:43] that's daily though
[1:54:47] bear his cross
[1:54:48] daily
[1:54:53] oh i know if you could have had the
[1:54:54] perfect wife she'd have been everything
[1:54:57] that you wanted
[1:54:58] but god didn't give you what you wanted
[1:55:01] he gave you what you needed
[1:55:03] oh the perfect husband would have been
[1:55:05] and i understand friends you you please
[1:55:06] take this with a grain of salt oh it
[1:55:08] would have been this and that but god
[1:55:10] has placed just exactly what we needed
[1:55:15] you want some quotes for this
[1:55:17] they're not here but i can give them to
[1:55:18] you
[1:55:20] god gave moses what he needed
[1:55:23] [Music]
[1:55:25] he gave him zappora
[1:55:27] brother brown says i'd say that the
[1:55:28] desert wasn't big enough for him
[1:55:30] sometimes
[1:55:34] now don't sit there and look at me like
[1:55:35] oh my our ideas they always just mesh i
[1:55:39] mean it's just like if i set a fourth of
[1:55:41] a cup of flour and there's a half a cup
[1:55:43] needed she's the other fourth and it
[1:55:45] just comes around
[1:55:50] brother brahman said how do you know he
[1:55:52] said that high tempered wife ain't your
[1:55:53] cross that you've got a bear
[1:55:57] or that ocd husband
[1:56:01] preached brother samuel
[1:56:02] hey i'm preaching amen
[1:56:06] i'm talking about denying ourselves
[1:56:07] because you see sometimes people only
[1:56:09] look at this tonight self and my getting
[1:56:12] after this and getting after this but
[1:56:13] you ought to also remember there's a
[1:56:15] life to live every single day
[1:56:21] whosoever will come after me let him
[1:56:23] deny himself and take up his cross and
[1:56:26] follow me for whosoever will save his
[1:56:28] life
[1:56:29] shall lose it
[1:56:31] but whosoever shall lose his life give
[1:56:33] it
[1:56:34] for my sake and the gospels
[1:56:38] not for the church
[1:56:39] for his sake
[1:56:42] for his sake
[1:56:44] well i stopped wearing pants because the
[1:56:46] church preaches on i'm glad you did that
[1:56:49] i'm so glad you did that i stopped
[1:56:51] wearing makeup or or brothers you
[1:56:53] stopped wearing them britches i'm
[1:56:54] so glad you did that
[1:56:56] i'm glad you took the earrings out i'm
[1:56:58] glad you got rid of them high heels that
[1:57:00] make you seem about seven foot when
[1:57:02] you're only five foot two i'm glad for
[1:57:04] all that i'm glad brothers that you got
[1:57:06] rid of them tight britches that
[1:57:08] homosexuals make i'm glad for that but
[1:57:10] it goes a little bit deeper than that
[1:57:16] maybe i'll preach from down here the
[1:57:17] rest of time
[1:57:19] [Applause]
[1:57:22] not for the church's sake
[1:57:24] well my church says that i have to have
[1:57:26] long hair that's not what the the church
[1:57:28] stands on the word the word says this
[1:57:32] [Music]
[1:57:34] that's right
[1:57:35] when they women got to act when israel
[1:57:37] got to act in rebels this is a scripture
[1:57:39] in the book of jeremiah when they begin
[1:57:40] to act rebellious god told them all
[1:57:43] daughter of jerusalem cut off your hair
[1:57:46] you mean god believes in cutting hair no
[1:57:48] he's letting them know
[1:57:50] that that hair being cut it shows you're
[1:57:52] not under headshift that's right
[1:57:57] the bible says when you really receive
[1:57:59] the message you got power on your head
[1:58:02] are you with me
[1:58:04] well how long is it you know i just
[1:58:06] trimmed the dead ends now you know
[1:58:07] that's the dumbest argument in the world
[1:58:09] your hair don't grow from the ends it
[1:58:10] grows from your roots
[1:58:15] come on somebody
[1:58:17] while just trim the ends and it'll make
[1:58:19] it grow more
[1:58:24] long hair is uncut hair
[1:58:28] there might be a sister that her hair
[1:58:30] maybe because of age or maybe some other
[1:58:32] condition it ain't able to grow more
[1:58:34] than just down right there but it's
[1:58:36] uncut hair and that is her glory in the
[1:58:39] eyes of god
[1:58:43] but brother samuel but jeremiah we're
[1:58:45] standing in the third entry of the house
[1:58:48] of the lord
[1:58:50] shouldn't we be reverent we should we
[1:58:52] should want to reverence his word
[1:58:54] we should want to reverence the holy
[1:58:55] ghost that's speaking to us that's
[1:58:57] dealing with our life
[1:59:00] that's what we should want to reverence
[1:59:01] whether we're in the house of god or not
[1:59:03] if you act outside different than you
[1:59:06] present yourself in here you're a
[1:59:07] hypocrite
[1:59:10] you're not a genuine christian the way
[1:59:13] that you act out there and you come in
[1:59:15] here and act different and put on a show
[1:59:17] you're a hypocrite but there's a god of
[1:59:19] reality that can make you a real
[1:59:22] christian inside of here it'll make you
[1:59:24] a real christian out there why he'll
[1:59:27] give you a real holy ghost experience on
[1:59:31] the inside that'll make you a real
[1:59:33] christian

[2:00:15] sometimes some of you i don't see you
[2:00:17] for months at a time
[2:00:19] and then you pop back in
[2:00:22] i don't know if you're m.i.a missing in
[2:00:23] action or where you're at oh lord jesus
[2:00:27] it's time to be a christian every single
[2:00:29] day
[2:00:30] it's time to let the devil know whose
[2:00:33] sounds you're wrong
[2:00:35] it's time for you to take a stand in the
[2:00:38] word of god stop letting your friends
[2:00:41] and your family and whoever more if they
[2:00:43] want to go that way let them go
[2:00:46] but you've got to call across jordan

[2:01:10] pentecostal churches and whatever more
[2:01:12] that catholic spirit still here in this
[2:01:15] city
[2:01:17] and don't you act like a roman catholic

[2:01:22] ghost is the holy ghost

[2:01:28] free
[2:01:30] god can use your life to just as much as
[2:01:33] he can use mine
[2:01:35] [Music]
[2:01:36] i believe we ought to be respectful to
[2:01:38] the servants of god and the gifts of god
[2:01:41] but i don't believe that god is bankrupt
[2:01:44] i believe that just as much as we see
[2:01:48] hell that is all around us the heaven
[2:01:51] itself has come down
[2:01:55] let me tell you something little sister
[2:01:58] you can stand on that word and you've
[2:02:00] got jesus christ backing up that prayer
[2:02:04] [Music]
[2:02:06] your little one gets sick you've got an
[2:02:08] authority to stand there on the word of
[2:02:10] god instead i take my token and satan
[2:02:14] take your hands off
[2:02:18] [Applause]
[2:02:21] these aren't photo-op moments
[2:02:23] but these are moments that says this
[2:02:25] crown belongs to me
[2:02:33] for what shall it profit a man
[2:02:35] if he shall gain the whole world
[2:02:38] and lose his own soul

[2:02:56] that's
[2:02:57] whatever
[2:02:59] one of these this or whatever more
[2:03:06] it's not the size of your house
[2:03:09] it's not how much earthly goods you've
[2:03:10] got
[2:03:12] it's how content you are with what god
[2:03:14] has given you
[2:03:16] amen
[2:03:20] this thing right here is materially
[2:03:22] minded
[2:03:25] i notice people say they ain't
[2:03:26] materially minded but
[2:03:28] i'm not going to preach there but we're
[2:03:29] going to go

[2:03:39] she wanted something
[2:03:41] that was out there that was alluring her
[2:03:48] i know there's some things god don't
[2:03:49] have to tell you
[2:03:50] don't do it hey
[2:03:52] hey come over here don't do it you know
[2:03:54] you can't write that out of your
[2:03:54] checking account you know you got to pay
[2:03:56] you know your ties you got that and you
[2:03:58] know you're offering that's what you
[2:03:59] give them you are you know hey hey you
[2:04:01] know you can't do that connie will come
[2:04:02] down and do that
[2:04:04] but if you don't honor his word
[2:04:07] he'll let you know
[2:04:08] that you've taken something that belongs
[2:04:10] to him
[2:04:10] and you've taken it other places
[2:04:17] god ain't going to come down and do that
[2:04:18] for us
[2:04:20] we've got to do that
[2:04:22] we've got to do that in honor to his
[2:04:23] word
[2:04:26] can i have just a few more minutes
[2:04:28] i didn't see how many minutes they were
[2:04:29] i said a few more
[2:04:34] some of you are like man
[2:04:39] what shall they prophet a man if he
[2:04:41] shall gain the whole world
[2:04:43] and lose his own soul
[2:04:46] that's the truth amen
[2:04:50] i can't help but think of a song brother
[2:04:52] bill i'd rather
[2:04:54] have jesus
[2:04:55] hallelujah
[2:04:56] brother greg that's uh i'd rather have
[2:04:58] jesus
[2:04:59] than silver or gold
[2:05:02] it's not saying that that god is against
[2:05:04] you having a you know a nice house or a
[2:05:07] good job anyone is saying that's not all
[2:05:09] we're saying you know what god has all
[2:05:12] of those things but the point that god
[2:05:14] lets us know is
[2:05:15] the order
[2:05:17] is always him first
[2:05:20] that's true god has people who are
[2:05:22] wealthy so that he can point out to
[2:05:24] others who would not submit themselves
[2:05:27] to god and say look i've got people who
[2:05:30] are just as wealthy as you
[2:05:31] and they submit surrender their life to
[2:05:34] me
[2:05:37] whether you can receive it or not always
[2:05:38] think of that little sister who was in
[2:05:40] the wheelchair but the ram talks about
[2:05:41] it
[2:05:42] talks about empowered transformation
[2:05:44] and there's power transformation or
[2:05:46] god's power to transform whichever one
[2:05:47] is in the trailer park then brother
[2:05:48] brown comes around and preaches the
[2:05:50] first service on the oddball he talks
[2:05:52] about it again this little sister he's
[2:05:54] they've prayed for her so many times
[2:05:56] she's in a wheelchair
[2:05:58] but yet brother bran points out one
[2:05:59] thing about her
[2:06:00] he said she's got such a beautiful
[2:06:04] character and a sweet spirit
[2:06:07] he said i i don't understand why god
[2:06:08] hasn't healed her see the prophet didn't
[2:06:10] have the power to heal the people but he
[2:06:12] was god's agent right to pray
[2:06:15] the prayer of faith
[2:06:18] and god came down and did the work
[2:06:20] that was to build confidence for you and
[2:06:22] i yeah
[2:06:23] that god stands behind his word
[2:06:26] it will stand upon his word
[2:06:29] but think about it
[2:06:31] there could be people that say lord i
[2:06:33] would have served you
[2:06:34] but you never brought me out of this
[2:06:36] wheelchair
[2:06:38] and think about it on that day he'll say
[2:06:41] come here she won't be rolling up there
[2:06:42] in a wheelchair
[2:06:44] there won't be somebody pushing her
[2:06:49] but my he won't even nothing have to be
[2:06:52] said
[2:06:53] his daughter
[2:06:54] the testimony
[2:06:56] of her life
[2:06:57] she lived a life of victory
[2:07:00] though she was in a wheelchair
[2:07:03] she was free
[2:07:07] freedom isn't that you've got all your
[2:07:08] bills paid and everything is just right
[2:07:11] my four on 401k boy this is rising and
[2:07:13] this is rising those things make this
[2:07:15] guy feel good
[2:07:19] but it's where you've got real
[2:07:22] freedom right here
[2:07:24] that's real peace because when things
[2:07:26] get tight you've got to have ground to
[2:07:28] stand on
[2:07:30] when things aren't going just right and
[2:07:32] the doctor says
[2:07:34] you won't make it till december you've
[2:07:35] got to have some ground to stand on to
[2:07:37] say amen
[2:07:38] i know in whom i have believed
[2:07:41] you've got to have ground to stand on to
[2:07:42] say the devil cannot take me till god's
[2:07:45] finished with me
[2:07:46] and god hasn't told me that he's
[2:07:48] finished with me so i'm going to stand
[2:07:50] on his word and i'm calling you a liar
[2:07:55] that's all right that's the truth
[2:07:56] brother and sister
[2:08:01] or what shall a man give
[2:08:03] in exchange
[2:08:05] for his
[2:08:06] soul whosoever therefore
[2:08:10] shall be ashamed of me
[2:08:13] and of my words
[2:08:15] in this adulterous and sinful generation
[2:08:18] of him also
[2:08:20] shall the son of man be ashamed
[2:08:23] when he cometh
[2:08:24] in the glory
[2:08:26] of his father
[2:08:28] with the holy angels
[2:08:33] we'll just stop here on
[2:08:35] can't go on
[2:08:42] but this morning when i
[2:08:45] that's scripture
[2:08:47] whoever be ashamed
[2:08:49] of me
[2:08:51] and my words
[2:08:55] in this generation
[2:08:59] i said in this generation
[2:09:05] people can take the words
[2:09:07] that were given to a previous generation
[2:09:12] and it was
[2:09:13] part of god's
[2:09:15] working
[2:09:16] are you with me
[2:09:18] it's like a house
[2:09:22] you buy the property
[2:09:26] then
[2:09:27] they got to dig it out and pour the
[2:09:29] walls
[2:09:32] for the basement
[2:09:33] crawl space whatever you're going to do
[2:09:36] that's all a start
[2:09:41] but i don't think no one in here
[2:09:44] i think i pretty much know maybe i ain't
[2:09:46] been to everybody's house
[2:09:48] but i i'm pretty sure
[2:09:50] that no one in here
[2:09:51] is just living
[2:09:53] in walls that are put up for a basement
[2:09:56] with nothing over you
[2:09:59] i'm pretty sure of that
[2:10:05] he said brother sam what are you saying
[2:10:08] people can look back
[2:10:10] to a previous time and say
[2:10:12] well i i accept the lord jesus christ as
[2:10:16] my lord and savior that's a wonderful
[2:10:17] start
[2:10:18] that's let me just tell you
[2:10:21] god bless you
[2:10:24] i repent and you ought to repent
[2:10:27] and let me just tell you repent doesn't
[2:10:28] mean well you know that ain't really
[2:10:31] like me
[2:10:33] that's like trying to smear cream cheese
[2:10:36] on moldy bread
[2:10:38] repentance gets down and says forgive me
[2:10:42] lord i'm sorry i'm wrong
[2:10:46] that's real repentance
[2:10:53] that's a secret
[2:10:55] many people don't get what they come
[2:10:57] asking for because they don't really
[2:10:59] repent
[2:11:02] well you know how hard i have it god you
[2:11:03] know how that ain't repentance
[2:11:06] you're wanting god to feel sorry for you
[2:11:08] that's what zedekiah wanted
[2:11:11] zedekiah was hoping that he could being
[2:11:13] there in that third entry of the house
[2:11:15] of the lord
[2:11:16] that jeremiah would feel sorry for him
[2:11:18] jeremiah would be your move beyond his
[2:11:20] emotions you think it wasn't an
[2:11:21] emotional moment very emotional moment i
[2:11:23] mean we're standing in the house of the
[2:11:24] lord we're standing in a place very
[2:11:26] close to where when a man walked in
[2:11:28] there if he did not walk in the high
[2:11:30] priest if he did not walk in and his
[2:11:32] life was was under the blood and this is
[2:11:34] why they they had to tie that that cord
[2:11:37] they pull them out because they died in
[2:11:39] the presence of god
[2:11:42] i can't remember the statistic you gave
[2:11:43] me the one time brother bill where it
[2:11:44] actually goes back into it how many
[2:11:46] hundreds died between certain high
[2:11:48] priests you know why they took it
[2:11:50] lightly
[2:11:51] they're just walking in just took it
[2:11:52] casually and they died when they got
[2:11:54] there
[2:11:57] very reference place
[2:12:03] but it's going to take more than you
[2:12:04] just taken your shoes off
[2:12:07] moses took his shoes off
[2:12:11] but it takes you laying down your life
[2:12:16] and i ask you
[2:12:18] is he worth it
[2:12:21] i can't determine that for you i know
[2:12:23] how i know what has come to me
[2:12:26] but i can't decide that that's you
[2:12:28] you see now is jesus christ on your
[2:12:32] hands
[2:12:34] what will you do with him
[2:12:37] many can look back into a previous
[2:12:39] generation
[2:12:41] they look back into the time even of
[2:12:43] wesley oh
[2:12:45] well i don't smoke no more i i don't run
[2:12:47] around with women i don't smoke pot no
[2:12:49] more i don't sniff crack i don't i don't
[2:12:52] look at pornography no more i don't do
[2:12:54] this and i don't do that those are one
[2:12:56] thank god
[2:12:57] thank god for a cleaned up sanctified
[2:12:59] life
[2:13:01] but you've got to go
[2:13:03] deeper
[2:13:06] how deep
[2:13:10] to where you become like this jacket
[2:13:12] a shell
[2:13:15] that he can put on
[2:13:16] [Music]
[2:13:19] and when you go walk on the job
[2:13:21] they see you
[2:13:23] but it's who's inside you yeah
[2:13:26] who's inside you the same god who called
[2:13:29] me cleanse me fill me amen
[2:13:33] amen
[2:13:35] the reality is isn't well i don't do
[2:13:37] this no more i don't it's your life has
[2:13:40] been changed
[2:13:42] god has revealed his word
[2:13:45] to you
[2:13:47] in you all right and he's living through
[2:13:49] you
[2:13:51] amen
[2:13:52] it's where this message
[2:13:54] is not a movement that's right it's not
[2:13:57] an idea
[2:13:58] it's not what it's not what grandpa
[2:14:00] believes or grandma believes
[2:14:05] it's not what dad believes it's not what
[2:14:07] mom believes it's not what brother
[2:14:08] believes it's not what sister believes
[2:14:11] is what i believe
[2:14:16] and i believe it more
[2:14:19] than anything else
[2:14:24] it has unfolded the mystery of my life
[2:14:30] this
[2:14:31] reality of this word
[2:14:33] will break babylon from your life
[2:14:38] babylon is confusion
[2:14:42] it will break confusion
[2:14:45] from around your life
[2:14:46] what does that delight
[2:14:48] will you walk in that light
[2:14:50] whosoever will be ashamed of me
[2:14:53] and my words
[2:14:54] in this generation
[2:14:56] god's not going to judge you by a
[2:14:57] previous generation
[2:14:59] by a previous message you'll be judged
[2:15:02] by this word
[2:15:05] as you come and here you are you'll be
[2:15:07] judged by this word
[2:15:09] but i say within that can you hear
[2:15:12] there is a certainty of judgment but can
[2:15:14] you hear the certainty of god's mercy
[2:15:17] that says come unto me
[2:15:19] oh you will give you saboth for your
[2:15:22] soul
[2:15:24] if you can hear the voice of god
[2:15:26] you can hear the voice
[2:15:29] of mercy
[2:15:32] who was jeremiah
[2:15:33] god's voice
[2:15:35] to zedekiah
[2:15:38] in order for zedekiah to serve god he
[2:15:41] had to accept jeremiah
[2:15:45] i don't have time for that this morning
[2:15:48] but he had to recognize this is god's
[2:15:50] voice
[2:15:51] this is god's instrument
[2:15:54] while there's mercy
[2:15:56] i say god
[2:15:59] i want to walk in that mercy amen
[2:16:04] you don't have another day promised you
[2:16:06] don't have another moment promised i
[2:16:08] don't nobody does this might be the last
[2:16:10] sermon i'll ever minister i don't know i
[2:16:13] don't have the promise of this evening i
[2:16:15] don't have the promise of tomorrow
[2:16:19] brother samuel what would what would it
[2:16:21] be if god took you off the scene well if
[2:16:23] god's the one who brought me on the
[2:16:25] scene and brought me here then that same
[2:16:26] god will raise up a man to take and
[2:16:28] carry it on
[2:16:31] it's god's work
[2:16:33] it's god's work
[2:16:36] but the reality is is that not one has a
[2:16:39] promise
[2:16:41] of tomorrow
[2:16:45] if you find yourself like zedekiah this
[2:16:47] morning
[2:16:49] don't harden your heart
[2:16:51] right don't just don't say shh
[2:16:56] don't tell nobody
[2:16:58] shh
[2:17:03] zedekiah has told jeremiah
[2:17:06] when the princes come and ask you
[2:17:09] if we talk together
[2:17:11] don't tell
[2:17:14] i want this to be quiet
[2:17:23] why is that a car i'm afraid they'll
[2:17:26] mock me
[2:17:34] whosoever will be ashamed of me
[2:17:37] and my words in this generation
[2:17:39] he said
[2:17:40] so will i be ashamed of you
[2:17:43] when i come his coming is certain
[2:17:48] will you be ashamed
[2:17:50] or will you be one who welcomes him
[2:17:54] says come lord jesus
[2:17:57] you see how you'll be then is how you
[2:17:59] are now
[2:18:00] come lord jesus come lord jesus come

[2:18:24] eden from my soul

[2:18:30] in your life
[2:18:34] let's pray
[2:18:39] lord jesus
[2:18:47] lord
[2:18:50] as i told you this morning
[2:18:53] some months ago
[2:18:55] when you led me across this lord
[2:18:59] i never had this laid out this was not
[2:19:01] anything that
[2:19:02] jumped out to me at that time as far as
[2:19:06] what is spoken in here
[2:19:08] i told you this morning
[2:19:11] i'm glad you kept it from me
[2:19:14] and pushed it back
[2:19:18] lord in myself
[2:19:19] these are
[2:19:22] not the type of services or sermons
[2:19:25] things lord that i would want to preach
[2:19:29] no real man of god
[2:19:32] delights
[2:19:36] in preaching
[2:19:38] and bringing things lord that would be
[2:19:41] somewhat hard
[2:19:43] but lord jesus
[2:19:46] from my heart
[2:19:48] i know lord god that your children
[2:19:51] they can tell lord god your spirit has
[2:19:53] delivered it
[2:19:56] you've not meant them harm
[2:19:59] but you've meant to call them
[2:20:02] that they would come to you
[2:20:06] lord there's lives right here this
[2:20:08] morning
[2:20:10] you're calling
[2:20:12] you're calling you've been calling them
[2:20:18] [Music]
[2:20:19] i pray this morning lord
[2:20:22] [Music]
[2:20:23] may you help them see
[2:20:25] the certainty of the word
[2:20:28] that would lift them
[2:20:30] above fear
[2:20:32] above doubt
[2:20:34] may they see the glory
[2:20:36] of what it means to be identified with
[2:20:38] you
[2:20:40] may that lord sweep into their heart
[2:20:44] lord god i ask right now in the name of
[2:20:46] jesus christ
[2:20:48] that god you would sweep into young
[2:20:50] people's hearts
[2:20:52] sweep into the middle age lord god
[2:20:55] sweeping lord god to the older ones lord
[2:20:58] lord god if there's one lord that's not
[2:21:00] made a complete surrender lord
[2:21:03] i ask lord god here this morning
[2:21:07] may they let down lord
[2:21:09] and obey your voice
[2:21:13] lord god for things that you've been
[2:21:14] dealing with their life on
[2:21:16] you're calling them to it lord
[2:21:19] there's a hunger within their life they
[2:21:20] don't want just a photo op
[2:21:22] they don't want to just be identified
[2:21:25] with a book or tape or a picture
[2:21:27] they don't want to just be identified
[2:21:29] with the church
[2:21:30] they want to be identified with you
[2:21:35] if there's something they can say why
[2:21:37] this i'll tell you grandma or grandpa or
[2:21:39] brother samuel or this or that it ain't
[2:21:41] the person
[2:21:43] if there's anything at all that's good
[2:21:45] in any of us
[2:21:46] it's jesus christ
[2:21:49] he's the one
[2:21:51] he's the one that you want to be
[2:21:52] identified with
[2:21:54] and let me tell you something
[2:21:57] he
[2:21:58] came down
[2:21:59] and identified himself
[2:22:02] with us
[2:22:03] [Music]
[2:22:06] he came down
[2:22:09] he lived
[2:22:10] in a body that was made in the likeness
[2:22:14] of sinful flesh
[2:22:16] experienced
[2:22:18] what frustrations can feel like
[2:22:21] headaches sickness
[2:22:24] to be despised to be rejected
[2:22:28] he knows that feeling
[2:22:30] he knows what it feels like
[2:22:32] to have a black name
[2:22:35] he knows what it feels like
[2:22:37] to be the life of the jokes
[2:22:41] he knows what it's like to be mocked
[2:22:44] beard pulled from his face
[2:22:46] spit on
[2:22:49] why would he do that
[2:22:50] [Music]
[2:22:53] that he might be the perfect offering
[2:22:58] for you and me
[2:22:59] [Music]
[2:23:01] to pay that sin debt
[2:23:05] to show us the greatness of that life
[2:23:08] [Music]
[2:23:10] he would make a way
[2:23:11] before that time before that time
[2:23:14] not one of us
[2:23:16] could die spiritually as far as to lay
[2:23:18] down our life and be born again we

[2:26:54] to king jesus

[2:27:04] spots
[2:27:06] quit trying to straighten up your life

[2:27:13] take control of your life
[2:27:16] you put your life in so many other
[2:27:17] people's hands
[2:27:19] why don't you put your life in his hands
[2:27:22] if you keep it in your hands it'll be no
[2:27:24] more than just a little lad's lunch but
[2:27:26] if you'll put it in his hands he'll
[2:27:28] bring out of your life everything that
[2:27:29] he's packed inside of you
[2:27:33] why don't you let him have the right of
[2:27:34] way
[2:27:35] why don't you cast down imagination
[2:27:39] cast down reasonings
[2:27:43] why don't you call the devil a liar
[2:27:48] say i'm not gonna serve you i'm not
[2:27:50] gonna be your puppet any longer
[2:27:52] i'm responding to the voice of god to
[2:27:55] the voice of mercy
