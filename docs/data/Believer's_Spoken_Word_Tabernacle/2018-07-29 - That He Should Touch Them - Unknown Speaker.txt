========================================

[Music] about three weeks ago I got up early that day and I decided you know usually we go and do other stuff well I decided to put the Lord first and I said I'm going to go pray and spend some time with him I went downstairs and I was talking to him and then I remembered I said Lord I told him about the Michael and I asked him to please we were talking about him going OTR because everywhere he went they won't call them they give him an interview but that was it and my husband said there's no choice I'm gonna have to go well I was telling the Lord of that and I said lord I I wouldn't want my husband to go OTR I said please I said can you please have somebody call them that he could then you can work local here I'm that way you don't have to leave and I I went and heard a message and then I went to do my stuff I went outside of a lot of my friends my husband comes out for his phone I thought he was talking to his aunt and he um after he was done he said I have an interview tomorrow that was like four hours after the prayer and I I just looked at him and stayed quiet I didn't say nothing I was just waiting well the next day he went to the interview when he come back he told me he said well you know what these people treated me like I deserved to be treated they were so nice to me and he said well the guy told me he asked me why was I not working and I told him about my ear

Christ and amen may God bless you the visitors good to have you here with us we've seen everyone aim let's turn in our Bibles if we would to mark chapter 10 let's just if we could let's just look to the Lord before we start reading a man let's just ask him just to he would come and he would be the speaker this morning that's that's what we need we need him to be the speaker and anoint our ears this morning Heavenly Father Lord Jesus how we love you O God how we're just so thankful Lord that you have given us Lord of your own life Lord Oh father how we just appreciate you Lord father we are Lord here assembled together Lord O God according to your word and you said O Lord that where two or three are gathered together in my name there will I be in the midst of them also Lord this is our comfort or God and Lord were depending on you Lord Jesus father where we have come Lord to be gathered in your name in your presence in this life in your word and we're asking that you Lord who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks Oh God that you would just move forth Lord in each one of our lives may you Lord just move Lord God upon us Lord as a congregation of people as speaker and hearer together and father the desires that we would have Lord as we hold them in our hearts Oh God before you Lord in your presence for you alone or God we believe and know that you are the one who brings desires into reality Lord so father we ask this morning that may your same presence Lord the same Spirit of God that moved in the beginning that you would move once again this morning Lord by way of your word Oh God and father may there be atmospheres Oh God that are changed lives that are changed Lord even situations that Lord that we even might be looking at Lord and wondering oh god how but may you come Lord and may we be changed Lord to where we're no longer looking through an eyes of limitation of our own senses but we can see through the eye of God that all things are possible Lord we just ask that you would come Lord and just break the word to our hearts now we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen I'm gonna read a few verses and then we'll let you have your seats I won't keep you out standing the whole time verse one of Mark 10 and he arose from thence come into the coasts of Judea by the farther side of Jordan and the people resort unto him again and he was want he taught them again and the Pharisees came to him and asked him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife tempting him so did they really want to know no they asked him tempting now you look at it and what they were anointed with to even ask a question such as the way that they could place that question you realize there's an anointing that they're under they asked the question tempting him and he answered and said unto them what did Moses command you I love how the Lord turns it around don't you even when they would asking me so well you know what the law says what did Moses command you and they said Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away and jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female and for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunder it shows even in that verse that everything that God has brought together and is according to his word Satan is going to attack that Satan's attack listen now Satan's attack is not against the letters he's not Satan is not an anti word he's Antichrist so he comes against even what God has laid out within his word and so even within this this word that we read here in verse 9 what therefore God has joined together let not man put asunder I say with all her heart we don't take anything for granted and we should not take anything lightly but what God has done within our lives and our hearts then that is something that God also has entrusted with in our lives to keep it within that freshness and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter and he said unto them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery may God bless His Word and bless you as you're being seated I like to continue to read continuing on there in verse 13 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them think about this of how that the Lord Jesus in this moment these disciples if we can say it so much like this it wasn't just like they were new recruits but they had been around they had seen a lot of miracles they had seen many things taking place it shows even in this verse of scripture of where we continually need within our lives the continual checking and leadership of the Holy Spirit because what God was doing in Christ was not when God does something so great it isn't that it makes other things insignificant but yet it brings everything else in - it's right in proper place and I believe that there are things that were that God would admonish us in the scriptures you realized that the the Lord Jesus spoke to the Pharisees when they were so adamant about many things that was going on there within the temple and other things like that and you remember that the Lord Jesus mentions this in the book of Matthew it's recorded in this way but you have omitted the more weightier matters of the law they had been as far as tithing on anise and mint all there's all those things with that's all a part of the word but they had omitted what was to be the motivating force behind their keeping of the word and see what God recognizes is what is coming behind the offering and the sacrifice and that that omitting but the Branham brings us to this place is said it's a sin of omission you said it's not the big things we leave undone it's the little things and I'll say it like this this is where I've trusted you understand what I'm going to say is that we recognize what God has done in visiting us within this generation and the word that God has given to us but let us always remember that it was not something that would so bring us to a place to where his life then is not reflected down here in this earth that we begin to look over things as though that's not significant but let us look at everything and know that when God has sent his word God has intended that word that it would come and it would bring us out and bring us into our inheritance and that what God has already sown in our life that in his presence that land of adoption it will bring out what he has placed in our life but we must stay fully in the land be in the land first of all and then remain in that land and remaining in that land is to remain in his presence it's very very important and I I say it because we recognize the hour that we're in you know it's and I say it in this regards because you know I wasn't aware of it when I would have only been 2 years old but and there were many who took things and I don't believe that people took things deliberately out of context that the Prophet had mentioned but there are things that the Prophet himself he made a declaration as a private student of the word under inspiration and he spoke concerning 1977 that's a whole separate study within itself because there are things that really did begin to terminate and come to an end but yet it's so sometimes the way that that individuals have thought about it and once again don't believe that people intended that to be wrong but you had many I know that some you know that had even come and they said you know I'm gonna retire because I I want to make sure I enjoy my retirement before the coming of the Lord and and so they were taking out you know the accounts and and different things like that and and I'll say it like this that that's something that when we look at it I believe that God he calls us to a place to where we are able to live and walk with God as Enoch walked and yet even in our lives with what he's appointed us to even where he's placed you within your community and your job and all those things like that being sure that where he's placing and then walking with God by allowing his presence in a real personal relationship and keeping that enriched within your life so that it's his influence that his will might be lived and brought forth out of our life and and not to where that we we take one and forget the other and and take one and forget the other but remember all things it's not I get the natural in order first and then I'll go after the spiritual you'll be chasing yourself like a dog trying to find its tail you can't work that way the Bible as the principle seek you first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and then all of these other things will be added unto you so it's first being lined up here it's lined up with him and then in the vertical and then the horizontal you'll be lined up that is not permission to call off work [Laughter] verse 14 but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not in for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms let me just comment on that a moment in verse 15 the receiving of the kingdom as a little child he shall not enter you know a child is just brought to a place from from early on to believe that what you have said about certain things that you're gonna do it and when they're younger you test them on it you let them know I maybe will make a fire tonight they're gonna be right there to remind you dad you said about a fire tonight dad dad you said about a fire dad what took a marshmallow there to remind you and I believe that these are things that where we sometimes I know things come about in our lives where we're not able to maintain and hold our promises and I ask that that's something I believe that within us that we we have to look at these things and ask God to to help us that we don't over tax ourselves and what your quotient was called many say stretch yourself too thin you get stretched thin you know what happens it's a great snap take a rubber band and you stretch it and it'll snap you love him his presence is so sweet look what he did in verse 16 and he took them up in his arms and they put his arms upon them and blessed them and this is what I want to draw our attention to in verse 13 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them this is what I want to speak on this morning that he should touch them and I think of this when we look at this in the scripture there is a thought here I want to move first to the spiritual and then bring it back then then coming back here but he look how the Lord Jesus he's asked the question here in regards to the right of a man to put away his wife and I want you to know when notice where the Lord Jesus goes - he doesn't start with where they're at and where the entanglements but he goes back to the beginning he's taking them back to the original document of which they're looking at the original document but there's one thing that they're missing when looking at the original document they don't have the love of God and the inspiration of God to know what God is truly saying so he brings them back to the program of God by taking them back before there was sin had even entered and he takes them back there and then bringing them back there to a correct union and what a correct union is is what God Himself has joined together then you find how the scripture then opens to that of where children then come on the scene and children are brought to him that he should touch them and I look at it in this in this regards you and I the way that we were brought forth upon this earth and even where if it was a mom and dad that was filled with the Holy Ghost and serving God it still was by an act of God's permissive will and you're still under that first birth and it must be that you come in contact with the Living God who who knows all about your life and he's the one who can really give you true life and he's the one who indeed is is able to undo the first birth and I believe with all of my heart that when you see every age of the Gentile ages when things had got off-track God would send a message to bring the people back in contact with the Living God so that they themselves might know him as the true atonement and the life giver and source of life himself he who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and I believe that with all in my heart that God when he sends his messenger and then the ministry under the people under it I believe it's just like Philip when the Greeks came to him and they said where we would see Jesus Philip brought them to him when Nathaniel there was a question that was you know where Nathaniel was under the tree Andrew going to him and what did he say we have found him who was wrote in the scripture you see it wasn't just a movement somewhere but this is according to the word and that's what caused Nathaniel to come and look and as Nathaniel remember his question what good thing can come out of Nazareth and when he comes there here the Lord Jesus standing there and the word already has for knew him the word near now come to life seize everything that has taken place the conversation and he addresses that and what does do for Nathaniel it unveils that this is not just a man but this is the Living God because who else could know the very secrets and intents of the heart see God when he visits a generation it's to bring that generation to the realization that indeed he is the same yesterday today and forever that he is the Living God it's not just a theory it's not just a quotation but indeed he is still the same and he is alive so it's children the children eyes look at that they brought young children to him that he should touch them and we recognize that that it's the children of the promise that are born of the word which is God's own life poured out upon his promised word as much as Moses was a part of that word Moses pouring his life upon that promise could not bring it to life he couldn't manifest it the way that God could manifest it but when God poured his life in the promise and stood there as the promised Word of the hour and then he poured himself into Moses that's the difference that's the difference that's what this is we're five minutes in God's presence it it takes care of years and years and years of trying to figure him out trying to know him so I look at this this this this quote and gods only provided place of worship brother brems says now you'll notice every three years after a great meeting what takes place a denomination this is 20 years and no denomination dear dying lamb may it never do that if I go in this generation may the people who believe this message never stands still for a denomination the old domination is the very fruits of bitterness you see when even to look at something and you know we're the only church our pastor is only pastor or were the only ones listen friends you have to be careful because listen God has an elect bride are you with me God has an elect bride but there are also going to be many outside the city that is not part of his bride but has received they've received the salvation of the Lord and God knows who they are His grace spills over from the Brum from that of the Lamb's Book of Life into the book of life and God knows exactly so with with within at all it's just simply to keep our lives focused on him and I'll say it like this it's even to where the Suttons of the subtlety of even denomination is where even in our thinking to where we can even get thinking of just our family our families the standard or our families there's sex denomination because already it's dividing and divisive within the body we're not it's not many bodies one body it's one body is that true so to recognize denominations is not just having a name that is fitted or common but it's simply even being drawn off and in an in exclusiveness but no no we are in need of God's call medical we're needed in need of His grace that doesn't mean that we compromise and listen when Paul look when Paul stood there and Paul would even speak false workers deceitful workers and on and on that very thing Paul did not want to see injury to the body but remember it's that the body would go on so it's always remembering that our heart is to be about the body of Jesus Christ if our focus is not about the body of Jesus Christ then I wonder are we a part of that body because when we're a part of that body then all that is a part of it it is a focus within that and listen it's not just something Universal but it manifests itself in every local body the very hour that you mentioned denomination among you I don't think I would I would be Darris them to say I don't think anyone was saying that of a a church where the message is being preached I don't think anyone any one of us would say or a denomination I don't I don't believe we would say that so there's something as he's mentioning right here when you mention denomination among you so it must be threads or those things that would be similar to it my prayer and I pray is your heart oh God try my heart Lord keep it ever true let us have no confidence in the flesh if we see something in God has showed you something he showed me something remember it's God who has showed it and if God showed it then before you tell it make sure you live it I don't care he said how sincere you are and I you I think we can agree denominations I don't believe there's wrong intentions in all of those things we're program and we want to see this is preserved and we want to keep this I don't believe that it's all together that it's wrong intentions but you see it's what's behind it god never entrusted that his church would be led by man but it would be the holy ghost coming through the offices that he has placed within the body it's him moving through your life so it is the leadership of the Holy Spirit working among the body because we're not children who are just left to find our own way he said the moment you take man for your leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm this word that's the hour you die the genuine seed cannot because there's nothing left after the seed it's the same thing was back at the beginning it's the bride that fell into the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat again in that wonderful the genuine seed cannot de nominate the genuine seat can there can be denominations and thoughts and this is amande we believe this and this camp and this camping but the genuine seed and if there's genuine seed that have come under any of that remember God Himself will not leave hoof behind his promise is to himself until we all come in the unity of the faith so in looking at that thought of it I believe that this is something that when we look at this this statement that the Prophet makes that we we can see the track on down through the scriptures of how things can Sol easily become that and I I caution that it doesn't become something to where that we can look at it and say well you know brother Graham said this message cannot denominator and I agree with it with all of my heart but remember the seed cannot de nominate there can be denominational thoughts and thinking and fragmentation and divisions and everything and there has been all of that can come so listen that's what I'm saying our confidence is not just looking at a word under a false pretense of what we think it is but to recognize we are called to be vigilant within this hour as the scripture said that have been we have been referring to in Rome nine except the Lord of Sabaoth that word Sabbath is that of the Lord whereby in his hosts his army of people he maintains his cause this is a vigilance this is why that even Solomon look when he would describe the beauty of the bride there two different places in the Song of Solomon he would also describe in her beauty that she's terrible awesome and all inspiring as an army with banners its comely as tears are so it's a part where she's not willing to relinquish any rights and what belongs to her and I believe that that's what God has called and his calling in this hour and I believe that's what rises in our hearts we're not gonna compromise by God's grace with him in arm it's motivating us John 1:1 1 first John look how John brings this that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it look at this it was manifested what was manifested the life and we have seen it and we bear witness of it and we show it unto you that eternal life so it was manifested we have seen it it's been uncovered unveiled to us now we are bearing witness to that and we are also in the bearing witness is showing that same life unto you glory be to God which was with the father and was manifested unto us this is a mystery this is a hidden mystery now being made known that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ notice what the call is the purpose here of what we've seen and what we've heard we're declaring it unto you that you might have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ Noora if the desire it's a longing when God what God has done in your life in your heart don't you want it for everybody else you have a longing for what God that reality that joy that even in the midst of your I'll say a gloomy day out here there's still joy down in the midst of your soul that is something when there's a stability it's a life source it's a it's a faith that where you can look and say I don't know how all of this is going to come out I don't know how God is going to work this out but I know that God's in control and Lord as you're in control I'm asking you to take me under control I submit my mind that submit my thoughts I submit my emotion that submit everything Lord that your will might be performed you see it's like when you have whether your garden or your flowers or whatever you have you you are your confidence is in what you have planted that it will come forth and produce but you cannot just leave that garden go you can't just let the flowers go you know even if you have mulch down weeds will come up if you're so often you have to cultivate and loosen around it you see it's not something that once it's been planted it goes on autopilot but there is a care the Bible says in the book of Genesis God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he placed the man whom he had formed that he would dress it and keep it God planted it by his word so he's turning it over to Adam but remember how his Adam to keep this garden by his word so gods were now working through human instrumentality even though he hasn't fallen but notice God in trust God takes his work God's not God's not in fear God takes his word and he entrust that word that's the same that he's done in every generation that's the same thing that he has done in this hour God entrust his word remembers the Prophet said he just doesn't give it to flirter he speaks it to his beloved I look at this I look at this Todd was just so pressing that he should touch them I thought of a place or brother branham mentions in the message of how that God hides behind skin bilham says it like this and I want you to just to take this even though a familiar story maybe two perhaps to most of you but bream says it like this and I've not put it there because I just want to just phrase things he says there's there's a home a Christian home this is very important it's a Christian home a Christian home remember they were first called Christians illegals Antioch the first called Christians and the Christians I believe it was cristianos ano sir there are to be christ-like see they didn't give themselves that name the Methodists did not give themselves that name it was those outside that gave them that name it's because they didn't understand what God was doing then you had others that didn't pick that up and that was the name they were carrying the name without carrying carrying what was really a life of what God had done and moved on but there was a home a Christian home and you remember brother Brent says there was a big storm you know that came up and he said you know lightning was flashing it's getting late in the night and the mother said to Junior junior you go upstairs and go to bed don't be scared go on up there every time when I read this on here brother bran tell I remember see most of my life I was raised in big country farmhouses that's why to this day I still have problems with just wood floor just that's all we had and that's all I remember getting out on cold floors things like that I'm not against it that's no pivotal place see honey no no that's this is best brother Samuel this isn't doctrine is my opinion but I remember that it seemed like I was a long way away from mom and dad you know so little junior Oh with his pants on you know his pajamas he goes up the steps and he's looking back he's half crying brother Brent talks about it and he says he even called out to his momma he said mama come up here with me oh she said junior nothing is going to bother you that lightning can't hurt you you know what she's doing she's giving him true word it's true Christian whole she is looking at the situation and she's giving him a true word that hey that and he's not gonna hurt you she said junior my little son mother wants to tell you something now watch this she says we're a Christian family we believe in God we believe that God protects us in storms we believe that we believe that God takes care of his own I want you to believe that Junior that don't be scared God is with us he'll protect us Junior snubbed a few times mama I believe that too but when that lightning is so close to the window I like to feel the God that's got skin on it it wasn't that he was arguing that she was not speaking the truth but what he needed to calm him in the storm that was present he needed a God with skin on it he needed someone that had faith in that word and who knew that word and had proved that word and that word was sure he needed God with skin on it let me tell you something in this generation we need a God with skin on it and right now we need God with skin on him with same living God not just words we need that same word that has been delivered God delivered it through his messenger God come down in this hour in a veil of flesh and God took upon anointed that messenger with his spirit and there he spoke that word and that word has been vindicated by the very presence of Almighty God God was skin on it and that was a call to you and I what God did there in that messenger is what God wants to do in every life God with skin on it if it's not God with skin on it in your life then very easily it can be things we believe this is true I believe that's true you've got to have him who's the standard because the standard even if you get off in your thoughts you get denomination on your thoughts the standard is there and you can be corrected you can be brought back in line because the desire of your heart the desire of our heart is to please him that's what's important clear his spirit coming down God was skin on it and I I look at this and I think of Exodus 12 with the family and that's really what I'm honing in here today he's on the family and the family application you know brother branham he takes it will send a message the token and he speaks of a time in the opening or at least of what i've quoted here he takes us back to a moment of where Jacob had met God had been changed by God but then Jacob had kind of taken his own course and it brought some trouble in his family and when it came back God spoke to him and said in Genesis 35 I want you to come back to Bethel where I met you and I relieved you in the hour of your distress he come back to where you've drifted from and that's a whole separate thought to minister on but I look at how that when the Prophet is speaking this it is a call when he's giving this out like Jacob did he said told his wife and all of them wash her clothes and everything and put away them gods it's a call back to her God met and became one with his creation after day of Pentecost it's the call back to that same living God in the same living expression because after that took place then we see how things drifted and things got off but God calls us to this place and he goes on talk about how that Joshua he said you know how even how Joshua approached it there in the beginning of Joshua before crossing over wash your clothes come not at your wives and so forth getting ready for within three days we'll cross Jordan he was getting ready was applying the token he was applying the token the word even in preparation so the applying of it is also it's that which goes into the preparation he says get ready apply it believe it clean up let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you it'll take an effect I say Amen let them see it in you and it will take an effect so what they see is not you but Christ and it's Christ in you that takes an effect because remember don't allow the enemy to stretch you to where you are looking at trying to bring transformation through natural measures now there's just let me just deal on this just a moment there are standards of the word that we are accountable for from when they're coming from early on they are not to be left to self-discovery are you with me with Samuel they've got to have their own experience nobody in here disagrees with that but I also remind you that we are to be their Holy Ghost until they get old enough to receive it there's a challenge to all of our hearts it's an to take and take an effect upon our lives it's have an effect and I want you to watch this what job program says this he says then apply the token in prayer let me come back to that I understood forgot that he brought it back to my attention you don't try to handle things even you look at your things in your marriage here you are husband and wife you look I said well this is natural but remember if we believe God's Word and know that's a spiritual union that had to take place first then we've got to rely upon the supernatural God to give us leadership not while I've been married now I know it all I've got everything I've got everything put together I've got the scriptures I've got the quotes but we need God we need the supernatural God that he would lead us remember he gave Adam to dress it and keep it but he did not remove Adam from the supernatural part and the supernatural does not mean that the natural says I have nothing to do with it this is all supernatural I'll just kick back and relax it'll all happen on its own it won't there's things that we have to do very simple brother Bram says if you don't tell your wife that she's the best cook in the country if you don't tell her you know he goes on to those things he said then who is hoo-wee we're just getting started I'm a time I just started for today I'm just saying we're just getting started then apply the token in prayer you know the quicker that we can recognize and I'm not just saying well know something we need to be born again III think that's something that you should realize that puts you in contact with the Living God but it doesn't remove and say well you're not going to have any problems you're not gonna have any issues you're not gonna have any that's that's not according to the Word of God as a matter of fact when you've been born again then you have been equipped with divine authority where the word now is seeded in power and authority in your life and Paul had to look look how much time that Paul took under the leadership of the Lord in the book of Ephesians he turned in Galatians he brought it in Corinthians he brought it you said oh that was just for them remember that's pride they Paul lend her the leadership of the Lord salt they had a need I I don't want to look at myself and I'll just tell you they're straight out I don't have it all together but he does he does he's the image that I want to see and I want to I want to be reflected and he's the image I want to set before you I don't want my thoughts or my ideas set before you I want him because when it's him then he cultivates himself from your life they called how God has made me the way that I look the way that I think about things God has made me that way and God has made you another way but the one things that's the same he is Christ is the same nature within us and he is manifesting his victory through all of our weaknesses and even our strengths because our strengths can be our biggest hindrance when it's not yielded to history my then apply the token in prayer with consideration with believing so here is prayer you see when there's situations that arise things take place I know I'm talking right down where we're living there's things that have that arise and there's things that you can look at I can look at and you know as far as in our natural strengths you or frustrate yourself trying to make it happen trying to make it turn around but I want you to look at this right here by prayer it brings you in contact with God and you stay in contact with God and you're looking to God to say Lord my eyes my senses every part of me may look and say I don't see how this can be but Lord this is your word this is what you have laid out and and I know you to be the same yesterday today forever it might be an old promise but Lord you kept the promise to me of the Father you revealed yourself to me you cleaned up my life you filled me with the Holy Ghost you kept your promise and that's where I stand before you not as a worthy mortal but as a son and daughter of God clothed in the blood of Jesus Christ called by the voice of that blood I stand before you Lord on the authority of your word Lord if it's something in me that needs to be arranged in order for what I'm desiring to happen then arrange it in me you see sometimes we're so focused on trying to arrange others and it's not so much that others are the problem that's saying there are problems but remember it's even the arrangement and everything must come in here to actually be in here to believe that God is able because if not if it's not arranged in here it's you're reaching out with the natural measures then apply it with prayer or in prayer with consideration with believing apply it with such love and so forth till you know it's going to take place it's going to take place I mean just I mean just dealing this just a moment I'm just going to touch this just a moment this morning when we look at this thought consideration I want to make sure that I'm as clear as clear can be when we're looking at consideration it's taking into account what is really needed example with Paul was Benjamin even in Zachary but more or less now with Paul and Benjamin there's certain things has changed there's certain I'm not picking on them and I hope I'm not embarrassing them if I am will maybe ice cream later that sound like that was for me but there are things that is much different with them now than when they were little when they were when they were little the time of discipline was quick even if even with me you know going and laying things out and telling them my heart this is why and this is holding their hand you know what sometimes me crying with him it was me expressing my heart because the way that I look at this let me tell you friends there's a statement that the Prophet made before I was ever married and it resonated within my heart I even preached it before him but it came to me within that of the natural and he says how that God disciplines us as his children he disciplines us with a vision in mind church age book he disciplines us with a vision to know that if this isn't corrected here where it'll be later on if they're allowed to stand in the floor now and twirl around what will it be when they get married you're with me Donner I don't expect you to scream and shun that but I want CDI we want we did just to get be sown it's it's looking at see what you see now it's an entrusting with a molding and a developing of that and let me just try to end this part here this morning within that that aspect of it that I'm not going to approach them as a young child as I would him as an 18 year old boy in other words me and your buddies buddy we're buddies and you know or you know I don't have any daughters but you know we're buddies and buddies don't remember brother Ben talked about a buddy when he talked about sister Rebekah 18 years old he weren't in a compromise her brother branham was not a like this this was that's not how are you pry applied that I'm not going to get into that this morning brother Ben didn't approach it that way friends let me tell you something God brought us a message in this generation that covers the basis I believe that was all my heart that's how I live that that's how I apply that I can't help it when I go there situations I come in - alright you know what you might call me a nut or whatever more I can hear his voice come forth I'll hear it I'm a nun remember exactly the message so many times I maybe can other times I can but you know it is it's something that one my prayer has always been God right there so deep on my heart Lord that is principle in my life principle in my life I don't want to forget things we're not now go out of service so write it in me just not left to this up here where it's tell me here so if we if we're not careful we're looking at things and we are treating five-year-olds like 18 year olds you see where this brings us back into the place to where we need God's leadership into the discipline book you as me God God's done the same thing what I'm speaking to you God this must be a pattern in the scripture if it's not in the scripture then or not not be spoken but God has dealt with every age according to where they were at God will even deal Nate listen I've been in times where even when you look at remember that on the the minister remember he kept on preaching repentance in the window stop preaching repentance he said when everybody repents that's the inspiration God's given sometimes you look at and say how long is brother Sam you're gonna labor on this let me change something it is in laboring because I'm just like wow I really enjoyed this thought there's times of thoughts that I was just waiting to keep moving on and God just picks me up and pulls me on a hole or Lord ha there's so much it's pew you may know right there but it's for a time there we'll get back to it if he tarries but how many times in myself when I went in just just me little me I've gone into a meeting and I thought I thought I knew you know it was a comfort to me I found I knew I was going to preach so I said I can actually eat when I got there I could actually eat a meal with them and then the next morning you wake up and in prayer and all of a sudden here it is moments before I'm ready to step out the hotel and all of a sudden hear this thought it's inspired in prayer and I have nothing this have to jot down a few things but you know what it is it's God knows the needs of his people that is such a rest he knows what we have need of when we have need of it it might be something that we would look and say well that's simple that's something over I've already covered back there but remember what Peter said under the leadership of the Lord I find it well I'm still here in this Tabernacle to stir up your your remembrance your pure mind by way of remembrance what was he calling them back to virtues of that life that is to be expressed and come to maturity in our lives and the word brings us to that you say Amen sorts of consideration a plant was such love and so forth till you know it's going to take place it's going to take place that's a very key important point with love apply it in confidence you know faith works by love faith works by love love is the results or faith faith is the results of love your love it comes faith is that right so it's love being projected and love itself because I heard the brother brems said the other day he says go to the drugstore and buy me a quarter of it you can't explain it you can try a man was in the insane institution there writing about the love of God if you can't you can't bring it down to where it's just something explainable it's just something that you know that resonates from the very depths of your soul apply that confidence believing it's going to help when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband talk to your wife talk to this loved one believe that it's going to help so look look what's being shota don't know miss this faith in the word releases the atmosphere of his presence and remember if a heart condemn us we cannot have confidence so if there's anything in you that condemns or just give that right so that faith itself can be a master of every circumstance so that love itself can have you might listen you might be walking forward with truth but remember it's not just truth it must be God with skin on it so so the approach in it is our lives in individually being evaluated under God's presence when we are laying ourselves before God and the Lord's Prayer is not just a prayer but it is indeed the heart's cry thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give me this day my daily bread and Lord lead me not into temptation but deliver me from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory amen [Music] notice he said so so here when you're speaking there's an atmosphere of the word and I'll say like this if you're not in the right tenor if you're not in the right place and all of us have failed and it isn't that all of a sudden you come to place behind off no longer fail but it's recognizing if you're not in the right humor at that moment be angry and sin not you didn't say you were gonna get angry it should be angry and sin that right so when you've not in the right tenor of something or the right humor of something it's best to say the Lord change me I'm all you know if they check your blood pressure at that time of you you know you weak and I was like oh I need some chocolate to pick me up er oh it's a weekend so like my energy is gone see listen friends we talked about we'll try every spirit one of the things that you can recognize even as the Prophet said your body was not made to lie when something is brought to you you can try it not just by the words look at what it's leading to and look at what it's doing in you Alleluia that's the truth here's he says just stand there and say Lord I've claimed them they're mine I'm getting them for you Lord oh well we could just preach it on this right here I'm getting them for you what is it what is it I might be mom and their mom or their dad or whatever however however it is as far as with you the mother you're the dad you hear you are you standing I'm getting them for you this isn't about me Lord it's about your kingdom seek you first the kingdom of God you you want to see their soul saved you want to see them turned around you want to see their life on fire with God then remember you must keep the order of overcoming that's God first God first family second you last and you can actually put family before God and when you've done that you put yourself before God but remember it's him first him first that's the order of overcoming and I believe that every one of us we want to have our lives like conduits that invite the supernatural that invite God to come down and to speak to us because we don't know situations that we might be faced with or called upon and we're living within this hour but our focus and our courage and our strength is to come from God apply it for us so we're saying in our heart Lord I'm doing this for you I'm doing this for you Lord this is about see and you know what that is when it's about him eternal life is living for others see that creates an atmosphere oh my I just love this he says apply it and create that atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right into it we are how much your creators we can create some atmospheres it depends on what kind of atmosphere you want to create I'm not gonna ask us your hands because we're all we've all been in that place of where that an atmosphere and something that all we just had to say this or that or I'm not the only one I'm preaching to all and the atmosphere you've got to work to get that atmosphere back and getting the atmosphere back you know it takes more than just the words I'm sorry it takes God with skin on it to create that atmosphere again hallelujah and and you're called for it I said you're called for it you're anointed for this if you are born of the Spirit of God you're anointed for this you might come to red sea sometimes and you think what's going on and the Lord speaks back to you and says why cry unto me speed and go forward for I who commissioned you there you have forgot your commission but your commission is I am with thee Oh glory be to God see this is where the Prophet brings us to this place on the rich young ruler in the message come follow me it's also titled leadership shorter version where the RAM speaks it to graduates there in Arizona libram the cautions even those who are the graduates of brother brems says that our message does not become just theology remember in trying to do God a service Jeffersonville and also in Shreveport he reads a portion out of Deuteronomy and charging us charging those who believe this message it's a great charge that he takes the time to read this and and this is what I would say that within this let me just I have to I I don't want to skip these things and just leave some of this to them so until next week or something listen friends theology is not just is not just well I'm not gonna teach them the truths of this message I'm not going to lay these things out before them you know God's got ministry that's true God does got ministry but God has entrusted you in your home don't neglect your duty it's just like this can you imagine can you imagine a platoon that would neglect their duty and then they're coming to merge with the rest of the army and here they are one's got their legs up here and one's got you know as he's walking along he's got his gun on this side and the rest got their guns on this side the one's got his hat over here and they got all sorts of things they're not even dressed right I'll tell you what that's sergeant the generals gonna have him well I'm glad God had a seventh angel messenger and he he the chief general came on the scene that mighty angel and he spoke and gave direction to our life that as we can live under his influence than he can prepare us for all that we have need of we have not been left to our own devices huge focus word is here to confirm that word and bring it to pass so I say it in this in this regards here then it's not something that we look at and just say well they'll figure it out on their own this is something friends that I believe that our children need to know what we believe and why we believe it it's not just because the church teaches it or we believe it it's why do we believe this it's not just something we quote from the word but it's this is what God's desire is for a life we're called to be a separated people we're not to look like the world smell like the world sake like the world you can call out of Egypt don't take them back to bondage honey because the rapture is too close it's a bonus well you know brother Simon I don't know so much are you trying to make an excuse I'm asking you mom I'm asking you daddy where's your life at remember it's God with skin on it well we'll send them too well bring him to church will setting up to Sunday school it ought to be school at your heart it ought not be that they're up there teaching them things that they hear for the first time I love you but I'm here to preach this word words here I'm here to burn it burns within my heart to see that this message it does not become a denomination it doesn't become away a lifestyle of something that we're just saying oh yeah we we go to church and yeah you know yeah we we we well you know we we yeah we believe a prophet and you know God centered but no it's it's something and you say well you can't make that happen in in people's hearts I know I can't but I know that God can do it and God will do it and has done it and he's doing it with every heart that he himself can touch and as identified that's one of his children my heart's desire is to bring you to him that he might touch you because when he touches you there's a strength there's a stability there's your anchor well I'll send them to you smeeting youth meeting doesn't replace that that's not even my vision within a youth meeting my vision and the youth meaning is not to train up where things have been lacked I'm just pressing my heart absolutely not that doesn't mean that we're gonna have a quiz you know coming up but I you know I look at just the simplicity of things you know and you know pardon me sister Carmen just to use the example I heard the testimony back there I didn't know the second part but I had asked you to give the first part to my but I looked at that back there and my heart just was just pulsating within my heart but see the simplicity of it you didn't have to go through no down I know it was sister Carmen she's went through that with with her children I believe that with Peter but you understand here it was it's not just leaving it as a story but it brings it to a reality we are like Peter there's a need that has a rose and we're going to come up empty but let's cast on the other side of the boat because God has made this promise to us and it brought them together where they could pray pray for it what's it doing it's an instruction it's a training just using that example because it's pressing here before us you see friends that's the same way with that that black sister down there in Memphis she didn't just read the Bible as Bible it was just theology see herself there was a need in her life and it was revealed to her there's a need and she said Lord eyes that Shunammite woman where is your Elisha she knew he's still God she found her place in the way in the scriptures for the need in that moment her boy was in need her boy needed God wished in on it and what was the story of a oh my woman it became God with skin on it somebody having faith that God is still the same God that could ground the plane that that Memphis Airport and to where here she is out there on the fence she just didn't get out there five minutes before he got there she had been there all night the dew was on her back I love those she was waiting for God to fulfill that promise I believe that was all my heart it's bringing Christ present you can have all the right things but where's your passion do your children does your husband does your wife do they know your passion for the Lord do you have a passion for God I trust this is striking our hearts listen friends I don't just preach things it's reflective I want to bring it here the moment that I stop reflecting the moment but I read in the where I'm listening to the message and I stop reflecting that's the moment I'm back slid because you understand his presence the Holy Spirit the Prophet are just looking at this week as this presence comes his presence is so necessary the Holy Spirit coming through that word to shake us that our roots would go deeper it's necessary it's the teaching of the value is his presence it's his life it's God with skin on it there where you and I we can say like Paul said follow me as I follow Christ think of this inspiration of the remnant can I have a few more moments remember the inspiration of the remnant that came back from Babylon the temple is what is reared up first God has a as retur come at the right time then after the temple notice the order is the temple first the place of worship and as the temple was raised then God has Nehemiah come and Nehemiah is burdened about the walls of Jerusalem and Nehemiah takes the people out there I imagine it wasn't maybe so much of a comfortable moment for them I want you just to take this in a moment Nehemiah in the scriptures he takes him out there and now he has people those that's come with him and others that are there and here they are looking down upon Jerusalem the temples there but he points out considering how the walls are burned down are falling down I would say at that moment it wasn't something it wasn't a rejoicing moment it was but it was something that see God's burden upon their heart was they saw the need they saw the need and as they saw the knee then at that time Nehemiah spoke under the leading of the Lord I want to read this because I don't want to just paraphrase this he says you see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of jerusalem that wiii be no more a reproach then i told that home of the hand of my god which was good upon me has also the king's words that he had spoken to me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good work to build up the walls what were the walls it's pretension God said in Zechariah and I'll be a wall of fire round about you walls of protection remember when when when David had had compromised and let down the latter part of Psalm 51 build up oh god the walls of Jerusalem the walls of Jerusalem when David spoke that they weren't or doubt but David recognized my identity is in Jerusalem can we I recognize our identity is not in Jerusalem of this earth but is in that New Jerusalem build up the walls the Lord build up the walls Lord the responsibility the keeping will God tell you so much so we could spend within that part right there that how that when when Nehemiah spoke within those things in regards to that and how that David spoke within that building up the walls of Jerusalem those walls of protection and I tell you what in the hour that we live in and the hour we live in the time that we live in let me say it's such a terrible age it's the most deceptive of all ages but yet God in the midst of this has ordained and he's bringing out of people called by his name and I'm telling you this right here you you are ordained to overcome in this hour there is everything that you can look at and I could look at it and say oh brother Samuel Oh brother Sam my kids in this world and the way it's going take your focus and say Lord the way your word is going we're going you understand it's what you're looking at who you're looking to because where you're looking your feet will follow and the call of the word comes through the message in this hour get back into line and step peeled up for well so Jerusalem if there stage has been let down say God give me the strength to build him up give me the strength the Lord the value of his presence the value of his life I'm telling you listen friends we are anointed for that this is not a pep rally but I believe with all my heart did one sometimes when you look at situations you can look at things it can seem so bleak but let me say this to you God is taking a bride out of this age and I'm gonna tell you right now I'm not gonna preach this today out of the scripture but God's identified this even in a promise that the Prophet led by the Spirit of God shook it before us that Bend this generation the climax of the rapture that began at the opening of the seals when our bodies are changed the climax of that there will be young people they'll be children that are changed and they'll be old ones that will be changed it's the promise that we have within this hour and what a responsibility that we have all may that ever be our prayer that he should touch them that he would touch us and continue to touch us you know it's something about a touch when God touches you don't you love him when he touches love it like brother BAM talks about he said that Corinthians book of Corrections he said he said I would think something's wrong if my wife every once in a while didn't come over to me and put her hand on me and say honey he said I would think something's wrong you see it's touch brother brems said well he said how did that wife he said she can take that husband that's all twisted up and boys she can touch him she can whisper in his ear honey getting set him down on the chair she can sit on his lap she said I appreciate all you do I believe going he's got a bride in this tower said Jesus sit down you're the center of our life but let me let me just tell you I want to sit on your lap he comes down you sit we sit on his lap I want to tell you I just love you I want to tell you I appreciate all you do you know every part I mean you know what I'm up you know when I'm down David said he knows my uprising in my down sitting Lord you know all of me you know all of that lord I want to say thank you for your faithfulness our thank you for your grace Lord thank you for direct thank you for correcting me but I've been wrong thank you lord and here we are just you know moving our hands through his hair you're my lord you're anointed let's just stop here you're anointed for this if you listen friends let's walk under his presence and I say this as your pastor those of you that look to me as your pastor I can never nor what I ever want to or never try to replace that personal relationship between you and the Lord Jesus Christ can't do it but your confidence on your face is to be slowly in him and listen to me well you look at within your own abilities it's true our own abilities are insufficient for the task but God has never ever called people never whose abilities were sufficient he called Abraham and Sarah bring forth a child it looked like he would have called people who would have had the ability God didn't do it that way all of these things are for you and I in this hour we would draw strength from that not to trust in our own ability and the trusting not in our own ability means fully submitting our abilities to him not Lord I don't know I can do it you can no no it's submitting our life into his hands my brother Ben talked about the man trying to put the coat on the little boy you say keeps going around you got one arm in it keeps going around keeps going he said but if he can give his hand to the man who has the coat then that man can take his hand and guide it into the other sleeve I believe the same God who changed my soul will also be the one who guide me into the change of my body I put on a crime it liken unto his own glorious garment it's a change our lives in his hands it's supernatural let me say this to you I know I keep going I just did so much of my heart but remember this we're not walking by earthly senses but is to recognize that the supernatural God is here to influence our lives because to look through just this realm right here it looks bleak you look through this realm right here you can look at a doctor's report it looks bleak you can look through these eyes you can say on my wayward son or my wayward daughter or my son or my daughter you're just looking at this eyes to remember remember the same God who got a hold of your life that's the confidence that's where your confidence is is in him in his working when he did in your life that's the confidence that you can look and have for those sand I've been praying for him for a long time keep praying you never forget to test him I think brother Billy Paul gave this testimony where man asked brother Branham and brother Billy Paul him to be there and a man asked for the Branham the question should I continue to pray for him and I know I don't remember all the parts should I continue to pray for him and brother branham's response to that brother was when he was asked should I continue to pray for my loved one should I continue to pray brother BAM turned and he asked the man he's a brother he said was Calvary worth it for you was Calvary worth it for you someone who held for you I think that says a whole lot someone who held for you you're loving this morning you've been commissioned this morning if if you've not had that commissioning in your soul you can receive that this morning don't just don't just go upon just being a part of a church or being around that won't work but God intends for you to live in victory and just remember there's this things that even that the Lord has spoken today and when God even through things if how he'll continue to guide listen to me let's just lay everything about our lives just let all the feelings let it be laid aside and say God come and direct me come and direct me Lord Jesus let's pray Lord Jesus we just want to say Lord this morning how we love you Lord words words fail us Lord so many times and father no doubt as I speak here at Lord this morning father there's so many things that even from throughout the years and even Lord when years ago Lord in times when speaking on the family all my so many experiences now Lord that father from even my heart and my life Lord the Lord I'm looking to you of that inspiration Lord that you would guide and direct our hearts and our lives what I know as I stand here today I don't stand as a perfect person in my self perfection by the blood of Jesus Christ in my soul where I've been redeemed absolutely the Lord you're working on me it's something Lord that we can have a lot of understanding becomes the father mother husband life but there's nothing like the experiencing of it because it's not just words it's supernatural and that it being supernatural it calls for this natural to submit that the supernatural God can fulfill his word of promise through our lives Lord Jesus I pray Lord that you would forgive us Lord of our mistakes and our shortcomings and I asked that Lord not only for myself but the entirety of this assembly and I ask that from our hearts Lord may just come a renewing Lord within this moment that where we are at Lord that for each heart in each life to take Lord God these things very seriously very dear to heart the Lord it's you your desires to be in us with skin on [Music] I pray the Lord where mistakes or maybe there's things Lord that have been made I pray that fatherís we're here in your presence I pray that God that the enemy would not be allowed to Lord a press with condemnation but I asked the Lord that in genuine conviction which is entirely different from condemnation find conviction always points us not only what's wrong but to where that we can behold I pray this morning Lord may there be whole lives this morning Lord lives that would be made whole I pray that God [Music] maybe Lord which seems like promises that we're even looking at where it would seem like as it were maybe but the carpet has been pulled out from underneath our feet but I pray that God this morning as your presence warming those promises to our heart Lord and calling us back to look to you the supernatural God and that our faith would be in you Lord as your prophet told us over and over he said Abraham's faith was not so much in the promise as it was in the God who made the promise free stagger not but unbelief [Music] but he was strong giving praise under God believing that what he had promised he was also able to perform Lord I pray when we try to handle things in a natural level we will be frustrated but God like Moses when he went down to Egypt he didn't go down there just with his intellects of the word but he was in the hand of God and I pray this morning God that for every marriage Lord for every husband for every wife Lord God I pray for every mommy for every day I pray for Lord the grandparents Lord in their responsibilities in this hours well Lord Oh God may our lives be fully in your hand because as those seven stars are in the right hand then all the power and authority of a Godhead is behind us Lord Granite Lord our design Lord is to submit into surrender to you help us Lord I pray in the applying of your word I pray God we're homes that Lord where the voice of God is not being played I pray God that they recognize Lord the importance of God what Jesus we know it's it's not just a voice Lord God of the seventh messenger Lord but it's the voice Lord within that voice so god I pray Heavenly Father may who god they're just such an arrangement Lord a changement of me or God a consecration Lord like Joshua told Lord that father where things are laid aside and sanctifying ourselves Lord making ready for the cross we are standing we see our promised land in my father's house are many mansions we see it Lord coming into sight Oh God brandon lord i pray this morning may each and every heart lord with with real reflection not just in this moment but god as we leave from this place may our hearts be reflective in our own lives [Music] Granite Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen may God bless you just stay with me let's sing that song we've been made more than conquerors I believe that with all of my heart no matter the task no matter the situation God is for you who can be against you [Music] amen just play it one time through let's just close our eyes let him just play it one time through my plate we just worship the Lord right there in your heart just take that in just just thinking up on that plane one more time [Music] let it be our prayer now we've been made [Music] over time [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's time you know many times when I've dealt with things within the family sometimes I know how the enemy would like to get you can get on people's shoulder and I'm not removing conviction but I want you to understand this when Esther came before the king she had a courage to stand before him she said they're going to slaughter her me and my people it has were said my word is my word I can't God and I changed not but he said this is what you can do you can you and your people can put on the full armor of God you can arm yourself and what seeds were sown but you can come and you can sow good seed that'll counteract the effect of the bad seed we're not left without a hope we can take that word and you rise within that word where the word has called you to this morning God has spoken his word to our hearts just as he did to Adam multiply and replenish the earth don't be one like brother BAM says it in the place of the message he said if you've been a failure as a housewife you've been a failure as a husband you're gonna be he said let that be a has-been you see it comes to a place repulsive I Paul said it like this he said I have learned to forget those things that are in the past I think of story here's this older Widow she takes robert e lee general robert e lee after the war he goes down to visit she says generals he said i want you to come on here i want to say something he comes out there she says general i want to show you this tree it's just a tree i want to show you this tree you say you know what happened to this street she went through a whole list my son was killed this was happening this it was a lot of things it was just it was just it be glue you know general he said he said cut it down and burn it there's some things you need as memorials but that Memorial held in bondage it might have seemed heartless but it was what she needed she needed to cut it down and burn it I'll tell you what I believe this the sword of the Lord is sharper than any sword I believe its it it don't do a hack job you know cut it and I believe there's a fire that's not just a fire that leaves a remnant but it is a consuming fire our God is a consuming fire I believe that if we can just say okay cut it cut it I believe that was all my heart supernatural God things that you can't forget but he himself can give you the strength to take the steam that's there and pull the sting out of it so you're no longer under the steam you love him you've been made we've been made more than conquerors we sure have God coming he made his promise known to us again and again let's sing this one more time can we do that brother Dave crest will you come and dismiss us in a water prayer we've been made more than calm [Music] [Music] [Music] amen I just want to give just a little quick testimony something happened this morning and and I want to say thank you all for your prayers come sure it's doing so much better wonderful words this morning too something happened this morning and you know what sure he's been through in a lot and she was telling me you know honey has

care all about us and every part of our life Lord and we're so thankful Lord to know that you're so mindful of Lord of our weeks and our frailties but Lord we know how strong you are and help us as we heard this morning Lord just to take you at your word and press forward and the Lord the things that Lord we feel that his Lord just may we use them as stepping stones Lord yes and the Lord Jesus just
