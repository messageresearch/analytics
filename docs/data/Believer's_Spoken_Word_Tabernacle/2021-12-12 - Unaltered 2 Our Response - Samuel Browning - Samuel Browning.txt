you unless god gives them permission and surely that scripture is fulfilled that all things work very better though we may understand or not understand it somewhere along the line it's going to work for our good so i just want to give a testimony of what happened to me on i last wednesday a week before i we had just finished working in brother jose's house brother richard and myself and went home went to sam to get some gasoline went to get something to eat and i was eating and all of a sudden my right hand just went totally numb i couldn't pick up this paper that's all i know me was just totally dead wondering what was going on felt a little kind of funny my neck i was having a lot of trouble with my neck had a lot of pain didn't know why so i went through wednesday and then thursday was basically the same i didn't come to the service thursday and then uh friday my wife said let's go to emergency we went to emergency and they uh took me in and gave me an x-ray of my neck and i had a laceration in my one of my main arteries one of my main arteries was leaky um so finally i spent all night at the er and about 5 30 in the morning they brought me up and then after a while they sent me for mri in my head and i told that or something you're going to find nothing and then the doctor came back the next day and said to me that i had multiple strokes and he says he said and you're lucky you didn't lose none of your strength i didn't lose anything at all you know i'm sitting there in the bed with my legs crossed waiting to go home i just felt okay and then they had me on this blood thinners and this blood thinner is going to keep you there five to six days and the doctor says you know we could put you on uh eloquence and eloquence is real expensive and i said no problem i said the va will take care of it i didn't realize how expensive it is very expensive and uh and i want to thank you for your prayers you were praying for me and and i'm just so thankful for what god does you know and like i said we don't understand it i'm sitting there like nothing happened you know and i was real weak but i felt that way like nothing happened if you would have came to the hospital you'd have seen that what's wrong with that guy that's that's the way i i felt and actually that's the way i looked you know i just didn't look like anything was wrong but there's a lot of things wrong but i want to thank god for his mercy and his and everything that he does for us is just so wonderful you know a couple years ago about almost two and a half years ago they operated me on my prostate it's the condition that came with it and i waited and i waited patiently and sometimes not very patient either i had a lot a lot of problems my wife could tell you with that condition and finally you know god in his grace and his mercy he knows me when to say enough is enough and i want to thank god for that too thank you for your prayers and god bless you all give god please this morning hallelujah glory to god that's a miracle church hallelujah i never heard of somebody going through multiple strokes and then saying when can i go home like a day later praise god not know anything's different praise the lord hallelujah amen like i said we don't know why sometimes these things happen but it's a testimony anyhow amen praise god let's try that little song as brother samuel comes amen we learned it a couple weeks ago um i don't know any better than jesus amen that's all just saying don't try to come to me with anything better or smarter i don't know any better than jesus he's good enough for me amen [Music] don't know any better friend someone on whom i can't depend to lighten my load comfort my soul no matter what comes no matter what goes when i have a problem he always knows the answer to why i love him so i don't know any better oh i don't know any better than jesus however compared he's better still better than what this world has to offer better than whatever it ever [Music] i don't know any better time to make jesus yours like i mean in mine come on now we cleanse you from sin and be unto them forever [Music] praise god well i don't this world has to offer better than whatever it ever will better than i could ever [Music] [Applause] [Music] one more time yes i don't know anything better than jesus however compared he's better still he's better than what this world has to offer he's better than whatever it ever will [Music] i don't [Music] amen hallelujah oh glad day when i was born again i was born [Music] the again i used to do i do them no more the sins i used to do them [Music] oh oh [Music] uh we want to i want to just mention uh i know that we can mention to the assignment already you've already given the envelopes and things like that before the special offering we're going to lift that special offering we'll come and take it here in just a moment um some of you have already done that it's a little bit of a different process of what we've been here in the past months but if you as you drove up out here today a little bit more of a visual what's going to be taken out things are going to be changed one thing that will be done with this with this project is we will you can see by the markings will actually gain a little bit of rumor with the parking as far as the width part from here over to that edge so that's a good thing as well we're waiting the brothers have been working to try to get bids and for anybody who's a contractor i know there's some subcontractors here and i told them i said i remember how it was when we build our first house it's it's i had to track them down and uh you know they probably got tired of seeing me they could probably tell all about here comes that guy but you know they it's just i don't know it just seems to be one of those things trying to track down and get quotes in here and they're working uh in any way that we can to try to get all the different quotes that we can get on it and just trying to take the that approach as well um i'm going to ask the brothers if they'll go ahead at this time and make their way up and we'll just pray over a special offer we're about to take for this we'll continue to do this every every second sunday of the month and uh we'll just come at this time that we'll just ask a word of prayer and i've got a couple more announcements that i'll make after this thank you for offering delicious guys heavenly father lord we thank you lord for this moment lord for this opportunity that we have in this hour lord to serve you to stand with you father god we lord [Music] how precious it is how we thank you lord for the testimonies thank you father god is our brother carlos stood here lord just to give a testimony of your faithfulness your loving kindness how good lord that you have seen lord our brother through and continuing the lord to see through it's just a testimony of your love and your care lord what you did for others what you've done for what you'll do for every one lord oh god just to trust you lord we thank you for that lord oh god it's you that's put that strength and that trust within us lord and we love you lord to you be all the glory as the song was sung this morning lord no glory of our home oh god but in you and you alone now father we pray that as we enter into a further part of this service as we look into the word we ask that you'll just direct our hearts direct lord god i pray father every part of this service as the lord you've already been lord guiding us

another meeting with you lord another experience lord a fresh experience with you lord god right here this morning we pray lord i pray that god is these endeavors lord that with this project that we've looked into lord just seeing the need lord as we've looked at this even over years lord knowing that it's a need and we just pray oh god knowing that you're still jehovah jireh and lord jesus we're nothing in ourselves but we ask that god that you and just the lord bless each and every one of your children lord may you take oh god the lord even of what is given and even over the time and just multiplying what god we pray father and guide and direct every part of this project lord for your glory lord may it be your wisdom lord we're looking to you father that even in the best laid plans that we can have we still lord place them in your hands and say if the lord wills and lord to know that it's you that opens doors closes doors and we ask that you'll guide us lord even to the right person lord who it is the lord that's to do this work lord we're simple enough to believe that oh god that you're interested in every detail of our life oh god and we value your leadership and your influence lord over every decision over every choice lord for it's all perfect in you lord lord we ask these things for the glory of god in jesus precious name amen amen god bless you this morning to give them to the lord i want to make mention here brother george smith mark willing will be here with us this coming thursday and then also there's coming in the coming announcements that would come from january and february and i know some of you have to know these things in order to get off work and things like that you want to be a part of those of the church fellowship and so there's fellowships we already have planned there for january coming up january the 16th january 16th is the sunday right before the holiday there so that's the first one to plan on we'll get those dates out to you by email i think that's it right here that i have wrote down but that doesn't mean that was covered amen you love the lord amen this is what happens when you get older but these aren't notes i need to tell you these are just things that comes to me and i have to put it down and then to preach so amen may god bless you this morning let's stand and let's turn in our bibles if we would to genesis 22 thank you musicians amen genesis 22. and i want to read a few verses of scripture here in genesis 22 11. do i have sound up here i don't have just give me this for the time being and then then tell me what i need to do with this with the earpiece if you don't mind if that's if the earpiece is a problem then go back and put batteries in the handheld by my desk if you don't mind brothers please genesis 22 11 and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abram abraham and he said here am i. and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do any anything unto him for i know for now i know that thou fearest god seeing that thou has not withheld thy son thine only son from me and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh as it had as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and has not withheld thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba now if you'll just go to galatians chapter 3 and i'm just going to read a few verses of scripture from there and then we'll let you have your seats in galatians chapter 3 verse 27 for as many as you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek neither is there bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you're all one in christ jesus and if you be christ then are you abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to just i want to just speak to you you didn't get this did you put batteries in here okay it's good okay thank you you have to really pray for me i don't like using handhelds i want to i want to speak continue on from thursday evening when we just just stepped aside and just looking at that thought but i want to deal with and speak in this manner unaltered and our response you know our response matters in every situation we're in i'd like to believe and i'd like to think that every time a challenge or a test it's working now okay it's all right i'll just leave this up here thank you god bless brother brian he runs so faithfully i probably need to buy him an ice cream sometimes he's constantly on it i love you amen i'm really happy now i'd love to believe that our response and we all would like we all struggle within ourselves so many times that we we we desire that our response would be a response that god himself would look down on and be able to say that's how i would have responded those are things that we we desire within our life and when we read about this here in genesis 22 if this is the only account and only part of abraham's life that we had then we could look at that and say my goodness that's a that's a lofty expectation but you have to remember that in abraham's in this response where it's come to a place that god has asked abraham for every thing that has been given to him everything that abraham's life is wrapped up in and god has asked him for everything now when we look at this how abraham responds within this time we have a little bit of a window by the word of god to go into and see that there were times of adversity that abraham faced within his walk with god that his responses were not always responses that god could say that's how i would have responded as a matter of fact it shows you and i you know even even in the part brother brown remember him saying very honest with us in souls in prison now he says i often wondered about many of those things in the scriptures how abraham could do this how sarah could do this and brother branham just he wraps it up in this manner for you and i of while god is so impressed upon his heart that he said if not for those things you or i would not know the grace of god now we know the grace of god in his saving grace for our soul if you've really experienced that saving grace to know that it was not you or i nothing we could do to merit to earn or or or to bring ourselves up to a place to be acceptable it's it's it's laying everything in at the cross and saying lord i lay my life down i repent lord and my sins and i accept your pardon lord that grace lord to come into my life and bring a full liberation a reality of the pardon i'm asking for but then as we go on in our life we you and i are in need not that we're terrible people but we are in need of the grace of god in every aspect and every time of our life i won't ask you here this morning that how many of us maybe even this morning or throughout this week there's been responses that those responses would not be responses you'd be up here nor responses that god could say that's my boy that's my daughter as a matter of fact there's no doubt been responses that we have had to say lord forgive me i'm sorry but this is what i want you to see thank god there is a place not only to come back to but a place that you are tied to in jesus christ that is an absolute that is an anchor that when your response or my response is off the mark there is a god that can bring us right back in life and make no mistake about it there will never be a test to a born-again child of god that they will fail you might fail it now but you are going to pass it because god in you has already overcome everything amen you're not made out of cheap material you're not made out of things of silver and gold you're made out of the stuff that cannot be blocked you're made out of the substance of that life that came out of the bloody sacrifice of the blood of the lamb that same life that stood faithful hallelujah so responses they matter you say look at abraham's life and i want you just to listen very carefully now we can look at this but when we look at things in abraham's life there were things decisions that even abraham had made and brother bram tells us even going down to egypt that first time he said lot never overcame that exposure now abraham was was as as a seed of god and this is what i want to say that you and i know that there are things that we have confidence in the life of god the seed of god but as a child of god we don't want exposure with the enemy and we realize we can see as a child of god that genesis 22 is speaking of a mature son and daughter of god and here here is the whole theme of that maturity is of my own self i can do nothing but victory is submitting oneself to what god has said in the word and that's the greatest battle that's that's the greatest battle that battle still rages in the lives in our hearts even as the word requires things of us sometimes and our flesh and our spirit can pull against it i'm talking about even after you've been born again there's a constant war paul wrote of this in the book of galatians the spirit lusteth against the flesh the flesh lusteth against the spirit but you say which one's going to win depends on which one that you are giving preeminence to or feeding the most strong i don't know about you but i believe i can speak for all of us i don't want to repent for missing or have to just stay in a cycle of repentance i want to stay in a place to say god i want to live under the influence i'm put here to manifest the glory of god he didn't save me just to be saving me he saved me because there's a purpose and i am determined by the grace of god to see that purpose all the way through anybody with me this morning on that our response our response an unaltered response and this is where that we can see even as we look in genesis 22 you can see this parallel in abraham's life how the prophet would take it and begin to show that abraham's life was even that progression of the church ages how god would deal with a man in in restoring and building back there under luther and wesley and pentecost and coming to the ministry of the son of man there in genesis 18 everything the power the full power of god restored to the church of the living god all this is laid out in abraham's life there was a type that would bring the believer to a mature faith now if we have come to a place a mature faith or the prophet would word it a perfect faith then we recognize there must be a perfect word and there comes a test that is allotted for the hour that you and i are living in and give me just a little bit more i don't know where they went but i need a little bit more up here you see you i feel like i'm yelling in a 5 gallon bucket out there you see here's the test when we look at the test on different things you know remember when um the sons of of zebedee they they called out to jesus and or the mother said uh grant that one of my sons will sit on the right and one on the left and jesus told them and said that's not up to me to give that that's already been predetermined your position your bed of time the message that you would come under all of those things was predetermined in the mind of almighty god that's why a previous word a previous message in itself it could deal with your heart but your heart was intended to receive the full expression of god in this hour and that's why you and i are here in this place and as that mother requested that let one said on the left that once said on the right and what if jesus said that those who will follow me in the regeneration of the son of man or that of the new birth the true baptism of the holy ghost that that that is given unto them you know that test that was spoken of in that hour is a test that was promised for the bride of jesus christ in this hour because it is in this hour where christ himself will bring to himself the bride that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world and down through the ages has been making a word upon word upon word you see this is an hour where the bible said he that overcometh i will grant the set with him in my throne even as i overcame and have sat down with my father in his throne is that right so this is a time of a bride test a time of a full word test a time where the very test of the word will come in its strength and its fullness and its power let me tell you something there's a people upon this earth that are tied to that word that are anchored to that word and it's christ inside of the believer by a living experience that's able to reflect that we are the bride of jesus christ we're living in an hour it's an unaltered it's a time where god in this hour where man has altered the word all the way down through the ages remember when jesus came he talked to that group of religious people in that hour and he told them he said because of your alterations you have made the word of god of none effect he's only me said i don't care if you're quoting moses or whatever you're doing you have made it of none of fact god doesn't need his word altered to get people in come on now we're talking about sons and daughters of god who are of the same dna of the same genealogy they don't need to be babied and petted in and promised positions and and everything else but a real child of god will stand right there on the word you say brother samuel this one offended me or this offends me hey let me tell you something jesus stood there that day and said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you it took a greater understanding because they could have stood there on the wall and challenged him are you with me leviticus on and on you shall not eat the blood of anything that's offered but it took an understanding and brother and sister it wasn't their intellects that understood it was the god who was present fulfilling his word in that hour and his children were upon earth and responding to that inspiration even when they didn't know what was going on they didn't know how to explain it but peter said i know this doubt that's the words of eternal life [Applause] hallelujah they had come and altered it you see when the word gets altered that's why brother branham said a false prophet produces false births is that right that's why brother brandon said when they rest and you know they rest upon we believe in emotion and all that i don't need to go through that you understand that but brother bryan said when you said you he said here they speak in tongues and they do this and they do that and he said and get out here and cut the hair and wear shorts and everything else that you can put that's ungodly he said and then you try to tell them they don't got the holy ghost why they're resting themselves upon the sensation the true holy ghost but it hadn't brought a real conversion on the inside when it brings a real let me tell you something real evidence of the holy ghost is there's no wavering on the word of almighty god it brings you in contact with the living god it brings you to a place that not just our lips but your life says amen to every word of god and if you can't say amen to every word of god you need the holy ghost i'm not saying that to put you down i'm telling you we're living in an hour that it's got to be alive that is able to recognize that it's a living christ who's in our midst that this word is not a man's word this is the word of almighty god and we must be tied and united with that word in a real experience with almighty god amen sister patsy good to see you preached here for i don't know how many minutes and i just god bless you notice this an unaltered this is our response we're living in a time in this hour as it talks about and i want to just kind of deal just for a few moments on the quality of this seed life the caliber of seed and we're talking about because we're living in an hour that is going to take more faith than it ever has and let me just say i'm not waiting on that faith to come it's here i'm not waiting on it to come i'm not waiting on the latter rain to come it's here man this is the final quickening unto the rapture come on now we we're not looking our way out and you got the church one oh we can just do this no we is to recognize our day and our visitation amen the quickening power of almighty god has come to the church of the living god it's not a man that can produce this kind of faith it takes god himself and when he gets among his children his children recognize him to be the same god they may not be able to explain everything they don't need to they recognize this is the living god and they want to be united with that god to where they can look in the face of death disease and whatever more and say god is still god [Music] in isaac remember israel in the natural failed they failed so this wasn't the natural seed of abraham come on now they crucified him they rejected him but this wasn't talking about the natural seed of isaac because it failed he was talking about that faith seed that royal seed that seed that would come straight from the loins of god's mind remember when abraham stood there abraham is testifying as a as a child of god and he says lord what will thou give me seeing that i'm childless and thou knowest one born in my house is heir shall this eleazar of damascus be the one and god speaks to him and lets him know you see what it is it's god's desire to express himself god took abraham's situation this situation was all laid out and through that situation where abraham is pouring out his heart he doesn't know that it's in tune with the heart and the mind of god that god's desire is to have an heir and god is not going to take a servant but he's going to have sons and the only way he can have sounds is its sounds that must come from his loins not the loins of a church not the loins of theology but from the loins of god himself where the holy ghost comes down and he makes that word alive on the inside and declares this is the son and daughter of god and god still remains god talking about an unaltered response this spiritual seed which is christ you see when we're looking at this and we're talking about this caliber this quality and looking where we're at in this hour in this time no wonder the scripture has it would read in the book of ephesians finally my brother put on the whole arm of god amen be clothed in the power of his might and having done all to stand stands sometimes you do all you know to do you pray right you take a problem you take the promise of god and it don't seem like nothing is moving but in the midst of that time is why it's important to have the foreigner of god and the form of god isn't something that you tack on the outside if you walk around and you tack it on like we do a bit no no no the full armor of god is what goes down on the inside it's the word of god on the inside the holy ghost inside of the individual the word inside of that life now think of this in this manner we we're looking at it here on thursday a little bit and i want to just just move back into a few of these places here just for a few moments and just to look here when you look at daniel as we were studying this here on thursday night and looking at it that daniel there was a trap that was set for him and daniel knew it was a trap these men could not find one flaw now i'm talking about even when it came to things of the kingdom they could not say you know what king you don't know daniel runs you down behind your back they couldn't find one thing but what they did say is there's no way that we're going to get this but we have got to trap him concerning the law of his god now they knew they knew enough about daniel's life a testimony he's not going to budge from the word i don't care what comes he's not going to deviate from it now remember i'm talking about the caliber and quality of seed life we're talking about maturity of the hour is that right sure they had all their weaknesses around them just like abraham had them throughout just like you and i are encompassed about with weakness but our focus is not upon the weakness we know we have them we know the struggles we have hey look in the life of the lord jesus when he came down to the end the bible said he feared in that he was heard with strong crying and tears asking if this be possible let this cut pass from me it wasn't that he wasn't a believer it wasn't that he wasn't the son of god the lamb of god it wasn't that at all but god listen to me now god was not a separate person god allowed himself to so merge into humanity so that god himself could know you and i and have kinship as brotherhood he allowed himself not he was made he allowed himself to condescend in such a way to feel what it's like to learn the cost of obedience the cost of obedience to the word our heart says amen to the word of god but there are challenging times that comes about but that this is where the inside man must be greater it must be the man that god himself has placed there himself on the inside of that life that gives us strength to prevail in the midst of that time so here's daniel you know a trap is set for him now daniel knows this trap is set brother bran tells us he walks humbly in this moment this is the seed of abraham now when they made this they made this stand remember in that time daniel he goes right to his house in daniel 6 10 if i could just read that when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house now that was something new this is what daniel did and his windows being opened in his chamber toward jerusalem i want you to catch this he had his windows open toward jerusalem i feel like preaching right now it's important to have yourself open toward the world it's important that your life is pointed toward the word that god has vindicated toward the living god you see daniel knew that sacrifice was laying in jerusalem because remember daniel was one of the children of captivity that preceded the whole conclusive captivity daniel was already down there in babylon daniel knew this though in going down there into babylon and daniel his life daniel said i don't care if i'm going to babylon i don't want to go to babylon but i'm going there but it ain't going to change my worship amen if there's somewhere you go that changes your worship then maybe you are not go are you with me if you're going somewhere and it wants to alter your worship alter your life then you better not go because if you can't go anywhere and take jesus then don't go if jesus ain't welcome i ain't welcome [Music] is that right amen let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity and all we do in word ordeal let it all be done in the name of jesus christ he had his windows open toward jerusalem well no doubt he had some screens in those windows too are you with me because you can't be letting just any kind of bugs get in your spirit come on you can't let any kind of bugs get in that affection gates of memory and reason and everything come on now you know how it is if you got your windows up in the summertime or whatever more and all of a sudden hear these ladybugs and you know bees and everything what do you start looking for you start looking is there a tear on the screen is there something or wrong along the edge why the screen is there so you can enjoy the air coming in but keep out the things you don't want this is why in our life our life is to be kept covered by the blood of jesus christ we want our responses to be word responses and god has given you and i an obligation keep the screen fortified in your windows there's things sometimes yes that we have to go out we have to do we have to walk out here in satan's evening among the world but let us have the screen of the baptism of the holy ghost that's on our soul let that be the filter of the word that leader when something comes we either accept it or reject it amen glory be to god amen oh he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did a four time so before the statue came daniel and you could have went in silent mode he wasn't doing this you know what i'm going to show them they can't do no that's what he was doing come on friends you know that's wrong there might be things you disagree with or whatever more but let me tell you even if what you disagree with is the right thing to disagree with if your motive and objective is wrong god sees that is that right if the motive and objective is wrong it's the same thing as not being the will of god but daniel had an excellent spirit the bible said daniel was a man of understanding when you study the man that is able wisdom knows when to hold his mouth knows when to say what he's able to be instructed and god had instructed him in a manner continue on daniel continued on daniel he had no wisdom this was a response that you see daniel was being tested you say how was daniel being tested now remember we looked at this a little bit on thursday night because you know many times when people say well i've got a hard trial well what's your trial well i lost my job well well the bootlegger out there can lose his job we're not making light of that you understand but we're talking about tests we're talking about tests on the work are you with me when when things come along because not only does this the here among us cancer can come in and have and god's brought deliverance is that right but cancer hit somebody out there god you know god never said well i'll keep cancer away from you he never said that in his word is that right but even the prophet in this hour never looked for that but god made his promise so real of what he promised back there that god said when it comes i will lift it from your life in other words it will not have power over you but you will have power over it is that right conditions and circumstances and things that come around understand that it's always an objective satan wants to try to take a time of a test and try to gain power over us but the test didn't come from the devil are you hearing me he don't have no say in it you say well brother samuel what about it when he came when he came to god concerning job god already knew let me tell you something god already knew the outcome of it that's why god could stand there and when he was talking about people god said let me tell you i got one of my boys down there that have you considered my servant job he didn't go talk to god about job god said here i got one for you have you seen him have you considered him you know what's happened god was having a testimony service there the devil he said shut up a minute have you considered him [Music] amen he has lot faithful with me no matter what has come his way even when his children were going a certain way look at him there offering that sacrifice over and over and over and over what's he standing on he's standing on my word have you considered him oh brother santa i want that kind of testimony are you sure because when god goes to testifying like that but after all we're talking about the patience of job the endurance of job is that right we're talking about not the dna of job not the dna of abraham not the dna of daniel not the dna of the hebrew children don't ever get your eyes on the dna of a man because the dna of a man will fail you come on now your own dna will fail you your own times in your own life that you say my goodness how could i have made this mistake my goodness this trap has come up your own your own dna you know you can't have confidence even in your own flesh it's because our only source of confidence and trust and hope is in the lord and that's why you must be born again to have an anchor in the god who cannot fail in a god who's there to move you and direct you that though you might fail but you're tied to an anchor and the same anger you're tied to will bring you and mature you to where when you face that test again you'll stand there as a son and daughter of god that's been under the maturing rays of the yes so here and be able to recognize the devil at his trip and say papa i need your strength right now [Applause] i'm talking about an altar our response hallelujah when the hebrew children they were down there you see all of this right here in the book of daniel and you know the book of daniel's a wonderful book my goodness how it unfolds everything regarding the god the visitation you know of the jews and that part into the gentiles the gentile image but remember every one of these great mysteries came also with battles and it was also with a lot of prayer and fasting somehow or another we've gotten away from that you know what you know the reason prayer is attacked is because we're in we're so used to instant gratification i need an answer answer i need an answer just talk on talk to dr google how do i fix the microwave but sometimes prayer you don't get an instant answer sometimes in prayer you've got to wake but it is not for nothing amen you're saying i'm praying that i ain't getting no answer stand there and knock and knock and knock and knock him out why am i knocking you're not knocking because you don't believe you're nothing because you're saying he's the one that has the answer i'm his son he's my papa and he will not give me a stove instead of a piece of bread he's a revelation to know who we're in the midst of it's a living god he's heard your prayer hallelujah an unaltered response what are you doing today it looked like your prayers ain't getting nowhere you've been praying for this praying for that i'm going to pray again matter of fact my windows are open toward heaven why you ain't had no rain come down from heaven but i'm got them open because rain's on the way just because the weather forecast hasn't said rain is coming it's already witnessed in my heart rains on the way so open up the windows amen open up the windows because the blessings of heaven belong to me as a child of god [Applause] amen i tell you daniel what you're doing you're doing the same thing you've done before done a four time oh glory be to god you see there was also some hebrew children here they were you know god had already revealed about this image this image that would come forth that was given there to nebuchadnezzar in a dream god unfolds it there to daniel and we see that those gentile world powers as it comes all the way down even to the hour we're living in where the iron and clay in the toes is that right god have a prophet on earth to identify we're living in the toes and the two big toes we're setting the new you in at that time is that right right khrushchev and eisenhower the two big toes it's at the end is that right gentile world powers but remember that image was the image of a holy man see satan's ride in taking over is a ride that comes through religious realm it's a religious ride is that right started out the white horse rider innocency begins to ride in innocency to want to try to take power from the church and he has to come in and do it by flatteries promise feel good things i don't want to feel good things my flesh wants to feel good things i'll just be honest with you yours does too but there's something in my soul that says i gotta have something more than i feel good when i'm going through the tests and the trial i've got to have god with skin on it i've got to have strength in my life that in the middle of that time there's a greater something on the inside than my horn here they were in daniel 3. god has not done this as gold that i'm more than anything than anybody else it is god's mercy is that right oh my i'll tell you what lessons we could learn right there when daniel when they were ready to kill all of them and daniel said stop being so flighty come on now daniel said hey you know what go tell the king quit being so hasty we can learn a little bit right there what got to happen right now oh my goodness oh my goodness i gotta have a decision right now oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness what are you doing maybe a form of exercise i don't know god don't work that way amen you're made as a channel of god and god cannot work through channels that are all twisted up and anxious as the bible says be still and know that i am god stand still and see the salvation of the lord amen if you're all twisted up we've all been there come on now maybe you were there this morning maybe that you were there yesterday hey don't let the devil beat you up about that just recognize that you can say god i'm asking right now as the son and daughter of god i take dominion over this temple amen come on now speak to that storm speak to that opposition amen hallelujah you're a son and daughter of god it has to obey your voice because your voice is veiling the authority of almighty god here was daniel the hebrew children in that time it was an image of a holy man brother bram tells us it was the image of daniel right right they wanted them all to bow to daniel holy man my brother brown ties that out you know the pope and goes on and on and on and on but we recognize it that we don't bow to the image of no man now i know some people take that so far and they'll use that to if they don't want to follow this or follow this they'll but i'm talking about to the child of god because we're not going by man anyhow come on now we've got to be in tune with the holy ghost the bible said to discern the body of jesus christ to discern the body is to discern the holy ghost that's working in our midst and working through the body of jesus christ according to his word is that right yes sir notice here they were in that time what are you going to do they called them up there you know these we we know these things right we know them but this is a time of application where we're at right now you see because what they're being tested on is the word that's what we're saying before testing is on the word daniel was being tested brother brown tells us like this i read it to you on thursday he was being tested if he would stand on the word that god has spoke through solomon if thy people be in trouble in any place and you know the rest of the story but they will look toward thy holy temple i will hear from heaven come on now he was being tested on that word how many how many how many have been tested on word and have forsaken the word because of emotions because of flesh come on now how many in the days right here when the three hebrew children were tested let me tell you something everybody who went and worshiped and fell down before that image they were not all heavens there was many jews millions of them brother ram tells us this was a church in that day made up of four daniel and the three who brewed children don't get worried and scared about that you to know whom you have believed and persuaded that he is able to keep you amen you recognize the living god recognize who is in your midst your trust is not in the arm of flesh your trust is not here so man your trust is in the word of god because if you get your eyes on a man i don't care who it is if that man believes the word then you leave that man even if it's me you lead that man if he leaves the word amen because this word is everything this word is jesus christ [Music] hallelujah we don't know about personalities or how long it is or how long that we stay with the word of god to hear the voice of almighty god speaking to us personally how are you boys when the music's being played i would've heard you you're not bowing yeah yeah yeah okay you've heard right yep you've heard right so these guys weren't out there with picket signs they weren't under that anointing come on now they knew that kingdoms days were numbered but they were part of another kingdom and in that kingdom its days are no him [Applause] you see what kingdom are you going to give your strength to amen what kingdom do you want to see build up in your life the kingdom of this world the kingdom of whatever your last name is or the kingdom of god i want to see the kingdom of god build up in my life and then what you want to see i want to see that pyramid build up in my life jesus christ reflected that tabernacle of god where the virtues are pouring out in our lives i hear you guys ain't worshiping no no we're worshipping or you are yeah but witness not we're not worshipping according to these dictates we're worshiping according to the word which was before the dictates the king got angry he had an anointing on him he had an anointing on him he got angry and he told them are you gonna think about it shadrach meshach and abednego i don't believe they were bodybuilders i don't believe that i don't even believe that looks like some of the people they got muscles here hey if the count if the qualification is right brother bram tells us that jesus was a spindly looking fellow bible said no beauty we should desire him because it wasn't an earthly power that's right it was heavenly power so you know they call the strongest men in there to bind them why do you need the strongest guys to bind them you know god's making a testimony they told the king they said we don't have to think about this we're not bound we are going to stand on the word of god he's able to deliver us whether he will or not we're going to be delivered either way you know what they were testifying no matter the circumstance i got joy in my soul god is in control come on now they have victory come on church you can't wait when i get out of fire glory to god i'm gonna have victory have victory while you're facing the fire have victory while you're in the fire how can i do that cause you've got the victory of the holy ghost on the inside of your life who have you been fellowshipping with come on church you can't fellowship with the things of the world well i know this good bible program i know this you can't fellowship with the things of god or the things of the world you've got a fellowship with the things of almighty god how can you turn to those things out there and you claim to be born again of the spirit of god i'm not doubting that you are but if you are you know your source of strength and you will feed on the unfailing word of almighty god brother samuel i can't seem to listen to a tape right now i rebuke that line devil in the name of jesus christ he's a liar you put it on and you watch an atmosphere change cold church we're not walking by reasoning we're walking by dust saith the lord what is our response unaltered my time what are you doing trying to catch my breath here they stood those three hebrew children you know brother branham i love how he breaks in and dramatized that brother dave i love it he said what their testimony was they broke in and said you know what we had a test we had a prayer meeting last night no they didn't get on facebook and see who could sympathize with them preach brother samuel your strength is not in facebook oh i i i'm listening to dr so-and-so what about dr jesus what about jesus if he was good enough to clean you up and save your soul and fill you with the holy ghost he ought to be good enough in every heart time in every situation that comes your way i'm telling you he's a friend that's sticking closer to my brother our response unaltered here they walked in there they bound them you know sometimes we wonder why things come our way we do look at the hebrew children oh they must have been doing something wrong no sometimes as it was with a man who was born blind that thinking was there among the disciples what did this guy do what did his parents do because they know in his diseases and sickness can be passed down and they knew that but jesus said no no no this was not because anybody sinned this was because of an opportunity for the word of god to be made manifest and god had the strongest men to bind them and the strongest men the strongest soldiers was going to take them there it speaks of the hour we're living in brother branham would tell us in the message contest satan he said is getting more powerful and more powerful and more powerful and more powerful come on it ain't bragging on the devil we ain't taking no hold he don't have no muscle power no no he's more powerful but this is god's answer in this hour i'm the unaltered god my dynamic power is still the same i don't got to change one word hallelujah just let me get inside of my children i'll defeat every devil i'll take their flesh i'll take their life i'll overcome i'll stand in the middle of their life all you see is flesh standing there but in the middle there's a hidden man that is standing there with a foot upon the land and a foot upon the sea they've got the authority of this world in their life amen they receive of the holy ghost brother the holy ghost ain't a sensation it ain't a feeling you might have that and that's all good and fine i love emotions i love to feel it but i'm talking about standing there when the world is breaking away all around you and you've got something in the midst of that time that's able to say i don't know how i'm gonna make it but i know that god is able [Music] [Applause] [Music] we need supermen and women we got a super god a supernatural one that's giving us a super sin hello sometimes you gotta press a little bit is that right sometimes you gotta press a little bit we're tested right what's our response going to be there's times even in standing right here i don't feel like standing here sometimes it's tiny i got pain all the way down my side i don't feel like standing here time standing and sitting in the office and everything else i'm not taking away from that but i say this to you not to put anybody down come on you know enough but it's to say sometimes we're tested things aren't always easy but what will our response be how can we stand in the face of those of hebrews 11 and the face of those down through time and they stand there where some of them they were ripped to pieces come on brother timothy preached that last week you had others that boy we all would have signed up for that whole walls come down and everything else but how many would have stood up and said well hey you know i'm going to be a daniel oh my yeah i'll be a daniel delivered from the lions but how many would have said yeah i'll be those who delivered from the lions but it wasn't like daniel was eaten but god's word didn't fail sometimes when it seems like something is overtaking you a sickness or a disease brother samuel i've been addressing the things don't stop addressing it keep drawing strength from el shaddai and stand there toe to toe because you know as a believer that god's word can't fail and god is the word so what are you boys going to do well so here they throw them in there but after they got in there think about it the guys who threw them in brother and them guys got burned up you know why amen glory they weren't built to face the fire well i feel like i felt like doing a little praise break you know why that's why brother brandon said boy about about got beside myself on thursday before i got out here brother brown said how do you fight fire you fight fire with fire and the way you fight fire with fire is called backfiring you see the oncoming fire and you go ahead and put fire right here and you consume every bit of material that could possibly catch on fire that's why the baptism of the holy ghost is the living power of almighty god it consumes the world it consumes the desires out of your life and it makes you a place that though the fire encroaches brother it's a living fire on the inside that'll fight that fire greater is he that is in me unaltered that's our response [Music] he sees a fourth man in there brother brian if they had never went into that fire they'd have never had that kind of testimony they came out of that fire they had a new experience you see to believers it's not looking at tests even though in our flesh come on now our test boy can you know oh man oh lord oh my goodness all right our flesh come on now the flesh is weak but the inside mind that strength on the inside that it can maybe only words you can crawl out at that time is lord i need help lord i'm discouraged lord i need strength right now i need encouragement lord and god right here i am here i am right right right here i am right here i am it was a fresh experience and when they came out of there you know they came out of there that didn't even look like they had been in the fire you know how it is we get close to the grill sometimes this gets burnt these hairs get burnt is that right they came out of there and you man y'all don't even smell like you've been through a test it wasn't that they had some super close come on they didn't have space suits from nasa they had a god on the inside the james god on the inside is the same god that knew him from their mother's womb the same god that brought adam on top of an animal on top of adam it's the same god who was there that held them in that hour and the fire itself had no power over them but they had power over the fire you ever think about this god never came down and put the fire out oh god put the fire out oh god put the fire out oh god come on now and our flesh we'd have been praying that wonder haven't had shadrach meshach and abednego in my rain right oh man i'll tell you if it rains oh my there might have been one rain but see god didn't do away with the fire sometimes the very things we're praying for oh god get rid of this oh god get rid of that god get rid of it and god's giving a test whether we're going to stand on his word amen well brother samuel if i felt better brother samuel if i had more victory in my life let's just put it like this say god i'm not going to give you no more excuses amen because what it really is is i need more of you if you already have a living power a living portion on the inside where your life has been saying don't get don't don't be too prideful to say god i need more of you i need another refilling of the holy ghost there's been some leakage in my life i've not been praying like i ought to pray i've not been reading like an artery i'ma talk about don't make it laborious but god i've not been drawing strength from you the way that i need to he is your source of strength let me tell you friends you could speak to me a month of sundays and unless you receive the word of god and feed on that word it'll never do you any good that's right i love you as your pastor i'm here to help anybody that i can to direct you along the way but god never sent me here to replace the holy ghost i'm not your holy ghost i'm only a tool in the hand of god that god would use to speak to you and reveal his love and his care and his mercy and direct to direct in your life and speak of things that's going on call things out ahead of time and where things are about ready to make a decision the spirit of god can come right down through the word and send an influence of the holy spirit on your life turn from that don't go that way amen daniel wasn't on the scene it's time for them to make a stand but in the midst of that time they made a stand god didn't remove the fire but god gave him grace to go through it daniel in the lion's den here's daniel you know the king the bible says this in daniel 6. the king he knew what that men had done the bible says that he knew and the bible says he he he tried to deliver daniel right true but the law of the media's of purge persons once you write it it cannot be altered right you know that in the book of daniel also an esther so that word cannot be altered that's come out but there was another word that was before that word ever came about that was a way that had already made its way into the heart and life of a believer and that word was the kingdom that word was power that word gave strength for daniel to be able to look past that word and say there's another word you're a king but i've got the word of the king come on the swords in my hands come on that representation out there in sabino canyon was not just for the prophet in this hour but all who will come under the authority of the revelation in this hour and be filled with the same spirit of god and be united with that word you walk as a child of god with the sword in your hand come on now the sword has been delivered to the church of the living god and had not been delivered by a church it was not delivered by man god himself came down in the ministry of malachi 4 and anointed a church for rapture and overcoming power and that sword is placed in the hand in the authority in the heart in the life of the believer hallelujah daniel is your god able to deliver you what's his testimony whom thou servist continually in other words daniel i know your life your knife's not your life's not a hit and miss it's not a hit and a miss in the kingdom right but then again he wouldn't like brother and said it's okay to miss a day of work but don't miss church i mean we still believe that don't we or has that been altered come on now we're talking about an unaltered word unaltered here is daniel walks into that lion's den it's placed in there a seal is placed upon it and i know you know the story the account of it but here it is put it to where it's your life and you've walked in to a lion's den remember paul dealt with individuals that weren't exactly lions but paul could speak i've been delivered out of the mouth of lions that which was in opposition to the word of god and satan is in opposition to the word of god that's enthroned in your life and here was daniel in that moment the next morning man the king was up all night he comes down there daniel daniel king didn't need an alarm that morning when he no longer he was waiting he went down there daniel said live okay let me just tell you right now god hath sent his angel what you say daniel i'm telling you i've had fellowship down here you have fellowship down there all you see i've already been in fellowship under the blood and i've taken that experience down here daniel what was it like i love how brother brown describes it daniel's in a testimony meeting and he says all of a sudden he said i started feeling he said every fiber of my body started quivering he said i was standing there he said i could hear the pads of those lions walking i could hear him coming up next to me he said but i said there was something came over every fiber of my being i felt a tingling felt this i felt sensation and he said before you know what he said they started just turning away he said i looked over in the corner and there stood the son of god oh glory you see what it was what he sensed what he sensed was not just a feeling it was the presence of the angel of the lord and you know what god was saying you've stood for me i'm going to stand first when the hebrew children made their stand god let them make it he said you stood for me now i'm going to stand for you i tell you if there's nothing else many things that you know that could take from this service this morning encouragement to say god if your responses have not been responses that's been according to the word and things that you could say lord i i'm thankful for that and no doubt all throughout this building we could we could testify to that but i would look to the grace of god this morning and say god i want to renew and i lord jesus want to be able to stand there with an unaltered response i want to stand there with that kind of a heart that's able to stand in that moment and if you're here this morning and you don't have that victory on the inside don't wait for it accept it down into your life it'll give you strength in your life to stand against the wiles of the enemy because it gives you a strength on the inside oh sure sometimes pressures can come and you might have friends here have this one here and say well what about this in your life or or this family member can come but there's a greater love on the inside the love of god has taken preeminence above every other love and you're fellowshipping under the blood of jesus christ this is what quite an hour to live quite an awesome time to live in we're living in the hour of paradox living in the hour where these bodies are to be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye amen oh let us walk unaltered let our response be unaltered let us look and say evaluate every response everything in our life and say god let me just be so under the influence of you lord jesus in my life from my soul that every response that no matter how tough the time may be or the test may be my life and my walk is not altered and dictated by statutes of time but let my life be governed by the word of god for it will never pass away amen amen heavenly father lord jesus thank you this morning lord thank you lord for your mercy thank you lord for speaking to us to encourage us lord to let us know to let us know lord as paul could write if god be for us who could be against us to give us strength lord in this hour in these moments lord god i pray you'd help each and every one of us i pray heavenly father if there's one that doesn't know you in that real personal way maybe lord in their life it's it's been something that they can look at and say god i don't want an up and down life i don't want an in and out life i don't want a life that depends on whether the sun is shining or it's raining outside skies are covered over i i don't want to depend upon the natural elements i don't even want a life that depends upon candlelight in the inner court because that candlelight can be blown out lord i want an experience that's deeper than my flesh than my spirit i want to experience this down in the depths of my soul granted lord this morning may it be the earnest that would rise up in that heart lord to purpose in their heart and life that that promise is mine and that promise i'm going to lay hold on that by surrendering all that i am the lord i want you lord to be enthroned in my life grant that lord i pray this morning [Music] lord forgive us [Music] lord we don't take these things lightly we want to grow we want to mature we realize lord that we don't mature overnight sometimes lord we see that even in the natural progression in natural life every one of us lord has come through those stages in life where we thought we knew everything we thought we knew this and thought we knew that lord it's so amazing that even as the order that i get and even when my daddy is not here with me i can look back and think back over counsel i can think back over things that he told me when i was a boy things that he told me lord when i began to pastor on and on and on lord jesus but i'm so thankful for your grace that lord just as it was with abraham and sarah there's nothing that they could look back on and say they they couldn't and say every one of my responses were right on the money but yet lord there's one thing that never deviated they were tied to that word and when something was wrong in your presence they were willing to make it right [Music] they were willing lord to be realigned lord jesus help us as fathers mothers brothers sisters husbands wives on and on and on lord god i pray may the windows of our home may the windows of our home may not be windows that's open to sodom may not be windows without screens that just lets every influence of the world in but god may there be screens that are put up screams lord god of the filter of the word of god lord jesus are realizing that even as parents we need that discernment of the holy ghost lord in this hour we need to be very vigilant very intentional not just his parents but in every every one of us that's here we must be vigilant in this hour because as the scripture said that satan is as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour he'd love nothing more than to swallow up your walk with god he'd love nothing more than to swallow up where victory only becomes something of a past memory by the samuel what should i do well right now i i would i would look to god and i would say lord forgive me for neglecting my walk with you [Music] well brother samuel but i thought that greater is he that's in me he is greater but also remember the prophet told us he said if you don't feed the holy ghost in your life it'll die now the holy ghost is god he can't die but what does he mean we're losing the effectiveness of how you should live as a son and daughter of good your life was meant to live and walk in victory and if satan has stolen that from you stolen joy from your life look who stole it from you what do i do take it back take it back how do i take it back you take it back just as it was taken from you little by little you take it back even at this moment set your heart and a purpose before god that i'm going to take back those times i'm not going to compromise on times opportunities i'm not going to compromise on the word of god [Music] oh my granted lord jesus granted lord i pray [Music] lord we thank you for your mercy oh my just the sweetness of your holy spirit lord god your mercy lord right here this morning lord god you're the same god right here this morning lord that came right there to daniel that came right there lord god in the fiery furnace you're the same god right here this morning lord jesus you didn't remove the lines you didn't remove the fire but you came and stood in the midst of the fire you stood in the midst of the lions sometimes lord with things that different ones the lord as they go through satan sometimes can beat them up and want to tell them well if you really have faith you still wouldn't be suffering with that back condition if you really had faith you wouldn't be dealing with this right now he's a liar [Music] paul dealt with conditions in his eyes over and over and over again but paul realized paul never stopped praying but paul realized this is not going to dictate how i'm going to conduct myself as a child of god i will glory in my infirmities that the power of christ might rest upon my life [Music] lord jesus may they just invite you lord i invite you that as you stood with them in the fire stood with them in the lion's den that god that you're standing with me lord then lord jesus your word remains true you're the lord that healeth all our diseases whenever my healing will come whatever moment that it's manifested in whether it's manifested in this life or the life to come i am going to stand with the testimony unaltered that god is my healer god is my deliverer god is my joy god is my happiness he is my delight he is my refuge granted lord jesus unaltered is our response granted lord this morning i pray oh thank you father thank you jesus oh my oh my could we just raise our hands oh my maybe it's been a while since you raised your hands but let remember what the hand is erasing and signification of i surrender lord i surrender i lord i can't make things happen lord i i just surrender to your word lord god remember how the prophet told us in the message contest the strength of the church is to accept the word of god to just accept it and stand on it it's our promises he gave them to us he made them with us in mind so we must stand and be sour unaltered unaltered our response oh hallelujah don't you love him [Music] oh my god let's just stand if you'd like to stand if you need to sit that's fine as well amen let's just take a few moments here let's just worship oh my i'd say they really had a time right there in the fiery furnace and no doubt they had a time and the lion's den [Music] sometimes you know i know as i speak throughout different ones every one of us here there's been times that maybe you didn't even have voice to sing a song maybe there's things that you didn't even you couldn't even move your hands to clap your hands maybe your legs you didn't have strength to be able to stand up but it's something about how you can begin to just think of the lord you just start to think about it hallelujah as you begin to dwell on him and begin to think of his goodness there's a song maybe a scripture or just maybe just lord i love you and all of a sudden you better know what i'm talking about he just moves right in like that what is it it's the same god who was in the lion's den [Music] it's the same god it's not about our voice it's not about even the position of our body it's unaltered our response and here he comes in the midst of that time oh my paul and silas it wasn't a fitting setting to have a worship service matter of fact in their body it wasn't a fitting time in their body they had their clothes was sticking to them they had been beaten right but in the midst of that time they just started to praise the lord it might have started with just a little amen god every they may not even been in temple eventually they got going amen how they begin to think upon him think upon his goodness think upon his mercy and invite him amen nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness i dare not trust [Music] [Applause] is [Music] seems to hide his face i rest on his unchanging grace [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] when he shall come [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] walk i stand all over the ground is [Music] [Music] no turning

i crossed over [Music] i'm so glad i crossed over in time well i'm so glad i crossed over the line i'm so glad i crossed over [Applause] [Music] surely had my soul lost and bound through god's grace and mercy his grace turned me around i'm so glad i crossed over in time that separates darkness [Music] [Applause] oh satan was standing between my soul and the light but jesus gave me a lot to shine when he saved this soul of mine and i'm so glad i crossed over in time yes i'm why don't we just have the present daniels and the press and hebrew children amen daniel what would you say i'd say the same thing they are amen what are you going to say i'll say the same thing daniel said amen oh my we're living in a different hour but we're still the same god amen we will not bow to the enemy we will not bow to the world amen we will only prostrate our lives to the living god amen well i'm so glad i crossed over the line [Music] i crossed over the line i talk about the lines that separates the darkness [Music] yes i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them [Music] it is i'm one of i can them i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm one of them [Applause] foreign [Music] well i'm so glad i can say
