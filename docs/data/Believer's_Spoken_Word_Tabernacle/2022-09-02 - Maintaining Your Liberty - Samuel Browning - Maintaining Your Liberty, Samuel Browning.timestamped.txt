[40:41] back and forth into Mexico right across
[40:44] the border each time to go in for the
[40:46] services and just the Lord just just met
[40:50] wondrously
[40:51] just the reports and reports and

[41:04] thankful to be back home
[41:05] just thankful for your prayers I know it
[41:08] was the prayers of the Saints and I
[41:10] could just sense it just as I was was
[41:12] going from here and then when we sat
[41:15] down there and heading into that first
[41:18] service and just such a liberty just
[41:21] came and just moved right there and just
[41:23] the Lord ministered right from the
[41:25] get-go to many needs and so it just it's
[41:29] just I you were a part of it
[41:31] you are part of all along and I want to
[41:34] say God bless you you may not see those
[41:38] brothers and sisters on this side but we
[41:40] get to the other side you you were part
[41:42] of
[41:43] it wasn't just me standing there we're
[41:46] depending on him it's God working
[41:47] through a body
[41:48] amen so you are part of that and I want
[41:52] to just say God bless you amen and they
[41:54] brother Benito asked me to the
[41:56] congregation there asked me to greet you
[41:59] and just to extend their their greetings
[42:02] to you as well
[42:03] so we just want to
[42:06] look into the word of the Lord and as
[42:08] we're turning to Galatians chapter 5
[42:10] tonight I'm just going to read a verse
[42:13] of scripture and then we'll let you have
[42:14] your seats I want you to remember
[42:16] brother Nathan Erickson will be here
[42:19] this coming Sunday the Lord willing and
[42:21] then um
[42:23] the following weekend we're having
[42:25] Services here brother Trevor Eman and
[42:29] remember he he was here in January and
[42:31] spoke for us and just a wonderful
[42:34] service and we have that morning service
[42:36] and then we're going to have the youth
[42:39] service and I'm just asking you to be as
[42:42] you are in prayer for every service but
[42:44] just praying that God will just move in
[42:46] a very special way
[42:48] amen we we desire to see the Lord just
[42:51] move and I just appreciate your support
[42:53] in that I know the young people do I'm
[42:55] going to be here pulling and just to
[42:57] just to get behind it amen so I just I
[43:01] want to say I appreciate that as well
[43:04] um I don't think there's any other
[43:05] announcements if there is somebody can
[43:07] slip me a note
[43:09] but let's look into the word of the Lord
[43:11] tonight in Galatians chapter 5 and verse
[43:14] 1.
[43:16] Paul's writing here to the galatian
[43:18] church Stand Fast therefore in the
[43:23] Liberty wherewith Christ have made us
[43:26] free and be not entangled again with the
[43:31] Yoke of bondage
[43:33] I just like to speak just a few moments
[43:36] tonight on maintaining your Liberty
[43:39] and may God bless you bless the reading
[43:41] of the word as you're being seated
[43:46] in second Corinthians chapter 3 and
[43:49] verse 17 Paul would speak of this this
[43:52] of Liberty
[43:54] it says now now the Lord is that spirit
[43:58] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[44:01] there is Liberty
[44:04] and I believe that that's the desire of
[44:07] our hearts is that the spirit of the
[44:10] Lord would be welcome
[44:12] here in the congregation
[44:15] welcome in our homes cars on and on
[44:19] but most importantly is that
[44:22] he's here
[44:24] because where the spirit of the Lord is
[44:26] there is Liberty
[44:29] and so
[44:30] how important it is what brings Liberty
[44:33] is the preaching of the Gospel
[44:36] not just reading of a scripture or
[44:38] reciting it but brother Branham was very
[44:40] clear about this as Paul would say that
[44:43] our word that our gospel came not to you
[44:47] in word only
[44:48] but it came through Power and
[44:50] demonstration that as the word itself
[44:53] was being ministered
[44:55] the word was going forth as a sharp
[44:58] two-edged sword and it was cutting away
[45:00] diseases cutting away sin because the
[45:04] word is creative
[45:06] and the thing that we we look at and
[45:08] remember is that
[45:10] in anything that takes place in our life
[45:13] that is of god it's not because of what
[45:16] we have done it's because of God's
[45:19] creative power working in our lives
[45:24] we everything that we that has taken
[45:26] place we can go clear back to Genesis
[45:28] one with it it's the same way God speaks
[45:31] his word the presence of God comes down
[45:34] moving behind that word and it's God who
[45:37] brings forth creation brings forth those
[45:40] things that we have in our life or those
[45:43] things that we desire think about
[45:45] brother Branham I begin to just this
[45:47] quote is something that I think on very
[45:50] often have come back to over the years
[45:52] and I just was thinking of it just the
[45:54] other day was praying and that is at the
[45:57] end of recognizing your day and its
[45:59] message and brother Branham makes a
[46:00] statement and he says he says God let me
[46:03] be the Revival
[46:05] let that Revival be in me and he makes
[46:08] this statement he says Lord create in me
[46:11] what is lacking
[46:14] because it's it's things that you and I
[46:17] can see as we look into the word but we
[46:21] need him and invite him God you come and
[46:25] create what I'm lacking create that
[46:27] desires let your life pass by and stir
[46:31] up because you know what I need Lord and
[46:34] there's a longing in my life but you
[46:36] know and I I'm inviting you Lord that
[46:39] you'll come and create in me what is
[46:43] lacking in my life Lord
[46:45] and this is where Paul is is speaking to
[46:48] us where the spirit of the Lord is
[46:50] that's real Liberty real true Liberty
[46:53] goes more than just having Liberty of
[46:55] the house of God we thank God for that
[46:57] because that Liberty itself will point
[47:00] you and direct you to that Liberty that
[47:04] belongs to you as the Son and Daughter
[47:05] of God because the real word Liberty
[47:08] means to be what you really are you are
[47:12] always the Son and Daughter of God
[47:14] but you are under and under a bondage
[47:17] under you know you can you can try to
[47:19] live it and try to go through this but
[47:21] there's a liberty that only can come
[47:24] through and by the spirit of almighty
[47:27] God coming down into the depths of your
[47:30] soul and he brings forth the
[47:32] transformation and that same God that's
[47:35] brought forth that transformation that
[47:37] Supernatural work then Paul says in
[47:40] verse 18 we all with open face beholding
[47:44] as in a glass the glory of the Lord is
[47:47] dealing with us looking at and beholding
[47:51] God's working looking in the word as it
[47:54] was in there in Israel they would take
[47:56] that of like the brass plates and that
[47:58] was the mirrors that they would look at
[48:00] and be holding they would look in there
[48:03] and that's what Paul says when we are
[48:05] looking we're not beholding another we
[48:08] are beholding the glory of the Lord
[48:11] and the reality is is that all we have
[48:13] to do is behold be captivated and
[48:17] there's so many things to distract us
[48:19] and try to take our time and try to take
[48:21] our mind thoughts and everything else
[48:23] Satan is after to try to pull us away
[48:27] from his presence but the scripture has
[48:31] its so beautifully stated with an open
[48:34] face beholding us in a glass the glory
[48:36] of the Lord as we're beholding him
[48:38] beholding him we are changed into the
[48:42] same image from glory to glory even is
[48:45] by the spirit of the Lord because the
[48:48] image that's been set before you and I
[48:50] is not a lifeless image it's the person
[48:53] of Jesus Christ that's who we're
[48:56] beholding that's who we're having
[48:58] fellowship with when you're praying and
[49:00] not just on your knees but when you're
[49:02] praying through the day when you're
[49:03] listening to the message when you're
[49:05] into the scriptures you're walking
[49:06] through the stores you're riding in your
[49:08] car and you're talking to you're
[49:10] fellowshipping with him you're
[49:11] meditating on him you are beholding with
[49:14] an open face the glory of the Lord and
[49:17] though you may not feel it but you
[49:19] recognize his presence and there's a
[49:21] love on the inside there's a there's a
[49:23] joy from having Liberty that is is
[49:26] unexplainable it's it's Indescribable
[49:29] because it's God and you cannot describe
[49:32] God but it's just a liberty to where you
[49:34] know that there's no strings attached to
[49:37] your life that what was once you were
[49:40] yoked to now the spirit of God has come
[49:43] by your way and let you know hey look at
[49:46] your ankle like Johnny Crowe was always
[49:48] tied to the fence and he always walked
[49:51] that fence and walked that fence but
[49:53] somebody came and loosened him he kept
[49:55] walking that fence but one day somebody
[49:57] came along and pointed out to him hey
[50:00] you don't have to walk this way no more
[50:03] there you are free
[50:06] and God lets you and I look into our
[50:08] lives and recognize that Liberty that
[50:11] has come to you and I and that Liberty
[50:14] that has lifted us above our natural
[50:16] birth
[50:18] what Grace is this what Liberty
[50:20] and we are changed into the same images
[50:23] from glory to glory even it's by the
[50:24] spirit of the Lord the Bible says in
[50:26] John 5 24 he that heareth my word and
[50:29] believeth on him that sent me hath
[50:31] everlasting life and shall not come into
[50:33] condemnation but is passed from Death
[50:37] unto life
[50:39] he that heareth my word understandeth my
[50:42] word to take that into and they'll hear
[50:44] an understanding of the word of God let
[50:46] me just say it like this it isn't about
[50:48] understanding all the p's and q's but
[50:51] hearing the word is being able to hear
[50:54] his voice and to know he's speaking to
[50:57] you to know that it's God speaking
[51:00] personally to you that there's more than
[51:02] a man that's present in the building
[51:04] that the Living God is present right
[51:07] here among us because a man's word can't
[51:10] do that to you but God's word when you
[51:12] can recognize that it's God that's here
[51:14] in our midst that it's God that's
[51:16] speaking to you and I don't say it like
[51:18] this that if if you can't see that yet
[51:20] I'll Stand and I'll pray for you I'll
[51:23] pray for others say God open their eyes
[51:25] that they can see Lord that it's you
[51:27] that's here that there's more for them
[51:30] than there is against them
[51:32] there's a God who is present who always
[51:35] was he's present right here Among Us
[51:39] notice this is part of that Liberty that
[51:41] is passed from Death unto life in Romans
[51:44] 8 chapter chapter 8 verse 1 and 2 there
[51:47] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[51:50] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[51:53] after the flesh but after the spirit
[51:55] notice not walking after this flesh but
[51:58] after the spirit seeking to do those
[52:01] things that please him
[52:04] there's no condemnation for the law of
[52:07] the spirit of Life In Christ hath not
[52:10] set me free
[52:12] hath made me free
[52:14] this is a creative work of the power of
[52:18] almighty God because if he sets you free
[52:20] you'd be the same person you always were
[52:23] is that right but he comes to make you
[52:25] free that's that's the whole theme of
[52:28] The Gospel is the creative power of
[52:30] almighty God that has come forth to make
[52:33] you a new creation in Christ Jesus so
[52:36] for the law of the spirit of life in
[52:38] Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
[52:41] law of sin and death in John 8 36 if the
[52:44] son therefore shall make you free ye
[52:48] shall be free indeed now remember this
[52:52] was something that the the the religious
[52:54] in that day had a problem with they
[52:56] looked at their garments or to say the
[52:59] vesture of their birth had come out of
[53:01] Abraham I'm of Abraham's lineage what do
[53:04] you mean that that I need to be made
[53:05] free what do you under they didn't
[53:07] unrecognize that though everything that
[53:10] was given was looking forward to the
[53:13] real perfect sacrifice and you still
[53:15] needed to be made free
[53:17] there had to come a freedom and they
[53:20] weren't free
[53:21] and this is where the word come to speak
[53:24] to them and let them know that if the
[53:27] son shall make you free you shall be
[53:30] free indeed Beyond imagination
[53:34] not something that's just in our mind
[53:37] but but a reality that I'm free
[53:40] I'm no longer the same person that I
[53:43] used to be
[53:45] God has changed my life
[53:48] he's the theme of my life he's the one
[53:51] that I seek to please the one that I
[53:54] desire to serve it's his word that there
[53:57] is a life on the inside that can say
[53:59] Amen to every word of God even when I
[54:02] can look at it and say Lord I say man to
[54:05] the word help me to become what I'm
[54:07] seeing Lord
[54:10] don't back away from it because the word
[54:12] is here to change us that's part of our
[54:14] Liberty that's part of maintaining
[54:16] Liberty is when the spirit of God comes
[54:19] by and he deals with our life submit to
[54:21] him right there because it is your
[54:23] Liberty as a son and daughter of God and
[54:26] the spirit of God sweeps right down to
[54:28] bring change in your life things that
[54:31] you've taught you would never be able to
[54:34] override but the spirit of God comes and
[54:37] energizes you from another Realm
[54:42] you're made free by the Sun
[54:48] it says why I want to come to as we
[54:50] spring from here in Psalms 119 45.
[54:53] and I will walk at Liberty
[54:57] for I seek
[54:59] thy precepts
[55:02] now
[55:04] in maintaining our Liberty you can
[55:08] see where
[55:09] Israel when they'd come into the land
[55:12] here
[55:13] we've looked at that of Jericho
[55:15] they had to follow the word remember God
[55:18] gave them Direction
[55:19] that the word is what was going to lead
[55:22] the way
[55:23] not their feelings but the word
[55:26] you can't get around the word the word
[55:29] must be first
[55:31] and God let them know that the ark has
[55:33] got to come before you the word has got
[55:36] to come before you this is why this is a
[55:38] scriptural principle seek ye first the
[55:41] kingdom of God putting God first above
[55:43] whatever desire whatever ambition let me
[55:45] tell you something you cannot even
[55:47] imagine the blessings that come with
[55:50] putting God first
[55:53] and we are always we are always not just
[55:56] from the beginning but always that
[55:58] testing comes in our life of putting God
[56:00] first but there's always Victory when
[56:03] the word is first because Victory only
[56:06] comes by the word
[56:09] so when they followed the word they put
[56:11] the ark forth in here the priests are
[56:13] carrying it their victory was certain as
[56:15] long as they followed the word of the
[56:17] Lord that God remember God had spoke to
[56:20] Joshua regarding the leadership into the
[56:23] battle Jericho he gave Direction so the
[56:26] word itself spake now I want you to look
[56:29] at this in Joshua chapter 6 and verse
[56:32] 17. now this is coming into this moment
[56:36] of Victory and it's promised it's
[56:38] certain of Jericho and here's what God
[56:41] speaks to the children of Israel in
[56:42] verse 17 and the city shall be accursed
[56:45] even in and all that are therein to the
[56:47] Lord only Ray at the Harlot shall live
[56:50] she and all that are with with her in
[56:53] the house because she hid The Messengers
[56:56] that we sent she received that message
[57:00] she had heard and because she was
[57:03] ordained alive God seen to it that the
[57:06] word got to her and the word that came
[57:09] to her it led her across her Red Sea the
[57:13] word came to her and opened the Jordan
[57:15] for her the word came and made a way for
[57:18] her to move from that of bondage of just
[57:21] Desiring oh I I just I want to know that
[57:24] God but because that desire was there
[57:27] and God coming near that desire began to
[57:30] rise and God sent Messengers with the
[57:34] message that would match and correspond
[57:36] and dovetail like that laundry ticket
[57:39] and it would release Rahab she was no
[57:42] longer she didn't have to go to five
[57:44] steps on how to be a better woman ten
[57:46] steps she didn't join a church class she
[57:49] met the Living God that's the difference
[57:51] between the Reformation of man because
[57:54] it's man trying to reform man but when
[57:57] God comes on the scene God brings forth
[57:59] a transformation in a person's life
[58:04] and God knew just exactly where she was
[58:06] at
[58:07] Verse 18 and ye in any wise well God's
[58:11] speaking here to Israel keep yourselves
[58:13] from the accursed thing lest you make
[58:16] yourselves accursed
[58:19] the government say I'm going to move the
[58:21] curse thing out of the way but you keep
[58:22] yourselves from it
[58:25] lest ye make yourselves a curse when you
[58:28] take of the accursed thing and make the
[58:31] camp of Israel a curse and trouble it
[58:33] but all the silver and gold and vessels
[58:35] of brass and iron are consecrated unto
[58:38] the Lord they shall come into the
[58:40] treasury of the Lord
[58:43] so it's putting the word first
[58:47] now remember the word
[58:49] had come down in the form of a man
[58:53] Joshua was out praying
[58:55] and the same Pillar of Fire the same one
[58:58] that spoke to Abraham the same one that
[59:01] came down in Eden and walked in the cool
[59:04] of the evening the same God that met
[59:06] Moses there in the burning bush the same
[59:09] God that led them and opened the Red Sea
[59:12] was a pillar of cloud with a knight and
[59:15] a cloud of Light by day that same God
[59:17] that was veiled there the whole time now
[59:20] when it came to the Crossing into the
[59:22] land that same God who was veiled in
[59:25] that Pillar of Fire now he steps down in
[59:28] the form of a man
[59:31] and he announces I am come as captain of
[59:35] the Lord's host I've come you see when
[59:37] God brings them into the land god just
[59:39] doesn't drop us off and say
[59:41] just go ahead and go on your own I mean
[59:43] go ahead you you know what to do but you
[59:46] see God is an ever-present God
[59:49] because the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:51] the new birth is not something of his
[59:53] presence moving on you and then lifting
[59:56] off of you but he said I will go with
[59:59] you I will be with you even until the
[1:00:02] end of the age why because yet place
[1:00:06] inside of your life that seed is God's
[1:00:09] reserved place for himself just as much
[1:00:12] as the word here is reserved for God to
[1:00:16] come and fulfill it man cannot fulfill
[1:00:18] it man cannot do it but it takes God
[1:00:20] coming on the scene to fulfill his word
[1:00:23] and that part of himself he placed in us
[1:00:26] that seed that predestinated part is
[1:00:30] Jehovah Jireh providing for himself he
[1:00:34] provided a place that he can come into
[1:00:36] that's why it's not you believing it's
[1:00:39] God in you believing his own word
[1:00:45] so it's not you know we believe it but
[1:00:48] but even when like as Paul said even
[1:00:51] when you know that when I'm not when I
[1:00:53] I'm not uh uh I can't think of the exact
[1:00:55] words maybe
[1:00:56] um I'm not as uh faithful or I can't
[1:00:59] think of the exact word but he said he
[1:01:01] abideth faithful
[1:01:03] that's the power of the new birth you
[1:01:05] can never get away from God
[1:01:08] you can't because there's no desire to
[1:01:10] get away from God you can look at
[1:01:13] yourself and say well I failed him right
[1:01:15] I want to be a better Christian I should
[1:01:17] of course there's that desire in your
[1:01:19] life and God gives us Grace helps us
[1:01:21] that we recognize that it's God it's not
[1:01:24] my effort you need it's my surrender
[1:01:26] that you need
[1:01:28] that's what God allows us to come to
[1:01:31] situations in our life and we're trying
[1:01:33] to do different things I I just you know
[1:01:35] when I was on the trip here I had a text
[1:01:37] come in from an individual not that
[1:01:39] don't come here but the and a text come
[1:01:41] in and you know and and they send it in
[1:01:43] it's from a family member and they sent
[1:01:45] it to me and I I'm reading through and
[1:01:47] I've been talking with them and working
[1:01:48] with them and I said I think one thing
[1:01:50] you're trying to do you're trying to
[1:01:52] they're wanting you know what I I want
[1:01:54] this to do and I want this to change in
[1:01:55] my life I said you're getting the cart
[1:01:58] before the horse
[1:02:00] you're trying to do take principles and
[1:02:04] try to change your life
[1:02:06] it's not principles that'll change your
[1:02:08] life you need to meet Jesus Christ
[1:02:13] you need to surrender your life he said
[1:02:16] in his word if you seek me with all your
[1:02:20] heart I will be found of you
[1:02:25] he's a person
[1:02:30] the word had become
[1:02:33] flesh here and he gave Direction notice
[1:02:36] the same God veiled as captain of the
[1:02:40] Lord's host that same God
[1:02:43] now when that word has been given Joshua
[1:02:46] comes back into the camp he's veiled
[1:02:49] with the presence of God and he begins
[1:02:52] to give forth the word of the Lord
[1:02:53] remember bear to follow the ark
[1:02:56] right and the word is spoken that word
[1:03:00] has spoken because remember you can't
[1:03:03] change God's nature
[1:03:05] what God what was in that Ark that was
[1:03:08] God's nature God never said the law was
[1:03:11] evil he said the law was holy
[1:03:14] the law can never establish that
[1:03:17] Holiness but through Jesus Christ the
[1:03:21] law has been established in our hearts
[1:03:24] because it's not a work of man it's not
[1:03:26] us struggling and I'm trying to get this
[1:03:29] right now no it's surrendering and he
[1:03:31] comes down with his finger and he brings
[1:03:35] transformation in our life changing our
[1:03:39] desires to match his nature
[1:03:42] he said I'll write my laws in your heart
[1:03:45] and in your minds
[1:03:47] and because of that I remember your
[1:03:49] iniquity no more why because you're a
[1:03:51] new creation
[1:03:55] That's The Power of this of this Liberty
[1:03:58] that same God veiled there now as the
[1:04:02] children of Israel think of this Israel
[1:04:05] Moving they themselves now it's God
[1:04:08] veiled in their lives marching around
[1:04:11] Jericho
[1:04:14] Joshua had this here it's God being God
[1:04:17] has always veiled
[1:04:18] he's always behind the veil
[1:04:21] right he's always behind the veil
[1:04:24] because one what Moses spoke later
[1:04:26] became behind the veil what God revealed
[1:04:29] to Joshua became behind the veil they
[1:04:32] became the manifestation of that meeting
[1:04:35] that Joshua had with the captain of The
[1:04:37] Lord of hosts
[1:04:39] and it wasn't just some letter they
[1:04:41] received they received an unction of the
[1:04:44] spirit of God that overrode their
[1:04:46] reasoning he gave them strength when the
[1:04:49] scoff was coming off the walls and all
[1:04:52] their minds could say a trumpet's going
[1:04:54] to knock this wall down but there's a
[1:04:56] strength that is not natural
[1:05:00] and Joshua had as brother Brown called
[1:05:03] it his v-day when he met the captain of
[1:05:06] the Lord's host and the plan was
[1:05:08] revealed that's the real Victory right
[1:05:10] there
[1:05:11] that's where the pressure is let off
[1:05:13] but you could just recognize his
[1:05:15] presence you know sometimes it's not
[1:05:17] that he dismantles the situation he
[1:05:19] dismantles the trial but it's just his
[1:05:21] presence when his presence comes when he
[1:05:24] just comes by and just speaks to your
[1:05:26] heart maybe tonight and just encourage
[1:05:29] you by his word it just gives you
[1:05:31] strength in the midst of it he don't
[1:05:33] take away the circumstance and
[1:05:35] everything like that he can do that but
[1:05:37] he gives you strength
[1:05:42] I'm so glad about that
[1:05:44] aren't you
[1:05:46] I'm glad about that you see Joshua
[1:05:49] had put the word first
[1:05:51] and this is where that within that as
[1:05:54] they moved around that wall and they
[1:05:56] came around there that seventh time they
[1:05:58] probably no doubt didn't feel nothing
[1:06:00] but then that seventh time brother Brown
[1:06:02] said that's when the spirit moved in
[1:06:06] that's when the spirit of God came in in
[1:06:09] that seventh time now I could preach on
[1:06:11] dice but I'm not going to do that right
[1:06:12] now it moved in and the walls fell down
[1:06:15] now notice in Joshua 7 because I want to
[1:06:18] really lay this in with the maintaining
[1:06:20] of our Liberty in Joshua 7 here it
[1:06:23] speaks of the the the the the the after
[1:06:26] part or that which takes place in that
[1:06:28] victory of Jericho but the children of
[1:06:31] Israel committed a trespass in the
[1:06:32] accursed thing for Aiken the son of
[1:06:35] karma the son of zabdiad the son of Zara
[1:06:37] of the tribe of Judah took of the
[1:06:40] accursed thing and the anger of the Lord
[1:06:42] was kindled against the children of
[1:06:44] Israel
[1:06:45] now this didn't come to light nobody
[1:06:49] knew about it
[1:06:50] until the next battle
[1:06:52] and with the next Battle of AI came
[1:06:55] around
[1:06:56] instead of instead of Israel standing
[1:06:59] Victorious they were running
[1:07:04] now Joshua when he goes on and he calls
[1:07:08] a fast and Joshua gets before God
[1:07:10] because God has made a promise there's
[1:07:13] not going to be one man be able to stand
[1:07:15] before you
[1:07:18] so Joshua was looking at what's going on
[1:07:20] what's wrong something is wrong
[1:07:24] right I want to just kind of move beyond
[1:07:27] that tonight and come into a place that
[1:07:29] the Lord just just speaking to my heart
[1:07:31] upon these things tonight and I want to
[1:07:33] go into this that even of the part of
[1:07:35] where it's been uncovered that here it
[1:07:38] is with with Aiken and it has he is
[1:07:40] standing here in this time and how that
[1:07:43] Joshua in chapter in verse 19 of chapter
[1:07:45] 7 Joshua says unto Aiken my son give I
[1:07:49] pray thee glory to the Lord God of
[1:07:50] Israel and make confession unto him and
[1:07:53] tell me now what thou has done hide it
[1:07:55] not from me and he can answer Joshua and
[1:07:58] said indeed I have sinned against the
[1:08:00] Lord God of Israel and thus and thus
[1:08:02] have I done when I saw
[1:08:05] The Spoils of a goodly babylonious
[1:08:08] garment
[1:08:10] and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of
[1:08:13] gold of 50 shekels of weight then I
[1:08:17] coveted them and took them and behold
[1:08:20] they are HID in the earth in the midst
[1:08:23] of my tent and the silver under it now I
[1:08:25] want you to notice this
[1:08:26] Aiken is rehearsing
[1:08:30] what happened
[1:08:32] when I saw
[1:08:36] now in order to see it this describes us
[1:08:39] more than just that of a visualize
[1:08:41] remember the woman standing there in the
[1:08:44] Garden of Eden when the woman saw that
[1:08:47] the tree was good for food
[1:08:48] it entered in you see that very word
[1:08:51] that saw it entered in into the mind
[1:08:55] Satan began to move upon the mind be
[1:08:58] trying to pull through the emotions this
[1:09:01] is why that we are not to stop to listen
[1:09:06] to Satan at all
[1:09:11] when I saw
[1:09:14] you could have seen no doubt everybody
[1:09:16] else could say I I seen different things
[1:09:19] but they turned
[1:09:23] because it wasn't just like that Aiken
[1:09:25] happened to be the lucky dog of the
[1:09:26] bunch and he saw a babylonious garment
[1:09:28] Miss stuff was all over
[1:09:32] but when I saw
[1:09:35] then I coveted it notice the print
[1:09:39] notice the progression of sin
[1:09:42] it starts with entertaining it
[1:09:46] then once it's entertained I coveted it
[1:09:50] it's been a conceiving
[1:09:52] and I took it
[1:09:54] you could have never took it unless at
[1:09:56] first had come in and saw it and begin
[1:09:58] to covet it
[1:10:00] but oh if Aiken in that moment think of
[1:10:02] this if Aiken in that moment could have
[1:10:06] just just just looked out to God and
[1:10:08] said Lord strengthen me Lord Jesus I
[1:10:12] want to walk with your word you spoke in
[1:10:15] your word of what we were to do you even
[1:10:17] brought it present so it could be
[1:10:19] applied in this battle knowing what we
[1:10:22] were going to face Lord give me strength
[1:10:26] you think the other Israelites didn't do
[1:10:29] that
[1:10:30] they weren't superhuman no more than you
[1:10:32] and I are
[1:10:33] but what it was is in the midst of the
[1:10:36] battle they heeded to the word following
[1:10:39] the word did not stop when the walls
[1:10:42] fell down oh my so many times we lose
[1:10:46] Victory because once it comes we'll pull
[1:10:50] back
[1:10:52] oh you're getting quiet on me now
[1:10:54] things are going real good we pull back
[1:10:56] on prayer
[1:10:58] we pull back on really digging in you
[1:11:01] know and really just look into the Lord
[1:11:03] things going real good man everything's
[1:11:05] set at the job everything's p's and q's
[1:11:07] and this and that and my just something
[1:11:09] God says you know what you're leaning
[1:11:11] too much on yourself
[1:11:14] hello somebody I'm talking about
[1:11:16] maintaining our Liberty because our
[1:11:18] Liberty we do not maintain it by going
[1:11:21] out on our own our Liberty is in Christ
[1:11:24] Jesus it's through him and when we are
[1:11:27] beholding his face that's where we
[1:11:30] receive the strength and Victory
[1:11:34] all right
[1:11:35] glory be to God
[1:11:41] Hallelujah
[1:11:44] the Bible says in James 1 let's look at
[1:11:45] this let's dive into it a little bit
[1:11:47] let's bring it down into our lives
[1:11:50] the Bible said in verse 12 blessed is
[1:11:52] the man that endureth Temptation for
[1:11:53] when he has tried he shall receive the
[1:11:56] Crown of Life which the Lord hath
[1:11:58] promised to them that love him
[1:12:00] everyone must be tested tempted and
[1:12:02] tried
[1:12:04] and Satan is going to try to test you
[1:12:05] and tempt you with things that you have
[1:12:08] even already overcome
[1:12:10] even as a young Christian there's things
[1:12:12] he can whisper into your ear Stay With
[1:12:15] Me Now
[1:12:16] that does not mean that that desire is
[1:12:19] still there it's Satan trying to tempt
[1:12:22] you
[1:12:24] but blessed is the man that endureth
[1:12:28] you know what that says endureth it just
[1:12:31] it steadfast in patience just waiting
[1:12:33] yes enduring because you're being
[1:12:35] battled and battle is coming at you to
[1:12:38] aching was being tempted but he didn't
[1:12:40] endure
[1:12:45] let no man say when he is tempted I am
[1:12:48] tempted of God for God cannot be tempted
[1:12:51] with evil neither tempteth he any man
[1:12:55] but every man is tempted when he is
[1:12:57] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[1:13:01] then when lust hath conceived it
[1:13:04] bringeth forth sin and sin when it is
[1:13:08] finished bringeth forth
[1:13:10] death
[1:13:12] so it all starts when I saw
[1:13:16] taking taking it in taking in a thought
[1:13:19] brother Brown would put it so simple as
[1:13:20] this taking a thought in that is against
[1:13:23] the word
[1:13:25] character of the word you know it may
[1:13:27] not be that Satan's quoting to you
[1:13:29] things that oh you could say well I know
[1:13:31] that right there in the scripture or not
[1:13:32] but it might be coming against the very
[1:13:34] character because remember the word is a
[1:13:36] person
[1:13:37] right there's things that he can whisper
[1:13:40] to you try to tell you about your
[1:13:41] brother tell you about your sister tell
[1:13:43] him about this and tell them about that
[1:13:45] but remember we do not want to take that
[1:13:47] from that of the enemy we want to bring
[1:13:49] it right back in line with God's word
[1:13:54] is that right
[1:13:57] when it's finished it bring it for Death
[1:13:59] Do not air or go astray my beloved
[1:14:02] Brethren so if it comes into the mind
[1:14:04] and is entertained turn it down that's
[1:14:07] why brother Brown said don't stop to
[1:14:09] listen remember the little lady who God
[1:14:12] had delivered her from dancing
[1:14:13] delivered her from the music and she got
[1:14:15] to saying well that you know that don't
[1:14:17] bother me no more but everybody said oh
[1:14:19] no you just think it don't
[1:14:21] and she got over there around you know
[1:14:23] she crossed the street and started
[1:14:24] walking on that side of the street and
[1:14:26] she got over there and the next thing
[1:14:28] she knows she's on the dance floor in a
[1:14:32] man's arms
[1:14:34] because what happened she got to
[1:14:36] reminiscing and she thought it didn't
[1:14:38] affect her
[1:14:39] but she snapped me right there had
[1:14:41] something that snaps right on the dance
[1:14:43] floor and she runs there and makes
[1:14:45] Headway to get to brother random and
[1:14:47] said brother random brother around help
[1:14:49] me help me I'm lost I'm lost help me
[1:14:50] help me remember I'm saying you're not
[1:14:52] lost but he recognized there was a
[1:14:54] spirit that had come in there
[1:14:57] are you saying are you hearing me now
[1:14:59] and the brother random was able to
[1:15:00] discern that and he said now this is my
[1:15:04] sister
[1:15:05] you turn her loose
[1:15:12] and you know what happened that spirit
[1:15:13] rose up out of there with long hair and
[1:15:15] everything else and I mean just like a
[1:15:17] baton and that drunk guy he became sober
[1:15:19] very quick
[1:15:20] it was a spirit
[1:15:22] you say brother the same man what are
[1:15:23] you saying well I tell you what he's
[1:15:25] saying is that thoughts are not just
[1:15:27] empty random words it's spirits
[1:15:30] [Applause]
[1:15:32] that's why when you entertain them you
[1:15:35] know listen when you entertain them it's
[1:15:37] going to make you feel one way or the
[1:15:39] other
[1:15:40] now you can sit here and say I don't
[1:15:41] have feelings but that ain't true when
[1:15:44] the word is coming your way and the Holy
[1:15:46] Spirit is speaking to you there's a
[1:15:49] liberty
[1:15:50] there is strength that comes but when
[1:15:53] the enemy goes you'll you'll start
[1:15:56] feeling it
[1:15:57] it's vexing
[1:15:59] it's troubling
[1:16:01] it's depressing
[1:16:03] because why it's spirits
[1:16:08] is that right what do I do stop it right
[1:16:11] away
[1:16:12] stop it you've got Authority you've got
[1:16:15] authority to do it because remember
[1:16:16] brother Brown would say it like this
[1:16:18] over and over
[1:16:19] and and I'll just just to really drop
[1:16:21] this I'm feeling impressed with on that
[1:16:23] is that do you understand you can be
[1:16:26] tempted
[1:16:28] I know that's not a news flash but yet
[1:16:30] it is
[1:16:31] temptation is not sin
[1:16:35] heeding your temptation is sin
[1:16:38] you can all be tempted now listen every
[1:16:41] one of us when we are tempted you don't
[1:16:44] feel good about it
[1:16:47] let a thought or anything else come into
[1:16:49] your mind or whatever more you don't
[1:16:51] feel clean
[1:16:52] you don't feel good about it but it's a
[1:16:55] Temptation and what's it doing it's
[1:16:57] pulling almost two other parts of your
[1:17:00] life that are not redeemed your flesh
[1:17:03] and your spirit
[1:17:06] and Satan wants you to act in those
[1:17:09] realms
[1:17:11] but your Liberty is not from those
[1:17:14] realms
[1:17:16] your Liberty is from within as you bring
[1:17:19] those other Realms subject
[1:17:22] that's your Liberty
[1:17:24] that's your jurisdiction as Sons and
[1:17:26] Daughters of God the scripture says let
[1:17:28] me hurry here in Hebrews chapter 2 he
[1:17:31] was made God came down and was made of
[1:17:35] faithful and merciful High faithful to
[1:17:38] the word right it was the word made
[1:17:40] flesh
[1:17:42] and he was merciful
[1:17:44] one who was able
[1:17:47] to understand you and I
[1:17:49] to go through the experiences
[1:17:52] that we go through
[1:17:57] I love this
[1:17:58] for in that he himself hath suffered
[1:18:01] being tempted
[1:18:03] anybody ever suffered being tempted
[1:18:06] sure
[1:18:08] tempting can be it can be suffering
[1:18:09] things can it can there's so many
[1:18:11] different forms friends just don't limit
[1:18:12] it to one thing it can be so many things
[1:18:14] do you realize even when a sickness will
[1:18:16] come
[1:18:17] do you know sickness and diseases it's
[1:18:18] tormenting spirits
[1:18:21] they would like to try to he tries to
[1:18:23] come up on when somebody's dealing with
[1:18:24] something to worry them that's why when
[1:18:26] you're praying for different ones that
[1:18:27] are going through sickness going through
[1:18:29] things pray also that God gives them
[1:18:31] strength in their spirit and their mind
[1:18:33] not just touch their body because it's a
[1:18:36] tormenting spirit that wants to just
[1:18:39] weaken them they're fighting they're
[1:18:41] battling but hey we're brothers and
[1:18:43] sisters together if one feels this way
[1:18:45] if this hand feels pain then the rest of
[1:18:48] the body feels pain
[1:18:50] right
[1:18:56] glory be to God
[1:18:58] you see he has suffered being tempted he
[1:19:01] is able to secure them that are tempted
[1:19:07] same very plain brother Brown let us
[1:19:09] know in the deity of Jesus Christ and
[1:19:11] put it very clearly Jesus was tempted to
[1:19:14] take the kingdoms without suffering
[1:19:18] he was tempted to do that
[1:19:21] but he stayed the course
[1:19:23] he relied on the word
[1:19:27] In the Heat of the battle he didn't give
[1:19:29] down on the word are you hearing me
[1:19:31] brother Ram uses those terms In the Heat
[1:19:34] of the battle
[1:19:35] Temptation it's the heat of the battle
[1:19:38] and Satan's desire is to try to get you
[1:19:40] to let down on the word
[1:19:42] but the word is your weapon
[1:19:45] and that weapon will defeat Satan
[1:19:47] anywhere anytime any place
[1:19:50] and let me just tell you something when
[1:19:52] the weakest Christian not the strongest
[1:19:54] one but when the weakest Christian will
[1:19:56] go to their knees you might be on the
[1:19:59] job and you can't fall to your knees but
[1:20:00] inside you can say Lord You're my refuge
[1:20:03] you're my help Lord God
[1:20:07] I'm talking about soldiers that are
[1:20:10] maintaining their Liberty and knowing
[1:20:12] that God is an ever-present help in the
[1:20:15] time of trouble
[1:20:18] oh if Aiken would have just called out
[1:20:20] Lord help me give me the strength Lord
[1:20:23] to just turn my head forgive me Lord for
[1:20:25] entertaining that thought
[1:20:31] that was Aiken's responsibility in the
[1:20:33] assembly nobody else could do it for him
[1:20:36] his wife couldn't do it his mama
[1:20:38] couldn't do it his daddy couldn't do it
[1:20:40] he was his responsibility
[1:20:42] just like every one of us in this body
[1:20:43] have our own responsibility Before the
[1:20:46] Throne of God
[1:20:48] see we have an anchor that enters Paul
[1:20:51] said within the Veil
[1:20:53] there's times
[1:20:55] brother Brown said I'm just kind of
[1:20:57] skimming over some things that brown
[1:20:59] deals with in the Hebrew series
[1:21:01] there's times where the Bible says
[1:21:04] yeah and that he that is born of God
[1:21:06] does not commit sin commit means
[1:21:09] practice
[1:21:10] no longer a practicer
[1:21:12] why your desire has been changed
[1:21:19] but you can still make mistakes
[1:21:22] let me just let me just read it even how
[1:21:24] the prophet said it you'll make mistakes
[1:21:26] you'll fall he's not preaching Doom and
[1:21:28] Gloom
[1:21:29] but he's you know what this is this is
[1:21:31] rehearsal of what God told Joshua I'm
[1:21:33] going to remind you Joshua as I was with
[1:21:36] Moses I'm going to be with you
[1:21:39] I will not forsake you nor fail you you
[1:21:42] might get away from me
[1:21:43] but I ain't going to get away from you
[1:21:47] you might get away from my presence but
[1:21:50] my presence will come and hunt you down
[1:21:53] can't get to that tonight
[1:21:55] but you can you can't you because why
[1:21:57] there's no desire in our life to go back
[1:22:00] to the things of the world
[1:22:03] you'll make mistakes you'll fail he said
[1:22:05] sometimes you'llfully do wrong you'll go
[1:22:07] out and do things that don't mean your
[1:22:10] loss that means you're going to get
[1:22:11] correction
[1:22:12] my little boy my children will do things
[1:22:15] you know they do things against their
[1:22:16] rule your rules and they know what
[1:22:18] doesn't expect when they do it
[1:22:21] I guess they do right
[1:22:23] they're going to get a weapon for it
[1:22:25] sometimes a good one but it's still your
[1:22:29] child
[1:22:32] Hallelujah so your stumblings my
[1:22:35] stumblings and in the midst of
[1:22:36] Temptation does not change we are
[1:22:39] children of God
[1:22:44] oh you can say oh then I can just do
[1:22:47] whatever I want brother Brown said I
[1:22:48] always do what I wanted
[1:22:49] but if you're a Christian you don't want
[1:22:51] to do the thing that's wrong because the
[1:22:53] very life in you the very Foundation you
[1:22:55] don't want to do wrong and if you do it
[1:22:56] shows there's wrong in here
[1:22:58] how can bitter and sweet water come out
[1:23:00] of the same fountain but he says he
[1:23:02] that's born to God does not commit sin
[1:23:04] he has no desire to do sin
[1:23:08] you might say now let me just deal with
[1:23:09] this as it comes you might say brother
[1:23:11] Samuel but it feels like there's a pool
[1:23:13] that pool is upon your flesh and there's
[1:23:16] a war
[1:23:18] because the inside man does not want to
[1:23:22] do the things of evil it wants to please
[1:23:26] God but that flesh let me tell you
[1:23:28] something we pack him around feed him
[1:23:30] off for good we can tell about that we
[1:23:32] brush his teeth comb his hair if he got
[1:23:34] some we do all that man we treat him so
[1:23:36] good we buy him the best chairs massage
[1:23:39] and everything else and you know put the
[1:23:41] best vitamins in him but that guy in a
[1:23:44] one moment's notice Brother Ray he will
[1:23:46] side right against us
[1:23:49] don't you ever think that this guy is
[1:23:52] your buddy or your friend
[1:23:54] he will side against you in a moment you
[1:23:57] don't ever take him into a fight you've
[1:23:59] got the Lord on your side
[1:24:02] this gal turned coat in a minute
[1:24:05] [Applause]
[1:24:09] so the pool that's part of the
[1:24:11] Temptation not well well I guess no it's
[1:24:13] not well I guess it's part of the
[1:24:16] Temptation it's to recognize in that
[1:24:19] moment say oh Lord You Are My Strength
[1:24:24] Hallelujah absolutely my refuge notice
[1:24:27] the devil will trap him here and there
[1:24:29] but not willfully
[1:24:34] in about like traps
[1:24:38] anybody awake
[1:24:39] I hate traps I hate traps right
[1:24:43] I'm sure Bears here and he hate him too
[1:24:45] raccoons hate him
[1:24:47] you know possum hate him coyotes hate
[1:24:50] him
[1:24:51] there's traps that's made for him
[1:24:53] right and a trap is not something that
[1:24:56] visible
[1:24:58] a trump a trap is made where they take
[1:25:01] the sin off of it it looks like they're
[1:25:03] all their surroundings
[1:25:05] oh it's going to be a nice Friday
[1:25:06] morning
[1:25:07] praise God I got my latte it's Friday
[1:25:09] morning I'm going to reward myself for
[1:25:11] four days of hard work
[1:25:13] I'm gonna tell them to well anyhow and
[1:25:16] then all of a sudden
[1:25:17] here's something comes your way
[1:25:20] oh my
[1:25:23] and then you oh no
[1:25:26] what happened it was a trap
[1:25:28] but remember it was a trap and you're
[1:25:31] still a child of God
[1:25:33] what do I do get up
[1:25:35] dust your knees off and go on
[1:25:38] Lord forgive me Lord strengthen me help
[1:25:41] me Lord against that the next time
[1:25:45] because remember it would do no good to
[1:25:47] lay a trap Brother Ray if you walk up
[1:25:48] and down this aisle it would do no good
[1:25:50] for us to lay a trap over there because
[1:25:51] you're not going to walk over there same
[1:25:52] thing for you brother Sammy it's not
[1:25:54] you're going to do no good if you walk
[1:25:55] right here in the aisle it does no good
[1:25:57] to set a trap over there but traps are
[1:25:59] set based on our makeup
[1:26:03] that's are you hearing me Satan studies
[1:26:06] you oh my you think the government has
[1:26:07] files on you it's scary if you knew what
[1:26:09] the devil has on you he studies you oh
[1:26:11] yeah you think Live 360 on your phone
[1:26:14] something find my phone the devil knows
[1:26:16] exactly
[1:26:19] but there's one thing about it when
[1:26:20] we're Antichrist well he can touch this
[1:26:22] if he gets permission
[1:26:24] but you know what you can't touch this
[1:26:26] on the inside
[1:26:27] it's untouchable
[1:26:30] he tried to touch it but when he touches
[1:26:34] [Music]
[1:26:36] why there's a power on the inside
[1:26:39] [Applause]
[1:26:42] oh my mama don't you love him
[1:26:45] notice this let me just let me let me
[1:26:47] I'm trying to bring this down here in
[1:26:48] John chapter 14 the Bible says I will
[1:26:51] pray the father and he'll give you
[1:26:52] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:26:55] you forever even the spirit of Truth
[1:26:56] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:26:58] seeth him not neither knoweth him but
[1:27:00] you know him for he dwelleth with you
[1:27:02] and shall be in you notice the form is
[1:27:05] going to change
[1:27:08] it's going to change from
[1:27:10] son of man the Son of God to the
[1:27:12] supernatural
[1:27:14] and that had to be in order to pay the
[1:27:17] price of redemption to satisfy the
[1:27:21] requirements of the goel or of the
[1:27:24] Kinsmen Redeemer that that life could
[1:27:27] come back upon you and I
[1:27:30] so I'm not a different person you know
[1:27:32] well I received the Holy Ghost I didn't
[1:27:33] receive Jesus it's the same person
[1:27:36] it was God veiled in a body form God
[1:27:41] became one of us
[1:27:44] Jesus is not a different person
[1:27:47] come on friends when brother Branham
[1:27:50] uses to turn our big brother he's
[1:27:51] referring to the connotation of
[1:27:54] relationship that God became one of us
[1:27:58] not of a lesser person
[1:28:01] but God so condescended
[1:28:05] just like you read in Solomon and he
[1:28:07] says my dearest my love my sister it's a
[1:28:10] term of endearment
[1:28:12] God so became one of us
[1:28:16] that he became our brother
[1:28:18] a term of endearment
[1:28:24] I will not
[1:28:27] will come to you
[1:28:30] same God
[1:28:33] veiled in you
[1:28:36] he's our comforter our comforter is our
[1:28:38] paracletos
[1:28:40] one who is called to our Aid
[1:28:43] one who is our help one who is there as
[1:28:46] an advocate on our behalf one who is
[1:28:50] there to be our intercessor to intercede
[1:28:53] for us one who is there to open the word
[1:28:56] to you and I one who is there to
[1:28:59] strengthen you and I when the tests are
[1:29:01] trials or whatever comes our way he is
[1:29:05] our all in all
[1:29:08] I don't know my words just fail to
[1:29:10] describe it he's everything to us we're
[1:29:12] nothing without him it's him opening the
[1:29:15] word it's him giving us wisdom it's him
[1:29:17] sanctifying it's him it's him at work in
[1:29:20] our life he is our comforter and it's a
[1:29:23] comfort to know he's our comforter he's
[1:29:25] in US comforting Us by making his word
[1:29:28] live through us
[1:29:31] there's a liberty
[1:29:32] are you hearing me there's a liberty
[1:29:34] that is in him
[1:29:36] this is why in our life everybody say
[1:29:39] with me
[1:29:40] this is why
[1:29:42] we're talking about Temptation here let
[1:29:43] me just let me just descend on this
[1:29:45] point here and lay these lay these
[1:29:46] little last points in here
[1:29:48] you have to remember in your life in my
[1:29:51] life
[1:29:52] those opening scriptures we read
[1:29:55] passing from Death unto life scriptures
[1:29:58] regarding that of the creative power of
[1:30:00] God bringing about the New Birth you see
[1:30:02] it's a spirit of God that deals with
[1:30:03] your heart that calls you and I
[1:30:06] to confess
[1:30:09] and repent of our sins it was a spirit
[1:30:11] of God it's a spirit of God that comes
[1:30:14] that brings sanctification
[1:30:17] it's it is it's a spirit of God working
[1:30:19] in our life and the reason that is is
[1:30:21] because God's desire is to come to the
[1:30:24] throne of our heart
[1:30:26] so God is working in all of that it's
[1:30:28] not it's not you it's God that's working
[1:30:30] but to recognize it's him that's doing
[1:30:32] it and that is he moves into that
[1:30:36] innermost place in your life now
[1:30:38] remember he just won't do it he's got to
[1:30:40] be it's got to be given to him
[1:30:43] it's got to welcome him because remember
[1:30:45] he's not come that we would lead him he
[1:30:49] has come as captain of the Lord's host
[1:30:55] so we can quit anything
[1:30:59] you didn't quit nothing well I quit no
[1:31:00] you didn't quit it if you quit it then
[1:31:02] that was all you
[1:31:04] but we didn't quit anything brother Rand
[1:31:06] puts it like this and acts of the Holy
[1:31:08] Spirit he said I did not quit anything
[1:31:10] the Holy Spirit came in me and he quit
[1:31:15] so it wasn't wasn't our efforts that's
[1:31:17] that's the working of the power of God
[1:31:19] now notice he said then the Holy Spirit
[1:31:22] now notice once it's come he said it
[1:31:24] ain't what I've done it's what he done I
[1:31:25] didn't quit nothing he just come and
[1:31:26] took it out of me then the Holy Spirit
[1:31:28] abides in and grows daily it just grows
[1:31:33] making itself greater and greater
[1:31:38] not me not you making itself greater and
[1:31:43] greater
[1:31:44] it's growing it's pushing out
[1:31:47] now notice as it's doing this is part of
[1:31:49] maintaining our Liberty
[1:31:51] it pushes out the things the cares The
[1:31:54] Temptations
[1:31:56] there's things no doubt we could go
[1:31:57] through this congregation right here
[1:31:58] tonight that there's things that one
[1:32:00] time in Europe even in the beginning of
[1:32:02] your journey that you were tempted by I
[1:32:05] mean it was a hard temptation but God
[1:32:08] has given you Grace where you could be
[1:32:10] able to stand and testify that I have
[1:32:12] overcome that sure things can come
[1:32:15] thoughts can come and the devil can say
[1:32:17] well you only think you overcame that
[1:32:19] but you know I've overcome it because
[1:32:22] I'm not afraid of you no more
[1:32:24] [Applause]
[1:32:25] I ain't looking on my back no more
[1:32:28] I've overcome it because greater is he
[1:32:31] that's in me than he that's in the world
[1:32:33] who did that for you God
[1:32:37] the Holy Spirit growing and abiding
[1:32:40] daily
[1:32:42] Lord be to God aren't you glad that God
[1:32:46] has sent us a word that we can grow as
[1:32:47] fat as calves in the storm
[1:32:51] I believe that kind of Fat's all right
[1:32:56] oh Lord have mercy it pushes out the
[1:32:58] things that cares the temptation as you
[1:33:00] overcome them
[1:33:02] the Holy Spirit takes its place and if
[1:33:04] you've got a real bad temptation of
[1:33:06] something that's not right overcome that
[1:33:09] thing a few times and watch if your
[1:33:12] testimony doesn't Bloom on account of it
[1:33:14] and I may not be real smart but I know
[1:33:16] if you're going to overcome it it's a
[1:33:18] battle
[1:33:18] so I want you to understand when the
[1:33:20] battle comes into temptation that it's
[1:33:22] not defeat that's the time to draw your
[1:33:25] sword that's the time to maintain
[1:33:27] Victory and Liberty in the midst of them
[1:33:30] and say this is coming my way but I'm
[1:33:33] more than a conqueror we're not just
[1:33:35] rehearsing a bunch of words
[1:33:37] come on friends this gospel is not just
[1:33:40] full of glory and power at the pulpit or
[1:33:43] in the house of God you are the house of
[1:33:45] God
[1:33:46] this gospel is full of power and glory
[1:33:49] in your life you got a right to draw
[1:33:51] your sword and stand right there when
[1:33:54] the Devil comes and said I ain't backing
[1:33:56] up
[1:33:58] I ain't backing up and matter of fact I
[1:34:00] ain't listening to your mouth
[1:34:05] sometimes we entertain
[1:34:07] his speaking
[1:34:12] what must I mean what should I do I just
[1:34:15] start worshiping the Lord that's what I
[1:34:17] do
[1:34:19] I'm just telling you what I do
[1:34:21] I'm telling you what I do I just turn
[1:34:24] worshiping the Lord I put on little
[1:34:26] music
[1:34:28] now I don't put on Nearer My God to thee
[1:34:33] I may put on something This Means War
[1:34:39] oh but Samuel that's all work up
[1:34:41] I would rather live in my victory of
[1:34:44] what you call work up then live to be
[1:34:47] down
[1:34:47] God has given us tools the Bible said he
[1:34:51] has encompassed me about with songs of
[1:34:55] Deliverance
[1:34:57] you know why songs music it works on the
[1:35:01] spirit man
[1:35:05] oh my don't tell me brother Brown how
[1:35:07] many times you did a spirit of God in in
[1:35:09] the in the prayer lines over and over he
[1:35:11] would tell the people you want to put on
[1:35:12] some good gospel music
[1:35:16] right he said Put it on he said Billy he
[1:35:19] said billy gets under that Gloom
[1:35:21] sometimes he said I told Billy you keep
[1:35:23] it playing in this trailer their office
[1:35:25] where they worked
[1:35:32] I know that's simple but I'm talking
[1:35:34] about maintaining our Liberty
[1:35:37] oh glory be to God
[1:35:39] you look at how Samson Samson you know
[1:35:41] he ran out there
[1:35:42] and hear the power of God come upon him
[1:35:45] and he smote that lion
[1:35:48] you know what he ended up doing
[1:35:50] after he smote that line he came back
[1:35:52] and there was honey in that carcass
[1:35:55] he ate honey
[1:35:57] out of what was a bad temptation
[1:36:00] he overcame it by what the power of God
[1:36:04] oh brother Samuel I'm not worthy of the
[1:36:06] power of God who told you that lie
[1:36:08] the same one that's tempting you is the
[1:36:10] same one telling you that lie you've got
[1:36:13] a right to invite the Lord Jesus if
[1:36:15] there's something that's out of line say
[1:36:17] Lord help me Lord God Lord give me
[1:36:19] strength that I can overcome this right
[1:36:21] now Lord God give me strength that I can
[1:36:24] turn my head you have a right to call
[1:36:26] Jesus on the sea rebuke that liar
[1:36:31] maintain your Liberty
[1:36:34] and Samson overcame it with the power of
[1:36:37] God brother man said if you've got safe
[1:36:39] you want to eat some sweet honey you
[1:36:40] just overcome it with the power of God
[1:36:42] oh he said maybe he says you've been a
[1:36:45] Drucker and every time you smell whiskey
[1:36:46] or beer you want to drink overcome it by
[1:36:49] the power of God pass by at one time and
[1:36:52] see what a feeling you got in your heart
[1:36:53] when the thing is Dead and Gone Dead all
[1:36:55] finished oh my there's sweet honey you
[1:36:57] get out of it
[1:37:02] I like honey don't you
[1:37:04] foreign
[1:37:06] I think of how that Paul you know is in
[1:37:08] the midst of it many times we we quote
[1:37:10] the scripture resist the devil and he
[1:37:11] will flee from you but we forget the
[1:37:13] very first part
[1:37:14] submit
[1:37:16] yourselves
[1:37:17] therefore
[1:37:19] unto God
[1:37:20] if Aiken would have just said Lord
[1:37:22] forgive me for these thoughts that I'm
[1:37:24] entertaining
[1:37:25] Lord these things I know what you've
[1:37:26] said in your word and I want to honor
[1:37:28] your word
[1:37:30] I'm pulled in this way but I want to
[1:37:32] honor your word Lord give me strength
[1:37:39] oh my
[1:37:41] remember
[1:37:43] the brown would say it like this and let
[1:37:45] me just come down here and close
[1:37:49] he says in Christ revealed in his own
[1:37:51] word
[1:37:52] he speaks of a young Minister and his
[1:37:54] wife that had been in the room just
[1:37:57] moments ago and
[1:37:58] he said both of them are nervous
[1:38:01] just like the rest of the world and the
[1:38:03] rest of human beings on earth now watch
[1:38:04] what he says about this
[1:38:06] he said I told them remember Satan's got
[1:38:11] a punch
[1:38:12] coming at you
[1:38:15] I don't care who you are
[1:38:17] he's got a right for that one punch
[1:38:20] now look what he asked which would you
[1:38:23] rather that punch be
[1:38:25] to be blind
[1:38:27] arthritic sitting in a chair or be
[1:38:30] nervous
[1:38:31] so he's just identified this nervousness
[1:38:36] is a punch
[1:38:37] that Satan is punching at him
[1:38:40] I want you to watch this
[1:38:43] we believe in Deliverance don't we
[1:38:45] but remember what what Deliverance is
[1:38:48] Deliverance is is where it's no longer
[1:38:49] ruling you you rule it
[1:38:53] Satan can stick up his head but you've
[1:38:55] got to remind him
[1:38:56] are you hearing me let me tell you
[1:38:58] something right now it's important with
[1:38:59] the people used to surround yourself
[1:39:00] with too
[1:39:03] if you get around a bunch of unbelievers
[1:39:04] and sometimes it isn't even unbelievers
[1:39:06] sometimes you can be around people who
[1:39:08] are believers but they themselves are so
[1:39:09] overcome and it's so negative
[1:39:12] right
[1:39:13] you're not dear Lord help me
[1:39:16] everything's negative it's picking out
[1:39:18] this I'm picking out that if there's one
[1:39:19] thing I hate I hate negativity
[1:39:23] I'm just be honest with you
[1:39:25] I don't have much of a time for
[1:39:27] everybody pulling out things oh this is
[1:39:28] wrong in the message and this is wrong
[1:39:29] and this is wrong well are you right
[1:39:32] are you God
[1:39:34] come on friends I'm not interested in
[1:39:35] that I'm sorry because we're talking to
[1:39:37] the redeemed of the Lord and if there is
[1:39:39] problems and there is situations I've
[1:39:42] Got Confidence that what we need is the
[1:39:44] Holy Ghost to flood down
[1:39:46] and not stand above everybody and this
[1:39:49] is wrong and this is wrong and this is
[1:39:50] wrong and this is wrong and this is
[1:39:52] wrong and this wrong and this is wrong
[1:39:53] and this is wrong I think we've got
[1:39:55] something else to preach we've got a
[1:39:57] gospel and a message to preach instead
[1:39:59] of picking people to pieces
[1:40:02] come on friends we've got a gospel
[1:40:04] that's liberating that's full of Glory
[1:40:07] it's full of power
[1:40:09] are you hearing me now
[1:40:11] let me just stop here and drop this
[1:40:13] you remember them fences that came up
[1:40:15] between them ducks
[1:40:17] remember that
[1:40:20] how'd they get rid of them fences
[1:40:23] well these like wire cutters no they
[1:40:25] didn't
[1:40:28] you know what happened
[1:40:30] stop focusing on the fences and let the
[1:40:32] water level rise when the water level
[1:40:34] Rose you could no longer see a fence
[1:40:37] and the Ducks got together
[1:40:39] that's the promise we're living in in
[1:40:41] this hour is the holy spirit do we have
[1:40:43] to call out wrong we do but I do not
[1:40:46] believe we've got to walk around
[1:40:47] negative and negative and negative we're
[1:40:49] looking at the wrong things
[1:40:53] if there should be anybody that's
[1:40:55] positive in the world it should be the
[1:40:57] Bride of Jesus Christ we've got a
[1:40:59] positive promise made by a positive God
[1:41:01] a positive token a positive record we
[1:41:05] have a positive message because God
[1:41:08] himself is Vindicated it and right here
[1:41:11] Among Us
[1:41:13] Lord have mercy we got enough negative
[1:41:15] around us oh my
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:20] God you might be that might be you might
[1:41:21] be prone to be negative remember that's
[1:41:23] a punch that's coming at you
[1:41:25] then you got a choice you can be a
[1:41:26] punching bag or you can shield and block
[1:41:28] it
[1:41:31] that's true now let me finish reading
[1:41:33] this all right
[1:41:34] I got one
[1:41:36] remember Satan's got a Punch coming at
[1:41:38] you I don't care who you are he's got a
[1:41:40] right for that one punch which would you
[1:41:42] rather be that punch would you rather
[1:41:44] you be blind or be arthritic sitting in
[1:41:46] a chair or be nervous he's got somewhere
[1:41:49] he can punch you
[1:41:51] he's got a right to that open place now
[1:41:54] that's the spot
[1:41:56] you got to keep covered
[1:41:59] all the time
[1:42:03] who keeps it covered you
[1:42:06] me
[1:42:08] now brother Brian's just went through
[1:42:09] this blind arthritic sitting Hotel
[1:42:12] nervous we can go on and on you could
[1:42:14] but it's a punch
[1:42:16] that Satan's got to come in
[1:42:18] so I wonder sometimes if what were
[1:42:19] things that weren't prayed for now
[1:42:21] listen please don't read anything into
[1:42:23] this but I wonder sometimes if there's
[1:42:25] things that what we're doing and we're
[1:42:27] saying oh praise God and we leave out of
[1:42:29] the service
[1:42:31] and what God has done he has helped us
[1:42:33] strengthened us he has reminded us given
[1:42:37] us strength to get back up encouragement
[1:42:39] maybe we were so overwhelmed and then we
[1:42:41] go back and we do not cover that place
[1:42:43] whatsoever
[1:42:45] and then here it is
[1:42:47] a week later Days Later month later not
[1:42:51] covered you've got to maintain your
[1:42:54] Liberty
[1:42:56] and we must keep it covered I can't
[1:42:59] cover it for you wife can't your husband
[1:43:00] can't your Daddy Mom nobody can keep it
[1:43:02] covered you got to keep it coming a way
[1:43:05] that Satan might come and he'll come
[1:43:07] right at you to try to punch at you
[1:43:09] remember God gives us Grace and strength
[1:43:12] to keep the punches off us you love him
[1:43:16] tonight
[1:43:18] more we could more we could save it I
[1:43:21] think I think
[1:43:23] the Lord has has spoke to us the things
[1:43:26] that we would have need of tonight
[1:43:30] Hallelujah let's walk in the spirit
[1:43:34] like Paul could say in this and I'll
[1:43:36] just to close on this point
[1:43:38] Paul would admonish the people of God in
[1:43:41] the same chapter galatian Galatians 5.
[1:43:43] walk in the spirit
[1:43:45] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:43:50] the flesh
[1:43:51] that's not a maybe
[1:43:53] that's a cert
[1:43:56] and to walk in the spirit
[1:43:59] is our life just being under his
[1:44:01] influence
[1:44:03] remember
[1:44:04] he's right there with you
[1:44:06] you call him on the scene
[1:44:08] invite him in daily
[1:44:11] invite him to go with you don't go
[1:44:13] nowhere without
[1:44:15] he said over the summer he if I've been
[1:44:16] born of the spirit of God he can't leave
[1:44:18] me but invite him
[1:44:21] invite him
[1:44:22] Lord direct my day no matter where
[1:44:24] you're at in your journey right here
[1:44:26] this evening
[1:44:28] maintain whatever Liberty that God has
[1:44:30] given you this point because there is
[1:44:31] full Liberty for you if if you haven't
[1:44:33] come to that spot the same God is
[1:44:35] working with you
[1:44:37] is speaking to your heart that there's
[1:44:39] even a deeper walk
[1:44:41] and you have a right
[1:44:43] to walk in Liberty
[1:44:45] to take that word you've got a right to
[1:44:47] call on the Lord Jesus
[1:44:50] and when you're tempted you got a right
[1:44:52] to call on him call on him
[1:44:55] he's right there
[1:44:56] he'll strengthen you and you know he
[1:44:59] does he builds your faith it's building
[1:45:01] your testimony because this is your
[1:45:04] testimony Christ's working through your
[1:45:07] life
[1:45:09] God at work
[1:45:11] is that right
[1:45:12] but Rams asked the question
[1:45:16] he's asked the question of you know this
[1:45:19] person said
[1:45:21] brother grandma got a I got a temper
[1:45:25] and he says
[1:45:27] he said how how am I overcome it
[1:45:30] he said I know he said it has to be the
[1:45:32] Lord but I love the part of this
[1:45:33] question that he says he says but
[1:45:35] what can I do
[1:45:39] I love that
[1:45:41] Brother Brad answers
[1:45:44] in a great theological
[1:45:46] deep deep way
[1:45:49] you ready three words
[1:45:52] sweeten your temper with five words
[1:45:56] prayer
[1:45:58] sweeten your temper live prayer
[1:46:03] what was he saying if a person they
[1:46:05] might be on their makeup and however
[1:46:07] they are
[1:46:09] now listen to me
[1:46:11] brother Bram could have just said and
[1:46:13] simply told the person said well you
[1:46:15] need to be born again
[1:46:16] right he could have said that
[1:46:19] but see here's what it was there's
[1:46:21] things with passions and things like
[1:46:22] that and what he's dealing with is this
[1:46:25] person says I want to overcome that
[1:46:29] and so brother Bram says here's how you
[1:46:31] do it
[1:46:32] sweeten your temper with prayer
[1:46:37] you think prayer ain't powerful
[1:46:39] it's inviting the presence of God
[1:46:43] always remember in the midst of your
[1:46:45] Temptation when you're tempted tempted
[1:46:47] temptation is not sin
[1:46:51] I can feel so he can feel bad but it's
[1:46:54] not sin but just remember at that point
[1:46:56] say Lord help me if it's thoughts that
[1:46:59] went through your mind Lord forgive me
[1:47:01] Lord cleanse my mind of those thoughts
[1:47:03] Lord I don't want to entertain them Lord
[1:47:04] if I entertain the thought forgive me
[1:47:06] because there's sometimes we've
[1:47:07] entertained thoughts
[1:47:10] I'm gonna be honest for all of us
[1:47:12] and you know what we have a high priest
[1:47:15] and there's things there's things and
[1:47:17] I'm not talking about whether it was
[1:47:18] entertained for whether it was
[1:47:19] entertained for a nanosecond or a second
[1:47:21] or five second it doesn't matter Lord I
[1:47:24] don't want no birds roosting
[1:47:26] I don't want no birds rooster I only
[1:47:28] want a piece of straw where they flew
[1:47:30] over
[1:47:31] I go out on my porch and on them post
[1:47:34] and birds that come by they come by
[1:47:36] Honey winners that time of year they
[1:47:37] come by
[1:47:38] when is it July
[1:47:41] I ought to be having independence from
[1:47:43] them
[1:47:44] they come by in my post that they got my
[1:47:46] porch and I love my porch and they and
[1:47:49] that post sticks out about that much and
[1:47:51] they think it's a place for them to
[1:47:52] roost
[1:47:57] you all probably know where I'm going
[1:47:58] you gotta I have to continue to go out
[1:48:00] there
[1:48:01] and I've had to go out there and they
[1:48:02] build them nests so fast
[1:48:05] and mud things just like cement that's
[1:48:08] up there on those things
[1:48:09] right
[1:48:13] I'll tell you what I did
[1:48:16] I got the reason I thought I'm tired of
[1:48:19] going out here and if I'm away or I've
[1:48:20] been you know I've been doing this and
[1:48:23] doing that and all of a sudden I turn
[1:48:24] around and think I can go on my front
[1:48:25] porch I look up there's a nest
[1:48:28] pretty soon you got a whole call on me
[1:48:31] so I read where I could take plastic
[1:48:34] water bottles
[1:48:35] and I could cut them water bottles so
[1:48:37] that it has like fingers like this I
[1:48:40] have them like they're like
[1:48:41] so they're like this because when their
[1:48:43] wings set down there they don't like
[1:48:45] them
[1:48:46] they don't look real pretty but you
[1:48:48] can't see it
[1:48:49] driving by my house but inside my porch
[1:48:52] you can look up and I'll take the Deer
[1:48:54] Park wrappers off of them
[1:48:57] but you can look up and see them you
[1:48:58] know what them Birds came by again they
[1:49:00] wanted to flutter down and then little
[1:49:02] from where I cut them plastic bottles
[1:49:04] and then poke things they don't want to
[1:49:05] set down in there
[1:49:12] I had a choice I can either go out there
[1:49:14] every so often and knock down a nest
[1:49:17] or you know what I need to put something
[1:49:19] there so they can't come there
[1:49:24] I tell you we've got an access
[1:49:27] that we can fill our lives with the
[1:49:29] things of God
[1:49:31] I'm talking about praise I'm talking
[1:49:32] about worship I'm talking about singing
[1:49:34] I'm talking about music I'm talking
[1:49:35] about the word because it's all about
[1:49:36] him
[1:49:38] let us fill our lives with the right
[1:49:41] things
[1:49:44] so when the devil goes to try to flutter
[1:49:46] down oh man I don't feel comfortable
[1:49:47] there that little thing is it's poking
[1:49:49] me it's pricking me
[1:49:53] now you know what happened one of them
[1:49:54] bottles right there I know this ain't
[1:49:56] real spiritual but there's an
[1:49:56] application in it
[1:49:59] one of them bottles after a while one of
[1:50:00] them bottles kind of got from the winter
[1:50:02] storm got kind of stretched out a little
[1:50:03] bit you know what happened
[1:50:05] one of them Birds went down and sat down
[1:50:07] in it built a nest
[1:50:10] what'd you do brother Samuel went up
[1:50:12] there and tore it down
[1:50:13] and I put a brand new bottle on there
[1:50:15] where it was like that I'm not just
[1:50:18] going to let it sit there I didn't build
[1:50:20] that for you to come and make your nest
[1:50:21] in come on friends I know the mind is a
[1:50:25] no man's land but that means I can fill
[1:50:29] it with the things of God
[1:50:31] I can fill it with the things of God I
[1:50:34] can put on a message I'm not there
[1:50:36] trying to oh I got to get every word I
[1:50:38] got confidence that the spirit of God
[1:50:40] will brood over my life Mama You Got
[1:50:43] Confidence when you're watching the
[1:50:45] children or your ironing clothes or
[1:50:46] you're doing this or on the job you got
[1:50:48] confidence
[1:50:49] that the spirit of God will move and
[1:50:51] give you what you need
[1:50:53] and even as you're listening worshiping
[1:50:56] you love him
[1:50:58] mama
[1:51:01] Lord have mercy
[1:51:03] listen
[1:51:13] would you love him
[1:51:15] oh don't you just want to just serve him
[1:51:17] with everything in you Lord help me
[1:51:20] help me Lord give me strength
[1:51:23] help me to maintain
[1:51:25] My Liberty the Liberty you've given me
[1:51:28] Lord
[1:51:29] let's pray father
[1:51:32] Lord You're So merciful to us
[1:51:35] you're so mindful of Lord every every
[1:51:37] need and every heart and every life
[1:51:39] that's gathered here
[1:51:40] those that are streaming Lord not able
[1:51:42] to be here
[1:51:44] father we ask o God that
[1:51:47] you would just the Lord move according
[1:51:50] to every need
[1:51:52] Lord I I think oh god with the certainty
[1:51:55] of how that you led us Lord to look upon
[1:51:58] these things
[1:52:00] and to think that if Aiken would have
[1:52:02] just heeded to the word and stayed with
[1:52:04] It In the Heat of the battle
[1:52:06] it had been a different story
[1:52:09] the Lord
[1:52:11] I know Lord is your children we are not
[1:52:13] perfect
[1:52:15] Lord God just reading from the different
[1:52:18] places Lord will your Prophet had spoke
[1:52:20] of that that
[1:52:22] we know we make mistakes
[1:52:25] we know we fail
[1:52:27] but Lord that Perfection is your life
[1:52:29] within us
[1:52:31] it's not our desire to do anything
[1:52:33] that's wrong but I I pray tonight God
[1:52:35] that as you've laid it Lord to help and
[1:52:37] the strength and I believe God that
[1:52:39] you've come to speak to our hearts to
[1:52:41] strengthen us that to realize to every
[1:52:43] young person middle age old whatever
[1:52:44] that Temptation itself is not sin
[1:52:48] it's Heating
[1:52:49] when that comes our way may we look to
[1:52:52] you
[1:52:53] and Lord that you would be our refuge
[1:52:58] may you just help us Lord I sense Lord
[1:53:00] even as you took the song service Lord
[1:53:02] here tonight singing of the comforter
[1:53:04] Abiding and being our refuge all those
[1:53:07] places Lord it was you setting Lord the
[1:53:10] stage for yourself Lord it was you
[1:53:12] creating that Lord and just directing
[1:53:14] our hearts thank you for that tonight
[1:53:15] Lord that God that you would direct our
[1:53:18] hearts in that way Lord that how you
[1:53:20] were going to come and minister to us
[1:53:21] and we believe that and we're thankful
[1:53:23] for it Lord that you are our comforter I
[1:53:26] pray tonight God that may you just
[1:53:28] continue to strengthen everyone of us
[1:53:30] may each one walk out Lord here tonight
[1:53:32] and realizing that dear God
[1:53:34] oh Father I think David said it in the
[1:53:37] Psalms if it had not been that the Lord
[1:53:39] was on my side
[1:53:41] oh God Lord you're in ever-present help
[1:53:44] in the time of trouble may each one Lord
[1:53:46] when they're going maybe through the
[1:53:48] heat of the Temptation or something at
[1:53:50] that moment Lord God I remember Lord
[1:53:53] when Lord my life when you got a hold of
[1:53:56] my life
[1:53:57] and I can remember Lord that first
[1:53:59] moment Lord when you've got to hold my
[1:54:01] life I remember my brother standing
