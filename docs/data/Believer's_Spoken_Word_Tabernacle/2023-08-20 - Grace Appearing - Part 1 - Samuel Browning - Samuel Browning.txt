you must not have had your Wheaties this morning I said isn't that wonderful amen the love of God Amen how wonderful he is amen how great how great is his mercy and his grace to us amen we're just going to let you have your seats here just for a moment um sorry I don't mean to have you uh up and down and uh but I want to say that it's just a the Lord has given us such a wonderful day and a wonderful time here to be together this morning and just so appreciate amend the worship and knowing that that God is in control amen every time that we come together there's something that is good that's going to happen amen and sometimes it's not always together what we feel or what we see but he never did ask us do you feel it or do you see it do you believe it because the word has power transforming power within it that when that word is received the word will perform what it said it will do in our lives and you think of that even in many different instances in the prophets meetings where he would speak concerning that there were people sitting there who even in the midst of that moment thought that they did not have the faith that was needed to receive their healing but then how you would hear the prophet would say you didn't think you had enough faith for your healing it just goes to show us more and more very simple things that we hear but you know they become more endeared to our hearts that it's not us and that doesn't mean that we just you know just sitting around it just shows the supernatural just God just engaging and just get focused on him and when we're focused on him there's a direct connection between that inner man and him Supernatural things that's taking place beyond what we even and ourselves think because sometimes we think it's all about our mind but God looks upon the heart then you find different ones that brother Brahm said they they were the same way in the meeting and he said after the service after the meeting was over days later they witnessed the effect of the word in their life and they were healed amen the same way that brother Branham when he prayed for different ones at the end of the adoption series and they're Desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said you just keep your eyes on and he said and you'll see it he said you'll watch your life and how that your life will change amen because it's a promise that God made and that's what we're focused on is him and that's that's the whole purpose when we when we come together like this it's that we might see him that's the whole purpose that we've come together we want to see him we want to draw from him we all have needs in our lives and we need to hear from him and we've come here I believe every one of us we've come with the purpose I trust we have and that desire is this Lord I want to be more like you amen I want my life to be further changed I want everything to be in line with you Lord and we certainly I want to leave as a better Christian than when I came in here amen with a greater determination Amen on my heart and life and and so this morning I I know that um for parents and things like that we had canceled the youth meeting there at our home the other uh on Friday evening and uh it certainly wasn't because of uh my wife or anything we just thought there's been a lot that's dealed with sickness you know after camp and it's not just here I know that you know if you're over there for brother Nathaniel's different ones um and you know we were some together on Monday evening and you know they were talking about some of the sickness and things they had just been through and so it's just kind of everywhere and um you know so my wife you know this morning she wasn't she hadn't been uh really kind of battling throughout the week but you know sometimes you have drainage and things like that and so I know different ones and uh but she's not here with me and I told her this morning you know she had was able to go to the clinic and and see them you know when they first opened and uh so I I just really miss it when she's not here with me I love all of you all I love seeing you but there's just nothing like having my wife with me it's just like when I say when I go to different places to Ministry just something about it I like having her here with me and so we just want to just just keep her in prayer in different ones and and also I think was there a prayer request for sister Michelle I don't know who read them okay so we want to keep her in in prayer because of the infection that's there in her toe that that um where the bleeding on her toe uh you know cut something a pretty deep cut and it's it's traveling there up the lake and so they put you know how when they put that Mark there on the leg and it doesn't look good but we you know she's in good hands because she's in God's hands and so we just want to just continue to keep our sister in prayer the Lord will strengthen her in a very uh a special way that God will touch her and I know that brother Bobby and Chrissy have also been dealing with some things as well we want to just say to sister Judith and brother Vivian and I know that brother Constantine's not here but they you heard the request on Thursday and they they um I don't want to say they lost their father I want to say that their father went on home to be with the Lord because when they're serving the lord we don't lose anything they're they're there standing in God's presence and I was speaking you know just even to Sister Judith the other day and then even with brother Vivian brother Constantine just uh expressing things to them as well that you know their father he was he was 84 is is that correct your father was 84 years old 82. and uh so and he was pastoring and he had pastored for I think 20 years and so um you know I just think of that holding this message this glorious gospel and uh you know brother Branham said it like this and I I don't want anybody to interpret this in the wrong way but in there's a man that can turn on the light there was a sister who passed away very suddenly like that and brother Bram says what that is he says he said it must not have been anything that was against her because God gave Grace just to slip right out now that doesn't mean that if anybody has to suffer that there's something against her but I think you know what is it that if God would allow someone to even if there's something to linger you know what it does it causes us to examine everything and you know what that is that's the grace of God that's the grace of God and you know to me if someone if it they're in a place and they're dying and they're passing and it comes to that place and they reach out and say forgive me and the reaching out to this hey forgiveness is something that is resides in the heart of the believer that's what Paul said is that true it's Christ in us and so to me that's that's tremendous you know and to me that's God's grace it's the grace of God for us to even exit out of this body in that way but I I just want to say that to them we we love you all and we're continuing to pray amen God would strengthen them because sister Judith also just recently here within under two years you know she had lost her husband and so we just want to remember them in prayer that God will continue to strengthen them during this time and give them strength throughout these moments and I think that I know that God does give us the strength that we have because we're going to admit you know they will miss them just like when we miss loved ones they'll miss them on this side but there's a comfort that we can draw from to know they're standing right there amen as a matter of fact just that moment there's just that quick of a changing of a dimension it goes that quick it moves into that place and so I was telling sister Judith the other day I said I wonder I said of all the different ones converts and different ones that we're waiting at the river for when your father crossed amen I still think of that sister Miranda when you didn't know that my father was passing that night and you had a dream that brother Louis came to you and he was all dressed up and you said Louie where are you going he said I'm going to a special men's meeting tonight amen scripture you know the Bible said Jacob he will be gathered with his people and God makes a way and you know it's just brother Bram says God knows that Crossing is going to be hard he said but God just makes a way and brother Branham expressed it in this way and and I think of my dad sitting there and when he had that little that drainage of his lungs remember you said it felt like a little bee sting brother Brown talks about how that even when we pass from Death it's just a quick little sting and we're gone I'm glad that he took the big sting out of it aren't you [Applause] but while we're here in this life amen while we're here we're going to keep pressing and there's a desire in your life you say I I want to stay right here you know well there's work for us there's work to be done amen and the God desires to do more in our life we've all here for a purpose and and so we want to serve that purpose I just want to also welcome visitors that we have here Josh and Mariah God bless you good to see you amen and sister Mr pansy God bless you and the sister Doris no two forgive me you all look so much alike so I guess you can't blame one another on that you just got to blame Mom and Dad right but that's a compliment as well I I just my mind was thinking I knew that it was from here but God bless you Sister Wilma it's so good to have you here with us amen and uh different ones amen God bless you I want to have um if we could I want to have special prayer with those of of teachers that we would have here today and as our students and different ones are preparing to go back to school and my we certainly need the grace of God Amen as they're walking amen the students teachers and parents and you know throughout the time you know I know even as a parent I thought that when you know I stepped away from teaching I wouldn't look forward to the end of the year I still look forward to the end of the school year I look forward to a great anticipation so but you know I think you know certainly it's the grace of God and you know I think of how when Moses when his his mother you know she she nursed him for those three months but there was a promise that God gave her and when she committed Moses there upon that in that little Ark she sent him out upon the Water but she had a comfort because she held a promise that an angel of the Lord had come there to her husband and had confirmed that promise and so she had a comfort I tell you there's a lot of there's a lot of things if you dwell on it that's out there in the world that can be very scary I know we have some Public School homeschool and so forth college but let me just say this to you just keep your eyes on him as you walk in those schools as colleges and so forth Just say God help me to get what I need to get and then just to move on Lord I don't want to get caught up in the things that are around but let me help me to keep my eyes on you and let my light let the light of Christ shine through me amen because that's a wonderful thing that God would work through your life and and that's what we want we want to just ask God's blessing and protection and sometimes there's a lot of things that might seem like you know especially with the day and age that we're living in sometimes there's a awful lot it's like awful lot of junk that you have to weed through it'd be like somebody bringing you a steak and you remember how they used to put parsley on your plates maybe there's a restaurant that still does that to me I always thought it's I didn't order it because you were putting parsley odor because it was steak but it'd be like having a whole plate of parsley and one little piece of steak I'm not going to eat the parsley get it off the plate and it's the steak so there might be many times in classes and a lot of things there could be a whole lot of parsley you say God help me to get that little piece that I need because God knows what he listen God knows what he's placed in you as young people and those skills that are there God's already placed them in there and it's not a teacher or anybody else that puts them it's just God coming it makes you aware of those things that's already into you as much with scripture I could preach on that but it's very true and so when we look at this let's just look to God and I ask that if the different ones teachers parents students if you'd like to come forward right now unless let's just have a time of special prayer together and I'd like all of you to to join in with us Amen in prayer amen amen amen let's just as we all just join together amen God just be with each of us and that's it just come on him I'm God bless you amen I sure loved you all amen God bless you amen let's just let's just look to the Lord now and just a word of prayer as I think everybody's kind of in that place amen he said I never leave you nor forsake you said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age amen don't worry he's with you amen hallelujah you stand for him you'll stand for you amen Heavenly Father Lord as we just come to you Lord in this moment God is these Lord of precious Lord young people Lord children Lord there's teachers standing here Lord God Lord parents Lord each one o God we are in need of your grace Lord as we lord even approaching upon this school year Lord we're asking God for your grace upon every one of their lives Lord and may you so guide them Lord you know what you've placed within them Lord and I pray that God even in the times Lord not only at the delight and their testimony would shine but I pray that God that Lord through every moment Lord thereof learning your Prophet told us in the message key to the door that there is a key to mathematics there's a key to science Lord that's an understanding that God that you would unlock for us Lord and so I pray oh God that you would just as you've given the skills Lord in for every one of them may you give them the grace Lord to understand Lord God what's being taught and Lord help them to apply it Lord you know the plans that you have for their lives oh God and I ask that Lord may your protection lord of the Holy Spirit oh God just be Lord God right upon them and around them Lord lead him Lord God in every Lord moment Lord guide him Lord I pray father May their light Lord so shine o God lord amongst Lord this Dark World Lord I pray that God for every parent Lord May the peace of almighty God as the Lord with sinned Lord their children to school or even Lord in homeschooling or college that Lord we're trusting you Lord God that you would watch over them Lord for we have committed them Lord into your hands O God that the great angel of almighty God would go before him Lord and direct him Lord and watch over him and return them to us safely Lord we pray Lord we love you and we thank you now Lord and we commit everyone Lord into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you amen God bless you amen amen Hallelujah if we could let's just stand I just like to go to Titus Chapter 2. and I'm just going to read their at verse 11. I want to say also sister Caroline forgive me I said here and I have seen you even smiling as I've been talking throughout welcome home welcome home brother Alex God bless you it's good to have you here too amen verse 11. verse 11 of Titus Chapter 2. for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself A peculiar people zealous of good works amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated probably with all the up and down you feel like you've got your exercise maybe that'll give you another excuse for another role or another hamburger today but I just want to just speak here actually fought the title that it was going to take but the Lord just seemed to just just just change some things a little bit here this morning in prayer not so much that what I have before me but the thought within behind it and I want to just speak here this morning just really drawing from these verses of scripture upon the thought of Grace appearing Grace appearing and in Titus 2 11 I'm going to read this from the Amplified version here and it simply means for the grace of God this is how that verse is written for the grace of God his unmerited favor and blessing has come forward which means it has appeared for the deliverance from sin and the Eternal salvation For All Mankind so that when we look at this of Grace itself and that of appearing the word appear here it means to to to give light to something or to bring to light or to appear or become visible you know many of you have seen this out here right now if you look sometimes during the day at certain times of the month you you can be looking in the sky and all of a sudden you'll see oh there there's the moon and it's pretty faint but it's you can see it but as the as the time goes on and the day is passing the moon itself will come into that place of an evening where it's very visible and so when we're looking at this here of the grace of God the grace of God appearing is where God's grace itself becomes visible and so to become known or to clearly show oneself and Paul picks this up in second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 8 and he says be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoner now I want you to understand that Paul's when he's talking of the testimony of Our Lord he's not speaking of just someone giving testimony of works that were done in the life of the Lord Jesus but he's dealing with the testimony of Our Lord speaking of God's own life of what he did in the body of Jesus Christ in that Corporal body he is doing the same thing and has witnessed the same thing through that Ministry and so as you have believed be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord because Satan would not care how much that we could speak or just to a rehearse testimonies of the of him of God's grace appearing to us or to the lives of others but what Satan wants to keep every life from is Grace appearing in you that's his that's his desire is to hold that back and so notice the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his prisoner so we all know that it's never been that Christ himself uh and when I say Christ I'm talking of the anointing all the way down the scripture says even in Isaiah 53 he is despised and rejected now this is before the manifestation in that Corporal body that we know as Jesus before the human name was ever expressed but it was always despised every time that Christ himself would begin to reveal himself it was a portion that was revealed in Noah he made himself known through Abraham all the way down and as he was making himself known through each of them it was the Believers the elect of that hour that were affected by that appearing and at that appearing they themselves not only witness that appearing but they became partakers of that appearing in their own lives they became a part of the grace that was appearing to them so this is where Paul said do not be ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor of me as prisoner but be thou a partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works now remember brother Brandon when we were dealing with some weeks ago in the depths of God's grace when we were speaking upon that you or I when God deals with our heart it's not us trying to Merit God's grace there's no way possible that you and I can Merit anything of God the grace of God is that which is we are undeserving but God steps forward to make himself known and then we believe that expression is that right that's that's the true works within it all because a person can work and work and work and work and they can do a lot of works but they're still empty on the inside the Rich Young Ruler was that way he was very empty he said there's one thing that I lack yet he had done a lot of he had done all of the all of the Commandments and but yet he realized he was lacking and what he was lacking was the most important thing and that was the Living God he was lacking eternal life so it's not Paul is not speaking against work he's just saying God did not look down and call you and I because of our works so God's Not In other words if I can give this simple illustration you know I remember being in uh uh uh you know in elementary school and sometimes you know there were a few things here or there you know that you could be you know kind of good at you know in different things and and so you know when they line you up on the wall and back then in those days we had three recesses where I went and man that was a blessing uh you know we had 15-minute recess and then the recess after lunch but my point I'm getting to is that many times you know we I enjoyed playing football during that time you know and then enjoyed playing kickball I always enjoyed those two things but you know when we would go to to to start lining up you know they line you up on the wall kind of like gym class and they say Okay count off you know a b a b or whatever more and you know sometimes you see the a b a b and you know how it is that people they go if you give the kids long enough they'll sort themselves out so while they hey switch places with me here switch places with me here you know because they're looking at and I want this person on my team Hannah I want this person on my team or or you know that then this one you know or if you're just chosen you know they have two people and they pick the teams I'll pick this one and this one then and you know you what you're trying to do is you you're wanting to try to assemble the best team and I I use that example to say it like this that God himself did not Choose You and I based on any works or abilities that's Romans 9 according to the election of God before Jacob or Esau any had done anything God chose Jacob before the foundation world and that choosing is actually Jacob was in Christ the whole time Jacob was ordained to be part of the expression of God's grace and that's why brother Brandon when you hear him preach the message Masterpiece and he's dealing with the four pedestals that the actual body is built upon and you know those those four pedestals that are there where you have that of you know of um uh it goes through of of of the the election of God and then dealing in Abraham and then the love of God in Isaac and then he comes to Jacob and he says and Jacob represents the grace of God and I like how brother Graham says he said anybody reads the life of Jacob you got to know the grace of God and I'm not just talking about before he wrestled with the angel I'm talking about after he wrestled with the angel too and then you have the fourth part Joseph is perfection that's where the body it rests upon those upon that pedestal and so we recognize that Jacob even like that the grace of God came to him and then that Grace appeared not only appearing to him when it came to Bethel but then that Grace moved down into Jacob's life and it brought a transformation to where that Prince that Israel on the inside became revealed and it took the presence of the Angel of the Lord moving in Jacob's life now I want you to notice this that lay in Jacob the whole time but it took a time to wear that everything around Jacob Laban father-in-law all those right there he saw their countenance changed towards him it was God calling him back to the place of Bethel where God had in his grace had made himself known to Jacob Jacob didn't go to Bethel because he thought I'm going to go seek God no he was tired on his journey going to get a wife right and into him Bethel was like Bethel is be like any other city that we would think of but you see God had a special appointment for Jacob and it was the grace of God not any of Jarrett Jacob's merits that God's grace stepped on the scene and made himself known to Jacob that I am the god of thy father Abraham then he calls him back to that place and Jacob is in a place where he comes into desperation that there there is a need in his life in other words if I can say it like this Jacob was tired of being Jacob that that of Israel lay in his life the whole time is that right because when he wrestled with the angel of the Lord the scripture says that he blessed him there when Jacob asked for who are you tell me your name I want to know who you are and remember he touched him and he said he blessed him there it was not talking about a physical location God blessed him there it was in that area of his life though the blessing had been pronounced over him by the prophet of the hour Isaac is that right the blessing had been pronounced over him but he had to come into the realities of that blessing and Jacob was desperate and there in his life upon that part that was from God there he blessed him there and then Jacob's life becomes a display of God's grace walking in flesh I may be a little ahead of myself but I'm just following him I it's not about me it's about him so not according to our works not according to our own Works everybody with me but according to his own purpose Grace remember as we said before in depths of God's grace God's Grace has been standing for us even before we even recognized it it's been standing and even with things that we in ourselves were not even fully aware of yet Grace was standing there and waiting and it was holding for you and I because why God won't lose one why because you have to understand you're not something separate from the word you don't all together on a certain day become the word but when the Holy Spirit comes then you become the word made flesh it's the quickening power that comes upon your life to transform your life to bring that word life into expression so you you as the prophet puts it like this in Christ the mystery says when he has taken the book he said remember you are the words of the book [Music] so when God is taken here now in this hour the lamb taking the book it's signifying of Christ taking a hold of the life of the believer in this hour and it's not just he doesn't individually but it's also Christ himself coming to take a hold of his bride and let me tell you the whole that Christ has upon our life is not like the hold of a man but it is the hold of his Amazing Grace it is the love of God that is shed abroad in our hearts it's Christ himself stepping forward so it's according to his own purpose and Grace so there is none of us that have any bragging rights on our own selves notice he which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now main manifest so what was it's just like the things that we're seeing now the things you see in your life the appearing of Christ in your life this this was already in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world what is it it's gone unfolding himself and when he unfolds himself it's very key as I was speaking to the older youth Terror at the Youth Camp even in their individual life and bringing it down to practicalities that God himself does and all of a sudden just unroll everything but it's slowly unfolds itself it's God slowly unfolding himself in your life but now now it's made manifest by the appearing notice by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel now I want to just say it in this way when we look at it if I can go go here in the Scriptures it referring back to in John chapter 1 verse 11 it says he came unto his own and his own received him not now remember he was neither Jew nor Gentile in blood right but he came through he came according to the promise that was given clear back there in Genesis 3 15. that promise was that behold uh it comes more you remember it continues to come with greater clarity as it did in Isaiah Behold a virgin shall conceive is that right and so we're finding this promise see here God made a promise now let me just say this when God makes a promise I know it's very simple and I know that these are things that many times we can just uh I want to say it in the right way can just rehearse these things out of our mouth but many times it's to come back to the simple parts that when God has made a promise God is Not relying on any human instrumentality to help him out that's why the fall happened in the beginning that's why Ishmael came along On and On anytime human instrumentality and you might say well why would human instrumentality hey the prophet tells us in the message Shalom he tells it in perfect Faith he goes to it in greatest battle of thought perfect strength praying all the way through you'll hear of how that sometimes when he says a person sees the miraculous or the supernatural or they see this take place and they reach out and say I can do that too what then what is failing to recognize is is that yes there is a potential but if that's what God has for you to do it will not be you doing it it'll be you yielding and God doing it through you that's Grace hi so he came to his own in his own received him not they when he as he stood there they didn't want anything to do with him the Pharisees and on and on they don't want nothing to do with him even the way that he came and he came according to his word Behold a virgin shall conceive and you would look at him you would think why would God say it in such a way like that well it's very simple because why would be the need for the Virgin birth it's to undo that sexual Affair that was back there at the beginning because it couldn't it couldn't come Redemption could not come through and by a sexual blood that was already polluted that's why it took God himself creating a blood cell that was separate from the instrumentality of man why because human received if it was a blood of any other man I don't care how righteous they are you would still receive their weaknesses but inside of this Blood it was an innocent blood Peter called it the blood of Christ John would rank by inspiration in divine revelation that this blood has brought a perfect loosening to our lives in other words this Blood was so perfect that it was able to dismiss the accusations of the accuser and through the Holy Spirit coming according to that word when raised the faith of the people to believe I am free it's Grace appearing but as many as received him that's what's important as received him to them he gave power now that word is the right to become the sons of God they they already were but now you have a right that's administered to you it's like things you find out on your contract and your job or things you find out on your home insurance policy things that you didn't know that you had and someone makes you aware of the rights you've got just because they make you aware of the rights you got don't mean you have them and when it's made known it's a moment to pursue what is rightfully yours right oh let us not forget the Lord and all his benefits is that right notice which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God once again it's not the instrumentality of man many times we want to see we want to see our loved ones we want to see our children we want to see other ones we want to see we want to see them saved but remember it is not our human instrumentality that does it but to say God lead their heart to the place Lord Lord give me the leadership that's needed help me Lord to restrain and know when to say and when not to say you're saying why because if you do it or I do it guess what then we're their savior and then we've got to prop them up we've got to keep them up and we that that's the problem that's that's where church program has gone wrong is they they want to to to bring people in by program but God already has a program and that program is repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's God's program and verse 14 and the word notice this was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word it didn't just come and go come and go but the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the prophets had experienced the anointing and then it wouldn't leave off of them then it would come back upon them then it wouldn't leave off of them but here whosoever thou seeth the spirit descending and abiding upon the same is he what is it God was declaring now through Redemption Redemption is revealed through the spirit descending and Abiding and when his Spirit abides it cannot do anything different than his nature and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory full somebody say fool of Grace and Truth so if there's anything that's full of grace and it ain't speaking truth it ain't the word I don't care why many scriptures they can give you but if that truth is not calling you to a true life of the word it's Error I don't care how you feel remember when the words made flesh it's full of grace and truth is that right and truth it is corrective truth is there to elevate to bring forth that which is really true right because all the perversion in all of the acts that we see is only a perversion of the truth so he came to undo the perversion and the hold of that that we were held in so the word being made flesh this is who he was and remember when he came because I want you to see to believe the manifested word of God brings forth the ordained effect of the word of God in our lives remember it when they said to him uh they're asking him uh um uh in John 6 uh that we might what must we do that we might work the works of God see they're seeing the works of God they saw this man who was crippled get up on the Sabbath day they have witnessed the healing of God they have witnessed the miraculous of God listen they knew there when nobody else could do this but almighty God that testimony came Nicodemus came by night but like the prophet said at least he got there is that right at least he got there he said we know that thou art a teacher come from God right and that understanding is what condemned that whole group because they saw the manifestation as Paul calls it the knowledge of the truth and they failed to walk in it just like the spies that went over in the land they saw the land but they failed to walk in it let me tell you something when you've when you've come face to face with the grace of God and you turn away from it there is no more repentance for sins brother Samuel that's pretty strong it was pretty strong when the prophet preached Abraham's Grace Covenant confirmed in Middletown Ohio and the prophet said I have witnessed in here he said lives that should have responded to the word of God he said but they have rejected it and turned it away they have been face to face with the truth brother and sister I don't have that Vision to be able to see that but I do know and understand this that it's something that we cannot just set on the fence and watch and wonder you've got to make a move one way or the other if it if you're for it be for it if you're against it be against it [Applause] you gotta make up your mind mama can't do it for you Daddy can't do it for you oh praise the Lord when they came to it notice they came standing there and they said Jesus said for you to believe he said here's the work of God believe on him whom he hath sent that's the work of God to believe do you understand what that means that means that you and I are not able in ourselves to believe without the work of God it takes the Holy Spirit moving Upon Our Lives to to ignite to believe and to recognize that I believe and what did they say our fathers ate man in the wilderness it was excuses they ain't man in the wilderness and Jesus said and they're everyone dead he wasn't talking about in the grave he's talking about eternally lost they send away their day of Grace they rejected the grace of God so to see that where where it's at they are they're they're eternally separate because they've rejected the full working of the spirit of Grace remember the last message we were speaking on that they did despite unto the spirit of Grace it was God's grace wanting to take him into the land is that right it's God's grace that wants to take you into the promises that's the grace of God now notice and they manifest but you see coming to the uh a Promised Land the Manifest his victory through them now Zechariah 4 and verse 6. it says you remember when he saw the seven golden candlesticks that were there which are representative of God's working through seven Gentile ages and Zachariah is is taken by the angel of the Lord to look upon this and he's asked the question what are these and Zechariah being a prophet cannot speak unless understanding is given to him directly so the angel answers him and speaks unto him this is what you are seeing in those seven golden candlesticks this is the word of the Lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou old great Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it so who where in this and this ministry of zerubbabel which is a type even of this last day Ministry where where the Church of the Living God is built Back Again by the power of God and as the word is speaking the word that's being spoken to this body that's upon Earth is a word that is come with shoutings of Grace Grace unto it and the grace that is coming is that the headstone himself the word is coming and is standing here in our midst it is the grace of God that has appeared to you and I that's what this message is it is the shoutings of God's delivering Grace Upon Our Lives it is the Jubilee that is announced in this hour it is God declaring where the book has been taken and loose it is declaring we have arrived at the end this is the end time this is what all of them have waited upon they have longed for this moment to appear and let me just say this just as much as the prophets have longed for this moment to appear what do you think that hungering was inside of your life what is the hungering inside of your heart it is for Grace to appear and let me ask you who put that Grace there God put that Grace there it was Grace that put it there it's Grace that put it there you couldn't have done it I couldn't have done it on my hook I didn't put it there Sunday school didn't put it there thank God for all of that but it was God that put his seed inside of you and me if you haven't listened that message of Grace in a while I'd encourage you to listen to in 1961 in August I I've been listening to a lot and I spirit of God just Hereafter studying many of these things before even before Camp the Lord just told me go back and listen to it again I said okay and uh I just listened to this statement here in the message of Grace brother about him here at the end of it in prayer he said oh Jesus Messiah of God thou art ever near the people are aware that you are the Son of God that you are here now your great signs and wonders are being proved bless them Father bless them I pray now let me just pause here for a moment for the mind that would wonder and say how can he say that the Son of God that the Messiah that he is now here you have to understand Jesus did not send to the woman at the well north of Philip nor to Nathanael he did not send them a picture and say look for this guy when he steps off the airplane right I've had Brothers overseas and different ones and so when I'm stepping off the plane I kind of let them know I've got on a green jacket and I maybe wear you know something kind of bright I've got a red hat on or something like that and I'll just let him know because you know one thing it was somebody in a picture don't always look the same when they come out you know that's why I don't ever marry anybody by a picture you never know what's been photoshopped but she God didn't send down a picture as far as a picture for somebody to look for oh he'll be about this height he'll have on a beard he'll wear sandals his robe will be about like this and this will be that's not how they would recognize him remember the Believers recognize him as he appears to them in the Fulfillment of his word as a matter of fact to the believer in the flesh itself their mind can look at that flesh and say can this be that man can this be that person but there's something that goes beyond our flesh what is it it is God contacting that part on the inside that's causing you and I to believe so it's not flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven it is a supernatural word of the Living God so how did that woman at the well know that he was the Messiah she didn't have a picture of him hearing me Church but there was promises in the word there was promises and she knew enough when Messiah cometh this is what he will do why because his nature never changes I'm God and I change the heart she knew he'll come according to the word and when he began to move according to the word and Discerning the thoughts of her heart she began to say I perceive thou art a prophet he continued to make himself known to her what was it Grace appearing to her when she left that well are you hearing me now she left all her self-help books there [Applause] preach brother Samuel I think I will she laughed very stages to be a better woman she had met the god who takes a life of a love of woman and makes a Proverbs 35 31 godly woman out of her what was it she recognized the grace appearing to her she didn't deserve it but Grace came to her and that Grace appeared she received it and then she becomes a trophy of God's grace [Music] you never catch her doing those things again you know why she received the grace don't wrestle with it receive it don't wrestle with it receive it is that all right notice brother but I'm saying watch this oh my can I I bless them Father bless them I pray may they right now believe with all their heart that you the Messiah is the one standing here no one could do that you see what he's pointing to what's been taking place with healing nobody can do that hey friends let me say it to you like this the Bible says the books could not contain right them the Miracles and the Wonders the signs that were done in the ministry in his Earthly Ministry is that right and the prophet could stand there and declare and say he had success had more success in the humble Ministry he gave me than he did in his own Earthly Ministry and brother Brahm stops and said notice I said he he he's had more success oh my God my it's just hard to stay focused here and not run and preach and my mama you understand friends who it is that's in our midst [Music] it's not just a good service who's in our midst I'm telling you it's Jesus Christ the son of God it's the Messiah the anointed wire of this hour [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah and if you keep trying to figure it out you're going to miss it it ain't to figure out it's to believe and if you don't believe be honest and say help thou my unbelief no one could do that that's humanly impossible Lord Miracle to see the power of Messiah come into a little humble place like this because that you promised it Lord how many have you been to Brandon Tabernacle before I was there just to pre just a a couple years ago and I was there and we spent a couple hours in there my brother took us around and it was just us me and my family and um that isn't anything that I could arrange that just God arranged that and uh you know and you hear Brother Brown talking about how that when they added on and everything and the brother was walking us through of where where the boundaries were wow and how small it was before they even added on it's already a simple little place is that right it's already a simple little place but to see the boundaries of how small that it was even before this is when brother Brown's preaching this 1961 they hadn't even had it on yet but God had already been moving before 1961. you see what you say brother Samuel he's saying that the Messiah of God is there what were the seals for it was to uncover The God Who was already here all the time that's why the prophet could say I believe it's in 1957 he said my Ministry is to now declare the son of man is here now that's 1957. why he's a focus there is that Inspire that inspiration this is what the ministry of Malachi 4 is for is to declare he is now here and that's a Ministry it's in the Bride of Jesus Christ to declare that he is now here not just here in this building but in fact Tabernacle in that Tabernacle in that Tabernacle in that Tabernacle declaring he's here and if he's here while doing everything is possible the miracle to see the power of Messiah come into a little humble place like this because that you promised it Lord because your grace oh look at this statement this just sent me around for Loops because your grace is here to Grace us how many want to be graced how many been graced Lord I want more of that Grace because your grace is here to Grace us because that it's your promise to do it you have done it we see that you don't leave your people he's done it he's the one who's promised it he's done it and he's the one who does not leave his people now watch here even when we look the manifestation of God's grace as we've been looking is that of that of the appearing of God's grace is God coming to fulfill his promise but you know you know how it is when when you have every one of us got alarms on our phone now probably right I got so many things that go off and sometimes I wonder is that alarm to remind me of another alarmer anybody else like that I don't know I mean I got my my fingers filled with reminders and markers on my calendar but you know what that is when that goes off and it comes across between you know what that's the new reminds you there's an event you're supposed to be at and let me just say this the grace of God Appears to let us know the hour has arrived Our Moment has arrived oh that's why God can make a declaration this is bride time this is that time this is the Fulfillment of the word of God because remember how many men when God made a promise that Israel was sojourn in a Strange Land for 400 years you remember that and God said I'll deliver him with a mighty hand is that right now remember God himself said what would take place and they went down there and they went down there and they became slaves is that right things change you know the situation they forgot who Joseph was and pharaoh and all those things rising up but all that was also working in in conjunction with the promise of almighty God because God made a promise and though 400 years had passed and now even when Moses came on the scene remember in his own efforts he heard about the promise he had been taught that promise from when he was very young thank God for a Godly mother that would rehearse the promises of God you know that's only our responsibility as parents our responsibility as parents is not to save them it's not to fill them with the Holy Ghost but it is to rehearse the promises of God keep him in an atmosphere in our home and in other meetings and right here within the assembly keep them in as much under the influence of almighty God until they come to a place like Isaiah did said woe is me for I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell among unclean people if there's anything that ever brings our young person or anybody else to the recognition that they are a sinner yet takes the presence of almighty God is that right now notice this it would take God's presence coming to fulfill that word and hear Moses 40 years later 440 years now here he is he goes to try to you know to to to to to bring him out but all he does is kill one Egyptian nothing and yet you can ask Moses Moses what are you trying to do well I'm trying to fulfill the promise but the problem was his human instrumentality now what he needed was is a fresh visitation to the throne of God he needed his vision renewed he needed to meet God personally and that God would confirm it because in the presence of God Moses offered God all kinds of excuses of why he was an unfit subject why because in the presence of God the very thing that he tried to use to free Israel it became nothing but a failure in the presence of God his human weaknesses stood out and that's what he tried to offer God but God didn't want his human weaknesses to operate the promise God said I am come down to deliver my people is that right so then we find Moses going back into Egypt there and when Moses goes back in remember that in itself it was God's grace to his people let me read Hosea 12 13 and by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt and by Prophet was he preserved Exodus 13 3 I love that Moses said unto the people remember this day in which you came out from Egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place now the scripture just said over in Hosea by a prophet but what was it it was the word of God in fulfillment God's grace had appeared to them and they receiving that Grace they received the strength that comes with that to walk out of Egypt God dismantled every oh my every demon power that wanted to raise up every complex every anxiety every fear everything that wanted to rise up and try to speak against us you're not worthy of this you can't go you've been in bondage to this you've done this over and over and over but the grace of God appeared to them and Grace overruled it moved beyond all their failures their shortcomings their human instrumentality and they believe the manifestation of God's grace and what did it do it broke every hole that was upon their lives [Applause] Hallelujah so every time that a message has come that message has always come with grace mercy and deliverance right we're already in trouble we need help you got a flat tire you don't need somebody to come along the roadside and say you got a flat tire duh I know that you need a message of grace and mercy and deliverance let me just say it to you like this so you understand it I speak that statement as he gives it to me that this word is not a word that has come to condemn you or put you down but it's a word that has come with grace to be able to separate you from the real you on the inside [Applause] are you hearing me it takes God's grace to make you and I aware of the condition that we're in in this hour is that right it took God's grace appearing to make you and I aware of the condition that we were in and God's light listen now God's light shining so bright it shows the contrast of where you and I were at as the word of God is being preached it shows the contrast even though in a life that can seem to be so wholesome and good but when God's grace is appearing it shows that there is a true Grace a true goodness that comes alone from almighty God ma can you imagine otherwise standing there on that day you would say Lord you know you really didn't need to come you really didn't need to change you shed your blood you know it's kind of a waste of time for me because I was already good I I was able to live a really good life well by the Samuel he came to shed his blood from him well then why did he why did you need his blood to be shed for you come on now let's dive a little deeper can we a few more moments here notice this Isaiah and not Nehemiah chapter 9 verse 27 I know something to me feel like it's dangerous but let me just let me just dive here just a few moments here notice in Nehemiah chapter 9 verse 27 Nehemiah picks this up and he's talking about how Israel would get back into situations in their lives and he says therefore thou delivers them into the hand of their enemies who vexed them why did God deliver his people into the hands of their enemies because they disobeyed him right they walked contrary to his voice it wasn't God being a mean I'm gonna get you no God God a matter of fact pleaded with them don't go this way but they went anyhow they went anyhow they ignored it and overrode it and over you know eventually once you override something long enough it becomes faint one excuse after another excuse after another excuse after another excuse after another excuses it diminishes the intensity of the first moment of conviction let me just say this this is why the scripture says today is the day of salvation this is the moment for whatever is needed in your life this is the moment that God is inspiring his word to your heart it's the time to act are you hearing me let me come down here and in the time of their trouble when they Cried unto thee thou hurtest them from heaven and according to thy manifold mercies thou gave us them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their enemies now who were some of these saviors well the prophets down through the time then you had also the judges Samuel Samson Gideon right they became savior well how did they become saviors how how did that how did that happen it's because God called them his grace appeared to them I don't have time to go through every one of those examples but God's grace appeared to them like he did to get in and he gets he brings Gideon to where Gideon himself comes to separate himself from all that he's ever known about himself from every fear and complex that's been over his life because my family is the smallest family and on and on and on he brings him to a place to where everything is broken from around his life to where Gideon can fully believe God and when Gideon begins to move in the grace that has appeared to him then Grace begins to sound out of his life and you find that that is a courage that moves into Israel to get behind and move in the grace of almighty God and what does God do God moves to cause the midianites to flee from the country is that right it was the same thing with Samson it's the same thing with with Elijah even when Elijah did that on Mount Carmel that was God's grace coming down upon Mount Carmel and what did it do the prophet told us there were seven thousand when Elijah thought at that moment I'm the only guy you ever felt all alone yeah sure we all have Elijah even in that moment of fulfilling the word of God he felt all alone because afterwards when the mind of Christ had lifted off of him he fled and he went in the cave and remember he told God I am I the only one who is left but God let him know hey I've got seven thousand reserved to me that have not bowed a knee unto Baal well Lord I didn't see them I know you don't but that's why I needed you to stand there and allow my grace to appear because the appearing of my grace upon the altar was apart from all the teachings of Baal from everything they were doing it was me confirming my word my grace and it has given courage to the seven thousand to rise up out of their foxholes and dims and caves it has given them courage to stand for me that's what the grace of God has done in this hour right what sent T.L Osborne to brother branham's address and asked him and said brother random he said what do I have to do he said in order he said when I'm praying he said in this to take place he said in this way he said you think God's called me he said to a Ministry a praying and brother bran said well brother he said if you're called to preach the gospel you're called to pray for the sick and remember brother did the T Osborne show I'm just going to go home and nail myself up in a closet you know now remember brother T Osborne had never seen these types of things before remember I don't know if you've ever seen it on YouTube where T.L Osborne gets up and he said we as Pentecostals were used to The Stomping and the and the everything he said and brother Brown stood right there and just said come out of him he said we were waiting somebody's got to be shook something's got to happen right but he said no what you say what was that it was the grace of God that appeared listen to me when you are set free it is not God overpowering it is God speaking to you to let you know your rights and that's why I say to you right here this morning when you can receive the grace of God appearing to you for your need you can say sickness you're under my feet habits you're under my feet be setting sin you're under my feet I need the Holy Ghost so discouragement and complex you're under my feet what was that it's God's grace [Applause] that comes to you and I to cause us to believe [Applause] he sent saviors to save him out of the hand of their enemies now let me ask you a question if this this this said he was a savior what if when he came to Gideon they're still in the hand of the midianites what if Gideon walked up to him and said I'll tell you what y'all boys need to do y'all just need to act like you're not in bondage you need to be nice to these midianites you know what you'd say what you should say that ain't a savior because a savior is a deliverer you know what that's what you'd say you'd say that's a man that's trying to pump me up prep me up and everything else that ain't what God comes to do he comes to bring you from the whole of your enemies one of these days remember receiving the end of our Salvation one of these days oh wretched man than I am who shall deliver me The Wretched Man that I look at every day in the mirror The Wretched Man that I look at but who shall deliver me God's Saving Grace sweeping over and there'll be a change come over us oh blessed be the name of the Lord notice the scripture says and he shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Matthew 1 21. Jesus for he shall save his people from there sins [Music] now he's done this is careful he didn't say he would save him in their sins save them from their sins for he shall save his people already were his people before the foundation of the world just like when God went down he never came down and said I wonder what nation there's got some people in it that want to go free no is Egypt had Israel in bondage and God said I got a promise in my word and I'm coming to fulfill that promise and when Grace appeared it led them forth from their task Masters Satan got to sitting around a little bit Pharaoh did and said man who in the world's going to do all this work now good Lord we know the Egyptian sure ain't gonna do it they're just sitting at home and waiting on something to come I wonder what's going to happen here if they were looking around finally you know what it is God said I'm going to get me Glory upon him the taskmasters they were still alive and that spirit of fear said I'm gonna get him that Spirit anxiety said I'm going to get them that Spirit Allah said I'm going to get them come on now he said I'm going to take after him what was it but you see God was alluring Satan because he had overtaken them and had them in bondage before but God was alluring them to a place where he was going to execute judgment thank you brother and sister let me tell you if you hear the hounds of Hell behind you don't turn around and look at them stand still and see the salvation of our God the devil tells you I'm gonna take you back over he's a liar you stand your ground [Music] but there's something in my way he's a Waymaker the same Grace that appeared to raise up a prophet against his own will the same Grace that provided a pillar of fire the same Grace that has come down and called you out that same Grace will take you all the way stand still and see the salvation of our God Hallelujah let's stand I want to keep preaching you know that sometimes I wish we had a night service don't get nervous but I know I know God knows what we need and that's what I ask him for but let me just as they stood there to Red Sea I want you to notice this I want you to listen carefully because this speaks to you and I Moses stood there and he told the people fear not for the Egyptians you see today you'll see him no more when Moses turned to speak to God or Moses why cry unto me you speak that the people go forward and when brother Brown preaches that message in 63 in July very very very key place he says see it shows the humanness and the human instrumentality one moment prophesying you see prophecy was not Moses working up like glory to God this is known it spoke out of him spoke out of him fear not the Egyptians that you see you shall see no more but when he turns around God recognizes why are you crying unto me he could pick that up within Moses and what was God reminding him God reminded him of his Commission let me tell you something there might be things traps and other things that have tried to come along the way but I want to remind you you have been commissioned and remember that the God who called you The God Who Sanctified you the God who has failed you listen even you might be back here under justification but remember The God Who justifies you the God who calls your heart to turn to him is the same God that will take you on every step of the way what do I do stand still and see the salvation of our God that don't mean keep moving it means Look to Him and trust in him who will not leave you he had brought you this far he'll take you safely home he's The God Who made the promise he's The God Who fulfills his promise [Applause] Moses he held up that Rod you know what that Rod represented the deity of Jesus Christ praise God praise God it represented the name of Jesus Christ given to the Church of the Living God let me tell you there's not a situation or a problem That's too great for the name of Jesus Christ you got to be setting sin in your life hold the name of Jesus Christ over it Hallelujah you got a problem in your life if fear wanting to come back a complex maybe that's built around your life then nobody loves me and I think so-and-so is half mirror or brother Samuel is always preaching on me I see it when he looks at me take the name of Jesus Christ and hold it over that thing and say you ain't going to take my Liberty you ain't gonna take my joy you ain't gonna stand here and try to bring torment to me because torment ain't in the house of God it's a lying spirit there's joy in the house of the Lord there's freedom in the house of God there's liberty if there ever was a place to receive Liberty it's in the house of God that when you walk out of here this house of God walks out with Liberty and he held that name right there but Joshua he didn't take it down he held it amen and in East Wind you know an East Wind was it's a resurrection wind the same wind that blew in on the day of Pentecost he started partner now I I I don't know if it happened just like it did on Ten Commandments as far as all at one I don't know that but what I do know is what the Bible tells us is that they walked on dry ground but Simon what are you saying I'm telling you that every place that God opens for you you rebuke that line spirit that says you're going to sink you're walking on Solid Ground the grace of God reveals that well I'm afraid I might not be able to do it I'm afraid if I'm baptized I may not be able to live right I'm afraid if if I confess that the Holy Ghost is mine that the enemy is just going to gonna just take right after me God has given you Solid Ground amen to walk on and say it's mine it's mine Liberty is mine Freedom From Fear is mine I don't have to live in anxiety I can live in Freedom I don't have to live under a tormenting spirit amen are you hearing me now listen to him now you don't have to live that way but you can put your foot on dry ground as he's opening the way walk in it that's Grace that's Grace and let me just tell you throw down every thought that wants to rise and remind you of all of your failures your previous fears trepidations throw it down it's Satan's tactic to try to hinder you from receiving God's grace I'll tell you right here this morning there's Grace there's Grace for healing there's Grace for deliverance there's Grace for the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's Grace this morning you know I haven't brought this presence that's him amen that's him you haven't worked yourself up it's him it's responding to his presence amen that's the same way that man was in the pool when it was stirred step in it that's God's grace when the man could not get there to that pool he said I have tried how many years I've tried I've tried I wonder if he just had finally given up hope he looked at his condition he looked at it how am I going to ever get there before anybody else my condition but Grace appeared and asked him will thou be made home notice what do you will what is your will say well brother Samuel I can't will nothing but remember nevertheless not my will Vine will be done so Lord my
