i surrender to the king singing one more time let the worshipers arise yes sir what a beautiful psalm and i just can't help but those verses that were being sung in there and i know that those verses were some inspiration that struck there for those verses to be wrote i think it was one of the brothers here i'm not sure maybe it was brother brian that just inspiration instruct that i'm not sure but i know those verses are not part of that song they were in the past but it's it's it's the absolute truth we certainly have a real song of victory and you know when we look all through the promises of god's word that's what we're to see is nothing but victory because the reality is is that we're not standing in our own victory we are standing in his victory and so we just thank the lord for his mercy this morning as we prepare to turn our hearts to the word i first just want to mention once again to all of the brothers and sisters the lord willing this coming thursday we will start resuming a meeting here once again on on thursday and we you have the email as well as a lot of the the details that are within it if there are any questions on tuesday evening i want to be able to address if there's any questions or any concerns you can email me or or text me and i can do it then the other part as things arise you know obviously it's it's much easier you could probably get in contact even a lot quicker at times with the deacons they're right there and available and i so appreciate brother gomez and brother richard um just working right there close together um so we want to just be mindful of that we i had just received even an email here on friday that we had received myself and the deacons where the health department itself they were very uh commending of the plan that we had set forth and so we're just trying to even though we didn't have to do that we're just trying to do what would be um necessary in order to try to ease a lot of things in order to come back together so just please stay in in touch as far as on tuesday night if you have any questions we'll be sure to address them i'm also going to be having a a meeting with those of musicians and things like that you'll be receiving be looking in your email because i'm going to have a meeting with you probably over zoom and um we will have a little meeting so because i know there's probably some questions about some of the those that musicians and different ones that will be here uh there at those times so i want to just i'll cover with you separately and we'll look probably to do that maybe tomorrow night and that's just for uh musicians and things like that if you get an email then then you'll be on it for tomorrow night but lord willing we'll be able to resume services here on thursday just make sure you follow the alphabet a through k on this thursday and sunday and then l through z uh the next thursday and sunday and then you continue to be in prayer and how that the lord will direct us and provide for us in that so um i want to just say reiterate as as brother paul had mentioned there uh happy mother's day and certainly uh i'm just grateful to have my mother uh here with me and um i just really am just so thankful to the lord for that and also really appreciate my wife and for each and every mother that is that is out there and we certainly love and appreciate you what a great responsibility that you have i remember the prophet would let us know clearly you're the fifth gospel and so what a what a great responsibility it is what a great thing it is and i think for each and every one of the children and different ones um what a blessing it is to have have a real mother to have a godly mother it's just such a real blessing and so we want to remember with that um i want you to remember i think of today i was sitting in the office there and just thinking also we want to remember brother bill's brother bill and and the children there i think that this is the first mother's day uh without uh sister mary and sister mary was such a wonderful such a wonderful mother so we want to remember them in prayer that god will just strengthen them in this in this day as well because they certainly got a lot of good memories amen and that just that's one thing that i i think god gives us that vault of memory we can unlock and think about all that care and so i also want to remember brother richard had mentioned to me here with jamie um that we would keep her in prayer that would that's liliana's mother this is a very obviously would be a very difficult day for her and as he expressed she's a wonderful mother and that the lord would bless her so we want to just just have as we've approached the throne of god right now as we're getting ready to look into the word and you have a need on your heart you just hold that before the throne of god and we're just going to go in prayer and ask his leadership now in the word heavenly father as we lord are just so thankful oh god in this this morning as we stand here lord we are just lord in our hearts just lord grateful for your mercy and your grace and lord to know that we are we are recipients of it that it's not just lord what was done on calvary but that has been made real to us [Music] not only what it was all about but that we were included and father we've received that earnest we've received that of the spoil oh god we've received that lord god of your own life oh god you have given us life and we love you lord this morning we just ask god as we just turn our attention to the things to your word we read thank you for every mother we thank you lord for the sisters lord throughout this assembly dear god i just ask that you'll just bless them especially once again today your god we pray for lord the sanchez family oh god for brother bill's children lord him oh god i ask that you would be with them and comfort them lord in this moment lord and i asked god as well that for jamie that you would just continue to deal with her heart and that you would comfort her lord it's it's no doubt about it lord it would be a hard time a hard day but we ask that god that you would come and that you would just lord move lord on their behalf lord we pray lord as we look into your word father we can take our hands and we can open the bible but lord we're asking that you the author that you would come that you would open your word to our hearts lord our our desire and where our our commitment is lord is our hearts to be open to receive your word may you help us as speaker and here together for every need upon the hearts of your children lord as we just committed lord to you in prayer right now just now take control lord in the further part of the service for your glory in jesus name amen god bless you i'm just going to read one scripture and i'd like to go into that scripture once again uh ephesians 6 and verse 17 as we're looking at the armor of god and just verse 17 is where i want to just read that and then we'll let you have your seats and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god amen may god bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated when we we look at this here in the scriptures we have been for a few services now and just how the holy spirit has just been taken the direction within it um one thing that we just my attention and my heart was just drawn to the lord is because when we when we speak when the scripture says take unto you and it's it is that which is already in our possession when we have received the holy spirit the word of god is wrapped up in our lives but one thing that is certain and i believe that we can all agree on this is that everything that we have need of has already been provided and the and and and the prophet would help us to be able to realize that it's not something out here but he would help us to look deep you see the word when the word comes in season and in time it causes us to look within and that looking within is never to stop uh in our lives but it it causes us to uh to to look within in our lives and and really to be able to uh seeing even of who we are and as we're looking at this of the word it's things that as we're seeing of that the word itself is is a word that truly we we don't want the sword of the word of the spirit to be in the sheath it's to be out of the sheath and that's exactly what the holy spirit is making known that this is where the word of god is to be uh active in our lives and so when paul would write because there are promises that belong to us and it's up to us to to take those promises and i was saying moments ago when we look within our lives we recognize that everything that we have need of him brother branham would say it like this he said even that of the rapture is in you already so it's dealing with his working within our lives it's recognizing the power that already lays within us and remember with the looking at that of the sword that being that of the word of god that it takes as we've been looking at this a strong hand of faith to hold that sword and notice a strong hand of faith to hold the sword so it requires a courage and we look at it in the scripture here in in the book of galatians chapter 5 and verse 6 and it expresses to us that faith worketh by love and you know as we were looking at at these things even of last week and how the holy spirit just quickening those those parts to our life that we understand that there can be a person can have faith to move mountains and i want you to remember this even where the lord jesus talked about there would be those who would come before him on that day and say lord didn't i cast out devils in your name didn't we speak with other tongues so forth and goes on now all of that it's by faith but yet we recognize that there is a difference in just a person having faith and then a person having faith that is operated by the love of god which the love of god is the promise of god the life of god that is released to us as a believer so in other words i'm talking about a relationship here because faith itself is produced by love and we're talking about promises that pertain to us as believers in this hour um god did not even from the very beginning of even where we set or or would stand in the grace of god this morning it is because promises have been ministered to us and the spirit of god has caused us to rise in faith to receive and accept that promise that belongs to us and it is the same way with every promise that is still laid out before us that includes the promise of the rapture the promise of the rapture is that which will indeed be taken by the love of god so pulsating in our hearts in our lives it brings about a faith to where it it it it comes into this place to where if he was going to take only one out of the city that we live in no offense but that's going to be me if that's going to be me if he's coming for somebody it's going to be me now these are not just good words this is something that's personal to us this is not something that's outside of us we've got a basis for that stand in our lives and that basis is the love of god that is in our hearts then that love love faith remember faith itself without any works without any works then faith is dead but you see the works must be connected with the faith that is given by god in this hour because you can find many people or individuals within religion or within another place they have faith and they'll have a lot of good works but we're not talking about good works thank god for good works i appreciate good people i mean i appreciate people that you know you work with them or come in contact or you know i appreciate people who've got clean mouths i appreciate and i'm not talking about food particles i'm talking about where they're not talking foul i i appreciate those things i appreciate where you can talk with somebody they come to service something in your house or we appreciate all that but we're talking about works that are not man-made works we're talking about works that are the works of god that are holy works because of a holy faith we're talking about works of the outworking of his life working and moving through us like abraham the works of abraham was only the outworking of what god's thoughts were concerning the promise the promise was given now it was time for that word to be reflected through abraham's life so it was god the holy faith of god revealed to in and through abraham and it came manifest in works and jesus remember when he said i must work the works of him while it's dead he said that even for our lives that uh the works that i do shall you do also so it is him in us fulfilling his own word so then if it's him in us fulfilling his own word remember he won't override our will so it is our will being surrendered to him so how is our will surrendered to him he he comes and he moves in our life by divine love and love brings submission and surrender it brings confidence it brings rest and so when we would think of this here i want to go uh right back into this here with esther and just resume here just for a few moments in picking this up where we left off and i want i want you as a congregation to be very uh to be very um focused on here here is esther she's already been anointed queen she has the crown upon her head how long of a time was it from where she's anointed to where now the conspiracy of haman comes about to destroy i don't know how many years that was i don't know how much time but i'm just going to say it in this manner there was a time that esther was just she was enjoying the delights of being queen was it really really real within the sense of where of what she was purposed for i'm certain that esther just could not even at that moment when the crown was set on her head she could not even fully be able to comprehend what has happened would you think of this here is a little girl she's been raised by her uncle she is you know she doesn't even have she wasn't brought here by her father she wasn't brought her by her mother she's been raised by her uncle so now where she comes to a place and to think of all the rest of the because remember all the fair young virgins came in there they were not all jews she was the jew she's the one where the scripture notice out of all of it it says fair young virgins but the scripture highlights and it's as though the light singles out like a person on stage and the rest are part of the background but the light and the focus is upon esther let me just say this to you there are many many others that have been that are fair young virgins and remember the king if he he did not send them back out into the world or the provinces they went to the house of the concubines there's been many fair virgins but i'm telling you the spotlight down through the ages this is where the elective grace of god comes in the spotlight spotlight meaning that of the word remember his word is light and his word has come to lighten as he revealed himself to paul he said that his word that was given to paul that it would remove the darkness and the power of satan from the gentiles and that we would be illuminated with the light of almighty god what light are we talking about we're talking about the light which is the image of god the same image that they fell from in the garden of eden now in christ that same spirit image that same uh living word that same life of god is now imparted into the life of a believer so the rest as i was saying remember when a light is cast on stage you can the light itself there'll be other parts you can see but those are not the focal point thank god for salvation where many have been able to come and are john 3 16 christians are you with me thank god for that but you see the light itself remember the scripture says concerning the outpouring of the holy ghost that he would pour out his spirit upon all flesh and then it goes on to say and on that handmaidens and thy servants you see the light come it come directly for that of the elect it come to give life to that of the elect but and you think of it here we are like esther walking in the light what have we done to receive this nothing when you really look at it clearly and you see it how god has laid it out in the scripture i just want to pause on this for a moment when you see how clearly it is in the scripture jacob and esau esau was a much better man he was a much better man if you were going to choose a man to be a part of your assembly or your church or work alongside you on the on the line you would have picked esau but when god see only thing that could take place with jacob is when god comes and changes jacob brother it supersedes the fine morality of esau thank god for fine morality thank god for for for that fineness but this is where you see god has so placed it in a way to where you and i can look at those examples and listen in looking at those examples the word of god is to be a mirror that we are to look into and to recognize if not for god's grace that you and i would have not been chosen if the choosing was a man but god saw what was beneath and packed into the dirt and the light shining on the waters the water's thickness of multitudes of people the water the light shining on the water you and i were beneath the water but what happened the light come and it draws us up through all the thickness and multitudes and mixture and muck it gives us strength the light ministers to a strength to overcome all the mud that's packed into us and i don't care who you are where you've come from who your family is or whatever more let's just be honest with you there was a lot of there was a lot of browning brown and everything else kind of dirt that was packed into me and browning dirt ain't better than sanchez dirt and sanchez dirt ain't better than than gomez dirt we're all dirt come on friends god never come to highlight a family he came to identify his family that was already here this is why the scripture would speak to us and let me just let me read one verse of scripture here from esther in esther 5 1. now here's after the the uh the praying and the fasting where they've been praying and fasting i i i i like this approach when i say i like this approach it just identifies within my heart look at this esther herself when she when this comes the word is declared to her from mordecai she responds to it she acts upon she's acting upon it but notice she approaches it with prayer and fasting what is she doing she's making sure there's nothing that would hinder that word from coming to pass hallelujah and here she comes in verse one it says it come to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and she stood in the inner court of the king's house over against the king's house and the king set upon his roman troil in the royal house over against the gate of the house now she's not coming before the king in in her garments of mourning she has been granted given the royal apparel she didn't earn it she was granted that royal apparel she had to receive it so when she would stand in the king's court she is clothed with what the king has issued and what he has issued would declare already what and her position of who she is that apparel matches her crown you see he's provided oh my he's provided what is needed for you and i to be able to come and stand in his presence his blood has made a way amen in the spirit of god beckons to our heart calls to our life it moves upon our hearts with promise for promises to be taken think of this think of it now esther has been has been here in the palace of shushan how long well it certainly wasn't a month she's been here she's been feeding on the message her sword has really not had to come out except for cutting steak and putting putting butter on dinner rolls come on now but there but but the whole part is now for a time this time for such a time as this here's why you're here esther this is the appointment you see it brings to you and i the reality of this message that god has sent to us our part our purpose within it this is why that many times where the sincerity is lacked of why that that that we're not moving upon promises the way we ought to is because the question still arises in our minds is it really me is he really talking about me does he mean me these are things and this was this was something the spirit of god identifies where the prophet calls it out and he told us he said i'm going to speak on those things he he identifies in the message of prisoner and he said that right there i'm going to start speaking on that and he does he deals and addresses with how can i overcome perfect faith christ is the mystery it's dealing with these principles and this ground that we're to stand on hallelujah you see esther they think of this the scripture if i can just refer to it a place in the book of corinthians paul reminds those in corinth of how and he talks about the the weakness of god is stronger than man he talks about base things that god has chosen weak things to confound the wise he said you see how many not many wise are called but it's those that that that god calls that that they know they're nothing and god has to even work on us who knows we're nothing to keep us in that place amen he has to can he has to deal with our hearts within these things think of this this is why the scripture we understand it is always within uh the direction and the admonition of the holy spirit that we would stay humble this isn't you and me calling ourselves humble but a humbleness of mind means a long opinion of oneself it doesn't mean degrading self it means not putting self up here hallelujah it's putting off she here is esther she's got she's standing now with the courage now she's come to a place think of it think of this now many others could come to that door to come into the court but the guards would have forbid him the guards would have looked at him and said uh you can't come in here and yet to not be summoned by the king is death but you see this is a time for the for the queen to make her entrance they do not withhold esther from going in but now after she goes in but she goes in clothes with that royal apparel oh brother she's got substance of his unmerited favor unmerited favor and when the king look at verse 2 and when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight she already have favor but notice think of this now of where the queen the king himself was standing there and he's wanting the queen to come into this position he'd been wanting her to come into this position and he sees her standing in his court oh what he must do to the heart of the lord jesus when the message that he has sent has so moved the pride and courage to where the bride comes into the courts of the king it is where she comes here not because she's worthy she comes here because the blood has gone before her a man and she has the token that is going there to make that petition to make that request it is a divine assurance and the king the bible said held out to esther the golden scepter that was in his hand esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter then the king said to her what will thou queen esther and one is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom i just can't help but think about here she is standing here and the courage that has moved within her heart by the word our faith let me just touch on this just a moment our faith is to grow and our faith does grow it even grows within every uh every promise that is given and this of the word of how that god would come through his word it is just like how that he approached john on the isle of patmos when john was there and here beholding his glory and the angel of the lord they're present and revealing and moving there there with john and notice the bible talks about how that when he came and he and john sees him and he falls at his feet as dead but the bible said he put his right hand upon john and he said fear not the right hand is power and authority he's letting john know this revelation of jesus christ it is to let us know there is nothing to fear i have bore your judgment i have bore the wound of sin i have absorbed the full amount of it and there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus i your judge had become your attorney what's he doing he's ministering to john love courage and ability let me just tell you this right now before john can go on to receive the furtherance and the unfolding of his coming and all the way down through he first has got to believe and to recognize that indeed he is the resurrected christ the victorious one and he has to be able to receive it you can't receive anything unless you're made ready to receive it and so god himself the right hand of god the power of god it moves down upon john the authority oh my it takes a hold on john i'm glad that his word it lays in authority it'll arrest every thought it'll give strength to you and i you can look at yourself and say i'm not worthy and the devil can point out every one of your mistakes and every one of your failures what must happen the right hand of god comes brother and you've got authority to rest in his touch and he ministers listen notice he touched me and he ministered fear not hallelujah he come to minister love courage and ability brother brown would say it like this he says what he was telling john i've not come to bring fear and failure that is not what the right hand of god comes to do the right hand of god comes to release fears hold upon a life remember to minister love courage and ability it's the same way that when daniel was praying and i don't have have time but you know over and over you find from daniel 9 to daniel 10 of when there are times here that daniel the bible says in daniel 9 the first three verses when daniel begin to understand by the books brother that's the hour that you and i are living in god has caused us to understand he has sent that of the prophet right here among us the same spirit of god that came that sent the prophet notice he come to identify this is the time this is the hour that's what mordecai was doing for esther he was letting her know get your sword out of your sheath come on somebody take your sword out it ain't decoration it's to be used it's the only part of our armor that is offensive hallelujah he's encouraging her to take it out and when he would come to daniel even right there in daniel remember even as he starts to speak to daniel over and over gabriel would tell him oh daniel greatly be loved of the lord i'm coming he'll say in a different in another place he says in daniel 10 he says i'm come now that you might receive skill and understanding and that you might receive even these things that would come forth even in the latter times concerning your people and come that you might receive this understanding daniel thou art greatly beloved of the lord let me just say this to you you want to know if he loves you he has revealed himself to you he deals with our hearts he deals with our lives i know that there are there are times where the devil he will take somebody's life maybe they've been around this message they've been in church they've been in places and then he gets them and he so traps them into decisions that they have made in their life and he wants to take those decisions and he wants to try to take that and put the person's head in the sand and say there is no way that could be talking about you but what you need to look at is the word that is calling to you it is the love of god it is not calling to all of the darkness all of the failures he's calling to the real person on the inside that's hidden beneath that old nature the devil allures traps the people into doing those things you know on all sorts of life that's been lived see this is why i'm talking about the touch of almighty god there's many can set in a meeting and don't feel nothing we're living in that day right now where people can come and sit in a meeting and they're not even touched why because the spirit of god is lifting from the earth the door of mercy is about closed and it shows the hardness of sin that can so separate a life and how many times when i you know talk with people different ones you know and you come to find out well i don't know how god could even love me and i don't know you know i've done this and i've done that and everything else and there's been years of things to where the devil will point out all of that but i'm telling you all it takes is a moment of surrender to the hand that is touching you you wonder what's that first two believe thou art greatly beloved of god to act upon his promise you've got to believe i'm greatly beloved of the lord this is why look here comes mary here comes mary to the well right the angel of the lord knew her pathway he knew her daily routine get up drink coffee at 7 30 in the morning then go he knew her routine and he met her right there in her daily routine listen when he spoke to her hail mary thou art highly favored of the lord she hadn't done one thing yet she hadn't even heard the message yet but that's the first words of the message thou art highly favored blessed art thou among women she had not even received the life in her womb she was already blessed why when does our blessing start our blessing it comes from that in god blessed we have been blessed with all spiritual blessings in christ jesus the blessing is not something that just starts in time or is temporal it is that which is released from the eternal and comes down upon our lives what are you saying i'm telling you esther it's not by chance that you're here [Applause] to recognize this is not something you climbed up into this is what you have been ordained to and the spirit of god has called you amen this is the kind uh to be able to stand in this measure to recognize with this perfect love pulsating in our heart we've got boldness to stand in judgment confidence because we've already passed under and through the judgment of our lord and savior jesus christ the witness of the holy ghost makes it real in our hearts and we have this because as he is so are we in this world we love him because he first loved us these things that i that that we are are mentioning here uh even of this morning this is what brings a strong hand to faith it doesn't matter how much of the word that we know we've got to believe it and believe that it is for us and to believe that god has qualified us to take that word and to move and act upon it this is where i look at the scripture and i read you one of these last week but in songs song of solomon 2 14 look at how solomon speaks to that of the bride watch how he speaks to her oh my dove he calls her that three times in this in this in this uh book oh my dove thou art in the claps of the rock she's hidden who is she my dog he sees the reflection of his life in her what is that his victory in the sacred places of the stairs she's got access where a king inside of his palace a king had ways to escape that nobody else knew about they were secret passages she is standing in these passages she is here in a place of access he has given to us access ask the father anything and my name and i will do it and the bible is very clear as it moves within it let me see thy countenance let me see your face let me behold it let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely and notice he he he speaks of this again in in song of solomon six verse nine my dove once again my undefiled is but one she is the only one of her mother she is the choice one of her that bear her the daughter saw her and blessed her yea the queens and the concubines they praised her who is she my delf the undefiled one oh god this is seeing ourselves as god sees us who is she that looketh forth as the morning a new day fair is the moon she's not a dark moon she's not a quarter moon it's a full moon it's fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners this is the reflection of his life in her it's the reflection of his life in us see this is why this is why we have to rely upon what god has made us jesus relied upon the word said he was that's how he fought he fought because he relied on what the word said he was this is why the scripture said if our hearts condemn us then we can't have faith you see if you know you're doing things wrong automatically you put yourself out as a sinner you see automatically there's condemnation amen esther had to be able to put on the royal apparel let me just say this to you this is where a time even is that for lives who have not been quickened with the holy ghost it's a time to recognize that listen if our heart condemn us we can't have confidence i don't care if you look back and you know you're doing things wrong and you know that you still love the world those those things that you say i can't get rid of this habit let me tell you something there is power in the blood of the lamb this message never revealed to us a weak christ it's revealed a victorious christ brother that's what's been revealed hallelujah that's who took the seals off of himself is the mighty conqueror he conquered the seen world and the unseen world and for those lives i'm talking to esther even those lives where god has fully placed the crown upon your head you know that the work you know that the love of the world is no longer there in your life you know that he has become alive within your heart and the love of god is shed abroad in your heart but yet it brings us to an evaluation esther had an evaluation she just didn't haphazardly just take on you know the royal apparel and throw it on and say well yeah i've got the royal apparel she got before god and examined her life let me preach a little bit matthew 6 is where the angel of the lord spoke to the prophet when he came to talk to him about the third pull which would be the opening of the word the placing of that word into a bride body and when he came to that and said i'll meet you in there remember the people walked in with all sorts of conditions but whatever condition they went in some were on cots some were on stretchers some had you know uh uh the the uh crutches these were all things visible that we could see visible healing but it was talking about something much deeper than visible healing he was talking about spiritual healing that's the real healing revival because if a person gets healed in their body they can get sick again but when that soul has ever received the cure from sin disease brother that soul can never ever be sin sick no more that's the manifestation of the son of righteousness rising with healing in his wings and it culminates in the catching away that culminates his rising it culminates in a catching away but it brings you and i to an evaluation and this is where it really causes us as a people to evaluate are there things that we're allowing to be hindering in our life let me just say some some things to how the devil wants to look the bible says tear down every stronghold it also says give no place to satan come on paul wasn't writing that to unbelievers paul wasn't writing that to make believers that was to the ephesian age that was to the ephesian believers that was their letter don't give no place that means quarter room castle retreat what are you saying don't give no excuse you see in order for the word to operate i'm talking about to this point it causes evaluation where even indifference has got to be cast out grudge has got to be cast out but just to remember as we looked at this some thursdays ago this part is sticking but we ain't making no excuses for it that means when it's sticky we've got to have a power on the inside to get to get it unstuck there's things we have to search deep within our lives and i'm not talking about like going through mystery i'm talking about to where we recognize that there are certain things when it comes down to promises that you recognize holding on to certain things certain feelings and hurts and everything else you begin to realize what is it that causes you to recognize those things are no longer worth it the love of god that has to be the love of god that causes you to recognize this means nothing brother let me tell you god ain't going to strip him out of us that's where we've got to take our that initiative before we can put on that royal apparel and begin to go in you're taking promises it's holding that sword in your hand it's got to be clear if your conscience is not clear get it clear is that right brother branham's standing there in the message i think it's life is the healer one of those messages were healings in the title that i'm listening to and brother branson said now you come to the end of it he said now here's what i want you to do he's talking about how that that god it cannot override you've got to have love in your heart he said now look he said right now let everything be settled look how simple this is he said let it be settled he said maybe you say brother branham i've been a little skeptical of you he said but right now you just say brother branham i love you father forgive me he said let god ride right in now it isn't about oh that's that simple it's that simple to release a burden it's that simple satan's job is to try to conglomerate because if he can conglomerate the sword stays in the sheath but where to take the sword against him now let me just kind of move here over this esther invites the king and she wants haman to come with him she wants him who's the problem come with the king i want you i want you all to come she has a banquet and they come now when she comes to that remember that banquet esther herself comes and i want you to notice the approach that she makes with the king she invites that he and haman would come again right now look what's happening haman has come here and haman's like boy this plot i've got it sewed up he don't know he ain't sewed up he's being set up you see he see haman starts getting a false confidence i love it when the devil starts getting the false confidence at about that time he's in for it he had him against the red sea false confidence amen and that double devil he's stealing never learned his lesson if he fakes the devil glories and if he can get somebody pinned in to a corner that i've got him i've got him hemmed in that's exactly what he wants to do he already knows it but i go and say it you're set up this message has come to unfold the word it's god unfolding the promise to set you up what glory be to god notice our esther she says in verse 3 of esther 7. i want you to watch this approach esther says if i have found favor look how she comes to the king humility if i have found favor in thy sight o king and if it please the king notice in thy sight the king sees what nobody else sees his sight sees to our heart if our hearts condemn us his sight sees o king if it please the king notice this is about the king let my life be given at my petition and my people at my request for we are sown i my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for bond men and bond women i had held my tongue although the enemy could not counteravail the king's damage then king of hezrus answered and said unto esther the queen who is he i want you to call him out esther i want you to name that devil [Applause] i want you to speak the word i want you to call his name out like brother eddie biscuit he talked about that man how many times we've heard that testimony brother eddie said that's the first time the biblical said he said that he said i learned that lesson on calling out a devil he wasn't brother brandon called that devil out but what happened is his life that man made a confession i'm free when the devil is uncovered brother he has no place to hide that's what real confession does and that's why the devil gets nervous in meetings that's why he gets nervous that's why the prophet said standing right here he said when the spirit of god begins to discern those things he said that's why you see changes come over people's countenance he said because he knows his scheme is about to be revealed to the person think about this the truth comes to reveal the lie and when the truth comes and the truth uncovers the enemy ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free i don't know how many young people last year byc working with them right up there devil possessed and working with them to get them to a place and that devil them devils are standing right there talking and right over top of it and getting them to a place to name that devil and you start praying and all of a sudden the spirit of god begins to move within that right there brother satan can't hold when hearts begin to unite with that word who is he where is he at where is he at that there's that that dirt's presumed in his heart to do so notice what the word is doing it's revealing i can't help but think of god of this evil age and the prophet just stands there and said now he said how lucifer's heart about this it reveals his plan the adversary and the enemy is this wicked haman you've got to name the troublemaker come on now you got to name him then notice the bible said haman was afraid before the king and the queen [Applause] the queen has spoken and remember he ain't afraid of my word or us but he is afraid of the one we represent and in the presence of the king the queen has been brought into his presence brother and here in his presence to announce that and to claim that and say this wicked haman not well my daddy had this problem my mama had this problem my granddaddy had to know that wicked haman brothers so and so sister so and so my wife my husband no that wicked haman she's in the presence of the king this is why you've heard these statements that brother branham he will make this is why the devil is howling that's why he's howling the way he is you know what his howling is it's the yoking up of the ecclesiastical realm that's his howl his how is bringing his ecclesiastical realm together but the bride has been brought together by the shout out we're not brought together by this by satan's how we've been brought together by the shout of the king victory by that of his voice sounding and turning our hearts around that's the reason he's he's howling his scheme has been uncovered think of this statement we've got the we've got the devil's answer not me that liveth listen to this not me that liveth but christ the word living in me it's not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here and here it is we got his answer standing justified in the presence of almighty god we have that witness the blood was shed the life has come amen the life has come in ministering redemption to our life but samuel how do i know that i'm fully redeemed when your sins are demolished you see it you've accepted it your sins are demolished it's separated from you the love of god is what burns in your heart that's satan's answer remember jesus conquered with the weapon of love that's the weapon that we use that weapon of love that of taking that sword of the word that's the answer to the devil's question this is why in the meeting when the spirit of god as he comes and begins to reveal his word and he's revealed to be the same yesterday today and forever that is why the prophet can announce when that is taking place doomed devils are on the run they're doomed why because the resurrected christ is making himself known that he's the same yesterday today and forever haman stood up where's he going he's going to esther making requests for his life because he knew the wrath of the king is upon him you know how it goes on to say that in this of how that even king of hezrus he comes back into the house and when he comes back in he finds haman pleading for his life upon the bed is you would defile her in my house come on now you see nobody nobody is going to touch his queen the devil can get awful close but i want you to remember you're in the presence of the king haman has already been exposed don't let him leave he's halley you know what he's doing he's begging for mercy why just like paul could announce to the gentile church when he wrote to the romans he said the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly we're living in that hour where a bride is standing upon this earth it's not the feet not the thighs it's not that of the torso it's not the neck but brother that of the headship has come to the body like ezekiel's bones that life has come to the body satan is howling he knows he has a short time brother samuel why does it seem like i am fighting battles like i never fought before the devil's howling come on now he's wanting to fall across there on the bed but the king comes in and the king addresses it very swiftly hanging hanging that simple the word of the king hang him two words hang him you see what happened esther had to identify him as long as you keep it hidden haman will stay right there with you amen haman becomes your buddy haman becomes the one you pack around come on i'm talking to everybody now no matter what level where you're at i'm talking to everybody every one of us you've got to expose that haman let me tell you when haman starts rising is when you start thinking that let the bible say let every man take heed thinking he stands lest he fall let every man not think more highly of himself than he ought to think what is that amen oh glory i'm talking about hindrances haman was hanged on the gallows let me just have a few moments here and i'll just bring this to a close here esther after heyman is hanged she comes to address the king again i want you this is what i want you to catch once she's went in and stood with the royal apparel on she keeps coming she keeps coming faith is growing she keeps coming she keeps requesting promise after promise after promise after promise what's happening her faith is increasing but how is her faith increasing love love is increasing she listen to me now she has already received the unmerited favor of the king he has already expressed his love to her let me just say it like this you've already been sealed with the love of god shed abroad in our hearts but for our faith to grow our love must grow as well and how what is it that our love is growing that our faith and our love would abound toward not only those within but those without come on i'm talking bible now amen you've got to if you can't love those that you see how can you love him and you haven't seen i'm talking about using the sword talking about taking promises amen we're talking about the holy works brought about by holy faith so here's esther standing again and remember esther her faith has grown into a place she listen to me now i want you to catch this what she is standing with the royal apparel on when that royal peril went on the message was calling her to live beyond herself for so many years the message has just been about her but now it calls her to live beyond herself to recognize that eternal life in your bosom is not about you it's for this calvary to be expressed through you so here she comes with the royal au pair you look from that moment on esther chapter 5 revelations chapter five come on somebody what is she doing no longer living for herself she's living even to where now sure she is making another request another request ah the king my people are still under the threat even though haman has been has been delivered but my people are not prepared against the day of judgment what is esther doing she's making a call of mercy get prepared judgment is coming she has been given there mordeca is given there the king's ring with the seal to write letters for what so the jews can arm themselves and prepare against judgment that's what the ministry through the pride of jesus christ is a ministry prepare for judgment hallelujah you're anointed to stand in this hour for a people that have looked for the promise of the rapture brother it has been announced this is an hour we're not announcing it's an hour to say we have arrived this is the time not for making promises is the time for fulfilling it rahab rahab what was rahab doing when she received that word now go get your family see the love pulsating in the heart you see what's giving her courage the love of god is so overwhelming her life this is where the love of god being so shed abroad in our hearts brother when the love of god is just so shed abroad in our hearts and remember the bible says in the book of jude keep yourselves in the love of god it shows we can get dry we can get dry we can get complacent the prophet would say like this when you fall out of love when you separate from divine love you can no longer overlook your brother's mistakes this is why the love of god dwelling in the love of god this is where esther is at brother the sword is out it's promises now that are being taken love of god is so pulsating and so moving through her heart she's dashing out there for others this don't have anything to do about her it's about others let me just say to you it's not just about those out here outside it's for those right here as well as brother brown would say let us take that weapon of love that he left us with and dash into sickness let us dash into where the devil's had holds let us dash into it and it is also for there are also others out there there are also others out there that they need to see the love of god this is why that the holy spirit would speak to us through the message of the prophet and he would let us know he said when you go to talk to that loved one you go to talk to the other one he said apply the token go with love and consideration let me just let me just give a little bit of counsel here as parents and to to parents as parents you've got the dual role you've got you've got you're looking at moses and joshua as a parent we're moses we've got laws we've got restrictions we've got things we set down by the word of god we can't do what joshua does there comes to an end of our point come on now understand what i'm saying where we are at we have to give direction we have to set boundaries we have to say nope this can't be encroached upon this is why we tan hides this is why or how whatever you do that actually gets the point across somehow another it's got to come forth like a rod but however that might be it still comes into a place joshua is the one that has to take them over so applying it with love don't mean like well it's without any restrictions or any hold that's not scriptural that's not scriptural we want to be scriptural jesus said i've not come to do away with the law i come to fulfill it is that right it takes joshua to bring us in it takes joshua to bring our children in but we have a responsibility moses brought him to that place all the lord working it's all god working are you with me this is where as we come into that place it moves us with the sword of the lord these are things of promises and i think how that god has taken it just like in the first parts of this here and it's like he's taken it and kind of moved the move back the curtain and helped us to see this has to be taken by love it comes down first of all that we abide in his love recognizing you're chosen of god you're beloved of the lord what god has done in your life look you come back to that and these are this is the ground that you stand on this is why a person you got ground to stand on when the holy spirit deals with the heart it's ground so that god god will deal with that heart and call them by divine love calls them into surrender and then even coming into a place of complete surrender and how god steps and moves to the inside you realize that's the ground that esther was standing on then the crown you know the seal in your heart and so you stand there with that seal of the living god that's how we're wielding the sword of the lord if there's any anything with condemnation anything at all anything that that in the conscience is troubled cleared out clear it out amen get it under the blood and i'm not just talking about just you know the same old thing if there's things where you look in your life lord i need to be set free i need to be delivered be honest with him call out haman amen call out haman bring it let haman come to where the blood's at hallelujah there's power in the blood amen let's pray father we love you lord this morning oh god we look lord in how we can so identify in our lives even though lord it would not perhaps record or has not said it in that manner in the book of esther but yet we realize the lord even though esther was abiding there in the palace she had the crown that was seated upon her head she already had the royal apparel this no doubt was not the first time that she had had the royal apparel on i would say as the scriptures would portray it it's the first time where this royal apparel is adorned lord she's coming to approach your throne of a situation [Music] lord god that is upon her [Music] upon her people she's moved lord how is she standing here how are we standing here it's by your love love that's been expressed and received into our hearts but how that how is our lives daily lived to be lived to take the promises of god recognizing lord that it's not because of our worthiness the lord jesus you have made us worthy we have been accepted in the beloved lord god is the scriptures would clearly speak to us we have been made the very righteousness of god in christ lord i ask for every everyone every one of us lord may your word be made more real to our hearts [Music] may it be made more real to our hearts may we oh god not try to reason it out because certainly if we lord we try to reason and out we get to looking at our at ourselves we get to looking at everything lord that the enemy would want to try to point out we would never stand the lord jesus we're standing upon your word word that is not outside but the word that has been placed within us [Music] i pray lord this morning may every one lord take courage or whatever their need is this morning maybe it's lord a load of sin that they've been carrying maybe lord in their life those that would stream it lord archive maybe there's things lord that they're just at the point to say lord i'm ready to name this haman to come into your presence to invite the king to come for a banquet of wine perhaps lord is esther standing today saying lord there's things that have allowed to remain and it's hindered the word from being operative or operating from taking promises lord i want the love of god to abound in my life this is our desire lord that your love would abound that our faith would grow lord it's a relationship as husband and wife with you lord i pray lord as we see this with esther lord it didn't fade she didn't fade back out of the picture but esther continued to make requests clear to the very last scriptures where even though haman's sons [Music] were slain with the sword the jews armed themselves with a sword and they slew the enemy lord i think when i look at this how esther's standing in this moment i think of how your prophet would tell us that one person one person in a church on fire for god would do more for that church than multitudes of revivals one person on fire for god lord jesus i believe with all my heart lord god i believe lord as we see that with esther it caused the jews to gather

of calvary i'm glad so glad that i've been born again you think when esther stepped into that court after receiving that letter i want to just say this to you what we read and you come into that latter place it all had a start it all started with esther when it came time for her that she began to take what what hey hey hey guy the king's chamberlain what he was saying brother bill she was laying down her own thoughts she wasn't trying to say well why can't i have this why can't i wear this why can't i do this let me just tell you a little sister it all starts with even the simplicity of saying lord i see what you're speaking to my heart about and you watch how you obey in one little thing you let your heart go in obedience recognize recognizing it's the king's desire you watch what happens it continues to build in your life you watch that you watch as a young man as a middle-aged man old man you watch how even how god will deal with the heart one request that he makes and you say i'm not i want to go in before the queen the king i'm not going to take my own thoughts just take his thoughts it all has to start somewhere it's all got to start what we see where esther stood is all started because she was humbling herself to the king's desire before she ever seen the king face to face his representative was letting her know this is what the king's requirement and this is where esther could stand on that day born again there's really been a change in me oh born again just like jesus said oh thank god i'm born again and all because of calvary thank god thank god
