[0:00] into the bedroom opened up the top of
[0:02] that roll desk and there was his Bible
[0:06] and those open workbooks where he had
[0:08] cross-referenced back and forth
[0:11] tweet so the message it just it opened
[0:14] up a whole new life for him too
[0:16] I just want to thank the Lord and also
[0:18] to the Tuesday night prayer meetings I
[0:20] just can't say how much of a blessing
[0:22] it's been and last Tuesday we came I had
[0:26] such a pain in my left eye before we
[0:28] left the house I thought well maybe I
[0:30] better not go no I'm gonna go it's just
[0:32] a devil so I got here and it was still
[0:35] there
[0:36] all through the prayer meeting things
[0:38] but the prayer meetings are just there
[0:39] so mostly they're just like supernatural
[0:41] it's just such a presence comes in here
[0:43] and so it's a longer a little bit longer
[0:46] so I was out side waiting on the rest of
[0:49] the family to come out and I just felt
[0:51] the unction to walk back in here and say
[0:53] just pray for my eye it was hurting so
[0:56] bad I just wanted to cry and the brother
[0:59] I don't know who all came back in I
[1:00] think some of the young people and other
[1:02] Samuel I don't know came back in but it
[1:05] touched me and when I left here I had no
[1:07] pain in that left eye so I thought Devon
[1:13] will give you this one more black guy so
[1:15] I called my doctor I went to a doctor
[1:17] the next morning and he said I could see
[1:20] something was trying to happen there but
[1:21] it's not there
[1:24] [Applause]
[1:29] please God God still moves doesn't he
[1:34] Amen let's just sing that little course
[1:36] again I wanna that's so much of thanking
[1:38] for look round and see the good things
[1:46] and he does for me well I know I'm
[1:51] unworthy of them all his blessings he
[2:00] freely gives now I owe my life to Him
[2:06] and I've got so much to thank him for
[2:11] help me sing a church
[2:12] well I've got so much they owe so much
[2:19] to praise and for well you see now God
[2:25] has been so good to me then when I think
[2:32] of what he's done and where he brought
[2:39] me from I've got so much the thing for
[2:44] the day Crescent you come at this time
[2:45] listen I want to thank him oh I wanna
[2:48] thank him
[2:49] for letting me see this last day in time
[2:55] mystery now I know then my name is
[3:00] Oliver
[3:03] well the seals they have been
[3:08] revealed someday soon that body changed
[3:12] with bune I've got so much today and for
[3:17] more time I've got so much pain I've got
[3:22] so much bang hope so much brain zoo for
[3:29] well you see he has been so good to me
[3:35] I think Oh
[3:40] [Music]
[3:43] he bro clearly and now I've got so much
[3:51] [Music]
[3:57] may have let you Saints I did have to
[4:00] take a few notes here so don't get
[4:03] nervous just a couple notes oh I don't
[4:05] lose my thought but I just I just want
[4:09] to thank the Lord for there had been a
[4:12] question Satan had been posing to me for
[4:16] years now
[4:19] it basically just said how can the Holy
[4:21] Ghost filled believer you know make such
[4:23] big mistakes how can you be filled with
[4:26] Holy Ghost and still have such faults
[4:29] and failures and things that are
[4:30] lingering on even before you had the
[4:32] Holy Ghost and I didn't really have an
[4:36] answer for that tell you the truth not
[4:38] that I'm prone to feel that I had o
[4:40] Satan and explanation or anything but
[4:44] within myself I just knew I just did not
[4:46] have an answer and it might be rather
[4:49] kind of elementary but um got you're
[4:53] dealt with me during these meetings and
[4:56] show me so testimony me miss sheriff
[4:58] y'all so I I knew I've been filled with
[5:03] the Holy Ghost and brother Sam you've
[5:05] been hit on this morning you know when
[5:06] she crossed your you know God brought
[5:08] the children of Israel there at a
[5:11] certain season when the waters were deep
[5:12] and he parted the waters you know so
[5:16] that's a symbol you know going into the
[5:18] Promised Land you can fill with the Holy
[5:19] Ghost and the only way they that's you
[5:21] know once you're sealed your co2 the day
[5:23] or your Redemption because the only way
[5:25] you're going to get back is a few parts
[5:27] of water and let you back again and
[5:28] that's not happening so I knew I was you
[5:33] don't feel what the Holy Ghost so I just
[5:35] didn't have an answer for for that
[5:38] and then as brother Samuel was saying
[5:41] this morning I Holy Ghost is like a
[5:43] button or or a door to see so when you
[5:47] get it it just goes in you to the
[5:48] texture small and then it starts growing
[5:51] but you still have a lot else that's
[5:54] still hanging on from from your previous
[5:57] birth and you know if that's still prone
[6:00] to faults and failures and so as the
[6:02] seed grows you know the Holy Ghost does
[6:04] give us power for service but we're
[6:08] still living in these bodies with faults
[6:10] and failures and so brother Tim X he
[6:14] started going into this and saying well
[6:16] how can you be you know your sins be
[6:19] gone but yet you still have to die daily
[6:23] basically you know and so it just it
[6:27] just kind of came to me you know like
[6:30] this you know he was saying how is your
[6:31] sins totally taken away and then but
[6:33] then you still have to repent your sins
[6:34] every day and it just kind of came to
[6:38] her you know the Holy Ghost gives up
[6:39] does give us power for service
[6:43] but we're still gonna make mistakes but
[6:47] there's a higher power than our mistakes
[6:49] and that's the blood of Jesus Christ and
[6:53] that's what the blood is for so we have
[6:56] you know the Holy Ghost for service and
[6:58] power and that's going to put us in
[7:01] service but we're still going to make
[7:02] mistakes and then the blood covers what
[7:05] we can't we can't cover it you know just
[7:07] and how a brother 10:1 just saying hey
[7:10] we you know what we walk with Him we
[7:13] make mistakes we die daily we repent of
[7:16] our sins we get up we dust ourselves off
[7:17] and we walk on with Jesus so I guess
[7:20] that that was just huge to me to to see
[7:24] the difference between okay yes I do
[7:26] have power but I don't have power for
[7:27] it's there it's just not in full
[7:31] maturity yet it's growing so as it grows
[7:34] it pushes out more of me and the last
[7:38] mistakes and things I'll have and you
[7:41] know the prophet of God did teach us you
[7:42] know very clear that all the all the
[7:44] vices and all it all Satan and demons
[7:46] and and all that they're just tools in
[7:49] the hand of God and when you think about
[7:51] that you know that way wise are the
[7:53] tools because you know God has a work to
[7:55] do and he needs tools to do this you
[7:57] know so he gives us these
[7:59] you know we have we have these things
[8:02] that hang on and oftentimes you know it
[8:05] as myself you know when he gave me the
[8:07] Holy Ghost like a lot of the tools but
[8:08] you know a lot of these things fella
[8:10] rave right away you know and it's like
[8:13] brother Sam was preaching this morning
[8:15] it that's because that's what he needed
[8:16] to get me there like the prodigal son to
[8:19] just for me to get desperate enough to
[8:23] receive the Holy Ghost I had certain
[8:24] things that he had and then he just let
[8:27] him all away but not all of them so the
[8:31] rest it's a process he'll when he's done
[8:36] with that tool you know he'll put it
[8:38] back in the tool box he's done you know
[8:40] work in progress and so that's why I
[8:43] believe that the the scripture can say
[8:46] so distinctly that no weapon formed
[8:49] against you will prosper you know it's
[8:51] gonna you know may be successful first
[8:53] season we're born is saying shaped in
[8:55] iniquity but once you receive the Holy
[8:57] Ghost at some point he says okay he's
[9:01] got it I'm done with this and then
[9:03] there's the final conclusion you know
[9:06] one day yeah it's gonna be done
[9:09] with all these tools and we'll say you
[9:12] know demons
[9:14] and Satan and he's gonna put that back
[9:18] in the tool box which which is death and
[9:20] hell and he's going to take them and
[9:23] just throw them on to see you guys for
[9:25] getting fullness or throw them in the
[9:27] lake of fire sorry
[9:31] because he's done with this work
[9:34] then we'll live with him
[9:37] so
[9:39] all our faults and our failures and all
[9:41] these things are only for a time God's
[9:44] gonna let him there until he's he's done
[9:47] with them
[9:47] until then
[9:50] the Holy Ghost is for power the blood is
[9:52] for
[9:54] you know the things that where we
[9:56] haven't overcome yet
[9:57] so I justify if I could just you know
[10:00] encourage you just don't walk with the
[10:03] Lord
[10:04] claim
[10:06] you know feast on the word that the Holy
[10:08] Ghost
[10:10] grow in you and for the rest
[10:14] not the let's eat and beat you up on
[10:15] that as I am NOT going to play it safe
[10:18] beat me up on this I'm gonna claim the
[10:20] blood of Jesus Christ amen amen
[10:39] I like the same except this morning I
[10:40] got tired of being myself I'm a nice
[10:42] it's a matter that this boy praise him
[10:47] until then my heart will go on singing
[10:56] [Music]
[11:03] we'll carry on until the day my knives
[11:14] we hope that city until the day God come
[11:24] there whether it makes gonna give us
[11:27] some I see it one more time until then
[11:28] but until then for my heart will go
[11:36] singing with joy I'll carry you
[11:48] praise God till the day - be home city
[11:57] [Music]
[11:59] until the day god bless y'all everybody
[12:14] put your seat belt on brother Samuel
[12:16] told me to go ahead and take much time
[12:18] as I needed
[12:23] I just want to give you a little bit of
[12:25] background about myself some of you know
[12:27] me and I've shared some things about
[12:29] myself but I really felt a need to share
[12:35] a little bit about me before I shared
[12:38] what happened to me
[12:40] this past weekend
[12:45] from a very young age I've got on the
[12:49] middle so I've got an older brother
[12:54] always been stuck in the middle
[12:58] and from a very very young age people
[13:01] have told me that you're different
[13:05] you're different than your brothers
[13:07] you're different than the rest of your
[13:08] family are different
[13:11] didn't really make sense to me
[13:15] today it makes a whole lot of sense
[13:18] [Applause]
[13:22] my kids are very blessed to be they have
[13:26] parents like us because I didn't have
[13:29] parents like that I know they loved me
[13:34] but the things I was exposed to at a
[13:38] very young age wasn't acceptable it's
[13:43] not acceptable to me
[13:45] but
[13:46] it brought me to where I'm at
[13:49] it brought me to where I'm at the things
[13:53] I did as a youngster
[13:57] I would never ever ever want
[14:06] alcohol drugs
[14:09] things like that the road I went down
[14:10] was not
[14:12] and I could sit here and say
[14:14] that I shouldn't be here I should not be
[14:18] here today
[14:21] the accidents
[14:23] there's ekits I could see it I could
[14:25] keep you all here for hours and tell you
[14:28] things
[14:29] why I shouldn't be here
[14:33] car accidents in trees that were missed
[14:36] in the car accidents like feet away
[14:40] if we would hit that tree we'd all been
[14:44] and that was just one accident there was
[14:46] many accidents but
[14:56] I was very very troubled as hyoga stir
[15:00] very troubled
[15:03] the testimony that brother Tim was
[15:05] talking about
[15:07] Oh
[15:09] brother branham just drive
[15:13] for three hours
[15:15] reading his Bible in the driver's seat
[15:19] that was God
[15:21] there was many times I woke up in my bed
[15:25] and I looked out into the driveway to
[15:28] see if my car was there because I had no
[15:30] idea how I got
[15:33] and I drove home
[15:35] it wasn't me driving
[15:39] because if it was me driving
[15:43] and it's such a blessing to think back
[15:46] on how rough it was but the tender hand
[15:52] of mercy all the way down all the way
[15:57] down because it wasn't me I'm not worthy
[15:59] of any any of this I'm not worthy other
[16:04] so I went through the system state of
[16:07] Ohio told me what I had to do which
[16:11] pretty much did or I spent a lot of time
[16:13] in jail
[16:15] in
[16:18] during this time
[16:20] stainable to the state of Ohio I had to
[16:22] go do certain things I could go to
[16:25] meetings to help the problem that I had
[16:29] well that's kind of where
[16:33] in alcoholics Anonymous they give you
[16:36] they tell you that you have to find a
[16:38] higher power I believed in God I
[16:41] believed but was I a true believer
[16:46] no I was it
[16:49] he believed in me did I believe in him
[16:51] at the time No
[16:53] so I'm praying
[16:56] I'm praying that Lord
[17:00] would bring me her my wife
[17:06] I was born in Florida she was born in
[17:09] Lorraine
[17:11] who brings us together
[17:14] who brings us together her mother and
[17:17] father
[17:19] that's been walking with the Lord a long
[17:21] time he brought me her
[17:26] she brought me here
[17:30] amazing
[17:32] how amazing is that the day I saw her
[17:36] I'd been praying
[17:38] and we were at
[17:41] Brian and my brother
[17:44] played basketball together there's
[17:46] another how does that
[17:48] brother Mark told my wife we need to
[17:50] write a book
[17:52] perhaps we will
[17:55] they were playing basketball together
[17:56] we're sitting in a gymnasium the lights
[17:58] are brighter than you can imagine I look
[18:02] across the gym
[18:04] there sits Amanda
[18:09] the gym goes dark
[18:11] and there's a light
[18:13] right there shining on her
[18:16] there she is there she is
[18:22] I knew it I knew it she was the one for
[18:26] me we may not have done things exactly
[18:29] the way they should have been done but
[18:31] God knows he knows so moving forward
[18:40] there came a day we had come to church
[18:43] we were we were the seasonals you know
[18:46] Christmas and Easter and stuff like that
[18:51] and uh so came a day I'm terrible with
[18:57] dates and stuff like that but there came
[19:01] a day brother Samuel came into my life
[19:05] sister Kim came into our life
[19:08] I got a phone call you'll have to
[19:11] forgive me uh no brother salmon it's a
[19:12] really good about remember these kind of
[19:13] things but
[19:15] he called me up says hey let's go have
[19:18] breakfast
[19:21] go
[19:22] with the blue sky
[19:27] went to blue sky
[19:29] place was packed we're having breakfast
[19:31] he's talking to me about the Lord
[19:35] in a
[19:37] he says are you ready to give your life
[19:39] to the Lord
[19:42] and I didn't even think about it there
[19:44] was no thought process yes this is okay
[19:47] let's pray
[19:48] in the middle blue sky place is packed
[19:51] I start hauling trying to pray
[19:55] brother Samuels praying with everything
[19:57] he's got
[19:59] I opened up my eyes look at me
[20:04] it just looks different
[20:07] the ketchup looks really red
[20:10] the walls look really blue because they
[20:12] got like the clouds in there painted and
[20:14] stuff he says okay now if the next step
[20:19] is going to be bad you have to be
[20:21] baptized
[20:22] and this was a Saturday so that's next
[20:25] day we came here he was sounding text I
[20:29] think it was brother Richard used to get
[20:30] them
[20:32] the baptism will go in here
[20:35] and that was a very emotional day for me
[20:37] very emotional day and brother Richard
[20:40] can attest to that
[20:42] and uh I've always been an emotional
[20:45] person but it has it had a different
[20:47] meaning
[20:48] it wasn't just oh man it wasn't oh man
[20:51] like my dog died or something like that
[20:54] because something was happening
[20:56] something was happening
[20:59] and I didn't know what it was so it was
[21:01] kind of like scary but it was good
[21:03] scared
[21:06] so
[21:11] yeah I get baptized in just a little
[21:14] nugget my wife and I his first date was
[21:18] that blue sky
[21:23] that wasn't planned that wasn't in my
[21:25] plan I didn't have like a journal saying
[21:27] okay this is what I want to happen this
[21:30] is how it happened so
[21:37] we're coming to church last year and a
[21:39] half
[21:40] some of you know we have a bed here we
[21:43] back slid but
[21:49] the Lord still has had a plan
[21:53] he wasn't he wasn't giving up
[21:57] [Applause]
[22:05] so about four weeks ago my wife was
[22:09] talking to sister Kim she came in she's
[22:14] like
[22:17] Sammy wants to talk to you it naturally
[22:24] of like ready to run the back door so it
[22:29] says you brother
[22:31] are you ready to come back home and I
[22:38] said yes I'm ready to come back home
[22:42] there was something in my stomach from
[22:45] that day we stopped coming it was like a
[22:48] brick something in my stomach I just
[22:51] didn't feel right
[22:52] I didn't feel right let me tell you
[22:54] something today I feel right so my uncle
[23:04] was getting married the Saturday of the
[23:08] meetings that we have so I'm really torn
[23:13] because my family's coming into town
[23:17] I want to see my family I want my family
[23:19] to see my kids
[23:21] but
[23:24] when we were coming we came back
[23:28] to church on a Tuesday was the prayer me
[23:31] and even brother Richard said he said I
[23:34] was really surprised to see y'all come
[23:36] back on a Tuesday
[23:42] we have things we had to get straight so
[23:46] we were supposed to go to this this this
[23:48] wedding you know and I'm torn because I
[23:52] want to see my family but yet
[23:54] something's telling me you got to be
[23:56] here you got to be here
[23:59] I got something for you I got something
[24:04] for you and I was even talking to
[24:07] brother Bryan here like you know I've
[24:09] never prayed like I have in those days
[24:14] leading up to that to the
[24:18] I've never prayed like a something come
[24:21] over something's gonna happen
[24:24] something's gonna happen my expectations
[24:27] were through the roof I knew it
[24:29] something was gonna happen he has got
[24:31] something for me so we went from
[24:35] Saturday we were talking
[24:40] well uh we're probably going to miss the
[24:42] service
[24:44] we'll go Friday miss Saturday will come
[24:46] Sunday that's closer God
[24:50] it went to
[24:52] all right we're going to go to the
[24:53] service Saturday and then we'll just go
[24:55] to the reception after service
[24:58] well
[25:02] we let him go to the wedding
[25:05] because my wife and I talked like
[25:10] we already know what's gonna happen
[25:14] with the language drinking whatever else
[25:18] and we're like no
[25:21] that's not the atmosphere
[25:25] but that's not the atmosphere we need
[25:27] again that's not the atmosphere my
[25:29] children need to be he's got something
[25:34] for me and I need to be here
[25:40] I need to be here
[25:42] so there was a few scriptures that were
[25:45] brought out in a you know reading our
[25:51] daily strength devotionals the prayer
[25:56] meetings Friday service Saturday service
[26:02] you know that confirmed where we needed
[26:04] to be and that was at the fellowship
[26:06] that's where we went and I knew that
[26:12] some of the family members were gonna
[26:15] just draw their own conclusions well
[26:17] he's not here he's too good why aren't
[26:20] they here versus kids we're all up here
[26:23] were they out why I talked to my dad my
[26:26] dad's pretty understanding person I said
[26:28] dad there's a pretty good chance that
[26:30] we're gonna be late
[26:33] I got to be a church I got to be there
[26:36] I've got a really strong feeling that we
[26:39] he's got something for me and I gotta be
[26:41] there I don't know what it is but I he's
[26:44] got something for me
[26:46] so then after the service Saturday I
[26:48] sent a text to my mom I'm sorry but
[26:51] we're not gonna make it
[26:52] everything's okay we're just not gonna
[26:54] be there well she was disappointed
[27:01] in you know it kind of got me down a
[27:03] little bit but if she knew what I do she
[27:09] wouldn't be disappointed she wouldn't be
[27:12] disappointed she would want to be here
[27:15] too so
[27:20] Saturday or Sunday service was like
[27:26] nothing I've ever experienced in my life
[27:30] I've never experienced anything like
[27:32] that with all the things that I've done
[27:34] and in sports I've done this I've done
[27:36] that whatever I've had really like
[27:39] ultimate adrenaline rushes
[27:42] and let me tell you something
[27:44] that doesn't even hold a camp
[27:47] - what happened here
[27:48] doesn't even hold a candle to
[27:53] I was sitting I've been struggling with
[27:55] something for a really really really
[27:59] long time it's been holding me back and
[28:01] I know it's been holding me back and
[28:03] that stick should addiction to
[28:05] cigarettes
[28:08] and I was sitting right there about
[28:11] halfway through the service and I said
[28:13] Lord I'm done I'm done with it
[28:18] just take it from me I don't want it I
[28:21] don't want it he took it right there
[28:24] [Applause]
[28:30] turn I turn my back to it the devil has
[28:35] been trying to get to me this thing
[28:42] right here that shield right there then
[28:46] them darts that the Prophet talks about
[28:48] their darts and arrows it's like doink
[28:52] don't toy don't think you can have it
[29:01] back
[29:02] don't won at the end of the service I'm
[29:06] standing up here it's something hit me
[29:11] like I stuck my finger in a light socket
[29:15] like I got electrocuted he filled me up
[29:20] he filled me up I know he did he filled
[29:25] me with the Holy Ghost
[29:28] and I have not been the same I'm a
[29:32] different person I walked out of the
[29:34] doors
[29:34] a different person completely different
[29:40] he deserves all the glory thank you
[29:48] thank you for all the prayers to because
[29:50] I was sitting in my kitchen table before
[29:51] we came back and I looked at my wife and
[29:53] I said everybody's praying for us
[29:56] everybody's praying for us I can feel it
[29:59] and that was the next day when sister
[30:01] Kim was on the phone and then I talked
[30:02] to brother Samuel so
[30:05] how does that happen
[30:10] amen praise the Lord Amen praise John
[30:25] and I play it I played a lot of sports
[30:27] when I was and I was in high school but
[30:29] I was usually on the bench so I don't
[30:31] know what that feels like but I'm glad
[30:34] he let me know that what I'm
[30:35] experiencing when I come the house of
[30:37] God is better than winning a chick a man
[30:44] when he was on the cross I was on his
[30:46] mind praise God I came by my own you see
[30:47] that Ben Ben's got a testimony for us
[30:49] but when he was on the cross was on his
[31:00] mind for he knew me Ben baby come
[31:04] Oh
[31:12] yeah
[31:19] [Music]
[31:23] Florie mates hitting a child
[31:30] [Music]
[31:32] so
[31:37] so unworthy of his mercy hallelujah but
[31:48] when he saw the crows
[31:53] [Music]
[31:59] amen Ben's got a testimony for us
[32:11] prison
[32:16] sure I'm nervous but I'm gonna go ahead
[32:21] and go for it so just wanted to start
[32:25] with like background to
[32:29] like since I was 4 years old my heart
[32:32] was always very tender towards the Lord
[32:35] and I remember him dealing with me I
[32:38] think my mother I don't remember it but
[32:40] my mom remembers it
[32:41] I was watching a video Christian
[32:44] homeschooling video and then the teacher
[32:48] on there have made an invitation if you
[32:50] want to accept Lord Jesus as your Savior
[32:52] then you know just pray with us and I
[32:56] did I was only four years old but I
[32:57] remember it but yeah that's that's what
[33:01] it happened to me at 4 years old and
[33:02] then God dealt with me up again at 8
[33:05] years old to get baptized and I didn't
[33:10] really know when I got baptized I don't
[33:12] know I thought I was good I thought that
[33:16] was the last step but then at age 11 I
[33:20] God I think it just had to be him
[33:23] dealing with my heart because I can
[33:26] remember there was one night I don't
[33:28] know if mom remembers it or not but
[33:30] there was one night where I was in my
[33:33] bed and I started crying for like almost
[33:35] I want us I wanted to say for no reason
[33:38] but it was just I was crying and then I
[33:40] went you know mom trying to help me
[33:43] almost like I was like I just don't know
[33:44] what's going on I was like I thought you
[33:46] know I was good you know I've been
[33:48] baptized
[33:50] I thought I I was okay and I didn't
[33:52] really know if there even was a Holy
[33:54] Ghost you know I mean III heard the word
[33:56] but I know really what it was at the
[33:59] time but that Mont I was like why is
[34:04] their wedding church so happy I was like
[34:06] I understand that and moms like well you
[34:12] know that's the Holy Ghost and
[34:13] everything and everyone loves each other
[34:14] you know it makes the one you know
[34:16] together puts everyone together so then
[34:21] at age 11 through 15 I trade you know
[34:25] seeking the Holy Ghost but I think you
[34:30] know the reason why I hadn't received it
[34:32] you know for a while it was because I
[34:34] tried to I had like a plan of how
[34:38] everything was gonna have
[34:39] in my life but it's like the most
[34:43] unexpected thing no it's not at all it's
[34:46] not at all with people you don't make it
[34:48] out to be it's just it's so different
[34:50] then you know I tried to see camp like I
[34:55] said I just I got discouraged and then
[34:56] and about I don't know I'm just gonna
[34:59] you know I said you know about was about
[35:02] 16 years old and I was just tired I was
[35:06] just I was tired I was tired of seeking
[35:08] it I was so discouraged and I just
[35:11] wanted to get out into the world I was I
[35:12] was tired I told Dad I mean I can
[35:15] remember about maybe three or four weeks
[35:18] ago I had made a threat to my dad that I
[35:21] was gonna do much of stuff I was like
[35:23] you don't want me to go to campus I said
[35:25] I'm just gonna live it up or whatever
[35:27] and I said what to bring a bunch of
[35:29] stuff in the house and he said no you're
[35:31] not he said the Holy Ghost will tell me
[35:33] if you're gonna do that and I was so
[35:40] discouraged I was like how I was like
[35:41] look I mean yeah you people might laugh
[35:45] when I say this bells like me I got my
[35:47] temps I kind of I got I've got I've got
[35:50] everything you know I've got I can make
[35:53] purchases without cash well I kept my
[35:56] debit got a phone and everything so I
[36:00] thought I had everything and I was like
[36:02] I was tired I was like dad I was like
[36:04] what'd I do to deserve this I'm like I
[36:05] keep trying to find a satisfaction I was
[36:07] like nothing's nothing's working I've
[36:10] tried everything and then dad's like you
[36:13] just gotta said you know the answer and
[36:15] I was not
[36:16] like to accept that answer because I'd
[36:19] know what it was gonna Intel I didn't
[36:21] know what was gonna happen to me then
[36:24] God had dealt with my life at last week
[36:28] at a prayer meeting need that with my
[36:30] life and I started her back to him and I
[36:34] still had things in my life that I that
[36:36] wasn't surrender and I had habits and
[36:38] different things but and then I could
[36:42] just remember Friday the whole weekend
[36:44] the devil was just punching me so hard
[36:46] he was discouraging me you know like his
[36:49] brother Tim was preaching on spiritual
[36:52] transportation and you know and then
[36:56] living under eternal life law I was like
[36:58] look these services are not for me I was
[37:00] like I just want to leave I was like
[37:02] this is just not for me
[37:04] and then I can remember Saturday night I
[37:07] got so discouraged I was like I'm never
[37:08] gonna have the Holy Ghost strike another
[37:10] ten years I said there's too many things
[37:11] in my life I was like that's never gonna
[37:13] happen and then Sunday I didn't even
[37:16] have the attention I'm getting the Holy
[37:17] Ghost I was like I want this weekend to
[37:20] be over with so I can get back to doing
[37:22] whatever I was doing
[37:25] but God had different plans for my life
[37:29] and I remember it was just so strong and
[37:33] then I I was just trembling and I
[37:37] brother Richard he helped you know and I
[37:40] can remember I think brother Adam too
[37:42] they helped pray for me and then I went
[37:46] over here and then holy goes just like
[37:48] numb to me and I never experienced
[37:51] anything like that my whole life but
[37:55] then after that I didn't know like
[37:58] through the week I was like is it just a
[37:59] feeling or what happened and then I just
[38:03] noticed I tried to persuade myself
[38:05] almost and then the devil tried to
[38:08] persuade like nothing happened because
[38:10] i-i've I've been the camp last year I
[38:13] remember like the prince the Lord fell
[38:15] down and I shouted so loud and I was
[38:17] like I hope it's not another one of
[38:18] those times but it was real
[38:23] it affected my daily life and I thought
[38:26] it was I can remember telling mom and
[38:28] dad I said that's fake I said I said the
[38:31] life that I told Paul to I said the life
[38:36] you guys live is just fake I remember
[38:39] telling him that and then they said no
[38:41] Ben it's real and I didn't know that
[38:43] until I've been there and it's just
[38:47] everything is different your diet is so
[38:50] different everything everything you do
[38:53] is so different and even the things you
[38:56] love are just so different and listening
[38:58] to the messages and even hearing my dad
[39:00] preach it's just like a numbing fire it
[39:03] just keeps like keeps burning
[39:08] but what I would say right now to anyone
[39:13] especially especially a young person
[39:16] who's wanting to receive the Holy Ghost
[39:18] I would just tell you to not get
[39:20] discouraged and just keep seeking it and
[39:25] then ask God to give you a hunger for it
[39:28] and then to allow him to ask him to draw
[39:32] you to himself and then
[39:35] when you feel the presence of the Lord I
[39:37] know it's tempting because you're not
[39:39] exactly a part of it so I know it's
[39:41] tempting you just run a run away because
[39:43] your app if you don't understand the
[39:45] power of something you're apprehensive
[39:46] about it that's how I was but instead of
[39:50] doing that just I would tell you to run
[39:52] into it you know just run into it and
[39:55] allow God to do it because you know he
[40:00] has to do it his way because I thought I
[40:01] was like this is gonna happen that's
[40:02] gonna happen and won't true at all he
[40:06] just he took all that stuff from me
[40:11] just I know sometimes because he told
[40:14] the devil told me this is a lot of times
[40:16] young people they think that they have
[40:19] to go out and experience the world and
[40:21] stuff and I tried I did everything was
[40:24] to the limits that mom and dad would let
[40:26] me do I tried everything you know but
[40:30] just don't you don't have to do it you
[40:32] don't have to even desire it you don't
[40:35] have to do it you just ask God to take
[40:37] those and a lot of times they also they
[40:40] think that the Holy Spirit will take
[40:43] away like oh he'll make me just like not
[40:46] even what pleasure but what he does is
[40:48] he changes your definition of pleasure
[40:55] that's just what happened to me this
[40:57] week that's just what happened to me and
[41:00] it's real I know if it's not very you
[41:05] know if you don't feel that yeah but
[41:06] it's not about what you feel and there's
[41:09] just like even like a you know there's
[41:11] there's times you make mistakes and
[41:13] stuff like brother ever saying you know
[41:16] you make mistakes to know they're saying
[41:20] you make mistakes but that's what the
[41:21] what's
[41:23] and you realize where you came from
[41:24] where you don't willfully walking into
[41:27] that I never thought this life was
[41:32] possible to be quite honest I'm like how
[41:36] did I get here I just I know y'all were
[41:46] praying for me even when I didn't know
[41:47] it you all for prayed for me and I
[41:50] appreciate that and just may God bless
[41:56] [Applause]
[42:06] everyone say so
[42:11] mr. Brown he wanted me to give a
[42:13] testimony but today all I wanted to do
[42:15] was bask in the testimony what happened
[42:18] son
[42:19] I want to add something
[42:22] when we were here mostly people front
[42:27] Euan come up he was right next to me
[42:30] I grabbed the whole
[42:33] that I knew it was I knew
[42:37] because you know I'm not muted this way
[42:40] and something kept saying it's finished
[42:44] it's finished
[42:49] and holding him up
[42:51] and how we just so grateful because
[42:53] being a deacon I sit in the back
[42:55] being around I've been around for a long
[42:57] time and sometimes you know who has it
[42:59] or don't have it and one day I told my
[43:02] wife I says you know if we had a
[43:05] testimony service I'm wondering how many
[43:06] people could really come up and say I
[43:08] have the Holy Ghost so this was a
[43:10] tremendous service and and I knew that
[43:14] Benjamin was struggling I knew it even
[43:15] though I didn't talk to him I knew it
[43:17] and he was just tremendous for me he was
[43:21] one so I just want to add
[43:24] I knew what's going on god I'll never be
[43:38] able to take that away from God gave it
[43:44] to him
[43:44] enemy on they'd be able to take it away
[43:46] from and my god is real insane they have
[43:48] a little bit man with Brian's cousin
[43:49] before us oh my god is real he's
[43:56] breathing my soul my god it's real for
[44:03] he has most made me whole his love for
[44:09] me it's like your goal my god is real oh
[44:18] I can feel him in my soul more time oh
[44:23] my
[44:24] yes my god is real he is reeling my soul
[44:30] my God is real
[44:33] Hori as most babyhood
[44:38] for his love for me it's like oh my god
[44:47] is real
[44:50] [Music]
[44:57] amen
[44:59] Bush y'all just one arm give a quick
[45:03] toast the morning then I'm gonna sing
[45:04] but um just want to give God thanks for
[45:08] everything he he did for me this uh
[45:10] during those services especially Sunday
[45:13] I know what God did at work in my life
[45:18] but probably back in 2009 2010 when
[45:24] brother Sam I was talking about our
[45:25] youth meeting that we had you know God
[45:29] spoke to me at work one time I had a
[45:32] question in my heart cuz during that
[45:37] time there was a lot of ministers saying
[45:39] you know you can only have the Holy
[45:41] Ghost if you have a seed in your heart
[45:42] you know to be quickened so I always had
[45:45] that question Lord do I even have a seed
[45:48] you know to be quickened and
[46:05] and he spoke to me one day
[46:13] sorry
[46:18] he said you were my seed that's always
[46:30] stuck with me but you know I just kept
[46:35] holding on to things to the world and
[46:37] you know God just started taking things
[46:39] one after another and but there you know
[46:46] I believe God did a change in my life
[46:48] and I had the Holy Ghost but with my
[46:50] past saying just always kept condemning
[46:54] me condemning me and I can never just
[46:56] worship the Lord I've always wanted to
[46:59] you know I just wanted to let loose and
[47:02] let God take control you know of my
[47:05] whole heart and when brother Samuel read
[47:10] from the book of Joshua
[47:11] you know sanctify yourselves prepare
[47:14] yourselves you know even at the prayer
[47:17] meeting like Aaron was saying something
[47:18] just hit my heart I can't even explain
[47:21] it I told my family I told my girlfriend
[47:25] I said something's gonna happen I could
[47:28] not I could not explain it something was
[47:30] just like over top of me
[47:32] I knew something was gonna happen but I
[47:35] didn't I don't know if it was gonna be
[47:37] the whole assembly or I don't know and I
[47:41] just told everybody I was like I haven't
[47:44] told my cell phone I felt like shame
[47:46] guard my whole life you know just living
[47:47] underneath the privileges you know just
[47:50] felt like Satan has robbed me you know I
[47:53] never was able to surrender and just
[47:56] letting the Philistines we don't always
[47:58] take what shame guard grew you know
[48:02] I just always lived underneath my
[48:04] privileges and I lost my joy too
[48:08] and I always felt like you know it was a
[48:13] chore to read the Bible or listen to a
[48:16] message and you know I just asked God to
[48:21] give me back my joy this this weekend
[48:24] you know I just wanted more of him to
[48:28] just live for him completely you know
[48:30] and just everything that I've done in
[48:33] the past I just wanted it to be under
[48:36] the blood you know and not be hit with
[48:38] it all the time sinking always punching
[48:40] me and stuff just be sitting there and
[48:43] the words coming forth and I want to get
[48:45] up and shout but you did this you did
[48:48] that you know remember you know you
[48:52] better not shout you better not whatever
[48:54] and just the whole the whole weekend
[49:01] just and brother singing I said sanctify
[49:04] and prepare I've never like Aaron said
[49:07] I've never prayed as much as I ever have
[49:11] in my life and just haven't even fasting
[49:15] that whole time Friday I I was never
[49:19] hungry you know fasting and praying I
[49:21] was never hungry and brother Brett you
[49:25] know how brother Bram said you know when
[49:27] you're desperate enough God will God
[49:29] will show up and I was desperate you
[49:30] know I wanted I don't want the Bible to
[49:32] just be a letter I want it to be a
[49:37] reality I wanted God to live in me
[49:41] become flesh again and that was my
[49:44] heart's desire and that's just what was
[49:45] really speaking to me you know the Holy
[49:48] Ghost is a person
[49:49] you know and and just Sunday just
[49:54] hearing the word and just being in that
[49:57] atmosphere but just something struck me
[50:01] I was able to just select loose you know
[50:04] I'm just worship God like I always
[50:07] wanted to like you know I I ran around
[50:13] and I've never felt so afraid in my life
[50:15] you know well Karen said we we played
[50:24] sports and basketball you know there's
[50:26] been many times you know the adrenaline
[50:28] rush but I want to trade that for
[50:31] nothing in the world I just like to yeah
[50:38] and just what Ben was saying you know
[50:40] just ever since I haven't been able to
[50:43] put my Bible down I haven't you know
[50:46] just just listening the message after
[50:48] message just God speaking to me and like
[50:50] you know I may not understand everything
[50:52] but brother's saying I said you know I'm
[50:54] just keep filling the water pots they'll
[50:56] turn the water into wine you know you
[51:00] know saying always you select to battle
[51:01] with me you know you know what's this
[51:03] mean we'll just mean what's this mean
[51:04] you know and I could just never you know
[51:07] I just you know would ponder on that you
[51:10] know what let God have his way but
[51:13] well I just want God to take control
[51:15] reveal what he has for me every day he
[51:18] knows what I need so just like to end um
[51:21] one more thing a couple years ago when I
[51:26] was dealing with a lot of things in my
[51:28] life brother say Merle spoke I was
[51:33] speaking on a Thursday night I'm not
[51:34] sure what message it was but he spoke
[51:38] something I believe was a prophesy over
[51:39] my life you know that really struck to
[51:42] me and I went back and listened to it
[51:43] wrote it down and I would read it from
[51:45] time to time and when I was in prayer
[51:50] after the meetings the Lord says

[1:10:36] would be discarded with the trash

[1:14:41] creation testify let this life would be
[1:14:47] me crying hi
[1:14:52] [Music]
[1:15:10] back in I'm currently in my last year of
[1:15:13] residency so
[1:15:16] to practice and back in January I had
[1:15:21] put in some job applications and such
[1:15:25] and and I'd asked the church to pray
[1:15:29] graciously
[1:15:32] I know many have continued brother
[1:15:34] Sanchez
[1:15:36] even sometimes before the church they've
[1:15:38] brought it
[1:15:41] really appreciate that and thank you
[1:15:44] the as far as the process it took you
[1:15:49] know January the starting practice takes
[1:15:52] a it's a significant amount of legal
[1:15:55] legalese and yet to be very careful with
[1:15:58] the practices you consider inside so
[1:16:01] there were a lot of options that came
[1:16:04] about
[1:16:07] one of the desire that we had is we want
[1:16:11] to always seek you first the kingdom of
[1:16:14] God and all these things will be added
[1:16:16] unto you
[1:16:16] so wherever wherever we've considered
[1:16:19] the main our primary concern is that the
[1:16:22] environment were is one where we could
[1:16:25] continue to grow in Christ
[1:16:29] so
[1:16:32] when we when we looked at different
[1:16:34] areas the there were quite a few
[1:16:37] opportunities and the best one the best
[1:16:41] ones ended up being elsewhere the most
[1:16:45] most viable option being in Knoxville
[1:16:49] Tennessee but throughout the process
[1:16:53] Kristin and I we
[1:16:56] you know we kept asking the Lord for
[1:17:00] we actually had kind of developed
[1:17:03] love for for you all and being in this
[1:17:07] area and and we felt that this was this
[1:17:11] was a place where we we are growing
[1:17:16] it was truly our heart's desire to stay
[1:17:18] here
[1:17:20] for the season
[1:17:23] also when if you if you start that and
[1:17:26] if you go into actual practice that
[1:17:28] you're you're pretty much locked in for
[1:17:30] you know five years to a decade so it's
[1:17:32] it's a big time period that you that you
[1:17:36] commit to
[1:17:37] essentially
[1:17:39] so we we continued to pray this whole
[1:17:43] time
[1:17:43] that we we continued working with this
[1:17:46] opportunity in Tennessee and there were
[1:17:51] financially at work it was a very good
[1:17:54] one but there were a lot of legal you
[1:17:59] know legal courses you have to go
[1:18:00] through where they review and then they
[1:18:03] they bring back a contract and then you
[1:18:05] have your your attorney review and then
[1:18:07] get back with them and so there's a
[1:18:10] there's all this waiting and the whole
[1:18:12] time we were praying you know can we
[1:18:14] have another opportunity happen here or
[1:18:18] and or somewhere that we that we really
[1:18:23] felt was was where we wanted to be
[1:18:25] spiritually
[1:18:27] so
[1:18:30] during this time period brother Samuel
[1:18:33] was preaching a series of messages out
[1:18:35] of First Samuel where where Saul is is
[1:18:42] waiting for Samuel and the Philistines
[1:18:45] and he's gonna you know encounter the
[1:18:48] Philistines shortly and Saul ends up
[1:18:50] being if he frets in his mind and he he
[1:18:57] becomes impatient and that he acts
[1:18:58] without without out of order out of
[1:19:02] God's order so part of what I'm thankful
[1:19:07] for is that even though we weren't
[1:19:09] entirely comfortable with the
[1:19:11] opportunity I probably would have gone
[1:19:13] with it had it not been for His grace
[1:19:18] allowing further revisions to the
[1:19:21] contracts and everything to continue
[1:19:25] so but as as this process was continuing
[1:19:30] I I realized that there's a scripture in
[1:19:36] Philippians where be careful for nothing
[1:19:39] and I hadn't I realized even though I
[1:19:44] felt or I thought that I had committed
[1:19:46] my my ways to God I realized that there
[1:19:51] was a deeper level of trust that I
[1:19:53] hadn't come to yet and
[1:19:58] and there was one one of my one of the
[1:20:01] opportunities I had most hoped for that
[1:20:04] would work out here they ended up saying
[1:20:07] unfortunately it wouldn't work out this
[1:20:09] year and I remember just feeling very
[1:20:12] despondent about that not it was it was
[1:20:18] not not what I had wanted
[1:20:21] but as I was disappointed
[1:20:25] eventually I realized that you know what
[1:20:28] it's all in God's hands and and I kind
[1:20:34] of reached the place where between Saul
[1:20:36] and David the great difference was David
[1:20:41] had faith and he just had complete and
[1:20:43] utter trust in God
[1:20:46] and so when when I reached that place it
[1:20:52] was like you know what I know that I
[1:20:53] know it's gonna work out this was the
[1:20:56] last door I'd hoped for but whatever you
[1:20:59] know whatever is your will if I'm about
[1:21:02] to go to Tennessee I'll I'll go but even
[1:21:06] but I know that if it's your desire for
[1:21:08] us to stay here you can make away
[1:21:13] and that was on a Friday and I remember
[1:21:15] actually on Sunday brother brother bill
[1:21:17] came up and he said the Lord told me to
[1:21:20] tell you to keep the faith and that week
[1:21:25] and I ended up hearing rumors that
[1:21:28] something may actually be available they
[1:21:33] called a fellowship which is that was
[1:21:35] actually what I had originally planned
[1:21:36] to do this year or this coming year but
[1:21:40] it hadn't worked out just do a couple
[1:21:43] factors but but the next Monday I was
[1:21:49] supposed to receive the final contract
[1:21:51] to sign to go to Knoxville and that
[1:21:55] evening the contract still hadn't come I
[1:21:58] guess and they said I'm sorry our lawyer
[1:22:01] had one more revision or they still
[1:22:03] hadn't gone back to us so it'll probably
[1:22:04] be tomorrow and then that evening the
[1:22:10] director of a fellowship actually in the
[1:22:13] Cleveland area called me up and he said
[1:22:15] you know we actually do to some very
[1:22:18] unusual circumstances our fellowship
[1:22:20] opened up so we're we're thankful and
[1:22:31] I'm glad that God used it as a learning
[1:22:34] opportunity for me because I haven't
[1:22:36] reached you know and I thought I trusted
[1:22:38] him but I there was a deeper level I
[1:22:41] could reach and then
[1:22:43] you know he was faithful he knew our the
[1:22:46] desires of our heart and in fact we had
[1:22:48] committed I'm so thankful for God doing
[1:22:52] that and also for unusual circumstances
[1:23:05] don't that sound familiar
[1:23:06] [Laughter]
[1:23:11] praise God
[1:23:13] hey let's do of course I stay and

[1:43:37] you I really appreciate it thank you
[1:43:43] very much brother Carlos I mean he
[1:43:47] already said he went to Puerto Rico I
[1:43:49] was going through a lot of things there
[1:43:51] at the age of 16 I was 16
[1:43:54] well my parents you know he kicked me
[1:43:56] out from the house I was living I don't
[1:43:58] know what to go I had no place to stay
[1:44:01] at the age of 16 imagine oh wow I didn't
[1:44:06] understand why then I dare say there was
[1:44:10] a family Torres family the radio stay my
[1:44:13] brother Willie
[1:44:15] so Billy - Billy Billy jr. he was there
[1:44:21] he was staying there by himself
[1:44:28] I remember there was a service when a
[1:44:31] Pentecostal church after a careful I
[1:44:33] used to play the guitar there I couldn't
[1:44:36] understand I mean why my dad the way he
[1:44:39] was acting sometimes we don't know the
[1:44:41] things that happen in our lives and and
[1:44:44] it sometimes we is the Lord working
[1:44:47] moving you know placing the stuff you
[1:44:50] know my home they are kicking me out
[1:44:52] from the house
[1:44:53] anyway I I was living with the village I
[1:44:59] was staying on that house on that year
[1:45:03] he decided come back over here to visit
[1:45:06] visit experience from it was his by the
[1:45:12] school break he came here and that's
[1:45:15] what they maybe Ricardo's birthday no
[1:45:17] Danny's here
[1:45:20] but anyway they went to Puerto Rico and
[1:45:24] I remember brother Carlos and one of the
[1:45:26] treachery was going I don't know where
[1:45:28] we was going brother Carlo but what
[1:45:30] color was in the front seat passenger
[1:45:32] and I was in the back and he was he was
[1:45:36] talking about the Lord but these things
[1:45:38] that I hear now the message thing he was
[1:45:40] talking I find I find I hear those
[1:45:43] things like kind of weird to me because
[1:45:46] I don't understand nothing and even he
[1:45:49] was talking about the baptism and I was
[1:45:51] asking the Lord because I was pretty
[1:45:53] Castille and I believe I pray so I was
[1:45:57] praying or chitchat his mouth please do
[1:45:59] not want to hear this stuff and the more
[1:46:01] was praying he was talking more and it
[1:46:07] wasn't working the prayers wasn't
[1:46:09] working dude I'm gonna I'm gonna pray
[1:46:12] again can you please shut his mouth Lord
[1:46:15] and he kept on talking talking I'm
[1:46:18] talking and I was I was a Pentecostal
[1:46:22] remember and and then he was talking
[1:46:26] about the Lord and I was listening and
[1:46:29] for some so for some reason he chose
[1:46:32] everything by the Bible by the
[1:46:34] scriptures
[1:46:36] and I I my heart even though I was in
[1:46:40] the denomination's I had a very
[1:46:44] sensitive heart for the Lord I was
[1:46:47] believing his world but nobody showed me
[1:46:50] the baptism the water baptism the way he
[1:46:54] proved to mean by these creatures and
[1:46:57] when I saw it here I just saw it
[1:47:00] that's a at the very place I used to go
[1:47:04] remember but Carlos have water right
[1:47:07] there beautiful I used to go there just
[1:47:09] just to have fun I died right there I
[1:47:12] remember right there he did a heap that
[1:47:15] I decided say yes I'm gonna go to the
[1:47:17] water a lot of people wasn't I agree
[1:47:20] with me because Father Son and Holy
[1:47:23] Ghost you know that's the name for them
[1:47:25] but through the wife while I find out
[1:47:27] that those three is just one the Lord
[1:47:29] Jesus Christ you know and they will try
[1:47:33] to put in my mind a lot of things when I
[1:47:36] came from Puerto Rico to here I was
[1:47:39] still you know I was new I don't
[1:47:41] remember one time I was gonna leave him
[1:47:43] go away how always remember that
[1:47:45] well ray Hernandez you talk I don't know
[1:47:48] if you remember he told me just give
[1:47:50] yourself time don't leave if he wasn't
[1:47:52] because of you brother I would have been
[1:47:53] back in Puerto Rico so let you know that
[1:47:57] that now so you know I never told you
[1:47:59] that so anyway I decided to stay here
[1:48:02] how did things went through my life a
[1:48:04] lot of things then one day I said father
[1:48:07] son holy God how can I understand that I
[1:48:11] want to see it I know I hear it but I
[1:48:13] believe it but I don't understand it
[1:48:15] and then one day one day I went to sleep
[1:48:19] our sprained
[1:48:22] is I start having a dream and the dream
[1:48:26] you was I was in one of the brother
[1:48:28] brands services and it was all full
[1:48:32] place where he was preaching and he has
[1:48:36] this question who of you in the audience
[1:48:39] believed it
[1:48:42] the Jesus is the Holy Spirit
[1:48:46] nobody really raised a him but I said I
[1:48:50] go like this
[1:48:51] yes me I was the only one and then when
[1:48:55] I lift up my hand I remember I felt back
[1:48:59] floor and I saw a light coming from
[1:49:02] heaven and it was a square light in
[1:49:06] front of my head my face and he was
[1:49:09] shining like this you know and then I
[1:49:12] was talking like a drunker and I was
[1:49:14] like praise Allah
[1:49:18] like a drunkard I wanted to talk but I
[1:49:21] couldn't I couldn't talk and that
[1:49:23] vindication right there since that day
[1:49:25] they showed me and I go wow it's more
[1:49:30] clear than the water and I was like wow
[1:49:34] it was a beautiful dream until today so

[2:00:09] and you really can't get a hope of that
[2:00:13] be holy and you know like the
[2:00:17] testimonies we've heard you know we all
[2:00:18] know what we are what we came from and
[2:00:21] could be holy how do you comprehend you
[2:00:27] know God is holy it's been a testimony
[2:00:32] I've had for a little while now it's
[2:00:36] Lord open up the way today we had our
[2:00:41] communion service and you know I didn't
[2:00:47] prepare for it like we've been told you
[2:00:49] know I I live my regular life you know
[2:00:54] and I made my mistakes
[2:00:58] did stuff wrong I knew I was doing wrong
[2:01:01] I did it but you know what your
[2:01:03] community and it was a good time I know
[2:01:08] it was we all we all I could feel the
[2:01:10] presence of the Lord you know it was
[2:01:13] definitely a solemn sincere occasion
[2:01:19] that Monday morning I got ready for work
[2:01:25] I go to work met on the job site
[2:01:30] I'm contemplating about you know the
[2:01:34] communion service and different
[2:01:36] scriptures and just for something
[2:01:40] strange something is different yeah I
[2:01:45] couldn't put my finger on and I'm trying
[2:01:48] to work and I think just keep going
[2:01:50] through my head and it's not been one
[2:01:55] evil thought
[2:01:59] and like I said who wants to be holding
[2:02:05] the only thing I can say I it it wasn't
[2:02:16] anything I'd done darling I can say that
[2:02:18] did too and we all did
[2:02:21] she says do this in remembrance of me
[2:02:26] and it lasted to the next day I didn't
[2:02:29] even know what was happening I mean I
[2:02:34] couldn't understand that scripture I
[2:02:36] mean you know you get a interpretation
[2:02:39] you have being your holder well you know
[2:02:40] the book says you and all that but you
[2:02:44] know I experienced it I mean I my
[2:02:48] supervisor he walked in the building I
[2:02:50] was at and I probably cried three or
[2:02:54] four times that morning just from their
[2:02:56] presence but he walks in he usually got
[2:02:59] always got something to say her
[2:03:00] straighten me out or something he walks
[2:03:03] in yes I mean I I couldn't really
[2:03:15] understand the scripture be holy it's
[2:03:18] just just even now without that feeling
[2:03:23] right there is kind of really hard to
[2:03:25] understand that but it's not in me and
[2:03:29] it's not at you
[2:03:32] mr. Lord he were special bless people I
[2:03:44] don't know of any other group of people
[2:03:46] who could ever ever she have a testimony
[2:03:48] like what we've got you know it's it's
[2:03:53] more than a denominational thing or a
[2:03:59] religious thing I'll just share
[2:04:03] something I had in fact I wanted to tell
[2:04:07] brother Humes I never got the chance but
[2:04:11] I was reading a message brother Bram
[2:04:14] said up
[2:04:16] he says you might think now the greatest
[2:04:18] gift to the church is Christ he says but
[2:04:23] it's not just the Holy Ghost he says
[2:04:26] jesus said whatever you say or do to me
[2:04:31] will be forgiven
[2:04:35] say one word against it and the reason I
[2:04:38] say we're special people is if you can't
[2:04:42] say that new denomination that he has
[2:04:45] come I mean you really can't grab ahold
[2:04:48] of what I just said
[2:04:51] that the greatest gift is the Holy Ghost
[2:04:54] you can have gifts the gifts won't
[2:04:57] change your life
[2:04:58] it takes that person it takes it takes
[2:05:02] the person
[2:05:03] the greatest gift this the Holy Ghost
[2:05:09] that's just you know I hope it helps
[2:05:12] somebody about you know because we all
[2:05:14] fight we all fight you know our flesh
[2:05:16] and the word says be holy I mean how do
[2:05:20] you even put that in place you just you
[2:05:24] really came but it's him he took you
[2:05:28] into himself and that's where it comes
[2:05:30] from and I just want to say ever since
[2:05:46] we had those special meetings I mean you
[2:05:49] know the we was talking about this man
[2:05:50] one feeling many reef fillings and stuff
[2:05:53] you know and you know nobody's perfect I
[2:05:56] ain't perfect nobody perfect you know
[2:05:59] and I I kind of sometimes you just sing
[2:06:01] a song and you just kind of go through
[2:06:02] the motions and it just kind of you know
[2:06:06] sing it and somebody else gets blessed
[2:06:08] you feel glad for them you know tells
[2:06:10] the song leader I look out and I'm not
[2:06:12] feeling so good and I see somebody else
[2:06:13] get blessed I'm just happy to see them
[2:06:16] get blessed you know but ever since we
[2:06:18] had these special meetings it feels like
[2:06:20] every single song that we're singing
[2:06:22] it's like every word in on every line
[2:06:24] there's just like poof popping out at me
[2:06:27] you know meaning something different
[2:06:29] than it's ever met before
[2:06:30] I just I just thank God for the
[2:06:32] refilling you know as a Christian thank
[2:06:34] God for the refilling of the Holy Ghost

[2:09:21] Oh
[2:09:22] [Music]
[2:09:23] I just wanna give a little testimony on
[2:09:27] so they the Lord was dealing with being
[2:09:29] involved
[2:09:35] saying something
[2:09:41] I was fighting with her and I said I
[2:09:44] don't know I don't know I said no I
[2:09:50] don't know if I want to say it or I was
[2:09:52] praying and I said oh Lord I said what
[2:09:55] if you want me to say something when I
[2:09:57] have to tell me don't tell me something
[2:09:59] about it and then the brother said what
[2:10:03] I gift the Lord protect that gift in the
[2:10:07] church and you do you don't want them
[2:10:10] how are you you know you do with them
[2:10:13] what you want to do whatever you want to
[2:10:16] do with them so I say okay
[2:10:19] all right Lauren so I just want to say
[2:10:23] that how the Lord is the son it's here
[2:10:28] the Lord is here in there is an another
[2:10:34] testimony um I got a lot of supernatural
[2:10:39] things that the Lord is doing here and
[2:10:42] in the midst of us but I'm not gonna say
[2:10:46] more but um
[2:10:48] when the brother the brother the Lord
[2:10:51] was dealing with him in the back I I
[2:10:54] went to the back and when I was coming
[2:10:59] this way I just I grabbed
[2:11:07] teachers issues i ground two of those a
[2:11:10] night and I had to hang keys there so I
[2:11:14] grabbed him and I said I just grabbed
[2:11:16] them and so when I was when I was there
[2:11:19] then the brother was right there by me
[2:11:22] and it was just the Lord had those
[2:11:28] tissues for him so I just want to share
[2:11:36] that in them I also want to share also
[2:11:39] on another supernatural for him too
[2:11:45] there was a couple years I think before
[2:11:48] he started playing a guitar in the back
[2:11:53] I was sitting there and I started
[2:11:58] hearing that their music I started
[2:12:01] hearing a guitar music and I was so
[2:12:05] beautiful ready I'm I never you know it
[2:12:09] was so beautiful and I said I wonder if
[2:12:12] somebody could music in the back and
[2:12:15] then it was one brother Sammy was
[2:12:20] preaching after he preached they started
[2:12:23] talking that's when I started hearing
[2:12:25] their music and
[2:12:29] and nobody was playing and then after
[2:12:33] thereafter after dad and that's when I
[2:12:36] heard him and I said that's the music
[2:12:39] test that's how the music I heard it was
[2:12:43] his music so the Lord already he said he
[2:12:48] was going to trials and he's going
[2:12:50] through all this but the Lord was
[2:12:52] already come play for us so I just just
[2:13:01] wanna share those and I just want to
[2:13:04] thank you appreciate that you met
[2:13:18] anybody else
[2:13:29] god bless you Saints
[2:13:34] it's emotional
[2:13:37] you don't got me up Jason 2006
[2:13:43] and I had been making trips off to New
[2:13:45] York helping my brother you know I doing
[2:13:49] something you know trips out to
[2:13:51] Dominican Republic that wouldn't work
[2:13:52] all these other places I know you and
[2:13:57] you the Lord was dealing with me because
[2:14:00] there was a void in my life
[2:14:02] that just couldn't be filled I had the
[2:14:05] love of my husband my family but there
[2:14:09] was just the point nothing made me happy
[2:14:11] anymore
[2:14:13] I knew that that time was coming and I
[2:14:17] also knew that my brother evil had been
[2:14:20] praying for me since like 1980 something
[2:14:23] that I would come serve the Lord I
[2:14:27] remember the day that I got baptized
[2:14:29] there were seven of us that got baptized
[2:14:31] only one planned baptism but I know as
[2:14:36] we came back for the second service I
[2:14:39] really you know I went up and I said
[2:14:40] okay in fact everybody had left the
[2:14:42] church everybody had left the church and
[2:14:45] they wind up calling everybody back
[2:14:47] because I decided that I was gonna get
[2:14:49] baptized so they filled up the tank and
[2:14:51] all that
[2:14:52] all I know is that five followed after
[2:14:55] that and there was a total of seven of
[2:14:58] us and I remember my brother he bought
[2:15:01] um you know I think that you know we
[2:15:04] never had to talk about the Baptism and
[2:15:07] everything and he had told me right when
[2:15:11] I had gotten into the baptismal he says
[2:15:13] Doris he says do you know what you're
[2:15:15] doing and I looked at him and I says I
[2:15:18] know that I'm not turning back I said
[2:15:21] there's no turning back even I know that
[2:15:24] so to make a long story short all these
[2:15:27] years have gone by in this last year it
[2:15:36] was trying to take care of my parents
[2:15:38] trying to do the right thing and God
[2:15:41] knows the look that I have for my
[2:15:43] parents because this has been going on
[2:15:47] for years with their care and I remember
[2:15:52] them and I believe it was like in
[2:15:55] January or December I got to the point
[2:15:58] where I just knew we couldn't do it
[2:15:59] anymore
[2:16:00] I was really battling and um and called
[2:16:04] brother Samuel few times and talked to
[2:16:06] him about it and everything cuz you know
[2:16:07] you want to know in your heart that
[2:16:09] you're doing the right thing and it's
[2:16:11] not the devil trying to talk you out of
[2:16:12] doing things you know and so um I called
[2:16:17] my brother he won and I said I can't do
[2:16:19] it anymore my heart wants to do it but
[2:16:22] my body's not like me do and you know I
[2:16:25] wind up going through high blood
[2:16:27] pressure I lost a tremendous amount of
[2:16:28] weight I mean oh that's any other time
[2:16:30] I'd be ecstatic I wasn't weak but when
[2:16:33] you're losing weight and you don't know
[2:16:34] why you're losing it you know it's not a
[2:16:36] good feeling you know because you know
[2:16:38] you're becoming sick so anyway um I you
[2:16:42] know my brother Yvonne I called them and
[2:16:44] I said I can't do it anymore he says
[2:16:45] well Doris he says you know
[2:16:48] then you know if I bring mom here then
[2:16:50] the other siblings you know um they
[2:16:53] won't be able to see mom they'll have to
[2:16:55] come down here and Isis law I don't know
[2:16:56] at this point I don't know what to tell
[2:16:58] you but you know mom's been living with
[2:17:00] me for a year nobody's come to see her
[2:17:02] so you know am I supposed to stopping
[2:17:05] everything I'm doing right now to
[2:17:06] consider them I said I can't I says
[2:17:08] because I can't take the risk of putting
[2:17:10] myself in the hospital and my children
[2:17:13] having to take care of me because I'm I
[2:17:15] suffered from a stroke or a heart attack
[2:17:17] or something so anyway um you know
[2:17:21] you've all agreed to take mom and I
[2:17:23] asked the Lord I said Lord if it's meant
[2:17:26] to be then mom if it's in your will that
[2:17:29] mom be with my brother you know with
[2:17:31] your son they don't allow everything to
[2:17:33] happen the way it's supposed to happen
[2:17:35] everything goes smoothly what you did so
[2:17:38] when it she came when I came back from
[2:17:41] New York I stayed seven days because I
[2:17:43] wanted to make sure she was adjusted and
[2:17:45] everything was gonna go okay I told her
[2:17:47] make my flight so I could change it if
[2:17:50] she's not adapting well then I'll stay
[2:17:52] longer you know because I was determined
[2:17:54] I wasn't gonna leave her if she wasn't
[2:17:56] happy so everything went smoothly
[2:17:59] everything I couldn't have asked for a
[2:18:01] better day
[2:18:01] you know her better week and everything
[2:18:04] went smoothly and I came home and it was
[2:18:06] like I couldn't I didn't even know what
[2:18:08] to do with my life
[2:18:12] I'm not complaining because I gave them
[2:18:15] everything I possibly cook but I did III
[2:18:20] knew in my heart that I did everything
[2:18:22] that I could but then I came home and I
[2:18:25] didn't know what to do with my life and
[2:18:28] I went to see my follow up with my
[2:18:30] doctor and he said Doris he sucks you
[2:18:32] know um how you been feeling and I said
[2:18:36] and I was crying
[2:18:43] sometimes I feel like I gotta go back to
[2:18:45] school or go get a job just to get my
[2:18:48] life started and he looked at me and he
[2:18:51] said Dorsey says lay back he says I'm
[2:18:53] gonna be your psychiatrist today he says
[2:18:55] and I'm wasn't gonna charge you
[2:18:56] he says but I'm thing you know he says
[2:18:59] going to get a job and going back to
[2:19:02] schools have been fix things he says
[2:19:04] your body needs rest he says you have to
[2:19:07] allow yourself to have some rest so then
[2:19:10] my husband had to go out for training up
[2:19:12] to Miami and the kids wanted me to go
[2:19:14] with him it was gonna be gone for two
[2:19:16] weeks I said that's a long time you know
[2:19:19] there was a time there Mark was taking
[2:19:21] me everywhere and I was gone you know
[2:19:23] week two weeks three weeks at a time and
[2:19:25] didn't think anything of it but have
[2:19:26] been so long since I had gone anywhere
[2:19:29] cuz I was afraid to go anywhere I didn't
[2:19:32] know if something was gonna happen the
[2:19:33] mom and I could get on a plane you know
[2:19:35] and get there on time you know so anyway
[2:19:38] um here I wound up going with him when
[2:19:40] I'm sitting there I'm sitting by the
[2:19:43] pole and I'm thinking to myself I says
[2:19:45] Lord how did I even get here how did I
[2:19:48] even get to this place Lord you know
[2:19:51] where I don't know what to do with my
[2:19:52] life and then I started thinking about
[2:19:54] how old I was it was four years ago you
[2:20:01] know where did four years ago I don't
[2:20:03] even know were four years
[2:20:07] but I think God because you know what
[2:20:09] you know the devil starts talking to you
[2:20:12] you know and you know you're a Miami
[2:20:14] Beach you know they've got all these
[2:20:16] bars and everybody you know jamming and
[2:20:18] everything else and I thought and that
[2:20:20] thought came to me there's no turning
[2:20:22] back there's no turning back 2006 I had
[2:20:35] told brother Samuel this a long time ago
[2:20:37] in 2006 I was so I was so lost in the
[2:20:43] world and I had been for so many years
[2:20:46] that when he told me from the ground he
[2:20:49] just pulled me from the ground he pulled
[2:20:51] me from the gutter
[2:20:52] he pulled me from the cover and when I
[2:20:55] think back and all the mercy you know
[2:21:00] and he gave me the faith gave me the
[2:21:02] hope to stand you know and I wonder how
[2:21:05] this last year I even made it through
[2:21:07] and I think to myself you know that was
[2:21:10] you God that was you you know and I
[2:21:14] thank God I thank God I think God for
[2:21:19] giving me the strength to stand even now
[2:21:21] you know and yes did I miss Thursday
[2:21:24] said I missed this but believe me I know
[2:21:27] where my heart was
[2:21:28] you know it was just rain sometimes you
[2:21:32] know and I'm just trying to find myself
[2:21:35] and it's like Lord you know without you
[2:21:37] without you I wouldn't be standing here
[2:21:40] you know and so you know I'm sitting
[2:21:43] there and I'm thinking to myself should
[2:21:44] I get with testimony or should I give a
[2:21:46] testimony shoot
[2:21:47] your show tonight because you know we
[2:21:49] all know that you give a testimony that
[2:21:51] was
[2:21:53] but you know what for me I owe all of
[2:21:57] you things and the Lord just because
[2:22:05] you know and and and to think that he
[2:22:09] brought that up back to me you know
[2:22:11] there's no turning back
[2:22:12] you know and it reminds me you know
[2:22:14] there's a reason there's reminders that
[2:22:17] come back at little things that happen
[2:22:19] you know and when I look back I was
[2:22:20] telling one of the sisters this morning
[2:22:23] I was telling you know that one of the
[2:22:27] biggest things that I think that I got
[2:22:30] get out of serving the Lord as how he's
[2:22:33] allowing me to look back at where I was
[2:22:36] for so many years so lost in the gutter
[2:22:40] and he reminds me he reminds me of where
[2:22:46] I was and where I am now and I thank the
[2:22:49] Lord for that I think I think there's
[2:22:52] just not enough thanks god is good he's
[2:22:58] so so so good anyone that ever prayed
[2:23:07] for me
[2:23:08] during this last year God knows thank
[2:23:11] you so much for your prayers and for
[2:23:13] keeping me with it's been wonderful to
[2:23:24] be here tonight give God thanks for all
[2:23:28] the beasts done I mean I remember I was
[2:23:31] just no brother to say he said sometimes
[2:23:33] the testimony service because sometimes
[2:23:35] God may not be doing something giant in
[2:23:37] your life right that at that moment but
[2:23:39] just seeing what God's doing in somebody
[2:23:41] else's life he's working in the body a
[2:23:43] man you can give God things you can
[2:23:45] rejoice but the same of the jebbie thing
[2:23:55] you were singing let's sing that song
[2:23:59] when I look round and see good things
[2:24:07] thus for me well I know
[2:24:10] [Music]
[2:24:16] but is blessings freely can't I own all
[2:24:24] my life to him I've got so much
[2:24:32] I've got and I've got so much they can
[2:24:38] for so much praise for will you see now
[2:24:43] he has been so good to me when I think
[2:24:52] what he's done and where that he broke
[2:24:57] me from I've got so much
[2:25:03] third verse I want to thank you I wanna
[2:25:07] thank him for letting me see this last
[2:25:11] state in time history and I know that my
[2:25:17] name is Oliver
[2:25:21] hold the seals they have been in it some
[2:25:27] may sue the body changeless I've got so
[2:25:31] much here for one more time I've got so
[2:25:37] much hand I've got so much thank you for
[2:25:43] so much rays
[2:25:48] yes being so good to me when I think one
[2:25:58] way
[2:26:03] oh this has been a wonderful time it's
[2:26:13] been a wonderful time amen
[2:26:16] I'm not gonna add to his testimony I'll
[2:26:18] wait and preach on it but you know the
[2:26:23] one thing I can tell you and I will say
[2:26:26] this right here is even in the midst of
[2:26:28] times of discouragement you still treat
[2:26:31] him as a son of God that's with
[2:26:34] everybody as a son of God and a daughter
[2:26:37] of God it's God that does the work and
[2:26:41] I'm so thankful to the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:26:43] I I know once said when I said I think
[2:26:49] I'm the happiest man in the world after
[2:26:51] last week and it wasn't just because of
[2:26:54] been you know I've been praying for Ben
[2:26:56] and we all both had a lot of many of you
[2:26:59] I think God I want to say this I really
[2:27:03] appreciate the discernment and the
[2:27:07] observation of the saints of God I
[2:27:12] really really appreciate that that
[2:27:14] touched me so much because what touch
[2:27:17] means that you could see it
[2:27:19] and you knew just take it to the Lord in
[2:27:22] prayer
[2:27:23] that's what touches me alone if ever is
[2:27:26] anything that I've strove for even in
[2:27:28] the gospel is that we take it to the
[2:27:30] Lord that's one thing I've strove for
[2:27:31] because he's the one that makes a
[2:27:34] difference in every situation and in
[2:27:36] every life well this got a little bit of
[2:27:40] juice on it Brian back this mind back a
[2:27:41] little bit I will close out on this
[2:27:45] we'll just ask a word of prayer and then
[2:27:46] Zack and I will sing a song and we'll
[2:27:48] will sing out of here so we come over
[2:27:51] here sometimes the boys they like coming
[2:27:53] over here with me sometimes and they
[2:27:55] come in here and they just have a jam
[2:27:57] session and they're up here singing and
[2:27:59] taking turns and of course acts up your
[2:28:01] singing - so we're just gonna sing I
[2:28:04] those of you know it was young people
[2:28:06] I'm not much of a practicer I just like
[2:28:08] to get up and sing I it makes me nervous
[2:28:10] when I think I have to sing a special or
[2:28:12] you know one time I had to sing at a
[2:28:14] wedding and then the brother said oh no
[2:28:16] bro Sammy you got to take it up right
[2:28:17] here and let it down right here that
[2:28:19] right there I'll guarantee I get that
[2:28:21] messed up when I go to sing that special
[2:28:23] just let me sing it how I sing it and
[2:28:26] they're matter-of-fact just let me just
[2:28:28] get up and just sing it I don't even
[2:28:29] need to practice it
[2:28:31] not that I'm good I just makes me
[2:28:33] nervous you know it just it just does
[2:28:35] but I know that I just so appreciate
[2:28:37] what the Lord is doing in our midst I I
[2:28:40] just love the Lord and I'm just so
[2:28:43] thankful
[2:28:43] amen I'm grateful to God amen for for
[2:28:47] his children I'm just glad to be a part

[2:29:11] I feel and I mean that with all my heart
[2:29:13] that's why I said as a happiest man
[2:29:15] because of what God is seeing God
[2:29:18] answering prayers and when I was just
[2:29:19] praying you know
[2:29:20] with different needs and things like
[2:29:22] that that we've been praying for and I
[2:29:24] just see God just come on the scene and
[2:29:26] you know what a testament I could go on
[2:29:28] and on but we we I don't want to do that
[2:29:31] we'll know that it'll spill over and
[2:29:33] some of the messages to come but I just

[2:30:01] all my heart so Zack and I are gonna
