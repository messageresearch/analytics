we'll God in our midst Lord I pray father we give you thanks Lord and praise Lord we love you we commit ourselves Lord into your hands for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you would let's turn to Deuteronomy chapter 1 I don't want to read a few verses of Scripture before we let you be seated tonight let's begin at verse 21 remember the setting of this scripture Moses is speaking to the new generation and it is very is at the time of preparing them to cross over and he's revisiting some of these important points with them in verse 21 he says behold the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee go up and possess it as the Lord God of thy father's hath said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged now Moses is recording he's recalling what he spoke at the beginning because you see God cannot and will not change his word his word doesn't have to be modified whatever that God has spoken he will fulfill so it's not a new promise it's bringing now the promise that has been made into effect so he's revisiting this and he came near unto me every one of you and said we will send men before us and they shall search us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall come and the saying pleased me well and I took 12 men of Yueh one of a tribe to us and brought us word again and said it is a good land which the Lord our God does give us notwithstanding you would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God and he murmured in your tents and said because the Lord hated us he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Emirates to destroy us whether shall we go up our brethren have discouraged our heart saying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are great and walled up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakin's there I want you to watch this what what we've just read here from verse 27 because the Lord hated us he brought us forth out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand to the hammerites to destroy us that's a lie that is a lie now you tell me where they get the influence to say this about God they didn't get it from God they got it from demons that came to attack the word it is an outright lie so how do you compare a lie how do you combat a lot you've got to come at it with truth so here Moses picks up in verse 29 then I said unto you this is what Moses said even during this time dread not neither be afraid of them the Lord your God which goeth before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness where thou has seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee as a man doth bear his son and all the way that you went until you came into this place may the Lord add his blessing to the word as you're being seated I like to speak to you tonight just on a thought and opening upon this here victory over discouragement Satan's tactics have never they haven't changed he still uses the same tactics today that he that he used even in the beginning and it's something that we need to look at and be mindful of that Satan cannot overthrow the Word of God he's never overthrown the Word of God in any generation there's been people that he's overthrown but he's never overthrown the word because if Satan could defeat the word he'd be able to defeat God because God is the word so we recognize that within it that you know when we look at this God is not a man that he should lie nor a son of man he should repent he never has and he never will have to take back one word but we know that God has never he's never miss spoken he's never had an oops moment but everything that God has said he will fulfill it the only thing that God needs is that there would be people who would be believers that he can then improve his word through believers and every word that God proves through believers it's a paradox because it's the Almighty God proving his word through flesh now I want you to look at this tonight when we look at it these people that were looking at they had brought an evil report against the promise of God they were looking at the opposition instead of the God who made the promise and you know when they made a statement that they said that he hates us that's a lie he brought us up here in the wilderness to destroy us that's a lie when you see there there comes a moment where within the discernment you've got to be able to discern that and withstand that and call him a lie I don't care where it's coming from it's just like when Jobs stood there and after Jobe had faced everything his wife remember that Satan had said I will call job to curse you to your face and here the Satan had moved in and his wife no doubt was so discouraged and so distraught she said why don't you discuss God and I but say but joged was able to discern that that wasn't really his wife but that was an evil spirit because he said you speak like a foolish woman he was able to recognize that you see there was all sorts of things that was coming at him to discourage him and here tonight with in every within every one of us that's here whether it's been previous days today or coming days we will always have to battle discouragement discouragement is something that has the people of God we are always faced with you'll find where there's always an position and an obstacle that will always come and it will always try to attack the promised notice all the way through the journey it wasn't until they got to this place that when he sent people over to spy out the land that those people came back with an evil report and they said we're not able to go up and take the land and the Scriptures recorded right here what actually took place is by the things that were being spoken by these men it actually discouraged the heart you see Satan cannot overthrow the word but if he can somehow bring discouragement in the heart he's got you it's just like when it comes to any promise whether it's for healing deliverance the Holy Ghost whatever the promise is that God has made that the Lord is dealing with your heart he'll try within every measure to try to discourage you you see it even within the prophets life he tried to come at the prophet and discourage him how many times that brother Branham said then he said I'm going off the field one time he was going off the field because they were making him God then brother Brandon came back around again and then after the opening of the seals he makes known to us he said I've got discouraged and I said I wasn't going to preach the gospel no more I had developed a complex because he said people it seemed like people weren't listening to me you think but you think the devil don't fight the ministry but devil will fight you as well the devil will get you looking at all sorts of things that if you look at all the negative and you look at everything else well what about this and what about that let me tell you something that will never bring faith to your life but if you can look to the Lord who made the promise he will give you a good courage that you yourself will be able to have victory over discouragement the salmon are you telling me there's times I'm not going to be down I never said that that's not what we're talking about within the word but there is a way my prayer and my heart's desire tonight of what God is so laid on my heart for weeks is that there wouldn't be that of an armament you would be able to take from here and be able to stand toe-to-toe with level right here tonight and in every other day that he comes along your way and be able to discern it and call him what he really is a liar he is a liar now I want you to watch this they spoke evil against the promise of God but God will always fulfill his word by his spirit now as they came back and they discouraged the people and you know when we look at it you see God in fulfilling his word God is not calling for our people within this place that would be such a mighty people within themselves that's not what God needs all God requires is faith if thou canst believe all things are possible that's all God needs is faith and you know what God realizes that it's impossible for you and I just to have faith within ourselves so God Himself will move in such a way in your life in a service in your personal life to build faith in Him for the promise you see all of these things they are to be accumulated in our heart the things that God has done for you and I have the testimonies and what God has done don't leave them scattered loosely as though they are loose events they are not loose events they are happenings and spiritual happenings of the Lord that you are to accumulate in your heart and whereby your faith is built in him for the promise now watch this here Satan's desire is always to try to discourage you'll get you focusing on the wrong thing who calls you to focus on everything that's going wrong this is not going right and this and that and pretty soon see what you're focusing on is what you'll talk about and what you talk about shows what you've been thinking on shows what's in your heart and pretty soon you've got such an atmosphere of doubt and everything that's all around if you could look at it in your home it's cloudier and greyer then the skies are in Ohio there's all sorts of things that are around there's no sunshine that's going forth whatsoever why you're occupied with discouragement but let me tell you something God's Word cannot be defeated and God will see his word through now watch this how the scripture portrays and lets go into this here in just a little bit in numbers 13 here if I can just move through a few places here in the scripture I want you to watch the happenings of where when they actually come back into the camp and we break into this time that Moses is calling their attention back to remember when they went over into the land the Bible tells us in numbers 13 2010 it was the time of the first ripe grapes to appear so now there is fruit that is present in the land that they would be able to bring back and they did bring back that land the Bible tells us in verse 33 that they cut down from fence a branch from one cluster of grates and they bare it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs so they were not want and blaah of there being fruit in the land but remember in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established there was grapes there was pomegranates there was figs that was there that they had actually brought back now I want you to watch this in the word these buncha Liars what they said they made a statement here later in in the word as they were recording their event and they said that this is a land that eateth up the inhabitants liars that was not the truth they were actually holding what was the truth but yet they themselves lied God's Word had already been declared so what's happening they're liars they're telling lies and by the people who are there that are entertaining these lies you know one thing they should have done they could have went right to Moses and Aaron and said you know what here's what's happened but instead the Bible says they went to Moses and Aaron and before the whole congregation you see Satan just did not want to come at Moses and Aaron it would have stopped right there it would have ceased right there but because God allowed listen to me now God allowed it to be that way that the whole congregation the tribesman and then they would hear this and all of a sudden you find a murmuring you find a weeping you find a moaning that moves through the heart of the people why is that they are discouraged who discouraged them did god discourage him no Satan had discouraged them how did Satan discourage them by telling them lies now watch this here when you look at this the Bible goes on to tell us that even they not only bearing V&B a fruit but they even said in themselves surely the land floweth with milk and honey in verse 27 they also went on to say that the people the Strela in the land they're very strong and the cities are walled up and very great but I want you to notice the Bible in verse 30 it said in Caleb steeled the people before Moses this was necessary the word steal here means to be silent it's a commandment shut up it's a commandment stop talking you knew Caleb represented he represented the tribe of Judah the Lion of Judah was roaring out if the lion was roaring it was telling the rest of them shut up the lies that's been told down through the ages the Lion of the tribe of Judah has roared in this hour and said shut up it's lies lies oh my so here Caleb as he stands here he begins to make known and we see how that these men would may even make a statement and say all the people in verse 32 all the people that we saw in the in in in it in that land are men of great stature liars that's a lie there was none of this the truth did they see people of a nakum yes but it was not all giants lies and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers they were not grasshoppers another lie but in their own site you see what it is is lies now now look within this you and I are looking back in the scripture and looking over this but you see they didn't need a Bible to know this was a lie come on they didn't need a search program to know this was a lie they didn't need to have a phone that had access to the message in that hour what they needed is to meet the God face to face who made the promise of that hour and when they met that God face to face they had faith that that God would fulfill what he said he would do are you with me but instead of it here they are in the midst of it and they're entertaining this they're taking all this in they're listening to it their reasoning they've got imaginations you know when these guys when these guys begin to speak we were like grasshoppers every one of them knows the power within these words you know your words got power your words will either bring faith or they'll bring doubt in your home that's why it's very important that your language should not be a negative language there's many of you maybe you never even cussed in your life and there's many of us then maybe God God has taken that right out of our life but yet still within the midst of the time to talk negative the Prophet identified that is the devil's language we are never to be entertained as a matter of fact brother Graham said when you go to saying I got little faith he said don't say that he said you say I've got great faith you see we're not lying we're testifying according to the truth of God's Word oh my if you let it be this circumstances that's all around you can discourage you O Muhammad watch how that here within the midst of it this is being dismantled this evil report that has come up into the land now I'll think about this here in the Bible has it has it records here's a testimony and witness this is the fact sheet this is his this is Satan's facebook profile in John chapter 8 the Bible says that like this he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it so what is Satan he's a liar when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own it originated every lie originated was Satan glory be to God so he's a liar and on the basis I want you listen to me now he's a liar and on the basis of the word confirmed by the Spirit we can take Satan right back to the word and stand there because God's Word cannot fail I want you to watch what David and David place a few of these parts for us in Psalms 119 verse 160 thy word is true from the beginning and every one of that righteous judgments endureth forever in Psalms 12 verse 6 the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of Earth purified seven times what is pure the words of the Lord now think of this as we look on here in Psalm 62 in Psalm 62 verse 1 here is here is the text that the Prophet would take for that of the message Shalom and I want you to look at where we're at we're in the time of a closing out of civilization in the time when the day star itself has been born within our hearts it is there is declaring within our hearts there is a new day rising on the scene are you with me so the notice for us in this hour if you've been born of the Spirit of God it is Shalom the light of God has entered into your life and we are dwelling in Christ but all outside of that woe is the darkness that is upon the earth now watch how David says this in verse 1 truly my soul waiteth upon God truly not fictitiously not deceitfully true my soul waiteth upon God so there is a true expectation from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved how long will you imagine mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowling wall shall be and as a tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from his Excellency do you realize the demon spirits that have been congregating all the way down through time do you realize what they have sought to do is to tear him down from this excellency they wanted to hand the church titles at a Trinitarian doctrine of that is absolutely inspired from hell and have want to diminish the very name of the Lord Jesus Christ that wanted to take it away as though he's just a base thing as though he was just a good man but notice within all of this they want to remove him from his Excellency let me tell you something go time's my change go darkness gets greater but yet God's Word cannot fail he's the same God tonight as he ever was to the real heart of a believer when Christ is seated there in the throne of that heart the excellency our God is dwelling there and to them every word is yay an amen glory be to God they only consult to cast down from his excellency now notice consult consult who they delight in lies they bless with their mouths but they curse inwardly this is the same thing the Pharisees did in that day their heart their mouth was near but their heart was far away their whole purpose was to tear him down do you realize that Satan Paul identifies this right in the gospel do you really think that the devil was going to try to keep people from trying from emerging in and trying to take the word and pull the word not at all even where John himself would identify by the Spirit of God beloved he said try every spirit are you with me it was calling for discernment he said Nichols that Antichrist that you've heard of it is right now it's right among us he was identifying that spirit that was right among the church in that hour Paul even told him as he called him together he said there's going to be Grievous wolves enter in after my departure and there's going to be men that'll rise up speaking perverse things we see this through the scripture that Satan's objective is he cannot listen he cannot dismantle the kingdom of God he cannot remove the Lord Jesus from the throne and from the fulfillment of the word but what Satan's objective is to try to do is to paint it full of lies and to make it seem in some way that he's not the same God that he doesn't keep his promise but let me tell you something he's still the same yesterday today and forever whatever he bit before his still do it today that yes his excellency his excellency is this power its nature its character revealed hmm my soul look what David goes on to say my soul wait thou only upon God notice this speaks of a word being preeminent for my expectation is from him aren't you looking for the next president no I'm looking for the King of glory hallelujah this kingdom it's overthrown every other Kingdom come on somebody this kingdom right here overthrew every other Kingdom this kingdom will continue to grow until every kingdom is delivered unto the Lord and His Christ his anointed he only who all of this he only is my rock and my salvation David what about your 401k no he only is my rock they've been what about you about the stock market no he only is my rock they've been what about no he he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense David what are you going to do when they put pressure he's my defense i shall not be moved in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times you people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us now let me tell you Caleb's filled the people that was necessary all of that that was going through the camp k-dubb stood up and silenced it I hope you're with me I trust you're born of that same line of the tribe of Judah you hear negative things you ought to rise up and say shut up come on somebody things are coming come on now it's time to call it in order we don't want his lives around amen we're not trying to whitewash things but the devil is the one that wants to sell people lives and tell them all sorts of things look at this he'll tell them they're okay and everything's going all right and then he'll turn around to the real children of God that are born of the Holy Ghost and he'll try to punch at you every day you'll try to come at you at different times he'll try to come at you in every little way to try to discourage you he'll try to is his best to come but notice within it all God stands true to his word I'd say it's very clear when brother Brown was asked a question brother Branham the devil keeps coming and telling me I'm not a Christian and brother Branham answered the individual and said now brother Branham you know what should I do brother Graham said now if your life it copes with the word now that's a very big statement that we could preach on that for the rest of the night you've got to see that every of your life copes with the word that means from your soul not your mouth not your head but from your soul your soul punctuates every word of God with a man if your soul can punctuate it with a name and not that you agree with it not that it's just casual not that it's just something you subscribe to but if he indeed is your life then you can stand there and absolutely take the opposite of what the devil is trying to say you see the devil is one of those as we said moments ago he'll tell other people you're okay you're all right and everything's fine and then he'll come around upon others and he'll try to wear them out but it's being able to discern the devil when we want listen friends when it comes down to it we've got to make here I my trust is only in the Lord that very opening Scripture that very first scripture in Psalm 62 speaks and is the Ministry of the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost truly my soul trusts in God nothing else it's not resting in a sensation it's not resting because of this it's not now he alone is my rock no but Rose I know the message not because I believe brother man is a prophet no he alone is my rock truly my soul waiteth on the Lord glory be to God so someone has got to stand on the word and call the devil a liar that's the truth you see even when you look in this time here's Joshua and Caleb they're cutting their standing right there and calling the devil a liar you see in this hour what you think about this how many times you find it right through the tapes in the message how many times brother Branham will bring right back up and he'll bring up he said remember the first time when I went out what I preached before I left this Tabernacle those of you that listen to the message you know he says I always come back to that it was like during David meeting Goliath Goliath and dis hours making his boast but there's got to be some to go and meet him don't you don't you see God in this hour he came on the scene and he was vindicating his word oh my elder brother ramble say it over and over he said the pillar fire did not come because of me he said he came for us and he said he came by me he said because I was standing on the world of truth let me tell you something if we are standing upon that same word that same pillar of fire that accompanied and delivered this word that same angel of the Covenant it's here tonight he's here with us as the children of God to back up every word to back the devil off any hope that he might have and to be able to proclaim that every word of God is JN amen somebody's got to call him a liar sometimes it has to be the pastor to do it sometimes it's got to be you to do it come on somebody sometimes you've got to do it right in your home that's enough that's a lie were you talking about me no I'm talking about you I'm speaking to that spirit come on somebody this for recognize we are dealing with demon spirits that would love to try to affront and to come into the home and try to attack the Word of God but as children of God that have access to his name let him stand right there with the token apply as they Satan you're alive you have no place here [Applause] we're living in a different time so what God is still God and God ain't altering his promise he don't got to change it to make it a more easier read he don't got to do it so it becomes a more cool hit thing and people can understand it better if it's wrote in a different way nope he himself who gave the word and deliver the word it's here to reveal the word as a matter of fact the Prophet tells us in the seals how Satan sly and slick deceptive manner he said there's absolutely nobody that can outdo him but the holy go this is where Paul could have such a confidence within the revelation that had been delivered through him he said if any man in him any angel from heaven you see where Paul's bringing it down he said I don't care if it's an angel from heaven I don't care if it has all these signs and the hands and all this other stuff can go on and whatever more I don't care if it is contrary to this gospel let him be accursed Paul said I don't care who they are Paul even put it to himself he said though we Paul said if I would happen to go astray don't you drift from this revelation let him be a curse but you see as we said moments ago remember any any Kingdom or country has spies in it we've got spies from other nations here and we've got spies from our nations in their country spies and Satan has spies Satan spies are to come within the word and to try to take from us the promises that belong to us try to make it out as though it's just for a day gone by you know God really don't move like that now God used to move like that before Biddy don't move like that now Satan spies will come along and tell people well you know it God really looks on your heart he does but what's in your heart will reflect on your body if your hearts not right with God it'll show outwardly and he will tell people well you know it really don't matter where you go to church that you know just as long as you go to church that's another lie it's all of these things of how that the devil himself will try to present lives notice he's not going to try to take the word on inner in and in a way from the people but he's going to give them this interpretation on it so that when they accept his trepidation they themselves have actually been removed from the original gospel by Satan's lies and let me tell you something Satan spies are not born of the truth they are transplanted or they are planted or crept in and the whole objective listen to me now do you realize that these men do not even realize that they are deceived themselves Paul tells us in the book of a first Timothy he said they are deceiving and being deceived and the end their end will be destruction according to the deception that they themselves have been ministering and be under I'll tell you what it's important in this hour to be under the truth it's important to abide within the truth and the real reality of the doctrine of Jesus Christ I'll tell you even other lies that's come around here especially over the last few years and seem to be prominent it's rare that people feel I can somehow that they don't need to go to church no more they'll just stay home and get it from the horse's mouth that's a lie from the pits of hell that is nothing that the Prophet ever thought it's us in stand in the scripture it is not according to the original gospel it is not the truth it is a lie whom I think of this Satan's spies surely you all don't believe that Satan would say oh the message of the hour I couldn't get around that no he follows where truth is remember if he can't keep you from it he'll try to push you beyond it this is where that the Bible had these men and women brothers and sisters the Bible records it in revelations chapter 2 that they themselves had tried them which said they were apostles you know an apostle is one who is sent right one who is sent so they were they were saying they were apostles you know what they were saying they were saying that they themselves were actually sent by God but if they were sent by God remember the Bible says how can they preach and let they be sent and Jesus said as the father has sent me so send I you and there was proved out in that hour that these men were not apostles they found them to be liars I wonder how long it took them before they finally found them as liars they found it where these men were not staying true to the gospel that Paul had preached they begin to twisted they begin to move it in some manner but the elect of God not by their intuitiveness not by their smartness not by having a paragraph here and here and having their smartphone in church and looking it up they would know it by the characteristic that these this ministry is trying to do away with the very deity of Jesus Christ it will your honor was doing it was trying to remove holiness from the people and the Prophet takes this exact scripture and he said these people for them holiness was not a phrase it was a way of life and he said because it was a way of life with them they could spot and they tried these individuals by the word that Paul had given and they found him to be last you know what that was that was the true Church of the Living God remaining holiness unto the Lord now you think about it in your life in my life and for you and I remaining holiness unto the Lord if there is anything that comes our way that does not dovetail with the word and hold up the Word of God the Prophet tells it just like this he said let it be a liar if someone would tell you that you've got a right to be baptized in the name of the Father and Son and Holy Ghost let him be a liar to you he said if someone tells you it's all right to Bob your hair and things like that yaller wear a hat in church for a bonnet to be a covering you let him be a liar to you for the word of God is the truth any of these things that's against the word let it be alive let it be alive just that's it it's a life so this is our holiness unto the Lord you say holiness is much deeper although I believe in a real holiness in our dress the way that we conduct ourselves the way that we dress ought to be holiness unto the Lord the way that we're at - they have the garment on the inside of our life it ought to be holiness unto the Lord and the way that we have so reserved ourself has the sacredness of the bride of Jesus Christ that we are reserved only unto Christ alone that our life our mind our body all of that is reserved for him and his word my hands were reserved to praise the Lord I might have to work I might have to do different things my eyes might have to you know read certain things but the reality my life upon this earth was meant to serve the Lord it was meant to reflect the glory of God it was made to manifest God in this generation it was made to be a tabernacle where the Holy Ghost himself would dwell and reflect his same nature his Excellency would be reflected through my life my life was not meant to be my own my life was meant to be alive that was served for his purpose this is holiness unto the Lord think of this here the dove of God on the inside leading us Romans three three four what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect god forbid yay let every let let ye and let God be true but every man a liar let God be true but every man alive notice 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 verse 18 notice but as God is true I love this as God is true our word towards you was not yaen named for the Son of God Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us even by me and Sylvanus and timotheus was not yay and nay but in him was yay let me just ask you what if you were going to a church that they would tell you you know what this promised God don't really he don't care about this or more what if they told you that and you went to a church well how do you know this really don't apply no more how could you have faith that God will keep the other part of his words you see faith is based on the Word of God and if you're going to tell me that one word all that still don't apply to this day then you have been able to extract and cut away a part of God then what what makes it so that you'll keep the rest of his word can't you see that this is what Satan if he can take one little point in the word and put a question over it he has got you dismantled but God's desire is we're by his Spirit to so breathe upon his word just so move through our life so we're in discouragement would want to come the breath of God moving in our life will absolutely dismantle discouragement sometimes people don't even realize when they're discouraged you understand what I just said some people don't even know when they're discouraged they're so caught up with everything that's wrong but the reason they don't recognize their discouragement is because they're right and they don't realize that that discouragement has so ate upon them in such a way that they're lifted up in pride and they don't realize that's discouragement you're actually discouraged but you see we need to understand God's Word is true notice this Paul goes on to say for all the promises of God in him are yay and in him Amen unto the glory of God by us first Timothy 4:1 the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron now watch this this is conditions you see where these conditions are at these conditions are in the same place it was with the children of Israel we're fixing to break over into that Millennial day where is Satan all along and where is he sought he didn't he didn't seem you know right there within each if he came against him but notice a mixed multitude came out and all the way through the wilderness journey but then it comes to this place and he wants to discourage this place this is what the message was all about are you with me this is what it was all about and yet he's coming to try to bring discouragement you see the message never come so we'd have churches there is a result and a necessity of that are you with me there was a need for that but that was not so that we would have churches like the rest of the churches that was not the purpose of the message coming or so that we would have something different to preach but the coming of that message was bringing us back into that place that God had intended from the very beginning all of the types and shadows that was hidden that showed that God's desire was to bring us back to himself that you and I have a body that is waiting on us on the other side come on somebody there is a wedding supper to press for there is a millennium there is a future at home but gave heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils notice what's watch in this hour in Revelation 19 the Bible speaks of the bride of how it was granted unto us to be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints verse 9 it says write blessed are they which are called under the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God amen this message is not the ideology of man you understand friends Peter Ricker Peter recognized within that hour P was there to the Jews Paul was given that ministry unto the Gentiles which was hidden in the covenants back there and this was open to Paul and his Paul would minister these things remember the Jews had a hard time with understanding this but remember what Peter told him he said there are people who are unlearned and they are wrestling to their own destruction things that Paul said that's hard to be understood let me just say it to you like this when the God gave his prophet in this hour you see God gave to us eyes it was not the eyes of William Branham looking at the scriptures but it was God's thoughts that were being made known to you and I concerning the Word of God in this hour I tell you what you know what it does it opens up the Bible and makes the Bible become a new book the blood the Bible is no longer a closed book but let me say this to you without the Holy Ghost the message is still closed the Bible is still closed but with the Holy Ghost in your life it becomes open and you recognize and see the real purpose and the real meaning of his coming in this hour right blessed are they I'll tell you're blessed tonight you've had a divine invitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb let me tell you something you're just not on the guest list you are the reason there is a marriage supper hello yeah you were the one in whom it was made in mind all the little doilies on the table all the little fixtures that are reminders of the remnants of God's divine grace it was all been set aside oh ma what color is it that the bride loves the bride loves that blood the bride loves that one and that pureness it is all been set there by the Lord Himself and even as we sit there at the marriage supper of the Lamb it will be a memorial that is reset there we overcame in this life by the bread and by the wine that was served to us by our milk incident the Lord Jesus Christ it will be a time of communion there because right here when you stand and take communion here you're a testimony the Lord's coming and what's coming I am a witness that he's coming as long as you do this you do shew the Lord's death till he come you show that his death was not just a happening it was for you you show I was I was the reason he came and Annie and he came and he's come in me and because he came and he came in me he's coming back for me for here with me he came the corporal body ascended back up sent back the Holy Ghost and now that the Holy Ghost have been accepted in the Holy Ghost I will also be received in that place that we has reserved to meet you and I hey there is an appointed place for you now I'm telling you these are not the sayings of a man these are the true sayings of God how do you fight Satan's lies truth revelations 21 you okay they gonna be much longer revelations 21 even as he he sees the New Jerusalem descending from God they're out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband in verse 5 and he that said upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said write for these words are true and faithful you know the Bible says I believe it's isaiah 42:5 it says he will not he will not cease he will not be discouraged until he has accomplished do you realize he's had much to be discouraged about how many times were maybe we've looked beyond things we've missed certain things or we've let down on this and had to be corrected there but do you realize he's looking at his word and because listen now because he's looking at his word that's why you correct us that's why he'll chasing us that's why he'll rebuke us you won't know what he's doing he is breaking a lie that would like to try to hold back from us the truth that belongs yes well this is a such a hard hour to raise children in our children that's a lie but some you say in any in a hard hour I'm saying you're looking at the wrong thing I'm saying God is still greater than any devil God is greater than any circumstance I don't care there's a lot more pitfalls there's a lot more temptation remember brother Ram tells us he said with you would go to start telling he said your children your temptations you had he said they'd laugh at you because what they face is much greater now but it's still the same devil and there's one antidote and there's one remedy for the devil and that is the Lord God Himself God didn't give us a word he gave us himself to fight the devil with come on somebody program tells us he said that fire chief from Louisville he said you had this little guy down here spray a little bit there he said that dad from Louisville came down he said he said he got they parked for her he said before they'd even part the latter started going up he said he was already ascending on that ladder you know what he was doing he was addressing the need himself and Miliband tells us he said on the day of Pentecost he did not give the church a word he gave the church himself by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he gave them himself and in this hour he has given us himself these are the true sayings of God wrap these sayings they are true and faithful that shall be a rapture these sayings are true there are overcomers these sayings are true he's still a healer these things are true he's still a deliverer these things are true he still feels what the Holy Ghost these sayings are true it's true sayings overthrowing the doctrines of the devil your knots doing is taking out all the names of bail out of a mouth and it's putting in the name of ISA he shot my husband my lord come on somebody this is where that Paul would say let the word of Christ you with me let the word of Christ dwell in you richly that means abundantly let the word of Christ you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will you abide in the word you draw strength from the word you gotta meet your enemy day in and day out you got a meeting when you come here just because you come into the church don't mean you made it he could throw your attitude often in such a way because of this or because of that and you miss everything it's the enemy you've got to start recognizing and calling him a liar let the word dwell in you richly in all wisdom this is why in your heart and life we want to pray God reveal yourself to me these things even when we leave out of even as we're sitting and listening to the word even when we leave out of this service tonight Lord reveal your word to my heart make it more real to me Lord father the things I'm hearing what I'm reading I want it to dwell in me in all wisdom you know what all wisdom is wisdom allows in the house what wisdom is the Bible says in the book of Proverbs our wisdom was with him in the beginning Zara's our wisdom was there that said to the sea you can't come no more my wisdom was there when they put them out do you know what wisdom does to the word it puts the word in position and you in position it will also stop the encroachment of the enemy it will discern him in his tactics and you say brother Samuel my mind can't remember everything that's not what I'm talking about I'm not talking about an earthly wisdom I'm talking about a supernatural power on the inside you have the excellency of the Most High dwelling on the inside in the Treasuries of your soul his word is there so how are we supposed to do this teaching and admonishing one another that we're teaching is instructing and monning means exhorting hey brother come on we got a rapture to meet come on let's start watching hey let's start watching what we're doing but notice how you two do this in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs now this don't mean that you go up to the brothers say hey brother shame you need to watch what you doin son they didn't want to say it you know what a song is God told Moses write the words of this in a song you know a song somebody can play a melody it's got a name that tune you name that tune you've got the words to it come on somebody they get struck a little chord you'll finish the rest of the song you go out of McDonald's you're still on the old Lord Jesus forgive me how to one sing that song Lord the words going through your mind you recognize what it is that our lives provoking one another and to love and good works it should just be a little something that drops name that tune and you can take it the rest of the way you know the song whew that was good Lord you know the rest of the song you know the name that tune locked hey we need to watch how we're dressing watch how your little girls dress and what's a little boys dressing what's how this is going watch how this and you see what happens we know the rest of the tune and if you don't know the rest of the tune guess what the composer the instructor is here and for those who are singing that song they might be able to help you learn that song you have been saying ah no no no no wrong key wrong key well Bram tells us this is why we need to be careful what we're feeding on what we're listening to he talked about how that he was on his way to drop off Rebecca at school the kids and on the radio there came this program that was wanting to explain how creation was formed and lay all this scientific evidence in Bodrum says I I he said I came out he said in I realized he said it was Satan just trying to punch it me he said I came out and dropping Rebekah off to school he said I got back in the car and I watch I started to turn it back on he said but then I'll thought I'll get into that same stuff again so I turned it off you see first of all he recognized I don't need that junk they can say what they want to say on their YouTube channel I don't need that junk you understand we ought to be the Bible says keeping yourselves in the love of God praying in the Holy Ghost building up your most holy faith we don't entertain lies we we are lovers of the truth amen and the truth is not a doctrine it is the person of Jesus Christ for he said I am the way the truth and the life but a bantam says I turned it I turned it off can I read this to you he said I was going on up the street and Satan said to me said do you know that this man that you called Jesus was just a man like one day in his day like Billy Graham or Oral Roberts he was just a man that they begin a few people together around him and say he's a great man after a while he become greater and and then he become a God to him and and it scattered all over the world since he's dead and that's all and brother Graham said I thought how a liar you are got the point it may not be good grammar but you got the point how a liar you are that's the first thought but Samuel the devil's been talking me how do I know when he's lying nyng nyng nyng nyng nyng nyng nyng nyng nyng nyng nyng a naming he opened his mouth I thought how a liar you are and then I turned as I was crossing Graham Street and I said Satan you that's talking to my conscience you know brother Graham said don't let him stand in your conscience questions answer 64 he said don't let him stand in your conscience and punch at you I'd like to ask you a few things who was that the Hebrew prophet spoke of that would come who was that unknown in Messiah who was it upon those men who first saw him and told his life thousands of years before he got here he says who was it that it foretold just to the letter and when he come they said he was numbered with the transgressors he was wounded for our transgressions and he was he may one made his grave with the rich and he would rise up the third day and he did and then he promised the Holy Ghost and I've got it so you might as well get away from me because it's written in the word and every word is true then he left just give him the word that does it he can't spend that word for it's inspired no wonder David could say the word of the Lord has tried he's a buckler to all those that trust him some proverbs 35 every word of God is pure he's a shield unto them that put their trust in him Deuteronomy 33 29 happy our towel Israel who is like unto the old people saved by the Lord the shield of the help turned us down and who who is the who is the sword and the Holy Spirit revealed to her said I see what it is there's a lie that's been totally a black sheet that's been following you it's got your pastor and them all worked up he said and that was told to you by man that was professing divine healing he said what did he say sister don't pay no attention to them you know why it's a lie come on somebody you see paying attention to lives allows that sheet to follow you can see it here tonight poke poke poke poke come on somebody and the devil rules another time and said oh he's God on the mountain but he ain't God in the valley God said I heard that challenge I heard that challenge I'm just caught on the mountain and not God on the valley I proved to you that on God in the valley oh my if David himself think about it if David would have entertained what Goliath was saying Goliath was was saying a lot of stuff but every bit of it David tied it all together and said it ain't nothing but a lie because David said it what David what are you looking at look at his armor look at his spear look at his size David said I to an uncircumcised Philistine he don't got a covenant he don't got a God backing him up but I am a covenant you there's a covenant god I'm circumcised in the Covenant I've been anointed by God and that devil cannot stand before God's people David the luteal and stature had a great big God standing on the inside and stood there and called the devil a liar Shamgar got tired one day getting beat up he got fed up with it I know it might just be one little scripture in the Bible where he took an ox coat but you see there was a mystery written in his life and it was sealed up into this hour and the Prophet could go back there and say Shamgar he got to thinking one day when they got back time for them to Philistines and them to come up and take his crops he got to thinking I am a seed of Abraham I've got a covenant you know what he got to thinking on he got to thinking on who was behind him let me tell you something it's not a church backing but it's the backing of heaven by Almighty God himself this is where we are weapons of our warfare are not carnal but they're mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations bringing into captivity every thought into the obedience of Christ your allies there's a victory over discouragement I'm hot I told you I was coming down I want to get to this point right here you can look at Caleb and you could say Caleb how could you be so bold you ain't even in the land yet how can you be talking about a promise so sure that you you're not even in the land yet but you know what it was Caleb's heart was already in tune with God his heart was already in the land hallelujah he was speaking from his intellect he was speaking from his lips he was speaking from his heart if God be for us who can be against us I tell you what you know you know that devil can say well who are you to say that any promises yours you don't even have the Holy Ghost yet but you've got a rock to stand there and call the devil a liar and say the Holy Ghost belongs to me they mail it belongs to me God has vindicated his word to be the truth and not only that but you can look down in your life and see how God has dealt with your life where he is moved in your life where he has worked to dismantle holds of the enemy you can stand on the Word of God tonight and you can call Satan a liar I don't care the devil I don't care of all the doctors reports and everything else that's been said you're able to stand on the authority of God's Word and say Satan you're a liar let me tell you some what the preaching of the gospel does it dismantles Satan if you could watch right here let me tell you something I'm not just saying this right here I have a witness this and counseling sessions over and over again then right there where there would be such negative talk coming in I just can't or I this or I that and you say but the same and what did you do just wait it on him I'm as helpless as helpless can be y'all realize it ain't a lot of hate ain't like well there's been so many battle there been a lot of battles right back there in that room and a lot of em and where Satan himself has been warped by the Lord Jesus let me just be clear by the Lord Jesus and when it's been right there let me tell you something you can watch how that when the Spirit of God begins to move down I've watched it to where people that did not have seen like the faith more seemingly so far away from him and you watch the Spirit of God moved out and the Holy Spirit begin to give a word and then man I feel the stream is open I feel the opening you say what do you do I get right in that stream and allow the Holy Ghost who's doing the talking to keep on talking and you watch the very countenance of the person begin to change you know what's happening Satan's holds are being dismantled the lies that he has told it is being exposed he is being called a liar by the Holy Ghost that's the same way it isn't services Devils can be there upon you trying to discourage you keep you back where you've been prayed for for this and you've asked for this and you've this and you've met your end wants to do deflecting upon God but remember you can stand upon God's Word and say I'm a believer you know brother Ram says when you repent and are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said if you don't receive the Holy Ghost you may God a liar he cares to you 1963 but I believe that I'm speaking to believers I believe I'm speaking to believers in no sir God's Word is truth very nothing wrong with God's Word I know the same God that dealt with my heart the same God that drew me this far I know that same God will take me the rest of the way I am NOT one that calls him a liar I am one that proclaims the truth thy Word is truth o God you willing to fight for you he won't understand on it he's still God this is his word every word is yay and amen and me reminds you what brother bantam called the devil and what he called him we are witnesses of it I'm a witness he's a bluff he's a pervert err he's a vulture come on somebody he's a killer all of those things the devil he's an accuser you gotta call him out friends you gotta recognize when that devil he's doing the talking and doing the speaking you say brother Samuel what do i do you turn praise to God come on somebody don't go running tell somebody else you know what the devil's been telling me shut that thing up don't spread that thing through the cap but when that thing when it thoughts start coming you take it right back to the where and say thank you Lord Jesus that word is truth brother Samuel he keeps on coming then you keep on praising who told you that you were gonna have a vacation you're on a battlefield take unto you the whole armour of God every day because Paul said we wrestle not he didn't say we were drinking tea with him he said you wrestle not and you know what wrestling is brother Brahim uses the term he said you know you got to be able to break his toeholds well just call ignorant me I thought one day I thought what's a toehold I got what's a total you know I had the hardest time finding it until finally one little thing broke and you know what it is it's a hole where one would take a person's leg and bend it back and try to take their toe and move it out of joint to bring the person to submission Satan's desire is to try to wrestle you to submission and say I've had enough but remember greater is He that's in you it's up to you you can nurse it you can call you can sit there and entertain what he's saying you can spread it all around and say brother Samuel The Devil's beat me up and the devil's doing this and the devil's doing that and the devil's doing that who do you think is coming when you're talking like that or bro Samuel shouldn't let it but listen you're in an atmosphere of believers right here for goodness sakes don't leave out of here with that Saint fight upon you hey man let's be encouraged in the amen and call Satan a liar whatever the promise is whatever that God is dealt with your heart stand upon that word and you call Satan a liar let's pray Lord Jesus as I read in your word Lord I read upon the things Lord that your prophet has spoken Lord he spoken this manner in these words if I could just quote him he told us he said don't doubt if you doubt one bit you're not going to receive what you've come for but he says right now you got to come believing and come in the presence of God in the presence of the Holy Ghost that's here to confirm the word and come because that you know he's here and you know he will give you the desire of your heart that's what he's for here for is to give you the desire of your heart he goes on to say Lord if the enemy is trying to say you're too tired you won't get it tell him he's a liar tell him you're gonna get it tonight and I'm coming and I'm going to determine I'm going to get it tonight that's the way to do it father your word is true Lord in the foolishness of preaching you chose to save souls your God through the gospel being ministered power and demonstration Oh God it had nothing to do with how much a man can move around or sweat or how that he would change his voice that is not what it is at all every man is different in his makeup and has to be in Liberty to God but father the power in this demonstration of the gospel is the Holy Ghost taken that word and dismantling Satan's hold and his lives Lord God that he would want Lord to try to hold with in people's minds and in their lives lord I pray Heavenly Father I ask Lord in the name of Jesus Christ Lord God for your glory father I pray Lord right here tonight Lord that you administer Lord as you've done
