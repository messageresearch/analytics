[35:41] really love him amen the right way a
[35:45] love that my no matter what comes or
[35:48] goes it's an anchor in our lives it's
[35:51] something that no matter what what takes
[35:53] place no matter what mental battles no
[35:55] matter what situation there's an anchor
[35:59] that holds you and that's what Paul

[36:03] have through Christ Jesus our lord
[36:04] aren't you thankful for that love
[36:06] tonight amen it's an anchor that holds
[36:08] us it's beyond feelings it's beyond
[36:10] anything it's a reality that it just
[36:13] anchors in our heart and we we love him
[36:15] and you know what he's not a figment of
[36:17] our imagination he is the word amen he
[36:20] is the word he's the same yesterday
[36:23] today and forever and how thankful we
[36:25] are just to be Believers in this hour
[36:28] amen with God and His grace what he's
[36:30] done for us and what he's doing for us
[36:33] and we just so thank God for his mercy
[36:35] and I tell you tonight what an
[36:37] opportunity we have to be able to come
[36:39] into the house of God you know there's
[36:42] times that there's no doubt down through
[36:45] the scriptures there's different ones
[36:47] that they would have loved to had an
[36:50] opportunity and have that opportunity
[36:53] once again but you know in this
[36:56] sometimes in these moments we and have
[36:57] times in our natural Gatherings and
[37:00] we'll say man I wish we'd have done this
[37:02] oh man maybe the next time together
[37:04] we'll do this and man I forgot about
[37:06] this oh I forgot oh when you come back
[37:08] the next time but you know we're never
[37:11] promised even a next time within natural
[37:13] family gatherings Gatherings of friends
[37:16] but you know God knows this moment that
[37:18] we have even as as young people no
[37:22] matter what what our age is I want to
[37:24] say Lord let's take full advantage of
[37:27] the opport Unity that he's given us here
[37:29] tonight that he would come by our way
[37:31] and say Lord help me to just I want to
[37:33] draw from you what you see that I have
[37:35] need of tonight because you know God has
[37:39] come with a bag in store his medicine
[37:41] bag he knows just what we need and and
[37:44] so I believe God is going to take the
[37:47] gift in brother Trevor's life and move
[37:49] the man part to the side and speak to
[37:51] our lives I mean God's always on time he
[37:54] knows exactly what we have need of so
[37:56] let's just pull on the gift of God
[37:58] tonight God is mindful of every one of
[38:00] our needs and I'll just go ahead and say
[38:01] it like this we can go ahead and thank
[38:03] him right now for meeting all of our
[38:06] needs because he don't he don't have to
[38:09] go back to Calvary he don't have to
[38:10] raise again he's already done that he's
[38:13] done it all he's satisfied every debt
[38:15] he's satisfied for every need God let
[38:18] our eyes of Faith rise to that place to
[38:21] recognize it's already done it's already
[38:24] done don't you love him tonight amen

[38:44] of God I want to say we were not aware
[38:47] of how slick that was out there and then

[39:16] pray and you know just settling this way
[39:18] and say Lord will you know the needs

[41:51] I'm plugged into the
[41:55] HDMI there we that's nice nice
[42:00] wonderful so I'd like to take a title
[42:02] tonight of be strong and courageous so
[42:08] um before before having you stand and
[42:10] before we get to the scripture I just
[42:12] there's a quote that I it's too far back
[42:14] into my notes and I decided I really
[42:17] wanted to read it so I'm going to read
[42:18] this quote to you and then we can we can
[42:20] read the scripture just because I don't
[42:22] want to forget and I really want to read
[42:24] this quote so um from 55 uh 10:08
[42:28] brother Bram says the results of
[42:29] decision we're no longer in Egypt we've
[42:32] done pulled up our tent stakes and left
[42:34] come through the Red Sea the blood of
[42:36] the Lord Jesus seing all the old habits
[42:38] and things of Life drowned the task
[42:40] Masters that drove us through the
[42:41] barrooms and cocktail lounges and so
[42:43] forth and seeing all that drown like
[42:45] pharaoh and his horses and then now
[42:48] we're in the wilderness moving along
[42:50] following the angel of the Covenant the
[42:52] Holy
[42:53] Spirit and knowing that we're on our
[42:55] road to a great land that'll be here and
[42:58] during the days of the Millennium and
[43:00] we're going for that thousand years of
[43:02] Millennium Reign it's a type of the
[43:04] Thousand Years Reign on the earth with
[43:06] Christ three stages of the journey and
[43:10] we're ready now the church is in my
[43:12] opinion in the spiritual stand to enter
[43:15] on the third scene and that's the scene
[43:17] we're going to tonight in our text we
[43:20] found out they needed a healing well now
[43:23] they had a doctor with them which was
[43:25] Moses and that's not the quote that I
[43:27] wanted to read this is the quote that
[43:30] was a good quote too and we'll get into
[43:32] that this is the quote that I wanted to
[43:34] read so okay forgive me we've got too
[43:37] many people today saying yeah this is
[43:39] definitely the one it's too
[43:41] hard we can't do it we
[43:46] can it's harvest
[43:48] time that's the reason they got this big
[43:50] bunch of grapes and brought it back for
[43:52] evidence I can see Caleb and Joshua with
[43:55] that on their shoulders marching down
[43:57] through there just singing The Jubilee s
[43:59] song sure they have evidence they could
[44:01] prove that it was a good land they
[44:03] brought it back and give all the
[44:05] children a grape if they just wanted one
[44:07] off the one cluster just look what a
[44:09] bunch of grapes they
[44:10] had now Joshua and Caleb when they heard
[44:13] all of these these people
[44:15] murmuring the people saying oh it can't
[44:17] be done it can't be done Caleb run out
[44:19] in the midst of the people and quiet
[44:21] them said yes it can be Joshua stood by
[44:26] him said certainly can be God's given it
[44:28] to us amen I like that yes sir what was
[44:31] it they were positionally born in Christ
[44:33] they had a knowledge of the word and the
[44:35] word become manifested so look at where
[44:38] they're positionally born they have a
[44:40] knowledge of the
[44:42] word and they just kind of hung out no
[44:45] and the word become manifested now did
[44:48] the word become manifested before they
[44:50] had a knowledge no these things go
[44:53] together right remember every one of
[44:55] those Israelites had had the word of God
[44:58] preached to them but it only taken
[45:00] effect upon Caleb and Joshua to realize
[45:05] what it was all about so we can
[45:10] preach uh you know through the
[45:12] scriptures backwards and forwards and
[45:14] Moses preached to them backwards and
[45:16] forwards but only two of them realized
[45:20] what it was all about only two of them
[45:22] not only had the knowledge but let that
[45:24] knowledge become manifested
[45:27] in their life and so we want to we want
[45:30] to kind of talk about how things can be
[45:32] taking effect in our lives so if you
[45:35] don't mind you can stand with me we'll
[45:37] we'll get into our scripture that we
[45:38] want to read tonight from The Book of
[45:40] Joshua chapter
[45:42] 1 and we'll read verses 5 through
[45:46] 8 and I just went through uh much of
[45:49] this at the youth camp in Belgium that
[45:51] we've just returned from and we had a
[45:53] wonderful time there and I felt this is
[45:56] just still on my heart and I some of
[45:58] some of these Concepts I think are are
[46:01] uh very important and very um timely to
[46:04] us in and where we are in our lives
[46:06] particularly the young people even
[46:08] though there's very few of them thank
[46:10] you for coming that's so nice um and uh
[46:12] so maybe I'll bring it up just a little
[46:15] bit to middle age I hope you realize
[46:17] that I'm I'm preaching to everyone so
[46:20] I'll preach at a young people style but
[46:22] that doesn't mean you older people that
[46:24] there's nothing for you so and you
[46:26] middle-aged people God bless you we're
[46:28] together and so okay Joshua 1: 5-8 there
[46:32] shall not any man be able to stand
[46:33] before thee all the days of thy life as
[46:36] I was with Moses so I be with thee I
[46:38] will not fail thee nor forsake thee be
[46:41] strong and of a good courage For unto
[46:43] this people shalt thou divide divide for
[46:45] an inheritance the land which I swear
[46:47] unto their fathers to give them only be
[46:50] strong and very courageous that thou
[46:52] mayest observe to do all to do according
[46:56] to all the law which my servant which
[46:59] Moses my servant commanded thee turn not
[47:02] from it to the right hand or to the left
[47:04] that thou mayest Prosper withersoever
[47:07] thou goest now so was the law given to
[47:10] us so that you know we could life could
[47:12] just be lame and
[47:15] hard no he wants us to
[47:18] prosper okay so God just just go ahead
[47:21] and tell yourself God wants me to
[47:24] prosper now this isn't TD Jake's
[47:26] prosperity gospel here I'm preaching but
[47:29] but we serve a loving God who wants the
[47:33] best for you amen this book of the law
[47:36] shal not depart out of thy mouth but
[47:39] Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[47:41] night that thou mayest observe to do
[47:43] according to all that is written therein
[47:46] for then Thou shalt make thy way
[47:49] prosperous and then Thou shalt have good
[47:53] success we just bow our heads for a word
[47:55] of prayer Heavenly Father Lord I pray
[47:57] that you just bless the reading of this
[47:59] word Lord and and may it take effect in
[48:01] our lives may we be Joshua and Caleb in
[48:05] this day Lord where your word can come
[48:07] and be spoken to us and that we can read
[48:09] it that we can hear it Lord God and then
[48:11] we can recognize Lord our place in that
[48:15] and Lord how that word can manifest and
[48:18] be effectual and Powerful through our
[48:22] lives even in face of Giants and City
[48:25] walls and problem s and discouragements
[48:29] and all kinds of nervousness that the
[48:31] devil would love to throw at the people
[48:33] today but father with your word in our
[48:36] lives that we could adhere to and
[48:38] meditate upon it Lord we are given the
[48:40] strength Lord to overcome these things
[48:43] father may we recognize that it's for
[48:45] each and every one of us to stand in and
[48:47] and to to meditate in and and to be a
[48:50] part of a very active part of Lord bless
[48:54] this service now and speak to our hearts
[48:56] in Jesus name name amen amen you may be
[49:05] seated so our scripture opens and we we
[49:09] we have Joshua being told by God that it
[49:12] is now time for him to lead the people
[49:15] over into the promised land that which
[49:18] they've been waiting on and you know
[49:20] they they've come out of Egypt and and
[49:22] and so we've we've we've gone through 40
[49:25] years now of wandering ing in the
[49:27] wilderness and now it's time to turn
[49:29] northward and it's time to go and start
[49:32] claiming what was given to them all
[49:34] along and so what a joyous time but but
[49:38] but God you know God tells Joshua you
[49:41] know be strong and very courageous you
[49:44] know and what should you know what
[49:46] should your first thought be anytime
[49:48] someone tells you like what's the first
[49:50] thing that becomes obvious to you when
[49:52] someone who knows more than you tells
[49:54] you be strong and courage
[49:59] you just immediately know it's a walk in
[50:01] the park there's no problems ahead right
[50:04] no God knows this this is good there's
[50:07] going to be a struggle ahead but you're
[50:10] more than able but but if you're but but
[50:13] be strong and courageous you see God God
[50:16] is respecting Joshua God is respecting
[50:20] his people when he tells them be strong
[50:23] be courageous what it what he's saying
[50:25] is is I I know you
[50:28] can if if you couldn't I wouldn't tell
[50:31] you to but when God comes along and just
[50:33] says I need you to be strong he can see
[50:37] the potential that's inside of you and
[50:40] he's trying to encourage you that that
[50:43] that potential could begin to rise up in
[50:46] your life that you could begin to walk
[50:48] forward in what he's called you on to to
[50:51] do so God is giving you know it's it's
[50:53] God respecting the the one in front of
[50:56] him by saying I know you can do this I
[50:59] know there's potential there so be
[51:01] strong and courageous and and get ready
[51:03] to go and and so there's something about
[51:06] strength you know that that that uh that
[51:08] we need in our lives you
[51:12] know and but but it but don't we want
[51:15] strength in our
[51:17] lives right like we who wants to be
[51:22] weak nobody nobody wants to be weak okay
[51:25] so so we want talk about being from
[51:27] Moses to Joshua to be strong and we
[51:31] begin to set the scene here of where
[51:34] what's happening where are they at well
[51:35] here they are they're in a Wilderness
[51:37] and and so you know if we if we can talk
[51:40] about it you know they've come out of
[51:42] Egypt and then they went into a
[51:44] Wilderness and then they want to go to a
[51:46] promised land and and that's our
[51:48] progression you know and and brother
[51:49] Brandon will tell us in many places and
[51:52] and definitely in the in the Third
[51:54] Exodus um and he will compare that Egypt
[51:57] is a type of denominations and and so
[52:00] but but and so from out of denominations
[52:02] and then into a Wilderness but then into
[52:05] the promised land which is the Holy
[52:07] Ghost and eventually on into the
[52:09] Millennium and you know living and
[52:10] reigning with Jesus Christ but here are
[52:12] these children of Israel now that here
[52:14] they are they're they're they've they've
[52:16] been delivered and they've come out of
[52:19] Egypt they've come out of denomination
[52:20] they've come out of this Egyptian
[52:22] Taskmaster and here you know and so what
[52:25] was the cry on their heart before you
[52:27] know leaving Egypt as the as the
[52:29] oppression begin to come on them you
[52:32] know what was the cry on their heart
[52:35] what was it they were they were saying
[52:37] Lord Deliver
[52:39] Us what is it what does Deliver Us
[52:41] Deliver Us from these taskmasters Lord
[52:43] Lord set us free right right and so he
[52:48] brings them out of out of bondage he
[52:50] brings them out of the out of Egypt and
[52:53] across the the Red Sea and here they are
[52:56] and and and and Pharaoh's taskmasters in
[52:59] the the Army is drowned behind them and
[53:03] they they sing songs of Victory on the
[53:05] banks of the Red Sea opposite Egypt and
[53:08] so what is so what has happened well
[53:11] they've been set free There's No Going
[53:14] Back the the Deliverance is assured
[53:16] there's no Army to ever take them and
[53:18] Captivate them from Egypt ever again
[53:21] they've been set free and what a time
[53:24] that is you know and they finished their
[53:26] joing and all the you know Miriam's song
[53:29] and Moses song and we have these in the
[53:31] scriptures and how wonderful it is you
[53:33] know and man can you imagine the next
[53:35] day you know it's like you wake up and
[53:36] it's like

[55:58] know like okay you had Sunday and so at
[56:00] least you know there was a little bit of
[56:01] structure you went to church you know
[56:02] and now you're on week two of absolute
[56:05] freedom and you get up Monday morning is
[56:08] and and it's like hey what are you going
[56:10] to do
[56:12] today and what is the response of every
[56:15] young
[56:17] person nothing or I don't
[56:22] know that's good you can do whatever you
[56:25] want what you going
[56:26] do I don't know what is there to
[56:30] do well there's a bajillion things you
[56:33] could do but I don't know but you're
[56:36] free to do whatever you want to do what
[56:37] are you going to
[56:39] do
[56:42] nothing
[56:45] Freedom deliverance from taskmasters
[56:48] deliverance from tyranny and yet here we
[56:51] go we're a week out we had the we sang
[56:53] the songs of of Victory and rejoicing
[56:55] and here here we are a weak into to
[56:57] freedom and we're like I don't know what
[57:00] to do with my
[57:08] life so so what happens when
[57:14] you you're
[57:17] delivered into complete and total
[57:21] freedom well you've entered the
[57:24] Wilderness where you you
[57:27] just you just
[57:30] wander you just what are you going to do
[57:33] I I I don't
[57:36] know I play some more video games
[57:40] but 100% at that game last
[57:43] [Music]
[57:45] week you
[57:48] just you just you're free this is what
[57:51] it looks like sometimes
[57:56] and I'll just do it one more time to
[57:58] make it super awkward so that you get
[58:00] like so it just really sinks in like
[58:03] wandering is
[58:05] lame right and so you know you just you
[58:09] do the wander and you
[58:13] just I don't
[58:14] know
[58:19] nothing it's a
[58:21] metaphor you're all there okay good and
[58:23] so yeah so so the Israelites they come
[58:26] out of Egypt but now they're so free
[58:29] right and there's there's nothing they
[58:30] have to do but but there's there's
[58:32] nothing you know there's there's got to
[58:34] be at some point in time there's got to
[58:36] be something before them that gives them
[58:39] direction of what is good to be going
[58:41] into that gives them purpose and gives
[58:44] them meaning and so God says yeah but
[58:47] the whole intent was always to get you
[58:49] into the promised land it was never it
[58:52] that's where you're truly free is in the
[58:54] promised land because though you're free
[58:57] from denomination though you're free
[58:59] from you know from from from all of the
[59:02] the bondage that you used to be in but
[59:05] now now you're sitting there wandering
[59:07] and it can't be said that you're bound
[59:10] but in the same token you're not Ser
[59:12] you're not truly free because you're
[59:14] bound by your own circumstances of now
[59:18] if I have to if I have to choose that's
[59:22] if I have to
[59:23] choose what do I choose
[59:28] well you see you become you become your
[59:31] own
[59:32] God you know that's so
[59:37] good and that can be cool I'm master of
[59:42] Me no one can tell me what to do okay
[59:45] what are you going to do I don't
[59:47] know man you are such a master of you
[59:51] good good job you see you see the
[59:53] problem is is that we we like that idea
[59:55] you know especially if our parents have
[59:57] been telling us to do a lot of things
[59:58] lately we like the idea of Master of me
[1:00:01] but then when I become master of me now
[1:00:03] I have to actually be
[1:00:06] Master it's not just not that anymore
[1:00:08] but now it's what is it now and so now I
[1:00:12] if I'm God for myself I I have to be God
[1:00:15] and there's just one problem with me
[1:00:17] having to be God well there's a couple
[1:00:20] of problems I mean you know number one
[1:00:21] I'm just not but that that's the you
[1:00:24] know the point right under that one a is
[1:00:28] I don't I don't know everything like he
[1:00:31] [Applause]
[1:00:33] does and I look in the mirror when I
[1:00:36] wake up at tennish in the morning and I
[1:00:39] go you're in charge
[1:00:41] buddy and then you think man who put
[1:00:44] that guy in charge that's a dumb idea
[1:00:47] cuz I know me and if you're honest you
[1:00:49] know you and you think the same thing
[1:00:51] when you're looking in the mirror and
[1:00:52] you allow you know your your masks of
[1:00:55] you know arrogance and pride and all of
[1:00:57] this to go away and you allow yourself
[1:00:59] to see down into your heart you
[1:01:01] recognize man whoever put me in charge
[1:01:03] was
[1:01:04] dumb they shouldn't have done that you
[1:01:12] know and that's a problem isn't it
[1:01:14] because then with all of this potential
[1:01:17] on the inside of you with zero Direction
[1:01:19] you're like I don't know what you going
[1:01:21] to do
[1:01:24] nothing here we here here here we are
[1:01:26] and so the the Israelites now here they
[1:01:28] are they're in this freedom but they're
[1:01:30] in this freedom to wander and they've
[1:01:33] got to they've got to recognize that
[1:01:35] there's got to be something because they
[1:01:37] don't have it inside of themselves to
[1:01:39] say you know what let's all get together
[1:01:41] and decide what would be really really
[1:01:43] good and let's go and do it you know
[1:01:44] because did you ever wonder they get to
[1:01:46] Kadesh barnea and they send out the 10
[1:01:48] the the 12 Spies right and it's like
[1:01:51] well why you know Moses you lead us out
[1:01:54] of Egypt you lead across the Red Sea you
[1:01:57] bring us over to SI we just follow which
[1:02:00] what we do we're Israelites we just
[1:02:01] follow our Prophet amen praise God how
[1:02:05] spiritual glory to God we follow a
[1:02:08] prophet and then the prophet comes and
[1:02:10] brings you to Kadesh Baria and you
[1:02:12] follow him all the way to Kadesh barnea
[1:02:14] and then he's got this idea to send
[1:02:17] spies out to go and see what is this
[1:02:20] does this promised land is it everything
[1:02:22] that we've been told it is and and so
[1:02:24] the spies come back
[1:02:26] and they say well you know two of them
[1:02:28] say look I mean there's grapes as big as
[1:02:29] your head here you know this is pretty
[1:02:31] amazing let's go and then other people
[1:02:34] are like yeah but did you see the Giants
[1:02:36] that eat those grapes you know their
[1:02:37] grapes are as big as our heads but those
[1:02:40] giants just go that's that's a good gra
[1:02:43] and that's problematic for us because
[1:02:45] we're obviously not that big and they
[1:02:48] begin to bring an evil report and and
[1:02:50] Moses Moses Moses just just leaves it up
[1:02:54] to the people here you go here's the
[1:02:57] report that you've been given I've we
[1:02:59] brought you this far now what are you
[1:03:02] going to do with the promise that I've
[1:03:05] given you and Moses doesn't lead Moses
[1:03:08] just doesn't lead it's like hey people
[1:03:10] there's Jericho we already did this now
[1:03:12] let's go do this thing take his staff
[1:03:14] and go forward and people just follow
[1:03:17] but Moses doesn't do that he stops to
[1:03:19] give them a chance to to see if they can
[1:03:22] recognize and find their own place in
[1:03:25] the word of God so that the promise
[1:03:27] doesn't just stay outside of them that
[1:03:30] they go get to walk into but they become
[1:03:33] part of their promise that the qualities
[1:03:36] of the promised land become inside of
[1:03:38] them
[1:03:40] [Applause]
[1:03:43] themselves and you want that it sounds
[1:03:46] nice well Moses if you can just lead us
[1:03:48] into the promised land okay if we have
[1:03:49] to take swords that's fine but you just
[1:03:51] keep leading us that'd be
[1:03:53] good right and that sounds nice
[1:03:56] because then we don't have to think
[1:03:57] about it we don't have to you know we
[1:04:00] just there's no like and instead God's
[1:04:03] like Joshua hey you're going to have to
[1:04:04] be strong and we're like
[1:04:08] well that doesn't sound as good because
[1:04:12] this is how most of us want to how much
[1:04:15] do you weigh these days what how much do
[1:04:17] you weigh these days 16 oh I can do that
[1:04:19] totally okay yeah um so this is how most
[1:04:21] of us you can stand here this is how
[1:04:24] most of us just just just like this just
[1:04:26] like this yeah I know you don't need to
[1:04:28] Don't worry
[1:04:29] um this is how most of us are you
[1:04:31] nervous this is how most of us want
[1:04:35] truly want God to bring us to the
[1:04:36] promised
[1:04:39] land just thank you Lord just want to go
[1:04:42] to the promised land here we
[1:04:45] [Applause]
[1:04:48] go enjoy your grapes and the milk and
[1:04:51] honey
[1:04:59] you left because because you know
[1:05:02] somehow brother Trevor figured out what
[1:05:05] deep down on the inside of your own
[1:05:06] heart how on Earth did he do that well
[1:05:08] cuz that's cuz that's me that's what I
[1:05:12] want I mean Lord you know this looks
[1:05:15] hard how about you
[1:05:19] just as Ben would say impersonating me
[1:05:22] do the thing and get me into the
[1:05:25] Promised Land
[1:05:27] and there's just a problem though
[1:05:30] because Ben he's here and he's enjoying
[1:05:33] his milk and honey he's en enjoying the
[1:05:36] grapes and it's so wonderful but who is
[1:05:39] he say well he's a child of God in the
[1:05:42] promised land yeah but inside in his
[1:05:44] heart what does he what does he know
[1:05:46] about himself what does he think about
[1:05:48] himself inside of his own heart because
[1:05:51] he's been picked up thrown into a
[1:05:53] Promised Land he knows his identity he
[1:05:55] is an EXs slave eating grapes come on
[1:06:00] that's who he is by any objective
[1:06:02] standard he's just an ex-slave that God
[1:06:05] said you know what you you don't need to
[1:06:07] be a slave anymore because I'm God and I
[1:06:09] say so so I'm going to deliver you out
[1:06:11] then I'm going to pick you up take you
[1:06:12] across the Wilderness put you in a
[1:06:14] Promised Land here you go buddy enjoy
[1:06:16] your grapes pray why don't you praise
[1:06:18] the
[1:06:24] Lord doeses anybody want that
[1:06:28] experience does is that what you want
[1:06:30] your testimony to
[1:06:31] be God just let me be lazy just let me
[1:06:35] be
[1:06:36] weak let me not do anything to get
[1:06:39] myself to the promised land let can you
[1:06:40] just carry me oh God into the promised
[1:06:43] land now I I I I understand we look at
[1:06:46] the the footsteps you know picture and
[1:06:48] you know hey there was two sets of
[1:06:50] footprints and then there was one and
[1:06:52] God and that prayer and that's beautiful
[1:06:53] and I love that that's fine but some
[1:06:55] times we hang out on that prayer like
[1:06:57] that whole thing like way too hard and
[1:06:59] it's like God there was like we look
[1:07:01] back and say Lord there was never there
[1:07:03] was never two sets of footprints did I
[1:07:05] do anything he's like
[1:07:08] no no you were a child you were just a
[1:07:11] baby you never grew but I put you in the
[1:07:14] promised land and gave you grapes
[1:07:17] because of me and he is that good but
[1:07:21] honestly he's better but he's he's not
[1:07:24] just that good he's better than than
[1:07:26] that so good because Ben doesn't want to
[1:07:29] be a weak EXs slave eating grapes in the
[1:07:32] promised
[1:07:33] land uhuh who looks up at God and says
[1:07:37] God thank you so much it was so great of
[1:07:38] you but there's there's like this like
[1:07:41] there's this vast Gulf between us Lord
[1:07:43] we're supposed to be husband and wife
[1:07:45] but there's this vast Gulf between us
[1:07:47] cuz I'm just weak sauce and you are so
[1:07:49] Sovereign and you just picked me up and
[1:07:50] threw me here and I'm all I can just do
[1:07:52] is be thankful but I have no idea what
[1:07:55] it is to enjoy the characteristics of
[1:07:59] who you are on the inside of me
[1:08:03] Hallelujah that's right you can sit down
[1:08:06] thank
[1:08:08] you and none of us when we think about
[1:08:12] when we think about the end result none
[1:08:14] of us want that because because what God
[1:08:17] is telling Joshua he says I'm telling
[1:08:19] you to be strong but one of the like one
[1:08:22] of the things about becoming strong and
[1:08:25] go going through the trials is that is
[1:08:27] that the part of part of what you want
[1:08:30] in the promised land is to have strength
[1:08:33] in your own
[1:08:35] life you want to be someone who's strong
[1:08:38] in the promised land you don't want to
[1:08:40] have just gotten there because God was
[1:08:42] so so good to you no you want to get
[1:08:45] gotten there because God was better to
[1:08:47] you to strengthen you to develop you to
[1:08:50] to give you an identity of something
[1:08:52] other than I'm just an ex slave because
[1:08:55] that's all my identity was but God puts
[1:08:58] them he doesn't just take them from
[1:09:00] Egypt into Promised Land he puts them in
[1:09:02] a Wilderness so now they have a journey
[1:09:06] and in that Journey they begin to
[1:09:08] develop the characteristics that God
[1:09:10] himself has so when they walk and they
[1:09:13] gain strength and they gain the
[1:09:15] character that he wants them to have and
[1:09:18] they get over to the promised land
[1:09:20] they're no longer an EXs slave eating
[1:09:23] grapes but now they're a child of
[1:09:25] almighty God who has who has things in
[1:09:28] common with her
[1:09:31] husband where he is strong we have those
[1:09:34] same attributes that he has caused to be
[1:09:37] developed inside of us and this is a
[1:09:39] promise my friends this is what God
[1:09:41] wants for us not to just make it easy
[1:09:44] but to develop inside of us all that he
[1:09:47] is so that our fellowship in the
[1:09:49] promised land is
[1:09:51] [Applause]
[1:09:53] Rich so we want
[1:09:56] strength but so often we forget and we
[1:09:58] want oh carry me carry me over now God
[1:10:03] is gracious and in hard times he can
[1:10:05] there are times when when he knows he's
[1:10:08] he you know he doesn't put more on you
[1:10:10] than you can handle and if he puts those
[1:10:12] things on you he helps you
[1:10:16] handle that's
[1:10:18] good but he wants you to be strong he
[1:10:22] wants you to participate in this
[1:10:26] amen he wants to develop you
[1:10:29] amen okay so here we go we're we're
[1:10:32] coming out of Egypt and we're in the
[1:10:33] wilderness and coming through a promised
[1:10:35] land and we got to start developing
[1:10:38] these uh some of these uh some of these
[1:10:42] ideas here that we're going to be using
[1:10:44] throughout the sermon but who are we
[1:10:46] talking about here who has come out of
[1:10:48] Egypt and who is now in the Wilderness
[1:10:51] at this time where Joshua is being told
[1:10:53] to be strong and very courageous
[1:10:57] well there was a group that came out of
[1:11:00] Egypt with
[1:11:01] Moses they came to cadesh
[1:11:04] barnea there was a group that came out
[1:11:06] of Egypt with Moses but they were under
[1:11:08] 20 years old at Kadesh
[1:11:11] barnea there
[1:11:13] was the children of those who came out
[1:11:17] of Egypt with Moses but were under 20
[1:11:19] years old at kades
[1:11:21] spia and then there was those children
[1:11:23] who were the children of the children of
[1:11:25] the children who you get the idea right
[1:11:28] you so okay so let me let me just walk
[1:11:30] through this really quick right so you
[1:11:32] have this whole two million people that
[1:11:34] come out of Egypt with Moses they come
[1:11:36] to Kadesh Baria and they accept the the
[1:11:38] report of the 10 spies and they decide
[1:11:41] not to go into EG into the into the
[1:11:43] promised land and so and so God punishes
[1:11:46] them and says well because you've done
[1:11:49] this and you haven't believed like Caleb
[1:11:51] and Joshua you are now going to have to
[1:11:53] wander for 40 years
[1:11:55] in the desert and everyone 20 years old
[1:12:00] and
[1:12:01] upwards will die in the wilderness and
[1:12:04] not go into the promised land yes sir
[1:12:07] and these little ones who you said would
[1:12:09] be a prey they'll go in right can you
[1:12:13] imagine having turned
[1:12:16] 20 and we'll get to that later
[1:12:20] um and so so then you have these that
[1:12:22] are 19 and and younger and and they're
[1:12:25] you know there they are they're they're
[1:12:27] at Kadesh Baria they experienced Egypt
[1:12:30] themselves and so they're growing up and
[1:12:33] as they grow up well you got 40 years so
[1:12:36] those 20 19 year olds can are old enough
[1:12:38] to get married and have children and
[1:12:40] those you got 40 years you can go
[1:12:43] another 20 years and those 20 year olds
[1:12:44] can have other children and so now you
[1:12:46] have four generations of people
[1:12:49] wandering in the wilderness and of
[1:12:50] course this first generation here they
[1:12:53] don't they don't get to go in
[1:12:55] to the promised land and so we we have
[1:12:58] to set that up because we're going to be
[1:13:00] dealing with which generation we're in
[1:13:02] and trying to understand how that
[1:13:04] impacts who we are and and and our
[1:13:07] relations with others and
[1:13:09] so so what is the promised land that
[1:13:13] we're looking for and so I just wanted
[1:13:15] to you know we we want to Define that we
[1:13:17] want to talk about what what we're what
[1:13:19] it is we're going to and brother
[1:13:20] brandham says when Sinners plunge
[1:13:22] beneath the flood and lose all their
[1:13:23] guilty stains then you're a candidate to
[1:13:25] follow the Church of God on through this
[1:13:27] Wilderness journey into the promised
[1:13:29] land and our promised land is found in
[1:13:31] John 14 let your hearts let not your
[1:13:34] hearts be troubled if you believe in God
[1:13:36] believe also in me for in my father's
[1:13:39] house there are many mansions if it were
[1:13:41] not so I would have told you I go to
[1:13:43] prepare a place for you and I will come
[1:13:47] again to receive you unto myself so God
[1:13:51] is preparing a place and so many of us
[1:13:53] you know and so much of Christianity
[1:13:56] just oh God is preparing a place for us
[1:13:58] for you in heaven don't you want a
[1:14:00] mansion in heaven it's going to be
[1:14:02] amazing so many of you probably have
[1:14:03] little houses don't you you have you
[1:14:05] have modest homes you know but you wish
[1:14:08] you had mansions and follow Jesus you
[1:14:12] can have a
[1:14:14] mansion this is Christianity there you
[1:14:17] go follow Jesus he'll give you a mansion
[1:14:21] it's a good deal like you know
[1:14:25] it was a monopoly card no we're not
[1:14:27] going to go there anyway and so and so
[1:14:29] but that's what we like but that's what
[1:14:30] they think but right but we miss and I
[1:14:33] will come again and receive you unto
[1:14:36] myself what's better than having a
[1:14:37] mansion in heaven well what's much
[1:14:39] better than having a mansion in heaven
[1:14:41] is being with Jesus in The Mansion in
[1:14:44] heaven that's the whole point I get to
[1:14:48] be with him how wonderful is that that
[1:14:52] is our promised land is being with him
[1:14:55] am today you the church has come through
[1:14:58] justification through Luther
[1:14:59] sanctification through Methodist and now
[1:15:00] up to the time of the promise the
[1:15:02] promise is the baptism of the spirit
[1:15:04] which is Promised all through the Old
[1:15:06] Testament and New too see the Promise
[1:15:08] behold I send the promise of my father
[1:15:09] upon you Peter said that on the day of
[1:15:11] Pentecost that is the promise the
[1:15:13] promised land is to live in this land of
[1:15:16] the Holy Spirit that's God's promise for
[1:15:19] the church is to live in the power of
[1:15:21] the spirit it's another world another
[1:15:24] land you have to come out of the
[1:15:26] conditions you've been in to come out to
[1:15:28] live in this promised land to receive
[1:15:31] the promise remember the promise you
[1:15:33] shall receive power from on high after
[1:15:35] this the Holy Ghost is come upon you so
[1:15:39] you're going to live in this land of the
[1:15:40] Holy Spirit um and and to live in the
[1:15:43] power of the spirit now I think one of
[1:15:46] the problems that we have today even
[1:15:48] inside of the message is that we limit
[1:15:50] what the power of the spirit means and
[1:15:53] what the power of the spirit means means
[1:15:55] to us is Pentecostal power is is hey you
[1:15:59] got a demon come on up we're going to
[1:16:00] cast that out you know you're you you
[1:16:02] you're sick okay we'll pray for you and
[1:16:04] you'll be healed you know and and signs
[1:16:06] and wonders and speaking in tongues and
[1:16:09] you know and and and and big times at
[1:16:11] church and all of these things and
[1:16:12] that's wonderful and that is part of it
[1:16:15] yes but but but to live in the power of
[1:16:18] the spirit it's like Oh yay you can you
[1:16:22] can cast out devils and we know that you
[1:16:24] can
[1:16:25] right
[1:16:27] amen right because you're filled with
[1:16:28] the Holy
[1:16:29] Spirit you don't have to be a big
[1:16:31] preacher you don't have to be a little
[1:16:36] preacher very well anyway we won't get
[1:16:38] there and and so and so right even these
[1:16:41] little guys right because I was 20 and
[1:16:45] not even a preacher yet and and and and
[1:16:47] my prayer cured
[1:16:50] cancer how old are you 21 good time to
[1:16:53] be praying for people with cancer
[1:16:55] just anecdotally that's what I
[1:16:58] think right those that power of the Holy
[1:17:01] Ghost is for anyone that is our promise
[1:17:03] to live in that but how strange how
[1:17:06] strange is it that that that is that is
[1:17:10] what we focus on and that is okay this
[1:17:12] these are great because those these
[1:17:14] things are Supernatural but we forget
[1:17:16] and we don't talk about and we we like
[1:17:18] what about just strength what about
[1:17:20] strength to overcome the problems that I
[1:17:23] face in my life
[1:17:25] what about peace what about Joy What
[1:17:28] About Love what about hope I'm talking
[1:17:30] about conditions of the P it's another
[1:17:33] land that we're look think about the
[1:17:35] land that we're living in right now and
[1:17:37] think well what if it was actually good
[1:17:39] that's what I'm talking about living in
[1:17:41] another land and while we're there why
[1:17:44] don't we talk about why don't we talk
[1:17:45] about these that the see this this this
[1:17:48] idea the problem that we begin to have
[1:17:50] and and one of the issues that that we
[1:17:52] face is is if we're not looking and
[1:17:55] we're not understanding what's going on
[1:17:57] here and we're not understanding where
[1:17:58] we are here is we're not understanding
[1:18:00] how we relate to the word of God and how
[1:18:03] what our definition of the promised land
[1:18:05] truly is now I'm going to tell you right
[1:18:07] here and right now the word of God is
[1:18:10] the definition for your life for your
[1:18:13] purpose for the promised land and if you
[1:18:15] and if you meditate on those things day
[1:18:17] and night and to do according to all
[1:18:21] that is written therein your way will be
[1:18:24] made prosper
[1:18:25] and you will have good success does that
[1:18:28] mean you're going to have a big mansion
[1:18:31] yes but not only that does that mean
[1:18:33] you'll have big grapes as big as your
[1:18:35] head to eat in the promised land yes but
[1:18:38] why limit God why not right now live in
[1:18:41] another land of the promise of
[1:18:44] success and prosperity and I'm not even
[1:18:47] talking about money and name it and
[1:18:49] claim it and everybody grab your wallet
[1:18:51] and prophesy I'm not talking about that
[1:18:53] how miserable is it to name and claim a
[1:18:56] million dollars into your wallet and
[1:18:58] still be miserable and bitter and
[1:19:01] unhappy and no peace and no love and no
[1:19:04] joy I'm talking about a power of the
[1:19:06] Holy Spirit what is that to take the
[1:19:09] mind and the Heart of almighty God from
[1:19:13] way back before he before he ever
[1:19:15] created the world and to place all of
[1:19:17] those thoughts feelings emotions and and
[1:19:21] qualities in your own heart that's Pro
[1:19:25] prosperous that's good success that's
[1:19:29] what I want now that's what I want in my
[1:19:30] Promised Land don't talk to me I'm out
[1:19:33] of mansion talk to me about the heart of
[1:19:35] God coming on the inside of the
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:38] believer right but see but see this
[1:19:41] first this first group that came out of
[1:19:43] Egypt you see they have a definition of
[1:19:46] a promised land that that this third and
[1:19:49] fourth group they don't have you see
[1:19:51] this first group came out of
[1:19:53] Egypt and if you you know and if you
[1:19:55] talk to one of them and said well what
[1:19:57] do you think the promised land is and
[1:19:58] it's like well here I you know if
[1:20:01] nothing else I can tell you this about
[1:20:02] the promised land it's not Egypt
[1:20:05] right you think about if you just take
[1:20:08] the opposite of what Egypt is was for me
[1:20:12] that will be my promised
[1:20:14] land and the second group depending on
[1:20:17] how old they were in that second group
[1:20:19] they could say the same thing their
[1:20:21] definition of the promised land could
[1:20:22] very easily be not Egypt
[1:20:25] right I saw what it did to my
[1:20:27] parents I want no part of that wow I
[1:20:31] want the promised land to whatever
[1:20:34] created the conditions of Egypt I don't
[1:20:36] want any part of
[1:20:38] that and so then then you come down to
[1:20:40] the Next Generation who were born in the
[1:20:46] wilderness they don't have that
[1:20:48] definition right they've never been to
[1:20:50] Egypt right and their parents are
[1:20:53] talking about how bad Egypt was they're
[1:20:54] grandparents talking about how bad Egypt
[1:20:56] was man we're going to a Promised Land
[1:20:58] that's not like Egypt and these these
[1:21:01] young people you know as their
[1:21:03] wandering this third and fourth
[1:21:05] generation no idea what Egypt was might
[1:21:08] not even be able to find it on a
[1:21:09] map they're wandering that's all they've
[1:21:12] known man I was born
[1:21:14] wandering I turned 10 and I was
[1:21:19] wandering I got married we were
[1:21:23] wandering what's the promise
[1:21:25] land I
[1:21:27] mean I don't know I mean I've heard it
[1:21:31] wasn't Egypt but well what was
[1:21:34] Egypt I don't know kind of sounded
[1:21:37] bad what do you think the promised land
[1:21:39] will be
[1:21:41] like I don't know it's a it's another
[1:21:46] place it's all they've known as
[1:21:50] Wilderness the highs and the
[1:21:52] lows don't mean anything anymore more
[1:21:55] because they're just in this
[1:21:58] Freedom State and just as they don't
[1:22:01] know what to do with their life except
[1:22:04] for sleep in
[1:22:07] and do nothing on their definition of
[1:22:11] what a promised land
[1:22:13] is can just
[1:22:15] be another place I mean I've been to a
[1:22:19] few places you know we were in the
[1:22:20] wilderness of Zin we were you know sin
[1:22:24] it's another Wilderness we were in um
[1:22:26] what was the name of that other
[1:22:27] Wilderness spot that we were in can't
[1:22:29] remember it right now of course there's
[1:22:31] Kadesh Baria um there's a well here and
[1:22:33] there every now and then you
[1:22:37] know heard God created one out of you
[1:22:40] know water out of a
[1:22:43] rock you know but I mean I don't know I
[1:22:47] wasn't there I didn't see it we begin to
[1:22:51] see that that we have to think about
[1:22:55] some some some of the people that we
[1:22:57] know some of the the pastors from the
[1:22:59] days uh uh uh you know from from the
[1:23:01] older days and some of the some of the
[1:23:03] grandfathers and some of the fathers and
[1:23:05] they they they experienced
[1:23:08] Egypt but so many of us did
[1:23:11] not and so we have to we have to
[1:23:14] understand how do we G what what is
[1:23:16] going to what is going to define the
[1:23:18] promised land for
[1:23:20] us there's only going to be one place
[1:23:24] young people there's only going to be
[1:23:25] one place for you to find the definition
[1:23:27] of the promised land and that is the
[1:23:28] word of God and if you want to get out
[1:23:31] of the wandering if the wandering gets
[1:23:34] old and boring and it will and I hope it
[1:23:36] already is then I what I would say is be
[1:23:39] like Caleb and Joshua and look into the
[1:23:42] word of God to find out what he says
[1:23:44] about you meditate therein day and night
[1:23:48] be strong and courageous to do all that
[1:23:50] was
[1:23:51] written
[1:23:53] God Joshua goes and throughout the
[1:23:55] throughout the Book of Joshua Joshua is
[1:23:57] continually going Moses
[1:24:00] said Moses said Moses said good thing
[1:24:03] Joshua was there that had actually heard
[1:24:05] what Moses said you know and Joshua is
[1:24:07] what you know we had somebody from the
[1:24:08] first generation that got to go and tell
[1:24:10] us what Moses said right but God has God
[1:24:15] God has done more for us in this age
[1:24:17] than he did for Joshua on that day
[1:24:20] because every single one of us can pick
[1:24:22] up the phone out of our pocket and can
[1:24:25] go and point to something Moses
[1:24:28] said you don't rely on your grandfather
[1:24:31] as great as he might have been to tell
[1:24:33] you what Moses said you rely on Moses's
[1:24:37] voice being played in your own
[1:24:41] ears and there's no reason we shouldn't
[1:24:45] have we have everything at our disposal
[1:24:48] to be strong and courageous to do all
[1:24:51] that our Moses said to take us into to a
[1:24:54] promised land that he's defining for us
[1:24:57] and telling us what it is and and and
[1:25:00] trying to wake us up from our wandering
[1:25:02] he's saying you're wandering right what
[1:25:05] are you doing with your life I don't
[1:25:07] know I guess I'm going to get a job I
[1:25:09] guess maybe I'll get married and you
[1:25:13] know I'll do the message
[1:25:21] thing like everyone else does
[1:25:25] and then my children they'll do the same
[1:25:29] thing and what is
[1:25:33] that that's
[1:25:35] wandering just wandering we're just
[1:25:38] doing the things that we've always done
[1:25:41] we don't really know why because we've
[1:25:43] we're just Wilderness people we don't
[1:25:46] know where we've come from we don't know
[1:25:47] where we're going we're just in the
[1:25:50] wilderness and God has saying but Moses
[1:25:53] said what Willam brandom said it's right
[1:25:56] there for you and if you'll be strong
[1:25:58] and courageous to face the problems in
[1:26:00] your life to face to face the problem of
[1:26:03] the wandering in your own life to say
[1:26:06] there's a place for you to go but
[1:26:09] there's only one there's only one way
[1:26:11] you're going to ever find the definition
[1:26:13] cuz you were never in a denomination you
[1:26:16] don't have well what's a what's the
[1:26:17] Christian Life look like well I can tell
[1:26:19] you one thing it's not denomination
[1:26:24] but you were never in
[1:26:27] one not denomination is nothing it means
[1:26:31] it's meaningless to the third and the
[1:26:34] fourth generation not denomination has
[1:26:36] zero meaning and so what you all are
[1:26:39] going to have to do is look to the word
[1:26:41] of God and and meditate on it that it
[1:26:45] can def because otherwise you will live
[1:26:47] your life in wandering and you'll go
[1:26:50] nowhere but in circle after circle after
[1:26:53] Circle claiming to be a people following
[1:26:56] God but it's strange to be a people
[1:26:58] following God in circles and I don't
[1:27:01] believe God ever wanted us to just be
[1:27:03] led in circles but he wanted to lead us
[1:27:05] to a promised land and he gave us the
[1:27:08] the ability to do it so that we could
[1:27:11] take that and like Joshua and Caleb be
[1:27:14] more than just ex-slaves be more than
[1:27:16] just ex Wanderers but be children of
[1:27:19] almighty God bestowed by with the
[1:27:21] virtues that he himself owns and
[1:27:24] possesses because we've walked through
[1:27:26] the trials and we've decided I'm not
[1:27:28] going to wander anymore but I'm going to
[1:27:30] face the Giants of the promised land and
[1:27:33] I'm going to turn northward and go
[1:27:35] forward and when you do that strength
[1:27:38] will come inside of you so your identity
[1:27:42] when you get there will not be ex-slave
[1:27:44] will not be ex Wanderer and part of the
[1:27:47] promise is is you developing that and
[1:27:51] walking through that so that you have
[1:27:53] that when you get there Hallelujah
[1:27:56] that's
[1:27:57] truth hallelujah praise the Lord okay we
[1:28:01] read
[1:28:03] that we read
[1:28:06] that okay so you could ask
[1:28:09] yourself well we are we do not have
[1:28:12] enough time okay you could ask
[1:28:16] yourself what kind of Promised Land
[1:28:18] would God prepare for you
[1:28:21] right but then you'd have to ask
[1:28:22] yourself
[1:28:27] well you know if God was a very bad
[1:28:31] person he could create a very bad
[1:28:33] Promised Land If God Was a Very you know
[1:28:36] um scatterbrained individual you know he
[1:28:40] might you know he might make a mansion
[1:28:42] but forget the
[1:28:44] plumbing and no one wants
[1:28:47] that and so so the question of what kind
[1:28:50] of Promised Land would he prepare and
[1:28:53] and and reminds us of the fact that he
[1:28:56] it's it's he's going to receive us to
[1:28:58] himself so the promised land he's
[1:29:00] preparing is himself the promised land

[1:30:29] what I'll say to
[1:30:31] them right we fail we fall because we're
[1:30:34] flesh but but we're in this Wilderness
[1:30:36] God put us in this Wilderness to prove
[1:30:38] us to test us to to to strengthen us to
[1:30:41] to get us to recognize that the
[1:30:43] Wilderness is not our final goal but
[1:30:45] that he is and so and so to rise up to
[1:30:48] be strong and courageous to move
[1:30:50] ourselves into a Wilderness right so so
[1:30:53] to recog ize who he is and what kind of
[1:30:56] Promised Land he would prepare so so
[1:30:59] again we we just see here this book of
[1:31:01] the law shall not depart out of thy
[1:31:03] mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein
[1:31:04] day and night that thou mayest observe
[1:31:06] to do according to all that is written
[1:31:09] therein it is not saying to perfect to
[1:31:13] do
[1:31:13] flawlessly to never have an issue no
[1:31:16] meditate on the word strengthen in the
[1:31:19] word understand look if the word had
[1:31:21] enough power that when it was spoken and
[1:31:24] and said let there be light and there
[1:31:26] was you know and I told you you could
[1:31:28] have that kind of power on the inside of
[1:31:31] your life you'd be like who really that
[1:31:35] kind of power that says let there be
[1:31:37] light and there was could could be
[1:31:40] inside of yeah yeah how do I get that
[1:31:43] brother
[1:31:44] Trevor read the word
[1:31:47] amen listen to the word meditate upon
[1:31:52] the word let it get down deep on the
[1:31:54] inside of you to do according to all
[1:31:58] that is written therein for then Thou
[1:32:00] shalt make thy way prosperous it won't
[1:32:02] just become prosperous you'll have an
[1:32:04] active part in making your way
[1:32:06] prosperous and thou shalt have good
[1:32:09] success well glory to God so so be
[1:32:14] strong and so if you'll forgive me for
[1:32:17] this next part I want to I want to bring
[1:32:20] to you not Joshua
[1:32:24] 1 5-8 is that okay I hope everyone
[1:32:28] understands what I say when I say this
[1:32:30] is not Joshua 1 5-8 this is a rendering
[1:32:34] of Joshua 1 15-8 that is nothing like
[1:32:37] what it actually says just for a just to
[1:32:40] make a point here not Joshua 1 15-8
[1:32:44] reads no one will bother you all the
[1:32:46] days of your life just as I have hovered
[1:32:48] over others before you I will continue
[1:32:50] to do so for you I will not leave you or
[1:32:53] make you do anything anything
[1:32:56] hard be weak and very
[1:32:59] cuddled for you will inherit the land
[1:33:02] which I am giving to the people
[1:33:03] according to my promise only be weak and
[1:33:07] excessively
[1:33:08] pampered that you may avoid anything
[1:33:11] difficult or challenging and carefully
[1:33:15] neglect all that you have been commanded
[1:33:19] that is so good do not strive to the
[1:33:22] right hand or to the left so that you
[1:33:24] may remain comfortable wherever you
[1:33:28] go this book of the law shall stay on
[1:33:32] your shelf you shall barely acknowledge
[1:33:36] it day or night that you may avoid the
[1:33:39] discomfort of action and let
[1:33:42] mediocrity Define your
[1:33:46] way there you
[1:33:48] [Applause]
[1:33:52] go sounds pretty bad
[1:33:54] right nobody wants
[1:33:57] this nobody wants this nobody wants the
[1:34:00] definition of their life to be this but
[1:34:03] yet the book of the law often stays on
[1:34:06] our Shelf barely acknowledged so true so
[1:34:11] if you don't want this to be your
[1:34:14] definition right then don't do these
[1:34:17] things be strong and very
[1:34:21] courageous becoming strong is part of
[1:34:24] the promise because because because what
[1:34:27] we just read not Joshua 15-8 is is no
[1:34:32] one wants that to be part who they are
[1:34:35] eating grapes and honey in the promised
[1:34:37] land you don't want that how' you get
[1:34:39] here carefully neglected everything I
[1:34:42] was told tried to be as mediocre as
[1:34:45] mediocre as possible really that's so
[1:34:48] what a blessing I'm glad you're with us
[1:34:51] here in the Promised Land
[1:34:54] my no no one wants this so you don't
[1:34:58] want to so so then don't then don't
[1:35:01] inhabit this kind of inaction in your
[1:35:04] own life that's
[1:35:07] right that is so good yeah remembering
[1:35:11] the Lord I wonder Brethren let's think
[1:35:12] seriously now we Pentecostal people I
[1:35:14] wonder if we receive the Holy Ghost just
[1:35:16] for entertainment but there's more than
[1:35:18] that goes with it there's a life got to
[1:35:20] be lived I wonder if that's the
[1:35:22] hindrance of the churches today Brethren
[1:35:24] I wonder if that's the reason we're
[1:35:25] still back here in the wilderness
[1:35:27] wandering around instead of over in the
[1:35:29] promised land possessing all things I
[1:35:31] wonder if there isn't something we
[1:35:33] haven't thought seriously enough about
[1:35:35] see we must think seriously and so the
[1:35:38] challenge is to you tonight
[1:35:41] Hallelujah that is so do you want to be
[1:35:44] strong amen do you want to be courageous
[1:35:47] do you want this to just be
[1:35:48] entertainment and you know oh man we you
[1:35:51] know somebody was healed the other day
[1:35:52] we had tongues and interpretation it's
[1:35:53] so amazing like all of these things the
[1:35:56] signs and wonders are happening in our
[1:35:57] church and man I just love to come and
[1:36:00] and and Worship the Lord we had such a
[1:36:01] good song service and then the Lord
[1:36:03] healed people wow it was amazing man you
[1:36:07] know and I mean and I get to do this
[1:36:11] three times three times a week two times
[1:36:12] a week two times a week for only 10% of
[1:36:15] my
[1:36:16] salary price of admission you know I
[1:36:19] mean it's cheap
[1:36:21] tickets to our Godly
[1:36:25] entertainment think seriously now is
[1:36:28] this what we're doing are we in
[1:36:29] wandering mindset that I just wander I
[1:36:31] don't really do anything I don't really
[1:36:32] participate in anything I'm not trying
[1:36:34] to be strong I'm not diving into the
[1:36:36] word of God I'm not actively
[1:36:38] participating I'm just letting
[1:36:39] mediocrity to find my way that is so
[1:36:42] good that is so good and so there we are
[1:36:45] so I need to move on because I'm
[1:36:47] combining two sermons into one so we
[1:36:48] need to get on to be very courageous
[1:36:50] because I think I've made the point
[1:36:52] generally about being strong
[1:36:55] and so now I want to make some points on
[1:36:57] on being
[1:36:58] courageous um
[1:37:01] here so let's go back
[1:37:05] to this uh well we read this quote we're
[1:37:08] no longer in
[1:37:10] Egypt uh we're in the now we're in the
[1:37:12] wilderness um yeah and let's here we're
[1:37:17] ready now the church is to my opinion in
[1:37:20] the spiritual stand to enter in on the
[1:37:23] third scene and that's the scene we're
[1:37:25] actually you know the promised land is
[1:37:27] the third scene here and and we found
[1:37:29] out they needed healing and they had a
[1:37:31] doctor with them that was Dr Moses they
[1:37:34] found out they needed healing because
[1:37:37] now they've come out of the Wilderness
[1:37:39] and what what is some of the things they
[1:37:40] needed healing for it's like well what
[1:37:42] did they need healing because Dr Moses
[1:37:44] was with them now okay they needed
[1:37:46] healing when they when they sinned and
[1:37:48] they they made God angry and he sent the
[1:37:50] serpents amongst them and and and Dr
[1:37:52] Moses put a on a pole and whoever looked
[1:37:55] on it you know lived and was healed but
[1:37:58] but the Bible also says that their shoes
[1:37:59] never were were out and their clothes
[1:38:03] you know that that the that that that
[1:38:05] God was with them and God kept them and
[1:38:07] God God sustained them through the
[1:38:09] Wilderness way what healing did they
[1:38:10] need here we
[1:38:12] go what healing did they need what was
[1:38:15] it about it so we can come back here
[1:38:18] through well oh my yes well there was a
[1:38:21] group that came out of Egypt with Moses
[1:38:23] that they were here kind of at the start
[1:38:25] of things um but they're not with us
[1:38:28] anymore they all died after wandering in
[1:38:30] the wilderness there's another group
[1:38:32] that came out of Egypt with them under
[1:38:33] Moses but they were under 20 years old
[1:38:35] and Children of the children under 20
[1:38:36] and Children of the children children of
[1:38:39] children of those under 20
[1:38:42] yes so just I just want you to think for
[1:38:45] a moment I want you to put yourselves in
[1:38:47] the shoes and and and I was aided in
[1:38:50] this I read a a book of short stories um
[1:38:53] they biblical stories um and and the the
[1:38:56] author took kind of fun angles to view a
[1:39:00] story from you know um maybe you've uh
[1:39:03] you know adventures and odyssey does
[1:39:05] that sometimes I don't know if that's
[1:39:06] still a thing these days but you know
[1:39:08] you you you enter into a story and you
[1:39:09] see it from a different angle than maybe
[1:39:11] the Bible is presenting it just to kind
[1:39:13] of think through the scenario and put
[1:39:15] yourselves in shoes and so this this
[1:39:17] this author took this story of Kadesh
[1:39:19] barnea from from the son of one of the
[1:39:23] 10
[1:39:24] spies and so if you think about this
[1:39:27] from from that perspective for a moment
[1:39:28] so so your dad goes your dad goes and he
[1:39:32] spies out the promised land and you're
[1:39:33] so excited like man my dad you know he
[1:39:35] was he you know you went and talk told
[1:39:37] your buddies like hey my dad got to be
[1:39:39] one of the spies yeah yeah real secret
[1:39:42] stuff you know and he's you know he's
[1:39:45] INF infiltrating you know with theme
[1:39:48] music into the promised land coming back
[1:39:51] with grapes like this is you know it's
[1:39:52] awesome man and then they come back and
[1:39:55] the spies come back and they realize oh
[1:39:56] my goodness the buzz just goes out you
[1:39:59] know from from the Tabernacle outward
[1:40:00] into the camp you know and it's like oh
[1:40:02] my goodness the spies are back and
[1:40:04] everybody's like they don't have to blow
[1:40:05] a trumpet you know they just it just it
[1:40:07] just flies you know through conversation
[1:40:09] the spies are back and everybody just
[1:40:10] gathers you know to hear the report of
[1:40:12] the spies and they're like wow it's an
[1:40:13] amazing like look at the grapes man
[1:40:16] there's this cluster of grapes that's
[1:40:17] you know it's on a pole between Caleb
[1:40:19] and Joshua oh my goodness this I can't
[1:40:22] wait they got grapes that big man this
[1:40:24] is going to be awesome you know and then
[1:40:26] and then the spies begin to give their
[1:40:28] report in Caleb and Joshua man it's a
[1:40:29] great land we can't wait to go take it
[1:40:32] and the other spies are like
[1:40:34] whoa you see those grapes yeah they just
[1:40:37] pop those into their
[1:40:38] mouths they're that big they got
[1:40:44] walls it's bad idea people we can't do
[1:40:47] it and you look at your dad and you're
[1:40:49] like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa and
[1:40:51] you're like your you you start telling
[1:40:52] your friend like I don't know what's up
[1:40:53] with my dad right
[1:40:55] now Caleb and Joshua look cool my dad
[1:41:00] right he's letting me down we you know
[1:41:03] we've been out here we came out of we
[1:41:04] came out of Egypt like we're ready to
[1:41:06] take our promised land no dad Moses said
[1:41:08] we can take the promised land let's go
[1:41:10] take the promised land don't like okay I
[1:41:12] they can be that
[1:41:14] big but then the the 10 spies are like
[1:41:17] no and to convince the
[1:41:19] people it's too hard we can't do it and
[1:41:23] God judges them and says
[1:41:25] anybody at the age of 20 you're going to
[1:41:29] wander well the whole group you're all
[1:41:31] going to wander for 40 more years and
[1:41:33] you're like thanks
[1:41:35] Dad could have been in the promised land
[1:41:38] but you didn't have any faith Dad good
[1:41:41] job appreciate that now I get to wonder
[1:41:45] Dad I just turned 19 yesterday I'm going
[1:41:48] to be 59 when I go to the get to go to
[1:41:51] the promised land
[1:41:53] wow yeah thanks Dad appreciate that and
[1:41:58] the next day and so he's so mad he's in
[1:42:00] they come back to the family tent after
[1:42:02] the meeting and they come back and he's
[1:42:04] just he's just unleashing his rage on
[1:42:06] his dad and and and the next day his dad
[1:42:10] dies can you imagine now you've
[1:42:12] unleashed your dad uh your rage maybe
[1:42:14] appropriately on on your father you know
[1:42:16] for his lack of faith and then probably
[1:42:18] be respectful young people but you know
[1:42:20] we just saying you could understand and
[1:42:22] and and and 59 is you know he's getting
[1:42:25] up there to enter the promised land when
[1:42:26] you're
[1:42:27] 19 and and and you know but then your
[1:42:30] dad dies the next day and your last
[1:42:32] conversation with him was one of quite a
[1:42:35] bit of
[1:42:35] anger because your dad was one of the 10
[1:42:38] spies and they all died the next day and
[1:42:40] so you're like oh man now you're filled
[1:42:42] with guilt because you yelled at your
[1:42:43] dad who you actually loved you were just
[1:42:45] mad at and you know was complex emotions
[1:42:47] and now you're you're dealing with a lot
[1:42:50] and you can't resolve that because now
[1:42:51] he's dead but can you imagine this
[1:42:54] second generation now this is who they
[1:42:55] are they have to deal with we get to you
[1:42:57] know we get to like through the prime of
[1:42:59] our life we get to wander through the
[1:43:03] Wilderness because of a lack of faith
[1:43:06] because they because they didn't because
[1:43:08] bless God they didn't what they didn't
[1:43:10] do is they didn't follow the prophet
[1:43:12] like they should have they should have
[1:43:14] adhered to what the prophet had to say
[1:43:17] and so man as they grew up they're like
[1:43:19] no what did Moses say bless God that's
[1:43:22] what we're doing cuz we're going to take
[1:43:23] a promised land and I don't want my
[1:43:25] children to have to wander for 40 more
[1:43:27] years like I did so I going to believe
[1:43:30] what the prophet said there you go yes
[1:43:35] sir and there's a lot of nuance in all
[1:43:38] of that cuz some of you noticed like the
[1:43:41] change in my voice and you know the
[1:43:43] different tone and characteristic that
[1:43:46] came out and some of you are laughing at
[1:43:49] that
[1:43:50] and right because this next group the
[1:43:53] third group was the children of that
[1:43:55] second group who had the first group as
[1:43:59] their
[1:44:00] grandparents like imagine now put
[1:44:02] yourself in these people like okay we
[1:44:04] can see the second group like that's
[1:44:07] okay yeah man bless God follow the
[1:44:08] prophet but then now you're teaching
[1:44:10] your children bless God we're going to
[1:44:12] follow what Moses said we're going to a
[1:44:14] promised land and they grew up in the
[1:44:17] wilderness and so you're like follow the
[1:44:19] prophet to the promised land and you're
[1:44:21] like what was the promised land again
[1:44:22] I'm just kind of confused cuz all I know
[1:44:24] is
[1:44:26] sand come on it doesn't
[1:44:29] matter that's it look the promised land
[1:44:32] doesn't matter to you if you can't
[1:44:33] follow the
[1:44:36] prophet that's I mean is that is that
[1:44:39] wrong
[1:44:40] well yeah no
[1:44:43] yeah it's
[1:44:46] complex does this seem like like I'm
[1:44:50] talking about the children of Israel in
[1:44:52] the wilderness or does this seem a
[1:44:54] little too close to home
[1:44:56] today here we
[1:44:58] go and so then you have this fourth
[1:45:00] generation and the fourth generation has
[1:45:02] the third generation his parents and the
[1:45:05] second generation his grandparents and
[1:45:07] the third generation his parents is like
[1:45:08] yeah you know okay dad was a little
[1:45:10] extra but we should follow the prophet
[1:45:12] well that's what's right you know but
[1:45:14] I'm just trying to be a little more
[1:45:15] chill than Dad you know and you know
[1:45:21] and you know so
[1:45:25] uh I don't know what to tell you son
[1:45:28] because you know I'm trying to find
[1:45:31] balance myself and so because I'm trying
[1:45:33] to struggle with the balance because I
[1:45:35] had number two as my dad I'm not I'm I'm
[1:45:38] struggling myself and so I have to
[1:45:41] parent you I just you should love
[1:45:46] Jesus that is so good that is so good
[1:45:50] and if this isn't like like all I'm
[1:45:52] doing is I'm talking about the children
[1:45:53] of Israel I don't know who you people
[1:45:54] are thinking
[1:45:59] about ah it's so close to home though
[1:46:03] right but brother brandham exactly types
[1:46:06] this for us and he he tells us exactly
[1:46:08] this is what's going on is Egypt is a
[1:46:10] type of denomination and we have a
[1:46:12] prophet and to to to and to listen to
[1:46:14] The Prophet to take us into a promised
[1:46:16] land and we have these same generations
[1:46:19] and we have brother Bram talks about old
[1:46:20] Fighters and we have you know all of
[1:46:22] these we have the same generational
[1:46:25] shift in in and and and brother Bram
[1:46:27] talks about but in the fourth generation
[1:46:29] and the Embers are are are just just
[1:46:32] down to a little bit of a flame and we
[1:46:34] have to recognize I don't I don't know
[1:46:35] where you are on
[1:46:37] this I don't know which generation that
[1:46:40] you feel you might be in you know I'm
[1:46:43] somewhere in two and three I can tell
[1:46:45] you I can tell you I'm somewhere in
[1:46:46] there myself but what I can tell you is
[1:46:48] is teaching Sunday school at the Brenham
[1:46:50] Tabernacle I had the great-grandson of
[1:46:52] of major word Prophet so hey uh that's
[1:46:55] four generations you know and he's
[1:46:57] probably mid 20s now right so so now we
[1:47:00] can see where we're at and where where
[1:47:02] we can we can begin to look at this and
[1:47:04] place that and so brother brandom says
[1:47:06] and we find out they needed a healing
[1:47:08] yeah yeah they needed a healing why not
[1:47:11] because their feet had calluses and not
[1:47:14] because they you know no because because
[1:47:16] this this very
[1:47:19] natural very very
[1:47:21] natural to situation was upon them
[1:47:26] generation one their definition was not
[1:47:28] Egypt generation 2 their definition was
[1:47:30] not Egypt but just follow a a prophet
[1:47:32] Generation 3 is born in the wilderness
[1:47:36] had a dad told me to follow the prophet
[1:47:37] it seems like that's right want to
[1:47:39] believe dad but you know just trying to
[1:47:41] figure out all of this on my own and how
[1:47:44] to parent my own children and then my
[1:47:46] children and I'm trying to you know find
[1:47:48] out what's the reality and what what to
[1:47:50] bring to them and not to be like Grandpa
[1:47:53] not to be you know
[1:47:56] but and so we got to start recognizing
[1:47:59] this concept because how we parent how
[1:48:03] we relate to our
[1:48:04] parents how we relate to our
[1:48:07] grandparents
[1:48:09] understanding that these are very
[1:48:11] natural things and if you were in any
[1:48:13] one of these groups you would be the
[1:48:15] same way yeah that's right are you the
[1:48:19] way I've described in the group that you
[1:48:20] find yourself in well hey guess what
[1:48:23] you'll probably
[1:48:25] right and if we don't if we don't begin
[1:48:27] to rec like it it is time for us to go
[1:48:29] and claim our Promised Land but we find
[1:48:31] we need a healing we need a healing we
[1:48:34] need to begin to recognize where we at
[1:48:36] and where we're I began to present this
[1:48:38] to a Sunday school group and one of the
[1:48:39] young men started said and I started
[1:48:41] doing this and I said and that fourth
[1:48:43] generation they you know they just want
[1:48:46] all they want to know is is like hey can
[1:48:48] we get you know the two the two
[1:48:49] generations in front of me can they can
[1:48:51] I just not have to deal with their
[1:48:52] issues
[1:48:53] and he looked at me he said stop
[1:48:55] describing me and I was like
[1:48:58] wow wow okay we're we're on something
[1:49:01] here and so we find they needed the
[1:49:04] healing because this this is
[1:49:06] happening and it's very natural but we
[1:49:09] need a healing we need to understand
[1:49:11] where we're at where our where our
[1:49:13] parents are at our grandparents who we
[1:49:15] are and how we find ourselves and our
[1:49:16] parents you know parents need to
[1:49:18] understand their children may not
[1:49:20] understand what Egypt is they may not
[1:49:22] get name I talk about this all the time
[1:49:24] we got brother Hoover at our church and
[1:49:25] he came out of a United Pentecostal
[1:49:27] church I don't know if you all know him
[1:49:28] but you know tall taller older brother
[1:49:31] and and have you had him here before
[1:49:32] yeah okay so brother Hoover and you know
[1:49:34] you may remember him and you know and I
[1:49:37] start preaching on coming out of
[1:49:38] denominations at our church and brother
[1:49:40] Hoover is one of the deacons so he's in
[1:49:41] the back and I mean his his long arms go
[1:49:44] up and he just starts pacing behind you
[1:49:46] know in the back doors like oh
[1:49:48] Hallelujah and he's just you know and
[1:49:50] and I just think you know what there's
[1:49:51] there's three and four generation this
[1:49:53] this third group and fourth group they
[1:49:55] can look back at him and go what is his
[1:49:57] deal man like he gets so happy about
[1:50:01] that come out of denomination stuff and
[1:50:03] it just doesn't do it for me I mean you
[1:50:05] know hey there might be things brother
[1:50:06] Trevor says that I like but but coming
[1:50:08] out of you know but but when God pulled
[1:50:10] me out of denomination just you know
[1:50:11] it's just not this is not doing it for
[1:50:13] me I just don't get excited that God
[1:50:16] called me out of
[1:50:17] denominations cuz I don't know what
[1:50:20] Egypt
[1:50:21] is we've been delivered out of Egypt
[1:50:23] well that's great I never was there born
[1:50:26] right here in the sand in the
[1:50:29] wilderness right and we've got to
[1:50:31] recognize the differences that we have
[1:50:32] and we've got to be able to think each
[1:50:33] other's thoughts so that we can have
[1:50:35] this healing that we absolutely need
[1:50:38] amen and so so that we can come to a
[1:50:40] place where where where we recognize um
[1:50:44] who we are you know what our what our
[1:50:47] experiences are and and and and what God
[1:50:50] can do in our lives but these things
[1:50:54] things like dealing with this is not
[1:51:00] easy because there's some deep seated
[1:51:03] life hurts going on here and guess what
[1:51:06] you're going to have to be in order to
[1:51:08] get over some of these things very
[1:51:12] courageous that is so good healing
[1:51:16] requires
[1:51:19] courage absolutely requires courage I
[1:51:21] don't have enough time to go my
[1:51:22] testimony about you know about about
[1:51:25] having to come into a healing but I I
[1:51:27] can just say that I went through a time
[1:51:28] I went through two years of of very
[1:51:30] chronic pain because of something going
[1:51:32] on in my neck and and and um and and and
[1:51:35] finally ended up having surgery but but
[1:51:38] what what God taught me through that you
[1:51:39] know um is
[1:51:43] well first of all let's let's let's just
[1:51:47] because I love these two statements not
[1:51:50] bondage is not freedom and we talked
[1:51:52] about that when we talked about strength
[1:51:55] and we talked about coming out of Egypt
[1:51:56] just because they weren't in bondage
[1:51:58] doesn't mean they were in they were
[1:51:59] actually free right but in the same
[1:52:02] way not feeling is not healing so as I'm
[1:52:07] dealing with this thing this what
[1:52:08] brought this idea to my mind is is I'm
[1:52:10] dealing with this problem with my neck
[1:52:11] and I'm going to the pain you know I had
[1:52:13] a few of the epidural shots in my neck
[1:52:15] to try to get the swelling down and
[1:52:16] things like that and and um um because I
[1:52:19] had a ruptured disc and and so we're
[1:52:22] trying to to get healing from that
[1:52:23] trying to trying to avoid surgery trying
[1:52:25] to do physical therapy and and um and
[1:52:28] and and so another thing they they were
[1:52:30] like okay well there's this other thing
[1:52:31] we can do and so why don't you come in
[1:52:33] we'll test you and if you pass these
[1:52:35] tests then you're eligible for this
[1:52:36] other thing and it's like okay I'm in
[1:52:37] pain that'd be nice let's do whatever
[1:52:39] the you know whatever it is okay and so
[1:52:41] they said okay so what we need you to do
[1:52:43] what this is is we're going to inject
[1:52:44] you in these little spots and then if
[1:52:46] you have any relief at all you have to
[1:52:48] note that down even if it's 5 minutes or
[1:52:50] 30 seconds you've got to note that down
[1:52:52] and tell us because then you'll eligible
[1:52:53] to get the insurance to have this thing
[1:52:55] done and so then what we can do is we
[1:52:57] can you know we can burn your nerve
[1:52:59] endings so you won't feel the pain
[1:53:02] anymore you know you know and I you know
[1:53:04] it's like your face you know your
[1:53:06] shirt's off your face down you know
[1:53:07] they're about to with needles over
[1:53:09] hovering over your back you know and
[1:53:11] you're like you know you know your your
[1:53:13] first reaction is like what you know
[1:53:15] it's like which is a bad idea and so so
[1:53:17] don't do that with needles over top of
[1:53:19] you you know and I was like hang on H
[1:53:20] you know I was like and I was like
[1:53:22] you're gonna you're gonna burn my
[1:53:24] perfectly good nerve
[1:53:27] endings so you're you're gonna make me
[1:53:30] worse so that I don't
[1:53:34] feel this sounds like a bad deal like I
[1:53:37] I I'm probably not you know okay it's
[1:53:40] like do the thing and I'll tell you but
[1:53:43] uh I'm probably not coming back for that
[1:53:45] and so they but it gave me no relief so
[1:53:47] it didn't matter but but I was like I
[1:53:51] was like no no no no no just be like you
[1:53:53] can take away the feeling of pain but
[1:53:56] that doesn't mean I'm
[1:53:57] Healed and there's too often we seek to
[1:54:00] remove the feeling of pain because it's
[1:54:03] easier I can go to the doctor and have
[1:54:04] him burn away my perfectly good nerve
[1:54:06] endings but if I'm actually if I decide
[1:54:09] to be very courageous though I can do
[1:54:12] the work that needs to be done to get to
[1:54:14] the healing
[1:54:16] point and God and God and and and what
[1:54:19] God showed me through this whole thing
[1:54:20] because I had a brother telling me like
[1:54:21] hey man you need to confess it and I was
[1:54:23] like you think I don't know that like no
[1:54:25] no no no like you know like you're
[1:54:28] treating me like I can actually in my
[1:54:31] pain State I can actually take the word
[1:54:33] of God do meditate on it do all that it
[1:54:38] says to do like confess my healing like
[1:54:41] brother brandham talks about and and and
[1:54:44] and that I'm going to be healed like
[1:54:46] like you're acting like I'm a real
[1:54:48] believer who's going to actually do what
[1:54:51] God asked asked me to do no no no no you
[1:54:54] don't understand that's fine for church
[1:54:58] but I'm in
[1:54:59] pain I'm in pain no no no no I'll just
[1:55:02] come and do the church thing you pray
[1:55:04] for me because I'm in pain yeah there
[1:55:06] you go don't ask me while I'm hurt to
[1:55:09] have to be
[1:55:12] spiritual uhuh it don't work that way I
[1:55:15] can't do that I'm in
[1:55:20] pain I don't want to I don't I want to
[1:55:22] confess to people that I'm Healed are
[1:55:25] you kidding me I'm standing here look
[1:55:26] like this I'm like yeah and like there's
[1:55:30] this pain face going on that I can't
[1:55:32] even replicate right now like I'm I'm in
[1:55:34] pain like you I don't want to go
[1:55:36] like ow thank the Lord for healing me
[1:55:39] you doing fine yep just fine no problems
[1:55:42] you know any problems with your neck
[1:55:44] nope nope no problems
[1:55:47] just spent four hours on the heating pad
[1:55:50] last night no problems I'm Healed in
[1:55:51] Jesus name I I didn't want to do
[1:55:55] that I didn't want to participate in my
[1:55:57] own healing I just wanted God to come
[1:55:59] and heal I just wanted my healing to
[1:56:01] look like
[1:56:08] this
[1:56:15] yeah you're
[1:56:19] healed and then there's zero courage in
[1:56:21] my life
[1:56:23] I'm never I've never gained and I tell
[1:56:25] you what God has courage oh yes God has
[1:56:28] courage to face nothingness and Proclaim
[1:56:30] light into it woo come on somebody God
[1:56:34] has courage to look into nothingness and
[1:56:36] to speak light into existence then I
[1:56:38] think then I thank you brother Ben then
[1:56:40] I think we can we can have the courage
[1:56:43] to face the problems and the Blackness
[1:56:45] and the Darkness and the issues that we
[1:56:47] face and I I get it I've been there I
[1:56:49] know it's hard and I didn't want to do
[1:56:51] it but God used that situation to to to
[1:56:54] to say Trevor what you need is some
[1:56:56] courage to do what the word of God says
[1:56:59] to do
[1:57:01] Hallelujah Hall and if I learned that
[1:57:04] and developed courage in my own life
[1:57:07] then the neck problems and the pain that
[1:57:09] I faced for two years was completely
[1:57:12] worth it because it took took a preacher
[1:57:14] who just thought you know Church stuff
[1:57:16] is just church stuff but when you get
[1:57:18] impacted in life you know well hey now
[1:57:21] other Church people can help
[1:57:25] me and he
[1:57:27] exposed the problems in my own heart in
[1:57:31] my own faith and so so he asked me said
[1:57:35] come up higher why don't you ask like no
[1:57:37] no we don't compartmentalize Church
[1:57:40] stuff and healing when when when
[1:57:42] everything's fine and when you're at
[1:57:44] church but it doesn't impact actual life
[1:57:47] no this is for all of your life and so
[1:57:51] if the word of God can do that then the
[1:57:53] word of God can do that in you and and
[1:57:55] through your lips as well you can speak
[1:57:58] Let There light be light and there can
[1:58:00] be light you can speak healing and there
[1:58:02] will be and it doesn't always happen
[1:58:05] right now but God is working in you that
[1:58:08] courage he's not picking you up from
[1:58:10] here to there and doing it but he's
[1:58:12] allowing you to face courageously the
[1:58:15] issues that are facing your own life and
[1:58:17] I was I was I've been I've been uh I've
[1:58:19] been working with a sister we've been
[1:58:21] we've been doing a lot of counseling and
[1:58:22] she had gotten to a very low place in
[1:58:24] her life and a lot of issues and a lot
[1:58:26] of you know a lot of things that she was
[1:58:28] running to to numb her pain to burn the
[1:58:32] nerve endings and she'd gotten so used
[1:58:34] to doing this and I was I'm just talking
[1:58:36] it's like you've got to rest this you've
[1:58:38] got to stop this cycle and but there's
[1:58:40] so many sins and so many problems I'm
[1:58:42] like I don't care about the
[1:58:44] sins don't I don't even want you to
[1:58:46] repent to the sins the sins aren't the
[1:58:48] problem it's like what what do you mean
[1:58:50] the sins AR the of course sins are the
[1:58:51] problem sins are the problem of
[1:58:53] everything no you need
[1:58:55] healing you need to face your problems
[1:58:58] courageously and well well there's so
[1:59:00] many of them like I don't want you to do
[1:59:01] all of them find the smallest one and
[1:59:05] courageously face that one and get over
[1:59:08] that one it's say well should I Repent
[1:59:10] then no I don't care about repentance
[1:59:12] yet let God heal you God knows that the
[1:59:15] problem that the things that you're
[1:59:17] doing are are are medications for the
[1:59:19] healing that the it's the healing is the
[1:59:21] thing
[1:59:22] and I know that God has done something
[1:59:25] in your life and if you face these
[1:59:27] things courageously you'll come out of
[1:59:29] your Wilderness mindset that's all you
[1:59:31] are you're doing Wilderness
[1:59:33] stuff hallelujah what is repentance
[1:59:36] repentance is stop doing Wilderness
[1:59:40] stuff hallah you can say you're sorry
[1:59:43] 50,000 times but repentance
[1:59:47] is you
[1:59:49] know this wandering
[1:59:52] right that's so good I hate my life I do
[1:59:56] so many wandering things like God must
[1:59:59] hate me cuz I wander all the time like
[2:00:01] well

[2:00:06] yeah just I don't know how to face those
[2:00:10] giants this is a
[2:00:13] metaphor till someday you decide you

[2:00:17] that's my Promised
[2:00:20] Land I'm going to stop wandering

[2:01:05] reason right but she courageously fac
[2:01:08] them small one by one and took care of

[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:06] per what a perspective amen I make you
[2:25:09] say Amen tonight what a perspective
[2:25:13] Hallelujah you
[2:25:17] know brother Bram was on his way back to
[2:25:22] Jeffersonville to preach the message The
[2:25:25] Trail Of The
[2:25:28] Serpent and I can tell you that message
[2:25:31] was preached right there's not a message
[2:25:34] you'll find by that title but that
[2:25:36] message was preached because this
[2:25:38] message which is none other than Jesus
[2:25:40] Christ has took the cover off of the
[2:25:46] enemy and what I love about it is as the
[2:25:49] word keeps on coming down it takes the
[2:25:52] cover we can read where brother B says
[2:25:55] Satan wants to discredit the word and he
[2:26:00] would like to destroy the church and he
[2:26:03] said he'll always be at that until he's
[2:26:05] thrown in the Lake of
[2:26:07] Fire and you know one of the things and
[2:26:10] the ways to do that and one of the ways
[2:26:13] he'll try is not just to tell you or I
[2:26:16] that it's not for us but he likes to
[2:26:20] take that in a way and have some Mirage
[2:26:23] painted up like what brother Trevor I'll
[2:26:25] tell you I don't think we'll ever get
[2:26:27] that out of our mind we may have laugh
[2:26:28] but that was true amen that's not how
[2:26:32] God
[2:26:33] operates right God's operate is that his
[2:26:37] word would become so alive in our hearts
[2:26:41] and and you know how it does that when
[2:26:42] we talk about the word behav preeminence
[2:26:45] it starts
[2:26:46] with you let the word you let the word
[2:26:49] come in
[2:26:51] it'll start out like a little white
[2:26:52] button but it'll
[2:26:54] grow you keep taking the word of God and
[2:26:57] giving ourselves to the word it is not
[2:27:00] about our feelings there's going to be
[2:27:02] times where you don't feel like a
[2:27:03] Christian you feel like God's A Million
[2:27:05] Miles Away their feelings we've said it
[2:27:07] we've heard it over and over that has
[2:27:09] nothing to do with it right it's taking
[2:27:12] God's word and there listen there is no
[2:27:15] other place in this world I'm not
[2:27:17] preaching but there's no other word that
[2:27:20] there's no other place in this world
[2:27:21] where there's any other certainty right
[2:27:24] I don't care you can take a politician
[2:27:25] that says I'm going to do X Y and Z when
[2:27:27] I get in the office that's not certain
[2:27:30] there's one thing and only one thing
[2:27:33] that is certain and that's the word of
[2:27:34] God Amen there's only one thing like God
[2:27:38] brought us here in this Simplicity to
[2:27:40] think about it you and I it's not
[2:27:42] something that's a a pipe dream the
[2:27:44] prophet tell us it's not a pipe dream
[2:27:45] it's right here and you know what you
[2:27:48] don't have to wait till you have a
[2:27:49] certain feeling do you have a certain
[2:27:51] sensation to get in the word of God
[2:27:53] because it's the word of God you get in
[2:27:55] the word of God because it's what God
[2:27:56] has said and that word will have an
[2:27:59] effect it has transforming power within
[2:28:03] it I tell you what what God has done
[2:28:06] here once again tonight he's come by and
[2:28:09] this is just something that he'll do
[2:28:11] right there in our services when he
[2:28:13] comes right by just like when brother
[2:28:15] Nathaniel's standing there and
[2:28:16] ministering the word comes through and
[2:28:18] it breathes a courage into our
[2:28:22] hearts but it wasn't something as just
[2:28:25] like a wind that passes through oh man
[2:28:27] that was a nice wind no God did that
[2:28:29] purposely yes he did he may have had a
[2:28:33] minister that he looked at a quote
[2:28:34] looked at a scripture and he's thinking
[2:28:36] I don't know where this even fits but
[2:28:38] that's good that's wonderful I don't
[2:28:40] know where it fits many times I don't
[2:28:41] know where and you're and all of a
[2:28:43] sudden in the middle of ministering God
[2:28:45] will drop a thought and that will be
[2:28:48] given you know why God reserved that
[2:28:50] because he knew you and I had need of it
[2:28:53] and it's God God strengthening you and I
[2:28:55] encouraging us to say keep
[2:28:57] pressing keep pressing be strong be
[2:29:01] courageous keep pressing so the Mirage
[2:29:04] that Satan wants to wants to point out
[2:29:07] is that you know he he'll like to take
[2:29:09] the word that we have it's a glorious
[2:29:11] bride man it's an invincible Army my but
[2:29:15] we don't want his spin on the word we
[2:29:19] don't want Satan spin it's an invincible
[2:29:22] Army by a person and people who are
[2:29:25] yielded to an invincible
[2:29:28] God see it takes away the mirages
[2:29:31] because we get to looking at things that
[2:29:32] that that's not true that Mirage is not
[2:29:34] true in the way that Satan's presenting
[2:29:36] it but it is true in that God being God
[2:29:41] through you and
[2:29:43] me I'll tell you you talking about
[2:29:46] Redemption you talking about power is
[2:29:48] that God himself
[2:29:50] not only what he did through the Lord
[2:29:52] Jesus Christ but then to come into you
[2:29:54] and I who were born in sin and shaped in
[2:29:57] iniquity and the power of redemption to
[2:29:59] take a hold of our life and for that
[2:30:01] word to work in our life you talking
[2:30:03] about you know you and I if we could
[2:30:06] just even get a glimpse and I believe
[2:30:08] that's what God has done not only
[2:30:10] tonight but he's done it in every one of
[2:30:13] your services our services and is God
[2:30:15] himself stepping back and he's looking
[2:30:19] at his victory in our lives his victory
[2:30:23] that's what Calvary brought to you and I
[2:30:26] it released his victory to you and I
[2:30:29] that you and I might walk in Victory and
[2:30:31] to be able to think about that he's
[2:30:33] looking he's looking at the product of
[2:30:36] what his blood has purchased he's seeing
[2:30:39] the effect of his word in our lives oh
[2:30:42] my I believe he's pleased yes I believe
[2:30:46] he's pleased his presence not only
[2:30:49] coming down to speak to us but it's to
[2:30:51] encourage us keep making
[2:30:55] footsteps keep going forward there's no

[2:31:05] example with Benjamin here tonight
[2:31:07] applying to Healing bringing it down

[2:31:21] haven't wanted to go there it's like one
[2:31:23] of those places you don't want nobody to
[2:31:24] touch in your life but you realize God
