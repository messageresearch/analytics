[11:02] morning an uplifted hand
[11:04] amen let's just go together with our
[11:05] brother
[11:06] [Music]
[11:13] a couple weekends ago I went down to
[11:16] Tennessee to brother Donnie's for their
[11:18] meetings and uh
[11:20] he was having a prayer line and it was
[11:22] it was quite lengthy and
[11:26] even uh at one time brother Donnie had
[11:29] actually even passed out and he was on
[11:31] the front they were giving him oxygen
[11:33] and stuff and a couple of other
[11:35] ministers were
[11:37] also very exhausted so they at the end
[11:40] they took them in the back and they're
[11:41] kind of all over the place another
[11:43] brother Ron Spencer was taking oxygen
[11:45] brother Donahue was uh taking oxygen
[11:49] stuff and they were just kind of laying
[11:50] around and my brother Donnie got his his
[11:53] breath back he uh
[11:54] looked around at the other brothers and
[11:56] he said just think we're the victors he
[11:59] said just imagine what hell's going
[12:01] through right now so
[12:03] sometimes Victory doesn't look exactly
[12:05] like what we think Victory looked at
[12:07] like
[12:09] you just think this morning how many
[12:11] carefully laid plans brother the the
[12:14] Satan head to try to keep you from being
[12:17] here but we're here we're still standing
[12:20] so
[12:21] sometimes uh that's what victory looks
[12:24] like that we can't see but uh
[12:27] I just uh love the Lord and just think
[12:30] from for all he's he's done for us and
[12:32] it we're still here we're still standing
[12:34] so let's just go before the Lord in
[12:37] prayer
[12:38] dear Lord Jesus we just come before you
[12:40] in prayer Lord and we just uh just want
[12:43] to take these requests Lord
[12:45] before you Lord each and every one just
[12:47] a serious needs Lord
[12:50] I read and
[12:52] in a book of Psalms where it where it
[12:54] says where Satan is pursuing your bride
[12:57] at the end but
[12:58] it says right before his time of Victory
[13:00] he stumbles and falls and it just
[13:04] kind of begs the question of who put the
[13:06] stumbling block in his way to make him
[13:09] stumble
[13:10] and it just seems Lord that maybe before
[13:14] the foundation of the world Lord you
[13:15] knew what was coming up and you would
[13:17] put put that there at that time just
[13:21] when it seemed like he was going to get
[13:22] victory
[13:23] but you had that in front of him to
[13:26] where he would stumble and fall in each
[13:27] one of these sometimes it seems like
[13:29] we're surrounded
[13:30] and seems like that Satan's got the
[13:32] upper hand Lord but you're in control
[13:35] Lord you can put a stumbling block in
[13:37] front of him at any time you can call a
[13:40] timeout you can
[13:42] do anything Lord that you want to and so
[13:45] it's just for us to rest and relax in
[13:48] you that you have everything in control
[13:50] and
[13:51] lord it's it's you that we look to We
[13:54] Trust in and we believe in Lord we just
[13:56] we just thank you Lord that we can look
[13:58] to you
[14:00] in times of
[14:01] of sorrow in times of Doubt Lord and in
[14:05] times of need Lord just knowing Lord
[14:08] that your your hand is Never Too Short
[14:10] Lord and you have Lord you know the end
[14:12] from the beginning you have all things
[14:14] in control Lord so we just commit these
[14:17] prayer requests Lord and into your hands
[14:19] Lord Commit This service into your hands
[14:21] Lord and just pray for brother Jerry
[14:23] Lord just to be able to get himself out
[14:24] of the way Lord and just just anoint
[14:27] Lord and use that gift Lord that you've
[14:29] placed within him you placed that there
[14:31] for the benefit of the body Lord so we
[14:33] just want to pull on that gift Lord and
[14:35] just allow you to Lord operate that gift

[34:43] a bottle art right over a month ago and
[34:45] she suffered there with a stroke but God
[34:48] is mindful God is merciful amen and uh
[34:51] you know and I know Sister Doris
[34:54] wouldn't mind me saying this but she
[34:56] said when the first time I went to see
[34:57] her she said you know what she said I
[34:59] believe that devil was getting got upset
[35:01] she said because I was coming back to
[35:03] church
[35:04] I said absolutely the enemy don't want
[35:07] to he'll contest every every promise and
[35:10] everything you know so when we're being
[35:12] contested you know you're doing what God
[35:13] wants you to do and then fight against
[35:16] it and press on so we just we thank God
[35:19] for that and want to continue to
[35:20] remember our sister in prayer we have um
[35:24] a dedication here this morning and I
[35:27] want to as
[35:28] just in a few moments as sister Carmen
[35:31] she's going to bring
[35:32] Little Caesar here to just dedicate him
[35:35] to the Lord it just really pressed upon
[35:36] her heart and many of you know our
[35:39] sister Carmen there is ministering there
[35:42] and taking care of Little Caesar
[35:45] behalf of other family and so
[35:48] she wants to dedicate him to the Lord
[35:49] and I think that's a tremendous thing
[35:52] you know I look at the scripture when
[35:54] they brought little children to him the
[35:56] Bible says
[35:57] that he should put his hands
[36:00] on them
[36:01] I'll tell you if there's anybody I want
[36:04] their hands on my kids it's Jesus
[36:08] the world wants to put their hands all
[36:10] over them
[36:11] can you hear me the government and
[36:14] schools and everything I don't have
[36:16] nothing against schools but as long as
[36:17] they keep their Lane and stay where they
[36:19] need to stay and keep their hands and
[36:20] their nose out of certain things it'd be
[36:23] all right but if there's one place that
[36:25] we want is to have our hands has his
[36:27] hands put on us
[36:29] and you know the disciples they rebuked
[36:31] him what are you doing you know
[36:33] sometimes the things that we regard as
[36:35] so little or we think is insignificant
[36:37] is very important
[36:39] in the eyes of God
[36:42] and so
[36:44] Jesus goes on to say suffer the little
[36:46] children and forbid them not
[36:48] coming to me for if such is the kingdom
[36:51] of heaven
[36:52] and I think that's that's the real
[36:54] desire
[36:55] McDonald's we dedicate Little Caesar to
[36:58] the Lord but
[36:59] the sister Carmen the desire is just to
[37:02] raise him
[37:03] the admonition to serve the Lord amen
[37:06] and soul let's just join together in a
[37:09] word of Prayer

[39:11] Thursday and
[39:13] following Sunday and I don't know I
[39:15] haven't put the pressure on him for the
[39:17] next Thursday yet or not but
[39:20] I didn't mention it to him I just felt
[39:22] if I said something here pressure might
[39:23] come in a greater way
[39:26] I know he's got to drive but what it is
[39:28] is we appreciate your ministry
[39:32] Construction
[39:35] it's a blessing to us
[39:37] it's a blessing to us
[39:39] so we just want to just invite the
[39:42] prince of the Lord just to continue to
[39:44] move Among Us in a special way
[39:46] if you could as brother Jerry prepares
[39:49] to come I
[39:50] brother Nathan Bryant who was here with
[39:52] us in Memorial Day weekend
[39:54] I just asked if there's a prayer request
[39:56] that you would just continue to remember
[39:58] before the Lord Brother Nathan had just
[40:00] got an update when he was getting home
[40:04] yesterday and that was that his mother
[40:07] she had had cancer everything was free
[40:10] and clear but then some things started
[40:12] to
[40:13] reoccur and after some CT and Bone scans
[40:17] this week they determined that the
[40:19] treatment's no longer effective
[40:21] stronger treatments not even options so
[40:23] they've
[40:25] just had the doctor's advised she's just
[40:28] she stopped all treatment and just
[40:30] accepting pain management but we know as
[40:33] like brother Nathan had said we know
[40:35] that God's able to heal her with or
[40:37] without medical intervention we've got
[40:40] testimonies we don't even have to leave
[40:42] this assembly where God heals stage four
[40:45] cancer
[40:46] you know it wasn't the angel who
[40:48] mentioned cancer
[40:50] it was brother Branham who mentioned
[40:52] cancer to the angel nothing will stand
[40:55] before your prayer and brother Branham
[40:57] asked the angel not even cancer and the
[41:01] angel said not even cancer
[41:04] well I'm I'm thankful in an age when
[41:08] that word in other words when it's
[41:10] spoken fear can can can try to come
[41:15] that's part of the humanity in the side
[41:16] but I'm glad that we've got a strength
[41:19] on the inside a love of God that's able
[41:22] to strengthen Us in that hour and like I
[41:24] said before it's like them beavers that
[41:26] pop up at the fair on that whack-a-mole
[41:28] things can pop up but thank God you got
[41:31] a strength to go get back down get back
[41:33] down get back down I thank God for that
[41:36] aren't you I'm glad there's something
[41:37] deeper than just this this Humanity I'm
[41:41] glad there's something deeper I'm glad
[41:43] he's holding us aren't you amen you love
[41:45] the Lord
[41:46] and let's stand together and let's
[41:49] continue to sing this song that brother
[41:50] Brian was singing
[41:52] something keeps holding me
[41:56] Satan lay before me his Temptations
[42:05] of his desire to steal away
[42:10] my
[42:12] pain
[42:15] but I have found inside
[42:19] a revelation sure
[42:23] [Music]
[42:24] it was the strength I needed to keep me
[42:29] in his grace
[42:33] Jesus keeps holding me
[42:38] every day I see
[42:43] he's helping me
[42:45] to overcome my try
[42:51] he's guided me
[42:54] [Applause]
[42:56] [Music]
[43:02] the reality
[43:04] and Jesus keeps holding me
[43:08] [Music]
[43:11] reality
[43:14] Jesus keeps holding me
[43:20] please
[43:26] praise the Lord good to be here with you
[43:30] and I always enjoy coming here in your
[43:34] wonderful group of people to preach to
[43:37] and it's always easier when the people
[43:40] help you
[43:42] and so uh
[43:45] we
[43:48] we had
[43:49] brother Phil my associate and I we both
[43:53] scheduled to be out of town in Dixon at
[43:56] the same time and I had a another
[43:58] brother that I was asking to come and
[44:00] then he had to do something an expo down
[44:03] in Atlanta so he wasn't able to come
[44:06] then and then I I wasn't able to to get
[44:11] find someone else to fill in at the last
[44:14] moment and so uh and then for the
[44:17] service in Dixon this morning we had to
[44:19] cancel the service and uh
[44:22] the people are going to be tuning in
[44:24] here
[44:25] so I want to say to them if you're
[44:28] tuning in here this morning
[44:30] you've heard this message before but
[44:33] stay tuned in because I've got more to
[44:35] say than I said at home so
[44:38] and I when I preached this before I I
[44:42] gave a warning
[44:44] and I'll give it again because I I'm
[44:47] preaching to myself more than I think
[44:49] I'm preaching to you
[44:51] but I'm going to give a warning this
[44:53] one's going to burn
[44:55] and but it's good
[44:58] that so if you would while you're
[45:00] standing with me turn in your Bibles to
[45:03] Numbers Chapter 11.
[45:05] and we want to read the first three
[45:07] verses of scripture there
[45:21] and when the people complained
[45:24] and that's what I want to title this
[45:26] message this morning
[45:28] and when the people complained it
[45:30] displeased the Lord and the Lord heard
[45:33] it and his anger was kindled and the
[45:35] fire of the Lord burned among them and
[45:37] it consumed them that were in the
[45:39] uttermost parts of the camp
[45:41] and the people cried into Moses and when
[45:44] Moses prayed unto the Lord the fire was
[45:46] quenched and he called the name of the
[45:48] place tavarah because the fire of the
[45:51] Lord burned among them you may be seated
[45:56] when you take a look at Israel and
[46:00] that's who we're looking at this morning
[46:01] and we realized they had been in bondage
[46:05] for 400 years in Egypt
[46:07] and right there at the end of their
[46:10] bondage things got worse
[46:13] and you know Pharaoh told him all right
[46:17] your Talia bricks is going to increase
[46:19] but you're going to have to get your own
[46:22] straw to make the bricks and and uh so
[46:26] you know the task Masters really cracked
[46:28] down on them and things just kept
[46:30] getting worse
[46:31] and uh you know if you remember they
[46:35] came to Egypt because of a famine in the
[46:37] land
[46:38] and Joseph was a leader in Egypt at that
[46:43] time and so uh he had favor with the
[46:47] Pharaoh that was on the throne but then
[46:49] the Bible tells us that if Pharaoh rose
[46:52] on the throne that knew not Joseph
[46:54] and this was the Pharaoh that the
[46:56] children of Israel were under and it
[46:58] brought them from being guests in Egypt
[47:02] to being slaves in Egypt so their lives
[47:06] had drastically changed over the 400
[47:08] years that they were there and things
[47:10] just got worse and then God comes down
[47:13] with a mighty hand and through plagues
[47:16] that he brought down upon Egypt he
[47:18] brings Egypt and pharaoh to their knees
[47:21] and to where they had to surrender and
[47:23] let them go
[47:25] and uh you know look at all the times
[47:28] Pharaoh refused to let him go but then
[47:30] finally he has to surrender to the will
[47:32] of God and let him go and so God
[47:34] delivered them as he had promised
[47:37] Abraham and this had been taught to them
[47:39] down Through the Ages that there was a
[47:41] deliverer coming that uh they were going
[47:44] to be delivered out of this bondage in
[47:47] Egypt and so once they were then they
[47:49] they exit in this Mass Exodus and they
[47:53] go out and you know the first thing they
[47:56] face is the water where they come to in
[47:59] Mora is bitter and so what do they do
[48:02] they complained
[48:04] and so then God tells Moses to cut this
[48:08] tree down put it over in the water and
[48:10] then it turns the water sweet and then
[48:12] they had water and then they they go on
[48:15] from there and you realize that they
[48:18] they were in the wilderness and uh
[48:20] traveling wandering around for 40 years
[48:23] but their clothes never wore out
[48:26] their shoes never wore out there there
[48:29] wasn't no place to go buy new ones there
[48:32] you know they didn't have the equipment
[48:34] to make new ones and uh but God so
[48:39] blessed that their clothes never wore
[48:41] out in 40 years
[48:43] you know I I don't know exactly how they
[48:45] did as their kids were getting older but
[48:47] it seemed like they always had clothes
[48:48] more and there was always shoes and uh
[48:52] you know God just took care of them and
[48:54] and then he you know they needed food to
[48:57] eat so he brought down Manna From Heaven
[49:00] Angel's bread and brother Branham says
[49:03] and they were eating Angels bread and
[49:05] they complained about it
[49:09] and you know the Bible says that they uh
[49:13] they gathered the the Manna in the
[49:15] morning said it was like coriander seed
[49:18] and they they grounded in meals they
[49:20] beat it in Mortar they baked it in pans
[49:22] they made cakes out of it they made
[49:24] different things out of it they were
[49:26] trying to because the taste of it became
[49:29] so common to him they didn't really care
[49:31] for the taste it tastes like oil and so
[49:34] they complained about that and they
[49:36] tried making it in different ways to try
[49:39] to appease themselves you know and then
[49:41] finally they're like we're tired of this
[49:43] we're tired of eating Mana you know can
[49:46] you imagine saying we're tired of eating
[49:48] Angels food
[49:50] and they said we want flesh we want meat
[49:54] and so Moses comes before the Lord and
[49:56] he says look look at these people
[49:58] complaining
[50:00] and God says they want meat and you're
[50:02] like God's anger was kindled against
[50:04] them the Bible says because of them
[50:06] complaining you know and he said you
[50:09] want meat fine I'll give you meat but
[50:12] I'll not give it to you for a day I'll
[50:14] not give it to you for a week he said
[50:16] I'm going to give it to you until it
[50:18] comes out of your nostrils until it
[50:20] becomes a loathsome thing to you so
[50:23] God's anger was countered against him he
[50:25] said you wanted okay I'm going to give
[50:27] it to you but when I get after I give it
[50:30] to you you're going to have it so much
[50:31] you're going to get tired of that
[50:33] and and you know so you you're not
[50:36] complaining the effect it has on God
[50:43] and you know uh every the thing was with
[50:47] Israel it was like they never could look
[50:50] at God's blessings
[50:52] they were always looking at their
[50:53] troubles
[50:55] and every time they came to a trouble
[50:57] instead of looking at the past and
[51:00] seeing God's record for taking them and
[51:03] delivering them out of everything and
[51:05] every trouble they faced and giving them
[51:08] a resolution for everything they always
[51:11] complained about it instead and they
[51:13] came down to a place where they didn't
[51:16] have any water and so uh God they were
[51:20] complaining about it so God tells Moses
[51:21] to go down and smite The Rock and said
[51:24] and you know water coming from Iraq that
[51:27] would be the last place you would look
[51:28] for water but God told him Smite The
[51:30] Rock and he smote The Rock and out of a
[51:33] place that would be impossible to have
[51:34] water out comes water
[51:37] but you think that then when they come
[51:39] down again and you know if you here's
[51:42] the thing with God if he gives you a
[51:44] test and you don't pass it you're he's
[51:46] going to give it to you again
[51:48] and he's going to give it to you again
[51:50] and again and again and again until you
[51:52] pass it because friends look we're not
[51:54] going to get to Heaven by the skin of
[51:56] our teeth
[51:58] you know and you realize the children of
[52:00] Israel when you finally come down to it
[52:01] they never did pass the test because out
[52:05] of two and a half million there was only
[52:07] two Joshua and Caleb that ever ended up
[52:10] Crossing into the promised land they got
[52:13] outside of the will of God because of
[52:15] their carnal minds and their complaints
[52:18] it took them out of the Divine will of
[52:20] God and it caused them to wander around
[52:23] in the desert
[52:26] amen yes
[52:29] yes
[52:31] see the effect complaining has
[52:36] but why couldn't they look back and see
[52:38] well the last time we come down to a
[52:40] place we had no water God gave us water
[52:43] out of an impossible place but they came
[52:45] down to again where they didn't have any
[52:47] water and what they do they complained
[52:49] about it
[52:50] nobody said to Moses Moses god did it to
[52:53] us before us before could you ask him to
[52:55] do it again
[52:56] no they complained about it and so much
[52:59] so that Moses anger was kindled and he
[53:02] goes up there and he's and God had told
[53:04] him to speak to the Rock and instead he
[53:06] smites The Rock and he says must I fetch
[53:09] water from this rock for you bunch of
[53:11] rebels
[53:14] Moses was Moses had really in and tried
[53:17] his patience
[53:19] because you realize Moses came with the
[53:22] promise for God that he God was going to
[53:25] supply their needs
[53:28] you know God never promised to supply
[53:30] your wants but there's not nobody
[53:32] sitting here this morning that can't say
[53:33] God hasn't supplied some of your wants
[53:37] as well as your needs but God promised
[53:40] to supply their needs he promised them
[53:43] to drag them to a land flowing with milk
[53:45] and honey and when they finally came
[53:47] down to the time to cross over they
[53:49] couldn't believe
[53:51] and that was their problem the whole
[53:53] time that's why they were always
[53:55] complaining was because of their
[53:57] unbelief
[53:59] and friends when you find yourself in
[54:01] situations and instead of looking to God
[54:03] for deliverance you got to complain
[54:05] about it then what it is that's unbelief
[54:09] and we want to cast down all unbelief
[54:18] you know brother Adam said people are
[54:20] the same way today
[54:22] he said they complained because they say
[54:24] I preached too hard he said when what
[54:27] I'm trying to do is trying to get them
[54:29] straightened up so they can go to heaven
[54:31] and they're complaining about it
[54:34] and you know
[54:37] this this was a new message that they
[54:39] had coming out of Egypt and going into
[54:41] uh on their road to the promised land
[54:45] and uh uh they they witnessed Time After
[54:49] Time the miracles of god
[54:52] and yet they complained until they ended
[54:56] up dying by the thousands
[54:58] and you say well what happened to him
[55:01] they're eternally gone
[55:05] remember the the priests and Pharisees
[55:07] said to Jesus said uh our fathers ate
[55:12] man in the wilderness and drank water
[55:13] from a rock and Jesus said and they're
[55:15] everyone dead
[55:22] after seeing all the Miracles they saw
[55:25] and they still complained
[55:28] we go through times in our lives and
[55:30] there's not a one of us sitting here
[55:32] today that could say we've never
[55:33] complained
[55:40] but you know brother Branham said he
[55:42] said I read once he said where it said I
[55:44] complained about having no shoes until I
[55:46] saw a man that had no feet
[55:49] and he said if you look around there's
[55:51] always someone who's worse off than you
[55:57] you know recently and you know how I am
[55:59] when I preach I tell all kinds of things
[56:01] on myself
[56:02] and recently uh is actually June 19th uh
[56:08] I had a day of it
[56:10] and I had different things coming up and
[56:13] going on and uh it was nothing involved
[56:16] in the church it was just personal with
[56:18] me and my life and uh you know and uh I
[56:23] I
[56:24] uh looked at my bank account online when
[56:27] I looked at my bank account online there
[56:29] was a charge that had come in that I
[56:31] wasn't expecting and hadn't authorized
[56:33] and what it did it ran me into the red
[56:36] because I wasn't expecting it it was on
[56:38] a side uh it was on it happened on a
[56:40] Monday
[56:41] and my check don't go in till Tuesday
[56:44] and so uh you know I I called the it was
[56:49] a company that I get my CPAP supplies
[56:52] from and I called them up and I said I
[56:54] didn't authorize you to put no charge on
[56:55] my account and they said well you know
[56:58] we we just as soon as the insurance uh
[57:01] puts out what they uh uh will cover then
[57:04] we immediately charge your account for
[57:06] what's left over and I said well I don't
[57:08] want you to do that you've got to let me
[57:09] know you can't just be doing that
[57:11] and they said well not only that but you
[57:13] owe such and such another amount for the
[57:16] machine still
[57:17] well that was upsetting
[57:19] you know here I was you know uh
[57:22] something that happened here and now
[57:24] they're telling me I owed even more
[57:25] money and so my mind went to what in the
[57:28] world's wrong with my insurance
[57:30] what in the world's wrong with my health
[57:32] insurance and I asked him I said didn't
[57:34] they cover anything and they said yeah
[57:36] and they told me how much I said man
[57:38] that was less than 50 percent of it
[57:41] I said I feel like I got Auto Insurance
[57:43] on my body
[57:44] yeah
[57:45] you know and and I just friends I got
[57:48] into a bad way
[57:50] and then I've got a little French
[57:52] Bulldog and he took off on me that day
[57:54] and I I had to walk down to the road
[57:56] after I done took a shower to go get him
[57:58] and he wouldn't listen to me and I throw
[58:00] rocks at him to get him back up the hill
[58:02] because he wouldn't come to me and so I
[58:05] chased him back up the hill you know and
[58:07] I got back up the hill and and I'd text
[58:09] my wife and said bring the Jeep down we
[58:11] got to get this dog and so she had
[58:13] started down the hill and I was coming
[58:14] up the hill and so I just about got him
[58:16] to the porch and she started on down the
[58:18] hill because the car was facing down the
[58:19] hill to go to go on down and turn around
[58:21] and come back well he heard that and he
[58:23] took off again
[58:24] and so you know I thought man I got to
[58:26] go in and take another shower and the
[58:28] thing about it was for instance my
[58:30] grandson Michael was there with me and
[58:31] he was witnessing all this going on he
[58:33] was witnessing my carrying on and and
[58:35] the things I was saying and how I was
[58:37] acting and all this and and then when it
[58:40] come about Nightfall you know time to go
[58:42] to bed man I felt ashamed of myself
[58:45] and uh so I was apologizing to Michael
[58:47] and I told him I did wrong
[58:49] and I said don't do like that I did
[58:52] wrong I said I was wrong and I apologize
[58:54] for I told him I said I feel so ashamed
[58:57] of the way I acted
[58:59] have you been there
[59:03] and it got me to thinking
[59:06] you know how do we act in front of our
[59:08] children
[59:10] how do we act him how do we react to
[59:12] problems and troubles
[59:14] and I and it got me to going back in my
[59:17] mind and thinking and I thought about
[59:19] when I was a little boy
[59:21] and I thought about both my parents
[59:23] living in Cleveland Ohio and both of
[59:25] them working to try to make ends meet
[59:27] you know and one of them working day
[59:29] shift and one of them working night
[59:31] shift me coming home from school with
[59:33] the a key to the house and letting
[59:35] myself in and being there about an hour
[59:37] or so a little more maybe until my mom
[59:40] would get in from work because she
[59:41] worked days dad worked nights and and
[59:44] and so they they barely got to see one
[59:46] another you know except on the weekends
[59:49] and then on the weekends Dad one time
[59:50] Dad was working two jobs he was working
[59:52] a job during the week and then working
[59:54] at a gas station on the weekends and I I
[59:57] went in to work on the weekends with him
[1:00:00] and uh I passed out and maybe you young
[1:00:02] people had never heard of this before
[1:00:04] but I passed out Green Stamps
[1:00:06] and for so many you know back then they
[1:00:09] put the gas in for you checked your oil
[1:00:10] cleans your windshield and done all that
[1:00:12] for you you know and I stood there's a
[1:00:15] little boy and I packed the lunch right
[1:00:16] along with my daddy you know and I I
[1:00:19] stood there's a little boy and when they
[1:00:20] would get so much gas then I would count
[1:00:22] out so much Green Stamps and give them
[1:00:24] and you know the thing about going
[1:00:27] through and thinking about all this you
[1:00:29] know if my parents ever complained I
[1:00:32] never heard them
[1:00:34] I don't ever remember either one of them
[1:00:37] ever throwing a fit because they
[1:00:39] couldn't meet something financially or
[1:00:42] because something got hard
[1:00:44] and that made me feel even worse
[1:00:47] and and I thought you know here they had
[1:00:50] it you know and they had it and my dad
[1:00:53] you know growing up he grew up poor
[1:00:57] I think he grew up he had two pair of
[1:00:59] pants one to wear for for outside to
[1:01:01] play and one pair to wear to school
[1:01:04] and he had shoes in the wintertime and
[1:01:08] uh you know and to go to go to school
[1:01:10] and they only dad would tell me they
[1:01:14] only usually ate meat one time a week
[1:01:16] and that was on Sunday if they got it
[1:01:18] and that would be chicken
[1:01:20] and he never got the choice of chicken
[1:01:22] he always got whatever else the adults
[1:01:25] wasn't eating and so you know he always
[1:01:28] got dark meat and so after my dad got
[1:01:30] older he never would touch dark meat he
[1:01:32] he he always had to have a white meat
[1:01:35] because he said he never got it growing
[1:01:37] up you know and what they ate most of
[1:01:39] the time during the week was fried
[1:01:40] potatoes and pinto beans and cornbread
[1:01:43] and that's what they lived on you know
[1:01:44] and they were poor and there was times
[1:01:46] they didn't you know my grandfather was
[1:01:48] a drinker and uh so a lot of times he
[1:01:51] would spend most of the money before he
[1:01:53] got home and so they didn't have money
[1:01:55] for groceries and my grandmother and my
[1:01:57] dad were both serving the lord you know
[1:01:59] my my dad started preaching when he was
[1:02:01] 17 years old and they would get down and
[1:02:04] pray and one time they were getting down
[1:02:06] to pray didn't have any groceries in the
[1:02:08] house and all of a sudden while they
[1:02:09] were still on their knees a knock came
[1:02:11] at the door they went there was a man
[1:02:13] there at the door with some bags of
[1:02:14] groceries he said the Lord told me to
[1:02:16] bring these to you and you know I I
[1:02:20] talked to my grandmother about the hard
[1:02:22] times that she'd grew up in and and she
[1:02:25] come up during the time of the
[1:02:26] depression and that you know and and
[1:02:29] both sides of my grandparents come
[1:02:31] through the Great Depression and that
[1:02:33] and you know I look back at them and I
[1:02:35] never heard him complain about anything
[1:02:38] my my grandfather Brown my mom's dad he
[1:02:42] worked long hard hours in the coal mines
[1:02:45] and I never heard him complain about it
[1:02:50] and then I thought of all the things
[1:02:52] that me in my life that I've complained
[1:02:54] about
[1:02:58] we if something don't go just kind of
[1:03:00] the way we thought it should go what did
[1:03:03] we do a lot of times we complain about
[1:03:05] it
[1:03:07] you know I gave you the example of
[1:03:09] myself and my my ordeal with the with
[1:03:11] the health insurance and everything and
[1:03:13] I got to thank him as I read this book
[1:03:15] brother said somebody's always got it
[1:03:17] worse off than you and I thought well
[1:03:18] I've been into other countries where
[1:03:20] they don't have anything
[1:03:22] I've I've sat at their tables and ate in
[1:03:26] their houses where you could see out
[1:03:27] through the boards to see outside they
[1:03:31] didn't have no glass on them when is all
[1:03:32] they had was some some boards they'd
[1:03:34] made shutters out of to shut at night
[1:03:37] you know I I've been in churches where
[1:03:39] they had lanterns
[1:03:42] and uh and you know uh I thought about
[1:03:45] one of the first times I went to the
[1:03:47] Philippines and preached and brother
[1:03:49] Phil went with me and we got over there
[1:03:51] one Sunday morning he they were having
[1:03:54] me preach in one place I think in Manila
[1:03:56] and he was preaching in a different
[1:03:57] place and uh you know they uh Manila is
[1:04:01] a big city and uh they got so much
[1:04:04] traffic and things like that to go a few
[1:04:06] miles takes hours
[1:04:08] and so they got several churches around
[1:04:10] Manila and so he was preaching at
[1:04:13] another church and he was preaching down
[1:04:15] by the river
[1:04:17] and he told me why I was preaching a rat
[1:04:19] ran across the aisle of the church it
[1:04:21] was almost as big as a cat a river rat
[1:04:24] oh my God you know and the the people
[1:04:26] never bothered them they just kept on
[1:04:28] pulling and kept on worshiping
[1:04:31] you know and I thought about the
[1:04:33] churches that we have nice air
[1:04:35] conditioning nice heat you know and and
[1:04:38] and a lot of their churches there ain't
[1:04:40] no air conditioning they ain't even some
[1:04:42] of their churches there ain't even no
[1:04:43] fans
[1:04:45] you know and uh you know when usually
[1:04:48] when I go on a trip like that I don't
[1:04:50] never wear a tie because I'll sweat the
[1:04:52] thing out
[1:04:54] and uh so uh my brother and I have
[1:04:58] preached in places over there when we
[1:05:00] got done preaching we had to go back to
[1:05:02] our room and actually peel our clothes
[1:05:04] off
[1:05:05] it would just so soaked with sweat they
[1:05:07] just stuck to you because there wasn't
[1:05:09] no air
[1:05:11] and I thought about the nice comfortable
[1:05:13] pews we have and the nice comfortable
[1:05:15] churches we have and and the the
[1:05:18] atmosphere uh uh uh you know the natural
[1:05:21] atmosphere that we can have of having
[1:05:23] air conditioning and all this you know
[1:05:25] and and the luxuries we have here and we
[1:05:28] find things to complain about
[1:05:33] We complain about when our our car
[1:05:35] doesn't uh want to run just right and
[1:05:38] there's people in other countries that
[1:05:39] don't even have a car my mom and dad
[1:05:42] when they first came up to Cleveland
[1:05:43] Ohio they didn't have a car couldn't
[1:05:45] afford to have a car couldn't afford to
[1:05:47] ride the bus to get to work so they
[1:05:49] walked everywhere they went
[1:05:52] and I never growing up ever heard them
[1:05:55] complain
[1:05:57] I can remember times of us having it
[1:05:59] tight and tough
[1:06:01] financially but I never heard my mom and
[1:06:04] dad complain
[1:06:05] you know we just made sure we done the
[1:06:08] best we could with what we had
[1:06:10] you know and I was uh for the first 13
[1:06:13] years of my life I was an only child so
[1:06:16] as a young child you know I was the only
[1:06:19] one in the home and uh so uh Dad tried
[1:06:23] to give me things like that what he
[1:06:25] wasn't able to have
[1:06:27] and uh you know and if he told me he was
[1:06:30] going to give me something he'd make me
[1:06:32] a promise I never asked him again about
[1:06:34] it because I knew he was going to keep
[1:06:36] his word that's how he ought to be with
[1:06:38] God
[1:06:39] we know God has promised to take care of
[1:06:41] our needs we know that God has promised
[1:06:43] to deliver us out of all of our troubles
[1:06:46] then we we ought to question him
[1:06:49] you know in in the books of Psalms let
[1:06:52] me turn down to it real quick in the in
[1:06:55] the Book of Psalms uh Psalm 77 if you
[1:06:58] want to turn there and read with me it
[1:07:01] says I cried into the Lord with my voice
[1:07:04] even into God with my voice and he gave
[1:07:07] ear unto me in the day of my trouble I
[1:07:10] sought the Lord that's what we need to
[1:07:11] do my sore ran in the night and ceased
[1:07:15] not and my soul refused to be confident
[1:07:17] I remembered the Lord and was troubled
[1:07:20] and I complained and my spirit was
[1:07:23] overwhelmed thou behold is mine eyes
[1:07:26] waking I am so troubled that I cannot
[1:07:29] speak I have considered the days of old
[1:07:32] and the years of ancient times and I
[1:07:34] call to remembrance my song in the night
[1:07:35] and I commune with my own heart and my
[1:07:38] spirit make diligent search will the
[1:07:41] Lord cast off forever will he be
[1:07:44] favorable no more is his Mercy clean
[1:07:48] Gone Forever doth his promise fell
[1:07:51] forevermore hath for God forgotten to be
[1:07:54] gracious hath he and anger shut up his
[1:07:57] Tender Mercies and I said in my
[1:08:00] infirmity but I will remember the years
[1:08:03] of the right hand of the most high I
[1:08:06] will remember the works of God surely I
[1:08:08] will remember thy wonders of old I will
[1:08:11] meditate all so on all thy works and
[1:08:13] talk of thy doings that's the thing
[1:08:16] Israel should have been doing they
[1:08:18] should have been meditating on the works
[1:08:20] and wonders of God that he had performed
[1:08:22] in their midst and how he had care of
[1:08:25] them
[1:08:28] they were poor they were destitute they
[1:08:31] had nothing but God took care of them
[1:08:41] God has never failed to take care of us
[1:08:45] David said I was once young but now I'm
[1:08:48] old but I've never seen the righteous
[1:08:50] forsaken nor is she begging bearhead
[1:08:55] God has always took care of our needs
[1:08:57] what have we got to complain about
[1:08:59] brother Branham talked about during the
[1:09:01] World War II he said we complained
[1:09:03] because we didn't have any sugar he said
[1:09:06] we complained because we had to boil our
[1:09:08] water twice for the coffee
[1:09:10] he said and we complained about it he
[1:09:12] says and there was young boys over
[1:09:15] across the seas dying and giving their
[1:09:17] lives for our Liberty and our freedom
[1:09:19] and we were complaining about not having
[1:09:21] a little something brother man says I
[1:09:23] think sometimes we complain too much
[1:09:38] Hallelujah
[1:09:41] one time
[1:09:43] you know core rose up and Nathan
[1:09:46] and they were complaining about Moses
[1:09:49] and saying you take too much on
[1:09:52] yourselves
[1:09:53] and said we're all holy
[1:09:56] and said how do you why should you lift
[1:09:59] yourself up above us brother Madam said
[1:10:02] they were complaining about God's
[1:10:04] provided way
[1:10:06] he said and God ended up killing him for
[1:10:09] it
[1:10:10] remember Moses said to him he said God
[1:10:13] is going to do a new thing today
[1:10:17] and he said he's going to open up the
[1:10:19] Earth and swallow you
[1:10:22] you know and all those is on the Lord's
[1:10:24] Side come over here
[1:10:26] and Cora and them stood there and
[1:10:28] withstood Moses and the Earth opened up
[1:10:32] and ate them
[1:10:33] and they were no more
[1:10:36] you think then the other people that
[1:10:39] remained would have said buddy we need
[1:10:42] to stop complaining but they didn't
[1:10:45] we need to start taking God at his word
[1:10:48] but they didn't
[1:10:52] we need to think about what they went
[1:10:54] through the times when we go through our
[1:10:56] troubles we need to think about all the
[1:10:59] times that God delivered us and have the
[1:11:02] faith that he will do it again
[1:11:10] song says he will do it again and again
[1:11:12] and again
[1:11:14] Hallelujah
[1:11:18] many times
[1:11:20] we just we get so self-consumed
[1:11:24] and we get tunnel vision and we get to
[1:11:26] looking at just what's going on right
[1:11:27] there and what just pleases our flesh
[1:11:30] friends I'm going to tell you something
[1:11:31] God didn't come to save your flesh
[1:11:35] he didn't come to baby and pamper your
[1:11:37] flesh
[1:11:38] he come to save your soul
[1:11:40] and and and and and and it's your soul
[1:11:43] that is the Eternal part of you
[1:11:46] this old flesh is what pulls you and
[1:11:49] tempts you to complain
[1:11:51] to cry about stuff if it doesn't go your
[1:11:54] way well you know uh they're just
[1:11:56] treating me such and such a way at work
[1:11:58] you've got work
[1:12:03] well I tell you this is just this
[1:12:05] working just so hard God's given you the
[1:12:07] strength to do it
[1:12:14] oh I tell you what they're just not
[1:12:16] paying me enough
[1:12:17] well there's nothing wrong with you know
[1:12:19] asking for a raise but the thing about
[1:12:20] it is Friends there's people around the
[1:12:22] world that don't get paid nothing right
[1:12:24] there's people around the world to get
[1:12:26] paid pennies next to what you get
[1:12:32] I remember going down to Honduras and
[1:12:34] preaching down there and I preached in a
[1:12:36] place where they had kicked him out of
[1:12:38] the church building they had so they
[1:12:40] didn't have a church building and we had
[1:12:42] to drive so far and then we had to walk
[1:12:44] up a mountain and we walked up the
[1:12:46] mountain and and and and the Brotherhood
[1:12:48] was with us you know he had a a
[1:12:51] generator that the church here had
[1:12:53] bought him and and and he packed that
[1:12:55] generator put a rug on his shoulder and
[1:12:57] packed that generator up the mountain to
[1:12:59] where these people lived so we could set
[1:13:01] up and have service because they didn't
[1:13:03] they had service outside in front of
[1:13:05] their home and they didn't have any life
[1:13:07] so we carried this stuff up there and
[1:13:08] some of the other brothers got up there
[1:13:10] and they strung some lights up and
[1:13:12] started that generator and got some
[1:13:13] lights and and brought out some places
[1:13:15] for the people to sit and there wasn't
[1:13:17] no cry rooms there wasn't no nurseries
[1:13:22] mama had to feed her child she just fed
[1:13:25] her child right there
[1:13:27] you know I I was preaching and I've
[1:13:29] raised my arm up and when I raised my
[1:13:31] arm out there was a bug that looked like
[1:13:33] it stretched from my wrist down to my
[1:13:35] elbow I just shook it off and went on
[1:13:37] preaching
[1:13:39] you know when I was sitting there
[1:13:41] studying before the service that had me
[1:13:42] out behind the house
[1:13:44] and I was sitting out behind this was in
[1:13:46] another place I was sitting out behind
[1:13:47] the house and there was chickens
[1:13:49] roosting in the tree that we were
[1:13:51] sitting under
[1:13:52] and uh one of the young girls from the
[1:13:55] the family one of the daughters comes
[1:13:58] out and she grabs one of the chickens
[1:13:59] and and takes it off
[1:14:01] and I didn't think nothing about it you
[1:14:04] know
[1:14:04] but what they would eat many times for
[1:14:07] their protein they ate the eggs from the
[1:14:09] chicken and I don't mean just for
[1:14:11] breakfast they ate it for other meals
[1:14:13] too
[1:14:14] and so but that night we had chicken
[1:14:17] they had took one of their chickens that
[1:14:20] produced for them and they had killed it
[1:14:23] for me
[1:14:26] you know how little that made me feel
[1:14:29] and I thought about the times I've
[1:14:31] complained about eating chicken
[1:14:39] and here they they didn't normally eat
[1:14:41] the chicken you know but they had killed
[1:14:43] it that that day for me while I was
[1:14:45] sitting out there studying to preach the
[1:14:47] service and uh you know and then you see
[1:14:50] the little children around and they you
[1:14:52] know you you're sitting at the table
[1:14:53] with the brothers and the little
[1:14:55] children sitting around and they're not
[1:14:56] eating you know and my dad that always
[1:14:58] bothered him and he always tried to give
[1:15:00] his food to the children so I want the
[1:15:02] children to eat first
[1:15:03] you know and uh and you know you try to
[1:15:07] you you try to give your food to
[1:15:10] somebody else but if you didn't eat it
[1:15:12] you might offend them because they had
[1:15:14] done this for you in honor of you
[1:15:17] so you needed to show you know that's
[1:15:19] one of the things with many people today
[1:15:21] they are not appreciative enough
[1:15:24] they don't appreciate what they've got
[1:15:27] they don't have any value of
[1:15:29] appreciation put upon the things that
[1:15:32] God has gave them
[1:15:35] [Applause]
[1:15:43] Philippians Paul says I have learned in
[1:15:47] whatsoever state I'm in there with to be
[1:15:49] content
[1:15:51] in Hebrews Paul says let your
[1:15:54] conversations be without covenants and
[1:15:57] be content with such things as you have
[1:16:00] brother Branham said if I would have
[1:16:02] taken all the money that's been offered
[1:16:04] to me he said I would be a well-off man
[1:16:06] today
[1:16:07] he said but I didn't do it he said I
[1:16:10] would rather not have anything and be in
[1:16:14] the will of God
[1:16:15] than to have he said one of the movie
[1:16:18] stars mansions in Hollywood
[1:16:23] he said I'd rather feel my heart in the
[1:16:25] presence of Christ that I feel now and
[1:16:28] have and then to have the riches of the
[1:16:31] world
[1:16:39] Jesus was born in this world he had a
[1:16:42] hard start
[1:16:45] he was born in a barn
[1:16:49] his first
[1:16:51] crib cradle was a Manger
[1:16:54] that's something that the animals ate
[1:16:57] out of
[1:16:59] his blanket
[1:17:01] you know his receiving blanket we call
[1:17:03] it
[1:17:04] was the swaddling cloth
[1:17:08] which was the the the swan caller the
[1:17:11] blanket light that went on the back of
[1:17:13] of the the ox
[1:17:16] you know to to absorb the the
[1:17:19] perspiration off of the ox while it
[1:17:22] worked
[1:17:23] that's what he was wrapped in
[1:17:27] there was no room in the end there was
[1:17:29] no room for him anywhere
[1:17:31] and then he grew up with the with the
[1:17:34] the the the the the accusation of being
[1:17:37] an illegitimate child
[1:17:45] he was persecuted for it
[1:17:50] he was whipped he was beaten for you and
[1:17:54] me
[1:17:56] by his stripes I am healed
[1:18:03] And We complain sometimes when something
[1:18:05] just gets a little rough
[1:18:14] he had to walk up
[1:18:17] calvary's way carrying his own cross
[1:18:22] until he stumbled under the weight of it
[1:18:25] and they had to get somebody else to
[1:18:27] step in and help him bear it the rest of
[1:18:29] the way
[1:18:33] we ought to gladly bear our cross
[1:18:36] we ought to counter the privilege
[1:18:39] friends look when you faced with the
[1:18:41] trouble you know what it actually is
[1:18:42] it's an opportunity for God to come and
[1:18:45] do something for you
[1:18:47] when you're faced with sickness in your
[1:18:49] life it's an opportunity for God to come
[1:18:51] and heal you
[1:18:55] I remember when I was first diagnosed
[1:18:57] with diabetes and you know it really
[1:19:00] upset me and I got really depressed
[1:19:01] about it and I got down about it and you
[1:19:03] know what I was thinking I was thinking
[1:19:04] of all the things I like to eat that I
[1:19:06] wasn't going to be able to eat
[1:19:11] and for a long time
[1:19:13] I I didn't try to take care of it
[1:19:17] you know I just I said well whatever if
[1:19:19] I check it it's going to be high so I'm
[1:19:21] just going to eat what I want to eat and
[1:19:22] enjoy what I want to enjoy and just go
[1:19:24] on that way
[1:19:26] but you know things in the health seem
[1:19:29] to get worse
[1:19:31] and finally I realized
[1:19:33] you know that you know brother random
[1:19:36] says people say God doesn't help them
[1:19:38] that don't help themselves he said
[1:19:40] that's wrong he said God helps them that
[1:19:42] can't help themselves
[1:19:43] but you know if there's something you
[1:19:45] can do I believe God expects you to do
[1:19:48] it
[1:19:49] and that was the Revelation I come to
[1:19:51] you know and I thought about something
[1:19:53] my dad had told me there was years ago
[1:19:55] back in 1997 dad and I would come we'd
[1:19:57] meet here at the church and we'd pray
[1:20:00] during the day and then I would go up
[1:20:02] and I was trying to to get the tape
[1:20:04] Library organized and all those things
[1:20:07] and I worked during the day and dad was
[1:20:08] working on things down in the office and
[1:20:10] and then but we'd meet here every day
[1:20:12] we'd pray you know and dad was praying
[1:20:15] and he told me about it later and he
[1:20:16] said he had diabetes you know and he was
[1:20:18] praying God heal me from this diabetes
[1:20:21] and he said while he was he prayed and
[1:20:24] he prayed many times about it he said
[1:20:25] while he was praying different pictures
[1:20:27] of images of food that he was eating
[1:20:30] that he shouldn't be eating started
[1:20:31] coming up into his mind
[1:20:33] and he said the Lord spoke to him said
[1:20:35] I've already healed you but you're not
[1:20:37] eaten right
[1:20:46] And We complain about having it
[1:20:50] and there's people around the world
[1:20:52] friends
[1:20:54] they don't even have the temptation of
[1:20:57] some of the foods that you have the
[1:20:58] temptation of them because it just ain't
[1:21:00] there
[1:21:02] pregnant
[1:21:05] brother Rowell Soriano had diabetes you
[1:21:07] know and one of the main Staples eaten
[1:21:10] over there is rice
[1:21:11] and I love rice
[1:21:13] but you know rice is a starch and rice
[1:21:16] will cause your blood sugar to go up
[1:21:21] so if you're eating rice every day and
[1:21:23] you got diabetes you need to change your
[1:21:25] diet
[1:21:26] the thing about it is you've got you
[1:21:29] know what I come to I had to change the
[1:21:31] way I thought
[1:21:36] be content with such things as we have
[1:21:39] be content with whatever state you find
[1:21:42] yourself in whatever the situation is
[1:21:45] knowing that God can take care of you
[1:21:46] and be content with that
[1:21:53] brother Branham was uh out hunting up in
[1:21:56] the mountains
[1:21:57] and he was walking you know and he was
[1:22:01] by himself and he was walking and uh you
[1:22:05] know in a a Rancher came along riding on
[1:22:07] a horse and saw brother Branham and
[1:22:09] offered him to get up on the horse and
[1:22:11] ride with him and so they were riding
[1:22:14] and he asked brother REM said he said
[1:22:16] what do you do and he said well I I've
[1:22:18] been a ranger and he said yeah he says
[1:22:21] uh and brother bear said I also I'm a
[1:22:23] preacher and the man said you look too
[1:22:26] intelligent for that he said and brother
[1:22:29] Graham said I'd like to think that my
[1:22:31] intelligence is what uh allows me to
[1:22:34] accept I got to preach
[1:22:36] and he said well let me ask you a
[1:22:38] question he said don't tell me you
[1:22:41] believe in the Virgin birth
[1:22:43] and brother Brahm said I sure do
[1:22:46] he said well I'm going to tell you
[1:22:48] something he said it is scientifically
[1:22:50] impossible for something like that to
[1:22:51] happen
[1:22:52] he said there's got to be a man and a
[1:22:56] woman there's got to be both present in
[1:22:58] order to have a baby he said that's
[1:23:00] scientifically impossible
[1:23:02] brother Graham said well I know it's
[1:23:04] true
[1:23:05] he said why because you read it in the
[1:23:07] Bible he said not only that he said
[1:23:09] because he lives in my heart
[1:23:14] he said well how do you know he lives in
[1:23:16] your heart he said because I could tell
[1:23:18] you what my life used to be and I can
[1:23:21] tell you how he changed it and how he's
[1:23:23] made me what I am today
[1:23:26] all right
[1:23:27] and and he said so you really believe
[1:23:30] that he says I believe it with all my
[1:23:32] heart he said they went on riding a
[1:23:33] little bit and he said he looked and the
[1:23:35] man kind of pulled his hat down you know
[1:23:37] uh over his eyes a little bit and he
[1:23:40] said I couldn't tell what he was doing
[1:23:41] and said then he turned his head
[1:23:43] sideways you know and and he said he
[1:23:46] looked up uh into the mountains and he
[1:23:50] said uh uh
[1:23:52] uh let me just find it here he said
[1:23:59] he said I lift up my heads into the
[1:24:02] Hills from which I come with my help and
[1:24:04] my Help Cometh From The Lord he said
[1:24:06] tears started rolling down his eyes and
[1:24:09] he said preacher you ain't been the
[1:24:11] first preacher up here
[1:24:13] he said and I've asked and talked to
[1:24:15] every one of them he says and I've been
[1:24:16] looking for one that really believed it
[1:24:21] and he gave his life to the Lord
[1:24:31] brother Branham you know what if he'd
[1:24:34] have thought oh man of all people in the
[1:24:35] world to pick me up
[1:24:37] of all people in the world to ask me for
[1:24:39] a ride and this guy's got to persecute
[1:24:41] me over what I believe and question me
[1:24:44] over it
[1:24:45] but he he didn't
[1:24:47] and he ended up leading the man to the
[1:24:49] Lord
[1:24:50] because he said I found a preacher that
[1:24:52] finally really believed this yeah
[1:24:59] sometimes we may have to stand a little
[1:25:01] persecution
[1:25:05] the trial of our faith is more precious
[1:25:07] than gold
[1:25:12] you know brother Branham said you know
[1:25:14] he said
[1:25:16] a mule is one of the most ignorant
[1:25:19] animals I've ever known he said I've
[1:25:21] worked with him he said they're one of
[1:25:23] the most ignorant animals there are he
[1:25:26] said you can't teach them nothing
[1:25:31] and he said that's what's the matter
[1:25:32] with some people today they're like a
[1:25:34] mule
[1:25:35] you can't teach them nothing
[1:25:37] and you know we I'm standing here this
[1:25:40] morning and I stood last Sunday and I'm
[1:25:42] preaching to Born Again Believers of God
[1:25:44] that have are human and in our flesh we
[1:25:47] have complained but I'll tell you
[1:25:49] sometimes we need to watch that that old
[1:25:52] uh nature and attitude of the mule don't
[1:25:56] we don't take it on
[1:26:01] yes brother Adam said the mule Will Wait
[1:26:04] its whole life just to kick you one last
[1:26:06] time before it dies
[1:26:08] he said you know what a mule is he said
[1:26:11] it's a hybrid he said it a mule didn't
[1:26:14] come from God that came man-made man put
[1:26:17] a mirror with the donkey and produced
[1:26:20] something that can't produce itself back
[1:26:23] he said he don't know who his dad in his
[1:26:25] and his mama is
[1:26:27] he said but a good old Thoroughbred he
[1:26:29] said he can trace back his ancestors and
[1:26:31] people I want you to know today you can
[1:26:34] trace back your ancestry all the way
[1:26:36] back to God
[1:26:38] Eternal at the beginning you don't even
[1:26:40] have a beginning you're Eternal if you
[1:26:43] have eternal life in you you never had a
[1:26:46] beginning this body had a beginning
[1:26:48] don't let this body rule you
[1:26:53] amen
[1:26:55] yes
[1:26:59] but you know what it is brother Brandon
[1:27:01] said sometimes we let the devil after
[1:27:03] all of God's promises we let the devil
[1:27:05] kick us around like a football
[1:27:10] you know the thing about it is Satan's
[1:27:12] been stripped of his rights he was
[1:27:14] stripped of his rights at Calvary
[1:27:17] Jesus took on him our sins
[1:27:21] all the sins that had been committed an
[1:27:24] all-future sin
[1:27:26] though all the sins ever of the world
[1:27:31] of all people that ever existed or ever
[1:27:34] would exist
[1:27:36] he took all that on him what a weight
[1:27:39] we think sometimes about how the devil
[1:27:41] brings back up into our mind some of how
[1:27:44] we lived the things we did and we and
[1:27:46] that bothers us
[1:27:48] think about Jesus he had all of that
[1:27:51] and it suffered so so much with it
[1:27:55] friends you know crucifixion is actually
[1:27:57] a a long drawn-out process of death
[1:28:02] they they put him up on a on a cross and
[1:28:05] what happens is you know their legs
[1:28:07] start to give out on them after a while
[1:28:09] of holding themselves up and as they do
[1:28:11] you know their arms are up and they
[1:28:13] begin to sink down and it begins to push
[1:28:15] down on their lungs and what it's doing
[1:28:16] is slowly suffocating them but it says
[1:28:20] that it would take days for somebody to
[1:28:23] die through crucifixion
[1:28:25] it took hours for Jesus
[1:28:34] because he had the weight
[1:28:36] of the world on him
[1:28:38] all the sins and for those sins he was
[1:28:41] sent to hell
[1:28:43] and when he went to hell he he come down
[1:28:45] to Hell and Friends he bust open the
[1:28:47] gates went up to the devil and said I'll
[1:28:49] have those keys now
[1:28:52] and he took the keys from the devil you
[1:28:54] know as I heard brother Dan Daisy often
[1:28:55] say he said the devil don't even get the
[1:28:57] keys to his own house
[1:29:00] and he took the keys from him he took
[1:29:02] the he took the power over of death that
[1:29:05] was over man
[1:29:07] the Bible says he led captivity captive
[1:29:09] here they were in a place that was it
[1:29:12] was a realm Called Paradise and it was
[1:29:15] where you know because they died under
[1:29:17] the blood of bulls and goats and so
[1:29:20] there wasn't uh an ultimate sacrifice
[1:29:23] for their sins so they couldn't go into
[1:29:26] the presence of God they had to go to
[1:29:28] this other realm and they weren't lost
[1:29:31] but they were in need of a savior
[1:29:34] and so when the Savior come he come and
[1:29:37] set them free from that brother Adam
[1:29:40] said when Jesus walked down through
[1:29:42] those corridors he said there stood up
[1:29:45] Abraham and he said Sarah remember him
[1:29:47] this is the one I've always talked about
[1:29:51] and the Bible said many of the Saints of
[1:29:53] old Rose from their graves and walked
[1:29:56] through the streets of Jerusalem
[1:30:00] amen he led captivity captured he set
[1:30:02] him free
[1:30:05] he took all the rights away from the
[1:30:07] Devil
[1:30:08] the devil don't got any rights over you
[1:30:10] quit letting him kick you around
[1:30:14] he said how do we let him kick us around
[1:30:16] when we were faced with the trouble when
[1:30:19] we're faced with the trial when we're
[1:30:21] faced with the situation then we let the
[1:30:24] devil come and plague us in our minds we
[1:30:26] let the devil tell us you're a loser
[1:30:30] we let the devil talk to us
[1:30:33] we need to stop letting him listening to
[1:30:35] the devil brother Adam said he chose the
[1:30:38] mind that's the Battleground and that's
[1:30:40] where he battles you
[1:30:44] he don't have any rights
[1:30:46] quit letting him kick you around brother
[1:30:48] random says
[1:30:53] in Colossians 3 and 5. it says and let
[1:30:57] the peace of God rule in your hearts
[1:31:02] the word rule there comes from a Greek
[1:31:05] word that means
[1:31:07] umpire
[1:31:11] let the peace of God unpire your heart
[1:31:16] you know what an Umpire is he's the one
[1:31:17] that calls the shots
[1:31:23] let the peace of God call the shots in
[1:31:25] your heart
[1:31:27] let the peace of God rule your emotions
[1:31:34] many of us are many of us we give over
[1:31:37] to our emotions we get caught up in our
[1:31:40] emotions and that's why sometimes we we
[1:31:42] throw anger tantrums and fits and and
[1:31:45] and we complain is because we get we get
[1:31:48] we become slaves to our emotions
[1:31:52] you can't live by your emotions
[1:31:59] emotions are all right until they're bad
[1:32:04] it's all right to be emotional in the
[1:32:07] house of God and have tears running down
[1:32:08] your eyes and worship than a God and or
[1:32:10] jumping or shouting or whatever you know
[1:32:12] but the thing about it is you need to
[1:32:14] carry that home with you too yeah
[1:32:17] and when you're faced with the problem
[1:32:18] listen Jesus said when you spoke evil of
[1:32:23] and your name is cast out as evil in
[1:32:25] other words lies been told on you
[1:32:27] he said you should rejoice in that day
[1:32:31] he actually just leap for joy in other
[1:32:34] words have a Hallelujah breakdown
[1:32:38] he said for so did their fathers of the
[1:32:42] prophets
[1:32:43] it's showing your identification
[1:32:46] friends we're not floating down the
[1:32:48] stream with the rest of the trash
[1:32:51] we're going up River
[1:32:54] and you've got to have the paddle of the
[1:32:57] Lord to get you upriver
[1:33:01] the minute you stop paddling that's the
[1:33:03] moment you start drifting that's the
[1:33:06] moment you start backsliding
[1:33:19] inward peace
[1:33:22] let that be your guide toward doing the
[1:33:25] will of God
[1:33:28] if there's something you're looking to
[1:33:30] do and you can't get peace about it
[1:33:31] don't do it
[1:33:36] let the peace of God rule in your heart
[1:33:41] don't don't
[1:33:44] let the devil rule your heart
[1:33:48] don't let your trials and your troubles
[1:33:51] your tribulations or your persecutions
[1:33:53] rule your heart let the peace of God
[1:33:55] rule your heart
[1:33:57] how can I have peace in the midst of the
[1:33:59] storm look I was traveling up Thursday
[1:34:01] night and I listened in on your service
[1:34:04] while I was driving
[1:34:06] good service I actually uh told my son
[1:34:10] who uh my youngest boys going through
[1:34:12] something and and yesterday I was
[1:34:14] talking to him and I texted him I said
[1:34:16] listen to the brother Samuel's service
[1:34:18] from Thursday I said I think it'll be a
[1:34:20] real help to you you know how he brought
[1:34:22] out about the the the the painting of
[1:34:24] that looked like a storm cloud and when
[1:34:27] you get up close to it it's actually
[1:34:28] angel's wings
[1:34:30] and where he gave that story an example
[1:34:33] at the end about when you're going
[1:34:35] through a storm just keep on going
[1:34:38] there's many people that'll stop and
[1:34:40] pull off to the side but just keep on
[1:34:42] going because you know what the storms
[1:34:44] of life are not
[1:34:47] eternal
[1:34:48] okay
[1:34:50] every situation has an end to it
[1:34:54] and the thing about it is is how can we
[1:34:57] uh what opinion do we have of ourselves
[1:35:01] once we've come through the storm how
[1:35:04] did we handle ourselves I tell you
[1:35:06] friends there's things I've come through
[1:35:07] that I don't ever want to go through
[1:35:09] again
[1:35:10] and I I was thinking of those things
[1:35:12] while I was going through it and I said
[1:35:14] Lord I want to pass this test because I
[1:35:17] don't want to face this again
[1:35:20] you know that you know God's tests are
[1:35:24] his Mercy to you
[1:35:29] when he gives you the same test over
[1:35:31] again that's his Mercy to you he's
[1:35:34] giving you the opportunity to pass it
[1:35:36] this time
[1:35:37] he gave he gave test after test after
[1:35:40] test to Israel
[1:35:41] friends that was his mercies
[1:35:45] he was giving them an opportunity to
[1:35:47] finally believe him
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:52] and every time their unbelief ruled
[1:35:56] their hearts
[1:35:59] they couldn't have peace
[1:36:03] because they wouldn't trust in God
[1:36:07] how hard is it to trust in somebody that
[1:36:10] has met every need you've had
[1:36:14] amen
[1:36:16] friends look God so cares about your
[1:36:19] life he cares what you had for breakfast
[1:36:20] this morning
[1:36:22] he watches over you he cares about you
[1:36:25] and friends I'm going to tell you
[1:36:26] something he actually even allows us
[1:36:28] some of our wants in this life
[1:36:38] some of us drive the best cars we didn't
[1:36:42] have to have that one
[1:36:43] we could have took a lesser one
[1:36:47] but God provided the means for us to
[1:36:49] have it a little luxury
[1:36:58] you know to make to make trips like
[1:37:00] brother Samuel makes off the internet
[1:37:02] you can't depend on a point A to point B
[1:37:05] card you got to have something you can
[1:37:06] depend on
[1:37:08] I'll tell you what friends I remember
[1:37:10] times my dad going out and preaching and
[1:37:12] I'll tell you what some of the cars we
[1:37:14] had was a point A to point B car
[1:37:18] I remember one of the times dad went and
[1:37:21] preached over in uh
[1:37:22] brother McCormick's church and we were
[1:37:25] coming back we lived in in Saint Mary's
[1:37:27] at the time and we were coming back home
[1:37:29] we were traveling I think it was 30 was
[1:37:31] the route we were traveling on and it it
[1:37:33] gets there ain't no lights
[1:37:35] it gets dark and desolate
[1:37:37] and we and we got to traveling out there
[1:37:40] you know and the next thing you know we
[1:37:41] was in a 1971 Ford LTD
[1:37:44] and as we were traveling down the road
[1:37:47] all of a sudden the Lights Went Out
[1:37:50] did the headlights just went out
[1:37:53] and Dad pulled over to the side of the
[1:37:55] road and and then the car just quit
[1:38:01] and dad went up and he opened up the
[1:38:03] hood and you know my dad wasn't really a
[1:38:05] mechanic I remember him changing parts
[1:38:07] but Dad really wasn't a car mechanic
[1:38:10] and Dad opened up the hood and we were
[1:38:13] sitting there you know me and myself and
[1:38:15] my little brother and my grandmother and
[1:38:18] my aunt and Mom and Dad and we were
[1:38:20] sitting there in the car and we were
[1:38:21] sitting there praying
[1:38:24] and this farmer came along in his truck
[1:38:27] and he pulled up there and he came over
[1:38:29] and he had a flashlight we didn't even
[1:38:31] have a flashlight
[1:38:32] and he had a flashlight and he shined
[1:38:35] the flashlight in there and he said get
[1:38:37] in and try to start it once and my dad
[1:38:39] got in and the thing fired up and the
[1:38:41] lights came on dad got out and said I
[1:38:44] owe you something what can I pay he said
[1:38:46] I didn't do nothing but Shine the Light
[1:38:47] in there
[1:38:57] it was God that touched the car we got
[1:39:00] the car back home you know and and dad
[1:39:03] took it down to a mechanic that he
[1:39:05] always took our cars to and the mechanic
[1:39:08] says I don't know how in the world you
[1:39:09] ever got home
[1:39:11] he said your what was it called Mike did
[1:39:14] an alternator generator or something
[1:39:15] like that he said that thing was gone
[1:39:18] he said you were running on your battery
[1:39:21] and he said and your battery's dead I
[1:39:24] don't know how in the world you even got
[1:39:25] home
[1:39:26] it was the Lord
[1:39:29] you know and remembering back sitting in
[1:39:32] the back seat of that car me and my
[1:39:34] grandmother and and and my aunt you know
[1:39:37] she was just a little girl then and and
[1:39:39] my my brother just a little boy sitting
[1:39:42] up in the front seat between Mom and Dad
[1:39:43] I don't remember any complaints out of
[1:39:46] anybody
[1:39:47] I don't remember anybody saying well now
[1:39:50] what is it
[1:39:51] because it wasn't the first time
[1:39:55] but you know my dad would go and he
[1:39:58] would go to he would preach a message
[1:39:59] about faith
[1:40:01] and boy he could really tear it up
[1:40:04] and he preached a message about faith
[1:40:06] and my mom said every time he preached
[1:40:07] about faith I know we're getting ready
[1:40:09] to face something
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:12] we're going to face it before we get
[1:40:13] home and have to use faith and it was
[1:40:16] faith that God is home
[1:40:18] it wasn't our complaining it wasn't our
[1:40:21] bellyaching
[1:40:27] we didn't complain about the car we was
[1:40:29] happy that it finally got us home
[1:40:31] I was a kid I didn't care how it got his
[1:40:34] home
[1:40:35] I was just glad to be back home
[1:40:40] I didn't know anything about uh well you
[1:40:43] know this alternator is going to cost a
[1:40:45] certain amount of things and it caused
[1:40:46] something else to go bad because it was
[1:40:48] driving it and and
[1:40:51] I don't even know I'm not a mechanic
[1:40:53] either
[1:40:54] I can't even remember the names of all
[1:40:55] that stuff but there was a little old
[1:40:57] box that was on the side of it I can
[1:40:58] remember and and whatever that thing was
[1:41:00] it went bad too and and uh it somehow
[1:41:04] was all in line with the electricity of
[1:41:06] the car and everything you know and uh
[1:41:09] and so you know but it was God
[1:41:22] how many remembers of Blizzard of 1977.
[1:41:30] we were living out in the country you
[1:41:32] know and there was drifts we had that
[1:41:34] old 71 Ford and there was drifts higher
[1:41:37] than the car
[1:41:38] they brought they brought the National
[1:41:40] Guard brought equipment out there to
[1:41:42] plow through the drifts you know and we
[1:41:45] were driving on the road going between
[1:41:46] the drifts you know and we were going
[1:41:48] out to get my grandmother and she lived
[1:41:51] out in the country out uh quite a
[1:41:53] distance from us and we my dad and I
[1:41:55] were going out there and we got out
[1:41:56] there in the drifts we all the way up to
[1:41:58] the roof for house we had to walk up the
[1:42:00] drift to the roof and then walk down
[1:42:02] them down to get to the door to get her
[1:42:03] out of there
[1:42:05] and we got her back to the house you
[1:42:06] know and and then the storm got worse
[1:42:09] and then it came worse and then you
[1:42:11] couldn't even get out on the roads
[1:42:13] and you know and they were offering
[1:42:16] people if they needed something you know
[1:42:17] there was men out there running around
[1:42:18] on snowmobiles that would bring them
[1:42:20] something to eat if they needed it or
[1:42:21] whatever you know and uh we had baked
[1:42:25] bread and we had uh baked goods and we
[1:42:30] had you know uh all these things that
[1:42:33] you know you don't you don't always get
[1:42:36] you know but we had to make do because
[1:42:39] you couldn't get out to the stores
[1:42:43] I was just a young boy I was having a
[1:42:45] good time buddy there wasn't no school
[1:42:53] we raised cattle
[1:42:55] had to walk out and and we didn't have
[1:42:58] running water to the cattle except for
[1:43:00] two legs
[1:43:03] and you know in the summertime we could
[1:43:05] run a garden hose out there but in the
[1:43:06] winter time you had to carry buckets of
[1:43:08] water out there to water the and I'll
[1:43:10] tell you what buddy they can drink
[1:43:13] it takes more than a couple of buckets
[1:43:15] to to you know quench their thirst
[1:43:18] and carrying water out there and and the
[1:43:20] storm got so bad you know mom went to
[1:43:23] help me carry the water out there and we
[1:43:25] had three buckets I was holding one on
[1:43:27] this side and she was holding one on
[1:43:29] that side and then we both grabbed a
[1:43:30] hole in the middle one in the middle
[1:43:32] because we couldn't even see the barn
[1:43:33] from the house because of the the drift
[1:43:36] and the wind blowing the the snow
[1:43:38] everywhere
[1:43:39] the visibility was none and we held on
[1:43:43] each of that bucket so we wouldn't get
[1:43:44] separated from one another
[1:43:46] and carried water out there to to them
[1:43:49] you know and fed them and took care of
[1:43:51] them and everything you know and friends
[1:43:53] I looked back on these times and I
[1:43:55] remember and as a child you know what I
[1:43:58] remember no complaining
[1:44:02] you know
[1:44:05] that's what your children need to
[1:44:07] remember
[1:44:09] they know to remember you trusting God
[1:44:12] through every time every trial
[1:44:14] everything your grandchildren friends
[1:44:16] friends look
[1:44:18] your grandchildren are affected by you
[1:44:24] they look at the way you react to things
[1:44:28] you know what they're doing they're
[1:44:30] learning
[1:44:35] they're you're teaching them by example
[1:44:39] Jesus was our example he didn't complain
[1:44:44] you're teaching your children by your
[1:44:46] example how to trust in God and accept
[1:44:50] what how God is doing something that was
[1:44:53] the problem with Israel they never
[1:44:55] wanted to accept how God was taking care
[1:44:57] of them it was never good enough for
[1:45:00] them
[1:45:04] God's supplying your needs friends look
[1:45:06] I'll tell you let it be good enough for
[1:45:08] you
[1:45:10] amen
[1:45:13] don't let money be the ruling factor in
[1:45:16] your life
[1:45:18] because we're going to an economy where
[1:45:20] it doesn't exist
[1:45:23] praise God for that
[1:45:26] there won't be no IRS in the millennium
[1:45:29] [Laughter]
[1:45:37] we're going to a time in the Millennium
[1:45:39] friends where it says that there'll be
[1:45:42] people coming up and and saying I need
[1:45:45] rain
[1:45:46] and as a son and child of God you
[1:45:48] believe to say I send you rain
[1:45:52] now what did they need rain for did they
[1:45:54] need rain to make an Abraham Lincoln or
[1:45:56] George Washington or Ben Franklin nope
[1:46:00] you're going to plant your own crops
[1:46:03] you're going to eat what you plant
[1:46:05] you're going to build your own house
[1:46:10] yes
[1:46:12] that's all part of the millennium
[1:46:15] we don't we don't live forever in a new
[1:46:17] city of Jerusalem until after the
[1:46:19] Millennium and the Earth is burned over
[1:46:21] and the heavens is burned over and
[1:46:22] there's a new heavens and a new Earth
[1:46:23] then the New Jerusalem comes and sits
[1:46:25] down on the Earth
[1:46:30] friends look
[1:46:33] God
[1:46:34] has prepared a place for us that where
[1:46:38] he is there we may be also and he's made
[1:46:40] it according
[1:46:43] to you what your desires and your wants
[1:46:46] and your likes are
[1:46:55] sure we've lost loved ones
[1:47:00] I've got a family
[1:47:02] in my church
[1:47:04] they years ago they lost a little girl
[1:47:08] when she was I think under the age of 10
[1:47:11] they lost her to leukemia
[1:47:13] you know and then sometime later you
[1:47:16] know they lost their oldest boy at the
[1:47:18] age of 45.
[1:47:24] and you know
[1:47:26] I say this with with not in any
[1:47:29] degrading way or whatever but it brought
[1:47:31] them jock it with us or any other human
[1:47:33] to ask don't God love us
[1:47:36] just like you know in the Bible in
[1:47:39] Psalms where I read you he was
[1:47:40] questioning God
[1:47:42] has your mercies forsaken us forevermore
[1:47:50] and I remember I prayed for this brother
[1:47:53] and I said God
[1:47:56] you know the the the young man he had
[1:48:00] committed suicide
[1:48:02] and me and his father was the ones that
[1:48:04] discovered him
[1:48:05] and it was very traumatic I'll tell you
[1:48:08] what it sent me into a talespin that
[1:48:10] lasted for years
[1:48:12] I feel like I'm just now coming out of
[1:48:14] it
[1:48:15] and uh and getting to be myself again
[1:48:19] and
[1:48:20] you know he was really going through it
[1:48:22] and I prayed and I said God
[1:48:24] there was a time
[1:48:27] when my dad went beyond the curtain of
[1:48:29] time and got to see his father
[1:48:33] I said
[1:48:34] you let brother Branham during the time
[1:48:37] when he was grieving over his wife and
[1:48:40] his daughter you let him go beyond the
[1:48:43] curtain of time you let him see his wife
[1:48:45] and his daughter again
[1:48:47] I said God I'm asking you for this
[1:48:51] brother's sake let him see his son
[1:48:55] and that night his son came to him in a
[1:48:58] vision
[1:48:59] and his son came to him you know and he
[1:49:02] had been a little bit heavy set when he
[1:49:04] passed away but when he came to him he
[1:49:05] was all slimmed down like he had been
[1:49:07] when he was about 18 years old
[1:49:10] and he said he kept rubbing himself like
[1:49:12] he said look at me Daddy
[1:49:14] and and he said don't you know we loved
[1:49:17] you
[1:49:18] why'd you do what you done don't you
[1:49:21] know we loved you he said I know you
[1:49:23] love me but look at me Daddy I'm all
[1:49:26] right
[1:49:32] God let him seem so he would know he was
[1:49:35] all right
[1:49:41] you know at the funeral I preaching many
[1:49:43] people you know of course they they're
[1:49:45] under the stigma say if somebody commits
[1:49:46] suicide they're internally lost that's a
[1:49:48] Catholic Doctrine
[1:49:51] think about Samson
[1:49:55] Samson's standing between two pillars he
[1:49:57] said Lord as I take my life let me take
[1:50:00] the lives of all my enemies with me
[1:50:03] good
[1:50:05] yeah and brother Bradham said in the
[1:50:08] message he said
[1:50:10] a person could have the Holy Ghost and
[1:50:13] go
[1:50:14] totally insane
[1:50:16] but that's got nothing to do with their
[1:50:19] soul
[1:50:20] take their life but that's got nothing
[1:50:23] to do with their soul
[1:50:25] it's a mental sickness it's an illness
[1:50:27] just like diabetes high blood pressure
[1:50:29] or heart disease
[1:50:31] but it's in the mind
[1:50:32] think about it friends Satan chose the
[1:50:35] mind as his Battleground
[1:50:40] and you don't think about it a lot of
[1:50:42] times but there's natural physical
[1:50:44] things that that have to happen to keep
[1:50:47] you in your right mind
[1:50:49] there's there's receptors in your brain
[1:50:52] and there's transmitters and there's
[1:50:54] things that's got to fire off and and
[1:50:56] you've got to be able to produce
[1:50:58] endorphins and all these other things
[1:51:00] you know to keep you all right
[1:51:06] and here we are in our right Minds
[1:51:09] in a time when the world's going utterly
[1:51:12] insane
[1:51:16] in a time where men think and want to be
[1:51:19] women and women thinking they want to be
[1:51:20] men and some of them thinking well I
[1:51:22] don't know if I want to be either one
[1:51:24] I want you to call me them
[1:51:32] brother random said before the end time
[1:51:34] this world would go totally insane
[1:51:36] that's what they're doing that's what's
[1:51:37] happening
[1:51:39] down in Tennessee and Kentucky just here
[1:51:42] recent some judges passed a a a
[1:51:45] something to block a a law that was
[1:51:49] going into effect where they couldn't
[1:51:51] give minors and children uh uh uh
[1:51:55] puberty blockers and and and and and
[1:51:57] hormones and things and they put a block
[1:52:00] on that to allow them to be able to give
[1:52:03] this stuff to children
[1:52:07] they said they went all the way and just
[1:52:09] stopped short of saying that miners
[1:52:12] could have surgeries to alter what they
[1:52:15] was
[1:52:18] right that's just around the corner
[1:52:21] they're insane
[1:52:26] last night I was telling my brother
[1:52:27] about a a young woman you know down in
[1:52:31] Tennessee that she I forget now she's
[1:52:34] about 20 years old or whatever it was
[1:52:36] but when she was a minor you know her
[1:52:38] parents she grew up she was kind of like
[1:52:40] a tomboy
[1:52:41] and then her parents started encouraging
[1:52:44] her well then you need to be a boy you
[1:52:46] know and as a young teenager she had a
[1:52:48] mastectomy and done all these other
[1:52:49] things you know and then when she got to
[1:52:52] be about 19 20 years old she decided I
[1:52:55] really want to be a woman
[1:52:57] and she said I can't believe my parents
[1:53:00] was letting me make life changing
[1:53:02] decisions when I was a minor
[1:53:08] parents look brother Adam says it's not
[1:53:10] juvenile delinquency it's parent
[1:53:12] delinquency
[1:53:14] but now we're talking about the things
[1:53:17] that maybe he talked about at that time
[1:53:18] now we're talking about all this
[1:53:20] craziness in the world
[1:53:25] and yet in the midst of all this crazy
[1:53:27] you know you can talk to some of these
[1:53:29] people and friends I'll tell you what
[1:53:30] they just cannot see what you're telling
[1:53:33] them
[1:53:37] they're all about the LBGTQ or whatever
[1:53:40] in the world
[1:53:46] they have rights
[1:53:51] yeah that's what Sodom thought
[1:53:53] that's right
[1:53:55] and when they come down you know the
[1:53:57] Angels come down to deliver a lot out of
[1:53:59] Sodom remember the the men of the city
[1:54:01] came and were pounding on lot's door and
[1:54:04] said give us those men that came in unto
[1:54:07] you that we might know them you know
[1:54:09] what know them means in the Bible
[1:54:12] and not said no I can't do that he said
[1:54:14] look I've got two daughters their
[1:54:16] virgins take them
[1:54:18] do you realize his daughters were
[1:54:20] married
[1:54:23] what's that tell you
[1:54:25] they were married to homosexuals
[1:54:32] that's what Sodom was destroyed for
[1:54:35] that's the world we're living in
[1:54:38] if God doesn't judge this world for all
[1:54:41] this
[1:54:42] stuff friends he would have to raise up
[1:54:44] Sodom and apologize to him
[1:54:49] think about how much we've got to thank
[1:54:51] God for
[1:54:53] he didn't have to open my eyes
[1:54:56] he could have easily passed me by
[1:54:59] for the age I was living in was wretched
[1:55:03] and blind
[1:55:05] but I heard recognizing your day
[1:55:11] Hallelujah
[1:55:13] serving seeds in perfect faith
[1:55:17] the Rapture and the message of Grace
[1:55:21] Lord I Thank you
[1:55:25] in a time when people are are live or
[1:55:28] live blinded by the organizations that
[1:55:31] they're under
[1:55:35] and your eyes have been opened
[1:55:39] oh what we've got to thank God for
[1:55:44] thank you Lord
[1:55:49] what example do we want to be to our
[1:55:51] children
[1:55:53] how do we want our children to be as
[1:55:55] they grow how do we want them to face
[1:55:57] trials
[1:55:59] how do we want them to face correction
[1:56:01] by the Lord
[1:56:03] I'll tell you something friends
[1:56:06] my daddy believed in correction
[1:56:08] and he taught us correction but not only
[1:56:10] correction but how to take the
[1:56:12] correction and you know how he taught us
[1:56:13] to take the correction after he'd whip
[1:56:16] us he'd say can I come over here and put
[1:56:18] your arms around my neck and tell me you
[1:56:20] love me
[1:56:25] sometimes Jesus corrects you but he
[1:56:27] loves you and that's why he's correcting
[1:56:29] you that's why he's not friends look
[1:56:31] he's that's why he's not letting you go
[1:56:33] you think of all the people in the world
[1:56:35] that just live how they want to live and
[1:56:37] do the the terrible things that they do
[1:56:40] and it seems like they just go without
[1:56:43] having to answer for it
[1:56:46] but God stops you
[1:56:48] some of you even before you actually
[1:56:50] even came to the Lord think of the times
[1:56:51] back in your youth when you was going to
[1:56:53] do a certain thing or something you had
[1:56:55] in your mind and something you don't
[1:56:57] know what something stopped you
[1:57:03] what was that that was the hand of God
[1:57:06] over your life even before you gave your
[1:57:08] life to the Lord friends you didn't
[1:57:10] start belonging to the Lord when you
[1:57:12] gave your life to the Lord you belonged
[1:57:15] to the Lord already that's why you gave
[1:57:16] your life to the Lord
[1:57:18] [Applause]
[1:57:23] I know where I came from
[1:57:26] and it lets me know where I'm going
[1:57:29] because I'm going back to where I came
[1:57:32] from
[1:57:33] yes Lord
[1:57:38] amen
[1:57:39] there's a coming of time
[1:57:42] when these old bodies and frail that we
[1:57:44] live in and the and and the the diseases
[1:57:47] we put up with and the sicknesses that
[1:57:50] we deal with and the ailments in our
[1:57:52] bodies there's coming a time when we're
[1:57:54] going to put off this old flesh house
[1:57:59] These Bars of bone and doors of clay are
[1:58:02] going to burst wide open one of these
[1:58:04] days
[1:58:05] and we're going to have a new body
[1:58:08] one that doesn't have heart disease
[1:58:10] sugar diabetes or high blood pressure or
[1:58:12] or cancer or anything else
[1:58:18] right now we need the Divine Healing of
[1:58:21] almighty God because of the bodies we
[1:58:23] live in
[1:58:24] we ought to thank God that he's here to
[1:58:26] give us that
[1:58:28] how many times have we faced something
[1:58:31] God came down and actually healed us
[1:58:37] friends I I've witnessed in my own
[1:58:39] church a couple that came and and they
[1:58:42] came because the the the the wife you
[1:58:45] know she was diagnosed with cancer and
[1:58:47] and the cancer was going to take her you
[1:58:49] know and she came up for prayer and I
[1:58:52] prayed over you know then I went to the
[1:58:54] hospital when she was going in and and I
[1:58:57] prayed you know and they went in there
[1:58:58] and they come out and they said we can't
[1:59:00] find no cancer
[1:59:02] you think she'd have been thankful and
[1:59:04] actually surrendered her life completely
[1:59:06] to God but she did not she left the
[1:59:09] church and went right out and went right
[1:59:11] back to drugs and everything else
[1:59:16] people ungrateful for the things God
[1:59:19] does want
[1:59:20] we ought to be grateful
[1:59:24] you say well brother I suffer from this
[1:59:27] disease or that one or whatever and God
[1:59:29] hasn't healed me God hasn't delivered me
[1:59:32] but God's given you the grace to go
[1:59:34] through it
[1:59:39] do you ever think sometimes there's
[1:59:41] things you go through
[1:59:43] that that once you face it the right way
[1:59:47] it's actually to be able to help
[1:59:50] somebody else that's going through
[1:59:52] something similar
[2:00:03] my son talked to me on the phone my
[2:00:05] younger son talked to me on the phone I
[2:00:06] don't know how many you know but you
[2:00:08] know we adopted five children and and
[2:00:11] the youngest one recently uh back toward
[2:00:14] the end of May he came back he had been
[2:00:16] gone for three years
[2:00:17] he came back and he said you are my real
[2:00:20] mom and dad
[2:00:21] he said I was looking for love and
[2:00:23] didn't know what I had
[2:00:26] he apologized to us for the awful things
[2:00:28] he had said about us when he left and
[2:00:30] all these other things and and he
[2:00:31] surrendered his life to God he was over
[2:00:33] in North Carolina and he said that he
[2:00:35] was working over there he is he has to
[2:00:37] travel for his work sometimes and he was
[2:00:39] over there and he said and all of a
[2:00:41] sudden in the middle of the night he had
[2:00:42] a nightmare of hell
[2:00:45] and he said and he woke up from it and
[2:00:48] he said I couldn't do nothing but call
[2:00:50] out to God
[2:00:51] he said and God showed me and revealed
[2:00:54] to me
[2:00:55] about what real love was and what I'd
[2:00:58] had had
[2:01:00] and he'd come back and you know he's
[2:01:03] going through some trials he said I I'm
[2:01:06] I'm sowing what I'm reaping what I've
[2:01:08] sold I know that
[2:01:10] he said and and but I need some advice
[2:01:13] dad
[2:01:14] and so you know we talked a little bit
[2:01:16] you know I said I'd be praying for him
[2:01:18] you know and and and and and you know
[2:01:20] and I wish sometimes you wish there was
[2:01:23] more you could physically do but you
[2:01:24] know something friends there's nothing
[2:01:26] really greater you can do than to point
[2:01:29] them to the god that has always took
[2:01:32] care of everything you've ever needed
[2:01:36] there is nothing greater you can do than
[2:01:39] to get them to trust in God for whatever
[2:01:41] they're going through
[2:01:43] the thing about it is the Bible says he
[2:01:46] works all things to the good of them
[2:01:48] that love the Lord
[2:01:50] even the bad things of Life get turned
[2:01:54] around and work to come out for your
[2:01:57] good
[2:02:11] I'm going to close
[2:02:18] Proverbs 25 11 says a word fitly spoken
[2:02:21] is like apples of gold in pictures of
[2:02:23] silver
[2:02:25] another translation of that is the right
[2:02:27] word at the right time is like Precious
[2:02:31] gold set in silver
[2:02:35] you remember the story of Hattie Wright
[2:02:38] brother Branham was telling about the
[2:02:40] squirrels that he spoke into existence
[2:02:42] and and this and the other and and she
[2:02:45] sat there and she said that's nothing
[2:02:46] but the truth
[2:02:49] and the angel of the Lord come down to
[2:02:51] brother Branham and said she said the
[2:02:53] right thing
[2:02:55] she said the right thing at the right
[2:02:57] time
[2:02:59] and he says you tell her that whatever
[2:03:01] she asks
[2:03:03] God will give her
[2:03:08] isn't that the thing that you want your
[2:03:12] children to the example you want to set
[2:03:14] for them
[2:03:16] during the times you end up instead of
[2:03:18] saying the wrong thing
[2:03:20] you said the right thing
[2:03:24] instead of acting the wrong way you
[2:03:26] acted the right way
[2:03:29] instead of giving them the example that
[2:03:31] Israel gave their children
[2:03:35] you know children friends growing up
[2:03:37] they'll either turn out to be just like
[2:03:40] you or or they'll turn out to be just
[2:03:43] the opposite
[2:03:44] you know my dad growing up said you know
[2:03:47] his dad was a drinker and everything
[2:03:49] else my dad never drank in his life
[2:03:56] well the end of that story is my
[2:03:58] grandfather finally gave his life to the
[2:03:59] Lord and he went on to be with the Lord
[2:04:01] so you know the end of the story was
[2:04:03] good
[2:04:04] but but what could he have lived his
[2:04:08] life like
[2:04:10] he said a wrong example
[2:04:13] a man told me one time he said he was
[2:04:16] complaining about the way that you know
[2:04:18] things were in his life and he was
[2:04:20] making excuses for how he reacted and
[2:04:23] things like that and he said I didn't
[2:04:25] have a daddy like you had I said my
[2:04:28] daddy didn't have a daddy like I had
[2:04:29] either
[2:04:30] but look what he done with it
[2:04:43] I look back
[2:04:45] at my parents life
[2:04:47] and friends I'm going to tell you what a
[2:04:49] Godly example
[2:04:51] I thank God for the parents he gave me
[2:04:55] you know I could have been born to
[2:04:56] anybody
[2:04:58] but God wanted me to be born to these
[2:05:01] people
[2:05:02] and he wanted me to come out the way I
[2:05:04] am
[2:05:06] and you know I don't feel bad about the
[2:05:10] way I am because that's the way God Made
[2:05:12] Me
[2:05:14] I only feel ashamed when I don't act
[2:05:17] right
[2:05:18] I I feel the same when I don't treat God
[2:05:21] right
[2:05:23] you know a lot of times we blame God for
[2:05:25] things
[2:05:26] it ain't God
[2:05:31] it's the devil
[2:05:34] don't blame God
[2:05:39] you know
[2:05:41] I told you about the young man that died
[2:05:43] at 45 you know
[2:05:44] some wanted some wanted to blame God
[2:05:49] you couldn't blame God
[2:05:55] he was the man that when I moved down
[2:05:58] there
[2:05:59] he wouldn't serve in the Lord and he was
[2:06:01] driving trucks long distance over the
[2:06:02] road you know being gone for weeks at a
[2:06:05] time
[2:06:08] and I went out
[2:06:10] and I when I first got down there I went
[2:06:13] out and I got me a little Rottweiler
[2:06:14] puppy
[2:06:16] you know and I really like that breed
[2:06:18] they just think
[2:06:21] but you know I I I really like them and
[2:06:26] I read all about them that's just how
[2:06:28] the kind of person I am I just got to
[2:06:30] know all about them
[2:06:31] and so I went over to his daddy's house
[2:06:35] and he was out there and we set out you
[2:06:37] know we were sitting on a picnic table
[2:06:39] and sitting out there and I I just
[2:06:42] talked to him about Rottweilers the
[2:06:44] whole time
[2:06:46] and after I left you know he told his
[2:06:49] daddy he said I ain't never met a
[2:06:51] preacher like that before
[2:06:52] he said not one time did he tell me you
[2:06:55] need to be in church
[2:06:57] said all he did was sit there and talk
[2:06:59] to me about dogs the whole time
[2:07:01] he said I never met a preacher like him
[2:07:04] he said I think I want to come to church
[2:07:08] and he came
[2:07:10] and he sat back there and when he came a
[2:07:13] message I was preaching was on marriage
[2:07:14] and divorce
[2:07:16] and I think that time you know and
[2:07:18] forgive me today I'm holding you longer
[2:07:19] but I think at that time I had to preach
[2:07:21] three hours
[2:07:23] and so he came up to the front
[2:07:26] afterwards you know and there was a lot
[2:07:27] of people came up to the front to be
[2:07:29] prayed for and when I saw him come to
[2:07:31] the front I just felt pulled to him and
[2:07:34] I went down there and waded through
[2:07:35] everybody that was standing there until
[2:07:37] I got back to him and laid my hands on
[2:07:39] him and he gave his life to the Lord
[2:07:43] the thing about it was friends he had
[2:07:47] went through something mentally some
[2:07:49] years before when he was 25.
[2:07:52] and you know and he he you know then was
[2:07:57] talking about taking his life but he
[2:07:59] wasn't ready to go
[2:08:01] and he was he he had mental illness
[2:08:05] there's nothing wrong with that it ain't
[2:08:06] no different than having diabetes
[2:08:08] there's nothing to be ashamed about
[2:08:10] it but I'll tell you this God can heal
[2:08:12] you just the same as he can heal you
[2:08:14] from anything else
[2:08:18] sure he's give doctors and knowledge and
[2:08:20] different things to try to help you but
[2:08:21] they can only go so far
[2:08:30] but here here some 20 years later
[2:08:33] he'd lose his life
[2:08:36] but he was ready to go
[2:08:40] I told him about the story of brother
[2:08:42] random talking about this this woman
[2:08:44] that he had went and prayed for you know
[2:08:46] and and said God healed her
[2:08:50] and then she told her husband she said
[2:08:52] I'm going home he said yep you're going
[2:08:54] to get out you're going to go home she
[2:08:55] said no that's not the home I'm talking
[2:08:57] about
[2:08:58] she said I'm going home
[2:09:00] and she died
[2:09:02] brother Bradham said he told God you owe
[2:09:05] me an answer
[2:09:07] you owe me an explanation
[2:09:09] he said you know what God did he said
[2:09:12] God let me sit and stew for about a
[2:09:14] month
[2:09:18] he said and then God told me he said go
[2:09:21] ask her mother
[2:09:23] about a time back when she was younger
[2:09:25] if she drowned
[2:09:29] brother Brandon went and asked her he
[2:09:30] said yeah
[2:09:32] she drowned but they revived her
[2:09:35] and the Lord told Brother Brown see she
[2:09:37] wasn't ready to go back then
[2:09:39] he said so I got her ready to go and
[2:09:41] then I took her
[2:09:44] God knows what you're going to face down
[2:09:46] the road
[2:09:50] Hallelujah
[2:09:55] my grandfather you know he gave his life
[2:09:58] to the Lord and he lived for seven
[2:10:00] months after giving his life to the Lord
[2:10:01] and the Lord took him home
[2:10:04] at the age of 54.
[2:10:07] young now you young people that you
[2:10:09] think that's old
[2:10:10] but I'm standing up here this morning
[2:10:12] I'm gonna tell you 54 is Young
[2:10:22] but there was things that happened on
[2:10:25] down the road within the church where we
[2:10:28] were at and things that came out that
[2:10:31] probably would have stumbled my
[2:10:32] grandfather if he would have lived to
[2:10:34] have seen it
[2:10:35] but God took him
[2:10:37] when he had him ready
[2:10:40] and then when my dad had the experience
[2:10:43] and testimony that he is giving you here
[2:10:45] of going beyond the curtain of time and
[2:10:47] seeing his daddy
[2:10:49] his daddy was there
