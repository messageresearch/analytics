the house tonight just the prayer request was given was just the crest here and you prayed for her she the temperature was very high when even when he had called right at 107 so she needs she needs a

Jesus we just lost and here Lord God within ourselves Lord we have no worthiness Lord but father to know that God that you have made us worthy Lord we have surrendered Lord on our lives and our hands Oh God and to know that we are branches and you are the vine Lord and that it's your life Lord that pulsates through us more than we lord the Rays Lord right now Oh desiring the Lord the flow of that divine energy Lord carve through the body Lord right now would make Lord of visitation Lord right there in that hospital room Lord there in Sandusky Lord for our sister Lord and father in the name of

and speak through us and hear through us more and father may our hearts and our lives be challenged and edified in you we pray Lord Lord we love you and we praise your father we give ourselves to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's turn to Romans chapter 8 and verse 35 very the very familiar passage of Scripture but what a water reality that that it is to our lie verse 35 of Romans chapter 8 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness pearl or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved it for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you've been seated when we have been looking at this with tests and trials and I thought what was only going to be a service or two it just continued to open you might say better sent me that's how it always is you know there's a lot of things that you open and I have to push on back because he won't he says it's not time yet so it isn't always things the opens is what's time and what's its season and I believe that's what we have need of is what's in season I you know many times you can you go to a service and go to a meeting and sometimes you go to you know you go to meetings and man these meetings were like man they were the best meetings there's the reason why is because meetings themselves God gives a word for the season and the word and season it that's how it ministers to is we said mine is there's like none other god ministers to us in season what we have neato and I believe that not just for meetings would go to but I believe that's the way in when we come to the house of God they say my you know this the service on Thursday my goodness they tell you what it wouldn't lie last Thursday and that's true God ministering his word in season and that's what's so precious about the Lord so when we look at this here we understand with tests and trials that brother Branham he gives us such a such an understanding within these things that and I believe that understanding is is so so necessary when we're looking at tests and trials and how that we would come into it I want to just I want to just look beyond that right now just for sake of time and perhaps maybe later this evening or maybe the next next time well refer to some of those places but you know it's where God Himself he's found you found favor with God when God has allowed a test or a trial to come your way and God believes you'll stand the test God doesn't give you a test knowing that you're gonna fail that's not how that's not the way God works God does not glory in failure he doesn't you know sometimes when I look at things that you know some when we as teachers when they were dealing with us we had to take a class on where you actually had to test your tests see if your test is valid you look at the standard deviation all these are the things in these highfalutin terms you know but really what it is is that is your test testing what it should be testing and what your testing is it why are you testing what you've taught and are you testing what you've taught in an adequate manner for the student to be able to show multiple levels of understanding and those are things that even when we look at the understanding of a believer there are things that as you walk on with the Lord I walk home with the Lord our understanding becomes greater but not greater in a sense to where we become more our heads get bigger but it's where that God the knowledge of God being unfolded and the Holy Spirit revealing to us to where it ins more than just something that's mental but it leads to a place of submission in our life and a greater trust it just continues to develop within our lives and that's and that's something that with in our lives as believe that continues to grow and God never with anyway desires to see failure and that's why that even when you look at it the scripture said God is love and you think of first Corinthians 13 where it says that love does not rejoice in in wrong love does not rejoice in iniquity love doesn't rejoice in that love doesn't rejoice in you know and you know and something of in a manner as though that getting even or have this was going to happen or no no love itself does not rejoice in iniquity or in wrong so when we look at these things of how that God brings maturity in our life and I believe that's exactly what his presence by his word will bring in our lives brother Branham you know when he's dealing with these things and telling us concerning that how that when God is giving us a trial that shows he's got confidence in you you if you look at it when the trial comes and you and you think my I didn't have this level of confidence in myself but God wants you and me to see what he sees he doesn't want us just to see what we can see now and just to think but God wants it to become further known to us personally of the great riches that we have within us and God allows the tests and trials to come to make those things real to us not the tester trial but to make real the reality that he is already placed in our lives so where you and I can recognize even in the midst of the trial that there is something and one greater than me or I could not do this I could not stand this way but there's one within me giving me the strength to stand in this manner that's God making it real in the midst of the trial well to think of this here tonight and I want to just kind of look at this in a manner of how that God dealing with things really even in the beginning and then how God working and maturing and the maturing within our lives as believers because Paul would deal with as we took our text last week of where that and Paul would call him the light afflictions that that would come our way and he would let us know that these light afflictions in verse 17 a first second Corinthians for there but for a moment they work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory and then in verse 18 while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal I believe there's levels within that as well within within verse verse 18 and I believe that the Holy Spirit teaches us and directs us within that and even our approach and how that we are looking at things and how that when we are we've come face to face with different things within our life that it's very much accustomed to where in our in the two realms the flesh and the spirit to look at things temporal very customed to do that but the inside man that has been fully regenerated it's that man that holds steady and it's that man that in the midst of the test in the midst of the trial remaining faithful and pulls all other things in line because Paul said it here the outward man perishes when we're going through a trial the outward man is not doing a jumping jacks and handstands and and everything else but the outward man is perishing the outward man is actually being brought in a place of dying but through that the inward man is being renewed the trial is not about glorifying the flesh the trial is to bring forth what God knows lays beneath the surface and the only way to bring that is it must show the frailty of the earth and vessel in which the excellency of the power is closed think about brother Branham brings this in three kinds of believer in this particular quotes what I'm gonna working with your tonight brother BAM goes into this here and he says sometimes believers put to the test and he says not sometimes every time for every Sun that cometh to God must be chastened tried and child trained every Sun this is where even when the Prophet is laying this this this this message out that through the midst of tests and trials in actually will bring on display even the believers that are there believers make believers unbelievers it brings it brings to display and God allows that to come because God doesn't withhold now what you think of this here God does not withhold his tests there are the tests or the trials because well this one's not a believer or this was not no God doesn't spare INRI holding back tests and trials but God permits it to come and remember the Scriptures if we endure chastening then he deal it with us with sons you see if if there we cannot stand the test then how can he place anything in that see that Scripture in Hebrews 12 not only pertains to us coming into the place of a full experience with God but it also that's that's portion of Scripture also deals with a maturing of a son and daughter of God coming clear into that adoption time that maturing it also deals with it if it's like brother Ram tells us in time tests and material when the man when they wanted to build that bridge there I believe it was in Australia they they had every kind of people that said there's no way you can do you can do it but there was a man who says I can do it and the man was not boasting he just said I can do it but what he was dealing with is that he went down to us to that of a rock and you hear familiar this he went down to Iraq and he fixed that so that the bridge would be supported on the rock but that alone now you've got a rock a place to which the bridge can be built on but that man had every single boat tested he had every beam tested he had to make sure that what he's putting in that bridge that it's got to be sufficient and equality and that's the way when God Himself will allow test he'll oust rest and trials to come away and was in all of that if we endure he deal it with us as sons and that's where the scripture said there's no one who's not as far as a partaker of chastisement or of chain of chastening no one is without that but if we receive that then it is a declaring that were not illegitimate but we are children of God that receiving it doesn't mean that we understand everything it doesn't mean that let's just look at this here for a moment because you see when we're looking at it think of how that the Scriptures and I'm just just going to take my time here with with just this portion of it every son that cometh to God must be chastened tried and trial child train that requires such such mindfulness faithfulness by God and long-suffering it requires that sometimes remain you know we we think about some are slower learner summer her or look at the same thing when we look at things how God will deal with things within our life and there's things God is working personally in our life in a spiritual manner and this chastening listen God's not interested in just always correction God's manner of correction is not always if we could say it like this putting something on you to drive you into a place but remember part of the chastening child training in all of is one who sets down and makes time to develop a full counsel everything that's involved because there's things that you know in your life let's just look at it in a natural there's things that you've come through in the natural that you're able to pass on to someone else there's certain things with those of you who have in college or you've been through college there's certain things that you know how to pass on to others who would be entering in there's little things that you can say that would comfort those who would be entering into that same thing with those of you within your job or whatever more of course you get next time I don't go into what I'm doing I'm doing you know what I go into what I'm doing no I don't wanna talk to you either that was free but you see everything that you know that that you have there's things that God even when when calling us to the different things it's very helpful and it's mindful and you don't want to look you don't want to paint all the bleakness and every all the hardness of and the my goodness this was gonna be a rough thing I tell you are you ready for it it's such a hard thing you know it you scared the people to death I'm gonna ask you this you could think of it like this and these things everything we're saying we need to be drawing it from the character of Christ not just what we're saying but in what we're doing God does not put fear into us even when God made known to things that was going to unfold in the ages yet his word that I friends I can't figure that out but I know what the prophets said and I believed that when brother Branham when he was ministering that the the the summer teenage brother brems says if he would have told the people in that age everything that was going to fully befall them which he did declare that but yet there's a part of it and even in what was declared that God was held and program said less fear should take them yet that was a word that was promised but see guano's God releases the necessary preparation for you and I to be able to face what is coming that's his word when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will raise a standard against it what good does it do to teach to tell you know like tell him Zachery about all these in here you gotta watch you know defensive driving and right he's not even close to driving you know what I mean why would I tell him that but there's things that I can tell him about things that he can relate to now that will carry on later on in his life the driving maybe he understands now is you know you you wrecked you get another life but the removal look at this there's a whole council there's not a removal but there's a guiding through these things and your brother branham makes this statement and this is what just so gripped my heart I haven't looked at this but I tell you just so gripped my heart brother Graham says remember the trials the dusty roads the hot Sun of persecution the loyalty but the loyalty of your heartbeats that material till she's ready to go into the mall that's what I want to deal with here tonight I've already been dealing with it but a few more moments the loyalty of your heart notice what he says the loyalty of your heart beats that material so the trial is more precious than gold because the trial what does it do the trial of your faith and that faith is that loyalty and that loyalty beats the material so the act remember character is molded by the character of life in you so write the character of life inside of a wheat is declared the germ itself brings forth all the characteristics of that wheat so the loyalty beats the material oh my I'd say there's just a way the things to be said like this this is understanding the loyalty of your heart beats that material till she's ready to go into the mold my God's children is made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the Word of God living through them the trial he said it comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see where you'll stand they tested tried every son that come up to God and what you think of this here in the scriptures if I just can refer to it in in in the places they're in in Matthew and Luke and in the gospel they're where they will refer to the sowing of the word of God and remember how that the Lord Jesus he lays it out that there is four different grounds that are there the word it's the seed is the word of God but you have four different grounds you the wayside you have the rock you have those that have thorns and then you have the good ground that good ground is not something that a person has made themselves good ground it was already ordained to be good ground but it doesn't mean that that good ground did not have to go through the process of being called sanctified and filled it goes through that process declaring it was always the ground so you see all of this the good ground it had things that need to be cleared out of its life right you just couldn't plant something in it and things that have to be clear so I had to receive a call there are things that have to be cleared out of its life in order for the planting to go forth but it is ordained as good ground and this is the thing that wants you to look at in verse 15 these are are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience bring forth fruit with patience Wow so if I plant an apple see the understand listen the understanding of a little would be if you plant this Apple see daddy we're gonna have apple crisp next year I wish you understand they're not the little ones not questioning is the seed gonna come forth is it gonna come up but it's understanding years it's just time is it is it gonna come for that we're gonna have apples next year we're gonna have a bunch of apples we have apple pie and up no but you see the understanding listen to me now the understanding for us as children of God and you take four four four four four lives that are just born into the kingdom and I believe we all have to be reminded of it that that's the word itself that when God speaks a word and declares a word just because he spoke it does not mean it's happening that moment but when the word goes forth there is things set in motion they set in motion when the word has been spoken it's set in motion when the Prophet was here he spoke and declared the word that God had ordained for this generation he did not see that word come to pass but it set things in motion and we're seeing that word come to pass he could see it being fulfilled look at it where he could say that she you know and in the earlier parts of the message as she will be she will be she will be then he makes this they makes the declaration in rising the son she is him his preaching listen to me now he's preaching aware that when you look at it and you take the expanse of the age after the Prophet leaves the scene much was dealt and emphasized on God sent a prophet is that right but God that was necessary for that to be what to catch up to this so the Hammad the wild has already been spoken over this generation God is not taking back that one but that one has set things in motion and then when that word has come across your pathway my pathway it sets things in motion it's because of that word when it begins to deal with your life that's what causes you to separate from other things it's because the word begins to draw you and have precedence in your life that's why the Prophet could say Abraham separated from Locke because of the promise he was holding it's a very powerful statement in this message God's Word calls for total separation Jesus was separated from the world this is this separation was not about I want to be different I'm gonna be awed we're gonna be strange there was not what the separation was what brought the separation was not just a word that we're looking at but a word that was taking hold in their heart and they seen this cannot continue on a word that brings a separation what was it that separated Aaron and the Levites unto God word a word that declared of a sacrifice that had already went forth God said I've received all the rest of the sacrifice of Israel that I take Levi unto myself so what that points out this has already been done then I may freely bring you to myself and they laid in that word and it brought a separation so it doesn't mean because in the scriptures in Matthew 13 these same scriptures when it's talking about the parable the sword it seeks of the good ground he that heareth and understanding understand that doesn't mean that we know all things it doesn't mean that we can explain all things it doesn't mean we can put all things together but that understanding that a word is spoken is the same understanding that the Prophet would speak in hearing and understanding he said a drunkard hear it and remain a drunkard a prostitute could hear it and remain a prostitute he said but him that understand it it means he that sees and is born again then he said their change forever that's a difference the word must be heard and brought to that place and drawn to that first notice I want you to look at this here in Luke 21 verse 12 before all these things look what Jesus is speaking here to to the disciples and through the people they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake this isn't running them away the reality of this is not striking their hearts but you see like people that are falling in love and sometimes there's a time for everything let me huh there's a time for me you know I mean yeah we're living off love but there's a part of that yet that you want to live off love but love don't put groceries in the fridge is that Alright love don't put gas in your tank the truth though salmon that's just the way you think well what I'm trying to say is is that when love is striking hearts they don't see all the hardships when God is dealing with with your heart on the promise and of himself you don't see all the hardships you don't see all those things any that end that is not even all the focus of well this or that that's not even the focus notice what he says in verse 13 and it shall turn to you for a testimony it shall turn to you for a testament what shall all of this is gonna take place which I'll turn to you for a testimony I want you to think of this right here just in that scripture alone we could pull up writing of believers who have died before us and I will say it more correctly are asleep and are waiting on us once you think of this when we read these things in the scripture you read of different ones who have went on different ones and it wasn't just older young ones as well that stood there's some 17 years old some younger than that and they stood right there they were delivered up unto the rulers and magistrates and they stood faithful God allowed that testimony to be recorded and what stands out to us it's not everything else that they had done in their life but the testimony the stand that was made in that moment it was the it declare itself in that moment but I want to I want you to look at this if we don't even have to go back as though to have such a lens that would reach so far back remember it's even to recognize this of what God even around us with brothers and sisters of like precious faith friends I'm not just talking about looking around the church but yet also but I am saying looking at brothers and sisters that what you can see is is that through the test of time and you realize serving the Lord for any length of time it's not something that comes without hardship but its grace is sufficient and you can look at that and you can take encouragement from their lives I'll tell you I do I look at lives and veteran lives and you know we we still have right here in the assembly many that were of pillars when this work was getting started and I can look at not just at them but but others as well but I'm saying you know I look at that and I think of what brother Branham would talk about with brother and sister short I think about what brother Ram would say remember what he says he said Here I am he said I stand out there and look at them he said and I think Lord what am i complaining about you see one of the ones this wasn't about the brother and sister short had some great wealth of understanding but their love of God was in their heart the loyalty that was within their heart it brought such a respect that the Prophet he would call in in some places rugged Christianity gallant men and gallant men and women he would speak of these things you see this was important when he he takes the message the opening message a future home and he takes a great space within there and he speaks on character reports that he's received from the different restaurants and Warner for more he's received he's received reports of a life that's being lived outside that's why brother Branham was remember he was ever so quick when there were things that were anything that would bring a reproach on the Tabernacle in ministry so our brother Brian was so quick with on those things even remember when at a situation where a person had ran up a bill remember that and they ran up a garage bill and they just relented go they weren't paying for and brother ram tells us they sent down and said hey when they're gonna have that best thing looking bad on the church but the individual had done it and just you know went on their way but brother Branham he stood there with he stood within that now let me just make a little disclaimer I'm not advocating I'm gonna take care of people's bills but you know what I'm trying to get you to the place to understand so we'll be going to charge a bunch of stuff you know further savings gonna stay with the word I sure AM live within your harvest live within your means just a little disclaimer let my foot know we don't want that small riding we want a big riding but what I'm trying to look at here is the Lord would bring it to my heart is that we want our desire is in everything because you know what there are things that people see you and I under pressure they saw me under pressure and the job they see you under pressure and the job they see you and I you know that is that's real Christianity on display you'll turn for your testimony this is where you had that goes on to talk about I mean to think about this it's Bill here that how they would be betrayed some in verse steamed by parents another by kinfolk and friends and brethren and some of you shall be calls to put to death and you shall shall be hated of all men for my namesake notice for my name's sake you're gonna be heated but there shall not a hair of your head perish he just said therefore the same that some of them may even be put to death but the scripture is true not one of your head shall perish you might be put to death but you don't die amen the fear of death has been removed let me tell you something God prepares each and every one of his children look at this in verse 19 in your patience possessed of your soul that's what we're dealing with here this patience patience is that of a steadfastness a constancy in endurance and in the New Testament it's the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently in steadfastly waiting for patient and during sustaining perseverance now we need to give honor to whose honor honors do you think of it tonight when you can look in your heart and I can look in my heart and say Lord but the brain was talking about how that a person was singing Amazing Grace and brother brandman just finished preaching time-tested memorials and Brent says Oh God he said what a lovely song that was said to just go right along with the message he said and how that we as your people can reflect and think you know how that we've stood faithful and he said it's only been by your grace so we want to give glory and honor to whom honor and glory that this loyalty of heart is not something that we put in there but this loyalty of heart that is beating the material under the tests and trials this life this reality that has raised us up it all began because there was a lawyer one when there when man had completely forsaken and left his no way no in no way back at all but the lawyer one I will give thee a seat and he was loyal to his word and that loyalty produced itself in a body of flesh faithful to his word loyal and that royalty beat itself out in perfect obedience complete submission when everything was coming around this way he committed himself unto God who is faithful in all judgment there's things he could have think of it if Jesus would have taken the time to try to answer every single question and dispute everyone that disagree with him there would have been so much that would not have been been able to be said but it's not just being said there would been many people who would have been left in conditions he did not occupy himself with that but what was he occupied with the will of the Father he was tested to be pulled a certain way they remember when he they were trying to pull him to come down to the grave of life but one whom thou lovest trying to work there in his in innocent in his spirit there and trying to tamper with that affection gate you know the one you love but you see he shelled listen he was not showing something that you or I are not called to be but he was showing that if our devotion is to the will of God we receive strength to resist in this time see it isn't just about well I'm not gonna do this no no strength coming from the Lord David said he is my buckler that word Butler is my strength so it's not just a strength it's not just something we carry like a you know a belt pack or something behind us no we're looking to him that in the midst of this my strength to move through and resist and overcome coming from the Lord nay in all these things we are more than through him who loved us so this loyalty is because there was a one than loyal one and that loyalty that then come by that life now coming in to our lives calling us cleansing placing his life within us to wear that you and I can say hey it's Christ see all praise and adoration goes to him that the loyalty of art is because his life is dwelling within me you as me the fasces look at this these were guys reading the word but they were not loyal they were not loyal and doing this doing this doing this but what they failed to what they did not know brother man tells us they knew the history of the god of Moses but they did not know the god of Moses what is the god of Moses it's the living image its Christ they didn't know him they only knew a letter a letter is not a living image but a living image gives life and gives the depth the height the breadth of the Word of God that's why God when God would call us in this hour God did not even in this hour of how that God himself he came even when he became one of us he didn't send down well you need more laws you need a stricter code no he came to fulfill what was there by his own life on living image God sending his word he did not just say no word it's a living image of that word this is where that James could talk about the trying of your faith my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing look patients what patience but steadfastness that loyalty of faith let it have its perfect work the listen your life your testimony my testimony it's not made overnight it's not a microwaveable dish experiences in your life the things that you have went through listen to me now even things that you could not say well the Lord you know that I was suffering for the glory of God though sometimes there's decisions we've made that had nothing to do with the glory of God this is where the scripture comes true though all things work together for the good that's why it isn't saying well this one's to the glory of God let me rip this down and throw it away no mozart may have crumbled up many but all of those mistakes all of those things along the line all of those experiences went to make great masterpieces and the Prophet tells us everything that he you know like this masterpiece hallelu it's not was that not as not without learning we're learning you know it's none of its comfortable for us to go back and look at our failures it's not comfortable look at our mistakes nobody not one of us likes to do that but yet within it when we go back and say Lord tell me what whoa what was it within this here what where did I where did I fail within this work because we know that any failure its failure was here and it requires it requires the Lord to teach us and he will teach us and one thing about the God God doesn't turn around and put our nose in it that's not him he's chastening he's molding he's admonishing us in our lives so let patience have her perfect work oh my brother Brent tells us like this he says job went through trials and the tests his children taken everything else taken the church members come accused him of being a secret sinner and tried to say something against him but yet he wouldn't listen to any of it I want you to want you to look at this you know I say it's just so tempting just to go and just preach all the way on Java I love that study that we took some years ago with on that because you find that how joke he had his ups and downs job had the times that were joven said I wish it would been that there had never been an announcement that a man child is born you know our job was saying I wish I had never been born the testing and the trying the scripture said Joe declares it that even his wife's breath was strange to him I don't have to t I've taught that before but that's a pretty it goes pretty deep that you can understand it had affected everything around his marriage his family things was being affected by the tests and by the trial was going on you find that even in the scripture that when Joe said I know my Redeemer liveth as we looked in that years ago you look right after those verse in the scripture you find Joe coming right back down into another situation of loneliness yet you say well that was a path a part of the scripture that was a powerful revelation I agree just like when you and I are going through tests and trials everything that God drops our way is powerful it gives us strength along the way that revelation didn't bring Jove out but that revelation gave him strength you're not the outer man the outer man was perishing but it strengthened the inner man that's why James would say have you considered the patience of Job patience this that's what this patience is this loyalty of heart and to think of it in how that Joe when he looked brother and says like this he knowed I want you to catch these these these these thoughts here he knowed he had met God's requirements what you think of it God had revealed to Joe what was the acceptable way that was subtle he was standing right there on that I met God's requirements this is what God has revealed this is what God has spoken I mix I have met his requirements next part he no there's no need of Satan trying to tempt him trying to tempt him on what God's requirements you're not going to tamper with this revelation you're not going to tamper with is the message writer Israel you're not tampering with that look because the church has said it but it's Christ been revealed to me in a tampering with that look how many websites and blog posts and everything else it doesn't matter we're gonna say one of you can't understand everything let me tell you something friends there's a lot of things that can be laid out right here that I don't fully understand let me just give you an example while we're talking of it I can go through many different many different things but I hear it was I come out of here than one night and I just got done preaching and this is just one example that it comes to me right now I come out of here and-and-and-and brother Brown was and he made a statement he talks about Abraham and he said Abraham being the greatest man on the earth not to you that may not have been a big thing but I thought greatest men on the earth where's working lord help me and I wasn't doubting that no understand what I'm saying I'm talking about me understanding so when I'm looking at it and understand you know me I don't make every word thus saith the Lord the Prophet didn't do that he actually and chided those in Canada in the message key to the door he said remember I'm not infallible I didn't say that he said that I don't have no problem with that but the reality is is that within all of it how that God see God they're allowed God will allow things to come across our pathway that you look and you say wow but then right when eyes I'm leaving off the platform and walking back three years the Spirit of God just took a hold of that and you know I preached that service here the following Thursday sometimes it don't happen that quick you understand what I'm saying I'm saying that there are things that you don't always and I don't always there's nothing's that you can figure out and fully understand and neither are your efforts to try to pry into it and make it understand God reveals all things in his time he will reveal it when we have meat of it absolutely they're saying the understanding that that God has brought to to our hearts and lives so here notice this here and I that was just one quick example you say my brother sent me that just turned around within moments of time that's true but there's other things that I've said sometimes and it's things I had read in the scripture I didn't understand and here it was 10 years later here's a brother standing here as speaking and his brother is the only time one time he'd been here he's been returned on the other side of the earth and he's standing right here ministering and all of a sudden that scripture opens what did you do with it I just put before the Lord because I'm not going to try to create understanding out of things God Himself brings understanding man gets a hold of it it turns into presuming and the things that man starts constructed you don't look like the image listen to me it might be things where they're taking things seemingly word-for-word that brother Bama said but you start looking at what's being tried to drive down and what kind of image is being produced you say mm-hmm that ain't holding true to the image of Christ that ain't home true so you see how that here he knowed he and met God's requirements he know there's no need of Satan trying to tempt him he knowed it was the devil he's closed in right on that on that does he he needs understanding and as long look at this as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had Joubert he nolde he'd met God's requirement Satan couldn't tempt him on that the devil he couldn't get to that he knowed that was the devil so thing about the devil couldn't tempt him on it look at this quote he knowed it was the devil if the enemy was coming to tempt him and come against his sacrifice he'd say get out of here thing nice sacrifice is accepted and I am accepted sacrifice you mean acceptance is not so much about him understanding everything no neither is that you either as long as Satan can make him believe that his sickness was his God doing it he had job whipped and listen to me now safe and whipping joke right there on that and nothing to do with the loyalty of his heart but God is faithful to his word and him we are walking in his word then God will come and give understanding to us as we have need of it James said if any man lack of wisdom let him look up and ask God is that right but when job once struck that revelation that it was not God he was only going through his trials to make him something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing anti I know you know we said here Dan I think that's a me that's just not a great big thing but it is a great big thing it is because the same way that he came against Joe is the same way that he comes against you you say brother Samuel elaborate good like that when sickness and other things come your way you don't get the job promotion you're looking for sickness comes your way this doesn't happen or these things takes place what's the very first thing and listen as a believer we always want to examine our lives is that true we're taught that you examine your life first Lord is there any way that any place that I am I'm falling short if there's any way and truthfully listen in our lives we all desire to be closer to the Lord but you understand what I'm saying with sickness and other things would come the very first thing and this is where understanding comes and where it is needful you say why so that we're not walking around oh oh so terrible I'd if I only had faith if our faith doesn't mean that you're gonna be healed like that you know friends that I used to know an individual that you know their whole statement their phrase was my faith keeps sickness away from me I prayed for that individual I said God they're gonna face something one day but they're gonna need faith that comes in a different angle that carries them through sickness it might be true they're delivered of this and delivered of that deliver to this but that's not all there is to it because there is suffering he had left his church a measure of suffering right Paul said fill up behind me the suffering that is left so faith itself is not always about I don't have to go to a doctor I don't have to do it yes that's not that that leads in a way of pride and God will let you go maybe for years but then you're bringing right around but you know what I've watched also how God brought even and would bring that situation right around to where the individual has recognized it see grace grace I mean why would you why would you pray that way because friends we're talking about a balance in our walk and life that's what I'm preaching here tonight I'm dealing with these things as God is laying them with tests and trials it's a balance in our life and a balance is not compromised a balance is not powerless a balance is knowing where you're standing in full authority so in sickness and other things comes your way it's not you let me get back to this point it's not you or I walking around in a situation where we're all you know walking around beat down I'll tell you what I must have veiled God you know it must be something about it I as I've said over the years God doesn't hold things behind his back and saying guess where you're failing no again no God doesn't play sorry to use such vernacular as that but God don't play he's not playing games he's interested in molding and shaping and making you and I if there is anything in our life that is lacking when our heart is open God Himself will bring those things through our attention and it is remedy and we don't have to wait you see what this word the teaching of the word does it removes tradition that can come over come on somebody it removes tradition that can come over traditions that come over like they came to Joe and must have done something wrong Jovi must be bad must be something going on and then it can come on over to where it's like we have to do Pitons for years and days all of a sudden I get to a place I'll be better you with me it's got perching God's cleansing of these things within our lives he was only going through his trials to make him something it wasn't God doing it it was Satan doing it a quick check it's looking examing in our life and then within it within the midst of it recognizing that it's God that's overseeing our lives yet while Satan came to test him and try him on this I'm closing I really am Joe was still a believer he was still a believer this is a dis didn't make him not a believer you mean because he was thinking Claude was doing it he wanted to believe he was still a believer sure he was a believer he needed his mind renewed he needed a renewing like Titus speaks of renewing by the Holy Ghost not book-learning but renewing by the Holy Ghost and listen this this did not happen by all of a sudden just something just being dropped God king and visited job gone allowed all of those other men to say what they had to say and remain silent he said I thought ancient shall speak first everything's been said now her comes le sacrifice makes way for Joel to speak lip to hear and hear God after joke the Prophet says he stood flat-footed flat-footed doesn't mean he understood everything I know I keep coming to that it keeps coming forward flat-footed means he was standing or God had revealed imma tell your friends that's the reality Revelation holds you it's true there is an anchor that's why Jesus said upon this rock I will build my church this message is not learning hope I can say this freely I can this is my church I can save this this right here the message is not something where all of a sudden we'll get you to Calvary then we'll take you to the message you don't know where Calvary is act without the message of the hour I'm talking about a true atonement a true reality a true call how would Philip have taken them to Jesus how would he have taken unto Jesus if he didn't know Jesus I'm talking about a real Calvary not a Calvary where just you look at him say oh my yeah he felt sorry for me he loved me he'd that for me now I'm talking about the real ministry of Calvary let's speak someone who died that he might make a way that you and I might be brought into a union with Almighty God it's not higher learning the message is not theology it's not doctrine it's a life of Jesus Christ as Christ revealed to us Alleluia I shared this with some other brothers you know some of you heard for the bram time have you heard brother bisque will talk about this and well the fiscal mate he know he came out he made that he made the statement he was ministering few years back and he said questions he said you think I haven't had questions didn't think they're any things and I've read that I haven't had questions about he said one of the questions once he said is how in the world can somebody enter into life by just giving somebody else a cold drink of water this is brother Bissell's he's a how Lord he said and then once you catch this he said I carried that with me for years he said here I was getting ready to preach a meeting overseas and I got down to pray and that was not even my thought but he said the Holy Spirit came and gave the scripture he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man who receive a righteous man's reward the Holy Spirit that's the answer right there why didn't God just give right in and give it right away because he doesn't want brats sorry to be so frank he doesn't want brat he's raising sons and daughters waiter he's over my understanding right away that's where faith and trust comes in that's where the revelation proves itself that's why all these things that have that got not permitted it all to come up even for the advancement of the internet and also things God allowed that to come the way it did why he could show this word is not the word of a man it could show that revelation cannot be seen God allowed that God will allow dual arms to be rubbed with different ones who turned around and left and hope those saying I'm not writing anybody away I'm not focusing on that what I'm showing is is that with all of that taking place it ought to declare of something that's a greater reality in you that you look at and say this I'm a part of this is a part of me what is it it's a love of God is not doctrine is the things that I can happen that I look because I can explain this and I can explain this and I can explain this why I told you I was closer than I am let's think so I don't keep going perhaps said the same thing today look at this same thing today he'll try to tell you these trials and things is your God trying to put punishment upon you it isn't so no sir even in God's discipline he disciplines with a vision any discipline is always with where everything lays even within the future those things I believe this is very important no we've met God's requirements know where we're standing that God would remove from us the line of thought the trials are bad remember as we said last week we're not praying lord give me trials that's not a training but it removes from months the line of thought the trials are bad it forms of punishment it removes that the real punishment and only true punishment to a believer it's when his presence we stand like Moses Moses said if your presence does not carry us up don't even carry us for how shall we be separated from all the rest of the nations of this earth not because that we have some some name as far as these were people were down in Egypt they were called out these are people of Israel is his presence his presence his name being revealed his life that's what separated them from the rest of the earth that's the same thing in our lives our lives were many times those things that we do not understand how this is going to work out this is going to happen everything that's going to take place all this it just like this right here we know things that are coming up on this earth is that right we know that we know there are things that's coming but God has not left look when the prophet has spoke concerning those things and what identified here in the word of those things that are coming up those things were not spoken in a manner for us to meditate on them and dwell on is that we might know but our trust is in the Lord said brother Simon what do you mean his look to him who he is and he gives strength right now and in that moment he will also give strength and BR strength I hope that makes sense to you sometimes you can get in your mind what am I going to do but they sent me to a concentration camp what do we do I know how you look the enemy can fire all these different things you can fire all this that's not even for us to be worried it's not a worry I'll tell you this right now the RAM says I see nothing left nothing left but the coming of the Lord if we're waiting and any be waiting on certain things well this is gonna happen this is gonna happen we say something in other nations they're already experiencing church doors have been closed they can't even meet right now in Russia they're not even allowed right now they're already experiencing these I tell you within our lives with everything it's Lord let me be ready every movement God will provide listen to me now in the men in the in the church age book program takes into a place Polycarp and all the different ones I believe friends with all my heart this is real leadership our lives the Prophet tells us God will give supreme grace for the supreme I think sometimes people have in their mind that we're gonna go through martyrdom and all these other things it can be difficult days but friends listen we are not we are not destined under an ox anointing we are destined under an eagle anointing rapture we're not running from anything there's been some of our brothers and sisters even now and even but the years they've had to give their lives but God calling us into rapture I believe the word listen loyalty in itself even when a person has met God face to face there's been a work that's done within your life there's a loyalty of heart that beats the materials but as time and has under the word how that God deals with our heart get matures and you find that patients that's strength growing [Music] I remember there's things earlier in my life serving the Lord my dad would talk about certain things of testing I thought you got to be kidding me did you see what it is I wasn't at that place I did some tests and I had some trials some things that that a part of beginning but it was nowhere where one now there was a seasoned veteran was experiencing things but that's where us listen as being a seasoned veteran you want to be a representative and an example of what loyalty of heart Paul drew the attention to the to the Church of these things look I just don't use let's just bar ants oh Jesus you are so faithful you you Lord you you give to us Lord the understanding what we have need up when we needed I'm so thankful Lord and ourselves Lord that we don't have to pry I'd have to push the Lord you can look up to you what Jesus you are a strengthening father no standing here tonight and others more than streaming and will be Lord God not just those Lord that would be a part of this assembly because I know that there's so many more your bride around the world some that's gone on Lord father what testimonies what testimonies of that loyalty of find Nora say that will God looking Lord standing before me Lord lives will guard than you moulding she be your God that loyalty that beats in the heart no God that beats the material heart until it's ready to be put in the mold Lord we see tonight as we're looking more God in the word and we thank you too Lord because we know that God it is you that has placed that deposit in our lives and God as we stand there Lord the revelation Lord is so struck a heart [Music] Lord we think your father and I pray God if there's one here tonight that that revelation Lord hasn't struck lord I pray that God that there would be that of Lord a humility of the heart that God where they can just lift the heart up before you tonight and say Lord drive it down Detroit oh god I want to know that Lord I want that reality Lord that that revelation striking Lord in my heart boy Oh God where it's not a lifestyle where it's not a teaching but it's your life a love affair Paul would speak Lord who shall separate us from the love of Christ [Music] what we know that even in the days were Paul there was some Lord by the name of Jaime nice and philetus they took teachings of Paul but there's things in Lord God he wasn't he wasn't the thought the thought that Paul had preached in regarding resurrection they themselves Lord as Peter would say wrestled these things that they could not understand they wrestled it to their own destruction and when they begin to speak that the resurrection has already passed they began as your prophet could say take the word hear it and as karna men put a carnal interpretation to it father would see that God how that there were many many a faith that was overthrown but as you declared through Paul to Timothy at the foundation of the Lord standard as sure the Lord knoweth them that are his and he declared that in a house in a great house there are many many many many vessels Lord there were those who stood and even when that teaching would come there was a lot of loyalty of heart that beat and it held Lord in you Lord father it shows it shows Lord that teaching alone teaching is necessary but it's teaching by the Holy Spirit you coming and revealing your word but just Lord to have knowledge is not enough it will never hold it will allow Lord people to explain but when something comes that challenges that Lord God hold father has the scripture could say no I was shunned we are not ashamed Lord we know by the grace of God where we are standing Lord how we thank you Lord God for your mercy Lord I pray tonight may your grants strength Lord to every heart Lord some Lord God going through different tests going through different trials going through different things law father I pray that in the midst of it Lord not just for this this this moment of time but father may we grow may the Word of God Lord just just Lord elevating us helping us to see giving us understanding Lord you you didn't remove the test or the trial from Joel but through that test of trial you made yourself more real to Joel than you ever had out of that testing out of that trial it wasn't just Joe come came walking out of that test to trial but through out of that experience patience came forth and because then of patience there was hope that came forth we don't read Lord any more of jobs life the Father we know that God the example you included there was for us and we can see Lord your faithfulness more not just there but in our own lives so I pray God tonight then may we not look Lord upon the test of trials of one another and Lord meaning that we would make ours greater or even make ours littler but may we recognize that Lord the season and the test and trial is permitted by you and it has come Lord personally it's for us truly Lord our outward men in parishes but the inward man is renewed Lord we think your fathers were reminded of these things that it's not our faithfulness it's your faithfulness that loyalty in the heart that beats the material Lord gives strength continue to give Lord encouragement and strength to each part to each life Lord Lord we love you we praise you you love him I trust I trust it was clear to your hearts tonight amen and whatever that I may have butch it up I know he'll make it clear I have to have that rest but in everything that's a beautiful beautiful reality we're trusting as the Prophet gave us direction he said stay in the ship like Paul said hey he said the Lord the angel of the Lord had showed me not a man perish if you abide in the ship there was gonna be tests that would come but I stay in the ship I make you water splashed in my face but I'll stay in the ship I it may be rocking I think it's seasick but I'll stay in the ship in that right I'd rather be here than be anywhere there's no other place I'd rather be then be in Jesus Christ aren't you thankful to the Lord we're just gonna let you be dismissed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I sing that song take the name of Jesus with you if you want to stay in
