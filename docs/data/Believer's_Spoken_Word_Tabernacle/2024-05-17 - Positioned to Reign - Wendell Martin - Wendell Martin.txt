all things are [Music] possible be [Music] believe all things [Music] areus [Music] is my Jesus Is He And all things are are possible Jesus is here oh Jesus is here amen Oh my Jesus is here and all things are possible Jesus is amen you believe that tonight amen brought your lick of fire with you amen you know I want to say first of all it's so good to have each and every one of you it's a real blessing to have the visitors here in our gates and what a privilege it is is amen it's just wonderful to see God's people amen that you would take time to come and share in this moment with us because after all when God has really spoke to your heart and touched your life you realize I'm a stranger and I'm a pilgrim in this world that's right and you realize that your real family is the family of God Amen it's just something to me it's always special with that you can meet somebody the very first time another believer but it's like you've known him forever and actually it's more than forever we go back clear back to the mind of God you've heard people sometimes say we go way back well we go way back and we go back to that reality of sons of God who were shouting for Joy amen I believe that we are the living Witnesses of what was in God's mind yes sir and we're expressing that Joy what the prophets longed for that's right amen they prophesied of Calvary prophesied of the Resurrection but it was also looking forward to this day when there would be an ending and a wrapping up of all things we know Israel is only waiting on us to get out of the way right and what a time that God has given to you and I in this hour I tell you you hear the prophet make these statements this is bride time that's right it's declaring that the word of God that has come in this hour it's come to lead us into full adoption that's the that's the that's the product of this word to bring forth Sons and Daughters of God a complete Union with God Amen and so when we think of that in this moment that hey we're living in a time that at any moment wow any moment you can look and see your loved ones appear we we're we're just we're that close we're living in that hour and God is working in everything and bringing it all together you know as I was just thinking of that when we think of that thought of bride time and just coming into this this service you know here tonight I just thinking of the word expectation and you know we always get what we expect and you know it's things that every one of us have gathered here there are needs that we have there are needs that maybe you have personally needs that maybe you're praying about for another loved one or someone God knows and I I think tonight as brother BR says if we can approach it fearfully and reverently and that means Lord if there's anything anything that I've said are done any unconfessed sin settle it right now settle it that the spirit of God can just move right down and meet and minister to every need this meeting I want you to think of this every one of us are here we may not be the same gathering on Sunday but I want you to think of it in this way make this meeting your meeting make this meeting your meeting don't let it just don't let it pass you by but God I've got needs there is an expectation that I have and I've come to draw from elhi tonight amen I believe that God has set aside a gift and it's not it's not brother Wendell but the gift lays there God knows he'll prepare a man experiences and all the way down through and things that God will show that man and even the the perspective and the angle God prepares it for just a moment and you know God does it in that way because God just doesn't give it all to just one man he could do that but God wants to show and continue to declare that he's God so God works through a many faceted body a five-fold Ministry and God comes and he brings his word and the prophet said when you've got a craving in your heart and there's something you begin to pray about he said you watch God will send a man to the pulpit that will begin to minister to The Desires in your heart and that's the moment at that time to reach up and say Lord I take it and to accept what God has for us here tonight you don't have to you don't have to barter with God he's already taken care of whatever your need is tonight he's already paid for he's already paid for it's just us to accept what he's already done and I believe that tonight I'll tell you the prophet told us to ask for big things I'm asking for big things I've been asking for big things praying for these meetings how many are asking for big things I'm asking for God to meet every single need I'm asking for God to fill every life with the Holy Ghost and Grant a refilling of his Spirit I'm asking God to heal every every disease every sickness amen amen and you know what if he does everything and does meets every single need it will not not diminish him one ioda he's still the same almighty God you believe that tonight abely amen I'm so thankful to have brother wendle and sister fresa here with us that they would make the trip from Oklahoma and Oklahoma is a part of the United States it's in the middle but we really appreciate brother wend and sister Fresca and some of you it might be the first first time you have an opportunity to hear Brother Wendell but we just want to hear God Amen we want to hear from the Lord tonight and we just appreciate brother wendle love his ministry love the love brother wendle and of course you brother Josh was here with us and this his youngest son and brother Josh did a wonderful job when he came here and ministered amen of people who know their God amen amen amen so we just want to just want to turn it over here to brother Wendell and and I've told him I said you know you're you're at home we're simple people we love the word of God we love the message of the hour just preach sing before sing after just sing preach sing amen so we we appreciate brother wend also brother Jonathan and brother sha I know brother Sean's not able to be here but I think he's got a couple others that'll help him carry it tonight but um God bless you isn't it good to be a Christian amen it's good to serve the Lord Brother wendle come on Amen as brother Wendell's coming we want to remind you tomorrow it'll be the luncheon uh the directions or the address is there on the board in each of the restrooms but everyone's invited there that lunch in at mil Hollow and um I tell you we've been praying for the weather Yen let's not let's not stop but I'll tell you what I sure appreciated that rain this morning I enjoyed that but I'm grateful that the Lord just moved it ahead so we could have this time aren't you he don't have to do that but he just does it to show he's God amen amen amen we'll let you be seated pise the Lord you can go ahead and be seated I think brother Brian's had you shake one another's hands already it wouldn't be bad to do it again but well praise the Lord amen amen how many's glad you're a Christian [Applause] amen amen well if you're not a Christian you can be one that's right come to the right place that's right yes sir and uh get this strap on here praise the lord well what a delight to be here with you all here in in Ohio and uh I I have so loved brother Hallelujah waking waking the rest of you up we

and uh so we're we're thankful for that and and um you know um about the way we sing in Oklahoma just hold our nose and sing that's that's that's good southern gospel amen and uh amen so I want wonder I don't even know if we've ever done a trio together but I wonder if brother Jonathan and brother Josh that's all right would want to help me sing and uh because I do need the help and uh uh we we

congregation but Lord I believe that all things Lord nothing happens by accident and I believe this meeting has been ordained of you and I'm asking God that you will come this weekend and that you will break yolks that you will will encourage hearts that the anointing of the Holy Spirit would be here in a in a such a wonderful way bless our pastor and his family those laboring together with him Lord bless all of the the deacons and the trustees musicians and just everyone Lord be welcome here this weekend father we'll give you glory and honor Hallelujah help us as we open your word and just ask that you would speak to us now in Jesus name can the church say amen amen I'd like to read in two places I'd like to look here in Mark the 17th chapter and the 20 or the the 11th chapter and the 22nd verse and um I uh this is a very familiar passage of scripture and then I'd also like to read in another very familiar passage and that is in Romans the 8th chapter and um we bring our greetings and love from our congregation there in in Pony Oklahoma and um uh there were several that wish they could have came and been a part but um we bring our greetings from them there remark 11 and 20 uh 22 and Jesus answering Sith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you to you what so what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them can somebody say Amen to the word I'd also like to read here in the Book of Romans the 8th chapter amen and um we're going to start about the 11th verse PR the Lord amen amen and um and when you're there you can say amen amen all right it says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are not debtors we are matters not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children than heirs HS of God join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him we shall also be glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God can I hear an amen let's bow our heads once again father we want to thank you again for the reading of your word we're just asking Lord that you would just anoint it to our hearts in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you can be seated here tonight I want to minister this evening on a simple thought amen positioned to Reign position to rain now if we're going to do any kind of reigning God god reigns by faith God does not Reign by force he does not act he is he is the creator amen he is he is God that's right amen and when it says have faith in God if you were to look there in your margin on the side it says have the faith of God so we're going to speak tonight on that Faith because amen the scripture says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that are not seen but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek Him amen and so coming under the Authority or coming under the headship of the word be requires a surrendered heart and a faith that says I believe the word I'm not going by emotions I'm not going off of what amen a a certain this or a certain feeling here or a good service there or an anointed preacher here I have got one thing that I'm interested in I've got one thing that I must come to to grips with and that God never lies I can put my faith and my confidence in that amen everything else gifts will fail men will fail amen everything else will fail but God's word cannot fail there's no failing to it can you say amen and only faith can meet the challenge of the day amen faith is the only thing that can meet the challenge when the powers of Darkness are there to challenge your faith we need something that'll anchor us and that'll put us in that Bedrock solid position that God has ordained for his bride in this last day I say what an incredible day we live in amen we' you know we've seen the virus and the amen the economy tanking and we got a former president that you know they there you know he's in you know he he's he's uh uh you know in court and we've got uh uh you know we've got a president that we've got now wondering you know we we just amen we just there's just a lot of things to wonder about in life amen a lot of things to wonder about amen and and and you're wondering how am I going to raise a family how am I going to amen and the sad thing is is I found it lots of times in our in in the church I found a lot of of of of uh fear and and what if and and I don't know what I'm going to do and I don't know where we're going to do and amen and and and we we we we look at these things as if God can't take care of our battles and that God doesn't know that's going on I want to tell you God seen it before the world was ever created God seen God seen Trump God seen amen Biden God seen the virus God seen your economy God knows what job you're you're at God knows how to raise your family God knows how to Rapture you God knows how to bring you what can you say Amen but it's going to require a faith a confidence in God saying that God never fails he can somebody saying God cannot fail man it's a Beggar's mentality

this boy could not the disciples had power Jesus gave them power to heal all manner of sickness and to cast out devils and to cleanse the lepers and raise the dead he gave them power but they didn't have the faith to operate the power they had and when they questioned Jesus and said well now why couldn't we do it now remember they had the word the word was flesh then and the word told them I give you power can you say amen amen then he stops he says amen I give you power and they had the power but they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was in them see what I mean Jesus had it he was the word and he had the faith and that's what he said would happen he said oh bring him here how long will I suffer you he had the Faith with his power how did he he says I can do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word he had the faith in God who made him the word he was God Amen and and they he says they was in him and that give him Faith because he understood his position he knew what he was because the scriptures said that's what he was and here every scripture tied in to prove he was exactly what the scriptures said he would

he would say her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him there is no fault in her for she is his creation I I'm saying you're not going to rain as long as the devil's got you under his thumb what is his thumb condemnation [Applause] so good we're not living under the ministry of condemnation we're living under the ministry of the freedom of Liberty he whom the son sets free is free indeed can you say Amen I'm not under the thumb of condemnation anymore I have surrendered who I am to the word if you don't want to be condemned with the world you've got to come under the headship of the world well this preacher believes it that way I don't care what he believes well this preacher's teaching it that I don't care what he's teaching I've came under the headship of this [Applause] word yes sir and when you come under that headship you become a reflection of the invisible amen come on Hall and when you're out

going to worry about your position on your job anymore you're going to take your position in the body of Christ [Applause] hallu Hallelujah brother R would say from the beginning I'm just going to read just a portion of that church age it's an Ephesian Church age book he says from the beginning to the end she is the work of the Lord hallelujah all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed

spoken [Applause] it [Applause] glory in me is the purpose in me it's the wisom in me it's ready to flow out it's ready to be made manifest it's ready to display the power of that unlimited God here on the [Applause] earth why because you're not identifying yourself with your mama your daddy your preacher A Gifted Man A Gifted woman you are identifying yourself with the word does it matter you bet you yeah Isaac could not come until Abram got rid of the confession of childless Abram right fatherless childless no children on yeah hi my name is childless my name is Abram what does that mean uh childless look that's what it means it means childless child childless you can't I'm waiting on a promise God said it right he separated me out amen I've already went through the stages Prophet says he went through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost was all tied in right there but he says but it required Prophet God coming down in the body of MDC and God coming down in the word changing his [Music] name and he didn't say okay your name is Abram so I'm going to give you Joe or I'm going to give you George that's good yes sir I want to give you a [Laughter] window you w you ain't going to believe this Hallelujah I've got a grandson amen that that Caleb my my middle boy just just named their their their their youngest son after me now they didn't give it the first name they it's hid in the middle but but I'm in there Ezekiel wend Martin but God didn't come to Abraham and say I'm going to give you wend come on he said I'm going to give you a part of my name that's right I'm Elohim I'm going to call you Abraham yes yes sir you're still human you're still human look at the Sands of the sea there's going to be a lot of human ferales that going but I also want you to look up you're also you've also got a destiny in the skies and the Stars count the Sands of the sea so shall it be with your Earthly seed but I want you to look there's a predestinated seed up in those skies and just as your natural seed is going to rain on the earth there is a spiritual [Applause] SE can you say amen he didn't give him Billy Bob George wendle and Sam he gave him a part of his name Elohim amen and when God came down in this generation he did not give us another Theologian he did not give us a new song he did not give us a new a new church he did not give us a new this that he gave us a part of himself in the beginning was the word words with God Word was God the word was made flesh I'm going to give you what I am I'm going to give you me I'm going to send a prophet with thus sayeth the Lord that will identify you with Devils that'll identify you to the church world that'll identify you here on the earth hall hallelujah hallelujah Jus can you say Amen I'm going to position you to rainall brother brenon would say knowing who he was without a shadow of a doubt he knew he was the son of God he knew it for the word identified the word of God identified who he was he said if I do not the works of my father then believe me don't believe me but if I don't do them don't believe me but if I do them then believe the works for they are the manifested word promise and if you punch your neighbor real quick not too hard they might punch back if you could just wake up to that a minute you see the word itself identified him who he was he said you can who can condemn me of sin in other words who can show me that my life and my Works don't fulfill exactly the what the Messiah should do nobody could say nothing for he was then he had Faith to believe of whatever he said it would happen but then he turned around and said the works that I do shall you do also a little while in the world sees me no more yet you shall see me because I'll be with you even in you take no thought of what you shall say for it's not you that speaketh it's the father that dwelleth in you he's the one that does the speaking it's not me it's the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works see what I mean now the identification of a scripture Christian these words said Jesus these signs shall follow them that believe now you can call yourself a Believer a people and deny those words how can you call yourself a Believer and deny any of this word you can't do it you're not a Believer therefore the signs can't follow but because you are you just said uh you just accept what you want to believe and then let out the rest you don't believe it but you got to take the whole thing and believe it and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs shall follow them that believe hallu oh could you compare a Christian today with them Christians long ago that them disciples walk in the power of the spirit moved by the Holy Ghost amen just a a prisoner as I preached the other night a prisoner to the word and with the will of God he couldn't even move until God told him wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that and then he stops wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that and then he stops and he says I wish it could happen sir wouldn't you like to see a church like that it's going to it's going back it's got to come that's your shout that's your time to shout [Music] hallelujah now I'm I don't know how long I've been up here can I can I have some more time this a Friday night yes sir and he says that I can just yes sir you're at home act like I'm at home some of those folks from home they're going that's the wrong thing to say amen that's right what was the first law of God faith that first law that first law God believe God seen God spoke it was settled can you say Amen am amen the scripture the prophet would tell us and who is God Amen how did he make it from he said I don't know there was nothing to make it from but he believed his own word and there was light right right amen and when you start believing your own word well glory to God the genetics of God are am am I going around in circles too much or am I doing okay here the genetics of God are on the inside of you and I want you to understand that when you you've got the genetics I don't I don't care amen every predestinated seed has got the genetics the problem today is is the church or the message circles have taken away the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we've been dealing with that in the church is back at at the church and he deals that amen with that in that second Church age he says we've got some that is in the fanaticism and they're putting it all on the gifts he says that could be or could not be the Holy Ghost we it's Satan can manifest he says but then others have put it all on experience and how many times have I heard message preachers preach against experience but go back and read it when brother Bram when he says away with EXP experience he's not even getting on to the Pentecostals he goes he says you won't go on from believing unto the Holy Ghost to receiving the Holy Ghost that's the full quote come on that's right these guys is preaching against experience as if it's a bunch of fanaticism that's not what brother Brandon was coming against that's right that's right he said we got too many former folks in here says I just believe and brother brandham dealt pages on that scripture after scripture after scripture after scripture on that so what we have today is a lot of seeds laying in a lot of wounds on that need some igniting and I want to tell you this evening yes sir if there's some people in here that don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost on I want to tell you the baptism of the Holy Ghost is here for you tonight you can receive you say oh brother W I believe I listen we got to get past amen justification we got well I believe I have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed the reason why the word isn't working in a lot of people because they ain't got the Holy Ghost that doesn't say the word's not in you you're elected you're predestinated but you need to get yourself into an upper room and get filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that you can get ignited by the word of God so that the power of the Holy Spirit can flow through [Applause] you hallu it's in the church age book if youall Hallelujah do we believe in the church age book around here sir yes sir you're ordained you're predestinated can I just put it can I just Hallelujah I'm really going to get myself in trouble here you're not even the whatsoever or whosoever whosoever means there's going to be a lot of whosoever's in heaven oh come on there's going to be the foolish virgin

good to me I believe that there's going to be a lot of people over there giving eternal life because they've been good to me can you say Amen but the fact is the gene of God is not in them I you say well how is that I I I'm not I don't know all I can say is brother Brandon I just believe what the prophet said sir but there's an eternal Gene seed in the elect of God and Devil can't take that out

that's right yes sir and if you're an offspring of him and he is in you whatever he is hallelujah some of you need to just hold your invisible cup up and let the devil know that you know if God is in me and he tormented you there is no man there's no telling what's fixing to happen to you big baboon I am taking authority over [Applause] you and when God sees you start acting like that it's just like a big old drink of Pentecostal water [Applause] you're an offspring of him God is in you he'll believe his own word though it can't be seen felt taste or anything he'll believe it see what I mean for God in you somebody say God in Me God in will believe his own word his own word did I get it God is me the cup can't do [Laughter] nothing the Cup by itself right Hallelujah won't you get you a drink Hallelujah that's about a lot of that's about like a bunch of preachers sometimes offering something that had they don't nothing about but now if I were to offer you a drink the proof is in the cup Hallelujah all right I'm enjoying myself all right now God in you will believe his own word you're under his authority you're under his headship he has brought this these Seven Ages up to this point to get a people who will reflect who he is Hallelujah well glory to God isn't that just wonderful there is an authority hallu coming under that Authority brother Brandon would ask he man he says now I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed we talk about the word we debate it can you say Amen but he but he goes on and he says but the printed word he says the word that he's left behind on the printed page is a part of him and when you accept it by faith into a spirit filled life he goes on down and says there it is he is Spirit he is life that's exactly what the word is that's exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man can I hear a great big amen pretty plain and simple now as I close the word what did what did God what what when when brother when God was trying to show brother brandham what his message was and he was having a hard time understanding what what was the vision meant the opening of the seals and he and he was trying what am I dying and what what's what's going on and and he went out there the sunset Mountain remember he had his hands up and then a sword appeared and he scared of swords and he says it's just as real and literal as can be he begins to describe it right and and and he's wandering oh my Sharp he's scared of it and and and and then and and and he and and then something says he thought well U maybe I'm maybe my Ministry I've got to KN some people and not you know and get anoint preachers and and and and then but then all of a sudden there came something that just rung out this is the king sword he's going a king and then then it came back the king sword remember that and as he and as he's looking then all of a sudden he said now this wasn't this wasn't this wasn't audible but this was down in his heart this is the third pool Hallelujah right what was he doing he was handing the people that is so good yes sir is your sword I couldn't give this I couldn't get the to the children I couldn't get I I couldn't do that to to to Luther or to Wesley or to 1906 or yes sir amen giv it to you praise the Lord sir go put a hurting on the devil hallelujah hallelujah defeat your enemy yes sir amen amen now the Bible says that one day when Saul was reigning in the Kingdom he had so back slid y'all still with me stay stay with me just another another five minutes yes sir

swords the Philistines had taken every sword every spear they had taken everything away from Israel right Saul had a sword but Saul was scared to use it and then you read the SC you read the story how that they were the Philistines there the Bible says there was not even a black Smith found in all of Israel if they needed anything sharpened or anything made they had to go to the enemy and you think the enemy is going to give them anything sharp the enemy is going to keep them beat down and the Bible says they were all gathered together boy saw that the Philistines were down there and the saw was scared and they he you know and he didn't know amen and he's calling them all all retreating to come back men are they they didn't have they didn't have nothing to come on they were picking up little rocks like little kids against the Philistines right but when he called for him all retreating hul go back he looked down there and he saw Jonathan and his armor bear and if you read the story Jonathan looked to his armor bear and says I see those Philistines over there he says I think we can take them armor Bearer says well all I've got is your sword I ain't got I'm with you jonan he says but I trust you if you think you can whoop him I'll be right there with you the Bible says that they crawled over there they got into the enemy's camp and they were who that's a southern whing they were whopping those demons Philistines they were flying every which time ding ding ding and Saul looks down there and he's trying to find the two missing Fellers and he says what on Earth is happening down there with the Philistines so good they looked around and they said say well Jonathan and his armor bear is missing sir and as they watched were they not Hebrews were they not the elect did they not have the promise that thou shall possess the gates of your enemies come on are you hearing me amen God didn't take away our swords God brought us in an in this layot ofan age where there was a lot of whole lot of tongue talking a whole lot of and I hey I'm I'm going to tell you right now I am a tongue talker I speak in tongues but that didn't do much me much good until I got a sword that's

word in this hour to break away all the veils of tradition everything that we thought about ourselves everything that we knew it had to be a voice that would come From Another World a voice of a seminary could never do it man's thinking couldn't do it there's nothing that can bring the liberating power like the voice of almighty God Amen and you know what that voice called him to do think about it that little Eagle he was an eagle the whole time but he had been trying to act like a chicken that's what he had been told to do but the prophet Ali says it's so simple he said when that that eagle he said he he never never never never forgot about him he said that eagle begin to Circle that barnyard maybe he took and preached 10 parts and just kept on circling kept on circling because down there is an eagle and God in this generation God has circled over this generation you know what the thing that eagle had to do just like for you and I had to look up and there was something that caught its attention and that's why brother BR said in the rising of the sun he said just to talk about eagles or a picture of an eagle was not good enough it took the eagle himself to come flying
