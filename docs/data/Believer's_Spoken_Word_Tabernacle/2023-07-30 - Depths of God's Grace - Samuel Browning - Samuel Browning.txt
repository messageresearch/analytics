oh God I pray Lord fill with the Holy Ghost oh God may you take control this morning Lord we pray we invite you almighty God by Lord your great presence O Lord that you would come Lord in a special way Lord we give ourselves to you father in Jesus name amen and amen amen thank you musicians amen God bless you thank you let's turn to Jack Zechariah Chapter 4. and I just want to begin just to draw from there just a few moments and I just have just a I want to read down through verse 10. if we could this setting is where Israel has returned back from captivity where they were carried away to Babylon and we know that that was because of disobedience and I want you to think of this just for a moment they were disobedient after God had provided everything that they had needed God he let him know all that you all that is required is to serve me Faithfully and then little by little by little it come into a place of full Disobedience and Disobedience isn't something that starts with big things it starts with little things and then it just keeps on compiling but this is what I want you to see is God didn't write them off God let them know before they ever left the land and even matter of fact before they ever set foot in the land in the book of Deuteronomy God already let him know this was going to take place God already told him in the book of Deuteronomy you're going to set a king over yourselves why God knows the ways of man God knows us and let me just say it like this God has never and never will ever put stock in our Humanity God's confidence is solely in his word but God said I will make a way back and I will bring you back into the land and even in this moment they've come back into the land I'm not preaching yet but they've come back into the land in 15 years have went by where they became occupied they became focused on other things of life I look at that and I think my God could just say you didn't learn the lesson the first time you're back in the same same mode that you were before but he didn't God made a way now it wasn't God overlooked it remember what God did God has a way of dealing with it God wants you and I to say the same thing that he says to where when he sent his word they then recognized oh I've got away from the main purpose what was that the grace of God and then this is where this comes in in Zechariah 4 very fitting of the hour that you and I are living in and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that has awakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what say is what sea is thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are up on the top thereof and two olive trees by it one up on the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts and what is seen a vision of is this working here of the Candlestick which was already given by God when Moses gave the pattern for the Tabernacle but that same of the seven candlesticks would also be the type of God bringing a people out of Babylon and talking about you and I Babylon is confusion where we don't where your person doesn't know where they're standing doesn't know what to believe in God has called us out of Babylon and what the other ages did not know and did not see they were waiting on the coming of the Lord but you and I where we are standing in this moment is God letting us know those ages they have already come and we're standing at the end we are standing at the end so this is the parallel of where we have come to in this hour not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou o great Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a plane anybody ever seen had obstacles in your life maybe you still have obstacles let me just read the promise who art thou great Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a plane who is this Ruble a type of Christ Thou shalt become a plane who who is where is Christ Christ is in his body is that right it's Christ anointing you and I to believe his word Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole Earth amen if God would help me this morning just a just a little thought that God is so inspired upon my heart and I want to speak on the depth of God's grace amen may God bless you as you're being seated this morning God all night just as I am just pondering and just looking as the Holy Spirit just just seems to just grab my heart upon this and then throughout the time and the weekend and you know brother Jerry when he stood here last week and he spoke on stories of God's grace and there's really two parts that I want to bring out of this and not necessarily maybe two services but just to try to drop this in here this morning in that of how the grace itself stands for us and how that Grace holds us and when we look at the real truth uh there is a real truth to Divine Grace um Grace that we can see today that would well if we could look at it that would no doubt be the very favorite topic we even see churches that are named in those ways Grace Church and Grace and I have nothing against the church being named that way but I believe there's a true Grace of almighty God and I believe that Grace has been laid out I I don't believe the grace of God comes uh to us in a manner just that without an effect and a reality that takes place on our life you know brother Branham himself when he was many times criticized and he he spoke of this of how that he was so criticized on the message of Divine Healing and he said yet he says I'm also very much criticized on another thing and that's for preaching Grace so when we think of that of the grace of God I I want you to understand that it's not just when we look at it with God's grace it's not like Joe remember when Jude starting out in the early church Jude was standing there and there was a call in that hour for the children of God to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the church and that that that faith that was delivered to the saints that Faith was God's own life the Holy Ghost so it was something that is something worth fighting for there's a lot of things that we can fight for draw lines for and everything else but always make sure what you're fighting for it's worth fighting for and there are some things that are not worth fighting for but there are other things that are worth fighting for I'm gonna just say it like this the things that are of Eternal value those are the things that are worth fighting for is that right it's not worth fighting you know to maintain your bitterness and your hold and and your position it's it's not worth it but it is worth fighting for Liberty it is worth it giving ourselves for the cause of Jesus Christ it is worth standing for this gospel that it might be proclaimed through our lives so I want to just say it's not like that of how that Jude when he said there were certain men who crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God in our Lord Jesus Christ so taking God's grace because Grace itself there is the real truth of uh real Divine truth of God's grace but these men crept in they were ungodly men to take a very precious truth and promise that God has given his church and would turn it into a play into something that would be so uh despised so defiled of where that would Proclaim Grace and we see that even now in this hour of you know things and misstatements that are made and you know God doesn't care and God loves you anyhow and you know my heart bleeds for that part of it because the reality is He does care God's not a hapless hopeless sloppy God he cares he cared enough to come and fulfill his word to the letter he didn't cut a corner even in the time where he was brought to a place of crucifixion he stayed with the word in order that Liberty might come to you and I Grace comes according to the truth of almighty God and I'm just saying in this way I don't really believe that the grace of God is something our natural mind can fully comprehend we undoubtedly every one of us have received Grace favor from someone for some reason maybe you've had it from a boss for something and you know giving you a time off you didn't even ask for maybe you've had it someone come and paid for your meal and you didn't ask for anybody to pay for your meal you've asked maybe there's been groceries that's been provided for you a bill that's been paid a repair of some sort in other words there is something that has taken place that there is nothing that you have done to require that or would Merit that but it was done for you you know you can try to argue with somebody and say no you don't have to do this you don't have to do that but when you're in a real situation of a real need you're just thankful that that bill has been paid you're just thankful that somebody paid gave you some groceries you see there's an element that of of Grace in that regard but you know yet the grace of God which is so much deeper is unfathomable to our human mind our finite mind it takes the spirit of God to reveal his grace for us and I believe with all my heart when we come back to the scripture where it says that he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shouting's crying Grace Grace unto it it speaks of a body that has come to completion but remember in order for The Headstone to come there had to come a Ministry that would also take us back down to the true foundation because in order to have victory in our life we've got to have a true foundation and that's what the grace does for you and I it reveals and brings us into the right foundation and that our life might be established in the grace of almighty God and so I believe this with all my heart that we are under the promised shout of Grace that has come in the shoutings of divine grace you know the Bible said in the time of the Rapture which were in that season that the Lord himself first Thessalonians 4 shall descend from heaven with the shout and the and the voice and and the Trump and we know we are in that promise of the shout of divine grace of God and then let me just say it when this scripture reads it says it is with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto him because within this shout there are shoutings of Grace it is the book of redemption that which has been taken and now it is God's thundering out it is God issuing out shoutings of Grace to where when we when I can look in the word and though we can see the wrong but yet there is Grace that is poured out Upon Our Lives for what to come and change to bring Liberty to bring Deliverance to our lives and the shoutings are God's grace to vindicate his word that you and I might believe and have faith in the Living God I tell you like this brother random would say it in the message of Grace he would say it like this he said we've got theologians today we've got doctors of divinity we've got great men all over the world that's smart intelligent and educated but it takes the simplicity of believing God to make his word speak out to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it takes the Simplicity of believing God notice it says it takes a humble heart dedicated to God bring Jesus Christ in in unto present tense oh amen he says if it taken theology what would the Presbyterian or the Methodist or the Baptist or the Catholic and so forth we wouldn't have a chance us poor unlearned people but it doesn't take knowledge laughs I'll have just I was just sitting and I was just talking with um with a brother you know and um we were fellowshipping and uh you know and uh it's actually brother John Sanger and we sitting there and and you know the statement was made of how he said look how God would take you know that I didn't even have a seventh grade education and God would take that vessel and God would manifest himself through that vessel there are things that are spoken that science is just coming to understand there are things that are spoken that's not the intelligence and Mind of a man it can't be anything else then almighty God the Messiah made manifest right Among Us the Living God veiled once again in his people [Music] about that not having that what what chance would you have or I have if if it was a learned person you say brother Sammy you got a master's degree but I've sat in the room with people and I could get in there and though I might have a degree sometimes they're throwing around words I ain't never heard in my life it can literally intimidate you I've been there and I was saying and the only thing I can do is just pick up on how they're trying to use them and then I try to understand that must be what that means right are you hearing me it's not about how much how smart we are how intelligent we are it's about can you believe God's word can we humble ourselves to the word of God it doesn't take knowledge over the same I don't know that it don't take knowledge not by power or by might but by my spirit saith God Al unfold this mystery and he will cry to it who's it you and me Grace Grace with shoutings and cryings that's what the preaching of the word is that's what this message is crying out it's shoutings of Grace this message is not shoutings of condemnation it's shoutings of Grace are you hearing me now if you reject it it will be condemnation to you if you refuse to walk in it it will be condemnation to you but right now while there's blood on The Mercy Seat it is shoutings of Grace it is crying Grace forward glory be to God that's what it is today God's Amazing Grace to his people how he takes the illiterate the unlearned and shows that Jesus is the same when he came he never came to the great theologians neither did he go to Canvas as the high priest or they only condemned him but he took fishermen men who were poor and walked the common life and to there he revealed himself and said follow me I'll make you Fishers of Men to show that his grace still reached down even to the Jews to the Gentiles to call a people for his name in this last days as we've been through it Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound now I want to say to you Grace stands for you when the fall in the beginning think of it now God had laid down for that first family that first couple there in the garden and he had told him you have to eat of this and not to eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil for the day you eat thereof that day you shall die that was God's word and then we find that through deceit and subtility where Satan used a vessel and use the tool how that Eve she consented the woman consented through deception she comes back and Adam Adam himself not deceived but Adam the Bible said was in the transgression what was it that moved for Eve at that time it was Adam's love for her in the midst of her wrong in the midst of her failure it was Adam's love for her let me tell you that was a great portrayal of what was going what was going to take place what was in God's mind where you and I would stand in a place of wrong wrong as wrong could be but there is one who would stand on our behalf oh brother our life had wrinkles all over it sin stains and everything else we needed help okay we needed a savior we needed a redeemer we needed a Waymaker we needed one to come and help you and I and God came down in Genesis 3 14 and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thou shalt eat dust all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and in verse 21 and up to Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them that's why brother Branham could say grace is old Grace is as old as the world is yeah Hallelujah this Earth that we are setting on did not choose itself to be inhabited but God chose this Earth out of every other planetary planetary body that is out there and let me just tell you something his choosing did not all of a sudden make it a place that was habitable that was already reserved in the mind of God his presence unfolded the Earth to a place to where it would be happening inhabited by almighty God what is it that makes you an a habitable being it is not our works it's not our doings it's the Sovereign Grace of God brooding over our lives as the prophet could say it's not you receiving the Holy Ghost it's the faith of God coming in you and God receiving himself into his Temple God receiving himself Grace was first shown to the human race there on a dark morning Grace stepped in and provided a substitute death was required God had every right just step down at that moment and wipe them off the face of the Earth because they disobeyed his word but God's grace held God's grace didn't allow him to remain it's true that they they suffered me from uh because of that sickness centered in fear energy and all the other things entered in because of sin but God said I will make a way back and God took the skins of an innocent one a lamb and he gave that to them to cover their nakedness their guilt would be covered by the innocency of an innocent one what was God showing you and I that day was going to come through and by the real Lamb of God the True Entertainment the Lord Jesus Christ the innocent one that he would give his innocent life that that life inside of there might come back upon you and I and bring forth in our life innocency innocency how would it bring forth innocency because he comes to change our nature to where I desire to do only those things that please you Lord Isaiah 53 10. yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquity I see my name there not only is he my sin offering he's also the one that carried it away [Applause] therefore I will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall Devour the spoil with the strong Humanity dividing that with what has been conquered now what has been brought forth by Mighty conqueror him dividing his life Out Among his children because he hath poured out his soul unto death we speak of and it's true the new birth is a dying process he made a way that we could die to ourselves he made a way he made a way and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors you say brother Samuel what did he see what did he see when he said in verse 10 he shall see his seed and he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand what did he see he saw me he saw you he saw your Liberty he saw your healing he saw your joy he saw your deliverance he saw it all through this one all-sufficient sacrifice Hallelujah you realize that that's what's even breaking forth and breaks forth upon our life that's what this message come to do this message come to clear away all the channels and thoughts and ideas of man that puts it as though that it's something of man's efforts and if I can only get to this but what does it do it removes all of the visions of man and it puts forth and opens up the Clear Vision into the holiest of holies that's what this Revelation does to where you can see your way back into a place a full relationship to God let me tell you the song where it says it shall be light in the evening time the path of Glory you shall surely find in the Waterway God's light today buried in the precious name of Jesus Christ young and old repent of all your sins and shall surely enter in I'm telling you the path of Glory has come to you and I we couldn't find a way but God came to you and I am what am I talking about the path of Glory it's what this evening lied he wanted a path to become part of a church or put your name on a book A book didn't die for you a church didn't die for you but God himself came down and paid the price that he might release his life back into you and I that's the real grace of God let's look how Paul writes it in Romans 5 6 for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for Samuel [Music] be ungodly over the same I went through a message Church all my life let me read that again in due time Christ died for it be ungodly [Applause] oh yeah for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet pure adventure for a good man someone even Dare To Die but God commendeth his love toward us in that way while we were yet somebody say it Christ died for us Worthy Worthy no no ungodly we were Sinners we were in no shape but he died for us yeah but what was the whole work about is he knew what laid beneath there he was making a way Grace was making a way that we could come forth in Victory because the ungodliness and all the sin and the attributes of sin is not who you were it's not who I was and Grace is making a way for you and I oh glory be to God verse 9 much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be safe from wrath through him for if when we were enemies woo we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life you mean he ain't he didn't just die for me when I heard about it no as a matter of fact before the foundation of the world the Bible said the lamb was slain Hallelujah job there was a witness there when the Morning Star shouted for joy and and what were those morning Stars shouting about they were shouting about as the prophet tells us they were catching a glimpse of their salvation in the lamb when God would become flesh so the word itself is calling out shoutings of Grace so if the Believers receive those shoutings and become part of it then we become part of the shout and our life their shoutings of grace and mercy it's crying out Grace for our loved ones Grace for everyone you don't have to live in that same condition you don't have to be up and down and up and down there is Grace to live above that [Applause] and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there's no law it'd be like example going up and down this road right here there's no speed limit signs and you're new to the area I know that excuse won't work but if there's no signs posted what do you do well I guess it's residential I guess you only go this fast and you go you don't know there's nothing can be imposed if there's no law but when there's a law a law is there to be imposed and the law itself sin was not imputed when there was no law but when the law had come in it shows sin nevertheless death ring from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come so there were those down through there could say I didn't do what Adam did right right I mean even the Pharisees said we've been out born in fornication right but there was still under that representation but not as the offense so also as the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift by Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many I'm glad it said many aren't you because my name's in many I'm one of those Minis men not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification for If by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive somebody say receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life for as by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered now here it is that the offense might abound in other words as the law comes in the only thing the law can say is guilty it only spells out guilty but where sin abounded Grace did much more abound that as Sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace Reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord and the church said brother Graham said if it hadn't been for Grace where would we all be Sovereign Grace I want you to listen to this Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign One Sovereign Grace from a sovereign One Sovereign what can it do Sovereign can do what it wants to Sovereign Grace can only be given by one that's Sovereign and God is Sovereign so he can give Sovereign Grace therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask nobody you don't have to it does what it wants to you don't have to ask can I do this or shall I do that can I must I will I doesn't do it it doesn't it does it itself I'm glad about that because if something if I would have been December had been some Askins about me some people would have said ain't no chance for that boy what do you mean ain't no chance wrong well you see you don't know that that boy tried to serve God he started out when he was 10 years old but he couldn't stay with him he was at a youth camp at 13 years old on an altar but he couldn't stay with it but what was it Grace was standing for me the whole entire time and I'm telling you right here this morning whether you realize it or not Grace has been standing for you the whole entire time through your ears outs ups and downs and through everything about it all right when you even have made up in your mind to accept the doubt that the enemy was trying to permeate your life with this must not be for me but you can't override the grace that's standing for you as a child of almighty God grace is standing not what you deserve not what I deserve but God provided His Amazing Grace Adam and Eve deserve to be wrote off they walked right over top of God's word but Grace stood God wanted to make sure we'd see the grace in this hour so he came from where he had been interceding and he's taken the book and what we're seeing is a lamb who's standing we're seeing a triumphant one he was seated in power and glory and now he's standing you know what it is he's in view of his children it's not a man's idea it's like when they were stoning Stephen and Stephen said he said I've looked up and I behold the son of man standing on the right hand what was it a standing the standing position was it's time to come home it's time to welcome home it was standing in the midst of that time of trouble in the midst of when the Rocks were getting ready to fly but there was one who was standing I'm telling you the Bible said Michael shall stand up for his people the lamb is standing for you and I in this hour what does that mean it's Christ in view in your life to where all you can see is Jesus Christ and if you can't see it from one another correctly then you're not seeing it for the depth that God wants you to see it for your own life because when you see it for your own life in the depth you need to see it it not only affects you change you delivers you feels you but it also it puts Grace in your heart for one another is that right I said God let me see that lamb standing [Applause] let me see that lamb standing Lord let me see it more and more just say how do I see it through the preaching of the word amen is the message of the hour it's ringing forth we are beholding a mighty conqueror a Victorious Swan a mighty God who is standing there who has wrecked the veil into [Applause] um Grace is Sovereign therefore he can save the vilest he can save the worst thank you Jesus he can save the impurist he can save the immoralist he can I don't know if that's a word but he can heal the sickest he can save a Wretch like Me he did what is it Grace William Branham a drunkard son that don't make any difference the grace of God save me me I'm a woman's daughter that was no good don't make any difference the grace of God saved you it's Sovereign has to ask nobody nothing right amen wondered Jesus would have talked to disciples about the woman who was coming to the well The Sovereign don't have to ask nobody nothing [Music] [Applause] oh preach with me now we can run deep on that but notice it's God's desire to have fellowship with you and I according to his word is that right so now when we talk about this Sovereign can do what he wants to do I want you to understand the Bible says that he have blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us all of the evidence and everything that was against you and I it wasn't that he just tore it up but what he did he became our sacrifice because God wasn't just tearing up papers but God in the Lord Us in order for us to receive Grace there has got to be one that is that was able to stand there and take the justice of God that was due you and I and if we got God's justice we would get help is that right but we were there we were there we we died with him there at Calvary the prophet said he made me pay for my sins there yeah and when he got up on that Easter morning we got up with him [Music] [Applause] he made me pay for my sins so it wasn't just God giving me giving you and me something but there was Justice that had to be met and when there was nobody that could meet that Justice there wasn't a man in heaven or Earth there was no Prophet Sage or anybody that could meet that justice of what was required don't you understand in this hour there was no man that could meet what was needed but the lamb has stepped forward in this hour and says I am their perpetuation I their lamb for their blind eyes I am their way back home [Applause] I am your sacrifice I'm your way to Victory Hallelujah now look at this scripture in Psalms 103 the Bible said bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who heal us all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who promisy with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfied thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles brother Brown said let me say this my sinner friend you may be here this morning a prostitute you might be here this morning a woman Chaser you might be here a drunkard or a gambler or a murderer you might be here as an impure husband or an impure wife you might be the vilest of Sinner and you say I'm past that stage of redemption no you're not or you wouldn't be at the church this morning [Applause] you need to take that and put that right back in the devil's face if there's a quote you want to put on your refrigerator put on your mirror so you stop looking at yourself and look at what the lamb has spoken you wouldn't be here oh I must be past that you never got that thought from God he said come unto me all you better Heaven lady the spirit and the bride say come oh I've done this I overstepped the word here but do you have a desire to serve God if you have a desire listen to me friends it's not condoning sin but you've got to come God's provided way and if you've got a desire it shows you haven't crossed the line okay oh I'm past the stage of redemption no you're not or you wouldn't be at church this morning Grace will make a way for you in this dark hour if you'll just accept it don't wrestle around like sometimes we do when somebody wants to pay our bill at dinner and hoping that they hold out a little longer than we say no you don't have to come on I'm right down your alley but to accept it you don't have to accept me simple word consent accept it Adam had to be willing to accept it and you've got to be willing to accept it let me tell you what it is it's the unmerited favor of God that's what Grace is Ephesians 2 8 4 by grace are ye saved through faith how could you have faith to even believe if God has not come and fulfilling his word and his presence sweeping as you hear the word being preached you know what that's doing that's the grace of God admitting to you and I that we might rise and believe in him that he's mine perpetuation he's my lamb he's my savior He's My Redeemer he's my deliverer that's what that's what it's doing and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast oh Hallelujah his brother Brown said God brought Grace into our lives by his love for us now you know there's something grace can't do there is something that Grace can't do it we're in good thought right now really I know it's changed my life what can it do well here's something grace can't do here's what the prophet told us Grace cannot be bought [Music] Grace can't be sold it's Grace stay with me now it's by a sovereign one you can't bargain for it well I'll be this good you can't bargain for Grace you can say God I'll do so and so if you'll do so and so you can't do that God won't do it you can't pull nothing out of God God gives it to you by his grace so what are you saying quit working and accept it I know sometimes in them that we're trying to work out here but you're trying to work it up here in this little p matter up here you can't work it out up here it's by grace through faith are you safe do you believe that he came and he died for your sins do you believe that he rose again do you believe that he sent back the Holy Ghost and it's a holy ghost that's a nun to me to preach this word and call out Redemption to you this morning it's believe his word oh my God quit working and accept it notice brother random said you're saved by grace God does the calling God does the saving the next part you just follow the footsteps of God that's all God says repent be baptized and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins what are you doing you're following Grace thank you and just in case you don't know if you look in your rear view mirror you'll see mercy and Grace is following after you too [Applause] come on somebody oh you're saved by grace and God by Grace gives you the new eternal life and eternal life is the baptism of the Holy Ghost man would say it like this uh in another place and when they would see Jesus he said when Jesus died at Calvary he saved the whole world every human being ever would be on earth the sin question was settled once and for all when Jesus died but he will never you'll never be a beneficiary of this policy until you accept it there's nothing you can do to Merit it it's an unmerited thing that God has done for you and you just accept it by faith in the Simplicity of faith God has made it so we all could reach it rich or poor illiterate or educated we can all accept it because it's in the reach of all of us just by childlike Simplicity to believe that the finished work at Calvary included me I'm reading shoutings of Grace crimes of Grace no wonder Paul could write in Romans 5 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God do you realize that there's not even a chasm between you and God any longer see God span to you and I we couldn't reach him but God came to where you and I were at and then just say this God came to where I was at God came to where you were at the same if I can only get to this forget save your time you'll never get good enough all of your goodness now listen friends goodness does not mean that you're not yielding but yielding means you're accepting and you're accepting is so much greater than all of your works because when you will yield to the word then the word that's been spoken to energize faith will go to work in your life when you will just simply accept it but my condition what about your condition Grace has already made a way but I've got this right here that I've got to get straightened out what about that Grace itself will make a way to lead you because listen it's your own thinking that's got you in the mess in the first place it's following your own ways and your own doings but let the grace of God that desires to lead you fully let him lead you say Lord I'm tired of going my own way and taking my own way I'm tired of walking according to my own reasonings Lord I want to walk according to the grace of God so there's nothing between a Son of God a daughter of God and God anymore a chasm in that Chasm when that blood has been shed been repented of God and man become Father and Son there's no sin at all and he puts it in the sea of the bleach of forgetfulness and cannot even be remembered no more praise God but here's the problem we're human and we can still remember let me just tell you like this it wouldn't matter if you are the model so-called model message person and the righteous most vilest ungodly person is sitting beside you let me tell you what both of you need the grace of God that's what both of you need God's grace it isn't one needs oh they needed a whole lot more no we all need it because what God's grace come to do is to lead you and I to a death to ourselves to where you and I lose sight of our own selves and our own will and we get our eyes focused on Calvary we get our eyes focused on the lamb we need God's grace in our lives Hallelujah and this as it says in First Peter 5 12 if I can speak of the rest of the latter part of that verse this is the true grace of God wherein you stand you see God's grace hail think of this for the Wilderness I'm coming to my last Point here God's grace held for Israel in the wilderness think of it brother Jerry mentioned it when he was here I think even the first service about complaining their shoes didn't wear out their clothes didn't wear out they had food provided for him come on you you can't get no benefits like that 401K won't even pay you like that you can't get no benefits like that God provided all those things let me tell you something even through all of their complainings they're grumblings God could have easily said let's see where you get your close neck and your next set of clothes see where you get your next set of shoes from but he didn't you understand they didn't have to look far off to see God's grace it was right there right around him do you realize in your life in my life it's not something all brother Samuel oh I need to see something way out there for God's grace it's God's grace that you're here this morning it's God's grace that you've got to desire to serve God it ain't something far out right there it's right up next to you it's the Living God right personal dealing with your life leading you and I putting up with us bringing us along the way through all of our complainings oh I'd love to be able to say after that message that I had no more complaints boy the week that followed that message don't complain no more I think my complaint list went Lord I'm speaking for the rest of these angels in here too you know why you see it's fitting when the word comes forth like that we are going to be tried but I'll tell you one thing I found myself saying forgive me Lord a whole lot sooner for complaining right [Applause] [Laughter] amen but you see God's grace held for him before him even to bring them to a place to go and search out the land but they looked upon that land and said we can't do it we can't do it it's too great and so forth God's desire was to bring them fully into that place of full obedience to his word God brought it to the place of being tested by every word Abraham was brought to the place are being tested by every word of God even being tested by the word manifested in his life they were tested they never came to the full value of it but God rose up a people out of there what they said will never be able to do it God raised a people God brought a people and let me just say this to you in this hour where the church could never attain to it God in this hour by his grace brings a people to full obedience to the word of God that's God's grace to wear a people let me just say it in this way that'll simply believe God's word you know when it comes down to it let me I want I want to just hit this last Point here very quickly not only is God grace stand for us but God's grace holds us Abraham in his life I just have to skip over some scriptures but Abraham in his life he went down and he was told by God to stay in this land and Abraham left that land under pressure God could have said next please next he left the land he knew better but he left it right and he went down there and told a lie he knew better than that too right but you know it all come back around to where that you see that even through it he had to make that right and God spoke to him and said get back into the land you see that's the same grace of God that would speak to you and I when you and I would get out of line maybe you get out of line in your thinking your attitude maybe you get out of line in your prayer life your walk with God your fervency your dedication to God where God and himself could simply just out of things that's laid even in the word that we look at and we can become neglectful of it where it just starts out so so easily it's so innocently until eventually it's a problem it's a problem like oh my goodness how do we get out of this mess that we're in right but Grace itself holds for us now this is what Grace does what it did for Abraham I want you to notice this right here this grace of what it did for Abraham I don't have this on the screen I just want you to listen to it but when Abraham had said it's my sister and lied about it yet the grace of God held him because he repented he was willing to repent that's what matters Grace holds if we're willing to repent ance but if we're simply saying well I did this because so and so did that that ain't repentance that's called passing the buck but the grace of God will still hold for you and I I'm grateful for that God's grace will hold if we're willing to repent I'll tell you friends what a blessing it is to be willing to repent that's a blessing you know what that is you might say well brother Samuel God's Desiring to have a people that will be fully obedient to the word what do you think full obedience to the word of God is is it that every single time in every single area that I were always hitting the mark no it's even when we don't hit the mark that God comes and corrects us are we willing to repent that's what it is God's grace holds for you and I am let me just finish this quote and I'll stop here and anybody that's willing to repent paragraph 88 there the grace of God steal goes for you the grace of God is searching for you so that goes for you backsliders this morning the grace of God is still looking for you if you'll just repent God's grace is sufficient our goodness how precious did that Grace appear the hour I first believed I tell you his grace is not only amazing back there his grace is amazing right here this morning to me it's more amazing right here this morning than it's ever been this grace is so profound does it mean that he lets you and me get by with things no he corrects you and I he comes and lets us know when we're wrong that's part of Grace holding for you and I yeah let me just encourage you it matters what we do with it if you look at the grace of God that comes to you and just despite it listen That's A Dangerous Ground to be on but it's important when God's grace is dealing with the hardship that's what God is doing to bring us to a place of Liberty bring us to a place that even in our own lives to grow a little bit more listen friends you realize it's God's grace that would help you and I to really see ourselves for who we really are well I'm a son I'm a daughter of God I I agree with that but even we need God's grace because sometimes in our own lives we can have such a high opinion of our own selves I've got to go ahead and preach it as it's coming David had such a high opinion of his own self oh David himself here he was he seen this hear this woman she was taking a bath by the name of Bathsheba and he looked there he looked upon her desire to do you realize David broke multiple Commandments of God he lusted after another man's wife are you with me and he and he took her in adultery it was not her it was David she submitted to the word of the king are you hearing me he even encouraged her to lie go invite your husband bring him home with you and then you know because it'll cover up that which is done you see what it is within man always wanting to cover up always wanted to cover himself up because what is it since the fall it's man always wanting to justify himself and try to hide from God but God's Grace is trying to call man beyond his own means [Applause] because it only makes the stain bigger so he had your eye killed oh murder another commandment I don't know about you but I don't know how this boy still wrote in the Bible oh I know had to be the grace of God that's what I had to be now did David just get off scot-free no I don't know but he thought he had it all covered thought he had it all heated he had it all sewed up really good he had all the Pieces Just Right In Line exactly my hair your eyes dead and my everything's good you know bathsheba's in his house and he's got everything like brother Jerry brought it you know he want to make sure he got that in there so when she starts showing you know people aren't you know adding up the months and everything like that all of this he's trying to cover his own trail so then God sends Nathan the prophet Here Comes God's grace walking in shoe leather and God's grace comes to him and said Yes Man and then he took this sheet from a poor man and this poor man treated this sheep notice these terms of endearment as his own daughter fed her cared for her my David is getting all stirred up and he's ready to he's ready to pronounce judgment that's what should happen to that man that man must die brother Brown said that sounds like about us he said we're always ready quick to put judgment on somebody else when they've done wrong Church and I need God's Amazing Grace we need God's grace day by day by day you even need God's grace for people who get on your nerves [Applause] that you can have tolerance with one another come on Friends sometimes we take things and want to modify it quotified scripture fighting and everything else the truth of the matter is it's things pushing our buttons oh come on church but it's always within these things this Sovereign Grace of God stepping in for you and I am and David repented everyone nowhere else to go you want nowhere else to go but hear the grace of God stepped and said but David you're not going to die but this is what's going to happen the sword will never depart from your house now what if David at that moment would have said well that ain't Fair I made this I this happen you know I couldn't help but I I've got this less problem you know the way my passions are you know I'm a passionate man I couldn't help this but he accepted the grace of God David it means trouble it means certain things by decisions that you made but David said no matter those decisions that have been made Grace is saying I have made a way for you though there's trouble though the sword would have to be the same Grace that sounded out right now is the same Grace that'll make our way through every trouble I'll tell you it's Grace Moses he smote The Rock twice right see I'm saying I hope you understand Grace holding for us God's showing you and I it's not you or me holding on it's Grace even in these examples where Moses smote it twice and he should never have smote it twice god brother Brian says like this God should have killed him right there because he broke the scripture because Calvary the lamb only had to be smitten once the next time you speak to it but notice the grace of God remember when Moses said Lord let me go into the land let me lead him in there no I'm not going to let you do it but here in Matthew 17. we see when Jesus Takes Peter James and John under mount Transfiguration There Was Elijah and Moses talking to him I'm telling you how did Elijah God and Moses get there he got to the other side because of God's grace [Applause] and how are you going to get to the other side how am I going to get to the other side the same Rock that's right here the same Rock that's watering us the same Rock that's following us the same Rock that's leading us the same Rock one of these mornings will sweep down and we will stand there on the other side how did we get into this place of Liberty and victory because The Rock has brought us there God's grace and we accepted it Hallelujah listen friends the greatest thing you can do is to accept it it was a boy that was going to die by a firing squad he had deserted he had run away from his unit he deserved to die but he had a friend that went Abraham Lincoln said Mr President I know this boy he didn't mean to do this and so forth he wrote it on a piece of paper pardoned Abraham Lincoln he took that piece of paper to that Soulja Boy that had ran and deserted in a Time he said don't do that you're mocking me you're only mocking get out of here within so much time he was killed by the firing squad question of Rose how could this man have been killed there was a pardon that was given from the president then they decided and came to the decision a pardon is only a pardon if it's accepted yeah as a pardon and I'm going to say this to you right here this morning it's God's pardoning grace for you this morning God's pardon and Grace for you and for me it's a place an opportunity to accept that Grace to wear if there's things that you can you as a spirit of God deals with your life calling you out of a life of sin the spirit of God calling you from backslidings and wanderings and to where that you look and you say how did I get off like this my life at one time I was very fervent with God and how did I get to this place to where let me just tell you something you could look at that and try to figure that out a month to Sundays but it only started little by little but let me just tell you something right now the way to get back is little by little is to have just that faith that God is wanting to admit to your heart to say Lord forgive me for the heir of my ways forgive me Lord when I've placed other things ahead of you maybe you've complained maybe you've been waiting on your healing maybe you've been longing for your deliverance maybe that be setting sin in that way that's just loading you down but let me tell you there is sufficient Grace here this morning to take care of every problem there's sufficient Grace to deal with every doubt and every unbelieving Spirit what must I do brother Samuel believe and accept what he has done for you and let me tell you this and then you confess what he's done for you and don't ever let your confession be something different well I don't feel like a good Christian that's what the devil wants you to say but if you confess and you watch it works salvation if there's something that's out of line listen the Holy Ghost can call things out one by one by one by one but when his presence come he's the same one that was there in Africa where those women they didn't know that they were wrong in the way that they did not have any clothing on top but the spirit of God came by and it brought conviction in their life let me tell you what it is it's God's grace that's leading you and I in the way of repentance it's God's grace that's leading you and I to lying with his word that is the grace of almighty God and now it comes upon you and I when we accept God's grace I'll tell you it's God's grace right here this morning Grace that stands for us and Grace that holds us I'll tell you thank God for Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that is greater than all my sins great Grace Grace [Music] God's grace Grace that will pardon and [Music] release sorry we got it now Grace Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that

here at a moment you might say brother Samuel I don't need God's grace I do I do I need more of his grace I need more of it and I know there's in this building this morning there's lives that need Grace [Music] and I'll tell you in the presence of almighty God I wouldn't be ashamed to say Lord I Need Your Grace Lord remember there's a habit in your life you can't get Beyond and you'll say God I need your grace Lord maybe there's unbelief you can't get Beyond but just say God I need your grace let me tell you he's a Waymaker maybe there's something there in your life it's something that stood between you and a full surrender to God maybe it's something that you really love but when you see God would you give me Grace Lord to die to that thing in my life I don't want to hold on to nothing Lord I don't want to hold on to nothing I want to come with My Arms Wide Open to you Lord Hallelujah God bless you Hallelujah God The Sovereign God to give Sovereign Grace this morning you might say by the same now I don't deserve another opportunity another chance I know you might think that but remember Sovereign Grace is dealing with your heart and to be able to rise and say Lord I accept that Lord God has given Grace right here this morning through his word for you to live beyond all your failures your presence circumstances he's given you a word to focus on that's greater than the conditions that you're in he's given you a word that'll Lead You forth in Victory say God I take that Grace this morning maybe you've got a little cold on God this morning maybe you've got it there's some things where you can look back and say man my my feet I've taken certain paths I'm I'm not a servant and as I used to be well what is it that's bringing you to that awareness it's the grace of God it's not the condemnation it's the grace of God that's calling to you as a son and daughter of God and what's he here to do lead you into that path of fervency and he'll teach you he'll show you he'll help you even on the areas where you drifted astray if you allow him this morning the grace of God will minister to your life and you'll bring out a testimony in that area of your life Hallelujah he's faithful Church if you've never received the grace of God of the Holy Ghost in your life he's here this morning he's here this morning to deposit that into your life but must I do accepting accept what he has done for you except that provided way lay everything else down say Lord I'm willing to repent I'm willing to lay it all down there nothing else matters but you Jesus nothing else matters but you won't oh brother Samuel does that ever stop no it never stops that's still what beats within my heart right now is Lord nothing else but you when he shows me my wrong when there's something where it's my heart has been gripped as we talked about complaining or something in that way Lord all I want is you I want your presence I Want Your Divine favor Lord God it's what matters Hallelujah before we pray anyone else want to be remembered in prayer this morning [Music] Hallelujah if you'd want to come and pray this morning to alter the altars open Hallelujah hallelujah
