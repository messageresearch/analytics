amen and we're just thankful to the Lord good to see a lot of different uh young people it's gathered here some that feel young think they're young but we've come here you know and I think even as young people you could look around the room and there is your support we've got an invisible host that's gathered here tonight as well amen it's the angels of the Lord amen and the angel of the Lord is in the camp and we also have amen other lives trophies and testimonies that are here as an encouragement to say Amen we are thankful for God's grace amen and we believe that what God has done in our lives he's doing in your life amen and we just want God to have his way tonight in a special way so good to see each and every one of you amen we just love you and it's just a special time that God affords us to be able to come together to you like this you know a lot of times if sometimes I find terms that the young people they it catches hold with them you know God is just such a personal God and it's just as personal even more so than the ringtone on your phone you've got ringtones for text you've got ringtones for calls and sometimes even as special ones depending on who it is it's calling you now some of you are looking before but young people know what I'm talking about but you see God is just that personal and he's just that personal that as you would just respond to what he has and what he's saying to you when Isaiah came in the temple that day he recognized he was in the presence of God and all and the greatest thing he could do is say here I am and God came and began to minister to the need that was in Isaiah's life and we all have needs here tonight right I believe we're all here with that purpose and I believe God's desire is to speak to us he's here to do for you tonight just welcome him just invite him right to your Pew most importantly just invite him right to your heart and say Lord just move through every area of my life take the light of the word and just move through every area of my life I'm sure that every one of us could say if there's something in my life Lord that's hindering I want it out of the way because I want a Clear Channel that the Holy Spirit can move through and operate and move in my life in a deeper way let's just invite him that way just let him come in a personal way he's here to do for us tonight so as we just turn the service over let's sing that again I want to live the way he wants me to live [Music] oh I want to live the way he wants me out to live I want to give until there is just no more to give I want to love foreign [Music] [Music] God is good to us isn't he yes am I not turned I think we're good I think we're good now there we go all right we have arrived God bless you good to be in the house of the Lord tonight and uh it's an honor to be among you again and I really have appreciated the um the time uh that I've spent here it's been a real blessing Brother Sam Sister Kim been so accommodating and uh receptive you know like uh hospitable and and it's just been a blessing I've gained about 10 pounds and uh I mean it's just uh it's just been wonderful just the fellowship and and the time together so uh we go we leave with with good memories just uh honored to have my wife with me on this trip and and uh good to see old friends and faces here that we've known for a number of years so uh we just trust that something that said tonight now uh would be a blessing and I I will tell you this that uh through the week I was just kind of wrestling about this service tonight I wasn't wrestling about any of the others but I was just wrestling about this service tonight and uh we were we had lunch today and and I I was thinking about the service again and then we went to the best ice cream place in North America and we're just sitting there and Sister Kim was sharing a little bit of a testimony and uh it was it was almost like and I I don't have uh many experiences like this but it was just like the Holy Spirit just registered something in my heart and said that's it and so I just I just felt uh this is the direction that he would have us to go tonight so if you don't mind while you're standing let's take your Bibles and get let's go to Romans uh Romans the eighth chapter and let's let's begin here and uh let's see if we can get this up here yeah okay good so we're going to title this tonight feeling all alone feeling all alone Romans chapter 8 and hold your Bible because we're going to come back to this a little bit later on Paul writes and we know we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose Heavenly Father we ask your blessing now upon the reading of the word and Lord we can read it we can talk about it we can Minister it but Lord only you can Quicken it and change us with it so Lord we open our hearts to you now and ask that you would just take complete control Lord take my spirit in every Spirit under your control for the glory of God and Lord minister to Hearts I pray make the word real make it personal and Lord May nothing in our lives hinder the moving of the Holy Spirit forgive us Lord for anything that may be contrary and Lord just take complete control we pray in Jesus lovely name amen and all God's people said amen you may be seated well it's great to see the young people coming out here I gotta ask how many of you are here from Pennsylvania let's see your hands look at that someone said brother Matt Leitner was in the building is Matt here he's here somewhere is he he will be all right I hadn't seen brother Mann for a long time great to have brother and Nathaniel here and uh just each and every one and uh may the Lord help us well let's just jump right in is that all right and uh we uh just want to talk a little bit about the age we live in and some of the corresponding pressures that uh that exist in our time here and I did a little series at home uh called living above your cares and I was really um I had actually ministered on that subject many many years ago and then I I came back to it again a little while ago and you know with with a little bit more I guess a little bit more experience a little bit more perspective and uh I was just amazed at how timely that was not only for the people in my own assembly but for the people uh around many people around who uh were were thankful for the Insight that was was given through the statements of a prophet in this last day how many are glad we had a Prophet come in this last day and Through the Bible and how God makes things open up in a certain season and we're thankful for that we have a a wonderful assembly back home and there are folks that really love the Lord and I'd love to minister to them and uh they're they're just special people but you know what I find that uh people it isn't our fault uh but God made us all human and we all have stresses and we all have the questions and we all have sometimes we have Forks in the road that um you know make things a little bit unclear and and so we'll wrestle at times or seasons in our life with decisions and uh God knows that and I I want to I want to underscore that for you that no matter where you are God knows where that is and he knows what that feels like he's able to be touched by the the infirmities that we have they're not foreign to him he understands how we feel he understands what it feels like to be alone and to be betrayed and to be criticized and uh to be persecuted and be lied about he understands all of that so it is not a thing that you can go through that that he can't relate to and that's that's a wonderful thing and he left us promises and he left us uh you know great consolation through his word uh that even though you may feel all alone you really are never all alone and and that's that's a great thing now it's an easy thing to say that but it's another thing to really angle let that anchor in your heart so that you can you can take that with you in some of the difficult valleys that you go through and so uh I just want to say this and and maybe there's there's someone here tonight that uh you know may benefit from this and I I trust that'll be the case so uh let's take a let's take a look here and uh a couple of introductory statements here brother Branham says now we're facing two scriptures uh in contrast and in this Shalom message he's referring back to the book of Isaiah chapter 61 and he's and it says in there arise and shine for the uh for your light Has Come For the Glory of God has come upon the Earth he said the light is here and and that's that's the first thing and then the second thing he said the next verse says but gross darkness is upon the people darkness is upon the Earth and gross darkness is upon the people and he said so we have a contrast here and the world is in one of the most chaotic times of Darkness that it ever stood in and yet it's standing and again the Most Blessed light that's ever shown what a paradox we have the greatest light by the greatest message we had the greatest understanding of the word of God as we said this morning that God's given us a perfect interpretation of the word of God and that's either really true it's really false I'm going to say it's really true I believe it's really true and he's given us that blessed light that that is greater than any other light of any other age but it's also a chaotic time of Darkness a great time of Darkness where there's a lot of Confusion And there's a lot of different opinions and there's a lot of access to everything in our age we have access to everything all the time isn't that right and and it's it can be really confusing because when you go uh when you try to find an answer and the way we all find an answer all the time is we Google that's exactly right and we want to know something that's where we go it's our first first uh resource right no matter where you are just about it's kind of a habit we just jump on and we Google things and find out not always a healthy habit but that is what we do and when we do that you'll find a a multitude of opinions about everything about everything and studies show this and then studies will show the opposite and studies will show that studies show that there really isn't any real clear answer on this and and it can be really chaotic but in a more serious sense uh there are there are things you have to Wade through to make sure you know where you're standing and to know what you believe because there are lots of different opinions brother Branham said this is be the way that it is but I will tell you something God never left us here without an answer to the problems that the age will throw with us God never leaves you in a place where there isn't an answer for the troubles that we face right we believe that and then again he says Ah got to turn it on who knew it wasn't meant for you brother Branham says to have peace here in this in this earth it was never meant for you to have peace here if you did you'd get accustomed to this world I mean you wouldn't want to leave right things would be pretty good God don't want you to be accustomized to this world he wants you to rest in him and come to him then and then you'll have peace God it was not meant for you to have peace here that doesn't that doesn't take a long time for us to agree with that's really true now I found this this scripture back here in Psalm 42 and verse 6 and David writes these words here he says oh my God my soul is cast down within me and therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of the hermanites and from the hill mizar and I looked at that and I wondered about what David was actually saying he said my soul is cast down Within Me I'm not asking for a show of hands but I'm sure a lot of us have times where Seasons where we're downcast we feel we're unsure we're maybe we're insecure about things and maybe we're uh we're thinking well things haven't come out the way that we thought they would and uh you know I'm 16 and I'm not married yet been a bridesmaids bridesmaid twice and I had not married yet you know Lord uh hello and and there are times when things happen to us that we don't always understand and there will be things that happen to you in life that you don't always understand there'll be things that happen in life that you don't have an answer for and there will be things that happen in your life that your pastor won't have an answer for there are things that will happen in life that you'll have to hang on until God makes that plane in your life that God makes that helps you understand what what's happened in your life and it's in times like that that your faith is going to have to hold you when your understanding doesn't there are things that are going to happen in in your life that you don't understand and it's then you're going to have to hang on by faith and not by understanding and so David says my soul is cast down within me and therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and this is the he's referring here to the journey of the children of Israel on in the days of Moses he said I remember the from back there when when the children of Israel were in were across Jordan they were on the other side and they were in the land of the herminites and this is from Mount Hermon that's what he's referring to Mount Hermon Mount Hermon is in Jordan it's not in Israel and in in in the the hill mizar he's referring to locations that are outside the boundary of the land of Israel and David said I remember thee from then and the things that you did and back in those days in those particular locations God brought great victories for the children of Israel even though they weren't in the land they were outside the land but God did great things for them and David is saying that he said Lord I I feel bad my soul is cast down within me but I remember how you stood for the children of Israel back there outside the lamb and you helped us win great victories back then and I realized that Lord if you can help them outside the land what can you do inside the land and and to a to a Jew now the land is their inheritance isn't it it's their Promised Land the the actual physical land is and God said to Abraham look around and count the uh the the the the sand on the seashore that's your land that's your possessions your inheritance and for a Christian now our our land is not a physical land it's not it's not this building or it's not uh this town our land is the word of God the revealed word of the god that's our inheritance and and so David is saying that my if God can help people when they're outside what could God do for those that are on the inside and you know that tells me that uh you know there are times when uh in our lives and we can different circumstances can happen and we might feel like we're outside of the reach of God or you may have loved ones that are outside of the reach of God you remember this verse here and realize that even if a person strayed away and they're not where they should be they're not within the boundaries of where uh they should be God is still able to help them out there in the same way that he can help them in here and the minute where life takes you no matter where life drags you God can help you no matter where you are you just need to look up to him and remember him especially in those Seasons where we feel cast down yeah brother bam said in the breach he said for we know the whole creation groaned and travaileth in pain together until now he said Nature's groaning we're groaning everything is groaning because we realize there's something that's not right you know why because the whole earth is going back to its origin the whole earth is going back to uh to to the way things are and scientists will call it global warming and they'll call it all kinds of different things uh they'll try to get you not to eat McDonald's burgers with styrofoam containers because that's going to destroy the world I think it's going to take a little bit more than McDonald's containers to destroy the world the food will destroy the world not the containers and brother Graham said you know everything is groaning and and we realize in our heart we realize something's not right no matter how good you have it you realize there's something in you that's not settled that there's something more that that you want to you want to move on to the next thing that God has and brother bam says the only way we can do it has grown for it because that groaning comes from somewhere it is a calling to another kingdom that you really belong in and it's not this Kingdom it's that one like I said this morning you're not being conditioned to live here forever God is not God is not making a way for us to live in this world in this body forever because no matter how good you have it no matter how good you live you're still going to die God is conditioning us to live in another kingdom in another place right he's conditioning us to live uh where we where we belong where we actually belong and he already has a body for us over there but in this life and in this world we groan how many would agree we we Nature's groaning we're groaning everything is groaning and so in the in the path of life there are many attacks Satan will come at us physically there are physical things that happen to us there are mental stresses and mental diseases that people uh that people face and there is spiritual warfare that rages in a realm you don't always see but there are stresses there are fears uh there's nervousness uh there are things that happening in the spiritual realm and brother Branham helped us to uh acknowledge the fact that those those battles actually do rage I remember listening to brother Branham and he said he said see I don't know if you can hear it he said but that one demon is screaming at another one over here I went back and listened to those sermons very carefully and there was nothing you could hear in the natural there was no sounds of screaming in the natural but he's not in the natural per se he's caught between dimensions and he's he's hearing this thing that's going on and my goodness I don't doubt at all but that could be going on here tonight and we may not even realize it but you could be feeling some sort of pressure or some sort of influence in your life and those things are real how many would agree those things are real in the same way that if you have a broken leg you've really feel something if you go through a season where uh you know you have a fear in your life or you maybe you've experienced anxiety or maybe you worry about things you know what that's just as real as a broken leg and you know what I'd like to say this I'm of the school of thought I believe that my God can heal all of our diseases God has not limited himself just to fixing physical things he can heal arthritis he can heal diabetes he can heal heart problems he can do all of that but God can heal your broken heart God can heal God can pour oil upon a troubled mind God is able to calm your anxious fears I believe that I I believe that tonight because I I believe that he knows what you're going through no matter what it is that you're going through and this is not this is I'm not talking about psychology here or anything like that I'm talking about our healer who still lives today and is able to heal today the same as he ever could I said he's still a Healer tonight the same as he ever was and I believe there are many things that the people of God need especially in a world that's falling apart like brother Branham just described everything is groaning everything is changing everything is turning it's all going back to the way uh that it was meant to be and and I believe that God knows that the people who are in in the position we're called to be in which is the bride of Christ we're caught between those two Dimensions we're becoming caught between this life and the eternal because actually you're citizens of two kingdoms right you have a passport you can see in a one you can't see right and and we are actually citizens of two different kingdoms and and you're you're living you're living for one and you're living in one you're living in one you're living for one and so therefore you have two different kinds of pulls in your life and let me tell you sometimes that can be stressful brother manham says now there are times and things that happen that changes the whole course of your life there are times in your life and things that happen in your life that changes the course of your life we know that we're all aware you remember when brother Branham lost his daughter and his wife remember that I mean that changed him that that that changed him uh in a great way he never forgot that he that was an experience he carried with him all the way through and you remember when she was laying on the bed in the hospital and brother Brandon walked in and woke her up and she said bill you know why I'm going I thought oh my you know and and he he was the one who had listened to his mother-in-law and he's out there on the river trying to start the motor like that and she says bill you know why I'm going oh I'll tell you what that something like that would change a person's life there are people I know who have gone through car accidents and they've gone through uh calamities in their in their life they've gone through accidents that they never prayed for and never expected but all of a sudden life is different and certain things take place a long life's journey that changes the whole course of life for us and they're not always negative things uh you remember how Moses met got at the burning bush that changed everything didn't it I mean there was there was nothing the same for Moses after that when when he met God at The Burning Bush brother Matt God bless you good to have you here today they said you were coming and brother Branham says in Watchmen what of the night there is none of us that are immune from troubles there is none of us everybody say none of us none of us are immune from troubles in other words you're all vulnerable to the attacks of Satan there but I'm glad we have a resource but we're all immune we're sorry we're none of us are immune from the troubles that come and God has not promised to excuse us from all sickness but it is written that his strength is sufficient Christians get sick Christian cars break down Christian checks bounce right and you know what they bounce just as high as Pagan chicks they do Christians die my mom was a believer and she loved the Lord with all of her heart raised the Catholic all of her life and finally left the Catholic Church the Catholic Church and uh when she was 66 years old no she was 77 years old my dad died at 66 she was 77 and when she was 77 she had a pain always a healthy relatively healthy all of her life some of the Palmer's remember Sister coffee and and uh you know a healthy person all of her life you know just a spry ready to go all of a sudden one morning she woke up had a pain and discomfort and went to the doctor it got a little bit worse she went to the doctor after a couple of days and he took a look at her and they said we need to do a couple more tests I ran some more tests came in and sat her down in the in the office in the hospital in the ER and they said Mrs Coffey we need to tell you that you have pancreatic cancer and we are not going to treat you generally when they find pancreatic cancer it's often too advanced for them to do anything about it and they said to her we have no treatment for you at all we are giving you two months to live I mean this was a great shock to her because she uh she had no idea and you know just living her life just like you and I and uh carrying on and they said to her you have two months to live we my wife and I we went up and and we were with her for that uh period of that last two months and I would sit on the bed and I'd I I'd say to her you know just me and her be sitting there and I'd read her by read her Bible for her which I have her Bible and I'd say what do you want to hear and she'd say turn to the book of Philippians and I I'd open up to the book of Philippians I'd read chapter after chapter she just loved to hear it just lay there and listen to the word and I asked her one night I said Mom what does it feel like as a as a as a person just as a a you know an ordinary person who's living their life and then all of a sudden the doctor says you got two months to live tell me what that feels like what went through your mind when he said those words to You and she said nothing nothing went through my mind she said I wasn't afraid I wasn't nervous she said to me nothing changed she said this is what I've lived for I have lived to go back to Heaven she said I've lived to go back to my right body she said I've lived to go back and join those saints that have gone on the other side and she said I have no fear she said if I'm Healed I'll stay and if she says I I pass away she said I'm a I'm a citizen of another kingdom Where I Belong over there she said this holds no fear for me and I thought Lord I said to myself Lord Give Me That kind of a an attitude in the in in the valley like she's going through God has not promised to excuse us from sickness but it is written that his strength is sufficient how many believe that as a matter of fact many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereths out of them all and he will never put so much upon us but what he will give us Grace to bear so we have that consolation he'll never give us so much that that it would be too great but what he will give us is Grace to Bear now I pastored in Ohio here for 16 years as I said this morning and some of the folks are here that were in that church and uh delighted to have him here tonight and I remember and you may not remember but I'm going to tell you this that we had a small church and and you know just uh uh small income in that church and I wasn't working I was trying to do things full time and uh I I man things were tight things were tight and uh you know I I just I prayed often and I just said Lord you know I you sent me here this is what your will is and I know that and I'm just leaning upon you and I'm just trusting you and I often prayed that prayer and uh just looked to him and one day I went to the mailbox and um I opened it up and there was a letter from Lee Vale brother Lee Vale and I didn't know brother veiled very well I had met him but I didn't know him really well but here was a letter from brother Lee Vale and I opened it up it was a letter and there was a check there for two thousand three hundred and eleven dollars and 50 cents I remember the amount two thousand three hundred and eleven dollars and fifty cents and I I looked at that and I read the letter brother Vale said he said in every small congregation you always need at least two more tithe pairs to make it work and he said so if you take the average salary and as brother Vale would do take the average salary of a person living in Ohio and have them pay tithes weekly multiply that by two and have it go out about three months this is the amount of money that should come into your church if you had two more time fares and then on then on the bottom I mean this is exactly what we had need of right at that moment there and and then on the bottom he said God never gives us more than we can bear but he comes real close sometimes and I I just said Thank You Lord thank you for for thinking about me here and and God never puts too much on us but he'll always give us Grace to bear and we have that consolation you know that you're not going through anything that God doesn't know about that you're not going through anything that God doesn't know about he knows all of your struggles and he knows all of the cares that you have and he has he has you in mind he has you on his heart and you know what he always has an answer for the things that we go through do you believe that tonight all right well let's let's just dig into that just a little bit is that all right let me give you some examples here and I think there these are really good ones they're some of my favorites here so uh let's talk about Elijah for a minute and and you know the scripture back here in First Kings chapter 19 after Mount Carmel and Elijah runs down the hill and he's gone with his servant the Bible says that that that he arose and he went for his life and he came to Beersheba which belonged to Judah and he left his servant there so he's by him he's him and his servant are Jezebel is pursuing him and she's got the power she's got the power to destroy him if she could catch him but she just can't capture and he's he's in the wilderness and then he goes to a certain distance and then leaves his servant there and you know what now he's all alone now this is a prophet so you think well brother Barry I've you know I've been going through something here hey this is a prophet now okay now watch watch how the Bible describes this situation here but he himself won today's Journey Into the Wilderness and he came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested this was his prayer request he requested himself that he might die Lord I have a prayer request I'd like to die if that's all right who's taking up the prayer requests here I'd like to put that up in the Pulpit I'd like to die and he says it's enough I just don't think I can take any more I'd like to die I don't know if you've ever been there but he said I'd like to die oh Lord take away my life for I'm not better than my father's and he lay and slept under the juniper tree imagine as you're prophet of God I mean this is not this is not one of his servants this is a prophet of God who's there a man that's got that kind of communion with God and he's underneath the tree and he's just saying Lord if you don't mind I'd like to submit this request I'd like to die now brother man he says about this situation he says now don't be hard on Elijah he said I find myself under the juniper tree many times he says as a matter of fact I'm under there now and he describes that in detail in one in another sermon but he says now as he lay underneath to sleep in the juniper tree behold an angel touched him and said arise and eat now I'm just let's look at a statement here brother Brandon makes it in Elijah who was trying with a heart in him of God he was trying with all of his heart trying to show the people that God was still god well that was up among Carmel right and whoever whoever whichever altar God answers with fire that'll be the god we'll serve but I mean man what a state the country was in when all of the people are having to decide is God real or not I mean a lot of them are not sure whether bail is God or Jehovah is God they're not really sure imagine now living in a time like that when they're when the people are not clear about whether God is God or not and God answers God answers with fire God answered supernaturally and cleared up the question very carefully but Elijah now is is moving out into the Wilderness that anointing is lifting off him and he said it had backfired on him and he ran into Wilderness when he heard it when Jezebel was after him and he laid under the juniper tree to find consolation and he sent his servant away and left him and guess what from this point on in the story he's all alone and now brother Rana fills in the brush Strokes for us now he tells us here what really happens let me paraphrase it for you you'll find it here in Watchman or sorry what hear us now Elijah but don't read it don't read it let me tell you what what this quote says brother random looks down or Sorry God looks down at Elijah who's laying on the ground he's laying underneath this tree he's writing out prayer requests I'd like to die I'd like to die and he's laying down and he's he's he he to him there's no future there's there's nothing really worth living for right so he lays down and he closes his eyes lay down no right there on the chair is fine every good service needs a dummy I mean a volunteer so sorry did I say should I never said that so now this is what God does all right now if if you have later you can read the quote but this is what God does just relax okay God calls all the angels and he says hey hey get all the Angels line them up here and they want them all in a straight line if you don't mind and when you come and get in a straight line of Joel to hold your hands out like that he says to the angels hold your hands on like that and when they're all standing there God walks down through the line and picks the angel with the softest hands that's what he's looking for he's looking for the angel but the softest hands and he says now look I want you to come on with me and don't you scare him but I want you to walk over and just stroke his brow and I want you to go into the kitchen and cook them up something and put all the vitamins you got in there I want you to bring it to them now I think that's really great but you know what I think is greater is what brother Branham doesn't say and what God doesn't do what God doesn't do is say to him hey hey buddy you're in the message you know what you're a Believer hello you're a prophet you're not supposed to be down you're not supposed to feel bad you've got all the promises in the world they're all yours why don't you snap out of this do you realize how I've got to kind of make up something to tell everybody else to say that Elijah doesn't feel good you loser why don't you get back on your feet you're a Believer after all hello he doesn't do that God does not make him feel bad for feeling bad it ain't no fun to feel bad but God's not making him feel bad because he feels bad you know what God does God has a remedy for this situation and the remedy is not is not being aggressive and it's not shame and it's not more embarrassment here it's not him trying to push through something he's not able to push through God says I want you angel you got you with the softest hands go in the kitchen and if you don't mind make him up some biscuits and pour vitamins in there give them the good stuff give them the stuff that nobody else gets very easily and I want you to bring that to him and they laid it down and if you read the story they laid it down next to Elijah and they just went like this and they gently just woke him up and the Bible says that he woke up and he ate those biscuits and then he he was refreshed and he drank the water that was there and then he laid down again foreign for 40 days he lays down for 40 days again brother Bram said there's a lot of doctors that like to know what was in those cakes he said there's a lot of doctors that would love to know that because whatever it was it gave Elijah just enough space to kind of get back on his feet again and to begin to walk and to begin to kind of gather things together but you know what God never made him feel bad for feeling that way and I I'm just so thankful for that because I know as a human being we we're we're bound to find times in the valley that you know what you don't want to be there you're not praying Lord send me through hard times and Lord just break my spirit and Lord it just put me flat on my back lord may bring me to the place where I can make prayer requests that I'd like to die we don't get up in the morning and pray for that do we we pray for protection we pray for God's leadership we pray to be you know strong and we pray to be full of joy because the joy of the Lord is your strength and we pray that way and we want it to be that way we pray in that way for our children and for our church if you're a pastor but you know what life happens and life is not always straight and flat and predictable even if you're predestinated life sometimes will throw things at you that you're not expecting but I will tell you this that all things work together for good to them that love God and here he is he's saying this soft-handed Angel went over and ministered to him and then brother banham throws this sentence in here I believe for me and you and he says remember if you've done your best he said God still got those angels in order he loves you just the same as he did Elijah [Music] thank you don't feel bad for feeling bad don't make a determination in your hearts you're going to stay there and don't get on Facebook and tell the world hey this is how I feel so everybody will Pity Me should I understand that oh but no matter what you go through I'm here to tell you tonight God loves you the same as he did Elijah I feel like getting up there buddy God reaches out of hand to those that really need that that hand reached out can I go a little further ladies a stranger brother brand says in the prayer line I don't know you we're strangers but I notice you have a phobia of he said something about the winter time and and when winter time comes you get scared and it makes you all upset and it makes you constipated he said you can't eat right that's true he said I cursed that devil in the name of Jesus Christ go home and I won't bother you no more it's left you so in other words here what he's helping us to understand is that people can actually have a physical manifestation of a fear or a stress that's going on somewhere else you understand there's a connection and sometimes it takes God to figure out that connection because a doctor and bless their hearts and you know when you say bless your heart you can say whatever you want to after that bless their hearts a good doctor is going to look at that symptom and try to deal with that but you know what he's dealing with the wrong affecting that person now here's again brother Branham says in he's actually here in Cleveland Ohio he says you have a few troubles inward troubles and I see what's wrong he said you tried everything to get well been the doctors it's a nerve condition and nothing you take nothing can help you he said you've been given up the doctors have kind of you know but Jesus will help you now he said you want to be healthy have all that weary gloomy crazy feeling like you're losing your mind he said you want to be healthy you don't want to have all that now that started he said on the prostate who knew who knew he's taken all kinds of things for nervous problems and that's not where it began at all but really what it's doing he said it's a demon it haunts you and you have no peace at all and day and night it's after you seems like you just get gloomy feelings in there weary don't sleep nervous getting up at night down through your life you've had trouble when you were a little boy with knee pants on I believe it was a dog that chased you and you ran up onto a porch and who would know that but God Alone how marvelous he said how marvelous you know why because now we've tracked it back to the cause of the problem and when you know the cause of the problem Hey listen that's about half the battle when we know how to pray we know how to deal with that and he said now I'm going to ask God to leave you to let it leave you and while I'm praying you say I love this I love this from Brother Graham tells us how to pray I mean that takes the mystery out of what you should say in a situation like this right and he tells the man he said you say this in your heart Jesus I believe with all my heart and now I commit myself to you and I believe the prayer of faith is going to save me now that's what he told him to pray you know I'd be willing to say that if you you prayed that in your situation if you prayed that in your condition that would probably be okay with God too you don't need to have a long theological prayer oh god of Heaven thou who has created us heavens and the Earth hey God already knows that you just need to tell him I believe it on my heart and I believe the prayer Faith's going to save the sick you just be real and just talk to God and just let God deal with this because you know what God is the one who uncovered the cause he's the one who's got the solution as well he said let's pray bow our heads together and he speaks to that spirit and so forth without demon tormenting his life in the name of Jesus come out and he says it's gone you're free go out of here testifying he said you feel all right fine wonderful he said go out there happy rejoicing testifying and he said telling people that God healed you forget you were ever nervous and 30 days from now you'll be a different man God bless you my brother you know what he doesn't say he doesn't say my goodness you are a Christian you're a Believer you're hearing a prayer line Christians don't get sad Christians don't get nervous Christians can he doesn't do that he doesn't make them feel bad because he feels bad he goes all the way relying on the Holy Spirit to find the cause and then deals out and brings it all the way forward you look at how God dealt with Elijah you look how a prophet in this age dealt with people that came in the prayer line over and over and over again sister he says you have trouble inward trouble it's a nervous condition and you feel like you're going to lose your mind and it works on you worst time is in the evening because light has a lot to do with this and he says sometimes you just go sit in a chair and you're doing something when you're praying too and I believe you were washing dishes and you were praying and when you heard about the meeting you prayed and then you got a card and you came tonight and the card was called now watch what he says he says now you believe that God will hear my prayer he said ask God and do you believe that if I would tell you if if I would tell you that it left you you would know that I told you the truth in other words you're going to know when this is gone you're going to know when this heaviness or this darkness that blankets you is actually gone and he said and everything seems like a phobia that's a Greek word for fear everything he said seems like you're nervous about everything you're nervous about your kids you're nervous about how your husband drives well I mean most women are that phobia is very common that sure is you're nervous about your health you're nervous about the times you're nervous about whether you're going to make it you're with all of that and it isn't normal to be that fearful isn't normal you're wanting hey this is not Dr Dobson now is that all right there's a prophet now 20th century prophet and he's saying I'm only saying what the tape say he said you're wanting to get well and I'm going to ask Jesus how to he said now to heal you and I believe he will do it and he said you've had quite a struggle in life and I don't have to say it in other words he's he's avoiding saying something to this woman in public care he said because this is alive here this is this is being recorded so he said I I don't have to say it and I don't want to say it here in front of you if he said you know what I'm speaking of so there's things that are going on here and he prays for this woman and he comes down he said foul Spirits have tried to put Pride upon her who knew who knew this is where this is where this is coming from and he said but Thou Art here to remove this curse of the enemy he said help me God in this Duel of faith and and then he he continues to pray and then he says I was just trying to get her in the right mental attitude she wouldn't have to be prayed for I was just trying to get her in that right mental attitude she wouldn't have to be prayed for because the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass so in other words here he is trying to move this woman into a position of faith and he's trying to bring her up to a level where now he can he can the Holy Spirit can uncover that and give her the solution give her the Deliverance that she needs here but there's obviously some complex things that are going on here that he doesn't really describe to us but there are things that are happening and he's he's being very gentle really with her he's not shaming her in public he's not shaming her in front of the church are you hearing me tonight he's he's he's gently dealing with this woman here and the pride and the issues that are there let me tell you saying to God I I would just say this very very gently here diplomatically here as much as I can I I know that in a congregation this size there's probably some people that are going through things that they wish they weren't going through and I I don't know your history I don't know all your histories I don't know what what's happening in your household but I I know this that one of the worst things I could do is just to Simply say to you snap out of it because if you could snap out of it you probably would have done that a long time before this service and if you get if you could untie the knots and you could make things all level and peaceful in your household and have shalom in the home you'd probably would have done that a long time ago but there are times when you just need to see the supernatural moving of God and you need to just appeal to him and say Lord I I'm praying to prayer of faith and I'm just expecting tonight and trusting in you and and and there are some times where listen there are some times where we do not have the right mental attitude and sometimes it takes maybe a sermon like this or something at this weekend like this and helps us to realize we can trust him we can have confidence in him we can rest in his promises and and we can have faith in God and and that's what brother that's exactly what brother Bam's trying to do here in this situation hahaha now brother bam said now you're looking this way as we talk and he said now do you believe the Bible is true he's again he's in a prayer line now your trouble he said you've had an accident now watch this I I think this is amazing what he sees here in this man's life he said your trouble he said you've had an accident and in that accident in your factory you were gassed with carbon monoxide gas and it poisoned you in your liver and you've had trouble with that and you had trouble with your stomach and had trouble with your heart and the man says right and it's made you so nervous until you built yourself in a complex but your poor and you got to go back to work so there's no workman's compensation back then and there's no safety standards in the in the factory so that he's got a harmful chemical that's affecting his liver who knew right and he's got nowhere to turn but he also has no money so he's got to go back to work but he said you're afraid to go back to work afraid of the carbon monoxide gas uh hello how can you blame the guy right see where he's at he didn't wake up and say Lord send carbon monoxide gas today he didn't do that he's a victim of circumstances that he did not cause I mean this is not something he brought down on himself now there are some things that happen that you brought down on yourself right there are some things that we do that bring trouble into our lives we know that's true but we also know that there are situations in our life we did not cause we did not bring them into our lives but they're there anyway because you know why you have an enemy and you have an enemy that works overtime studying you even when you're asleep to try to do whatever he can to do whatever he can to make your life miserable and to get you to doubt the promises of God and to turn your trust away from him and that enemy works over time in doing that and here's this man he's thought it all out he's he's faced with a situation here he's got a hungry family he's got to go back to work he's he's got these problems physically in major organs here and brother bam says you're afraid to go back to work afraid of the carbon monoxide gas but he said it's going to be all right remember if he'll tell me who you are will you accept it and go back and be of good cheer he said your name is Mr Wagner go back on your road it's over I got news for you tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever God don't want you to be sad you know what temper does he said that's one of the awfullest things there is because about 60 percent of the cause of all sickness is temper and God does not want you to be sad God does not want you to be stressed so here's a good question what do we do if you're in this place tonight what do you do what are our remedies what can we apply in order to deal with the pressures of Life the situations we find ourselves in we don't have brother Brown to go to right we can't go to Jeffersonville and knock on his door we can't be like Naaman the leper who came to the prophet and asked for an answer we we don't have a place to go like that we don't have a place to go like that but we do have a place to turn let me give you a couple of places to turn is that all right are we okay the rest of this service now tonight we're going to deal with a couple of things we can do number one you can let off the pressure because worrying really doesn't help very much he said now you say well I wonder brother Branham he said don't wonder let off the pressure commit your case to God and go on as if it was all over don't build up pressure it lets off pressure when you do that when you give it to the right one and you know God's got it when you lay it at his feet you know he's heard it you can walk away now let's let's do it this way all right hello there let's say let's say that I got a problem with my watch okay and I can't fix it I've tried but I can't fix it and since I bought this watch in another country I can't really go back and and you know give it to the guy who I bought it from so I got to bring to the repairman right so you're the watch repairman and I give it to him now what do I do I sit down and say all right buddy come on we're going to fix this together I'm going to stay right here until next step and I brought my sleeping bag because I'll stay until you get it fixed okay now you hand me the tools you have some of the tools I'll have some of the tools do we do that is that how we bring stuff to the repairman no you know what we do we say hey my watch is broken how much is going to cost well five bucks yeah because your brother Barry four bucks okay Hey listen I'll be back in a couple of days and you know what you do you walk away [Applause] God bless you my brother you're a blessing even despite what people say about you I think you're a blessing I don't need to stick around and Coach God or assist God in how he's going to fix the problem yeah I don't need to do that you know what God knows how to repair every problem you bring to him you don't need to hang around and say how's it going how's it going how's it going how's it going hey let God do his job let God Work It Out he'll work it out he knows what he's doing oh you say I'm Soul I'm so worried brother random I just don't know hey he said let off the pressure cast your cares on him for he cares for you don't you worry about your cares that's his business when you give it to God that's his business not your business anymore the devil likes to work on you and oppress you he said that's a trick of the devil to oppress you but when the Christian knows he's legal rights he can quote God's word and say I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee that takes all the oppression away and the clouds begin to clear back I think that's wonderful we all know Psalm 91 right and he that abideth in the dwelleth in the secret of the most high shall abide in the shadow of the almighty and I will say of the Lord this is what David says I will say of the Lord he's my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust and surely he will Deliver Me From The Snare which is a trap of the Fowler who's a center of traps and from the overwhelming pestilence and the noise and the all the commotion around me he will deliver me from that he will deliver me from the trap he'll deliver me from the center of traps he'll deliver me from all the commotion that that Center of traps tries to put in my pathway do you believe that tonight I will say of the Lord he's my refuge you better you better uh write that verse down put it on your fridge that's the most popular door in our house is the fridge and put it on that on that door and remind yourself that I will put my trust in him because he is my refuge and he's my Fortress he's my defense brother Graham said cry for your needs that's God's provided away didn't Jesus explain it when he uh when he said the unjust judge and the woman came and prayed day and night Martin Luther said uh this about that verse he said what you need to do is take the Canon of prayer and aim it at the Gates of Heaven and keep firing until somebody opens it up that's what you need to do and brother bam said you don't just kind of say well Lord how about this and then walk away he said no he said you want to keep presenting that in faith before God until you know God's got it and then you can have confidence let's go back to Psalm 91 that's the first thing you want to do you want to make sure you cast your cares upon Him and let off the pressure number two you want to remind yourself that God loves you and he's not forsaking you he cares about you Psalm 91 again this is now God responding and speaking to David thou shall tread upon the line and the adder and the Young Lion and the dragon thou shall trample under your feet because he has set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him because you're in the message because you're in this church because you went to Jeffersonville and got a handful of dirt no because you shook brother bram's hand no that's not it because he has set his love upon me I don't know why God loves me but he loves me and I'm amazed that he loves me I'm absolutely amazed that he loves me but he does he loves me and because he loves me therefore will I deliver him and that's the promise it's not because I get it all right it's not because I say all the right things it's that because I don't make any mistakes I do make mistakes every one of us makes mistakes here but that's not what God's looking at God does not look at your faults and failures God looks at your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and he said I set my love upon him therefore will I deliver him I'll set him on high because I know his name man bro I love the way brother bam says this there is a real power of the holy spirit that delivers delivers the sufferer from his suffering there is a real do you believe that there's a real power of the Holy Spirit I got news for you God never went out of the healing business when brother random died God is still a Healer God never stopped healing when brother mannum left the scene he's still a Healer isn't he he's the same yesterday today and forever whatever God could do he can still do God can still raise the dead God can take that habit away from you God can deliver you from drugs God can uh take away the spirit of lust out of your life God can do whatever God wants to do because he's the same and he does not have to have brother random standing here in flesh in order to accomplish it he just needs you to be a believer and believe the word and then you watch what God does there is a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the sufferer from his suffering Hallelujah oh we might as well do this is that all right everybody okay if you need a drink come on up I got a bottle of water here you can we can share that in your Bible Mark chapter 35 uh sorry Mark 4 35 38 it tells the story of all these Miracles and great things that happen in Israel in the days of Jesus many were brought to him that were healed the Pharisees contested to him he won the argument I mean it was just amazing there's all kinds of Miracles Supernatural things this is one of those chapters where it says that Jesus healed them all they all came but all manner of diseases and he healed them all and then he says to his disciples he said hey let's let's let's get in the boat let's go across that was not uncommon because this is where this happened I've been there we're going to Israel Lord willing in November if you want to go let me know and Jesus gets in the boat with the disciples and they launch out Under the Sea of Galilee and they move gently across the lake gently enough that Jesus falls asleep on the pillow and the disciples are rolling the boat and all of a sudden you know the winds come up and the the The Tempest Rises and Jesus is sound asleep in the back of the boat not worried at all I mean they're frantic they're they're panicking and uh Jesus is not worried at all oh I'll tell you what I just as a footnote I'd love to have the kind of a spirit that didn't fear in the middle of a storm I just I just like to have that and so they wake him up and they say hey Master uh do you don't you care that we perish and Jesus says hey hey you have little faith and he stands up on the brow of the boat and he speaks to it and as if they couldn't see anything greater than what they just saw on the other side of the lake now they're looking who is this man that speaks to the storm and so they get off on the other side and they walk and lo and behold are in the land of the gadarenes you go walk up the hill everybody except Jesus starts to slow down whoa we know where we are this is a place where there ain't no towns this is a place where there's no hotels this is the place where that guy lives yeah this is a place you don't wander into at night and everybody's slowing down except Jesus and all of a sudden he comes on this man as if they hadn't seen everything I mean as if they hadn't seen great Supernatural things he Encounters this man and you know the story Mark chapter 5 and and as you read through that chapter it says that this demon now the Demon's Legion speak to Jesus and they have this conversation going back and forth and and they cry out to him and say what does that'll do to do with us and so forth they cast them out and they said let us go on the swine and they go into swine they run down the hill and they all die the people of the Town come out and say hey that's our job that's our livelihood and they're actually trying to run them out imagine now the disciples looking at this and thinking wow another great miracle and they want to run Jesus out they want to kick us out I mean who knew and so the Bible says then in Mark chapter 5 and I'd like to I'd like to read it for you if that's all right Mark chapter five if you have your Bible I've spoiled you by putting everything on the screen here let's do this on the old-fashioned way Mark chapter 5 verse 15. and they came to Jesus and see him that was possessed with the Devil the people in the town hear about this and they run out there they're not in this place because nobody was in this place the sky was in this place and so they come out of the town and they run up to the scene and they're looking at this and they recognize that's the man who was crazy and you know where he is they see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid and they saw and then they they that saw told them how it befell on him and he was possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine they're telling the story here and they began to pray him to deliver uh deliver uh depart sorry out of their coasts and when he was coming to the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed that he might go with him this man when the people of the town I want you to notice now when the people of the Town come out they look around and here's this man dressed now normally he looks like a Believer and I mean he's acting normal and you know what he's doing is sitting at the feet of Jesus now I'd just like to say that and say this about that scripture verse that story that story tells us a lot of things but one of the things that I get from it is that you you in in the in the execution of the Gospel in in the way that Jesus lived his life he did two things here one was he did the supernatural extraordinary thing of casting the demon out of this person and bringing Deliverance to a man who could not deliver himself he was completely Bound by these demons and he could not rescue himself he could not he could not live a normal life and and Jesus did that and freed that man absolutely freed that man and let him go and those demons were gone in another place and and now he's not going to have to worry about them anymore he's free thank God he's free he's set free and that's the Supernatural part that God can do and I believe that God can still do that today but I believe this also that a real encounter with God will bring you to the feet of Jesus I say we need both you can't just say we're going to have the supernatural demon casting out kind of religion and that's it you know what when a person really gets delivered you know what they want to do they want to hang around with Jesus they want to hang they want to go wherever he goes they want to hey are you leaving I'm leaving too and where where are you going I'm going to go with you I don't want to be I don't want to be back here I want to be with you and and he was determined to go now with the Savior and to deliver that's what he was determined to do because that's what believers do they follow they follow him because sons of God are led by the spirit of God isn't that right so hey don't go somewhere me not go I want to go and Jesus said to him Hey listen don't follow me go back and tell your family and friends what happened to you and I believe the reason he said that was because the glory comes and following me comes after Calvary not before after Calvary after all of this is done then you can follow me and tell the world and go into all the world and preach the gospel but before the cross I've got to humble myself to all of this and die so there's no glory before the cross there's glory after the cross okay so stay here the other guy says all right if I have to I'll stay here so he says I'm going to go tell my father and so he goes back home and tells his father you can't have one side of this without the other side there's a place for deliverance there's a place for teaching there's a place for uh the supernatural phenomena but you know what it isn't just that and it isn't just teaching it's not this is not intellectualism this is not who's the smartest and can retain the most this is not what this is about this is about having a meeting with Jesus and learning all you can from Jesus does that make sense that's what I see in this Parable right here all right number three this is probably the most important thing I'm going to give you here Paul deals with this subject directly on and he says be careful for nothing in the Greek that language means the word careful means worry worry about nothing enough everybody say it nothing say it again nothing it's like sitting in a rocking chair and rocking all day you can work at it and put a lot of energy into it but you're not going to get anywhere he says be careful for nothing but and I love this this is what he says here's here's how we're going to do it instead of worrying and putting our energy into that we're going to do this in everything everybody say everything everything say it again everything by prayer by supplication supplication means asking and Thanksgiving see the three words there but by everything by prayer supplication and Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God so here's what you do when you have something that would cause ordinarily cause worry in your life then what you need to do is take that and by prayer and by asking God and asking God in the right way and with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God you don't need to put it on Facebook you don't need to tell everybody about it bring it to God is that all right bring it to God and bring it to God in the right way with prayer supplication and don't forget the Thanksgiving and verse 7 and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus oh I love this verse it gets me excited the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep that word keep there is a military term it is and it means to guard or Protect by a military guard either to prevent hostile Invasion or to keep the inhabitants in the city safe and to keep them from flight this is what this means here in other words when the peace of God moves in when you bring your request to God in the right way and you you the peace of God Moves In which is beyond our understanding because we really don't know how God's going to do this because we don't have an answer and we don't know anybody else who has an answer but somehow or another we believe God does have an answer and even though we don't understand it we're just going to trust that God does have an answer indeed but the peace of God is actually going to keep your heart it doesn't say that you're going to keep your heart and mind it doesn't say that the pastor is going to keep your heart and mind it doesn't even say that the whole church is going to Rally around you and keep your heart and mind God said I'll do this he said I'll keep your heart and mind and that military term there it means to build a Garrison it means to build a wall Protect by a military guard when the Cavalry moved out west in the old days you know what the first thing they did was when they're out in Indian Territory remember what they did they built a Fort a fort is a Garrison it is a defense against enemies that come in and it's against anybody wandering away and horses wandering away so we have protection when we have a fort I I want to reiterate again the holy spirit's not asking you to build a fort he's not asking you to defend yourself he's not asking you to build your defenses and make them really strong he's not asking you to build the best for it and then expand on it he's not doing that at all he said when you give it to me right I'll build a Ford I will surround you and I will keep your heart and mind through Christ Jesus he's making you that promise that he's going to do this wow in other words you kind of don't have to do anything that's right you don't have to do anything but don't forget the Thanksgiving you remember when Nehemiah was building the wall at the end of the book of Nehemiah it says and at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem this is at the time now when it's all built the windows and doors are all in everything is set and they're going to dedicate that back to God this is what he does they sought the Levites out of all the places in Israel that's what it means all the places to bring them to Jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness both with thanksgivings and seeings and singings with symbols sultries and harps verse 31 and I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall and appointed two great companies of them that give thanks one on the right hand side one on the left-hand side verse 40. so the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God and I and half of the rulers that were with me so in other words if we're going to have a dedication if we're going to have something related to walls we're going to have people that give thanks so he had all these two companies of Levites come in and they spread out along the wall and you know what they said thank you Lord for saving my soul and we give thanks and they they spent their whole time just thanking God thank you Lord for what you've done thank you for Nehemiah thank you for Ezra thank you Lord for restoring Jerusalem thank you Lord for setting us free from Babylon thank you for bringing us here and they just gave thanks gave thanks gave thanks that's all they did was just give thanks and Paul is saying and you need to take your requests make it known unto God with prayer supplication and Thanksgiving don't forget for Thanksgiving because if we understand it right Our God's already got an answer even before you go to them before you're able to mouth the prayers God's got an answer for you do you believe that and you ought to go to God and say Lord if thou not you should not go to God and say if thou can'tst you should say Lord I thank you for what you're going to do in this situation I don't know I'm not sure how you're going to get us out of this I'm not sure Lord how I could ever get back on the rails again but I'm thanking you because I know you can and I'm going to trust in you and I I'm going to put my my my whole trust in you Peter says we are kept by the power of God through faith under salvation ready to be revealed in the last day who are we kept by not your self-discipline not your perfect Stellar record not your works but we are kept by the power of God brother man I'm speaking to another lady he says now nervousness is a horrible thing keeps you torn up all the time because he said of course you were born nervous who are you going to blame in this case who do you want to lay the blame on for this sister it's born that way I'm just telling you what a prophet said how can we say to this sister you you probably are not born again because you're nervous you know what I Was Born This Way all your life you've been nervous I see you as a schoolgirl nervous and nothing can help it everybody says get next to yourself but that doesn't do any good and he said there's something that frightens you but Jesus Christ is here to take it away from you and any praise for her and he he asked God's Deliverance for her and then he says now I love what he says here he says now don't fear young lady do as I tell you will you do as I tell you now he says when you come up here there's a dark shadow around you but it's gone now you can't help that comes to you but look now that unclean spirit's gone from you and he walks in dry places he will try to return again but you just take my word as God's prophet don't you never here's here's what he says to her don't you never have a frown in your face sing all day long praise God and no matter what you no matter what you feel or what takes place it'll leave you and it won't come near you no more go and do that and believe with all your heart that's not complicated don't ever have a frown on your face sing all day praise God no matter how you feel what takes place and it'll leave you and it won't come no more you know what we need to do we need to spread our wings and Rise Up like bumblebees really you thought I was going to say Eagles all of you thought I was going to say Eagles I knew that I led you down the Garden Path I knew you thought I was going to say that where's Emma Emma can tell you the story here I did it in devotions and her online school it was an amazing physical truth about bumblebees I don't know if you're aware of it they can't fly aerodynamically their wings are way too small for their fat little bodies especially when they load up they load up with nectar they can't fly it is physically aerodynamically scientifically impossible for them to fly there are you can go online there are lots of studies that prove that bumblebees can't fly you can't flap fast enough you can flap often enough in order to to make a Bumblebee's body fly it they're just it's it doesn't work it just don't work I mean that's science and I'm not I'm not here to argue with that I mean that's true they've measured they've weighed they've done all the things they do they can't fly but you know what amazingly there's another thing about bumblebees that's really important here and that is that bumblebees can't read so they can't read the reports that are written about them that say they can fly so you know what they do they just go ahead and fly that's an amazing thing oh I mean it's a good read they could probably debate it right but they can't read so you know what all the reports in the world don't matter they just go ahead and do do what God made them to do they just spread their wings and fly and somehow or another it works don't let the devil tell you you can't fly don't let the devil tell you you can't lift off if you you just do what God tells you to do you just spread your wings and do what God told you to do God will get you there God knows exactly how to get you there don't worry about all the intellectuals that say well this is not going to happen that's not going to happen hey God knows exactly how to get you to where you need to be number four therefore I say unto you this is what Jesus said take no thought look at the birds of the air and look at they don't clothe themselves they don't feed themselves you know but but somebody's watching over them and they're only Birds and he said it's therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life and that word there means worry don't you fret about your life and what you shall eat and what you shall drink and not sure and and nor yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than the meat and the body the raiment behold the fowls of the air and so forth and are ye not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add one Cuba to a stature a cubitis from here this knuckle to your elbow and Jesus which one of you can go like and think hard enough and add yourself this much height some of you short people are saying I've tried some of you have tall people are saying I should have tried a little less but there's some in other words Jesus is saying there's some things you can't do and and when you come to those things you've got to leave them to God and and why take you thought for Raymond and consider the lilies of the field here he says you know what I'll tell you what in other words he's given us a great big good list of priorities here don't worry about this worry about this and you know what the thing he wants us to focus on seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added onto you put your energy into the right thing not the wrong thing don't don't take no thought for your life rather seek first the kingdom of God make that your priority make that the first thing and then you watch you watch what God does because it's not your business to worry about that's God's business when you give it to God and you drop your watch at the repair shop let me tell you it's God's business and he'll take care of it then and you really don't need to worry about it at all you need to be like the pilot who had the plane you still think I'm going towards Eagles don't you let me tell you a little story back in World War II the Germans kind of had the edge on the British for air defenses then they knew they both sides knew that air air power was going to tip the battle if you know anything about history this was a big big deal at the end of the war and the Germans were bombing London and all of the chaos and the death and the trouble that was caused by that it was a terrible thing and the British then put a lot of energy and money and time and brains into the development of certain planes that would be fast they could carry a pretty good sized payload they could get in get out quick and the pilots wouldn't have to ditch in the journey so they came up with this plane which was a very strategic piece of uh Machinery in the war is called a Spitfire and now they've developed other types of planes along this line and of course they have a more sophisticated type of plane now but this is a picture of a pilot who was doing a model or a uh a dry run of that plane they would make a prototype just the bare bones like steering wheel seat uh all the gears and pipes and fly-by-wire stuff everything was all exposed and and they would just bring it up and bring it down bring it up bring it down they wanted to see how it handled do we need more pitch more yaw more speed more height more oxygen whatever else and they test pilots who are crazy people they they were doing this with this plane this Pilot's up in the air and he's looking around at the plane he's sitting in his seat and he's looking around making sure everything's working okay that's his job he's looking around and watching the plane do you believe this story is going to make sense it's hang out hang on and the Pilots looking around he's flying away and he looks back and he sees a rat you didn't think I was going to say that he sees a wreck and the rat which is what rats do he's chewing on a cable the cable happens to be a hydraulic cable full of hydraulic fluid if the rat gets through the cable you know what's going to happen he's going to lose hydraulic fluid and he's not going to be able to steer the plane it's certain death for him and in an instant he's got to make a decision because he can't get out of the chair and go back and catch the rat the rat will run away and he'd be chasing the rat around the plane I mean he can't do that and he because he doesn't have autopilot on the plane so he's he sees the rat the rat is just you know very peacefully chewing on this pipe he's got to make a decision you know what he does this is a true story you know what he does he reaches over he takes his mask his oxygen mask and he puts it on and he takes the plane and he goes like this he goes High as he goes High the oxygen Thins he's looking back at the rat he's going straight up and the plane is not made to do that as far as he knows but he's going straight up it's getting colder and colder the oxygen is Getting Thinner and thinner and he looks back at that rat and he just goes foreign he had to make that decision fast what I'm telling you tonight is that when you get into a spot go high don't go low Gohan don't you worry about coming down here and trying to figure everything out and all that hey there are times when you don't have any other choice but to go high go high go quickly keep going until you reach that place where God actually does something there are many times we get into trouble because we're going low because we're not at the right place God wants us to be and when you find yourself in a spot like that don't think about it just go high go to God go to him and reach out to him and and and give that request to him with Thanksgiving and say Lord I'm coming to you you are my only hope you are my refuge and my strength here and I'm going to come to you [Applause] come to him and watch what he does come to him and throw your trust throw all of your cares upon him because he cares for you he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace is upon him by stripes we are healed amen how many believe this that he heals the Brokenhearted and he binds up their wounds their wounds are not physical their wounds are not stitchable their wounds are not removable like a doctor will take out bad tissue but somebody with a broken heart still needs healing somebody who has been betrayed somebody who has been mischaracterized and criticized let me tell you they know what a broken heart feels like some of you are not not all of you but some of you are not in your head because maybe you've experienced that I'm here to tell you tonight you're not alone if you have a broken heart God knows how to heal a broken heart and you need to understand and remember that you are not alone Somebody's Watching Over You somebody cares about you so does Delta Airlines I'm really throwing you guys for a loop here you didn't think I was going to say that appreciate your honesty I can always trust a man with a bow tie foreign let me tell you the story because sometimes you think you know you're all alone sometimes you think you're on your own and I mean those feelings very often are very real sometimes there are things that they happen not because you caused it but it's just that's where you are I feel like nobody cares I remember one time my wife and I were flying on Delta Airlines Delta Airlines treats me pretty good now I treat Delta Airlines pretty good too but they look after me and and uh I fly a lot with them and have Bunches of miles with them and and uh you know they uh they give me the the upgrades and the status and that kind of thing and I mean they just give it to me because I fly a lot and I do a lot of work in different parts of the world and I'm thankful for that you know because they've uh they've been been a help lots of times in tough situations and I appreciate that one day my wife and I were flying we're going somewhere we're going from Roanoke to Atlanta and then Atlanta overseas and uh we we knew we had a tight connection and uh all of a sudden someone sometimes the worst words you can hear on a plane are well folks when the pilot comes on and he says well folks he says we got a delay delays in Atlanta it's not here he says we got a problem and he says it's going to make us run kind of tight and he says but we're going to take off sins they give us clearance so just hang on and the time is clicking ticking ticking ticking and I'm looking at this and saying oh man we've got to make that connection because we're gonna be we're not going to make it overseas and the meetings and all the other things that were going to happen right you know it's all if you're late on the first one it's pretty bad if you're late on the last one is a different thing but if you're late in the first one it's a bad thing because everything's effective it's like it's called dominoes and so we're we're I'm looking at this I'm looking at my app and I'm seeing because normally when you're going to be late they say they come on the app in you know on themselves and they say we know Mr Coffee you're going to be delayed they'll they'll do that they'll say we know you're going to be delayed we have you booked on another flight don't worry when you get to the airport go to this gate instead of that gate they'll tell me that on my app is neat and I don't have to call them when you know fuss and complain I just they'll do that that's automatic so nothing shows up on my app nothing so we're late by the time we get to Atlanta and we touch down we have physically two or three minutes to make this connection okay they ain't no way ain't no way my wife says to me hey we can't run I said well even if we did even if we did run honey we got to take a train we got to go to another terminal there's six different stops on the train in Atlanta so you know uh there ain't no way there ain't no way and nothing's showing up on my app I told the stewardess I said hey uh we got a really super tight connection and she said well you can get off the plane first you know to try to do it I said but we only got two or three minutes we ain't gonna be able to do it and she said well the only thing I know to do is just go for it foreign now I'm a Type A okay what's so funny about that you relate you're a type A you're a type A plus that's what you are and a type a means that I almost quit school in grade two because they took recess you know I mean I I'm just I'm a busy guy I got lots to do and uh you know you can relate to this and so I'm I got my hands on my bags I got my hand one hand on my bag one hand on my wife and I'm saying all right honey when they open that door we're gone you just close your eyes and start to pray you pray I'll run I'll drag you through the airport now I'm I'm cocked and ready I mean I'm I don't want to I hate missing flights and I so I'm just you know there wasn't nobody in front of me there ain't nobody in front of me because I I work my way to the right

building tonight the presence from one another I want you to know that he's not left you tomorrow morning you might not feel the same way but your feeling has nothing to do with what God has spoke to you and what he's done in your life right here I tell you not only did God come and minister to the needs in our lives and show us just how much he cared just a little softer brother just a little softer just how much that he cares about every single need in our lives that to me is when I consider the expanse of this message and how that God took time and it wasn't that those were insignificant things I personally believe that God had those things recorded for you and I to know that we would stand here tonight and we would need to be reminded and to hear those things God came down not only in the ministry of the Prophet but as he came right here tonight and let that be known God is not a God who runs down his people that's not what that's not what he comes to do we're under a quickening power it comes to lift us it comes to Lift Us and I tell you I how much that God cares about us and I say for you as young people God knew you was going to be here even in this age God knew all the pressures all the situations and I think it's I think it's very fitting to understand that don't let the devil isolate you ever put you in a corner of well I felt this way I should have never felt this way God made that so clear tonight just like that door was open before we just dismissed the devil because that's not true we're still here we're in this flesh we walk but the thing that's different right now is you've been equipped tonight you've been equipped you've been equipped on all of those things and what to do even as we leave from this place tonight and listen [Music] I don't believe that shamgar thought how is this oxco going to do this I don't believe that I don't believe that Samson thought how is this Jawbone going to do this he didn't think it inspiration struck and he picked it up and he used it God has showed you tonight all of us tonight the ox code the Jawbone of the ass he showed us and we can take that and pick it up under the authority [Music] of the Lord Jesus Christ and you're his child cares about you won't you loving tonight hallelujah how Dominicans say I'm going out of here I'm going out different amen I'm going out different amen I didn't come to the house of God to stay the same because you never do you either go out worse or you get closer I'm going out closer tonight I know I've told this story a whole lot of times but you know when I went and the one car the first car I got that they had auto start on it I didn't know what that button was it was on the key fob I didn't know I just was getting a good deal on the car and I'm sitting there where you know drawing up all the papers and everything I'm feeling good about I got a good deal in this car and I know I did I do my research on that and I walk in there and I'm just looking at this button and I said hey what's this button right here at the top they got this little half circle what is that and the guy said let me see it I gave it to him he said come here a minute he walked over the window and he went beep beep brother Nathaniel as soon as I seen him lights I said oh my goodness it's got auto start I realized I didn't even know I was buying a car that had that I wanted that oh how that'll benefit me having the heat on and that you heard the story a lot those are you right here but that's how God comes tonight and shows us you've got this it's right here already this is what that button is this is what the promises that I've given you I've provided it for you now all you got to do is just push it it took my wife a little bit to get it she would say honey how you do that again so let me show you know I was a master at it now but why was that a master because somebody showed me Hallelujah I'll tell you what was preached here tonight was preached by experience is that right it's preached by experience amen how we thank God tonight amen let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer and I could we all together just just say thank you Lord I think let's approach as we're closing this service with a prayer of Thanksgiving and supplication Lord go with us and thank you for what you've done for us father how we want to say thank you tonight Lord throughout all of this building and I believe every Heart Lord you've spoke to us in such a personal way and I want to say thank you Lord for coming down and speaking to my heart thank you for
