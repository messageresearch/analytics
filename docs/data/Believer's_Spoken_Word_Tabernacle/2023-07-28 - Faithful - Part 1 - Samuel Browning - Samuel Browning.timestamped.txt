[37:16] I tried my best to get him
[37:19] uh to be here
[37:22] we certainly have enjoyed ourselves and
[37:25] then for the three services amen that
[37:28] brother Jerry Was Here amen and we just
[37:30] so appreciate amen the gift we
[37:33] appreciate brother Jerry's Ministry very
[37:35] much amen I always look at that that you
[37:38] know every gift that has a life is
[37:40] surrendered to the Lord you know and how
[37:41] God comes through and uses that we're
[37:44] the benefactors of that we benefit and
[37:47] you know that's I think it's so fitting
[37:49] of how that God just works through a
[37:51] great bouquet and many different gifts
[37:54] and lives and it's also what's around
[37:55] the gift how God so makes up the man and
[37:58] the wisdom and the experiences and
[38:00] that's one thing I always pray when I
[38:02] when as a person stands here that you
[38:05] know that God would take the experiences
[38:08] many times I'll pray it in the office
[38:09] take the experiences that they've been
[38:11] through and let them just come forth the
[38:14] Lord God because we benefit from that
[38:16] and you say Amen we benefit from from
[38:19] that and we're just so so thankful to
[38:22] the Lord and we're just looking forward
[38:24] to what the Lord will do for us here uh
[38:27] remember Sunday evening brother Ronnie
[38:29] will be coming up to minister in the the
[38:32] youth service here on Sunday evening at
[38:35] five at five PM all or welcome and uh we
[38:39] certainly I certainly have enjoyed amen
[38:41] those Services very much
[38:44] we would just I just recently had
[38:46] traveled over to Brother Paul's to hear
[38:48] brother Danny steaman on a youth service
[38:50] and my goodness I was so blessed I was
[38:52] in I was so strengthened and encouraged
[38:54] and the word of God is is without age
[38:57] you know it just really depends on our
[38:59] hearts on how that we you know receive
[39:02] it and apply it and so we just thank God
[39:04] for that I also want you to remember
[39:07] um
[39:07] uh there's a few different requests but
[39:10] for brother Nathan Bryant his mom went
[39:14] home to be with the Lord uh just the the
[39:17] other morning and uh it was actually
[39:19] Monday morning and so
[39:22] um it was Monday morning is that right
[39:24] honey I think so it was at the beginning
[39:26] of the week so we want to remember them
[39:28] in prayer my days are kind of mixed up
[39:30] there but and it was at the beginning we
[39:33] want to just keep them in prayer that
[39:34] the Lord will just Comfort them during
[39:36] this time and certainly like brother
[39:38] Nathan had said you know she's not in
[39:40] any pain anymore because the pain had
[39:42] got so great in Her Bones from the
[39:45] cancer so we just thank God because
[39:48] she's standing in a perfect body now no
[39:51] pain and she's in in perfect victory
[39:53] over there so
[39:55] we just thank God for that amen let's
[39:58] look here in the word of the Lord
[39:59] tonight
[40:01] amen verse 8 just a few verses of
[40:03] scripture where we've been drawing from
[40:05] and we'll just read this and let you be
[40:08] seated verse 8. behold
[40:11] I go forward but he is not there and
[40:15] backward but I cannot perceive him on
[40:19] the left hand where he does work
[40:21] but I cannot Behold Him he hideth
[40:24] himself on the right hand that I cannot
[40:27] see him
[40:28] how many have been there
[40:30] I've never been there probably maybe you
[40:32] know as you've been serving the lord any
[40:34] length of time you've come into these
[40:36] moments where it seems like you don't
[40:38] feel you don't feel God's presence you
[40:40] haven't heard from him you start
[40:42] examining your life is there anything
[40:44] that's out of out of out of cater but
[40:47] I'll say this to you just to put the
[40:50] devil on notice God don't hide anything
[40:52] from us
[40:54] if there's something that's out of order
[40:56] God makes that known to us
[40:59] is that right so we can just dismiss the
[41:03] enemy's criticism
[41:04] because the enemy is always there to
[41:06] accuse well you've done something you've
[41:08] done this you've done that but remember
[41:09] the Bible said if our heart condemns us
[41:12] not
[41:13] is that right God is greater than our
[41:15] heart so we can just we're able to stand
[41:18] there then like job though we haven't
[41:21] heard from him though we do not sense
[41:23] his presence but we know I'm standing on
[41:26] the word of God
[41:29] but he knoweth verse 10 the way that I
[41:32] take when he hath tried me I shall come
[41:36] forth as gold
[41:38] my foot hath held his steps his way have
[41:43] I kept and not declined neither have I
[41:48] gone back from the Commandment of his
[41:50] lips I have esteemed the words of his
[41:54] mouth more than my necessary food
[42:00] amen Amen Let me just read to you a
[42:04] quote if I could before you're seated if
[42:06] that's all right out of three kinds of
[42:08] Believers and I want to draw from this
[42:10] sometimes Believers are put to the test
[42:13] where the Bible says not sometimes every
[42:16] time for every son that cometh to God
[42:18] must be chastened try child trained and
[42:22] remember the trials the dusty roads the
[42:26] hot son of persecution but the Loyalty
[42:29] of your heart beats that material till
[42:33] she's ready to go into the mold
[42:37] God's children is made up correctly on
[42:40] his word for they are living examples
[42:42] and the word of God living through them
[42:45] how many want to be a living example
[42:49] the trial comes to shaking to put you to
[42:53] the very bottom
[42:54] to see where you'll stand
[42:56] they tested they try every son that
[43:00] cometh to God
[43:01] I'd just like to speak on one word here
[43:04] tonight and begin on that and that's the
[43:06] simple word of faithful
[43:09] faithful may God bless you bless the
[43:11] reading of the word as you're being
[43:12] seated
[43:15] I look here in this message on three
[43:19] kinds of Believers and
[43:21] those of you as you listen to this and
[43:24] there's messages that you know as I go
[43:26] through at different times as the Holy
[43:28] Spirit are just Inspire and I just keep
[43:30] going through and listening over and
[43:31] over and over
[43:33] but you know when you come through this
[43:34] on three kinds of Believers that
[43:37] brother Branham is dealing very heavily
[43:40] and very much so even when tests and
[43:43] trials we are Tried by the word of God
[43:45] we are there is tests that comes our way
[43:48] there's trials that come our way and
[43:50] we're we're we're tested on where we're
[43:54] going to stand and this is where it
[43:56] comes into every one of the categories
[43:58] that are all around remember there were
[44:00] many that followed Jesus at first but
[44:03] then when he said except you eat the
[44:05] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[44:07] blood you can have no life in you and
[44:10] there were many that were offended at
[44:12] him and they walked away
[44:15] they were walking with him many as it
[44:17] says in the beginning of that scripture
[44:19] in John 6 they believed but yet that
[44:22] belief itself it came to an end and here
[44:26] we find that what ended up taking place
[44:28] out of all of that is they walked away
[44:31] but then you had Judas and Judas stayed
[44:34] on to almost to the very end but I want
[44:37] you to understand this just so you can
[44:39] also put the devil on notice because
[44:41] when Satan wants to come and tell you
[44:43] that you're a Judas you're able to
[44:46] discern his voice by knowing what's in
[44:49] your heart the ground that you and I
[44:51] stand on is the word of God it's not
[44:53] emotion it's not our feelings it's not
[44:56] any gift it is upon the word of God
[44:58] that's been established in our heart and
[45:01] Judas remember as the prophet in this
[45:03] message goes over and over again Judas
[45:07] was looking for a loophole the whole
[45:10] time what's a loophole a way out a
[45:13] reason or excuse that will justify what
[45:17] was always any
[45:18] but you see the rest of them as they
[45:21] stood there well you know they weren't
[45:23] you know maybe in the Who's Who and
[45:25] couldn't read their name on a boxcar but
[45:27] there was something about it that they
[45:29] they knew what was behind that veil of
[45:32] Flesh that was standing there it came
[45:34] out of Peter's heart Thou Art the Christ
[45:36] the son of the Living God and though the
[45:40] rest of them that when we looked at
[45:42] where they stood as Believers that even
[45:44] coming to that place where Judas went
[45:47] off yet the rest of them they walked on
[45:50] with the Lord even even when the
[45:53] crucifixion had happened I want you to
[45:55] understand this as Believers we could
[45:58] look back and you see when that happened
[46:00] it didn't happen according to their
[46:02] thinking and they then begin to go back
[46:05] to fishing and going back to those those
[46:08] things of occupying of life from where
[46:11] the word had come and called them from
[46:13] but just because they couldn't
[46:14] understand the event was that was taking
[46:17] place and they had walked that way did
[46:20] not dismantle them from being Believers
[46:23] but the word himself went as the
[46:26] faithful Shepherd and gathered the
[46:29] Believers by revealing his word that he
[46:33] had fulfilled they were not they were
[46:36] not going to be convinced by anything
[46:38] else it had to be him who is the word
[46:40] and he's the one that where the word is
[46:43] fulfilled it gathered them into that
[46:45] place to where that now they could be
[46:48] United with him in a union to where it
[46:51] was not just a fellowship walking down
[46:54] the road together but now through the
[46:56] sacrifice he had made a way that they
[46:59] could be united through and by the new
[47:02] birth where his own Spirit his own life
[47:04] could live in them and that's why he
[47:06] could say because I live you can live
[47:09] also you shall live also so I want to
[47:12] just take that thought on the Loyalty in
[47:15] looking at this in this uh uh a quote
[47:18] right here out of three kinds of
[47:20] Believers if you can back up Brianna to
[47:22] that place there where it says the
[47:24] Loyalty of your heart is what beats that
[47:28] material till she's ready to go into the
[47:30] mold now I want you to notice no there's
[47:32] nothing in this life that we're going to
[47:35] take with us outside of our character
[47:38] every bit of money if you have any your
[47:42] homes whatever all of that you say well
[47:45] I have children and this and that but
[47:46] the only thing that you and I take with
[47:48] us is our character that's when it comes
[47:52] down to everything it's our character
[47:55] and character itself is not something
[47:59] that is gifted that something that is
[48:01] just uh uh uh that we earn but remember
[48:04] the holy spirit is the gift of God that
[48:08] is given to you and I as we come God's
[48:11] provided way and through that life
[48:13] within us that's what molds our
[48:17] character that's what shapes us that's
[48:20] what molds our lives and then his life
[48:23] in us it's the Loyalty of our heart that
[48:28] beats the material soul in the midst of
[48:31] tests and trials and day to day and I I
[48:34] tell you we we we live by faith every
[48:38] single day in our life and it is living
[48:41] when because faith is not our feelings
[48:43] there's days you feel like a Christian
[48:45] and there's days you don't feel like a
[48:47] Christian there's days you feel
[48:48] Victorious and there's days you don't
[48:50] feel Victorious but faith is their
[48:53] constant regardless
[48:55] [Music]
[48:57] and I think that's where we can live
[48:59] from that because to stand with the
[49:01] Loyalty from our heart that actually
[49:04] will beat the character because the
[49:06] character is who we really are that's
[49:10] what we really are and so notice it's
[49:12] that that's beating that because there's
[49:14] a mold you see in our lives when that
[49:18] character is is leaves this body when
[49:21] that Soul there is there that theophany
[49:24] that's there in the heavenlies that body
[49:26] that Paul speaks of Peter speaks of
[49:29] that's reserved preserved in the heavens
[49:31] that garment that we're to be clothed
[49:34] upon and then as we enter into that
[49:37] those that's gone on by the way of the
[49:39] Grave they've already entered into their
[49:42] theophany and they will come back at the
[49:44] Rapture with their theophany and pick up
[49:47] a glorified body and we who are alive
[49:49] and remain will take our glorified body
[49:52] and meet our theophany so it just goes
[49:55] to show you that within this that we
[49:58] have two Realms of us that we have to
[50:01] battle through two Realms of us that
[50:04] flesh and that spirit that constantly
[50:07] wants to suppress and wants to keep us
[50:10] trapped and housed in but loyalty of our
[50:14] heart beats the material the character
[50:17] and what is character character is a
[50:21] victory
[50:23] it is a victory and we see that through
[50:25] the life of the Lord Jesus in order for
[50:28] that character of his own life to come
[50:31] through us it took him surrendering his
[50:33] will completely and laying aside and
[50:38] dying for you and I
[50:39] that you and I could be benefactors and
[50:42] partakers of that life when did he read
[50:45] then they looked at when he received
[50:47] power for he said afterwards he said all
[50:50] power in Heaven and Earth is given to me
[50:52] oh why you see the world and the way the
[50:55] world is set up it's a gang gang gang
[50:58] but the way of real true reality is
[51:02] through a life of submission that lets
[51:05] Christ himself reign in our lives that's
[51:08] where real power is gained
[51:12] not in all that we can do but it's what
[51:15] we can submit ourselves to
[51:20] so when we look at this word loyalty and
[51:24] here and I'm I'm speaking on faithful
[51:26] and that's where this is derived from
[51:28] and to be loyal or loyalty it's a
[51:31] quality of being loyal I'm just going to
[51:33] refer to a few words as we listen and
[51:35] there's no doubt many words that flood
[51:38] your mind when we think of loyal or
[51:40] loyalty such as Allegiance or
[51:42] faithfulness and adherence devotion
[51:46] steadfastness uh true heartedness a
[51:49] dedication
[51:51] and to be loyal means giving or showing
[51:54] firm and constant support or allegiance
[51:58] to a person or an institution it can be
[52:01] described also as faithful true
[52:04] true-hearted tried and true true blue a
[52:08] lot of these terms we've heard right
[52:10] devoted constant steadfast staunch
[52:14] Dependable reliable trusted trustworthy
[52:18] trusty dutiful unchanging unwavering
[52:21] unswerving dedicated committed firm
[52:25] stable steady and unfailing I I just say
[52:28] it in this way loyalty itself and and
[52:32] that of faithful is something that is
[52:35] within a life and it beca it comes out
[52:39] through actions and through our works
[52:42] remember brother Banner when he went uh
[52:45] he was collecting power uh bills money
[52:48] and he walked up to this uh when he had
[52:51] to collect you know for the power
[52:52] company he walked up to the door and he
[52:54] knocked on that door and here this
[52:56] little this little um a little little
[52:58] woman came to the door and brother Ram
[53:00] says she was dress so you know scandily
[53:03] and things like that he just had to you
[53:04] know kind of turn his head and and here
[53:06] she is you know she he asked her he said
[53:09] hey he says I you know I'm here to
[53:10] collect the money and she said Okay and
[53:12] she goes dancing across the floor
[53:13] because she had some tunes playing there
[53:16] and there was this uh announcement that
[53:19] came across on those tunes and said be
[53:22] sure that the dance is on Saturday night
[53:24] and so forth and and they will be there
[53:26] and she said and brother Ram says she
[53:29] blew a kiss like to that radio or to
[53:31] that announcement and said I'll be there
[53:33] and she handed brother Branham the money
[53:35] and brother Branham paralleled it with
[53:37] uh a brother named brother Brown who was
[53:41] a pastor at another church and that
[53:43] brother had talked about making pledges
[53:45] for people to come to church so many
[53:48] days and so many weeks out of the Year
[53:50] and that brother said well I've got you
[53:52] know I've got them to where they'll come
[53:53] about half the time or whatever more and
[53:55] brother Brian said you see he says what
[53:57] it is he says with her he says that
[54:00] woman he said she was going to be at
[54:02] that dance no matter what it took he
[54:04] said if she'd have had to pawn her
[54:07] clothes she was gonna be there
[54:10] why she was dedicated loyal faithful to
[54:17] what she loved
[54:20] you see whatever is first whatever is
[54:24] priority will always show itself
[54:27] and we're talking about actions we're
[54:30] talking about that which comes out of
[54:32] our life it always will declare itself
[54:36] and so I think if there's one thing that
[54:38] we want our testimony to be is we want
[54:41] to have a testimony that we've lived a
[54:44] life that is loyal to the word of the
[54:48] Living God at all cost no matter what it
[54:51] costs me I want to live true to the word
[54:54] of God
[54:55] I don't want to just in my heart say
[54:57] well you know I I wouldn't do anything
[54:59] against the Lord but I want my life to
[55:01] testify that's a Christian I want my
[55:04] life to be a witness that says there's a
[55:07] Believer Our Lives to be a witness to
[55:10] get that one could say there goes a
[55:13] faithful Christian
[55:16] that's my desire
[55:18] now let's look here we're just going to
[55:20] take a little bit of a study and just
[55:22] kind of start into it a little bit
[55:23] tonight upon this word of faithful these
[55:25] are some things that you know for some
[55:27] time that just had upon my heart and
[55:29] looking at this part of it in the
[55:31] scripture in job's life and as we look
[55:34] at that in job 11 job 23 11. my foot now
[55:38] I want you to remember this this is
[55:40] Job's testimony
[55:43] job has refuted all the accusations all
[55:47] the way through
[55:49] you know why he's not going to give
[55:51] Satan's word one place in his life
[55:54] because he knows where he's standing
[55:58] that's where Joe knows he's standing job
[56:00] is remember God said he was a perfect
[56:03] man it wasn't that job was a man free of
[56:05] mistakes it wasn't that job was a man
[56:08] that didn't have to confess his sin but
[56:11] what he was looking at is job was
[56:13] standing perfect because his confession
[56:17] was in the sacrifice and that's what God
[56:22] is looking at
[56:25] so job's testimony this is over and over
[56:28] his testimony and I think if we can take
[56:31] an example from here right now when the
[56:34] enemy wants to come and try to run you
[56:36] down don't be a dart board
[56:41] say God help me I don't want to be a
[56:43] dart board no more I don't want to sit
[56:45] there and listen to it and take it to it
[56:47] like we heard last Thursday night listen
[56:49] we're veiled here within these Badger
[56:51] skins that's no excuse but to understand
[56:53] when there is something's wrong and
[56:55] you've confessed that you are standing
[56:58] there in the blood of Jesus Christ your
[57:01] confession is in him
[57:06] is that right
[57:07] so now job's testimony it ought to be
[57:10] able to stand there no I am standing in
[57:13] his righteousness this is Job's
[57:16] testimony when his faithfulness this is
[57:18] what's being brought into question job's
[57:20] faithfulness
[57:22] it's brought into question by church
[57:24] members verse 11 my foot hath held his
[57:28] steps his way have I kept and not
[57:32] declined neither have I gone back from
[57:35] the Commandment of his lips Joe knew him
[57:39] he's a person
[57:40] I've heard from him I've talked to him
[57:43] amen and look at this I love this I have
[57:47] esteemed the words of his mouth more
[57:51] than my necessary food we can put that
[57:53] down it's not just talking about your
[57:55] favorite flavor of Cheetos it's talking
[57:58] about you have esteemed his word more
[58:02] than anything else that you could rely
[58:05] on
[58:05] [Music]
[58:07] you have esteemed his word Above All
[58:11] Things else well brother Samuel asked
[58:13] him his word there's times this word
[58:14] comes and points out wrong in my life I
[58:16] esteem his word above everything else I
[58:21] say let every man's word be a lie and
[58:25] let God's word be true
[58:28] oh my this is why brother Graham could
[58:31] go on to say in that message three kinds
[58:33] of Believers he said Al jobet said whom
[58:36] I shall see for myself my eyes Shall
[58:38] Behold Him and not another he was a
[58:41] believer in Trials he was a believer in
[58:45] persecution he was a Believer he was a
[58:49] genuine believer
[58:52] amen I tell you gold is gold is gold no
[58:56] matter what it's in you could put gold
[58:58] in the dirt it's still gold the dirt
[58:59] don't change it amen you put a believer
[59:02] in the test or trial good day by day
[59:04] they're still a Believer now and that
[59:06] don't mean that in your spirit you may
[59:08] not get down are you understanding me
[59:10] but I'm telling you there's something
[59:12] that is holding you and I that's greater
[59:15] than any resolution of our mind
[59:17] when we're talking about faithful we're
[59:20] not talking about our own strength we're
[59:23] talking about his strength in you and I
[59:26] and I'm drawing from that strength in my
[59:29] life
[59:30] so faithful is that which means to
[59:34] remain loyal and steadfast to be
[59:37] reliable
[59:39] true to the facts or the original
[59:41] that's what I want
[59:43] I want to be known as a reliable
[59:46] Christian I don't want to be known as
[59:48] well you can't count on him you don't
[59:49] know you never know I don't want to be
[59:51] known as that I want to be known as a
[59:53] faithful Christian I'm not trying to
[59:55] work things on my own but I realize he
[59:58] stood for me he stood for me he was
[1:00:01] faithful to make a way that I could live
[1:00:04] and walk in Victory he stood there
[1:00:07] faithfully and took those Crown of
[1:00:09] Thorns he Faithfully took every weapon
[1:00:12] for me he born my transgressions he bore
[1:00:16] my shape he stood there Faithfully from
[1:00:18] me the least that I can do is stand
[1:00:21] faithful to him and to his word
[1:00:27] um
[1:00:27] so let's look at how this is faithful
[1:00:29] and I want you to as we go through this
[1:00:31] in the scripture here I want you to see
[1:00:33] how much that God looks upon this and
[1:00:36] God respects faithfulness
[1:00:39] it is things that God God will look upon
[1:00:43] in our life and God values faithfulness
[1:00:46] why let's look the very first scripture
[1:00:49] First Corinthians first chapter 1 verse
[1:00:52] 9 God
[1:00:54] is faithful how many thankful for that
[1:00:57] I'm grateful you're not we're not
[1:00:59] sitting here tonight well I don't know
[1:01:00] if he's God or not and I don't know if
[1:01:02] he'll keep his word but God is faithful
[1:01:04] he still gives the Holy Ghost he still
[1:01:07] heals the sin he still delivers the
[1:01:10] captives God is faithful
[1:01:13] so this is not a man-made quality a man
[1:01:18] can be faithful to an organization
[1:01:20] faithful to a teaching but what matters
[1:01:23] is are we faithful to the word of God
[1:01:27] God is faithful by whom you were called
[1:01:30] unto the fellowship of his son Jesus
[1:01:33] Christ Our Lord now notice this in
[1:01:36] Deuteronomy 7 9 know therefore that the
[1:01:39] Lord thy God he is God
[1:01:42] the faithful God
[1:01:46] Glory so what we're striving for it's
[1:01:49] not it's not something that is of man
[1:01:51] this is a Godly quality now remember
[1:01:55] like anything else Satan can pervert
[1:01:58] things Satan can get in there and can
[1:02:01] Satan can cause faith on this look
[1:02:02] listen you've got people that will
[1:02:04] absolutely sacrifice their family do
[1:02:07] everything else to go to a ball game
[1:02:09] over there in Cleveland they'll
[1:02:11] sacrifice finances because you know it
[1:02:13] ain't cheap they'll go over there
[1:02:15] they'll sacrifice everything they will
[1:02:17] go there even in the cold some of them
[1:02:20] will sit there get so intoxicated with
[1:02:23] things and they will sit there with
[1:02:25] paint on you know why they are loyal you
[1:02:28] know being Cleveland fans they got to be
[1:02:30] loyal with all the loosen that takes
[1:02:32] place there's a lot of loyalty notice
[1:02:34] through thick and thin
[1:02:37] are you hearing me now it's loyalty you
[1:02:40] take it that look there are people
[1:02:42] listen friends there are people that
[1:02:44] will not give their family the time of
[1:02:46] day but they're loyal to a boss they're
[1:02:49] loyal to their job they're faithful to
[1:02:51] their job but they will not be thankful
[1:02:54] to their family well I don't run around
[1:02:56] on my wife I don't run around on my
[1:02:58] husband I don't do this but are you
[1:03:00] Faithful the Bible said he that does not
[1:03:02] provide for his household is worse than
[1:03:05] an Infidel your household needs more
[1:03:08] than just shelter food and clothing they
[1:03:11] need your emotional support
[1:03:14] they need your time they need your
[1:03:18] investment
[1:03:19] because let me tell you something the
[1:03:21] world is investing in your children
[1:03:24] everything all of these things of
[1:03:26] YouTube and everything else they are
[1:03:29] investing to try to strip down
[1:03:33] I say God it's time for us to step it up
[1:03:36] we cannot be complacent we have got to
[1:03:39] be faithful
[1:03:41] this is what I want to be faithful
[1:03:44] notice know therefore that the Lord thy
[1:03:46] God he is God the faithful God which
[1:03:51] keepeth now watch this which keepeth
[1:03:53] Covenant and mercy with them that love
[1:03:57] him and keep his Commandments to a
[1:04:00] thousand Generations
[1:04:03] and repayeth them that hate him to their
[1:04:06] face to destroy them he will not be
[1:04:10] slacked to them that hateth him he will
[1:04:12] repay him to his face
[1:04:15] now you know it might seem all but a
[1:04:17] person could actually carry the Bible
[1:04:19] and actually hate God but it's true this
[1:04:23] age we are living in that age where they
[1:04:26] have put Christ out of the church it's
[1:04:29] just like I told I told as a pastor some
[1:04:31] years ago you know when he spoke to me
[1:04:34] and he was you know making his departure
[1:04:36] from the message I told him I said the
[1:04:38] rest of these guys that you claimed to
[1:04:40] say that they believed their Bible I
[1:04:42] said they're Liars they don't believe
[1:04:44] their Bible because how can you believe
[1:04:47] the Bible and deny the Living God who
[1:04:50] has inspired all the prophets down
[1:04:53] through the word you cannot believe your
[1:04:55] Bible and deny the Living God the
[1:04:58] Pharisees and Sadducees they have the
[1:05:01] law the writings the prophets all of
[1:05:03] those things but they called him the
[1:05:06] Living Word and he said Moses wrote Of
[1:05:09] Me search the scriptures they testify of
[1:05:13] me
[1:05:14] foreign
[1:05:16] but they denied him
[1:05:20] but God is faithful nonetheless
[1:05:23] so I you know what I like that part he
[1:05:26] keepeth Covenant and mercy with them
[1:05:27] that love him
[1:05:29] I love him
[1:05:31] I don't say but I'm perfect but I love
[1:05:33] him
[1:05:34] my heart's desire is to please him
[1:05:36] that's why when he corrects me my
[1:05:38] heart's desire to say forgive me Lord
[1:05:40] I'm wrong when he shows me something I
[1:05:43] need to be doing and I'm not help me
[1:05:45] Lord forgive me Lord why what is it
[1:05:48] because of Desire within my heart is to
[1:05:51] please him
[1:05:55] that's what desire in your heart is it
[1:05:57] not as a Believer that's our desire
[1:05:59] that's what the coming of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:01] does is to bring that reality forth in
[1:06:04] our lives now notice Thou shalt now
[1:06:06] notice this upon us as Believers Thou
[1:06:10] shalt therefore keep the Commandments
[1:06:12] and the statutes and the judgments which
[1:06:15] I command thee this day to do them so
[1:06:18] just as much as God is faithful God
[1:06:22] requires faithfulness from you and I
[1:06:25] is that right imagine that that we that
[1:06:28] there was nobody faithful here in this
[1:06:30] assembly
[1:06:31] imagine if myself I wasn't even faithful
[1:06:34] now maybe I could come and stand here
[1:06:36] and preach all the time but yet really
[1:06:37] not be faithful
[1:06:39] one would imagine that maybe I'm not
[1:06:41] here
[1:06:42] you know once in a while I'd say you
[1:06:44] know what let's just you know what
[1:06:45] everybody just stay home tonight it is
[1:06:47] such a beautiful night outside you know
[1:06:49] I think I'm gonna do we're just gonna
[1:06:50] stream from my patio because it's
[1:06:53] beautiful outside tonight I think I
[1:06:54] might have a nice fire in the background
[1:06:56] y'all just stay home on your computer
[1:06:57] stream and we're going to do it that way
[1:06:59] you would look at me and say that's not
[1:07:01] according to the word of God
[1:07:04] eventually you should you'd be hunting
[1:07:06] yourself another pastor
[1:07:08] right because why faithfulness is what
[1:07:12] God requires but it's not faithfulness
[1:07:15] listen to me now not faithfulness out of
[1:07:18] a slave like mentality but it is
[1:07:21] faithfulness according to his word how
[1:07:23] do I be faithful to God be faithful to
[1:07:26] all that he has revealed to you
[1:07:29] all that he's revealed to you if you'll
[1:07:33] be faithful to that you watch God work
[1:07:35] in your life and reveal more
[1:07:40] oh my now look look at Moses life here
[1:07:43] for a moment numbers 12 and verse 6. now
[1:07:46] remember this is when the controversy or
[1:07:49] questioning arose because because Moses
[1:07:52] had married an Ethiopian and now here's
[1:07:54] Miriam and and Aaron remember they had
[1:07:57] brought up and you know spoken Wellness
[1:07:59] Moses the only one the word the Lord
[1:08:00] speaks to because they could not
[1:08:03] understand what Moses had done they were
[1:08:06] questioning God's servant
[1:08:09] now watch this he said this is what God
[1:08:12] Said concerning them here now my words
[1:08:14] if there be a prophet among you I the
[1:08:17] Lord will make myself known unto him in
[1:08:18] a vision and will speak unto him in a
[1:08:21] dream my servant Moses is not so who is
[1:08:26] faithful in all my house oh my look at
[1:08:29] this him will I speak mouth to mouth
[1:08:31] even apparently and not in dark speeches
[1:08:34] and the similitude of the Lord shall he
[1:08:37] behold wherefore then were you not
[1:08:39] afraid to speak against my servant Moses
[1:08:43] I'll tell you if there's one thing we
[1:08:45] can be called that's the highest calling
[1:08:46] and that is his servant I want to be his
[1:08:49] servant you know I want to be I want God
[1:08:51] this is what a high thing for God to say
[1:08:54] God calls him out and says Moses who is
[1:08:57] my faithful servant in all mine house
[1:09:01] now what is what is God looking at here
[1:09:05] think of it as Paul will go into this I
[1:09:08] want to go into it but let me just read
[1:09:09] it out of Hebrews 3 Paul picks this up
[1:09:11] in Hebrews 3 verse 1 wherefore holy
[1:09:15] Brethren partakers of the Holy Heavenly
[1:09:17] calling consider the Apostle and high
[1:09:19] priest of your profession Christ Jesus
[1:09:22] who was faithful to him that appointed
[1:09:25] him
[1:09:27] did he not have to wrestle it out
[1:09:30] hello did he not have to wrestle it out
[1:09:32] all the way up to the end remember what
[1:09:35] took place at the end he could say for
[1:09:37] this purpose
[1:09:38] I've come
[1:09:42] for this purpose see our purpose is not
[1:09:44] fulfilled and then God just allows us to
[1:09:46] linger on and on and on and on but once
[1:09:49] the purpose has been fulfilled
[1:09:52] then our life we go
[1:09:54] same thing with the purpose the purpose
[1:09:56] of God's word in our lives for those
[1:09:58] that are alive those of us alive and
[1:10:00] remain unto the coming of the Lord is
[1:10:02] that right the purpose of God is to be
[1:10:05] achieved and fulfilled no he was
[1:10:07] faithful to him that appointed him as
[1:10:10] also Moses was faithful in all his house
[1:10:13] now watch how this faithfulness in all
[1:10:15] his house for this man was counted
[1:10:18] worthy of more Glory than Moses inasmuch
[1:10:21] as he who hath building the house hath
[1:10:23] more honor than the house for every
[1:10:26] house is builded by some man but he that
[1:10:29] built all things is God and Moses verily
[1:10:32] was faithful in all his house as a
[1:10:37] servant for a testimony of those things
[1:10:40] which were to be spoken after so when
[1:10:43] Moses think of it when here was Moses
[1:10:46] when here he is caught up into that
[1:10:48] cloud in there there and God begins to
[1:10:51] show him there of that which is there
[1:10:53] within the heaven and he begins to
[1:10:55] unfold to him the mystery of his
[1:10:58] Dwelling Place Moses comes back down
[1:11:01] from there and we know that there is you
[1:11:03] know the sin that entered the camp and
[1:11:04] you know he had to go back up and
[1:11:06] receive from God in the mercy of God to
[1:11:09] come back down and deal with the people
[1:11:10] but to think of it there were so many
[1:11:12] details that was there in that house
[1:11:15] there was details where God think of it
[1:11:17] to where that Supernatural in Moses was
[1:11:20] caught up to seed all of the parts see
[1:11:23] all of the courts and and see all of
[1:11:25] that within the heavens and he every
[1:11:27] little detail and God gave him all of
[1:11:31] this by Revelation and here he is to
[1:11:33] come back down to earth and begin to
[1:11:36] speak that Vision now to think about it
[1:11:39] here as Moses is staying true to that
[1:11:41] Vision there's some names that were
[1:11:43] mentioned in that Vision whom God said I
[1:11:46] have spilled filled them with the spirit
[1:11:48] of wisdom Moses would begin to speak in
[1:11:51] regards to the patterns the little every
[1:11:53] little thing that went into the
[1:11:55] Tabernacle you know all of that really
[1:11:57] spoke of not just of Christ but it
[1:11:59] speaks of Christ in you and I because we
[1:12:02] are his dwelling place we are the
[1:12:05] Tabernacle of the Lord right as
[1:12:07] individual Tabernacles and collectively
[1:12:10] has stones that have been hewn out by
[1:12:13] the spirit of God to come together as
[1:12:16] part of the entire body now think of it
[1:12:18] here Moses stood faithful I wonder how
[1:12:21] many times that you know like you and I
[1:12:23] we can start on a project and we get to
[1:12:25] look here and say you know what I'll cut
[1:12:27] a little corner right here I think I got
[1:12:29] enough paint to finish this I don't need
[1:12:31] to run over Sherwin-Williams I think
[1:12:32] I'll just do in this corner right here
[1:12:33] it'll kind of bleed through from
[1:12:34] whatever the past color was but I'll
[1:12:36] just put a plant in front of right there
[1:12:37] it'll be all right nothing will show now
[1:12:39] look it would have been that easy for
[1:12:42] Moses to do that but how was Moses
[1:12:44] faithful what's Moses faithful in that
[1:12:47] he never made a mistake was Moses
[1:12:50] faithful in his own flesh no but his
[1:12:53] faithfulness was started and looked upon
[1:12:56] by God because even when he didn't
[1:12:59] understand things yet he stood with the
[1:13:02] pattern of the word that had been
[1:13:03] revealed and that's how God looks on
[1:13:06] faithfulness to you and I will we stand
[1:13:08] on God's word it isn't about how many
[1:13:11] people we pray for and how many people
[1:13:13] god well it's not about how many sermons
[1:13:15] we preach how many songs we've sung it
[1:13:18] ain't about that it's about how faithful
[1:13:20] are we with the word that God has
[1:13:23] revealed to us
[1:13:25] that's what God requires and that's what
[1:13:28] God looks at
[1:13:29] so Moses was faithful God said make it
[1:13:32] this many cubits that's how many cubits
[1:13:34] we're going to make it God said put the
[1:13:36] white Abyss around it that's what we're
[1:13:38] going to do God said to fasten it there
[1:13:40] not with nails and things and screws but
[1:13:43] God said to make it this way God said to
[1:13:46] get Badger skins to cover it this is
[1:13:48] what we're going to do what was Moses
[1:13:50] faithful to do all that God had told him
[1:13:53] to do
[1:13:55] you want to know how God looks at
[1:13:57] faithfulness right here
[1:13:59] this is how God looks at faithfulness
[1:14:01] well I don't do as much as somebody else
[1:14:03] or somebody else but if you're faithful
[1:14:05] in the eyes of God and all that God has
[1:14:08] revealed to you God looks upon you as a
[1:14:11] faithful son and daughter of God
[1:14:13] are you hearing me because to whom much
[1:14:16] has been given much is required
[1:14:20] but Christ notice as a son over his own
[1:14:22] house whose house are we if
[1:14:25] we hold fast the confidence and
[1:14:28] rejoicing of the Hope firm
[1:14:31] unto the end
[1:14:36] oh Lord Jesus help us
[1:14:38] now I want you to understand this here
[1:14:40] as we look at it we've been I've been
[1:14:42] talking about some weeks about the faith
[1:14:44] of the faithful
[1:14:46] we are not in our own selves faithful by
[1:14:50] our own accord
[1:14:53] person can be very faithful to
[1:14:56] tenants and Creeds and scriptures and a
[1:15:00] lot of different things but remember
[1:15:01] when it comes down to it it faithfulness
[1:15:04] itself is from our heart not only all
[1:15:06] that God would speak to me but all that
[1:15:09] God continues to reveal
[1:15:11] and to be faithful to that word how are
[1:15:14] we faithful to it how many ever thought
[1:15:15] things that you realized you thought
[1:15:17] wrong
[1:15:19] maybe it's just me
[1:15:20] you believe things that you realize
[1:15:22] after a while ah you know what I wasn't
[1:15:24] just exactly ironed out right there
[1:15:26] maybe it's just me and a few other
[1:15:28] people in here but you see faithfulness
[1:15:30] has nothing to do with oh he well I
[1:15:33] thought this wrong or I thought that
[1:15:34] wrong faithfulness is what do you do
[1:15:37] when you're confronted with the truth
[1:15:40] that's what real faithfulness is
[1:15:43] not making an excuse well you know
[1:15:45] brother so and so I heard him preaching
[1:15:47] no no it's about us and God in a
[1:15:49] personal walk what we do when truth
[1:15:52] comes our way oh my we are made faithful
[1:15:56] by a living experience of a living god
[1:15:59] notice how Paul would bring this out in
[1:16:02] our lives First Corinthians 7 25. Paul
[1:16:05] is writing here he says now concerning
[1:16:07] virgins I have no commandment of the
[1:16:09] Lord yet I give my judgment this is a
[1:16:11] statement I want you to see as one that
[1:16:13] hath obtained mercy of the Lord
[1:16:17] to be faithful
[1:16:21] so to be faithful you've obtained Mercy
[1:16:23] from God
[1:16:24] faithful that even when you don't feel
[1:16:27] like it
[1:16:28] but to say you know what
[1:16:30] to your old flesh
[1:16:32] I don't care what you think we're going
[1:16:34] to the house of God
[1:16:36] and I don't care what you feel spirit
[1:16:39] I'm going to borrow the needs of this
[1:16:41] body and I'm gonna get down and I'm
[1:16:44] going to borrow the mouth and I'm going
[1:16:45] to pray
[1:16:46] I don't care what my flesh says my
[1:16:49] spirit says I don't care about all the
[1:16:51] accusations of the devil well brother
[1:16:53] Samuel I don't feel sense when does a
[1:16:56] Christian live on feelings
[1:16:59] if you live on feelings you'll be as up
[1:17:02] and down as a heart monitor is when it's
[1:17:04] beating you cannot live on your feelings
[1:17:08] faithfulness is when you don't feel like
[1:17:10] it but you stand there anyhow and say I
[1:17:13] don't feel it but I know that God is
[1:17:15] faithful
[1:17:18] he made you and me he he he's the one
[1:17:21] who makes faithful Witnesses who makes
[1:17:25] faithful Witnesses the faithful and true
[1:17:27] witness himself
[1:17:29] because you see when his life comes into
[1:17:31] us that life that comes into us the holy
[1:17:34] ghost that is God's faith but Iran will
[1:17:37] take us through the message the serpent
[1:17:38] send the super sense and bring to us and
[1:17:41] spoke speak to us of how that the Holy
[1:17:43] Spirit itself is the faith of God coming
[1:17:46] into our life that Faith Of God you say
[1:17:48] well I thought I have faith you do have
[1:17:50] faith but that's why we need our faith
[1:17:53] to be operated on or as brother random
[1:17:55] put it in another place to allow him to
[1:17:58] come in to our Door of Faith and take
[1:18:01] our faith Beyond just our senses
[1:18:04] we need that faith of God
[1:18:08] that's the Holy Spirit that's what we
[1:18:09] live by I say Lord I need more of it
[1:18:12] I need more out there notice this in
[1:18:15] first Timothy chapter 1 verse 12 and I
[1:18:18] think Christ Jesus our lord who hath
[1:18:21] enabled me notice who hath enabled me
[1:18:24] for that he counted me faithful putting
[1:18:28] me into the ministry
[1:18:30] who counted him faithful
[1:18:34] right he didn't get no votes from the
[1:18:36] apostles
[1:18:37] he didn't get no votes from nobody else
[1:18:39] as a matter of fact they said you don't
[1:18:41] want to go down to this guy you don't
[1:18:43] want to go down we have heard what types
[1:18:45] of things he's done
[1:18:46] right but what they didn't know is that
[1:18:49] he's met God
[1:18:51] and though he could say that you know
[1:18:53] think about what they're thinking in
[1:18:54] their mind he's just trying to draw us
[1:18:56] out he just is just a trap think about
[1:18:58] all of the things where the enemy was
[1:19:01] trying to move upon their minds to keep
[1:19:03] and keep that from being unified right
[1:19:05] there and to keep them from hearing this
[1:19:07] testimony but notice it was God who
[1:19:10] Vindicated the testimony that he had
[1:19:13] given Paul in his own life
[1:19:16] he counted me faithful putting me into
[1:19:19] the ministry look who was before a
[1:19:22] blasphemer and a persecutor and
[1:19:25] injurious any of us have chosen anybody
[1:19:28] like this
[1:19:30] I'm sure not women that chose that's
[1:19:33] just why even sometimes that you may not
[1:19:35] witness to somebody because you just
[1:19:37] don't think
[1:19:38] oh they're so vile oh they're so down
[1:19:40] I'm glad he don't think that way I don't
[1:19:43] want to be faithful to my feelings I
[1:19:45] want to be faithful to his leading
[1:19:49] glory be to God but I oh my obtain Mercy
[1:19:54] because I did it ignorantly in unbelief
[1:19:57] this is I love this this is a faithful
[1:20:01] saying and worthy of all acceptation
[1:20:05] that Christ Jesus came into the world to
[1:20:08] save Sinners of whom I am chief
[1:20:13] be it for this cause I obtain Mercy that
[1:20:16] in me first Jesus Christ might show
[1:20:19] forth all long suffering for a pattern
[1:20:22] to them which should Hereafter believe
[1:20:24] on him till life Everlasting you realize
[1:20:27] Paul's standing there and God
[1:20:29] vindicating that word I wonder how many
[1:20:31] sitting there in a meeting that the
[1:20:33] devil had told them there's no hope for
[1:20:35] you there's no way you can ever be saved
[1:20:37] you'll never be a part of it but Paul
[1:20:40] said God permitted all of those things
[1:20:43] and yet through his grace I have
[1:20:45] obtained mercy and his grace is proving
[1:20:49] sufficient not only through my life but
[1:20:52] also to reach to others to say if God
[1:20:55] can do it for him God can do it for me
[1:20:58] yeah
[1:21:00] that's a faithful saying
[1:21:02] I say it's a faithful saying that God
[1:21:05] saved me
[1:21:06] is that a faithful saying a faithful
[1:21:08] saying that didn't stop it didn't stop
[1:21:10] 2000 years ago it's a faithful saying
[1:21:13] that God still saves life God still
[1:21:16] changes Hearts God still fills with the
[1:21:19] Holy Ghost it's a faithful saying how is
[1:21:22] it faithful because the faithful God
[1:21:25] spoke it and the faithful God confirms
[1:21:28] it and vindicates it once again right
[1:21:31] here tonight
[1:21:32] it's a faithful saying
[1:21:35] oh my
[1:21:37] think of this Colossians chapter 4 verse
[1:21:40] 9.
[1:21:41] with onesimus
[1:21:44] a faithful and beloved brother who is
[1:21:48] one of you
[1:21:50] onesimus
[1:21:52] had ran
[1:21:53] from Colossians
[1:21:55] his master was filetman
[1:21:58] one of the books in the Bible one
[1:22:00] chapter long that Paul would take and
[1:22:04] write a letter
[1:22:06] and put it into onision's hands
[1:22:09] and says return this back to your master
[1:22:12] on Nissan Miss was running with a mess
[1:22:16] where his name was in it
[1:22:21] who had robbed from his master he had
[1:22:24] ran from the situation tried to get away
[1:22:27] from it put it behind him but right
[1:22:29] there notice how God has a way of
[1:22:31] directing our pathway just right where
[1:22:33] we need to be let me tell you something
[1:22:36] or Nissim his thought that he was
[1:22:37] running away now I don't know what he
[1:22:39] might have fallen up on a hard time
[1:22:40] maybe there was something that came up
[1:22:42] in the family I don't know that even
[1:22:44] history when I've studied through all of
[1:22:46] these things it never goes in to say
[1:22:48] that but whatever it was it had to be
[1:22:51] something that he thought to be a need
[1:22:53] the scriptures do not imply that this
[1:22:56] guy was a Wall Street embezzler
[1:22:58] it simply stated that here he is this
[1:23:01] has come up and he's trying to get away
[1:23:04] from it but notice God has Paul right
[1:23:06] there
[1:23:08] in Rome and here onesimus comes right
[1:23:12] into contact with Paul
[1:23:15] and Paul begins to speak to him remember
[1:23:17] what Paul said Paul said he's coming
[1:23:19] back to you and he's going to be more
[1:23:21] profitable to you now than he's ever
[1:23:22] been because he's not just coming
[1:23:24] through you back as a servant he's
[1:23:26] coming as a brother
[1:23:28] amen you want to know about the changing
[1:23:31] power of almighty God to where a man who
[1:23:34] was a robber and a thief that had run
[1:23:37] away from a situation but now in the
[1:23:40] presence of almighty God the revealed
[1:23:42] word had revealed the Son of God and now
[1:23:46] the word can stand there and say
[1:23:48] onesimus a faithful and beloved brother
[1:23:53] I tell you there's nothing that can
[1:23:54] change our past like the word of God you
[1:23:57] can try to as many racers you want
[1:23:58] there's nothing that can take it away
[1:24:00] outside of the blood of Jesus Christ you
[1:24:02] can try to I'm trying to get away from
[1:24:04] this trying to get away from that you
[1:24:06] can never do that but it's simply to
[1:24:08] recognize you're wrong and accept what
[1:24:11] Jesus Christ has done for you he'll
[1:24:13] change whatever title goes along your
[1:24:16] name and make it to say a faithful
[1:24:18] beloved brother a faithful beloved
[1:24:21] sister what does that the power of the
[1:24:24] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:24:27] brother Samuel simply believing simply
[1:24:30] believing
[1:24:39] Revelations 21 5.
[1:24:41] and he that set upon the throne said
[1:24:44] behold
[1:24:45] I make all things
[1:24:48] new
[1:24:51] aren't you glad he does that
[1:24:54] aren't you glad he does that in you and
[1:24:55] me
[1:24:57] and he said unto me right
[1:25:00] for these words are true and faithful
[1:25:06] now you realize these words to be true
[1:25:08] and faithful this is not just reciting
[1:25:10] words David would write in Psalms 119
[1:25:13] thy judgments are faithful O Lord thy
[1:25:17] testimonies are true and faithful they
[1:25:20] are filled with righteousness how could
[1:25:22] David say that he's not saying it
[1:25:25] because he hasn't experienced it he's
[1:25:27] saying it because he's experienced it
[1:25:30] and how can you and I say that God is
[1:25:32] faithful because we've experienced a
[1:25:34] faithful God
[1:25:36] we've experienced a God that has come
[1:25:39] down to work and change us change the
[1:25:41] very desire change our very nature we
[1:25:44] can stand right here in this scripture
[1:25:46] this is a faithful and true saying
[1:25:49] because not only has he changed my
[1:25:51] desires but he's changing me he's
[1:25:54] changing me he's changing me this is a
[1:25:57] faithful I just would rather be dead to
[1:26:00] myself
[1:26:02] I'd rather suffer with him my My Flesh I
[1:26:05] I does not request suffering I don't
[1:26:08] like suffering anybody else like
[1:26:10] suffering
[1:26:11] to be honest you don't
[1:26:13] because suffering we never get to choose
[1:26:15] how it comes
[1:26:16] and let me just tell you something
[1:26:18] suffering never is without any value
[1:26:22] it might seem like it in the natural
[1:26:24] where's the value at but remember the
[1:26:27] Loyalty of our heart is what's beating
[1:26:31] the material until it goes in the mold
[1:26:34] God knows just how to get you and I into
[1:26:38] position
[1:26:39] he knows how to mold us how to shape us
[1:26:43] and there's nothing that can do that
[1:26:45] outside of tests and trials
[1:26:49] character is not molded any other way
[1:26:53] than by tests and trials
[1:26:56] so I think we could say like brother
[1:26:57] random could say Lord
[1:27:00] don't keep them from me
[1:27:02] but give me your grace to go through
[1:27:04] Lord
[1:27:05] Give Me Your Grace give me Grace not to
[1:27:07] complain give me Grace not to belly ache
[1:27:10] when it's going on give me Grace that if
[1:27:12] I start to complain give me Grace to
[1:27:14] recognize God has kept me thus far God
[1:27:18] has given me strength in my life God has
[1:27:21] brought me step by step by the way give
[1:27:22] me Grace Lord when I'm going through
[1:27:25] tests and trials how can we ask that
[1:27:27] because he's a faithful God
[1:27:30] can't see
[1:27:32] he abided faithful so it don't matter it
[1:27:35] really don't matter if the whole world
[1:27:36] disbelieves there's going to be somebody
[1:27:38] belief
[1:27:40] I'm just going to stand I'm one are you
[1:27:42] I'm one and God in other words God's not
[1:27:46] saying well if you don't believe me
[1:27:48] I guess I have to compromise because I
[1:27:51] want you to be in attendance so much
[1:27:52] I'll compromise on my word I'll cut it
[1:27:55] here cut it there if I got to make a
[1:27:57] special program for you so that you'll
[1:27:59] come nope God said this is my word if
[1:28:02] you want true Grace if you want Liberty
[1:28:04] if you want Deliverance if you want
[1:28:07] freedom if you want all of that there is
[1:28:09] a way that I have made for you
[1:28:12] but it's your choice
[1:28:14] and God in my faithful how does he abide
[1:28:17] faithful to make it real to hearts that
[1:28:19] simply say Lord I need you Lord God I
[1:28:22] need Deliverance in my life I need
[1:28:24] healing in my body I need transformation
[1:28:27] I need to be changed Lord my character
[1:28:30] molding more and more and more I need
[1:28:33] that
[1:28:34] and he abides faithful
[1:28:36] for you and I
[1:28:41] first Peter 4 19 trying to come down
[1:28:43] here
[1:28:44] wherefore let them that suffer according
[1:28:47] to the will of God
[1:28:49] commit the keeping
[1:28:51] of their soul to him
[1:28:54] in well-doing
[1:28:56] as unto a faithful creator
[1:28:59] I could probably preach on the Month of
[1:29:00] Sundays on that suffering according to
[1:29:02] the will of God because I'm sure that
[1:29:03] probably all of us at one time or
[1:29:05] another have said that we are suffering
[1:29:07] according to the will of God and the
[1:29:08] will of God had nothing to do with it
[1:29:10] whatsoever
[1:29:11] it was our own decision I said all of us
[1:29:14] and I'm not even going to try to take a
[1:29:16] track record on myself or anybody else
[1:29:18] because there ain't enough index cards
[1:29:19] to keep tally marks on it for any of us
[1:29:22] in here but the one thing I'm grateful
[1:29:24] for is God's grace that moves down that
[1:29:27] through the midst of it even in our
[1:29:30] wrong decisions we can receive Grace all
[1:29:34] things work together for the good to
[1:29:37] them who are the called according to his
[1:29:40] purpose
[1:29:41] I'm thankful for God's grace he is
[1:29:45] faithful not to leave you and I I wonder
[1:29:47] how many times God could have looked
[1:29:49] down at your life or my life and said
[1:29:51] you made a mess of things you get out of
[1:29:53] that mess on your own he's faithful
[1:29:55] he's faithful
[1:29:57] now he ain't gonna pull me out of hole
[1:29:59] if I don't want to be pulled out of the
[1:30:00] hole but God said if you're ready to
[1:30:02] come out of that hole if you're ready to
[1:30:04] turn your heart back to me if you're
[1:30:06] ready I will pick you up out of there I
[1:30:09] will give you Grace where you can't
[1:30:11] climb out of there I am faithful to
[1:30:14] bring you back
[1:30:15] [Applause]
[1:30:17] that's God's sufficient Grace let me
[1:30:19] tell you there ain't nobody in the
[1:30:21] building tonight as faithful as God is
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:27] nobody but I believe we've got his life
[1:30:31] that'll bring us into that character
[1:30:33] aren't you
[1:30:35] I mean it'd be like looking at somebody
[1:30:37] that was you know just some tree imagine
[1:30:39] you went to buy a tree and on that tag
[1:30:42] on that tree they showed you a tree that
[1:30:44] was a little bitty old short little
[1:30:45] thing shriveled up had ugly leaves on
[1:30:48] and everything else and you're buying
[1:30:49] this tree why would you want to buy that
[1:30:51] tree you don't want that tree in your
[1:30:53] front yard that's why the character of
[1:30:55] Jesus Christ is on display that's what
[1:30:58] the opening of the seals did it brought
[1:31:01] the Living God right Among Us the
[1:31:03] character of Jesus Christ you might say
[1:31:05] brother Samuel that's too high for me it
[1:31:08] might be for you and me but it's not too
[1:31:10] high for the Holy Ghost inside of you
[1:31:13] and I that's what God wants us to
[1:31:15] recognize it's not you making yourself
[1:31:17] it's god making you
[1:31:21] and God is faithful when you gave up he
[1:31:25] didn't give up
[1:31:26] when you've thrown in the towel he out
[1:31:29] and thrown in the towel God is faithful
[1:31:35] [Applause]
[1:31:44] there hath no temptation First
[1:31:45] Corinthians 10 13 there had no
[1:31:47] temptation taken you but such as is
[1:31:49] common to man but God is faithful
[1:31:54] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:31:56] above that you're able but will with the
[1:31:58] Temptation also make a way of Escape
[1:32:00] that you may be able to bear it so we
[1:32:03] can look up to the Lord and say father
[1:32:04] your faithful Lord
[1:32:07] lead me through this Lord
[1:32:09] lead me through this God may help me to
[1:32:11] have the right kind of an attitude help
[1:32:13] me Lord to conduct myself as a son and
[1:32:15] daughter of God that's one that
[1:32:17] represents you where the rest can say do
[1:32:20] you feed him any different do you let
[1:32:21] him sleep in a different bunk house
[1:32:23] maybe you got him a Tempur-Pedic
[1:32:24] mattress nope it ain't none of that what
[1:32:26] it is he recognizes his father is a king
[1:32:29] in a distant land and he is the King's
[1:32:32] son or King's Daughter and that effect
[1:32:34] of that reality is what is influencing
[1:32:38] his faithfulness
[1:32:42] oh God let us be under that influence
[1:32:47] can I have just a few more minutes
[1:32:49] first Thessalonians 5 23 and the Very
[1:32:52] God of Peace all of that sanctify you
[1:32:56] holy and I pray God your whole spirit
[1:32:58] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[1:33:01] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:04] faithful is he that calleth you who also
[1:33:09] will do it
[1:33:11] not might do it not maybe do it we'll do
[1:33:15] it
[1:33:16] Faithful is he
[1:33:19] you see what the issue is don't look at
[1:33:21] yourself in the mirror because looking
[1:33:23] at yourself in the mirror be the same
[1:33:25] thing for me looking at myself in the
[1:33:26] mirror just like Paul when Paul could
[1:33:28] say he hath counted me faithful I'm sure
[1:33:31] that Paul could not have even given God
[1:33:33] a list of reasons why he should have
[1:33:36] been an apostle
[1:33:38] there's not a list of reasons that you
[1:33:41] and I have for being a Believer there's
[1:33:44] nothing that we can point
[1:33:46] and point sales
[1:33:47] be counted you and I faithful do you
[1:33:49] realize he's revealed this message to
[1:33:52] you and I not that we deserve it but he
[1:33:55] has counted
[1:33:57] counted you Faithful
[1:34:00] brother Samuel I've had my shortcomings
[1:34:03] but he's looking deeper he when he said
[1:34:05] job is a perfect man he wasn't talking
[1:34:08] about his flesh he's talking about that
[1:34:12] Son of God on the inside
[1:34:15] [Applause]
[1:34:22] second Thessalonians 3 3 but the Lord
[1:34:25] is faithful
[1:34:27] who shall establish you continue to
[1:34:31] strengthen you and keep you
[1:34:34] from evil
[1:34:37] let me read you another before I close
[1:34:38] because I think it's very fitting how
[1:34:41] the spirit of the Lord would have me to
[1:34:42] place this here right after this
[1:34:44] scripture first John 1 8 if we say that
[1:34:47] we have no sin we deceive ourselves and
[1:34:50] the truth is not in us if we confess our
[1:34:54] sins
[1:34:55] he is what
[1:34:57] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[1:35:01] and to cleanse us from all
[1:35:03] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[1:35:05] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[1:35:08] word is not in US
[1:35:10] but if we confess our sins
[1:35:14] this time you don't know how many times
[1:35:15] I've confessed it ain't about how many
[1:35:17] times you confessed but it's time when
[1:35:19] you wouldn't distract your heart because
[1:35:21] why out of your heart is to be faithful
[1:35:23] to him to his voice let me tell you
[1:35:26] they're sufficient Grace for God to give
[1:35:28] you delivering power over every
[1:35:30] besetting sin over every way do not let
[1:35:33] the weight or besetting sin Define you
[1:35:36] as though it's going to be something you
[1:35:38] carry around all this time you need to
[1:35:41] stand upon God's word and say I will not
[1:35:44] carry this around I will not carry it I
[1:35:47] will not be subservient I speak it in
[1:35:50] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:53] what he is faithful
[1:35:58] oh brother Sammy once again if you go to
[1:36:00] looking at yourself in the mirror all
[1:36:02] you'll see is unworthiness and you know
[1:36:04] what I agree with you
[1:36:06] we're all unworthy
[1:36:09] but you're looking at the wrong one the
[1:36:11] scripture says looking unto Jesus the
[1:36:14] author and the finish of our faith I
[1:36:16] don't understand everything well do you
[1:36:18] understand his blood has come to cleanse
[1:36:20] you do you understand that he wants to
[1:36:22] change you do you understand that he
[1:36:24] wants to deliver you do you understand
[1:36:26] that he wants he the faithful one wants
[1:36:28] to produce a faithfulness in your life
[1:36:33] eight Hallelujah
[1:36:35] that's what he wants to do
[1:36:38] I think the greatest thing we can do is
[1:36:40] like what Sarah did in Hebrews 11 11 I'm
[1:36:43] closing here
[1:36:44] we just can't go no further through
[1:36:46] faith
[1:36:47] also Sarah herself received
[1:36:50] strength how did she receive strength
[1:36:54] through faith
[1:36:55] well it's faith believing what he said
[1:37:00] Sarah didn't go
[1:37:02] to some walk-in clinic and crawl into
[1:37:04] some bed like a tanning bed and pull it
[1:37:06] down and she became well I found this
[1:37:09] place a fountain of Eternal Youth and
[1:37:10] I've got to get back fair and Nick it
[1:37:12] can make me to where my husband's
[1:37:13] attracted to me again I didn't know them
[1:37:15] no she didn't have to do that remember
[1:37:17] Sarah got in the way all along
[1:37:20] right she gave Hagar all these things
[1:37:22] but eventually I noticed this it
[1:37:25] interrupted God's program but couldn't
[1:37:27] defeat it
[1:37:28] are you hearing me in interrupted but
[1:37:31] couldn't defeat it there can be a lot of
[1:37:33] interruptions in your life but your
[1:37:34] interruptions are not who you are
[1:37:38] interruptions do not define you Nord is
[1:37:42] the word defeated
[1:37:44] through Sarah through faith also Sarah
[1:37:47] herself receives strength to conceive
[1:37:49] seed and was delivered of a child
[1:37:53] she was past age
[1:37:56] in other words they wrote her off past
[1:37:59] age
[1:38:01] unable
[1:38:03] not Abel failed multiple attempts
[1:38:08] but she was able because she judged
[1:38:12] him
[1:38:13] faithful who had promised
[1:38:17] that's Victory right there
[1:38:20] is to be able when we can come into that
[1:38:22] place to judge him Faithfully
[1:38:25] no matter what no matter what the
[1:38:26] circumstance no matter what the promise
[1:38:28] is
[1:38:29] but for us to stand there and judge him
[1:38:32] Faithfully no matter where you're at in
[1:38:34] your journey in your life and in your
[1:38:35] walk with God but to be able to stand
[1:38:38] there and judge him faithful
[1:38:40] do you realize Abraham came to Mount
[1:38:43] Moriah
[1:38:44] and he'd come to such a place his faith
[1:38:47] let me tell you something that Faith was
[1:38:49] in him the whole time but it wasn't to
[1:38:51] that place of maturity
[1:38:54] are you with me it wasn't to that place
[1:38:56] of maturity yet
[1:38:57] but he came to that place and he told
[1:39:00] him you stay here
[1:39:01] I am the lat are going to go in worship
[1:39:05] see it came to a place
[1:39:07] of faithfulness
[1:39:10] to the very last moment
[1:39:16] his hand was in the air
[1:39:18] Isaac laid there on the altar
[1:39:21] and the angel of the Lord said stay your
[1:39:23] hand
[1:39:24] stay your hand Abraham and God had
[1:39:28] provided
[1:39:29] for himself
[1:39:31] [Music]
[1:39:34] an offering
[1:39:37] oh my much we could go in and say that I
[1:39:40] don't want to go all there tonight but
[1:39:41] to say it to come to this place of
[1:39:44] faithful
[1:39:45] to the very last point
[1:39:48] let me tell you friends you can never
[1:39:49] ever be wrong by being faithful to the
[1:39:53] word of God
[1:39:55] I'd say tonight it ought to be the
[1:39:57] greatest thing to be able to say the
[1:39:58] desire of our heart Lord I want to be
[1:40:00] faithful to your word beyond my feelings
[1:40:05] Beyond everything I want to be faithful
[1:40:07] in order to the word of God that's the
[1:40:09] kind of testimony that I want of what
[1:40:11] that God said about Moses notice God
[1:40:13] never said Moses is my faithful servant
[1:40:15] because he stood and spoke to the Red
[1:40:19] Sea anyone's mentioned
[1:40:22] but it says he was faithful in all my
[1:40:25] house
[1:40:26] what was the house every little detail
[1:40:31] every detail was
[1:40:34] important
[1:40:37] I said God help me
[1:40:40] help me
[1:40:42] to look at that word to look at the
[1:40:44] pattern help me Lord to look at that
[1:40:46] everything is valued not things to be in
[1:40:49] this age it's an age of things getting
[1:40:50] rid of this and getting rid of this and
[1:40:52] all they want to talk about is one
[1:40:54] little thing and one attribute of God
[1:40:56] but it's such the value
[1:41:00] to be able
[1:41:01] from our hearts
[1:41:03] to say Lord
[1:41:06] I want to serve you with everything
[1:41:07] within Me Lord I want to serve you
[1:41:10] better we should say it that way
[1:41:12] man I want to serve you
[1:41:13] better Lord
[1:41:15] help me in every little detail if
[1:41:17] there's if there's a corner that I'm
[1:41:19] missing help me Lord if there's
[1:41:21] something in the pattern that I'm not
[1:41:23] saying let me just say something you'll
[1:41:24] never know what the pattern is by
[1:41:26] looking at other things
[1:41:29] but you got to get into it give yourself
[1:41:31] to the Lord give yourself to the Lord
[1:41:34] what's God continue to unfold his word
[1:41:37] because remember
[1:41:39] as you're faithful to the word of God
[1:41:41] faithful to what God
[1:41:43] has spoke to your heart
[1:41:45] God will open more to you
[1:41:52] and let's pray
[1:41:57] Lord Jesus
[1:42:00] oh God throughout Lord
[1:42:04] hear tonight Lord as we stand here Lord
[1:42:08] it's things O Lord that
[1:42:10] fathers we look at this with
[1:42:11] faithfulness Lord to be faithful
[1:42:14] and knowing that God
[1:42:17] in the midst of the test or the trial
[1:42:19] that's where the loyalty
[1:42:21] loyalty of our heart beats the material
[1:42:26] until it's time to go in the mold
[1:42:29] father
[1:42:31] it's only by your grace like we read of
[1:42:33] Paul
[1:42:34] obtained Mercy
[1:42:37] to be faithful
[1:42:39] Lord God it's not by any of our merits
[1:42:42] but Lord It's You the faithful one who
[1:42:46] makes
[1:42:47] faithful ones
[1:42:49] It's You Lord God
[1:42:51] father moving in our lives Lord
[1:42:54] not that every time that Lord that we
[1:42:57] hit the mark but you are faithful to
[1:42:59] correct us when we're wrong
[1:43:03] that even builds our confidence when
[1:43:05] we're in need of healing in our body
[1:43:08] because we know that you're faithful not
[1:43:10] only when we're right
[1:43:13] but you're faithful to tell us when
[1:43:15] we're wrong
[1:43:16] you're faithful Lord God to pour out
[1:43:19] your blessings and your faithful to
[1:43:22] bring correction to us
[1:43:25] you're faithful Lord
[1:43:28] father that's as we can stand upon your
[1:43:30] word
[1:43:33] because of your grace because
[1:43:35] of your faith moving
[1:43:38] into our lives Lord God
[1:43:41] now Lord you know where each of us are
[1:43:43] tonight you know where every heart is at
[1:43:46] I pray that God right here
[1:43:49] right here this evening
[1:43:52] for everyone that's gathered in here
[1:43:54] Lord
[1:43:55] no matter where that they're at
[1:43:57] may they take Lord God the promise
[1:44:01] and father no matter what it might be
[1:44:04] but put the past
[1:44:06] behind the Lord
[1:44:08] take Lord the forgiveness
[1:44:11] notice Lord to where that it strikes it
[1:44:14] deals with the heart and then Lord that
[1:44:16] repentance Lord would come out Lord
[1:44:19] but may we lord I pray father right here
[1:44:21] tonight
[1:44:23] every one of us Lord
[1:44:25] Lord Lord any Lord that would feel like
[1:44:28] in any way that they've fallen short may
[1:44:30] they not Lord lay there Lord in that but
[1:44:32] may they recognize there is a faithful
[1:44:34] God
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:36] if we confess our sins you are faithful
[1:44:38] and just to forgive us
[1:44:41] you don't rub our face in the dirt
[1:44:44] you don't set us down and give us a
[1:44:45] 30-minute lecture about it
[1:44:48] the conviction has already struck our
[1:44:50] heart
[1:44:50] [Music]
[1:44:52] Lord Jesus
[1:44:54] may we take that word
[1:44:57] and apply it to our own lives
[1:45:01] sometimes Lord that's the greatest
[1:45:02] greatest
[1:45:04] difficulty
[1:45:06] is being able to receive that in our own
[1:45:09] lives
[1:45:11] to be able to walk forward because the
[1:45:13] Lord to match your own glorious
[1:45:17] character
[1:45:18] help us Lord
[1:45:20] help us I pray tonight
[1:45:23] Lord this is my desire and I believe the
[1:45:27] desire of every believer here tonight
[1:45:30] is to have that that would be recorded
[1:45:32] about us
[1:45:34] Moses like it was of Moses he was
[1:45:37] faithful
[1:45:38] in all my house
[1:45:40] [Music]
[1:45:42] or because it might be some Lord you use
[1:45:44] this all in different capacities not
[1:45:46] only as ministers but even throughout
[1:45:48] the body
[1:45:49] such diversity of gifts
[1:45:52] and Lord it really doesn't matter if a
[1:45:54] person Lord they may not as far as have
[1:45:56] Lord what they can see maybe something
[1:45:58] that would be a noticeable gift in their
[1:46:01] life but their standing faithful
[1:46:04] faithful
[1:46:06] to the word of God
[1:46:09] then Lord Jesus you've showed us right
[1:46:12] here tonight how that you look upon
[1:46:14] faithfulness
[1:46:15] you do not judge faithfulness Lord by
[1:46:17] that of a gift the person with a gift
[1:46:19] has even more responsibility but Lord
[1:46:22] God may you judge faithfulness on how
[1:46:24] faithful are we to the word of God
[1:46:28] even in Rome are we willing to repent
[1:46:33] and say Lord forgive me
[1:46:36] oh God
[1:46:38] I believe Lord Jesus tonight
[1:46:41] I believe I'm one of them
[1:46:43] and I believe I'm standing in the
[1:46:44] company
[1:46:45] of believer's lives and hearts
[1:46:48] that God that have that same desire
[1:46:52] to be faithful
[1:46:53] help us Lord
[1:46:57] I pray father may you give Grace Lord
[1:47:00] give Grace Lord I pray to every life and
[1:47:02] every heart as you have tonight Lord
[1:47:04] if there's something Lord that's
[1:47:06] hindered one Lord maybe a trap an
[1:47:08] ensnarement Lord I pray that you'd give
[1:47:10] them Grace Lord God to be able to walk
[1:47:13] out of that trap Lord God maybe
[1:47:15] something Lord as it's come along Lord
[1:47:17] and something Lord that within them Lord
[1:47:19] God that Lord where there's been an
[1:47:21] ensnarement Lord that is hindered
[1:47:24] faithfulness Lord
[1:47:25] I pray God tonight May there be a
[1:47:28] faithfulness that will rise from their
[1:47:29] heart to say Lord lead me out of this
