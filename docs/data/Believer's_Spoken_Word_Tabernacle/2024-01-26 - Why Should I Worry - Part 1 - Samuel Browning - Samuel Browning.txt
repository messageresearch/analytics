and ask that you would Lord be glorified we pray in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless you tonight amen so good to be back together Amen in the presence of the Lord and we want to go to job chapter 23 and amen so thankful Amen brother Brian musicians amen just a wonderful atmosphere that's been created here and just a wonderful time of worship Amen to know that that goes collectively together it's certainly just a an instrument alone we'll never do it but it's everything coming in harmony because truly if there was no instruments there's still an atmosphere that can come amen by that a Believer but I'm glad that God allowed us to have instruments amen and I'm so thankful for them so thankful for each and every one of you and uh it's just so refreshing many times I sat back there and I'm listening to the songs that are being sung and it's just um just really really tremendous so I want to look here in verse 13 uh and begin to read through this portion again of scripture and job says here but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him therefore am I troubled at his presence when I consider that word consider means to think and his perception on things when I consider I am afraid of him that to me that that that portion of scripture as we've looked at throughout to me it is just it just it just takes my My Breath Away almost because to see of how that job himself would have such perfect peace with the by the Revelation that God has given but how that the enemy is trying to project thoughts to him that would try to discomfort him and yet you know to me it's such a Paradox how a person can have such a rest and a peace in their soul and yet can be troubled in their mind amen but I'm glad I'm glad for God's mercy that he came down amen he who made a way that we could have that real peace in our soul and receive from there that which is able to bring everything else in subjection amen for God maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me because I was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face and may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd just like to begin to speak to you here tonight and I certainly didn't um know or was not even looking at it in that way some months ago when this thought had struck me within looking at Job 23 and uh how it is many times you just don't know whether or not is it going to be something and how when that the Lord will place it but I want to just begin to speak here on the thought drawn from here why should I worry why should I worry and when we look at we've been looking at that thought on having a right perception and obviously we would know that anytime that we have the wrong perception then that in itself will actually affect us in certain ways and we've looked at that with job job himself he is not aware in the sense or not he doesn't understand what's taking place God hasn't let him know uh that of what had taken place in heaven that God was actually the one that was bragging on him and so job doesn't know this but but job his perception of it is that it's God that is doing all of this to him and yet to see how close that that could be is that the prophet would tell us that as long as Satan could make job think that it was his God that was doing this to him he had him whipped and then brother brand would go on to say he says and he will do the same thing to you today he wants to make you think that it is God that is doing it now you know many of us would look at that and think well we understand that you know that in the sense that we we have a more of an understanding by the word to know that it's not anything that God himself was doing it was God permitting and it was Satan that was doing it and when we can realize and look back into these things which job did not realize or think of know the conversation that was in heaven but think about it Satan knew there was a hedge around job's life he knew there was a protection and he even told God God he says I can't get to him unless that hedge you move a little bit and God would give him permissions to encroach and that's the same way it is with any test or trial that comes our way even sickness that Satan just cannot come and do what he wants to do when he feels like doing it no he has to first get permission from God and so we realize that within many of these things as we would look at it that job himself would not have the right perception on it and that would affect him we read through many different scriptures as we would go through it and job you know looking at his own life he knew where he was standing with God he knew that there was nothing that God had asked him to do but what he didn't do it job job knew that I think it's to me it's such a powerful message that the prophet would preach and I went through it over and over again I have heard but now I see and he spends that time upon job of how that we in our lives for anything that we're asking of God he says we must have the assurance that we are justified in what we're asking for that we're standing where we ought to be standing in God and that everything between us and God is just lined up perfectly then we've got a right to claim the promise we have a right to go and take our petitions before God and make that known we are justified in the thing that we're asking and we can look for answer I I think to me it's fitting in the hour that we're living in because of how the Book of Job so portrays even that of redemption throughout but that of perception you and I both know that we have had the wrong perceptions of things in different times and and uh it has affected us it can affect us in our actions toward others and just our perception or our thoughts of things it'd be just like if you let's say you were talking to somebody and they never seemingly made eye contact with you and maybe they didn't you know when you were talking they didn't smile or anything the thought could hit your mind that they really don't care about what I'm talking about they really don't want nothing to do with me and you'll find that when we begin to dwell on things like that it will actually affect our Behavior now I can't even go into all of this tonight because there's actual quotes to show this and portions within the scripture even when Abraham remember him going down to Egypt why did Abraham do what he did by calling teing telling Sarah you tell them that you're my sister why did he do that did he go up and ask anybody hey how should I enter this place no he said because I thought that the fear of God wasn't in this place boy was he wrong that's good that King actually feared God to the degree that he could know God he actually feared God remember it was God when the king went and God came to him in a dream and here the Lord came to him and said he said Lord you know I I it wasn't in my heart to do this he said I know the Integrity of your heart he was not even elect he was not even elect seed of God but God knew the Integrity of a righteous man so sometimes the perceptions itself can be so off and there is effects of those perceptions none of us are exempt from it it does not matter who you are what we are we're not exempt from wrong perceptions that's why we need the grace of God continually in our lives and when so when we look at this and you'll maybe see where I'm drawing this from out of the message I've heard but now I see brother BR said job had something wrong with him but he couldn't get the inspiration on him now remember he's a prophet and it was worrying him and notice when you get in that kind of a fix in other words when things aren't coming the way you're used to them coming and the way that they should be coming and then you start to worry you're in a fix how many's been there right that's when the enemy moves into every friend nearly you got now let me just say it like this it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to have friends that maybe would be you know like job's friends or but you know notice how sometimes where the enemy will come in and you can find certain things that will rise up such negativity that can get around there and you could think can I get one quotation of a promise in a positive way right can I can somebody at least send me a text message can somebody at least text bomb me with a few positive messages and do you know sometimes that a person coming around may not intend to be negative maybe they're prone to that way in their makeup you know and things like that such as you have a cough oh I know a person that had a cough like that better get your coughing ready because they're going to be bearing you tomorrow you know you always you look at things like that and we're tested in that way cuz we're all made up differently you know that's the one thing that's powerful is that God just did not send the Holy Ghost to change necessarily our temperament but that he would live and operate through Us and how that God would give us the grace to actually live Victorious even over those things in our life and tendencies but notice this every enemy moves into every friend nearly you God and they begin to accuse him oh it must have been a miserable thing for him to know his friends that accused him Satan then goes and joins himself with the Enemy now remember it wasn't just his buddies that were around him his wife the Bible says how that she turned and said why don't you just Curse God and die even through the course of the trial job said our breath is strange to one another I don't have to preach too deep on that you can figure that out there were effects from this trial and how that it had upon his life even to where the maids that was in his house job would speak of it there was no such thing as even the maids themselves were turning their back on job oh my what a what a time what a situation he was in but God had confidence in his word in his son he had confidence in job's life now watch this then Satan comes in and Satan says let me have him I'll make him curse you I'll make him deny his message I'll make him curse you I'll make him go back and say it was all wrong then he tried with everything he could to all the great man and the friends that he used to have but job stood flat-footed for he knew he had heard God's voice now this term of worry when you think of it why should I worry the wor word worry it means to give away to anxiety or unease to allow one's mind to dwell on difficulty or troubles to cause annoyance to or to cause to feel anxiety or concern now I'm sure every one of us at some point in time or another and if God carries not only have we worried about things but there will be things come along that we will also worry about now I'm not saying that in a way that we would all you know turn the pews to a circle join hands and sing Kumbaya we're nothing but a bunch of worry wordss that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is is that the Frailty of our Humanity we will never Escape worries from coming but there is an answer for every worry that comes our way yes sir that's what I love about the Lord that when you go when God gets a hold of your life it's not a picnic you've entered into a Battleground as a matter of fact brother R said when you say you've received the Holy Ghost he said then he said every gun out of hell is trained on you you've got a Target on your back but he says remember you've got greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world what does that do well if I would just leave that quote in that way it could almost be put you in a state of worry but see the word does never leave you in a state of worry you understand what I'm saying the word never puts you in a state of worry the word will always work to settle you and if you're not settled it will point you to a place of settling in your life because the whole goal of the Gospel is rest is peace is to dwell in that Perfection of God so why should I worry my what a time to be talking about this in this age that's right I'm sure every one of us have been like that like job where there's been certain things even as much as we know and understand and how that this would be laid out in the message of the hour the scriptures showing us how that God would work with us as Sons and Daughters of God but how many of us still within when things take place in our life we look at it sometimes in a manner of what's taking place what's going on but aren't you glad that God the holy spirit will come back around and remind you of his word I'm so glad about that now watch this in the message the way to have Fellowship brother BR says there's only two faculties that govern a human and one of them is Faith which brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all faith is of God fear is of the devil fear Makes You Weary or you could say worry fear makes you wonder and if I was going to die in the morning what good would it do to me to get all stewed up about it what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning and my life had to end tomorrow morning what good would it do me to worry about it I know this is simple but the prophet he's pointing out the very principle love looking at things if we can look at him this way he's helping us to understand there are things that you you and I need to consider but it must have value in it and value is something that speaks of the real gold that's in your life something that will bring value you realize that's how you're to evaluate everything in your life with the Holy Spirit in your life that's how you evaluate the things you partake in that's how you evaluate your Associates you look at it in terms of value it's not just about you but it's about in this situation of is there a value or something mutually it would flow and there would be an increase in our life I don't want to be a part of things that devalue and want to take from me the things that God is instilling in me this is why brother Ram says he tells us as ministers he says you watch he said on Monday morning how that Satan will come against that Minister I believe it's every one of us you come out of a good service whether it's Friday morning Monday morning and he said watch how Satan will come and try to knock every ounce of confidence that God has instilled in your life and that's what that's what Satan that's his trick to try to knock that out because with that confidence well where did you get that confidence from you didn't get the confidence from the music You Got The Confidence from an unseen realm the supernatural begin to roll down out of an unseen realm the Revelation begin to break forth and God was speaking so personally to your life that it actually gave you confidence to face the problems that are before you Hallelujah two faculties that govern a human let me read that again the other is fear which has no value in it faith is of god fear is of the devil fear Makes You Weary fear makes you wonder if we could just stop right there tonight right there there right right within that portion it gives enough to discern the thoughts that come to you if a thought comes to you and wants to bring fear that didn't come from God the thoughts of God his word comes to bring Faith is that right oh brother Samuel I heard a certain quote presented a certain way I heard a certain Scripture presented a certain way well sure there's things sometimes that that can be presented in a way but remember remember when God presents his word his word does not come to belittle you put you down or rub your face in the dirt that is not of God it could have been quoting the Scripture it could be quoting a quote but it matters the spirit that's behind it is that all right yes sir so now notice he goes on to say in the next portion of that quote he said well you say what good would it do me to have faith faith can sign my there's value in faith don't be weary don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe and the only way you can have faith you have to have love first for love produces Faith Lord this is one thing I I love all the way through the message of the hour it just don't only tell us don't do this don't do that but there here's the remedy right I mean it's sees you don't do this and you're wrong and you're wrong and you're wrong and you're wrong and you're wrong and you're wrong anybody right besides you I mean is anybody right don't do don't do don't do don't do but see look what the message of the hour it comes to show you and I it shows us you don't have to do this but here here it is something you can just say okay well I'll just flip the switch off okay where's that switch of worry at I'll just there it is it's off it's off right now no the only way that worry is overcome is you've got a focus on the right thing Hallelujah is that right now watch 1 John 4:17 hear in is our love made perfect I love that herein is our love made perfect you know what that scripture tells me that there's more of the love of God Amen that's what that tells me that there is continual fillings of the Holy Ghost it tells me not just feelings of it but that more and more and more of God's love in our life is that right this is why when you evaluate you read down through 1 Corinthians 13 and you and sometimes if you read through there and something catches you you and the spirit of God deals with your heart listen it isn't don't don't begin to pray and say Lord I I I I shouldn't feel that way towards this one or I shouldn't know what you need to realize is this is what's happening I need more lord of the love of God Amen because that is the answer is that right we don't want to just put out little fires let's get to the source of the matter what's going to give us the strength amen herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness confidence in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world in verse 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear aren't you glad about that it's like as I've described it before it's kind of like that whacka game that would be at the fairgrounds or whatever more and you taking that and it popping up out of this hole and you got to pow put it down there it pops up here you put it down there all around us fears and worries can come from many different events but just because fears and worries come and you feel it you don't have to occupy it and neither do you have to sit there under condemnation because you have felt that way you have a strength on the inside of the love of God to whack put it back in its place whack put it back in its place whack put it back in its place yes sir yeah because fear hath torment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love so the real love of God brings rest it brings a rest in the sense that I know in whom I have believed I am resting in the work that he's done in my life but it doesn't mean that worries and fears can't come around you you hear me now watch this you see God has made such a provision by his word to be able to work and and and and push back and give man Grace over scares and over fears and over worry brother brand would say like this in the way to have Fellowship he said I know that if you can get away from that scare and get love in its place something's going to happen right so you have to get away from the scare and once you get away from the scare then God God begins to put something in its place I want more of his love I want more whatever your worries is tonight whatever is on your mind it might not even be something that's there in the Forefront before you but whatever it is I say God I want to get away from anything anything thing that is unlike you I want to get away from all of my worries because I cannot solve one problem on my own none I've never solved one problem my own well brother Samuel I prayed and I fasted that wasn't you solving the problem that was God in his Mercy that led you to pray LED you to fast but it was not because of your efforts that did it will God honor prayer yes will God H her honor fasting yes but it's to understand it's all in God's sovereignty why do you say that because you might be praying and fasting and you're not getting the answer like you had normally got and that's where you can begin to worry is that right now watch in the message of Love brother BR says it like this this is just the Simplicity of Love here Peter said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost promises to you and your children to them a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen Lord that means me that settles it allall there's no Mayes remember when Paul said when he said the gospel that we have preached it was not yay and nay and well you can have this and I don't know about that but it was all yay and amen in him is that right now notice brother bam goes on and says anything God says oh you just love him so much you believe it brother B said oh I feel religious now to think that perfect love cast out all fear you're not scared about nothing you're just resting you're not oh I may backslide tomorrow I may backslide next week I want worry about that see Satan would love for your mind to begin to think about that well I might this and I might this and I know so and so did this and I know so who cares it's about you and God it's God who spoke to you personally somebody else's experience their life their walk is not the definition for you it's between you and God come on friends that's why the enemy that's why the prophet tells us in greatest battle or fought he said I don't care if I prayed for 10,000 and they all fell dead I'd stand at the platform the next night and challenge the devil and pray for another 10,000 why because it isn't the outcome it is God gave his word God gave his word and God can not fail amen and perfect love it cast out all fear oh glory be to God this is why oh brother brandham he goes on to talk about that oh I know so and so had this disease I know so and so had this and I know they professed this and I know they they did this an amazing the devil knows how to quote all the negative he knows how to bring up everything along along the way and he his his objective is to get your mind oh you better be careful because I'll tell you I known of Believers and I known where's that coming from listen friends if there's anything that should dominate the house house of God anything that should dominate our lives should be the love of God this is why this is why God's grace comes to free us from slave slavish fear you know what you know what slavish fear is brought by traditions of man that elevate self self-righteousness rather than the righteousness of almighty God that's right hallu my my my I won't worry about that I'm not trying to hold on he held on for me he put a love in my heart that holds there there you go it's him holding me not me holding him if he if it was me holding him I'd probably turn loose but as long as he's holding me he will never turn loose he promised he wouldn't I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee Oh my he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but passed from Death unto life amen now in Matthew 6:25 the Lord Jesus would take many verses of scripture and I'm just going to pull a couple from here and we look at it tonight where he would admonish the Believers not just those disciples that were with him at the time of the Jews but remember he would Remish them because you know when he says for these things the Gentiles seeks the Lord Jesus never said in Matthew for these things the Jews seek you know why because we Gentiles were unaware of the covenants and the promises even though by by a hidden Mystery we were in at the whole time yes sir but you see for the Jews it was made known if you just put me first you serve me don't worry you don't have to go out here and fret and worry about this and worry about that you just put me first you serve me I'll take care of everything else for you is that right is that the scripture Deuteronomy 28 Leviticus 26 on and on God promised he would do that I know some of you thinking I don't know I'm a little bit worried about that Matthew 6:25 therefore I say unto you take no thought this word is dealing with anxious care for your life what you shall eat what you shall drink nor yet for your body what get you shall put on is not the life more than the meat and the body than rayment now the Lord Jesus is not saying don't even think about what you're going to eat don't think about what you're going to wear he's not saying that he's saying do not become worrisome in the place or tied up to where everything becomes anxious dwelling on this sir life itself life itself Beyond clothing Beyond food Beyond shelter on and on there are things that can be become worrisome is that right verse 34 jumping on down there he says take therefore no thought for the tomorrow for the tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof now probably everybody in here who's a bridge builder would say Amen Lord so be it Lord I'm going to send back all the bridge building material that I have ordered from Lowe's and they it in my yard cuz I've already built this bridge Lord for this situation at work I've already built this bridge and I'm going to say this and they're going to say this and they're going to do this and they're going to do this and right what is that worry is that right watch this verse 34 so do not same same verse but let me read it so do not worry or be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow will have worries and anxiety ities of its own will sufficient for each day is its own trouble oh but brother Samuel you you know the Bible says a prudent man foresee well off that's true in the context of this word we operate like our heavenly father he never brought forth day two before day one everything that God does today is making way to sustain what's coming on tomorrow do you realize even things that you are praying about maybe it's healing in your body maybe it's Deliverance do you realize God just does not give that and just say well here it is but he works to build our faith not just that it would be lifted but that there would be faith that when it has been lifted there is Faith when it wants to come back and say not welcome here is that right Oh My My My I just read that today of how brother bam talked about how one that was blind she came through the line they prayed for her oh she went rejoicing started speaking in another tongue in German and here she came right in just a moments the blindness right back on her that Spirit was on her again they cast it off again she came right right then and there the way brother Ram describes it but it came back on again you see it's got to be the faith that's there to withstand it oh I say Lord help us not to get impatient God knows what he's doing because listen God wants you and I as Sons and Daughters of God to stand with faith on his word that where when the Devil comes up like the big bad wolf and wants to blow his hot breath upon you and I were able to stand there without a worry and say but my father said so and I am a partaker of this word and there is a token you cannot step one one more foot on this ground that's right the message why you were made to be happy and free you were made to live like children before your father and know that he makes every day everything work right for each day so there'll be problems there'll be trouble there'll be things tomorrow but what good does it do me to sit here tonight and worry if I'm going to get caught in traffic tomorrow what good does it worry do me to sit here and say boy I hope they have that favorite cereal in stock or at least if it's at the store they put it on the shelves what good does it do oh I I hope I tell you and isin it funny how the enemy will drop certain things on you when you're getting ready to come to church to get your mind wondering you can be cleared down the block two lights down all the time that's right I wonder if the curling iron still on now you know the curling iron ain't for me I I wonder if the stove still on I want ain't it funny how those thoughts can come now come on every one of us have been guilty of that and it's not so much guilty nothing wrong because you know what there's a part of it we we already have come in a place to realize you know what I I may I may walk in late to service but I am not going to let that devil torment me on this right here so I'll go ahead and I'll go back home and I'll double check it because I'm going to the house of God and I'm not going to sit there like an empty shell and worry about things that might be here or might be there I am going to go and draw strength from elshad Ephesians 1:3 see when we're talking about getting scar out getting fear out getting worry out there's no greater antidote than the word of almighty God then to be able to recognize that you and I it is not you and I that has the control of our destiny you might say well his brother well brother brother Samuel he can't be pulling us along and pushing us through no but remember this is a drama that's already been acted out God never came down to earth hoping that if he came and shed his blood that there would be some people who might feel sorry for him you know like the movie the passion and feel sorry for just a measure of time and then take back up their old habits and going everything else no that is not what Calvary was about Calvary where was God himself came down and made provision that there could come a creative blood and by the humanity of God becoming one of us he could carry the pretu that was needed for you and I to release the Holy Ghost back into our lives that would bring an assurance now you know sometimes when we're going somewhere in the car and I we're on a trip or somewhere sometimes when we're on there and I'm looking at it and there's a destiny let's say it's a destiny maybe we're going to bluon maybe we're going down to Jeffersonville and I we've got that locked in and it tells me what time you're going to arrive well I know where my Destiny's at I know where I'm going but sometimes along the way I get a a need for an Americano I get a need for a coffee so I add a stop in there and that stop that I start evaluating Kim find out how far this is off find how far this off is off find where this is at see see where this is at and you know and you're looking now listen when I stop there to get a coffee that's not my destination it's just a stop along the way there's a lot of stops that we can have along the way sometimes when you're traveling with people there's unplanned stops is that right you stop this one you stop with this oh wait wait wait wait wait wait we passed up that rest area can we go back and stop at that I mean you keep on stopping stopping stopping stop but there's a lot of stops but still it doesn't change the destiny right so no matter how many stops you've had your destiny is unaltered I don't care how many hiccups you've had in a journey I don't care how many failures you've had your destiny is is unaltered you say how can that be cuz you cannot add or take away from the word of God and that's what real predestination brings in view that I was always a part of God oh my my my my oh brother Samuel if you're preaching like that people are going to get loose that's called worry ungodly worry and that very thing like that has caused people to go clear to the opposite way and preach in it you think good Lord can anybody make it aren't you glad for the Holy Ghost aren't you glad for the real Grace of almighty God my I'm a little head right now but Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love I'm glad it's this right here this choosing I'm glad it's not like it was when I was in elementary school and they lined us up against the wall all right count off by twos you know how this you're looking that guy can't kick it you know what I'm talking about that ain't what this choosing is this choosing took place before the foundation of the world we were always his we were in the loins of God's mind transferred down into the loins of Jesus come on now woo having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved brother says an angel of the Covenant one night this week the Lord willing I want to speak on God's unconditional Covenant perhaps he said tomorrow night you know it's it's nothing but just to build the faith of the people just to get them buil up to a place where it gets all the scare away from them and we're trying our best to do it now I want to ask you to raise your hands but probably there is probably still individuals here that are afraid of the dark I won't call no names either that's right but every one of us I am grateful especially when I'm in strange places I'm grateful that I know where the light switch is at because I don't want to stumble over certain things right and when that light comes on it takes all the fear away cuz you know where things are you know what to avoid you know how to walk around this you're not wondering I hope there isn't a dog toy in the floor hope there's not Legos you know some of those things that we as parents we have stepped on and still bear the marks in our body right some things that we but what does light do light helps you to avoid things it it REM what does it do it removes that of of the scare or of the worry brother BR goes on to say the Christian has not one worry in the world I know some of you are thinking we I need an update right now I I I want this right here I want I want this new update to fix that bug that's going on in my mind right now aren't you glad he's here to do that the Christian has not one worry in the world they should be the most freest happiest people in all the world because there's look at this you can't lose Lord have mercy you can't lose he has never been defeated he's never lost a battle the word has never been conquered the word has never been defeated and the same one that's never been defeated has put his right hand upon your life and said do not fear I am he who was dead and I'm alive forever more I have the keys of death Hell In The Grave a mighty conqueror letting you know you can't lose now I know this is simple I can only go by experiences God brings them to me but when I when I was in high school and and many of you know that I I played football one of the things that they would told us to do all through Friday our coach coach cookie told us he said look you got a game you got things to prepare for you need to start getting you need to get your mind right so you know being the kind of person I am that I don't like to joke around or nothing there was a lot of Temptations on them Fridays to cut up with buddies but the thing that I would have in my mind is is getting through that line and getting that quarterback right oh man catch them when their backs turned to you and there you know all those things and but that's what that what we were taught to me I'm so thankful for some of those things that just it taught me preparation within many things when we would go into pregame meal I told my boys I said as soon as you come in them doors you could hear a pin drop you weren't allowed to talk one iota you were not allowed to talk in the locker room you had to have your mind on your assignment and what you were going to be doing I think how fitting that it would be that how our mind that sometimes our mind can get on this our mind can get on that our mind can get on negative you you listen you're never going to get anywhere in Victory if you entertain the thought of defeat oh brother Samuel that's just mind over matter no it's different if we're talking about your thoughts I'm talking about the word thoughts I'm talking about the word you cannot find any defeat in the word amen and after all it's not my thoughts or your thoughts that has life in it it's the word that has life in it wo you can't lose all things work together for the good to them that love God so how can we lose there's just nothing nothing to lose is there we're just anchored away in Jesus Christ going home to glory having a good time while we're going along God providing everything for us marvelous you know I believe this so much that if I'm reading this quote right here I believe that the Holy Spirit can get a hold of a life and that life to say you know what that's what I want to I want to be a part of that Divine Assurance what is it the love of God Woos them right in yes sir oh notice he says I wish you Pentecostal people could see that and why some people can't keep Victory that's one thing you're short in that's what brings fear and trouble to you oh you say brother brandom I'm afraid you'll go off on the deep end of eternal security and all this what is that worry right this is why that even with things even that I might see things go this way extreme go this way extreme so God help me just to keep it right here in the middle of the road help me to keep it right here in the middle of the road why because it is just oh I see that going there so we're going to overcorrect you end up in the ditch over here are you hearing me you don't overcorrect because overcorrect it goes completely the wrong way just got to get it just line it up keep it right down the center keep it balanced right up that's what gives you and I stability in our lives Hallelujah watch this look how brother how look how brother answers it you don't have to worry about that if you keep your heart in the Bible it won't that's that's simple our heart staying in the word of God God has changed our desires now let me just let me just try to move here on this on just a part of this try to bring it down to a place here for us tonight in um 2 Timothy 1:7 now watch this for God hath not given us the spirit of fear so so any time that we find feel that encroachment that didn't come from God this is discernment but this is the spirit that God has given us of power of love and of a sound mind Romans 8:15 for ye have not re to come with worry you push it back away oh we found a little spot here well it might have been a fly that got on your machine I'm not making light of these things but I'm saying look look how things come and it comes to test us and we're not careful we will get in such a place of worry those feelings are normal I hope you understand me tonight I do not belittle no one from my family to anybody else here for you having worry cuz I tell you the truth a lot of times the people that want to do those things well you shouldn't have worry you should have fear if you go to looking up things that they've done in their life when they oh I got a little pain right here I got oh what about that worry now what about stopping worry where's where's that where's that big Faith at now I'm not trying to be running anybody down but I'm just trying to say listen we're all still in this Humanity some of us are geared a little bit more differently than others you take for example a lot of times maybe our sister sometimes can be more prone to that the prophet said they operate on a different emotional level than what we do as men and for all the married Brothers you don't have to say Amen but you know it's true or anybody that has daughter or daughters you know it's true so don't say amen I don't want no rocks being thrown tonight but notice we understand those things even sometimes we even as men and other things can be prone to those things but yet God gives you and I the grace that's needed to be able to press and push these things out of our life there's no way in the world that I'm going to even get close to it tonight maybe even not next Thursday but I can go through numerous moments of times in the prophet's life where there was worry that sprung up and God gave him Grace you know what that shows me God was showing me along the journey boy you're going to have times of worry there's going to be fear coming along the way but I want you to know not I've said it my grace is sufficient but I am using an example in this age so you can see it for your own life I'm glad it I'm glad it wasn't you or me because maybe for us we have man wanting to make oursel with edit that part out of that tape edit that part out we only want it to be what's that a form of worry how am I going to be perceived Lord have mercy but you know friends let me I'm trying let me just try to get to a spot where I can stop tonight their emotions that we can face from time to time but but never never never never should it become a resident in our lifeall if it becomes a resident or a squatter that's so good then we we have a right with divine grace to go before God and evict the squatter oh brother Samuel that that couldn't happen well the scripture tells us that we are to tear down strongholds the Bible tells us to give no place to the enemy I'm quoting out of Paul's letters so if he says don't do it that means you can do it if he tells us tear down strongholds that tells me strongholds can be built do you realize sometimes it is taken it took I'm my my daddy blessed his heart he's went on home to be with the Lord but you know my dad he had a situation it took place over there I think it was on West 50 55th or West 25th over there where they brought in them student dentist and things like that and my dad talked about he said here he put them things on my tooth he said to pull out my tooth he said and I was out in the floor with him having a hold on that tooth he tried it again almost sounds like three stoes or something but he said here it is he said it tried it again from that time Mom I I don't know how old dad was 20 22 maybe 23 I could prank my dad by calling our answering machine and changing my voice and saying Mr Browning this is to remind you of your dental appointment at such and such my dad would look at me and say Samuel you didn't you didn't he didn't want to go you know why he was afraid that experience brought fear but you know what God gave him Grace to overcome that fear later in his life but I'm just trying to show you little things like that that sometimes that we worry about you let somebody say something oh I tell you what don't go to this Hospital you go to this Hospital sure as the world they're going to put you in a casket what does it do spreads right through worry that's right that's so these are real life things friends oh brother Samuel I'm and listen we're talking about applying the word and letting the word as a son and daughter of God being victorious in our life over these things because listen they're going to come but God gives us Grace to stand against them now watch this in the message the True Vine and a false Vine brother BR says I see now to this woman that's standing near she has a real dismal funny spirit it's a spirit of worry fearful she's all nervous and upset and she's bothered a lot with a nervous condition so what is worry it's a spirit a spirit of worry it's about a condition of her body that she's worrying about she's planning on an examination at a clinic kind of a hospital clinic or Affair for cancer it's a cancer that you're worried about and you was praying just before coming here it was revealed to you as you were praying that if you would come here and I would pray for you that they'd find no cancer and he goes on to tell where she's come from and he says you're going to get the desire of your heart you have it right now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may it be received in jesus' name God bless you Sister go happy and rejoicing my my my don't you love him Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Bria going down to that quote 1956 the resurrection of Jesus let me just let me close on this Ram says if you notice it's when you are discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you that's when he gets you if you come to church and say well I don't know I don't know whether I'll ever get any better or not I've been prayed for twice oh my you might as well go home that's all but when you can cast that aside once again acting like your father what did he do in heaven cast him out casting him out God don't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset just walk in his love amen well how do I walk in his love I love this next quote knowing that your you're walking in him nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you there's neither Powers things present things future nothing can separate us from him we're in him and we never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and brought us into him so it's his business to take care of what he's took his no man can pluck them from my father's hand cuz he's the greatest of all of them it's the father who takes care of it who's got any more power than God so what kind of a power have you got over to take care of you that's a pretty simple question what kind of power do you have to take care of yourself nothing of your own accord the whole powers that created the universe that took the solar system and said blew it like that every Star went to its place and he watches over you that's the kind of father Lord that we have that's the kind of father that we have lot of things that can be presented to us the Bible tells us of how the disciples they were out on the sea they were out in the boat storm arose Jesus was asleep in it and they woke him up don't you care that we perish Jesus said oh why are you fearful oh ye of little faith and he spoke to the condition remember he is the word he spoke the word and not only did it calm the storm it calmed the waves he was there the whole time and the situation arose all they needed to do was wake him up listen the same God that created the heavens in the Earth the same God that brought you and I here that same God a part of you that have the Holy Ghost he's living right inside of your life all that have need of when worries come they will come fears come they will come but you have within you what's needed to be able to face those worries and be able to face those fears it doesn't mean that you're going to have that you would have the the answer right away or that but you just know I can't lose I'm in him I can't lose there is no defeat within him I don't know how this is going to come out but the prophet has told us in one of many places in the message that I just read from it's not my business to know how I don't need to God didn't ask me hey figure out how this is going to be no it's to trust him is to trust him I say God let everything within me Amen Let me just step aside from all worries and Fears let me step away all that I know of things that would be presented to me as the word would deal with my life I want to distance myself turn from that and Lord fill me with more of your love fill me with more of your love can I read one more thing to you let me close on this right here I'm just going to skip ahead just and you'll have a little bit of idea I look this up here sometimes you know there's things that I'll look up and and look at it and if I feel L on my heart and the Lord will press it so I just looked it up what are some of the biggest things that is worried about and these are some things and I'm just I I'll close here after this some of the top 10 fears it's on down there Brian I don't know if you've got it yet the top 10 fears that hold people back in life now I started reading these and I can tell you right now it was just quotes and scriptures for these things change a lot of us don't like change true they tell you on Friday morning there's going to be some things we're going to be doing different here loneliness failure rejection true uncertainty something bad happening getting hurt right being judged inadequate and a loss of freedom I looked at those things and I thought my Lord just as the Lord just started to deal with that but I'm not going to go there tonight but just within every one of those little things all of a sudden begin to come this begin to come this and begin to come that and look I'm glad that God looks to you and I and says he don't just say don't worry but he tells us don't worry let's go down into those things that you're worrying about let me come down in that area let me come down into that what you're uncertain about let me come into that area whatever whatever the fears are let me come in that area because wherever light is at it presses back Darkness Hallelujah so just with that little bit tonight why should I worry why should I worry what has he ever failed to deliver I'm glad for his grace because you realize a lot of times some of these things I just read right here at the end it can cause decisions to be made and they're made outside of the word of God rather than being made on God's word we'll make it based on our worry aren't you glad let me just drop one little one I'm not going to read it but just so you can see I'm not just out here in the Stars Moses knew humanity and he was there before the burning bush and he asked God time after time and he says they ain't going to believe me right they ain't going to believe me what is it he's worried cuz he knows Humanity because he knows his own self he also knows I've been rejected before for saying the same thing worry but aren't you glad that God didn't look at him and say you old worry Ward I should have got somebody else but God likes to take our weaknesses amen amen and get it to where they come all out and then he just pours himself [Laughter] in Why Should I Worry Why Should I Worry hallu amen I say tonight just give it all to him any worry any fear just say Lord I just invite you just let me just get filled up Lord a fresh refilling of the love of God Amen you're loving tonight am let's stand to our feet amen amen hallelujah brother Brian do you sing that song why should we Why Should I Worry can you come up and sing it please the Lord you weren't planing on this but I don't know I guess there's a mic there amen oh I just just love the Lord I tell you there's nothing about it where the peace of God comes into a heart and a life it releases us from all the that worry as far as our destiny and that's that that's the main thing that that's the main thing right there for that to be released that I know and whom I have believed that's that's the main but

stood before him and and In Their Fear when their fear and their worry was made known they it was uncovered in his presence he's never thrown the towel on one didn't throw it on Gideon didn't throw it
