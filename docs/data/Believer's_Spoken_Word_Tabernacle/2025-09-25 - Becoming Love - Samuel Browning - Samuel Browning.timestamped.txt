[34:48] Thank you, Lord.
[34:50] Let's just go to him in a word of prayer
[34:52] here tonight.
[34:55] Amen. Let's just join our hearts
[34:57] together. We have so much to be thankful
[34:59] for.
[35:02] Heavenly Father,
[35:04] how precious, oh Lord, as the words of
[35:08] that song, oh God, was born out of
[35:11] experience
[35:13] from another believer. And we, Lord,
[35:15] from our hearts can testify of the same,
[35:18] Lord. It is so sweet to trust you, Lord
[35:23] God.
[35:24] Lord,
[35:28] it all comes back, Lord, that as Paul
[35:31] would write, we are your workmanship.
[35:34] It's you, Lord, that is moved on our
[35:37] hearts, Lord, that would just your God
[35:41] would create a faith in our hearts. You
[35:44] would make yourself known to us, Lord,
[35:47] in such simplicity,
[35:49] Lord, that faith could begin to take
[35:51] hold,
[35:53] Lord.
[35:55] We never found you. You found us.
[36:00] You came to where we were.
[36:03] And you made yourself known to us, Lord.
[36:08] Oh, God. How we are so thankful
[36:11] cuz we could not have found our own way,
[36:14] Lord.
[36:16] But I'm thankful, Lord, that you
[36:18] revealed yourself to us.
[36:21] I'm your way. I'm your way back. Oh God,
[36:25] how we thank you. Lord,
[36:28] Lord Jesus,
[36:30] throughout standing in this building
[36:32] tonight, Lord, there's so many
[36:34] testimonies,
[36:35] so many hearts and lives. And Lord,
[36:38] every one of us, Lord, can give witness
[36:40] of how that your grace has been more
[36:43] than enough through every test and every
[36:46] trial, Lord. Oh God, how we are so
[36:50] thankful, Lord. We're so thankful, God,
[36:53] for your working in our lives. So
[36:56] thankful, Lord,
[36:59] for your mercy. We ask that you would
[37:01] just once again, Lord, just come among
[37:04] us in a special way tonight. You know
[37:06] the needs, Lord. There's different ones,
[37:09] Lord, just not able to be here, Lord,

[37:44] family. Lord, may you move, Lord, for
[37:46] that young man, Lord. I don't know what
[37:47] his age might be. That really is
[37:49] irrelevant, Lord God. But you see,
[37:52] Father, how the enemy, Lord, has wanted
[37:54] to attack him, Lord. I ask, oh God, that
[37:57] may the angels of Almighty God, Lord,

[38:22] Jesus Christ.
[38:24] Amen.
[38:27] Amen. God bless you. And thank you,
[38:29] musicians.
[38:31] Amen.
[38:34] Amen. So good to be together here once
[38:36] again. And I want to just read here from
[38:39] a few portions of scripture. And
[38:44] as we just prepare to look into the word
[38:46] of the Lord and Amen. There's just
[38:49] nothing like just an opportunity to be
[38:51] able to come together and just to be
[38:53] able to amen to feast on the word of
[38:57] God. Amen.
[39:00] Amen. 1 John chapter 3
[39:03] and verse 11. You know what I love about
[39:05] coming and putting our feet under the
[39:07] table is, you know, it's just little
[39:09] things you, you know, in in God's word
[39:11] that all of a sudden God will just send
[39:13] a brother by and he'll point something
[39:15] out. And one thing I love is I heard a
[39:17] brother mention about
[39:20] uh one of David's um Saul's
[39:25] sons uh that was there, one of those
[39:27] that had left over, you know, that
[39:29] actually had the the crippledness in his
[39:31] feet. But when he came to the what was
[39:34] the name?
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, we'll get I'm not going to
[39:38] try to pronounce that right now. But at
[39:40] any rate, I think we all we all know.
[39:42] But this is the thing to me that I I
[39:43] just it just you know, it just struck
[39:45] me. I heard it months and months ago,
[39:47] but you know, when David invited him to
[39:49] his table, when you got under when you
[39:52] was at the table, his crippledness
[39:55] &gt;&gt; was under the table.
[39:57] What was on the table was the meal and
[39:59] the meat. And I'm thankful there's a
[40:02] place where every bit of our lameness
[40:04] and our crippledness and things is not
[40:06] just hidden, but it's right there where
[40:08] God can take care of every situation.
[40:11] Amen. Where everything is just right
[40:13] out. Amen. Amen. Before God. Amen. To
[40:17] give us the strength and encouragement
[40:18] we need. Let's look here in verse 11.
[40:21] For this is the message that ye have
[40:23] heard from the beginning, that we should
[40:25] love one another, not as Cain, who was
[40:30] of that wicked one, and slew his
[40:33] brother. Now watch how Paul John writes
[40:36] this. Wherefore slew he him, because his
[40:40] own works were evil, and his brothers
[40:45] righteous.
[40:46] You know that, you know where this
[40:47] happened? Right in church.
[40:50] Yeah,
[40:52] &gt;&gt; that's where everything set in at first.
[40:54] Brother Bam, we'll go through that over
[40:55] and over. Jealousy set in because what
[40:58] Cain saw is how God accepted Abel's
[41:02] sacrifice
[41:04] and then jealousy set in in his life. So
[41:07] the reason that he did what he did is
[41:09] because his own works were evil and his
[41:11] brothers were righteous. Now watch verse
[41:14] 13. Marvel not, my brethren, if the
[41:16] world hate you. We know that we have
[41:20] passed from death unto life because we
[41:24] love the brethren. I want you to just
[41:26] watch this scripture here tonight. We
[41:29] know we have passed from death unto life
[41:31] because we love the brethren. He that
[41:35] loveth not his brother abideth in death.
[41:39] Now notice John's writing about the
[41:41] brethren.
[41:43] How many believe that the love of God is
[41:45] something to be expressed to all? Amen.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; But it's just like in your family, among
[41:51] your children, the love that you have to
[41:53] them is on a different degree than it is
[41:58] to somebody else's children.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; So this awareness would be where John
[42:03] would write of this and John's one that
[42:05] would write over and over through the
[42:06] chapters about the love to the brethren.
[42:09] So there must be something about it in
[42:11] this fellowship what we would be uh
[42:15] partaking of that there would be a
[42:17] communion of fellowship and even within
[42:20] that there would actually be a
[42:22] declaration from our hearts that indeed
[42:25] we are abiding in eternal life because
[42:27] we love the brethren.
[42:32] So it's not just love. You know, many
[42:34] people can talk about love and say we
[42:36] have love and there's many pe you know
[42:38] no doubt many people there's no doubt
[42:40] people on your job and you're thankful
[42:41] for they're lovely.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; I mean who who likes I mean I I like
[42:45] working with people that are lovely,
[42:47] &gt;&gt; right? I mean appreciate when I go to
[42:48] the mountain meat counter or wherever I
[42:50] go and in a store or whatever more. I
[42:52] appreciate people that are lovely.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; You appreciate that. But this is
[42:56] something that we're not just talking
[42:58] about lovely, but we're talking about
[43:01] that absolutely agape love. Now, he that
[43:04] loveth not his brother abideth in death.
[43:06] In verse 15, whosoever hateth his
[43:09] brother is a murderer, and you know that
[43:12] no murderer hath eternal life abiding in
[43:16] him.
[43:18] Verse 23, if we'll skip there. And this
[43:21] is the commandment that we should
[43:23] believe on the name of the son Jesus
[43:27] Christ and love one another as he gave
[43:31] us commandment. Now watch how John
[43:33] continues to bring this together because
[43:36] a person could say, "Well, I love the
[43:38] brethren." But John continues to bring
[43:40] this down by the spirit of God that
[43:42] whosoever would believe on the name. So
[43:45] what is the name? Well, the name is
[43:47] Jesus Christ. But what is the name? The
[43:50] name is his own life. The Bible tells us
[43:54] in the book of Revelation, his name is
[43:57] called, not is, but is called the word
[44:00] of God. So how does God reveal his name?
[44:04] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[44:05] forever. How does he do that? By
[44:07] revealing his word. And he reveals
[44:10] himself to his children. So it's God
[44:14] revealing his name. And there's no
[44:16] situation, no need, no condition that's
[44:19] beyond or above the name of Jesus
[44:21] Christ.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; When you've received the spirit of God
[44:25] in your life, do you realize that the
[44:27] name of Jesus Christ has been exalted in
[44:30] your life and in your spirits?
[44:33] &gt;&gt; It's been exalted above whatever you
[44:35] were before and every past. It's been
[44:37] exalted above everything within the
[44:39] family. Let me read this again. that we
[44:41] should believe on the name of his son
[44:44] Jesus Christ and love one another as he
[44:47] gave us commandment. Now what John
[44:49] brings these two things together and he
[44:52] that keepeth his commandments dwelleth
[44:54] in him and he in him and hereby we know
[44:58] that he abideth in us by the spirit
[45:02] which he hath given us. Amen. May God
[45:05] bless you and bless the reading of the
[45:07] word as you're being seated.
[45:09] I want to speak on becoming love.
[45:15] And we've been looking at pursuing the
[45:18] right thing, but I want to begin to work
[45:22] and begin to drop this part in here on
[45:26] becoming love. There's some different
[45:28] things that we've touched on that if the
[45:30] Lord would help us here even over the
[45:32] coming weeks of different parts that if
[45:34] as he would see fit for us to look at
[45:36] here. But I think that when we look at
[45:39] this on becoming love, even as John
[45:43] would write of this down through the
[45:44] scriptures, as we said, there's many
[45:46] times where we can read in 1 Corinthians
[45:49] 13 where Paul would express of what
[45:52] charity is. And yet there's many times
[45:55] where even some of those attributes of
[45:57] what charity would produce,
[45:59] longsuffering, it doesn't keep any
[46:01] records and so forth and so on. All of
[46:04] those things is what is an actual
[46:06] product of charity, of the love of God
[46:10] being in our lives. So, it isn't
[46:12] something that we're just as though
[46:14] we're striving to do this, we're
[46:16] striving to do that, but it's it's
[46:19] actually deeper than us just, you know,
[46:21] wanting to be lovely. It's more than
[46:24] God. When God begins to speak to us
[46:26] about the love of God, he's actually
[46:28] talking to us about his own life, who he
[46:31] is, and who we really are to become.
[46:35] Because if we are sons and daughters of
[46:37] God here tonight, how many believe
[46:39] you're son and daughter of God?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Then as a son and daughter of God, you
[46:43] you never had a beginning. You were
[46:45] always eternal with God.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; But you've come into this life into
[46:51] time. And then God by his spirit comes
[46:54] to manifest or reveal that part that was
[46:59] always in him as a son and daughter of
[47:01] God. And that expression comes out that
[47:04] not only do we love the brethren, but we
[47:07] also are walking right in step and have
[47:10] a love for the word because we cannot
[47:13] love our brother and not love the word.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; It it won't work. were not then we could
[47:19] love our brother but it's not the right
[47:20] degree because the only in order to
[47:23] actually have that right kind of love it
[47:25] would have to be agape love because
[47:27] there's been times we can look back over
[47:29] our lives and think of many people that
[47:31] we enjoyed being around and so forth but
[47:34] you just let conditions change just let
[47:36] friendships change just let something to
[47:38] where that you maybe have to write them
[47:40] up you have you cross them in some way
[47:42] on the job or something happens and all
[47:45] of a sudden you're being snubbed Am
[47:49] I right?
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Those are things what happens the
[47:52] conditions changed. But see this is why
[47:55] we needed something deeper than just our
[47:58] felio love because felio love is simply
[48:01] based on that of conditions. That's why
[48:04] we need more than that even in our
[48:05] marriages because in just in our
[48:07] marriages yet we will love our spouses
[48:10] with felio love. But if there's not the
[48:12] agape love that's down that's back there
[48:14] behind that that's able to put that into
[48:17] its right place and actually be the
[48:19] source of motivation then all it takes
[48:22] is conditions to change and then
[48:26] situations begin to move apart. See,
[48:29] this is why that even as we look at this
[48:31] and I I don't I'm just I know I'm kind
[48:33] of off here right now, but we understand
[48:35] that conditions themselves, we've been
[48:37] looking at that conditions themselves
[48:40] will change with time. We can see that
[48:42] right among us even as as husband and
[48:45] wife and there's things that will
[48:46] change. There's little idiosyncrasies
[48:49] and then there's even situations that
[48:51] change in life. The prophet tells us
[48:53] every seven years we go through a
[48:55] change. He tells us there's two major
[48:57] changes in the message indictment.
[48:59] There's the change from that going into
[49:02] uh that of a young young lady, a young
[49:04] man and then there's a little change
[49:05] later in life and going into that of a
[49:09] you know an older as we get older and
[49:11] different changes. All these things are
[49:13] changing even in our body. Certain
[49:14] things change even about us. That's why
[49:16] there's got to be something that is
[49:19] constant
[49:23] that will give us grace that when
[49:25] certain things change,
[49:28] God remains the same because he said,
[49:32] "I'm God and I change not." So in
[49:36] looking at this on becoming love, let me
[49:39] just read here a quote to you out of
[49:41] broken sistns.
[49:44] Brother Brham is talking about to
[49:45] brother veil him and brother veil were
[49:47] discussing on what you know maybe the
[49:49] evidence of the Holy Ghost is and
[49:51] brother Brandham you know when they're
[49:53] talking about it at one point brother
[49:55] Vale was actually you know looking at it
[49:57] and saying I I just can't I just can't
[49:59] see it speak being speaking in tongues
[50:00] and brother Bram said I can't see that
[50:02] either and he said you know he says I
[50:04] I'm never taught that and neither do I
[50:06] he says but the only thing brother Bram
[50:08] says the most perfect evidence that I
[50:10] could think of now this is 1964 you can
[50:12] see that over
[50:13] this is the most perfect evidence I
[50:15] could think of is love. So we got to
[50:17] talking on that and then I thought that
[50:19] sounded pretty good. So I just held that
[50:22] if a man has got love. But one day the
[50:28] Lord in a vision straightened me out.
[50:31] And he said the evidence of the spirit
[50:34] was those who could receive the word.
[50:37] Neither love nor speaking in tongues but
[50:40] it's receiving the word
[50:43] &gt;&gt; then then then Dr. prevail was saying to
[50:47] me that's scriptural. John 14, many of
[50:49] you are coming back to mind. John 14,
[50:51] John 16, John 15. When he the Holy Ghost
[50:54] has come upon you, he will reveal these
[50:56] things to you that I've taught you and
[50:58] you will and will show you things to
[51:00] come. So there is the genuine evidence
[51:03] of the Holy Ghost. He has never told me
[51:06] anything wrong yet. That is the evidence
[51:09] of the Holy Ghost is he who can believe
[51:12] the word, you can receive it. Brother
[51:15] Ram says because Jesus never said when
[51:18] the Holy Ghost has come you'll speak
[51:20] with tongues. He never said the Holy
[51:23] Ghost come you never do any of those
[51:25] things. But he said he will take these
[51:27] things of mine and show them to you and
[51:31] will show you things that is to come. So
[51:34] there is the genuine evidence of the
[51:36] Holy Ghost according to Jesus himself.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:42] So when we look at this here, this
[51:45] portion within the scripture, John is
[51:48] not writing and being contradictory at
[51:51] all because remember the Lord Jesus, he
[51:53] said, "A new commandment I give you that
[51:56] you would love one another as I have
[51:59] loved you." Now remember who he's
[52:01] speaking to. He's speaking to that of
[52:04] the disciples that are gathered
[52:06] together. And by this all men will know
[52:10] that you are my disciples. Well, who is
[52:13] he? He is the word. Is that right? So
[52:17] all men will know by the expression of
[52:20] divine love that we are disciples of the
[52:24] living word. Because in order the the
[52:28] actual product of being a disciple of
[52:31] the living word is to follow that word
[52:34] will also be to recognize that other
[52:37] part of the word that lays within each
[52:40] and every son and daughter of God.
[52:43] Because every son and daughter of God
[52:45] all the way down through the ages, we
[52:47] were called to take our place in the
[52:50] body of Jesus Christ. Everyone has your
[52:54] allotted part within that. Every elect
[52:57] seed of God, you're a part of that word,
[52:59] that word to be expressed. This is why
[53:02] that the prophet would say it over and
[53:03] over. He said, "I could preach a
[53:05] Lutheran message, but it would never
[53:07] take an effect upon you." Wesley's
[53:10] message, it'll never take effect upon
[53:12] you. Pentecostal's message, it'll never
[53:14] take effect on you. But there had to
[53:16] come the message that God in that was
[53:20] that was intended for this hour and this
[53:23] season. There would be a seed on the
[53:25] earth that was ordained to receive the
[53:28] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that
[53:31] would be poured out in this hour. And
[53:33] when I say the Holy Spirit, I'm talking
[53:35] about the word because the Holy Ghost
[53:37] and the word are not two separate
[53:39] things. This is why that when the Holy
[53:42] Spirit, a person has actually been
[53:44] baptized with the Holy Ghost, been
[53:46] sealed away with the spirit of God, it
[53:49] has now become a portion or a part of
[53:51] the word expressed in their life. So
[53:54] what is inside of your life being
[53:56] expressed? It is a part of the word for
[53:59] this day. So when that has happened,
[54:01] there's no way that out of that life
[54:04] that a life that's actually been
[54:06] spiritfilled where the spirit of God has
[54:08] sealed it. There's absolutely no way
[54:10] that there could come out anything from
[54:12] that life besides an amen to the word of
[54:16] God.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; If it comes out any other way, whether
[54:19] it's an attribute of unbelief and oh,
[54:22] you don't have to do this and you don't
[54:23] have to do that. It it doesn't matter
[54:25] how many baptisms they've had on their
[54:28] spirit.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; What matters is has it ever come to that
[54:33] soul to where they love God more than
[54:37] anything else. And when they love God
[54:39] more than anything else, and I'm not
[54:41] talking about just loving a thought or a
[54:44] concept. God is not a figment of our
[54:47] imagination. He is the word. And how
[54:50] does he reveal himself and make himself
[54:53] known as the same yesterday, today, and
[54:55] forever. I'm God and I change not. His
[54:58] nature does not change. How does God
[55:00] reveal himself? He reveals himself in
[55:03] the form of the word. Think about it.
[55:06] walking on the road to Emmas. When he
[55:08] was there with them, their eyes were
[55:11] withholden that they should know him.
[55:13] Now, the prophet says in one place, he
[55:15] said they had a little bit of an idea
[55:17] that it was him. But you see, we needed
[55:20] more than just a a perhaps or a maybe or
[55:23] a I presume or I think. But God wanted
[55:26] them to have a certainty. And there's no
[55:28] other place that you can rest your faith
[55:30] in than the word of God. And so what he
[55:33] did has God himself moving down there
[55:36] and through the resurrection of the Lord
[55:38] Jesus, he so established their faith in
[55:42] God's work of the atonement to where
[55:45] when it came time for their
[55:47] corresponding part to go into the upper
[55:50] room. They did not go in there with
[55:52] uncertainty. They went in there with a
[55:54] certainty knowing that God has fulfilled
[55:57] his word. And that part that belongs to
[56:00] me, God has made a way that then now
[56:04] this word regarding what Joel said that
[56:07] he would pour out the Holy Ghost and the
[56:09] spirit of God would actually be able to
[56:12] come through the opening of the blood
[56:14] that was shed back upon the worshipper
[56:16] and bring the worshipper back into that
[56:19] place of perfection of fellowship with
[56:22] God. The Bible says they went to the
[56:24] upper room with joy. Now let me just
[56:27] tell you, you don't come to get the Holy
[56:29] Ghost with sadness or uncertainty. Yes,
[56:31] within our hearts, yes, there should be
[56:34] conviction. There's grieving. But let me
[56:36] just say this to you. You come with a
[56:38] thanksgiving that first of all that God
[56:40] has revealed himself to you to be the
[56:43] same. And if he's done that, that's a
[56:45] sure sign right there that if God's
[56:48] making himself known to you that he's
[56:50] the same, that's a sure sign that the
[56:52] Holy Ghost is for you. The Bible said,
[56:54] "Blessed are they who do hunger and
[56:57] thirst after righteousness. They shall
[56:59] be filled." Brother Brown, why am I
[57:01] hungering this way? He said, "It's a
[57:03] sure sign. The Holy Ghost is upon you,
[57:06] and it's God leading you to receive it."
[57:09] You see, God doesn't want to confuse us.
[57:12] He wants to build our faith because
[57:14] after all, the Holy Ghost is the seal of
[57:17] God accepting our faith. Think about
[57:19] that. It's God who's actually the one
[57:22] revealing himself to you and I. His
[57:25] loving kindness. It's his mercy. And
[57:27] what does it do? It raises our faith.
[57:29] And God steps in at that moment. What is
[57:31] God doing? God is actually honoring the
[57:34] effects of his love being expressed to
[57:37] our life and there being that part
[57:40] that's caught back and God recognizes.
[57:42] You know what God is saying? He's saying
[57:43] the same thing that he said regarding
[57:45] Abel's sacrifice. When Abel and Cain
[57:48] came before the gate, when God looked at
[57:51] Cain's sacrifice, all he could see was
[57:53] Cain. But when God looked at Abel's
[57:55] sacrifice, he couldn't see Abel. He saw
[57:58] himself. And God honored that sacrifice.
[58:02] And Abel obtained a witness that he was
[58:05] righteous. Righteous by what? The
[58:08] revelation that it was blood that took
[58:10] him out. And it must be blood of an
[58:13] innocent one bring them back in. So Abel
[58:16] was a worshshiper hidden beneath the
[58:18] blood because revelation had made a way
[58:21] for him to come back into fellowship
[58:23] with God.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; So here within this God is love. The
[58:31] Bible tells us God is love. And I put
[58:33] that scripture there because John 1:1
[58:35] says, "In the beginning was the word."
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; And the word was with God.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; And the word was God. Yes.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; So God is love and God is the word.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; They come and they operate. It works
[58:50] together. Now I want you just to think
[58:52] of this in the scripture here in 1 John
[58:54] chapter 4 and verse six. We are of God.
[58:58] I love that.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Can we just say that together?
[59:02] &gt;&gt; We are of God.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; He that knoweth God heareth us. It has a
[59:09] meaning to them. This isn't just, oh,
[59:11] you know, uh, you know, I got to go to
[59:13] church and I, but it has a meaning to
[59:15] us. And, and the word, it has a meaning.
[59:17] You say, what do you mean it has a
[59:18] meaning? It's something that stirs our
[59:20] heart that we just can't get enough of
[59:23] God. This word, it has a meaning to us.
[59:26] It isn't just gibberish. It isn't just
[59:28] something that's just being said, but
[59:30] it's it's it's a word. It has meaning.
[59:32] It has substance to our lives.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. He
[59:36] &gt;&gt; that is not of God heareth us. Heareth
[59:38] not us. Hereby we know the spirit of
[59:41] truth and the spirit of error. Wow, we
[59:43] don't need that. We don't need to hear
[59:44] that. We don't need But you see, if
[59:46] there's something that is God in his
[59:48] grace has given you the ability to hear,
[59:50] it's not you. It's not you your ability,
[59:54] but God has given you the ability to
[59:56] hear. The Bible said over and over
[59:58] through every one of those ages, he that
[1:00:00] hath an ear, let him hear what the
[1:00:04] spirit saith to the church.
[1:00:07] God giving his revelation and direction.
[1:00:09] Now watch this. Verse seven. Beloved,
[1:00:11] let us love one another. For love is of
[1:00:15] God.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; And everyone that loveth is born of God
[1:00:20] and knoweth God. Now watch how John goes
[1:00:24] on. He that loveth not knoweth not God.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; For God is love. In this was manifested
[1:00:31] the love of God toward us because that
[1:00:34] God sent his only begotten son into the
[1:00:37] world that we might live through him.
[1:00:40] Here in his love, not that we loved God,
[1:00:44] but that he loved us
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; and he sent his son to be the
[1:00:48] propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if
[1:00:51] God so loved us, we ought also to love
[1:00:55] one another. No man hath seen God at any
[1:00:58] time. And if we love one another, God
[1:01:01] dwelleth in us and his love is perfected
[1:01:04] in us. Look, notice that. This is some
[1:01:07] very incredible statements here. If I
[1:01:10] can, if I if you would allow me to say
[1:01:11] it in that way, it's a litmus test. It
[1:01:14] is something that that checks cuz you
[1:01:16] know, you could sample the water and say
[1:01:18] it don't taste very acidic. Let somebody
[1:01:20] else who's a little bit more sensitive,
[1:01:22] they'll say, "Oh, no, it's very acidic."
[1:01:24] But there's one way to tell it is put an
[1:01:27] actual strip, a litmus test on it and
[1:01:30] that'll tell. The litmus test will not
[1:01:32] lie. So when we consider this, if we
[1:01:35] love one another, God dwelleth in us and
[1:01:38] his spirit is perfected in us. Hereby
[1:01:42] know we that we dwell in him and he in
[1:01:44] us because he hath given us of his
[1:01:47] spirit. So a person could read right
[1:01:49] there and no doubt many have. But
[1:01:51] remember the word is not disjointed. It
[1:01:54] is complimentary. It goes together. And
[1:01:56] to recognize that the word, God is the
[1:01:59] word. And it was the word that actually
[1:02:01] began to condensed to become one of us
[1:02:05] in redemption. What brought him down was
[1:02:08] his love, his desire for fellowship, his
[1:02:12] love for his fallen creation. Why was it
[1:02:14] in the beginning? God never sent an
[1:02:16] angel when the fall took place in the
[1:02:18] beginning. But God himself came down in
[1:02:21] the garden. And remember when they were
[1:02:23] going out, how many times you hear,
[1:02:25] brother Brandham, dramatize it when they
[1:02:27] were going out and God made and took the
[1:02:29] clan the the skins of an innocent one
[1:02:32] and threw them back in there so they
[1:02:34] could take those skins and put them on
[1:02:36] and stand in his presence. And as they
[1:02:38] walked out of the garden, the B brother
[1:02:40] Ram tells us, he said, "How that great
[1:02:43] pillar of cloud, it came down and begin
[1:02:46] to spell Lo V.
[1:02:49] I will make a way back for you."
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; And to think about it, God wasn't going
[1:02:55] to give us some way, but the way back to
[1:02:58] being a son and daughter of God would
[1:03:01] actually require God himself to become
[1:03:05] one of us. Amen.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; There is no other way for us to get back
[1:03:09] there than other than for God to become
[1:03:12] one of us and make a way and open the
[1:03:15] way back for you and I. What did that
[1:03:17] for you and I? Certainly not because we
[1:03:19] deserved it. You might say, "Well, we
[1:03:21] were always sons and daughters of God."
[1:03:23] But let me remind you, the condition
[1:03:25] that we were living in, some of us could
[1:03:28] not even get along with our own selves,
[1:03:30] much less anybody else. So, who in the
[1:03:33] world sweetened you and I? who in the
[1:03:35] world God through and by his grace
[1:03:38] coming down and his life coming and
[1:03:40] dealing with our hearts, he begins to
[1:03:42] deal on your heart, you begin to receive
[1:03:44] a new heart. You begin to receive a new
[1:03:46] spirit. Still not filled with the spirit
[1:03:48] of God yet, but God says from those two
[1:03:51] things, then I will put my spirit right
[1:03:55] in the midst of your being.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Well, what is that new heart? What is
[1:04:00] that new spirit? It's a portion of the
[1:04:02] Holy Spirit. it now when the Holy Spirit
[1:04:04] himself has come. It has now been
[1:04:07] portion after portion now leads to the
[1:04:09] very Holy Spirit himself coming to dwell
[1:04:13] in the house that he's cleaned up and
[1:04:15] set aside for himself. So notice this,
[1:04:18] no man hath seen God at any time. And if
[1:04:21] we love one another, God dwelleth in us
[1:04:24] and his love is perfected in us. So So a
[1:04:27] person could actually say, well, you
[1:04:28] know, I I I love everybody. I love
[1:04:31] everybody. And you know what? You
[1:04:32] couldn't dispute that. And not that
[1:04:33] we're interested in doing that. But if a
[1:04:35] person says that they love the brethren
[1:04:38] in the right way and yet their life does
[1:04:40] not match up with the word of God, it's
[1:04:43] something within the word. Oh, you don't
[1:04:45] have to do that. You don't have to do
[1:04:46] that. All you got to do is love the
[1:04:48] brethren. But that's not all the story.
[1:04:50] Loving the brethren is only now a
[1:04:53] product of the word abiding in our life
[1:04:57] because God is love and God is the word.
[1:05:00] So what will love be? It will be the
[1:05:03] actual product of God himself dwelling
[1:05:07] in the midst of our lives.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my, look at this. Hereby we know that
[1:05:12] we dwell in him and he in us because he
[1:05:14] hath given us of his spirit. And we have
[1:05:16] seen and do testify that the father sent
[1:05:20] the son to be the savior of the world.
[1:05:22] How do how do you see that? How do you
[1:05:24] testify that? Well, look what he has
[1:05:26] done for your life.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, it's not just something
[1:05:30] you're looking at it as, well, I I
[1:05:31] receive him in salvation. Many, there'll
[1:05:34] be many that will be saved, but they do
[1:05:36] not see him in the expression of his
[1:05:39] word in this hour. That that is reserved
[1:05:42] alone for the bride of Jesus Christ. Yet
[1:05:44] God, what does he do? The prophet tells
[1:05:46] us he broadcasts this message to all.
[1:05:49] God broadcast it to all. And God's not
[1:05:51] in here saying, "Well, you can't have it
[1:05:53] and you can have it and you can't have
[1:05:54] it." No. But God knows when he begins to
[1:05:57] reveal himself. There are those that
[1:05:59] have always been a part of him that is
[1:06:01] just like a magnet that's pack passing
[1:06:04] down through. When those things are
[1:06:05] magnetized to him, they will actually be
[1:06:08] drawn to him. Cuz he said, "If I be
[1:06:11] lifted up, I will draw all men unto me."
[1:06:14] So, we're not lifting up a
[1:06:15] denominational idea of Jesus. We're not
[1:06:18] just lifting up, well, he he's a savior.
[1:06:20] He is a savior, but he's also a redeemer
[1:06:23] and he's a deliverer. And God's desire
[1:06:25] was that there would come an absolute
[1:06:28] witness of what has been revealed in our
[1:06:30] life has now become a testimony that I
[1:06:33] am redeemed. It's not just me that's
[1:06:36] saying it but the father that dwelleth
[1:06:38] in me. That portion is actually
[1:06:40] identifying I am no longer what I used
[1:06:43] to be. And there is something that
[1:06:46] reality that has changed inside of my
[1:06:48] life. What's happened? Christ has made
[1:06:51] his abode. He's taken his rest in his
[1:06:55] temple.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; And you become a display, a witness
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; that you can say in your own life, your
[1:07:02] own witness out of your own life, what
[1:07:04] he did for me, he'll do for you.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; People you come in contact with in the
[1:07:07] job and everywhere that God has us
[1:07:09] dispersed. Listen friends, if God wanted
[1:07:11] us to live in some kind of a commune and
[1:07:13] all all of a sudden on this property, we
[1:07:15] put a bunch of trailers and had a bunch
[1:07:16] of stores and we didn't leave anything
[1:07:18] else. God's not interested in creating a
[1:07:20] cult. Oh, amen. That's great.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; He's not interested in creating a
[1:07:25] commune because you know why? There's
[1:07:26] more of his children that's out there.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say it like this, too.
[1:07:31] There's more that are not as far as his
[1:07:33] elect, but they need to see the
[1:07:36] expression of who he is to even come to
[1:07:38] salvation.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; They may never come to see this truth,
[1:07:43] but if they're saved, I'll say, "Thank
[1:07:45] you, Lord, for touching that life."
[1:07:47] That's one more life that was stripped
[1:07:49] out of the hand of the enemy. They may
[1:07:52] never see this truth, but as long as
[1:07:55] they are saved,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is
[1:08:05] the son of God, God dwelleth in him. So
[1:08:08] confession is by a life.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; It's not just what we say, but it's the
[1:08:13] life that is lived.
[1:08:15] That's why the life that's lived, Lord,
[1:08:18] let let everything that I what is being
[1:08:20] expressed, let it match your word.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Let everything, let every attribute, if
[1:08:25] there's any unbelief, whatever it might
[1:08:27] be, Lord God, out of my life, it's
[1:08:29] dress, it's whatever more, let it all be
[1:08:31] resolved that it might be you that's
[1:08:34] expressed completely. Whosoever shall
[1:08:36] confess that Jesus is the son of God,
[1:08:38] God dwelleth in him and he in God. And
[1:08:40] we have known and believe the love that
[1:08:43] God hath to us. God is love and he that
[1:08:46] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God
[1:08:50] in him. So you were the prophet would
[1:08:53] take this over and over. You were as a
[1:08:56] son and daughter of God. You're his
[1:08:58] attribute. You were with him clear back
[1:09:02] in the loins of God's mind.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; And then God coming down, he had to
[1:09:08] become one of us. And when God became
[1:09:11] one of us, as the prophet said, he
[1:09:13] transferred us from the loins of God's
[1:09:16] mind into the loins of Jesus because he
[1:09:19] was the word made flesh. We were here in
[1:09:23] him. Listen to me. This is why the
[1:09:25] prophet said, "We went to Calvary in
[1:09:27] him. He made me pay for my sin in him."
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You see, and it became
[1:09:36] because of him, it allowed you and I to
[1:09:40] come to a place to lay down our own
[1:09:43] life.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Because of him. And when he got up on
[1:09:49] that Easter morning, we got up with him.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why when the Holy
[1:09:55] Spirit comes to deal with your life,
[1:09:57] your life has not meant to just lay here
[1:10:00] and and among the world, but there is a
[1:10:03] resurrection. There's an identification
[1:10:06] that's calling on you to say, "Come up
[1:10:09] higher."
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; You you you've got a higher purpose.
[1:10:12] There's there's more in your life. Well,
[1:10:14] you know, even you can say, "Well, I'm
[1:10:16] saved." But then God begins to deal with
[1:10:18] your life and you realize, "Wait a
[1:10:19] minute. There's something more. I
[1:10:21] there's something I I need more. And
[1:10:23] what it is that you need is that portion
[1:10:26] of God that God allotted for you. And
[1:10:29] Jesus made the way that you could have
[1:10:31] that part of your inheritance.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; You're his attribute. And notice how God
[1:10:43] God built himself an attribute. God
[1:10:46] could not, as the prophet said,
[1:10:48] fellowship in the spirit. So God became
[1:10:50] man with us. He built himself a house, a
[1:10:54] body to live in. And he come down so he
[1:10:56] could we could touch him. And he says,
[1:10:59] "Now you being flesh," this is out of
[1:11:00] the same same portion, "and him being
[1:11:02] flesh, then you can fellowship now cuz
[1:11:06] he was God's attribute of love and God
[1:11:10] is love." He was God's attribute of
[1:11:13] love. God is love. And Jesus was God's
[1:11:18] attribute of love. And when the
[1:11:20] attribute of love was displayed, which
[1:11:24] that was God himself, all the attributes
[1:11:27] that hung on to him come to him.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; So what was he? What is he? Love.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; God is love. God is the word. And when
[1:11:37] that great attribute of love of the word
[1:11:41] was displayed, every attribute that hung
[1:11:44] on to that attribute,
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; came.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; You know, how many of you heard Brother
[1:11:51] Bram say over and over all the way
[1:11:52] through the messages on love and he says
[1:11:55] it like this. He said, "When love is
[1:11:58] projected
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; and comes to its end,
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:05] Then sovereign grace steps in.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a lot there's a lot of
[1:12:13] thick cream right there to be applied to
[1:12:16] every one of our lives in in every
[1:12:18] situation when love has been projected.
[1:12:22] Remember litmus test comes back into our
[1:12:26] own life if when we're looking at it
[1:12:29] because when love listen when love is
[1:12:31] being projected love itself is holding
[1:12:34] you
[1:12:36] love is overshadowing it's pulsating
[1:12:39] through your emotions and your feelings
[1:12:42] and it's it's just because love remember
[1:12:45] is what produces faith
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; or brother Sam I've been projecting love
[1:12:49] but I ain't seen no change then you've
[1:12:51] not been projecting agape love.
[1:12:56] You might you might be, but don't don't
[1:12:59] don't just all of a sudden make a detour
[1:13:02] and don't put it on your timeline
[1:13:05] because let me tell you, love was
[1:13:06] projected and it was 2,000 years and
[1:13:09] then grace stepped in.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? All the way down
[1:13:14] through the prophets, every one of them
[1:13:16] were speaking of Christ. The Bible said
[1:13:19] in Isaiah 53, he was he is sorry, he is
[1:13:24] despised and rejected. It was Christ in
[1:13:27] Abraham. It was Christ in Moses. It was
[1:13:31] Christ in Noah. It was Christ in David.
[1:13:34] It was glimpse of the Messiah with
[1:13:37] messianic promises all the way down.
[1:13:41] What was doing that? Love had been
[1:13:44] projected. And when love's projected,
[1:13:47] sovereign grace will step in and produce
[1:13:52] what love has called for.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; I I just to me I would be simple enough
[1:13:57] to say, God, let that be that kind of
[1:14:00] love,
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, because my you know, felio love
[1:14:04] just just as much as like you starting
[1:14:06] on a project and man, you start painting
[1:14:08] a wall and all of a sudden you realize,
[1:14:10] man, this thing, who in the world put
[1:14:11] wallpaper on this wall? this this pain
[1:14:13] ain't even going on, right? Man, what in
[1:14:15] the world we got to do? And what you
[1:14:16] thought was a day job now becomes a
[1:14:18] weekend job,
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; right? It becomes frustrating. But see,
[1:14:22] that's how feel love is. Felio love can
[1:14:25] become frustrating because it's based on
[1:14:27] conditions.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you this. What are you giving
[1:14:30] me back?
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; But that's why there's got to be more
[1:14:34] than felio love. Because if God never
[1:14:37] answered another prayer,
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; if everything turned against us, we
[1:14:45] would still have the strength of God's
[1:14:48] love to not only stand but even love
[1:14:51] those that's turned against us.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Now, he was the attribute of love
[1:15:01] displayed and all the father has given
[1:15:03] me will come to me. They had to be
[1:15:05] predestinated. If you wasn't, you won't
[1:15:07] be there. Now, watch how brother
[1:15:08] Brandham simply places this way back in
[1:15:10] 1952.
[1:15:12] He says, now we know drinking and
[1:15:15] carrying on is sin. The whole thing is
[1:15:18] because of unbelief. Those are only
[1:15:20] attributes,
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; right? All the attributes, no matter
[1:15:24] what it is, dress and everything else
[1:15:26] that comes out and uh immorality, those
[1:15:28] are all attributes.
[1:15:31] It's just like it's like a a person
[1:15:32] saying, "Well, I need to stop this and I
[1:15:34] need to stop that." What it is,
[1:15:36] remember, every one of those every one
[1:15:38] of those attributes is a symptom of
[1:15:41] unbelief.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what we got to get where we
[1:15:44] have to come to is is that what's the
[1:15:46] root of the problem is unbelief.
[1:15:49] Because like the prophet said, when you
[1:15:51] believe, you won't do those things.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; I know that sounds it sounds very
[1:15:56] simple, but it's it's the gospel truth.
[1:15:58] Because if you believe God in Jesus
[1:16:00] Christ to be his son, you are absolutely
[1:16:03] not going to do those things. He said,
[1:16:04] "He that's born of God does not commit
[1:16:07] sin." You must believe. The whole thing
[1:16:11] lays in faith. How many How many heard
[1:16:14] brother Bam say, "Brother Bram never
[1:16:15] said if you feel it." He said, "No,
[1:16:17] brother said like this." He said, "Did
[1:16:19] you ever say hear Jesus say, "Did you
[1:16:21] feel it?" He says, "It's not did you
[1:16:23] feel it? Do you believe it?" Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; You see the word, listen, in order for
[1:16:28] the word to produce itself, you first
[1:16:31] got to agree with it.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; You have to agree with it that the word
[1:16:36] is true.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Take the word
[1:16:39] above your own thoughts. And don't let
[1:16:42] your thoughts determine whether or not
[1:16:45] that the word is worthy to be taken.
[1:16:48] There's a battle. Remember the prophet
[1:16:50] said in greatest battle ever fought, he
[1:16:51] said there's a battle sitting behind
[1:16:53] right before each and every one. He
[1:16:55] talked about the young girl who was
[1:16:56] sitting there and bound in that in that
[1:16:58] cot or whatever. And he said Satan is
[1:17:00] standing right there battling against
[1:17:02] her mind,
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; battling against her. We're in a
[1:17:06] battleground. This isn't a place to
[1:17:08] relax. This is a battleground. Amen.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; And the whole thing about it is is the
[1:17:13] contest is Satan is wanting you to try
[1:17:17] to take the word by your reasoning. And
[1:17:19] your reasoning is based on you.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; But you've got to take the word above
[1:17:25] your reasoning. And when you take the
[1:17:27] word above your reasoning, thy word is
[1:17:30] truth.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Then the word it will over it will move
[1:17:35] beyond. And as the word flows down, it
[1:17:38] will blow out that reasoning. Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Satan is there to always confess that
[1:17:47] he that heareth my words and believeth
[1:17:48] on him that sent me has everlasting life
[1:17:51] and shall not come into condemnation but
[1:17:54] already passed from death unto life. He
[1:17:56] said, "Do you believe?" That's the
[1:17:57] truth. There it lays. There isn't
[1:17:59] nothing else that you can do. Only
[1:18:01] believe. Now watch this. And if you
[1:18:04] believe then them little immoral things
[1:18:08] just drop off like that.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; And you believe you become love.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Not becoming lovely.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; You become love
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; because why? You are becoming the
[1:18:22] absolute expression of what love has
[1:18:26] called for.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Who is love? God. He is the word. You
[1:18:32] are now an expression of what love has
[1:18:36] called for. My my my love did not call
[1:18:40] for a hybrid son and daughter. But love
[1:18:42] called for give me an heir.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; God issued that through Abraham give me
[1:18:48] an heir.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And Abraham was willing to say Eleazar.
[1:18:51] But God said no that shall not be thine
[1:18:54] heir but one that comes from thine own
[1:18:56] loins. What was that? That was God
[1:18:58] expressing his desire for his hes
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; and he couldn't take anything else
[1:19:05] outside of his word. His heirs would be
[1:19:07] that of his word. That's why we are
[1:19:10] joint hes
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; with Christ Jesus.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; As you believe, as you believe,
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; let me just say this to you. Don't put
[1:19:25] God on a timet.
[1:19:27] Don't become anxious.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Don't become
[1:19:30] anxious. Even when you're hearing the
[1:19:32] word of God, let me just tell you
[1:19:34] something. When God is dealing with our
[1:19:36] lives and conviction strikes, you don't
[1:19:38] want to be anxious. Just submit to the
[1:19:41] word right then
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; because the whole purpose God listen,
[1:19:44] you know how blessed you are to be able
[1:19:46] to receive and heed to conviction.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; You know how blessed you are? Amen.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; There was there was religious men when
[1:19:53] Stephen started to preach that as soon
[1:19:56] as he started to preach the gospel.
[1:19:58] These were men you couldn't put a finger
[1:20:00] on their lives.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Right? Soon as the gospel, the word
[1:20:04] started getting preached, you seen that
[1:20:06] old spirit like Cain rise up. The Bible
[1:20:08] says they
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; on him with their teeth. All right.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; What brought that about was because
[1:20:16] Stephen was preaching the revealed word
[1:20:19] of the hour that Jesus Christ is indeed
[1:20:23] the answer of the messianic promise.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; He brought God from history to a present
[1:20:30] in God. He brought it from will be will
[1:20:33] be until he has come. He is here now.
[1:20:36] And this is the fulfillment of you
[1:20:39] crucified him and now this life that you
[1:20:42] are hearing. This spirit is his own
[1:20:44] life.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; They were brought to a moment to a
[1:20:49] junction.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; And what happened? Like Cain, they got
[1:20:52] jealous.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; They could say they loved Moses, but
[1:20:56] they couldn't love Moses and hate and
[1:20:59] hate the revealed word.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's why Jesus said,
[1:21:04] "Your righteousness has got to be a lot
[1:21:06] bigger than the righteousness of the
[1:21:08] Pharisees."
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you love them that love love you,
[1:21:12] you're no different than them.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Religious people at the time, they
[1:21:15] listen, they could not do any more than
[1:21:18] what was allotted to them in the measure
[1:21:20] even in that time. But once the word
[1:21:23] came across their path, it brought
[1:21:25] something out of them. Much different
[1:21:26] with the woman at the well. She was one
[1:21:28] the condition she was in. Uh, I'm going
[1:21:31] to tell you, if you go by conditions,
[1:21:32] you would seem like, man, we want to
[1:21:34] associate with these guys. These are
[1:21:35] some good Orthodox guys, man. I mean to
[1:21:38] tell you, they're right on the money.
[1:21:39] You can't. They tithe on ants. They
[1:21:41] tithe on men. They do this. They do
[1:21:43] that. But her, on the other hand, my if
[1:21:45] I hang around her, I might get a reput.
[1:21:47] You know, her reputation might be like,
[1:21:48] man, what are you doing hanging around
[1:21:50] her? You never know. But Jesus, his
[1:21:52] reputation is made around that of taking
[1:21:56] sinners that which they're named. The
[1:21:58] prophet said it like this. The dogs
[1:22:00] wouldn't even howl their name. But you
[1:22:02] let the spirit of God come down and take
[1:22:05] a hold of that life, the spirit of God
[1:22:07] will so transform that life and his name
[1:22:10] will now be displayed through a trophy
[1:22:13] of his divine visitation.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; My goodness, what does that love? You
[1:22:19] see, the love of God does not leave you
[1:22:21] in your sin.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; The love of God don't do that. The love
[1:22:26] of God has provided for you and I what
[1:22:29] we have need of in order to become a
[1:22:33] fully manifested son and daughter of
[1:22:36] God. Not just title only, but an
[1:22:38] absolute fully manifested son and
[1:22:41] daughter of God. Of course, we realize
[1:22:42] we're still growing and growing in our
[1:22:44] lives. But notice, you believe, you
[1:22:47] become love and love is God.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; So, you're becoming
[1:22:53] like God.
[1:22:55] That's good.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; So God transforming your life
[1:23:02] was his spirit has come down and where
[1:23:05] his word where his so transformed your
[1:23:09] life you become love. Not just loving
[1:23:13] the spirit of God dealing with our
[1:23:15] lives, working with us, drawing us in
[1:23:17] repentance. We're made more lovable.
[1:23:19] Dealing with our lives, sanctification,
[1:23:21] made more lovable. But when the Holy
[1:23:23] Spirit has come,
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; then you have become love,
[1:23:29] an absolute expression
[1:23:33] of God himself.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; And these other things, you don't have
[1:23:40] to quit doing them. They just quit
[1:23:43] themselves.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; "It isn't it isn't you quitting
[1:23:51] anything. It's them quitting you,
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; It's just like, you know, there were
[1:23:57] people that, oh, they they all of a
[1:23:58] sudden, you know, they, you know, they
[1:23:59] wanted to hang around and oh, they
[1:24:01] wanted to call me and come out and
[1:24:02] continue to do this and do that.
[1:24:04] Eventually, after hearing enough of my
[1:24:06] testimony and just just letting them
[1:24:07] know, you know what? What happened to
[1:24:09] you? I said, you I don't know if you
[1:24:10] read your Bible or not. I said, but you
[1:24:12] know who I met? I met the Lord Jesus.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. They walked in when I was selling
[1:24:17] suits one night and wanted to laugh and
[1:24:19] giggle and cut up at me when I was
[1:24:21] fitting suits. And so after all that was
[1:24:23] done, you know, they were standing
[1:24:24] around. I said, "If you want to know
[1:24:26] what happened to me," then they would
[1:24:27] get, you know, other ones and there
[1:24:28] would be these young ladies that would
[1:24:30] come by. I said, "Let me just say say
[1:24:32] tell you, you know who I met? I met the
[1:24:34] Lord Jesus. I met the same one that Paul
[1:24:37] met on the road to." I said, "Do you
[1:24:38] ever read your Bible? I met the same
[1:24:40] one." Oh, I wasn't very many months in
[1:24:43] serving God. But I'll tell you just a
[1:24:44] little bit of that testimony right there
[1:24:46] and all of the things that was going on
[1:24:48] before. Give Browning a little bit.
[1:24:50] He'll be right back out in that. But
[1:24:51] there was a testimony. I wasn't just
[1:24:53] saying something, but there was a
[1:24:54] declaration. I knew from the desires
[1:24:57] from within my life.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; It had changed. I did not want that life
[1:25:02] any longer.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; What was happening? It wasn't me
[1:25:08] quitting my friends. They quit me.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Now notice he says they just no desire
[1:25:20] to do it. The worshipper being purged
[1:25:23] has no more conscience or desire of sin.
[1:25:25] And when the worshipper is purged, when
[1:25:27] he is born again, when his old nature
[1:25:29] dies and a new nature sets in, then he's
[1:25:32] a part of God, a son of God, he gets new
[1:25:34] life. And that Greek word there is Zoe
[1:25:37] which means life of God. And you become
[1:25:40] an offspring of God. And God cannot hurt
[1:25:43] you without hurting himself.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; So what is it based on? It's believing.
[1:25:50] You don't stop believing. You continue
[1:25:53] to believe.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, I don't see this.
[1:26:02] Don't stop believing.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Because the rapture
[1:26:06] hasn't come yet. Don't stop believing.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't seen this prayer. Don't
[1:26:11] stop believing. That's the time to
[1:26:12] believe.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; It's easy to believe when everything
[1:26:16] feels right, seems right, looks good.
[1:26:19] But when when even when you can't even
[1:26:21] see anything around you, you say, "What
[1:26:23] do I do?" Stand up on what he has
[1:26:27] revealed to you already. And don't give
[1:26:30] up one iota to the devil.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Don't give up one
[1:26:36] iota because then that's ground you got
[1:26:38] to go back and reclaim.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; It becomes futile of trying to go back
[1:26:43] like Israel did that time there under I
[1:26:45] think Omar or whatever more going into
[1:26:47] Hezbollah and they go in there five of a
[1:26:49] day and come back at night. How dumb was
[1:26:52] that?
[1:26:54] Y'all know what I'm talking about. You
[1:26:56] got to go back and retake the same
[1:26:58] positions all the time.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Don't you realize that the devil is a
[1:27:04] liar?
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; How do you know when he's lying? Every
[1:27:07] time he opens his mouth,
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; stand on what God has done for you. And
[1:27:14] that is your confession that what he's
[1:27:16] done, he will finish the work in my
[1:27:20] life.
[1:27:22] regardless of my feelings, regardless of
[1:27:25] my thoughts, regardless of my
[1:27:27] circumstances. You know what that is
[1:27:28] that's coming out? That's love. Love to
[1:27:31] trust him. Even when you're standing
[1:27:34] before giants, you trust him.
[1:27:38] [Applause]
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; You know what Caleb and Joshua became?
[1:27:43] Love.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; You know what the rest of them became?
[1:27:48] Freddy cats.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Fear. What's the opposite of love? fear.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. You understand what
[1:27:54] I'm saying?
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; The whole thing was not based on whether
[1:27:57] they had their their abilities. Their
[1:27:59] ability was if God be for us.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; There was a love for God to trust him.
[1:28:04] Even when the circumstances said, "Then
[1:28:07] we're greater than you."
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, God is greater than any
[1:28:12] circumstance of your flesh.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; He's greater than anything of your DNA
[1:28:16] and anything of your birth. The grace of
[1:28:17] God is greater. It's more greater and
[1:28:19] able to take care of every situation and
[1:28:22] God is more than willing to do that.
[1:28:24] What must I do? Believe him.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; And if if that seems like a struggle,
[1:28:29] here's a scripture that is given for you
[1:28:30] and I that even that man that came
[1:28:33] before the Lord Jesus where his boy was
[1:28:35] in need of deliverance. Lord, I believe.
[1:28:38] Help thou my unbelief.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; I say we throw down pride. Right?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; You're not, Listen, in the Father's
[1:28:49] house. This is not a place to be
[1:28:50] intimidated. This is not a place where
[1:28:52] you've got to show off. This is not a
[1:28:54] place where you have to put something
[1:28:56] on. This is not a place where you have
[1:28:57] to pretend. Your father loves you. You
[1:29:00] say, "How do I know he loves me?" He
[1:29:02] came down and he made paid the price for
[1:29:05] you and he sent back the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:07] This message did not come across your
[1:29:09] pathway just by chance. Oh, brother
[1:29:12] Samuel, how many other people it did?
[1:29:14] I'm not talking about other people. I'm
[1:29:16] talking about you. You're the one that's
[1:29:18] here tonight. And you've got to have
[1:29:20] that kind of a faith that the word did
[1:29:23] not get delivered at the wrong address.
[1:29:26] The word was delivered to the right
[1:29:28] person. I am a part of this word.
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; He is the apostle
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; and high priest of your profession.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:29:44] What you say he is, that's what he is.
[1:29:47] Oh, I don't know if I ever make it.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; That's not what he is.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I must not be. That's not what he
[1:29:54] is.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Well, one of these days I'll be healed.
[1:29:56] That's not what he is.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; One of these days I'll be delivered. No,
[1:30:00] that's not what he is.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I say tonight, we ought to just stand on
[1:30:07] that when the love of God pouring in so
[1:30:09] rich right here and say, "Devil, you're
[1:30:10] a liar. You're trying to take from me.
[1:30:13] You're trying to rob the privilege of a
[1:30:15] son and daughter of God. Right here, I
[1:30:18] have that possession right here as a son
[1:30:21] and daughter of God. Deliverance is
[1:30:23] mine. Salvation is mine. The Holy Ghost
[1:30:26] is mine. Healing is mine.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; When that word is drawing on your heart,
[1:30:34] lay hold on it.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; How God reveals himself to you, don't
[1:30:39] turn loose of it. That's right.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Say, God, let my if there's something in
[1:30:43] my life that is not in the condition for
[1:30:45] that to be made manifest, then Lord God,
[1:30:48] remedy all things to where my life
[1:30:50] becomes a fit channel for that word to
[1:30:54] be made manifest through.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; That's how we handle the sons and
[1:30:58] daughters of God.
[1:31:03] Yes. So good.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know, this is why the
[1:31:08] scripture can I I'll just I'm put it up
[1:31:10] here, but I'm going refer to it. This is
[1:31:11] why Paul said, "From henceforth, we know
[1:31:14] no man after the flesh."
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Now, Paul never knew Jesus in the flesh.
[1:31:21] That's right.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Never did it. That's right.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Paul saw him after his death, burial,
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; and resurrection,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; and after the Holy Spirit. He'd already
[1:31:28] turned back to a pillar of fire. And
[1:31:30] what Paul received being the messenger
[1:31:33] of that age
[1:31:35] was greater
[1:31:38] because he was the prophet of that hour
[1:31:40] and it was given to that of the
[1:31:42] Gentiles. And notice how Paul would
[1:31:43] write this. There might have been those
[1:31:45] who walked around. Let me just say this
[1:31:46] to you. Do you know how many saw him
[1:31:49] ascend
[1:31:51] on Mount Olivan? You know how many saw
[1:31:53] him ascend? 500.
[1:31:55] That's what the Bible says in the book
[1:31:57] of Corinthians. 500 saw him. How many
[1:32:00] went in the upper room? 120.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; What happened to the 380?
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; See, you got to be careful. Don't just
[1:32:10] gaze at the message.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; God don't want you to become enamored
[1:32:15] and gazing at the message. But remember,
[1:32:18] the message is all about getting
[1:32:19] underneath the blood.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; That's so
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right? 120 went on up there in
[1:32:26] the upper room and they got the Holy
[1:32:28] Ghost.
[1:32:30] Y'all know what I'm talking about. It's
[1:32:31] in the Bible. The prophet deals with it
[1:32:32] as well. There's 120. That what had
[1:32:35] meaning of what this was all about. No
[1:32:39] doubt. And 380 of them walked away and
[1:32:40] said, "Wow, what a service."
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Did you see how that there
[1:32:47] the space and the light just grew
[1:32:48] between his feet? And as
[1:32:52] But that was it.
[1:32:54] But 120 went on to Jerusalem.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; They knew what that meant is the
[1:33:01] promises for me.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; That's my Passover. That's my sacrifice.
[1:33:06] You see, when this message is revealed
[1:33:08] to you, it's not revealing a man. It's
[1:33:11] not revealing doctrines. It's revealing
[1:33:13] the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. It is
[1:33:17] the revelation of Jesus Christ breaking
[1:33:20] forth upon your life. Hallelujah.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; We know no man after the flesh.
[1:33:29] We've known Christ after the flesh, but
[1:33:31] now we know him no more. Therefore, if
[1:33:32] any man be in Christ, he is a new
[1:33:36] creature, and old things are passed
[1:33:38] away, and behold, all things are become
[1:33:40] new.
[1:33:42] Brother Ram goes into talking of this
[1:33:44] form and he talks about how you and I
[1:33:46] are can you and I are held apart by the
[1:33:49] physical body.
[1:33:51] Yet we're united in our hearts
[1:33:54] when we've received the Holy Spirit.
[1:33:57] It's actually Christ in you uniting with
[1:34:02] Christ in me.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; So it's it's it's God uniting himself
[1:34:08] together.
[1:34:10] Now, brother Brandon would say it in
[1:34:12] this way. Remember, I'm dealing with
[1:34:13] this on becoming love. He says, "When
[1:34:16] you think of it, really, we have never
[1:34:18] seen one another." Did you know that? We
[1:34:21] have never seen one another. You hear
[1:34:23] something speaking out of a body here
[1:34:25] that impersonates whatever's on the
[1:34:27] inside. So then when we talk to each
[1:34:29] other, we're really not talking to the
[1:34:32] body. It's the spirit inside. But the
[1:34:36] body is the thing that identifies the
[1:34:38] spirit that's on the inside. Remember
[1:34:40] when Jesus spoke to those Pharisees, he
[1:34:42] said, "You're of your father, the
[1:34:43] devil."
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Who was he talking to?
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Not this.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Not this. He was speaking to the spirit
[1:34:51] that was behind him.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Right. He also told them, "You're full
[1:34:55] of dead men's bones."
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; He also told them, "You shut up the key
[1:34:59] into the kingdom and you do it for
[1:35:01] everybody else."
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; He here he was dealing with them. You
[1:35:06] all of those things. What was he dealing
[1:35:07] with? Outwardly. Outwardly, these men,
[1:35:12] the prophet said, you couldn't put a
[1:35:13] finger on their lives. Listen to me now.
[1:35:16] Brother Bram said, when it came to
[1:35:17] fruits of the spirit, nobody could outdo
[1:35:20] him.
[1:35:22] And he said, here was Jesus walking into
[1:35:25] the temple that day. And he began, like
[1:35:27] a couple Sundays ago, we went through
[1:35:28] that, he began to kick things over. He
[1:35:31] wasn't having a temper tantrum.
[1:35:34] We know that
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; he found things in the temple that
[1:35:37] shouldn't be there.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; That that that that that really living
[1:35:41] for God is not a life of convenience.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; It's not about what's convenient for me.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; But it's something that even that we in
[1:35:49] ourselves would have to labor over. They
[1:35:51] could go buy a lamb. But the prophet
[1:35:52] tells us in the study, he says that what
[1:35:54] it is instead of raising lambs, they
[1:35:57] could go buy one. If you don't have to
[1:35:59] raise that lamb, you don't have to feed
[1:36:01] it. You don't have to clean its pin. You
[1:36:03] don't have to look over it. You don't
[1:36:05] even have to keep up with it. Oh, it's
[1:36:06] sick. Oh, we got to watch this. We got
[1:36:08] to that. You know what that takes out of
[1:36:09] you? That takes something out of you.
[1:36:11] So, when you offer that lamb, you are
[1:36:13] offering a part of yourself.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; And when he came in the temple, he moved
[1:36:19] all of that out of there because they
[1:36:21] were going in and buying something
[1:36:24] instead of it being a part of them.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; And God was expressing that's what he
[1:36:29] came to do. He did not send something
[1:36:32] that it wasn't a part of him. He came
[1:36:35] himself.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; He gave himself for you and I.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus is not a second person.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; It's the very God revealed.
[1:36:47] [Music]
[1:36:48] [Applause]
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "I've
[1:36:51] always held that he was the deity of
[1:36:54] God."
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; And the message shalom. Therefore, when
[1:37:01] we speak to each other quickly, we can
[1:37:04] understand right away whether we are
[1:37:05] Christians or not because there's a
[1:37:07] fellowship
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; in the spirit that we talk from.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; So, you see it vibrates one to another
[1:37:14] whether we are Christians or not.
[1:37:16] Therefore, we have never seen one
[1:37:18] another. Watch how he picks this up.
[1:37:20] Jesus, no man has seen God at any time
[1:37:22] but the only begotten of the father has
[1:37:24] declared him. In other words, God was
[1:37:27] identified, the person of God was
[1:37:30] identified in the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:34] Christ. So, he was the expressed image
[1:37:37] of God. You catch that. The person of
[1:37:40] God was identified in the body
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now remember
[1:37:49] like the prophet said it's two yet it's
[1:37:51] one because remember it's not the flesh
[1:37:54] was God yet the flesh was the flesh of
[1:37:56] God.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; The flesh was not God yet it was the
[1:38:02] flesh of God.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; You hearing me? Same for you. The flesh
[1:38:07] that I'm looking at, Congalles, that I
[1:38:10] know is Joshua, but the flesh is not
[1:38:12] Joshua, but Joshua is in that flesh.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; That's Joshua's flesh. This right here
[1:38:20] is not Samuel Browning, but this is the
[1:38:22] flesh of Samuel Browning. Samuel
[1:38:25] Browning is in the flesh. God was in
[1:38:29] Christ reconciling the world
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; unto himself.
[1:38:35] Amen.
[1:38:36] [Applause]
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; And he has reconciled us unto himself.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Brother Bram says it
[1:38:48] like this in the message of rapture. He
[1:38:49] said, "I've always preached he was
[1:38:50] deity, not just a man. He was God
[1:38:53] manifested in the flesh." God, the
[1:38:55] attribute of God of love. The great
[1:38:58] attributes that come down display here
[1:39:00] on earth of God. Jesus was God's love
[1:39:02] which built a body that Jehovah himself
[1:39:06] lived in. He was the fullness of the
[1:39:09] Godhead bodily. What God was, he
[1:39:11] manifested through that body. That body
[1:39:13] had to die so he could wash the bride
[1:39:17] with his blood.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Paul says it like this.
[1:39:24] The love of God
[1:39:27] is shed abroad.
[1:39:30] Where at? In our hearts,
[1:39:33] not our spirits,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; in our hearts.
[1:39:38] The love of God is spread, shed abroad.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; In our hearts by the Holy Spirit.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit is not something
[1:39:48] different
[1:39:49] from God.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; It is God,
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:55] These three are one.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; There's three that bear record right in
[1:40:03] heaven. The father,
[1:40:06] the word. That's the That's how it says
[1:40:08] it. The word, and the holy ghost.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Right. And these three are one.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; So when you've received the Holy Spirit,
[1:40:17] you have received your deposit of the
[1:40:21] father.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; And then you having that life on the
[1:40:26] inside of you. How does the life travel?
[1:40:28] Through the body.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; And then what what are you bearing?
[1:40:31] You're bearing his name.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. There you go.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; You're bearing his life. As Jesus said,
[1:40:37] I've come in my father's name. So can
[1:40:38] you say by the word of God that's been
[1:40:41] revealed to you and in your life and
[1:40:43] through your life, I have come in my
[1:40:45] father's name.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:56] Let me just give you just a few more
[1:40:57] scriptures. Is that okay?
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; It's going to be so long since ne till
[1:41:01] next Thursday
[1:41:03] and I'm already ahead of this for next
[1:41:06] Thursday. But notice in 1 John 5:1,
[1:41:10] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[1:41:13] Christ is born of God.
[1:41:17] Once again, a person could say, "I
[1:41:19] believe he's the Christ."
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; So, I'm born of God.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; But remember, he's the anointed word
[1:41:27] when we're expressing that.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; He is born of God. Born again.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; So, you can't say we're born again and
[1:41:38] we're still doing the things of the
[1:41:40] world. You understand what I mean? God
[1:41:42] God works things out of a person's life.
[1:41:44] takes takes the desire the very nature
[1:41:46] of the life and then God continues to
[1:41:47] move through our life and give us
[1:41:49] overcoming grace through every every
[1:41:51] little obstacle in our life because when
[1:41:53] God gave you the Holy Ghost he didn't
[1:41:54] take the giants out of your land he
[1:41:56] didn't he didn't demolish Jericho he
[1:41:58] didn't take care of AI he said I've
[1:42:00] equipped you
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; and now you go into the land and you
[1:42:03] tear down every one of their posters
[1:42:05] that's what it says in Deuteronomy you
[1:42:06] tear down every one of their idols in
[1:42:08] other words the things that's been
[1:42:09] troubling and has been there of a
[1:42:11] trouble or what becomes to be known to
[1:42:13] you as an area of trouble of where that
[1:42:16] in your life you experience defeat.
[1:42:19] Learn from it and tear those things
[1:42:22] down.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Well, I know I know brother
[1:42:25] Joshua and he's it ain't about brother
[1:42:27] Joshua." It's about things that when you
[1:42:30] see that are a snare. It's like this.
[1:42:32] You could take a person, but here it is.
[1:42:34] I know different brothers and my
[1:42:35] goodness, you talking about being
[1:42:37] wonderful fishermen. Not here, but I
[1:42:38] mean there is wonderful fishermanmen
[1:42:40] here. You understand? In other places,
[1:42:41] man, they were part of bass tournaments
[1:42:43] and everything else. They lived for all
[1:42:45] of that. But when God got a hold of
[1:42:47] their life, the Holy Spirit took a hold
[1:42:49] of their life. And just little by little
[1:42:50] by little by little, you know what?
[1:42:52] Their pastor never had to tell them, "Go
[1:42:53] sell that prize bass boat you've got."
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; You know what happened? The more they
[1:42:59] believed, feeding on the word, they
[1:43:01] became love.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't them quitting and selling
[1:43:05] the bass boat. Eventually,
[1:43:08] it just it come to that place. This is
[1:43:10] crowding in on my time with Jesus.
[1:43:13] [Music]
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; You see, that's part of the redeeming
[1:43:17] work and becoming love. You begin to
[1:43:20] recognize that. I don't want anything
[1:43:22] crowding in on that.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Watch this. And everyone that loveth him
[1:43:27] that begget, loveth him also that is
[1:43:31] begotten of him. Remember,
[1:43:34] bride won't persecute bride.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Bride won't tear down bride,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; That's not a characteristic of the
[1:43:45] bride. Oh, you bunch of dead people.
[1:43:48] That's not characteristic.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; That might come out, but if that's a son
[1:43:52] and daughter of God, they ain't saying
[1:43:54] they couldn't get in that way. Maybe
[1:43:55] their background maybe where things
[1:43:56] coming up. God will correct his children
[1:43:58] because God will not allow one of his
[1:44:01] children to talk about another one of
[1:44:03] his other children.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Sure, we got to hold
[1:44:07] the standard of the word, but there's a
[1:44:08] way to hold the standard of the word
[1:44:10] because the word is Christ.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; We don't have to tear down our brother.
[1:44:14] We don't have to diminish this. Just
[1:44:15] preach the word. And you preach the
[1:44:17] word. And you know what? The people are
[1:44:19] drawn to the word and they receive
[1:44:22] discernment
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; instead of somebody instead of somebody
[1:44:25] else's word. Oh, that's a dead church.
[1:44:26] Or this is a dead. Oh, I got to go to so
[1:44:28] and what so and so says, "No man is my
[1:44:30] absolute."
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; I don't care how many miracles. I don't
[1:44:33] care what they've had. No man is my
[1:44:34] absolute.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; But the word of God is my absolute.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Is that your absolute?
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; And when I'm talking about the word of
[1:44:41] God, I'm talking of this and the message
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; because that is the word of God.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; You take the message away from this,
[1:44:49] we're left.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; But when the message has come, what does
[1:44:52] the message do? It brings forth the
[1:44:54] living word of God. It's where this was
[1:44:56] being sold on the auctioneers's table.
[1:45:00] Oh, we don't need to do that. Oh, we
[1:45:01] went nothing. Nobody was even bidding on
[1:45:04] it.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; But God come down in this generation. It
[1:45:08] wasn't a man with a seventh grade
[1:45:10] education. It was God who walked up in
[1:45:14] the shoes of William Brandham and picked
[1:45:17] up this word and begin to play Jesus
[1:45:20] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:45:22] forever. And what everybody else said,
[1:45:25] well, you know, well, it don't matter
[1:45:26] too much and we just go this and you
[1:45:28] just believe Jesus and you don't got to
[1:45:30] worry about the Holy Ghost and you don't
[1:45:32] got to worry about all that stuff
[1:45:33] anymore. But God came down in this hour.
[1:45:35] You know why? cuz he had some eagles,
[1:45:38] some predestinated children of God, and
[1:45:41] what they needed to hear was a new song.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; They needed to hear the song played by
[1:45:49] the spirit of God from the chords of
[1:45:52] God's predestinated promises of his word
[1:45:55] in this hour. Glory to God.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel good.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory to God. By this, we know that
[1:46:05] we love the children of God. Let's
[1:46:06] stand.
[1:46:11] We'll just have to start here.
[1:46:17] So, we can't say
[1:46:22] I don't know.
[1:46:24] Remember, God has all kinds in his body,
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:46:29] And just because they're not like me or
[1:46:32] they're not like you,
[1:46:35] don't make them odd.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Don't make them not a part of the body.
[1:46:40] It's like in trying to somehow, let's
[1:46:43] just say, worship being so attacked as
[1:46:45] Ben.
[1:46:47] So attacked and trying to categorize
[1:46:49] things.
[1:46:51] And yet
[1:46:53] I think even when I was over in Ghana
[1:46:58] I was done preaching in that convention
[1:46:59] each of the services.
[1:47:04] First one I went I can't remember how
[1:47:06] many services I preached. I might have
[1:47:07] been only three and then I preach other
[1:47:08] places. The next time I went I preached
[1:47:10] seven.
[1:47:12] But every time the space from here to
[1:47:16] the first pew was about where Andrea is
[1:47:19] sitting. You know what took place and
[1:47:22] they just didn't work it up. They were
[1:47:23] so happy with the word. While the word
[1:47:25] was being preached, they were running up
[1:47:26] there. I thought they was going to take
[1:47:27] my place.
[1:47:29] Let me tell you something. When the word
[1:47:30] had so struck their heart afterwards,
[1:47:32] they got out there and were dancing.
[1:47:35] What'd you do? Got right out there with
[1:47:37] them. I might have been the only white
[1:47:39] boy among them.
[1:47:41] I was tell you the truth.
[1:47:45] Brother Jeff Snograss is supposed to go
[1:47:46] with me. Why? I mean we what what we we
[1:47:49] have a right to. But you see what have
[1:47:52] we tried to count? Well, you don't need
[1:47:53] to do that or this or that. It's just
[1:47:56] like every church is sovereign.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; This is why that what we need is the
[1:48:03] Holy Spirit.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; God knows just what he's doing even in
[1:48:07] every locality and everything. You know
[1:48:09] what? God don't need us worrying about
[1:48:12] somebody else and this and that. You
[1:48:13] know what? You know what brother Bram
[1:48:15] called it when he got to criticizing
[1:48:17] people?
[1:48:19] Brother Bram called it word made flesh
[1:48:20] India trip a selfish spirit rising up in
[1:48:23] me.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; He said I'm not the one to go around and
[1:48:26] correct everybody and tell everybody
[1:48:27] that they're wrong. And yet in one way
[1:48:29] as the prophet of the hour
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; he did have that authority. But you see
[1:48:33] one thing the prophet of God would show
[1:48:35] us in the openness of his life. I'm not
[1:48:37] highlighting him. I'm just trying to
[1:48:39] show you how God showed this openness to
[1:48:41] where that even in that right there,
[1:48:44] even though he might have had that
[1:48:45] authority,
[1:48:47] but yet the prophet would always deal
[1:48:49] with what's the motive
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; and objective
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; behind it. Just like we might have
[1:48:55] certain rights
[1:48:57] and we might have certain positions, we
[1:48:59] might have certain things, but what is
[1:49:00] our motive and our objective behind it?
[1:49:04] That's why you find remember when the
[1:49:06] prophet talked about he was corrected
[1:49:07] for calling them Ricky's and Ricettas
[1:49:10] right standing in the gap. The prophet
[1:49:12] said, "God let me to know that some of
[1:49:13] them are his children."
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; And he said it like this. If they want
[1:49:17] to serve God if they only knew how.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; So is that the last time he said Ricky
[1:49:25] and Ricketta? No.
[1:49:28] After that he'd say it again. You know
[1:49:30] what the difference was? Motive.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Right. where it was coming from.
[1:49:36] That's where the Holy Spirit's so
[1:49:37] reigning in our lives. That's what we
[1:49:40] want.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just be lovely. I I
[1:49:44] think that's wonderful, friends. I think
[1:49:45] it'd be my goodness, how wonderful,
[1:49:47] lovely. That was wonderful. But what we
[1:49:49] what God has called us to be is to
[1:49:52] become love.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; How many remember the quote? Pick up
[1:49:56] your pen and write. As she nears that
[1:49:59] capstone, she will be so much like him
[1:50:03] till she will be him.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; What is that capstone?
[1:50:07] Is that capstone faith?
[1:50:09] What is that capstone? Love.
[1:50:14] And who is it that's actually operating?
[1:50:17] The prophet tells us in statue of a
[1:50:18] perfect man that's actually operating
[1:50:20] all these virtues all the way down
[1:50:22] through. It's the head. It's the
[1:50:24] capstone. Because we're not being drawn
[1:50:26] downward. We're being drawn upward,
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Spirit has come into our
[1:50:34] life, he has sealed our lives. And then
[1:50:39] we begin to grow. He has the seal of the
[1:50:42] living God. You say, "Brother Sam, I
[1:50:44] thought that seal was up there on the
[1:50:45] capstone." It is. And yet, he sealed
[1:50:48] you. And yet, you're growing into a full
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; stature.
[1:50:53] Your faith is growing. virtue is
[1:50:56] growing. Your patience is growing. Oh,
[1:51:00] that's why I love some of the last
[1:51:02] statements brother Brandham makes in
[1:51:03] Statue of a Perfect Man. He says, "You
[1:51:05] can't even get anywhere with this unless
[1:51:07] you're first born again."
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; And then he stands there at the very
[1:51:10] last, I think it's paragraph 432 or
[1:51:11] something like that. He says, "Oh, with
[1:51:13] my hands up before this congregation,
[1:51:16] let me not cease, God, if I don't
[1:51:19] maintain my home, if I don't maintain
[1:51:21] this, if I don't maintain that, but let
[1:51:23] me maintain Christ, Lord God. Let me not
[1:51:26] cease until I see these virtues
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; flowing freely through my life." Yes.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; See, brother Brandham was a sealed son
[1:51:37] of God, but he realized we're growing in
[1:51:41] the stature
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; of a perfect man.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; And when that capstone sets down in
[1:51:47] reality at the coming of the Lord, the
[1:51:50] rapture comes
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; and it will pull all the way up. All
[1:51:55] that is started on that first base right
[1:51:58] there with faith, that first age, it'll
[1:52:00] pull all of them. The prophet said
[1:52:02] there'll be there'll be that or the
[1:52:03] dynamics will come into the church that
[1:52:05] will absolutely draw them out of the
[1:52:07] grave.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the head uniting with
[1:52:11] the body.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; And yet we realize right now we're not
[1:52:15] walking headless. We're walking under
[1:52:17] the headship of the word. And what is
[1:52:19] the headship of the word come to do?
[1:52:20] It's come to lead us home.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; How can you expect? How could we expect
[1:52:25] to be more like him if he didn't reveal
[1:52:27] more of himself?
[1:52:31] So then the rapture will be the same way
[1:52:33] as it was with Abel's sacrifice. God
[1:52:36] will finally look and say, "That's it.
[1:52:38] Come on.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; That's it." What does he sing himself?
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; He will present to himself,
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; a bride,
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; glorious,
[1:52:50] spotless,
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; without any wrinkle, any blemish, or any
[1:52:55] such thing.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; No imperfections.
[1:52:59] What's done that? His love.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Husbands, love your wives
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; even as Christ so loved the church that
[1:53:08] he gave himself for it to sanctify it
[1:53:12] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[1:53:14] by the word that he might present unto
[1:53:17] himself a glorious church.
[1:53:21] So what are we the product of? His love.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; What his love has called for. I say,
[1:53:28] 'Lord, I want to become love.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; I thank God for what he's done in my
[1:53:35] life. And maybe that's for you tonight.
[1:53:37] You would say, you know what? That's
[1:53:38] that's what I want. I want to become
[1:53:39] love. Maybe I want that. I want that of
[1:53:42] the love of God, the Holy Spirit. Lord,
[1:53:44] I want to be that the expression that
[1:53:48] that of your word. I want Lord that seal
[1:53:51] in my life. Then you know it all starts
[1:53:54] with Lord remedy anything that's unlike
[1:53:57] you.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Just be honest with him. Remedy anything
[1:54:00] because you know what? Those things
[1:54:02] anything that is allowed to linger will
[1:54:04] hinder your approach. Just allow God to
[1:54:08] remedy everything to his word. Then God
[1:54:11] begins to move in and he'll move into
[1:54:13] that place. And then as God has moved
[1:54:16] into that place as believers, we're
[1:54:18] gathered here tonight. No doubt many
[1:54:22] filled with the spirit of God already,
[1:54:24] but yet
[1:54:26] we're still becoming
[1:54:28] love.
[1:54:30] He's changed our lives, but yet we're
[1:54:33] becoming more and more like him
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; through tests, through situations,
[1:54:41] through things that come our way,
[1:54:44] becoming more like him. This is why Paul
[1:54:48] would write over and over to the
[1:54:50] believers that your love would abound,
[1:54:55] grow greater. Come to full, this is what
[1:54:57] the word means. We'll get to it. Come to
[1:55:00] full maturity.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; His love is to be perfected
[1:55:07] in us.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Come to its completion.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; I say yes, Lord. Yes.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Can you Can you sense that drawing upon
[1:55:15] your life, Lord?
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; He's drawing.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you love him, friends?
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Don't you appreciate his goodness?
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; My Where would we be without him?
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; We're here tonight because of him.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Right. We're here tonight because of
[1:55:32] him. Like brother Bram made the
[1:55:33] statement over and over. Brother Brand
[1:55:34] make this in the message. Oh, brother B,
[1:55:36] I don't know about me. I don't know.
[1:55:37] Brother Brand said, "Wait a minute.
[1:55:38] You're here tonight, aren't you?
[1:55:40] What do you think brought you here to
[1:55:42] church tonight?
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; You said it was God.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes it's the little things
[1:55:49] that we overlook.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just, you know, I just it just was
[1:55:55] an idea that popped in my head. You
[1:55:56] know, ideas are not just ideas.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Thoughts are not just thoughts. They're
[1:56:01] spirits.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; That's why when you entertain certain
[1:56:05] thoughts, you'll feel a certain way.
[1:56:08] start entertaining thoughts of the word.
[1:56:10] And the prophet says as you begin to
[1:56:12] just think upon his word and meditate on
[1:56:14] it, he said pretty soon he said you'll
[1:56:16] feel this
[1:56:18] go over. He said, you know what that is?
[1:56:20] That's evidence of the resurrection.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; His presence sweeping over you.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Thoughts are not just
[1:56:29] something that's just, oh, it's nothing.
[1:56:32] It's spirits. But neither is the devil.
[1:56:34] Like some say, oh, the devil's just a
[1:56:36] thought. He's not a thought, but he
[1:56:37] gives thoughts.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Remember, he's got a bow with no arrow.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; He can shoot a lot of wind.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; He can shoot a lot. But God also,
[1:56:50] you don't have a bow. He has a sword.
[1:56:52] And where does that sword come? From his
[1:56:54] mouth.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; From his mouth.
[1:56:59] Hallelujah. That's all my I love how the
[1:57:01] prophet said, he said, you'll notice he
[1:57:03] said he never spoke of you being in his
[1:57:05] mouth. He said, 'You in his hand.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; He said, because it's that lukewarm
[1:57:10] church that he spurts out of his mouth.
[1:57:13] He said he never spoke of the church in
[1:57:15] his mouth. He speaks of the church in
[1:57:17] his hand.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; And you know what? We're in his hand and
[1:57:21] living by the word.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer
[1:57:27] tonight.
[1:57:30] Heavenly Father,
[1:57:33] Lord, you're so mindful, Lord, of our
[1:57:36] needs.
[1:57:38] And I know here tonight, Lord, no doubt
[1:57:41] what's here of your children, those of
[1:57:44] us, Lord God, that are able to gather
[1:57:46] here tonight. Others, Lord, that
[1:57:50] would desire to be here. You know each
[1:57:52] one, Lord, that's
[1:57:54] here a part and a part of this assembly,
[1:57:56] Lord. Others that would stream it. But I
[1:57:58] pray that Lord as you know our needs
[1:58:04] Lord I pray
[1:58:08] Lord Jesus may you move down Lord I pray
[1:58:11] as you have here tonight and if there's
[1:58:14] a heart Lord that is just looking and
[1:58:17] longing just longing for more of you
[1:58:19] Lord I there's things that I still see
[1:58:21] in my life it hinders
[1:58:26] but I believe you are not only able, I
[1:58:29] believe you're willing to take, Lord
[1:58:32] God, every desire out of my life.
[1:58:35] Let me become love.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Let more of the same Holy Spirit that
[1:58:40] has drawn me continue to work on my
[1:58:43] life. Continue to work in me, Lord.
[1:58:47] Remedy everything of my life that Lord
[1:58:50] God, I want to be a fit
[1:58:53] sanctuary.
[1:58:56] I want to be put in service, but I know
[1:58:58] to be put in service, it takes you to
[1:59:01] met make me a fit tabernacle.
[1:59:05] For when your presence came down there
[1:59:07] in Moses' time, Solomon's time, when
[1:59:11] your presence came down after the
[1:59:12] sacrifices were offered,
[1:59:16] that was you declaring the finished
[1:59:19] work. The tabernacle was not finished
[1:59:23] when it was left empty.
[1:59:25] But the tabernacle was deemed finished
[1:59:29] when you stepped inside,
[1:59:34] Lord. Although as you step inside of our
[1:59:36] lives in a finished work of Calvary
[1:59:41] and true when Lord God that old nature
[1:59:44] has passed away,
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; all things have become new and from that
[1:59:50] finished work in our life is a new
[1:59:53] creation.
[1:59:55] And behold, all things are new,
[2:00:00] Lord God, as we'll continue to grow in
[2:00:04] the grace and knowledge of our Lord
[2:00:07] Jesus Christ,
[2:00:09] growing
[2:00:10] up unto you in all things.
[2:00:15] Help us, Lord.
[2:00:17] Father,
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; I believe right here tonight, Lord,
[2:00:22] when not only there's not only trophies
[2:00:24] that's here, I believe I'm one of them
[2:00:26] that have become love to that place,
[2:00:29] Lord, of where our lives have been
[2:00:30] sealed.
[2:00:33] And yet, we know that you're still
[2:00:36] working on us, Lord. that it's not
[2:00:38] something that is going to come from the
[2:00:40] outside in,
[2:00:42] but it's actually
[2:00:45] that part
[2:00:47] of a son and daughter of God on the
[2:00:49] inside
[2:00:50] that actually grows
[2:00:54] more and more in your image because this
[2:00:57] flesh is not Samuel Browning, but this
[2:00:59] is the flesh of Samuel Browning.
[2:01:04] Lord Jesus,
[2:01:07] I pray that Lord that you would do the
[2:01:10] work Lord for every heart and for each
[2:01:13] one of us. Lord,
[2:01:16] may you bring each one Lord to where we
[2:01:18] need to be.
[2:01:20] May you Lord God, I pray
[2:01:23] continue Lord just to
[2:01:26] Lord God drawing upon our lives and help
[2:01:29] us Lord most of all help us not to lean
[2:01:32] to our own understanding
[2:01:35] but help us to lean upon you Lord
[2:01:37] forgive us Lord God of our shortcomings
[2:01:41] Lord as you stand in view as you come in
[2:01:44] view my all that we can see Lord we see
[2:01:47] our littleness we see our need of You
[2:01:50] your prophet has told us that we must
[2:01:52] master the thought of human ability. And
[2:01:55] Lord, how at times that you help us with
[2:01:59] such divine grace
[2:02:02] to show us the need
[2:02:05] and that mastering of human human
[2:02:07] ability is to recognize
[2:02:10] we can do nothing
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; of ourselves.
[2:02:15] But it's as we'll yield to you,
[2:02:18] Lord. Some some of us, Lord, well, I
[2:02:21] I'll say all of us, Lord God, how so
[2:02:25] many times would like to just say, "Oh,
[2:02:27] this weakness, this weakness."
[2:02:30] But Lord God, may we submit that
[2:02:33] weakness to you.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Because those weaknesses are
[2:02:37] opportunities when they're surrendered
[2:02:39] to you for you to pour yourself into,
[2:02:42] and you'll use yourself.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[2:02:47] If there's one place we don't need to be
[2:02:49] ashamed as it was,
[2:02:52] but we need Lord God to be open, it's in
[2:02:55] your presence.
[2:02:58] Even Lord God, conviction itself. Sure.
[2:03:00] And there's things that we can feel
[2:03:02] shame, but there's a place, Lord God,
[2:03:04] there's a blood that's already been shed
[2:03:07] that can not only take care of the
[2:03:09] guilt,
[2:03:11] but it can take care of reasons as well,
[2:03:13] too.
[2:03:15] Lord, I pray tonight, Lord God, may you
[2:03:17] take each and every one of us, Lord, by
[2:03:19] the hand.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Lead us, Lord, I pray, Lord, in this
[2:03:24] hour that our lives
[2:03:27] be that expression
[2:03:29] as your prophet said, as we believe, we
[2:03:31] become love. Help us, Lord.
[2:03:35] May we become
[2:03:37] love
[2:03:38] more and more and more.
[2:03:43] How long? Well, either until
[2:03:48] you say
[2:03:50] it's time to come home. Whether it's by
[2:03:53] the way of the grave or in the rapture,
[2:03:58] we know that Lord,
[2:04:00] you'll never let
[2:04:02] character be overripened.
[2:04:05] But when it gets to that place,
[2:04:08] it's like a flower that's come to
[2:04:10] perfection. and you pluck it out of the
[2:04:12] field
[2:04:14] and you take it,
[2:04:17] it's come to its place of perfection.
[2:04:21] Oh God, help us. Help us each and every
[2:04:24] one, Lord.
[2:04:27] Lord God, if there's one thing I want,
[2:04:31] I want more of you, Lord.
[2:04:34] Less of me, Lord.
[2:04:37] Lord, help me to die. Give me the grace
[2:04:39] to die more to Samuel.
[2:04:42] Lord God, not only me, but show every
[2:04:44] one of us, Lord God.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; It's really not something, Lord, of a
[2:04:48] great mystery. It's not something that's
[2:04:50] Lord hidden, but it's actually daily in
[2:04:53] our lives.
[2:04:55] Help us.
[2:04:57] Help us, Lord.
[2:05:00] Help us to live so close to you.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.

[2:05:11] need that's here tonight.

[2:05:20] for the glory of God.

[2:05:33] of getting everything we want.

[2:05:43] living this life just for us.

[2:18:00] been expressed and revealed to us Lord
[2:18:04] has taken a hold of our lives
[2:18:07] and Lord God has brought us the place of
[2:18:09] yielding surrender
[2:18:13] cleansing
[2:18:15] filling. Oh Lord God we love you. Thank
[2:18:19] you Lord for your grace through every
[2:18:22] test and every trial.
[2:18:26] Thank you, Lord, for every time you've
[2:18:28] told us no.
[2:18:31] Even though, Lord, it might have been
[2:18:33] things that maybe we wanted or maybe
[2:18:35] somewhere to go or this or that, but
[2:18:37] God, we value your will more than we
[2:18:40] value our wants.
[2:18:42] Thank you, Lord God, for your mercy,
[2:18:46] Lord Jesus.
[2:18:48] We are what we are by the grace of God.
[2:18:52] It's because of you, Lord.
[2:18:54] Lord God, we didn't even have the right
[2:18:56] kind of love to love you,
[2:18:59] but you first loved us.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; You made a deposit of your own love, of
[2:19:04] your own life.
[2:19:07] So, it's actually not us, but it's you
[2:19:11] through us
[2:19:13] loving right back. We're a reflection,
[2:19:17] Lord.
[2:19:19] We're a reflection.
[2:19:21] The church is not the sun. We're a moon.
[2:19:24] We're a reflection to shine the light in
[2:19:27] the absence.
[2:19:29] Lord God, grant it. Lord, may our lives,
[2:19:32] Lord, as we go among our families, go
[2:19:34] among different ones in the workplace,
[2:19:36] may it really shine the real true love
[2:19:39] of God.
[2:19:40] Oh God, that Lord Jesus, your love, your
[2:19:44] care, Lord, to become one of us. Even to
[2:19:47] where you would walk down in shoe
[2:19:49] leather, in a workplace, in a family,
[2:19:51] Lord, to reveal yourself to be the same
[2:19:54] yesterday, today, and forever, Lord,
[2:19:57] that you care.
[2:19:59] Oh, granted, Lord God, how we love you,
[2:20:02] Father. How we appreciate you tonight,
[2:20:05] Lord.
[2:20:07] May you go with us, Lord, as we would go
[2:20:08] our separate ways,
[2:20:11] Lord. Even though we would come to an
[2:20:12] end of a service, but our worship,
[2:20:15] Lord God, it hasn't come to an end. Our
[2:20:18] worship continues,
[2:20:21] Lord, as we continue to give ourselves
[2:20:23] to this word and to you, Lord God, for
[2:20:25] you are the word.
[2:20:28] allowing the spirit of God just Lord the
[2:20:30] combing over the man that we saw in the
[2:20:32] mirror Lord God help us Lord I pray
[2:20:38] for truly
[2:20:40] it's been the divine love of God that's
[2:20:42] come among us tonight
[2:20:45] that's what you've given to us Lord your
[2:20:48] word your love
[2:20:51] grant it watch over your children Lord
[2:20:56] we ask it Lord all in the precious name
[2:20:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:21:02] for
[2:21:05] oh
[2:21:08] [Music]

[2:21:14] Mount Calvary

[2:21:41] Jesus.

[2:21:49] my soul.
[2:21:53] Oh thank you Lord. Thank you Lord.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[2:22:02] [Music]
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:22:10] Had it not been
[2:22:14] for the old rugy
[2:22:18] cross.
[2:22:22] had it not been
[2:22:26] for a man
[2:22:28] called Jesus.
[2:22:33] Then forever
[2:22:37] my soul would
[2:22:41] be lost.
[2:22:45] Oh,
[2:22:47] had enough
[2:22:50] for a place
[2:22:53] called Mount Calary.
[2:22:56] [Music]
[2:22:58] Oh, had it not been for the old
[2:23:06] rug cross
[2:23:15] for man
[2:23:18] called Jesus
[2:23:21] [Music]
[2:23:24] then forever
[2:23:28] My soul will
[2:23:31] be lost
[2:23:37] at an

[2:23:42] that was called Jesus.

[2:23:57] be long.
