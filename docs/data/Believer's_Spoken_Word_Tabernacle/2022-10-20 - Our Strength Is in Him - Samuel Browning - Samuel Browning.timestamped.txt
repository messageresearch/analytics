[37:11] word of prayer here and you have a need
[37:13] on your heart just make it known to him
[37:15] God is mindful he's proven over and over
[37:18] again he's mindful of our needs and
[37:23] maybe the answer we what we think is the
[37:25] answer
[37:26] God's the one who's the answer he's the
[37:28] one who has the answer
[37:30] sometimes the very things that you know
[37:33] brother Brown took a situation when he
[37:34] was out there hunting this brother had
[37:37] had a dream
[37:38] the brother thought it was a little
[37:39] jokey but Ram tells us in Christ the
[37:41] mystery he said come to find out the
[37:44] dream that he had was the very answer
[37:47] to the situation with his home
[37:51] he said sometimes the things that we
[37:52] think
[37:53] can seem a little this way but
[37:56] God is the answer
[37:58] and just in his presence a man cannot
[38:01] make these things known to us but in his
[38:03] presence and I think we're gathered
[38:04] together tonight as believers
[38:07] just expecting God to come on the scene
[38:10] just to move Among Us in a way that he
[38:14] knows he knows our needs
[38:16] the Bible said that the eyes of the Lord
[38:18] run to and fro throughout all the Earth
[38:21] even at times when you feel like that
[38:24] maybe your prayer Lord is my prayer even
[38:26] being heard you know brother Brandon
[38:28] would stand there on the on the platform
[38:29] and he said I I see you kneeling by the
[38:33] side of the bed and and this is what
[38:34] you're praying and he said what it is he
[38:36] said I'm hearing your prayer in a land
[38:40] called prayer
[38:42] a land called prayer
[38:46] so our prayers are not just going up and
[38:48] hitting hitting the ceiling
[38:51] but our prayers are going
[38:52] in a land called prayer
[38:55] Before the Throne of God and God is
[38:58] mindful you know God doesn't let one
[39:00] prayer pass by as a matter of fact even
[39:02] of the prayers that's been offered down
[39:04] through the ages in regarding for
[39:06] Redemption they've just been piled up
[39:10] they're in a great sensor
[39:12] and one of these days it's going to be
[39:15] poured out
[39:17] God answers every prayer
[39:21] he answers every prayer
[39:25] every prayer
[39:28] let's just go before him
[39:30] Heavenly Father
[39:32] Lord we're standing Lord in a wonderful
[39:36] place tonight in your presence Lord
[39:39] under the Precious Blood of the Lamb
[39:42] and Lord how thankful we are for our
[39:45] sacrifice we're thankful for that
[39:47] precious blood we're thankful for the
[39:50] life that was wrapped in that blood cell
[39:52] that has been released oh God Upon Us
[39:56] Lord as the worshiper God we we
[39:59] recognize we were included in that
[40:02] sacrifice Lord
[40:04] we're the reason of that sacrifice we
[40:07] believe that Lord because your Grace has
[40:09] made that known to his Lord and how we
[40:12] thank you Father for the washing of
[40:14] Water by the word Lord as we stand
[40:17] tonight we are standing here as
[40:20] Believers the Lord just with the reality
[40:22] that you answer every prayer Lord
[40:26] you answer every prayer Lord we know
[40:30] Lord there's there's sometimes the Lord
[40:32] where there's things that we could pray
[40:33] like when Abraham prayed about Ishmael
[40:36] well you couldn't do that but you
[40:38] ministered to Abraham Lord in that way
[40:41] that God you're The God Who fulfills
[40:44] your word not according to how we're
[40:46] looking at it to be fulfilled Ishmael
[40:48] was not the one that you had in mind it
[40:50] was Isaac Lord
[40:52] and so father your faithfulness was to
[40:54] guide and direct Abraham even in that
[40:58] moment Lord
[40:59] father you answer every prayer now may
[41:02] you just come Lord minister to our
[41:05] hearts Lord may we step aside tonight's
[41:08] speaker and congregation and may you
[41:10] step down among us as you did on the
[41:12] road of Emmaus Lord and just speak to
[41:14] our hearts tonight in a very personal
[41:16] way you know Lord you know the thoughts
[41:18] of our hearts Lord and we just commit
[41:21] Our Lives to you and ask that you would
[41:23] come Lord take control now Lord

[42:14] to men stand in on Sunday and uh
[42:17] certainly appreciate that in Psalms 84
[42:20] and I just want to read a few verses of
[42:22] scripture here tonight
[42:26] laughs
[42:27] here it is it says how admeable
[42:30] are thy Tabernacles O Lord of hosts look
[42:33] how David would write regarding the
[42:36] courts of the Lord how admirable are thy
[42:38] Tabernacles O Lord of hosts my soul
[42:42] longeth yea even fainteth for the courts
[42:47] of the Lord my heart and my flesh cryeth
[42:52] out praise for the Living God
[42:54] yea the sparrow hath found an house and
[42:58] the swallow and nest for herself where
[43:00] she may lay her young even thine altars
[43:04] O Lord of hosts my king and my God
[43:08] blessed are they that dwell in thy house
[43:12] they will still they will be still
[43:16] praising thee Salah
[43:19] blessed is the man whose strength is in
[43:24] thee
[43:25] whose heart are the ways of them
[43:30] we're just going to ask the Lord to
[43:31] bless the reading of the word we'll just
[43:33] stop there this evening you may have
[43:35] your seats
[43:37] I want to just speak here tonight on
[43:39] just a little thought we've been looking
[43:41] at appropriate responses I want to just
[43:44] speak here tonight just take a little
[43:46] portion from that scripture on our
[43:48] strength is in him yeah I want to just
[43:52] really dwell upon that just that
[43:54] scripture here tonight because this this
[43:57] whole chapter if you have an opportunity
[43:59] to read it no doubt you've read it
[44:01] before it's been one of those chapters
[44:03] that for me I've been drawn to for so
[44:06] many times and come back and just
[44:07] meditate on and I find myself in studies
[44:10] just keep on coming back to it and
[44:12] everything continues to tie back in and
[44:15] and then as I just looking at this you
[44:17] know Charles Spurgeon how many of you
[44:19] know Charles Spurgeon there's a
[44:21] devotional and Charles Spurgeon was just
[44:23] uh they called him a prince of preachers
[44:25] Charles purgeon was just I just enjoy
[44:27] his devotionals too and Charles Spurgeon
[44:30] would call this Psalm the pearl of the
[44:33] Psalms
[44:34] and when you look we can see this and
[44:36] we're just going to move just a little
[44:38] bit here this evening in verse 5 of how
[44:41] that this what a what a word of comfort
[44:43] and how that God's word does bring us
[44:45] comfort and blessed is the man whose
[44:48] strength is in thee in whose heart are
[44:52] the ways of them and the the reality of
[44:55] how that it is written when it says in
[44:57] whose heart is the ways of them it's
[44:59] actually to be read in this manner
[45:01] blessed is the man whose strength is in
[45:04] you whose heart is set on pilgrimage
[45:09] so this life that you and I that we know
[45:15] and and this is all that as far as that
[45:18] we have known as far as seeing tasting
[45:20] and feeling so forth outside of the
[45:23] contact of the holy spirit with our
[45:25] lives we then recognize that this life
[45:29] is not our destiny
[45:31] but our but our destiny is of that of
[45:36] the new heavens and new earth
[45:38] our destiny is is not confined to these
[45:41] mortal bodies this is not our end even
[45:44] as the Bible would say that this this
[45:46] body that we you and I are in is not our
[45:49] inheritance but it is our possession we
[45:53] possess it by the grace of God and so
[45:56] when we look at this and through the
[45:59] Psalms of how that David and I think how
[46:02] Deva would write and you can look at
[46:04] this in many places of the Psalms even
[46:07] if you just take the word house and you
[46:09] look it up in the Psalms and just look
[46:11] at how many times that you find David
[46:13] speaking of his desire to dwell in the
[46:17] house of the Lord oh how my heart even
[46:19] as we read here it fainted for the house
[46:22] of the Lord if we read on further in the
[46:24] scripture David would describe of the
[46:26] pleasure it is to be in the house of the
[46:29] Lord in that even if I'm just a
[46:31] doorkeeper it would be better to be at
[46:34] your house as a doorkeeper than dwell in
[46:37] the tents of the wicked it would be
[46:40] better as David could say it would be
[46:42] better one day in your presence is
[46:44] better than a thousand days elsewhere
[46:48] David was one who was locked in on being
[46:51] in the house of God it showed that there
[46:54] was a longing within David that David
[46:57] knew there was a place that I can dwell
[46:59] that I don't have to ever leave it was
[47:03] the spirit of Christ that was even
[47:05] announcing in David's life there is
[47:08] coming a place where the believer can
[47:11] dwell and never have to depart any
[47:14] longer there's a place where we can
[47:17] dwell in the very presence of God and
[47:19] when I think of that how he would be
[47:21] wrote In This Way blessed is the man
[47:24] whose strength is in you the man who
[47:28] finds his strength in God whose heart is
[47:31] set on pilgrimage that that this life is
[47:34] not what defines who I am but what
[47:37] defines who I am it comes from another
[47:40] realm this life is is not what defines
[47:44] me in this in this nationality ethnicity
[47:47] or whatever my defining of who I am it
[47:50] comes from the Heavenly this is only a
[47:53] temporary dwelling I don't even know how
[47:56] many months how the space of time that's
[47:59] all in God's hands but in the meantime
[48:01] this is a pilgrimage can I say it
[48:05] tonight your trial is not your destiny
[48:08] your trial is not your Bode but the
[48:12] trial that you're in is only a part a
[48:15] fragment a peace and my new part of the
[48:19] pilgrimage that we are on to the other
[48:22] side
[48:24] so we are we do not as pilgrims of God
[48:27] we do not rely on ourself no no we do
[48:31] not rely on the on the world or the
[48:34] strength that it could that we could uh
[48:36] seek to try to have or relief in that
[48:39] way but we are as the Bible says
[48:42] pilgrims and strangers yeah
[48:46] once the spirit of God has alerted and
[48:49] come into our life by this by the whole
[48:52] by the the new birth we are pilgrims and
[48:55] strangers here upon this Earth and we
[48:58] recognize that the house of God that
[49:01] we're speaking of the house of God is
[49:03] not just these walls right here this is
[49:07] a place that God has given us together
[49:09] and to be refreshed and it's true every
[49:12] time we come here it's to be an
[49:14] individual meeting between us and God
[49:17] but that's really how every day is
[49:19] supposed to be it's an individual
[49:21] meeting between us and God and yet God
[49:25] would provide for us a place that you
[49:27] and I can come and gather that we can
[49:30] then receive strength from him and even
[49:33] encouragement from one another and this
[49:37] is God's desire for as he said that he
[49:39] would desire that we would assemble
[49:41] ourselves together knowing that there is
[49:43] a strength that comes through the body
[49:45] you realize brother that when we come
[49:47] together as Believers he said there is
[49:50] an assembling of the godhead bodily
[49:53] there are licks of fire that are coming
[49:55] together because we are not just a
[49:57] natural people we are a supernatural
[50:00] people we are led by the angel of the
[50:03] Lord the pillar of power is Among Us God
[50:06] has divided himself into his vessels and
[50:09] when we come together it is the more of
[50:13] the body that God had bodily the pillar
[50:15] of power that is gathered right here we
[50:18] receive strength from one another
[50:21] is that right
[50:25] amen I know Satan's desire is to you
[50:27] know he he wants to always put us on an
[50:30] island to ourselves and sometimes the
[50:32] way Satan wants to do is to de-emphasize
[50:35] the need for the body but God never
[50:37] de-emphasized that
[50:39] sometimes you and I may not see it but
[50:41] remember we're not Natural Born we're
[50:43] not people that are limited to just our
[50:46] senses if we are we are among people
[50:49] most miserable but we recognize even
[50:52] when you come here to the house of God
[50:54] you can come in with a great difficulty
[50:56] a great problem or something that's on
[50:58] your heart but yet there's an
[51:00] expectation in your heart that beyond my
[51:03] doubts Beyond every hindrance I believe
[51:06] that God is going to speak to me if God
[51:09] has to take the man of God from off of
[51:11] his notes whatever it is I God is going
[51:14] to meet my need oh when we can come in
[51:17] that way we find that we receive
[51:19] strength from almighty God we are not
[51:22] here as Spectators in this service we
[51:25] are here to receive strength from El
[51:28] Shady eyes
[51:30] glory be to God and so in our pilgrimage
[51:33] right here we're just passing through
[51:37] blessed is the man in in blessed is that
[51:41] man in whose strength is in thee not in
[51:45] the world
[51:47] not in what this has to offer but in
[51:50] thee whose hearts in whose heart are the
[51:53] ways of them so we are a pilgrim and
[51:56] dwelling in the house of God
[51:58] the house of God As We Know is the body
[52:02] of Jesus Christ
[52:03] is that right God came down and
[52:05] Tabernacle in our midst and here he was
[52:08] restoring what was what Adam fell from
[52:11] and what rightfully belonged to you and
[52:13] I and he made a way that we can come in
[52:16] to our inheritance to receive the in her
[52:19] in Earnest of it of the holy spirit that
[52:22] ties us back in to our Eternal
[52:25] inheritance and here the body of Jesus
[52:28] Christ is the house of God which the
[52:32] body is the word
[52:34] and how do we get in there there's one
[52:37] way to get into it there's there's the
[52:39] secret way and it's First Corinthians 12
[52:42] by one Spirit we are all baptized into
[52:46] that body of the word
[52:49] so where is Christ's dwelling Christ is
[52:52] not dwelling somewhere far off he's
[52:54] dwelling right in the midst of his
[52:56] church
[52:58] can I preacher a moment brother man
[53:00] talks about entertaining strangers and
[53:02] he said how do you know that that
[53:05] brother or that sister sitting right
[53:07] next to you tonight he says there is
[53:10] Jesus veiled in that life and he's there
[53:13] to minister to your need it's not the
[53:16] strength of your brother or sister but
[53:18] it's the strength of almighty God
[53:21] thank you
[53:22] Hallelujah it ain't just in a pasture
[53:26] come on that's reverse nickelodeonism
[53:28] every time people want to call call out
[53:30] preachers on Nickelodeon what about
[53:32] reverse nickelodeonism
[53:34] what about what about people wanting to
[53:36] put everything in the Pulpit here we
[53:38] don't want everything in the Pulpit he's
[53:40] God of the entire congregation he's
[53:43] proud of the entire body
[53:46] are you with me he's just as much God
[53:49] for you as he is for me
[53:52] whoa
[53:54] oh Hallelujah here we are in journey and
[53:58] the Lord Jesus would tell you and I let
[54:00] not your heart be troubled
[54:04] Hallelujah if you believe in God believe
[54:07] also in me in my father's house are many
[54:11] mansions and if it were not so I would
[54:14] have told you I'd go prepare a place for
[54:17] you so I'm a pilgrim and my heart gets
[54:21] set on this goal in my father's house
[54:24] are many Dwelling Places
[54:27] in my father's house is my theophany
[54:32] in my father's house that's the promised
[54:34] land of the hour that we are called to
[54:37] this is the Third Exodus and it's on and
[54:40] this is the promise that we have before
[54:42] us
[54:43] we're not moving without a promise you
[54:46] see without a promise you have nothing
[54:48] to look to
[54:50] you but you have to have a promise what
[54:53] is a promise it's a goal it's something
[54:55] you can expect you can look to you can
[54:58] draw from and we have a promise in my
[55:01] father's house are many mansions that's
[55:03] my goal that's my objective I know where
[55:07] I come from and I know what I'm going
[55:10] that's right what do you say this is not
[55:14] my final resting place
[55:17] this trial is not my destiny
[55:21] [Applause]
[55:24] Hallelujah when you're on a trip and you
[55:28] have to stop for a restroom break or to
[55:31] get you know stretch your legs or to get
[55:33] a bite to eat wherever you stop
[55:37] kids when they're little
[55:39] are we there yet
[55:41] are we there yet maybe sometimes as
[55:43] adults will ask that are we there yet
[55:46] because we sure like to be there
[55:48] yeah right right right our legs are
[55:51] about cramped up we say let me out I'll
[55:53] run and I'll beat you there
[55:56] but you see those are just stopping
[55:58] points
[56:00] places along the way
[56:03] so trials are not our destiny
[56:07] they're only places along the way
[56:11] but our destiny is the other side I've
[56:15] come from God I'm going back to God
[56:18] you see the power of a promise in front
[56:21] of you how did Joshua and Caleb face
[56:24] those spies they had a promise made by a
[56:27] promise keeping God and they saw that
[56:30] promise is greater and stronger than the
[56:33] Giants that's standing in front of me
[56:35] they drew strength from that promise
[56:40] that's why you've got to have a promise
[56:44] you've got to have a promise in every
[56:46] situation of life when turmoil and
[56:49] everything is going wrong and going the
[56:51] route you've got to have a promise that
[56:53] you're drawing from because situations
[56:56] in life are not always going to go our
[56:58] way and they don't have to go away
[57:01] sometimes God's got to bring us to
[57:03] places and to get us to a place that we
[57:05] realize I'm trying to get my own way in
[57:09] this
[57:09] Hallelujah
[57:12] amen
[57:15] we better just move on tonight
[57:18] look at this this going somewhere
[57:21] First Peter chapter 1 verse 3 blessed be
[57:25] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[57:27] Christ which according to His abundant
[57:29] Mercy hath begotten us again unto a
[57:34] lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[57:36] Christ from the dead
[57:38] so now this is as he said have begotten
[57:42] us again so here is we are partakers of
[57:46] that Resurrection
[57:48] we we are ply takers because as he was
[57:51] dead and there's a lot forevermore
[57:53] that's where you and I stand as
[57:55] Believers when the Holy Spirit has come
[57:57] how was once dead but now I'm alive by
[58:01] the resurrection power of Jesus Christ
[58:04] he has begotten us not me but he has
[58:09] begotten us unto a lively Hope by the
[58:12] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[58:14] dead so this is not a dead hope this is
[58:16] not a hopeless hope this is a true
[58:19] living expectation
[58:22] verse 4 to an inheritance what have we
[58:25] been begotten to to an inheritance
[58:28] Incorruptible
[58:30] undefiled and fadeth not away sure is
[58:33] not talking about this natural body
[58:35] Trenton talking about our human spirit
[58:37] either so where is this inheritance
[58:39] that's incorruptible
[58:41] where is it that it's undefiled and it
[58:44] does not fade away does not age
[58:47] nothing it stands within Perfection
[58:50] where is this reserved in heaven for you
[58:56] not here but reserved in heaven for us
[58:59] don't you see when we can look at this
[59:02] and have a promise that is before us
[59:04] then no matter what we go through in
[59:06] life we have a place that we can look
[59:08] and we can see I don't know what's going
[59:11] on here I don't know what's happening
[59:13] right now and even though I'm in the
[59:15] midst of sorrow and mourning and grief
[59:17] and on and on that is going on but yet I
[59:20] have a promise before me and what
[59:24] happens that promise you have before you
[59:26] is what you draw strength from to endure
[59:30] the things you're going through now
[59:33] is that right
[59:35] now remember brother Branham when he
[59:37] spoke about this in the adoption series
[59:39] remember he was talking to his wife and
[59:41] he's talking about you know I just want
[59:43] to I just want to go ahead and go on
[59:45] home I just want to go ahead and go on
[59:47] home
[59:48] remember what the Holy Spirit spoke to
[59:49] him and said
[59:51] are you trying to dodge
[59:53] your trials
[59:55] you trying to dodge him
[59:57] you want the easy way out just go on
[1:00:00] you're trying to dodge him and what
[1:00:01] brother Graham said I said Lord
[1:00:03] forgive me
[1:00:05] who's whose flesh wouldn't want to dodge
[1:00:07] problems
[1:00:10] y'all like when things come up and put a
[1:00:11] kink in the host I don't do you I don't
[1:00:13] think anybody does right all of a sudden
[1:00:16] here you are cooking a nice steak on the
[1:00:17] grill gas goes out
[1:00:20] anybody like that like whoa
[1:00:22] no you're of all times the gas can
[1:00:27] be fine on hot dogs I'd have been just
[1:00:29] fine no you wouldn't if you'd have been
[1:00:30] complaining then too
[1:00:32] right
[1:00:33] because of what were things we look at
[1:00:36] of is inconvenience
[1:00:38] is that right but this is reserved in
[1:00:42] heaven for us who are what kept by the
[1:00:47] power of God through faith unto
[1:00:50] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[1:00:53] last time
[1:00:55] now let me just say it like this
[1:00:57] uh let me let me just skip just a few
[1:01:00] places here so I can deal with this on
[1:01:02] on the strength of almighty God
[1:01:05] and you find that how that that Peter
[1:01:08] would go on and he would say wherein you
[1:01:11] greatly Rejoice though now for a season
[1:01:14] if need be you are in heaviness through
[1:01:17] manifold Temptation manifold means
[1:01:19] various
[1:01:21] comes in various forms
[1:01:24] right
[1:01:25] manifold if need be now you and I would
[1:01:28] never say Lord I need a I need a trial
[1:01:32] if you do you need prayer for even
[1:01:33] asking that
[1:01:36] see God allots the trials based on
[1:01:40] what we have need of
[1:01:42] is that right that the trial of your
[1:01:46] faith now notice what's being tried not
[1:01:49] your body not your spirit your faith
[1:01:53] our body will fail
[1:01:55] our human spirit will fail
[1:02:00] but remember what Jesus said to Peter I
[1:02:03] have prayed that thy
[1:02:04] Faith failed not
[1:02:08] Oh Glory
[1:02:10] being much more precious than of gold
[1:02:14] that perishes so what's greater than any
[1:02:17] type of gold your faith
[1:02:19] though it your faith be tried with fire
[1:02:22] might be found unto praise and honor and
[1:02:25] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:02:27] now God is not standing back and God
[1:02:30] looking at brother Joshua and saying wow
[1:02:33] I didn't realize that laid within you no
[1:02:35] God knows it all the time
[1:02:37] God knows that God's Not Looking Back
[1:02:39] and say whoa I didn't know that was in
[1:02:40] brown I didn't know there was in Ray wow
[1:02:42] I didn't know that was in Rita wow no no
[1:02:44] God knows what's there
[1:02:47] he knows what's there now remember
[1:02:49] remember in order to bring that out God
[1:02:51] and he has to actually bring that from
[1:02:54] what's within this Earth because out of
[1:02:56] this Earth there is nothing out of this
[1:02:58] Earth that God is trying to bring out
[1:03:00] but it's the very character of Christ
[1:03:03] that God wants to bring on display in
[1:03:06] our life
[1:03:07] now think of it here is to be into the
[1:03:10] praise and glory of almighty God now
[1:03:12] notice in verse 8 whom having not seen
[1:03:15] you love
[1:03:17] isn't that powerful we've not seen him
[1:03:19] I'm not seeing the nail scarred hands
[1:03:21] I'm not seeing the Lord Jesus the
[1:03:23] physical Corporal body but I'm going to
[1:03:27] pray but I love him
[1:03:29] I love him
[1:03:31] amen because to recognize that the same
[1:03:34] one that dwelt there the same Jesus has
[1:03:37] returned back that same life and moved
[1:03:40] and made himself known to you and me by
[1:03:43] the Holy Spirit through his word and
[1:03:46] there is a love affair whom though I
[1:03:48] have not seen you have not seen we love
[1:03:51] him
[1:03:54] we love him in whom though now you see
[1:03:59] him not wow
[1:04:01] yet believe it
[1:04:04] yeah well that does away with anybody
[1:04:05] from Missouri don't it
[1:04:07] because Missouri is I got to see it to
[1:04:09] believe it
[1:04:11] the truth but you understand now you see
[1:04:14] him not you don't see him physically but
[1:04:17] yet you believe him what gives that
[1:04:19] quality it's faith
[1:04:23] you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[1:04:26] full of Glory receiving the end of your
[1:04:29] faith even the salvation of your soul so
[1:04:32] receiving the end of our faith even the
[1:04:35] salvation of our souls it speaks there
[1:04:38] is a pilgrimage there is a journey
[1:04:42] there's a maturing of our faith
[1:04:45] amen there's a growing of our faith do
[1:04:47] you realize that our love is even to
[1:04:48] grow
[1:04:49] now the love of God remember has Paul
[1:04:51] would admonish the Believers that we
[1:04:53] would abound in the love of God
[1:04:56] that our faith would grow
[1:04:59] oh my now think of this how God would
[1:05:02] would come and God would permit job to
[1:05:06] be tested and tried remember how Satan
[1:05:09] spoke against job but I want you to
[1:05:10] think about this strength when Satan
[1:05:13] Satan even had a testimony after all
[1:05:16] things around job were taken away and
[1:05:19] Satan stood there in the prince of God
[1:05:21] and said
[1:05:22] this guy is holding fast his integrity
[1:05:27] God made Satan defy in his presence
[1:05:36] he hadn't Satan had made a bet with God
[1:05:40] I think brother Cadre had made a
[1:05:41] statement like that he there was a
[1:05:44] debate going on and then here in this
[1:05:47] moment Satan had to testify he still
[1:05:51] holding his integrity
[1:05:54] then Albert you know Satan comes and
[1:05:57] says let me touch his body because all I
[1:05:59] got to do is touch his body
[1:06:02] if I touch his body
[1:06:04] that's it he's going to curse you
[1:06:06] because man will give anything for his
[1:06:08] life
[1:06:10] well that's if he hasn't found another
[1:06:12] life
[1:06:14] if he hadn't found another source are
[1:06:17] you with me so Satan you know Satan is
[1:06:20] looking at when he's coming to give test
[1:06:23] and trial Satan is not coming in on job
[1:06:26] as a helpless being Satan is coming in
[1:06:29] there with the full intent that I am
[1:06:32] going to cause this man to turn around
[1:06:35] and curse God but what's Satan
[1:06:38] underestimated what's the strength that
[1:06:42] was in the blood of the sacrifice he
[1:06:46] underestimated the power of divine
[1:06:49] revelation
[1:06:52] and God allowed him to test it
[1:06:56] God wasn't worried God didn't take out
[1:07:00] life insurance policies on this
[1:07:03] come on now because he knew Satan is
[1:07:07] looking at the flesh he's looking at
[1:07:09] everything that's around but he's
[1:07:10] underestimating the strength that lays
[1:07:14] within the revelation of the blood of
[1:07:16] the sacrifice
[1:07:19] oh my like my brother Cadre put it last
[1:07:22] week as well as we were looking at that
[1:07:24] job was not his strength he was strength
[1:07:27] was not that in his cattle or his uh you
[1:07:30] know all the oxen and you know one of
[1:07:33] his children his strength was not in all
[1:07:35] of those things around him his strength
[1:07:37] was not in his own health his strength
[1:07:39] was not in his life his strength was in
[1:07:42] his sacrifice
[1:07:46] the country I think used a word instead
[1:07:48] of strength but you know what it means
[1:07:49] you use the word connected but that's
[1:07:51] where his strength was
[1:07:53] or by the time you know why is that
[1:07:54] important because if your strength is in
[1:07:55] something else you let something else be
[1:07:57] touched and your strength is gone
[1:07:59] if your strength is in your bank account
[1:08:01] uh oh better watch out if that bank
[1:08:03] account goes then your strength will go
[1:08:05] and as your strength goes it'll manifest
[1:08:08] itself in your life
[1:08:10] are you hearing me now I'm talking about
[1:08:12] the strength of almighty God
[1:08:15] we're living in a time in an hour that
[1:08:18] when we look at this of how even his
[1:08:20] wife would say to him thus thou still
[1:08:23] retain thine Integrity curse God and die
[1:08:28] now think of it
[1:08:30] Jones got a strength here he's retaining
[1:08:32] he's holding but it isn't job's strength
[1:08:36] it's the strength of God that has a hold
[1:08:40] of his life
[1:08:42] are you with me that's the strength of
[1:08:45] God that has a hold upon his life
[1:08:47] because job would say it like this let
[1:08:49] me refer to this in Job chapter 6 verse
[1:08:52] 11 when the first one begins to speak to
[1:08:54] him I believe it's a file as a life as
[1:08:57] when he begins to speak to him and you
[1:08:59] know it starts to accuse job and
[1:09:00] everything else after seven days of
[1:09:02] looking at him and job was so bad they
[1:09:04] didn't even recognize they just sat
[1:09:05] there for seven days and didn't say
[1:09:07] nothing because they didn't even know
[1:09:08] what to say they looked at him they
[1:09:10] couldn't even recognize him to be job if
[1:09:12] job hadn't been sitting at job's address
[1:09:14] they'd have never recognized him
[1:09:18] that's what the Bible says they want to
[1:09:21] recognize me if they would have passed
[1:09:23] him out of Target they'd have walked on
[1:09:25] Vine
[1:09:27] but here's a man
[1:09:30] they have to testify to this you've been
[1:09:33] a one who's ministered strength to
[1:09:35] others
[1:09:38] yes that's powerful you know that don't
[1:09:40] you
[1:09:41] you wow what was that about Joe oh well
[1:09:44] Samuel job but just a good old boy nice
[1:09:46] deeper than a good old boy
[1:09:48] because sometimes a good old boy will
[1:09:49] only do good old things as long as their
[1:09:51] backs being scratched but if their back
[1:09:53] ain't being scratched it ain't a good
[1:09:55] old boy it's a sour old bat boy
[1:09:57] but Joe was more than a
[1:10:00] he had a strength of the sacrifice and
[1:10:03] you know what the meaning the sacrifice
[1:10:04] did it made him aware that there was one
[1:10:08] that was standing for him and it broke
[1:10:10] it pushed job to a place of service he
[1:10:14] ministered under the authority of that
[1:10:16] sacrifice when he spoke to others and
[1:10:19] maybe text Brother Carlos on the phone
[1:10:21] and said brother I'm praying for you
[1:10:23] keep pressing the battle Brother Ray I'm
[1:10:26] praying for you what was it he was
[1:10:28] ministering strength from the sacrifice
[1:10:31] that he was under
[1:10:33] oh you say brother Samuel my text don't
[1:10:35] mean anything why don't you tell that
[1:10:37] lion Devil he's a liar and get off my
[1:10:40] shoulder I'm a part of the body of Jesus
[1:10:42] Christ and if God inspires my heart to
[1:10:45] call a brother call a sister send him a
[1:10:48] text send them a card that I'm going to
[1:10:50] take that as the unction of the Holy
[1:10:52] Spirit and that's just as powerful
[1:10:54] that's walking on the water that's just
[1:10:56] as great as laying hands on the sick and
[1:10:59] they shall recover for those words are
[1:11:02] coming from the sacrifice and it calls
[1:11:04] us Devils to scatter
[1:11:07] I'm going
[1:11:10] there amen
[1:11:11] Glory Jehovah said concerning his own
[1:11:14] strength brother Brian he looked at
[1:11:16] himself and he turns around and asks
[1:11:18] them in job 6 11 what is my strength
[1:11:21] what is my strength that I should hope
[1:11:25] and what is my end that I should prolong
[1:11:27] my life
[1:11:28] remember job's in a place right now of
[1:11:31] he's not cursed God you can never make
[1:11:34] him do that you can't move him off his
[1:11:35] sacrifice amen but in the midst of this
[1:11:38] right here I won't look at it tonight
[1:11:39] but in the midst of it right here job is
[1:11:41] looking all around him oh Lord I wish
[1:11:43] the day had never been that they had
[1:11:45] said a man child was born
[1:11:47] now I won't ask you to raise your hands
[1:11:49] of things that you went through and
[1:11:50] whatever more but you wish Lord have
[1:11:52] mercy I wish I was already gone I wish I
[1:11:54] wasn't going through this come on now we
[1:11:56] all do that
[1:11:59] listen your strength is not your flesh
[1:12:01] even though job could say that he did
[1:12:05] not hinder or stop or annul the Covenant
[1:12:09] power of the faith of God in his life
[1:12:11] [Music]
[1:12:14] Hallelujah
[1:12:16] what is my strength verse 12 is my
[1:12:20] strength the strength of stones
[1:12:23] or is my flesh of brass
[1:12:27] now not only has he went through all
[1:12:28] this
[1:12:29] but then you've got somebody calling you
[1:12:31] up and saying yeah you know what sister
[1:12:33] Stephanie if you haven't done this and
[1:12:34] done this and done that and done that
[1:12:36] you're about ready to open the door and
[1:12:38] say get out of here
[1:12:39] because that's if that's encouragement
[1:12:41] don't need it
[1:12:43] right
[1:12:47] but here he is he's looking at his own
[1:12:49] life strength my strength is not the
[1:12:52] strength of stones
[1:12:54] I'm not my flesh it's not made of brass
[1:12:58] so this strength you see as job himself
[1:13:01] was standing there and think about this
[1:13:04] for just a moment when God was standing
[1:13:07] there and speaking to Satan and
[1:13:09] testifying of job he was not testifying
[1:13:12] when he said that job is a perfect man
[1:13:14] he's a man of integrity a man that is
[1:13:17] skeweth evil he was not speaking of the
[1:13:19] natural DNA of job
[1:13:23] because there is no flesh
[1:13:26] back in glory in the presence of God and
[1:13:30] let me just tell you something God
[1:13:31] wasn't up there bragging on job's flesh
[1:13:35] God don't brag on your flesh God don't
[1:13:38] grab on my flesh it's not the flesh that
[1:13:41] he's bragging on what God is seeing he's
[1:13:45] seeing the reflection of the Revelation
[1:13:47] in John's life you know what God is
[1:13:50] seeing he's seeing God he's seeing
[1:13:52] himself reflected by the sinless perfect
[1:13:56] one
[1:13:57] who do you think God sees in your life
[1:14:00] in my life not me
[1:14:02] he sees himself
[1:14:05] remember when Cain came with his works
[1:14:09] came with his good fruits God looked
[1:14:13] upon it and he saw Cain
[1:14:15] when Abel came with the lamb the
[1:14:18] Revelation cotton upon it and he saw
[1:14:21] himself
[1:14:22] he did not see Abel he saw himself
[1:14:28] glory be that thought if divine
[1:14:30] revelation moving in our lives can cause
[1:14:33] God to see himself or what it ought to
[1:14:36] do for our lives that we then can look
[1:14:39] and say I am a Son of God I am a
[1:14:42] daughter of God
[1:14:45] foreign
[1:14:49] so the strength of the Lord
[1:14:52] is not an Earthly means
[1:14:54] right
[1:14:56] you can try
[1:14:57] to satisfy with perfectly things
[1:15:00] but it's natural it's not the strength
[1:15:02] of the lord it's not from Earthly means
[1:15:04] it's supernatural it's steadfast in the
[1:15:07] midst of the trial and of the test of
[1:15:10] life
[1:15:11] let me say this to you everything going
[1:15:14] right in our life
[1:15:17] it's not what should be the measure
[1:15:20] whether we are Joy or Pleasant to be
[1:15:23] around
[1:15:25] let me repeat that again everything
[1:15:27] going around in our life our environment
[1:15:29] you know what's around us
[1:15:31] the cattle the this the that and sabians
[1:15:34] came this way child dance our joy what
[1:15:38] about the same if I could just get the
[1:15:39] cows all eaten if I could just get this
[1:15:41] if I could just you know what that is
[1:15:43] that's you
[1:15:44] that's you and God said there's some
[1:15:46] selfishness that's got to be reduced
[1:15:48] because I am not going to bow down
[1:15:50] before your wants amen
[1:15:52] oh that's good sometimes we have to look
[1:15:55] and we've got we feel like we get this
[1:15:56] we get that we get this bowl and this is
[1:15:58] all set up praise God I'll have joy
[1:16:00] that's not Joy that's worldly Joy
[1:16:04] because it's still under your
[1:16:06] orchestration well somebody help me
[1:16:07] preach
[1:16:08] amen you could say out show me don't
[1:16:10] worry we're all in this together
[1:16:12] John 16 33 Jesus said these things have
[1:16:16] I spoken unto you that in me
[1:16:20] you might have peace
[1:16:23] in the world
[1:16:25] you shall have tribulation but be a good
[1:16:28] cheer I have overcome the world
[1:16:32] now he didn't say be a good cheer for
[1:16:34] I'm going to take away all tribulation
[1:16:36] I'm going to take away all trials all
[1:16:38] tests
[1:16:41] right
[1:16:42] but he said in me where's my where's my
[1:16:44] peace going to be Lord in me
[1:16:47] it's going to be in me that's where
[1:16:49] you're going to find your pieces in me
[1:16:51] so finding our peace is finding the
[1:16:53] source of peace himself
[1:16:57] one who settles us the Tranquility the
[1:17:00] peace well in the world now in the world
[1:17:03] does he remove us from the world no we
[1:17:06] are in the world
[1:17:08] we're not of them
[1:17:10] we've been birthed from above we have
[1:17:12] received the experience the life the
[1:17:15] spirit of that other land and it is the
[1:17:17] other land that's reflected in us it's
[1:17:19] just like if you were to go to another
[1:17:20] country I really don't matter what you
[1:17:22] are what you look like you go to another
[1:17:24] country even though you might be of the
[1:17:26] same maybe nationality they'll tell
[1:17:27] whether you're Americanized or not
[1:17:29] they can tell they know by the way you
[1:17:32] conduct yourself or you carry yourself
[1:17:33] because what this is the land where you
[1:17:35] live
[1:17:36] is that right you you know what I'm
[1:17:38] talking about so notice God himself he
[1:17:41] wasn't that he's going to take us out
[1:17:43] from tribulations this is when David was
[1:17:47] right blessed is the man in whose
[1:17:49] strength whose strength is in the Lord
[1:17:51] for the ways of them are in his heart so
[1:17:54] David was not saying that God is going
[1:17:56] to take us out of the world but rather
[1:17:58] that God gives us strength in our
[1:18:01] pilgrimage because this is not my final
[1:18:05] resting place
[1:18:09] I've got an appointment
[1:18:13] Isaiah 33 5 the Lord is exalted now
[1:18:16] notice this the Lord is exalted for he
[1:18:19] dwelleth on high he hath filled Zion
[1:18:23] with judgment and righteousness so the
[1:18:27] Lord is exalted
[1:18:29] if we can ever say that in this time the
[1:18:33] message that God has sent to you and I
[1:18:35] in this hour has exalted the Lord
[1:18:39] sure above every disease above every
[1:18:43] condition the Lord has been exalted
[1:18:48] as what the mighty conqueror the
[1:18:51] Victorious Christ
[1:18:53] amen the Lord is exalted
[1:18:56] for he dwelleth on high and he hath
[1:19:00] filled Zion
[1:19:03] with what discernment
[1:19:06] and righteousness
[1:19:09] and wisdom and knowledge notice this
[1:19:12] verse wisdom and knowledge
[1:19:15] shall be
[1:19:17] the stability of thy times
[1:19:21] thy what times
[1:19:24] not just one trial
[1:19:27] times
[1:19:29] every season of your life
[1:19:32] the seasons will change
[1:19:34] from teenager
[1:19:36] 20 to 30 to 40
[1:19:38] 50 and 60 and
[1:19:40] we keep going now
[1:19:42] times will change right times change in
[1:19:46] our bodies right but no matter the times
[1:19:50] wisdom and knowledge shall be thy
[1:19:55] stability
[1:19:57] it's what will stabilize you and
[1:19:59] strength
[1:20:01] of Salvation which is Deliverance how
[1:20:05] many are thankful he's still a deliverer
[1:20:08] I'm still thankful he's saving aren't
[1:20:10] you
[1:20:10] oh yeah brother Sam I'm glad that God's
[1:20:13] saving Souls I'm glad about that too I'm
[1:20:15] real happy but I'm also glad that he's
[1:20:16] still my savior in the midst of a trial
[1:20:19] I'm glad he's my savior when I've been
[1:20:21] sick I'm grateful for saving strength of
[1:20:25] the Lord I'm glad that maybe when I've
[1:20:27] been perplexed or down I don't know what
[1:20:29] to do I'm glad he is the strength of my
[1:20:33] salvation
[1:20:35] he's my stability now notice when we see
[1:20:38] this brother random was saying like this
[1:20:40] and looking at the Unseen he said when a
[1:20:42] man wants catches that vision of the
[1:20:45] invisible God and knows that he's always
[1:20:49] present
[1:20:51] there's something that stabilizes that
[1:20:54] man's thinking you catch what he said
[1:20:55] when he catches that Vision that's great
[1:20:58] vision of the invisible God and knows
[1:21:01] that he's always present
[1:21:06] there's something that stabilizes that
[1:21:10] man's thinking
[1:21:12] I hope you catch this
[1:21:14] it isn't that that man's thinking is
[1:21:17] always perfect but he's got something
[1:21:19] that'll stabilize him
[1:21:22] when thoughts come
[1:21:24] he's got something that'll anchor him
[1:21:27] because thoughts can come but there's
[1:21:30] something that stabilizes him
[1:21:33] what is that something
[1:21:35] is here
[1:21:36] he's with me he said he never leave me
[1:21:39] nor forsake me
[1:21:42] Lord be to God it stabilizes his actions
[1:21:47] in the time of distress and trouble
[1:21:52] it'll still make him look upward and
[1:21:57] above the things that are happening
[1:21:59] around him because he's looking at the
[1:22:03] Unseen
[1:22:04] yet by promise
[1:22:06] see see the power of the promise made
[1:22:09] real to you
[1:22:11] even in this hour the promise of the
[1:22:14] Rapture we're not called to a hope we're
[1:22:17] called to a certainty in this hour and
[1:22:19] man can't bring that certainty no but
[1:22:22] God's the one who brings that certainty
[1:22:23] it's God that though your mind can
[1:22:26] Wonder here that it's God that takes the
[1:22:28] experience in your life and helps you to
[1:22:31] see your experience is found in the word
[1:22:34] of God not upon sensation not upon
[1:22:37] anything else but upon the word of God
[1:22:40] we believe in Sensations we believe in
[1:22:44] all that but our experience is rooted in
[1:22:47] the word of God that whether I feel it
[1:22:50] or not I am saying
[1:22:57] Hallelujah
[1:22:59] brother said when I was a younger
[1:23:00] Christian he said Satan used to beat me
[1:23:03] around the skunk
[1:23:06] he said until I finally recognize I can
[1:23:09] point him right back to the word that I
[1:23:11] have met God's requirements and that's
[1:23:13] where I stand
[1:23:16] you can stand right there that Vision
[1:23:19] that'll stabilize you
[1:23:22] in the midst of times and troubles
[1:23:24] you've got a strength to draw from
[1:23:28] Hallelujah
[1:23:32] let me try to bring this down here
[1:23:35] there's a lot of troubles brother random
[1:23:36] will talk about there's times he said
[1:23:38] we're in a time of trouble right now
[1:23:40] where he said you can't stop the
[1:23:42] churches from going into that Council of
[1:23:44] church you just can't do it he said no
[1:23:45] you talked to him he said
[1:23:47] they don't want nothing to do with it
[1:23:49] right it's a spirit good people are you
[1:23:52] with me brother I'm sending the message
[1:23:53] Shalom he said what it is it's gross
[1:23:56] Darkness upon him he said it's people
[1:23:57] they want to do right but there's a
[1:23:59] spirit upon them that won't let them do
[1:24:00] right
[1:24:01] yeah is that right he said women want to
[1:24:03] be women but there's a spirit upon them
[1:24:05] that won't let them be that way man and
[1:24:07] so forth another man goes on to all that
[1:24:08] it's a spirit we're dealing with
[1:24:11] right so what are you saying by the same
[1:24:13] I'm telling you psychology is not
[1:24:15] powerful enough to stand before a demon
[1:24:20] but there is one
[1:24:22] who is greater than every demon every
[1:24:26] Power
[1:24:27] could not imagine something it is Jesus
[1:24:31] the mighty conqueror
[1:24:35] oh my brother Graham said you go to the
[1:24:38] doctor and he'll say well I'm sorry to
[1:24:41] tell you you have cancer well quickly
[1:24:43] that's all he's dead that's just all
[1:24:46] there is to it or they'll be gone the
[1:24:49] doctor says well that's parallelism
[1:24:51] that's leukemia
[1:24:53] they're as good as dead right then fear
[1:24:56] sets in see
[1:24:57] but it shouldn't
[1:25:02] who is this now watch how let's address
[1:25:04] this fear one child brother random said
[1:25:07] fear sets in but it shouldn't now what's
[1:25:09] he going to do he's going to direct our
[1:25:12] minds our hearts to who is present to
[1:25:16] dismiss fear because if all you look at
[1:25:20] is a doctor's report
[1:25:22] if all you feed on is newscast
[1:25:25] right all you feed on this step of the
[1:25:28] world
[1:25:29] then I'm going to tell you it's gonna be
[1:25:31] fear banging you up
[1:25:34] but notice he said it shouldn't now I
[1:25:37] love this because you see this is the
[1:25:38] characteristic of God when there's
[1:25:40] things that God deals with my heart on
[1:25:42] here's what I look for it's because God
[1:25:44] just does not come around and say you're
[1:25:46] wrong but God always points us and lets
[1:25:50] us know there's a way out
[1:25:53] I'm just telling you when God deals with
[1:25:55] my heart in a message I look for that
[1:25:57] because that's his characteristic
[1:25:59] because he is the Waymaker
[1:26:02] he just don't come down and condemn us
[1:26:05] and say that's it he's a way Baker and
[1:26:08] real genuine correction will always
[1:26:10] point us back to the cross
[1:26:13] [Applause]
[1:26:17] I'm just telling you that's that's right
[1:26:19] because you say how I'm looking at the
[1:26:21] characteristic of God
[1:26:23] and I expect that
[1:26:25] no watch how brother M turns this fear
[1:26:27] sets in see but it shouldn't now watch
[1:26:29] what he says who is this made the
[1:26:31] promise
[1:26:32] who made the problem so he's asking
[1:26:34] questions you know why if he just said
[1:26:36] it our mind would wonder but my question
[1:26:38] is who made the promise so let's just
[1:26:40] answer this who made the promise
[1:26:46] well am I by myself tonight
[1:26:49] who made the promise for healing
[1:26:52] the Lord did right okay who is this that
[1:26:54] made the promise the Lord what are we
[1:26:57] living for
[1:26:58] we're living for him why are we the
[1:27:01] Church of the Living God
[1:27:04] because he purchased we were for
[1:27:06] ordained right
[1:27:07] we were purchased for we were purchased
[1:27:09] we were bought why are we filled with
[1:27:12] the Holy Ghost oh my why are we filled
[1:27:15] with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:17] to remember
[1:27:19] in the time of trouble he is still here
[1:27:26] [Music]
[1:27:27] why in the midst of it all he's still
[1:27:30] here who made the promise not man
[1:27:35] who heals her body not man God does
[1:27:39] he's our healer he's our deliverer why
[1:27:42] are we the Church of the Living God
[1:27:43] because he hath made us
[1:27:46] why are we filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:48] because of his grace that we might
[1:27:52] remember
[1:27:55] in the time of travel he is still here
[1:28:00] he
[1:28:01] stabilizes things he is the same
[1:28:04] yesterday today and forever he is with
[1:28:07] us just the same he might be resting a
[1:28:11] few moments between the meetings but
[1:28:12] he's still here just the same amen
[1:28:16] wow when trouble sets in and Faith of
[1:28:19] him being with us
[1:28:21] but then fear sets in and when fear sets
[1:28:24] in then we really got trouble
[1:28:27] so when faith comes a knocking
[1:28:29] this is what the holy spirit is given
[1:28:32] for
[1:28:33] who made the promise
[1:28:36] why am I
[1:28:38] his child
[1:28:40] who is he
[1:28:41] what has he done for me who is this
[1:28:45] we're not talking about a Doctrine now
[1:28:47] we're talking about him
[1:28:50] he's the one who stabilizes us
[1:28:53] amen David could write it like this now
[1:28:55] here's what it means to be stabilized
[1:28:57] let me just let me tie this up here it
[1:29:00] means to be made or become unlikely to
[1:29:04] give away
[1:29:05] or overturn
[1:29:07] it makes us unlikely to give way
[1:29:10] what does
[1:29:12] he does
[1:29:14] brother Adam how you hold your religion
[1:29:16] now
[1:29:18] he's holding me
[1:29:22] true
[1:29:24] the word also means to make or become
[1:29:26] unlikely to change fail or decline
[1:29:30] do you realize that the spirit of God in
[1:29:33] your life and in my life
[1:29:35] you cannot fail
[1:29:39] you cannot feel
[1:29:42] because for you to fail would mean God
[1:29:44] fails
[1:29:46] are you hearing me
[1:29:48] God cannot fail God's not a man that he
[1:29:51] should lie not the son of man that he
[1:29:53] should repent
[1:29:55] he don't got to take back any word
[1:29:58] and so what the holy spirit is it's
[1:30:00] God's word coming to unite with that
[1:30:04] desire he placed within you
[1:30:07] and that is his word made manifest
[1:30:12] I don't care what you feel like I don't
[1:30:14] care what you think about yourself the
[1:30:17] word cannot be defeated
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:22] it would be easier to stop the Sun
[1:30:30] it would be easier to do anything else
[1:30:33] but this word cannot be stopped
[1:30:36] [Applause]
[1:30:37] the power of the Holy Ghost working in a
[1:30:41] redeemed child of God
[1:30:43] you can't quit because you didn't start
[1:30:46] this work
[1:30:51] you might be in a place right now you've
[1:30:53] been in for a while but that's not your
[1:30:55] destiny
[1:30:58] sin was never your destiny this first
[1:31:01] birth was not your destiny your destiny
[1:31:05] was to be a sound and daughter of God
[1:31:11] what came along your way what came my
[1:31:14] way the mercy of God and release
[1:31:18] strength
[1:31:19] to you and I
[1:31:24] that's why we can say the Lord is the
[1:31:27] strength
[1:31:28] of my life

[1:32:33] king

[1:33:20] don't seem like I can break beyond that
[1:33:22] but he is my saving strength all I've
[1:33:24] got to do is cry out to him I may not be

[1:37:34] Spirit has done it raises this from just
[1:37:36] being a good devotional book it raises
[1:37:39] this from just being a memorization of
[1:37:42] chapters and scriptures and oh I know
[1:37:44] that chapter oh I know that story it

[1:51:27] Hallelujah
[1:51:29] looking Beyond
[1:51:32] the trial
[1:51:36] you don't remove it
[1:51:38] but like the song has said which
[1:51:40] completely with the scriptures
[1:51:42] drawing strength
[1:51:45] from him
[1:51:47] I know where I'm going
[1:51:50] and I just feel in my heart if you don't
[1:51:52] have that settled tonight
[1:51:54] let's get that settled
[1:51:56] because you're never going to be able to
[1:51:57] draw strength from El Shady eye
[1:52:01] you don't come the right way
[1:52:03] the Bible said blessed is the man whom
[1:52:06] thou calls it to approach
[1:52:09] unto that course
[1:52:11] it wasn't us it's not you it's God's
[1:52:15] drawing
[1:52:17] brother Brown said it like this he said
[1:52:18] God was telling Abraham Abraham as El
[1:52:22] Shadi I am dwelling behind the blood
[1:52:27] if you will come
[1:52:29] you can partake of my strength
[1:52:32] and draw strength from me
[1:52:35] I'll tell you tonight there's nothing
[1:52:37] nothing
[1:52:39] stand in the way
[1:52:42] unless you allow it to stand
[1:52:44] there's nothing that can hinder you from
[1:52:46] being a partaker of it unless you allow
[1:52:49] it
[1:52:49] but I would say tonight why here in his
[1:52:52] presence that here tonight
[1:52:54] it's a time to wear it so you've got a
[1:52:56] place to look not just at the trial not
[1:52:59] just the tests and not just the things
[1:53:01] that's going on around you
[1:53:03] because this world there's there's
[1:53:04] heartaches and things all around but
[1:53:06] there's a place where you can draw
[1:53:07] strength
[1:53:08] that's from El shadyheim yeah that's
[1:53:11] from almighty God one that'll stabilize
[1:53:13] you in the midst of your journey and
[1:53:16] tonight even if you've got to wear the
[1:53:19] circumstances all around you you feel
[1:53:21] like when you can look back and say my
[1:53:23] Lord that's all I'm talking about
[1:53:26] I'm talking about nothing but a bunch of
[1:53:28] circumstances that I'm seeing
[1:53:30] no strength there but tonight if you can
[1:53:33] just say Lord all right I'll lift my
[1:53:35] eyes unto the hills from what's cometh
[1:53:38] my health my health coming from the Lord
[1:53:41] he's the one that stabilize us he's the
[1:53:43] one to give us strength in the midst of
[1:53:46] what has taken place around us
[1:53:48] because if all we look at is what's
[1:53:50] around us and talk about it our
[1:53:52] confession becomes so negative right and
[1:53:55] God don't dwell in nothing negative
[1:53:57] God don't dwell in negative well someday
[1:54:00] I'll be a good Christian he ain't the
[1:54:02] high priest of that because that's not
[1:54:03] what he did to work for he didn't work
[1:54:05] the dead to do it so that someday you'd
[1:54:07] be a good one he already did the work
[1:54:09] and he can only intercede on what he has
[1:54:12] already done that you confess he is to
[1:54:14] you he is my deliverer he is my savior
[1:54:18] he is my healer he is my redeemer then
[1:54:22] he can go to work upon that confession
[1:54:27] it stabilizes us it gives us a sight
[1:54:30] above this right here
[1:54:34] of what is here
[1:54:36] and he's the one
[1:54:38] that as I pass through this
[1:54:41] it gives me strength
[1:54:44] because I know I'm going somewhere
[1:54:46] see what it comes down to do you have
[1:54:49] that assurance
[1:54:50] that I know that I know that I know
[1:54:53] in whom I have believed
[1:54:57] oh brother Samuel I I believe on the
[1:55:00] Lord Jesus but do you know him
[1:55:03] do you know him more than just his word
[1:55:05] come on do you know him in a personal
[1:55:07] relationship where he is the rock of
[1:55:11] your life
[1:55:12] do you know him in that way that you can
[1:55:15] say if this very moment I know where I'm
[1:55:19] going
[1:55:20] I know in whom I have believed and I
[1:55:22] have this
[1:55:24] peace like a river
[1:55:27] that it Is Well with My Soul
[1:55:31] then in the midst of that like the man
[1:55:34] standing on the bow of the ship who
[1:55:36] wrote that song by divine inspiration he
[1:55:38] had a daughter that he went on to Glory
[1:55:40] right
[1:55:42] and here he was and they announced to
[1:55:43] him and said in so many moments
[1:55:47] this ship is going to be sinking here's
[1:55:51] the possibility
[1:55:52] he began to worship
[1:55:54] they said what are you doing
[1:55:57] why are you singing like that he said
[1:56:00] because I've got a Godly Glory
[1:56:03] and I've got one in New York one way or
[1:56:06] another I'm gonna see one
[1:56:09] maybe the next few minutes it might be
[1:56:12] the one in glory or the next few minutes
[1:56:14] it might be the one in New York but
[1:56:16] either way I've got an appointment I've
[1:56:19] got a destiny
[1:56:20] [Music]
[1:56:21] what was he drawing strength from
[1:56:24] from what the sacrifice had made
[1:56:27] available to him
[1:56:32] oh friends
[1:56:34] this is not our destiny thank you Jesus
[1:56:37] Jesus this is not our destiny
[1:56:39] this realm that you and I look at this
[1:56:41] realm there's a realm that's more real
[1:56:43] than this realm
[1:56:44] there's a realm that's greater than this
[1:56:46] realm that we see and we experience the
[1:56:49] pressures and the twills of life but
[1:56:51] there's a realm that's greater
[1:56:53] there's a realm where we receive
[1:56:56] strength from down into this realm
[1:56:59] like brother random called it in that
[1:57:01] quote I read to how to look into the
[1:57:02] Unseen he said there's a something
[1:57:05] that gives us strength I like how he
[1:57:07] said it that way there's a something you
[1:57:10] know what that means it's something
[1:57:11] that's unexplainable
[1:57:13] you can't explain how the strength of
[1:57:15] the Lord comes
[1:57:17] you can't explain it it's happened to me
[1:57:19] many times I yet I can't explain it
[1:57:22] there's been times I wake right up out
[1:57:24] of asleep and I know
[1:57:26] God has strengthened me
[1:57:29] not just in my natural body but he's
[1:57:31] strengthened me
[1:57:33] in my life
[1:57:35] yeah
[1:57:37] how many witnesses I got here amen
[1:57:39] strengthened strengthened you can't
[1:57:42] explain it but that's his saving
[1:57:44] strength
