he knows what we have need of and that's something that we we don't know by what we've read we know it by experience that over and over not only has god fulfilled to every believer what we have longed for the thirst that was in our life that we tried to satisfy with a lot of other things of this life sometimes even trying to satisfy with trying to be a better person but it didn't satisfy it we could be even a better morally person but it didn't satisfy it it's because there's only one that can satisfy it it's not something we can do but it's the one that we can yield ourselves to and then he comes in and he he quenches satisfies that thirst the satisfying of it it doesn't mean that we're never thirsty again it's just our thirst has been satisfied that we no longer are searching we have found the fountain of life we have found him that is the desire of all of our life so there is a thirst within our hearts we want more of him amen it's him that we love amen so glad to be in the house of the lord tonight good to be gathered with each of you those of you on the internet those of you that are here and no matter that where we are if we have have with that one purpose to know that god is mindful of our need he's not restricted by barriers he's not contained within a building of walls but god is mindful and he's right there to minister to every single need amen so we just want to look to the lord tonight and ask that god will just have his way in this service in a very special way let's just look to the lord in a word of prayer if you've got a need on your heart just make it known to the lord heavenly father you're the same god today that you ever was you're the same one lord that comes when situations lord require more than what man can do lord you're the same god the same one who opened the red sea the same one lord who parted the jordan the same one who brought down the walls of jericho the same one who met the hebrew children in that furnace of fire you're the same god who was there with daniel that night lord and you stood with him and they ain't those lions would not come near the angel of the lord you were his protection lord you're the same god tonight for every single request that's upon the hearts of your children lord no matter what the need might be we just lord want to unite our hearts together to believe that god that what request and petition that we have that as we approach the throne of grace you said ask the father anything in my name and i will do it lord i pray that you would minister to every soul every spirit every man lord god minister to our lives lord tonight in a very personal way may you help us to step out of the way and may o god you just come and visit your people those that are gathered here lord those that are gathered lord there at home lord and streaming we just pray god that you will just move among us in a special way lord heal those that are sick in their body lord any that would be afflicted lord or even troubled in their mind lord or in their spirit if there be any lord in their soul god that has not received that inoculation that healing that sin cure lord may tonight be the night lord that they would just lay their life down lord and lord god just invite you to come lord may their heart be desperate before you i pray lord we just ask these things lord all for the glory of god in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen god bless the musicians thankful for for that tonight and we want to look right in the word if you'd like to stand with me let's go to ephesians chapter four and i just want to just for the sake of time just to move right in here tonight from where we were drawing from last week and just seeing the the body of jesus christ and just looking upon this here in the scripture i want to begin reading in verse 4 of ephesians 4 here tonight and the scripture says there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in the hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascendeth up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth would be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lay and lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen may god richly bless the word and bless you as you're being seated tonight just as i mentioned to you last week on last thursday these are things that uh you know sometimes where i'm looking at it as a pastor and i look across and there's sometimes you can see certain things that are our needs and as you're looking at it you can see there's times where there's a need to bring certain teaching and approach certain things and yet within that it's things that you always you have to wait on god and to know when would be the right time what's the right approach how do we move within this we are looking at at things that are within the word as we we're just looking at the thought and how god began to direct us here off of that and through that in the book of philippians and seeing how paul was admonishing the people of god those churches that were within philippi and remember the very first birth the very first verse he admonished uh those the bishops and deacons and it was plural because there are there was many churches in that region of philippi let alone many churches as it would be written the churches that are in asia there were many local churches but we understand that the lord jesus when he made a declaration the very first mention would be where he would declare that his church the one that he would claim for his very own it would be that of his church that would be built upon this rock which the rock is a revelation and that revelation is of who he is and to to recognize that with within this that that would be the foundation of the true church of the living god and when we when we read here within the scriptures there are many things that we can we can see and look at and many things that uh here within the scriptures you know i just say it like this a lot of it when i i look at it i sometimes we we hear the different thoughts of of apostles prophets teachers um evangelists and pastors and for for maybe for some it just all looks at it that well they're all just that's just all all preachers but every gift itself is uniquely placed by god it's to accomplish a purpose that he has in mind and so sometimes we find i find this that where many things are not understood there's things that's in that are not understood what apostle is what a prophet is um what what a pastor is uh what a what a an evangelist is what a teacher is and because of that misunderstanding sometimes this is where uh people can uh they they look at things and just think well just assume well it's just a preacher but yet in the midst of it god has so gifted a life that he he achieves a purpose through that life for his body it's not about the man the gift that was placed in the man it's not about the man any true gift that god has given it is never to highlight any man nor draw anybody to one's person and i'm talking about even in the nine spiritual gifts as well there is nothing that god has placed in the body that should elevate any man any flesh but every gift and i say it like this even that of a gift that would be to play music even a gift that is given to sing specials even a gift that is in all those parts it is to um it is to exalt the lord jesus christ let me just say it to you like this when all of those things as it says that all things ought to be done unto the edification of the body the edifying of the body is not building people up but it is exalting the lord jesus christ that revelation because it is him that settles the hearts of his children it's him that comes that causes any doubts to vanish it's him that coming on the scene that that actually is exalted it's him being ministered that brings healing it's him being exalted that that brings life to situations it's him being exalted that gives direction when we are between two opinions it's him that that we that needs to be exalted in our midst so i want to take here tonight and just begin to look at this as we started to look at that part that it is christ that assembled the body the body of jesus christ as as a whole from around the world just like you would see as a congregation many different ones that would come and stand here from other assemblies in the united states or from even from around the world different uh brethren that we have that come here from africa and some of the central american countries and other places they are all part as we are of the body of jesus christ and remember we we don't get into that body by membership we come into that body by spiritual birth it is christ himself that inducts us into his own body and his body is that which takes upon that of the feminine form a reflection of him of the man christ jesus so his church is him being reflected through his body it's that which is set for his glory so i want to just begin to take a little thought or to look at this tonight as we begin breaking that down and moving it down even till we come to every little part within a local body but i want to look at this on the gifts of the mighty conqueror because these gifts that we have just read about when we read this here in ephesians 4 there this speaks that these gifts that have been set forth there's because there's a work to be done there's a work to be done there's a purpose to be served and we read through some of them scriptures let me just put it how the prophet put it he said it was a man-sized job it was a god-sized job it was that which only god himself could fulfill there was not a man upon the earth that could redeem you and i but yet remember how the fall came by man then god himself took upon the form of man in order to manifest the attribute of savior and redeem you and i in other words he became kinsmen he became kin folks with us is that right he did that that he might pay the price and then send back his own life into the church of the living god so it would not be man carrying the message but it would be the same god who brought the message of redemption through the prophets announcing it foretelling it and then fulfilling it in christ is the same one that now moves through sons and daughters that have been born of that same spirit that their lives cry out that redemption has come their lives our witnesses are our testimonies within themselves that indeed redemption has come in other words we have been made co-partners in redemption with him because god as the prophet would tell us he does not do anything outside of man he always works through a man he had to use a man a man is what he had to use to display his attribute of savior think of it it was man who fell in the beginning but now god here he comes and he makes and prepares for himself a body that then through him by that he might project that attribute of savior and pay the price for you and i and this is why brother brown would say it like this he says he turns right back around and makes the man a partner to him and does nothing except he does it through a man i want you to think of this right here there's things just like when a fire gets started you don't start a fire with a big old chunk of log but there is something that you use that gets a fire started but once that fire is started then you start putting chunks of wood on there and let me just put it very clearly the fire that fell on the day of pentecost is that same original fire down through the ages man would get cooled off but god always had a way that that original fire would come back and then in every age there would be ministry that would be born of that same original fire carrying that same original message and not just ministry but sons and daughters of god that were also co-workers and would carry that same message that has been brought from the beginning so it is the whole work of redemption how god condescending now look at this in the scripture hear the lord jesus these are some of the parting instructions the commissioning of his church before he is he is ascended up remember after he raised from the grave and he revealed himself and he came among his brethren remember the bible says in acts 1 he was with them for a period of 40 days instructing to them that there was that instruction of that which pertained to the kingdom among that was that they must needs receive the holy ghost is that right and there was also direction that was given so that they might know that life was coming to put them into action just like it did isaiah when isaiah came into the temple and after god had separated him from the influence of man then he saw god in a way he never saw god before but why was that because god had a work for isaiah to do so god made himself known to isaiah that's the same way he does for each and every one of his children god did not give you and i the holy ghost nor does he call you to receive the holy ghost so that you and i would just sit around there is a work to be done but you and i can't do that work we cannot fulfill the work it has to be christ in us fulfilling his own work oh glory so notice the commission very familiar words here but we want to read them in mark 16 verse 14 after he appeared unto the eleven as they set at me and abraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not him which had seen which had seen him after he was risen he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover these are all accompanying signs of a living christ these signs accompany the gifts from the mighty conqueror these signs accompany the life of every believer it don't matter how old or how young now let me just say it to you like this remember we are a part of the body of jesus christ and not trying to get ahead of myself but so that you would understand in myself i don't have the gift to see visions i'm not a prophet but that gift is in the body are you with me that gift is in the body i i may not be an evangelist but that gift is in the body so i can say that i am where that gift is at it's not outside of the body so we want to just put it rest don't allow the enemy to trouble you and say well i haven't done this i haven't done that remember the foundation we are standing on of the baptism of the holy ghost is that your life has been changed by the revelation of jesus christ and you are abiding in the body of jesus christ you just want to be available if he wants to use you because let me just tell you something he does use you are you with me there's nobody a wallflower now let's look at this here in verse 19 so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god there was a rightful place here is a positioning of power now verse 20 and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen so between that verse 19 and verse 20 we know there was a trick to the upper room the lord accompanying them was he who said i not only will be with you i will be in you o glory no wonder he could tell joshua do not fear do not fear for there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life fear not for i am with thee withersoever thou go that was a type of the antitype which is the holy ghost that would dwell in the life of the believer even when you don't feel it he's still there amen he's there he's been there the seal of the living god has come upon your life notice the lord was working with them and confirming the word with signs following who is it that performs the miracles he does he's the one that performs the miracles he's the one that that baptizes into the body he's the one that deals with the heart he's the one that'll inspire this area such as where paul could say when they were all divided in thought and paul could say hold on a moment we're all working under the same administration he said i have planted a policy of water but god gave the increase paul was letting him know this is not a divided body see the inspiration of the revelation of jesus christ does not promote division the revelation of jesus christ calls into unity of the revelation of jesus christ which never highlights a man it highlights jesus christ that's what gifts of the mighty conqueror do they reflect his victory in earth luke 24 46 and he said unto them these are also out of the gospel of luke parting words thus it is written and thus it behooves christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem remission that means where there's a complete release a person carrying the load and the burden of sin that they're under remission of sins is to recognize that through the preaching of the gospel it brings them to an awareness there has been one that has been accepted on your behalf by the sound of the gospel it overrides you don't know what i did you don't know how bad this was you don't know how much i've fallen short you don't know how much the gospel overrides all of that and the gospel calls you to a finished work that's already been done through the lord jesus christ and it lets you know this is why i went i went to calvary for you i came down from you i rose from the grave for you and i sent a message for you that's what the real work of calvary does those gifts from the mighty conqueror reflect that oh glory beginning at jerusalem god honoring his word and ye are witnesses of these things and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high let me just say it like this the church was started or inaugurated on the day of pentecost wherein that the church of the living god what would separate and declare it to be his church is because he would be reflected by his life being present in it he would be the one leading them like he led the children of israel in the pillar of cloud and in that of the pillar of fire the light by day and the pillar of cloud by now hit that same god now leading the church of the living god not outside of man but inside a man that same god inside of the body that he has redeemed he's leading his church oh glory it's his work that he is carrying on all glory then to recognize that then even as we uh would read here in ephesians 4 there was what we read of was that that was depicted when a one would conquer another country another territory when they would come back in from conquering that territory they would have um those treasures and that which had been taken and conquered and as they would ride through on a victorious procession they would actually begin there were gifts that were being given out and they were being given up you know what that was it was a reflection of the victory that the one had already won and they were partakers of it let me just say it to you like this god has seen to it brother that this is not like a parade route where they threw candy and there ends up being a piece of candy laying by the gutter i'm telling you when god subdivided himself by the baptism of the holy ghost god knew exactly where you would be and god dispersing that and releasing that the gift of christ he's releasing his life it's no accident that the word came across your pathway it's no accident that you heard and recognize that this is the truth of the living god it's no accident that your life has been changed it is an actual happening of the victory of calvary and the resurrection of the lord jesus christ that he has dispersed that same gift right here in this end time the same original life that manifests his victory brother your life is a reflection of the mighty conquerors oh glory i want you to think of this here in isaiah 52 7 how beautiful this is where paul would pick it from how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto zion that god reigned now remember jesus said i didn't come to bring peace i come to bring a sword what do you say what is he saying i didn't come to make a pact with the devil jesus come see the publishing of peace is to let one know that what the requirement between god and man has been met in the man christ jesus and the same one that fulfilled it in that body of flesh comes present in that word as it's being preached and brings conviction to that heart and draws it to a reality it's beyond anything that a man or woman can ever explain it's god taking hold upon his children publishing peace to where they don't have to be at war anymore with god because that first nature is enmity i don't care how good you try to dress up that first man it's enmity against god it is a product that came between satan and eve are you with me the whole glory be to god publishes salvation this publishing means not printing it that's not what this publishing means it ain't printing press is printing out salvation this publishing means preaching it that saith unto zion thy god reigneth oh glory be to god this is why jesus would say in acts 1 verse 8 just a further rehearsing of luke 24 what he said there but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and he goes through each of those parts so witnesses are lives that are expressions of that resurrected life of the lord jesus christ hallelujah a life that reflects him and his purpose he said the works that i do shall you do also because i live you shall live also so god trained men with a living experience witnesses now let me bring it on down witnesses men and women sons and daughters that have been fully baptized into the body of jesus christ that walk by the power of the resurrection in their life not the old man made over but a new man in christ jesus where all things are passed away and behold all things have become new that's how the bride is to bear the reflection of the bridegroom so is the life of every believer to bear the reflection of the mate christ jesus his life becoming preeminently reflected in and through that life as paul could say the life that i now live in the flesh he lived when a different kind of life before the life i now live in the flesh i live by the faith by the faith of the son of god who left me and gave himself for me notice the life i used to live but now what's happened now i'm not living that life how are you living by that personal reality he loved me he gave himself for me he became my sin offering that i might receive that life that is within that offering which is his own life these are gifts from the mighty conqueror a gift that does not reflect him as a mighty conqueror is not that which god is backing up come on now it must reflect him to be the same yesterday today and forever many gifts but god alliance gifts that are ordained for his elect are you with me hallelujah he ordains that no man as the scripture said can call jesus the christ but by the holy ghost nobody can call nobody can call him lord unless he's become the lord of your life by the holy ghost so it's a reflection of victory in the lives of the believers a living testimony a living oracle a written epistle that had been personally wrote by the overcoming power of the mighty conqueror hey listen when one conquers another nation what do they do they start to try to change that nation and little things they pick up and little things they do but that kind of conquering has never lasted it'll never work you can take a person and try to change them to the do's and don'ts and we do this and we believe that that kind of conquering don't last all that produces is hatred slavish fear it produces something that god's pleased with me if i do this or if i do that but brother if they can ever be brought into the contact of their maker of the one who has done the redemptive work so much that the holy ghost can begin to cause faith to rise to not try to perform something in themselves but to believe it and have faith and lay down the life and say i receive what you've done for me it's got to be received oh it comes to an overcoming life being reflected through overcomers by his spirit now i want you to look at this scripture here in psalm 68 18. david under inspiration would write remember in the psalms there's many messianic psalms and it goes through each of the part in the life of christ here in psalm 68 verse 18 it is speaking of the resurrection of christ i want you to notice the words thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive thou hast received gifts for men now there had to be a price that was paid right there had to be a price that was paid then here as he deposits unloads the sin being our sin barrier our scapegoat he unloads it there and then then what does he do he goes to paradise he man he ministers there at paradise by the expression of his life i am the one that they in type by revelation were looking to i have come the fulfillment of what they have waited on and paradise was emptied out and he led captivity captive he ascended he ascended now remember the resurrection here he comes walking upon the earth with his disciples with for 40 days he is with them instructing them in things concerning the kingdom of god he lets him know you must receive the holy ghost he commands them to do that he has right then gifts that he has received he has received these gifts already notice what the gifts were for he has received these gifts from men yay for the rebellious also that the lord god might dwell among them aren't you glad this is what the gifts are for is so that christ might dwell among us it's to reflect him he's the one that's reflected in the body that god that the lord god might dwell among them now let's pick up from our texts that same scripture now paul by the spirit of god notice wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gay gifts not received them gave them there was a receiving of the gifts but now when he ascended on high now there's the dispersal of those gifts brother there was a change from receiving them to dispersing them amen in the ascension of christ into the meditorial seed to take the place there as the true atonement there as one that is manifested in power and in glory and a triumph over every sin over every devil over every demon over every unclean thing brother he ascended on high and is set down at the right hand of authority and power and he sends back ministering gifts brother gifts from a mighty conqueror to announce the rights that belong to you as as believers there are redemptive rights you've got a right to claim it hallelujah he gave gifts unto men now he that ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth see how paul picking it up he that descendeth is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead who's the head he is he's the head of the body that in all things he might have the preeminence this is the goal this was the achievement this is what was lost in eden was preeminence his life now through calvary and the sending back of that life he is to gain preeminence this is an hour that we're living in of preeminence this is an hour where the bride has been built up to a place where the head has come to the body man by the token life of the holy ghost it comes down where the head has united with the body now the scripture says in revelation or romans 11 29 for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance this is why let me just put it in a simple term so everyone can understand it this is why that everyone that has had a gift in their life that god has given music gift gift to write songs even a gift to preach a gift to teach they'll give an account if it's not been used for god think of the things where many of them and the beatles wrote thousands of songs they didn't even record it their names are tied to that because as far as i know there never was any repentance give an account that's why everest presley will give an account the man was a gifted man are you with me gifted man now when you look at it remember just being a preacher even though it can be a gift a man can be a gift to go get things started or a gift to do this or even one of the nine spiritual gifts none of those things are signs that a person is truly born again because the spirit of god can move upon them to use that gift in their life and they can yield to the spirit of god for the purpose of using that gift but yet themselves never be a surrendered vessel to god a surrendered vessel is a life that has truly been born again by the spirit of god where that person man or woman is not resting on the gift in their life that gift is not their absolute that gift is not their token come on now that gift is not their evidence that their spirit born but the gift of the holy ghost it will identify a life that every part of that life will punctuate the word with a man that's what the spirit of truth is amen he'll lead and guide us into all truth gifts and callings are without repentance personally myself if all i can do is clap my hands i want to clap them for jesus i want to clap him because what he has done in my life he is worthy of all the praise if i can sing i want to sing for him i want to declare his redemption i want to declare who he is to me amen and if i preach i want to preach that living reality of who i know him to be with the desire of seeing others come to know him in that way you see it isn't reflecting to a church he's not reflecting to get somebody to a set of beliefs it's getting the people to the new birth the revelation of jesus christ it's getting them to where they meet jesus christ personally let's just be honest friends we've dealt many times i've dealt too many times run up headlong with people who know the beliefs of the message but they don't have a submissive heart that can be lead [Music] ran into that too many times a sheep is willing to be led come on now sheep is not their own shepherd we have the chief shepherd are you with me now gifts and callings of god are without repentance now this is where brother branham would bring it down like this he said gifts and callings are without repentance that's how the message gives it's something that god by sovereign grace put into the church god does that himself it's a work and an act of god and by foreknowledge he predestinate these things to happen he goes on he says gifts and callings are without repentance god all through the ages has been represented on earth through his prophets through his kings and it's always been the spirit of god see he is represented through so let me just say it in the words that the prophet spoke it in he said if a healing campaign comes along and it reflects off into a denomination god never sent it where you say what do you mean reflecting where is it pointing the people too you see it takes us back to see where is the aim where is the direction you see when we can really get to look in the name and direction it helps us to see and have grace for one another because sometimes we might hit the wrong target but we've got the right aim the right desire the right motive the right objective we're trying to achieve the right thing that's why we need the discernment of the holy spirit are you with me so when we look at this it it is that reflection that it must be a reflection on to that of jesus christ because after our after all we are as stars of god we are to reflect his glorious light now paul would write it like this in another place now ye are the body of christ and members in particular and god hath set some in the church notice god hath set some in the church first the prophets apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues now brother would liken it in this way over and over throughout the message it's a very uh very simple example but i like those things which god comes down and he use things to make it clear brother brown would take the example he said i'm going to speak of god being like a great master diamond and he talked about how that you know from when he was there in kimberley south africa and those different places of how that you know uh the the they have the diamonds you can ride right past one on the side of a road a matter of fact one of the greatest diamonds that was ever found in diamonds in the rough they don't look like much but in order for that diamond for there to be fire to be displayed in that diamond it's got to be cut but in order to cut it as in the case of the one great diamond they took a man years to study it because if he makes the wrong cut it'll mess that whole diamond up so the man had to study that diamond for a long time in order to know where to make the cut but when the cut was made and then everyone how the cuts then from there that'll come off of it there then when the light itself as the light would begin to show upon that diamond inside of that diamond would there would be that of a fire seemingly to glow in the midst of that diamond because where it has been formed by the fire now when that has been cut in order for that diamond it is cut and once it is cut in paragraph 106 of the oddball brother brown so when that diamond is is cut so that it will reflect what's on the inside of it the fire that's in that diamond it has to be cut to every little way every little shape three points you put the three points to a diamond and a light against the three-point object we'll give seven colors and he said now i want you to notice god was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities he was cut bruised that great diamond that from him might reflect the gifts to the church i know not everybody's wife is here including mine but how many of you brothers how many of you bought your wife let's say for those that maybe you bought your wife a diamond i don't care what size it is you bought her a ring how many of you bought her a ring for her to put that in a box and put it in a drawer no sir buddy when i gave him when i gave that engagement ring that solitaire to my wife when she accepted my she accepted my proposal and i had asked her her daddy and that that that ring buddy she wore that ring sheen never took it off the wedding band's been joined to it she wears that thing with pride and ain't proud about it being a diamond she's proud she's married and we just happen to love one another amen you say what are you saying i don't think anybody buys or gives a diamond and says here this diamond only served a purpose you put it in a drawer neither has god removed the ministerial gifts from the church of the living god and the real bride of jesus christ she's not ashamed of the ministerial gifts or the nine spiritual gifts she's not ashamed whether she has been united with him it ain't something that she has to say come to me and i'll show you in my little hope chest but all of this right here has already been fulfilled that ain't the bride of jesus christ the bride of jesus christ knows that he's still the same yesterday today and forever she's a living witness of this message that this message is not a historical event it's a present happening hallelujah glory be to god i wear it everywhere i go hallelujah amen hallelujah every little piece brother braham said it comes from that chipping is not destroyed when they cut that diamond every little piece it's not destroyed it's put to use many of them are made to victrola needles and those needles bring forth what that's been shipped from the diamond they bring forth music that's been canned into a record there have been many things god has canned in his word and every so often god would send forth a victrola needle and a prophet would come along and be able to reveal what's canned in the word what's been sealed whether that's when you can it oh my when something's canned it's been sealed but it takes a needle to reveal what's been sealed it's not the needle that does it but the needle there's a gift that's there that betrayal a needle that's able when it comes glory be to god when it comes upon that word that has been written or canned or ordained for this day when it comes upon it moved by an unseen hand brother it releases what is written in the word for that day and it reveals him to be the same yesterday today and forever what does that gives from the mighty conqueror [Applause] hallelujah oh he said i hope you see it the chip from christ the gift from christ put upon the bible it speaks out the hidden mysteries of god to the believer he knows the secret of the heart he knows every person he said do you believe it he would not be the diamond saying see what i am it's what he come from the diamond is a diamond because he's off of a diamond don't you realize brother brian why you're a diamond you came from the master diamond [Applause] you're not a diamond isn't as though you made yourself a diamond but it has been that which has been revealed to you i have come from the master diamond hallelujah gifts of conquering gifts that manifest his victory [Music] [Applause] you might not have a ministerial gift in your life but your life will preach sermons in places where no apostle prophet pastor evangelist or teacher can get to [Music] hallelujah your life preaches sermons revelation that god has given in this hour and that revelation has been inscripted on your life you're not an epistle wrote by a man wrote by a church wrote by a set of creeds you are an epistle that has been written and manifestly declared by the spirit of christ [Applause] hallelujah not i that liveth christ liveth in me that's the way the gifts of the spirit is he goes on to say it's a part of that diamond it's sent been brought down and brought into a gift to interpret to preach to teach he said there's five spiritual gifts apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists and they are all for the edifying of the body of christ it's an awful big statement and i don't have time to preach it tonight but just as sure as there is teachers pastors there's got to be prophets and it don't do no good to send a prophet if you ain't going to have apostles pastors teachers and evangelists they all work in conjunction because if you do away with one it's because you put the diamond away because that diamond is made to display the different types of light black light green light red light blue light it will actually display the different rays of light but every one of those rays reflect from the same and on to the same great master diamond oh glory aren't you glad that you've got a token that says i've not only been engaged i've been married i've got on the wedding band you know what the wedding band is it says that you yourself remember his word is right there in you you can speak the word that's what that means you've got the king seal you've got his name the wedding band of identification has already been placed upon you you are wearing it with authority thank god when we would come into a service brother danny or we come into a certain time and how the spirit of god will move right down and he'll take a gift and that man don't know nothing about you he don't know even the thoughts you've been taking he don't know what's been going through your mind and the spirit of god will take that gift in that life and he will reflect himself in such a way that you think who's been talking to him how did he find this out even though you know but it's just something you stand in awe how does he know that because he the master diamond is reflecting a ray of light through one of those chips that came off of him and brother he's right there to minister to our needs what is he the mighty conqueror reflecting himself and dispersing through the great rays of the diamond oh glory every one of those gifts every one of those rays or gifts they can be a little peculiar when the prophet himself when he was standing here he began to realize how people were drawing lines they were making differences now bear in mind the scripture even that we read last week or that you could recall to mind out of first corinthians 12 because the hand is not the ear it cannot say i'm not part of the body or because the nose can say well because i'm not the foot i'm not the body but god took the example of the body of how all these things in the body are to work together to achieve one purpose is that right i need my eye i need my ears to hear my wife say it's time for dinner i need my eyes to find the seat or my eyes to say how about a little more right here and i need now listen to me my stomach is needing it but it ain't just my stomach that's needing it it's the organs of my body that are needing that food which are the cells of my body that make it up but you see the cells can't come out of the body and go into the pantry and take a little oatmeal pie and unwrap it i'm not advocating that for nutrition but you under you get what i mean the cells though they need it they can't do it there's got to be coordination on every part it takes every part to do what so that that cell can get the food and that cell doesn't say thank god for the hands boy your eyes sir couldn't do much no that's hell glory be to god that cell recognizes us if it had not been for the years hearing the nose smelling and there being eyes to see it and there had been a mouth that could be opened there would be teeth present to chew it and that there through that stomach there would be acids come upon that and break that down and then disperse that through the body and then it makes its way into the cell the cell knows every one of those parts have made it available that i'm sustained right here tonight let me tell you something it is because of the living god that has been and is still working through a many-membered body that the body of jesus christ is alive and standing on earth tonight in the resurrected power of his glory it's because lives that have been yielded is the eye more than the hand no the glory is i was able to be a part of what god was doing i was able whatever the little part could be that's how these different gifts and the prophet he picked this up of how that in this time how there were differences where people were they were making differences but it wasn't the people it's just they didn't understand they were saying brother adam here the spirit of god was picking it up where you could say one has the gift there you know of the teacher one's a pastor one's evangelist or one's speaking tongue or want to prophesy and he said because this one has this gift but the other one don't have that gift then then they said they start looking at it and it becomes differences well i can tell you right now that's the same way this is why we need the help of the spirit of god this is why god don't have every ministry that every ministry will go from first gear to fifth gear god has some ministry that'll stay in fifth gear and wear the devil out just as much as somebody who's going in fifth gear you understand it doesn't matter if it's first gear or fifth gear but sometimes what happens is is the misunderstandings teachers are not looked at to be that spiritual evangelists are looked at to be oh they're just radical they're just pastors are looked to be like well you know dad he's always here apostles it's just it's looked at in a manner well it's not this is but see what it is god has set for what he's needed for that time god doesn't want everybody to where they operate in fifth gear god don't want every time even that i preach that i operate within fifth gear some of the times i've fallen on my face maybe you don't know it but it seems like it's right out in the open it seems like when i've not got into the right gear and i feel like i'm fumbling and tripling all of myself and it's just a reminder for me you know what you're going too fast now that don't mean i'm going to slow down it just means i'll go this pace that he wants me to go when he wants me to go other times he gives it to me all i have to do my mind's not good my mind's not that good i have to just be yielded and let him speak so it flows it comes out and it's connected i have to give it or else brother carlos it leaves my mind because you all don't want me to stop and write notes up here do you and say hold on a minute i got a note for later on but everything it's a little peculiar but these lights are all gathered together to reflect one person now i want you to just to think of this here as we bring this on down every one of these lights and how that they the rays and how that they they shine every one of them brother branham would say like this in the message gifts he says these uh god is like a great diamond he just refers back to that then in the next paragraph i want to go he says and they lay that diamond they lay it in light great rays of light shines off from it and those are god's messengers gifts all of it comes back to the same self same god the gift of healing the gift of preaching the gift of prophesying all the spiritual gifts of the body are just rays or reflections off of the self-same god here's what they declare every one of those rays he says for one is to given knowledge for the brahman time that gift of knowledge he said is like a prophet like ezekiel can see far off and identify these symbols identify what this is and bring it present tense to another wisdom to another gifts of healing to another gifts of prophecy but all by the selfsame spirit the great diamond and the big rays of light that we see shoot this way shoot that way all declare one thing there is a god that lives and reigns and as long as you see those things in operation you know that that god is still the same amen opera as long as he's operating in one of those little rays of light there's still a god that lives and reigns now i want you to see this as we close this is not limited to just ministers it's not even limited to those that at some point in time if god ever operated one of the nine spiritual gifts it's not just limited to that these are love gifts from the mighty conqueror brother branham put it like this he said if i was god i gave you my word and you read it you didn't believe it that'd be all he said but not god he said god so loved that he sent five ministerial offices in the church and he said still if you don't get it he said now man would have said you still don't get it he said but not god god placed nine spiritual gifts what are we looking at the love of god god trying to get his message across i've witnessed where god has spoke his word right through a service and then it come right to the end of the service and i've witnessed how that the spirit of god would fall upon one and call somebody out and it called them out and the next thing you know they're standing right there at the altar it was not something general where they had to know it was in themselves god put their name on that interpretation and they were found right at the altar repenting and giving their life to god you say what is that i'm saying that's the love of god that's god's love the devil could have you know tried to play around well that's just you know that's just them they know about you you know it's just telling you about your life he knows about your life but let me tell you something when that steps on the scene even like that you know what if they wouldn't respond to the preaching god in his mercy will not be defeated what is that the love of god the gifts of the mighty conqueror reflect his love back into the church every special that sung is to reflect his love back into the church every gift is to reflect his love his love his life back into the church and so it comes down that it's not us it's not the gift though the gift of pastor is in my life but that gift i don't operate that gift god operates through that gift to minister to needs that come here and by revelation have been revealed to them that that's the man that god has put that gift of a pastor for my life to where you're not just calling me a pastor but in your mind you think of me just he's just a preacher but you recognize that man has been given a stewardship see this is why this is why it's not just something we just take haphazardly we're to pray over it and it needs to be spiritually revealed is that right because what there'll be times that you know what this can disappoint you there'll be times that things can be said you may not agree with but if there's a revelation just like in your marriage but if there's a revelation that's there that's greater than your feelings your ideas your opinions it's greater than anything it's what holds us that's why there must be a real revelation on these things this is what was spoken in the message gifts from the conqueror so it's your life my life places brother bill i never did walk in norsen's you did there's people in your family between you brother richard and different ones there's people in your family i'll never meet but your lives brother gomez people in your family i'd never meet brother danny sister sarah brother trevor there's people i never meet but after all he wouldn't do no good if i did meet him it has to be god moving on their heart but you see in your life you might think well i ain't that good at putting this together i ain't that good at explaining this or putting that together or putting this together just let go and let god use you maybe you may not be the one to set everybody down and go through this and go through that maybe that may not be the part that you're called to but listen you're a part within the body that your life can so testify that somebody can look and say what is it about your life that's different there's something different about your life i know of the christians but there's something different about your life and what happens it's christ in you reflecting his own life his victory that's getting a hold of that life what's been happening your life has preached a series to them sometimes just exactly that you felt like they're not listening they're not listening and so and so they're obscene or this or that but brother all along remember he has given gifts for the rebellious that the lord god might dwell among them what does the gift do it is a chip off of the diamond that can actually reflect that light we are witnesses over and over in the scriptures we'll just stop here tonight you find when paul would talk about the ministry paul would not there was only certain times paul would use the exclusiveness of what god had revealed to him but he always made it aware that god revealed it for us we are workers in this together paul would over and over use those terms over and over again same as the prophet did in this hour when he had the brethren gathered together there questions and answers 1959 i believe 16 one of those he has them called together he said brother you realize what i'm doing here this evening you are messengers in the same message with me let me just tell you you are messengers in this same message because the message it's more than a tape it's more than a book the message has got to be more than brother branham said it's got to be christ revealed to you personally to where your flesh is the actual garment that his glory is revealed through so who are we leading people to jesus christ jesus christ that's what the gifts from the conqueror does it leads it to jesus christ that's what every gift that's to me every gift that plays up here it ought to be a life that is surrendered to god in such a measure that christ can operate and reflect his life through not just up here but out everywhere we go it ought to be a mark that's a christian every special that sung every minister that sings hey listen we've got to bring it all the way across every minister that preaches needs to have a personal meeting with god and if every minister needs to have that then so does every part of this congregation what a glorious reality what a glorious reality we we have been an admin admonished by the spirit of god as reflections rays of light brother brahma said it like this he said like that nightingale he said i seen that nightingale he said it would sing and sing and he said would sing those songs that little birdie he said but then i come to realize he said the reason it would sing he said is because if they could see one star they would get their eyes on that star and they would start singing because they knew the light is shining in another place and that nightingale would just sing and sing and sing same way with that little spring brother brown would go and drink from be refreshed why are you doing this is it because i come and drink here it's because of the deer what is it he said if they could talk he would tell me it's not you brother branham but there is a force behind me that causes me to bubble up brother branham would take those two examples and place it how god uses his gifts in the body it's not you it's not me a gift is not given to me nor a gift given to you that we would take a hold of it but a gift is for us to yield aren't you glad don't you just want your life to be a reflection that oh it don't it don't point people necessarily even though people might want to know where do you go to church but it points them beyond the church it points them to a living reality it points them to something that they know there's something different i can't put my finger on it but there's something different about you what is it it's a life reflecting the mighty conqueror that's what we want to be don't we let's pray oh heavenly father lord tonight our hearts are truly stirred challenged lord of revisiting of the commission lord for every heart that's here for every life that's streaming father this is the desire the burden in our lives is that the mighty conqueror would be reflected the our lord no matter what situation who we come across there's things the lord that maybe in one person's life this other person maybe maybe never dealt with that but this other person lord you came on the scene maybe they were so entwined with certain things within the world but god you manifested your victory not just loosening from those things but to where the lord that you would become the very lord of their life you look through their eyes you speak through their mouth branches of the vine lord jesus their life is a testimony a written epistle a living oracle of the mighty conqueror it reflects that living reality of the victory day of calvary it reflects what that day was all about where the price was finished the work was finished then lord when you ascended on high after your resurrection and meeting with chosen witnesses that you would reveal yourself to send back the holy ghost and those gifts of the conqueror the mighty conqueror he would reflect that overcoming power that light right down into the church of the living god lord there's corners there's areas i think of that song that many of us know many times it would be sung when one would go out lord to take the gospel and yet it would also speak to us where we live where we work and our families brighten the corner where you are brighten the corner where you are let your life let your light so shine then men might see your good works and glorify your heavenly father for the candle is not lit just to be lit but one lights a candle and places it on a candlestick because as it's been lit it's raised up into a place that it can actually cast light throughout that house where others can see lord may our lives may our lives declare shine that light the glorious light of the gospel that others might see that same lord jesus maybe they wouldn't know what to call it maybe they lord do not know not even maybe having words but they know there's something about it there's something lord that begins to draw upon what's in their lives lord may our lives be lived in such a way that is salty as so to cause thirst among others help us lord among our families among our friends help us lord among our co-workers help us lord among one another lord god for even as we come here and we gather there's some lord that come here the lord they need a deeper walk with you and each of us lord we want to move closer i pray heavenly father may our lives lord god may it be a beckoning lord may it be a reflection lord when problems come up when questions lord when trials arise lord god when sickness is lord oh god and things that are so far beyond lord god want anything a medical science can do but yet lord god we've got the promise in your word i'm the lord that healeth all fine diseases may you manifest lord yourself lord god as the mighty conqueror lord god through your gifts lord god those chips off of the diamond lord that would reflect lord that same fire and would glorify jesus christ ready lord god oh father i pray lord god right now tonight for every need for every request or god may you just lord minister to that life that need that heart personally lord oh lord jesus that heart that's away from you lord may they realize lord it's just to receive what you've already done that's what the gifts refer they reflect back the finished work oh jesus how we love you lord as a bride oh lord jesus we love every one of your gifts these are gifts lord god that you sent with us in mind we need every one of them lord [Music] lord jesus we thank you for him help us to be yielded insensitive or god to be used of you maybe we've never lord stood on this pulpit maybe they've been somebody lord maybe they hadn't been called on to pray or something like that it doesn't mean anything less at all the lord god in their life when they would walk in that factory in that factory walks the son of god that's been redeemed by the blood of the lamb and their life when he walks in there lord it's a life where there's a sounding of the jubilee that goes forth freedom freedom freedom freedom sometimes the lord maybe there's co-workers that get upset at them and they can't even think why they don't know what what's been done why is this person against me it's not the person it's a demon that has them bound and that demon knows there's a call going out of freedom there's a freedom of liberty that's through that life and that demon is trying to keep them bound the lord jesus this life that's in this blood glory be to god hallelujah you said in my name they shall cast out devils lord god through that life that's lived in sweetness and humility lord god there's a sound of freedom that goes forth liberty you're free you're free lord jesus may that co-worker come to it lord for we know we're not just placed in the units we work in the sections we're at it's not just haphazard that we just got assigned there our lives are to be reflections among people that never lord god would have never read a bible never seen lord anything at all but lord god they have a need in their life they need to be redeemed help us lord help us lord i pray every one of us as gifts from the mighty conqueror lord god through the kind word that we would express to that person who cuts our meat at the meat counter that kind word what god to that person may be at the register oh god help us lord i pray [Music] in the name of jesus christ amen oh don't you love him tonight amen if you'd like to stand go ahead [Music] yes jesus [Music] who give me a heart that's filled with love and make [Music] jesus make me thee jesus make me make me fill my heart give me a heart that's filled with love [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus think before [Music] me like me oh give me a heart with your love and maybe i need more of you [Music] that's the way it's got to be i need more of you till there's no room left in me [Applause] [Music] all those wasted hours and minutes they're yours now lord from the start to the finish i need more of you lord i need more more of you living in me let's dedicate ourselves the lord sing this second verse before dismissed [Music] nothing less [Music] [Music] and the world can have all the rest [Music] lord i could never get enough [Music] of your grace and
