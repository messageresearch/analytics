well thank you Lord we have heard the message shalone and all is well amen there is is a place of perfect rest behind the veil thank God so we can rest little bride rest for all his way God bless you uh I uh almost two about two weeks ago I was at the Bow Shoot and riding home with a brother to his house to stay that night I received a call from uh brother Jesus from per uh from New Jersey and he said brother I've been sharing all the testimonies with a brother brother that uh and uh he he he said if I if you could call him it was late at night so I called him and he was uh telling me that he had cancer and the prostate so bad that it had spread and he they gave him up and uh you know and so he while we're talking took about 2 hours um he says uh well if the Lord wants to take me he can take me if he doesn't want to take me he wants me to leave be here I'll be here whatever the Lord will and uh I'm not a person to pray that way you know you have to be determined am and make a decision whether you're going to believe or not so I just waited and waited and getting to the end I said Lord you know I'm over at the brother's house and they're ready to go to bed and but I don't want to rush things you know may your will be done but then all of a sudden on the phone he screams out pray for me I'm like shocked you know and he says will you please pray for me and I said Do you believe he said just now I believe he said I know God would do it I said well now we can pray you know I thought to myself now we can pray you know so prayed and uh uh this past Saturday while going to a meeting uh I receive a call and it's him and he says I just want to call you he says because and let you know he says he went we went and took test on my PSI or I forget how what's it called PSA what is it called BSA and uh he says it's down to four and there's nothing that they can find and and and then he started crying and he says please tell everybody tell everybody that you know it's a miracle this is a miracle and I said I will I will share that so I just wanted to share that with you also want to share that a sister called me and she was really broken up crying and nervous she said Brother Ray will you please pray for me she says I've been going through a lot and I said sure we'll pray right now so we prayed by the end of the prayer you can hear her rejoicing you know because God God reached down and touched her and a minister brother called me and yesterday and asked me to pray because he didn't know what happened he he was on the writing lawn more and he went to go park it and he got up off of it and the next thing he found himself laying over the riding lawnmower and his wife was wondering where he's at and she went out and found him and he was laying across and she couldn't help him he's heavy and big uh but he says Brother Ray would you you know pray I said sure will so he called today giving God the honor and Glory just wanted to share that with you wonderful man praise God what a wonderful testimony amen praise God God still answers prayer amen that should give us Faith to believe maybe God probably had Brother Ray say that because one of us is going to be facing something we need we need prayer amen let's take take it to the Lord in prayer let's just sing that little song he is all I need sister Stephanie's got a testimony for us tonight as she comes comes let's just sing that he is all I need he is all my need Jesus is all I need oh he all I say all you need he he is all might oh Jesus is all I [Music] need God bless you all um I just want to take a moment to ruin the devil's day and give my testimony I know some of yall know that I was in a car accident last week um before I go into that I want to start backtrack a little bit um I've been going through some persecution at work lately um I try not to let it get under my skin just because I know how Satan is and how he's just anointing everybody and anybody that he can to just get to um you know the Lord's children and so an incident happened at work without getting in too many too much detail um so something happened and and a lot of people were talking we are a union Factory so a lot of people I was heing the chatter oh we're going to take this to the the union reps we're going to go to the big bosses you know we're going to we're going to take this girl down and that's what I've been feeling like like I've just been feeling like everyone's trying to destroy me lately um so it did it got under my skin I got fired up a little bit but calm myself down took myself to HR I talked to her I vented and uh I was like look did I handle this situation right so I told her the situation and she's like yeah handled everything just perfectly and they even sent out an email saying Stephanie's not at fault everything is fine you know just leave it alone so I was happy that the Lord took care of that um so weekend came thank the Lord for that also got away from all the people um so I just stayed home you know with my daughter and just medit did a lot of meditating I've been doing a lot of that lately um but Monday comes so before I go to work I like to listen to the word whether it's a message or um a minister um so I came across a short series called um down but not destroyed by um Brother David silers preaching it let me tell you good message to bully the devil with so I did all morning long I just you know encouragement there and I just I bullied Satan um got to work the chatter was still going on but I'm like whatever you know it's done um later that day a dear friend of mine leaves from work only to find out she's had her second miscarriage so now I'm heartbroken and still a little upset about all the chatter I'm hearing um so I just I walk off the line and I go and pray for her cuz my my heart's desire is to see she's a dear friend I want to see her come to the Lord first and foremost but I would second miscarriage I'm just I'm heartbroken because I I want to see her become a mother um so Monday's done Tuesday wake up finish listening to this series it's like a four-part series right now um go to work and everything like that people are still talking still brushing it off um then someone comes in gets me off my line at work says is don't panic but your daughter's school is under a level three active shooter lockdown luckily false alarm but mother's instincts I mean of course I'm going to panic so I run off the line get my phone open it up right away I see the text Mom we're on lockdown this is real this is real but then I see false alarm so my heart's like but still I'm I'm it's too late I've done already panicked um so it's about 2:30 in the afternoon or so um I'm finishing up work I get off at 3:30 go off my line I call Olivia I get a hold of her and she's like yeah I don't know what happened they're just saying false alarm like well I need to know you know false alarm ain't good enough for me what happened you know you know how M are um so I was like all right I'll be home shortly I'm G leave here in like 20 minutes once I get my line cleared up everything's you know good to go so I leave work there's a lot of construction going on where my job was located actually the road is closed literally right at my job um so a lot of people don't think traffic is coming from that way and there's also many signs on that road so um I'm traveling on 13 going about 60 M an hour get to Mason Road the intersection there um I see the the woman she stopped and literally at the last second she start start pulling out and all I could think was like this is not happening um Lord help me and I just brace myself because there's no stopping going 60 miles an hour last minute and I didn't have my seat belt on um but thank the Lord seat belt or not airbags are not those didn't even deploy either he was with me through the whole accident um it was weird um just watching it happen like I I seen it all happen people a lot of people say oh you probably don't remember but I I do um maybe it's a good thing because I can be more grateful um but when it after it happened I was able to pull off the road and I remember just sitting there and all of a sudden fear just started speaking um everything like your car is total you just paid it off your car is total now you're going to have a car payment what are you going to do you're a single mom all kinds of um everything you can think of just started coming to my mind um what have you done to the Lord like you must have really ticked him off for all this to be happening to you it's been it's been a a week for you huh and then other things people said to me like um for instance I'm not going to call the names but you sure this is the right way you're going because all this bad happening to you you know maybe you need to give it up and try something else so I mean everything everything just started to come and but I'm like no get out the car so I get out the car um start walking around I look over I see all these buzzers on the tower and I've heard enough messages brother the Brandon preach ain't got nothing to say good about them buzzards so I'm like where you at Satan like I'm ready to fight Satan on the side of 13 you know for everything he's been putting me through um so tow truck comes gets my car out of there my neighbor comes she picks me up my adrenaline's high so I didn't take an ambulance but later on I I was feeling some sort of way so I went to the ER was a little sore you know obviously I got whiplash um they did scans on my uh my head my abdomen um my chest took x-rays on my arm everything came back fine um I did suffer a concussion um that got a little bit rough on Friday night but you know the Lord I was like Lord brought me through this accident alive he's going to get me through this concussion too so it's in the moment it was terrible but praise the Lord anyway through everything even through my trials right um so concussion what else happened thinking I don't have my brain freeze brain fog is still there a little bit um so I was off of work for a week so that was nice I got to just kind of stay home and relax and also um just meditate like I was telling brother Samuel the other day like I feel so exhausted um I couldn't you find myself to really like pray like how I thought you know I should be praying like speaking I just just sat outside and just you know just focused on the Lord and just had a time with him really stayed in the word and listen to messages um um then I had to go back to work yesterday um and it was a decent day everyone you know most people were concerned anyway so I got to give my testimony to a huge Factory I got to glorify my Lord and I'm not ashamed I don't care like I will tell like you're going to sit there if you're going to ask me how I am what happened you're going to hear about my Jesus okay you're going to know it was him and him alone and I'm so grateful and everyone will know that but then today came and I get pulled into the office more chatter so um just the devil trying to get at me again you know I'm like you're too late dude like you know too late so but yeah people still trying to destroy me but I'm still listening to that series down in Destroy so you know God God's got me covered he's got me covered and everything's going to be all right I don't care like like I said Satan okay I was out for a very long time I'm done with that he done had his chance it's over I'm the Lord's full of the Holy Ghost and there's nothing he can do to shake my faith I'm right here I know where I stand the Lord and I no but I do want to read a few scriptures that I came across want to read them sorry I want you to listen up too Satan so we are pressured in every way hedged in but not crushed perplexed unsure of finding a way out but not driven to despair hunted down Anderson persecuted but not deserted to stand alone struck down but never destroyed and we know with great confidence that God who is deeply concerned about us causes all things to work together as a plan for good for those who love God to those who are called according to his plan and and purpose so who shall ever separate us from the love of Christ will tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword just as it is written and forever remains written for your sake we are put to death all day long we are regarded as sheep for the slaughter yet in all these things we are more than conquerors and gain an overwhelming Victory through him who loved us so much that he died for us I am convinced and continue to be convinced Beyond any doubt that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present and threatening nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the unlimited love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord So What then shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us God bless you all than give God glory hallelujah amen how me say right along Satan you done come too late say right along with our sister amen you done come too late how many's been through tough trials amen and the devil come and speak to you those kind of things about oh maybe this ain't the right way maybe you're you're going the wrong way maybe God's mad at you but he's always been faithful amen hallelujah I want to sing that when she said that I'm not afraid of the darkness Who Shall I Fear if God before me what shall we say to these things what shall we say to the these things well I'm not afraid anymore I'm not afraid anymore well I'm not afraid of the darkness Who Shall I Fear if God before me well what shall we say to these brother Samuel comes and what shall we say to these things oh I'm not afraid [Music] anymore I'm Not Afraid sing one more time I'm not afraid of the darkness Who Shall I Fear if God before me what shall we say to these things what shall we say to these things I'm not afraid anymore I'm not afraid [Music] anymore amen hallelujah praise God that want's a hard one to end CU it's just so good you just kind of want to keep going amen but we're looking forward to the word tonight let's just sing this as Samuel comes brother Bill used to sing this one a lot I really love this old song Amen he hideth my soul in the Cliff of the Rock [Music] Amen a little higher maybe oh wonderful savior is Jesus my Lord oh wonderful savior to me he hideth my soul in the C of the rock where iners of pleasure I see oh he hideth my soul in the clay of the rock that Shadows a Dr the thiry Hallelujah he hideth my life in the depths of his love and covers me there with his hand [Music] and covers me there with his [Music] hand oh wonderful savior is Jesus smile how many say Amen to this he taketh my burden away he hold me up and I shall not be moved he me stength as let's go to that last verse when clothed when clothed in his brightness transport did I Rise to meet him in clouds of the sky Hallelujah Glory his perfect salvation is wonderful love I'll shout with the milons let's all stand amen praise God for he hideth my soul in the CL of The Rock and shadows [Music] of my life in the de of love ands me there with his hand oh and cover [Music] there praise the name of the Lord Jesus I'm thankful we have a rock it's just not a rock It's The Rock they would write in the scriptures David would speak of it there is no Rock like our Rock I think about the gentleman that went on the field there after the battle was over they had put mustard gas everywhere and killed everything and he said he was drawn to go over and look underneath a rock and he lifted up that rock and there was growing a little flower hallelu you know to me those aren't just stories that are included in the message CU there's times where we have felt like in our lives where mustard gas has been all over us yes oh yes but aren't you glad that our lives are hidden with God in Christ there's a place that place of safety that place that we can let off the pressure that place in the midst of the age in the time that we're living in listen even the the chaos that we see out there listen this is where brother Bram said he said I believe I've come to this place just as the Lord Jesus was on the cross and said father forgive them for they know not what they do he said that's what's taking place it's Spirits that's driving the people they don't know what they're doing and how thankful we ought to be for God's grace cuz at one time we we were driven that's right by those Spirits we were under those influence we were under one influence of one Spirit or another it's but God in his Mercy that that's what it was May God help us let that never Escape our hearts it was the mercy of God that reached down for our lives amen I'm so thankful for that I'm glad that as the song we just sung he hideth my soul in the Clift of the rock that's what's so important we want to just um go to the Lord in prayer right before we turn to the word tonight I want to say thank you for the uh the testimonies that were given and U so we so have appreciate that and I was able to hear them in the office there and just always appreciate that David said I will talk of thy doings amen and so we appreciate that very much and uh the gentleman was 102 years old you know every time when there's been many times when I've as I've prayed for others and I read in Isa Isaiah 53 I don't find any notation with a superscript letter that says this only applies to below the age of 65 that's right there you go you know brother Bram told us that brother Bosworth and this was the own own testimony and then you can read it among others brother Bosworth didn't die from any illness he just was ready to go home right he didn't die from any illness you know and even if there is an illness or something as I've said before we we stand on this cancer has never ever taken anybody that's right remember death is only a servant it's a master now because of Calvary death now to the believer only becomes a servant to pull us into the presence of God brother Bram called it like this brother Bram said in one in the one place and Beyond the curtain of time he said that death he said it's just like that just a small little shock and then we're there he said just like when you come from the womb and they spank that baby and it comes in he says just a little shock and we're then on the other side aren't you glad that he made a way amen I'm so thankful for that I have two prayer requests that or two prayer cloths I'm holding in my hand tonight and we just ask the Lord just join with me in prayer that God will just just be merciful to these needs also continue to remember the needs of uh the different ones there in the South uh from my understanding right now everything that I have received and uh with the contact from the brothers there's not been any believers that were hurt within that but many of the uh there's churches you know brother Donnie's church and then brother Barry's Church in those two places has really been working together and brother darl Ward sent a request this morning and text and said just please pray for us because you know there's nothing going on with the government and so you have people going in there and they're just going in and clearing things back and getting to the people but you're getting in among people and he says there's things that you're seeing where there's just anger and he said just pray for us that God will keep keep the brother are safe as they go in there and just trying to move things away and also trying to take supplies in there as well so um just let's just pray I I tell you when you some of you no doubt everybody's seen pictures you've seen Drone footage of those it's amazing those very areas um you know I know Ben drove down in those areas very much there was areas for the men's meetings some of those places we kind of drove there's no more roadway no more and it's not back roads it's Interstate inter State and so there's certain towns that are just wiped off the map brother the Barry sent a couple pictures where just 48 hours before you see all these shops all along the road and then 48 hours later it's nothing and it's just dirt and rock and the roads all gone I tell you if there's one thing about it that is really just a scratch compared to what's coming in the tribulation and I don't say I don't say that light I say that because I tell you these are thing that's why brother BR says he said cut me open fill me full of sulfur but God don't let me be found here in that tribulation period we want to be ready to go don't we amen and in these times like this let's just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you for your mercies once again tonight your heavenly father thank you Lord Lord for the testimonies of your mercy Lord moving down lord upon needs Lord Lord to minister Lord to Father Lord lives Lord father how that God even with sister Stephanie standing here lord it's it's a miracle Lord father we thank you God for your mercies Lord that Lord as you would continue Lord to give her strength Lord we know that God that father you're you're the same Lord yesterday today and forever Lord You're our healer Lord father we just Lord look to you tonight that God that for these requests that I hold in my hand these prayer cloths Lord father as we join our hearts together Lord we would ask that God that the same anointing tonight oh God the same quickening power Lord that has brought us from death unto life and father that we would Lord yield ourselves to Lord not only to minister but to hear and receive from the word may that same quickening power go forward Lord as these Lord cloths are laid upon those needs Lord may I pray the Holy Spirit just moved dear God for each one in a special way Lord you see the needs Lord of our brothers and sisters Lord certainly God as you've kept your hand Lord upon Lord their lives but Lord we see not only there's been things Lord that father where loss has been suffered some physically Lord some dear God with loss of life and Lord all the way through there God we pray for all Humanity Lord father oh God for I think that if you were so merciful enough that how your Prophet would pray that the Medical Science would come up with a cure for cancer because father you knew there'd be people that wouldn't believe in Divine Healing but your desire is for Humanity and it runs so deep Lord and we look at that Lord what an example Lord that's been set before us and so father we lift these needs before your throne of grace Lord that father you might Lord give strength to the brothers and those that are on the ground Lord giving assistance Lord Lord and may you keep your hand upon them Lord keep them safe and I pray that God if there's lives and hearts that within there that maybe Lord have never considered just how fragile life is Lord and how quickly things can change may it be a moment Lord where your grace will come to them Lord that there'll be a preparation made in their life for that greater storm that's on the horizon granted Lord we pray tonight we commit this service into your hands and ask that you come and be the speaker here tonight Lord we commit ourselves to you now Lord in Jesus precious name amen God bless you amen if you'll turn with me in your Bibles to 1 Chronicles chapter 29 I just have just a few verses of scripture that I want to draw from here in 1 Chronicles 29 and I would like to read verses 10 through verses 19 I know you've been standing here just for for a little bit David says in verse 10 wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation and said blessed be thou Lord God of Israel Our Father forever and ever thine O Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom O Lord and thou art exalted Ed has had above all both riches and honor come of thee and thou reignest over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand is to make great and to give strength unto all now therefore Our God we thank thee and praise thy glorious name but who am I and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers our days on the Earth are as a shadow and there is none abiding oh Lord Our God all this store that we have prepared to build thee in house for thine Holy Name cometh of thine hand and is all thine Lord I know also my God that thou triest the heart and has pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things and now have I seen with joy thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee Oh Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel our fathers keep this forever in the imagination Hallelujah of the thoughts of the hearts of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart to keep thy Commandments thy testimonies and thy statutes and to do all these things and to build the palace for the which I have made provision amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated um May if we can go ahead and Brianna you can switch it on over I'd like to just speak to you tonight once again and uh try to come into this place of the framing of reality and try to tie this together and um this right when we look here in the scriptures we were looking at last last week of the approach and and the building there of the temple and I want to just draw your attention to that verse that we read in 1 Chronicles 29:18 where David in the midst of his prayer he's asked God keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the hearts of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee you know brother Bram Will Tell Us in the message greatest batt thought that the Mind itself is the Battleground it's the no man's land and so God chose the heart Satan chose the head but that mind being No Man's Land that's where the Prophet said where the powers meet and they test their their powers they they test their capabilities and when you think about it that if my mind your mind it's a no man's land then you know we have a choice on what what we're going to fill it with and it's always you know in one of those things where my desire is is Lord I know he's the one that has to make the word live but I want to just let the word be laid into my spirit I want to let it be laid into my mind I just want to I just want to lay in it because then then God will take and draw from that and you know it's not just him drawing from it but there there is an effect Upon Our Lives from really laying in the presence of God is an effect from being from being in prayer and and praying over the things you know just like when you're listening to a message or you come out of a service there's things that you will take and maybe it'll be tomorrow morning it'll strike your heart and and you'll take it and you'll just begin to pray over maybe it's something that just seemed like it's just turned you around and it's just such a joy in your heart something you've heard and it spoke so deeply maybe it's something that has caused you to go down in your life and you realize this is a loosening to something that's had a hold that's hindered me that I didn't know why this was this way or why this this would come in this way and you know even in that there's a rejoicing as the light of God comes to expose every bit of hold in our life and I'll tell you if we will walk in the light as he's in the light then we have Fellowship that Fellowship there's a growing in our lives of his influence and so you know that to me is just it's a blessed thing that to be able to fill our lives with with the presence of God with the word of God I I've said this to you many times that when I prepare and get ready to minister and you know sometimes it can be where there's just thoughts and things that's just you know things that just been laying there we've been building to it but I just I I my heart's desire is with looking at quote after quote and scripture after scripture which would not even be within the outline I just want my spirit to be so saturated because if there's anything cuz there have been many times I've been standing right here and there's been quotes or scriptures that I didn't put in the outline and I thought man that's a powerful thought but you know that there you know it's just one that was wonderful but then the holy spirit will come right around and all of a sudden that'll come out or maybe something that I've read back there and and maybe something I looked at and thought it didn't fit but I'm glad that God is so mindful to be able to pull on those things just as we have need of it you know that's his promise when the spirit of Truth has come he said I will bring these things to your remembrance he also said when you get in the heat of the battle take no thought what you shall say it shall be given to you in that moment that's right you see all of this when we stand there with the word and looking at it in that way it really brings us into a place of a real rest and you know thinking of how the that Solomon and David would pray this prayer and that aspect of it keep this what what is it that David was asking that God would keep this in the imagination of their hearts in the framework of all their thoughts is this very portion back in verse 17 of to know that these things come from you what we have to surrender to you you have given to us what it is that you're requiring so it's just like when it came to build the Tabernacle in the wilderness as we've looked at many of those pictures then when it came to rebuild the Tabernacle Solomon's Tabernacle to rebuild that after they came back from babyon you know there the needs what was needed God supplied the needs and the people didn't have to go beg for something it was God revealing to them what was already in their possession that's the scripture when when God came to Moses he didn't he didn't ask Moses go find a good rod and this is how the rod has to be but he said what is that in thine hand and that's the same thing when the Holy Spirit you get in his presence he asked what is that in your life what is that longing where you've always had a longing where you couldn't fit in here there was something calling you to more truth what is that in thine hand what is that in your life amen and in the Shina glor Glory it reveals this is why that you could never fit in anywhere else this is why you were different as far as this were like any other flesh but what was it that within us that we just couldn't yoke up with anything else I'll tell you why it was that part of himself that's right that's exactly why and let us always remember that let that always be in our mind that that you know I'm not my own I I'm not it's not about me it's about him he's my Redeemer I want you to think of how the keeping this reality that what God has given to us I want you to watch how brother Bram says this in the message dedication he says if this church he's talking about the one he's dedicating if it only had 12 he's referring back to the the the Church of Ephesus which only had 12 people in it I like that church and completely surrendered to God he can do more with that 12 than he could with the rest of the world it's the surrender that we have where the truth of the Gospel not only goes from the platform but Finds Its bed in the hearts of the people and reacts back that's the key it's the surrender we have you know we don't want the word to roll off of us we want to absorb it God I I want my life to be a in a in a place to absorb I you know know even that it isn't that I have to remember every single detail when I come out of service because it isn't about so much my mind but Lord let me stay here like like that of a negative in the oldtime cameras that you could open them up in a night field and they would collect the light as it was coming upon the negative let my life oh God let me absorb what it is of your presence right here tonight Lord let me absorb that Lord yes your desire yes sir you know you're built to absorb that as a son and daughter of God absolutely is that right you're built to absorb that when the word of God is being preached the word of God is a place listen God did not send this message that it would just somewhere fall somewhere else you were the intended target you are the intended betting ground you are the one that he had in mind you are the one the wound that he chose to bring forth His Image through you are his desire and his desire is to see himself reflected in you and I thank you Lord It's the surrender we have that's that's the whole that's the key to all the victory in our life is the surrender and let as as David said let him keep this in the imagination of their thoughts and I I'll say it like this that's a battle but always let us remember we belong to him let me read you a few scriptures here in Psalms 103 know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves you did not make yourselves listen even in the natural it was not you going up to a value menu and saying I want this eye color this no shape you did not choose that you had no choosing even in your coming here to this Earth but God in his grace his presence moves over your life and it moves upon something of himself in our life and then as that surrender it brings us to a place of not what I can do but God the revelation of his very mind begins to break upon our life and his love coming forth it brings forth the surrender and then it is him that has made us and not ourselves we are his workmanship we never we never became Christians on a certain day we were always Christians the prophet said in future home he said we were always saved you have just come now to recognize it amen is that right so then we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture once I have been redeemed I may have I here I am in the Shell of a Browning I've got I've got traits of a Browning Browns all the all the southers all the names we could go on down I've got all of that but when once that Soul has been redeemed that's my identity is a Son of God is a daughter of God I I don't want that identity of a fallen Identity or to take the way that the brownings have taken the southers have taken and all the rest of you can put your last name in it cuz there ain't nobody above nobody else it's got to be something on the inside of us that's that's what's different that's the real gold of almighty God Titus 2:14 who gave himself aren't you glad for that that he might redeem us that we belong to him always from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zelous of good works you know when God's desire it moves begins to move on your heart and he moves in your life you know what it pulsates in your life is a desire to walk pleasing to him it's not you listen it's not you performing The Works it's your faith in a finished work that causes you to walk contrary to your own thinking that causes you to walk contrary to the way you used to walk that is Works being manifest of the faith that's in your life remember they thought Abraham was crazy because Abraham had a vision Abraham had a vision he had heard what God had said but one day the evidence was there one day everybody else could see what Abraham heard are you hearing me he walked by that Vision what caused him to act this way make these payments on the baby Bill what caused him to navigate through all unbelief what caused him to repent when the word came to correct him because he had heard from God and anytime there was something in his life that didn't meet up with what God had called and God revealed he quickly stepped back in line by the grace of God and then why is that what he had heard one day you saw amen amen zelus of good works the scripture we read from last week know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own I this a question for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods now think of this what God has come to redeem is that soul and from the Redemption of the Soul it ties you in you have a reservation for the Rapture you have the token for the Rapture you have the already received the earnest down payment that will lead you to the very change of the body it it will be your Soul uh kind lining up then with the theophany and a glorified body that's so good yes sir but in the meantime this is where we have to walk with that realization he's redeemed me I'm not a slave I'm I'm I'm a I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ yes amen yeah I could do I could do I can do what I want to do but as Paul said in multiple places in Corinthians there's things that I don't want to if anything takes away from the counsel of God in my life everything itself is not it it does not work to the advantage in my life I I only want to do that which is pleasing to him right think of this in our body and our spirit now you might look and say well once he's redeemed you know because brother Braham said it like this he said you know he said if I never preach another sermon he said I'm saved right right I'm saved but you see here's the pairs the powerful thing is that there's another place in the scripture to show you how much of a responsibility that God has usted you and I with it says that every one of us must appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that's not the white Throne judgment but appear before the Judgment seat of Christ to give an answer for the Deeds that were done in the body I tell you I don't want to stand there that day and God said you know you are mine but you you were a troublemaker buddy I don't want to stand there on that day I don't want to stand there I don't believe anybody wants to stand there in that time you know to stand there in where he would say there listen friend this is not the white Throne judgment this is that which belongeth to the Believers I don't want to stand there and say you know what you could have been so much more of an asset to your church but instead you cause trouble you you you are you could have been so much more I don't want I don't want to stand there on a day listen let me just be very clear this is the time when rewards are handed out I'm not interested in rewards I Don't Got My Mind Set On A Certain reward there's one thing that I have my desire set on and that's the change of the body the Rapture means everything to me I don't want to stay here and the Rapture even on a daily basis I don't want to stay in the condition of this realm that's what means everything remember the prophet said it'll take perfect love to get there that's right right it's good to that that's what it'll take I say oh God you know listen friends let the love of God so move in your heart and Lord bring out a real completion in my life a full maturing Lord I'm moving right into the adoption because remember the prophet over and over we're living in the time of the adoption this is the adoption message this is the message that leads to Sons and Daughters of God coming into adoption there's no other word that can bring that it's an end time Revelation where Christ himself has revealed himself as the mighty conqueror why to call Sons and Daughters into full adoption no other age had a mount Transfiguration experience this is the age of Mount Transfiguration Hallelujah and the Prophet would tell us over and over what's holding up the adoption is our Behavior he would speak of those things you know of how that listen these are things always Satan is always listen his objective let me just say this his objective is always to try to thwart and hinder the expression of Christ through your life you could be offended today and dwell up in that and dwell in that and let it overtake you to where you're no longer an effective witness and there might be somebody tomorrow that needed you to be a witness and isn't necessarily what we say it's the expression of our life is that right now watch this Paul goes on to say this let me just just trying to drop this in very quickly Paul goes on to say we're not we are not debtors Brethren to the flesh I don't owe the flesh nothing that's right well you you know my feelings been hurt that's my flesh I'm not making light of that everybody understand that I'm not making light of that that's not what I'm saying because you know what I got feelings too and the Holy Ghost don't strip out your feelings the new birth comes it don't do away with that but now you've received a strength and a power to be able not just to withstand it but to bring it in line right that's what the Holy Spirit it comes to bring us into a place of a real expression and a with Jesus Christ you know what there's a growing there's a growing if you look in your life tonight and say I'm falling a little short hey it's a time to grow say thank you Lord for your grace that's how you grow you grow by first taking account in your life and saying Lord I need to grow up a little bit more there's some things I need to get a little higher you will always find in the message of the hour you will find the prophet always in humility asking God for more grace in his life always if we if we live after the flesh we'll die but if we through the spirit do mortify keep dead the Deeds of the body you shall live nothing lay down there you're dead for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God that's a key are LED we're not made to do something oh I have to do this and oh I better do this yeah I I better no that's they're still under the law but when we are LED is the desire to do what is pleasing to him though I feel the Warfare the contrary that's pulled but is to be led by the spirit of God it's not the well I tell you if I wasn't a Christian this is what I would do no no no it's to be led right amen this is where Peter said you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people you belong to somebody and you should show forth the Praises of him that hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light very very important here you have not just been called to the seven lampstands amen it is the seventh lampstand that has revealed the pathway into the Shak Glory Hallelujah that's right are you hearing me it's the it's a it's a revelation the Seven Stars in his hand it is God's illumination of his word that shows you and I the pathway well who is that that's Christ he said I am the way the truth and the life it shows us the way back into Fellowship it shows us back into relationship Into His Marvelous Light and that Marvelous Light can never be blown out sir that's right that's shakina light that's the first light that struck the Earth amen so with that in mind Christ is our absolute yes he is yes he's our absolute he's the one who's our absolute this is why you remember even we looked at the scripture last week let the peace of God rule be the Umpire in our life right I know sometimes this happens uh where you know maybe somebody in a little little game or whatever more and there they can have a hard time filling in spots and they'll ask Daddy to be the Umpire for his little boy I don't care how much Daddy says and could say I'm going to be as honest I'm not going to I'm not going to I'm going to call a strike when it's a strike and I'm going to call a foul you know if it's in basketball I'm going to call this and listen there is an affinity that Daddy has to where even in Daddy's mind you can get well I don't want to crush them you know they've struck out they've you know their their nickname is strikeout king queen I don't want to you know I don't want to offend them you see what'll happen it'll start a play in the gates of their spirit and then the Umpire is not really being a true umpire but an Umpire is one who is neutral amen it is one who stands there that no matter what it is it might only be a millimeter over the plate is that right brother Shane it's a strike you might you could argue I don't care how you want to argue but the Umpire is looking at it and saying this you know what you can fuss all you want but once the ninth inning is over I'm going home and I'm going to have me a nice Coca-Cola and you can argue all you want right an Umpire is there cuz could you imagine if you didn't have an Umpire you'd have people just you know I mean we have the kind of that chaos right now sometimes you have people you know that's arguing and bickering and you probably wouldn't get past the first inning or second inning right right it'd be like well never mind I won't say that you know it just it's that within it you know that's why there the Umpire has got to be Christ in our soul that's the peace of God if we want the peace of God let him rule in our hearts in other words he's there saying uh-uh that's not it uh-uh that's not it I want that voice to be more prevalent than my feelings yes sir is that right I want to feed that white dog that's the Umpire Christ is our absolute and what I mean by an absolute it is not just when we say the written word but remember it is word and spirit so it's the character of Jesus Christ we're talking about right that's why the prophet could say in that last quote I read to you last week and he said oh God let me hold my hands up tie his Commandments on the tie poost of my mind let my meditation be him when somebody comes to make me angry let me see Jesus when Temptation arises let let me see [Music] Jesus Hallelujah sir let the word of let the word of Christ dwell in you richly let it be the source that's what dwell means let it be the source of influence in our lives let it dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching admonishing one another in Psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord I want to just you know think of this where David has prayed God keep this in the imagination of their thoughts that everything comes of you anything that they have to offer lord it's what you have given them you know any talent you have every one of us listen let me just say this to you everybody in here has a gift I can't preach this out tonight but everybody in here had listen when you and then when you come into the body of Jesus Christ when you're into the body of Christ then Christ himself will position you that's why the prophet could say even one of the positionings even in the body of Christ as a housewife factory worker come on now it ain't just preachers it isn't just looking at something of a of a spiritual office but it is Christ himself being reflected in the position that he has for you in the body so with that in mind God let him keep this in mind what is it that there's a willingness to to re yield a willingness to surrender what God has given that's what your desire is Lord I want to be willing I want my heart to be willing if what whatever Lord if the willingness that you ask of me Lord a willingness if a willingness to let this go a willingness to let this go I want I want that kind of a willingness don't you so it's always that yielding it'll always be a really a a real self-sacrifice and so as we look at this I want to just take this thought is Imagination versus reality because when imagination you know you can imagine things to be ever so real and they're not you can actually imagine things that you think has happened and it didn't happen that's right that's right yes sir now it depends on how honest we're going to be right we we we you say Lord I'm not going to spiritualize things it's it's just I'm going to be honest with the word I want you to think about this we've all seen this picture probably most of us have this was taken in Houston right right and the Holy Spirit how the pillar of fire came down and he had his picture brother BR said taken with us and he came down and you know to me I when I look at the picture I'm not I'm not caught up with the man I thank God for brother br I thank God for the prophet of God but I realize that's that's that's where the Prophet was getting his instructions from is the pillar of fire he wasn't just pulling stuff out of thin air he wasn't making it up you see he had an absolute is that right it has an absolute that's why listen that's why the New Birth when the new birth is com in your life you've got an absolute and the prophet said when the New Birth has come to you then you become the absolute of that scripture woo it's powerful isn't it because why it's Christ not you it's Christ interpreting the absolute of his thought through your life that's yes sir that's I want you to think of this here I'm going to I'm going to read some portions out of a quote and then I'll get to some of the latter Parts here brother brand says now if you stood tonight and you looked at that angel circling there's many of you in here perhaps has never never seen it that light of Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel that come into the prison cells with Peter and delivered him from the prison this same Angel of the Lord and here it is after all those hundreds yes thousands of years is still here with us now it's had his picture taken standing where I was standing no not for me but for the church the body of Believers see it's to everyone I believe that it was actually a pillar of fire that led the children of Israel just a pillar of fire he said I actually believe that that light come into the prison where Peter was at he said don't you believe that testimony he said I believe it with all my heart just more than I believe my name is William brandom I believe that story but we have a more stricter fundamental proof of it than that we have a more stricter fundamental proof now I I believe that by faith What Now watch how he's going here what if the angel of the Lord was standing here now circling and every one of your eyes would be visualized to see it so it's circling and every one of our eyes be visualized to see it some of you remember we were here in one of that first opening nights it's been multiple times I've had it reported to me but I I remember that one night in here it was when we did the first streaming in in the covid time and that I I thought I didn't know there was only 10 of us here I didn't know what took place but you know what there was a great flash that that came that came through and in other reports but that just goes to show listen it's God still with his people because the angel of the Lord accompanies his message wherever the message is preached not man's ideas but wherever the message is preached the pillar of fire is still there to make it [Applause] real he said now what if it was here and in your eyes would become visualized to see it that would be pretty good watch this but to look at the picture of it is far more proof than what it was if you were looking at it with your eyes I want you to catch this he said this is is far more proof looking at the picture than if you were looking at it with your eyes he said because you could have an optical illusion th this right here I could preach a Month of Sundays on this quote that's camera a camera won't take an optical illusion can I just preach just a moment this is why our experience is not based upon Sensations our experience is based on the word of God Sensations will lie to you but the word of God is more sure than every sensation heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never [Applause] fail Hallelujah cameras won't take optical illusions it will take the actual picture it has to be there to strike the lens you can have optical illusions so in other words if I'm taking a picture and I say oh it was there it was there it was there but if you take the picture and it's not there then that's your imagination remember brother br's talking about this all the way through the message because many including the man who was impressed to take the picture and mind you it was the seventh negative that was developed the man that even took the picture had thought it was just things that people were imagining is that right you can have optical illusions and things that looks like it is when it's not and it could be psychology you see you you could say you see it there you see it there you ever had people you're looking at a picture and you say you see it you see you see and then all say you don't want to be like dummy yeah yeah I don't want to be left out of this yeah yeah but then everybody knows those pictures that we sometimes you see and there's hidden messages in those pictures right is that right yeah the prophet will take that example about hidden messages hidden in the hidden in the pictures like you take the FedEx truck it's an arrow in there right and the prophet will refer to that in trying to do God a service he said see that's how the message is whenever you see one of those pictures like that he said that's how it is when you see this message you can't unsee it once you've seen it you've seen it calling out every time that's the message that's the message that's the message that's the message that's Christ that's [Applause] Christ he said it could be psychology you know and you could say you see that and you just keep saying it yes I believe it and believe it so much until you actually think you see it when you don't that's psychology it's just got you so mentally pressed towards it till you just imagine it so imagine it so much till it becomes a reality isn't that incredible imagine it so so much till it becomes a reality some of you wondering wondering where am I going well I'm going to I'm staying in this quote I just read you the first little bit I'm staying right here I want you to just to think of that you could be so mentally pressed towards it till you just imagine it until it would become a reality brother Brown says it like this next paragraph you just imagine somebody hates you once and they don't hate you but you imagine they do and you just keep thinking that's the error right there keep thinking the Bible said come on cast down every imagination well they hate me but remember where word of stand is is to not allow that to take resident in our life the Bible said give no place to the devil is that right give no place that that word place means Retreat which is an excuse it tells us tear down strongholds right sometimes there's strongholds there's complexes that have been developed in our lives and certain things can be said or done and it like trigger like a flashback that's a stronghold and the enemy could even know way way way way back if I can sew this in it will always be something to we eventually that when the is coming forth they'll pull back on it but let me tell you something that's good and I'm not talking to you let me tell the devil something God is in the business of tearing down walls yes he does he had a daughter by the name of Rahab that wanted to get out of that wall City she knew the Jubilee was on she couldn't tear the walls down but God tore the walls down for her what brought those walls down her faith in in the word of God what she heard caused those walls to crumble your faith in the word of God will tear down complexes it'll tear down strongholds to where the enemy has no place to run to hallu Hallelujah That's The Power of Jesus Christ hallu they don't like me and the first thing you know watch Watch What Happens huh what's what happens the first thing you know you'll be shunning that person wait a minute my thought that they don't like me is what's causing me to act funny y I want to ask you to raise your hand we've all been there Satan will just drop a little thought so and so don't like you so and so thinks this come on friends let me just let me just let you in on a little something whether I'm preaching here or preaching other places you think the devil has not tried to come and put things and said this one's disagreeing this one's disagreeing I'm not following the devil I'm not going to follow the devil they might have a tummy ache that may be why their face looks that way I don't know I don't know I don't know what's going on maybe they got a pain in their body I don't know maybe something else is going on in their I don't know that you see you see how s would like to derail it and then take the minister off in another way and it leaves the Sheep hungry because Satan is afraid of this word getting in the batting grounds because the effect when this word comes in it has power to react back and the reaction is Christ after a while he says you're shunning that person when they haven't done nothing to you and after a while it becomes such a reality to you till you actually believe that that person doesn't like you and you might ball them out for it or say something to you brother Willie what was wrong with you the W what are you talking about what are you talking about the S my my stomach what what are you talking about oh oh I'm sorry brother I I see you're looking that way when I was making certain statements oh come on friends come on come on the devil can get right on people's shoulder he was looking right at you who do you want me to look at maybe take an arrow and divert it to hold up an arrow where do you want me to look but you see what the enemy does he's trying to divert from the real need he doesn't want the word getting to where it needs to get [Music] to and you might ball them out or say something to you for instant I'm not going to be much longer but I this is I'm burning up for instance I forgot all about it for instance your wife or your husband oh Lord or some neighbor or something like that when that person is absolutely innocent of any ill thing I won't ask husbands that have had wrong perceptions about their wife wife that's had it's quiet I'm okay with that wife that all of a sudden has had a wrong perception you know one of the worst things you can do is get in the corner and not talk to one another come on now listen friends I'm just trying to say you know what the enemy is all about putting up divisions but in order to talk somebody's got to start out with the ears yeah unless somebody else start out with the mouth and the person who's with the ears God give me Grace not to stand here as one who is defending and I'm going to lay out my argument cuz you know that won't go very far either that that won't go very far because look the thing sometimes that we perceive it seems very real right there was a lady in a in a store the one time and these shootings were going on and things like this it wasn't happen in the store at that time but all of all of a sudden this shooting and you know she hears something and all of a sudden there's this big pop that goes off and what had actually happened is is where she had fallen and this pop goes off and she thinks oh Lord Something's Happened and she reaches back and she feels what she thinks is that her brains have come out of her head and you know what it actually was was a can of biscuits that exploded and the pop and she reached back and felt that you see sometimes we we can laugh at that but how many other things friends how many other things and look you say well I I'm tell you I'm really Discerning this this is my question if we're calling it the spirit of discernment it should look like Christ act like Christ never be any different from you say what do you mean I'll tell you what I mean when it came time for the Betrayal nobody questioned Judas there had never been any actions between Jesus and Judas that would have said you know I've seen you you you know how he's kind of passed the plate around him before you've seen how he's done that he's the guy I know it right there see there was no enmity right right there was no malice you see when you let things build in your life when a wrong has even when it's a wrong that's been done you might have the actual photograph I have the photograph but if you keep that right it only affect you it'll affect everybody right you're associated with that's scripture right don't let a root of bigger bitterness springing up well they have to pay for this that's called malice malice is a desire to injure one person they've made me suffer they must suffer but like David said oh God keep this in their imaginations Lord don't let them keep in their imaginations well this brother walked right by me or this sister walked by by me maybe they had to get somewhere quickly right right maybe something like that you know what that's called giving people the benefit of the doubt every one of us want people to give the benefit of the doubt to us is that right everybody wants a pass you know when I taught school you had teachers that would hand out homework passes they would have them things man stacked up and it said pass p a s pass if you got so many things in you got a a pass and that pass meant when you had forgotten your homework well more than likely you chose I got a pass I got four more of these I can afford to just you know slide on this assignment and when it came time to hand in that assignment instead of handing in the typew written paper or handwritten paper you handed them a sheet maybe it was on blue paper pink paper yellow paper but it had pass and it looked like a ticket and you know what there was that pass was I'm not going to hold you accountable or mark this against you let me tell you something there's no greater pass than the Passover himself there's no greater pass than the Holy Spirit and this is why friends the refilling of the Holy Ghost not just to be filled with the Holy Ghost but to have a refilling that is loading your pockets with passes because we're going to have to give out passes I'm going to need passes please load your pockets because I'm going to need passes from you you're going to need passes from me I got to I got to move on here it's either captivity or Liberty right when God God speaks to Israel right here when they're coming back into the land from Babylon and he's letting them know this is what I want you to do cuz they were asking should we fast the fifth month should we do this on the seventh month and God said he let him know Zechariah 7 Zechariah 8 all the fasting you done in Babylon wasn't nothing about me it was all about you right wow that's what God told him wow and this is what he goes on to say this is what I'm asking of you because this is what caused them to be taken away you look at it we say well they rejected the word they rejected the prophets that's right the prophets were trying to to call them back to the character that God desired of them remember Israel was called yesun right that was their character the eyed to character that God saw within them and was calling them back you're not hitting the mark and they finally they kept on no you're not getting in my business you're not doing this you're not doing that and eventually from there withholding from the word they were LED away in captivity and this is where God says speak every man the truth to his neighbor in other words speak truth speak just be be honest with them brother Bill's with me and brother bill says let me tell you something You' seen this brother this brother this Hey Brother Bill let's pray for that brother instead of running them down let's pray for him instead of talking about him let's let's pray for him now now if I go away from there and say can you believe brother Bill he should be an elder and here he was he's nothing but flesh that's not an excuse but because there's something there within him it'll respond to the word that's what we need to do speak truth speak truth that's also we could go all the way through the New Testament with that how the Lord Jesus spoke on how that we're to work with one another when we see wrong execute in other words execute the Judgment of Truth and peace in your Gates and let none of you imagine in your hearts evil against his neighbor love no false oath for all these things are things that I hate sayeth the Lord wow so we got to stay Sanctified friends we got to keep Sanctified washing of Water by the word Lord listen friends let me tell you listen this is why the prophet tells us he said if you don't stay in his presence that's where you can get sticky and prickly and things catch that's the truth true this is why the scripture said let not sin therefore rain in your mortal body don't let it exercise a kingly Domin Don't Let It Rain don't let it find its place and and and find somewhere in your life yeah yeah I've seen them do this before I've seen no don't let it rain it doesn't matter if it's even true if you entertain it it will spoil your life some things we can imagine we've all been there we can think oh brother so and so maybe he hadn't responded texting uh how did I get here texting sometimes you you know there's times I have learned as a pastor it's time to call don't text because sometimes I've been misunderstood with texting texting it because you know why you don't see me you don't hear my voice you don't see the expression listen texting can never replace that person to person and sometimes that's the wisdom we have to have wait a minute this just merits in person so that it doesn't give the enemy uh things inroads to read in to it's like somebody starting out you know with a email and they tap type all in capital letters they thought we're going to make it so everybody can read it capital letters means you're yelling at them let me tell you one on my mom when my mom started texting you know she got her phone and she started texting some years ago you know these acronyms I can't even keep up with all of them now but you know my brother was telling her serious needs or you know things to pray for within you know as far as the family so and so sick and so and so's not feeling well and this and that and my mom you know after pray after that my mom was sending back bold or capital letters LOL and these were my brother got to look and he said why when I'm mentioning events like this it just doesn't seem to fit these are serious events and she's typing LOL you know what he said he said I I think I'm wondering what it is that Mom thinks that is so he text my mom this was the right way he could have got an attitude and said how could she think that way about me she's up there with Samuel and the devil right on the shoulder yeah she's right up there with Samuel doing this for him doing that for him doing that for him and look at you boy down here in Tennessee but he instead he asked her what did you mean by LOL love you lots or she said say it again what was it Kim oh lots of love lots of love lots of love that's what she thought LOL meant lots of love instead LOL laugh out loud some of you'll be laughing from now on when you send that acronym lots of love what are you saying brother Samuel that there's times we have and we will misunderstand one another that's why we need God's grace we need to live from the grace of God oh like David said God keep this in their imagination what a willingness to forgive a willingness to let go because it will only hinder you and hinder the Christ in your life this is why the scripture said love thanketh no evil the word thanketh means it doesn't keep any account of in other words let me go to my file cabinet on you cuz I've got records on you and those records date clear back to this and this and this and this and this you better be careful because you have no business tampering in the blood of Jesus Christ oh brother Samuel I've seen something that seemed like it kind of a little Glimpse that reminded me back there when they were a teenager before God ever did something in their life that's called character but when the Holy Ghost has come in their life and align them with the word that life with in them is what will mold that character and take the rough edges out of their life because you've got rough edges I've got rough edges are you with me now just CU what ends up happening is it doesn't end up hurting nobody else you see what happens is it'll hurt you because eventually it'll go to you and your family and it's just you and your family instead of setting right here you you and your wife instead of setting among a body of Believers you've got your little portion segment it's called a block of offense we're at this block of offense let me tell you there ain't going to be no blocks like that in heaven that's why those things have to get settled down here right now well brother Samuel they never asked me to forgive them they don't have to ask you to forgive them your duty as a Believer is to forgive them the scripture says over and over it says let us forgive one another even as God has forgiven us for ch Christ sake is that scripture is that scripture sometimes we hold those things for an excuse Oh Brother Willie said sorry but I'm still going to keep him in a prison remember the man who did that he begged boy I'm picking on you tonight maybe it's that red shirt you're with but you remember the boy you remember the man that came there to the king and the King said you owe me this many talents it was a lot of money and he came there and he oh no have mercy with me oh no have mercy with me I'll pay you back he went out of the presence of the king when compassion was given to him and he went over to somebody that owned him only 5 pennies and said Pay Me You servant that's scripture yeah yeah and you know what the king heard about it yes he did and the King said because of that you will be thrown into prison until you pay the uttermost farling you know what you know what payment is is surrendering it that man would have to come to a place to surrender his own will or else he would be in a prison it's like people they put on house arrest I don't care where they go there's certain things they can't do right cuz they're on house arrest if they leave the house it's monitored right why it's like of being in a prison without having bars there that's the same way friends in offense is bitterness is malice is that's the same way in imagination that's the same way that these things are it becomes an offense you might ask what does this have to do with job glad you asked because job thought that his whole suffering was his God doing it that's right that's what Satan had made him to believe he showed him so many things but job hopefully we'll get to it in sometime when job finally had a meeting with God God let him know I was with you the whole time watching over you and in the words of the Prophet I was making something out of you right the whole time so what job imagined what Satan had whispered to him was not real job had all the arguments I've read to you scriptures here now it's almost for a year I've been on this with job 23 arguments after arguments listen friends I don't want to present no arguments I don't want I don't want arguments I don't want reasons of why that oh I can't fellowship with this brother I can't F I don't want I don't want arguments amen because you know what that is when those things are held listen let me just tell you this right now the prophet said if you've got one grudge against one person you're in danger of Health fire That's How Strong this is I don't want listen I don't want to miss the Rapture for nothing every one of us I'm standing here preaching to you of things that look that I can I could look at and take of an imagination here I am in a meeting and I'm in a meeting but I'm not even on the group thread of the minister in that meeting to let me know where to go when to show up when to do that you think that the devil didn't get I'm just preaching real you think the devil didn't get on my shoulder ah you know what it is they trying to exclude you because there's certain things of way you're standing brother Samuel what did you do it could seem very real of how could have been left out I don't know when certain things are going on when to show up for certain things cuz that becomes an easy thing I could I could have taken that but you know what I look to the Lord I'm not saying this to put me up I'm saying this right here cuz it didn't mean that there's not a sting sometimes when you feel things you know how it is when you feel like you've been left out of something anybody else feel that way sometimes you felt that way but I said Lord if it was intentional then I forgive him but I don't believe it was or brother Samuel it pro no I don't know that neither am I going to use discernment to put it there because that kind of discernment listen friends I've been around that those types of things before where people oh I tell you what I know so and so what I watch is not so and so I watch the person talking to me of the so-called discernment they have and I watch how it affects in their behavior and that's how I know whether it's coming from God or not are you hearing me this is how we check it's not about somebody else it's about us examining our own lives with the word of God because let me let me just say it like this even if it would be true so what it's not worth my spirit becoming affected because the enemy knows if I can just get him affected it'll affect him when it would come time for him to minister he won't be able to be there in study and prayer it'll be upon his mind but you know what you know what that is that's not the strength of Samuel Browning that's one of those passes it's passes if there's one thing we want to have I know we don't carry change no more if there's one thing we want to have we want to have a pocket full of passes is that what your prayer is and how do we have those passes is by staying in the presence of the Holy Spirit staying Sanctified let's stand my my my watch how brother Bram says this in the message humble thyself though I understand all the mysteries of God and still though I could do it and have not charity I'm nothing I haven't gotten nowhere yet see the main thing is love God and humble yourself with it brother BR said surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know a little different about the gate to enter in at and if you want to get somewhere with God how many want to get somewhere with God I I I want to get I want to get closer to him I I want to get somewhere never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you to to me I these words when when this is wrote in this way and spoken this way I think what I think back to is when Nehemiah stood there and the gates were constructed again in the same place the wall was built up and sister Carmen those people of the land that had nothing to do with the Jews wanted to come in and sell fish on the Sabbath day and Nehemiah said you're not coming inside of these Gates and selling fish on the Sabbath day and furthermore I better not catch you around the walls of the city either you're not to be around here and Trouble the day of rest that's what the Holy Spirit comes to minister to our lives and as we abide within that abiding within that look don't don't let an arrogant spirit that means if if if this says don't let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you guess what it means an arrogant spirit will sure try to come around and it'd be like sitting out here on a night and trying to kill one mosquito and think you'll not get bit good luck there's enough mosquitoes that could pack you away what are you saying brother Samuel it'll keep coming this is where our strength is our strength is oh I'm not going to let no arrogant Spirit I'm not going to let that that's not how God brings his word but here's our strength strength is staying in his presence it makes us flexible to where we're able to yield and push things out not allowing it to reside in our life whether it's an imagination or whether it's true I don't want it there that's my brother that's my sister Lord this is part of the same body don't let No Malice come in I knew I knew because of what you did I knew that was going to happen I knew don't don't let No Malice come in no matter what anybody has done if they are say it with me WR wrong deface them I don't know how you do that on Facebook or whatever or insta slap or whatever you do if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person because you know why that's possible you don't have to go to Manards to get the material to build a complex there's Parts within our life already we come here in these other two parts it's just like material that's on the ground ready to go right it's like when they dump them at the home sites there there they are already con the things constructed the 2x4s and materials there right right you be sweet and kind remember God loved you when you were in sin I me remember that and not just when I was out there but how many times I've been wrong and he still he loved me amen and if the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he's in the wrong just pray for him and love one another I say if there's anything Lord let us have a refreshing let's have a refreshing brother brm says sanctify in prayer sanctify this little church this morning Lord sanctify every person in here with thy spirit and let the Holy Ghost come into our hearts each one of us and freshen up the spirit in them who's already opened their hearts through their self-will has denied their own will and has come to know your will remember when John was in prison when John was in prison Jesus never had to send him a book down there this is how you behave he said go tell John just stay around tell him what you see and go tell him you see this is why we need the supernatural God Among Us this is why we need the live ministering of the word this is why we need staying in prayer see everything look friendss the the minister in the word it all is to work together in our lives encouraging Our Lives it's not something that's just to well that that's my main stay and I'm this and and then my prayer life it it all works together there's things that comes out of this that then as we pray and staying staying and being in prayer meditating staying and say Lord let me keep this always let me keep this always I I don't want to keep things against a brother sister I'll tell you what we've been here been here enough you know what there's a whole there's a whole mountain of things that we could keep but you know what what good would it do us nothing nothing brother Samuel is there people that has never asked you for forgiveness yeah if you don't what they didn't have to I forgive them I forgive them you know why because it won't be them that's held in prison I'm the one who's held in prison is that right I mean there's a there's a lot I could preach with on that part of it there there's a lot of parts to that but I want to just say it in this way don't let anything we're not ignorant of Satan's devices don't let him come and spoil what God wants to do in your life don't let him creep in there you say brother Samuel how do I do this stay in his presence stay in his presence remember brother BR said when you come out of that presence he said it's like the Dew that's falling of a morning how many know like the past month man that D is so thick out there the morning you walk out there your shoes are wet and that D stays on there for a long time but you know that do you don't hear it I never heard a I heard the rain but I never heard the de but the D will just settle right down in the night and when we can get settled in his presence that do will just settle right down upon our lives and bring a real freshening in our lives Lord as far as I know any enemy that I have or whatever I I don't want I don't want one of them to miss it right I don't want nobody to miss it but time if there's somebody disagree I don't want nobody to miss it I want everyone to make it that's my heart's desire that's my prayer yes is that your prayer I want him to make it I want him to make it Lord and in the meantime I'd say tonight why can't we just rededicate ourselves if you really mean it Lord if there's anything in me if there's anything I'm harboring if there's something that I'm harboring and I'm keeping up in my spirit almost like an idol and I it keeps on coming back out Lord show me I I don't want to just say forgive me show me show me what would be holding in my life that would be holding and keeping me Lord because I want to I want to reflect you Lord is that your desire amen hallelujah oh my let's just go together in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we've had a wonderful time here together in your presence your word Lord has has went down to minister Lord into the very depths of Our Lives now Lord you never sent us a book but father you've come Lord with a visitation of your presence you've come Lord to manifest your word to our hearts Lord for the word is quick it's alive it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart dividing us under the bone from the marrow now Lord with a willingness to realize I these gates in our spirit maybe there's a life right here tonight that says Lord I realize I don't have that strength within me to actually be able to love that person the way they need to be Lord I need that love I I need that kind of love that's being spoken about because you're not calling me to mind over matter you're calling me tonight Lord to a reality that becomes framed like a picture a real substance a father as you're moving down lord through the great corridors Lord of every life and every heart father pass Lord some of the walls where it could be like fossils of hurt and memories and many things Lord that has been placed down through those walls scars wounds Lord You're the Healer you're Jehovah RFA that's one of your great attributes Lord now father as we're standing here Lord in your presence search US Lord ien asking you to search me search every one of us Lord if there's anything Lord if there's something in me I I don't want just want forgiveness for it show me Lord because I want to really repent of it Lord I don't want it a part of my life I don't want it a part of my character I don't want that Lord and you have given us a great thing called Choice the prophet tells us choice is a great thing Lord this is our choice we want your choice Lord I realize as we stand here tonight this is not something Lord that can come from just reading a book many good things that have been written but it's got a take more than a book the Bible says we need a renewing of the Holy Ghost regeneration and renewing Lord there might be lives here tonight that need a regeneration and lives Lord going along with that regeneration of that new birth they need a renewing by the Holy Spirit maybe holds Lord hurts I I don't know the complexities of it but I know know this Lord that there is nothing that's above the name of Jesus Christ I know that there's nothing but you that's more than a match for you so Lord search us tonight oh great healer granted Lord God May the wings of the dove Lord may you sweep down tonight Lord bring healing in hearts and lives Lord I pray [Music] we keep this Lord this is this is our desire this willingness to surrender it's the surrender we have your Prophet tells us that's what's the important the surrender Lord Jesus I don't want the bed of my heart taken up and portioned out for other things I don't want my spirit portioned out for other things I'm not my own I've been bought with a price so I want to glorify you in my spirit and in my body which are gods they belong to me and I belong to you so my life is to be a display of you Lord God I pray tonight may we lay Lord our hearts upon the altar anybody want to join me in that Lord I want to lay my heart my life on the altar search me Lord let the fire

realize I don't know if some of you remember this when I read it to you that before they actually go to start treating cancer patients they want to know is there any Grudge in your life Wow because they said if there's anything there the medicine won't work now if medical science is finding this out God is before Medical Science and we want that word to work cuz the word Works doesn't it the word is powerful the word works there's nothing wrong with the word it's where we say Lord just search me search me if there's anything that's hindering the word from working search it out Lord amen because that's our desire the surrender that we have amen and I'll tell you what that takes real men and women that takes real sons and daughters of God you might not think that what you could look at in your life as being a Jericho but I want you to remember Jericho taking Jericho was a life in the Holy Ghost not be not not before the Holy Ghost it was after the Holy Ghost had come AI was a journey of a life in the Holy Ghost it's the same way the Holy Spirit works with our lives we don't come into the promised land and there's just nothing to do you just sit down in the promised land no
