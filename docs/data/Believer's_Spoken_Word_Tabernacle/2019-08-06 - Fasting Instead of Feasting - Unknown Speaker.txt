everybody but I really appreciate the sacrifice and if I see in advance where there's something that comes up like this again I'll try to make you aware of well in advance because I know there's some who planned their work schedule around this so we're just trying to do that appreciate all that had got the word out and that's you just to continue to keep us in prayer Lord willing we'll be leaving there on Thursday morning meetings there Washington DC also want to remind your brother Alexander glueless will be here with us on Sunday and brother William today was a big day for brother William he graduated really really proud brother William I tell you with all these medical graduates my goodness I mean all these nurses around here and everything else and the doctor is my goodness man maybe we'll get the whole staff at Mercy converted but I just so appreciate amen what the Lord amen has done for them I know it means a lot in their lives and the Josh way and different ones that that I think for the bride you graduated too right and the radiology is that right and so we we just thank God for that and so we just it's just it's really something and I forgot about that [Applause] we had that all here coming around this year so we whether Joe Slade was in May and we we were there for that and mentioned that and I just had forgotten where the Brian I certainly apologize for that brother William we were able to be there today and so we just were just so thankful because we know the journey wasn't easy it took a lot of sacrifice you know a lot of study and things like that so well let's just turn into the word is we're there in 1st Samuel 14 and we're just going to read a few verses of Scripture and then I'll continue on when you're seated but let's start at verse 24 now the setting were reading here we're a couple weeks ago on a on a Thursday where Jonathan and his armor-bearer remember they went up and took the garrison there the Philistines and remember Jonathan was there to make he made the testimony that there is no restraint with the Lord to save whether with you know one or with many numbers themselves is not what God needs he just needs surrendered hearts so when we look at this then this is what we're going to read into here tonight is where that when the battle itself when they had defeated there of the Philistines and then now when Israel had begin to move behind what what had taken place there after Jonathan and his armor-bearer had went to the garrison and defeated those Philistines let's read in verse 24 and the men of Israel were distressed that day my what a condition to be in as an army for Saul had a jerd the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that I may be avenged on mine enemies so none of the people tasted any food and all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey upon the ground and when the people were come into the wood behold the honey dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath but Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened then answered one of the people and said the highfather straitly charged the people with an old saying cursed be the man that eateth any food this day and the people were faint then said Jonathan my father hath troubled the land see I pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a little of this honey amen may God bless you bless the ring of the word as you're being seated let's just continue on a little bit if we could here now what's what Jonathan says here in verse 30 how much more if happily the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they had found for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines and they smote the Philistines that day from McMaster a Jalan and the people were very faint notice how the scripture keeps pointing out the condition the people were in the people were faint and the people flew up on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them with the blood then they told Saul saying behold the people sinned against the Lord and that they eat with the blood remember it was not to eat the blood because the life is in the blood and he said you have transgressed roll a great stone unto me this day and Saul said disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep and slay them here and eat and sin not against the Lord in eating with the blood and all the people brought every man he has ox with him that night and slew them there and saw build an altar unto the Lord the same was the first altar that he built unto the Lord now Saul makes a decision here if you just bear with me a moment he makes he makes the decision let us go up and pursue the Philistines further and they they mentioned to Saul let us consult the Lord so God doesn't answer them and Saul's trying to figure out why is it God answering what's wrong and then there comes down a lot between the people and Saul and Jonathan love a lot falls on Saul and Jonathan then they separate Saul and Jonathan and the lot falls on Jonathan and so Jonathan was the one as we read in the beginning that had Eitan of the honey and he had tasted of it but Jonathan didn't hear what his father had said when his father gave the order for no man to eat anything until the evening so Jonathan did not hear what his father had said so remember now now that the lot has fallen on Jonathan you know Saul makes makes the statement that whoever it falls on that man's gonna die well notice how that the people want you to watch this now here you find that in verse 43 that Saul said to Jonathan when the lot had fallen on Jonathan tell me what you have done and Jonathan told him and said I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand and lo I must die and saw answer God do so and more also for thou shalt surely die Jonathan you know we could just preach here for a lot there's a lot of times where you want to be careful on the oaths you make there's another place in the scripture we don't have time to deal with it we're even one of Israel would come back in after a great battle and said I'll sacrifice the perfect the first thing that is all he ended up sacrificing one of his children so you want to be very careful on those things so now let's look at this and verse 45 what how the people rise up the people said to Saul shall Jonathan die who hath brought this great salvation in Israel god forbid as the Lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath wrought with God this day so the people rescued Jonathan that he died not now I want you to think of this and I want to just tried all this tonight just to just to maybe start in on this a little bit and the thought that just permeating over some time is fasting instead of feasting the Bible tells us in the book of Ecclesiastes that there is a time for everything and we understand that here that Saul has called for the people to go into a time of fast in the midst of battle and you don't want a fast in the midst of battle you need to be feasting or you need to be feeding so it's even at the time of discernment Paul that solve calls for this this removal or this fast and in the midst of battle and I would say to us tonight and from even from this moment forward you never in the midst of battle you never want to stop feeding now what I'm gonna deal with here I'm talking about spiritually feeding you can fast naturally you can fast and pray and that is right on with the scripture but do not do never ever forsake Horta for fast spiritually when you ought to be feasting spiritually because in the midst of that time that's when you really need to be eating now let me just say it like this we are in the midst of the greatest battle that has ever been fought it is not something that's coming it is here it it but there has been a preparation that has been made for us in there and there is a people on the earth who are feeding from the promises of God in this hour and the greatest battle ever fought it is it is such to the place it's a culmination of this hour the Bible would refer to the conditions in this hour that as it was in the days of Noah and I don't think we're in disagreement with that whatsoever the Bible says that the earth was filled with violence through them this is a very time where you you know violence we've seen it even this past weekend once again when all types of the shootings and everything that that is going on and you know people are trying to blame it on this and blame it on that the real reality is it's demon spirits that have been released and if so taken over where humanity is so yielded to them and the enemy is so blinded to people to where they're trying to address certain things and those things are not the reason at all but what it is it's spirits that is actually coming through remember the Bible says the earth was filled with violence through them so there had to the channels that was actually the data was actually set aside violence could come into the earth but just as there was people who were panels for violence to come through there was a man on earth at the time by the name of Noah that he and his life was a channel that righteousness could come through so God always has a witness there's a standard that is always present to rise up against that of the flood of the enemy so we're living in the culmination of the culmination hour that the wickedness of Solomon even as it would speak it's a it's the most deceptive time since the time of Eden and remember within the time of Eden of the deception that took place is to present to Eve that God is a great big loving God he's full of grace and yet which he is but he is also a God of his word he's a God of judgment he said what he meant and he means what he said he will stand upon that word and for those who refuse to walk in that word and recept that word judgment is coming upon them so we understand that in this hour that every demon is released against the believers in this hour it is an hour of warfare and engagement on every hand it is a time that the times of rest are few remember the Bible would talk about how that you would see the persecution the trials and so forth in the book of Acts in the Bible wouldn't go back and say then the churches had rest in Judea and roundabout there were times of trials into that those times of rest are a time that we need to be sure that we are getting refreshment from the presence of the Lord not just wiping our Brown say praise God for the grace of God that brought me through that but to understand and this is scriptural when Jesus was finished when the testing and the temptation was over God specially sent angels to minister unto him that he might be strengthened so God's got your address God knows when the trials gonna come to the end because remember the trial didn't take him by chance God himself made sure that the trial had your address if you changed addresses it got your forwarding address so that the trial arrived on your doorstep because the trial of your faith is more precious than gold but remember every trial has a beginning and every trial has a ending there's times of rest and I think that within the hour that we're living in we see that the enemy to understand he's constantly studying and he's testing his strength you know the enemy is like you know a little brother that you know he realized he can't beat the bigger brother right now so the little brother will kind of you know you know do a little bit of things and you know he'll lift a little bit or he'll do this and do that what's he trying to do he's trying to make another run at it and see now if he can actually outdo the bigger brother the enemy is always testing his strength he's coming at you and I with strength to see it is there a strength within us that is greater now it doesn't matter how many times that he's been defeated we might have got pulled a few inches but within it there's an anchor that is holding us and that is keeping us and by the grace of God there is training that has taken place in our life and is for knocked out punches so what I'm talking about is warfare I'm talking about battle because remember each and every day of our life I don't want to say we run headlong into the devil brother Ram would speak that concerning himself I would say that probably for more of us we run into the imps the the Lord the demons everyday we run into that headlong everyday now when we know when we look at this here you know even though there are times that we would fast in the body from natural food there should be there should never be a fasting spiritually we are we are to stay build up spiritually by praying by itself when you just to look at this with honey and honeycomb you realize that this is an all season and all year round but this is an specific season and here when the people of God were forbidden not to eat during this time and here they were withheld from honey and here was the honey the honey was dropping on the ground here was the honey cold it was something that all they had to do was reach down and pick it up it was there it was made available to them you know I love that I could preach on that a while to think about it that the honey itself there's times where God wants you to climb up and get things is that right but then the honey itself is speaking of that life that it God would allow it to drop to such a place he would not matter where you are at that honey can reach where you're at but in order to get the honey there's got to be a little bit of humility to reach down and pick it up and say I take this and make it mine but here you know Saul has troubled the people he doesn't realize that he's troubled the people but he is causing them to withhold from feasting - from eating and instead they're fasting and you know what wasn't what it actually did it led to the people sinning against the Lord you know I won't ask you to raise your hand but probably every one of us in here have been guilty of this at one time or another where sometimes you get to go Indian without eating food and you get maybe busy about your daily activities or you you know get lost you know with things maybe you're studying in the Word of God and before you know it you find yourself oh my I have an 8 but you begin to get other things coming around that you start getting a little irritable you know your sugar starts getting low or you start getting frustrated or antsy or you start getting nervous or other things like that you know brother good thing about it is your wife can say you know what the problem is you're hungry so you know but the time the thing of it is sometimes when we get to that place we go to start reaching for things to eat that really are not gonna be good for us at all they're not going to help us they're not gonna strengthen us it's not gonna minister sustenance to our life and you know so when we're looking at this now in a spiritual context here here the people because they were in a place of faintness they were hungry when then the battle itself had had a commence and now the people were in a place to pursue after the enemies they only could pursue a certain distance the Bible says they pursue from McMaster a Jalan but remember what Jonathan said how much more how much greater the victory would have been it wouldn't have only been something where the people would have only went part way a third of the way two-thirds of the way or half of the way but it would have been the people would have pursued the Philistines fully if they had not been faint so a real spiritual diet is important in us pursuing after the enemy defeating the enemy and seen to it that the enemy himself is chased out of our land so here you know when you look at it the the you know Jonathan states that of how greater the victory would have been but there was a faintness among the people and I think naturally you and I can relate to times when we're faint when you're weak and you don't feel like hey I don't have the energy I don't have the strength and I don't like I have this to do this but you know that in the natural but here we're talking about and applying it in the spiritual realm where in our life it you know we are constantly in moments and many of the times we're constantly being tested we're in battle there's warfare that's taking place and Anna and it's to be within a within a measure that we and ourselves are built up in the things of God and to realize it that you know it's not something that God will do for us but quite contrary the scripture admonishes us that our feeding our spiritual diet our building up is our responsibility amen so when we look at this here the people were actually withheld from the right thing and when they were withheld from the right thing and then they came upon the spoil begin to just you know killed the oxen and the Sheep and all those things it was nothing wrong with the animals what it was they were consuming it in the wrong manner they were withheld from the right thing but then they went and started consuming but they consumed what would be the right but in the wrong manner now you know brother Randall places it like this in faith is the substance he said you know he said concerning the day that we're living in people he said when they're hungry they'll eat from anywhere if children and people are starving they'll eat from a garbage can that once eat from a nice table but if they are hungry they'll eat somewhere so I think real true ministers of the gospel ought to be up and going and ought to be giving the people the right things meat in due season now that meat in due season it's not just you know teaching of the mysteries all of that has its part because to understand that God has given his word in this hour to you and I and limited let me just say this to you the seventh angel messenger whom God has sinned and vindicated with that truth it was to identify that where we are it's to identify the Living God is present and it is to announce to us the promises that concern us in this hour and to tell us to get ready for the bridegroom is coming so that is all necessary and to see these these as the Bible would say in Revelations 19 the true sayings of God that this word is coming open but also to understand that the meat of a meat in due season that there are times where there has to come correction in our life as well there's times that has to come where though with the Holy Spirit coming through the word and it brings repentance you know repentance itself isn't just something and understand this I believe in the clothesline preaching I believe that's part of the gospel but you understand repentance itself it's not just limited to that there are things within our life that when the Spirit of God is ministry we can see places in our life where we've been letting down we need to be picking up and so the repentance has taken place in our life because this is a place of checking out we want to be examined by the Holy Ghost because our desires we want to be found ready because we believe that he's coming back like he said and that is our hope that is our consolation we are looking for his coming so with that in mind this is why we need the Holy Ghost coming through the word the Holy Spirit giving direction for the hour that we're living in we do not need a man you do not let me just say it like this and bring it from me you do not need my thoughts you do not need even let me say like this you do not need even the things then maybe that God has me looking into and studying and and just saying well and we're gonna deal with this but it comes down to God knows when he opens his word what is the correct season to bring that word forth that what we need is the leadership of the Holy Spirit and you know and I would just say it like this God knows that probably you know earlier on you know when when I was ministering when I first started out you know when God gave me something to preach I just preached it you know so I was just something he gave it to me and I preached it and the inspiration it came with it but you know as time comes on and you you know that that the Holy Spirit and the word you know the word is no longer just like puzzle pieces but now you're seeing a picture it's an entire picture and now it's just simply where you're standing in saying Lord where do we need to focus on what part of the body right now where do we need to go so it's not about what do I preach it's with what that you are inspiring and laying out before me what do we have need of in this hour I think it's just how precise God is you know you know one of the brothers here just even on Sunday when I finished ministry and said you must have been walking with us and the conversation on yesterday they said because we just got done talking about that little white button but you know how many times listen that ain't me I'm not even even within that that even if I knew that what goodness would do if it's not in season it's gotta be and God brings inspiration to my heart and that inspiration sometimes brother Dave let's sit back and look at it I'll say my lord how we gonna bring all this about how's it going to come but I know if he's given the inspiration then he will bring it forth to his children because he's the one that delivers it so with that in mind we we look at this and I'm glad we got a place to come to aren't you I'm glad that we've got a place that we can come and hear the Word of God being preached the pure unadulterated word where the Holy Ghost will move and it deals with hearts and lives and it's changing us and transforming our lives so I believe with all my heart if we look in 1st Samuel chapter 21 we find the scripture here in verse 1 it says David he came to Nob - Amalek the priest and Amalek was afraid at the meeting of David remember now David has already been anointed king but David is running from Saul right Jonathan's just told him daddy means you harm and he said to him why aren't you alone and no man is with thee and David said to Amalek the priest the King have commanded me business and has said unto me let no man know anything of the business where about our Cindy and what I have commanded thee and I have appointed my servants to such in such a place now remember remember when the Lord Jesus would he was called into question there among the Pharisees and they said you know why you heal a man on the Sabbath day remember how Jesus said have you not read that David entered in and he ate that bread which that belongeth to the priest and you see Jesus is trying to get them to think that those men were so if I can say like this so confined to eyes eyes let me get it right now teas eyes and teas but they couldn't see the God inside of the world they were so concerned or confined with the print that they couldn't see and did not know the nature remember what Jesus told him he said you do not know love and mercy and that's the operation of the word the world is not operated by law or by force the word is operated by love faith worketh by love is that right now it would look like what I just read to you it would look like David was telling a lie but you gotta remember what King he's talking about he ain't talking about Saul he said the King hath amendment he David he's talking about the one that David should say thou art my King Oh God David was king of Israel but he always made sure this there is the King above the King here in Israel David was letting to know I'm about my father's business I am about my father's business so there is a need for food hmm give me five verse three give me five loaves of bread oh lord have mercy give me five loaves of bread in my hand and what there is present and the priests answer David had said there is no common bread under my hand but there is hallowed bread in other words there wasn't just bread in in his house but but the bread was handled it was a bread that was there in the in the holy place that was there you know the outer court the inner court and the holiest of holies it was there in the holy place and that's what he's saying behind the bread I don't got no common bread in my house but what I have is how old bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from women and David answered the priest and said Albert Ruth women have been kept from us about these three days since I came in and the vessels of the young men are holding oh my there's those three days three stages of God's grace come on somebody three days they had been kept and now what are they vessels that are set aside for God to move down in and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common remember what is it that made the bread holy it's where the bread resided it's the presence of God that made the bread holy and David is declaring the presence of the Lord is with us and we are with him so this bread though it would be common but yet in this vessel it is Holland oh brother sister don't you understand when we're taken in the word oh my this world that's rich this word that's the Kings word this word that's so precious and we look at our lives and say Lord me me but he says remember my presence is with you I'm coming into power and I'm bringing you with me your lives have been set aside that this word would dwell inside of you hallelujah so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread there but the shewbread that was taken from before the Lord that word Ashu bread it is the bread of his face the bread of his presence it is the brand that is the bread of God which is a nurser of the Christian life hallelujah amen where to reseed listen to me now were to receive the bread of life the manna the holy spirit into the golden Omer of our soul when it comes into the soul it'll never kink her then never becomes warming the experience is just as genuine as it was the first day but there is also a need for shubra we've got to feed on the Word of God why because as we feed on the word then we are formed into the word image now watch this here in psalms 23:5 you think david didn't know something about eating thou prepare us a table before me who does it my shepherd does it the Lord my shepherd thou prepare us a table that's a table I won't eat that aren't you that table he prepares amen he has prepared a table before me in the presence of mine enemies Oh glory be to God hallelujah you believe that when you're in the midst of the darkest of tests and trial that you can be in a time of feasting how many witnesses I got on that all around this building there are witnesses of that that in the midst of the time when it would look like conditions lend itself to gloom and you might feel gloomy here and and down you know within your spirit but yet within your soul there is a deep satisfaction and then you begin to think about the goodness of God you begin to take on the coming of the Lord and you realize that this will not always be he is my strength he is my satisfaction he is the one I worship he is what delight Ian brother let me tell you he preparing for you a table in the presence of your enemy here you are feasting on the good things of God when this old flesh said I'll just stay home I don't feel like it but the inside man says get up we're going tonight I am going to feed on the things of God beings this man says I did it's too much I really don't feel real good but the inner man says I need to hear from God and you know what the truth of the matter is the inside man actually leads the outside man to a blessing thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over brother Graham said children gets hungry if they can't find something to eat they'll eat in a garbage can but God listen this now will produce the food if they're just ready to take it and what's how he's moving through this how that ministers ought to be set aside he's dealing with how that the word is to be ministered the truth meat and due season now notice moving it into this time that there is a place that is provided for you and I that would God will produce the food if we're ready to take it now watch this in Psalms 104 verse 1 bless the Lord O my soul O Lord my god thou art very great thou art clothed with honor and Majesty now skipping a few verses who maketh his angels spirits his ministers of flaming fire David being a part of the Old Testament he still recognized that there were ministers because remember David's a believer are you with me David knows that his great brake brake brake brake brake brake brake brake granddaddy abraham believed in preachers normal help me now because paul picked it up in galatians and said god seeing and that the heathen would be justified preached unto abraham body is a preacher now you may not have an apostle prophet teacher any of that gift in your life but you understand me your life allows god a platform my mama God can be right there on the job he takes the platform in your life hey ma'am there's a text that is taken in your life and the Holy Spirit will actually exhibit and show forth the witness of life that causes thirst oh this is what David recognized who maketh his angels spirits his ministers a flame of fire what are they for what are the ministers for why what is this what is this set aside for remember Paul picks it up and says they are to minister unto those who are heirs of salvation servants is that right now watch this oh I love this in verse 14 look how David picks this up talking about bless the Lord O my soul he he calls it the grass to grow for the cattle and herb that's vegetation for the service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth well you get steak out of cattle and I don't really care what what cut you're thinking about right now whether it's ribeye sirloin filet mignon or whatever it is that you're thinking about right now if that cow don't eat you are not going to be knit you don't end up at some fast-food place that we won't call the name up but that cow's gotta eat right you know and this is just talking about you know we want the cows that are not shot with antibiotics we want grass-fed cows that's natural right we're not getting into that but you understand people are looking at you know there's an importance of what I'm eating what has that didn't eat don't go home and look at your labels tonight under you might may not be able to sleep he calls it he de who does the lord cosa the grass to grow he knows the cattle needs grass and he causes the grass to grow whether you might water it you might fertilize it you might do everything else but it is not that that makes it to grow there's a germ within that grass when the conditions are right the grass will grow and he make herb for the service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth and lying that make us glad the heart of man and oil to make his face to shine and bread which strengtheneth man's heart I want you to think about this how all the processes had to go through in order for these things to be eat enough in order for you and ad to eat certain fruits you say well it's an apple tree it's going to grow apples it won't unless it's been pollinated you with me well it'll just grow tomatoes no it's got to be pollinated that's why you get flowers flowers are not for what we look at flowers at home that's so beautiful hold that apple tree in the spring oh my look at those bosses those blossoms are not there for you to admire those blossoms are there and what is to come out of that is there's going to come forth the fruit that will conceal a seed that has alive that is the same life that's in that tree it's a thing all it's a process of reproducing itself are you with me now so to think of the process you and I were not out there and saying well come on bees bees come on come on come on bees bees come on I need you to come over here this this tree and then listen there's what I need you to do I need you to go from this flower to this flower I need you to get in here you know to this pistol I need you to prove into this I need you to do that you don't have to do that it's within bees to do that bees are living creatures that know how to bring germination they themselves don't do it you know just that they're the ones that as far as they know what they're doing they're just in there getting the nectar but as they're rubbing around all that stuff is coming off of them don't you understand what I mean it takes living creatures to cause life to pass think with me scripturally now God said I'm calling you to a land flowing with milk and honey what was he let them know this is a land of living creatures the lion hallelujah the ox the man the Eagle the presence of God is here in this land that's what God was letting them know they're bees that pollinate hallelujah that grass can grow the cattle can grow God's let them know I've got all of this taken care of and on top of that job said I've got oil I got one that'll make your glow you're glad make your heart glad in that something godly ones just thinking of our food but he said I want to make your heart glad sometimes you see people walking around so sad but you see you get to drinking home this wine let drink on that one and let that one move within your life brother he it takes sadness away I'm not saying they're not times where things were down but you got you understand what I'm saying it depends on what you're drinking amen if what your drink is not strong enough get a hundred proof wine get some wine that's gonna put some joy down on the inside amen drink some of that wine Oh mom before you know it you lose track of yourself hallelujah it's a complete cycle that's what I want you to see in in Psalms 104 look how God even mentioned this in Ezekiel 20 verse 6 in the day that I lifted up my hand unto them to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out or is spied for them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands I'm telling you where we are living is the glory of all ants I'm not talking about this nation I'm talking about in the Holy Ghost in cries and the promises of the sound this is the glory of all lands what's the same process in Revelations 10 verse 8 this is after the seventh angel has sounded forth and the voice which I heard from Earth not in what it said but the voice I heard from heaven spake unto me again see it's so important that we're not just hearing an earthly voice because of all you hear is an earthly voice then there's no continuation but it wasn't an earthly voice it's a heavenly voice come on somebody amen and the which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey let me just tell you something there are supplied digestive juices there within that seed that God placed within you and when it has been quickened there it has the ability to digest and bring that word from word to flesh and I took the little book out of the Angels hand talking about the mighty angel I took it out of his hands and I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter how many know the hard part isn't saying Amen to it the hard part about is dying daily yes sir my belly was bitter you know you go to a restaurant oh my oh look at those rolls smell that yeast that cinnamon butter oh my and that steak and you go ahead and eat it and then after you get done eating it yeah ha ha ha I too much I shouldn't hate all that South line you'll do the same thing again 400 them too much but notice this he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings mmm-hmm hey man now I want you to watch this this cop here just a moment hear the word again was used twice is that right that word again is a word here in the Greek it means the idea of a Silla Tory repetition and what that of a Silla Tory repetition is a circuit it's like that of an electrical circuit it keeps on it comes from the source and it comes right back to the source that's sending it it keeps on coming it keeps on moving in that way you see the word of God it's not something that is just sown in our hearts and we say well praise God I got that I understand that no the only way we understand it is when it brings forth in our life and when it brings forth in our life then here we are actually even not just by hearing it but by doing the Word of God we are living from that word that word is becoming manifest in our life but remember every word is a seed and it brings forth a crop so in the crop comes forth we eat but then we eat to have strength to sew back what we have received and when you sew it back then what happens more comes from what your soul it's not a diminishing of the things of God it is an increasing it's an abounding that's why when you can look at it especially even the older ones or anybody been serving the Lord for any length of time you can look at and say mind you know I don't know what it is but you know just right now it just seems like the word is it's more clear it's more precious to me it's more well that's that's how the word should be what is it it's because of that of Silla Tory repetition it's been taken in it's been digested you've had to die to it but then the word has been sown back and the word is becoming greater and greater and greater and greater why because you saw it back you harvested and eat of and that's why the things that we are hearing that the Spirit of God not man is bringing to you and I it shows even where the maturity is at from the seed that's been received and so bad and has been tended to harvested ain't so bad you see it is a repetition that's why I rejoices my heart when I see young ones coming in or when I see souls coming in why it's the effect of the word that has been received not just preached not just preached it's got to fall into good ground then what does it do you take of it eat of it and so back into the earth hello glory be to God well that's exactly the way that the rapture is going to be you see this is why praying for the services is so important and this is where let me just let me just say oh I just just trying to really lay here in these moments just real teach and I want you understand just just laying it in to where the rubber meets the road Amen like baloney in the lunch box you take it with you apply to your life it's why praying for services the enemy will try to fight everything he can you know that before even coming to service and even today and I I know where you go through a work week and you know you don't come out of work today but you understand what I'm saying even your sacrifice of even you praying and you may not have but a smidge it's worth of time but you say Lord you know my heart and then throughout the day you're praying in your heart you know the Bible it says pray always is that right praying always amen so here we want to pray for the services and say the Lord would you come down and minister to our needs those needs that you see and you know about wood and there's needs on our hearts in this service we're gonna set and we're going to pray in our hearts while the word is coming forth and expect God to come to our tent door closed he promised it his coming is not a chance it's a promise he said wherever two or three are gathered together I will be in your midst is that right he told Abraham the previous chapter I'll visit Sarah according to the time of life in this coming year so Abraham was sitting in the tent door wait I wonder how many fellas he saw go by no doubt a lot but there was something about this one why was he sat in the tent door because God had already told him he's coming God said I'm coming with a message I'm coming with a message I'm coming with a message gets her as well Abraham said I'll be waiting after he stopped laughing after he got over the even Layton so in the service we're gonna be expecting and praying while we're listening and feeding on the Word of God this is why brother Branham would talk about how you know in every aspect of the service it talks about the song service how the song service its create an atmosphere of worship now I just say it like this and I don't make no apologies and nobody but you know what we may not worship like other people do and that's fine as long as other people don't want to try to take the way that they do it and try to apply it here I do not want a pattern after Branum Tabernacle sorry that's not my objective I want a pattern after the leadership of the Holy Spirit amen brother Branham gave direction there are things that he put down and you all know this some of you are older you understand and know this this has seemed like it's been a battle through the ages we're people people not ungrounded and not having discernment get a hold of the church order and what they want to do they want to make sure everything's so cut-and-dry they want God to come according to how they want God to come and how they think he ought to come brother sister that's not God that's an idol you've got people that have all kinds of things drawn up well brother Branham did this from another end that would you there did you meet him well no I have just listened escaped but not just this unjust that so you don't know and you weren't there and your call you're creating all of this that's called an idol you don't know but there are listen what is the whole preface or what is the whole principle that was laid down that Christ is to be the exalted one the one who has lifted up all of our worship everything is to point to him it's to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ the ministering of the word is to glorify Him and if that's our focus then I'll tell you what there'll be a lot of things where people will see the similarities but what they'll see the similarities is that Jesus Christ is the focus and I hope that don't miss thing you a little bit but you know where I stand on it because there's a lot of things that people can look at in this like I told you the other day there's people can look at things and they'll call they'll say things and I'm an under one I really want to go into it they'll say all sorts of things and what it is they're reading quotes without discernment of the Spirit if you've got any little bit of emotion in your worship your Pentecostal what is that lack of discernment reading the quotes well the real truth of it is in my sting and say outs or no man but the real thing that would help a whole lot of people if they would just get under a godly pastor who's filled with the Holy Ghost who can take the word balance that were not the man but there's a gift in his life that would help them so they're not unrest and unstable and wandering around and wobbling around God makes you to be in position I'm not here to preach on all those things but I'll tell you you know this is what we stand for this is what we believe we believe in genuine worship if somebody believes and says we'll always should sing is the only belief songbook brother branham never said that you said that when brother brems said we ought to sing old-fashioned hymns you understand what he's talking about it's words it's songs that have meaning to them not make a tradition that every church has gotta have a hymnal and the only songs we can sing or out of a hymnal and it's kind of come out of and only believe songbook man has done that not the Holy Ghost I'm not against nobody I love everybody but if that's how somebody believes then maybe this thing to church for you because I'm gonna sing I believe he's coming back like he said I'm gonna sing he's away maker because I know him to be away maker are you with me you see this is where it takes discernment it's not just taking quotes about drums and this and that and going and playing then it's Clemen and held those things out there loosely it's about having real spiritual discernment this is an our friends where spiritual discernment is necessary I mean my lord you'd have to get rid of the whole Book of Psalms then I'm not you understand I am not upset at the least a little bit but I want you to understand worship itself you don't know how that worship service is gonna go I mean it might be you know it is well with my soul it might lead into further along and then you come on Sunday morning and here they are by and by when the morning comes why because just as much as God leads the minister he's gonna lead the song leader I want people to feel free I want people to worship that listen that doesn't mean that I put a stamp on everything there's things that maybe have been sung and I said nope no more there's things that I believe I believe it ought to be a holiness within our worship I believe there ought to bring the presence of God now let me just tell you something as much as a person could be judgmental about music and songs or whatever more let me tell you something a critical resentful spirit will keep the Holy Ghost out of the meeting are you with me critical spirits are dangerous friend because all it is it becomes a pool for other spirits to come to Hey when brother Randall when they were Devils being cast down remember where do those epileptic demons go they went to those who were being year Everett you know how it is you might go to a church and I might go visit to a different church when you go to a different Church you remember every Church he is sovereign how did we get here every Church is sovereign when I go somewhere hey listen if they believe in singing standing on your feet the whole service what are you gonna be doing how stand on my feet the whole service and if so all of the atmosphere is sent right so then when the minister comes out brother Ram said when a minister walks into a congregation of people praying in the anointing of the Spirit you're bound to hear from Hitler that's just all there's no way to keep from it look at this in proverbs 31 now what's what's what's what's how the Lord has taken us here he's bringing it on down even to a responsibility for the food that were to partake of there's a responsibility that Minister has congregation has are you with me now watch this proverbs 31:10 who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life who can find a virtuous now this is speaking of the bride of Jesus Christ now watch this in verse 14 she is like the merchants ships what do merchant ships bring goods where do they bring goods from from an unseen shoreline they bring it from distant shores to a destined sure she is like this is what she's likened unto merchants ships now how'd you hit that wonderful not just a merchant ship but merchants ships this is what she's like why because remember she don't just have pastors she'd got evangelist come on somebody she consist I'm using the words of the Prophet she consists of and he goes through the five ministerial offices she consists of nine spiritual gift she does listen you're a part of that it's not something lesson that the Ministry appear in this and no it's all together when it says she is is talking about all of us amen we are loaded with precious cargo whoo the merchant ships are coming where they coming from Oh they've been over there visiting Tyree they got gold with them whoa I see that merchant ship what's that one oh that's got the filet mignon on it it suggested just a second no it's loaded with filet mignon what's that one oh that's got rice on it who's got potatoes on it I know I'm simple but you God God just uses my simple little humanity I have to try to get a point across I wish I had better examples but you can tell what I like and God just happens to use that so he has a real sense of humor so to think of this it's lacking unto merchant ships that brother just wait you can't see you don't see the shore where that merchant ship was but that ship had to make the journey to a distant Shore that you can't see and that had to be a purchase made and there had to be a cargo placed on there and then there that ship comes back with that cargo that ship has an ordained port let me tell you something God has all of this orchestrated he knows where he's directing the merchant ships he knows where the docks and the chapters and the verses and what is to be loaded in there he knows the inspiration striking here and the message that he's given of how this will stand the house and this will stand out and what does he do he loads up the merchant ship and says head on back there oh my it comes into Shore and what does it do it deposits those heavenly Goods not in a warehouse it deposits it in living Tabernacles oh this one right here okay it goes right here oh this one right here goes right here oh this one right here it goes right here and you all kind of service dock that was just for me tonight somebody else come look that was just for me tonight you know what it was there was packages with your name on it in the merchant ship and you believed it you expected it you were praying for it and that's why it could work that's why there was a merchant ship going to an unseen force because you're praying you got needs you've got desires and God brings it in God sends it back club brings a tear drop sends it back you understand what I'm saying I'm going like this but actually it's ascending and descending upon Jacob's Ladder [Applause] she bringeth her food from afar glory be to God amen it comes from with heavenly places hallelujah and you know what it is honey that's in due season it's spirits of food in due season we're in the midst of the battle and here we are Oh Lord God I'm coming to your house tonight or here you are you're coming in on the next day and here you say Lord I'm believing it they said and ain't no ships on the horizon but Lord you never fail to meet my need you've always come Lord God you never disappoint Lord I'm in the midst of a trowel Lord I need a touch from You Lord they look out there no ships here but Lord you always meet us and about the time as you're right here they might look out there and say I don't see a merchant ship but something in your heart says he will be here he's got goods that are for me precious cargo that he has had laid in from me verse 15 can I have just a couple more minutes let me just try to close out this scripture here she rises notice how the scripture said she rises why her light has come she rises she has strength to rise when the Sun Goes Down the moon rises she Rises also while it is yet night the church ages the time of night a time of darkness the church is to shine in the absence of the Son of God are you with me and he is walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he is our life he is our illumination he is our all at all we are vines of the brand we are branches of the vine amen we are declaring the moon she rises and while it is yet night oh it's darkness of night but she rises up and what does she do she gives him meat to her household in the midst of darkness but yet here she is giving me to her household aren't you glad to be part of the household of faith Abraham's household amen Abraham's seed amen there's meat provided for you and I amen there has been food that has been stored up and the same Holy Ghost that stored it up is the same Holy Ghost that's revealing it and giving out that word just as we have need of it what is she she rises up and a portion to her maids you know what it is she's a faithful steward she is giving out a food to sustain her household through the darkness it's a darkness that can be felt there's demonic oppression and spirits everywhere but she rises in the midst when she could cave him she could give him she could lay down but there's a power within her that she can't lay down it's a power that rise raises up and she gives meat in due season you realize your prayers is what brings him on the scene he comes on the scene but to think about it you can come to a service and what it does to your heart as a believer it just just something for you as he shows up and begins to minister to his children let me just tell you something as a pastor sometimes I can set and I look at things and maybe somebody's singing a special or here they are entering into the word and you see what's going on I'll tell your brother they might have every bit of right to just coward the hell and lay down but in the midst of the time here they are they're lending their lives as a sacrifice and you watch the Prince of God come right down and begin to move down upon that life why it invites the presence of God for he dwells in the praises of his people she's like Ruth she goes out and gets handfuls of purpose seeing just gleaning in any field brother she's in Boaz's field she's in the kinsman's field come on the help she looked up and saw him coming he came and said I find no fault in you there's a blood that speaketh for you that speak of better things they met a word that is able to transform her from a mower batters to a daughter of God to a princess of God to one in the very Kings lineage what did that the very presence of Almighty God she's dwelling in his field giving out portions that are needed and brother this ain't denominational food this is the food of Boaz himself shion askin can I pass it out can I give it out can I live it out can I preach it she knows her god-given Authority because the word has directed her Allen hallelujah say hallelujah no fasting spiritually when we ought to be feasting so the Horde I'm not going fast I'm not going fast spiritually I'm or feast now I don't have time to keep you here longer tonight but you realize a feast is something you can take one Scripture you read that one Scripture you start your day off you pray you might so brother Sam to mine my prayer times later and evening that's fine but you start that day off with just one Scripture you pray you watch what happens you've opened up a visitation for the day you've just put as it were out on Israel where they would put that on the door you just put a welcome for him to come by where he can come by and stop by and in me you'll find while you're working you'll find things are all of a sudden the presence of God just starts to connect things you've been listening to in the message messages begin to come you know things you've been hearing weather here and human listening in ministry and hears things begin to coming and you think my lord all I did was just read one scripture it's not the quantity you gave quality you gave yourself just one scripture and when you read that one scripture you just say let's just close here tonight I trust us a benefit to our hearts what a water responsibility that it gives to us I mean I feel greatly charged I feel greatly a great responsibility on me and I have felt that I don't want to come here and just I don't come up here just to get words I don't look for things let me see what I can say it's Lord what's your will I've got a responsibility I've got a responsibility so also not to bring edification to bring correction sometimes the correction isn't just here sometimes the correction is in there from the office I've got the responsible I feel that burden I need your prayers but I want you to also see how the Holy Spirit was bringing it to us tonight we're all right we all are working for one purpose and one goal this service tonight let me just put it to you if you hadn't been here the walls wouldn't have been receiving nothing it has been you know didn't really really had just been ricocheting off walls but God knew you were gonna be here and me too I got one finger here but look how many fingers I got coming back here it's together she is like a merchant ship I want to be in prayer say Lord come by your presence bring your word visit our hearts deal with our lives and expect him to come in I trusted who had what's been said tonight I trust you don't have no misunderstandings you know but you most many of you have been here long enough you know my heart you know where we stand on things you know my heart we want what we our desire is at all times we want the presence of God to have Liberty here you'll always do everything in decency in order and when it's not he will bring correction I think probably correction how probably done more correction behind closed doors then probably what our just as much as what has come across the pulpit but sometimes that's how God directs it I don't get to choose that he does but I'm glad you understand what I'm saying correction itself is not joyous but god knows what we have Nina and we want to want to be something to wear it maybe a visitor or somebody could come in here not just a visitor but I want it to be a place that brother Dave if you're going through something that even though here you are you're part of that merchant ship you're part of where there's a run being made that day you know brother herb like those runs you'd make for those washers you'd run over to Cleveland run down to Kentucky they would be down there in Kentucky waiting on you to unload that van and buy everything out that you had you made a run up there and delivered that stuff do you realize brother and sister you're praying you're giving yourself to the Lord do you know what you're doing you're running a merchant ship you're praying and that ship is moving and here you are you're praying through the week and you just know hey I'm just here as a believer priest I'm standing right in there's some very as a run being made oh it might be dangerous waters there might be storms you're going through in that merchant ship where the storms the waves are rocking it it just feels like you're about ready to get motion sickness and it's rocking you but here in the midst of it there's a merchant ship that's making a run and here the Prince of God he moves down to deposit the cargo and here the merchant ship comes in and then you begin to see God moving for hearts and lives and moving on your life you see go lord thank you lord for your direction Lord thank you Lord God for providing Lord for our needs because though we are many members we are one body they love him tonight let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer or Jesus we sure do love you sure to appreciate you lord what what loving-kindness how you Lord display water responsibility we we do not want to be found like saw or saw was forbidding the people to eat I certainly Lord I I don't want to be I don't want to fall or move into that I want to stand as a faithful minister giving heed in order to your word that you've sent to us in this hour it's Paul would tell Timothy to be nourished up in these things give thyself wholly to them you might save thyself and the others who hear thee and Lord I I feel tonight in the Lord is just as the pastor of this assembly but I feel Lord God as a part a part of this assembly as a pastor that God part of the merchant ships nor that are running Lord God we want your presence your word or God to be at liberty and to move among us Lord there's the desire that we have and that's that's for you to be lifted up we want you to be glorified Lord God we we take the counsel all mine what counsel you've given us Lord God through your word through the message Lord that you have sent to us in this our great great counsel for our lives Lord we give ourselves Lord that father in these services and I say this Lord that whether I'm the one standing behind this sacred desk or I'm sitting Lord we want to be fed we want to be fed we want to receive Lord from you so help us Lord to be a faithful virtuous woman Lord in prayer giving ourselves to the word O Lord to know that many times and it's how it is it's Lord there's runs of a ship that's being made outside of services Lord sometimes their ships that come in on a Thursday night and sometimes the Lord their ships that come in on Sundays sometimes they don't always the same ships don't always come on Sunday or on Thursday but every time you provide what we have needeth what we want to just be faithful in our post of duty faithful Lord praying giving ourselves to to the reading of the word of God listening Lord to the message that you have sent to us Lord fellows shipping with brothers and sisters of like precious faith not forsaking to assemble ourselves together all of these all of these great admissions are a part of the merchant ships it's a part of rising up in the night when it would be so easy the night is a time that of darkness of pressure a time where it's where people would sleep but we realize why it's darkness to the world but light has come and we must work while it's day for the night cometh when no man can work we must be faithful Lord providing meat to the household in due season portion to the maidens help us lord I pray help God every father every mother every husband wife help each and every one Lord we pray God may we each Lord work with the burden of the Lord upon our hearts Lord we may never know till we get to the other side of the effects of Lord God the praying the fasting
