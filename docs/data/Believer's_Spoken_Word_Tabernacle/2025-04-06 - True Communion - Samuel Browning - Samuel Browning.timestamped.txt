[42:05] us, how he's provided for us.
[42:08] Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer.
[42:11] Heavenly
[42:13] Father, truly Lord, from our
[42:18] hearts, Lord, coming through the very
[42:21] corridors of our
[42:23] mouth is worthy as the
[42:25] lamb. Our
[42:27] lives, Lord, are
[42:30] trophies of your grace, Lord.
[42:34] Lord Jesus, worthy is the lamb.
[42:38] Oh God,
[42:41] our hearts, our lives, Lord, are it's an
[42:44] insign in this hour. the living God
[42:48] living behind flesh. Oh God,
[42:53] testifying of the
[42:55] victory, testifying, Lord, that in every
[42:59] situation, in every
[43:01] life, that you're the mighty conqueror.
[43:05] No matter where our lives were at, no
[43:07] matter what
[43:09] situation behind Lord, you coming and
[43:13] moving in behind our lives. Yeah. You
[43:16] prove you're the mighty conqueror.
[43:20] And Lord
[43:22] Jesus, no matter Lord, if we never had
[43:26] any seemingly mark against us, maybe we
[43:29] our lives would have seemed Lord as
[43:31] though maybe perhaps Lord a finger
[43:33] couldn't be placed on
[43:35] it. But Lord, we were still guilty.
[43:40] Lord Jesus, under that first birth,
[43:43] hallelujah. But oh God, You came, Lord,
[43:48] that Father, you might raise your own
[43:51] life inside of us, Lord. That that life,
[43:54] oh God, that that first nature, our
[43:57] first birth, we came here, Lord, into
[43:59] this world as Job would write of it.
[44:02] David would express of it. We came here,
[44:05] Lord, with that worldly nature, Lord.
[44:08] But oh God, how that you move down and
[44:12] you begin to brood upon our hearts,
[44:15] Lord, to bring forth what you knew lay
[44:19] beneath this darkness,
[44:22] Lord. Oh God, you wrote even in Genesis
[44:25] 1, the story of our lives, Lord. Oh God,
[44:30] we're thankful, Lord. The only thing
[44:32] that we can say from our hearts is thank
[44:35] you for the grace of God. Yes. For grace
[44:40] hath taught my heart to fear. Grace hath
[44:42] brought me safe this far. Grace of God
[44:44] has changed my life. And the grace of
[44:46] God will lead me safely home.
[44:51] Thank you, Lord, for your grace, Lord.
[44:54] Thank you for your mercy, Lord.
[44:57] Oh Jesus, we love you, Lord. We love
[45:00] you, Lord. We love you.
[45:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[45:10] Thank you, Lord.
[45:13] I pray heavenly father. Bless your name,
[45:16] Lord. May you just, Lord, in this moment
[45:19] that we have to come
[45:21] together to take communion, footwashing.
[45:25] Lord, I pray that God, you'll just so
[45:28] bless each and every one of us as your
[45:31] children.
[45:33] May Lord as the word is going forth this
[45:35] morning I'm asking that you would just
[45:38] guide and direct me Lord
[45:41] Lord help me to get out of the
[45:45] way let it just be Lord we want to hear
[45:48] from you that's what we we need to hear
[45:50] from you so Lord I just want to give
[45:54] myself and this congregation together
[45:57] may we be delivered together into your
[45:59] hands
[46:01] Lord have your way Lord we
[46:04] pray in Jesus precious name.
[46:08] Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning.
[46:11] Amen. If we could let's turn to 1
[46:14] Corinthians chapter
[46:19] 10 and
[46:25] um I want to mention those of you that
[46:28] had ordered uh books. um the church age
[46:33] books and the seals. What we have down
[46:35] on those of you that had marked what you
[46:38] wanted ordered uh back there in the
[46:42] um the office next to mine there my wife
[46:46] and they can they can help you uh get
[46:49] the books. They'll be there to hand them
[46:51] out and then there are extras that we
[46:53] have but I I want to just try to get on
[46:56] get those on the list right now. get
[46:58] that passed out and then anyone that
[47:00] would want one then, you know, just uh
[47:03] email, text or make a comment, they can
[47:05] write it down and then we can get it
[47:07] from there. So, we did I did try to get
[47:08] some extras. And so, also um the the
[47:13] little yellow booklets, the resume of
[47:15] the church ages um that was supposed to
[47:18] be sent and there's just there's extra
[47:21] things that I bought that was beyond
[47:24] um because uh just seeing the need for
[47:27] witnessing uh here and that resume or
[47:30] that little yellow book is a very good
[47:32] book uh to if you're witnessing to
[47:34] someone um to give that to them. It
[47:37] really gives a good overview of
[47:39] everything through the ages. As well as
[47:40] we have um the baptism, water baptism, u
[47:45] the pamphlets, I have them in English
[47:47] and we have them in Spanish. So they're
[47:49] right out there on that other table
[47:51] because we you only got so many tables
[47:53] to sit things. So um so you know, just
[47:57] don't don't take it and tuck it away.
[47:59] But you know, look, you you when you put
[48:02] one maybe in your Bible and then if you
[48:03] come across someone and you say, "Hey, I
[48:05] have to give this away." Hey, we we we
[48:08] will keep getting more. We're we're
[48:10] we're looking for that last one. Amen.
[48:13] And so we just so so good to be
[48:15] together, isn't it? The Lord's so good
[48:17] to us. Amen. 1 Corinthians chapter 10
[48:21] and verse 15, we'll read just a few
[48:23] verses of scripture.
[48:25] Paul said, "I I speak as to wise men,
[48:29] and judge ye what I
[48:31] say. The cup of blessing which we bless,
[48:35] is it not the
[48:37] communion of the blood of Christ? The
[48:40] bread which we break, is it not the
[48:44] communion of the body of Christ? For we
[48:48] being many are one bread and one body.
[48:53] For we are all
[48:54] partakers of that one
[48:57] bread. Amen. May God bless you and bless
[49:01] the reading of the word. As you're being
[49:02] seated, I'd like to speak this
[49:07] morning a little on a thought on
[49:11] true communion.
[49:14] You know,
[49:16] when brother Brandham was even there in
[49:20] 1965 and he one of the last times he
[49:23] speaks the communion message, he um was
[49:26] there at the little building or the
[49:30] building where brother Perry Green and
[49:32] them had at the time which was the
[49:33] Jewish synagogue um or what had been a
[49:37] previously a Jewish synagogue and
[49:38] brother Brown never got a chance to
[49:40] preach in uh the Tucson Tabernacle.
[49:44] But he's going through that in the
[49:46] communion and there were things that he
[49:48] was addressing even then and some of
[49:51] these statements these are things that
[49:53] we no doubt have come across and u have
[49:56] heard and and that is that when the one
[50:00] the brother that was there was
[50:01] mentioning to brother Brandham he said
[50:03] well when we um the communion should
[50:06] just be just taking the word you know
[50:08] just coming and hearing the word and yet
[50:11] that is there's there's There's a truth
[50:13] as far as that we are communing by
[50:16] taking the word. But yet we know that
[50:20] with this that when communion such as
[50:22] what we'll do here in just a little bit
[50:24] as well as with footwashing and the
[50:27] other symbol that God gave the church is
[50:29] water baptism. Each one of these speak
[50:34] of an inward work of grace that has
[50:37] already taken place in a person's life.
[50:39] So a person just doesn't get you know
[50:42] baptized because they you know just just
[50:44] to go through an act but it's a
[50:46] declaration when God has dealt with a
[50:48] person's heart and there has come
[50:51] conviction in their life and they have
[50:54] repented of their sins to repent means
[50:57] to confess our wrong and turn from the
[51:01] way we're going and we're turning to the
[51:04] things of the Lord because with that
[51:08] that speaks of an inward work of what
[51:10] God is doing inwardly in a person's
[51:13] life. It's the same thing when it would
[51:15] come to of communion. Communion itself
[51:18] that we will take here in a little bit
[51:20] is a symbol of what is actually that we
[51:25] daily and we live by the word of God. It
[51:29] is a declaration that we're living by
[51:32] the word of God that my life uh and and
[51:35] the word is one. It's Christ's own life
[51:38] living in me. So it is a symbol and a
[51:41] declaration that the Lord Jesus left and
[51:44] he said this do in remembrance of me and
[51:48] when you do this you do show forth the
[51:50] Lord's death till he come. You we in
[51:53] showing that is declaring that we are
[51:57] one with him and it's a daily walk with
[52:01] him and same thing when it comes to with
[52:04] footwashing. Footwashing is an act of
[52:06] humility. And there's nowhere that we
[52:09] and we can ever get with God outside of
[52:11] humility. And I think every one of us
[52:13] would have the desire to say, "Lord, I
[52:16] want to be closer to you." And there's
[52:19] only one way to get closer to God, and
[52:21] that's humility. And the humility is
[52:24] that which is according to the word of
[52:26] God. God will always come where there is
[52:30] a a humble heart that is inviting to
[52:32] him. And so I when I deal with this
[52:35] thought here this morning on true
[52:36] communion, it may take me just let me
[52:39] lay in a few little bit here to get to
[52:41] this place. But brother Ram says when we
[52:44] when we have taken the Lord our
[52:47] sacrifice into us as a matter of
[52:50] spiritual birth into us and his body, we
[52:54] live by him by the word. We should also
[52:58] symbolize it because it's a commandment.
[53:00] So, we understand that we're not coming
[53:03] here today to take communion. Well, I I
[53:08] you know, I'm going to take it because I
[53:09] I hope I'm going to be there. But
[53:12] communions, that's not our approach. You
[53:15] know, when when Paul he says if we if we
[53:18] don't take it, uh we we don't we don't
[53:20] have any part with him. But yet he also
[53:23] says very clearly is that if our life is
[53:26] not tallying up with the word of God
[53:28] then don't take it. But you know what
[53:31] this is the thing of it is it's just it
[53:33] comes to a place of a showdown. But I I
[53:35] believe with all my heart that every
[53:37] every moment of our life should be at a
[53:39] place of a showdown. I think I think
[53:41] it's very clearly as you can see the
[53:43] unsteadiness and and I'm not one you
[53:46] know to go and try to uh figure out
[53:49] prophecy. God will just make it known.
[53:52] But we can see the instability of times
[53:54] that we're living in of the world and
[53:57] where man, you know, is very sure of
[53:58] himself, but yet there's only one thing
[54:00] that's sure and that's the word of God.
[54:03] Everything else is sinking sands and and
[54:05] there's a lot of things that can be
[54:07] disappointing. There's a lot of things
[54:08] that you can read and see and hear in
[54:10] the news and everything else. But I'll
[54:12] tell you, like the Lord Jesus said, when
[54:14] you begin to see all these things coming
[54:16] around, lift up your head for your
[54:18] redemption's drawing nigh. I believe
[54:20] it's an hour to be very very serious,
[54:23] very consecrated to live closer to God
[54:25] than we've ever lived before to ensure
[54:28] in our lives that our lives walking
[54:30] pleasing because we we we we don't know
[54:33] at that moment or that time of the
[54:34] rapture we don't know that we don't know
[54:36] that we even within our own lives the
[54:39] the longevity of our time but we want to
[54:41] know one thing is that Lord when it
[54:43] comes to my time whether it is the time
[54:45] of the rapture or it is that moment
[54:48] maybe my life is taken from here I want
[54:50] to I want it I want it to be a rest
[54:52] within me that everything that my life
[54:55] has been lived for the glory of God.
[54:58] Amen. Now remember when we're looking at
[55:00] this. So it's it's here this symbolizing
[55:03] when we take here of the communion it's
[55:05] the taking in of of it's symbolizing
[55:08] we've taken the Lord our sacrifice into
[55:10] us as a matter of spiritual birth into
[55:14] us and his body and we live by him by
[55:18] the word. Now Paul would speak of this
[55:21] because when you look at the word
[55:23] communion, the word communion means
[55:26] fellowship.
[55:28] And so fellowship itself can happen uh
[55:31] on many different levels and many
[55:33] different degrees. But Paul would write
[55:35] of this fellowship that he's speaking of
[55:38] here is God is faithful by whom ye were
[55:42] called unto the fellowship of his son
[55:45] Jesus Christ our Lord. That's so good.
[55:47] So in the midst of our lives and Paul's
[55:51] writing to the Corinthians, he's writing
[55:53] to every believer that would be down
[55:54] through the ages. It is by almighty God
[55:58] who is faithful. Faithful to what? He's
[56:00] faithful to his word. And so it's being
[56:04] faithful to his word. You and I have
[56:06] been called unto not a church, but we've
[56:10] been called unto the fellowship of his
[56:13] son Jesus Christ our Lord, where all
[56:16] things are reconciled under the blood.
[56:20] We are called into a complete fellowship
[56:24] with him. And so Paul would write of
[56:26] this in Ephesians 3:8 and say, "Unto me
[56:30] who am less than the least of all saints
[56:33] is this grace given that I should preach
[56:36] among the Gentiles the uncarchable
[56:38] riches of Christ and to make all men see
[56:41] what is the fellowship of the mystery."
[56:44] Now Paul uses this word fellowship and
[56:47] fellowship, yes, is communion, but it
[56:49] also means a participation in something.
[56:53] It also means you have a part or an
[56:56] allotment in that. And so the fellowship
[56:58] of the mystery that mystery that Paul is
[57:01] speaking of here which he says which
[57:03] from the beginning of the world hath
[57:05] been hidden God who created all things
[57:08] by Jesus Christ to the intent that now
[57:11] unto the principalities and powers in
[57:14] heavenly places might be known by the
[57:18] church the manifold wisdom of God.
[57:21] That's good. So that fellowship. So now
[57:24] we've called unto the fellowship uh as
[57:27] he's as he wrote there in Corinthians uh
[57:30] unto the fellowship of his son Jesus
[57:32] Christ our Lord to where we can have a
[57:35] real fellowship entering back into a
[57:38] relationship with God and through and by
[57:41] the blood that was shed and now the life
[57:44] of that blood has called you and I and
[57:47] brought us and it's him now dwelling in
[57:49] our lives and there's a fellowship and
[57:51] Paul said there's a fellow fellowship in
[57:54] the mystery. In other words, you have a
[57:57] part. I have a part. There is a there is
[58:00] a part that God when God begins to make
[58:04] himself known to you that there's
[58:07] something as the spirit of God, it just
[58:09] begins to rise up that this is what I've
[58:11] been searching for. This is what I've
[58:14] been longing for. This it's like a glove
[58:16] that's fitting the hand perfectly. and
[58:19] and and what he's calling us to is that
[58:22] so that his life might be manifested
[58:26] through our lives. It's like when you
[58:29] have that of a marriage, you have a
[58:31] husband and wife. They don't stay in the
[58:34] same place uh as when they were here at
[58:38] the altar or even within their week of
[58:40] the honeymoon. They continue to grow
[58:43] closer and closer. They come into a
[58:46] place where they know one another even
[58:48] more. They learn one another's character
[58:51] in a deeper way. And that's the same way
[58:53] with this fellowship with a mystery. And
[58:55] I'm saying this mystery, the mystery
[58:57] itself is Christ in you. It's
[59:01] fellowshipping with that reality that
[59:03] God knew you before Adam, molecule,
[59:07] anything. He knew you.
[59:10] You were always a part of him. Is that
[59:12] right? Yeah. So this is fellowshipping.
[59:15] It's it's participating. It's receiving.
[59:18] Because let me say this in this earth
[59:21] and this world, we can work and we can
[59:24] take things in and we can pay bills. But
[59:26] there's only one source of strength that
[59:29] gives us the strength to minister
[59:31] healing in our lives, whether physical
[59:33] or even that of emotional and down into
[59:36] our soul. And that has to be the
[59:38] strength from the fellowship of the
[59:40] mystery. Because within this fellowship
[59:44] with the mystery of God, then there is a
[59:47] strength that's being released in our
[59:49] life to where God's thoughts are you in
[59:52] submitting and I submitting to it are
[59:55] overriding our own thoughts.
[59:59] Because remember your thoughts are not
[1:00:01] eternal. His thoughts are and you are
[1:00:04] one of his thoughts. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:07] This is why the prophet said, "If you
[1:00:09] can see this, you'll see many other
[1:00:11] things."
[1:00:12] That's why he could say with the
[1:00:14] thoughts of God, they are eternal.
[1:00:17] And he said they have an eternal quality
[1:00:20] and you can never get away from that.
[1:00:24] That's so good. Oh, hallelujah. Amen. So
[1:00:28] this is where John could write and say
[1:00:30] that which we have seen and heard
[1:00:34] declare we unto you that ye also may
[1:00:37] have fellowship with us. And truly our
[1:00:42] fellowship is with the father and with
[1:00:45] his son Jesus Christ. That's not it's
[1:00:48] not writing of two different people but
[1:00:51] remember God is one.
[1:00:54] Is that right? God himself, the spirit,
[1:00:56] he here he condescends in word. And now
[1:01:00] then through and by word now coming into
[1:01:03] flesh and redemption that that same
[1:01:05] life, his own life, his spirit, his word
[1:01:09] might come and dwell in a many membered
[1:01:13] body.
[1:01:15] And so John, notice the bidding call
[1:01:18] here. You see coming out of John's heart
[1:01:20] now, the very the the very one who's
[1:01:23] calling out. Let me just tell you this
[1:01:25] is the spirit of God of what John has
[1:01:28] experienced that's calling out for all
[1:01:30] of the fallen sons and daughters of God
[1:01:33] have come and have fellowship with us.
[1:01:36] John's not asking them to come join a
[1:01:38] church. He's not as calling them to a
[1:01:41] click. He's not calling them to a club
[1:01:44] but to a fellowship. And what is that
[1:01:46] fellowship? It's the fellowship that is
[1:01:49] with the father and his son Jesus
[1:01:51] Christ.
[1:01:53] That's what matters. That kind of
[1:01:55] fellowship. Oh, it brings peace. It
[1:01:58] brings strength. It brings grace to
[1:02:00] overlook all of the shortcomings. It
[1:02:03] this is what the strength of this
[1:02:04] fellowship does.
[1:02:07] So, we recognize that in and when we
[1:02:10] look at fellowship, there's a better
[1:02:13] fellowship. And I'm there's a better
[1:02:15] fellowship. and how that God would would
[1:02:18] draw a life and a heart and and a life
[1:02:21] would, you know, respond to the Lord
[1:02:23] Jesus and repent of their sins. And I
[1:02:26] tell you, if you haven't started, that's
[1:02:28] the place to start. The the first thing
[1:02:31] before you can ever get in on the boxing
[1:02:34] match or into the match itself, the way
[1:02:37] on there is John 3:16.
[1:02:41] Amen. For God so loved the world that he
[1:02:44] gave his only begotten son that
[1:02:46] whosoever believeth in him believeth on
[1:02:49] him should not perish but might have
[1:02:53] eternal life. That'll get you on into
[1:02:56] the boxing ring. But that's just one
[1:02:58] step there is that that is through
[1:03:01] repentance. Recognizing our wrong and
[1:03:04] repenting and laying our lives down.
[1:03:08] Right. Amen. being baptized in the name
[1:03:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ. But there's a
[1:03:13] deepening of the fellowship. So when we
[1:03:16] write of this, let me just give you the
[1:03:18] quotation that brother Brandham refers
[1:03:20] to out of the Holy Ghost message. He
[1:03:22] says, "We are trying to bring people,
[1:03:25] our people into a better fellowship with
[1:03:28] Christ." That's our purpose. That's
[1:03:31] right. Now bear with me just a moment.
[1:03:35] Luther Luther the revelation dropped in
[1:03:39] Luther's heart because after Pentecost
[1:03:42] remember then after 30 years then here
[1:03:45] how that nickelan spirit came in that
[1:03:48] white horse rider and it begin to make
[1:03:50] its ride and then it moves over into the
[1:03:52] to the red horse rider and then then
[1:03:55] then through that time there and moves
[1:03:57] into the black horse rider there in
[1:04:00] Thyra and it's coming on down through
[1:04:02] and he makes his change into that of the
[1:04:05] pale horse rider. But let me go back
[1:04:07] first of all that when that death came
[1:04:10] in, the seed went in the ground. And you
[1:04:13] know how it is that right now we're
[1:04:15] experiencing life that has either went
[1:04:18] into the roots of your plants, right?
[1:04:21] Because you're starting to see buds come
[1:04:22] up. And then there's also that of seeds
[1:04:26] that maybe you'll purchase seeds to put
[1:04:28] in the ground. Those seeds had to come
[1:04:31] from another plant that had come to a
[1:04:33] place of maturity. So when you put that
[1:04:36] seed in the ground, it's the life in
[1:04:38] that seed that will reproduce or come
[1:04:41] fully back to the seed that you put in
[1:04:44] the ground. And so now Satan could not
[1:04:48] kill the life. The life went into the
[1:04:51] roots. But remember God said, "I will
[1:04:53] restore in Joel chapter 2." So now
[1:04:57] Luther receives the inspiration by the
[1:05:00] spirit of God that the just shall live
[1:05:03] by faith. It started out very wide.
[1:05:06] That's a wide open place because uh just
[1:05:10] to just to confess the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:12] as their savior. It started out with
[1:05:14] that. Were they was there a fellowship?
[1:05:17] There was. Then God anointed a man by
[1:05:20] the name of John Wesley who would be the
[1:05:23] messenger there to that Philadelphiaian
[1:05:25] age and God would give him the message
[1:05:28] of sanctification that there's a higher
[1:05:30] walk than just a justified a justified
[1:05:33] life because remember a person can
[1:05:35] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:05:37] still have all of the habits of the
[1:05:39] world the drinking the smoking and
[1:05:41] everything else but remember the whole
[1:05:44] thing about it is when any attributes it
[1:05:47] It's really has to come down with
[1:05:49] dealing with unbelief. That's what God's
[1:05:51] after. God's not after to try to make us
[1:05:53] to where, well, I don't do this and I
[1:05:55] don't do that. You've got the wrong
[1:05:57] picture. The picture that God is trying
[1:05:59] to come to is fellowship. And that
[1:06:02] fellowship is in a deeper better way.
[1:06:05] And that is where he becomes the very
[1:06:08] seal and the preeminent one in your
[1:06:10] life. So now it comes from Wesley and a
[1:06:14] sanctified life and cleaning up, you
[1:06:16] know, from all of the habits and things
[1:06:18] like that. It narrows down. And then and
[1:06:21] then the Pentecost came with the baptism
[1:06:25] of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the
[1:06:27] supernatural there in Isuza Street 1906.
[1:06:30] Is that right? But remember, God didn't
[1:06:33] stop there because that's not
[1:06:35] restoration. That was the third stage of
[1:06:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost, gifts of the
[1:06:40] spirit. But now when it comes time for
[1:06:43] where we're coming back to a place of a
[1:06:46] full union, then God himself in the
[1:06:49] changing ministry from the son of God,
[1:06:52] that which has been dispersed down
[1:06:54] through the church ages, it switches to
[1:06:56] the ministry of the son of man. In other
[1:06:59] words, it's the fullness of God, the
[1:07:01] fullness of the word of the attribute
[1:07:04] that is now stepped and become flesh.
[1:07:08] Are you with me now? This is very very
[1:07:10] important here. So within that changing
[1:07:13] it's the fullness of him of the word
[1:07:15] himself that comes among us to call us
[1:07:18] to true fellowship as husband and wife.
[1:07:22] You see this is why God does not
[1:07:25] consider flirting fellowship
[1:07:30] just playing around with something but
[1:07:32] he comes to call us into full fellowship
[1:07:36] and you know he's got everything
[1:07:38] provided for us. You know the Bible
[1:07:40] said, think about this. It's in a deeper
[1:07:42] fellowship. Justification brought them
[1:07:44] in a broad fellowship. Sanctification
[1:07:47] narrowed it down. It was a it was better
[1:07:50] fellowship. The baptism of the Holy
[1:07:52] Ghost came. It was a better fellowship.
[1:07:54] But all of that was coming with the
[1:07:57] purpose and laying the groundwork for
[1:08:00] that fellowship that would come between
[1:08:03] Christ and his bride in a union. That is
[1:08:06] so that is so good. It's God laying the
[1:08:09] groundwork like he did in the days of
[1:08:11] creation. And this is why the scripture
[1:08:13] would say that in Proverbs 4:18 that the
[1:08:16] path of the just is as a shining light
[1:08:20] that shineth more and more until the
[1:08:24] perfect day. In Hebrews
[1:08:26] 11:39:40, "And these all," speaking of
[1:08:29] all them down through the ages, all all
[1:08:31] that have lived down through the gentile
[1:08:34] church ages, these all having obtained a
[1:08:37] good report through faith, received not
[1:08:40] the promise. Luther did not receive the
[1:08:43] rapture promise.
[1:08:45] Wesley did not receive the rapture
[1:08:48] promise. Pentecost did not receive the
[1:08:51] rapture promise. The rapture promise is
[1:08:55] for the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:00] That's the rapture promise. Remember,
[1:09:02] he's coming back for a mature lady of
[1:09:06] the word.
[1:09:08] Is that right? So now God having
[1:09:11] provided some better thing for us that
[1:09:13] they without us should not be made
[1:09:15] perfect. Now you hear brother Brandham
[1:09:17] would refer to this over and over of the
[1:09:19] stages of a wheat plant. And when you
[1:09:21] consider this and you look at that
[1:09:23] stages of a wheat plant and seeing of
[1:09:26] how that you know when this come back up
[1:09:28] this was this was Luther the just shall
[1:09:31] live by faith now that does not look
[1:09:33] like the seed that went in the ground
[1:09:35] but it's a start
[1:09:38] it they're entering into fellowship but
[1:09:41] now here comes a better fellowship here
[1:09:44] comes the ministry of sanctifi
[1:09:46] sanctification Wesley with the tassel
[1:09:49] right so It's a place that's being
[1:09:52] formed for the seed to come, but yet
[1:09:54] there's no seed there. It this is
[1:09:56] starting to resemble. But now then you
[1:09:58] come to Pentecost, the baptism of the
[1:10:01] Holy Ghost and the rest the restoration
[1:10:03] of the gifts. But remember, uh, you
[1:10:05] know, most of us here in Ohio can see
[1:10:07] this in wheat fields and and I grew up
[1:10:09] walking through them, you know, there
[1:10:10] for a number of years. When that wheat
[1:10:13] is sticking up like that, you know it's
[1:10:14] not ready because it's not bowed in
[1:10:17] humility. Because when it's actually got
[1:10:19] something in it, some substance, it
[1:10:22] bends over like that. The top of it
[1:10:24] actually bends over. But now notice
[1:10:26] within this, it's looking more and we're
[1:10:29] getting more to that stage. And now
[1:10:32] within that time, it had to come to a
[1:10:34] complete ripening to where the shuck,
[1:10:37] what houses the seed, would actually
[1:10:40] pull away and expose that the seed is
[1:10:45] there. And this, my brother and sister,
[1:10:47] is what the coming of the message of the
[1:10:50] hour, the ministry of the son of man.
[1:10:53] That's what caused that Pentecostal
[1:10:55] shock to pull back.
[1:10:58] You're not going to tell us to do what
[1:10:59] the gifts. You're not going to do this.
[1:11:01] No, sir. No. You see, they resisted the
[1:11:04] word. Yet, they wanted the baptism of
[1:11:07] the spirit. But God was wanting to go
[1:11:10] deeper into a fellowship where these are
[1:11:14] no longer two but one.
[1:11:17] So it's not my will be done but thy will
[1:11:21] be done.
[1:11:24] Praise the Lord. And so all of this is
[1:11:27] all products of the life that was within
[1:11:29] the seed. Amen. It's all coming up. So
[1:11:32] every one of them that lived down
[1:11:35] through their time, they had fellowship
[1:11:37] with God according to what God had
[1:11:39] allotted in that hour.
[1:11:42] But none of them, none of them down
[1:11:44] through here could speak and declare the
[1:11:48] marriage of the lamb has come. Amen. In
[1:11:51] this hour though, you see, we're living
[1:11:53] in an hour where there's not promises
[1:11:55] being made, but promises are being
[1:11:58] fulfilled. Amen.
[1:12:00] This is why we're living in the end
[1:12:02] time.
[1:12:04] All that has been looked forward to now
[1:12:07] coming into manifestation. So it's a
[1:12:10] better how the better fellowship it
[1:12:13] comes back to a place to where the seed
[1:12:15] that went in the ground is before us.
[1:12:19] And that's the way it is with Christ in
[1:12:21] his bride. That's the way we're the seed
[1:12:24] of that life coming to a place to where
[1:12:26] this is why when when people try to say
[1:12:28] what are you who are you and what do you
[1:12:30] they're trying they're trying to
[1:12:31] identify you but you know what the
[1:12:33] greatest reality is to say I'm a
[1:12:35] Christian I'm a believer and you could
[1:12:38] say that from your heart by a divine
[1:12:40] witness that there's not one scripture
[1:12:44] that my soul will not punctuate amen to.
[1:12:47] Amen. There's not one scripture say,
[1:12:50] "Well, I'm okay with all of this, but I
[1:12:52] don't know, you know, know about that."
[1:12:53] No, it's got to come to where better
[1:12:55] fellowship, full fellowship, is when it
[1:12:58] becomes the amen in our soul.
[1:13:00] Hallelujah. This is why the prophet, now
[1:13:02] watch this, fellowship. He says, "The
[1:13:04] life that was in the husk, the stock, in
[1:13:07] the tassel, in the husk all gathers in
[1:13:09] the seed, and the life that was in the
[1:13:12] stock went, one went to make the other."
[1:13:14] This is why we we believe in
[1:13:16] justification. That's the
[1:13:18] start.
[1:13:20] Sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:13:22] Ghost, the gifts, everything goes in. We
[1:13:25] don't lose anything. It's just more and
[1:13:28] more shineth brighter until that perfect
[1:13:31] day. It's a gathering up.
[1:13:36] Justification made a way for
[1:13:38] sanctification.
[1:13:40] Sanctification made a way for the
[1:13:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the
[1:13:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:13:47] the Holy Ghost himself to come right
[1:13:50] down in perfection back to the word
[1:13:53] again to manifest himself. Pentecost
[1:13:56] never produced that. I'm talking about
[1:13:59] Isuza Street. Right? Are you hearing me?
[1:14:02] Now, let me just let me just drop this
[1:14:04] very clear. When the Holy Ghost has come
[1:14:07] and that new birth into our life,
[1:14:09] remember your birth is not your
[1:14:12] adoption, right? But the birth itself
[1:14:15] when it comes into our life, it's that
[1:14:17] of that eternal day that has broke in
[1:14:20] our hearts. But we are not out of the
[1:14:23] seventh church age
[1:14:26] because God promised he'd have
[1:14:27] overcomers out of this age.
[1:14:30] Is that right? He promised he would have
[1:14:32] overcomers and and we overcome by his
[1:14:34] life. And the promise is that we would
[1:14:37] sat with him in his throne even as he
[1:14:41] has overcome and sat down with the
[1:14:44] father in his throne. Is that right? So
[1:14:48] in that same promise now, so then we
[1:14:50] understand that has all of the stages
[1:14:52] like we looked at here before every one
[1:14:54] of those stages when it's coming back to
[1:14:56] that seed time. it comes. That's the
[1:14:59] time for rapture. That's harvest time.
[1:15:02] That's rapture. And let me just say this
[1:15:04] to you. The rapture itself is not just
[1:15:07] an event we're looking forward to. It's
[1:15:10] an event that we are participating in
[1:15:13] right now.
[1:15:16] We are fellowshipping in the mystery of
[1:15:19] the coming of the Lord.
[1:15:22] He's catching us away from our own
[1:15:25] ideas, from our own thinking, from our
[1:15:27] own lives. We are fellowshipping in the
[1:15:31] mystery of the coming of the Lord.
[1:15:33] Fellowshipping in the mystery of the
[1:15:37] Holy Ghost.
[1:15:39] Christ in you, the hope of glory. It's
[1:15:42] catching us up. Catching us up, catching
[1:15:44] us up.
[1:15:46] Now, go with me in the scriptures to
[1:15:48] John chapter 17. And I want you to look
[1:15:51] at this here just for a
[1:15:56] moment in John chapter 17 and verse
[1:16:01] 20. You know, because the only grounds
[1:16:04] there's only only one grounds for
[1:16:07] fellowship and that's the word of God.
[1:16:11] So in John 17 and verse 20 and I want
[1:16:15] you to I want you to look at this. Jesus
[1:16:18] said, "Neither pray I for these alone,
[1:16:21] but for them also which shall believe on
[1:16:23] me through their
[1:16:25] word, that they all may be one as thou,
[1:16:29] Father, art in me, and I in thee, that
[1:16:33] they also may be one in us, that the
[1:16:37] world may believe that thou hast sent
[1:16:40] me. And the glory which thou gavest me,
[1:16:43] I have given them, that they may be
[1:16:46] one." So this glory that he imparts is
[1:16:50] that glory that we might be one. What is
[1:16:53] that glory? It's the revealing of the
[1:16:56] father. It's the revealing of God's
[1:16:59] thoughts to you. It's the revealing of
[1:17:01] God's life. That glory that that glory,
[1:17:05] notice he says, "And the glory which
[1:17:07] thou gavest me, I have given them
[1:17:12] that they may be one even as we are
[1:17:15] one." Right? I in them, thou in me, that
[1:17:19] they may be made perfect in one, and
[1:17:22] that the world may know that thou hast
[1:17:25] sent me and hast loved me as thou hast
[1:17:29] loved me, or loved them as thou hast
[1:17:31] loved me. Look at this in verse 24.
[1:17:33] Father, I will that they also whom thou
[1:17:36] hast given me be with me where I am,
[1:17:39] that they may behold my glory which was
[1:17:42] given me. For thou lovest me before the
[1:17:45] foundation of the world. Oh my. He asked
[1:17:48] for one request. Think of it. He didn't
[1:17:51] ask. This wasn't the last rights of what
[1:17:53] meal he'd like to have. He the last
[1:17:57] request he asked for. Grant it that I
[1:18:00] can have their fellowship. Hallelujah.
[1:18:04] You know what this was? This is why the
[1:18:06] the revelation of the godhead is so
[1:18:08] powerful. This is not the second person
[1:18:11] of the trinity. Jesus is the tabernacle
[1:18:15] that almighty God dwelt in.
[1:18:18] Hallelujah. And Jesus was the mouthpiece
[1:18:22] where God himself, the word was
[1:18:24] expressing his desire. This was God's
[1:18:28] desire from before an atom or a
[1:18:31] molecule. He longed for fellowship.
[1:18:35] Amen.
[1:18:36] [Applause]
[1:18:38] Everything hidden in the mystery down
[1:18:40] through time.
[1:18:44] It would be one after his own kind. And
[1:18:47] he asked for this fellowship, this
[1:18:49] request, oh righteous father, the world
[1:18:52] hath not known thee, but I have known
[1:18:54] thee, and these have known that thou
[1:18:56] hast sent me. And I have declared unto
[1:18:59] them thy name and will declare it that
[1:19:01] the love wherewith thou hast loved me
[1:19:03] may be in them and I in them.
[1:19:07] Oh brother and sister, what does this
[1:19:10] what does this fellowship do? It is the
[1:19:13] love of God coming in the very depths of
[1:19:15] our lives. That's so good. And it don't
[1:19:18] stop. There's no stopping part. You
[1:19:20] can't find an end to the love of God.
[1:19:23] Amen. It keeps reaching and moving and
[1:19:26] pulsating and drawing you deeper and
[1:19:29] deeper and deeper. Hallelujah. Oh my.
[1:19:34] Brother Brandon said in the oneness he
[1:19:36] said that's the only grounds of
[1:19:37] fellowship that God's ever laid down for
[1:19:39] himself in the church is the oneness of
[1:19:43] himself in the people. That's the only
[1:19:46] grounds of fellowship. The only way that
[1:19:48] you can have those grounds is by union
[1:19:51] to be united with him forever. Right?
[1:19:54] Now, the disciples walking with him when
[1:19:58] he was here in his earthly ministry and
[1:20:02] then that body of Jesus, they had
[1:20:04] fellowship. Yeah. But they didn't have
[1:20:06] perfect fellowship. That's good, right?
[1:20:09] There was a more perfect fellowship.
[1:20:12] that that fellowship where they were
[1:20:16] fellowshipping and recognizing never a
[1:20:18] man spake like this things that they
[1:20:21] were witnessing and what they were
[1:20:22] seeing doing. You see, they didn't know
[1:20:24] and understand what it was all about but
[1:20:27] they were attracted to it.
[1:20:30] And there were many that went along and
[1:20:32] were attracted to it as well.
[1:20:35] And when it came down to a real tight
[1:20:38] place in the road where he started
[1:20:41] making statements that that that
[1:20:44] actually would declare that there's
[1:20:46] something beyond the natural
[1:20:47] understanding of a man.
[1:20:50] When he made the statements that he did
[1:20:52] in John 6, there were many that walked
[1:20:55] away and said, "We're not following this
[1:20:57] anymore."
[1:20:58] But the elect, how many times you hear
[1:21:00] brother Ram say this over and over. it.
[1:21:02] Listen friends, brother Brown, when he's
[1:21:03] saying this, he's these are important
[1:21:05] statements to pay attention to. He said
[1:21:07] the elect could not explain it,
[1:21:13] but they believed it. Hallelujah.
[1:21:16] Because he said the understanding would
[1:21:18] come at a later time. They didn't
[1:21:21] understand that. But there was something
[1:21:23] that even though they're understanding
[1:21:26] things couldn't match up and I don't
[1:21:28] know about this and you're trying to say
[1:21:30] this and say that I don't understand all
[1:21:32] that but there's something in me that
[1:21:34] just says there's something real here.
[1:21:41] Oh hallelujah. That's why we don't know
[1:21:43] God by an intellectual conception. We
[1:21:46] know God as the God who dwells behind
[1:21:50] the flesh.
[1:21:51] We know him by revelation
[1:21:54] and revelation is greater. Listen, I
[1:21:57] believe we ought to study the word, but
[1:21:59] you can memorize every word. You can
[1:22:01] know the Hebrew and the Greek and miss
[1:22:04] what God
[1:22:06] desires. God never came to make Bible
[1:22:10] students. He came to restore
[1:22:15] fellowship. Hallelujah.
[1:22:18] That was his burning.
[1:22:22] That was his longing.
[1:22:25] Hallelujah.
[1:22:28] Lord. So, sure, we believe in getting in
[1:22:30] the word, but just tell that devil to
[1:22:32] get off your shoulder. Well, you don't
[1:22:33] understand this and you don't understand
[1:22:35] that. I may not understand this and I
[1:22:37] may not understand that, but I know in
[1:22:39] whom I have believed.
[1:22:42] I've seen what he's done in my life.
[1:22:45] And when I got need to know of it, he'll
[1:22:47] show me.
[1:22:50] I'm not a slave. I'm not a beggar. I'm a
[1:22:53] son and daughter of God. And he said,
[1:22:55] "Ask."
[1:22:58] He said, "Seek."
[1:23:00] He said, "Knock and it shall be open
[1:23:04] unto you."
[1:23:09] Hallelujah.
[1:23:12] Oh my. This this fellowship is like a is
[1:23:15] like a man and a woman who are friends
[1:23:18] and then they enter into a courtship and
[1:23:21] oh are wooing around their hearts and
[1:23:23] kind of getting to know one another as
[1:23:26] friends and then they're in that season.
[1:23:29] Now they're not going to be able to
[1:23:31] experience that of marriage in that
[1:23:34] season of courtship. It's not the
[1:23:35] season.
[1:23:38] It's not even the season for certain
[1:23:39] words to be expressed. That's right. Are
[1:23:42] you hearing me? But you see, courtship
[1:23:44] is necessary because in that courtship,
[1:23:47] another part of the fold is engagement.
[1:23:49] What is engagement? Engagement is a
[1:23:52] confirming that God has revealed to my
[1:23:55] heart that this is my mate. Yes. You
[1:23:58] see, this is why we can we don't just
[1:24:00] come around the word and come around the
[1:24:02] message. But as God deals with our
[1:24:04] heart, he's speaking to our life and it
[1:24:07] comes to a place to where we recognize
[1:24:10] that this message is not the ideas of a
[1:24:13] man. It's none other than Jesus Christ,
[1:24:17] the promised word revealed from word to
[1:24:20] flesh. And it becomes an absolute that
[1:24:23] we can set our heart in to know that the
[1:24:25] God who made the promise is the same God
[1:24:28] to bring that experience in my life.
[1:24:33] Hallelujah. So good. Praise God. Yes.
[1:24:37] Deeper. Then it goes into a better
[1:24:40] fellowship. Marriage,
[1:24:42] right? But it don't stop there.
[1:24:46] It goes into a better and a deeper
[1:24:48] fellowship where new life comes forth.
[1:24:52] Is that right? A deeper fellowship. A
[1:24:54] fellowship that's behind the veil. Not
[1:24:56] just a fellowship that's in the kitchen
[1:24:58] where we're eating and enjoying the
[1:25:00] foods or come into the living room
[1:25:02] enjoying the company and the fellowship
[1:25:05] of the but then into the bedroom where
[1:25:08] relationship takes place where new life
[1:25:10] comes forth.
[1:25:15] That's the fellowship. That's true
[1:25:17] communion behind the veil. That's what
[1:25:20] God told Moses. I will meet with thee
[1:25:24] and commune with thee above the mercy
[1:25:26] seat.
[1:25:28] You and I can never get there. But God
[1:25:31] came to where we were.
[1:25:34] And let me tell you, the mercy seat is
[1:25:36] not somewhere far off. It's the Holy
[1:25:39] Spirit coming and dealing with your life
[1:25:42] and you seeing that I was always part of
[1:25:44] the mystery
[1:25:46] that I'm part of the tabernacle of the
[1:25:49] living God and that in your soul when
[1:25:53] the spirit of God has come that now
[1:25:55] becomes a mercy seat. Hallelujah.
[1:25:59] [Applause]
[1:26:02] This is why you get convicted when
[1:26:04] you're wrong. Yes. Amen. Oh, this is why
[1:26:08] when things aren't going just right,
[1:26:10] why? Because the judgment seat of Christ
[1:26:13] has now come into the heart of the
[1:26:15] believer and our sins are taken daily.
[1:26:21] Brother Samuel, what about the throne
[1:26:23] where he's seated and he's there and
[1:26:25] represented as Paul said in Hebrews
[1:26:27] 9:24? He's there. He's my advocate. He's
[1:26:30] my propituation. But you're not two
[1:26:33] different separate people. The spirit in
[1:26:35] you is the life that's in the sacrifice.
[1:26:38] And you are tied in to the sacrifice.
[1:26:42] And this is why the prophet said when he
[1:26:44] spoke to Sister Bruce and she was
[1:26:46] looking at all her mistakes, he said,
[1:26:48] "Sister Bruce," he said, "we," he said,
[1:26:51] "God does not see us as sinners anymore.
[1:26:57] He only hears our voice coming through
[1:27:00] the blood." Amen.
[1:27:03] Let me tell you something powerful. The
[1:27:06] real new birth, it makes you more
[1:27:07] innocent than any newborn you could see
[1:27:09] s set sitting here.
[1:27:12] That's not my words. That's the words of
[1:27:14] the prophet of God in this hour.
[1:27:18] Hallelujah. Because it's the word coming
[1:27:21] bringing that fellowship. This is why
[1:27:24] the prophet would speak about you see
[1:27:28] the Lord. He would tell the church in
[1:27:29] invisible union, we want you to we want
[1:27:32] to give you and think of trying to lead
[1:27:35] you to deeper thoughts, higher
[1:27:38] objectives, not just to come and have
[1:27:41] fellowship with a group of people, but a
[1:27:44] deeper fellowship,
[1:27:46] to have a a fellowship. Because the
[1:27:49] purpose of God justifying you is that he
[1:27:52] might sanctify you. That's so good. And
[1:27:54] the purpose he sanctifies you is that he
[1:27:56] might fill you with his spirit. See,
[1:28:00] God's got a purpose in it all. And
[1:28:01] that's why that within within our lives,
[1:28:03] you see, you listen, friend, to to you
[1:28:05] and I as a believer, the only thing that
[1:28:07] we want is him.
[1:28:09] And that's all that's all we want. When
[1:28:11] God got a hold of your life like he got
[1:28:12] a hold of my life, all I wanted was him.
[1:28:15] And you know what? I can't get enough of
[1:28:17] him.
[1:28:20] I can't get enough of him. I didn't just
[1:28:22] stop on the line of, well, I got the
[1:28:23] Holy Ghost when I when that came in my
[1:28:25] life. I want more of him.
[1:28:29] Now, you have to fight for that every
[1:28:30] day of your life because your old
[1:28:32] stinking flesh is always going to get in
[1:28:34] the way, try to hinder you, try to pull
[1:28:36] you back. But greater is he that is in
[1:28:39] you than he that's in the world.
[1:28:43] Come on now.
[1:28:45] Oh my. Just go ahead and put your angel
[1:28:47] wings up. They're not welcome here.
[1:28:51] It's a partaking of his life. How how
[1:28:54] could we partake of his life if he had
[1:28:57] not come down and offered to us his
[1:29:00] life? That's right. The prophets had a
[1:29:04] taste of it.
[1:29:06] But they weren't able it would God never
[1:29:08] came down and abodeed on them. Remember
[1:29:11] that would be the difference when John
[1:29:14] was spoken to in his message on whom you
[1:29:17] see the spirit of God descend and abide.
[1:29:22] That's the difference. Not just a
[1:29:24] baptism, not just an anointing, but an
[1:29:27] indwelling. Amen. That was what? To
[1:29:30] restore that fellowship, that true
[1:29:33] communion. Notice what Jesus said in the
[1:29:36] partaking of his life. He says it like
[1:29:38] this. I am the living bread which came
[1:29:40] down from heaven. Boy, this got them
[1:29:42] stirred up.
[1:29:44] If any man eat of this bread, he shall
[1:29:46] live forever, and the bread that I will
[1:29:49] give is my flesh, which I will give for
[1:29:52] the life of the world. And the Jews
[1:29:54] therefore strove among themselves,
[1:29:56] saying, "How can this man give us his
[1:29:58] flesh to eat?" Then Jesus said unto
[1:30:00] them, except you eat the flesh of the
[1:30:01] son of man and drink his blood, you have
[1:30:04] no life in him.
[1:30:07] Now, they could have went back in the
[1:30:08] scriptures in the law and said, "Ah,
[1:30:11] that's a mistake." That's right. But you
[1:30:13] see what God God comes to fulfill. The
[1:30:17] law was only a shadow.
[1:30:21] Remember the elect, they couldn't
[1:30:23] explain all of this right here. But you
[1:30:25] weren't going to run them away.
[1:30:28] You think that You think the devil
[1:30:29] wasn't on their back trying to shoot
[1:30:32] them websites about stuff? Well, he said
[1:30:33] this wrong. He said, you know what this
[1:30:35] says? We can go write the scriptures in
[1:30:37] Leviticus on this. You shall not eat the
[1:30:39] blood of anything that's offered. I was
[1:30:41] all, but that was a type.
[1:30:45] You see, friends, it's not you and I
[1:30:47] figuring out the word of God. God never
[1:30:50] called us to be debaters. He called us
[1:30:53] to be the expressed
[1:30:56] word of Almighty God.
[1:31:00] Hallelujah.
[1:31:03] Oh, glory be to God in the highest.
[1:31:06] Lord, who so eateth, look at this, who
[1:31:08] so eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my
[1:31:10] blood hath eternal life, and I will
[1:31:12] raise him up at the last day. For my
[1:31:14] flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is
[1:31:17] drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh
[1:31:19] and drinkkeeth my blood, dwelleth in me,
[1:31:22] and I in him. And as the living father
[1:31:24] hath sent me, and I live by the father,
[1:31:26] so he that eateth me, even he shall live
[1:31:29] by me. This is the bread which came down
[1:31:32] from heaven, not as your fathers did eat
[1:31:34] mana and are dead. He that eateth of
[1:31:37] this bread shall live forever.
[1:31:42] So now the word now to for you and I to
[1:31:45] become a partaker of this fellowship,
[1:31:50] this life, it
[1:31:52] required God becoming one of us.
[1:31:56] It required the word to become flesh.
[1:32:03] It required with the word becoming
[1:32:05] flesh, then that that word would be
[1:32:08] offered up. It would be it would be
[1:32:10] surrendered and then the life that was
[1:32:13] within that blood cell would come back
[1:32:16] upon the worshipper that you and I might
[1:32:19] be a partaker of the word and the
[1:32:22] spirit.
[1:32:24] Watch this. Brother Bram says in
[1:32:25] commemoration of his death. This is how
[1:32:27] we come to take it. His body that we
[1:32:30] believe that we eat daily or we've just
[1:32:34] got through eating as our brother
[1:32:36] preached on taking the word of God. We
[1:32:38] believe it with all of our heart. So
[1:32:40] this is this is this is what we are
[1:32:42] doing. We are eating right now. We are
[1:32:45] eating upon the word of God as the word
[1:32:48] is coming forth. This is why that man
[1:32:50] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:32:53] every word that proceedth out of the
[1:32:56] mouth of God. We live our lives are
[1:32:59] lived by the living word of God.
[1:33:03] Is that right? So to know that within
[1:33:06] that he's saying in commemoration of his
[1:33:08] death and his body that we believe that
[1:33:11] we eat daily or just got through eating
[1:33:13] as our brother preached to us taking the
[1:33:15] word of God we believe it with all of
[1:33:17] our heart. I love this. We see it
[1:33:19] manifested. We see it given to us. We
[1:33:23] see it vindicated. We feel it in our
[1:33:27] lives. We must come to this with a deep
[1:33:30] conscience of what we're doing, not just
[1:33:31] because it's in order. So why did we
[1:33:34] come? Listen, communion, it should not
[1:33:36] be a dread. Communion is a time of
[1:33:39] worship for true believers. Amen. It's a
[1:33:43] time that and I know Satan just likes to
[1:33:45] pile on and beat people up left and
[1:33:47] right and and you know accuse them.
[1:33:49] Well, well, sure. We're not talking
[1:33:50] about being live any sort of way. Well,
[1:33:53] you know, God, no, we're but we're
[1:33:54] talking about a reality in our heart
[1:33:56] that there's a longing to please him
[1:33:58] daily. And we are living by the word of
[1:34:02] God. We're taking it in and then we see
[1:34:04] it moving in our lives. We see the
[1:34:06] vindication of it. You know how many
[1:34:08] times you know when you eat you're going
[1:34:10] to you're going getting ready to eat
[1:34:11] here in just a little bit and you'll go
[1:34:13] to eat whether you're eating whatever
[1:34:14] meal you're going to eat. You're not
[1:34:15] going to see the vindication of that
[1:34:17] right away in your body. But you give it
[1:34:19] until tomorrow your body will have
[1:34:22] broken down all of the nutrients that's
[1:34:24] in there and got it to where it needs to
[1:34:26] go. And that's the same way it is with
[1:34:29] eating the word of God. We eat the word
[1:34:32] of God and sometimes we we're not seeing
[1:34:34] it vindicated right away, but our faith,
[1:34:37] that's how we eat it. We eat it and say,
[1:34:40] "Thank you, Lord. You're eating it.
[1:34:42] You're taking in the word." Let me tell
[1:34:44] you, you'll never be good enough. You'll
[1:34:46] never overcome your unbelief. You'll
[1:34:48] never overcome things in your life
[1:34:49] without taking the word of God because
[1:34:52] the word of God has strength in it.
[1:34:57] Hallelujah.
[1:34:59] When they ate the word down there in
[1:35:01] Exodus 12 before leaving Egypt, let me
[1:35:04] tell you the strength that was in this
[1:35:06] communion. Their clothes didn't even
[1:35:08] wear out.
[1:35:13] Hallelujah. There was healing in the
[1:35:15] camp.
[1:35:18] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. I
[1:35:20] ask you, is there healing in this
[1:35:22] fellowship?
[1:35:25] There's healing in the fellowship of the
[1:35:28] mystery of God. There's healing in this
[1:35:31] fellowship.
[1:35:32] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So now
[1:35:36] we enter into that fellowship and Jesus
[1:35:39] I I wish I had time to read all of this,
[1:35:41] but I I just don't. But out of in John
[1:35:43] chapter 14 where Jesus is is laying down
[1:35:47] how we enter into this fellowship and he
[1:35:50] would say, "If you love me, keep my
[1:35:52] commandments." You see, that's where it
[1:35:54] all starts. I mean, you wouldn't want to
[1:35:56] marry nobody you don't love.
[1:35:59] Dear Lord, that's not that smart.
[1:36:03] See, you got you had if you love me,
[1:36:05] you'll keep my commandments. Right? And
[1:36:08] I will pray the father and he shall give
[1:36:10] you another comforter that he may abide
[1:36:13] with you forever. So here they were
[1:36:15] having fellowship, but they needed
[1:36:17] perfect fellowship. All right. Even the
[1:36:20] Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot
[1:36:23] receive, because it seeth him not,
[1:36:26] neither knoweth him, but ye know him.
[1:36:28] For he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:36:30] you. I Who's this? Who's this comforter?
[1:36:34] Who's this another comforter? Who's this
[1:36:36] spirit of truth? I will not leave you
[1:36:40] comfortless. Yes. The same one who was
[1:36:44] talking through the veil
[1:36:47] of the body of Jesus. He said, "I will
[1:36:50] not leave you comfortless. I won't leave
[1:36:52] you as orphans. I will come to you.
[1:36:57] How did he come to them?" He came to
[1:36:59] them in the form of the word by the
[1:37:02] spirit.
[1:37:04] And he's telling them, remember Judas
[1:37:05] asked the question on down. I I pray
[1:37:07] you'll forgive me. Just let me kind of
[1:37:09] move through it a little bit because I
[1:37:10] just for time, but you can read it
[1:37:12] later. But Judas is asking, "How are you
[1:37:14] going to manifest yourself to us and not
[1:37:16] to the world?" And Jesus said, "If a man
[1:37:18] love me in verse 23, he'll keep my words
[1:37:21] and my father will love him and we will
[1:37:23] come unto him and make our abode with
[1:37:25] him. And he that loveth me keepeth not
[1:37:28] my sayings. And the word which you hear
[1:37:30] is not mine, but the father's which sent
[1:37:33] me. and these things that I've spoken
[1:37:35] being present with you. But the
[1:37:37] comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
[1:37:39] the Father will send in my name, he'll
[1:37:41] teach you all things, bring all things
[1:37:43] to your remembrance, whatsoever I have
[1:37:46] said unto you. Do you catch what Jesus
[1:37:49] is saying? The words that I'm speaking
[1:37:50] to you, these ain't mine. This is the
[1:37:53] father's words.
[1:37:55] Hallelujah. Amen. It was God speaking
[1:38:00] through his son. All right. Is that
[1:38:03] right? God speaking through his word,
[1:38:06] conveying his thoughts, his desire. And
[1:38:09] this is why Jesus could say, "The words
[1:38:11] that I speak unto you, they are spirit
[1:38:14] and they are life."
[1:38:18] Now, here in Genesis
[1:38:21] 14, here comes Abraham. And Abraham
[1:38:24] being a type of the believer, he comes
[1:38:27] back. Remember, Lot is taken captive.
[1:38:29] And I understand Lot is a type of the,
[1:38:32] you know, the lukewarm, the, you know,
[1:38:34] denominational believer. Luke, you know,
[1:38:37] Lot, Lot himself, when he saw the the
[1:38:39] two angels coming down to Sodom, he
[1:38:41] said, "Lords."
[1:38:42] But Abraham standing there in Genesis 18
[1:38:45] when he saw him, there were three that
[1:38:46] came to him and he said, "My Lord."
[1:38:49] Abraham had a revelation of the Godhead.
[1:38:52] He knew who was present and who was
[1:38:54] coming. Amen. Right now, it was in
[1:38:59] Genesis 18 where Sarah receives her
[1:39:02] awakening. Right? Because she's standing
[1:39:06] in the presence of the works. She
[1:39:08] doesn't realize it. Abraham knows who's
[1:39:11] in their midst. That's why Abraham said,
[1:39:13] "Hey, go go go go go get something to
[1:39:15] eat. May make some good cornbread and
[1:39:17] beans and and get get this lamb all
[1:39:19] fried up and and fixed up. I mean, get
[1:39:20] the buttermilk out. Get everything. What
[1:39:22] should I do? Give the best. Get it out
[1:39:25] here. Why? We want to entertain him.
[1:39:28] Amen. Sarah did not understand what was
[1:39:32] going on.
[1:39:35] But God came there purposely in Genesis
[1:39:38] 18 not to dissolve Abraham's doubt, but
[1:39:41] he came there to dissolve Sarah's doubt.
[1:39:45] [Applause]
[1:39:46] That's what the revealing of the son of
[1:39:49] man and this message is about is to
[1:39:51] dissolve the doubt from the hearts of
[1:39:54] the believer
[1:39:59] me. How shall I have pleasure? How could
[1:40:02] I ever be a part of this? How could I?
[1:40:04] And right there, the word discerns and
[1:40:07] said, "Why did Sarah laugh in her
[1:40:09] heart?" Not out loud. The word is a
[1:40:12] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:40:14] the heart.
[1:40:16] She said, "I didn't laugh. She lied. She
[1:40:18] was caught. It's like a cover was taken
[1:40:20] off. But thank God that through the
[1:40:22] union of Abraham, he couldn't touch
[1:40:24] her."
[1:40:27] Is that right? But what happened? There
[1:40:28] became a dissolving of the doubt in her
[1:40:31] heart. And instead of there being doubt
[1:40:33] in her heart, what do we read chapters
[1:40:35] later? Even after the lapse down there
[1:40:38] at Gare, the Bible says that the Lord
[1:40:40] visited Sarah as he had promised.
[1:40:44] It went from doubt in her heart to
[1:40:46] laughter.
[1:40:47] [Applause]
[1:40:49] Isaac means laughter. Instead of
[1:40:51] doubting and being tossed this way, now
[1:40:54] there is laughter on the inside. That
[1:40:56] devil has lost. He's been conquered.
[1:40:59] Triumph has
[1:41:02] come. Hallelujah.
[1:41:05] He said he turned your mourning into
[1:41:07] dancing.
[1:41:10] Hallelujah.
[1:41:11] [Applause]
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:14] Glory. I feel good, man. I feel good.
[1:41:20] Hallelujah.
[1:41:22] Here's Abraham after after after going
[1:41:25] down there and whipping those kings. He
[1:41:27] comes back with all the spoils.
[1:41:31] Melzdc meets him on the plains. Now, as
[1:41:35] a Bible reader, you can go in Hebrews
[1:41:37] chapter 7. Like brother says, "Oh, this
[1:41:40] Melzdc, this who is this mysterious
[1:41:43] character. Oh, it's calls Bible students
[1:41:45] to
[1:41:47] puzzle." But it goes right down to the
[1:41:49] scripture. Isn't it incredible? It's
[1:41:51] laying right in the scripture the whole
[1:41:52] time. That's right. You know, all it
[1:41:54] took was the right would get a diamond
[1:41:56] chip on it. It could release what's
[1:41:58] already been sealed in there. And what
[1:42:00] it begins to pick up out of Hebrews 7 is
[1:42:02] is him who had no father nor mother, nor
[1:42:06] beginning of days, nor ending of life.
[1:42:08] So this Melzdc could have been none
[1:42:11] other than God himself.
[1:42:17] And he's coming down not by accident.
[1:42:20] He's coming down with a special
[1:42:22] appointment to Abram.
[1:42:26] Abraham's just won a great battle. And
[1:42:29] after the battle has been won, this is
[1:42:32] the first time, never been instituted
[1:42:34] yet, but the first time where he offers
[1:42:37] his child communion, bread and wine.
[1:42:41] He didn't get it from nowhere else. It
[1:42:44] was of his own substance.
[1:42:46] Hallelujah.
[1:42:48] Woo.
[1:42:49] He prepared him a table in the presence
[1:42:53] of his enemies. All of those other kings
[1:42:56] were there. The king of Lady Osia, the
[1:42:58] king of this, the king of that. I'll
[1:43:00] give you this. I'll give you that. I'll
[1:43:02] give you this. I'll make your life
[1:43:03] easier. But Abraham was locked in.
[1:43:07] [Applause]
[1:43:09] Hallelujah. You say, "What was
[1:43:10] happening?" It was not mind over matter.
[1:43:13] It was God's mind
[1:43:16] that was over the matter, the seed that
[1:43:19] laid in Abraham's life.
[1:43:24] And after the battle was over, he gave
[1:43:28] him bread and wine.
[1:43:30] God was showing what he was going to do
[1:43:34] to every son and daughter of God. Amen.
[1:43:37] After the battle was over. Not just
[1:43:40] after the battle of this life's journey
[1:43:41] is over. When at the marriage supper of
[1:43:44] the lamb, we we'll have the communion
[1:43:45] with him. He promised it. But after the
[1:43:48] battle is over in our own lives, the
[1:43:51] struggle against sin, the laying down of
[1:43:55] our own will, the laying down of our own
[1:43:58] life, like Jacob, Jacob had to wrestle
[1:44:00] it out.
[1:44:02] Is that right? Jacob had to wrestle out,
[1:44:04] but Jacob come to a place, let me tell
[1:44:06] you something. Jacob got a hold on the
[1:44:08] word and he wasn't going to let it go.
[1:44:12] My Lord, you might look at your life
[1:44:15] right now and you say, "Look at me."
[1:44:16] Don't let go of the word. If you love
[1:44:19] me, keep my commandments. Don't let go
[1:44:22] of the word because the word knows
[1:44:26] exactly where to touch you in your life.
[1:44:31] He didn't just bless Jacob in his spirit
[1:44:34] or his head. The Bible said he blessed
[1:44:37] him there.
[1:44:39] Where did he where is the there? It was
[1:44:42] that hidden mystery of Israel in Jacob
[1:44:45] the whole time.
[1:44:47] The blessing of God's life came down as
[1:44:51] a seal in Jacob's life.
[1:44:55] And you know what? He had a different
[1:44:57] walk.
[1:44:59] He wasn't going out there trying to act
[1:45:00] like walking different. He went out
[1:45:02] there walking different.
[1:45:04] Amen. Well, you could still see in
[1:45:06] chapters. You could steal. You read, you
[1:45:07] Bible readers know this. You go ahead
[1:45:09] and read in different chapters, you'll
[1:45:10] see in certain chapters where it says,
[1:45:11] "And Jacob did this. Why don't it say
[1:45:13] Israel?" Cuz sometimes the actions
[1:45:15] coming out weren't Israel actions. They
[1:45:16] were Jacob.
[1:45:20] The Bible said Jacob went and went and
[1:45:21] he bowed down to Esau after that. Why
[1:45:24] was he doing that after already what God
[1:45:26] had done in his life? But you see, God
[1:45:28] when when Mor and Jacob's life through
[1:45:31] the mystery of Israel that had been
[1:45:33] revealed and bring him to a place to
[1:45:35] learn, you don't have to bow to things
[1:45:37] in your life no longer. There's things
[1:45:40] about your family that you are a part of
[1:45:43] another family. You are part of my mind.
[1:45:46] You don't have to bow down. You are a
[1:45:48] son and daughter of God.
[1:45:57] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:46:00] Oh, I say thank you, Lord. I want you to
[1:46:04] think of this. Now, this is why Jesus
[1:46:06] here, he could say in John 3, let me
[1:46:09] just move through it here. In John 3,
[1:46:10] except a man be born again of the
[1:46:12] spirit, he can't enter into the kingdom
[1:46:14] of God. That which is born of the flesh
[1:46:15] is flesh. That which is born of the
[1:46:17] spirit is spirit. Marvel that I said
[1:46:19] unto you, you must be born again.
[1:46:22] speaking of that perfect fellowship,
[1:46:24] that relationship. Because let me remind
[1:46:26] you when Melzdc is here before
[1:46:31] Abraham, he's in theophony form. It's
[1:46:35] the
[1:46:36] word. Remember it first was an attribute
[1:46:40] spirit, but then it became word. In
[1:46:43] Genesis 1 is where the logos, the word
[1:46:48] theophony going forth and it begin to
[1:46:50] brood and create and bring forth. Who
[1:46:54] does Abraham meet? He meets Melzdc.
[1:46:59] He meets the living God in theophony
[1:47:03] form.
[1:47:06] It didn't do nothing to nobody else
[1:47:08] around him. Let me go back to that. It
[1:47:10] didn't do nothing to nobody else around
[1:47:12] them. Everybody else just going about
[1:47:14] their about their time, right? It didn't
[1:47:17] mean nothing to them. You don't read
[1:47:19] anything in there about the rest of them
[1:47:20] like, "Wow, who is this guy?" It was in
[1:47:24] simplicity.
[1:47:26] They didn't recognize the coming of this
[1:47:30] message. And here it is. It's God making
[1:47:33] known to Abraham as he says right here,
[1:47:35] "Blessed be Abram of the most high God,
[1:47:38] possessor of heaven and earth."
[1:47:42] Wow. That's good. You see what he's
[1:47:44] making known to Abraham?
[1:47:46] You were always a part of God.
[1:47:50] You see, that's why this this message
[1:47:52] when it comes to break back all the
[1:47:53] clouds, it breaks back all the
[1:47:55] self-efforts and goodness that you could
[1:47:58] ever bestow. And what does it do? It
[1:48:01] brings the grace of God in plain view.
[1:48:04] Amen. And you know what? when you can we
[1:48:06] can that grace of God begins to break in
[1:48:08] our lives to realize I was always
[1:48:12] one of his. Amen. That's why I've been
[1:48:15] different. Now, you might have tried to
[1:48:16] fit into a lot of different things down
[1:48:17] through life. You might have tried to
[1:48:19] been different and thought you were
[1:48:20] different and everything else, but God
[1:48:23] always knew where you were at.
[1:48:26] Let me tell you something. Just as much
[1:48:27] as Levi was in the loins of Abraham
[1:48:30] here, the Bible said every time when
[1:48:32] brother Ram will deal with
[1:48:33] predestination, he'll take us right back
[1:48:34] there to where Levi paid tithe to Melzdc
[1:48:38] while in the loins of Abraham. In the
[1:48:40] loins of Abraham, you know why he was
[1:48:43] always a part. And here he was always a
[1:48:46] part all the way down through there. And
[1:48:47] how that you and I were always a part of
[1:48:50] God. Praise the Lord. I like how brother
[1:48:52] Ram says it. He says, "You were in your
[1:48:55] natural father. But you don't remember
[1:48:57] it. Right.
[1:49:00] You don't remember it. You don't
[1:49:01] remember being well, you know, I was
[1:49:02] there. I was walk You don't remember
[1:49:03] that. I was walking around, you know, in
[1:49:05] Big Aren. I was walking around. No, you
[1:49:07] don't remember that.
[1:49:09] As a matter of fact, let me bring it
[1:49:10] down to you. You don't even remember the
[1:49:12] day you were born. But you know you've
[1:49:14] been born, right?
[1:49:17] Are you hearing me?
[1:49:19] You may not be able to put your finger
[1:49:20] on and say, "I don't remember the birth,
[1:49:22] but I know I've been born. I see the
[1:49:24] results of it in my life. And you know
[1:49:28] what? Amnesia is breaking away from my
[1:49:31] life. I was always a part of God. That's
[1:49:35] why this word means something to
[1:49:39] you. This is why you were always a part
[1:49:43] of
[1:49:46] God. And in the end time, Melzdc came
[1:49:50] down
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:49:54] Hallelujah.
[1:49:55] And he met you on the way back after the
[1:49:58] battle was won, after laying down your
[1:50:00] life. Lord, I surrender my life. I
[1:50:03] surrender my all. And you have a meeting
[1:50:06] with Mechazedc.
[1:50:08] [Music]
[1:50:09] And he gives to you the bread and wine.
[1:50:12] Hallelujah. What you have need of for
[1:50:14] the rest of your life.
[1:50:17] You love him this morning.
[1:50:20] Hallelujah.
[1:50:21] You were always a part of him. It was
[1:50:25] him that came to bring you into
[1:50:28] fellowship with him.
[1:50:32] This is why we can declare the marriage
[1:50:34] of the lamb is come.
[1:50:39] Hallelujah. It's a better fellowship.
[1:50:42] The marriage of the lamb has come and
[1:50:44] his bride, the lamb's wife,
[1:50:48] she had made herself ready. Amen.
[1:50:51] Glory be to God. I always like how it
[1:50:54] says it. It don't say the lion's wife.
[1:50:55] It says the lamb's wife.
[1:51:00] It comes through a sacrificial
[1:51:02] submissive heart. Then the authority of
[1:51:03] the lion comes through the lamb. Now
[1:51:06] there's authority, a life of authority
[1:51:08] that's lived above sin in your life,
[1:51:09] above unbelief.
[1:51:12] It's the grace of God by true communion.
[1:51:15] A better fellowship. That is so good.
[1:51:17] This is why that when let me just let me
[1:51:20] let me let me let me tie this point
[1:51:21] together here. This is why that in this
[1:51:24] in here in the scripture let me get to
[1:51:26] there's one scripture I want to I want
[1:51:27] to read here at the very at the very
[1:51:29] last part here. This is why the
[1:51:31] scripture says in 1 John
[1:51:33] 5 6 and n this is he that came by water
[1:51:38] and blood even Jesus Christ not by water
[1:51:41] only but by water and blood and it is
[1:51:44] the spirit that beareth witness because
[1:51:47] the spirit is truth for there are three
[1:51:49] that bear record in heaven the father
[1:51:52] the word which is the son and the holy
[1:51:55] ghost and these three are one and there
[1:51:59] are three that bear witness in the
[1:52:00] earth, the spirit, the water, and the
[1:52:02] blood. These three agree in one. If we
[1:52:06] receive the witness of man, the witness
[1:52:08] of God is greater. For this is the
[1:52:10] witness of God, which he had testified
[1:52:13] of his
[1:52:14] son. So the coming of the Holy
[1:52:18] Spirit by way of the message of the
[1:52:21] hour, Melzdc coming down to meet us, the
[1:52:26] son of man right here dwelling with us.
[1:52:29] It's the time of the seal of the Holy
[1:52:33] Ghost.
[1:52:34] That is so good. No other age had this
[1:52:38] seal.
[1:52:40] They had the Holy Ghost, but now is the
[1:52:42] sealing time, the capping hour.
[1:52:46] Because the seal is the person of Christ
[1:52:49] himself. They they had it in a portion,
[1:52:52] but now the seal, this is where it's no
[1:52:56] longer two, but one,
[1:52:59] it's Christ in you. It's Christ in you,
[1:53:04] the hope of glory.
[1:53:07] That's a better fellowship. I I say that
[1:53:10] that that's I I love the fellowship of
[1:53:12] coming around with brothers and sisters
[1:53:14] like Precious Faith, but you know what?
[1:53:16] That just that fellowship alone won't
[1:53:17] get me out of here. No, that's right.
[1:53:20] Oh, I love the truths of the message of
[1:53:23] the hour, but that fellowship alone
[1:53:24] won't get me out of here. I've got to
[1:53:26] become one with the knowledge of the
[1:53:27] truth. Got to become one with the person
[1:53:30] of truth himself of whom all of these
[1:53:34] mysteries have come. Let me just say
[1:53:36] this. When we have been united with him
[1:53:40] as the marriage of the lamb has come, we
[1:53:42] have been granted to be arrayed in the
[1:53:46] fine linen which is the righteousness of
[1:53:48] the saints. Let me tell you, you're not
[1:53:51] displaying your own righteousness.
[1:53:55] You're displaying his righteousness.
[1:53:57] Amen.
[1:53:59] He who knew no sin became sin that we
[1:54:03] might be made the very righteousness of
[1:54:06] God in Christ.
[1:54:08] We are his righteousness. We are his
[1:54:12] workmanship. And this is why that
[1:54:15] through the eating of this word and that
[1:54:17] that revelation that is it comes into
[1:54:19] our life and and the word oh my we can
[1:54:21] fellowship on that as we're taking in
[1:54:23] the word. There's things that my as the
[1:54:25] word it comes as a discerner it'll come
[1:54:27] and discern things and things that just
[1:54:29] slip
[1:54:30] past
[1:54:32] our a discernment if I can say it in
[1:54:34] that way maybe because we get a little
[1:54:36] doll or the cares of life but let me
[1:54:38] just tell you something friends what God
[1:54:40] has started in your life he'll finish it
[1:54:43] and this is why that when the living
[1:54:44] word of God is coming and we're taking
[1:54:46] in that word and listen I know there's
[1:54:48] parts of the lamb I really love
[1:54:50] preaching
[1:54:52] there's parts of the lamb lamb that I
[1:54:54] like preaching. And there's parts of the
[1:54:55] lamb that I really I I it's not that I'm
[1:54:58] against it. It's just it's not real
[1:55:00] comfortable to preach. But remember,
[1:55:02] when you're to eat this lamb is said in
[1:55:04] Exodus 12, you're to eat in the
[1:55:05] pertinance thereof in everything.
[1:55:08] That that that means all that means
[1:55:10] there's things that's going to come to
[1:55:12] us. It's hard. Boy, it's hard to
[1:55:14] swallow. But we know we must eat this
[1:55:17] book.
[1:55:18] Eat this word. If we don't eat it, we
[1:55:21] can't be a part of him. Right? But we
[1:55:23] take that word in and let me tell you,
[1:55:24] we don't have to we we don't have to
[1:55:26] figure out how is this going to happen
[1:55:27] in my life or how's this going to take
[1:55:29] place. Listen, this is why brother Brown
[1:55:31] would say in that same message, who is
[1:55:33] this Melzdc? He said, if you have not
[1:55:36] given yourself to fully feed on the word
[1:55:39] of God to where you can fly above the
[1:55:41] things of the world, will you do so?
[1:55:44] Now,
[1:55:46] you catch what he said? Fully feed. It's
[1:55:50] just feeding because within the word
[1:55:53] there is the strength and the nutrients
[1:55:55] that we have need of. No matter what it
[1:55:58] is in your life, if it's overcoming the
[1:56:00] things of the world, if it's look, you
[1:56:02] know, if it's healing in your life,
[1:56:03] whatever, we've been preaching on
[1:56:04] healing. Remember, there is strength in
[1:56:07] the word of God. I'm not against books
[1:56:09] and everything out there, but I'll tell
[1:56:11] you what, nothing can beat getting
[1:56:13] before God on our knees and taking
[1:56:16] taking going to God in prayer and eating
[1:56:19] on the word of God. Brother Samuel,
[1:56:21] sometimes I don't feel anything. But
[1:56:23] listen, you don't have to feel
[1:56:25] something. The thing the thing the thing
[1:56:27] it comes down to is is that do you
[1:56:29] believe it? And if you believe it, then
[1:56:32] receive it. And don't look at whether
[1:56:35] you're worthy or not. Listen to the
[1:56:38] words that the father is speaking
[1:56:40] concerning your life. Come on now.
[1:56:42] That's right. And let him do his work in
[1:56:46] your life. Every one of us here, I
[1:56:49] believe, want a deeper walk with God.
[1:56:54] I just was listening to it here here the
[1:56:56] other day where brother Bram said, "Oh
[1:56:57] God, matter of fact, just yesterday he
[1:57:00] said, "Lord, let every fiber of our
[1:57:02] being be filled for the rapture." Yes.
[1:57:05] Amen. I want every fiber field. Don't
[1:57:07] you? I want a I want a I I want a deeper
[1:57:10] fellowship. I want a a closer I I
[1:57:12] believe I I I believe I've got the Holy
[1:57:14] Ghost. I I know I believe what what he's
[1:57:16] done in my life, but I want more of him.
[1:57:19] I want more of him. I want more of Jesus
[1:57:21] to take over more of Samuel. Cuz I tell
[1:57:23] you, the biggest enemy I got and I don't
[1:57:25] got problems with other people. You
[1:57:26] know, the problem I got is with Samuel.
[1:57:29] My problems, your problems ain't other
[1:57:30] people. Your problem is the person we
[1:57:32] look at in the mirror. That is so true.
[1:57:34] And God allows those situation. Why do
[1:57:36] why do they have to do that? It just
[1:57:37] lets you know you need more of Jesus in
[1:57:40] your life. You need a deeper fellowship.
[1:57:43] Jesus said, "Take my yoke upon you and
[1:57:46] my burdens. They are light."
[1:57:50] Hallelujah. This yoke is not filled with
[1:57:53] splinters. Oh, it's filled with the love
[1:57:56] of God.
[1:57:58] But you see the whole key to everything
[1:58:00] in our life, every victory, every trial
[1:58:02] is just get deeper in Jesus. You see,
[1:58:05] how do I do that? Well, I'm going to,
[1:58:06] you know, I'm just going to take an hour
[1:58:08] today or two hours a day. You don't have
[1:58:09] to be radical. You just have to be a
[1:58:12] believer.
[1:58:14] It might require giving a little bit
[1:58:15] more time or realizing there's some time
[1:58:18] I could redeem.
[1:58:21] Instead of this much time on on YouTube,
[1:58:24] I can redeem some time. In other words,
[1:58:27] take back what the enemyy's tried to
[1:58:29] take from me. Take back what he's tried
[1:58:31] to ste. It's I'm here to redeem the
[1:58:33] time. And you know whose responsibility
[1:58:35] that comes to? You and I. And let me
[1:58:37] just tell you something. Greater is he
[1:58:39] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:58:41] world.
[1:58:42] When he comes to show those things up in
[1:58:44] our life, that's his love.
[1:58:47] Don't you love him? Oh, thank God for
[1:58:50] true communion.
[1:58:52] A true communion where he walks with me.
[1:58:54] He talks with me. Amen. Amen. Don't you
[1:58:57] love him? Lord. Amen. Amen. Why don't
[1:59:01] musician, why don't you come and um I'll
[1:59:04] just have maybe maybe Ben, why don't you
[1:59:06] just come and and uh play a song and
[1:59:10] just in maybe as every head is bowed
[1:59:12] before I would read from communion. And
[1:59:14] I'm going to also ask that you know I
[1:59:17] know we may have some visitors and
[1:59:18] different ones with us. And uh you know
[1:59:21] this is not a a closed communion but I
[1:59:23] want you to remember that you don't come
[1:59:25] to take communion that you might be
[1:59:27] saved or I want to make sure that I'm
[1:59:30] right with God. No that's communion
[1:59:32] itself is remember only an outward sign
[1:59:36] that
[1:59:38] everything is good with me and
[1:59:43] Jesus every day. every day. He's He's my
[1:59:50] life and I I want to I want to express
[1:59:54] it. I want to as an outward symbol, I
[1:59:56] want to express what he is to me in my
[1:59:59] life
[2:00:00] daily. So, as our head is bowed
[2:00:02] and maybe you got a request upon your
[2:00:05] heart, a need, you'd like to make it
[2:00:08] known to the Lord. Maybe you've got a
[2:00:10] need. Maybe it's for a besetting sin in
[2:00:13] your life. Maybe you've got a request
[2:00:16] that Lord, I want to be I want to be
[2:00:18] saved. Maybe there's someone here. You
[2:00:20] have not even turned your life over to
[2:00:22] the Lord, but you'd like to make that
[2:00:24] start this morning. I tell you, God's
[2:00:26] more than able. Don't Don't look at
[2:00:29] yourself. You might say, "Brother
[2:00:30] Samuel, you don't know all kinds of
[2:00:32] habits I got in my life." Let me tell
[2:00:33] you, you've heard my testimony. I could
[2:00:35] call different ones of this congregation
[2:00:37] up right
[2:00:40] now that they something caught a hold of
[2:00:43] their life and they turned themselves
[2:00:45] over to the
[2:00:47] Lord. They still had habits in their
[2:00:51] life. Still had some
[2:00:54] smoked other things. But let me tell you
[2:00:56] something. I think of Sister Joe
[2:00:59] Keithley for some years. And I'm not
[2:01:01] saying you got to go to years down the
[2:01:02] road, but I'll tell you, I never forget
[2:01:04] it. She hung right
[2:01:06] on. Yes, she was smoking them
[2:01:08] cigarettes, but they weren't She wasn't
[2:01:09] doing it out just to be in defiance. But
[2:01:11] you know what? She kept testifying,
[2:01:13] "God's my deliverer." Let me just tell
[2:01:14] you something. Her deliverance fully
[2:01:16] came. The seal of the living God fully
[2:01:19] come. Let me Don't worry about trying to
[2:01:20] clean your life up. You can't do it. Let
[2:01:23] the grace of God come to your life. Let
[2:01:26] the grace of God turn your heart around.
[2:01:29] Let let him begin to bring you into a
[2:01:31] place of fellowship. It may it may it
[2:01:33] may not be that of the fellowship that
[2:01:35] we're talking of this morning, but this
[2:01:37] is where and how we enter into
[2:01:41] that. This is how we come into
[2:01:47] it. I wonder is there one this morning,
[2:01:50] I know there were other hands raised
[2:01:51] before, but let me just speak
[2:01:52] specifically to that. Is there one this
[2:01:54] morning that would say,
[2:01:56] "Lord, I want to come home. I want to
[2:01:59] lay down my life. I want to
[2:02:03] repent. I don't ever want to take that
[2:02:05] away in this this kind of a service like
[2:02:07] this. Cuz there might be someone
[2:02:08] here maybe maybe you're sitting here
[2:02:11] this morning and you've kind of went
[2:02:12] wayward with
[2:02:14] God. You've kind of let your fellowship
[2:02:16] it's well it's almost become like
[2:02:21] cold. You really don't almost know what
[2:02:24] to say. You sit across the table from
[2:02:26] one another. But you say,
[2:02:28] "Lord, I want to renew that fellowship
[2:02:30] and not just back to where I was, but I
[2:02:32] want to go on,
[2:02:34] Lord. I want to go
[2:02:36] on." Anybody want to say that, "Lord, I
[2:02:40] want to go deeper, Lord." Oh, don't be
[2:02:42] ashamed, friends. He's not ashamed to
[2:02:44] speak to us here this morning. He's not
[2:02:46] looking down on us. If you say, "Oh,
[2:02:48] Lord, I've gotten a little cold. I need
[2:02:50] to be I need Lord, I want to be closer
[2:02:51] to you." Oh, that's just that's the
[2:02:53] rays. You know what's making that? It's
[2:02:55] the warming rays.
[2:02:57] of the son of righteousness. He's
[2:02:59] warming your heart by a love
[2:03:02] affair. Maybe right here this morning,
[2:03:04] say,
[2:03:05] "God, I want more of you, Lord. I want
[2:03:10] more." You can put your name in where I
[2:03:12] do. I want more of Jesus to take over
[2:03:14] more of Samuel. I want more of the Holy
[2:03:17] Ghost.
[2:03:19] I want more. Is that your desire this
[2:03:22] morning, Lord? I believe all through
[2:03:24] this building, Lord, I want more.
[2:03:27] Hallelujah. Now remember, we're going to
[2:03:29] go to him in prayer now. We're not
[2:03:31] beggars. We're not slaves. Hallelujah.
[2:03:34] He said, "Ask."
[2:03:36] Ask, Lord. And the word has brought an
[2:03:39] atmosphere of faith that we can ask for
[2:03:42] what we have need of.
[2:03:45] Let's pray. Father,
[2:03:49] in your great mercy,
[2:03:51] Lord, you have just moved down to speak
[2:03:55] to our hearts.
[2:03:58] once again, not just reminding us of who
[2:04:01] we were, where you brought us from, that
[2:04:05] we were always a part of you, but God is
[2:04:07] your spirit even going through the
[2:04:10] word, wooing to hearts and lives,
[2:04:14] calling hearts, Lord, to a place of
[2:04:17] surrender, calling us into a deeper
[2:04:20] fellowship. Lord, I've got confidence in
[2:04:24] you.
[2:04:26] I have absolute confidence in this word.
[2:04:30] You'll not lose one. Amen. I have
[2:04:34] confidence, Lord, that Father, you're
[2:04:38] the same God that put squirrels where
[2:04:40] there were no squirrels. You're the same
[2:04:43] God that caused two little boys to fall
[2:04:46] across Sister Hadtie's lap. You're the
[2:04:49] same God who turned a storm around. Yes,
[2:04:52] Lord Jesus, your
[2:04:54] word is all
[2:04:57] powerful. An atmosphere has been
[2:04:59] created,
[2:05:00] Lord. Now, Lord, we as your children by
[2:05:04] the grace of God, by the blood of our
[2:05:07] Lord Jesus Christ. Oh,
[2:05:10] hallelujah. Lord Jesus, there's many
[2:05:14] petitions among us. There's many
[2:05:17] desires. Now Lord, you see every need.
[2:05:21] Behind every hand, many things were
[2:05:24] spoken, things were said. But Lord,
[2:05:27] you've come to have a personal meeting
[2:05:30] now. Lord, we take every one of these
[2:05:32] requests. Everyone, Lord, that has been
[2:05:35] spoken out with hands. Lord, from the
[2:05:37] hearts, Lord, I want a closer walk with
[2:05:41] you. Lord, I want a deeper fellowship.
[2:05:44] Lord, I want to be like Enoch where I
[2:05:46] get so close to
[2:05:48] you to like Enoch. You just took him on
[2:05:51] home. He got closer to your house than
[2:05:55] he was to his own. Oh God, help us. May
[2:05:59] we get closer to your
[2:06:03] house than our own,
[2:06:06] Lord. Lord
[2:06:08] Jesus, we give ourselves to
[2:06:11] you. May the presence of Almighty God
[2:06:14] just have your way, Father, in the
[2:06:17] remaining part of this
[2:06:19] service. We commit it all, Lord, into
[2:06:21] your
[2:06:23] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:06:26] Christ. Amen.
[2:06:30] [Music]
[2:06:43] I believe God I I believe God brings a
[2:06:46] real experience. Don't you? You say,
[2:06:48] "What? What's the experience?" The
[2:06:50] change.
[2:06:51] What's the evidence? You believe.
[2:06:54] And you keep believing and God keeps
[2:06:56] working in your life. You're not. Look
[2:06:59] at your life right now. You're not where
[2:07:00] you used to be. You might even look at
[2:07:02] your life and said, "Man, I had a real
[2:07:04] cold time in my life this many years
[2:07:06] back there." But that's a was, right?
[2:07:09] That's a has been. That's something that
[2:07:11] you look at right now and look back and
[2:07:13] say, "Wow, God in his
[2:07:17] mercy." And when I went through a cold
[2:07:19] time in my life,
[2:07:22] God didn't take the seal from you.
[2:07:26] God never took it from you. God never
[2:07:29] took the Holy Ghost from you.
[2:07:32] The seal was there the whole time.
[2:07:34] Glory. That's why you couldn't be
[2:07:37] content where you were.
[2:07:39] But by God's grace, aren't you thankful
[2:07:41] that you can stand there and look back
[2:07:43] and say, "I had a cold time there."
[2:07:46] There was a time where I where I then,
[2:07:48] you know, went astray in my mind. But
[2:07:49] you're able to stand and understand that
[2:07:52] by God's grace to you right now. Let me
[2:07:54] tell you something that ought to even
[2:07:56] prove to you the hold that God's got on
[2:07:58] your life.
[2:08:00] There's an anchor, my brother, within
[2:08:02] the veil, that hole.
[2:08:05] holds. Don't you love him this morning?
[2:08:08] Oh, I tell you, when we're coming to
[2:08:09] take this communion, when I take a hold
[2:08:12] of that bread, that body, that word that
[2:08:14] was broken open, that word that was
[2:08:17] broken open for you and I, that you and
[2:08:19] I might live, when I take of that wine,
[2:08:22] what do I think about? I think about
[2:08:24] God's grace.
[2:08:26] what he's done in my life, what he's
[2:08:28] doing in my life, how through all parts
[2:08:32] of the journey, only thing I can look
[2:08:34] back and see, it's been him the whole
[2:08:37] time.
[2:08:40] Because he's allowed you to see the
[2:08:42] times that you let go, he was the one
[2:08:44] that had a hold on you.
[2:08:46] It wasn't your strength that's kept you.
[2:08:49] It's his strength that has kept you.
[2:08:54] Oh,
[2:08:55] hallelujah. Glory be to God in the
[2:08:59] highest. Brother Samuel, this is
[2:09:01] different from any communion service I
[2:09:03] belong. Hey, communion service is not a
[2:09:04] morning. It's not a death. It's not a
[2:09:07] funeral. It ought to be a time of
[2:09:09] rejoicing.
[2:09:11] Come on, friends. We're not Roman
[2:09:13] Catholics. We are part of the original
[2:09:16] Catholics, the original universal church
[2:09:19] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:22] Hallelujah. We've got a right to
[2:09:25] worship. We've got a right to say,
[2:09:27] "Worthy is the
[2:09:29] lamb."
[2:09:31] Hallelujah. What he's done in my life,
[2:09:34] what he's doing in my
[2:09:36] life.
[2:09:37] Hallelujah. He that begun this good work
[2:09:40] in me will perform
[2:09:43] it. Hallelujah.
[2:09:46] One of these days, one of these moments
[2:09:49] will be the last bite I take. And that
[2:09:52] last bite will lead me into the change
[2:09:56] of the body. What are you doing? You're
[2:09:58] eating yourself into a body change.
[2:10:03] Hallelujah.
[2:10:06] Hallelujah.
[2:10:09] Hallelujah.
[2:10:12] [Music]
[2:10:14] Oh. Oh my. Maybe let's just sing a
[2:10:16] chorus of that. I'm
[2:10:18] crying.
[2:10:21] Say, oh
[2:10:28] my god.
[2:10:32] [Music]
[2:10:47] Oh Jesus.
[2:10:54] Hallelujah. Oh, let's just worship him.
[2:10:58] Hallelujah. Oh, glory be to God. I'm
[2:11:03] Mechazedc.
[2:11:05] Hallelujah. Elohim.
[2:11:09] Glory my Lord.
[2:11:13] Oh, I lovely Lord Jesus. Almighty
[2:11:18] God.
[2:11:23] Hallelujah. Thou uncolle.
[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:11:37] [Music]
[2:11:39] Praise the Lord.
[2:11:42] Abraham ate that meal that Melzdc gave
[2:11:45] him before he got back home.
[2:11:49] Melzdc met him before he got back home.
[2:11:53] Hallelujah. We have met our Melzdc.
[2:11:57] The Lord Jesus.
[2:11:59] Not only has he come to us here, but he
[2:12:01] promised he would meet us in the
[2:12:05] air. Amen.
[2:12:08] Brother and sister, this message is the
[2:12:11] declaration. It's the token. It's the
[2:12:13] assurance. Everything's all right.
[2:12:17] The debt has been paid.
[2:12:20] There's no leans against the deed. The
[2:12:23] abstract of the Holy Ghost has come.
[2:12:28] Every deed, every lean has been stricken
[2:12:30] off. No matter father, mother, all the
[2:12:33] way down through your life, you can say,
[2:12:35] "Oh, my tree of life. Oh, how bad it
[2:12:38] was." But you're part of another tree.
[2:12:42] None of us have anything in this earth
[2:12:44] to brag on our family tree.
[2:12:47] But you were always a part of the tree
[2:12:49] of life. And that tree of life is Jesus
[2:12:52] Christ, the word.
[2:12:56] Hallelujah, Lord. He came and found you.
[2:12:59] He came and found you. He came and found
[2:13:02] me.
[2:13:04] Glory be to God.
[2:13:07] Oh, don't you love him?
[2:13:11] Amen.
[2:13:13] Maybe Brienne, if you can bring up 1
[2:13:16] Corinthians 11, please
[2:13:18] [Music]
[2:13:21] verse 23.
[2:13:36] Paul said, "For I have received of the
[2:13:38] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[2:13:41] you, that the Lord Jesus the same night
[2:13:44] in which he was betrayed took bread."
[2:13:47] When he had given thanks, he broke it
[2:13:49] and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[2:13:53] which is broken for you. This do in
[2:13:55] remembrance of me." And after the same
[2:13:58] manner also he took the cup and when he
[2:14:00] had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new
[2:14:04] testament in my blood. This do you as
[2:14:07] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[2:14:10] me. For as often as you eat this bread
[2:14:13] and drink this cup, you do show the
[2:14:14] Lord's death till he come. Wherefore,
[2:14:18] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[2:14:20] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[2:14:23] guilty of the body and the blood of the
[2:14:25] Lord. But let a man examine himself, and
[2:14:28] so let him eat of that bread, and drink
[2:14:30] of that cup. For he that eateth and
[2:14:32] drinkketh unworthily eateth and
[2:14:35] drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not
[2:14:38] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[2:14:40] cause many are sick, a weak and sickly
[2:14:44] among you, and many sleep. For if we
[2:14:47] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[2:14:49] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[2:14:52] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[2:14:55] be condemned with the
[2:14:57] world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you
[2:15:00] come together to eat, tear one for
[2:15:05] another. We're just going to bow our
[2:15:07] heads in a maybe in a manner of just
[2:15:10] just a silent prayer and just to pray
[2:15:14] for one another. And and I'm also going
[2:15:16] to ask that if there's any that would
[2:15:18] want to be dismissed at that this time,
[2:15:20] we'll just allow you to be dismissed at
[2:15:22] this time. We love you. God bless you
[2:15:24] and we'd love to see you back. But let's
[2:15:27] just pray for one
[2:15:31] another. Oh
[2:15:33] Jesus. Lord God, grant it. Lord, I pray
[2:15:37] for my brothers, for my sisters, Lord
[2:15:39] Jesus. God, if there's anything, Lord,
[2:15:41] that would not be right or pleasing,
[2:15:43] Lord. Oh God, please forgive us, Lord.
[2:15:46] Purge completely, Lord. I
[2:15:48] pray,
[2:15:50] Lord. Heavenly
[2:15:53] Father, we thank you for your mercy and
[2:15:55] your grace,
[2:15:57] Lord. Lord, we're thankful, God,
[2:16:00] that Lord Jesus, as the song would say,
[2:16:05] blessed
[2:16:06] assurance. Jesus is mine. And oh, what a
[2:16:10] foretaste of glory divine. I'm an heir
[2:16:13] of salvation, purchased of
[2:16:16] God, born of his spirit, bought with his
[2:16:20] blood. This is my story. This is my
[2:16:23] song. Praising my savior all the day
[2:16:27] long. Oh God, how we thank you for your
[2:16:30] mercy.
[2:16:31] I pray heavenly father that Lord that as
[2:16:34] you have watched over your word all the
[2:16:36] way down through time. May you bless
[2:16:38] your children Lord as we would come
[2:16:40] through this line Lord to take Lord of
[2:16:44] the communion Lord in the wine. And I
[2:16:47] pray that God as we come here we
[2:16:49] understand that we're not doing this
[2:16:52] Lord with a hope but Lord it's
[2:16:54] assurance. It's a declaration from our
[2:16:56] heart of what you've done in our lives
[2:16:59] and what you're doing. Lord, I pray that
[2:17:02] God that you would just Lord be with
[2:17:06] those Lord. Maybe those Lord any Lord
[2:17:08] that would have left Lord or would not
[2:17:10] be a partaker. May they be able Lord to
[2:17:12] come into a place to be able to stand
[2:17:15] with an assurance here. Lord I pray in
[2:17:18] some time Lord we know that God that you
[2:17:20] do all things well and Lord we love you.
[2:17:24] It's not our worry. It's not our
[2:17:26] concern. It's not our frustration. We
[2:17:28] just yield, Lord, our lives to you and
[2:17:31] invite that the grace of God would
[2:17:33] fulfill and finish all things, Lord,
[2:17:35] that's needed. May you bless your
[2:17:37] children now, Lord, we pray in the name
[2:17:40] of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen.
[2:17:44] Brothers, if you'll, Brother Carlos, I
[2:17:46] believe you help out with us, too.
[2:17:48] We're going to um as the brothers are
[2:17:50] coming forward, Brother Richard and
[2:17:52] Brother Gomez, and then there's others
[2:17:54] will be dismissing you. Maybe as you can
[2:17:56] play.
