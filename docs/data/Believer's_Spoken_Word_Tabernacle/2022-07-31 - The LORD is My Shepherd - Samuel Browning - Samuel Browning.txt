praise the lord and just a quick announcement here uh happy anniversary to brother samuel and sister kim on august 1st happy anniversary amen i can't hear you it's a few more years of being soon amen the word of god speak as a pastor come to me where did god speak would you pour down like [Music] you're in this [Music] word of god's feet [Music] is [Music] it isn't a privilege to serve the lord amen it's a real no matter like the song that that i know somebody else wrote it but brother bill sings it god is good all the time and all the time god is good no matter what the situation is that's something that we have we have by the grace of god that the holy spirit the love of god is placed in our heart is the real joy of the lord it's not a joy that the world gives because that that joy fluctuates depending on how the nasdaq is doing and how the 401k is doing and how you know our bank accounts that that's the world but the joy of the lord is what sustains us through the midst of tests and trials even when we would get down in our spirit there's a joy within we've got ground and it's good ground to stand upon and to know that i am his and he is mine he's leading me through this that's real joy joy is not bubble dancing i i believe in dancing but real joy is that which is a constant all the way through our life it doesn't matter if the sun is shining or not we might like the sun to shine we might like certain seasons but the joy of the lord i'm so glad it's not dependent upon our feelings the joy of the lord is god himself that's why when nehemiah could speak to the people they would begin to weep and they'd begin to cry we believe the word should deal with our heart the correct way to come to god is first in repentance is that right but then as they begin to as they were crying then the spirit of god caught the transition and said this is a time of joy it's a time of the feast of the tabernacles and you realize right now we're living in the feast of tabernacles these are temporary dwellings is that right and it is the work of the joy of the lord who is our strength in our lives who stabilizes us in the midst of everything yes amen oh my how thankful we are for god's grace and this hour amen i want to just remind you just please be looking for the uh august calendar there'll be some dates and things that are will be on there and also please keep in mind uh next sunday the lord willing brother jack duff will be here with us and ministering and we're just looking forward to that time so we just are just thankful to the grace of god i want to say i'm i'm thankful brother brian had mentioned it and i'm so thankful for my wife 24 years and it's very true i don't know what i would do without her outside of outside of the lord well she's my buddy she's my best friend there's nobody that i like to talk about the word with i've got a lot of friends i've got friends around the world a lot of other ministers and pastors and you as brothers and sisters but nobody nobody and i just i i want to say i just love her just appreciate her and so thankful for the grace of god amen god has given us a privilege to be able to walk together amen in this life and i tell you to think on the other side well i'm glad that it don't end here amen we just walk hand in hand over there we're looking for any moment amen in the twinkling of an eye we shall be changed amen hallelujah we just want to just turn our attention to the word of the lord this morning and just ask that god will just just come and just have his way amen are you happy to be in the house of the lord amen so if you could let's stand and as we prepare to turn in the word we'd like to just go to the lord in a word of prayer perhaps you have a need on your heart unspoken request and you just like to make it known before the lord and just say lord you know my need whether it's for you for someone else god knows and let's just invite him they meant to come here among us i have need i have need i have many needs today and we all we all i'm sure have a need let's just invite him the one who is here to meet our needs father as we just come to you lord in this moment and time that you have given to us lord that a place that even we can come and we can gather where the word of god lord can be preached lord in its sincerity and its power and its glory to take effect upon lives and lord you are mindful lord of every need lord we stand here as believers we we stand lord as children that have witnessed time and time again lord how that god you've come and you've spoke things that either we've been reading or been meditating on and you've just come and you've spoken to questions on our heart you've dissolved doubt and even while the words come forth lord there's been healing virtue that has come lord into the body lord to bring healing to bring deliverance and lord there's hands that are lifted up not only in representation of themselves lord and for needs in their life but there are also other needs that they're standing in oh god lord it does something to us when lord the grace of god has come to us lord and it so changed our life it brings us into that place oh god as priest of god where we stand lord in intercession oh god and interceding prayer god to intercede for loved ones to intercede oh god for those that are sick among us lord father we just lord lift up every need god before you lord him and we just lord declare it that you're the almighty god you're above every situation lord you're above every doctor's report you're above every need lord and we recognize that and we believe that lord and we ask that god with your presence that you'll just lord not only visiting every heart that's gathered here but god hearts that are gathered in other places lord we just send the holy spirit lord to perform that word lord as we're standing lord in on their behalf o god in presenting that need before the throne of god lord we give ourselves to you this morning in this congregation that lord your anointing that your presence that is here now that would just write in upon us lord and speak to our hearts lord in a very personal way face to face with you father we pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen if you'll turn with me in the scriptures here to psalms 23 psalms 23 and a very familiar passage of scripture and i would like to read that entire passage of scripture before we're seated it says a psalm of david the lord is my shepherd i shall not want there's there's some mighty big words there but this is an experience david's declaring the experience from his heart the lord is my shepherd i shall not want i'm satisfied i'm content in him there's nothing that i want besides him and all that i have need of is found in him he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thy prepow preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever amen may god bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated and wonder if you turn with me i think i have it on the screen as well in john chapter one and verse one and i want to just read these scriptures to lay some background of some what we'll try to move into here this morning and i'd like to speak here on a thought and i just i gave the brothers the title the lord is my shepherd but i would like to also if i could have a subtitle in that who is your king who is your king and john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god not something separate not something different but the word was god the same was in the beginning with god and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men in first john chapter 5 verse 6 if i may read that as well first john 5 6 this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood let me just stop here for a moment if he came only by water we're still in our sins there's no way of escape but john under the under the unction of the holy spirit is declaring there has come a perfect blood that is not contaminated of the fall but this is the blood of god peter records it the blood of christ is that right john writes it in john 1 who has loosed us from our sins how could there be a loosening not by water only but by water and by blood not of the blood that was already here from the fall contaminate but god created a blood cell in order to satisfy the ransom for you and i this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost can you read this last part with me these three are one they're not they're not they're not separate it's the same god all along the father the word which is the son and the holy ghost these three are ones so you can't you can't have the father without having the word you can't have the word without having the holy ghost and you can't have the holy ghost without having the father and without having the word you can't have it and there are three verse eight there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one justification will you repent of your sins and you're baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ the name of our sacrifice he who shed his blood for me he who has dealt with my heart and has spoken to me that is justification that's the water the water the preaching of the word is what brings you to the realization of your sins and brings conviction it's the waters of separation and the blood is that which sanctifies us his life as the spirit of god moves into that life and the heart begins to just take the word and just yearning just to live by that word and the word begins to cleanse and purify and sentiments all the work of the holy spirit and then the spirit himself who's been working all along moves and comes to the inside of that life that vessel that he's prepared then these three agree in one because you can be justified without being sanctified you understand justified a person can receive the lord jesus christ as their savior and still be of the world because what what made them do it in the first place is still in there they're smoking their drinking their adultery and all those things are still in there but you see there's a start where the spirit of god begins to deal with that life sanctification is what cleans out the vessel is that right it's the holy spirit it's not our works listen to me now it's not our works it's a holy ghost doing the work it's us yielding to him is that right he's preparing the pathway for himself he doesn't need our help all he needs is our yielding notice if we receive so you could be justified and sanctified and not re and not have the holy ghost it takes it takes a complete work of redemption of justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost you see this is why when you when you when you take things of the world and of the world and teachings and brother jerry i believe he referred to this on thursday nights out of the message you must be born again false teachers bring false births this is why when a person can say here they come in and say well i've accepted the lord jesus christ and the tenants of that church say oh you're born again no that is not born again you first must hear the truth this is scripture after you've heard the truth you are sealed with the holy spirit of promise is that right when paul came to them paul came to some good uh baptist or whatever you'd call it up on acts 19 and said have you received the holy ghost since he believed because this is why the confusion when you find where lives are looking at well i've believed and i must be born again no born again is where there is an absolute change on the inside to believe it starts with that but you must go all the way if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son let me just let me just say just some inspiration here from a couple weeks ago and then throughout the course of this past week and on monday and i'm just setting and i'm just as i've been going through the adoption series and some things we're dealing with on the midweek service and i'm just just pondering many of these things of where that we're standing in this moment and brother branham begins to even in the adoption series of part three it'd be good here over the course of because i don't know if i'll get finished here this morning but to go back and listen to that message he preaches it twice but listen to the one right before he preaches the adoption then you can listen to the other one but brother branham is pulling this inspiration because when he preaches the rejected king he's just had a visitation beyond the curtain of time and what took place there in that moment brother graham said i cannot be the same william branham now brother branham didn't get born again again but there was an experience in the presence of god that it didn't it didn't diminish but it actually stirred up and just made it even more clear and it caused desperation and perseverance to rise within his heart you see that's what every true experience and that's why we need experiences in the presence of god we can't live off of yesterday's experience you say i've had an experience with god if you've had an experience with god where your life has been changed and you pass from death unto life then there is a hunger to have more experiences with god and you must have more experiences with god it's not enough just to have one you see that's not the heart of a believer it's a desire i want more experiences with god because in those experiences there is change that takes place brother and sister we have an access this morning an audience with a king there's no not a middle man we have one mediator between god and man and that's the man christ jesus god himself came down he is our high priest we're not we don't have a middle man in the building this morning our high priest the holy spirit is right here this morning and we can take our request to him give it to him and you know and brother branham when he speaks of this in in the rejected king i i want to go into this and i want this thought as we would look at that who is your king and david declaring here the lord is my shepherd brother branham picks this up here and he says i don't have this on the screen because i'm just going to pull from things it's it's here and and this is right out of the summer church age and brother braham says just as the early church started out under the pure ministry of the holy spirit with signs and wonders manifestations such as prophecy tongues interpretation wisdom knowledge healing so in the days of israel when they left egypt they were under the leadership of the spirit of god manifesting in gifts god was the leader of the people now listen to this actually he was their king he was a father king he took care of israel like a man cares for his family he fed them fought their battles smoothed away their difficulties and settled their problems he just busied himself over them they were the only nation to which he was truly god no wonder that that moses could could could emphasize this to that new generation that it rose up to go into the land to remind them that you have the lord god so nigh unto you that in all things that we call upon him for so all of this of how god was a father king he busied himself he was their king he he fought their battles that did not mean and i think we understand this it did not mean that they were sitting on the sidelines and doing their own thing it meant that they completely trusted god and they trusted his leadership they were engaging with god god was engaging with them and when needs arose they didn't they were looking to god notice god had come so on the scene he had made himself known i am your provider i know they didn't really get it when they first left egypt and and you know they left and they got out there and you know there was a mixed multitude that's sure but sometimes those things can kind of pervade and and how it is around but notice when it came to the red sea and they saw there uh of of the taskmasters in egypt that was coming after him to try to bring him back in bondage notice here god is is showing and making himself known that god is a waymaker and god is going to stand right there and open away that wasn't just for that moment that was to build their faith that no matter what comes around my way he's the same god and it ties back to the blood of the lamb being provided it ties back to the unleavened bread it ties back to the lamb that i am sustained by that they can look back and say god provided a sacrifice for me god provided a way through the red sea for me and they could look to god no matter what the need was god was declaring i am your everything all that you have need of i am your everything i want to do for you but one day they got to looking around now god knows what's in the heart of man because in the book of deuteronomy chapter 17 he said when you get over in the land and you start looking around and you're going to battle then you will say in your heart we need a king like the other nations which we need to be like them see same way it wasn't eden it was an inlet of the eye satan began to get eve to focus there and through that focus it was more than just a sight but that i itself is that of the mental the reasonings and taking and taking it in there to the mind let me say this to you the mind itself does not have life in it but the mind itself is a womb to the spirit you can either take in or take out you know why the devil battles so hard and why that the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind because it's in the mind where decisions are made and every one of us got decisions to make before us it doesn't matter where you're at in your christian walk with god you all we all have decisions to make and god ain't going to make them for us right he didn't make the decision for mary mary made a decision what she did under that anointing that anointing removed fear removed doubt and brought her into cooperation with the vision that was before the foundation of the world that's what the holy spirit is set for to bring us in cooperation that we might come into position that god can fulfill his word through our lives but one day they got to looking around and they saw the philistines and other nations and kings over them i want you to catch this it caught their eyes and they decided that they ought to humanize their leadership so they wanted a king now god was going to listen this now now god was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the lord jesus christ but they got ahead of him the whole fall itself took place in the beginning because at that moment where satan began to interpret multiply and replenish the earth and then what's he doing moving the people ahead of god's program god's program ain't defeated god's program did not suffer a blow dumb devil what he failed to recognize is is through that would release the redemptive attributes of jehovah god hallelujah he was all before there was ever a sickness he was already the healer before you and i were in need of deliverance he was already the deliverer glory be to god notice this they thought so they they wanted to humanize their leadership so they wanted a king now god was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the lord jesus christ but they got ahead of him and satan knew the plan of god so he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of god the word let me just say this and this applies you can put it in your lunchbox and take it with you home never will the spirit of god bring about anxiousness in your life i gotta make this decision that dude writing that right then the first thing to do i'm just giving you stuff to put in the lunch box step away oh brother samuel i'm really trying to decide what color of paint you say god's considered about and concerned about those things god's considered and concerned god rich in mercy god he said is interested in everything you anticipate in that's how much god is interested in we we're believers are we not we're not people that all of a sudden come to church and take god out of a locker and put him on and hang him back up but this is alive this is a reality this is a real substance in our life we're not a christian on thursday and somebody else any day of the week we are christians every day of the week not because we've made ourselves that but because our king has declared his kingship in the throne of our heart and they approached samuel i'm just going to read this and they asked for a king samuel was so dismayed you know this as a bible reader he was dismayed in his heart now samuel you know he took it a little personal but the reality because he was god's spokesman samuel's heart was for the people remember he learned he learned what it was to heed to the voice of god when god would call his name he learned what he was just just come in the presence of god and silence himself and say here i am he learned that samuel knew what he was that it ain't my thoughts these people need they don't need my thoughts oh god let it ring through every building let me tell you something friends thank god for our families but in our families in our homes in our lives what we need is the voice of god not well this is how brownings do it this is how hernandez is doing this is how sanchez is do it this is how the hannahs have always done it this is how no what we need is the voice of almighty god because we are of a different family tree [Applause] because there's some rascals in the brownings and if not for the grace of god right here too right here too and you can go ahead and look in the mirror and i say a man for him every one of us it isn't that oh boy i'll tell you what there's some real good people it's the holy ghost there is none good but god [Applause] but samuel that's pretty simple i know but i just got to say it as he gives it god had been leading his people listen this through this consecrated scripture vindicated prophet and he felt that he had been rejected he gathered the people pleaded with them not to turn away from god who had carried them away who had carried them like children think of it god god carried them like children that's the scripture as a father doth this child god carried them at times when they couldn't walk we'll pick that up in some of the family services here but god carried them as a father to care for his children when the times hey listen he does the same thing for you and i there's times where we can't walk and he comes along and he carries us we have never got too big to come into the arms of jehovah we still need the leading and the care of almighty god hallelujah we're not of this spirit here that says i have need of nothing but we're able to stand there and say lord i need you to pick me up right now lord [Applause] you're my king i need you to pick me up right now oh god i'm glad i'm with number with people who believe that god is that personal and who know him to be that personal he's not setting way off his hand has been stretched down to us in this generation this word has become flesh in this generation the arm of the lord hath been revealed the power the strength the glory of god has been revealed and his eye is present to guide us god personified in his people he gathered the people he pleaded with them not to turn away from god he couldn't see samuel couldn't make the decision for him he couldn't say you're not going to do this he knew samuel knew their decision he knew that it was wrong because it was with the wrong motives the wrong objectives it was looking at something else and let me say this to you if you've got your eyes on anybody you better make sure it's christ that you're following [Music] you better make sure they're following christ well my mama you better make sure mama's following christ well my dad you better make sure daddy's following christ well my pastor you better make sure your pastor is following christ paul said follow me as i follow christ in other words with that same surrenderedness and sensitivity and desire for his leading you're to follow in the same way we're just saying what are you saying i'm saying it's time by god's grace for certain cycles to be broken and i'll tell you who's the cycle breaker is the holy ghost he breaks all kinds of strings and everything else that can be right down in a family and this this family's been like this but the holy ghost comes down on the sea brother what does he do he takes us and we are grafted into the tree of life and we begin not to produce our natural fruit but we have overcoming strength and grace and it's the fruit of jesus christ that begins to move throughout our life all grace he prospered them blessed blessed them but they persisted they said to samuel i want you to notice how brother brown just paraphrases this right from the scripture you've never been wrong in your lead you have never been dishonest in your financial dealings you have done your best to keep us in line with the word of the lord we appreciate the miracles wisdom provision and protection of god we believe in it we like it and furthermore we don't want to be without it it's just that we want a king to lead us into battle how's that old saying go you want your cake and eat it too we like we we we don't want the miracles to stop we don't want the signs and wonders we don't want the blessings we don't want all those provisions but it's just we want a king to lead us to battle well pray tell how do you think you won them battles because you weren't skilled as soldiers we're not talking ratios that make sense one sends a thousandth of light two ten thousand that doesn't make sense humanly that don't make sense we're talking about a group of people they did not have that of weaponry but they had a greater weapon hallelujah they had the word of the lord that had been delivered to him they had a greater weapon now of course when we go out to battle this is them talking when we go out to battle it's still our intention to have the priests go ahead with judah following and we will blow the trumpets and shouting so in other words it all looks the same we don't intend to stop any of that but we want a king who is one of us to lead us that's the problem we needed a king to lead us who's one of us but not one of us not one who has the same nature as us but we need one who's greater we need one who's a real king that's what we really need are you with me those are my words and god said to samuel see they have not rejected you but they've rejected me from ruling over them so you see they had all this other thing that you know the songs were going for can i just bring it on down they were still opening up the hymnals to amazing grace they were still opening you know the hymnals i shall not be moved and all of the hymns and our mighty fortresses are god and all the songs they were still singing and conducting their prayer services and they still had signs and miracles and things among them but what they failed to realize is when you reject him you've rejected everything and songs and signs and miracles without him mean nothing he is what means everything. that's why when brother branham could stand in the church ages and say when people you know they're pulling this way about gifts and pulling this way and it's so clearly laid out in the message of the hour and he makes a statement he says i wonder are we sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst the chasing after all these other things when if you have him all these other things are there and your life is not lived based on those things but your life is lived from him for he is the bread of life he is our life oh my little did they realize when they were asking god to let him be like the rest of the world they were rejecting him because god had ordained that his people act different from the world how many know that's true god has ordained that his people act different from the world it's like the saying goes if it if it barks like a dog walks like a dog it's a dog that ain't really anything real hard if it meows and it you know presses around and curls its tail and one or more it's a cat how do you know it by its characteristics and the characteristics are only a testimony of the character of life that's on the inside well let's bring it on down if it looks like a son of god acts like a son of god talks like a son of god lives like a son of god then it's a son of god a life that's lived by the word not god had ordained that his people act different from the world they are not of the world and they don't look like the world they don't act like the world they are crucified under the world and the world is crucified unto them second corinthians 6 17 verse 17 to 18 wherefore come out from among them and be you separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty so there's a difference let's say that together there's a difference let's say it again there's a difference god made a distinction between light and darkness in the beginning god made a distinction in egypt the bible says when it came time for the death they know angel to pass by and the blood of the lamb was to be taken and applied upon the lentils and the doorposts that the bible says that they will know how the lord doth make a difference it's not you making a difference it's not you making yourself different please understand me that'll only last for so long because it's your strength well i i want god to be the king of my life but he can't be king while you're still in power you understand you can't pick and choose from the word and declare him to be your king because it is not you can't add or take away from it and the word be the king in your life hello somebody you see this is why when it comes up to it then the bible says you see the one difference between israel and the rest of the nations was god you put god to one side and israel was like any other nation when samson cut off his hair he was like any other man right he whipped thousands of philistines went in his hair being a nazarite vow under the spirit of god coming upon him it was not samson's strength samson didn't look like arnold schwarzenegger samson was not on bodybuilding usa he was a curly-headed little shrimp you say brother samuel how can you say it well first of all because the prophet said it second of all the pattern in the scripture says god will never share his glory with nobody god didn't need the human strength of a man it was a man that was small but he was yielded and when the spirit of god said go pick up that jawbone he just obeyed and in obedience he leveled them philistines [Applause] you don't have to be a great big somebody or you got to be as a yielded vessel in obedience to god and there's not a devil can stand before you hallelujah notice this he said when samson cut off his hair he was like any other man you put the leadership of the holy ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with god's name attached to it the world and the church are all of the same lump just like jacob and esau were of the same parents but the spirit of god makes the difference it doesn't matter if you call yourself a christian anyone can do that glory yeah when i you when i'm laughing i'm just enjoying the word is that all right like brother dan daisley said he said when i laughed he said what it is there's a big old feather on the inside it just it goes back and forth and just kind of tickled me i just appreciate how the word comes out and talks to you hallelujah i'm just you know when i come in and preach i'm just like i am at home or like i am in my office i ain't no different except i may be well i can't say i don't scream as loud but you know it's just a wonderful thing when the word it speaks to us it doesn't matter if you call yourself a christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the spirit of god in you for without the spirit you're a reprobate you're none of his now may i may i just drop this here in john 14. let me just try to to lay this in here in john 14. you see in the message before i read this in the message first in 1965 brother brabham says you can tell you can tell who's on the throne of your heart by the desire you have within you because that of christ on the inside of that life it'll produce a desire for more of god i know that's simple but i like that's what the message is the message made it very simple it's in the scriptures right here can we read in john 14 chapter john 14 and verse 18. now there's three portions of scripture but i'm just going to read this one i'm going to read here a few verses and i i just want to just read these and coming to a point i will not this is the lord jesus before his departure i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you now here they're hearing a human voice but it's not a human voice it's god speaking through that veil that i am going to come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because i live you shall live also i'm gonna pay the price and they didn't understand this at that time is that right and you and i didn't understand it until god began to deal with our heart and then the holy ghost comes and guess what he makes it more and more and more real to your heart is that right but because i live and that i have rose up on that easter morning that i triumph over death hell in the grave because i live you shall live also you see the word was prophesying of its coming in the flesh and lives of the believers you shall live also well i thought i am alive but we're not alive in christ we are walking around as dead men alive to the world but we're dead that soul that liveth in pleasure it dies is that right the pleasures of sin is but for a season right hallelujah we all can listen for him i don't care i don't care who your daddy and mommy is we all come into this world by that first birth we got another king on the heart we have a king that's there because of the deception that took place in the garden of eden let me ask you a question why did it have to be a virgin birth that ain't just something thrown out there why did it have to be a virgin birth free from human instrumentality tell me why it had to be that way because it had to be a blood that was not tied to that of the fallen race but god created a blood cell god came down and he didn't borrow an egg from mary but god supplied sperm and a a body has thou prepared for me you know why he was doing that he was doing it for our redemption that he could pay the price that you could set in a meeting like this under the anointing of the holy ghost and say boo devil you've kept this from me long enough and i am not going to stand for it no longer i realize that my redemption is more than going to a church my redemption is a union with jesus christ where the king of glory writes in in power hallelujah verse 20. can you just bear with me on these verses at that day say out that day with me that's this day ye shall know the understanding notice jesus was prophesying he knew there was going to come a falling away he knew that that of that white horse rider would enter in he knew they would surrender the creeds not the real elect are you hearing me now not the real elect every one of those seven ages they've received their baptism of the holy spirit because seven days you must eat unleavened bread are you hearing me so god god gave his word in that age now just stay with me a minute god gave his word in that age but yet we realized after the after things had begun to fall right there as they entered that ephesian age there were other things that began to enter and there was truth that was lost but when god begin to restore that first part of unleavened bread is that of where that the just shall live by faith but when men added their own ideas to luther's message then it became leavened long as they stayed with the word that god gave that was unleavened bread amen is that all right it's the same now in this time we are not living by partial light well i thought there should have been a bigger amen than that if there's anything we should have been shouting and dancing on it should be that that reality because we have received in this hour not the mind of a man we have received a perfect interpretation of the word of god delivered by the holy ghost himself [Applause] you see this is that time of adoption this is that urgency that the prophet ties in with the rejected king and he said god in this hour is going to raise up men that are anointed with the same spirit of god that had come back to the word that the church might be positioned in its adoption your rightful position my my my i feel like shouting a little bit glory be to god you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me so god's speaking to your heart to take that word and begin to nourish begin to feed upon that word begin to pray over the word you're receiving in the services no matter where you're at but even in those that are even in your beginnings of your journey is taking that word in you see friends listen if the word stops here it does you no good oh brother samuel i want to leave i want to live deeper you take the word that god is ministering to us there's things that we can read in the word of god and we know thou shalt not do this and thou shalt not do that but god promised that he would provide shepherds and apostles and prophets and teachers and that is for as the prophet said the scriptural teaching and setting it together of the word of god we need the discernment of the holy spirit is that right so within within that that being said then we take that word into our life and and if it's only just coming to church we are missing the part and we're not doing what we should be doing and that's why the word's not having the effect that it should be having let me read on and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father o glory and i will love him and will manifest myself to him judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world how are you going to do this jesus answered and said if a man loved me who's a me it's a person right a person if a man loved me the person of jesus christ who is that the holy ghost who is that the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god if a man loved me he will keep my words so here god beginning god dealing with a life god dealing with our hearts if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him oh i love that wish i could preach on that ween hour we will make we will come unto him and make our abode with him brother samuel that's two separate people it is not the father the word and the holy ghost these three are one it is the spirit and truth they that worship god must worship him in spirit and in truth just to have the word without the spirit is not perfect worship just to have the spirit without the word is not perfect worship but must worship him in spirit and in truth that's the king he that loveth me not keepeth not my saying in other words just kind of just disregard them and the word which you hear is not mine but the father fathers which sent me see he is the word he is the word made flesh the promise made alive and vindicated these things i've spoken to you unto you being yet present but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name now i'm not just talking about somebody just saying the name of jesus christ the name is the characteristic of a person i know it's very simple when i was teaching school and they could say you got i won't call them names but you got so and so i want to know is that so and so i want to know the surname because i know a lot of these what's the surname and sometimes you hear the surname oh lord jesus help me sometimes you hear the surname and it's like glory to god they might have been worse you don't even know though you know what i mean because sometimes you want to know who is this you're talking about and that when we talk about the holy ghost the comforter he sends in his name what is his name the bible says revelations chapter 19 on his vesture was wrote on king of kings lord of lords and his name is called not his but it's called the word of god so when the word of god is being preached that's the name of god he's writing in in power [Applause] oh i want to preach on the dollar zion here a moment [Music] glory be to god in the highest but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you he letting him know the things that you don't understand you'll understand when he has come and i am your parent i am your father i am your king i'm gonna lead you into all truth you don't have to be frustrated you don't have to try to find your own way i'm your king i'll lead you i'm here to take care of you i'm here to lead you all the way i am your comfort i am your shepherd hallelujah [Applause] who is our king the lord jesus christ the holy spirit has come down to take his rightful position in our hearts let's pray heavenly father lord this is our desire everyone lord as we are gathered here may this be a question that is very very clear clearly answered in the heart of every person who is your king who is your king lord we declare from our hearts i can declare from my heart as a redeemed subject there's a life that's been changed as a life others can join me lord with this and it's a testimony to others sitting here that your grace is sufficient lord that at one time we were under the domain of another kingdom lord moved about by the prince and power of the air but o heavenly father we didn't seek you out you came and sought us out lord just as a shepherd will go you laid it out in your word a shepherd would leave the 90-9 and go hunt down that one lord you have been and you are still so personal in each of our lives then lord when we had went astray you came and you found us even lord even now when lord of heart our life though they may go astray in their spirit or in their mind but you restore us our soul oh god how how how precious this is more than just a scripture this is my life this is our life the lord is my shepherd i shall not want i may have many needs but i shall not want because he's the one who's leading he's my shepherd he knows just what i have need of lord how you've rode into our lives with such grace and sweetness and authority and dismantling lord the hold of that former kingdom that king that was there that influence upon our life that lord caused us to act like the world oh there may be lives lord that never drank at all never smoked or maybe they never ran around at all maybe there's a maybe lord sitting here that it could be such a pristine life but it's it's more than that lord it's more than good morality it's more than well i made always this best choice in lord thankful that there's not scars that's there but that in itself that life is still in need of a change of kingship lord to where when the king of kings has come to the inside is moved in that life that life is no longer lived for itself no longer lived for its own desires but it's you lord it's you that we live for it's you that we love lord it's you lord it's your your word lord it's it's all of you we we love you lord i pray if there's one here this morning that it's not been that way in their life and they there's another there's another answer that they have when it's declared who is your king may they begin right here in this moment lord to entertain you if you love me then keep my commandments if you just to fall in love with him to realize he's not a he's not a letter on a page he's a person desiring relationship with you he wants to be your king he doesn't want to dominate your life he wants to be your king to lead you to give to you life more abundantly oh father oh heavenly father grant that lord this morning lord may lord lives that are here the lord throughout this building that you could say lord just continue to mold me and make me let the king who the king who is residing in the throne of my heart that character of life within me lord continue to mold me lord and shape me guiding me into all truth lord lord breaking patterns that maybe have been patterns down through family life patterns down through but go on your present as the king to break earthly patterns and that lord it might be heavenly patterns because it's heavenly patterns that you'll come and dwell in lord granted father we pray this morning lord in the name of jesus christ hallelujah amen amen would say lord that's me who is your king i i can't answer that the prophet can't answer that nobody else can answer that only you can answer that who is your king you see that's what this this message never came to make a man a king are you hearing me it never came to make a manna king a church a king this message came to declare who our king is and that he is here that choices that have been made to keep him out from the people sow everything off and and keep him veiled from the people but he has come and he has rent the veil just as he rent the veil where he tore down the middle wall of partition he himself came in this generation to bring sons and daughters of god back into full adoption back into a place that you can know god as a personal god not as a church relationship not as a scribe of tenets and we believe this and we believe that and we believe this it's more than that that's not who jesus is jesus christ is a person [Music] hallelujah and just as much as that seed life will move within your life and you allow it it will produce every word that is given right here because if that is the life of the word working in your life that's why when you hear the term the message this is not a term that's been coined by william branham that's a scriptural term are you with me the bible says in the book of haggai hag the lord's messenger spake in the lord's message same i am with thee it's a message not from a seminary amen it's a message from the throne of god the seven stars are in his right hand what are they doing they are reflecting him into the church [Applause] it's him that's being revealed to you and i not a church teaching a church teaching will leave you in your sins it'll leave you struggling and fighting and trying to get it because why it's based still on that first kingship [Applause] this is why when people come to a place and oh this is too tight for me this is too hard i gotta find a church that allows us to go to movies i gotta find us a church that it's all right to flirt with women i gotta find us a church where it's all right to smoke and drink you can find one but remember when you do that you reject him you can find plenty of them but remember the reason they got to looking at the world and if you look at the world wherever you look at is where you're going to go are you hearing me you say what are you saying i'm saying get back in step get your eyes off the world get back in step [Applause] satan can try to send distractions in your life loved ones and everything else oh we ought to pray for our loved ones but don't get your eyes on anything but jesus christ [Music] let me tell you something when i married that little lady right there i never had to take my eyes off jesus to marry her are you hearing me you know where i found her i found her in jesus [Applause] are you hearing me now well i know that that's a lunch box that's right down the lunchbox teacher and right there it brings a rat down where the rubber meets the road you don't have to try to be anxious and looking for this and looking for that get your eyes off facebook get your eyes off twitter get your eyes off all that stuff and keep your eyes on jesus looking to the author and the finisher of our faith [Music] hallelujah all those other things trying to pressure you and what you look at you'll find yourself drifting too keep your eyes keep steady keep your eyes on jesus oh i can handle this brother samuel no you can't no you can't no you can't you can't handle it with this age right here let me tell you something without jesus christ the spirits in this age we are no match for those spirits blood with jesus [Applause] but with jesus i can do all things through him who strengtheneth me that's my kingdom that's my kingdom i said that's my king glory be to god my i could continue to go but let's just let's worship him hallelujah you need prayer this morning we're here to pray with you and make a surrender make a surrender this morning amen let's surrender let's let him be the king of our life invite him in because let me tell you something he's not way out there he's right there next to you he's right there next to you as a matter of fact brother brown would say it like this in a message one this he said he's trying to press his way into [Applause] [Music] everybody say with me he's a person he's not a doctrine he's the person of jesus christ that's why we're not trying to learn people anything we're not trying to learn people but it's to meet jesus christ and when you meet him you've got everything you've got all you have need of you've got strength that when trials come up you've got a power on the inside like an engine on a boat that's able to cut right through the reeds there might be times you'll get stuck but you've got a power on the inside what is that power it's the king [Music] and when this word has come by your pathway to something about a believer that seed on the inside says who is this king of glory [Applause] who is this king of glory you say brother samuel that's that that's way off up there but remember when he entered he entered according to the path of the word you and i are in the path of the prophesied word and when the word has come across our pathway we don't know how to describe it we don't know what we don't know how to put it into words but something rises in our hearts who is this king of glory the lord mighty in battle [Music] hallelujah and he comes riding in in power in our life he dismantles the whole of sin he breaks the yoke of bondage he tears down the walls of fear he destroys doubt and unbelief and he gives a real assurance i am the comforter [Applause] let's see hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's stand here hallelujah let's worship him can we worship him i feel like i don't know about you but i feel like when he when he rode in in jerusalem they begin to take off their garments and begin to put palm leaves down and begin to let him down you know that was a type of when we see him coming in we recognize who he is it's a laying down of our life right in in power lord jesus write in in power lord it's laying down our life not me trying to figure it out not trying to think about it but just lay your life down if you love me keep my commandments talk to him when you even after this service has commenced that's why you continue to talk to him you take those the things that are being said you take it he's a person brother joey i can't go with you when we leave here but he goes with you but something you don't know where i'm at but he does and let me just tell you something he'll go right with you brother samuel i need the holy ghost how are you going to get it unless he comes with you he don't just stop at church and you go on your way and then he's waiting in the church said well i've been waiting you know to give you the holy ghost i've been waiting for me to come in you know but i'll just no he goes with you if you love me keep my commandments right my father and i my father will love you we will come and make our abode not just an anointing and all of a sudden sunday afternoon hits something pulls back off your life and you're the same old person you always was no i'll make my abode so the word goes to work as you're entertaining that word what does the word do the word is moving in your life because you are dying to self that's why you're wrestling it out it's dismantling the hold of everything jacob about your life and in his presence you might be in your bedroom you might you might be in the car i don't know but what do i just say brother say i'm saying he's a person entertain him talk to him wrestle it out with him wrestling it out just isn't here at church but when god has spoke to your life i don't think there's anybody here that says well i just want to remain the same we all want to be changed and you've got to take that word if you love me notice it begins if you love me i think i'll just start very simple i'd say lord help me to love you the right way help me to love you in a way that's not about me putting you in position but that lord you place yourself in your reserved place because your jehovah gyra you provided for yourself i think it's very tremendous how do we know how do i know by the desire of your heart you know who's on the throne of your heart [Music] hallelujah i want to be more like him don't you i want to be more like him hallelujah could we just worship him brother brian would you lead us please
