[41:02] was seeking for you
[41:04] it was you that came seeking for us lord
[41:07] oh god as we see that parallel with
[41:09] david's life it was not david seeking to
[41:12] be king
[41:13] was not david seeking to be anointed but
[41:16] god it was
[41:17] you that sought david out
[41:22] you let it be known that
[41:25] you lord had sought him out
[41:29] even when samuel was standing there
[41:30] talking to saul david didn't know about
[41:33] that conversation
[41:35] but god that conversation of what was
[41:38] had there
[41:40] it came to him and i'm lord looking
[41:43] right now perhaps some of us lord

[43:49] special way
[43:51] in jesus precious name amen
[43:55] amen god bless you i want to
[43:58] look here in the scripture i want to go
[44:00] to ephesians 1.
[44:11] in ephesians 1 verse verse 3.
[44:17] here's paul writing blessed be the god
[44:20] and father
[44:22] of our lord jesus christ who have
[44:25] blessed us with all
[44:26] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[44:30] in christ according as he hath
[44:33] chosen us in him before the foundation
[44:37] of the world
[44:39] that we should be holy and without blame
[44:44] before him in love
[44:47] so we are chosen in him and he
[44:50] is the word we are chosen
[44:55] according that we should be holy and
[44:57] without blame
[44:58] before him in love so
[45:02] in this whole choosing to bring it about
[45:05] it's all a work of redemption it's his
[45:09] work
[45:09] to bring us into this place to where
[45:11] there is absolutely
[45:13] no charge against us
[45:16] now if the old man is still there then
[45:19] there's still a charge
[45:21] the old man can be forgiven but never
[45:25] come to this place of really being
[45:27] justified
[45:29] but you see once it comes this right
[45:31] here is a creation of god
[45:33] to bring us back into himself to where
[45:37] it's no longer the old man there's a new
[45:40] man
[45:41] and so the one who did it no longer
[45:45] is alive and living there there's a new
[45:48] man
[45:49] a new creation amen and we stand before
[45:52] him
[45:53] justified having predestinated us unto
[45:56] the adoption of children
[45:57] by jesus christ to himself according to
[46:01] the good pleasure of his will
[46:03] through the praise of the glory of his
[46:05] grace wherein
[46:06] he hath made us accepted in the beloved
[46:10] in whom we have redemption through his
[46:12] blood
[46:13] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[46:16] riches
[46:17] of his grace wherein he hath abounded
[46:22] toward us in all wisdom and prudence
[46:24] having made known unto us the mystery of
[46:26] his will
[46:27] according to his good pleasure which he
[46:29] hath purposed in himself
[46:31] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[46:34] of times
[46:35] he might gather together in one all
[46:38] things in christ
[46:40] both which are in heaven and which are
[46:42] on earth
[46:43] even in him in whom also
[46:46] we have obtained an inheritance
[46:51] being predestinated according to the
[46:54] purpose of him
[46:55] who worketh all things after the counsel
[46:59] of his own will that we should be
[47:02] to the praise of his glory who first
[47:06] trusted in christ may god bless you
[47:10] bless the word as you're being seated
[47:13] this inheritance as we as we've been
[47:17] looking at this and taking that word
[47:20] an inheritance it's something that
[47:23] belongs to you it's not something that
[47:28] you
[47:29] were to receive or even to
[47:32] go after as though it doesn't belong to
[47:36] you
[47:38] but you it is what god has
[47:41] has already designated before the
[47:44] foundation of the world
[47:46] it's that of himself that of his
[47:50] genes of his children that were in him
[47:53] and he is the word that inheritance is
[47:56] that
[47:57] you and i would come back to be a son
[48:01] and daughter of god not just not just
[48:04] one that is uh of acclaiming
[48:07] but where it is a real reality to where
[48:11] just as you are and myself manifestation
[48:14] of
[48:15] our earthly parents and it's not
[48:18] something that we're doing but
[48:20] it's it's it's it's a manifestation of
[48:22] their uh
[48:23] between father and mother it is the same
[48:26] with god that we would come into that
[48:28] inheritance that that
[48:30] seed as we've spoke about that what god
[48:33] placed within
[48:34] us that choosing from before the
[48:36] foundation of the world
[48:38] now as we come into this earth as soon
[48:40] as we come
[48:41] from our mother there and breathing that
[48:44] breath of life
[48:45] god has placed that seed within us it
[48:48] was there
[48:48] within us the whole time but it was as
[48:51] paul would write
[48:52] it was dead it was as it was the seed it
[48:56] was not living
[48:57] it was that part that was waiting for
[49:00] the spirit of god
[49:02] to come upon it to quicken it to make it
[49:05] alive
[49:06] the spirit of god is what coming upon
[49:08] the seed
[49:09] it is that which then begins to unfold
[49:13] our inheritance what really belongs to
[49:15] us in other words the life that we
[49:18] should have had
[49:19] you and i could not get back to that
[49:21] life after the fall
[49:23] but he himself who is the tree of life
[49:27] came to you and i he came and made
[49:30] a way that we could come back
[49:33] into the glory of being sons and
[49:37] daughters of god
[49:38] he made a way
[49:41] and so the inheritance that we are
[49:43] called back to
[49:44] is that of a sonship to be a son and
[49:47] daughter of god and this is where
[49:49] what we've been looking at is that
[49:51] redemption of sons and daughters of god
[49:54] because it's to operate it's with that
[49:57] reality
[49:58] in our heart that then puts us in a
[50:00] place of operating
[50:02] by perfect faith it puts us in a place
[50:04] that
[50:05] when we're praying about things and you
[50:07] don't know which way to turn you don't
[50:09] know which way to go
[50:10] you're in a place as brother branham
[50:11] would say in perfect faith
[50:13] then you're in position to receive faith
[50:17] you're in a place to where you know
[50:19] these these are
[50:20] the rights and privileges as a son and
[50:23] daughter of god
[50:24] and lord i don't know what's going to
[50:26] take place or
[50:27] how it's going to take place but i'm
[50:29] going to stand here
[50:30] upon your word because you are
[50:33] true and as david said thou hast exalted
[50:37] thy word
[50:38] above thy name you see it's the word
[50:41] being revealed that reveals his name
[50:46] amen the word is his nature his
[50:48] characteristics his
[50:49] essence it's who he is it reveals him to
[50:52] be the same
[50:53] yesterday today and forever if there's
[50:55] something
[50:56] that is proclaimed as the name of the
[51:00] lord
[51:00] and it does not line with the rest of
[51:03] the scripture
[51:04] that is not the name of the lord the
[51:07] name of the lord is a
[51:08] strong and mighty tower it's a place of
[51:11] safety
[51:12] it's a reality it's him it is the word
[51:15] so if the name is proclaimed and it's
[51:18] not in line with the word
[51:19] it's not the name being proclaimed so
[51:21] the name is not just me and you
[51:23] saying the lord jesus christ but the
[51:26] word
[51:27] being ministered declares the lord
[51:30] jesus christ that he's the same
[51:32] yesterday
[51:33] today and forever that's why creeds will
[51:36] never
[51:37] ever bring the reality of jesus christ
[51:40] on the scene
[51:42] that's why dogmas can't do it it takes
[51:45] the very
[51:45] person of christ himself who is the word
[51:49] to come
[51:50] into the word and declare his name
[51:53] and when he declares his name that's a
[51:56] fulfillment
[51:57] of him walking in the midst of the seven
[51:59] golden candlesticks
[52:01] and declaring victory
[52:05] the name preached never declares defeat
[52:09] it declares victory it declares there's
[52:13] nothing can stand before him because he
[52:17] is the mighty conqueror
[52:20] and this is the inheritance that we're
[52:22] called to because we are called by that
[52:25] same name
[52:26] we're called by a name that is a name of
[52:29] victory
[52:30] the name of a mighty conqueror this is
[52:33] our family name when that name is
[52:37] preached
[52:37] we turn as in the beginning before eve
[52:41] ever had her own name the bible says he
[52:43] called their
[52:44] name adam we turn to that word
[52:48] we heed to that name this is we walk in
[52:51] that name this is why
[52:53] the scripture said in everything you do
[52:55] let it all be done
[52:57] in the name of jesus christ
[53:00] this name means something to you and i
[53:02] it's this
[53:03] name that calls devils to tremble
[53:06] hallelujah it's not just to have have a
[53:09] name
[53:10] but to have the life of that name he who
[53:13] makes that
[53:14] name and declares it that he's not just
[53:16] a god
[53:17] of 2000 years ago it's not a jesus of
[53:20] 2000 years ago
[53:22] it's the same jesus right here
[53:25] this morning he's the same yesterday
[53:28] today and forever
[53:30] hallelujah and we're called by that name
[53:33] inheritance as a son and daughter of god
[53:35] that we can use
[53:37] that name hallelujah
[53:40] as we approach we approach in the name
[53:43] of the lord jesus christ
[53:46] my goodness
[53:49] verse 13 that was free
[53:54] in whom notice how paul goes on
[53:57] in whom ye also trusted you see this is
[54:01] very very simple and i want to just just
[54:04] see how the lord will just take it but
[54:06] be very diligent with it
[54:08] in whom you also trusted after that you
[54:11] heard the word of truth
[54:13] you can't trust until you first hear the
[54:16] word of truth
[54:19] notice it's not the word of a man this
[54:22] is the word of truth
[54:25] the gospel of your salvation
[54:29] in whom also after that you believed
[54:33] you were sealed with that holy spirit
[54:36] of promise which is the earnest
[54:39] of our inheritance so we're talking
[54:41] about that inheritance the earnest of it
[54:44] is we come back to being sons and
[54:46] daughters of god
[54:47] the holy spirit by the new birth is the
[54:50] down payment
[54:52] it's that change that happens inwardly
[54:55] in our life that changes us and that
[54:58] change leads us to the change of the
[55:01] body
[55:03] which is the full redemption which is to
[55:06] receive
[55:06] the full inheritance
[55:10] until the redemption of the purchased
[55:12] possession
[55:13] unto the praise of his glory so it's the
[55:15] spirit of truth
[55:17] in second thessalonians 2 13 the spirit
[55:20] of truth
[55:21] reveals the path to glory
[55:24] and i'll say it very clearly this
[55:27] message
[55:28] is the revelation of the path to glory
[55:33] i was challenged and challenged by that
[55:35] and a and a minister has wanted
[55:37] a pastor to challenge me upon the things
[55:40] of the message and i just
[55:42] just waited and i said brother i said
[55:44] let me just say this to you
[55:45] this is where i stand this message is
[55:49] the pathway
[55:50] to sonship you forsake it
[55:54] you forsake sonship
[55:55] [Applause]
[55:59] hallelujah it's a pathway home this is
[56:02] the promise of the word
[56:03] it's scripture speaks in isaiah chapter
[56:06] 12
[56:08] in in that particular chapter here a
[56:10] verse of scripture
[56:11] that we it's very dear to our hearts it
[56:14] lays right in the middle of judgment
[56:16] and that scripture said it shall be a
[56:18] day
[56:19] that is not known whether the light nor
[56:22] dark and it won't be clear at all a day
[56:25] where there's no clarity
[56:27] but it said in the evening time there
[56:30] shall
[56:31] be light
[56:34] and the inspiration would strike the
[56:36] black brother who wrote the song
[56:38] the pathway to glory you shall surely
[56:41] find
[56:43] this is the evening time
[56:45] [Music]
[56:47] this is god keeping his promise there is
[56:50] clarity needed
[56:51] we're not leaving out of here fuzzy and
[56:54] and wondering
[56:54] it's a time of clarity it's a time where
[56:58] god in fulfillment of his word
[57:00] is to remove all ignorance or blur
[57:03] all obscurity to remove the grayness and
[57:06] the grizzledness
[57:07] of the hour and to bring such clarity to
[57:10] sons and daughters of god
[57:12] we're living in the time where sons and
[57:15] daughters of god
[57:16] are to be made manifest
[57:19] this is the hour of our jubilee
[57:24] you want to know why these earthquakes
[57:26] and things are going just as they had
[57:28] them in
[57:28] oklahoma here the other day it's the
[57:31] earth crying out
[57:32] bring forth sons and daughters of god
[57:36] it's crying out
[57:41] hallelujah we see the debauchery and
[57:43] everything
[57:44] of man when man forsakes the word of god
[57:47] and they turn to their own reasonings
[57:49] and to their own intellects
[57:51] god is coming to bring a change upon
[57:55] this earth
[57:56] there'll be a change of administration
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] hallelujah there's coming a millennium
[58:03] where there will be a peace for a
[58:06] thousand years
[58:09] and it'll lead us then into that future
[58:11] home
[58:12] [Applause]
[58:14] we are delegates of that reality right
[58:16] now
[58:19] we were once living in the turmoil and
[58:22] the wages of sin
[58:23] we were once bound up we were once under
[58:26] a different
[58:27] administration walking according to the
[58:29] prince of power of the air
[58:30] but then he came what brought the change
[58:34] in your life
[58:35] a change of administration
[58:38] hallelujah a change of one in your life
[58:42] you surrendered to him
[58:48] it's a spirit of truth that reveals the
[58:52] path to glory hallelujah
[58:56] the spirit it seeks our hearts out in
[58:59] perfect
[58:59] obedient obedience to the word
[59:02] it's god dealing you see when god's
[59:04] dealing with the heart
[59:06] as god speaks to your heart he's dealing
[59:08] with your heart he's
[59:09] that is the spirit of god drawing us
[59:11] into
[59:12] obedience
[59:15] oh my that's the grace of god
[59:19] as he deals with our heart and he comes
[59:21] and he speaks to our life
[59:22] oh sure there's things that could sting
[59:25] but the grace of god is there
[59:27] to draw us into obedience and in
[59:30] obedience to the voice
[59:32] of god there is victory
[59:39] paul said but we are bound to give
[59:40] thanks always to god for you
[59:42] brethren beloved of the lord because god
[59:45] hath
[59:46] from the beginning chosen you to
[59:49] salvation
[59:50] through sanctification of the spirit
[59:53] and belief of the truth notice through
[59:56] you have to come
[59:57] through the divine approach whereunto he
[1:00:00] called you
[1:00:01] by our gospel to the obtaining of the
[1:00:04] glory
[1:00:06] of our lord jesus christ
[1:00:09] now you know brother brown will pick
[1:00:11] this up
[1:00:13] when he's preaching in the adoption
[1:00:16] series and
[1:00:16] there's a few other messages where
[1:00:18] brother brown deals with the believer's
[1:00:20] position in christ
[1:00:22] and though and and as it keeps working
[1:00:25] as we read here
[1:00:26] in ephesians 1 paul is making known to
[1:00:29] the ephesian church
[1:00:31] this is what your calling and what god's
[1:00:35] purpose is
[1:00:36] for you to be see somebody's got to come
[1:00:39] and let you know
[1:00:40] who you are
[1:00:43] that's that right there starts breaking
[1:00:46] seals right there
[1:00:47] when somebody starts letting you know
[1:00:49] who you really are
[1:00:55] see you can even be down in a low time
[1:00:58] but when he comes
[1:01:02] the enemy the enemy if you let him he'll
[1:01:05] take the word and run you down
[1:01:08] but you let the holy spirit get a hold
[1:01:10] of that word through a gift of god
[1:01:12] it will take the same word it don't run
[1:01:15] you down
[1:01:16] it lifts you up and it exposes the enemy
[1:01:19] it matters who handles the word
[1:01:22] one can handle it and it brings bondage
[1:01:24] but another can handle it
[1:01:26] and it brings liberty
[1:01:28] [Music]
[1:01:30] hallelujah it's not an imagination it's
[1:01:33] a reality
[1:01:34] [Applause]
[1:01:37] this is why brother and when he would
[1:01:39] take this and
[1:01:40] the laboring within this hour is
[1:01:43] for the for the people of god that we
[1:01:46] would be brought into
[1:01:47] position as sons and daughters of god
[1:01:52] it's to know brother brown would say it
[1:01:53] like this what they are
[1:01:56] how to enter and what to do after they
[1:01:59] enter
[1:02:00] you see in joshua let's look at this
[1:02:02] approach here
[1:02:03] this morning in the book of joshua and i
[1:02:06] can't read all these places but i'm just
[1:02:08] going to refer
[1:02:09] to some in joshua chapter 1 and verse 6
[1:02:13] now remember here the ministry of moses
[1:02:16] and joshua
[1:02:17] it's typed right there in that of the
[1:02:19] lord jesus it's typed
[1:02:21] also in the time that we are living in
[1:02:25] wherein the church ages themselves would
[1:02:28] speak
[1:02:28] of a time of moses but then we find
[1:02:32] joshua who's been present all along that
[1:02:35] joshua would come
[1:02:36] in this in the fullness to be able to
[1:02:39] divide
[1:02:40] to the children of god their inheritance
[1:02:42] this is where
[1:02:43] we are living in this hour where
[1:02:46] where the same grain that went in the
[1:02:48] ground god's not coming after a church
[1:02:51] that somewhat looks like him
[1:02:54] a little bit no no he's coming back for
[1:02:57] a bride
[1:02:59] that would be in his image in his
[1:03:03] likeness to where the word identifies
[1:03:07] the working she's born on my bone flesh
[1:03:10] in my flesh
[1:03:11] she's me
[1:03:16] and here joshua the spirit of god speaks
[1:03:19] here
[1:03:20] and says be strong and of a good courage
[1:03:23] for unto this people shalt thou divide
[1:03:27] for
[1:03:27] inheritance the land which i swear unto
[1:03:31] their fathers to give them
[1:03:33] so this inheritance joshua is going to
[1:03:36] divide that
[1:03:37] only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:03:41] god speaks these words three different
[1:03:43] times
[1:03:45] it speaks of the opposition that thou
[1:03:48] mayest observe to do according
[1:03:50] to all the law which moses my servant
[1:03:54] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[1:03:57] right
[1:03:58] hand or to the left that thou mayest
[1:04:00] prosper
[1:04:01] whithersoever thou goest
[1:04:05] in other words if i can bring it down is
[1:04:08] keep your focus on him who has called
[1:04:11] you
[1:04:15] don't start looking to the left or to
[1:04:17] the right and let me just say
[1:04:19] you can come right here to church and
[1:04:21] you're still not focused
[1:04:23] if you walk out those doors and you
[1:04:24] don't continue on in this word
[1:04:26] and continue to pray and seek after god
[1:04:29] of the things that he's done in your
[1:04:30] life
[1:04:31] you're not doing what the word said do
[1:04:34] you can't expect
[1:04:35] results this is where the word comes
[1:04:39] to direct you and i be strong and very
[1:04:43] courageous
[1:04:45] where you stand in the promises that god
[1:04:49] is making known to you and there's no
[1:04:51] excuse
[1:04:52] well i don't know if this or i don't
[1:04:54] know that we're without excuse
[1:04:56] the word has come to speak to our hearts
[1:04:58] what should i do
[1:04:59] go forward in the word
[1:05:04] hallelujah let your life be wrapped in
[1:05:06] that word
[1:05:08] let it become part of your prayer part
[1:05:10] of your confession
[1:05:12] and everything let it be they come to
[1:05:14] this moment this is what the whole
[1:05:16] whole purpose of coming out of egypt was
[1:05:18] all about was not to come out in the
[1:05:20] wilderness
[1:05:21] it was not just to pass through the red
[1:05:23] sea
[1:05:25] those were only symbols pointing to a
[1:05:26] reality
[1:05:29] hallelujah it was god calling them into
[1:05:32] a place
[1:05:32] of their inheritance where what was
[1:05:35] inside
[1:05:36] of them who they were to be could really
[1:05:38] come out in expression
[1:05:44] hallelujah this book of the law
[1:05:47] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[1:05:49] thou shalt meditate therein
[1:05:51] day and night that thou mayest observe
[1:05:56] to do according
[1:05:57] to all that is written therein for then
[1:06:00] thou shalt make
[1:06:01] thy way prospers and then thou shalt
[1:06:05] have good success
[1:06:07] so the word as the word itself and this
[1:06:11] it pertains to all of us here and as we
[1:06:14] look at this
[1:06:15] this word is to be what
[1:06:19] we are are given to there's a lot of
[1:06:22] things brothers and sisters
[1:06:23] a lot of a lot of things and traps of
[1:06:27] the enemy
[1:06:28] that would like to your meditation
[1:06:35] just the cares of life alone
[1:06:38] if you don't manage the cares of life
[1:06:42] uh correctly it'll manage you
[1:06:47] i told sons we were talking with them
[1:06:50] just having some
[1:06:51] certain lessons or whatever and as
[1:06:52] things come about i said
[1:06:54] always remember don't let money manage
[1:06:57] you
[1:06:59] you manage it and they said you won't
[1:07:00] even have to dwell on it
[1:07:02] you may not have the things that there
[1:07:04] might be things that you want that's
[1:07:05] fine you
[1:07:06] you put that up you save for it and if
[1:07:08] you can have it you have it i said but
[1:07:09] don't ever let
[1:07:10] money manage you
[1:07:14] we have to have it to live but it don't
[1:07:17] let it manage you because when you let
[1:07:18] it manage you it takes you
[1:07:20] it starts to drive you it starts to
[1:07:22] motivate you
[1:07:25] that's why the bible says the the money
[1:07:28] is the root of all evil
[1:07:33] god keep that covetous spirit away
[1:07:37] this is what we're to be occupied with
[1:07:40] is that our our hearts is to be occupied
[1:07:43] with that word
[1:07:45] you see this is where that meditation
[1:07:49] you as soon as you come out of church
[1:07:51] then the enemy wants to start
[1:07:54] or on the job something comes out listen
[1:07:56] we're not ignorant of satan's devices
[1:07:59] brother brown stands and tells us in
[1:08:01] christ the mystery he says it's god
[1:08:03] that's desiring to get this
[1:08:05] revelation to your heart but you let
[1:08:08] your husband take it out of you you let
[1:08:10] he said your job taken out of you
[1:08:12] you let others let me just tell you when
[1:08:15] it speaks in that manner it lets you and
[1:08:17] i know
[1:08:18] you don't have to let it happen
[1:08:24] you've got an authority when that word
[1:08:27] comes
[1:08:28] joshua he moves forward here with the
[1:08:31] with the people
[1:08:32] and he and it's a ministry of
[1:08:35] preparation god has let him know
[1:08:38] that this is this land is to be divided
[1:08:40] now it's a time
[1:08:42] of preparation he has the people further
[1:08:44] on down in the scripture
[1:08:46] to prepare because in three days we're
[1:08:48] going to cross this jordan
[1:08:51] and brother brown would make this
[1:08:52] statement and i i'm just going to read
[1:08:55] it
[1:08:56] he says it's a process
[1:08:59] of getting ready to inherit
[1:09:02] the promise it's a very key statement
[1:09:06] it's it's a process of getting ready to
[1:09:09] inherit the promise
[1:09:12] remember as i've said here over and over
[1:09:14] is that you can't
[1:09:15] put timelines or time frames upon god
[1:09:20] there's things that even as we would
[1:09:22] speak about and have been speaking about
[1:09:25] it can happen in a moment
[1:09:29] i'm talking about everything brother
[1:09:32] bram says right there setting at your
[1:09:34] seat now he's not saying that's where
[1:09:36] you have to receive it
[1:09:37] he's always admonishing us you be
[1:09:40] obedient to the lord but he's letting us
[1:09:42] know
[1:09:43] the simplicity of god he said it can
[1:09:45] come right there
[1:09:46] and burn everything up and god bring the
[1:09:49] change that you need
[1:09:51] he's letting us know this is god's
[1:09:53] desire
[1:09:54] it's you and me it's not getting god in
[1:09:56] condition it's you and me coming into
[1:10:00] condition
[1:10:02] i mean we can come into this service and
[1:10:04] be all out of sorts
[1:10:05] and god wants to work to get us in
[1:10:07] condition
[1:10:08] to speak to us you see the scripture
[1:10:12] paul would write about how that even
[1:10:14] when a man is striving for masteries
[1:10:18] that of a race he's got to run it
[1:10:21] according to the rules that govern it
[1:10:23] the scripture said except he strive
[1:10:25] lawfully
[1:10:27] he's disqualified so there's an
[1:10:31] approach that i want to race you you
[1:10:34] can't when you're running a race and
[1:10:35] you know as kids and things like that
[1:10:37] sometimes we always look for
[1:10:39] certain things i'm going to do and i'll
[1:10:41] be the one to say go
[1:10:43] or i'm going to cut here or cut there
[1:10:45] cut through this
[1:10:47] to win but winning doesn't come by
[1:10:51] shortcuts
[1:10:53] the path to glory can't be altered
[1:10:58] amen so you see there's always been
[1:11:01] a path a path an approach to god
[1:11:05] and brother brown would say like this a
[1:11:07] very taking a very
[1:11:09] a very uh simple example he says in the
[1:11:11] message approach to god
[1:11:13] if i started to go home this afternoon
[1:11:15] and cut across
[1:11:17] the fields i'd find myself
[1:11:20] sunk down in a mud puddle somewhere
[1:11:25] the highway has an approach to
[1:11:27] jeffersonville
[1:11:28] and i must go the way of the highway
[1:11:31] it's easy running if you'll just
[1:11:34] get in the road
[1:11:38] there's no you can't cut across fields
[1:11:40] you have to come
[1:11:41] according to the approach into the city
[1:11:45] or in to the economy of god into the
[1:11:48] inheritance that god has for you
[1:11:50] notice what he says die out to self
[1:11:54] come through the blood of christ then
[1:11:57] you can approach the father
[1:11:59] and he will give you the holy spirit
[1:12:01] that'll make you a believer
[1:12:03] because it's not you that's believing
[1:12:05] anymore
[1:12:06] it's the holy spirit in you your
[1:12:09] nature's been changed
[1:12:13] when joshua this when joshua stands
[1:12:16] there
[1:12:16] and here are the people in that moment
[1:12:19] when he lets them know
[1:12:20] this is where we're standing we're
[1:12:22] standing
[1:12:24] right here before the jordan
[1:12:27] and preparing to come into our
[1:12:28] inheritance this is what
[1:12:30] the call has been about
[1:12:33] within within the word the message that
[1:12:36] was sent
[1:12:37] when god sent moses down to egypt
[1:12:40] remember i've come to bring you out and
[1:12:42] into
[1:12:43] a good land because redemption it has
[1:12:46] two parts to it
[1:12:48] it's not just to come out is to go in
[1:12:51] this is what we've been dealing with you
[1:12:53] must it must be an
[1:12:54] entering in into the promises of god
[1:12:57] that is the same way
[1:12:59] when the lord jesus himself noticed as
[1:13:01] he went away
[1:13:02] he sent back the holy ghost and noticed
[1:13:05] the whole
[1:13:06] the whole church of the living god has
[1:13:08] looked to the second
[1:13:10] coming of the lord it's been looking
[1:13:13] for this moment for this season that you
[1:13:16] and i
[1:13:17] are living in let me just tell you the
[1:13:20] rapture itself
[1:13:21] it has rested as a promise to the
[1:13:24] believer
[1:13:25] and it's in this generation that god
[1:13:28] said
[1:13:29] this generation shall not pass
[1:13:33] it's the unfolding of that promise
[1:13:36] in this hour it hadn't really rested
[1:13:40] as a promise but then god in fulfillment
[1:13:43] of his word
[1:13:44] he took that word of a promise and he
[1:13:47] unfolded
[1:13:48] that path to bring you and i into that
[1:13:52] place
[1:13:52] of rapturing faith into a rapturing
[1:13:55] condition
[1:13:56] into a place where the devil has no
[1:14:00] claim on the church of the living god
[1:14:03] where you can say there's
[1:14:04] nothing that'll stop this bride from
[1:14:07] going in a rapture
[1:14:09] that's the certainty of the word that
[1:14:12] god has delivered to you and i
[1:14:14] in this hour
[1:14:18] and their response to joshua is very
[1:14:21] very important
[1:14:22] they speak to joshua and he says in
[1:14:25] joshua 1 16
[1:14:26] all that thou commandest us we will do
[1:14:30] this is an approach you see the word
[1:14:34] the word delivered by the spirit of
[1:14:35] truth going forth this
[1:14:37] is their this is their response all that
[1:14:39] you've commanded us to do
[1:14:40] we will do whether so ever thou send us
[1:14:44] us
[1:14:44] we will go according as we hearkened
[1:14:47] unto moses and all things
[1:14:49] so will we hearken unto thee only
[1:14:52] only the lord that god be with thee as
[1:14:55] he was with moses
[1:14:57] so who would they be hearkening to the
[1:14:59] same one
[1:15:00] who sent moses spoke through moses was
[1:15:03] the same one
[1:15:04] who would speak through joshua and they
[1:15:06] are saying we are here to recognize
[1:15:09] that he's still the same god he might
[1:15:12] have taken moses off the scene
[1:15:14] but joshua's still on the scene joshua's
[1:15:18] been here all along
[1:15:19] it's the same god among us and here
[1:15:22] this is a key point all that thou
[1:15:24] commandeth us to do
[1:15:26] we will do
[1:15:30] this deals with a submissive heart
[1:15:35] this is a working of the holy spirit to
[1:15:37] bring
[1:15:38] a heart into submission to bring it into
[1:15:42] obedience you can't bypass this
[1:15:46] it's going to be the same that's the
[1:15:47] work that's what the holy ghost does
[1:15:49] comes here it's what he does after he
[1:15:50] comes in
[1:15:51] no this is done before this makes ready
[1:15:53] for him to come
[1:15:56] because if he comes in ahead of time
[1:15:58] he's stepping in
[1:15:59] and he marries one that's disagreeable
[1:16:01] with him and he's an adulterer
[1:16:03] because you still got a living husband
[1:16:06] are you going to preach with me now
[1:16:08] this is why in romans 7 paul said that
[1:16:11] we were married to the law
[1:16:15] that old man but now through the body of
[1:16:19] jesus christ
[1:16:20] we have become dead to the law
[1:16:23] that we might be married
[1:16:26] to jesus christ
[1:16:31] see the marriage of the new man raising
[1:16:33] up that seed he can't do it if the old
[1:16:35] man's still alive
[1:16:36] he can't do it but the old man's got to
[1:16:40] be dead
[1:16:42] buried then he comes and raises up that
[1:16:46] new man
[1:16:47] but even in the death of the old man
[1:16:50] it's his work
[1:16:53] it's his work
[1:16:57] i don't know about you but that's a
[1:16:58] paradox
[1:17:01] to get the old man to to to agree with
[1:17:03] the word
[1:17:04] yes ram said he must do that and then he
[1:17:07] kills it
[1:17:12] it comes to a place of sacrifice isn't
[1:17:14] that wonderful
[1:17:16] you know that's just wonderful how god
[1:17:18] just brings that it's all his work
[1:17:20] it's not we're we're not here under a
[1:17:22] fear
[1:17:24] we're not here under a threat this is
[1:17:26] love divine
[1:17:28] the scriptures declare in the song of
[1:17:30] solomon he
[1:17:32] he hath brought me to his banqueting
[1:17:34] table and his banner
[1:17:36] over me is love
[1:17:41] now joshua he goes on and he speaks to
[1:17:44] the people as they come to a place
[1:17:47] there uh and him very close right
[1:17:50] next to the jordan
[1:17:51] and he puts this declaration so here the
[1:17:54] people have said
[1:17:55] all that you say we will do and now
[1:17:58] he lets it be known in this time of
[1:18:00] preparation
[1:18:02] and he speaks to them sanctify
[1:18:04] yourselves
[1:18:06] in verse 5 of joshua 3 sanctify
[1:18:09] yourselves
[1:18:10] for tomorrow the lord will do wonders
[1:18:13] among you
[1:18:14] and so joshua's let him know
[1:18:18] let the word itself the priest
[1:18:21] are going to take the ark of the
[1:18:22] covenant which is the word of god
[1:18:26] and they're going to come to the jordan
[1:18:28] and when they their
[1:18:29] feet touch stand right there at the brim
[1:18:32] the way
[1:18:33] is going to be opened up and they will
[1:18:35] go and stand in the midst of the jordan
[1:18:37] you see
[1:18:38] the priest did not walk through it and
[1:18:40] then come out on the other side
[1:18:42] but the priests were standing right in
[1:18:45] the provided way
[1:18:48] they weren't in the way of the people
[1:18:50] but they were in god's provided way
[1:18:52] proclaiming that this is the provided
[1:18:55] way
[1:18:56] they were carrying the ark where it was
[1:18:58] meant to be carried
[1:19:00] above the heart
[1:19:03] not your heart above the word but the
[1:19:05] word above your heart
[1:19:08] and they were standing in that way and
[1:19:10] the jordan
[1:19:11] opened and it parted now was the time
[1:19:14] that they were to come into their
[1:19:16] inheritance and
[1:19:17] notice the request sanctify yourselves
[1:19:22] for what god is going to do tomorrow
[1:19:25] now it shows if god would speak to
[1:19:28] joshua in that way
[1:19:29] even into that place the people are
[1:19:31] aware of what this means to sanctify
[1:19:33] themselves
[1:19:34] they knew what that meant that meant to
[1:19:37] to separate from any uncleanliness to to
[1:19:40] really consecrate yourself
[1:19:42] to the work of god that's at hand
[1:19:47] this is where god calls this is why when
[1:19:50] the holy spirit's dealing with the life
[1:19:53] god's calling us into consecration
[1:19:56] this is when the holy spirit he's
[1:19:57] dealing with the soul he's calling that
[1:19:59] soul
[1:20:00] into a real consecration to where
[1:20:03] that's the focus that's this is what
[1:20:06] they're locked in on this is
[1:20:08] this is my promise and it's all a work
[1:20:11] of god
[1:20:11] as he's moving and bringing that all
[1:20:13] about within that heart
[1:20:15] this is why when brother branham would
[1:20:17] say it like this and i'm i'm reading
[1:20:19] these very intentional
[1:20:20] he says notice what did joshua do
[1:20:24] he put the word he what did he put first
[1:20:26] the clergy
[1:20:27] no sir he put the word first
[1:20:31] see he didn't put well what does my what
[1:20:33] does my church say or what does my
[1:20:35] denomination say
[1:20:36] that won't open it up you've got to put
[1:20:40] the word first
[1:20:42] this is what god come to do you see
[1:20:45] church has been exalted
[1:20:46] man's teachings has had preeminence all
[1:20:48] those things have had
[1:20:50] preeminence here but god in this hour
[1:20:52] has come
[1:20:53] to declare that he is the one alone to
[1:20:57] have
[1:20:58] preeminence he's the one to have
[1:21:01] preeminence in our thoughts
[1:21:02] in our lives the word himself is the
[1:21:05] oneness to have preeminence
[1:21:07] oh what a great precious reality
[1:21:10] for the word to have the preeminence in
[1:21:13] our lives
[1:21:16] notice he said put the word first take
[1:21:19] that ark
[1:21:21] and all you preach stay away from it
[1:21:24] get behind it don't try to lead it
[1:21:27] let it lead you
[1:21:30] he said that's the trouble today we try
[1:21:32] to get ahead of the word
[1:21:34] now watch how he says this and bypass
[1:21:37] and make the word fit this and the word
[1:21:40] fit
[1:21:41] back but what we need today
[1:21:44] is follow the word
[1:21:47] and my sheep they know my voice
[1:21:52] and a stranger they will not follow
[1:21:54] what's he calling
[1:21:56] lambs he's calling

[1:22:40] the message
[1:22:43] brother sister this is the theme of the
[1:22:46] word in this
[1:22:46] hour is that we come back to being sons
[1:22:49] and daughters of god

[1:25:31] cannot come
[1:25:32] until there's a death first
[1:25:36] this is a simple statement but it's true
[1:25:39] people don't want to die
[1:25:43] listen i can't figure out it's very
[1:25:46] simple
[1:25:47] you don't want to die but when you get
[1:25:50] ready to die
[1:25:52] that's when he'll come
[1:25:57] they don't want look at this the simple
[1:26:01] leadings of the holy spirit the simple
[1:26:05] the simple leadings of the holy spirit
[1:26:08] they want to take their own thinking of
[1:26:11] it
[1:26:11] you can't thank your own thoughts you
[1:26:14] got to think
[1:26:15] his thoughts his thoughts are higher
[1:26:17] than our thoughts
[1:26:19] is that right his thoughts are his word
[1:26:22] and that word coming in it calls us to
[1:26:25] prosper
[1:26:26] in the thing that he sent it in you
[1:26:28] can't take the word
[1:26:30] into your life and not experience change
[1:26:32] taking place
[1:26:35] when you take the word in i'm talking
[1:26:36] about really hearing that word
[1:26:38] you'll find that the holes and things in
[1:26:41] your life
[1:26:42] hit you the things that you struggle
[1:26:44] with it begins to lose
[1:26:46] power and authority because this is not
[1:26:48] the word of a man
[1:26:50] this is god's word and this word has
[1:26:53] power and authority in it
[1:26:57] hallelujah it's the same word where
[1:27:00] jesus could speak
[1:27:01] to that cult that was needed in order
[1:27:04] glory
[1:27:04] in order to bring him and that he went
[1:27:06] right in
[1:27:07] into jerusalem there headed to the
[1:27:10] crucifixion
[1:27:11] he said grow and lose that coat
[1:27:15] that coat was where he saw it in the
[1:27:18] vision
[1:27:19] and he told them you go get that coat
[1:27:21] and loose it
[1:27:22] they had authority by the word to find
[1:27:25] where that coat was at
[1:27:27] and to loose it because it was needed
[1:27:29] for the master
[1:27:31] let me just say it i've come with the
[1:27:33] word this morning
[1:27:34] god has sent a message god knows just
[1:27:37] exactly
[1:27:38] where every life is at and the word
[1:27:40] comes forth to say
[1:27:41] loose it the master has
[1:27:44] need of this hallelujah
[1:27:49] loose it from doubt loose it from
[1:27:51] unbelief
[1:27:52] loose it from oppression loose it from
[1:27:55] depression
[1:27:56] loose it from discouragement the master
[1:27:59] has need
[1:28:00] of thee
[1:28:05] you can't think your own thoughts you
[1:28:07] got to think his thoughts
[1:28:10] let the mind that was in christ be in
[1:28:13] you
[1:28:14] he says he thinks god's thoughts brings
[1:28:16] god's blessings
[1:28:17] god's power to you oh as you see he said
[1:28:20] he'll make a mess out of you
[1:28:22] as far as the world is concerned but
[1:28:24] it'll bring new life
[1:28:26] it'll bring resurrecting life it'll
[1:28:28] bring new thoughts
[1:28:30] it'll bring a new person it'll bring a
[1:28:32] new faith
[1:28:33] it'll bring you from death unto life
[1:28:35] what does that
[1:28:36] the word
[1:28:40] receiving that word
[1:28:44] let me say this god comes to bring
[1:28:47] transformation
[1:28:50] it doesn't come to leave us in the
[1:28:52] wilderness
[1:28:53] he comes his calling is to bring us all
[1:28:55] the way
[1:28:56] across jordan see you see this is where
[1:29:01] the word
[1:29:02] it enters as brother brown would tell us
[1:29:05] it enters the mind
[1:29:06] first that's that that there's a womb in
[1:29:09] our mind
[1:29:10] it enters the mind first your mind has
[1:29:13] to agree with it
[1:29:14] you've got to bypass your mind like i
[1:29:16] don't even know what happened no no
[1:29:18] no in whom you first trusted
[1:29:21] then it goes to say and believed
[1:29:24] see you see it enters the mind
[1:29:28] enters into the womb of the mind then
[1:29:30] it's believed with the heart
[1:29:33] then god brings the seal it's all him
[1:29:35] working
[1:29:36] to get you and i to stand still
[1:29:42] oh my just some testimonies i'd love to
[1:29:45] share here but i need to keep moving
[1:29:46] with this here
[1:29:48] first corinthians 6 9 notice how paul is
[1:29:51] speaking to
[1:29:52] the corinthian church here he said know
[1:29:56] you not
[1:29:56] that the unrighteous shall not inherit
[1:30:00] the kingdom of god be not deceived
[1:30:04] see here's the spirit of truth it's to
[1:30:07] break deception
[1:30:09] because satan realizes
[1:30:12] this is just what this is exactly what
[1:30:15] happened
[1:30:16] where after the outpouring of the holy
[1:30:19] spirit remember while jesus jesus was
[1:30:21] here
[1:30:22] there was judas right after the
[1:30:24] outpouring of the holy spirit
[1:30:26] here the antichrist spirit came in among
[1:30:28] them
[1:30:29] and satan knows if he can just alter
[1:30:33] the word in one place one place
[1:30:37] then he has altered the path to glory
[1:30:41] and it no longer becomes the path to
[1:30:43] glory
[1:30:45] now as a bible reader you realize in the
[1:30:47] book of proverbs
[1:30:48] it speaks of a woman who goes out in the
[1:30:52] street
[1:30:52] to beguile the simple
[1:30:56] and it says they that enter into her
[1:30:58] house
[1:31:00] they don't come out right
[1:31:04] her stairs are the way to hell
[1:31:08] that's a scripture you see
[1:31:11] she beguiles it's a deception
[1:31:15] see this is why the gospel itself
[1:31:18] remember
[1:31:19] paul warned the people he speaks in
[1:31:21] corinthians
[1:31:22] how there were those who were coming
[1:31:24] among them and paul called him in
[1:31:26] philippians
[1:31:27] dogs he called him in corinthians there
[1:31:30] false workers false apostles they were
[1:31:33] claiming they were sent
[1:31:35] they weren't sent by god because when
[1:31:37] they're sent by god
[1:31:39] the god that sends you goes in you it's
[1:31:42] not your message
[1:31:43] you're now running with the message of a
[1:31:45] living god
[1:31:47] and it's god is going to work and
[1:31:49] puzzling and no
[1:31:50] there's false workers that's come in why
[1:31:54] satan's trying to alter it it doesn't
[1:31:56] matter
[1:31:57] how religious people can be but if
[1:31:59] they're altered from that path of glory
[1:32:02] to where they come back to being a real
[1:32:04] son and daughter of gift
[1:32:05] he doesn't care how emotional they get
[1:32:07] he doesn't care how many gifts
[1:32:09] that they have come on now first
[1:32:11] corinthians 13.
[1:32:12] it doesn't matter how they can speak
[1:32:14] with tongues of men and angel
[1:32:16] it doesn't matter they can explain all
[1:32:17] the mysteries it doesn't matter if they
[1:32:19] have faith to move mountain
[1:32:21] if they miss the holy ghost they miss
[1:32:24] everything
[1:32:27] let me just tell you something the devil
[1:32:30] has been at work
[1:32:31] to try to alter that course
[1:32:35] but he can't out through the holy ghost
[1:32:41] hallelujah he might have rode in on a
[1:32:44] white horse rider
[1:32:46] he can outdo man's might but he can't
[1:32:48] out do the holy ghost
[1:32:52] the holy ghost uncovers his kingdom
[1:32:58] hallelujah amen notice
[1:33:01] paul said be not deceived neither
[1:33:04] fornicators
[1:33:06] nor idolaters nor nor nor adulterers
[1:33:09] nor effeminate that's that's
[1:33:11] homosexual
[1:33:12] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[1:33:15] nor
[1:33:16] thieves nor covenants nor drunkards nor
[1:33:19] revilers
[1:33:19] nor extortioners shall inherit
[1:33:22] the kingdom of god to inherit means to
[1:33:25] receive
[1:33:27] one's portion
[1:33:31] now let me just say this to you you
[1:33:33] might have had
[1:33:35] at your wedding you might have had empty
[1:33:37] seats your wedding reception
[1:33:38] you invited certain people they didn't
[1:33:40] come
[1:33:43] more food for you to take home
[1:33:49] let me just tell you something the
[1:33:52] wedding supper
[1:33:53] don't got one too many chairs
[1:33:57] it ain't no such thing that jesus said i
[1:33:59] didn't know you was going to be an
[1:34:00] overcomer
[1:34:00] hey bring another chair we'll squeeze in
[1:34:02] here somewhere no
[1:34:04] your place has already been set
[1:34:10] the place at that table that's what the
[1:34:12] spirit of god
[1:34:13] calls upon your life it's him drawing
[1:34:16] upon your life
[1:34:17] this is not deception these are the true
[1:34:20] sayings of god it's truth that calls you
[1:34:24] to that place
[1:34:25] of truth there's a place
[1:34:29] prepared for you
[1:34:32] it calls you to that place there's not
[1:34:34] as the scripture would talk about
[1:34:36] the wedding garment those that wouldn't
[1:34:38] enter in
[1:34:39] there's not you know like you go to your
[1:34:41] acapella choir
[1:34:42] and you're waiting to try on garments
[1:34:44] okay you need a bigger one oh you need a
[1:34:45] smaller one oh we're gonna have to hem
[1:34:46] yours and
[1:34:47] all you're gonna oh we got we got five
[1:34:49] extra
[1:34:50] god don't have five extra theophanies
[1:34:54] there's not gonna be five robes where
[1:34:56] god says man i thought they were gonna
[1:34:58] make it
[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:09] hey man he's drawing me there's a place
[1:35:12] prepared for me hallelujah
[1:35:17] i've been connected with that garment
[1:35:18] over there that representation
[1:35:23] hallelujah it's reflected back down here
[1:35:26] in my life though we walk in this earth
[1:35:30] we have an earthly image but there's a
[1:35:32] reflection
[1:35:33] of heaven of that place in our lives
[1:35:37] that declares though my citizenship i
[1:35:41] might be american
[1:35:42] or this or that that's here for this
[1:35:44] body
[1:35:45] but down here in my soul i've received
[1:35:48] a real citizenship i was always a son
[1:35:52] and daughter of god
[1:35:55] but the citizenship was made by the holy
[1:35:58] ghost
[1:35:59] it came and it birthed that reality in
[1:36:02] my life
[1:36:02] and that's why you can say i am a
[1:36:05] pilgrim
[1:36:06] and a stranger in this world
[1:36:09] [Applause]
[1:36:17] you see it calls us into that place this
[1:36:19] is why
[1:36:20] when paul is dealing with this here in
[1:36:22] the scripture
[1:36:24] he's letting it be known here among the
[1:36:27] corinthian church
[1:36:28] they've seen the supernatural remember
[1:36:30] paul ties them back in first corinthians
[1:36:32] 10
[1:36:33] and he takes them of the journey that
[1:36:35] israel was on
[1:36:36] they all ate they ate the meat all late
[1:36:38] to manna all drank from the spiritual
[1:36:40] rock
[1:36:40] all did this all these things
[1:36:47] but then paul says they were overthrown
[1:36:50] in the wilderness see what paul's
[1:36:53] dealing with
[1:36:54] is is that there could be
[1:36:57] in these lives and they experience
[1:37:01] gifts in their life they experience
[1:37:05] the anointing of the holy spirit but
[1:37:07] this is still
[1:37:08] what is in their life you understand
[1:37:12] there's
[1:37:12] there's a difference between mistakes
[1:37:14] and habits
[1:37:16] are you hearing me now you can't call
[1:37:19] something where you're still in bondage
[1:37:21] and say
[1:37:21] that's a mistake you're in bondage
[1:37:24] and you need deliverance i know that
[1:37:27] might be straight but if you take it
[1:37:29] it'll do you a whole lot of good
[1:37:31] this is why paul says be not deceived
[1:37:35] they can set and enjoy the work brother
[1:37:37] brand brings in the corinthians book of
[1:37:38] corrections he said you can enjoy the
[1:37:40] word
[1:37:41] but you see it's not enough just to
[1:37:43] enjoy it
[1:37:44] it's to be one with it
[1:37:48] see this is why there's there must be
[1:37:51] with justification
[1:37:53] a person can they receive a call from
[1:37:55] god god deals with their life and
[1:37:57] they repent and they give their life to
[1:37:59] the lord but yet they still have filthy
[1:38:01] habits in their life
[1:38:02] they can still have smoking and drinking
[1:38:04] and everything else in their life and
[1:38:06] yet they've given their life to the lord
[1:38:10] that's god picking up the glass
[1:38:13] but then there must come a
[1:38:15] sanctification
[1:38:17] you can't bypass from justification
[1:38:20] into the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:38:23] even in the redemption of of this earth
[1:38:27] it went from noah then the blood at
[1:38:29] calvary
[1:38:30] then it comes back in the fire cleansing
[1:38:33] there
[1:38:34] in the millennium and then here comes
[1:38:36] the future home
[1:38:38] you can't bypass stages and as i've said
[1:38:41] i just i'm going to reiterate this
[1:38:43] it does not mean that you have to labor
[1:38:46] in a certain stage
[1:38:47] god can do this work at one moment
[1:38:52] you don't have to labor within it but
[1:38:55] but the reason
[1:38:56] that the holy spirit would bring this
[1:38:58] out and this is laid there
[1:38:59] on my heart is because we are at the
[1:39:02] crossing
[1:39:03] we are getting ready to move
[1:39:06] across that continental divide into that
[1:39:09] other land
[1:39:10] the rapture is upon us
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:15] it's a time not to be playing around
[1:39:17] anymore
[1:39:18] not that playing around was ever
[1:39:20] acceptable
[1:39:22] brother samuel what if i get real
[1:39:24] consecrated
[1:39:25] and there's another 50 years glory to
[1:39:28] god
[1:39:28] you'll have joy for 50 years you'll
[1:39:31] torment hell for 50 years
[1:39:35] you'll be satan's nightmare for 50 years
[1:39:40] he's your life it becomes the
[1:39:44] joy and the pleasure of your life
[1:39:48] and you become a witness of the liberty
[1:39:51] that's in christ jesus
[1:39:55] because to sanctify a very a simple part
[1:39:58] it separates from profane things yes
[1:40:02] and it is a dedication to god notice
[1:40:04] separate from
[1:40:06] and it's dedicating to god
[1:40:09] it's it's all that brother brown would
[1:40:12] say
[1:40:12] like this he says after the person i'm
[1:40:15] just referring to this
[1:40:17] has been sanctified the unclean habits
[1:40:19] has gone from the person
[1:40:21] he is a believer on the lord jesus
[1:40:22] christ and his habits are gone
[1:40:24] we believe he's a candidate for the
[1:40:27] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:40:29] which is the filling of the spirit of
[1:40:32] god
[1:40:34] you see it's cleaned and set aside for
[1:40:36] service i don't have time to labor on
[1:40:38] this
[1:40:39] but god had the altar
[1:40:42] in the old testament in the tabernacle
[1:40:47] the altar itself
[1:40:50] once a year and even in the beginning
[1:40:52] when they would consecrate the
[1:40:54] tabernacle
[1:40:55] that altar had to be sanctified
[1:40:59] dedicated with blood
[1:41:03] then then came the fulfillment of that
[1:41:06] whatever touched the altar was
[1:41:08] sanctified
[1:41:10] this that's the scripture in exodus 29
[1:41:13] 37 whatever touches the altar
[1:41:16] is then sanctified what is the altar
[1:41:19] it's a place of death amen
[1:41:23] it's a place of dying out
[1:41:26] it's a place of sacrifice
[1:41:29] sacrifices are brought in they're still
[1:41:31] they're still alive
[1:41:32] now comes to the place where the
[1:41:34] sacrifice
[1:41:35] is to be offered up right it's a die
[1:41:39] it's dying out
[1:41:40] to sell that's what the holy spirit
[1:41:43] that's what he deals with in a life you
[1:41:44] see
[1:41:46] some some could hear and say
[1:41:49] that's a little bit too i don't think
[1:41:51] you got to go all that way i mean after
[1:41:52] all god looks on the heart
[1:41:54] but whatever's in the heart is gonna
[1:41:57] come out
[1:42:00] but you take a heart and there's things
[1:42:03] that they can know and say you know what
[1:42:05] there's things right now that's in my
[1:42:06] life but the difference is they're not
[1:42:08] content with it they look at it and say
[1:42:12] lord
[1:42:13] i'm believing you for a full
[1:42:15] sanctification
[1:42:16] and for the holy ghost
[1:42:20] they're focused a lot of things can come
[1:42:23] and try to distract them but they got
[1:42:24] one focus
[1:42:26] they're focused on the one who dealt
[1:42:28] with their life
[1:42:29] they're focused on the god who called
[1:42:32] them in the beginning
[1:42:33] they're focused on the one that then
[1:42:34] they begin to look at things in the
[1:42:36] message
[1:42:37] and the reading and the scriptures and
[1:42:38] all of a sudden what was there all along
[1:42:41] and what they thought
[1:42:42] they realized lord it's really that
[1:42:44] simple what i'm dealing with
[1:42:46] it's unbelief but they hear what's
[1:42:48] happening their faith
[1:42:49] is being energized in the one who's
[1:42:51] dealing with them
[1:42:52] who is that that's joshua it's joshua
[1:42:56] that's letting you know get yourself
[1:42:58] prepared get yourself ready
[1:43:00] how do i get myself prepared i've sent a
[1:43:02] word
[1:43:03] that you can prepare yourself yield to
[1:43:05] that word
[1:43:07] and that word continues to wash you that
[1:43:10] word continues to prepare you
[1:43:12] and that same word will please you
[1:43:20] see this is why let me just have just a
[1:43:23] few more moments
[1:43:25] see brother brahma he would take us
[1:43:26] within this i know it's very simple but
[1:43:28] this is it's a theme all the way through
[1:43:29] this is a scripture
[1:43:31] before there can be a resurrection
[1:43:32] there's got to be a death
[1:43:35] before a man can be raised up in the
[1:43:37] resurrection with christ
[1:43:38] he has to die out to himself die out to
[1:43:41] all his worldly associates
[1:43:43] die out to all of his worldly habits die
[1:43:46] out to everything that's ungodly
[1:43:48] and be resurrected anew yeah
[1:43:52] this is why there's just there's just no
[1:43:55] there's no shortcuts at all
[1:43:57] it's walking on with god right
[1:44:01] my i just let me just let me just have
[1:44:04] can i have just a few more moments
[1:44:09] in the message a prisoner
[1:44:12] we could go on in different places in
[1:44:14] the scripture and see this
[1:44:18] it was rebecca it was with esther
[1:44:22] they had to yield they surrendered
[1:44:25] to the call and then
[1:44:28] what the word said do they had a
[1:44:31] willingness in their heart
[1:44:33] to do what the word said do
[1:44:37] it was god calling brother brown makes
[1:44:40] this simple
[1:44:42] in in the message a prisoner he speaks
[1:44:45] of how
[1:44:46] and he takes us in how the priests were
[1:44:48] dressed
[1:44:49] and how that others in order for them to
[1:44:52] be dressed
[1:44:53] aaron and his sons they had to come
[1:44:55] before
[1:44:56] the door and appear before moses moses
[1:45:02] being
[1:45:03] that representative of the word that god
[1:45:06] had given
[1:45:08] god had given the vision what they were
[1:45:09] about ready to walk into
[1:45:11] was from was from the mind of god from
[1:45:14] that of heaven now reflected down
[1:45:16] into earth in a type and hear the word
[1:45:19] here they were to come before that word
[1:45:22] and remember
[1:45:22] they had to be dressed but before they
[1:45:25] could ever be dressed
[1:45:27] they had to be washed
[1:45:30] and moses had to wash them
[1:45:33] what what do we do when we take a bath
[1:45:35] we'll get cleaned up we smell better
[1:45:37] no what's happening is i mean you could
[1:45:41] put
[1:45:41] cologne and perfume on and if you've got
[1:45:44] stench on
[1:45:45] you smell like a clean dirty person
[1:45:50] i'm not saying it to be funny but i'm
[1:45:52] saying you understand what does water do
[1:45:54] what is so supposed to do what does that
[1:45:56] come to do i know it's a very simple
[1:45:58] lesson right here
[1:45:59] maybe the cdc would like to give me a
[1:46:00] little bit of kickback on this
[1:46:02] very very simple it is there to loosen
[1:46:05] the grime and the water is there to wash
[1:46:09] away the dirt
[1:46:12] this is why the spirit of god comes into
[1:46:15] the word
[1:46:16] he's there to loosen the hold
[1:46:19] of dirt and of the grime of the world
[1:46:22] and to wash it away
[1:46:24] what's he doing he's uncovering sons and
[1:46:27] daughters of god
[1:46:29] we are uncovered by the washing of water
[1:46:32] by the word
[1:46:34] it's washing away the filth of the world
[1:46:38] i don't know that's what he's doing this
[1:46:39] is why jesus said
[1:46:41] sanctify them through thy truth by thy
[1:46:44] word that word is true
[1:46:47] amen hallelujah he made a way
[1:46:51] through his altar his altar
[1:46:56] his altar was not just there at calvary
[1:46:58] where did that altar begin where was
[1:47:00] that altar
[1:47:01] right here where he surrendered
[1:47:04] his will to the will of the father
[1:47:09] it's very very simple it's dying out to
[1:47:11] sell
[1:47:12] it's surrendering you surrender and then
[1:47:16] god takes you
[1:47:18] to the baptism of the holy ghost god
[1:47:20] takes you
[1:47:22] into that place god takes you you have
[1:47:24] need of healing
[1:47:25] god takes you into your hearing god
[1:47:28] takes you
[1:47:29] into what you have needed because it's a
[1:47:31] promise of god
[1:47:32] and when we come according to the word
[1:47:34] of god then the laws of god
[1:47:36] operate according to that word
[1:47:42] brother graham talks about this
[1:47:43] loosening and he says
[1:47:47] he says i'm trying to get you to cut
[1:47:49] loose to have a starting place
[1:47:52] and he talks about even he says how the
[1:47:55] women are dressing
[1:47:56] see sometimes these things to the world
[1:47:59] that just like well you know that paul
[1:48:00] was a
[1:48:01] old woman hater paul wasn't a woman
[1:48:03] hater paul could say
[1:48:04] let him that's spiritual acknowledge
[1:48:07] that the things that i have wrote to you
[1:48:09] are the commandments of the lord
[1:48:12] paul wrote the hair shouldn't be cut
[1:48:16] paul wrote to wear modest clothing
[1:48:20] that whole word modest means
[1:48:21] free-flowing
[1:48:24] see it's an evil spirit that anoints
[1:48:27] women to want to display themselves
[1:48:30] they were meant to be displayed like
[1:48:31] that let me tell you if you display
[1:48:33] yourself like that
[1:48:35] you'll also get the results where you
[1:48:37] have others that are filled with them
[1:48:39] kinds of desires
[1:48:41] but it's holiness unto god his word
[1:48:44] brings about holiness in our lives
[1:48:48] it's obedience to his word
[1:48:52] there's no other way around it let me
[1:48:55] just let me just deal with this here
[1:48:58] he says now sometimes he said people he
[1:49:00] said when i make that statement about
[1:49:02] clothing and
[1:49:03] what you wear is that sometimes they say
[1:49:05] oh that's just a little thing
[1:49:08] who's who who's saying it's a little
[1:49:11] thing
[1:49:12] amen and furthermore who gave you the
[1:49:15] right to say it's a little thing
[1:49:18] you're exhausting yourself above the
[1:49:20] word
[1:49:21] when you call things well that's just a
[1:49:23] little thing yeah
[1:49:24] that's just a little weakness you're
[1:49:26] exalting that above god's word
[1:49:30] we have to exalt the word remember the
[1:49:32] word is to be carried
[1:49:34] above the heart
[1:49:37] we see a system right now
[1:49:40] the mother of harlots and her daughters
[1:49:46] those denominations they've exalted
[1:49:49] man's teaching above god
[1:49:52] and they call it god but it don't
[1:49:55] produce god
[1:49:56] in the people it produces emotion
[1:49:59] and it produces everything else it
[1:50:01] produces
[1:50:02] intellectualism but it doesn't bring god
[1:50:05] down in their lives
[1:50:07] [Applause]
[1:50:08] but god he steps in his word
[1:50:12] to come down into our lives
[1:50:15] that we would be reflections of him
[1:50:19] you don't want to be known by church
[1:50:20] name you want to be known by the name of
[1:50:24] jesus christ
[1:50:26] that when the word speaks to you you say
[1:50:29] yes papa yes
[1:50:32] papa
[1:50:36] hallelujah
[1:50:39] it's a little thing brother brown said
[1:50:42] you've got to start somewhere
[1:50:45] amen
[1:50:48] why not begin with your abcs cut loose
[1:50:50] of the worldly looks
[1:50:54] let the hair grow get the earrings out
[1:50:56] get the pants
[1:50:57] throw them away oh brother samuel
[1:51:01] you know you can't do that it's got to
[1:51:03] be god i
[1:51:04] that spirit is not welcome here
[1:51:08] that passive spirit of well it's got to
[1:51:11] be god do it brother samuel
[1:51:13] i agree but it takes the spirit of god
[1:51:16] he's calling it out and letting you know
[1:51:18] you can't inherit the kingdom of god if
[1:51:21] you keep walking that way
[1:51:23] you've got to separate from that
[1:51:26] [Music]
[1:51:28] what do i do be like david i hate god
[1:51:31] what you hate
[1:51:34] hallelujah
[1:51:37] i stand for righteousness
[1:51:41] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:51:44] and cut loose of the worldly looks and
[1:51:47] become a prisoner to christ
[1:51:49] just keep on cut loose of everything
[1:51:52] till finally the last line is cut loose
[1:51:57] there might be one line cut you might
[1:51:59] say brother samuel
[1:52:00] i have i got like 10 lines keep cutting
[1:52:04] here you come back to me maybe by
[1:52:05] midweek oh
[1:52:07] two lines were cut away then here you
[1:52:09] come back
[1:52:10] my five lines went away you know what's
[1:52:12] happening you're getting stronger
[1:52:14] you're building up let me just tell you
[1:52:16] it doesn't happen if you just leave
[1:52:18] out of here and you just go on back
[1:52:20] about your normal everyday life
[1:52:22] you just take it out of here and say
[1:52:23] well boy i'm not a good service today
[1:52:25] my that was real good but it's time to
[1:52:27] apply that word
[1:52:29] it's time to get down to business and
[1:52:31] say god this is what i need in my life
[1:52:34] [Applause]
[1:52:36] oh god i wish i had the strength to
[1:52:37] preach it the way i feel it
[1:52:40] keep on cutting to you everything is
[1:52:42] loose
[1:52:46] then you're a prisoner then you're in
[1:52:48] his grip
[1:52:51] the scripture said follow follow peace
[1:52:54] with all men hebrews 12 14
[1:52:56] and holiness without which no man can
[1:52:59] see
[1:53:00] the lord brother says if you don't
[1:53:02] become like god
[1:53:03] you won't see him amen
[1:53:07] you got to become like him then then
[1:53:10] you'll see him this is why
[1:53:13] as he writes that we have an altar in
[1:53:15] hebrews 13
[1:53:17] that they which serve that in the
[1:53:19] tabernacle have no right to eat
[1:53:21] in this altar see that they were granted
[1:53:24] rights to eat there
[1:53:26] by the genealogy and birth that they
[1:53:28] were levites
[1:53:30] but paul is letting them know this altar
[1:53:33] belonged to them
[1:53:35] who are born of the spirit of god this
[1:53:38] altar belongs to sons and daughters of
[1:53:40] god
[1:53:40] what is an altar it's a place of
[1:53:42] sacrifice
[1:53:44] and in order for jesus that he might
[1:53:46] sanctify us
[1:53:47] with his own blood he suffered without
[1:53:50] the gate
[1:53:51] that's why the word calls us beyond
[1:53:54] our own camp it calls us beyond
[1:53:58] our own sound barrier it calls us beyond
[1:54:06] ourselves
[1:54:08] says it just just in this manner he goes
[1:54:09] and talking continue about the
[1:54:11] the dressing and the wearing of things
[1:54:12] and cutting a hair and going back into
[1:54:15] this
[1:54:15] he says now don't try to be like the
[1:54:17] first lady of the land
[1:54:19] be like god empty yourself up
[1:54:23] so that christ can pour himself into you
[1:54:26] and you can be really filled with the
[1:54:29] holy spirit
[1:54:32] let me close in this galatians 5 19. now
[1:54:37] look how the spirit of god brings this
[1:54:38] paul brings us down to the galatian
[1:54:40] church
[1:54:41] because here he says now the works of
[1:54:44] the flesh are manifest which are these
[1:54:46] adultery fornication uncleanliness
[1:54:49] lassiviousness
[1:54:50] idolatry witchcraft hatred variants
[1:54:53] emulations
[1:54:54] wrath strife seditions heresies
[1:54:57] envyings murders drunkenness revelings
[1:55:00] and such like
[1:55:01] of the which i tell you before as i've
[1:55:03] also told you in times past
[1:55:05] that they which do such things
[1:55:08] shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:55:16] key word they that do
[1:55:19] to do means you are content
[1:55:23] with it right paul is dealing with you
[1:55:26] cannot live see see it comes into these
[1:55:29] places here
[1:55:30] where it's things that people are
[1:55:32] continuous
[1:55:34] envies
[1:55:38] bless god if they tread on me i'll give
[1:55:40] them a piece of my mind
[1:55:43] nobody treads on me nobody says anything
[1:55:47] against me
[1:55:48] they'll
[1:55:51] that don't sound like a lamb
[1:55:56] he can't come to that because it ain't a
[1:55:58] lamb
[1:56:01] nobody's going to push me around or
[1:56:05] this still being there that if things
[1:56:07] ain't going
[1:56:08] your way oh my
[1:56:12] everybody's going to know about it you
[1:56:14] give everybody the
[1:56:16] silent treatment i'm going to make them
[1:56:19] pay
[1:56:20] that ain't the spirit of god
[1:56:23] now let me just tell you this there's a
[1:56:25] part of what we've been dealing with on
[1:56:26] thursday
[1:56:27] where your flesh are my flesh and my
[1:56:30] spirit
[1:56:30] even after being sealed with the spirit
[1:56:32] of god i have to bring it in subjection
[1:56:34] but i no longer live at this address
[1:56:39] this is not who i'm known to be come on
[1:56:42] now
[1:56:43] i'm not who i'm known to be i'm not that
[1:56:45] same person
[1:56:46] i have to bring my flesh and subjection
[1:56:48] what paul is saying is
[1:56:49] is that if you're still content with
[1:56:51] these things saying that's just a small
[1:56:53] thing
[1:56:53] this is just a little thing oh you don't
[1:56:55] know my past you don't know my
[1:56:57] upbringing you don't know there's no
[1:56:58] excuses
[1:57:01] there's no excuses there's liberty to
[1:57:04] set you free
[1:57:06] there's liberty in jesus christ to set
[1:57:09] you free to sanctify
[1:57:10] you to cleanse you remember the
[1:57:13] sanctifying i'm closing
[1:57:15] is to make you ready to be filled
[1:57:19] with the spirit of god you see
[1:57:23] every one of us can you remember when
[1:57:27] god dealt with our life and you repented
[1:57:32] you just felt like my goodness it just
[1:57:33] felt like the lord of the world
[1:57:36] it still no doubt had you know all sorts
[1:57:38] of the love of the world was still
[1:57:40] within your life and maybe habits and
[1:57:42] things like but
[1:57:43] you just felt like whew man the lord's
[1:57:47] been lifted
[1:57:48] and it's a good feeling it's a work of
[1:57:51] the holy spirit
[1:57:53] that has dealt with your heart to bring
[1:57:55] you to that place
[1:57:56] to make peace with god but it's with the
[1:58:00] purpose
[1:58:01] that he might not just sanctify
[1:58:05] because sanctification is compound
[1:58:08] cleaned
[1:58:08] and set aside for certain god is drawing
[1:58:12] him
[1:58:13] that he himself can come and live inside
[1:58:16] amen i will be their god i will walk
[1:58:21] and talk in them they shall be
[1:58:24] my sons and daughters i will be their
[1:58:27] father
[1:58:29] this is god's promise i see
[1:58:32] to many people can hear this and what a
[1:58:35] blessed people you are
[1:58:37] i'll say that we are that when the word
[1:58:39] could deal with our hearts
[1:58:42] it's not something where we come to a
[1:58:43] place of just we were looking for a
[1:58:45] stopping place
[1:58:47] like elisha when that mantle struck our
[1:58:50] life
[1:58:52] i want a double portion i want that
[1:58:56] life i want him you've not been drawn to
[1:59:00] a church
[1:59:01] it's him that's why i'm just walking in
[1:59:04] the water baptism
[1:59:05] that ain't enough it's a step but the
[1:59:07] objective why were you baptized
[1:59:10] in the name of jesus christ and repented
[1:59:12] why is it that you cry
[1:59:14] you cry to god and say god sanctify my
[1:59:17] life
[1:59:17] from the things of the world that you
[1:59:19] might be filled
[1:59:20] with the holy ghost that you might
[1:59:23] receive that earnest of your inheritance
[1:59:27] and be a manifested son and daughter of
[1:59:29] god
[1:59:31] well you'll not be perfect in yourself
[1:59:33] but you'll have the perfection
[1:59:34] of his life and his nature on the inside
[1:59:37] of you
[1:59:39] where now he is alive inside of you
[1:59:43] there's been a passing there's been a
[1:59:45] change a passing from death unto life
[1:59:49] and this is what paul said and i close
[1:59:50] with this scripture
[1:59:54] what we read here in first corinthians 6
[1:59:56] all those things that paul
[1:59:58] read and said be not deceived and went
[2:00:00] through all of them and said
[2:00:01] shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[2:00:03] here's what he said in verse 11
[2:00:05] and such were some
[2:00:08] of you
[2:00:16] the scripture even in hebrews 11 would
[2:00:19] say
[2:00:19] rehab the harlot that's left there in
[2:00:23] hebrews 11
[2:00:24] that you and i can identify who that is
[2:00:27] but it's also to let you and i know
[2:00:30] this is who she was but the transforming
[2:00:34] power of god came upon rahab's life
[2:00:38] that's what she used to be
[2:00:41] that's what you used to be known as
[2:00:45] [Music]
[2:00:46] and such were some of you but you are
[2:00:50] washed you are sanctified
[2:00:53] you are justified in the name of the
[2:00:56] lord jesus and by the spirit
[2:00:59] of our god
[2:01:02] love of the world is gone
[2:01:08] he's the love of your life he's your
[2:01:12] life
[2:01:13] he's my all in all
[2:01:16] even when things would come about your
[2:01:18] life and if there's something that
[2:01:20] that that you've said even a thought
[2:01:22] that's been wrong
[2:01:24] the spirit of god the dove on the inside
[2:01:26] he who is the sanctifier
[2:01:29] it moves up in your life he said lord
[2:01:30] forgive me
[2:01:32] because your desire is what he
[2:01:36] longed for and what jesus prayed for
[2:01:39] that they might be where i am
[2:01:42] he prayed for our fellowship amen
[2:01:46] was fellowship an expression of a son
[2:01:49] and daughter of god
[2:01:51] oh my when my wife and i we we got
[2:01:53] married oh i
[2:01:54] i wanted children and you know we
[2:01:57] wait until you know god's time and so
[2:01:59] forth but i i can remember as it got
[2:02:01] close and god began to deal with
[2:02:03] her heart in dealing with my heart this
[2:02:05] might sound funny to you but
[2:02:08] i can remember sometimes waking up on
[2:02:10] saturday mornings
[2:02:11] and here but thought my what will it be
[2:02:14] like to hear
[2:02:16] you know the movement of that diaper
[2:02:17] running through the room
[2:02:20] and you know you just you have to
[2:02:21] imagine they're calling out daddy
[2:02:25] and yet she wasn't even expecting at the
[2:02:27] time
[2:02:29] but i never forget when i came home that
[2:02:31] one night real late from

[2:16:56] doesn't know you as their savior this
[2:16:57] morning
[2:16:58] may they surrender to that lord if
[2:17:01] there's one lord that doesn't know the
[2:17:02] sanctifying power of the blood of the
[2:17:04] lord jesus
[2:17:06] may they come to know that lord there's
[2:17:08] one that doesn't know you in the power
