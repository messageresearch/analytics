[29:03] 7 and 8. i have uh
[29:06] brother paul and sister susie from my
[29:08] church here tonight
[29:16] amen i want to read starting at verse
[29:20] seven
[29:22] and moses called unto joshua and said it
[29:24] to him in the sight of all israel
[29:26] be strong and of a good courage
[29:29] for thou must go with this people unto
[29:32] the land which the lord hath sworn
[29:34] unto their fathers to give them and thou
[29:37] shalt cause them to inherit it
[29:39] and the lord he it is that doeth go
[29:42] before thee
[29:43] he will be with thee he will not fail
[29:45] thee neither forsake thee
[29:47] fear not neither be dismayed
[29:50] amen you may be seated would like to
[29:54] speak tonight on is be strong and of a
[29:56] good courage
[29:59] be strong and have a good courage
[30:03] when israel was on their journey to the
[30:06] promised land there was a process
[30:08] that they went through there was three
[30:10] stages to their journey
[30:13] and god had given abraham
[30:17] the promise and they were on their
[30:21] journey to inherit
[30:22] the promise and they
[30:25] uh the three stages of the journey is
[30:28] justified by faith sanctified through
[30:32] the offering of his blood
[30:34] which christ had not yet come
[30:38] he was leading them he was in the he was
[30:40] it was the logos of god
[30:42] in the pillar of fire leading them but
[30:44] he had not come down yet
[30:46] and come flesh and so they had to offer
[30:49] up the blood of bulls and goats
[30:51] for their sin for an offering
[30:55] but and it was uh uh
[30:59] it was very fragile
[31:02] and they had to keep coming back time
[31:05] and time again
[31:06] making new offerings but that was part
[31:09] of their sanctification
[31:11] and then finally they came up to the
[31:13] promised land
[31:15] which was the third
[31:18] stage of the journey the third stage of
[31:21] this process of coming
[31:24] and they had not received yet
[31:28] their promise but they were on their
[31:30] journey to receive their promise
[31:33] and the the problem then came
[31:36] when they come to cadiz barnea and we
[31:38] know of course they sent out spies
[31:41] and we know that there was
[31:44] ten spies that came back and said the
[31:47] land is full of giants the cities are
[31:49] walled
[31:50] we're not able to go over there and take
[31:52] it
[31:53] and we know there was two joshua and
[31:55] caleb said
[31:56] we're more than able to take it and
[32:00] they were able to say that because they
[32:02] weren't looking at the circumstance
[32:04] what they were looking at was the
[32:06] promise
[32:08] but the other people got their eyes off
[32:10] the promise
[32:11] and began to look at the circumstance
[32:14] and so
[32:15] they come through two works of grace
[32:18] they come through justification and
[32:19] sanctification
[32:21] but they like many people have done they
[32:24] failed to go
[32:25] on to the holy spirit
[32:28] and uh you know they
[32:31] uh they were always questioning moses
[32:35] everything that moses did why every
[32:38] decision he made they questioned it
[32:41] and there's folks like that today they
[32:43] question everything you do
[32:46] they question the pastor on every
[32:47] decision he makes on every
[32:49] stand that he takes why why is he doing
[32:51] this why is he doing that and i think if
[32:54] he ought to do this and i think he ought
[32:55] to do that and you know if
[32:57] if that would be the way god would want
[32:59] it then god would have set it up that
[33:01] way
[33:03] you know there'd be a suggestion box in
[33:05] the back of the church
[33:07] and you would suggest to the pastor what
[33:09] he should do
[33:11] concerning each and every thing and then
[33:12] he would read those and go by that
[33:15] and then we'd have a bunch of confusion
[33:17] because everybody would have different
[33:18] suggestions
[33:21] but god don't lead that way god is the
[33:25] leader he
[33:26] is the shepherd of the flock and he
[33:29] leads the flock
[33:30] through someone that he's placed there
[33:32] as a shepherd
[33:35] amen he doesn't lead brother branham's
[33:38] toddler says he don't lead through a
[33:40] board of directors
[33:41] he doesn't lead through a board of
[33:43] trustees he doesn't lead through
[33:45] a board of deacons god leads
[33:48] through a pastor a shepherd that he
[33:51] places there
[33:53] and we've seen what happened to those
[33:55] that constantly
[33:57] questioned moses they never went over
[34:00] because they came down to the promised
[34:02] land and as they had questioned him on
[34:03] everything else
[34:04] they questioned him about this are you i
[34:06] don't think we can take this
[34:08] moses mostly
[34:11] it's promised to us but they doubted
[34:15] and because they doubted they died every
[34:18] one of them in the wilderness
[34:21] there was two said we're looking at the
[34:24] promise
[34:25] we know we're able to go over there
[34:27] we're going to get the holy ghost
[34:29] because it's promised to us
[34:34] what happens you know there's three
[34:36] courts and
[34:37] i know you're all familiar with the
[34:39] three courts of the body and the three
[34:41] courts
[34:42] of the tabernacle in the wilderness
[34:44] there was the the outer court the inner
[34:46] court and the holies of holies
[34:48] and what a lot of people do they come
[34:50] through sanctification
[34:51] justification and sanctification and
[34:54] that just brings them
[34:55] into the outer part you know they
[34:59] and uh they eat there but you see the
[35:02] manna that fell
[35:03] out there why it only lasted
[35:06] uh for a day and then the next day
[35:10] it had worms and it cankered
[35:13] and so they had to have more fresh manna
[35:16] to fall
[35:18] but they had took some mana that fell
[35:21] on the very first day that it fell they
[35:24] put it in a pot
[35:25] and they took that into the holies of
[35:27] holies and because it was in the holies
[35:29] of holies
[35:30] it never tankered it never it never
[35:32] spoiled
[35:33] it was always fresh and see what happens
[35:37] is a lot of people are
[35:38] they only make it through justification
[35:41] and sanctification and they stop
[35:43] there and so they're out there in that
[35:45] outer court
[35:46] and they're eating the food that's only
[35:47] going to last so long
[35:50] and that's why they go from revival to
[35:52] revival
[35:53] while the revival is on they're okay
[35:55] once the revival's over
[35:57] they're back out into the world again
[35:59] they're
[36:00] they're pretty good one time and then
[36:03] the next year they're not so good
[36:05] it's because they're out there in the
[36:07] outer court where they need to do
[36:09] come on into the holies of holies in
[36:12] other words what they need is
[36:13] to get born again to get the
[36:17] baptism of the holy spirit
[36:24] amen pardon me
[36:34] you know the bible says that we are
[36:37] written epistles read of all men
[36:41] so it's better to live a sermon than it
[36:44] is to preach one.
[36:47] live a sermon every one of us can live a
[36:49] sermon
[36:51] we can live the word what a lot of
[36:54] people do is they
[36:55] they come through justification and
[36:58] sanctification
[36:59] then they profess a high calling but
[37:01] they don't live up to it
[37:04] they can't the only way that you can
[37:07] live that way
[37:08] is to have the holy ghost
[37:13] people say i i want to live right i want
[37:16] to do right but there's just seems to be
[37:18] so much hindrance like i can't do it
[37:20] it's because you need to press on in
[37:24] and you say what do i got to do receive
[37:26] it
[37:27] it's a promise see
[37:31] they had to go over there and possess
[37:34] the land
[37:36] and that's what we've got to do
[37:40] the bible says in ephesians
[37:43] 4 22 says
[37:46] that ye put off concerning the former
[37:49] conversation
[37:50] of the old man which is corrupt
[37:52] according to the deceitful lusts
[37:54] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[37:56] mind and that you put on the new man
[37:59] which
[37:59] which after god is created in
[38:01] righteousness and true holiness
[38:05] so burn every bridge behind you
[38:09] get on in there to the holies of holies
[38:12] and then burn
[38:13] every bridge that leads back to the
[38:15] world burning
[38:17] burn every barrier that was there to try
[38:20] to
[38:20] hinder you burn it and go on go forward
[38:24] god's promised it to you it's what he's
[38:26] calling you to
[38:28] it belongs to you just claim it
[38:33] amen now in joshua
[38:37] the first chapter
[38:42] god is speaking to joshua moses has
[38:44] passed from off the scene
[38:47] moses has already told joshua be strong
[38:49] enough of a good courage
[38:51] and you that you're going to take the
[38:53] people over to inherit the land which
[38:55] god has given them
[38:57] and now god's speaking to joshua in
[38:59] chapter in chapter 1
[39:01] verse 5 there shall not any man be able
[39:04] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[39:07] life
[39:09] as i was with moses so i will be with
[39:13] thee
[39:14] i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[39:18] when god told him that that was telling
[39:21] him a lot
[39:23] because moses was a man
[39:26] moses wasn't perfect moses
[39:30] made mistakes but god never forsook him
[39:33] god never left him god's not going to
[39:36] forsake you
[39:37] he's not going to leave you as he was
[39:40] with moses so he'll be with you
[39:42] through your failures through your
[39:44] mistakes through your shortcomings
[39:47] god's not going to forsake you because
[39:49] friends
[39:50] it's not on your power that you're going
[39:52] to make it to heaven
[39:54] it's on the power and righteousness of
[39:56] jesus christ
[39:58] he didn't say that you would present
[40:00] yourself he said
[40:02] i will present to myself
[40:05] amen
[40:09] be strong and of a good courage for unto
[40:11] this people shall thou divide for an
[40:13] inheritance the land
[40:14] which i swear unto their fathers to give
[40:16] them
[40:17] only be thou strong and very courageous
[40:20] that thou mayest observe to do according
[40:23] to all the law
[40:24] which moses my servant has commanded
[40:26] thee
[40:27] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[40:30] the left that thou mayest prosper
[40:32] wheresoever thou
[40:33] goest be strong and very courageous
[40:37] listen what he's telling him to be
[40:38] strong and courageous about
[40:41] that thou mayest observe to do according
[40:43] to all the law
[40:45] which moses my servant commanded thee
[40:50] amen be strong and very courageous
[40:55] and keep the word even if you got to
[40:58] stand alone
[40:59] even if it seems like there's everyone's
[41:02] tanning against you
[41:06] you know why there is a church here
[41:10] because god sent a man that was willing
[41:13] to stand
[41:14] alone if he had to to do the work that
[41:18] god had called him to do
[41:21] i'm not saying to glorify my father but
[41:24] that is the fact
[41:27] and there's many of you that were here
[41:29] from the start that can testify to that
[41:36] and that's what god calls every pastor
[41:38] to do be strong and very courageous to
[41:40] stand
[41:40] on the word no matter what nobody else
[41:43] says
[41:44] no matter whether they understand you or
[41:45] not stand on the word
[41:48] if they are seat of god they'll come to
[41:50] it
[41:53] we're human and because we're human
[41:56] god's got to have patience with us
[42:00] and god requires the pastors to have
[42:02] patience with us because we're human
[42:05] amen not everybody comes to
[42:09] at the same time at the same rate
[42:13] at the same pace
[42:16] there's a time for everyone
[42:20] amen god is long suffering
[42:28] hallelujah
[42:30] this book of the law shalt thou not
[42:33] depart
[42:34] out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate
[42:37] therein day and night that thou mayest
[42:39] observe to do according
[42:41] to all that is written therein for then
[42:44] thou
[42:44] shalt make thy way prosperous and thou
[42:47] shalt give
[42:48] shall have good success
[42:52] have not i commanded thee i wasn't a
[42:56] suggestion
[42:58] it wasn't just a good idea
[43:03] i have commanded thee be strong and of a
[43:07] good courage
[43:08] be not afraid neither be thou dismayed
[43:11] for the lord thy god
[43:13] it is with thee wheresoever thou
[43:16] goes friends look this journey we're on
[43:20] we're not on it by ourselves
[43:24] he's with us he's already made the
[43:28] journey
[43:29] and he made the way he said to where i
[43:33] i go away to prepare a place that where
[43:37] i
[43:37] am there you may be awesome
[43:41] and he's prepared he is the way amen
[43:48] and he shows brother branham said
[43:51] he called it journey in mercy
[43:55] he shows journey mercy
[44:00] he shows us mercy along our journey
[44:05] because as i said before the the blood
[44:08] of bulls and goats was fragile
[44:11] but since then christ has come
[44:14] and he shed his blood once
[44:18] and there anyone that comes under that
[44:21] shed
[44:22] blood is cleansed until the day of
[44:24] redemption
[44:26] amen and protected
[44:31] through the sanctifying process of the
[44:33] holy spirit
[44:35] once you receive the holy ghost then
[44:37] you're sealed
[44:39] to the day of redemption not just from
[44:42] one revival to the next
[44:45] i've seen people come to service and it
[44:47] was like every service they had to get
[44:49] saved
[44:51] because they they know they didn't live
[44:53] right throughout the week so every
[44:54] sunday night they had to come to the
[44:56] altar and get saved again
[45:02] but i'm going to tell you this if you're
[45:04] truly saved
[45:06] and you move right along through god's
[45:09] process
[45:10] and when you receive the holy ghost you
[45:13] don't even need to get saved again
[45:18] david didn't need to get saved again
[45:21] he said restoring me the joy of my
[45:24] salvation
[45:25] he didn't lose his salvation he just
[45:28] needed
[45:29] the joy of it restored and i think
[45:31] that's the way with many of us
[45:33] we need to get back to the way it was
[45:36] when we first got
[45:37] saved back to the feeling we had then
[45:41] back to the attitudes we had then back
[45:44] to the
[45:44] to where we looked and everywhere we
[45:47] looked we could see god
[45:51] [Applause]
[45:54] that newness never let that wear off
[45:58] many times after we've been around a
[46:00] while sometimes we get old and cranky
[46:06] we need to bring back the new again
[46:11] amen praise the lord
[46:16] the believers anchored until the day of
[46:18] redemption
[46:22] now brother adam says here
[46:27] in the message he says although you sin
[46:31] you've got an advocate tell god you're
[46:34] sorry come back that's the way to do it
[46:37] don't think you're cast off forever as
[46:40] long as you still have enough desire
[46:42] to come to this church come on god's
[46:44] still with you
[46:46] that's right sure he is yes
[46:49] he will just keep moving as long as he's
[46:52] called you
[46:53] he's still in the saving business to
[46:55] call you and he's calling and he's still
[46:57] wooing at your heart
[46:58] come on no matter what you've done god
[47:01] still wants to forgive you and take you
[47:02] back and love you a little bit
[47:04] hug you up to his bosom give you a few
[47:07] spiritual vitamins put you back in
[47:09] church
[47:09] in your position again he came to redeem
[47:12] to seek to save that which was lost
[47:23] now maybe tonight you're in the process
[47:24] of conversion
[47:26] maybe you haven't reached that stage if
[47:27] you have praise god
[47:31] pray for those who are still in that
[47:33] process
[47:35] amen instead of looking around
[47:38] and criticizing people
[47:41] amen pray for them
[47:48] when you receive the holy ghost
[47:51] that's when you're born again you're
[47:53] converted
[47:56] but conversion is not complete until
[48:00] you're sealed
[48:03] now the boxcar might be on its road to
[48:05] its destination
[48:06] but it had not sealed yet until
[48:08] everything's put in place
[48:12] and once everything's in there then
[48:15] they seal it up and she's ready
[48:18] and she's on her way
[48:23] amen
[48:27] brother brahm says here in the message
[48:28] of what is the holy ghost he says
[48:30] there's a vast
[48:30] difference between just a christian
[48:34] and a holy ghost-filled christian
[48:40] there is a christian professed to be a
[48:42] christian
[48:44] but if this christian has not yet been
[48:46] filled with the holy ghost he's only in
[48:48] the process of being a christian
[48:51] he has professed to believe it he's
[48:53] working to it
[48:54] but god has not given him the spirit of
[48:56] the holy ghost
[48:58] he's not yet reached that goal with god
[49:00] that god recognized it
[49:02] now god made a covenant with abraham
[49:05] after he called abraham which is a type
[49:07] of calling the believer today
[49:09] and he called abraham and abraham moved
[49:11] out of his country and went into a
[49:13] strange land
[49:14] and dwelt among strange people and that
[49:17] was the type of when god calls a man to
[49:19] stop his meanness
[49:20] repent of his sins he turns then from
[49:23] the crowd that he was in to live in a
[49:25] new crowd
[49:26] among new types of people and then after
[49:29] god found
[49:29] abraham to be faithful to the promise
[49:31] that god gave him
[49:33] that he would have a child and through
[49:34] this child the earth would be blessed
[49:36] then god confirmed his faith by giving
[49:39] him a sign
[49:40] and that sign was circumcision and
[49:43] circumcision is a type
[49:45] of the holy spirit
[49:52] once god
[49:56] sees your faith then he'll seal you with
[50:00] the holy ghost
[50:04] now this promise is to all them that
[50:07] believe
[50:09] as many as the lord our god shall call
[50:15] amen
[50:19] ephesians 4 and 30 says
[50:23] and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[50:24] whereby you're sealed unto the day of
[50:26] redemption
[50:28] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[50:30] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[50:32] from you
[50:33] with all malice now when i read that
[50:37] what that tells me is that after you
[50:39] receive the holy ghost
[50:40] you still got to deal with this flesh
[50:43] because
[50:44] the the flesh doesn't get the holy ghost
[50:47] so the flesh still has the same
[50:51] uh things that that that it drew you to
[50:55] before you came to the lord and you've
[50:57] got to die to this flesh
[51:01] the flesh can still remember the things
[51:03] you did
[51:04] the flesh can still remember what they
[51:06] felt like what it tastes like
[51:08] in in the whole experience of it
[51:15] so you got to die to this flesh
[51:23] so you're going to have to battle
[51:24] against bitterness and wrath and anger
[51:27] and evil speaking
[51:29] because this flesh is out to do those
[51:32] things
[51:34] but if you have the holy ghost then
[51:39] if you make a mistake the holy ghost
[51:41] will bring you back around to make you
[51:43] correct the mistake
[51:47] you won't just go on that way
[51:50] but you'll be putting these things off
[51:52] from yourself
[51:55] and be ye kind one to another
[52:01] now sometimes i find that people
[52:04] don't have so much trouble being kind to
[52:07] other people
[52:09] but sometimes they have trouble being
[52:11] kind within their own families
[52:16] they get to know each other they know
[52:18] each other's faults they
[52:20] they and you know what leave those
[52:22] things alone
[52:24] don't go back and dig that stuff up we
[52:27] know they used to do this and they used
[52:29] to do that
[52:30] yeah i used to let's not talk about that
[52:34] let's not talk about the old man let's
[52:36] leave that guy buried
[52:38] [Applause]
[52:41] amen he put
[52:44] your sins in the sea of god's
[52:46] forgetfulness
[52:49] and brother dan daisy always said and he
[52:51] posted a sign that says no fishing
[52:57] stay out of there amen don't be bringing
[53:00] up that old man
[53:04] now this cleansing process
[53:08] that that you have it's constant
[53:13] we need it to be constant not just
[53:17] one time or one revival
[53:20] but we're in this flesh we're human so
[53:22] we need
[53:23] a constant cleansing process
[53:27] and that's why the bible says we have an
[53:30] advocate with the father
[53:32] it's jesus didn't just take our place
[53:35] and that was the end of it
[53:37] but we've got an advocate with the
[53:39] father
[53:40] but if any man sin all he's got to do
[53:44] is ask forgiveness with jesus and jesus
[53:47] is
[53:47] our advocate before the father
[53:51] i like the way that god showed brother
[53:54] branham about that blood bumper
[53:57] you know god doesn't even
[54:00] see it because he's looking through the
[54:02] blood of jesus christ
[54:04] so don't let the devil condemn you
[54:08] you see there's a difference between
[54:09] being convicted
[54:11] and condemned conviction brings you
[54:14] to make things right get back
[54:18] on track but condemnation is to put you
[54:22] down amen
[54:24] so don't listen to the condemnation of
[54:26] the devil
[54:27] because god doesn't see it as long as
[54:30] you're under the blood
[54:32] now i'm not talking about going out and
[54:34] just living in sin
[54:35] i'm talking about the christian who's
[54:38] born again
[54:38] filled with the holy ghost but is human
[54:42] and makes mistakes that's under the
[54:45] blood
[54:47] and all you got to do to keep it there
[54:49] is just confess your sins and he's
[54:52] faithful and just
[54:53] to forgive you and cleanse you from all
[54:56] unrighteousness
[55:00] he's ever living making intercession for
[55:04] the christians praise the lord
[55:06] and that keeps the christian clean both
[55:08] day and night
[55:16] safely tucked in by the holy spirit
[55:21] he that heareth my words and believeth
[55:24] on him that sent me
[55:25] has everlasting life and shall never
[55:27] come into the judgment
[55:29] but it's passed from death and to life
[55:33] the bible says has never come into
[55:34] condemnat the condemnation but it means
[55:36] the judgment
[55:39] the christian doesn't have to go through
[55:43] the judgment
[55:44] because we're judged here judgment
[55:47] begins
[55:48] for the christian at the house of the
[55:50] lord
[55:51] and we judge ourselves by the word as it
[55:54] comes forth
[55:55] and when it points out things in our
[55:57] life instead of us going around saying
[55:58] man i'll tell you what he really fried
[56:00] me today
[56:01] instead of that just get right
[56:05] i've come and preached sermons years ago
[56:07] in my church
[56:08] and i'd have people come up to me
[56:09] afterwards and say man you really were
[56:11] whipping us today
[56:13] and i didn't even come for that i didn't
[56:16] even think i was
[56:20] but i didn't know i don't know
[56:21] everything that's going on but he does
[56:24] and you do you know what's going on with
[56:28] you
[56:28] you know where you're at amen
[56:33] so if you get your toes stepped on don't
[56:35] pull them back
[56:38] just get right amen
[56:44] christ is our attorney
[56:48] we mentioned that i think on sunday
[56:50] about what job
[56:51] said about is there a days man
[56:55] that can put one hand on a holy man and
[56:58] the other hand on us
[56:59] on a sinful man a holy god and another
[57:02] hand on a sinful man
[57:06] so he's our attorney and he took our
[57:09] place
[57:11] and he pled our case and
[57:14] told the father they're they were
[57:16] ignorant
[57:18] they didn't mean to do it
[57:21] he's our attorney
[57:24] now do you know why you get an attorney
[57:27] in in this natural life
[57:29] because they know the law and you don't
[57:32] they study it they went to school for it
[57:35] and you didn't
[57:37] that's why i think any man that says i
[57:39] don't want an attorney i'll just stand
[57:40] for myself
[57:41] here in this this day in this court
[57:43] there's something wrong with them
[57:46] because let he that thinks he knows so
[57:49] much
[57:50] he's going to get himself into a lot of
[57:52] trouble
[57:53] but you get you get a lawyer that knows
[57:55] and i'm going to tell you something
[57:56] we've got a lawyer that's been there
[57:59] we've got a lawyer that died for our
[58:02] sins he took all of our sins on him
[58:04] and he was sent to hell for our sins and
[58:08] he came back and he has the keys of
[58:11] death and hell and he's conquered the
[58:13] devil
[58:14] he's conquered death he's conquered hell
[58:17] he's conquered sin and he did it for you
[58:20] and i
[58:22] he took our place and pled our case
[58:26] amen that's why today you're free
[58:34] amen
[58:36] brother branham was talking in a message
[58:38] be not afraid and he was talking about a
[58:40] little methodist preacher friend of his
[58:42] and he said he brought him up there
[58:44] and laid in the room the other night
[58:46] until three o'clock in the morning
[58:48] and said he he went down the river some
[58:50] prayer praying
[58:52] and his wife had done got the holy ghost
[58:56] then last night he come through and he
[58:59] liked to tore up the place
[59:00] run out and got his brother and
[59:01] sister-in-law and they got the holy
[59:03] ghost i'm telling you the methodists are
[59:05] going to get a shaking down in kentucky
[59:07] in a few days
[59:08] it's real god's holy spirit and it's for
[59:11] the methodist and for the baptist
[59:13] let me tell you denominational people
[59:15] here of methodist and presbyterian
[59:17] when these people here call themselves
[59:19] pentecost
[59:20] that don't mean it's an organization you
[59:22] can't organize pentecost
[59:24] you can have a denomination but
[59:26] pentecost is an experience
[59:28] for whosoever will let him come whether
[59:32] he's baptist presbyterian methodist
[59:34] black yellow brown white don't make any
[59:37] difference what color he is
[59:39] how big he is how little he is how low
[59:41] he is
[59:42] how bad she is doesn't make a bit of
[59:44] difference
[59:45] it's for whosoever will it's god's
[59:48] cleansing process
[59:50] for his church god's not known by
[59:53] intellectual powers
[59:55] god is known by experience through the
[59:57] holy ghost
[1:00:03] i like that old song i was there when it
[1:00:05] happened
[1:00:07] [Applause]
[1:00:08] amen the devil tries to tell you
[1:00:14] point out all your sin tell you
[1:00:17] that you didn't get it but the song says
[1:00:20] i was there when it happened so i guess
[1:00:21] i ought to know
[1:00:24] amen it why it was an
[1:00:27] experience hallelujah
[1:00:34] the devil will always come and try to
[1:00:36] make you doubt that experience
[1:00:38] he'll point out this and point out that
[1:00:40] and point out this
[1:00:41] and you'll say but i had this experience
[1:00:43] yeah but what about this and what about
[1:00:45] this and what about this
[1:00:48] right when i'm saying these things
[1:00:51] i'm not talking about somebody just
[1:00:53] walking out from service to service and
[1:00:54] just living out in sin
[1:00:57] i'm talking about mistakes people make
[1:01:00] because they're human
[1:01:01] because we're in the flesh that didn't
[1:01:03] get the holy ghost
[1:01:06] when i got the holy ghost this outside
[1:01:08] body didn't get it
[1:01:10] this outside body is a reflection of
[1:01:13] the fall this outside body is a
[1:01:16] reflection of sin
[1:01:18] what sin did it's getting old
[1:01:21] it's getting it's already gone bald
[1:01:24] it's it's going grave with what it's got
[1:01:27] left
[1:01:28] you know and and and it's going downhill
[1:01:32] it's a reflection of the fall but one of
[1:01:35] these days
[1:01:37] this outside is going to start
[1:01:38] reflecting what's already took place
[1:01:41] on the inside amen the inside is a
[1:01:45] reflection of eternal life
[1:01:47] the inside is a reflection of another
[1:01:50] body
[1:01:51] that is to come yet hallelujah
[1:01:57] the approach to this birth is it's like
[1:02:00] any other process of anything that lives
[1:02:02] anything that lives before it can live
[1:02:05] again it's got to die first
[1:02:08] so we had to die first we've got to die
[1:02:10] to self
[1:02:12] we got to die with our lamb our lamb
[1:02:14] died
[1:02:15] we've got to die with it like abel died
[1:02:18] with his lamb on the altar
[1:02:20] we've got to die with our lamb die to
[1:02:22] self
[1:02:23] amen you've got to die like
[1:02:27] christ died you got to die on the altar
[1:02:31] hallelujah you got to die to your own
[1:02:35] thinking to be born again to his
[1:02:37] thinking
[1:02:39] now i have uh
[1:02:43] had the i say i always say the privilege
[1:02:47] of being able to observe ducks
[1:02:50] we had some and
[1:02:54] ducks are little baby ducks when you get
[1:02:57] them you know
[1:02:58] little yellow things or whatever color
[1:03:00] they are and they're cute and whatever
[1:03:03] you know
[1:03:04] and they don't know nothing and but the
[1:03:07] first time you ever show them water
[1:03:10] they go to it like they were born to it
[1:03:13] you don't have to teach them how to swim
[1:03:16] first time i put water down in there
[1:03:18] with them while they started diving
[1:03:19] under the water and swimming under the
[1:03:21] water and coming back up and just
[1:03:22] playing and frolicking around just
[1:03:24] little baby ducks
[1:03:27] brother brown talked about it duck that
[1:03:30] had been born in a chicken yard and he
[1:03:33] said
[1:03:34] you know chickens don't like water they
[1:03:36] they drink out of a little thing of
[1:03:38] water but they don't like to get in
[1:03:40] water chickens can't swim
[1:03:42] and not like a duck and
[1:03:46] it said uh they were going along one day
[1:03:49] and all of a sudden that duck caught a
[1:03:51] whiff of water
[1:03:53] and when he smelled that water he had
[1:03:55] never smelt water before in his life but
[1:03:58] when he smelt that water it called to
[1:04:00] him and away he went
[1:04:01] said that old mother him was cluck and
[1:04:03] stay away from there don't go to there
[1:04:05] don't do that
[1:04:06] but away in that water he went brother
[1:04:08] adam said we've got a big pool tonight
[1:04:10] and if you're smelling the water from
[1:04:13] heaven
[1:04:15] then you need to get to the water
[1:04:17] because that's the first step in the
[1:04:19] process
[1:04:20] is to be baptized in the name of the
[1:04:23] lord jesus christ
[1:04:25] amen for the remission of your sin
[1:04:29] repent and be baptized amen
[1:04:33] so he said if you got a whiff of heaven
[1:04:34] tonight
[1:04:36] that god keeps his word and you haven't
[1:04:38] received the holy ghost yet
[1:04:40] smell the water it's the first thing he
[1:04:42] said do
[1:04:43] repent from the bottom of your heart lay
[1:04:45] yourself on the sacrifice on the altar
[1:04:48] be con let the world be consumed
[1:04:51] born again of the spirit go through the
[1:04:54] right process
[1:04:55] not come and shake hands with a preacher
[1:04:57] put your name on the book but die
[1:04:59] so dead that you don't know the world no
[1:05:06] more
[1:05:09] now we spoke earlier about the three
[1:05:12] uh courts in the tabernacle
[1:05:17] now one time you know of it they brought
[1:05:21] aaron's rod into the holies of holies
[1:05:25] aaron's rod was a dead stick
[1:05:28] amen it had been cut down
[1:05:32] and no doubt whittled and
[1:05:35] hewed a little bit you know to where it
[1:05:37] would just be a good
[1:05:38] good staff you know for it
[1:05:41] and and so they i don't know what they
[1:05:45] did to preserve it but they would have
[1:05:46] done something to preserve it
[1:05:48] and then they brought it into the holies
[1:05:50] of holies
[1:05:52] and according to the scripture that dead
[1:05:54] dry stick
[1:05:56] butted forth amen blossomed
[1:06:00] and brought forth almonds amen
[1:06:05] you might come across people that you
[1:06:07] think there ain't nothing to be done
[1:06:09] about them
[1:06:10] but i'll tell you what i don't care who
[1:06:12] they are or what they've done or what
[1:06:14] they're in
[1:06:14] if you ever get into that holies of
[1:06:17] holies it'll
[1:06:18] bring dead dry sticks back to life
[1:06:20] [Applause]
[1:06:22] that's what people need that's how you
[1:06:25] you know
[1:06:26] you say well it seems like i just keep
[1:06:27] doing this and i keep doing that and i
[1:06:29] keep
[1:06:30] and i'm having such a hard time you need
[1:06:32] to get in the holies of holies
[1:06:36] amen
[1:06:41] take that dead life and lay it in the
[1:06:43] holies of holies a process of blood
[1:06:45] water and sanctification
[1:06:47] yeah hallelujah brother ram says if
[1:06:50] she's the honoriest woman in the city or
[1:06:52] the worst
[1:06:52] gambler there is you'll hear him stand
[1:06:55] some morning
[1:06:56] and give a testimony that'll shake the
[1:06:58] shingles on the top of the house
[1:07:01] hallelujah
[1:07:04] hallelujah hi some of you have known
[1:07:07] for years and years i know where you
[1:07:09] came from i knew your lives
[1:07:12] and i know your testimonies and you've
[1:07:15] got some great testimonies
[1:07:17] amen and you know
[1:07:20] there's some that have been raised
[1:07:23] their whole life pretty much around this
[1:07:25] message
[1:07:27] and that don't mean they don't got a
[1:07:28] great testimony they got a great
[1:07:30] testimony
[1:07:31] also because i'm going to tell you
[1:07:32] something there's a lot of folks that
[1:07:33] were raised around this message
[1:07:34] that are out there in the world not
[1:07:36] living it
[1:07:38] they don't want nothing to do with it
[1:07:39] they've turned their back on it not only
[1:07:40] that but they can't keep their mouth
[1:07:42] shut
[1:07:44] they got to try to find fault and that
[1:07:47] ain't good enough
[1:07:47] they got to post it on the internet
[1:07:52] god help them i would not want to be
[1:07:56] in their shoes because i'm going to tell
[1:07:58] you something friends i believe it's
[1:08:00] blasphemy
[1:08:02] i i that that's my opinion now i don't
[1:08:05] usually preach my opinion but that's my
[1:08:07] opinion i believe it's blasphemy
[1:08:09] because they're saying they're saying
[1:08:11] something against the work of the holy
[1:08:13] ghost
[1:08:18] once you come to christ i think we spoke
[1:08:21] about this on sunday
[1:08:23] then it's testing time it's time to be
[1:08:26] tested
[1:08:28] first come through a sanctifying process
[1:08:29] brother branham said then you must be
[1:08:31] tested
[1:08:32] in your life all of you had it
[1:08:36] see this testing time every son that
[1:08:39] cometh to god is first scourged
[1:08:41] chastened and chastised if we cannot
[1:08:44] stand chastisement then it shows
[1:08:46] we're not children of god we're bastards
[1:08:48] and not children of god
[1:08:50] but if you can stand chastisement
[1:08:51] knowing that all
[1:08:53] things work together for the good of
[1:08:56] them that love the lord
[1:08:59] everything
[1:09:02] i've been through things where i had
[1:09:05] somebody come up to me at the death of a
[1:09:07] loved one or something say
[1:09:08] i don't know what good can come out of
[1:09:10] this well the very person that said that
[1:09:12] to me got saved out of it
[1:09:17] something good came out of it
[1:09:23] all things work together for the good of
[1:09:25] them but love the lord
[1:09:27] amen i'm so glad he first loved me
[1:09:32] amen then he seals us with the holy
[1:09:35] ghost until the day of our redemption
[1:09:38] and then there's the things that we go
[1:09:40] through
[1:09:46] brother braham says in the breach
[1:09:48] between the seven church ages and the
[1:09:49] seven seals he said
[1:09:51] another thing a seal signifies is
[1:09:53] ownership
[1:09:55] the seal has a mark on it shows
[1:09:57] ownership
[1:09:58] and when you're bought by the blood of
[1:10:00] jesus christ and sealed by the holy
[1:10:02] ghost you're no longer belong
[1:10:03] to the world or anything pertaining to
[1:10:05] the world you are owned by
[1:10:07] god another thing is seal
[1:10:10] is security seal means you are secure
[1:10:15] now you that don't believe in eternal
[1:10:18] security i don't know
[1:10:19] but now but a seal signifies security to
[1:10:22] its destination
[1:10:24] woe into that guy that would try to
[1:10:26] break that seal and the holy spirit seal
[1:10:28] cannot be broken
[1:10:30] you've all heard me say that people said
[1:10:32] the devil made me do this
[1:10:34] no the devil didn't do it you just
[1:10:37] wasn't sealed in
[1:10:39] then because when you're sealed in he
[1:10:41] sealed out
[1:10:43] now you went out to him he couldn't get
[1:10:45] into you
[1:10:46] because the only way he could get into
[1:10:48] you is to come through the same process
[1:10:51] that you did he'd have to get saved
[1:10:53] sanctified and filled with the holy
[1:10:55] ghost and then he'd be your brother
[1:10:57] see so he didn't do it no you just went
[1:11:00] to the borderline
[1:11:01] and came back lusting for the things of
[1:11:04] the world
[1:11:05] uh what he means by the borderline he's
[1:11:07] talking about cadiz barnea
[1:11:09] they came up to the border of the
[1:11:11] promised land
[1:11:12] and he said they come to the border line
[1:11:14] and went back lusting for the things of
[1:11:16] the world
[1:11:17] never went all the way over into canaan
[1:11:20] across
[1:11:21] jordan the death to self
[1:11:26] the devil can't get you
[1:11:32] he can't do it because he has to as
[1:11:34] brother brown said come through the same
[1:11:36] process that you did
[1:11:39] he can't get you he can't come through
[1:11:42] that
[1:11:44] so no matter how powerful the devil may
[1:11:46] seem
[1:11:48] he's just a bluff because he's already
[1:11:51] been beat
[1:11:53] now as humans we couldn't take the devil
[1:11:57] on one on one ourselves
[1:12:00] but we don't have to because
[1:12:04] god told us he was going to go with us
[1:12:07] he said he would never leave us nor
[1:12:09] forsake us therefore he told us don't
[1:12:11] fear the devil
[1:12:13] don't be afraid of me because i'm with
[1:12:16] you
[1:12:18] and jesus has already defeated the devil
[1:12:23] so he's already lost
[1:12:34] hallelujah
[1:12:37] it's like a young man
[1:12:42] playing in a football game playing on
[1:12:44] he's playing on the line
[1:12:47] and uh the other
[1:12:50] the other team comes up to the line and
[1:12:52] they start talking all kinds of trash
[1:12:54] you know
[1:12:55] and he just says look at the scoreboard
[1:13:00] you can talk all the trash you want but
[1:13:02] look at the scoreboard devil
[1:13:04] you've already lost amen
[1:13:07] praise the lord
[1:13:08] [Applause]
[1:13:11] now we're going through a process to
[1:13:13] come to that new body
[1:13:17] amen we got born again
[1:13:21] we got the holy ghost on the inside it
[1:13:24] changed our soul
[1:13:26] made us a new man made us new a new
[1:13:29] woman
[1:13:29] made us a new person
[1:13:35] one of these days we're going to pick up
[1:13:38] that theophany
[1:13:40] we're going to step from here into that
[1:13:41] theophany
[1:13:45] and you know the theophany takes the
[1:13:46] place of your human spirit
[1:13:50] and all those memories you have the
[1:13:51] whole human spirit
[1:13:53] are going to be wiped away isn't that
[1:13:55] right and what the bible says
[1:13:58] hallelujah you know
[1:14:01] you'll be sitting there at the marriage
[1:14:02] supper of the lamb
[1:14:05] and you may look around and say i don't
[1:14:07] see so-and-so
[1:14:11] but but jesus is going to come by and
[1:14:13] wipe all that away
[1:14:16] so you can be happy
[1:14:20] not worried about wondering why didn't
[1:14:22] so and so make it
[1:14:25] not that we'd necessarily be wondering
[1:14:26] if somebody don't make it wouldn't know
[1:14:28] why they didn't make it
[1:14:31] they never got born again they never got
[1:14:33] the holy ghost
[1:14:35] you've got to have the wedding garment
[1:14:36] on isn't that right and what the holy
[1:14:38] ghost types
[1:14:39] hallelujah one of these days
[1:14:43] the dead in christ are going to rise see
[1:14:45] they're they're in their theophany now
[1:14:48] they're in a dimension of heaven in
[1:14:50] their theophany
[1:14:52] and they're not feeling any pain they
[1:14:55] don't need
[1:14:56] to eat they don't need to sleep they're
[1:14:58] just fellowshipping
[1:15:00] there's no day or night it's this day
[1:15:04] and they're just fellowshipping and
[1:15:05] having a good time and if they
[1:15:07] if you gave them an opportunity to come
[1:15:09] back they wouldn't want to come back
[1:15:10] [Music]
[1:15:12] the only time they want to come back is
[1:15:13] when it's a time for resurrection
[1:15:16] because see they're not perfect yet
[1:15:19] they without us are not made perfect yet
[1:15:23] they've got to come back and get their
[1:15:24] glorified body
[1:15:26] they got to come back into a body you
[1:15:28] know what what is the body made out of
[1:15:30] anyway
[1:15:32] it's made out of brother and said
[1:15:33] petroleum and potash and
[1:15:35] cosmic lights and atoms and and that
[1:15:38] and you know i've often thought on
[1:15:42] the the the curse that was put on the
[1:15:44] serpent
[1:15:45] and you know we believe he walked around
[1:15:47] like like a man he was the closest thing
[1:15:50] to man
[1:15:51] but he was a beast he had a place for a
[1:15:54] soul but he didn't have one
[1:15:57] but he was the closest thing to man but
[1:16:00] then he was cursed
[1:16:02] to crawl on his belly now
[1:16:06] what happened to it god just changed you
[1:16:09] know we're made up of molecules
[1:16:11] so god just changed the molecular
[1:16:13] structure
[1:16:14] of the serpent and he no longer walked
[1:16:18] up right
[1:16:19] he put enmity between his seat and the
[1:16:21] seat of the woman
[1:16:23] so no longer can that boundary be
[1:16:25] crossed
[1:16:26] there's a breach there now and so he
[1:16:30] crawls on his belly so what's gonna
[1:16:32] what's gonna happen to us
[1:16:36] that are alive and remain you see
[1:16:39] our molecule structure is a little out
[1:16:42] of whack
[1:16:44] that's why we grow old that's why we get
[1:16:46] sick
[1:16:47] that's why we experience diseases
[1:16:50] but he's going to change that molecular
[1:16:53] structure
[1:16:54] and it's going to become a glorified
[1:16:56] body
[1:16:58] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:02] praise the lord amen
[1:17:06] hallelujah let's stand
[1:17:11] praise the lord
[1:17:15] heavenly father we're thankful lord to
[1:17:16] be here tonight we're thankful for your
[1:17:18] word
[1:17:20] we ask dear god that you've come and
[1:17:22] blessed us with your word
[1:17:23] lord that we would take it to heart dear
[1:17:25] god
[1:17:26] lord you know everyone here
[1:17:29] you know who needs the holy ghost and
[1:17:32] who has the holy ghost and
[1:17:34] lord this message wasn't meant in any
[1:17:37] way lord god to
[1:17:38] look down on anyone but lord to lift
[1:17:41] them up
[1:17:42] to make them aware dear god that if they
[1:17:44] don't have it it's still promised to
[1:17:46] them
[1:17:47] they can have it all they got to do is
[1:17:49] just receive it
[1:17:51] lord it's a a promise it's a gift
[1:17:56] it's not anything we do to earn it
[1:17:58] you've told us to repent and be baptized
[1:18:01] and then this promise is to everyone
[1:18:05] many those that are far off as many as
[1:18:07] the lord our god shall call
[1:18:09] and if god's called him then lord that
[1:18:12] promise is to him
[1:18:14] lord no man can come except the father
[1:18:16] calls him
[1:18:18] and lord they wouldn't be here tonight
[1:18:20] unless you'd call them
[1:18:22] lord i pray to god those that need the
[1:18:24] holy ghost dear god
[1:18:26] that you lord god will come and by your
[1:18:29] word
[1:18:29] that lord god give them the holy ghost
[1:18:33] lord may they take this word in may dear
[1:18:36] god as they're set
[1:18:37] under the ministry of their pastor dear
[1:18:39] god that they be born again lord god
[1:18:42] by the word of god which is the way the
[1:18:45] way the gentile is
[1:18:47] born again dear god
[1:18:51] lord i ask god bless those dear god i
[1:18:54] hope that
[1:18:55] i pray that they were encouraged tonight
[1:18:57] those that
[1:18:58] already have made that journey and
[1:19:01] already have
[1:19:02] had that boxcar sealed but they'd be
[1:19:05] encouraged tonight because many times
[1:19:08] the devil comes and tries to convince us
[1:19:10] we don't have it
[1:19:12] but lord god like we said about the song
[1:19:16] we know we got it because we were there
[1:19:19] we went through the experience we
[1:19:23] know that we know hallelujah
[1:19:28] thank you lord jesus lord god
[1:19:31] it's we're not dependent on this flesh
[1:19:34] this flesh is not a reflection of the
[1:19:37] holy ghost
[1:19:38] but that inner man that takes control
[1:19:41] the control tower
[1:19:43] lord takes control of this outer man
[1:19:45] this flesh being
[1:19:47] brings it in subjection to the word it
[1:19:50] says no no no you're not going to do
[1:19:52] that
[1:19:54] lord why because the desire that's on
[1:19:56] the inside that desire
[1:19:58] for sin is gone lord the desire on the
[1:20:02] inside
[1:20:02] is to live for you lord we ask these
[1:20:06] things in jesus christ's name
[1:20:08] your blessings on the people in jesus
[1:20:11] name amen
