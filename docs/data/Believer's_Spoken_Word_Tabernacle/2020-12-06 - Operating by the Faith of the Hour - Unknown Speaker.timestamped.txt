[25:47] to strengthen our brother as well
[25:50] we want to just turn our attention to
[25:54] to the word of the lord here this
[25:55] morning and i
[25:57] have a little bit of a maybe a little
[25:59] bit longer
[26:00] passage of reading from for our text
[26:03] this morning
[26:05] but we want to look in james chapter 2
[26:09] this morning and just to look to the
[26:12] lord so perhaps as you are turning there
[26:14] and to look at that
[26:16] let's just go to the lord in prayer and
[26:19] you have a request upon your heart that
[26:21] you would like to make known to the lord
[26:23] but just to know that god is mindful
[26:26] to minister to our needs and to our
[26:29] hearts
[26:30] just what we have need of heavenly
[26:32] father
[26:34] lord as we just come before you lord
[26:36] this morning
[26:37] how thankful we are o god for your mercy
[26:40] and your strength lord in this hour we
[26:43] thank you father for your leadership
[26:45] oh god you are faithful lord
[26:49] you lord have not left us you don't
[26:52] leave us lord in a state of wandering or
[26:55] limbo but oh god you're faithful to
[26:58] direct the slow
[27:00] in the midst lord of each moment of our
[27:02] life lord
[27:03] and the thing that is so wonderful it's
[27:05] not just lord
[27:07] that we need you in times of trouble or
[27:10] chaos or lord of a test of a trial but
[27:14] lord we need you
[27:16] every single moment of our life lord
[27:19] you're our life lord jesus and we're
[27:22] depending on you
[27:24] lord we're not depending on our
[27:26] abilities
[27:28] lord all that we could have lord
[27:31] dear god even what would be considered
[27:34] good or good qualities
[27:36] without it being under your oversight oh
[27:39] god
[27:40] it's nothing lord so father we
[27:43] our trust is not in you as paul would
[27:46] write of even the stock lord that he
[27:49] come from lord with
[27:50] benjamin and coming dear god from that
[27:53] of israel
[27:53] and the teachers that he was under lord
[27:56] and dear god being a very
[27:57] great learning man but yet within all of
[28:00] that
[28:01] paul had met one who was greater than
[28:03] all of his learning
[28:05] and all of his ability he met the god
[28:08] of abraham and lord jesus
[28:12] we are so thankful lord that we have met
[28:15] you
[28:16] lord god like that of moses when he
[28:18] stood there lord
[28:20] he recognized his littleness he
[28:22] recognized his weakness
[28:24] and he recognized the greatness of his
[28:27] need of you
[28:28] the lord in order for the promise to be
[28:30] fulfilled
[28:32] it would take you lord coming o god
[28:35] in the form of your word by your spirit
[28:38] and fulfilling your word
[28:40] so lord we just want to yield of
[28:42] ourselves lord and ask that you'll come
[28:45] minister to the hearts behind every hand
[28:48] oh god i ask may the holy spirit lord
[28:50] just
[28:51] move in every living room and every
[28:53] place
[28:54] lord where as the children of god are
[28:56] gathered together lord
[28:58] may your holy spirit lord just take
[29:00] control
[29:01] speak through these lips of clay oh god
[29:04] here
[29:04] lord i pray through us lord we love you
[29:07] and we thank you lord and we just have a
[29:10] confidence lord your word
[29:12] he will not return to you boy but it
[29:15] will accomplish
[29:16] lord what you have intended lord to be
[29:19] achieved
[29:20] so we just give ourselves to you now
[29:22] lord and we ask it all for the glory of
[29:24] god
[29:25] in the name of jesus christ amen
[29:29] as we look here in james chapter 2
[29:34] i want to look at this we are looking in
[29:38] genesis 22 where we've been speaking
[29:40] from
[29:41] and i just want to deal with this part
[29:45] of it
[29:46] um within abraham's life and what we're
[29:49] seeing
[29:50] there are many parts and many um
[29:54] points that are there within genesis 22
[29:57] that speak
[29:58] of the culminating in abraham's journey
[30:02] which is the same place that we are
[30:06] as the seed of abraham we are the seed
[30:09] of abraham
[30:10] by the holy ghost that same
[30:13] faith moving within us we are in that
[30:16] same
[30:17] place that abraham was brought to
[30:21] and so we want to look at this here this
[30:23] morning in james chapter 2 verse 14.
[30:26] the bible says what does it profit my
[30:29] brethren
[30:30] though a man say he hath pay and have
[30:34] not works
[30:35] can faith save him
[30:38] if a brother or sister be naked and
[30:41] destitute of daily food
[30:44] and one of you say unto him depart in
[30:46] peace
[30:47] be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding
[30:51] you give them
[30:51] not those things which are needful to
[30:53] the body
[30:55] what doth it profit now hear how
[30:58] james is writing by inspiration
[31:02] faith itself has works with it
[31:05] now remember here's he just referred to
[31:08] a word that's spoken to address
[31:12] a need be be clothed be warmed
[31:15] but you see the word itself is
[31:18] meant to take upon flesh and the word
[31:21] itself
[31:22] is meant to move to meet the need
[31:26] of the hour even so verse 17
[31:30] even so faith if it hath not
[31:34] works is dead being alone
[31:39] yea a man may say thou hast faith
[31:42] and i have works show me thy
[31:46] faith without thy works and i will show
[31:49] thee my
[31:50] faith by my work
[31:53] thou believers that there is one god
[31:56] thou doest well the devils also believe
[32:00] and tremble but wilt thou know
[32:05] o vain man that faith
[32:08] without works is dead
[32:12] was not abraham our father justified
[32:16] by works when he had offered isaac
[32:19] his son upon the altar
[32:23] see us thou have faith wrought with his
[32:26] works
[32:27] and by works was faith made
[32:30] perfect brought to a completion
[32:34] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[32:36] said abraham
[32:38] believed god and it was imputed unto him
[32:42] for righteousness now notice
[32:43] a fulfillment of that scripture before
[32:46] the works could ever take place
[32:48] of the offering up before isaac could
[32:51] come
[32:52] and before isaac could even be offered
[32:55] up
[32:55] it all starts with faith
[32:59] works do not bring faith but it's faith
[33:02] that produces works so now
[33:05] faith is demonstrated according
[33:09] to the word so what is abraham what was
[33:12] abraham doing
[33:13] abraham was now acting out
[33:16] the word that had been revealed
[33:19] to him you see a life brother brandon
[33:22] would tell us in this way a life
[33:24] lived by the word is simply
[33:28] the word being expressed
[33:31] so he says this scripture was fulfilled
[33:35] so
[33:35] a fulfillment of scripture is not just
[33:37] belief
[33:38] but in now is action abraham believed
[33:42] god
[33:43] and it was imputed unto him for
[33:45] righteousness
[33:46] and he was called the friend of god
[33:51] you see then how that by works a man
[33:54] is justified and not by faith only
[33:57] likewise also was not rahab the harlot
[34:00] justified by works when she had received
[34:04] the messengers and had sent them out
[34:07] another way
[34:08] for as the body without the spirit
[34:12] is dead so faith without works
[34:17] is dead also
[34:20] so when we look at this
[34:24] of faith and i want to speak here this
[34:26] morning and we'll see
[34:27] how far we we come within this but i
[34:29] want to speak on this thought
[34:32] operating by the faith of the hour
[34:36] operating by the faith of the hour
[34:40] you recognize that real faith
[34:45] it that is sown into the
[34:49] ordained betting ground where that faith
[34:52] that word it has an intended
[34:56] target there's an in there is an
[34:58] intention when god
[35:00] would send a message there are
[35:03] hearts who are who are
[35:06] identified with that word and that word
[35:09] is sent
[35:10] to bring them to life and into
[35:13] expression
[35:14] to where that word is lived that is an
[35:17] ordained
[35:18] betting ground the the seed
[35:22] it's a it's a womb of god's own choosing
[35:26] and it will declare in action and word
[35:30] spoken expression according to the
[35:32] revealed will of god
[35:34] for the hour in other words this is a
[35:37] life
[35:37] that is completely in tune with the
[35:40] voice of god
[35:43] now when we look at this you see
[35:46] faith itself is a revelation and we'll
[35:48] be coming into some of these places
[35:50] it's a measure that god deals to every
[35:52] man
[35:53] severally as he will and that faith that
[35:57] god has sown in the heart
[35:58] that's that faith that god sows in the
[36:01] heart
[36:02] of the redeemed brother random makes
[36:04] this
[36:05] this this this statement here in
[36:08] spiritual food and due season
[36:11] and he says now we want you to get built
[36:13] up
[36:14] in the holy oracles of god
[36:18] in the faith the faith of this hour
[36:22] the faith it's going to take more faith
[36:26] than ever was in any age
[36:29] for this has to be rapturing faith
[36:33] be taken up and so we want you to
[36:36] believe tonight in all that you have
[36:38] seen
[36:39] heard the word that you've heard
[36:41] preached the signs and wonders you've
[36:43] seen done
[36:44] we want you to accumulate all that
[36:47] together in your heart
[36:49] and consider it whether that be
[36:53] of god or not
[36:57] that simplicity of the accumulation it's
[36:59] like in many of us we keep
[37:02] little tokens and things of remembrance
[37:05] of
[37:06] you know perhaps that leading into the
[37:08] wedding day and the wedding and then
[37:10] as the children come along you you keep
[37:12] things that
[37:13] are very uh special and peculiar we keep
[37:17] memories uh picture and video and so
[37:20] forth of certain
[37:21] family events or other holidays or
[37:23] birthdays or on and on
[37:25] and we keep those things those things
[37:27] are that we keep
[37:28] are what is so precious to us it's just
[37:30] like sometimes where
[37:32] it comes maybe to thin out things in the
[37:36] house
[37:36] and you would say this right here no i
[37:40] i we we can't let go of this right here
[37:42] because
[37:43] you would have a special a special part
[37:46] to you maybe it's not even something
[37:47] that is
[37:48] useful but it's something that has a
[37:50] special meaning maybe it's something
[37:52] that
[37:52] you know a loved one had that is went on
[37:54] home to be with the lord but
[37:56] nonetheless it's something that you
[37:58] would have value
[37:59] and there is an accumulation things that
[38:01] you accumulate
[38:03] or what is of a value to you things that
[38:06] are not
[38:06] valued to you is things that you don't
[38:09] accumulate you don't care if it goes
[38:11] this way
[38:12] you don't care what happens to it now
[38:14] when the bible says regarding samuel
[38:17] when his words were spoke
[38:18] the bible says that the lord did not
[38:21] allow his words to fall to the ground
[38:24] now how it was not as though god had his
[38:28] hand out
[38:28] and catching the word but there was
[38:31] people
[38:32] and ordained people of god david being
[38:36] one of them
[38:36] who was a place that the word could fall
[38:40] into
[38:41] and that word falling there was the
[38:44] fulfillment of the scripture
[38:46] that god seen that his words did not
[38:48] fall to the ground
[38:49] and that's the same way in this hour
[38:52] there is an accumulation
[38:54] in the heart of the believer of what
[38:57] we've seen
[38:58] what we've heard and the word and the
[39:00] experiences in our life
[39:02] what god has done in our life and the
[39:04] word it's
[39:05] accumulating and what is it those events
[39:08] are supernatural events every request
[39:12] that is answered the word that has been
[39:15] revealed to us
[39:16] it is a supernatural event
[39:20] and it is accumulating in our hearts
[39:25] sometimes we understand there's a lot of
[39:28] unnecessary things that can be
[39:31] accumulated
[39:33] a lot of things can take place and be
[39:35] accumulated like we've seen
[39:37] you know over the course of this uh
[39:40] whole a virus this this part that's been
[39:43] among
[39:44] you seen people months ago you start
[39:46] seeing people even now
[39:47] under fear they begin to accumulate
[39:50] things
[39:51] so we understand that there are things
[39:53] that can be accumulated
[39:55] doubt unbelief fear
[39:58] worry complexes offenses
[40:01] a lot of things that we can accumulate
[40:04] but if we can step back
[40:06] and to evaluate that there is only one
[40:09] thing that's
[40:10] very important and should be the most
[40:12] important thing
[40:13] we should steam it above our necessary
[40:15] food and that
[40:17] is the revealed word of god the faith
[40:20] of this hour because it is that faith
[40:24] that guides and directs us through every
[40:26] part in our life
[40:28] it's not just something that is a part
[40:30] of well it's a part of church or
[40:32] it's a part of me coming to church no he
[40:35] is
[40:35] our life this is the faith like we
[40:39] mentioned on thursday
[40:41] this is the faith that has polycarp
[40:44] went to the stake this is the same faith
[40:47] operating in our lives to daily strive
[40:51] against sin and unbelief and the powers
[40:54] of darkness and to cast
[40:56] down reasoning and and so forth for
[40:58] every need
[40:59] that presents itself
[41:03] so brother branham would he would take
[41:05] us into this
[41:06] place and it would be
[41:10] an admonishing to our lives that
[41:13] jesus christ as he says it's like elijah
[41:17] of old said if god be god then serve him
[41:19] and if jesus is the center of all things
[41:22] to the christian
[41:24] then i think we ought to let loose of
[41:27] everything else
[41:28] and cleave to him remember
[41:32] he is the center he is the north star
[41:35] he's the ultimate
[41:36] he's the absolute you so you see the
[41:38] things that we
[41:39] that perhaps have been accumulated or
[41:42] things that could be present
[41:44] yes how is there a turning loose of that
[41:46] it's
[41:47] to look to him that we want to ensure
[41:50] to cleave to him and examine
[41:53] everything else in our life to see where
[41:57] is he in all of this
[42:01] he's the saints to be the center the
[42:03] focus
[42:05] he's the north star and there's only one
[42:07] thing that'll point to the north star
[42:09] that's your compass you're selling with
[42:11] and the compass that i'm trying
[42:13] i'm trying for you to sell with is the
[42:16] word
[42:16] and the word always points to him
[42:21] so you see very clearly here in this
[42:23] statement
[42:24] this is not just the bible
[42:27] remember in israel they had
[42:30] the prophets the psalms and so forth but
[42:33] they did not have the word of the lord
[42:36] and even with having a have we'll say it
[42:38] like this having a bible
[42:40] without the word of the lord that saith
[42:43] the lord the
[42:44] voice of the holy spirit speaking you do
[42:47] not have the word of the lord
[42:48] because the word of the lord is the
[42:50] revealed will
[42:52] that's been sealed up in the written
[42:54] word
[42:56] so we feel like brother ramsay like this
[43:01] that we're going through a great time of
[43:04] distress
[43:04] and trials perplexity of the time
[43:08] distress between the nations all kinds
[43:10] of things happening sometimes
[43:12] i get engulfed everywhere i look
[43:16] it's like a ship out on the sea and i've
[43:19] been given
[43:20] charge of the boat
[43:24] amen hallelujah this
[43:27] this boat we're speaking of this is that
[43:29] finishing up
[43:30] of the body of jesus christ
[43:34] are you with me and how we gonna make it
[43:37] here comes one with a white cap hundred
[43:40] times bigger than my ship
[43:44] are you listening but we'll crest
[43:48] them every one
[43:50] [Applause]
[43:52] the ship's not turning around and going
[43:54] back to harbor we're going
[43:56] through we are more
[44:00] than victors through him
[44:03] the faith the chief captain has got a
[44:06] hold of the string
[44:08] on the end of the ship he'll pull it
[44:10] through
[44:11] we'll crest every one of them think of
[44:13] this statement here
[44:14] when it brings it down in simplicity it
[44:17] would
[44:18] it has the the perception we're looking
[44:21] at the the
[44:22] ground and and here the boat the body of
[44:24] jesus christ
[44:25] being baptized into jesus christ the
[44:28] word
[44:28] but to recognize there's a pull in that
[44:32] word
[44:32] it's a pull from the other side it's
[44:35] kind of like when you look at that
[44:36] little
[44:37] you know boat that you would have as a
[44:39] toy you would have a string you could
[44:41] pull it along
[44:42] you had power over that boat let me just
[44:44] say you in
[44:46] christ it is christ who has the power
[44:50] there is no wave there is nothing
[44:53] can hinder the ship from going to the
[44:56] other side
[44:56] we may have to stop and seek the mind of
[44:59] god
[45:00] in these times but we're not going back
[45:03] to harbor
[45:04] we're going forward by the faith of this
[45:07] hour
[45:11] so in luke
[45:16] 18 8 the lord jesus
[45:21] he says nevertheless when the son of man
[45:24] cometh in his return
[45:28] shall he find faith on the earth notice
[45:31] when the son of man
[45:33] you see it's it's a promise this is not
[45:36] just speaking of
[45:37] the corporal coming this is speaking
[45:39] because before
[45:40] of the corporal coming there's got to be
[45:43] a message
[45:44] that goes forth to make a people ready
[45:47] and he will take the revealing of the
[45:49] son of man
[45:50] the revealing of his coming
[45:54] so the question when the son of man
[45:56] cometh
[45:58] shall he find faith on the earth think
[46:01] of brother branham would put this he
[46:02] said notice
[46:03] he didn't say well they find churches a
[46:05] lot of churches
[46:06] didn't say well they find christians a
[46:08] lot of christians
[46:10] but the question is shall i find
[46:14] faith on the earth so if he's looking
[46:16] for faith we want to make sure
[46:18] that we understand the faith that he's
[46:20] looking for
[46:22] because faith can be you know many times
[46:25] faith
[46:26] is just thrown around uh and i hate to
[46:29] say it this way but sometimes it's used
[46:30] in such a generic term as though we'll
[46:33] just have faith or just have faith
[46:35] just have faith and it's so empty
[46:39] so empty because for a person to even
[46:43] say
[46:44] just have faith you should have a life
[46:46] that backs up
[46:47] and expresses faith
[46:51] and when that happens you recognize it's
[46:53] not just something
[46:54] loosely that we're throwing out there
[46:57] faith the faith of this hour
[47:02] jude 1 verse 3 beloved when i gave all
[47:06] diligence to write unto you
[47:08] of the common salvation it was needful
[47:11] for me to write unto you and exhort you
[47:15] that you should earnestly contend this
[47:18] is war
[47:19] this is war contend
[47:23] for the faith which was once delivered
[47:26] unto the saints
[47:27] this is satan's objective is to
[47:30] withstand
[47:31] this faith
[47:34] this is his objective because if he can
[47:37] keep the people
[47:38] from this faith they could come to
[47:40] church
[47:42] they could be you know christians
[47:44] because remember
[47:45] there's a big difference between a holy
[47:47] ghost field christian
[47:48] and just a christian there's a big
[47:51] difference
[47:52] and if satan can somehow keep people
[47:55] from
[47:55] this faith the faith notice
[47:58] this was not a faith that that they
[48:01] already had
[48:02] but it was the faith that was delivered
[48:05] by god himself to
[48:08] the church of the living god that same
[48:10] faith is the same
[48:12] faith that god delivered to abraham the
[48:14] same
[48:15] faith that god delivered to sarah
[48:18] because when god changed abraham's name
[48:22] to abraham he put
[48:25] his last name he put his name
[48:28] upon abraham his name his
[48:31] life his character it would be
[48:34] god by the power of his word
[48:38] he transformed abraham he changed
[48:41] abraham from laughing within to having a
[48:44] faith
[48:44] that staggered not at the promise of
[48:46] almighty god
[48:48] you see god removes all doubt from the
[48:50] inside
[48:53] this is the faith and to
[48:57] to operate as our
[49:01] title would indicate to operate is to be
[49:03] moved
[49:06] by the faith of this hour it cannot be a
[49:09] different faith it must be
[49:10] the original faith that was delivered to
[49:13] the church
[49:14] because there's no other faith many
[49:16] times we once again we hear this
[49:18] what faith are you of what faith are you
[49:21] of
[49:22] well i'm the methodist faith or i'm this
[49:24] faith i'm that no
[49:25] there's not multiple faiths there's one
[49:27] faith the bible says in ephesians
[49:30] 4 4 there's one body one spirit even as
[49:34] you are called
[49:35] in one hope of your calling
[49:38] one lord one faith one
[49:41] baptism one god and father of all who is
[49:44] above all
[49:45] through all and in you all
[49:50] i want you to look here in the
[49:52] scriptures
[49:54] in acts 3 16 here is peter
[49:59] this is after they've come out of the
[50:02] upper room
[50:04] and here he sees the man at the gate
[50:08] called
[50:08] beautiful the man is impotent he's
[50:11] laying there
[50:12] he's not able to walk he he's laying
[50:15] there begging
[50:16] and remember peter walks up to him
[50:19] and it's not this was not just peter
[50:22] taking it upon himself but as peter
[50:26] notice peter begins to see this
[50:29] but it's not just peter's eyes you know
[50:31] you and i could see a lot of needs
[50:33] a lot of needs that we would like to try
[50:35] to minister to
[50:36] or we will say like this would love to
[50:38] see god move upon that need
[50:40] and that's something that is a believer
[50:43] but this was not
[50:44] peter just simply taking the word
[50:47] and i'm going to take the word and i'm
[50:49] going to do away with this situation no
[50:51] he is in tune with god and as he looks
[50:54] upon the man
[50:56] there is a perceiving that's going on
[50:59] and when peter speaks to him and says
[51:02] silver and gold
[51:03] have a nun and and such as i have
[51:07] i give to you so what peter had
[51:10] there was able by god's sovereign grace
[51:13] to be released a virtue of faith
[51:17] in that moment that was needed for that
[51:21] man to stand up
[51:22] and walk from that place
[51:26] this is what peter says acts 3 16
[51:29] and his name this is when he's asking
[51:31] them
[51:32] or when he's asked how did this happen
[51:34] how did this take place
[51:35] his name through faith
[51:38] in his name hath made this man strong
[51:42] whom you see and know yea the faith
[51:46] which is by him
[51:49] hath given him this perfect soundness
[51:53] in the presence of you all you see
[51:57] brother brandon would pick this up and i
[51:58] want to refer to this he says
[52:00] you see he says it was jesus name
[52:04] and jesus faith brought about the
[52:07] miracle
[52:08] was not peter's faith it was the faith
[52:13] that comes by him peter did not claim it
[52:17] was his own
[52:18] human faith any more than he claimed it
[52:20] was his own name
[52:22] he said that jesus name used
[52:26] in the faith which is from jesus
[52:29] performed that great work
[52:33] and he says it was his faith speaking of
[52:36] the lord jesus
[52:37] it was his faith it was not faith
[52:40] in him but it was his
[52:44] own faith that he had given to the
[52:46] believers
[52:47] so who was it that healed that man it
[52:49] was the faith
[52:51] of the lord jesus operating
[52:54] through his body peter said this is not
[52:57] my faith that raised him up but it was
[53:00] the
[53:00] faith that is by him hath went forth
[53:04] you see what did it happen faith saw
[53:07] the need and faith responded to the need
[53:12] this is what james was writing about
[53:15] faith responds
[53:16] to the need
[53:20] you see in romans 12 3
[53:24] for i say through the grace given unto
[53:28] me to every man that is among you
[53:30] not to think of himself more highly than
[53:32] he ought to think but to think soberly
[53:34] according as god hath dealt to every man
[53:38] the measure of faith
[53:42] god has dealt to every man the measure
[53:45] of faith
[53:46] remember who he's talking to verse 1
[53:49] brethren
[53:50] brethren ephesians 2
[53:54] 8 for by grace are you saved through
[53:57] faith
[53:58] and that faith and that faith is not of
[54:01] yourselves
[54:02] it is the gift of god
[54:06] you see even for a person to begin to
[54:10] believe it it takes the faith of god
[54:14] operating on their heart to even
[54:17] repent it takes the faith of god
[54:21] operating on their heart for their mind
[54:24] to be
[54:24] turned to holiness that would that then
[54:28] god moves down into the very depth and
[54:31] the power of transformation
[54:33] to where now that same faith that has
[54:36] been calling
[54:37] and dealing that same faith now comes on
[54:40] the
[54:41] inside and lives itself
[54:44] out james 2 1 my brethren
[54:49] have not the faith of our lord jesus
[54:52] christ the lord of glory
[54:54] with respect of person notice brethren
[54:57] the faith of our lord jesus christ
[55:01] brother branham withdrawal the attention
[55:02] he says notice he didn't say have not
[55:04] the faith
[55:05] he didn't say he says have not the faith
[55:07] of not not in
[55:09] the faith of so this faith is dwelling
[55:13] in his body now
[55:16] as brother rana would would go through
[55:18] this here i want to read
[55:20] these parts very important
[55:23] in the permea in the pergamine age
[55:27] remember this is the age of the seed of
[55:30] satan
[55:33] this is a this is a time
[55:36] where it's leading up to the transition
[55:40] in the next stage into the red horse
[55:42] rider the first three ages are under
[55:44] that white horse rider he's trying to
[55:46] conquer notice
[55:48] how does he conquer through innocency
[55:53] flatteries he gets it to where everybody
[55:56] will just kind of
[55:57] relinquish their rights and just lay
[55:59] everything down and then when he gets it
[56:01] into that place
[56:02] then he unites together church and state
[56:06] and persecution comes on
[56:11] so in the pergamian age
[56:14] look how brother of them says this where
[56:16] men were humanizing salvation
[56:20] having turned from the truth that
[56:23] salvation
[56:24] is of the lord having cast aside
[56:28] the doctrine of election
[56:31] and opened wide the church door and
[56:34] their fellowship to any
[56:35] and all who subscribed to their tenants
[56:38] never mind the word in this age of rapid
[56:42] degradation there were still the few
[56:45] who had the measure of that faith of our
[56:48] lord jesus christ
[56:49] and not only used that faith
[56:52] in acts of power but withstood
[56:56] those who dared to say they were saved
[56:59] simply on the grounds of joining a
[57:02] church
[57:03] this is contending for that same faith
[57:09] that's the same faith that calls out and
[57:11] says it's not
[57:12] good enough just to know the message
[57:15] it's not good enough just to know that
[57:18] god has sent a prophet
[57:20] it's just not good enough
[57:23] you must be born again
[57:31] hell is filled with church members
[57:36] rich young ruler he spoke from there
[57:42] he was able to look across into paradise
[57:45] and see the rest in abraham's bosom
[57:48] abraham's bosom
[57:50] was the oncoming promise
[57:53] i will bring you into this land i will
[57:56] restore you i will bring you
[57:58] back home to where god's word would come
[58:01] in fulfillment
[58:04] and while they were waiting under the
[58:06] sacrificial
[58:07] blood of the natural lamb they were
[58:10] waiting there by revelation
[58:12] for that of the lamb to come
[58:16] whose blood whose life coming forth
[58:19] would release them from behold
[58:23] that were there in paradise look at this
[58:27] they knew that no man could truly
[58:30] believe
[58:31] unto eternal life and the righteousness
[58:33] of god apart
[58:35] from the measure of the faith of the
[58:36] lord jesus
[58:38] himself as today's church is filled
[58:42] with mental believers now
[58:45] i wanted to say this mental believers
[58:48] intellectual brother branham brings that
[58:50] together that's
[58:51] emotional not just people who are
[58:55] when we look at well they don't believe
[58:57] in any emotion no brother baptize this
[58:59] together
[58:59] in in the messages of faith of their
[59:03] you can have these such people who
[59:04] become worked up he's and he ties it
[59:07] together
[59:07] with that intellectual faith why it's
[59:09] human faith
[59:11] once they get out they get out from
[59:13] under
[59:14] where the presence of god where they're
[59:16] at then everything
[59:17] they doubt the very things that they
[59:19] claim to have received
[59:22] you see what god comes to do is bring a
[59:25] transformation
[59:26] if your faith is only good enough for
[59:29] thursday and sunday for some folks it's
[59:31] only good for sunday
[59:32] because they don't believe in thursdays
[59:34] anyhow but i'm just saying like this
[59:37] if your faith is only good for once in a
[59:40] while
[59:40] you better hang it up and get the real
[59:43] faith
[59:43] of the lord jesus christ you better say
[59:46] god
[59:47] let lord jesus let that faith come into
[59:50] me
[59:50] that faith that operates through my life
[59:57] oh glory as today's church is filled
[1:00:00] with mental believers look at this
[1:00:03] who endorse the virgin birth
[1:00:07] the shed blood going to church taking
[1:00:11] communion
[1:00:12] and are not reborn at all
[1:00:15] even so in this third age there was the
[1:00:18] same problem
[1:00:20] human faith wasn't enough then
[1:00:23] and it's not enough now
[1:00:27] it takes the very faith of the son of
[1:00:30] god
[1:00:30] to drop look at this statement it takes
[1:00:33] the very faith
[1:00:34] of the son of god to drop into a man's
[1:00:38] heart so that he can receive
[1:00:41] the lord of glory into the temple
[1:00:44] not made with hands what is that temple
[1:00:47] not made with hands that's that seed
[1:00:51] that lay in you that's that soul the
[1:00:54] brother
[1:00:54] said that's the real gift that come from
[1:00:58] god
[1:00:59] and the holy spirit the second adam the
[1:01:01] quickening spirit
[1:01:03] he comes to quicken that seed and that
[1:01:06] soul
[1:01:06] sets in you right there it's a new
[1:01:08] nature
[1:01:10] that sets in that's the temple
[1:01:14] remember his presence
[1:01:17] it covered it it was emanated out
[1:01:21] from the holiest of holies this is why
[1:01:24] when the new birth has come it emanates
[1:01:27] it's not
[1:01:28] under natural lights but it is the light
[1:01:31] the shekinah
[1:01:32] glory of god with word on the inside
[1:01:35] the manna is always kept fresh
[1:01:40] manna could fall in the camp but they
[1:01:44] had to go out every day and get new
[1:01:45] manner
[1:01:46] in one way that's a type that your
[1:01:48] experience with god
[1:01:49] must be fed there must be a renewal
[1:01:52] there must be refreshing but
[1:01:54] also at the same time it also spoke
[1:01:57] to show you and i that if the manna only
[1:02:00] comes
[1:02:00] to the flesh to the mind to the spirit
[1:02:04] and never comes down to the soul then
[1:02:07] that life can only last so long
[1:02:09] before wiggle tails will set in it
[1:02:11] because
[1:02:12] the intended place of his habitation
[1:02:16] that temple that is not made with hands
[1:02:19] you in that soul that you were you came
[1:02:21] here with that soul came
[1:02:23] according to that nature that was in you
[1:02:25] that earthly
[1:02:26] worldly sinful nature but there was a
[1:02:30] seed
[1:02:30] on the inside and god was dealing with
[1:02:34] and drawing that real you to come
[1:02:36] forward
[1:02:38] that's the place of his habitation
[1:02:44] simply put brother branham would say it
[1:02:46] and souls in prison now
[1:02:48] when he gets that old nature to agree
[1:02:51] with him
[1:02:52] he kills it and then he comes in fully
[1:02:56] because you see god ain't going to live
[1:02:58] with somebody else in the house
[1:03:01] he won't marry an adulteress
[1:03:05] hallelujah let me read that statement
[1:03:07] again
[1:03:08] human faith wasn't enough then it's not
[1:03:10] enough now
[1:03:12] it takes the very faith of the son of
[1:03:14] god to
[1:03:15] drop into a man's heart so that he can
[1:03:17] receive
[1:03:18] the lord of glory into the temple not
[1:03:21] made
[1:03:21] with hands
[1:03:29] paul said in galatians 2 20
[1:03:32] i am crucified with christ
[1:03:36] nevertheless i live
[1:03:40] so there's a part that was crucified
[1:03:46] nevertheless i live yet not i
[1:03:50] but christ liveth
[1:03:53] in me and the life which i now live
[1:03:57] in the flesh i live
[1:04:01] by the faith of the son of god
[1:04:05] who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:04:09] this brethren says this was a living
[1:04:12] faith it's not dead
[1:04:16] it's not vain it's a living faith
[1:04:19] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:04:22] paul did not say
[1:04:23] that he lived by faith in the son of god
[1:04:27] it was the faith of the son of god
[1:04:31] that had given him life and kept him
[1:04:34] living in christian victory how
[1:04:37] was abraham's body changed
[1:04:42] by the faith of elohim the
[1:04:45] strong one el shaddai coming
[1:04:48] into abraham what is it when we read
[1:04:52] romans 4
[1:04:53] being not weak in faith it's because the
[1:04:55] faith
[1:04:56] of elohim came in him
[1:05:03] hallelujah how would he reproduce the
[1:05:06] faith of elohim
[1:05:08] by a surrendered life
[1:05:12] where god came in and would express how
[1:05:14] did sarah the bible says
[1:05:16] through faith she received strength
[1:05:21] to conceive how was that
[1:05:24] it was by the faith of elohim
[1:05:28] what was he doing he was producing his
[1:05:31] word
[1:05:32] that word that was spoken that thought
[1:05:35] that began to unfold of redemption now
[1:05:38] the faith for that word
[1:05:40] to be fulfilled or proven through their
[1:05:43] lives
[1:05:43] as believers the faith came glory
[1:05:46] that was necessary to meet the
[1:05:49] conditions
[1:05:50] of the hour so it is god god
[1:05:54] fulfilling his word it's his faith
[1:05:58] operating in us
[1:06:02] notice the faith of the son of god
[1:06:05] that had given him life and kept him
[1:06:08] living in christian victory
[1:06:12] this is why john went right by
[1:06:14] inspiration
[1:06:16] whatsoever is born of god
[1:06:19] overcometh the world and this
[1:06:23] is the victory that overcometh the world
[1:06:26] even our faith
[1:06:29] there's an only you when this faith has
[1:06:31] come
[1:06:33] you can't lose victory because that is
[1:06:35] the victory
[1:06:36] even it says our faith but once he gives
[1:06:39] us
[1:06:39] his faith it now is our faith we lay all
[1:06:42] become one with that
[1:06:44] it's him no longer twain but one it is
[1:06:47] the faith of god
[1:06:49] pulsating through our lives just as when
[1:06:51] he said i will give
[1:06:53] her a seed brother said when he gave
[1:06:56] mary that seed it now was her
[1:06:59] seed god
[1:07:02] has delivered given out the measure he
[1:07:05] has imparted
[1:07:06] by grace his faith it is our faith
[1:07:11] it's victory
[1:07:15] that same faith
[1:07:18] it's a living reality a living person
[1:07:24] pulsating through our lives
[1:07:28] it's like that little that little
[1:07:31] fountain that was privileged to go see
[1:07:34] that little stream
[1:07:35] that brother branham spoke on and oh my
[1:07:39] there it is yet still
[1:07:40] so cool and refreshing we we took you
[1:07:44] know
[1:07:44] bottles of water and and drank out of
[1:07:46] that stream that was there
[1:07:48] clear cold it was bubbling up
[1:07:52] remember that's the one the brother says
[1:07:54] why do you do
[1:07:56] that and he asked many questions
[1:08:00] and brother branham dramatizing that to
[1:08:02] us bringing it
[1:08:03] to a real life as a believer
[1:08:07] a real life of a believer see god never
[1:08:10] intended
[1:08:11] you to wait on local revivals to happen
[1:08:15] god intended that your life would be a
[1:08:18] revival
[1:08:20] hallelujah this is the grace of god that
[1:08:23] is given to
[1:08:24] us what makes you do that
[1:08:28] it is a force that's behind me
[1:08:32] what force is that faith what causes
[1:08:35] faith to stand out
[1:08:36] it's love brother baby love pushes
[1:08:39] faith out onto the battlefront
[1:08:44] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:08:48] world
[1:08:51] even if in your boat remember
[1:08:55] wood can be going down a stream it can
[1:08:57] float and
[1:08:58] get caught up here get caught up here
[1:09:00] but if that wood
[1:09:02] ever gets brought into that of a master
[1:09:06] builder one who builds the boat
[1:09:10] then that wood itself it now comes in
[1:09:13] to position it becomes a part
[1:09:16] of something then and then there becomes
[1:09:19] a power
[1:09:20] behind that boat there can be wood that
[1:09:22] is hung up all up and down the river
[1:09:24] but here is a boat made out of the same
[1:09:27] kind of wood
[1:09:28] and it's going down the river it
[1:09:30] sometimes it can run
[1:09:31] into places of snag traps and so forth
[1:09:35] but what's the difference it has a power
[1:09:38] behind it that once things arise there
[1:09:41] is a
[1:09:42] power behind it that it can able to get
[1:09:45] itself out of that
[1:09:46] what is that that is the faith of the
[1:09:49] lord jesus christ
[1:09:51] this is the victory that overcomes the
[1:09:53] world
[1:09:56] you see many things can arise things can
[1:09:58] come up
[1:09:59] sin can vary very slightly
[1:10:03] let me just say very clearly sometimes
[1:10:05] the way satan will come in i just this
[1:10:07] this is comes to me and i'm going to
[1:10:08] speak this right now sometimes satan can
[1:10:10] come in very slug
[1:10:11] slyly with medicines and drugs listen
[1:10:16] we believe in medicine but satan can
[1:10:19] come in so slightly to where
[1:10:20] then a person can become hooked on drugs
[1:10:25] they live their day based on drugs
[1:10:28] oh i hope somebody preaching with me you
[1:10:31] see how can come in so slightly
[1:10:33] in a way listen to me now it's not
[1:10:36] saying well i'm just going to throw them
[1:10:37] away
[1:10:38] that's not what we're saying we're
[1:10:39] saying to recognize that even
[1:10:41] when it can come to something like that
[1:10:43] and you recognize
[1:10:44] lord there's a trap that set in upon my
[1:10:48] life let me tell you something brother
[1:10:50] it's the same faith that dropped down
[1:10:52] that transformed your life
[1:10:54] it's that same faith that's there power
[1:10:57] that'll get you out of that mess
[1:11:00] don't stay tangled up in the weeds
[1:11:04] and the cares of life you can't beat
[1:11:07] yourself up over it either
[1:11:09] that won't do you no good because you've
[1:11:12] got to look at the power
[1:11:15] of the faith of jesus christ that's the
[1:11:18] victory
[1:11:22] glory i feel like running all over this
[1:11:24] building
[1:11:27] notice how the scripture
[1:11:31] would address this it talks of stephen
[1:11:36] a man full of faith and of the holy
[1:11:39] ghost
[1:11:42] full of faith and power that power
[1:11:46] that's due to myself the holy ghost
[1:11:49] full talks of silence
[1:11:53] being a man in acts 11 24 full of the
[1:11:56] holy ghost
[1:11:57] and a faith notice full
[1:12:02] you can't be full of faith and not fill
[1:12:05] with the holy ghost
[1:12:06] i'm talking about the faith of the lord
[1:12:08] jesus i'm talking about the measure of
[1:12:10] faith that he's given that did he
[1:12:12] notice it comes together because the
[1:12:15] faith
[1:12:15] that is of him is his life coming
[1:12:19] in to his body
[1:12:23] full of faith fool where that life that
[1:12:26] seed has received
[1:12:30] that water of life been quickened
[1:12:34] been raised up in an expression
[1:12:38] of elohim an expression of god
[1:12:43] faith itself this word
[1:12:46] that the writers would choose by
[1:12:47] inspiration to write here
[1:12:51] it's that conviction
[1:12:54] that's a that's a big word in itself the
[1:12:57] reason many times you see
[1:12:59] people just taking things so lightly and
[1:13:01] well this doesn't matter and that they'd
[1:13:03] have no conviction
[1:13:04] conviction has left the earth
[1:13:09] people have no conviction they can set
[1:13:12] and hear the word
[1:13:14] and they're as guilty as a fox in the
[1:13:16] hen house no conviction
[1:13:19] no reflection so they're not seeing the
[1:13:23] mirror
[1:13:23] of the word let me just tell you
[1:13:25] something for each and every one of us
[1:13:27] the word of god is to be a looking glass
[1:13:31] and that bible it's the bible speaks of
[1:13:34] it a looking glass
[1:13:35] that that has a man would look the bible
[1:13:38] says
[1:13:39] looketh in and you know how man what the
[1:13:41] scripture means there when it says look
[1:13:43] in
[1:13:44] it's one who lowers himself in order
[1:13:47] to see what is there it takes humility
[1:13:51] to the word for us to really see who we
[1:13:54] are
[1:13:54] to see the areas in the life that need
[1:13:58] to be changed
[1:14:04] conviction conviction
[1:14:08] conviction of the truth
[1:14:12] a conviction or a belief it's that holy
[1:14:16] fervor i love this that holy fervor
[1:14:20] born of faith and joined with it they
[1:14:23] were full
[1:14:24] of faith and of the holy ghost
[1:14:29] a person could have
[1:14:33] they could have the spirit of god
[1:14:34] brother iran would bring that out every
[1:14:36] moment of their life he's talking about
[1:14:38] that flesh that is there
[1:14:42] and not having a seed there on the
[1:14:44] inside
[1:14:46] a soul that come from god that see that
[1:14:49] that
[1:14:49] holy spirit can dwell around that life
[1:14:52] but it's got to come to the inside
[1:14:54] of the inside that transforms that
[1:14:57] life
[1:15:00] you see we're living in the hour where
[1:15:02] the plumb line
[1:15:03] is set forth so with this part this
[1:15:07] is why as god would
[1:15:10] set forth here let me just move a little
[1:15:13] bit
[1:15:16] this is why the ministry
[1:15:19] the ministry is set forth the fightful
[1:15:23] ministry
[1:15:23] is set for this is why
[1:15:26] that god in each of the seven gentile
[1:15:30] ages
[1:15:30] god would send a messenger
[1:15:35] it was at the end time in accordance
[1:15:38] with his word
[1:15:40] it's a junction of time it's a time
[1:15:44] where
[1:15:45] it's the it is the climax of all things
[1:15:48] what the church
[1:15:49] has to look forward to is the coming of
[1:15:52] the lord
[1:15:54] now as god had faithful men
[1:15:58] paul remember he was a prophet
[1:16:01] there that here ministered there
[1:16:04] prior to the beginning of that ephesian
[1:16:07] age
[1:16:07] and he stood there and we find that
[1:16:11] here that god what god had sent forth
[1:16:14] was that word this is what jude was
[1:16:17] writing about
[1:16:18] the things that you and i are privileged
[1:16:21] to understand and desire it's because
[1:16:24] god coming
[1:16:26] to fulfill his word a promise
[1:16:29] these are truths that were scattered
[1:16:32] laying in the scripture
[1:16:34] but they were scattered there are things
[1:16:36] that have laid here
[1:16:38] that were hidden that were laying in
[1:16:40] their nuggets
[1:16:42] for this hour for this season and god
[1:16:45] knows
[1:16:45] that you and i would have need of it
[1:16:48] they were tucked in there
[1:16:49] like hidden gems but now is the hour
[1:16:52] that we have need of that
[1:16:55] and it has meaning to our lives
[1:17:00] it has meaning to us it's not just a
[1:17:02] nice pretty
[1:17:03] lovely song ezekiel was a
[1:17:07] lovely song to israel this is not
[1:17:10] just a lovely song this is the
[1:17:13] inspiration
[1:17:14] on the holy ghost that has come down
[1:17:18] in this hour in the fullness of his word
[1:17:21] the fulfillment in the son of man now
[1:17:24] working and operating and energizing and
[1:17:28] inspiring the bride of jesus christ
[1:17:31] in the music sheet of the word of the
[1:17:34] lord
[1:17:35] so that the word is to be acted out
[1:17:38] in our lives this is why
[1:17:42] god would send the ministry
[1:17:46] the bible said till we all come
[1:17:49] in the unity of the faith
[1:17:56] i know sometimes we think that's got to
[1:17:57] be everybody's seeing eye to eye no no
[1:17:59] no no
[1:18:01] even me and you sat down long enough
[1:18:02] we'll disagree on something
[1:18:04] but the faith is that life
[1:18:07] that person being identified in him
[1:18:12] the challenge comes is can we allow
[1:18:14] allowed differences
[1:18:17] and then as the scripture goes on to say
[1:18:19] that we come in maturity to recognize we
[1:18:21] have differences
[1:18:23] but we have one focus and of the
[1:18:26] knowledge of the son of god
[1:18:27] unto a perfect man who's been bringing
[1:18:30] up this perfect man who's been the one
[1:18:32] raising up his body who was the one
[1:18:34] that's been raising the body that went
[1:18:37] in the ground
[1:18:37] in the dark ages there in that thy
[1:18:39] tyrant age who is it
[1:18:41] that began to raise it up there as a
[1:18:43] little shoot in the days of luther who
[1:18:45] was it that began to raise it up in a
[1:18:47] tassel in the days of wesley who
[1:18:49] is it that began to raise it up in the
[1:18:51] shock in the days there of the
[1:18:53] restoration
[1:18:54] of the gifts at azusa's tree who is it
[1:18:56] that now
[1:18:57] has come on the scene in the fullness of
[1:18:59] his word
[1:19:01] and revealing himself and bringing the
[1:19:04] bride body
[1:19:05] back the bright tree
[1:19:09] standing on her feet who is that bright
[1:19:11] tree
[1:19:12] it is the tree of life revealed in
[1:19:14] bright form
[1:19:16] who is it that has restored all these
[1:19:19] things
[1:19:20] who is it it's him
[1:19:23] bringing it back into the fullness of
[1:19:26] the measure
[1:19:27] this is the hour the marriage of the
[1:19:30] lamb
[1:19:30] has come remember
[1:19:33] to her was granted fine linen
[1:19:36] that she might be clothed in she did not
[1:19:40] did not provide her wedding garment
[1:19:43] she received the wedding garment of him
[1:19:46] who is her mate and that righteousness
[1:19:50] of the saints
[1:19:51] is not is not the works of man but that
[1:19:55] righteousness of the saints
[1:19:56] is the same holy ghost the same faith
[1:20:00] that comes from him it is that same
[1:20:02] working
[1:20:04] in the light the righteousness of the
[1:20:07] saints
[1:20:08] that fine linen
[1:20:11] the bride is a tired with the same
[1:20:14] garment of the sealing angel
[1:20:17] fine linen we're tired with that same
[1:20:20] one
[1:20:21] that elijah when he threw back the
[1:20:24] garment
[1:20:25] to elisha and to a perfect man unto the
[1:20:29] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:20:30] of christ
[1:20:30] notice the working of the ministry
[1:20:32] bringing it up
[1:20:34] into the fullness you see this is the
[1:20:37] working
[1:20:38] of the faith of god in our lives
[1:20:44] to be able to be able
[1:20:47] to take that word to receive it
[1:20:51] not try to figure it out
[1:20:54] but to be able to stand there as a seat
[1:20:57] of abraham
[1:20:58] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:21:02] that's able to have the word to let the
[1:21:06] word
[1:21:07] grow mature us
[1:21:12] ripeness
[1:21:14] you see this is the fulfillment
[1:21:19] of the of the of the prophecy of the
[1:21:22] word
[1:21:24] where jesus when he spoke remember they
[1:21:26] asked him
[1:21:28] in matthew 17 this all ties together
[1:21:31] some new ones that are here among us
[1:21:34] this all ties together
[1:21:36] in malachi 4. you see the bible is not a
[1:21:39] loosely connected book
[1:21:41] it's a book of prophecy it ties together
[1:21:44] when jesus
[1:21:45] walked and the fulfillment there in luke
[1:21:48] 24
[1:21:49] he took the scriptures that was
[1:21:53] pertaining to him that lay
[1:21:56] in all of these parts through
[1:21:59] the scripture and he brought them
[1:22:02] together
[1:22:04] that it might identify him
[1:22:07] who is the word he in the fulfillment
[1:22:10] of his word that's the same thing when
[1:22:15] we see this here
[1:22:16] in matthew 17. when they ask the
[1:22:19] question
[1:22:20] verse 10 why didn't say the scribes that
[1:22:22] elias elijah
[1:22:24] must first come and jesus answered and
[1:22:27] sent on them
[1:22:28] elijah truly shall first come known as
[1:22:32] future event and restore
[1:22:36] all things a ministry of restoration
[1:22:40] like elijah gathering
[1:22:43] those stones on the mountain let me
[1:22:47] finish this
[1:22:48] let me finish but i say unto you that
[1:22:51] elijah now notice
[1:22:52] he directs them to the fulfillment of
[1:22:56] that prophecy that was taking place
[1:23:00] even then elijah has come already which
[1:23:03] is speaking of
[1:23:05] john the baptist and they knew him not
[1:23:07] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[1:23:09] listed
[1:23:10] likewise shall also the son of man
[1:23:12] suffer there so it shows
[1:23:14] here is a fulfillment of scripture
[1:23:16] john's ministry
[1:23:18] it was a junction time ministry
[1:23:21] it was prophesied that that
[1:23:24] ministry would turn the hearts of the
[1:23:26] fathers to the children
[1:23:28] as it goes on to say in luke and he'll
[1:23:30] go before him in the power of elijah
[1:23:32] elijah and he'll turn the hearts of the
[1:23:34] fathers to the children this was the
[1:23:36] this was the promised word of god so
[1:23:38] that it would turn the hearts
[1:23:40] of the children or the fathers to the
[1:23:42] children's message who were the children
[1:23:45] the children were the elect
[1:23:48] seed of abraham not the natural seed of
[1:23:51] abraham
[1:23:52] but the election of abraham the elect
[1:23:55] that would receive the word
[1:23:57] that's why paul can say in romans that
[1:24:00] as the word went forth
[1:24:02] and and and it did not it seemed ago it
[1:24:04] took no effect
[1:24:05] but yet the word had an effect upon
[1:24:08] those
[1:24:09] who it was sent for see god's not
[1:24:12] interested in big crowds
[1:24:14] god comes the word comes for redemption
[1:24:18] to bring back what belongs to him
[1:24:22] so this here in verse 11 we referred to
[1:24:24] the elijah
[1:24:25] elijah truly shall first come so that he
[1:24:28] he's announcing there is coming a
[1:24:31] restoration
[1:24:32] there has to be restoring or restoring a
[1:24:34] lie
[1:24:35] to the fullness of the word i only
[1:24:38] understand what i'm saying
[1:24:39] not just doctrine but it must be true
[1:24:42] doctrine
[1:24:44] but it cannot be just doctrine at home
[1:24:47] it takes it's the fullness of himself
[1:24:51] this is why the scripture speaks of the
[1:24:54] revealing
[1:24:55] of the son of man it's the fullness of
[1:24:58] christ himself manifested
[1:25:01] through the ministry of malachi 4. this
[1:25:04] is why brother damn says
[1:25:05] it's the word in the man that's how it
[1:25:09] was
[1:25:09] with the prophets of old the bible says
[1:25:12] in hebrews 1 1
[1:25:13] that god who in sundried times spake
[1:25:16] unto our fathers
[1:25:17] in the prophets you see it's not just a
[1:25:20] word
[1:25:21] but it is god himself who is the word he
[1:25:24] is the character the
[1:25:26] nature the name is what is revealed
[1:25:29] to his children my sheep know my voice
[1:25:34] it's a word a message
[1:25:37] that god sends forth to restore
[1:25:42] the original bible faith what you think
[1:25:44] of this
[1:25:46] think of this because many walk around
[1:25:48] and say
[1:25:49] i believe the bible but do they really
[1:25:52] have the original bible faith
[1:25:53] remember what i talked about humanizing
[1:25:56] salvation
[1:25:57] humanize it and when it's humanized
[1:26:01] that here it is it's faith without
[1:26:04] germ it has no germ life in it
[1:26:09] to produce the life of the word
[1:26:13] you see in order for the word to be
[1:26:15] produced as we said with abraham and
[1:26:17] sarah
[1:26:17] it took god's own faith
[1:26:20] they had they became up one with it
[1:26:23] to where as we read in the scriptures a
[1:26:25] moment ago even our faith
[1:26:28] how are you living i'm living by the
[1:26:30] faith of the son of god
[1:26:32] not drifting
[1:26:36] not just loafing around i'm living
[1:26:41] by the faith of the son of god let me
[1:26:43] tell you what did the faith of the son
[1:26:45] of god do
[1:26:46] it led him to say i must be about my
[1:26:47] father's business
[1:26:53] original bible faith let me just try to
[1:26:55] narrow down on this
[1:26:58] very important i feel just to labor on
[1:27:00] this a moment
[1:27:03] many could claim well i believe
[1:27:07] the bible and yet denying
[1:27:11] the holy ghost the bible said they would
[1:27:15] in this last
[1:27:16] days they would have a form of godliness
[1:27:22] but deny the power thereof
[1:27:25] and that power that they deny is the
[1:27:27] power
[1:27:28] of the vindicated word
[1:27:32] listen to me it don't matter how much
[1:27:34] demonstration a person has
[1:27:36] if they deny the power
[1:27:39] of the vindicated word they are an enemy
[1:27:43] to god ham straightly told us in satan's
[1:27:47] eden
[1:27:48] he said if it's for the word that's your
[1:27:50] brother
[1:27:51] if it's against the word that's your
[1:27:54] enemy
[1:27:59] this is the faith that was once
[1:28:00] delivered to the saints
[1:28:03] original bible faith you see we're not
[1:28:06] just talking about a faith
[1:28:08] that says well you know i believe that
[1:28:11] god raised jesus from the dead that's
[1:28:12] good that's a start
[1:28:16] well you know i also believe you know
[1:28:18] that you need to be really sanctified by
[1:28:20] the blood
[1:28:21] there's a life that can come to begin to
[1:28:25] purge out that sets the mind in order
[1:28:28] for holiness
[1:28:29] to where things begin to oh wow yeah i
[1:28:32] shouldn't do this and oh my
[1:28:33] yeah i shouldn't do that and i shouldn't
[1:28:35] do that it begins to come
[1:28:37] set the mind in order
[1:28:40] that's good but there's more to it
[1:28:45] it must come to a place
[1:28:48] even a person can say well i don't know
[1:28:50] about the gifts
[1:28:52] i'm gonna preach a little bit even
[1:28:55] around
[1:28:56] our message where people don't believe
[1:29:00] in preachers
[1:29:02] they don't believe in gifts they don't
[1:29:05] believe in the supernatural
[1:29:07] everything's so bolded down and tied
[1:29:09] down
[1:29:10] i'm telling you that ain't original
[1:29:12] bible faith
[1:29:14] original bible faith is lives
[1:29:17] that believe all the word of god brother
[1:29:19] brown simply put it
[1:29:21] in the easter seal he said if you
[1:29:24] don't believe one word of god
[1:29:27] everything but one word you're an
[1:29:28] unbeliever
[1:29:31] that's unbelief it's to believe all of
[1:29:34] the word
[1:29:37] this is why this this is what the
[1:29:39] purpose
[1:29:40] of the message that god sent to us where
[1:29:43] the church had drifted
[1:29:45] it came to unite us with the original
[1:29:49] faith the same faith we read about
[1:29:53] in acts 3 16 the same faith
[1:29:56] in romans 12 3 the same faith
[1:29:59] in ephesians 2 8 the same faith
[1:30:03] in james it's the same faith what faith
[1:30:06] is it
[1:30:06] it's the faith of our lord jesus christ
[1:30:10] it's his person in its fullness
[1:30:14] working through his bride
[1:30:18] body
[1:30:20] this is what the seals were all about
[1:30:24] reveal where satan had come against that
[1:30:27] faith
[1:30:29] tried to trample it out
[1:30:32] but god reserved unto himself
[1:30:36] in the opening of that seventh seal
[1:30:40] it would be a coming of the holy ghost
[1:30:43] the coming of the word brother graham
[1:30:46] called it the bride coming
[1:30:47] it would be a coming of the son of man
[1:30:50] to manifest himself
[1:30:52] in a bright body
[1:30:56] why it's time for marriage it's marriage
[1:31:00] the union that which was taken from his
[1:31:03] side
[1:31:05] that which went in the ground has come
[1:31:07] back
[1:31:09] in the full maturity the full power
[1:31:12] his life
[1:31:16] see to original bible faith with things
[1:31:20] it's not just parts of the word
[1:31:23] let me just say it god never asked me to
[1:31:26] make it live
[1:31:29] god never asked you to make it live the
[1:31:31] violin is laying right there
[1:31:35] the word laying right there the word
[1:31:38] here the music sheet the word laying in
[1:31:41] our life
[1:31:42] who did it take it took the master
[1:31:45] himself taken the rosin
[1:31:50] and moving upon the bow strings took the
[1:31:52] holy spirit
[1:31:54] and it began to move upon those strings
[1:31:56] of predestination
[1:31:58] and he began to take our life into his
[1:32:00] hand
[1:32:01] and there's certain notes that were
[1:32:05] necessary to be played and his
[1:32:08] his hands placed there and as he would
[1:32:11] begin
[1:32:12] to take that violin he would bring
[1:32:15] out of that violin the music
[1:32:18] that was trapped in it only his hands
[1:32:21] upon that violin could cause the
[1:32:23] arrangements
[1:32:24] of the notes to come forth like they
[1:32:27] ought to come forth
[1:32:28] only his faith in our life
[1:32:33] causes the notes to come forth
[1:32:36] as they ought to original bible
[1:32:40] faith to believe
[1:32:43] all that he was
[1:32:46] he poured into christ all that christ
[1:32:51] was he had poured into his church
[1:32:56] see brother brown would make it simple
[1:32:57] he would sim make it simple
[1:32:59] because every one of us the scriptures
[1:33:03] we read here
[1:33:03] in ephesians 4 there's diversity
[1:33:06] among the body even the gifts even
[1:33:10] ministerial gifts from
[1:33:11] even pastors every not every pastor is
[1:33:13] alike
[1:33:15] god doesn't want us to be alike well i
[1:33:17] think we should do something like
[1:33:18] brother so-and-so i don't want to be
[1:33:19] like so-and-so
[1:33:20] and i don't want so-and-so to be like me
[1:33:22] god made me who i am for a purpose and a
[1:33:24] reason
[1:33:25] brother brahm said it put it simply it's
[1:33:27] for a certain people
[1:33:31] see we're all different this is why
[1:33:34] brother brown would make a statement and
[1:33:35] say it like this
[1:33:37] he said some he said they got faith like
[1:33:41] enoch
[1:33:42] he said if i don't have that faith or he
[1:33:45] said faith like that
[1:33:46] i'm not going to stand in the way of
[1:33:49] somebody else who does
[1:33:52] you understand what i'm saying sometimes
[1:33:55] you get i'm i'm afraid that sometimes
[1:33:58] it's got to a place
[1:33:59] to where everything's got everything is
[1:34:01] like well it's got to be such
[1:34:03] so deep and it's got to be the mysteries
[1:34:05] were not meant to be
[1:34:06] or your head's swirling in a service
[1:34:08] like whoa
[1:34:10] what's that all about i don't know but
[1:34:12] it was deep
[1:34:13] no no no no no no it's to be a
[1:34:17] faith that comes down into your life
[1:34:21] it takes god the same one who walked on
[1:34:23] the road to emmaus
[1:34:25] it was him him he gave life to that word
[1:34:28] he broke the bread as he was breaking
[1:34:30] the word then their eyes become open
[1:34:33] this is him this is him as he breaks the
[1:34:36] word
[1:34:36] as we're gathered here you're gathered
[1:34:38] in your homes and he's stepping out
[1:34:40] right here of the pages he steps out of
[1:34:42] the shadows he steps out of quotes
[1:34:44] you've been meditating on scriptures
[1:34:47] that you're meditating on
[1:34:48] from your devotion and he steps out and
[1:34:51] he gathers those and he begins to speak
[1:34:53] and break the bread
[1:34:57] it's adversity this is why
[1:35:04] this is why god and i thank god i think
[1:35:07] god that he has
[1:35:08] ministries that are so sacked for faith
[1:35:15] oh brother samuel brothers so and so you
[1:35:17] know they really don't
[1:35:18] get into this and get into that let me
[1:35:20] just tell you something
[1:35:21] the third pull is not a phrase
[1:35:25] it is the person of jesus christ
[1:35:27] operating in the bride body
[1:35:30] if it's no more than doctrine satan's
[1:35:33] got you
[1:35:36] but it's an operation in the body
[1:35:39] of jesus christ oh
[1:35:48] it comes back to original bible faith
[1:35:52] original bible thing
[1:35:56] let me just close we're closed there
[1:36:00] this is why god would send his word
[1:36:07] you know when god when he speaks here
[1:36:13] in romans 10
[1:36:18] just closed and speaks of
[1:36:21] faith coming by hearing and hearing
[1:36:26] by the word of god see faith can only
[1:36:30] come by the word
[1:36:34] when i come by the word and that word
[1:36:38] paul as you trace back before those
[1:36:40] scriptures
[1:36:42] in that same place
[1:36:46] it must be those
[1:36:49] that preach
[1:36:53] they are sent by god
[1:36:57] so what is it that they are ministering
[1:37:00] by
[1:37:00] and of the faith of god
[1:37:05] do you realize that even as you said at
[1:37:08] your home
[1:37:09] those few of us that are sitting right
[1:37:11] here and have
[1:37:12] been right here you recognize in this
[1:37:15] age
[1:37:16] when god would sinned malachi 4.
[1:37:21] and that same word is still
[1:37:24] being proclaimed not another message
[1:37:27] it's the same message
[1:37:30] that's being preached that must prophesy
[1:37:32] again
[1:37:34] i want you to understand where abraham
[1:37:37] was
[1:37:37] at in genesis 17 when god
[1:37:41] god let him know that abraham
[1:37:46] this is the covenant that i will make
[1:37:49] with thee
[1:37:50] and thy seed that shall circumcise
[1:37:54] every man born every man child born in
[1:37:58] your house
[1:37:58] and even those servants eliza remember
[1:38:02] was a servant
[1:38:02] you see what that was speaking of that
[1:38:04] was even speaking of because god would
[1:38:06] talk about
[1:38:06] even in the the offerings in the old
[1:38:09] testament that a stranger
[1:38:11] who were the strangers me and you the
[1:38:13] gentiles
[1:38:14] as they were sealed in their flesh as a
[1:38:17] sign
[1:38:18] that the faith had been accepted so
[1:38:21] are we sealed circumcised
[1:38:25] with that circumcision that is without
[1:38:28] hands
[1:38:30] god's faith and here
[1:38:34] god is speaking this notice this hasn't
[1:38:36] taken place yet
[1:38:37] he speaks it in genesis 17.
[1:38:41] abraham hears that
[1:38:45] and then god unfolds to him
[1:38:48] and you shall not call
[1:38:52] your wife sarai but thou shalt call her
[1:38:55] sarah for i
[1:39:00] will give thee a son by her
[1:39:04] and him will i make my covenant with
[1:39:07] remember
[1:39:08] the scripture says abraham laughed
[1:39:11] in his heart how
[1:39:15] how is this going to be you see what god
[1:39:17] had to take care of
[1:39:19] the laughter would stop when he took
[1:39:21] care of this down here
[1:39:24] how's he going to take care of this god
[1:39:26] is letting it be known in that chapter
[1:39:28] the word elohim
[1:39:31] his breath his word
[1:39:35] his inspiration is coming out
[1:39:39] over abraham's life it's time for that
[1:39:42] word
[1:39:42] that word is going to have an effect who
[1:39:44] was it that dissolved
[1:39:46] the laughter in abraham's heart
[1:39:51] who was it that dissolved the laughter
[1:39:54] in sarah's heart notice the angel
[1:39:57] referred to him
[1:39:58] he came down and took upon a body
[1:40:02] of flesh and he delivered
[1:40:06] that message to them he did not call him
[1:40:09] abram
[1:40:10] he called him by the revelation abraham
[1:40:14] his priestly name he let him know it's
[1:40:17] time
[1:40:18] for the faith my faith to be reproduced
[1:40:23] abraham your faith is not enough for
[1:40:25] this promise
[1:40:28] sarah you slightly doubted it not all
[1:40:30] the way you slightly doubt it
[1:40:32] but slight doubt is not enough it takes
[1:40:36] my faith
[1:40:40] so what does he come and do he takes his
[1:40:42] word his promise
[1:40:44] and he breathes over their life
[1:40:47] brother brown said how did god change
[1:40:50] sarah
[1:40:51] he said he breathed over her life
[1:40:54] what was it on the on the day of
[1:40:56] pentecost it was the breath of god
[1:40:58] in luke 24 jesus gathered them in there
[1:41:01] and he breathed upon them and said
[1:41:04] receive ye
[1:41:05] the holy ghost what is the holy ghost it
[1:41:08] is the word of god
[1:41:10] in power and demonstration it's the
[1:41:13] gospel
[1:41:14] that is breathed over the life
[1:41:19] and let's say all that under inspiration
[1:41:20] to say this
[1:41:23] he's the same yesterday today
[1:41:27] and forever he's still
[1:41:30] speaking the spirit of truth
[1:41:34] is right here with us
[1:41:37] his word is still proclaimed
[1:41:41] his word is still casting out
[1:41:44] doubt and unbelief
[1:41:49] laughter that could be there how could
[1:41:52] this be me
[1:41:52] or how could that be me
[1:41:56] his word comes to dissolve that i want
[1:41:58] you to understand very clearly
[1:42:00] his word it is the only
[1:42:04] thing that can separate
[1:42:07] you from you
[1:42:11] to where it comes to identify who the
[1:42:14] real you really is on the inside
[1:42:21] and he brings that life forward and here
[1:42:24] we are standing here
[1:42:27] oh sure there could be a lot of thoughts
[1:42:30] go through your mind but when the faith
[1:42:33] of elohim
[1:42:34] the faith of the lord jesus christ
[1:42:38] is there in that heart let me just tell
[1:42:42] you
[1:42:43] that's an anchor that holds
[1:42:46] beyond the veil no matter what comes
[1:42:51] it's the victory that overcomes
[1:42:54] the world even in times
[1:42:58] thoughts can come to your mind sickness
[1:43:00] come to your body
[1:43:01] things can be upset along the way but
[1:43:04] it's the faith
[1:43:05] that overcomes the world why you can't
[1:43:08] sink the faith of god
[1:43:12] this is why human faith
[1:43:15] is not good enough it requires
[1:43:19] the faith that is of him
[1:43:24] and that's what the message of the hour
[1:43:28] it come to do bring us back
[1:43:32] to the original bible faith to re
[1:43:35] store to turn the hearts of the children
[1:43:39] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:43:45] faith is not just a belief many times we
[1:43:46] think of that
[1:43:48] faith well oh this is my faith no no i
[1:43:50] think we've established that the holy
[1:43:51] spirit is so established
[1:43:53] no no no no no we're talking about
[1:43:56] the faith of god that
[1:43:59] belief that comes from god
[1:44:03] that which is of him
[1:44:06] and i said this morning as musicians
[1:44:08] would come will paul if you'll come
[1:44:11] i say it like this if if all that you've
[1:44:14] known
[1:44:15] is human faith maybe you've subscribed
[1:44:18] to the tenants if i can use that that
[1:44:20] same word the brother bram used
[1:44:22] maybe you subscribed to the doctrine of
[1:44:23] the message you subscribed to the
[1:44:25] tenants of the message
[1:44:27] you subscribed to the church
[1:44:31] but the question is do you really have
[1:44:35] that living faith on the inside
[1:44:39] where it's not you it's not you it's not
[1:44:42] it's not you trying to do it but it's a
[1:44:45] love affair
[1:44:47] from the depths from within
[1:44:51] where it's god operating his word
[1:44:55] where you hear his voice i'm say i say
[1:44:58] this and i encourage you
[1:45:01] cast down that spirit of pride listen
[1:45:04] you don't know how long i
[1:45:06] i'd be so ashamed for years i've said
[1:45:09] here
[1:45:10] that's a spirit of pride that's trying
[1:45:11] to hinder you
[1:45:13] cast that down that devil's trying to
[1:45:16] hinder you
[1:45:17] from a promise that belongs to you my
[1:45:19] sister
[1:45:20] he's trying to hinder you from a promise
[1:45:23] brother it belongs to you
[1:45:26] if you just say lord
[1:45:29] come into me fully let that
[1:45:32] faith of the son of god let it drop
[1:45:36] that the lord of glory might be received
[1:45:39] into this tabernacle not made with him
[1:45:44] just the simplicity god
[1:45:47] is moved by the simplicity of the
[1:45:50] confession
[1:45:51] of your heart if there's anything that
[1:45:53] would be in the way let it be cleared
[1:45:54] out
[1:45:56] make it right
[1:45:59] and i say for each and every one of us
[1:46:03] for for all of us because this is not
[1:46:05] just
[1:46:07] for someone who has not fully moved into
[1:46:09] that
[1:46:10] but i would encourage every one of us
[1:46:13] this
[1:46:14] this brings stability in this time
[1:46:18] it speaks to us in our life this is what
[1:46:22] we need to be accumulating
[1:46:24] there should be a building up this is
[1:46:25] what ephesians 4 spoke of
[1:46:27] it's building up until we come to the
[1:46:29] fullness of the measure
[1:46:31] it's accumulating it ought to be a
[1:46:34] hungering within our life
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:38] just saying i feel like i've i've gotten
[1:46:40] a little weak
[1:46:41] then take the admonition of the holy
[1:46:43] spirit let
[1:46:45] the things that god is saying even how
[1:46:48] god is speaking to your life
[1:46:50] in these services be in fellowship with
[1:46:53] him
[1:46:54] even the things the little details that
[1:46:57] he's shown
[1:46:57] his love his care for you
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:03] i feel like i'm getting a little weak
[1:47:07] then i then i look to god and ask god
[1:47:10] say lord
[1:47:12] lord let i want an evaluating are there
[1:47:16] things i've allowed
[1:47:17] to accumulate in my life that's
[1:47:20] weakening that faith
[1:47:22] you see to accumulate sometimes to
[1:47:26] accumulate you've got to go
[1:47:27] and value because sometimes you know
[1:47:30] wife or husband or somebody could say
[1:47:31] hey no more no more here we don't have
[1:47:34] no more room
[1:47:36] and this is where an evaluation comes in
[1:47:38] our life
[1:47:39] is the holy spirit saying i don't have
[1:47:41] any more room
[1:47:43] and it isn't because he's just got
[1:47:45] everything covered
[1:47:47] it's because sometimes we have allowed
[1:47:49] other things to accumulate
[1:47:51] this is where the scripture says
[1:47:53] [Music]
[1:47:55] in the book of jude
[1:47:58] building up yourselves on your most holy
[1:48:03] faith what holy faith his faith
[1:48:07] so how do we build ourselves up what's
[1:48:09] he talking about to building ourselves
[1:48:10] up
[1:48:11] it is the accumulating accumulating the
[1:48:15] goodness of god
[1:48:16] accumulating the mercy of god
[1:48:19] accumulating
[1:48:20] the word of god
[1:48:23] i say holy spirit
[1:48:27] o lamb of god have your way lord
[1:48:31] move through this body move in every
[1:48:33] home lord
[1:48:34] move in every life lord god i pray right
[1:48:38] now lord
[1:48:39] any heart lord that dear god to this
[1:48:42] moment
[1:48:43] it's been lord of human faith and as
[1:48:46] your prophet with the lord admonishes
[1:48:48] he said don't throw that away but let it
[1:48:50] become a real
[1:48:52] living supernatural faith
[1:48:55] oh god i asked lord jesus that in this
[1:48:58] moment
[1:49:00] that every spirit of pride
[1:49:03] cast down lord god like the philistines
[1:49:06] that would
[1:49:07] raise up their head lord in mockery
[1:49:10] satan we rebuke you in the name of jesus
[1:49:13] christ
[1:49:15] this is that faith that was once
[1:49:18] delivered to the saints
[1:49:20] original bible faith the same holy ghost
[1:49:25] in his fullness full power full strength
[1:49:30] full life same nature
[1:49:34] granted lord i pray right now in the
[1:49:37] name of jesus christ
[1:49:39] in the humility of the word lord as
[1:49:42] hearts
[1:49:43] are prostrated before you
[1:49:47] lives o god i pray that lord
[1:49:50] the prayer from their heart would be
[1:49:52] lord i fully surrender
[1:49:54] now lord will you fully come in
[1:49:59] granted lord i pray for every need
[1:50:02] every heart every life that's gathered
[1:50:04] here
[1:50:05] i pray god that for lives that lord
[1:50:08] maybe there's been things
[1:50:10] that's accumulated
[1:50:15] things that lord that it's got them hung
[1:50:18] up like that boat they've got the power
[1:50:21] the engine there behind that boat but
[1:50:24] things lord have
[1:50:26] got them ensnared
[1:50:30] maybe it's not even things of the lord
[1:50:32] that is looked at as sinful it's just
[1:50:34] simply
[1:50:35] the cares of life
[1:50:38] this is where lord paul would admonish
[1:50:40] us
[1:50:42] that they that use the world
[1:50:46] do not abuse it use
[1:50:50] what's what's necessary but don't become
[1:50:54] absorbed
[1:50:56] granted lord i pray in the name of jesus
[1:50:58] christ
[1:50:59] lord you're the revealer of the word
[1:51:01] you're the one lord to not only expose
[1:51:04] and help us that we might see but oh god
[1:51:08] may that be the value
[1:51:10] lord if a person right now
[1:51:13] lord there could be things brought to
[1:51:15] the attention
[1:51:17] and there could be things lord that they
[1:51:19] could try to say
[1:51:20] well what about this or what about that
[1:51:21] but god let it be
[1:51:24] they're focusing on the north star and
[1:51:27] of
[1:51:28] you being the center of that life
[1:51:31] then lord if there's anything that's
[1:51:33] hindering them from walking according to
[1:51:35] that north star
[1:51:37] in liberty then dear god the light of
[1:51:40] the word
[1:51:41] will reveal it may they walk lord
[1:51:45] in the light as you're in the light
[1:51:49] father granite we pray may you watch
[1:51:52] over your children
[1:51:53] strengthen glory granted in the name of
