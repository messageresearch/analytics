over there god bless all of you amen well this morning i hope we are all yearning to enter into the world and i'm also yearning seriously but before that i want to call again my sister to come and give us one special song in tongues and when it comes like that i would be the interpreter and the bible say that when somebody's speaking tongues in the church there might be somebody to interpret if there's no interpreter we should let the person be silent but thank god we have interpreted this morning so sister rita will you come forward i wanted to sing one of my favorite songs that when she

interpretation so jehovah is sitting upon his throne and all the angels have surrounded him and when he talked about the angels talking about you and i and the heavenly host we have all surrounded god on his throne and we are with one accord singing hallelujah [Music] that's all that we are singing hallelujah hallelujah so that is the interpretation i have given you a perfect interpretation hallelujah amen if god bless you without wasting my time again let's open our bible now to first kings chapter 17. first kings chapter 17 and we'll read verse 1. and also read matthew chapter 17 verse 20. first kings chapter one chapter i'm sorry chapter 17 verse one and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel leaveth before whom i stand there shall not be due not reign these years but according to my word matthew matthew chapter 17 and verse 20 and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hands to yonder bliss and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word amen bless it as we sit read also hagar chapter 2 verse 4 tonight yet now be strong oh zerubbabel said the lord and be strong oh joshua son of jose deck the high priest and be strong all your people of the land say unto the lord and work for i am with you sayer the lord of hosts according to the word that i covenanted with you when you came out of egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not for thus saith the lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and i will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea in a dry land and i will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and i will fold this house with glory saith the lord of hosts the silver is mine the silver is mine and the gold is mine see the lord of hosts the glory of this little house shall be greater than of the former say the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace say it the lord of hosts amen this morning we want to speak on the topic creating by your word creating by your word last thursday we spoke on look on jesus and when you look on jesus in all things you are able to do everything with with him all things are possible that if you don't doubt whatever you ask you have it amen so this morning we want to do something like the part two with this topic creating by your word and we know the bible have told us and we believe that words are spirits and uh therefore we christians especially we must be always careful the things that come out from our mouth i pray that the lord will help me that anytime something will come out from my mouth it will be a waste of blessings because you say whoever you bless the person will be blessed and whoever you care the person will be cursed i want to bless and keep on blessing hallelujah so anything that we say we have to be careful because it is wet it can create in the beginning it was god's word that created and everything that we see in existence was created by god by god he said let there be and there was in fact science science or for that matter yes signs sometimes tell us of certain years that this world has been in existence of which by our revolution it's quite different but well they say it and they say it anyhow but what i want to say is that nobody can determine how long our god was in existence before one day he got up and he said let there be and there was it was his word that he used to create everything and the bible said that after his creation that he created man also and he created man in his image so you could look to adam and you can see god and you look to god and you can see adam that was the condition and god gave every power to adam hallelujah adam kulaf in those power he can tell these three i don't i don't like where you are situated be removed and go to the other side and those creatures has to obey because he had that creative power within him hallelujah and so that was how god you know the condition that god put man he gave him so much power to do whatever and you know that adam was the one even that named all the creation from the trees to the animals and the fowls in the air and the falls on the ground every creature adam was given the power to name them and while he was naming them he looked around and you saw the names that would fit them and he gave them exactly hallelujah because he was in the image of god now but that fellowship god broke him when man left the word of god because that ability and power that god gave to him all was based on the word because in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the bible said that there was nothing made without that word so the power that god gave to adam was based on the word but when sin entered into god the garden that power was taken from him the power of creation and so man became so miserable can you imagine that today you live in america where the whole world everybody think that america is a super country is that not it and sometimes you americans even think like that that you are super country yes because everything is so accessible will you be happy that they will tell you that get out from america and go and stay or live in one of this poorest country in this world will you be happy about that i don't think you'll be happy so that day when sin caused god to move down from the garden adam became so miserable because his power was taken from him the god said that you will tell the ground before you feed so it means previously he was not doing that and so adam became so miserable he was put into some condition that he didn't like but there was nothing you could do but brother sister have you thought it that when adam was in that condition god himself was also not happy oh yes because god didn't create a damn to be in that condition but it was a little disobedient that caused him to everybody every evening god went to the garden to have fellowship with adam and so that fellowship got broken you think god was happy no he wasn't that is why right from that day he started looking for how he can restore that fellowship back he searched and look and plan he said no i will restore this fellowship back because i am not happy the reason why when a brother or a sister don't come to church for no reason the reason why we are not happy is that we want to have fellowship it is fellowship that is the reason why we come together and god is very happy when we come together because we fellowship with ourselves and with him are you catching it so from that from then he he he found a way to restore that and one day there was a man called abraham who was living in his father's home well people say well we know that they were not christian but god called him out of his kingdom say abraham come out i am going to show you a place come up from your people and god pull him out and when god pull him out we all know the condition of abraham and his wife they lived without a child but god put faith in abraham when he pulled him out hallelujah the reason was that god was still finding a way to restore that broken fellowship again and he he saw the qualities of one in abraham of ramadan he was called abraham he said come from among your people and abram came up from his people but one day whenever i move out people will wonder where are you going he took his wife his you know workers and the bible say that his nephew lot also went with him but god didn't call lot but lord went with abraham now we know that when they got to a place there was tension between abram servants and that of lords because their animals were increasing now abraham didn't like it so he called us a lot i think our our cattles and our ships are getting so much so badly the way the servants are behaving separate yourself if you go to the west i'll go to the north if you go to the north i'll go to the south whichever way you want the bible said that lord look to the place towards sodom where the vegetation was green because of his he didn't think that oh my my uncle is this mossino so he should choose first in africa we don't do that in africa junior don't choose before seniors oh yes we don't do that when a sinner is there you're the young man no no no no wait let the sinner take first but lord chose first but it was not a border to abraham now when he went away we all know the story that came that some five nations came together and they beseeched sodom and gomorrah and lord was taken captive but one somebody ran escaped and came and told abraham this story abram said what look taken captive oh no i have to go and rescue lord so he organized the man 318 in his house they didn't have a military training they didn't have police training they didn't know anyone tatties but abraham said we are going to fight to rescue lord they went quiet all right and abraham the bible said that he divided these 380 men and they pursued these five nations they conquered them and they rescue lord and his family oh brother and when abraham was coming from the conqueror or from the conquest something happened on the way there was a man down next to him and the man's name was melchizedek oh up to today people don't know who mercedes was the intellectuals are always cracking their brains they don't know who my face attack was and you cannot know who mercy said that case when you don't have the holy spirit you say what is the holy spirit is he speaking in terms noble the holy spirit is god revealing himself to you in the dead that you are living in hallelujah and they will sit down and discuss about mercury and discuss about and and trying to flame whom my christian should be but thank god by the revelation of the word mercury was nobody but god the creator he had no beginning of days he had no ending of days he has no father he has no mother and the only one that qualified that is our god jehovah and everyone met him on the way and brother you know what he said abraham i am going to give you communion why will mercury give communion to abraham because abraham has become an overcomer he overcame his enemies and with love oh somebody would have said oh but after all that guy he himself chose that place so if he has been captured why should i bother somebody could say that but not abraham not abraham that is why no matter what somebody will do against you try and forgive i didn't hear amen there that one is not sweet at all no matter what anybody that will offend you i say according to the bible forgive the person i want to repeat that jesus said if you don't forgive anybody their sense do not think that your father in heaven also forgive your sins so whether you like it or not so long as you are a christian forgive everybody that trespasses against you don't say oh ask for this brother ask for their sister oh no don't go no don't do that abraham didn't do that and that pulled god out from his throne he said no the love that this man have shown let me go and encourage him so the prophet we pulled one of the one of the bodies and he jumped into it and came on this earth as a man melchizedek he was trying to restore faith and he restored faith in the life of abraham and he gave him communion and abraham said wow if you have given me communion let me also give you my tithes so there was a great fellowship between melchizedek and abraham and that is what god is restoring us back or he has restored his back to it and remember beloved methyl neck of the old testament is the lord jesus christ of this new testament amen and now kissing with the creative power jesus christ also demonstrated it one day when he was walking around with these the disciples the bible say that they came upon a man that everybody knew that he was born blind and the disciple asked jesus master who did sin is this his own sin or the sin of the parents he was that was the mind that was the idea that when somebody is sick it means he has committed the sin sometimes it's a wrong judgment you remember the story of job when the friends were telling him that job we think that you are a secret sinner meanwhile didn't sin so when we have that conclusion on people we make wrong judgments so jesus christ told his disciples this man had not sinned neither the parents but this man was born blind so that the glory of god might be manifest oh hallelujah and here we are talking about fights so in this matter any condition that you have you found yourself oh give glory to god yeah sometimes i know it's hard to give glory but that is the word your situation if you handle it well you are going to bring glory to god amen that's what jesus said he said that the glory of god may be made manifest and after saying that the bible said that then his part on the ground and then out of the hospital he formed a clay and put those clay on the eye of the man oh wow who told jesus that that particular clay will be able to create new eye for the man who told jesus christ that the prophet said that human being will consist about 16 elements are not it so many peace were eyeing us but you can name them and i don't know the type of clay god used to create my nose i don't know the type of clay god yeast used to clear create my ear i don't know the type of clay he used to make my hair because he said that we were taken out of the dust is that what the bible say so i don't know the kind of varieties of clay that god used in forming us but that day because jesus christ he was a creator in the beginning he found out that that particular clay was the one that he used in creating the eye of the man so immediately he formed the clay out of his own spirit and anointed the eye of the man he said go and wash in the pool of cilia and the man went and washed his face and he saw whoa for the first time the man saw his own color whether it was white or black or green that was the first day the man saw his own color and the man was rejoicing people were asking is he not a blind man he said yes i am but remember i was oh hallelujah he was the blind man but now he is not it was out of the word of jesus christ he created again and today he can create again because he's the same yesterday today and forever oh this should have brought celebration to the whole people some were rejoicing but some were annoying some were so confused some were so angry why should this man get his eyes back and most of today is a sabbath day why and that was a question from the pharisee they took this man to their council and they asked me he asked him who opened your eyes he said somebody called jesus he said what is he i don't i don't know where he is because everyone who was speaking to me i was still blind they didn't believe the man so they called their parents to come and when the parents also came they also said well this is our son who we know he was born blind but as to how he can now see we don't know ask him after all is more than 30 years the bible said that their parents said that today for a cease because they were afraid there was a warning that if you believe in the lord jesus christ they will just communicate you from the church so all of them were careful so they turn again to the man and they ask him give god the glory but they didn't know that the man had already given god the glory they wanted it again he said but i've already told you do you want to hear it again or perhaps you want to become his disciples also and if god for us is mad he said who tell you that we want to be his disciple we are muslim disciples after that man we don't know where he came from oh you don't know where he came from and he has opened my eye are you not the same people who teach us in the in the church that god don't listen to a sinner if this man is not of god he wouldn't have opened my eyes and they said so what do you make out of him it's a question they asked him then the man looked on them with boldness he said he is the prophet hallelujah listen what you want to teach us you want to teach us you think we don't know our letters and you want to teach us who the prophet is this man cannot be a prophet the man look at them in his life he said well whether you believe it or not whether he is a prophet or not whether he is an illegitimate child or not there is only one thing that i know that once a time i was blind but now i can see oh hallelujah and that's certain things whether you like it or not brother sister whether the world believe it or not there is a message on this hour and that message is preparing us to meet our lord jesus christ anything aside from that is a news like how my brother richard used to say hallelujah anything aside from this message i say is strength and that was the stand of the man whether you believe it or not he didn't care he said once i was blind but now i can see and that was the ultimate and that day on mount camel when the whole israel has fallen into total confusion like how the world is in confusion today they didn't know the right church to attend they didn't know the right god to believe and elijah said now get me over here there will not be any rain on this earth because of your sin because of your unbelief hallelujah because of the peace yeah you are doing worshiping by there will never be rain on this earth until i call it and the moment elijah said that god locked the heavens no rain and the whole place that was farming every place that was farming people were going hungry without food there was no water to drink until god even this thing affected elijah himself and god said well this is my servant come come come come come over get to that woman over there and he she will take care of you initially ravens were given elijah bread i don't know where the god i don't know what the the they have what they have ovens in their homes and they prepared pizza and they supplied elijah and that i was enjoying it until this verse was no more coming god said go to that woman we know that story i don't want you to take too much time over there but then after the end of that prophecy era was looking all over the place in searching of elijah and you all know what to be found until then makes him he said yes go and tell your master today i will show myself to him he should call all the vast prophets let them meet me on mount carmel we want to see whose weight can create and they assembled back prophets here prophet elijah here and the whole israel becoming spectators on the stadium elijah said well we are going to call on our god the god that is god of israel he should answer with fire upon the orders that we are going to ban nobody should put fire inside they say agreed elijah said well you are many i am alone so you do yours first and they did whatever they want to do and the bow prophet started to chant they started to do the all time way that they used to chant calling on their idols bowel to answer they called and called and called and called so many hours there was no answer coming from that then the prophet elijah started kissing them he said hey shout shout shout because maybe baal is going to buy something at target call shall shout out and they shouted and shouted and shouted no response from baal elijah will come and look at them he said are you tired more vigorous more vigor continue to shout maybe he has moved from target to walmart sharp sharp and they were shouting and shouting and shouting and shouting bar was nowhere to be found in fact the bible said that they cut themselves with knives until blood began to oath on their body but they realized that they could not brother do you know why not that the bad prophet didn't know that buck will answer them because they have been doing it always and they know that their god answers them so they knew they were positive that bad will respond but that day while they were calling there was another power standing on the mountain which was the presence of elijah and by then not come to that mountain oh brother says you see the power of the believer you see the power of the believer that is why when god called you he said fear not sometimes believers we allow certain situations to put our faith from us we become so deflected because of some trouble we become so confused we begin to ask ourselves questions am i a true believer yes you are a true believer hallelujah bow recognize that the presence of god has come on the mountain how will he go there will you you dare not and run away brother then elijah told them that hey it's enough you are losing blood too much and the doctors and the nurses are here they will tell you when you lose blood too much you die and elijah that they feathered them he said it's enough i don't want you to die here but i'm going to show you how you are going to die he packed them aside and now the bible said that he prepared the altar with 12 stones representing the 12th tribe of israel and he killed the sacrifice and played the sacrifice upon the altar and he requested for 12 barrels of water four four four to watch the sacrifice and he created a trend around the sacrifice and he said lord my lord i have done this according to your word therefore glorify yourself by bringing fire down upon the earth before he said amen bomb fire and the fire of god blended the sacrifice paint everything on it and the water that have you know surrounded the altar the fire lit all see that is why when we come to the lord jesus christ we don't give half of our body to the lord and keep half to ourselves we give our body all so that when he is washing us he will wash all our body when he is filling up with the power you will feel everything that is enough perfect then all the rejoicing now they were praising god that indeed jehovah god is their god elijah said well don't let any of the bad prophet escape kill them kill them elijah make them kill all of them because they were unbelievers because they were adult worshipers because they loved the kings of the world and today we have got that power that same power to kill every unbelief in our lives anything that goes contrary to the word of god we kill it by our word elijah spoke the word and today we have the word to speak it out and to begin to create your word can create the atmosphere that you want to be in hallelujah amen and amen according to his word he created it and according to your word you can create it also today can you say amen here yes brother i want you to believe that before i continue sister i want you to believe that before i continue i say your word can create an atmosphere for you the atmosphere that you want to be in amen when the lord brought deliverance of adam to salvation to israel in egypt we know how uh moses i'm sorry a pharaoh started to prove some kind of stubbornness until he had the gas to ask moses who is that god hey you want to know the god of moses then moses said aaron cast the road on the ground and aaron cuts the road on the ground and the road turned to be serpent snake then they started laughing genius and generous because they know how to do it magically but moses didn't command that magic moses was divine declaration that god is able to do anything that he wants hallelujah he is the generator of diversity the g.o.d generator of diversity he can do anything that he wants can you say amen so when he put the road on the ground and genesis and generals came around they saw but this is a magical trick this wasn't the magical trick it was the power of god they also cast their rods on the ground and it turn into the same serpent perhaps bigger than that of moses but when power and power meet then we see the super power that is why the nations on this set number one nation fear number two number two fear number one number three number four number four fear number five they are all afraid of themselves but thank god i say thank god we are the sons and daughters of god we are taking this earth by force because the egg belongs to us hallelujah the system that is going on now we are pushing all away and we will inherit this earth and the above righteousness shall cover the face of this earth hallelujah as the waters cover the sea one venus and gem bridge also turned into road they were laughing but look at what happened moses road which attempted to be serpent raised his head and galloped that of genius and that of the embrace and that was their end you can't face god and he proves so much stubbornness and we know that 10th place that god struck on the land of egypt to destroy egypt until their first sons died now it was too much for pharaoh pharaoh said okay go i allow you now and israel set off the journey and they came to face the red feet now when they got to the red sea people started asking questions why where is the motorway or what is the freeway that we have to pass on they begin asking moses questions they were standing there when all of a sudden they saw pharaoh and his armies chasing them to the sea because pharaoh has decided that he had made a mistake he shouldn't have allowed israel to go so they were going to bring them back to egypt and israel started crying everybody was so much disturbed and they asked moses are there no graves in egypt that you have brought us here to die now who told you that you are going to die because they saw the chariot and the horsemen of pharaoh are approaching them they became so confused beloved i don't want you to be in that condition anytime in your life can you say amen anytime you see any situation coming your way stand and let your word create let your word change the atmosphere for what you say that is what will manifest hallelujah get disturbed moses and they say moses why have you brought us here now look at pharaoh and his men they are coming to destroy us but thank god before the soldiers would get to where the israelites was god came down in the pillar of fire to become a block between them and so the photos suggest we're not able to cross over to attack them they didn't know that god was going to do something like that hallelujah that is what the believer must always live by faith they cried and cried and cried until moses himself oh oh god why why have you allowed pharaoh and and his people to ac to chase us again oh god moses and brother if you don't take time somebody will influence you wrongly what is what was not in the position to cry because he met that pillar of fire and he has a witness two signs so you cannot tell moses that there is no god because he met him and when he asked him what is your name he said i am that i am but look he allowed the people he allowed the congregation to cause him also to cry what did god tell him let's see genesis chapter 14 i'm sorry exodus chapter 14 and verse 10. are you with me i hope nobody is sleeping here we worship god we don't sleep okay great example chapter 14 and verse number 10 and when pharaoh drew nine the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians matched after them and they were so afraid of mine and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt has all taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore has that dealt us with us to cry to carry us forth out of egypt it not this the word that we tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it better for us to serve the egyptians then that we should die in the wilderness verse 13 and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom ye have seen today yeah shall see them again no more forever hallelujah those troubles that you think is your trouble you will not see them again those things those difficulties those enemies you will not see them again honestly according to the word of god verse 14 the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the lord sat unto moses wherefore cries down unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward amen speak unto the children of israel they'll go forward there is no turning back we are going forward whether the wealth straighten up or not we are going forward the one that you repent or not we are going forward amen with that sickness or disease we are going forward and that was god what god told moses he said why are you crying this is not a time of crying but go forward in fact and they went forward and when they went forward the impossibility that was in the mind of most of the people it became possible they didn't know that the recipe was going to be parted but when god instructed them go forward he knew what he was telling them and moses raised his rod on a sea and the bible said that it patted into two and they walked on a dry ground isn't that amazing amazing they walk on the dragon look you just fought them how many years those waters have been there you cannot determine the volume of clay or mud after there was water but the power of god his word of creation all of a sudden the place became dry that is the god that we are worshiping that is the god that we are worshipping beloved and the bible said that israel walk on a dry ground do you know that why they were crossing the egyptians who just also followed them but they didn't walk on a dry ground after israel walked their back became muddy can you say amen there they are back because so any place if they're rich here is dry ground the moment they cross the plains become magic so the egyptian soldiers chased israel on a magic ground and they could not reach them after the last one crossover then god penned the waters upside down again and he swallowed all of them up oh hallelujah oh brother sister just speak the word i said just speak the word and there shall be a performance create everything around you by your own word god have given you that ability i say god have given that ability don't entertain fear as a christian in any circumstances speak to the system speak to the condition and there shall be creation do you remember the woman that the bible says that he was uh uh what do we call it uh she was sick for 12 years the woman with a blood issue that is the woman i'm talking about here she has been to one hospital to another from one physician to another and the physicians were making good use of of her money they prescribed wrong wrong medicines and this woman one day when she heard that christ was passing somewhere she created a word within herself nobody advised her no doctor taught her but she said but if i can touch the hem of his garment i will be made oh and this woman brother reached to jesus and indeed touched his hand the helm of his garment and immediately she was healed until the power of that healing virtue affected the body of jesus christ jesus said why peter i have become so weak he said virtue has gone out of me and when virtue is gone out of you you walk as if there is air blowing you yeah you become so light that was the condition that jesus found himself in because of the word that a woman created hallelujah he turned around he said peter somebody has touched me huh who is that peter somebody have touched me and peter said oh master once we're coming on the way there have been so many people that have been touching you and all that so why do you say that jesus said you don't know what you are talking about yes i know that a lot of people have touched me but this touch is different from all because this church was a touch of creation this start was a touch of faith hallelujah and so once they were asking then the woman owner jesus said woman your faith has made you whole your faith meaning your word hallelujah has made you whole and jesus said in matthew 17 he say if we have faith if we have faith and we will not doubt we can speak to the mountain be thou removed and go yonder and they have to obey that is the word equally we can believe this is a matter of faith and belief because faith it is not designed by the architects faith is not designed by the uh this uh what we call them those who use computer to draw ah there's a name they call them graphic designers you don't design that fight is created by yourself the woman created the faith and it became a wet on her lips if only i can touch his garments he did it and he succeeded oh hallelujah brother today that same word is what we are using to create our environment i am a christian today by god's grace and nobody prescribed it for me i sat down one day and i created it by my own word after swimming in the condition and the system of this world wasted time and wasted yes one day i decided to follow jesus i created it and it manifested that is what today i'm standing before you preaching the word to you you did also the same that is why you are here today feeding on god's word created it by your own self amen do you remember the story the prophet told us that one time him and some friends brethren they went on hunting and they come and come and come they didn't get in again and he was separated a lot of why and he thought of going back to see his friends so that because it was getting late then he said all of a sudden he had a voice speak because the lord knows that he loves squirrels he said you can speak them into existence he said he was taking a letter back the lord is that you there was silence for some time so he decided to go on and the voice came again he said speak speak them into existence man so when the prophet was so much convinced that indeed it was the same voice that speaking to him he started to speak he looked around him it's a law i want to ask squirrel to come and patch on brother bill's head i won't want to be on sister rosanna's head and i want one to be on brother willis head i'm just giving example of what happened the prophets show exactly where those scholars should be we did not took off an eye lord behold a squirrel a squirrel was on the head of barbie the prophet rub his face can it be true yes sir his word created any shot boom he waited for some time then you look what sister roseanne said the second one was on there he and he shot amen then it was not quite long another one came up on brother crew's head and that was even closer to him than all that he shot he aimed at the squirrel and he shot the squirrel he missed it he shot he missed it he shot the message he said what how can this be me an expert shooter and i'm shooting this ring close to me then the squirrel went away he waited for some time then the one that he requested to be on brother billy brother will's head was there and he shot it three he asked for three and then god even added one to him but the one that was on the head over the cruise he was not able to kill it you know the reason because when he was demonstrating his words of creation he did not ask god to place a day can you say amen he did not have got to place it there so he did not get that one his words of creation brother that god has not changed that god has not changed he's the same yesterday today and forever oh brother don't say that you are not a prophet sister don't say that you are not a prophet the same anointing that god gave to the prophet is the same anointing that is upon you today why are we called believers we are called believers because we believe something amen amen amen and amen elijah spoke and something happened woman spoke and something happened and today you can speak and something will happen why do we lay hands upon their sick and pray for them if we don't believe that they'll be healed why would we pray then to become hypocrisy but we lay our hands and pray because we know god we hear our way and heal the sick oh hallelujah elijah spoke this into existence muslims put this into existence the same way you can speak today so i say speak the word and create do you know that anything you tell god to do you put god in action are you aware of that anything you do anything you tell god to do you put god into action god will make sure that you have what you you say if only you can believe man oh hallelujah now let me read something quickly uh from the prophet okay he said all things are possible now just simple trying to hide behind some kind of church doctrine instead of coming out and saying you ain't got no faith so that is all satan never received the holy ghost he don't have nothing he doesn't have anything to give you faith it is god that god the faith and just as you are filled with god you are filled with faith if you are the son of god you are like god he just speak the word and it creates itself his worst the creative power how would the world come here he made it out of things which were not he just said it let there be and here it is he believed his own word and today you can believe your own word oh there man is too small i want a big man i say you can believe your own word and when you believe your own word there must be a creation amen he said cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the garden of eden i was going to chuck it but i am going to say it the prophet didn't choke it too i'll not also choke it i will say it in here he said man is omnipotent man you and i he said you don't believe that but he is he said a man that is fully surrounded to god is omnipotent did not he said in mark 11 2 2 whatever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass you can have what you have said what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together through omnipotence something got to shake oh hallelujah when god and man comes together something got to shake whosoever you say or whatsoever you say with that creative power of an importance of god knowing that his he has promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met their histones oh isn't he wonderful too omnipotence meets and you are one then god is one but you meet on his way you don't just meet you meet on his way hallelujah that day when peter and john were entering into the beautiful what the what the sanctuary and they met that who was always there begging for arms and the bible said that when they got there the man stretch his hand expecting to get something from them but peter and john look on the man and they told him man look on us peter didn't say look on me oh look on john he said look on us so the ass is plural is that not it and you may think that it was only peter and john standing there but the lord jesus christ was standing there with them so he said look on us silver we don't have god we don't have diamond we don't have but what we have here right now is what we are giving you in the name of jesus christ of god rise up and the man arose the creative power from the word of a man god have put you in that condition don't belittle yourself so long as your faith is concerned sometimes christians we entertain fear hey this thing that i'm going to pray on will it work oh don't never consider those attack the situation by faith and create the word amen they say that in the name of jesus christ the one that we are standing here with we say rise up and the man arose and he was jumping and he was dumping he was jumping and limping and shouting and praising god hallelujah amen just speak the word beloved and there shall be a performance when two omnipotent meets god happened when the prophet went to the lemon mountains in sabrina kenyon you remember what happened there so many things happened the one notable one was when you saw savannah picking him up and revealing the secret of all the bible to him and the lord will go and preach it it was at that vein that when they were going the mystery cloud formed in the skies whether you believe that or not there are people that believe that why would that thing happen over there it was because two omnipotent have met and one day this same prophet went to the home of sister hattie you know that sister patty was a poor sister the prophet described her situation sometimes it was pitiful and there was such an anointing that came upon the prophet and he went to see the sister he said sister hating ask anything that you desire and if it doesn't fall on your lap don't believe me to be a servant of god and he was going up and down he was going up and down his word has started creating sister he said if you want even one million dollars right now consider it done he was going up and down and the woman was thinking about what to say her sister did it was crippled all the time but what happened to her her conscience shifted to his her two sons who were not believers but even when this thing was going on according to the story they were making some mockery and so sister sister hetty i got a hold of them immediately and he told the prophet i want the salvation of my sons the prophet said have it immediately immediately these two children who were making mercury of this system the thing that was going on they rushed and knelt down and asked god to forgive them and they repented west of creation oh hallelujah brother we can do the same thing right now because the power in the message of this hour it will never lose until all the ransom church of jesus christ be saved until the bread of jesus christ is raptured and when we are going we go with that power don't let us belittle ourselves don't let us sometimes think that those powers are no longer the word of god is still here with us and it's in us we can create by it hallelujah now i'm going on to the holy spirit and when i get into here i am in the holy spirit by a baptism is that right that is right what does the holy spirit do it gives me power power to be a preacher power to be a singer power to be a believer power to speak with tom's power to interpret tongues it is full of power for the holy spirit is the power of god it was the power of god that turned me around it was the power of god that sanctified me now it is the power of god that fills me amen i am cutting from all things yeah possessing all things okay he says he said brother abraham i need healing the promise is yours but if you ever get it you aren't going to get it easy i'm going to tell you that you are going to have to take it away from satan satan captures your health you've got the right to go to satan and say give my heart back to me hand it over to me i come in the name of the lord the possessor of heaven and earth and i am his heir give it back hallelujah you took my child you got to mix up with the wrong boy you took my ball and mixed up with the wrong girl i claimed them that is right i claim my children i claim my brother i claim my sister you can claim all your family members yes satan you've took you've taken them from god's house coerced them out there but i am coming after them it is possible it is possible like how satan was disturbing the sons of sister hattie but sister hattie prayed sister hattie spoke the word and it penned the children around you can do the same if your son has gone well-world if your daughter have gone well just speak the word let your word create claim down from the hands of the devil don't be discouraged don't reach a point of discouragement continue to have faith in the lord and let your words create a good atmosphere around you amen do i still have a lot of time are you sure then i'm going to add another one hour he said whatever god did i don't know but that sounds too still is it whatever god did i don't know you remember that story that when the uh amorites and americans were against uh joshua and israel and each drive prayed a prayer he was going to i mean fight them and he organized his soldiers and he attacked them and when it was destroying the enemies it was getting light it was getting late but joshua wanted to finish his enemies so he stood up and he raised his eye to the skies and you spoke sun stand still don't move moon don't come across and it was so man like you and i he stood on god's word and spoke the word and it created and the bob said there had never been a day like that that a man who stopped the movement of the sun that it happened in her beloved you can do something you can do something to your life you can do something to the system hallelujah let your word create something let your word create the atmosphere that you want to be in amen amen joshua cause that to happen and as long as you are in the line of duty keeping god's word doing just what he told you to do matching by the others of god you've got a right to say to that mountain be moved god keep his word if you say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that that what you said will come to pass you can have that what you have said just say it praise the name of our god he said be in the line of duty meaning be on the word of god what god what says that is what you know because you cannot be outside the word of god and think that your word can create the atmosphere no you must be in the word and on the word and jesus said that day you will know that i am in the father and i you and you in me and the prophet said what day is that he said today not yesterday not tomorrow but today today there you will believe the word of god he is in you and you are in him your word can create your word can create beloved your word can create according to the word amen now in closing i want to ask a question if this world the way it has been so confused does he put fear in you no the answer is what no if it is putting fear in you then it means you are lacking something that is why we have allowed ourselves to be molded into the image of god all this that we are talking about beloved you must allow yourself for the word of god to mold you into the image of god if you are not in the image of god forget about it but if you allow yourself like the prophet said that when the blasphemy puts the iron into the fire he blows the fire examined it he blows it for the fire to kindle to bend the metal so it will come to a point that that metal and the fire there will be no difference and when it is yellow or red like that that he pull it from the fire and place it on an unveil oh hallelujah and then he hammered that metal why is he a marinade he is hammering because he is trying to mood we'll close very soon don't worry hallelujah brother can you put that thing on board for us amen let us see some some little uh uh what yes uh uh some little objects that all the instruments for that matter that the what we call the blasphemy to use which are very notable i want us to go through that quickly and then we go okay are you tired give her the anvil the angel is the main thing that the blast meat always you know to nail those metal on okay yes that is the anvil down there and on that anvil oh it's not out here but i see it on my on my screen okay let's give the brothers a little time okay amy i don't want you to get tired sometimes i look to some of you your face and and i want to close and at the same time i look to some people's face and i want to preach preach preach preach yes sir sometimes when we are behind the pulpit some people their faces take our anointing away so when i'm preaching there are some faces i don't look at i look at the faces that can make me preach more because there are people small time they think they are so much tired and they begin to change their faces somehow and they close close close close not close amen yes that is the unveil okay can i go on now the unveil it has six components on it and this component each and everyone has a particular work that the plasmid use informing those what do we collect the product we have the hardy hole on it we have the preachy hole we have something to call the step we have the horn we have the face and we have the round edge six of them and we know according to our revelation that the masses is always a mass number but the number seven is always god but you ask yourself why is it so now the number seven in the factory of this blasphemy is always the finished product because you use the six components to mold the object and when the object finish then that one becomes the seventh so the seventh is always a mystery oh hallelujah hallelujah you think that the bride of paul's day do you think that they know anything about the services they don't they didn't they didn't the bride in arunachal you think they know something about the serpent seed amen you think the bride in the time of martin and luther and wesley you think there are certainty they know what we know no but the question is why is it that you and i there are so many things that we know in the course this is the seventh church where god has revealed himself and this is the finished work of jesus christ oh hallelujah and i thank god brother sister i always rejoice that god didn't put me in the time of paul i always rejoiced that god didn't put me in the time of arenas i always rejoiced god didn't put me in the time of columbus or martin or martin luther or john wesley but god put me in this time oh hallelujah and i have seen the finished work of god [Applause] amen amen the finished product of god we are the bride of jesus christ and the bible says that without us they are not perfect it means we are the finished product of jesus christ so long as the blood of jesus christ is concerned i don't care how the world will look at us amen because they cannot understand us and we too would not understand them whether they like it or not we are those that the prophets of old are looking onto and they are shouting they are shouting they are shouting finish hard finish hard finish hard in fact they are looking on you right now if you are rejoicing at the preaching of the world they are also rejoicing if you are sleeping at the preaching of the world you make them also those brother is it going to work is it going to work okay don't worry if it's not going to work we'll try another time but let me finish with this now why is the blasphemy is on that work he has the mind of what he's molding is that not it he has the mind and when he move the letter from the fire it is not the matter that tells the blasphemy put me here or there if the blasphemy need to use the preaching he will use it if you use the hardy hole you will use it if you use the horn on the wrong edge you will use it that metal don't have any say that is why we don't tell god how he should make us we don't tell god god do this god do that god make me this way god knows what he has prepared us for oh praise the name of our god and once you put the metal on the anvil he'll raise the hammer amen because the metal is ready to be struck there is something they call billows or the fan we call it fun the one that they squeeze it has two two um handles this horizon have you seen it before great and they squeeze this together and that is what emitted air to put the fire on fire let me put it that way it put the fire on fire they squeeze it together one here one day the old testament and the new testament we squeeze it together we squeeze it together to build the deliver if you believe that i say amen here the old testament and the newton we don't preach only old testament we don't preach all the news testament we squeeze both together to build the church of jesus christ oh hallelujah and when the fire is burning within that you realize that the metal becomes so red and you cannot differentiate that is why the believer your character and the doctor jesus christ must unite they say they have to see what they say that is a christian and then when the blasphemy pulls that metal this is what they call the tongs some call it a device they use it to grab the metal because of course he cannot use his hand and pull it from the fire and put it on the anvil now all those things represent the word of god because yes god bless you that is the anvil and it has six components on it and he he uses it at all times but the product is the finished product or the service and when he move the metal from the fire and put it on the anvil then he raised the hammer to do what to do what to hit it and begin his mood and he read the hammer remember that hammer is the word of god maybe the thinking man fell down and you used to hit the metal when he realized that it is getting cold you put it back into the fire is that not it and you fan again you see that is where the only place we have our joy is not on the football park it's not on the dancing halls it is not where you smoke cigarette and we or marijuana but our joy we have it in the house of god oh praise the name of our god i know satan don't like what i'm saying but i believe it is where we have our joy don't tell me that but daniel when i get my pizza and my ice cream i am joyous no that is necessary anyhow for your body but the reaction that gives you joy is when you come to the house of god hallelujah then he will find it again and pull it up again and put it there and you raise the the hammer maybe christ is the mystery of god revealed he will palm palm palm is moodiness brother my sweet sister i don't know the message that got ahold of you there are so many people they came face to face with the message of this hour they read a book and they believed that is the hammer of god on you that day i said that was the hammer of god on you that day it broke you it put you into pieces and it reminded you from that day you were a new creature the bible said that if you come into the lord behold all things are gone and all things has become new now in closing when the blasphemy hit the matter do you know that there are some particles that break down and the blasphemy don't need that again you know that the blasphemy don't take it again because he don't need it and when god brabile put us in a fire and you use the below to furnace and we bend like the same fire and instead of hitting us with that ion things broke out from us fornication broke out from us adultery broke out from us cigarette smoking broke out from us fighting broke out from us gossiping broke out from us stealing stealing small small penis it broke up from us every dirty character broke out from us and we became molded into the image of god that is why we have the power to create by our world he say if you believe and you don't doubt tell this mountain be down removed and go up your neck and they will obey you the lord bless you the lord strengthen you the lord fill you with his goodness the lord let his face shine upon you and be in that condition from now that you are going to create an atmosphere that will manifest the revealed word of god god bless you empty [Music] i'm broken i came back to a vessel of honor to sky by but he did not despair he started over again and i'm so blessed today he didn't throw the clay away over and over he moves me and makes me into his likeness if i change the claim [Music] of honor i am today and we all become jesus [Music] he is the porter i am the glee molded innocent he wants me to say shall we be on our feet now but when i stumble and i fall and my best will breathe [Music] oh and over he moves me and makes me [Music] into his likeness [Music] i am [Music] oh beloved he is the same yesterday today and forever if we can stand upon his word i will not doubt will not entertain fear we can say whatever we want to say and it shall be done let us bother our hands gracious heavenly father we thank you o father once again for meeting us on your way your word have come forth to your children lord you said that it will not return to you void but it must go and accomplish the reason why you have sent it let me commit ourselves into your mighty hands further anything that surround us anything that we go through anything that we see may it never take our faith away may he give us the substance the power to stand upon your word [Music] help us always to be on the line of duty now further according to your word anything that we proclaim it shall be done as elijah called for the fire as the woman thought within herself oh but if i can touch the helm of his garment my problems were rolled away and it
