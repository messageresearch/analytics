[29:19] through it all it certainly isn't any
[29:22] any great stock in our genes there's a
[29:25] greater gene it's a greater gene that
[29:28] was down on the inside and God come and
[29:31] he found that gene amen and then that
[29:36] gene is really what found us that's what
[29:39] really unlocked who we really were we
[29:42] were stumbling around wondering and
[29:44] trying to fit in here trying but God
[29:47] came along and then there was a match
[29:49] that was made and then you realize when

[29:54] not the son of I could say James and Pat
[29:57] Brown I'm the son of God there's been a

[30:18] singing anymore if we could let's turn
[30:20] in the Bible to Exodus 25 will read for
[30:23] one scripture here and then we'll let
[30:26] you be seated and to see how the Lord
[30:30] just just takes us here tonight

[31:17] was something there to receive it Lord
[31:21] and and to be able to reflect that
[31:24] gospel that has been shined into our
[31:26] lives Lord this is our desire Lord is
[31:30] just to reflect you Lord father we pray
[31:34] that tonight that you'll just come Lord
[31:36] be the speaker here Lord and hear
[31:40] through us tonight as well Lord may you
[31:42] come and just take your word you know
[31:45] our needs you know questions upon hearts
[31:49] and father we just ask that just to be
[31:52] in your hands that you can speak lip to
[31:55] ear Lord to us tonight Lord we desire
[31:59] just to get out of the way and father
[32:01] even from the toils and and the cares of
[32:03] this life and this day we know that Lord
[32:06] that our life is in your hands we're
[32:08] trusting in you Lord so father as we
[32:11] Lord would not even try to take thought
[32:14] of tomorrow because as you have spoke to
[32:17] us Lord and our rest to say that
[32:20] tomorrow will take care of itself may we
[32:23] rest Lord God in you and as you would
[32:26] come and speak to our hearts tonight and
[32:28] minister to every need Lord spiritually
[32:31] and physically we pray we give you all
[32:34] the praise honor glory and they know
[32:36] Jesus Christ amen amen
[32:40] in Exodus 20:5 we'll read one verse of
[32:44] scripture and then I'm ones gonna let
[32:46] you be seated here
[32:49] here says and thou shalt make a
[32:52] candlestick of pure gold of beaten work
[32:56] shall the candlestick be made his shaft
[33:01] and his branches his balls
[33:05] his knobs and his flowers shall be of
[33:10] the same may God bless you as you're
[33:15] being seated I want to speak to you here
[33:21] on a thought tonight we been looking at
[33:25] for some time and tests and trials and
[33:27] you know sometimes there's things that
[33:31] you get well you you just you just
[33:33] follow the Lord and you don't know
[33:34] everything of what is all going to come
[33:36] out but we're always we're in a journey
[33:39] and God knows exactly what we what we
[33:42] have need of and many of these things
[33:45] that when I look at it and when I look
[33:48] over this this part of the word and
[33:50] looked at it here for many weeks months
[33:51] and just something just began to really
[33:55] just further stand out to my heart and I
[33:58] want to just take a thought on a beaten
[34:01] work to display light a beaten work to
[34:07] display light when we look at this you
[34:11] know we we won't get to this tonight but
[34:14] brother Branham likens this he takes
[34:17] this very part of this candlestick and
[34:19] he likens it to not only the the
[34:23] suffering of the Lord Jesus but how that
[34:26] we know as we looked at this a past
[34:29] couple of weeks on the dead of love oh I
[34:31] oh and how that Paul said that I might
[34:33] fill up the sufferings that are left
[34:37] behind of Christ for his body sake
[34:40] and we know that the suffering itself
[34:43] it's something that I believe that the
[34:45] grace of God has lifted us to a place
[34:48] and he will continue to lift us to a
[34:50] place sometimes in the midst of a trial
[34:52] we are we are so focused on ourselves
[34:55] within the midst of it and that is
[34:57] something that then how God will by His
[35:00] grace allow us to be able to
[35:02] come to a place to be able to look
[35:04] beyond ourselves and I'll tell you this
[35:06] right here I need prayer in that we we
[35:09] all need prayer in that I read where
[35:11] Paul says our glory in my infirmities
[35:13] I've Lord I say lord help me get to that
[35:15] place you know because Paul said the
[35:19] reason he said in doing that that the
[35:21] power of Christ the tent might rest upon
[35:25] my life so we realized that the very
[35:28] first thing we will look at and many
[35:31] times as we'll look within ourselves but
[35:33] yet we know that every test and trial
[35:35] that comes our way that it's already
[35:37] ordained by God and God is overseeing
[35:40] every bit of it to see that the molding
[35:43] and then the out working of our life
[35:45] that it's his life that he wants to
[35:48] display and really if it wasn't for the
[35:50] test or trial we we would not be able to
[35:53] truly be able to display the grace of
[35:56] God and even to the manner of what God
[35:59] desires to bring forth out of our life
[36:01] so I'm thankful that God helps us to be
[36:05] able to come into that place to where
[36:08] that you'll allow things to come our way
[36:10] to where that you and I can come to that
[36:12] place and say Lord I'm just trusting you
[36:15] as this I I don't know how to I'm trying
[36:17] to see a way out of this and I don't see
[36:20] a way out of it I don't see any exit
[36:22] door out of this so I'm just gonna put
[36:24] my eyes on you and I'm just gonna trust
[36:26] you to take me through this because we
[36:29] know that everything God does is perfect
[36:31] and he's May he's working all things for
[36:34] his good for our good and and when we
[36:37] look at this here in the scriptures when
[36:39] we look at it it says coming back to
[36:42] this verse it says thou shalt make a
[36:44] candlestick of pure gold of beaten works
[36:48] shall the candlestick be made his shaft
[36:51] his branches his bowls
[36:54] his knobs and his flowers shall be of
[36:58] the same what we would see even within
[37:02] it that it is a beaten war of this was
[37:04] not something that could be brought out
[37:07] of Egypt there was nothing like this
[37:09] that could have been brought out of
[37:11] Egypt God was not going to use something
[37:14] that was already construct
[37:15] and fashioned upon the earth but God was
[37:19] going to take elements of things that he
[37:22] had placed here in the earth and God was
[37:25] going to use those elements when they
[37:27] would be formed and shaped that it would
[37:30] actually reflect his glory of something
[37:32] that would be even much greater when he
[37:36] by his own life would be able to come
[37:40] into a body of believers and begin to
[37:43] reflect his own life I want you to
[37:45] notice that within here in the
[37:47] scriptures as we look as we're reading
[37:49] it it speaks first of all of a
[37:52] candlestick of pure gold
[37:54] then it speaks of this candlestick it
[37:57] doesn't speak in plurality but it speaks
[38:00] in singular that this candlestick and
[38:03] then out of this candlestick it is his
[38:05] branches it's his knobs all of this is
[38:08] about him and then as we go on down
[38:11] through the scriptures if I can just
[38:13] continue to read it says and six
[38:15] branches shall come out of the sides of
[38:18] it three branches of the candlestick out
[38:20] of the one side and three branches of
[38:23] the candlestick out of the other side
[38:25] three bowls made like unto almonds with
[38:29] an OP and a flower in one branch and
[38:31] three bowls made like almonds in the
[38:35] other branch with an OP and a flower so
[38:38] in the six branches that come out of the
[38:42] candlestick so what we're seeing is is
[38:45] this candlestick that how that this
[38:48] candlestick is to be made out of pure
[38:50] gold but out of the candlestick is to
[38:53] come six branches they will be his
[38:57] branches these flowers which would be
[39:00] that of the almond flowers which would
[39:02] speak it's the almond itself is the very
[39:04] the flower itself is the very first
[39:07] flower that will come forth after winter
[39:10] after the darkness is passed that where
[39:13] that almond itself it will speak of that
[39:16] life it will speak of firstfruits and so
[39:19] when we we look into it it says the
[39:22] candlestick shall be a ford bowls made
[39:25] like unto almonds with her not with
[39:27] their knobs and their flowers
[39:29] there shall be a knob under two branches
[39:31] of the same and enough under two
[39:33] branches of the same and an OP under two
[39:35] branches of the same according to the
[39:38] six branches that proceed out of the
[39:41] candlestick their knobs and their
[39:43] branches shall be of the same all it
[39:46] shall be one beaten work of pure gold
[39:51] and thou shalt make the seven lamps
[39:54] thereof and they shall light the lamps
[39:56] thereof that they may give a light over
[39:58] against it so these these lights the
[40:02] lamps themselves when they were to be
[40:04] lit they would cast their light over to
[40:09] highlight the candlestick itself but
[40:13] within this when you begin to look at
[40:15] this is truly you know when we see these
[40:18] things it's truly a masterpiece of
[40:21] divine inspiration this is something
[40:24] that as we said that this was not what
[40:27] they carried out of Egypt they carried
[40:29] gold they carried precious things out of
[40:32] Egypt but they did not carry any of
[40:34] these things that would be used within
[40:37] the tabernacle or even that of anything
[40:39] that would be replicated like it but
[40:41] remember within it this inspiration that
[40:45] we're reading from right here in Exodus
[40:47] 20:5 is where Moses himself was called
[40:51] by God to come up into the mountain and
[40:54] he was called to come up unto the Lord
[40:57] into the mountain he was going to
[40:59] receive the tablets of the Lord and to
[41:02] receive from God and as he's up there of
[41:05] division begins to break forth and we
[41:08] see that this vision it all the way
[41:10] through the Bible the Bible itself is
[41:13] the great book of redemption all the way
[41:16] through it shows and depicts Redemption
[41:19] and how that you know even from the very
[41:21] beginning and then down into here how
[41:23] that God Himself is by this inspiration
[41:27] he's making known to to Moses within it
[41:30] that this is this is a pattern these are
[41:33] things that I want you to see here and I
[41:35] want you then to coming back down to
[41:37] earth
[41:38] to bring that vision back down to earth
[41:40] I want you to think about this maybe you
[41:42] hadn't thought about this but I look at
[41:44] all of the detail that was given here
[41:47] that was given to Moses and you know
[41:49] when Moses comes down this time how that
[41:51] everything where the people had already
[41:53] started to sin and they had made a
[41:56] golden calf and you recognized that
[41:59] there were men in the camp who were
[42:01] skilled to be able to craft things and
[42:03] make things but they were still under
[42:05] the inspiration of Egypt they had not
[42:08] come under this inspiration because you
[42:10] see in order to come under this
[42:12] inspiration it would have to be then a
[42:15] word that would be given and that word
[42:17] would be spoken if I can say it over
[42:20] this generation and then the anointing
[42:23] of God could begin to fall that what God
[42:26] had spoken there in the heavens would
[42:28] actually become manifest in the earth
[42:31] that's always God's pattern it's an
[42:34] inspiration we we can't take the Word of
[42:36] God and begin to make or form from a
[42:39] previous inspiration but it's got to be
[42:42] by the fresh inspiration that God gives
[42:46] in this hour and this season it it's not
[42:49] a different inspiration it's the same
[42:52] inspiration that was poured out on the
[42:55] day of Pentecost it's the same Holy
[42:58] Ghost as a matter of fact the scripture
[43:00] lays that out for us in the book of
[43:02] Revelation it's the seven spirits of God
[43:05] God don't have seven spirits but it is
[43:07] the same Holy Spirit coming forth seven
[43:10] times through seven ages it's the same
[43:13] God coming down and performing what was
[43:17] in the heavenlies is now to be manifest
[43:20] in earth it's not an earthly pattern
[43:23] that God is pulling this from but it's a
[43:25] heavenly pattern and to see that how
[43:28] that this was stated here I wish I would
[43:30] have given a picture here tonight within
[43:32] this because maybe not all have seen it
[43:34] I think I've got things on that computer
[43:36] back there but to see how that this this
[43:39] lamp this candlestick and you find it
[43:41] all the way through the scriptures here
[43:43] over and over where God will call it the
[43:46] candlestick and his lamps he'll refer to
[43:49] it over and over
[43:50] because you cannot form the branches
[43:53] first it's got to be the candlestick is
[43:56] form first and then out of the
[43:58] candlestick will come the branches how
[44:02] does that will come the knobs out of
[44:04] that will come to flowers showing that
[44:06] the that which is truly of that heavenly
[44:10] origin it must come forth from Jesus
[44:14] Christ so when we look at this we we
[44:17] find that how that it's the branches
[44:19] that come out of the candlestick
[44:21] he wasn't seven branches but it's six
[44:23] branches and remember it was six
[44:25] measures of flower that that Boaz gave
[44:28] Ruth it's church ages of how that God
[44:31] would manifest himself in the seven
[44:34] church age as he would give that of the
[44:36] six branches coming out and you know I
[44:39] think the things of how brother vine
[44:41] will say when he opened the six seals
[44:43] and you see that seven seal was on earth
[44:45] and the six seals were taken off it was
[44:48] Christ who was here them the mighty God
[44:51] who came down among us the same Living
[44:54] God to reveal himself what was not an
[44:58] earthly pattern but a heavenly pattern
[45:00] and when I look at this I I look back in
[45:05] these things and you see of how that
[45:07] these branches were to come out of his
[45:09] side and and I look at how that when
[45:12] when these branches the scriptures are
[45:15] clear that when he himself was offered
[45:18] up his side was hoping when his side was
[45:22] open what was released was the elements
[45:25] to make up his church so it had to be
[45:28] with the candlestick and then the
[45:30] branches that wood would come out of
[45:32] there but this candlestick was not
[45:34] something that was just just just laying
[45:39] here in the earth but we recognize that
[45:41] the scripture could say of how that it
[45:44] was Adam who was first formed and then
[45:46] he was formed to recognize that here God
[45:50] had had him upon the earth but when he
[45:52] put Adam to sleep he opened up the side
[45:55] of Adam and he brought out of that
[45:58] that rib and then God began to multiply
[46:00] and then that same life that was there
[46:03] with an Adam God was able to to
[46:06] subdivide that in place that same life
[46:09] that was original right there inside of
[46:12] Adam's bride she was given to him for
[46:15] the purpose that he might reproduce
[46:17] himself our intention was never God's
[46:22] never intended for Christianity to be a
[46:25] reproduction or an impersonation of
[46:28] another man but the God's only desire is
[46:32] that his life would be reproduced within
[46:35] his children he never wanted us to be a
[46:39] bunch of carbon copies
[46:41] god never wanted us to act like one
[46:43] another get God himself desired and it
[46:46] all through and by his predestinated
[46:49] plan is that you and I would be
[46:51] conformed we would be fashioned we would
[46:54] be shaped unto the very image of his son
[46:59] it's God's desire it's God's work it's
[47:02] God's achieving them let me just tell
[47:05] you where you're at tonight it's not
[47:06] your achievement it's not your working
[47:09] but it is his achievement through our
[47:11] submission even for us to submit it
[47:14] takes his grace to move on the scene and
[47:18] begin to condition us to where we are at
[47:21] rest to allow him to have his way and I
[47:25] think of this of how that when we look
[47:28] at it that the candlestick itself being
[47:31] that of the focus and how that the Bible
[47:34] would go on in numbers eight four it
[47:36] would refer back to this again and say
[47:38] this work of the candlestick was of
[47:40] beaten gold unto the shaft thereof under
[47:45] the flowers thereof was beaten war this
[47:47] was not something that could be pieced
[47:49] together this was not of a puzzle that
[47:53] would be put together you could not make
[47:55] that of of the branches and then attach
[47:58] the branches no sir the branches must be
[48:01] born out of a candlestick the branches
[48:05] must come out of there this is not an
[48:06] assembly of parts like a factory where
[48:09] you have a candlestick
[48:10] coming down and then you have branches
[48:12] here and we're assembling branches no
[48:13] the Bible is very clear when God gave -
[48:17] even from this to the cherubims but as
[48:20] we focus on this tonight God let it be
[48:22] known it's to be a pure gold of one
[48:25] Beaton work this is not to be divided
[48:30] into all these little parts where
[48:32] everything is so segregated no sir it
[48:35] shows that the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:38] as it moves down upon the believer it
[48:41] brings you an eye into that same body
[48:44] where you and I are made partakers of
[48:46] that same life but fell there in the
[48:49] very beginning you and I are partakers
[48:52] and a part of that body that God Himself
[48:55] has been building down through seven
[48:58] ages we are a part of that body we are
[49:00] not separate from that body but we are a
[49:03] part of it and they'd live their part
[49:05] they live their message they submitted
[49:08] to that and you and I the scripture says
[49:11] that their God having provided some
[49:13] better thing for us that they without us
[49:16] should not be made perfect hallelujah so
[49:23] when we see this it's a beaten work a
[49:26] beaten work it was not this this gold
[49:30] think about this gold this gold that
[49:32] came out of Egypt it was already gold
[49:35] you know the gold itself had been taken
[49:38] and mined from the earth but the gold it
[49:42] still was something that it was not in
[49:45] the form that it needed to be in that
[49:48] gold still had to be melted down member
[49:50] when Aaron he told him you know Aaron he
[49:52] told him take your earrings off man you
[49:54] know place them here and and how that
[49:56] you know they melted down the earrings
[49:58] of gold and then they begin to they form
[50:01] that golden that golden calf you're
[50:03] gonna really see that it still had to be
[50:05] melted down and we looked at within this
[50:09] gold of how that this gold was set forth
[50:11] you know and you think about how that
[50:13] God Himself coming down and becoming one
[50:17] of us God came down all my may we never
[50:20] get tired of this because this is our
[50:22] Redemption store
[50:23] that God Himself came down and he could
[50:27] have taken something of a great splendor
[50:30] the Bible says he took a form of a
[50:32] servant he made himself of no reputation
[50:34] let me tell you something tonight
[50:36] you and I didn't have a choice through
[50:38] the way that you and I came into this
[50:40] world we didn't have a choice
[50:43] with weaknesses that would be about us
[50:45] we did have that choice matter of fact
[50:48] as we go on in life sometimes weaknesses
[50:51] themselves make themselves known and
[50:53] they begin to stand out the more that
[50:55] God has the right away in our life the
[50:57] more weaknesses stand out in our life I
[50:59] want you to think about this he who was
[51:02] rich became poor the Bible said he was
[51:06] the Calvary not in power in weakness he
[51:08] was crucified you see he can't chose to
[51:12] come down and take a body the Bible said
[51:15] it behooves him to be made like unto his
[51:19] brethren he came down and lived in a
[51:24] body and that body itself though it was
[51:27] virgin born but remember it aged it
[51:31] could get sick he could feel temptation
[51:34] he could feel all of the pressures that
[51:37] you and I feel and he did feel them he
[51:41] did experience frustration come on now
[51:44] all of these things what was this God
[51:48] so subjected himself to be able to so
[51:53] that you and I could look and see my the
[51:56] way that same life what he has done that
[52:00] same God can manifest that same life
[52:03] through me how hard would it have been
[52:07] if you'd have looked at somebody who
[52:09] didn't have no faults he didn't want no
[52:12] fault in him listen to me now but how
[52:14] would it have been if there was one they
[52:16] never experienced what it was like to be
[52:18] sick didn't know what it was like to be
[52:21] tempted didn't know what it was like to
[52:23] have war and contend with himself come
[52:26] on somebody then how could he look at
[52:29] you and say be of good cheer for I've
[52:31] overcome you could say overcome what did
[52:34] you overcome
[52:36] you had no battles but God himself so
[52:40] came down and become one of us it
[52:46] behooves him to be made like unto his
[52:50] brethren oh ma look at this
[52:53] in John 15 the Bible says I am The True
[52:57] Vine and my father is the husbandman
[53:02] he's that True Vine there was not a true
[53:06] vine upon the earth but here the very
[53:10] root of the vine how that God Himself
[53:14] had already prophesied I'm gonna plant a
[53:16] vine and here is declaring I am that
[53:20] true vine you know what he's saying I am
[53:21] that candlestick and my father is the
[53:25] husbandman every branch in me that
[53:28] beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and
[53:31] every branch that beareth fruit he
[53:33] purges it that it may bring forth more
[53:36] fruit now you are clean through the word
[53:39] which I've spoken unto you abide in me
[53:42] and I in you as the branch cannot bear
[53:45] fruit of itself except it abide in the
[53:47] vine no more can ye except ye abide in
[53:51] me who's speaking here the candlestick
[53:56] you are the branches I am the vine
[54:00] except you invited me you cannot bear
[54:03] any fruit I am the vine verse 5 ye are
[54:08] the branches
[54:09] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[54:11] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[54:14] without me ye can do nothing out of that
[54:20] candlestick came these six branches out
[54:23] of a vine comes the branches because the
[54:26] vine itself is the source of life the
[54:29] branches are not the source of life the
[54:31] branches themselves are only channels
[54:34] whereby that the very life of the vine
[54:37] might manifest itself through and this
[54:41] is what God he requires he desires for
[54:44] every life for every one of us is just
[54:47] to be a channel
[54:48] just to be a branch that his life can
[54:52] flow through i'm the vine ye are the
[54:56] branches out so he's already he's
[54:58] letting it be known here I am that
[55:00] candlestick now think of this here in
[55:03] verse six he says if Europe man abide
[55:06] not in me he is cast forth as a branch
[55:09] and is withered and men gather them and
[55:12] cast them into the fire and they are
[55:14] burned so if a man doesn't abide in him
[55:19] a man can a person can come can come
[55:21] around him but in order to abide in him
[55:24] you have to be born in him you can come
[55:28] around him and experience much of the of
[55:31] the life the life working the life
[55:33] conditioning but you must be born in him
[55:36] in order to abide in him if you abide in
[55:41] me and my words abide in you ye shall
[55:46] ask what you will and it shall be done
[55:48] unto you think of this my worms he he's
[55:51] not just talking about letters or for
[55:54] just words that are just wrote out but
[55:56] he's speaking of this word is is Rhema
[55:59] which is that word that God himself has
[56:02] spoken personally to your heart if ye
[56:07] abide in me and what my words that which
[56:10] I have spoken to you might say well that
[56:12] that came to me with you were
[56:14] ministering her but this brother was
[56:16] minister but it wasn't me it wasn't the
[56:18] minister come on friends it was God
[56:21] speaking personally to you God has
[56:27] instruments God has channels but the
[56:29] instrument and the channel is just that
[56:32] no more the glory itself belongs to God
[56:36] oh my if ye abide in me and my words
[56:41] abide in you you should I'll ask what
[56:43] you will and it shall be done unto you
[56:45] herein is my father glorified that you
[56:49] bear much fruit so shall you be my
[56:52] disciples don't you want to bear fruit
[56:56] don't you want to reflect him the Rebbe
[57:01] says it like this in the Patmos vision
[57:02] he goes into this he says he is the main
[57:05] vine that which comes out of the
[57:08] original root from the original seed
[57:10] that has the life in it now that vine
[57:13] does not bear fruit
[57:15] it is the branches that do that amen the
[57:20] vine doesn't but the branches do it if
[57:23] all you have is a vine divine can't bear
[57:25] fruit of itself but it must have
[57:29] branches amen
[57:32] they says you can take a citrus tree and
[57:35] we're familiar with this such as an
[57:36] orange tree and graft into a grapefruit
[57:38] limb a lemon limb a tangelo limb and
[57:41] other kinds of that variety and all
[57:43] those limbs will grow but those grafted
[57:47] limbs will not bear oranges no sir the
[57:51] lemon the lemon limb will bear lemons
[57:54] and the grapefruit limb will bear
[57:56] grapefruit and so on yet those limbs
[57:58] will be thriving off the life in the
[58:01] tree so the branches themselves that if
[58:05] the vine is an orange tree but it is of
[58:08] the citrus variety it can be grafted
[58:11] into the vine but yet it will never bear
[58:15] the true image of the vine it will give
[58:20] evidence that there is life flowing
[58:22] there remember as brother M tells us
[58:24] here what a person could say well I know
[58:26] I've been born of the Holy Ghost because
[58:27] I speak in tongues program says that is
[58:30] an evidence of the Holy Ghost being
[58:31] there but it's not an evidence that
[58:34] you've been born again they're right
[58:37] it's it's not the evidence of the new
[58:40] birth the evidence of the new birth is
[58:43] to bear the fruit of the vine it's to
[58:48] bear his image Oh glory
[58:52] this was his desire he couldn't just
[58:55] demand this of you and I because you and
[58:58] I could not produce this we could not
[59:00] produce this life you say well what we a
[59:02] seed of God we were we are seeds of God
[59:05] but we
[59:06] could not produce this life you and I
[59:08] were in a situation we could not help
[59:11] ourselves or get ourselves out of we
[59:14] needed one to come down from glory who
[59:17] was greater than ourselves we needed the
[59:19] true vine because all of these other
[59:22] trees that we were born other we born of
[59:25] this tree we reflected this tree we
[59:28] reflected all these things all of these
[59:30] strains and everything from the natural
[59:32] tree but there was by virtue of
[59:35] predestination there was a seed of God
[59:38] when you drop from your mama's womb when
[59:41] you took that breath of life there was a
[59:43] seed that in her right there it was
[59:45] ordained to inhabit that body and here
[59:47] God in himself coming down and made a
[59:50] way that you and I might come in to this
[59:54] tree of life but remember before you
[59:59] ever get branches you got to get the
[1:00:01] candlestick you don't make the branches
[1:00:04] first God never made the church first
[1:00:08] and then now who we the Savior the
[1:00:11] Redeemer comes no it's the lamb first
[1:00:15] it's the candlestick first it's him
[1:00:19] first in everything in our life it's him
[1:00:22] first everything in our life it's not
[1:00:24] let's get our life in order
[1:00:25] we'll get this together we'll get this
[1:00:27] together and then we'll really
[1:00:28] consecrate to God wrong order bill order
[1:00:31] is the candlestick first and then all
[1:00:33] the branches that so come out of your
[1:00:36] life everything that God has intended
[1:00:38] for you to do if you'll just submit to
[1:00:41] him put him first then you'll watch how
[1:00:43] God will blossom the testimony out of
[1:00:46] your life you won't have to struggle to
[1:00:48] be an overcomer if you only let the
[1:00:51] candlestick be the first and foremost
[1:00:53] part of your life but if you don't let
[1:00:57] the candlestick Christ the vine be the
[1:00:59] center most part of your life you'll
[1:01:01] struggle to bring forth fruit because
[1:01:04] you're trying to do it but remember it
[1:01:07] has to be the divine energy of Christ
[1:01:10] Himself the true vine moving through
[1:01:13] branches that are born in him Omaha
[1:01:17] let's go on and read this he said if
[1:01:19] that true
[1:01:20] true that that tree ever puts forth
[1:01:23] another branch of itself it will be an
[1:01:26] orange branch and bear launches because
[1:01:29] the life in the limb and the life in the
[1:01:33] trunk are identical whereas it wasn't so
[1:01:37] with the grafted limbs those grafted
[1:01:40] branches had their sources in other
[1:01:43] kinds of life from other trees from
[1:01:47] other roots from other seeds oh they
[1:01:49] bear fruit all right but they won't bear
[1:01:51] oranges they cannot because they are not
[1:01:53] of the original and Brisbane goes
[1:01:55] through in that next paragraph and he
[1:01:57] talks about how that's the way the
[1:01:58] church is the vine has been split and
[1:02:01] limbs have been grafted in and he talks
[1:02:04] about the denominational seeds but in
[1:02:06] the next paragraph he says if the vine
[1:02:08] ever brings forth another branch of
[1:02:10] itself and we know this statement is so
[1:02:14] common to us around the message but do
[1:02:16] you see that it has to be the vine bring
[1:02:19] forth another branch brother sister this
[1:02:23] ain't something in the future I'm
[1:02:25] looking at that branch tonight I'm
[1:02:27] looking at a part of that branch that
[1:02:30] the vine himself has put forth this has
[1:02:32] not been a branch that's been formed by
[1:02:34] man
[1:02:35] it's not been a branch that's been
[1:02:37] birthed by the head this is a branch
[1:02:39] that has been birthed by the Word of God
[1:02:42] in this hour the Spirit of God has moved
[1:02:45] down and through that word has brought
[1:02:47] forth that branch that was already here
[1:02:50] but it brought it forth and birthed it
[1:02:53] if the vine ever brings forth another
[1:02:56] branch of itself that branch will be
[1:02:59] exactly like the vine itself exactly
[1:03:06] it'll be able to take all the life in it
[1:03:10] this this vine doesn't have to cut
[1:03:12] corners this branch doesn't is not
[1:03:16] something that singled out but the
[1:03:17] branch itself is able to fully manifest
[1:03:20] and say amen to every promise of God
[1:03:23] it's able to say amen to the word when
[1:03:26] the word comes by and even though we can
[1:03:28] look at our lives and say I don't see
[1:03:30] that yet but I want
[1:03:31] see that Lord in me we can say amen to
[1:03:34] the word what are we saying so be it in
[1:03:37] my life we are putting ourselves as
[1:03:39] branches we are identifying ourselves to
[1:03:43] the vine with provide I am a branch of
[1:03:46] the vine the vine that is speaking
[1:03:49] behind that is declaring itself I am a
[1:03:52] branch of that time oh my it will be the
[1:03:58] same kind of a branch that was brought
[1:04:01] forth at Pentecost hallelujah it will
[1:04:06] speak in tongues you know prophesy it'll
[1:04:10] have the power and signs of the
[1:04:12] resurrected Jesus Christ in it you agree
[1:04:15] with that and this will also bring that
[1:04:18] forth the same power there was a
[1:04:19] Pentecost it's also able to stand tests
[1:04:22] and trials if they can't stand tests and
[1:04:25] trials it's not the same branch come
[1:04:29] friends it was in every day in the book
[1:04:32] of Acts if there was a miracle taking
[1:04:34] place no sir
[1:04:36] as a matter of fact you even read where
[1:04:39] you speak of how that here they were
[1:04:41] when Peter was in prison the whole
[1:04:43] church is gathered around praying and
[1:04:45] then here you know when the little
[1:04:46] damsel comes to the door and she begins
[1:04:48] to answer the door she closes the door
[1:04:50] and goes tells arrest him and praying
[1:04:51] and the rest of them said you've got to
[1:04:54] be crazy
[1:04:54] it ain't Peter out there it's his angel
[1:04:56] what were you praying for it showed
[1:05:00] their humanity their humanity was still
[1:05:04] there they were praying they were
[1:05:07] believing God but it showed that there
[1:05:10] was something greater than just their
[1:05:12] abilities or their focus but there was a
[1:05:15] part within them that God had been able
[1:05:18] to so contact and they moving in that
[1:05:21] path klog desired to spare Peters life
[1:05:24] drug desired to show and manifest
[1:05:26] himself and here it all comes together
[1:05:28] for his glory and yet God still allows
[1:05:31] their humanity to be shown don't raise
[1:05:34] your hands but how many of you and God's
[1:05:36] answered a prayer that you've had it you
[1:05:38] can't believe it why huh
[1:05:41] lord have mercy let me go over and look
[1:05:43] at it again oh dear God I just
[1:05:45] and believe it why you're still human
[1:05:52] but God takes the weakness of our
[1:05:56] humanity to display his greatness you
[1:06:01] see his beating his shaping his molding
[1:06:05] was not of the same manner that our our
[1:06:09] beating and molding and shaping comes
[1:06:12] our beating and molding and shaping
[1:06:15] comes because there's a lot of volcanic
[1:06:17] ash that's packed into us there's a lot
[1:06:20] of things we've as brother brems says
[1:06:22] accumulated over the time he says in
[1:06:25] another place how can I overcome a lot
[1:06:26] of dirt is packed into us packed into
[1:06:31] you they didn't mean that it was just
[1:06:34] scattered there's a lot of dirt that was
[1:06:36] packed into you there's a lot of things
[1:06:38] that have been packed into our life
[1:06:40] hurts and everything else come on now
[1:06:45] that we didn't ask to be packed into us
[1:06:47] it's kind of like Mama's sending you out
[1:06:49] you know on a 60-degree day and she
[1:06:51] feels like it's ice freezing it's
[1:06:53] freezing out there
[1:06:53] you need to bundle up and you go out
[1:06:55] there your lord have mercy it's burning
[1:06:57] up oh why is all of this sock hat and
[1:06:59] everything else on me God knows exactly
[1:07:05] what he's doing and notice how brother
[1:07:08] Brent brings us down he says because
[1:07:09] it's thriving
[1:07:11] on the natural resources of the vine
[1:07:13] itself you see it wasn't grafted into
[1:07:16] the vine it was born in the vine it's
[1:07:21] not something that was added to it but
[1:07:23] it's of one beaten work it's a one solid
[1:07:28] piece oh my oh my
[1:07:32] Bladon going down there brother Brian a
[1:07:34] couple paragraphs he says notice he says
[1:07:37] if they had been born of it that same
[1:07:40] life that was in the original stem Jesus
[1:07:43] would come through them and manifest
[1:07:45] through them verily verily I say unto
[1:07:47] you he that believeth on me the works
[1:07:49] that I do shall he do also and greater
[1:07:51] works than these shall he do because I
[1:07:53] go unto my father now look
[1:07:58] this display the display of these
[1:08:01] branches that are born out of the vine
[1:08:07] already astir ordained that the life of
[1:08:12] a vine might express itself let's go
[1:08:16] over to zechariah chapter 4 here i'm
[1:08:19] just trying to just follow him here
[1:08:21] zechariah here Zechariah 4:1 and the
[1:08:26] angel the bible says the angel that
[1:08:27] talked with me came again and he waked
[1:08:30] me as a man that is wakened out of his
[1:08:32] sleep and he said unto me what see us
[1:08:35] now and i said i have looked and behold
[1:08:38] a candlestick all of gold not
[1:08:44] candlesticks a candle stick of gold with
[1:08:49] a bowl upon the top of them you can't
[1:08:53] put the oil down here in the bottom you
[1:08:55] put the oil that comes from on high the
[1:08:57] oil gets poured down and his seven lamps
[1:09:02] thereon and seven pipes to the seven
[1:09:05] lamps which are up on the top thereof
[1:09:07] and two olive trees by one upon the
[1:09:10] right side of the bowl and the other
[1:09:11] upon the left side thereof so I answered
[1:09:14] and I spake to the angel that talked
[1:09:16] with me saying what are these my lord
[1:09:18] then the angel that talked with me
[1:09:21] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[1:09:23] not what these be I said no my lord then
[1:09:30] he answered and he spake unto me saying
[1:09:32] this is the word of the Lord unto
[1:09:34] Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by
[1:09:37] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[1:09:40] hosts who art Thou O great mountain
[1:09:43] before zerubabbel thou shalt become a
[1:09:45] plain and he shall bring forth the
[1:09:48] headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[1:09:50] grace grace unto it we know that
[1:09:54] scriptures have compound meanings is
[1:09:56] that right we recognize that these two
[1:09:59] trees that are standing by Old Testament
[1:10:01] and New Testament and yet at the latter
[1:10:03] part of this scripture you know it's
[1:10:06] fixed these two are anointed of the Lord
[1:10:08] and brother
[1:10:08] you play some also has those two
[1:10:11] witnesses that are going to come there
[1:10:14] in in among Israel and call out that
[1:10:16] 144,000 and you look at how that it's so
[1:10:19] closely identified here in Zechariah 4
[1:10:22] this is a vision of God's Redemption it
[1:10:26] speaks of how that God himself coming
[1:10:29] down and then through the imparting of
[1:10:31] his life God is going to take a people
[1:10:33] for his namesake and through that same
[1:10:36] life God Himself will move right over
[1:10:39] and upon that Moses and Elijah he will
[1:10:43] call out 144,000 out of that out of the
[1:10:47] nation of Israel and they will call them
[1:10:49] out by the same gospel message and they
[1:10:52] will be baptized with the same Holy
[1:10:55] Ghost it's all part of it you see he
[1:10:59] paid the price for all is that right he
[1:11:02] came down and he paid the price for all
[1:11:05] but in paying the price for all remember
[1:11:07] his whole purpose in coming was to
[1:11:10] redeem the elect but he paid the price
[1:11:13] and there are others who can be saved
[1:11:17] and and they can no salvation but God is
[1:11:19] so separated to where there's a depth of
[1:11:22] redemption and that is reserved for the
[1:11:25] elect alone I think God for salvation
[1:11:31] amen
[1:11:33] I think God for souls even though they
[1:11:35] may not see the light that we see but
[1:11:38] you know you never know that you just
[1:11:39] have to let it you just have to let God
[1:11:41] Himself work because let me tell you
[1:11:43] something friends just because somebody
[1:11:45] comes to a message church and said they
[1:11:46] believe brother branham's a prophet and
[1:11:48] everything else doesn't mean they're
[1:11:49] walking in the light either you see it's
[1:11:54] got to walk fully by life that's fully
[1:11:56] dedicated to the Lord it takes a life
[1:11:59] that's fully been born of the vine and
[1:12:02] where it is the very life of Christ
[1:12:06] that's being reflected through their
[1:12:08] life this is not about Association here
[1:12:10] is not enough to be associated around
[1:12:12] this message you've got to be born out
[1:12:15] the Holy Ghost it's got to be a branch
[1:12:19] that comes out of the candlestick
[1:12:21] it's gotta be a a fresh experience it's
[1:12:25] gonna be a new birth it takes the work
[1:12:27] of the Holy Ghost coming down and this
[1:12:30] whole work is a beaten work it takes God
[1:12:33] coming down and God moving and
[1:12:35] separating all the dirt and the sludge
[1:12:38] and all the gum and all the yuck and all
[1:12:40] the malice and everything else from
[1:12:42] around our life why be why is he doing
[1:12:45] that because he knows beneath the dirt
[1:12:48] and beneath the sludge beneath all that
[1:12:50] there's gold there and he's pulling that
[1:12:53] gold out of the earth he knows that gold
[1:12:56] that leaves in her life and he's working
[1:12:59] he's shaping he's molding for what
[1:13:02] purpose a beaten work to display light
[1:13:07] to display light oh my brother branham
[1:13:14] he says it like this he says that what
[1:13:16] God was telling Zachariah here when he
[1:13:18] said not by might not by power but by my
[1:13:22] spirit saith the Lord of Hosts now by
[1:13:31] might not by power you know God brings
[1:13:33] you and I into places in our lives where
[1:13:38] we get to test our might we can test our
[1:13:42] power and God lets us test the might
[1:13:47] lets us test our power and we realize we
[1:13:51] can't do nothing but I'm a branch but
[1:13:55] without me you can do nothing now I
[1:14:01] really have a good understanding about
[1:14:07] power
[1:14:08] you see power isn't just something
[1:14:11] supernatural sometimes it can be by
[1:14:13] knowledge power it's not by power not by
[1:14:18] might but by his Spirit is God declaring
[1:14:24] right here
[1:14:25] when Zachariah is asking him the angel
[1:14:27] said what is this and Zacharias said I
[1:14:30] don't know what it is you tell me what
[1:14:32] it is because as a prophet I can see
[1:14:35] cymbals but I need somebody to interpret
[1:14:36] it for me is that right and I need to
[1:14:40] know what is this this is what you're
[1:14:42] showing me he shows him this candlestick
[1:14:44] now you and I we could look at this
[1:14:46] candlestick and say well that's just
[1:14:48] something to give life why would God
[1:14:50] show this and why would God declare that
[1:14:52] this candlestick this candelabra the
[1:14:54] candlestick with the six branches there
[1:14:57] the seven lamps why would God say that
[1:14:59] because the church would be living of
[1:15:03] the power of God the Spirit of God not
[1:15:07] by might not by power every age every
[1:15:10] age there has been those who have just
[1:15:14] regarded their might and the power
[1:15:17] intellectually to try to produce and
[1:15:20] live out but you cannot produce it
[1:15:22] listen friends the producing of this
[1:15:24] message is not knowing every quote you
[1:15:28] can know every single letter that
[1:15:30] doesn't mean anything to God you can
[1:15:33] know he said this here and set that
[1:15:34] there there's things are no doubt than
[1:15:36] many of us here I could quote it the way
[1:15:38] brother Ram quotes it I could say it the
[1:15:40] way says it with the Paul's just from
[1:15:42] listening to the tapes many times and
[1:15:44] poring over things but that is not what
[1:15:46] it is it must be that life living and
[1:15:51] pulsating on the inside and the greatest
[1:15:54] desire that we would have as branches is
[1:15:57] God let me lose my identity that the
[1:16:01] identity of the vine might be made
[1:16:04] manifest in me he didn't even have her
[1:16:07] own name when she came out of that and
[1:16:09] the Bible said that he called their name
[1:16:11] Adam in the day they were formed they
[1:16:16] men she had cheated off her identity was
[1:16:19] hidden within Adam and that's the same
[1:16:21] way but for the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:24] our identity is hidden in him our
[1:16:27] identity is not in a church I'm gonna
[1:16:33] say it it's not enough just to be
[1:16:35] identified around this message you've
[1:16:37] got to be identified with Jesus Christ
[1:16:40] that is the real revelation of this
[1:16:43] message is Jesus Christ
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:47] hallelujah there were many listen I I
[1:16:50] quoted this to your month ago there are
[1:16:52] people yet in the world tonight who
[1:16:55] still hang right around the River Jordan
[1:16:58] they've never moved from the River
[1:17:00] Jordan not just spiritually there's
[1:17:02] people who hang right around that River
[1:17:04] and you ask who are they they say we're
[1:17:08] followers of John you know if they miss
[1:17:11] they miss Christ there's people who can
[1:17:15] follow brother random and they miss
[1:17:17] Christ they don't recognize Jesus Christ
[1:17:21] they want to take the natural voice of a
[1:17:24] man and make that the voice of God that
[1:17:26] natural voice is not the voice of God
[1:17:28] the voice of God spoke through that
[1:17:30] earthly voice to you and I they men the
[1:17:35] voice of Jesus Christ that spoke through
[1:17:38] that earthly messenger to you and I if
[1:17:41] we can't recognize that then we can't
[1:17:43] recognize called still speaking but he
[1:17:47] still speaking that voice is still
[1:17:49] speaking that same Holy Ghost is here
[1:17:52] tonight still speaking that same word
[1:17:55] that has been broke upon this generation
[1:17:57] let me tell you something when the
[1:18:00] anointing falls it will not produce
[1:18:02] another golden calf trying to take us
[1:18:04] back to an Old Testament form a
[1:18:07] priesthood but when the real inspiration
[1:18:09] drops it brings us into the real
[1:18:12] priesthood of our milk asset if the Lord
[1:18:15] Jesus Christ where we find our true
[1:18:17] identity glory be to God in the highest
[1:18:25] hallelujah we are branches to bear
[1:18:29] images of Christ notice how John says
[1:18:34] this here in John in Revelations 1 verse
[1:18:38] 9 let me just try to get somewhere here
[1:18:44] here you find in Revelations 1 verse 9
[1:18:51] my John let's you know he said I'm your
[1:18:54] brother
[1:18:56] I'm your companion in tribulation but he
[1:19:02] don't focus on the tribulation look what
[1:19:06] happens to John he knows why he's there
[1:19:10] it's not a comfortable position it's not
[1:19:13] a comfortable place where he's at but he
[1:19:17] only lets you know I am your brother and
[1:19:19] fellow companion in tribulation but even
[1:19:24] in this we see of how that the
[1:19:26] revelations so breaking around John's
[1:19:28] life you don't ever read anything else
[1:19:32] in the Book of Revelations where John
[1:19:34] himself would mention about his
[1:19:37] tribulation say lord help me I'm raising
[1:19:46] my hand for all of them Lord all that
[1:19:50] because sometimes we can't even make it
[1:19:52] in the whole chapter we're ending one
[1:19:54] chapter my tribulation John took one
[1:20:00] verse out of 22 chapters we take 22
[1:20:06] chapters in one verse we glory but I
[1:20:12] believe God's bringing us there I
[1:20:15] believe that with all my heart he is
[1:20:17] bringing us there he's teaching us
[1:20:19] friends these things are not something
[1:20:20] it's just handed to you but God Himself
[1:20:23] is working in our life you know the
[1:20:25] whole thing of it is the whole secret of
[1:20:26] it is he's teaching us to trust him
[1:20:28] that's the whole thing oh brother Samuel
[1:20:31] that's easy really is it isn't it that's
[1:20:34] his whole working that's what he's been
[1:20:36] working even since he called you since
[1:20:39] he sanctified you since you field since
[1:20:41] he filled you with the Holy Ghost he's
[1:20:43] still working on you to trust him
[1:20:46] completely but don't worry
[1:20:49] Abraham we're headed to our final
[1:20:50] mountain he's bringing us there amen
[1:20:56] he's faithful here here John he turns
[1:20:59] around and you notice to see how that
[1:21:02] God bringing this lie
[1:21:04] to you and I because there's got to be a
[1:21:07] way to bring this life to us let me just
[1:21:08] bring it down here like this tonight
[1:21:10] there had to be a way now when we look
[1:21:13] at this as we look at this candlestick
[1:21:15] it had to be that of a work that was
[1:21:18] formed that was shaped there had to be a
[1:21:21] way that was made in order to bring this
[1:21:25] forth so it had to be God Himself coming
[1:21:29] down his only life being given for you
[1:21:36] and I the scripture says it like this in
[1:21:39] verse 13 of Revelations 1 that when John
[1:21:42] had turned to see the voice that was
[1:21:45] speaking unto him how long how brother
[1:21:49] brems rawls this here he says John did
[1:21:51] not turn around to see it didn't say I
[1:21:54] turned to see who he said I turned to
[1:21:57] see the voice you see he did not john
[1:22:01] identified the voice that was speaking
[1:22:03] to him the voice that was speaking to
[1:22:06] him had something for him so when he
[1:22:09] turned to see the voice and the voice
[1:22:11] that spake to me what he beheld was
[1:22:15] Jesus Christ what he beheld was the word
[1:22:22] well we could preach here a long time
[1:22:25] you see how God lets you know where you
[1:22:28] belong he speaks to you and feed you so
[1:22:34] you don't have to wonder where you
[1:22:37] belong you understand me now then you
[1:22:42] know God need we understand we have all
[1:22:44] of these parts about you pray over what
[1:22:45] church you're gonna go through
[1:22:46] absolutely you look for those things you
[1:22:48] pray over that you absolutely should and
[1:22:51] God has a way of making things known I
[1:22:59] believe that has to be God that has to
[1:23:03] be God amen
[1:23:05] it can't be a man verse 13 here and in
[1:23:09] the midst of the seven candlesticks one
[1:23:12] like unto the Son of Man clothed with a
[1:23:15] garment down to the foot and girl
[1:23:17] about the paps with a golden girdle his
[1:23:20] head and his hairs were white like wool
[1:23:22] as white as snow and his eyes were as
[1:23:24] where's the flame of fire and his feet
[1:23:26] like unto fine brass as if they had
[1:23:30] burned in a furnace and his voice is the
[1:23:33] sound of many waters in order for this
[1:23:39] work to come forth he had to come down
[1:23:43] and he had to pay the price he had to
[1:23:49] tread the winepress the Bible says in
[1:23:53] Isaiah 63 alone his garments dyed red
[1:23:59] when he tread the winepress it was him
[1:24:03] and him alone there was nothing there to
[1:24:07] help him as a matter of fact the prophet
[1:24:09] said within that time even the earth
[1:24:11] itself the moon and the rest refused to
[1:24:14] shine he died paid the price that this
[1:24:22] life this oil might come to you and I he
[1:24:30] paid the price for us look at the Bible
[1:24:33] says it like this as it comes down it
[1:24:36] speaks of how that here even in the very
[1:24:39] latter part of it it says the seven
[1:24:42] candlesticks in verse 20 which thou
[1:24:44] sawest are the seven churches seven
[1:24:49] candlesticks its Christ Himself the
[1:24:54] candlestick the vine the life and out of
[1:24:58] him comes forth the branches he laid
[1:25:03] down his life like Adam did he laid it
[1:25:10] down that out of his side might come
[1:25:13] forth the elements that wouldn't
[1:25:15] comprise and make up his bride body he
[1:25:20] is the savior of the body the church
[1:25:24] he's the head of the church
[1:25:27] it's his flow of life and energy moving
[1:25:31] down through the church hallelujah
[1:25:36] and how that he himself had declared
[1:25:40] clear back over in the Book of Psalms he
[1:25:44] says I will dwell in the midst of my
[1:25:48] brethren I will declare thy name there's
[1:25:53] only one way that he could come in the
[1:25:56] midst of the church and give his life
[1:25:59] for you and I and that was that he had
[1:26:03] to be willing to give his life that you
[1:26:07] and I might have life so then the life
[1:26:11] that we now live in the flesh we live by
[1:26:15] the faith of the Son of God who loved us
[1:26:19] and gave himself for us
[1:26:21] so who's the focus here is the focus the
[1:26:25] branches or is the focus the candlestick
[1:26:29] Christ
[1:26:30] the focus is Christ if all we see is
[1:26:34] those seven candlesticks we missed it
[1:26:37] but remember in the midst of it one
[1:26:40] likened to the Son of man having his
[1:26:44] paps girded with a golden girdle and the
[1:26:49] brother brand picks it up in 1954 the
[1:26:51] church ages he says notice here he is
[1:26:55] one likened to the Son of Man
[1:26:56] it's Christ himself in the form of his
[1:27:00] church he is walking in the midst of his
[1:27:05] church and in the midst of that church
[1:27:08] here he himself we are a part of that
[1:27:13] beaten work our lives we are now we're
[1:27:18] invited that we might have our lives
[1:27:21] shaped our character molded because now
[1:27:27] once this oil once this life has been
[1:27:30] given now can come forth this church now
[1:27:35] can come forth the oil once the fire has
[1:27:39] come down on the
[1:27:41] and consume the sacrifice now can come
[1:27:46] the oil and can come the fire to light
[1:27:50] the lives of the believer and through
[1:27:55] that grace that is given to us that we
[1:27:58] might be able to reflect his glory every
[1:28:05] test and every trial and everything that
[1:28:09] comes our way
[1:28:10] God has a provided place for you and I
[1:28:15] he has a place of rest for you and I
[1:28:19] where we can rest where we can dwell and
[1:28:23] that's in him I said that's in him we
[1:28:27] can rest there let's bow our heads
[1:28:31] Lord Jesus father just lord within the
[1:28:40] thoughts Lord that just so pressing Lord
[1:28:45] upon my heart I pray that Lord here

[1:29:30] is ourselves your prophet made it made
[1:29:35] these statements in many different ways
[1:29:37] he says we smother you out so we argue
[1:29:42] against many many different statements

[1:29:53] more yielded to you Lord help us Lord
