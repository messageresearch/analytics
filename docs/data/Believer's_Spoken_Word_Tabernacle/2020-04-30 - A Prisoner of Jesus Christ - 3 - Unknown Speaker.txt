and so then for him to be the Lord of all we must surrender all and we continue to let down our word that his will might have first place in our lives I think that's the that's a glorious blessing to have that desire moving and burning in our hearts that our desire would be that his will would be done in our lives that's to be the the whole of every prayer all that we'd say and do that his will would be done in our lives and we just want to once again reach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and want to say thank you for each and every one the different those that are here to man the different stations that we can be able to do this and so we appreciate that service and that being able to be done want to remind you as a congregation if you have not been a part of that you're a part of this congregation because that's all that it's for on our Tuesday night a chat that I have you'll want to be you'll want to be in tune with that and be watching that and listening carefully also on emails that will be coming out and believe me I can tell whether you read the emails or not depending on the questions that I get I know whether the emails have been read or not so just a little bit of admonition read it if something comes out read it if you think you understand it go back and read it again and make sure that you do see it and understand it so I'm see just in monitoring you stay in step with those things that on Tuesday nights and with the emails because I'm not going to take any time away from Thursday and Sunday but what I'm going to be doing because we're looking at working for a part to resume and coming back and meeting so I've got more and more things to look at people that I have to contact myself and the Deacons to contact different ones and then from there when a decision is reached I want you to be in step with it to here and now means even when we come to that place that's something that I always want you to feel I don't want anyone to feel pressured at all we're just trying to work to come to a date to where it's available to come to the house of God again so please stay with us on that so we just want to take our attention here our hearts and go right into the word of the Lord tonight and we want to look here in the scriptures and if before we look here in the scriptures once again let's just go to the Lord in a word of Prayer and we just want to ask his leadership here tonight and if you have a need on your heart just make it known to the Lord our Heavenly Father Lord as we just come before you right now we just Oh God just desire to Lord just to submit ourselves and that you would have your way the Lord in our midst we pray that you'll just take control and your God may you just come and just speak to our hearts in a very personal way help me Lord to get out of the way help lower the people Lord for the needs that we would have present in our lives we know that God that you're always on time and that Lord every piece it works together and so we just ask that God that you'll just be here tonight Lord just come and speak to our hearts in a personal way Lord you know our needs and though requested upon the hearts of your children and even as Lord even now as we are looking and we're praying as an assembly that you would just give us the wisdom and the unction and leadership of the Holy Spirit Lord as you have Lord from the beginning and throughout this time we ask that God that you'll just guide and direct us Lord we just want you to receive all glory and honor in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen so as we look here in the book of Philemon and then I want to go right into Philippians once again I just want to encourage you please read the email and if you do have a question of anything throughout there are always you can always contact myself my wife the Deacons the office and we can try to answer the different if there's a question that comes up because we want things to be clear so if anything that we can do to make it clear so let's look here and just I want to read just one verse from Philemon and then I'm gonna move right into the book of Philippians perhaps I'll just let you have your seats after we read this first verse it says Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ may God bless His Word as you're being seated and I want to continue to draw upon this thought of Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ but drawing on that thought and looking at it in in the terms of our own life and our walk as a believer because truly there is a great meaning to what is being expressed here in Paul's life and Paul's not the first prisoner of Jesus Christ but remember it was God coming in Christ we see through the prophets it was shadows and types of how that the Spirit of Christ would speak through them and move through them and he would in their lives they were given they were rugged men that were given to the Lord and in rugged meaning not so much abrasiveness of person but that they stood for the Word of God when the nation or whether even those a friend and foe or whatever they stood for the Word of God it was that something that was in their hearts and lives that was so much more greater than anything around them and it was it was that of which they were yoked to and to see that in in Christ God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself now is to restore back what was lost in Eden and all of those parts coming together we see that of a life that was completely harnessed to the Word of God it was the word that was expressed and so Paul is expressing here not the imprisonment of Rome or those bonds his situation Paul is identifying himself as a prisoner of Jesus Christ it's not the only time he speaks of this but Paul would even in one of the other prison epistles in there in Ephesians Paul would speak of this of being a prisoner and you know the difference within this is that Paul himself he was is this was not one who was being held against his own will but to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ is where we no longer want our own will we desire his will it's where our will has been our objectives and things it's it's Christ and him alone that matters and that's what we this is where as we look into the scripture tonight we want to take as Paul would write write an admonition here in the book of Philippians there are many things that would really would would it be expressed and we I know we could go throughout all the scriptures but there are many things and things that are very pertinent and important to that of a prisoner of Jesus Christ and Paul is writing here if we can break in on this in verse 12 and he's writing to the church at Philippi and he said I would you understand brethren that the things which have happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places and many of the Brethren in the Lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear some indeed now this is where I want us to go some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will the one preached Christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds but the other of love knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth Christ is preached and I therein do rejoice yay and will rejoice now what Paul is dealing with here the Spirit of God here is dealing with this of the motives and objectives that is behind what is actually being preached Paul is not saying in these verses of scripture that what the individuals are preaching is false he's taking it down to what it is that they lie what it is that is actually motivating them to preach Christ so it's going deeper than just what is being heard or what is being what a person can see it's going down into the level of the heart and that's a that's an area that it's not a comfortable area to go into but it's an area that we've got to be deadly sincere and honest and open before God because the journey to the heart is where it requires us of being truthful with ourselves and this is where when we look at this this is something that is a real a real reality of a prisoner of Jesus Christ and I certainly believe with all in my heart that as we grow in the Lord and we should be growing it ought to be something that we can look back from from in our lives and see that by God's grace we have grown from where we were to where we are now or to see there's been growth and what I mean even in that of growth is where we can even see behind us those things that we can look and see God's grace and long-suffering to our lives and now the things that we once were not so sensitive to now we become very sensitive to those things and what I'm talking about is those things that are sensitive to where we are allowing the word to actually examine our heart if the Bible says it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God it's one of the things that when we sit here and we hear the word of the Lord ministered I believe that our objective when we come here whether we're streaming whether when we're listening to a message when we're reading when we're praying I believe it ought to be reversed where we are really allowing God to examine our hearts not just coming and and just serving a purpose or serving a duty or just while I'm gonna pray or I'm gonna listen to a message or I'm just coming to the house of God but really where we are coming with the right objective we're coming with the right motive and that is Lord search my heart and if there's anything in me David was open he said search me Oh God try me you see that even takes to where in our in our putting our heart our lives in his hands try me and see if there be any wicked way in me that's part of even maturity because we begin to recognize more and more as we walk along that even the decisions that we make can have influences and impacts upon other people and so it causes us to be more sensitive not fearful that's not what we're talking it's not to bring anxiousness but it should cause us to further trust in the Lord if we find something in our life and we're looking to God in what to do you ought to be something that we stay in prayer don't try to search it out on the Internet don't try to get everybody's opinion on it take it to the Lord in prayer approach it through the right channels suppose he's dealing with this here this is something that he is focusing on that while he is imprisoned and in bonds you have those that have been emboldened to proclaim the Word of God some are doing that out of Indian strife others are doing it out of love so if we were just looking on the surface level we would say oh my every one of them are just everything's just right on but Paul is putting it this is calls goes to if I can say a deeper level it's very simple but it comes down to the discernment of our motives and objectives this is where in the scripture where it talks of how and Paul would say it in verse 18 notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth so they were preaching truth but not in truth there was truth being preached in truth and truth that was being preached from pretence now pretence is that it's a word it deals with a cloak or to cover something or to try or an actual you know pretense it would come from to pretend it's a pretended cause it has all the outward appearances of something but it's superficial it's not genuine it's not something that's really true and so these are things that when we look at it of how God just to think of it like this when God deals with a heart remember God does not want anyone let me just say it clearly a Christian life is not Sulur serving God out of a slavish fear God doesn't want that what God's desire is is the heart a person remember they went away in the beginning remember how the fall came is where Satan began to talk to Eve and it began to pull and it began to move through the word what's he doing he begins to move her away from the objective and motive that she should have been seated in and that was the will of God and to know that God's will is his word revealed and it brings faith and one of her God has made known we stand upon that word and we wait for further light to be shown we allow that word that has come let it be fully operative and work out the purpose in our life it's not then I know this but let me give myself to this Lord let this word search me out that's why we're for revelation revelation comes that our lives might be searched out remember we must walk in the light as he's in the light there's things that where he can't where God desires to reveal his word and to unfold his word to our lives but it's also what our we doing with what God has revealed in our lives are the word that's coming forth and let's just be clear with this when the word is coming forth there are things that may be in our minds it's not our finite mind that's understanding that's not what revelation is revelation is where when our heart and our life becomes quickened and there it becomes like an openness it becomes like then of a vision it's something that just strikes our heart you have ever had things that sometimes you can hear and say I don't quite see that all the way but I know there's something to that there's things that God is trying to deal with our heart in our life that we would give ourselves to him and allow that word to so work in our life so that there God will continue to reveal more and more and more because in that that revelation it's God moving and revelation itself it's more of the will of God being revealed it's what is the word now being revealed his divine will and so when God begins to draw up on a heart a heart has an objective it has an ambition it'll have a motive but you see God will begin to deal with that heart and maybe you know with the love of the world and everything in their heart but God will begin to deal with that heart and it begins to deal with that where their objective in their ambition it really it man that starts out it really has nothing to do with where anyone else is that has already crossed over into Christ but yet there's got to be a starting point are you with me now it's got to be a starting point and this is why even for a life when God is dealing with the heart on how we ought to dress how we ought to conduct ourselves these are simple things even to the giving of our heart when God says repent when he says be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what's he doing he is not removing the objective or ambition that that person has that person might have an objective and an ambition hey ma'am they're going to be you know this type of thing was the career they're gonna be this type of person they're gonna be that type of person and it may not be that it may be it may not be that God doesn't want them going that direction but what it is is that they've got their own ambition they've got their own objective do you realize that's why brother Branham says it like this when he speaks to a group of young people in the message leadership of 63 in June he says that when you're young you is a little something that gets projected in your mind and it makes you he said it becomes your ambition he said that's why most conversions take place while you're young because usually when people get older they are set in their ways but you see God notice how God works Paul had his ambitions Paul had his objectives but what did God do God drew Paul to a place to where God didn't strip the objectives out of him but him Paul come face-to-face with something that caused him to release every objective that he had Paul had an objective perhaps to be the the high the high priest he had an objective to do this but he met something greater then every ambition that he had and you see God did not pry it out of his hands he simply met the god of the word and that God was drawing on his life that's that's how God works that's how God continues to work through his word upon our lives he doesn't force himself but he draws that life to complete surrender I think these are very fitting points because if God put the first couple the first family on free moral agency and he gave him a choice he cannot come around now and say I'm saving you it's not even your choice he can't do that you know I'm administering these thoughts from the message a prisoner of Jesus Christ this is exactly God can't take away your free moral agency but remember his spirit his life moving through upon that life that is there it draws it to a place to say Lord I choose you so to become a prisoner is to be fully yoked to his word harnessed by his spirit like a local horse that would be harnessed to a wagon you the word is your anchor point the Spirit of God anchors you in the word the decisions you make the reason you made the decisions you made is because of Christ we have all been tested and we all will be tested and tempted within things to be drawn into certain areas the Lord Jesus was and the Bible says that the devil departed from him for a season it's always where is the enemy when a heart has been harnessed yoked by the Spirit of God where is Satan coming to tempt he's coming to tempt on that outer man on those outer realms that we live in very clearly it'd have been no problem at all if when we got the new birth we received our theophany and our glorified body but you see this life coming into your eye these are the proving grounds this is where that his life inside of his sons and daughters of God and make no mistake about it as he was the word we are the word hallelujah it makes proof in this hour that's why Peter said the tests and trials that come our way they're more precious than gold what does it do it's not proving to God you recognize in your life there's a greater whole there's a greater anchor and what is that anchor that it is the love of God in your soul amen it brings us to a place this is where to be harness is to bring us into a real sensitivity for the will of God that's something that as brother branham and I just want to refer to a few places it's all the way through scripts are all the way through the message but brother branham was asked a question many times about - will of God or how do I know to do this or do that and brother Branham would always and all the way through he said this is there's a standard he said that's in my life and the standard that I have he says is to first find out if it's the will of God that's the first thing God will never lead us to do something that's contrary to his word so it's to come back to the word then when we know it is the will of God now it's to test what is our motive and objective in it and that's the very words that the Prophet used to test our motive and objective in it you know what it means to test something sometimes you have to test the strength of it sometimes you have to test what is in it if you're going and you're gonna run an electrical you know how it is I think when some of the brothers were doing some work back in 99 here or 2000 if that's when you did some of the first remodeling they had this somebody had some kind of a figuring out electricity if electricity was alive they had these two wires running around a light bulb it wasn't anything you could buy in Lowe's or Home Depot or the groomers you know I'm talking about I mean I don't know who made that invention but you know what they knew if I put these two wires on either in that box is live you better not touch that box with your hands they knew somebody go back there and kill that breaker so sometimes the testing of the motive and objective it's not just something that's done real quick but sometimes that testing sometimes it is quick and then there's other times where look with look what where it has to be it comes as we're setting under the word and even as we're praying as we're looking to the Lord there's a testing that's going on it's open to the Lord and even this right here even that our lives this is why that in our lives and I and I trusted we're all very much in tune with this we you need milk when you start out as a young as a young Christian there's no baby that is born that starts eating meat no you don't start eating solid foods huh you start out with milk is that right then as you start growing your appetite grows they start doing all these other things you know the cereal and then the mush and then all this other stuff then eventually you start eating what's on the table but it's all comes in transition in stages is that right but so what we find this is why there must be a progression in our lives by the Holy Ghost this is why this is the the unction of the Spirit of God that we would continue to give our hearts and our lives to him this is why we want to move on with God this is why and I'd say this from the love of God in my heart you should not be setting in the same condition that you were even a year ago much less 15 or 10 years ago it would look like a funny thing if you see me and my age walking around with a Gerber milk bottle you would say one thing for sure the guy hadn't grown up he looks grown up here but there's still something wrong you see it is there for growth and growth is not something that we do on our own but listen we've got to give ourselves to the word we've got to be honest with the word as the word is dealing with our lives this is why we're to be sufficient we should be sufficiently impressed with the word that is in our midst it ought to be something we're giving our lives to God don't set in the same condition you've always been in say God changed me take me higher Lord God let me die more to myself God's not gonna force-feed it he wants you and I to cry out and as the diet changes as the diet increases so does the discernment because remember the spirit moves and it takes the word so as the word itself as we feed on the word this is what Paul was dealing with in in Hebrews five as we feed on the word we're taking in on the word then we have our senses exercised to discern good and evil there ought to be things and I'm just speaking very clearly there up to be things right now that ought to be so clearly discernible it ought to be discernible of things you post or you don't post it ought to be discernible of the things you say or you don't say your attitudes your thoughts your actions I'm just speaking very clearly here you might have an excuse if you've only been coming here for a month or two or a year you might have an excuse but if you've been here and you've been around it ignorance is not an excuse because God is here to speak to our lives and to change our lives the person says but suddenly I don't know if I've got the Holy Ghost or not the message will tell you that you you there is a discernment that can come into your life and I can tell you if you have the love for the things of the world if Christ has not been made alive in your life then you need to ask God Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost and in that feeling God prepares you because remember he's the one doing the work he has to prepare your heart so what should I do give your heart to him say Lord remedy everything that's in me that's not right I'm just gonna just speak just just following his spirit here you see when we look at this this is why brother Randall will make a statement in remembering the Lord in 1963 he said we don't receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost for entertainment there's a purpose would you catch what he said he said we don't receive it for entertainment now what's he talking about is that the genuine Holy Spirit can be poured out upon an individual's life maybe there's something that's wrong in their life and they really need the forgiveness of God so what they'll do they look to God and we believe in and asking God for forgiveness but just don't go away feeling a little lighter load but the same God who lifted that load Savior take me on to a full reality that's the right objective that's the right emotive not just to have it to where it comes down and here we are in the service manner then we have a good time man we had a good time and you leave back out leaving Missy living the same kind of life you're not coming to church with the right motive and objective you've got to come to the house of God with the right motive and the right objective the Lord I need more of you I want something from you oh my this is why I just I'm just offered this here this is why that that that the Bible says in the book of Acts when it talks about Simon when they had went down there and they were laying hands on different ones and they were receiving the Holy Ghost Simon saw what was going on and Simon said he'd reached out and gotten money he said hey here now I want you to give me that that same power whoever hands whoever I lay my hands on they'll get the Holy Ghost to remember the discernment of the Holy Spirit in Peters life let me just say this to you was it a good desire to do desire the Holy Ghost absolutely but his motive and objective in wanting it was wrong he wanted it for self gain I don't have to tell you where that originates from that originates from the very one who instigated instigated the fall in heaven and this is what this is where when Peter by the Spirit of God can discern and say you are filled with the goal of bitterness he said I can see what is in your heart you see here he was wanting it for self gain that's why the seeking of the Holy Ghost is not to add to self but that self might be consumed that that's what it is the evidence the seal when the seal has come when the blood has been applied it shows death has come to that house but the death that has come now there is the life of the atonement upon that life and the seal says death has come here and now it is identified with the blood of the Lamb this is why brother Branham told us in the message token he said it's because of these things why that the Holy Ghost isn't given out so much because people have ambitions I want to be this and I want to be that and I want to do that you see this is what you find and this is what Paul is speaking and dealing with is that what is happening there were men out brethren who were preaching it in truth they were preaching it out of love and then there were others what Paul was in bonds supposing to add affliction to his bonds they were preaching it out of envy and strife remember he's not dealing with the content sometimes our content is dead on it's the motives and objectives behind it this is the same thing between husband and wife sometimes your content can be right on but the emotive zand objectives are off may God help us you see this is why that the will of God the motives and objectives it must be tested this is where patience comes in this is where being a prisoner comes in I want to please him you're pulled to go this way Paul was pulled to go many ways he even nearly had the authority to do certain things but he wouldn't do it based on his authority he didn't go based on his authority he waited for the leading of the Lord I think that's very good Paul did not just go and say well I'm a preacher they need somebody to preach I'm just going to preach that's going to how Paul wind he knew brother Ram would say it over and over comes round in Christ the mystery and in Christ the mystery is the harissa it's an unfolding of that seven seal of the coming of the Lord Christ coming in bright form the capping of a bride and what does he keep referring back to a prisoner he said the message appreciated a a prisoner and he's speaking and calling back to that of one who is yoked to that of Christ where Christ is the one who is reflected through that life this is why it's in such simplicity this is why when they came to brother Branham and many of them wanted him and they said my with the gift that you've got with the ministry half why in the world aren't you taking it in to Los Angeles and all these other places these nerve centers brother man clearly brings it forth it's spiritual food and due season he said it's not their food notice the change that took place within the ministry the change within the ministry sure the message was going out but remember when the message begin to open doors started closing is that right doors started closing and now here's here's being tested what's being tested is back here where remember where the Prophet listened to his mother-in-law now he's in another situation the tests didn't go away the test is still present but it's tested will he's planned with this word that's been given when everybody else who's more learned and everything else they're standing against it will he stand on this word that's why the word must be more than a letter it's gotta be that saith the Lord revealed by the Spirit of God then no matter who else is around who else goes this way or who else goes this way you know this is Jesus Christ revealed from word to flesh and in my life I am evident I am proof I am fruit of the ministry that is coming this hour and to see listen to me now as I trying to move this down here and you see even in your life you see you can tell what is the objective in our life the objective is what to see Jesus Christ glorified not to see a certain group of people not to see a certain church not to know is to see Jesus Christ and him glorified in his people it's receives souls that are bound that are miserable that where the devil has overtaken their life and where lives are in shambles doing the real objective is in our heart it's that people would get to Christ because we know if they just come to a church that's not enough you've got to go deeper than just a church you've got to respond and give all heartedly to the God who is pulling and pulling upon your life cuz you can set in a church and rock what where the Spirit of God is being poured out why you must move when the pillar of fire is moving you've got to move by the center what do you say let Christ be your objective hallelujah my objective was never to preach my objective was never to be a song leader who now needs to lead songs I was just as happy just just serving the Lord to get to know I get to come to church on a midweek service when we get together with some brothers and sisters like we would do and listen to a tape in their home it did me good to know but I made me have different ones buddies and we would listen to tapes all night long and hear Sunday morning hear the dawn the light would come in we would get ready and come to the house of God he joy it drawing my heart if this was not this is not why I serve God this is only something that God has said son this is what I want you to do I want you to serve my body Lord anything that you desire but the ultimate in all things is my heart beats for him the objective is for him I'm just speaking very clearly from my heart my heart has never been in one time to make anybody dependent upon me because you cannot be dependent upon the flesh of Samuel Browning you've got to know Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection your revelation has got to be personal in your heart in your life it's got to be anchored with you personally this is why this is why were the motives and objectives as they come so why the profit would he would admonish he would tell us always stay with that word empower transformation he said always stay with the word always check your motives they're right if it's according to the Word of God if it is God's will and then your motives lines up then hold to it because you realize that something listen to me this is how close it comes down something can be the will of God but if there's a selfish motive in doing it it's the same as not being the will of God this is where brother Branham talks about and how can I overcome and he's talking about in lives he's dealing with Lot's wife he's dealing with these as they start out in the journey and then he talks about how Satan can come around and you take he said a sister with long hair and he said then he said the enemy begins to whisper to her and say my look at your long hair Wow isn't that beautiful and you see what happens is she begins to glory in it because of the wrong thing so then the doing of it up the showing of it all for all those are the things and now instead of really being correctly in the Word of God it now becomes to operate under a wrong motive or wrong objective yet you look at it and you say my what beautiful long hair but you see if the motive our objective behind it is not correct God looks on the heart man judge it notice man judge it after the outward appearance paul here having the Ministry of God the revelation what does it do it brings it down to the heart oh we ought to rejoice in that because every trap that you and I have fallen into and every mistake that we are made guess where it comes down to God looks upon the heart he deals with the heart and we said Lord forgive me I didn't mean to make that direction and the Holy Spirit it brings conviction why because the word has caused us to look upon the heart Oh glory thank God for the discernment of the word you see the Spirit of God it is to come through the word this is why when David would write in Psalm 51 he would write thou desirest truth after the inward parts Jesus when he cut here here's the Spirit of God moving in the word and that out coming through the word and he looks upon him and let me just without having to read him let me just preach from he did the Spirit of God discerns what nobody else can see they have long robes they like to be greeted in the marketplace they they wanted to chief seats and when it came to widows house they would make a long prayer and Jesus said you do it in pretense and because you know what you're doing and he said because of it you'll receive the greater damnation they were doing something without being genuine in their heart this is what a real prisoner comes to is what is to be done is from a soul jigna whiteness from our soul God let every one of our motives and our objectives be discerned by his spirit anything that's not like him let it be removed powered you know Jesus would also move and speak to that where he would say beware of false prophets that here they come in sheep's clothing in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are raving wolves see what the word does now when he makes that statement here look look when he makes the statement their question is now the notice the question how will I know how will I know because outwardly all of our senses Howard Lee would say they're spot-on but you see the Spirit of God it reveals what's there listen to me now if this is not in any way projecting to you and I that all of a sudden we walk into a service and we say oh this one or oh that one that's not what we're talking about neither and let me just spend let me just stop this call out right now me there is it for us to glory and say hmm I always knew there was something about that person I always that's and brings that's not the discernment we're talking about come on now only thing that does is give you glory that don't give God glory let's just be honest there are things that we have seen and it has shocked us where people have went certain directions and we just going to be honest about it it shocks us but here's where it comes to show you and I it's not about our natural abilities but it comes down to the fruit of the word and the fruit notice by their fruits they are known what is the fruit are they teaching the word for this season in power and demonstration amen is it the fruit here the fruit by their fruit Jesus let it be known they can go right in where the vine is at right you gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles he lets it be known these things can grow riding around what makes the difference what's in the roots what's in the roots Oh aren't you glad that your roots are founded in Jesus Christ this is why Paul would Paul would pick this same found up and I'm just I'm moving over these scriptures that I have here because just following the his direction on it Paul would come to that place and Paul would let him know before his departure previous wolves are going to enter in previous wolves but they look like sheep's clothing but notice where Paul what's Paul's approach Paul's approach is not something where he's nervous what does he say I commend you to the word of grace that is able to build you up he spoke to the overseers take heed lay in the Word of God as anybody told Timothy lay in that word stand upon that word why because of of wolves previous wolves that would enter in Paul is addressing men who would have other objectives than the objective of Christ brother Branham put it just this simple he called it the Pentecostal objective and the Pentecostal objective is when the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into our heart then it's no longer either liveth it's Christ that liveth that's the real objective this is what Paul and let me just pick it up Paul would say because of this revelation in 2nd Corinthians 4 what we have received because what we have received we have renounced all hidden things of dishonesty let me just bring this down real clear that's everything that God deals with our heart on not handling the Word of God in craftiness or deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves under every man's conscience look look look how the Holy Spirit would deal with the prophets life back in 56 then again in NMM in 60 there in the adoption series you find it in you know throughout no one he said I'd become critical and hearing liked likened criticalness to a selfish spirit that I've gotta tell everybody that they're they're there they're wrong and I'm right and this and that see when this is what I'm saying to say you see with the word that has come that word though here the prophet we're here it was in the humanity was moving in that direction but the Spirit of God would bring that that discretion to his life and II recognize wait a minute here Who am I see this is renouncing all things of dishonesty because why if he doesn't get that cleared out the word will come forth and that travels with it you gotta get that cleared out is that right so you see this is where when we when we we understand this that these things the motive and objective of how it would come to try to draw away from the real purpose and the real objective and let me just try to to to to wrap some of these points up here Paul would tell us in another place here in Philippians let me just just to skip over a few things in Philippians chapter 2 verse 20 and he's talking about Timothy for I have no man like-minded that means equal in Soul who will naturally care for your state that was made known and revealed where Paul could express that Timothy has the same objective hello let me just tell you just as the profit in this age the one of the last paragraphs in resume of the church ages in the church age book inside of the tape case as well he says not for one moment do I bring I have have an objective that people would follow me or to make an organization he said but there's one objective that I have longed to see and that is a true relationship between God and man that's really following the message is when you follow it into the token life anything outside of the token life you're not really following it you've only followed it to a certain spot but you've got to go all the way redemption is two parts coming out and going into there's many of you that are much older than me I say that with joy but I stand like this you've seen a lot more things just as I've seen things people come and go I've even seen people younger than myself come and go and you would see people sometimes then they'd come in and their view of the message as though that the message is a challenge to the government they view the message as though it gives them a right to live stubbornly and obstinately and all those things and they miss the heart the kernel of what it's all about they they take it and they become debaters hussars strife and envy and they're always posting things they're not posting to edify somebody else they're posting to tear somebody else down come on now it might seem like man they feed on the message but they're not feeding on it when you feed on it you become one with the life that's in it that's heaven the right objective you can listen to it every day of your life but you've got to have the right objective and when you really feed on it brother it is the Spirit of Jesus Christ coming in you and molding and shaping your character to one objective one ambition one goal and that's Jesus Christ and him crucified and glorified in his people a person could have been the 1960s hippie and they get ahold of the message and they never get delivered they bring that same motive and objective right here under the message and they handle the mess with um uh preachers as well they handle it but they're not handling it in truth it doesn't edify Jesus Christ in the people whether this word is to edify Jesus Christ this word brings sons and daughters of God to abduction I'm not preaching something I read about how preaching something that I am and I have become I know what I'm talking about and Paul was designing this the content was not all again was not wrong it was the motive and objective behind it this is what Paul is dealing with this is why we must have the discernment of the Holy Spirit this is why the scripture says the many sick and weakly among you not discerning the Lord's body how do we discern the Lord's body what is the Lord's body it's not people it's the Spirit of Christ in tabernacled in the hearts of his people that's the Lord's body is that right I'm Jesus why persecute us down me it was his body that's his church his church is not brick and mortar his church is his body be baptized into the body of Jesus Christ and in his church he's got arms singers ears eyes he's got back in his intelligence he's got feet he's got legs he's got toes he's got fingernails come on now he's got a little hairs on the big toe he's got little hairs on the little toe he got all that's it it's all part of the body no matter where you are even if you are the skin on the bottom of the feet every devil is under your feet you've been lifted in the heavenly places is that right so when we look at this and as we evaluate that part Paul said I have known a man whose leg mended that'll naturally care for your estate this is why we must this is why him brother Branham he brings that message discernment of spirit powerful message powerful message I don't know how many times you know I use with any other message and listen to that message sometimes I take a message of the can just keep on listening to her listening to it listen to it listen to a listener and list who mister but the thing he comes down to his is discerning he said don't judge the man's ideas he said he might have our ideas compared to you but what you discern is what are they trying to achieve for the kingdom of God are they trying to achieve something for the kingdom of God or are they trying to build something for themselves this is where it takes the discernment of the Spirit of God because in case you haven't noticed it we look different we act different we think different but there has to be something that is common to where we give our lives to and that is the Holy Ghost huh let me just do we just close here this is where Paul said let me just these two verses scripture and then we'll just close for all seek not for all seek Pharaoh verse 21 not the things which are Jesus Christ what's he dealing with the motive and objective see we're not serving God because of what he can do for us well if I serve God this is the same spirit that brought in the organization and caused the fall in Nicaea the same spirit what can be popular they started taking people into the church because they're a governor because there's this and Constantine says well you know if I tell you what will protect you we'll do this if we of you only you know just merge with us they compromised not to true I said not to true the true remained true and the true went in the ground roll away just like the Lord Jesus himself remember here the groom had to go in the ground but remember the life the life that was projected in that body it came in and went down into hell notice here he comes going down into hell in the thinest theophany and he walks down there and he preached he preaches down there and he ascends back up brother and what does he do he raises up that body amen in a glorified manner what was it now the Saint Jesus that had walked among them the same Jesus now here he was once again the same one before his death burial now raised again and the same way with the bride of Jesus Christ when they put her in the ground she went in the ground in the darkness of that fact our age in the darkness of denominationalism but she began to come back up why cuz you can't kill the life the life is in the roots of the tree that motive and objective is pulsating and that same motive and objective is pulsating in the heart of the believer tonight for all seek their own and not the things which are Jesus Christ but you know proof of him he says that as a son with the father he has served me served with me in the gospel what a compliment my heart is so drawn just just it's skipping over these things just this preached what God is just so inspired to my heart what I was drawing to some time ago as I'm reading this and this I am closing because all this is going on all this is taking place people are preaching some in truth some in pretense some out of envious strength others out of love now once you'd apply this this gets applied down in our lives because remember you may not have the gift to preach in your life but your life preaches every day so what kind of a message are you preaching that's what you have to look at what kind of trail are you leaving behind you what kind of message are the messages that your life is preaching is it leading people to the real truth of Jesus Christ or is it leading them to your idea or is it leading them to a church or is it leading them just to a place to where they come into agreeance with doctrine you understand what I'm saying is something it ought to be the objective in our heart listen the objective I don't care if you don't understand the difference between P and corn but you meet Jesus Christ he is the seals he is the feast he is he is it all and all of that that's what's important because you catch it that it's all together it's not fragmented pieces like a puzzle laying out pieces come together amen this message comes to bring a clearer picture and they just stop here notwithstanding he said in every way Christ is preached and I i rejoice and yea I will rejoice look how Paul handled that Paul handled it yet in other places in in the book of Tim of Philippians we did not read tonight in other places where Paul will call him out you'd they're deceitful workers they serve their own belly but notice not how it balanced his confidence this is taking place but it's confidence and he's working with the prisoners of Jesus Christ that they stay focused on the right objective and that's what I say from my heart tonight let us have the right objective the right motive in all that we do all that are listening all that is streaming those that will stream the service let it be to where we are founded in the place they are preaching out of love they are living out of love they are walking in truth they are preaching in truth I say god help me god help us amen all glory we have this confidence in the Lord as Paul said if there be any otherwise minded it shall be revealed don't you want the Lord to search your heart God I want you to search search my heart every day that's what I asked him to do Lord search my heart search my heart Lord Jesus how father Lord you are so so mindful Lord your eyes what you see what's really the true value goes beyond Lord God sometimes what our eyes can see sometimes our eyes can see something on the outside the form itself looks to be absolutely perfect and lined up that yet really on the inside it's not really lined up that's where it's got to be lined up life that's in it or Jesus help us Lord God to be open to you that you would so search our hearts Lord I don't want to be found I would want to be found in that place none of us as your children want to be found their Lord in pretense not even for a moment Lord yet all of us that are listening and gathered around the word tonight we cannot say that every time we've always had the right motive and objective we can't say that the Lord God what we can say is our heart's desire is to please you the Lord when you've come and you've corrected us thank you for that Boyd Lord our desire even though we're so thankful for your grace we are confident and to know that you correct us but our desire is lord help us to be sensitive help us not to be impatient or hasty Lord those things that we find to be the will of God may we then allow the Spirit of God to test our motives is it something selfish or Lord is it is it something that's really for the kingdom of God's sake Lord we know sometimes there's things that we can we can do or we can have and yet it comes down to Lord in our lives as believers we we don't want anything we get to it we get to that place we realize and we start evaluating things not in terms of is it sin or not but we evaluated in terms of how will this affect my walk [Music] I pray that God you would help each and every one of us or those that would call this their home even for those Lord that be streaming or archived and maybe from another assembly or other churches I pray that God may each and every one so take account in their life if they can see in their life Lord that there's not been any growth may they not allow Lord the enemy to discourage you but may they heed to the call the beckoning call of the Spirit of God and to let them know that that's your love it's calling desiring that they would move closer because you said drawn on to me and I'll draw mine to you Lord if right there in their hearts they can say lord I need to go deeper and I want to I want to Lord I want to line up with your word lord I pray I know that your spirit you're drawn to a heart like that but I still ask Lord that you would move right in where that heart is that Lord God strengthen them Lord to keep walking on Lord I pray may that be the objective Lord even as we are walking in this life Lord God whenever the time would be we don't even have to wait til the time to when these doors would be back open where we can meet back in there together Lord like we have in times past should that Lord be able to happen but we want to live every day our objective is to please you when we walk into these doors and we sit down maybe Lord got an appreciation or done like we've never had before what a score God may there be revival that would break out in hearts Lord God hearts Lord God that may be Lord were their objective and their motive has been so wrong what God may maybe they didn't mean to be wrong but Norden just got something sidetracked but I pray God in your mercy Lord I ask Lord God that you would let them to know tonight Lord that the real objective is you want to be so real to them you want to be their buddy I just read Lord the other day where your prophet said you slip down out of eternity you took upon a body of flesh that you might come down here and you might pay the price and then send back the holy droves because you wanted to live buddies with us all love God a friend that sticketh closer than a brother you tell us the truth Oh Lord God thank you for that Lord and I ask for Jesus may every objective in every motive Lord may it be surrender to you may every ambition may every will Lord as your prophet put it in prisoner of Jesus Christ he said Lord may you wash our wills washing wash our ambitions washing granite lord I pray Lord we just love you we appreciate you this is our objective Lord our objective is that you would be glorified I'm asking Lord God you said that ask for big things now I'm asking Lord God that you would feel Lord God every heart with the Holy Ghost I'm asking you'd give him such a hunger Lord they will hunger after you Lord God not just hungry to get back in the church doors but they will hunger after you Lord God and I'm asking you Lord Jesus Oh God but you and Lord grant Lord a refilling of the Holy Ghost Lord for every one of us Lord that our vision be renewed our hearts be renewed Granite Lord Oh blessed be the name of the
