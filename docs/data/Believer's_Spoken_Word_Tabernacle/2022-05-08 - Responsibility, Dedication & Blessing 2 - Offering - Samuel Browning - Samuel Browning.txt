========================================

he ties it into the mission fields he ties it in into witnessing he ties it into where we are supporting the work of the lord so it's something to be invested because let's just be honest we're going to be invested in something and any you you we can't hide what we're invested in it'll come forth because everybody's dedicated right everybody's dedicated you know just as much as you've had people that's dedicated to work you've got people dedicated to find ways not to work truth is truth right so everybody there's dedication and what it is is what is what is and you say well how do i know what i'm dedicated to what is it whatever you're dedicated to and what is preeminent you will not allow compromise in that area of your life it might be your children but i'll go to church but whatever it is that you will say nope i draw the line right here but reality in all those things what it should be is the preeminence in our life is the lord jesus christ because when he's the preeminent one he's the one that gives the influence over the lives of our homes it's him that even when we can't say anything to the boss or or to this one but it's his influence in our life that god will give favor and bring us into favor in the sight of man god will direct our lives and we can have confidence within that oh glory be to god we we thank god to be invested in the work of the lord we thank god to recognize our day of visitation and the message we recognize that this visitation that god has promised in his word in this hour it was not just another man with a gift this was a prophetic gift that was prophesied in the scriptures in this hour just as much as the lord jesus himself was here in redemption god promised he would send a message that would redeem the bride draw her out of denominational and place a real uniting with jesus christ god has kept his promise and what a privilege it is to recognize our day and its message that we're not just fellowshipping around what god did our fellowship is not just looking at the prophet but our fellowship is what god was in the prophet and what god manifested that same god is present right here in our lives and we are invited to have the same experience to have the token applied to our lives just as the coming of the lord jesus pointed the children of god to the upper room that they must be united with him it's a privilege to be united with the living god by the new birth hallelujah it's a privilege that our understanding has been opened that we recognize that just accepting jesus christ as our savior we're not born again just by that that's part of the way what a privilege it is that god would say in this hour and confirm he has made known to us the path of righteousness the path of life because it's god's desire not man's desire but god's desire because even when god would make this known and reveal it man would pull back and man would say well this is what our church teaches this is what our church teaches but if the church teaches something different from the word it's not a gateway to heaven it's a gate of hell come on friends the bible said many powerful men in the book of proverbs have went into her gates and it said her stares are the stairway to hell is that right oh my it's where a relationship is between god and his people the surrendering of our lives oh my way and a privilege that we can support the cause with our attendance ties and offerings and all that he would ask us to do we want to have the same kind of testimony as the queen of sheba had are you with me the queen of sheba she went ready she heard what was going on and how the bible records she went there her camel's was was filled there with with riches with an offering to give if she saw that what she had heard about that god was present there and making himself real through the life of a man she was ready to support it when she saw it she didn't only see it in solomon she seen the effect of that gift and lives that were rallied around that gift remember the real gift is the holy ghost in this hour are you hearing me now when she saw she said even how the servants put the meat on the table even how solomon ascended up to the house of god she watched the character that actually was exhibited through the lives of the household and she said there was no spirit left within me she recognized you see the effect of the gift of god that it had and she was ready ready to support it so when we look at this and think of it in the scripture because you know as god wrote it here with ties and offerings they're not the same thing they're two different things and god wrote him that way he wrote and he spoke to israel in that way and he would speak of how that they were to return and have things because remember the tithes and offerings themselves they could have given their tithes and their offerings and they still wouldn't have been fully returned to god but god was speaking of and you realize in this chapter and other places in haggai it was their heart that had gone away from god their heart got turned and they began to be invested in other things of life and once you start investing in other things of life you begin to lose sight of other things and god is speaking to their heart because wherever your heart is and heart is directed your life will follow is that right so now notice how god would make such a distinct difference you see each of them had to do with the work of the lord in the house of the lord you know brother branham was asked a question would it be wrong to use ties on church building funds and i know i've had i've had i've had things not here but i've had you know different ones and ministers and different ones call me and you know and ask you know a take or something because sometimes you know in this in this day and age and i hate to say it this way but sometimes people become so dogmatic on things i've just got to say it become so locked up instead of really recognizing what's behind the quote anybody can quote a quote but there's one thing about this message and i'll get to as we get further on in here that this message brought us to was to discern the motive and the spirit behind everything you say what do you say i'm saying that where there's been people that would leave churches because a pastor would take from the tithing and put into the building fund i'll just say it this way they really weren't locked in the right way the way they should have been because when we're locked in the right way our focus is on jesus christ we're all we're going to make decisions we might disappoint one another but if our focus is on jesus christ just like it should be in our homes among our family then no matter when we would disappoint we may not agree but our focus still stays on christ who is the absolute we should not be looking about dividing we should be in the spirit of uniting with the word so you know brother graham he puts that separate he lets it be known uh the the separate within this and i'm just going to refer to a few places i i didn't post this quote but he says you know how the tithings that goes to the the pastors and so forth and he says but he says and he talks about how he said well people would take you no money and he said they'll take their ties and give them to a widow woman well that's wrong if you've got anything to give the widow woman you give her but don't give her god's money that's not yours in the first place that's god's if you sent me downtown look how simple he puts it you sent me downtown to get a loaf of bread and you give me 25 cents to get the loaf of bread and i met somebody on the street and they wanted something else and i'd give them the 25 cents i've give them your money if they ask me for something let me get over here in the other pocket and give them money because a tenth is the lord's and levi the priest could live on the tenth now brother battle says that that tithing goes into the church for the pastor he said but the building funds and the things are separate fun all together so the ties themselves uh you know i never forget i had a co-worker one time she asked you know sometimes you i guess it i don't want to call it privileges or what but you get asked you know a question you know knowing you're a minister and said hey i want to ask you a question i you know i i had some ties and and what i did was is my ex-husband you know i i gave him those ties what do you think about that there's some questions you get as a minister you think why did i get there i just i so what did you say well i told her you know see just a sweet lady and i told her i said well you know i said what the scripture says i said is that goes into the storehouse i said where you get your food i said so you given it to that to your ex-husband or whatever more i said god don't recognize that you took what belonged to god and you gave it to them oh my sometimes it's really easy to speak truth and other times it's just your feet your toes are crawling up in you you know because you know how we all deal with things or thoughts and things like that but notice we see how god separated the ties and the offerings and how that the tithes are to support that ministry that is laboring on behalf of the lord given to study in order to minister the word of the lord whereby the sheep of god are led by the holy spirit coming through the word of god and the offerings are to support the work of the lord the local assembly in maintenance of the facilities utilities and upkeep also the building fund is as well as offerings designated for missions missionaries and mission work and love offerings so god has an ordained way i'm not going to read this and this this quote to you but i'll refer to it it's very similar to the ones that we were reading last week god has already a provided way god has a provided way just like for a man to come into christ it's not by hand's sake it's by one spirit we are baptized into one body repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost it's not a church book a church book has no virtue in it so all of these things that we see and brother branham would lay this downhill with theology and teaching and they tried to you know tell a man this and tell a man that and everything is theology and brethren said we've got to come back to god's way now how he's placing all this god's way that god he said has a way to support the church it's not through uh you know blanket selling and pies selling and soup suppers but god already had a provided way and we can come back to god's way and and really in everything in our lives and evaluating it then everything will operate according to god's provided way for that i'm glad that god makes known his provided way aren't you amen because you know there's no doubt about it you know you can have people that you come in contact with and and you know when they start talking about coming to church the thing that stands out to them is man you how in the world you do this you got to give a tenth of your income my goodness to think listen to me now to think that that would be one thing that would stop people from giving their life to the lord it ain't about to recognize that the money that even that we have remember as we looked at it last week the earth is the lords and the fullness thereof we have not done this on our own god has given us the skills and the strengths that we have i mean you could take me out to the range a month of sundays and let me shoot and zero in i can tell you right now i'll never be able to shoot like brother joey shoots you might say brother simon you're selling yourself short well i don't think so i i know better than that sometimes my hand gets a little bit shaky but you see there are skills that god has placed within our lives just like when they wanted to tell me as a teacher well you need to teach them math this way and teach them math that way or you know sending me off to look at that i said hold on a second you're wanting me to take teach everybody as though everybody has an engineering mind everybody don't have an engineering mind we're interested that they grab a hold of the concept if that's there within them it will come out in the other framework of classes in high school and college is that right god has placed us here in earth not with something well god didn't give me anything to take care of myself he's jehovah jireh amen when god gave the vision to moses there remember in the midst of that vision he says by the way in order to bring this to pass i have filled men with the spirit of wisdom to bring it from the vision till it becomes manifest he's jehovah jireh now you and i have to come to that place to find out what is it that god that you have me to do and sometimes that can you know as you narrow down as young people that can be seemingly become a little bit scary now listen it doesn't mean for everybody that everybody's going to go to college my goodness samuel oh this don't seem very spiritual very deep no god's interested in every part god's interested in every part of our life sometimes there's things that we put so far off and well this internet and this and this and then we wonder why sometimes why isn't the church and why aren't lives moving on the way they should be sometime in our own lives sometimes the things that we look at and say oh that's insignificant let me tell you something brother branham didn't think these things were insignificant he spoke that how before in that quote i read you he said he spent weeks and months upon teaching the church tithes and offerings we don't have those recorded messages it was important so when we see this sometimes it's hard for us coming to the place of what god has for us and let me just say it to you like this if you're in college god never called you to be a career college student pastor's back god never called you no you say what do you mean brother simon i'm a witness i'm a witness when you just can ask god and put yourself before god god will speak to you whether it's through a teacher whether it's through a minister some way god will speak to your heart because god has placed that within you that he ignites it and brings it forth to serve his purpose that's why i said it's not just even in college uh even within trades and drywall and plumbing and painting and whatever more i'm appreciative of that i had to do a little bit of plumbing miner and it's other calling other people drywall drywall's an art well we're going to go on and preach here so the tithe is the 10 out of the income and the offering is what we willingly give of the 90 now think how god says in proverbs 3 9 honor the lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with mercedes now don't say that now i know smiley tooth texans teach that but that ain't what god said so shall thy barns be filled with plenty means enough that's what it means and thy presses shall burst out with new wine what god has said is the same way that he took care of the widow of zereth that put god first then god seemed that every one of her needs were met and she ate of thus saith the lord remember jesus won't be outdone he won't be in debt to nobody so think how god has so entrusted us with the substance and increase with complete understanding of our needs and he asked us to trust him and says proves me and that's to walk into every life of the believer is to walk in faith trusting completely in the lord you know this is one small way when we give of our times and our offering this is one small way that we are able to honor the lord this is one small way of recognizing his lordship his faithfulness remember when abraham came face to face there in the in in the kings dale and he comes there there's a lot of other kings but right there abraham recognizes melchizedek is greater than all of them and that's where we recognize the lord his presence working very personally even in our local church you see that's where and you know me by now some of you visitors don't know me but you know me by now i've never told anybody come here to church i've never done that as a matter of fact anybody's thinking about coming to church i don't go out to eat with them sorry why i don't want anybody nothing my personality be something you'd fall in love with but i don't want anybody here because we're to cater to this and cater to this if god leads you to come here that's what it has to be that there's a connection between you and god not a man's personality we don't need to be united with personalities as a matter of fact many personalities in the scripture brother branham even said regarding his own personality we're not united with the personality it's to hear the voice of god john said i turned to hear the voice see the voice that was speaking to me there must be a voice of god that speaks so personally to your life that you recognize it's god speaking personally it's god given a stewardship of my life he's ministering right down to the very strings and hearts of my life what grace how would we know even where to put our foot down i thank god for that oh glory be to god it was just like before god you know before i become pastor here didn't want to be pastor but i had brothers that set me down and they they told me i said you're wasting your time well brother samuel you can come here and you know we'll turn the church over i'm no i'm i'm where i belong they say how do you know that because you say brother samuel god can god can move things around like he did paul and barnabas i don't doubt that but i knew what the certainty where god had placed me and god wanted me to be here so no matter what came my way i knew this is where god wanted me to be this is why brother brahma talked about that one small way he says our heavenly father thou has taught us in the word that let every man lay aside that which god has prospered him that when the first day of the week when we come together that we should bring in our tithes and offerings into the place your house and we thank thee for the privilege that we have of worshiping thee in this manner which is such a little way second corinthians 9 7 says every man according as he hath purposed in his heart so let him give so this scripture it would speak there was a purposing in heart and this scripture really speaks in that of the offering where it's taking from the other 90 that god has entrusted to us and notice according as he had purposed in his heart this is something that's to be between us personally and god tithing is between you and god too right between me and god because we're all tithe players ministers included we're all in offering because we're all invested in this together is that right now so within this notice how the principal paul would pick this up not grudgingly or otherness or of necessity well i have to do this for god loveth a cheerful giver in other words don't look at it like you're paying your water bill or when your car breaks down is that all right sorry that'll help some of you loosen you up a little bit luke 6 38 give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again brother branham i just um you know i remembered this from some you know a few years back or the times and you're getting ready to preach the message you must be born again and there's a need that has arose in the congregation and brother branham he turns and said brother neville would you mind taking up this offering and brother neville let me just read you i have it here in my quotes i'm just going to refer to this point here's what brother neville says brother neville says thank you brother branham oh i enjoy doing something this way because it is this that helps us to be more christ-like and spiritual sometimes people say i want you to pray for me that i'll be a better christian he said well i've prayed for you now i'm going to show you how to be one [Laughter] oh glory be to god oh my now in the offerings here let's just try to whittle this down here a little bit in exodus 25 verse 1 the bible said the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring me an offering notice bring me an offering of every man that giveth that willing with his heart willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering so it's unto the lord and this is the offering which you shall take of them gold silver brass verse 8 and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them according to all that i show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it and remember this is when moses here is caught up in the cloud and god is unfolding to him of that vision of the tabernacle you see god was was expressing to to moses his desire all along was to dwell among men now god could not come into man right now because there was nothing that could atone and take care of the sin condition right we see all this begins to be spoken where abraham has a desire for an heir and god lets him know somebody on the outside and elies are in different one that's not going to be your heir but one that will come forth from thine own loins shall be thine air see it was an expression of god and then that continues to move forward to the reality that god's desire his resting place and dwelling place would be in the very heart of his error of his children of his offspring we are the dwelling place of almighty god so all of this was speaking in tight but notice notice god said speak to them and let them bring me an offering see god's a gentleman it's just like in a person god doesn't god doesn't run around and pull us and threaten us but god pulls on the heart of an individual to surrender their own life is that right the bible said he that will keep his life shall lose it but he that will lose it for my sake shall find it right so it's entrusted god has entrusted us and with a choice a decision that you and i are called upon to make and notice let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them now when you think of this look here in exodus 35 10 chapters later this is after remember after the golden calf and all this now is when moses can actually speak to the people they were in no condition for this vision to be made known to at that time because the golden calf sin was in the camp right so there were no condition for the vision to be spoken of i'm trying my best not to preach here this is why there must be a repentance first before the real vision and the unfolding of the word that real reality can begin to come there's got to be a repentance amen to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ then god can reveal his riches to you and i right there's an entrustment notice in verse 20 of exodus 35 and all the congregation of the children of israel departed from the presence of moses so he's making known to them the vision of the sanctuary and they came everyone whose heart stirred him up so who was it was it moses that stirred them up their heart how was their heart stirred by the vision supernatural vision god's desire being spoken through earthly lips touched their heart it stirred them up and everyone whom his spirit made willing and they brought the lord's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation and for all his service and for the holy garments and they came both men and women as many as were willing hearted and he goes on to all that they brought and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the lord and every man look at this with whom was found it lays out everything everyone that did offer an offering of silver and brass and brought the lord's offering in verse 24 every man with whom was found verse 27 and the rulers brought notice all of these things moses never said are you brother aaron you bring the blue uh sister anna you bring the scarlet that was never said but he was communicated and what god needed they already had been entrusted with hallelujah it struck their heart the blue the scarlet the goat's hair it already it's god because remember he's jehovah gyra god is not going to make a vision if there's nothing on earth that can't bring that vision into manifestation god never sends a message unless there's a people on earth that are ordained to line up with that message and become that message he is jehovah jireh he provides for himself is that right oh and the bible says in verse 29 the children of israel brought a willing offering unto the lord every man whose heart made them willing to bring all the manner of work which the lord had commanded to be made by the hand of moses god had arranged this when you read how that even before moses goes down to egypt god let him know on this deliverance and with the people to borrow of the egyptians the gold and all these things because they didn't have them the children of israel didn't have onyx stones and gold and all that they didn't have that think about it if that would have been spoken at that time it wasn't fitting why it wasn't in their possession and you read through the scriptures as it goes god said to borrow to take to gain favor with the egyptians they did not go in there the egyptians and say give me this and give me that and give me this that's not how it worked god continued on in two other places when it was time for the exodus in exodus 11 before chapter 12 god's going into the passover he says you tell the people now is the time to go speak to the egyptians well brother samuel that was egyptian goat the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof i know it's awful to think about but the 20 bill maybe that's too high the one dollar bill that you've got in your pocket right now might have been a dollar bill that was made for a drug deal last week are you with me but you see in the things that god has entrusted the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof and the bible says they went out in exodus 12 and they did according to the word of moses and they borrowed of the egyptians and god gave them favor in their sight i'll tell you what i see within that i see the same thing as it was in jacob when jacob came to bethel jacob was just running jacob didn't know anything was special about where he was at at bethel but that night at bethel god had pre-arranged that and when god came down jacob a man that had nothing but he told god he said lord if you watch over me and you bring me back to this place bless me lord god that i will give thee a tithe of all he had met god and notice he could ask he could look to god and say god if you will bless me lord you're the one that has to bless me you're the one lord that has to provide for me jacob made a vow unto god and when jacob returned to the battle brother he returned and he kept that vow he had all he had much right jacob not only had the attempt to offer to god but jacob remembered now we know even out of fear he was sending over droves of cattle and everything else you know to meet esau right even when god even when laban tried to mess with everything change his wages 10 times god was watching over jacob god said i'll rebuke the devourer for your sake he was watching over him that even though things fluctuated stock market went up and down but god said i was got before the stock market i'll be god after it's all said and done are you with me i wonder how many people would have thought we could look back on it now when did brother random and then build the tabernacle during the time of the depression is that right he lets us know that he said of how that even the people wanted a church so bad now they had a place together i want you to catch this they had a place i i walked around and brother nathan nam was pointing it out you know the different places and they would take me to where the different gatherings were at where brother branham was where they gathered here they rented this building they rented this building but the people wanted a place that they could call their own and even you you can read that in the message where they made a statement to brother brown they said we will allowance our children at the dinner table in order to have a place you know why these were hearts that caught a vision beyond just natural provision they realize after we are done set and gone we've got to make arrangements if the lord tarries brother samuel god is coming if i knew he was coming tonight i'd still be ready if i knew he was coming on thursday night i'd still get ready to preach thursday's service are you hearing me this is how we are told to live in this hour oh glory be to god you see god has entrusted us with so many things so it's our i you know i i think with everything not just that we should pray about you know when we're the times we already know that's a tenth unto the lord i think we should pray about this with our offerings i think we definitely should pray not think we should pray about it we should make it a matter of prayer you see god has entrusted us with so many different things entrusted us with talents and trusted us with gifts all the way through the gospel itself of jesus christ how that the whole theme of it's displayed in one who took the form of a servant our whole lives are meant to be an offering right our whole lives brother brown would say it like this in the message what house will you build me short message that he speaks to the needs that are in that congregation when brother perry is starting out and he says now look they're going to need sunday school teachers they're going to need deacons they're going to need this they're going to need that and he says you pray about that you see that's being invested in something not everybody's going to be a deacon everybody's going to trust him not everybody's going but we're all invested in the work of the lord what can we do that should be the question lord what can i do what can i do lord what can i do brother browning always used to have a i don't know if it was brother browning's saying or not but he would say it very often and it was a saying that says if everyone was in this if everyone in this church was just like me then what kind of church would this church be and he wasn't talking about himself that's a question that we have to look in the mirror and say if everybody in the church was just like me what kind of church would this church be see sometimes in reality we're counting on other people instead of also being under the burden of the lord and god has called us to labor together to labor together think of this i want to just touch this part on on worship very quickly in luke chap 21 verse 1 and he looked up here was the lord jesus he saw rich men casting their gifts into the treasury he saw also a certain poor widow casting into their two mites and he said of a truth i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god but she of her own penery hath cast in all the living that she had brother branham says it in this way let me just maybe refer to this at the same time two brethren had asked brother branham if he would come and do a meeting they had tithing for him and they were going to put on a meeting brother brown told him he said no he said i'm not going to do that he said what you do is i want you to take what you were going to give and i want you to pay for that meeting all the expenses of that meeting so the brothers brother fred sofman and the other and and brother borders they did that and when they and when they did it the meeting itself was not a success there were things that were so lacking in the meetings brother braham talks about it brother braham says in this he says you know he says i you know he says within it he said meetings are fine he said and we didn't take up an offering he says i don't care if the church is worth a hundred billion dollars you still owe it to god to take up an offering that's part of the worship it doesn't matter he said if it's a hundred billion dollar the church might everything's going good around here i don't think it's going good instead of 20 with two dollars to be all right still got two in it [Music] everybody say man kind of looking around you know but you see but brother brown went on to say within that he said which is true he said i wish i was financially able so we wouldn't even have to mention offering but he said i mention it anyhow and he goes into that example of what took place on that one time and he says when when they did that he said it was not a success because people has to have something in the meeting it's their meeting now i'll be honest with you i've been guilty of this i've been guilty when we had meetings we didn't take up any offering but by his help i'll not be guilty again it's true he said i did it he said people has to have something in the meeting it's their meeting listen what brother brown said the people were saying to him they'd meet me on the street and they'd say what's the matter with this meeting now brother i'm talking about a special meeting you understand what i'm saying he's talking about a special meeting he said people were meeting him on the street and said what's the matter with this meeting we haven't got no part in it they don't even take up an offering so offering is a part of worship brother braham ties into hattie wright brother remember brother branham went to hattie wright's house and he had 20 dollars in his pocket that sister meaty had given him to go buy eggs with and he went to her house with the purpose of giving that money back to sister hattie because sister hattie had pledged that towards the new church now when you read how brother brown speaks of hattie wright's house i her house still isn't standing but i've been right up there where we're right right there on the hill right where it was at and there's a trailer in its place now but when you have brother bam talked about her house brother brown says you could look through the boards and see the outside it struck brother brown's heart when he he went there and brother ram said i went there with that 20 in my heart my pocket i was going to give it back to her but he said the lord told me don't do that but brother brown was still waiting on that and about that time with telling how those squirrels stepped forth in the woods remember brother graham said i can't see how but it's just the same thing of genesis 22 that god provided a ram for abraham and he said he she was sitting back there and she said that ain't nothing but the truth he said see what it is he said i was going to give it back to her but god knew what he was going to do for her if you were to ask sister hattie sister had in that twenty dollars or your two your sons their two souls she didn't buy their souls but her willingness to offer and to give god seen beyond that whatever she would ask for at that time she could have had it her daddy being well her sister being made well but she turned around and he said i want the salvation of my two boys and the spirit of god came in there and brought conviction to their lives oh my you know you know what that speaks of is this right here it let us be invested in the things of god it will have an effect on our families on our children [Applause] we want to be invested in the vision catch the vision of almighty god and pray over these things in our lives i think if there's things if we could say it within this manner many many other places i could go into but if we could take it within that even that 90 percent that we have to where our offerings comes from because the 10th is already set but the 90 what comes out of there are offering that's but that's between us and god there's no set amount that's on that but can i just give you a testimony the way that i've worked it in my own life for our family before marriage and after marriage because i know how things can come here or there but i made certain things and and stands that this is where i'm going i'm going to stand right here you say why would you do that so that when it came to make decisions on other things i was not going to go across that because i don't want to tie things up to where god can't deal with my heart are you hearing me i remember back in 2003 or 2002 whenever it was we built our house that we sold brother joy they called me up and they wanted me to come in well i never thought i'd build a house whatsoever i really wasn't even looking at that i i went in there and i told them before i come in and say wait a minute just just cancel the appointment i'm not interested oh but you come in and you know we've got somebody in here you know and and they'll they'll talk with you on the financing one more i said ma'am you may not understand this i said but i pay tithes unto the lord now i was already pastoring the time i said and you know what i support the work of the lord and offerings and i said i know the people that are going to be looking at the financial part you're going to tell me what i can't afford i know what i can't afford you know it's like you go to the car dealership and you and you go to them and they if there's somebody anybody who's a car dealer in here forgive me but you know they they get you in there how you like it you like take it for a ride ah let's see kev we get you out the door for this much how much is it what if we get how much is it how much you're giving me on mine right because you know they want to look they look at everything and tell you well this is how much he can do no no this is why i believe within our hearts friends as children of god that if we look at these things and say you know i don't want finances to be a burden in my life and we've all made mistakes i said we've all made mistakes that comes with the territory right but if we can look at it and say god i don't even want that to be a burden i don't want that to be a thought i don't even want i just i want to be free to serve you i want to i don't want tension in my marriage i don't want this is this is our responsibility that god entrust us with oh man you love him all right let's just we'll just close with that the offerings as you see what we take up its offerings is there's bills that that are had just in bills without even a project or something that comes along uh other things that comes up maintenance and everything else that takes place and this is why i really admonish you and i thank god the faithfulness that you have exhibited to the lord and i say god richly bless you if these services have done nothing more than just to encourage you i trust it has encouraged you for those of you that have not really moved in to become a part that it will encourage you to really become a part in taking god at his word for those that have been a part if you just it may be just refocus the vision that you recognize that this is this where you can say this is my church this is my responsibility this isn't brother samuel's church this isn't so this is my church god has revealed that this is my poster duty this is mine this is everything that goes around here you know with the things that we do and the trustees they know when we we sit down and we speak with things and i believe the same thing in their heart as well too you know we're not trying to make anything to where it would be gold covered but i do want everything to be very presentable if that means if we have to wait let's wait i don't want blue with green and patched with green if is that all right we want it to be presentable when david could say i dwell in a house and that and the ark of the lord dwells in tense see david knew god deserves the best these are things that we just we thank god for the maintenance that god has allowed us to be able to do through the offerings and things and look in reality with this right here this this special project that we've it's not been an option like could we do it uh should we do it it was something we had to do we come to a spot we've had to do it it's not like other things where you you can you know where it just becomes an option and what are the things that's been done throughout throughout the building thank god we we never had we didn't take a special offering you know why that is that's because of your giving within the offerings it was there to be able to do with right all of that back there because remember this is your church this is your church all that that was done everything that you see and don't see the video and all those things there it is all of your giving and now you know we just we don't want to be taken with those things but we want to obey the word of the lord because to know that god is mindful and as long as i've got breath in my body and to stand here as long as you have me for that we want to see that the work of god goes forward amen and then the work keeps on moving on for the kingdom of god that you know the next month or the next tomorrow or these years i may not live to see that but my children will at god teres and brother branham would tell us even in the message mother's day the very first quote he admonished the church he said i see you're getting ready to build a new church he said that's wonderful he said because we have to think about our children and make arrangements for a place for them they didn't end up building a new building they ended up adding on to that building that they had there but that was part of the message taking sides with jesus i'm just giving these little things is that okay when brother branham was dealing with and taking sides with jesus he said we've got to think about our children that's coming on and make arrangements for them not just in building not just in all these things of finances but we have to think of it in terms of let our lives be an example that they can follow let the testimony of jesus christ be so prevailing in our lives and our hearts that it's his presence that affects their life amen amen how many love the lord how many glad you came amen i want to live the way he wants me to live if musicians would come much more that we but i believe that the lord helped us to see and gather just to be admonished it's a worship the giving of our times and offerings of worship unto the lord we're worshiping him for his great provision in our lives and what a worship it is and i hope you understood that when i said that about meetings because that was one of the things that we we never did and it isn't about money but there are i will say this when we do have meetings there are extra expenses that goes on uh the brothers know it from when they have to call about the septic tank and all those other things like that water and all those other things that takes place as well as things that we we are thankful that we're able to do whether to providing lunch uh providing things even when the other young people and things are getting together on those days and all everything that goes into it we want to be a part of it so we're not here to gather and garner uh out of that but it's always unto the lord amen hallelujah well we need to sing something you know i i heard a it was told me one time as a young boy it was a brother who substituted for the song service that day and when it came to taking up times and offerings he took the plate he wasn't thinking but he began to walk around and sing the song it is mine mine blessed be his name you know it's sometimes we don't think about things like that you know but the reality is is you know we we thank god because listen the greatest offering that we can ever give is to offer up our lives to the lord it's the greatest god doesn't take it from us remember he doesn't he doesn't force anybody to serve he doesn't force us that's not god's way if that if you're in that condition today that's a miserable condition you don't have to stay in that way god desires an offering that's brought from our hearts our lives offered up to him and you know that offering doesn't stop that offering goes about daily there's sometimes daily that we don't feel like praying we don't feel like reading we don't feel like sitting down and sometimes we just you just don't feel like it but that's that's the flesh but this is where it becomes a sacrifice and the offering and what a blessing it is when we can move beyond that barrier sometimes we maybe don't feel as you know and in other things reaching out to this one or reaching out here but you know it's an offering there's times with our families there's certain things that you know among your children there's certain things that are not your favorite activities to do with them right but but you don't do just what's favorite with you you find what they enjoy doing because it's all about not the activity it's about building the relationship of them i'm sure that the young brothers or the brothers who have daughters young daughters i'm sure you've probably played daddy in the house next to the little tikes once in a while you've ate the imaginary mac and cheese and you've drank the imaginary tea you've tasted the imaginary beef stew and said it was the best in the world and why did you do that not because you said boy i can't wait today we get to play house you did what you did as an offering because of that relationship with your daughter [Music] and that's what our lives every part of our life is an offering unto god our family life our life unto god paul would write let us present our lives as a living sacrifice an offering a sacrifice this is what we want to do we want every part of our life i don't want to just be where i'm giving in offerings but i want my life to be an offering where paul could say at the end of it he said now i'm ready to be offered up i've poured out my life now i'm ready to be offered up we want every part of our life lord i want every part of my life to center around you lord to where when my time is up here on this earth there might be a lot of other things that they could read about and know about but the one thing that's at the top of the list wasn't that boy he really enjoyed hunting no that that's true but that's not at the top of the list but when everything is said and done if my time comes before the rapture i want it to be where it said he was a real christian he loved the lord with all this heart he loved this message and then you can list the other things he liked throwing the football he liked getting out and hunting like but everything else jesus is number one amen let's pray heavenly father lord i thank you for your grace lord in these services lord that you've spoke to our hearts lord i'm just grateful lord for your grace and strength and how that you would come and
