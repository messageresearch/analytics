dedication here brother drake and sister rebecca phil lord has blessed their home again here with a little little sophia and uh we just want to dedicate her to the lord and we're just thankful for the blessings of god and how god has provided and so if they'll just come at this time i just want to dedicate that life that god has given back into his hands [Music] breathe [Music] [Music] and we just learn we want to dedicate lord this life is brother grace and sister rebecca your god their desires lord in the dedication of their life you would guide them and direct him lord caller and my father for you know the purpose you know lord the mystery what lays o god in little sophia's line and lord even though the attributes of father and mother would lay there within them but the lord their desires you would guide him in directed lord you're a personal god and you deal with each of us lord in a very personal way so lord we just would ask god for your leadership and guidance lord for them pray that you would just keep your hand upon little sophia mayor heart oh god always remain tender lord father when your hands now we ask you just keep your hand upon your father in the name of jesus christ amen everybody love the lord it's so good to be in the house of the lord so glad to be gathered together and those are sounds those sounds of the babies crying hey we like to hear it especially since i don't got to get up but we just we just love the lord and just so thankful so happy for uh brother drake and sister rebecca uh likewise for brother adam and sister bo as well and so well we just let's turn our attention to the word of the lord we we've come here to hear from god this morning and i believe he knows just exactly what we need amen and so we just ask that the lord will just take brother alexander magoulis and just use him in a special way we're so thankful that brother alexander and sister maria that they would come and the family and so we just want to pull on the gift of god god is mindful you know brother branham put it just simply like this in spiritual food and due season he said now he said there's a gift he said that god has placed in my life and he said god has gifted you to believe and he said now what happens between those two gifts he said god himself comes down and embodies himself so what takes place i'm getting a ringing up here so what takes place is is a real sovereign work of god and brother brown said it just as simple he said that's the secret food we realized we could have went there could have been other places that we could have went to and you know how it is you can hear talks or you can hear somebody speak but we've come here to hear the word of the lord amen we've come to hear from god and to know that god is mindful of our need he's a very personal god and he's mindful so let's just approach it in that way whatever you've got to care and and truly every one of us we've got needs or we've got something on our heart let's just put it on the altar of god and let's just believe for god to come on the scene and move in a very special way because though we may not feel anything that's not that doesn't make any difference what matters is is lord let me be in that position as we were talking last week that faith can drop into my heart for whatever the situation is amen don't you love him amen let's just let's just welcome the lord here to come and just speak to us and we're just thankful to have brother alexander if we maybe could sing i'm not going to ask you to stand because he may ask you to sit but well let's just sing hear a song amazing grace how sweet the sound no matter how far along it's still amazing grace it's still amazing grace [Music] like me [Music] was [Music] grace [Music] and grace my fears [Music] [Applause] [Music] and we've been there 10 000 years let's sing that verse [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we go last [Music] god's praise sing praise god now hallelujah god oh praise god [Applause] praise god praise god hallelujah hey man let's give the lord a round of applause just give him praise this morning he's been faithful [Applause] i'll tell you what that song just like the verse says it means it means more to me now i think than it did when i first it was precious when i first realized it but when you realize even as a christian how many times you make mistakes how many times you really need the lord it just has an even greater meaning to you as time goes on so we thank god that his faithfulness he is always faithful amen and i just want to say this morning i sure appreciate brother paul and the songs that he's saying you know he made that comment about his memory he's he shouldn't be that old already and most of you laugh because you know that it just gets worse as you go on some of you are laughing because you're looking at me saying well what do you know about it so if it's that bad there i mean i don't know i mean sometimes i don't even know why what i what i'm doing like i'm just driving down the road and i'm like oh i'm going the wrong direction well i'm the only ones ever done that anyway god's faithful though but i appreciate the the songs that were sung especially you know i was just back there looking at my notes and i thought well i might not have to preach today if you keep singing these songs i love i love it when a plan comes together and i don't usually see my own ever come together but i've seen gods come together i just i love watching it come together because i believe that the spirit and the word of god there's a harmony that exists and when you see everybody come into the harmony of the word uh it's it's just a beaut it's beautiful to watch how god unfolds things you know i was just on the way here i was looking at uh brother graham talked about jehoshaphat and ahab they they sought out the different prophets and they had each prophesied things and jehoshaphat says well isn't there one more he was looking for somebody because there's something in him said you know what this isn't quite where it needs to be and even when that prophet said well go and do what you want the lord's with you said no i told you tell me what the lord says he said well i saw the people scattered like sheep but that king he recognized that there's there has to be a harmony between what god has said and what he's always declared and i just i just as i get older especially preaching like an old man i don't know i keep doing this but i just really marvel at how god brings things together and i think it's relevant as even what we're looking at today in the scripture because how god brings things together so many times it's completely contrary to how we try to piece things together and uh when we learn just to lay those things aside and look at the lord and what the lord's trying to do it makes your life a lot easier among other things and so we just want to yield to god's purpose uh you know i was thinking about it on the way here there's there's three things that we look at when we look at how things are it's how we think things ought to be and then there's how things ought to be and then there's how god wants them to be and our desire is that we have all three of those in harmony we want our will to be what his will is to change the situation what it's supposed to be and so we just desire that if you have your bibles before i might as well take a text if i want to preach to you huh [Laughter] i was overseas if you want to stand here the book of ecclesiastes is the third chapter i tell you when i was overseas one time you probably heard this story but i was overseas one time and this this guy got up to preach and i tell you what he was having a good time i i maybe not so much but he just went on and on and on for about 45 minutes before he took his text i was i was timing him too and uh i just thought well praise the lord maybe we'll get to the word of god today so we want to look at the word of the lord today ecclesiastes the third chapter we're gonna read the first eight verses then we're gonna turn to the book of joshua after this and uh ecclesiastes chapter three and we'll start in the first verse it says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down any time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones than a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to getting the time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to rand and a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace and if you turn me to the book of josh with the third chapter here then we'll just read verses 12 to 17. now i had a bookmark so i got there right away but if you're there say amen josh of the third chapter verse 12 it says and joshua's speaking here he says now therefore take ye twelve men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe of man and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of jordan the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heap and it came to pass when the people were moved from their tents to passover jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people and as they that bear the ark were come unto jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water it says this and this actually where i want to come from here for jordan overflowed all his banks at the time of harvest it says that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon a heap very far from the city adam that is besides zaraton and those that came down toward the sea of the plain even the salts he failed were cut off and the people passed over right against jericho and the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan and all the israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over jordan let's just bow our heads for word of prayer heavenly father lord i thank you for the scripture that was read this this at this time lord and i just pray father you'd come and do your mighty and your strange work in our midst lord may you take the words that were read the words of this bible and cause them to live in our sight cause a a great power of revelation to move among the hearts and the lies of your believers even right now lord to recognize and to move and to yield to the mighty plain and purpose that you've laid out for us in this age lord as you bless the reading of your word and you bless each of these we pray that your great name will be magnified in our midst and lord we just give you all the praise and the glory we commit ourselves this people our time now into your hands that you might have your way for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and amen god bless you you're seated i'd like to take a thought i actually didn't really know what i was going to title this uh just a few minutes ago but i guess i'm just going to title it in time of war or a season of war and uh we look at this and brother bran makes a statement here in the sermon as i was with moses he says that the jordan was three or four times its size he said it was spooky horrible looking muddy but joshua said god said within three days we're going over and we're going over he says now the clergy would say now wait a minute joshua we are educated men we are smart many of us here are engineers from egypt we know how to do these things i love the expertise of these men we know how to do these things so we'll just wait a little while until the stream clears up and we can walk across it isn't that much easier he says but joshua said i don't care what you think god said three days we're going over and we're going over he says we're going over in three days he says watch what joshua did what did he put first amen your leadership is determined by what you put first amen he says what did he put first the clergy no sir he put the word first he said you take that ark and all you priests he says stay away from him he says get behind it don't try to lead it let it lead you he says that's the trouble today we try to get ahead of the word and bypass and make the word to fit this to the word to fit that he says bless your hearts what we need today is to follow the word amen i believe uh we're living in a time amen we live in different seasons and and we know this earth and humanity there there's subject different seasons but i believe that we're living in a as the prophet would say the greatest time for the believer it's a marvelous hour and i believe if we're going to do something for the lord to this is the hour to do something for the lord if we're ever going to serve god amen if we're ever going to commit ourselves fully into the hand of god for god's purpose it's today that we should do it amen i hope that for each of us here today we're more committed to the purpose of god today than we were in 2020 i pray we're more committed to god today than we were two or three or four years ago i hope that we can look at things that are going on the earth today and circumstances and say you know what despite all these things i am more committed i am more sold out i am more purposed in my heart to follow the word of god today than i've ever been before can i get a witness we're we are more established we've got more promises there's a greater revelation that's been made available us today and then we're not in a we're not in a time of retreat we're in a time of moving forward we're not in a time of dispossession of our own inheritance we are here to dispossess the inhabitants that have taken what belongs to us healing is our promise deliverance is our promise the power and the manifestation of this world that's our promises we are here to possess and to dispossess what the enemy has taken over amen i believe we're living in our and and let me say it this way i believe there was a great anticipation that morning in the camp when the water began to roll away because they'd heard stories about what god had done they heard tales about what god had promised but this day they were crossing over they weren't going to be sitting there ringing their hands saying i can't wait for this to happen one day but there was a recognition when the waters began to move back and the foot of that priest fell upon that river and it drove the waters back the things that we've talked about the things that we've longed for the things that we've expressed that we've heard mommy and daddy talk about those are no longer things we're just going to look forward to this is now a present truth in our lives we're no longer just trying to find or wandering we have entered in to a possession and i believe for the bride of jesus christ today where you're sitting at this morning i believe we are possessors of all things according to the promise of god amen so many people are looking for something amen they're looking one day god's going to do great things today god's going to do great things well one day there's going to be revival there's revival today but we're looking for the third poll to be manifested you're hearing it today it's the opening of this word that we're ministering this message has come to give you a full possession not a promise of something that's out there somewhere but life is entered into the body the power of god has come quickening power has entered in to the body of jesus christ yes hallelujah oh we're waiting for this great falling away we're great waiting for this thing we're waiting for that and remember the brim said they were doing the same thing in the wilderness they were waiting on god they were waiting on god and god was waiting on them i tell you what if i was running behind at a meeting or something with we hate doing that as americans especially you go overseas they're always late but americans we're conditioned to it if we gotta be there at three o'clock and it's 301 we we're we're sweating we're getting worked up we're worried we're gonna miss something because we've been conditioned that way this is a natural people we don't want to be late and how i would dread to think that i would make god that i made my brother that'll make my sister wait on me amen listen brother when he sees a vision at three o'clock in the morning he's a visionary vision of palestine and he sees that he says bless god praise the lord over in that land just beyond the jordan river he said that's where all the promises lie he said they're already there amen what did joshua come to do he didn't come to to just continue moses ministry in the wilderness but the the furtherance of the ministry was to take them in to the promised possession amen god was going to magnet he said i'm going to magnify you this day tweety told the province paradox as he did with joshua i'm gonna magnify your name this day and then the people are no longer just they're just observing the promised land from a mountaintop somewhere but they've actually already entered in through the baptism of the holy ghost he's placing them in a possession and brother brown in the same vision he sees that great mamba snake and when he goes to look for it the first thing he says he comes into the vision and he sees the people are scared and he asks the question what's everybody so afraid of that's what i'm asking myself this morning what's everybody so afraid of i understand why the world's afraid i understand why the unbelievers and the nations of this earth i understand why they're afraid why are the believers afraid this morning what are they afraid of amen well hallelujah listen we're living in a time this scripture says men's hearts would fail for fear we're in it i'm not waiting for it listen you've got more antidepressants you've got more psychology you've got more madness and insanity in this hour than there's ever been before social media and government and politics they're bombarding you constantly every day and it's destroyed the human faculty to reason and to think like a rational human being so they can't even tell what gender they are they can't even tell their left hand from the right what they call goodness evil what they call evil is good they've got no idea i don't understand why they feel that way but you and i are the believer i understand when israel showed up to the promised land why the jebusites and the hittites and i understand why they would be scared but the believer's not scared the believers coming into their possession the believers rising up today what they're going to possess is greater now than what they've ever possessed before hey man it's interesting so many believers they've they've become disillusioned with the world i'm thinking praise god it's about time it's about time they look at cobra they look at elections well i'm going to take my liberty here amen i just love it some of these believers i get i get people that send me this stuff or whatever oh we're going to do this and the president's going to do that and this time like whatever yeah hey man listen i understand voting i don't want to pay higher taxes i get that remember god's economy doesn't change based on who's in the white house god's program doesn't change based on which representative gets voted in here or there god sets up kings and he tears them down well praise the lord you get these brothers i got this book this brother he comes you know what he said he's looking he's looking at politics he said this country's done for her i'm thinking praise god you finally got a revelation decades after a prophet preached it it's done for her it's not coming back amen somebody well this country's done for you you know the world's just falling apart yep he preached at least uh what six times i think four times it it's actually falling apart again amen yeah it's falling apart we've been preaching that for years you understand the very things that upset people that worry the world is the very vindication that this bible and this message are true because we were told it would be that way well they rigged an election they viewed that in the 60s brother ramsey he said it's already over so why would we get upset about that because the same voice that told us it's over the same voice that said america's doom is the same voice that said there's going to be a sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ it doesn't matter what satan's even possesses and throws at him there's going to be a people by the grace of god under there the final voice under the messenger to the final edge we're so big not people not worried what's going to happen on the 20th well i don't know what's going to happen on the 20th but i know it's going to happen to me i'm going up i'm rising up i'm not backing down i'm not pulling away i'm moving forward with the kingdom of god this country's just gonna be a bunch of ashes at the end of the day but you and i we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved i can stand as the apostle and boss of death where is thy sting who craves where is thy victory listen these men suffered under persecutions and and trials and and all kinds of debauchery they saw the rise of the antichrist spirit in their day their heads were put in chopping blocks in there today hey man i love the way the profit dramatizes this crossing of the jordan river because these men were so busy telling joshua why it can't be well this has to happen and this is a circumstance that's in the way this has to take place amen i'm going somewhere praise the lord well but this has to line up with this and i have this song listen we've studied this we're educating men we've got degrees i've studied this thing to and fro and back and forward and i've got i've got it figured out well don't figure yourself wrong about then hey man listen these men had every a rational excuse for why they couldn't cross over the river's too high and this isn't going to work but i want you to understand that the circumstances that were hindrance to them and then were the very circumstances that declared this was the time to cross over well look moses just passed on and the waters are really high and look at the world today look at its condition well this has to happen and the church has to do this and the church has to stop doing that and we're looking for all these things to add up before we're going to believe god amen someone i think about this because people are doing this they try to rationalize i'm thinking why why are we trying to validate the plan of god we don't have to validate the plan of god god's already vindicated it we don't have to validate it amen you know it's like i always tell people you know they're looking for certain things to come up they're waiting for california they're waiting for this and they're waiting for that i'm thinking if what god has done and what god has said has not already moved you into possess your land what do you think is going to move you well one day we'll get right with god what's going to change right well one day there's going to be a manifestation what could god do that he hasn't already done we've got some idea in our mind some circumstance like those men this can't be the day we believe it's going to happen but it just can't be right now because there's these circumstances in our way that are hindering us but joshua didn't look at circumstances he looked at the season that he was living in see the spiritual believer doesn't look at circumstances they look at the season they are living in he says of course the banks are overflowing jordan always overflows his banks in the harvest in other words it's harvest time of course the waters are going to be high amen it's the end of course people are going to be falling away of course people don't believe in the power of god of course the nations are breaking they're supposed to but for you and i that means this is the season of the harvest this is our overcoming you and i were born for such a time as this and the very circumstances that declared it was harvest time to joshua he could recognize now is the time to cross over because they'd put on quail they'd fed on man but they weren't going to do that in this land they were going to eat the old corn of the land now the only hallelujah the only way for them to do that is if the corn was at harvest time they're not going to go dig it out of the ground in its infancy there's got to be a mature harvest that's ready for a horse for them to eat so the harvest time is the only time they can cross over and survive so the very circumstances that they thought testified against them actually testified this is the hour of our possession we'll look at somebody say well i need this to happen to believe the message i'm waiting for this vindication i'm waiting for this and we'll sit there and rightfully so we'll look we'll look at me like well that's just ridiculous to do that but we'll do the same thing with the other promises of god well one day i'll get my deliverance one day i'll i'll have my joy back one day there'll be a revival in my church one day in my house and one day this you're doing the same thing you're hey man i thought i'd get a few more amens on that you're looking at the circumstances that you're living you're looking at all the same lost loved ones and uh and you're looking at sickness you're looking at politics and you're saying it can't be oh yes he can because for god to manifest his power to do these things those circumstances have to be present [Music] so you don't look at the circumstance the circumstance and say it can't be you look at the circumstance and say now is the time now it's not a time to back away this is a time of war we're declaring war on the power of satan this is the time we are going to possess our promises don't look at the circumstances and be dismayed and it should actually encourage you as a believer [Applause] listen whenever the devil lies you you are being cursed when the devil says you can't be saved you can't serve god you can't you want to be so encouraged because guess what he's still a liar you ought to be so encouraged when the devil says you can't because you can sit there and testify i can i already have by the grace of god i'm not just gonna make it i've already made it i'm not just gonna cross over one day i believe the message has already led us hallelujah people still waiting for the power of god they're waiting for quickening power to wait for the rain to fall quickly power open those seals with quicking power open those heels quickening power can restore your home quickening power can raise up your body quickening power can reach out to the lost because the only way the banks of the jordan could be falls if the rain fell there was an abundance of the power that quickened that harvest right in front of them and they looked at it and they saw a negative circumstance but joshua said this is the season of our overcoming hallelujah [Music] there was spiritual food there in due season it you couldn't have had it in the summertime you couldn't have had in wesley's day you couldn't have luther's day it had to be in this hour and the believer today like joshua if you're spiritually minded you're not looking at the circumstances well this has happened and this has taken place and what about this those things all those modern events they're made clear by prophecy it's the lord's doing you can't resist his will you can't change it it's got to be what you can do is come into a harmony with joshua you can get behind the ark and let it lead you into a place that's greater than you've ever been before [Music] amen i believe this is the hour the prophet daniel spoke of your day he said in that day his people god's people they'll do exploits amen don't put that off till next week don't make that something that you're looking for well if some great man will rise on the scene some great person the great ones already here jesus christ he's the same yesterday today and forever we put too much confidence in men right now because that's what most of our circumstances come from well this person did this and this is going on is there any one of them that can defeat the council of the almighty is there some man that can outsmart god these people they're getting ready to go over they've seen some great things but they were gonna see some great things amen i believe you and i here today you've seen god do great things but i believe god's fixing to do great things today i believe he's the same amen i'm not talking about me i'm not talking about us as men and women i'm talking about the power of god that's in our midst don't put him outside the door like they did in laodicea he's here he's present he's an ever-present help in trouble and that what david said psalm 27 in the time of trouble if there was ever a time of trouble it's now if you've ever had trouble this is the time of trouble but that's when he'll hide you in the secret of his pavilion oh hallelujah there has to be a trouble for him to be the present help [Music] the very difficulties you're going through declare that he is with you [Music] amen they weren't just looking back to what happened with moses people do that well brother branham was here brother branham can't do anything more brother branham told you if jesus himself stood on this platform wearing this suit he could no more heal you than i could because he's already done it amen brother brandon never tried to point you to a historical ministry in his own life and that sure is not the will of god today but the same one that was with him is the same one that's in our midst today that's what the message is about amen this revelation declares the prophet says in the church e-book she can do the greater works and then she can not she will be not she could she can right now you already possess the ability if you can just catch it by revelation everything you need is here yeah now see it's one thing to enter into a possession to enter into the promised land it's another thing to find your place in that and then and not try to take somebody else's place or try to live in the glare of another day or try to be something that you're not amen because you're rest the rest is in the promise but where it's actually in your position in that promise because you can come into the promised land and you've got to fight on your hands amen there's still battles here we get this idea as christians that if we were really spiritual we'd have less battles in our lives we'd have less trials forget it you're living a daydream that has nothing to do with the kingdom of god you signed up for a battle you signed up to take the head off of that old devil and then you didn't come here for a picnic you signed up for war you might as well gird up your loins like a man you might as well put your shield on your sword on and put your armor on hey man cause guess what you're not getting through this without taking a few blows but praise god you've got armor it's meant to take the hitch you're building stuff that don't bluff what you've got can handle any fiery dart anything the enemy can throw at you you've got what it takes by the holy ghost you've got what it takes to withstand every fiery dart amen hallelujah we gotta find our that's where our rest is see once you find your place you're not tossed to the front like a child anymore you know what you're standing well i'm going off the beaten path here now but i was just ministering on this the other day you you watch certain people by the way praise god these steps i came up here i'm like that's real nice when you're five foot nine i don't get too close to you that's real nice though amen i was talking about this today you watch people even around the message and they float from one kind of a movement to one kind of idea to one thing to this to that we're gonna chase an anointing we're going to chase a ministry and they're always they're tossed to and fro and then what we need to do is get down and repent say god i'm supposed to have some discernment you said this bride's not going to be deceived why do we get caught up in certain things we ought to get down say god don't ever let a thing like that happen to me again we box from one idea to one man to this and that and we act like it's just normal but the christians ought to know what their place is there ought to be something so settled in us there should be something so driven down in our lives till nothing can move us off of it because listen if the devil can move you he'll move you if he can't push you up he'll bring you down he'll find a way to move if there's anything there yes sir amen you've got to know that you know that you know god prophesied he manifested the promise this is my land i was ordained to overcome in 2021 i was retained to overcome this dark age of darkness and vanity and men's ideas yeah there's somebody here praise god somebody who's gonna make listen this is an age where nobody was supposed to make it but somebody's gonna make it because joshua told you we're following our joshua we follow this message because it come from joshua actually this message is your joshua yes sir brother yes sir amen yes sir yes sir brother says this hopefully it's familiar quote for you he says if you just rely on hope he says you hinder faith amen many of us today need to get out of the way of god amen we'll get into this way we'll get into that we'll follow this we'll we'll we've got all the best literature we've got all the best ideas get out of god's way amen your hope your ideas it's hindering faith well praise the lord he says hope looks for something way off but faith claims it right now see faith said god said so and it's mine somebody say it's mine god said so it's not just yours because you wanted it we're not a bunch of squatters now amen listen we are not robbing anyone amen the bible says let this mind be in you that was in christ who thought it not robbery to be he was god amen listen that's why the pharisees hated jesus they thought he was robbing god i didn't you've been a man you make yourself god saying god and i are one amen he wasn't robbing god that's who he was that's who you are if you can receive it you're not robbing anything from god you are the manifestation of his glory praise the lord god said so that's all i need the further i go on with the lord and the more i walked by faith i realize you know what god said so i don't need any additional qualifications i don't need another opinion god said so i mean quit listening to a popular opinion and culture tells you god said so therefore it's mine god said and that's all i need he said that settles it see i don't care if i'm still crippled i'm still blind if i'm still sick that don't have nothing to do with it i believe it anyhow it's mine right now yes sir you know i i've been blessed i said this to the glory of god i'm not saying this is a a boast but i've been blessed to travel and to see things i i i've seen god open the eyes of the blind i've got i watched god raised up cripples i watched devils cast out and it astounds me when i talk to people in church they say i wouldn't be great if god still did those things i'm thinking you're too late you're too late god still does those things he didn't change he didn't die in 1965 my god he's still alive he's still the same he's still present [Applause] that's right brother i asked him what are you looking for exactly well i don't know but i'll know when it comes no you won't because it's coming you missed it can you imagine natural people watching water roll back and priests walk in there saying well maybe someday and yet god has come and he's not just vindicated the message he's thoroughly vindicated it amen not once not twice hundreds of thousands of times god has vindicated this message and we're waiting for something to qualify it it's no different than than when la with the rich man and lazarus hey man when he was down there well if god would raise up the debt listen if they can't believe the law and the prophets that's why i'm going this way if if you can't believe it now what do you think is going to change it for you what thing is going to make it different there's nothing to do it's already finished just believe it see that's the problem we're waiting for rapturing faith we've done sales on the tapes all right and that is all it takes now if you listen to tapes if you listen to what he said it's not just on the tape anymore i believe there's a people on the earth right now rapturing faith is already in them because they heard the word and when they heard the word they believe the word then it must be in them now this how can rapture and faith be in this people where else would it be if everything you have in english did you even the rapture that it's got to be in you now see now there's a difference between faith and believing see faith's a noun you can have faith but faith without works is dead but when you begin to believe when you begin to act and live like it's true not just saying it is a lofty platitude and just a good thing we put on the law well praise god those footsteps of a good man order the lord can you believe that when you're walking through the valley of the shadow of death his footsteps are still ordered even when i can't see he's a light to my feet he's a left in my path i had no idea how i got to 2021 my life my plans my ambitions did not bring me here this morning but god has ordered the steps the steps of a man from ohio he's ordered the steps of some people from sheffield to be here today because the rapture is taking place it's already working in us something on the inside is prevailing over that which is on the outside let's not just have faith let's believe let's put it into action let's quit talking about like it's the doctrine of a thing but let's let this thing live he says hope says god said so and i'm expecting to get it sunday [Music] we're gonna have revival someday sunday gonna overcome this addiction someday i'm gonna be an overcoming christian i'm not gonna be a roller coaster christian someday i'm gonna be settled someday i'm gonna be uh more mature he says you see i'm expecting someday as long as satan notice he's doing it now as long as satan can put you off to another day that's as good as he wants [Music] hey man i'm saying something there now satan's not trying to convince anybody here today probably that the message is wrong that the bible doesn't work that god is a lot that's not what he's trying to convince you of he's just trying to get you to kind of put it off a little bit that's why the bible says don't be slothful but diligent as partakers of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises amen because faith takes possession faith doesn't hope so someday because that's exactly the plan of satan one day i'll get right with the lord if you can't get right with the lord today why would you think you'd be able to do it tomorrow or the next day or the next day what circumstances are going to change that that's right he says that's right that's as good as he wants you'll never get it a double-minded man's an unstable he's unstable in all his ways let not that man think he'll receive anything from the lord he says just believe i wants to believe just believe you've got it right now it's your personal property faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen is that right he says faith acts now now's the time he says it's positive listen brother ramp said one day this church it will know its position then the rapture will go now i don't know when the church is going to find its position but for me i'm not waiting till the next day to find out my position lord you show me today what is your purpose in me it's got to start somewhere when they crossed over that promise into that promised land over that jordan listen somebody had to take their land first right they didn't all get it at once but somebody said you know what i'm gonna take mine i won't want it belongs to me we're gonna fight together we're gonna stand together to my brother to my sister till they get a breakthrough till they can take possession listen when i see one of you overcome and been blessed by god and god does something for you i rejoice because i'm saying to myself that's my promise to you it's not just for me it's for the body of christ how we ought to rejoice when one of us is honored amen somebody's got to take their promise hey man well maybe if reuben does it or maybe benjamin or this and i'll get interested amen see our attitude is the problem because the right mental attitude brings every promise to pass amen let's not hinder faith all right let's get behind it hey man what place is the church teaching places the church he said amen i believe that's why god give the holy ghost the scripture says he'll lead and guide you into all truth now if i ask how many here's got the holiest day i'm not going to ask that but hopefully every hand would go up amen or almost every hand if you've got the holy ghost that he promised to teach you all things he promised to lead and guide you to all truth he's never going to leave you he's never going to forsake you he's never going to doubt his own word he's never going to change his mind about his word amen that's what this message come to do it come to equip a group of believers with the maturity it takes to to to overcome liability amen this message is more than just a bunch of rules to me it's more than some good stories about squirrels and possums and people being healed in different meetings it's the manifested power of god to me when i see god working the life of brother branham i don't just say well praise god he could do that for that man but god is not a respecter of persons this message tells me who christ is you say well that's really important yeah it is because who he is is who you are what he is declaring about himself is what he has declared about you listen christ never fails christ never lies amen the word in you might talk about your flesh now christ in you will never fail when you fail he'll be there to pick you back up you might fall seven times and he'll pick you back up every time you're gonna have to fight brother ram said you have to fight for every inch all right i don't know i don't know i'm i'm i'll throw myself here i don't know where i got this idea that uh we're just gonna kind of breeze through this thing like we're gonna fake it till we make it that don't work in the kingdom you're not faking anything i mean you're gonna have battles you're gonna have fights it's gonna hurt some days you're gonna be limping out from the fight you had last night one morning out of the tent and my man i don't even feel like fighting today guess what your enemy's not taking the day off later she's not taking a day off hey man you and i can't take a day off we part-time christians we're full-time believers we're soldiers we're lined up we're ready to fight i'm ready to take my the land paul says in colossians chapter two he says beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain to see after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ for in him christ dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete where in him not in your church not an organization not your ideas not the family you come out of you're completely in hand amen now listen if you're complete in him that means that you're not incomplete i know that's really tough for some people if you're complete in him that means that you're not incomplete not in him i think i did that right you're complete in other words you lack nothing and pausing beware when somebody comes to try to say well you lack you need something you don't have what you need to overcome batman's lying to you you've got everything you need in this land this message i don't have to venture out and find another idea to supplement what the prophet said amen i believe that'll preach amen i don't have to find some other idea to say well if i take this and i add this to the message we've really got something yeah you've got a hybrid seed and it might get you a big looking crop but there's death in it it'll never reproduce the life i've got what i need god made sure it was provided for me that's not profit he wanted to be a trapper he didn't want to have to preach this message he knew he lose 10 000 friends but god made sure there was a message for you and i in 2021 that we could stand here and know that god has called us god has ordained us some men come on and say well well you lack you don't have that man's lying do you man not hopefully not in this ball but a man stand in the pulpit and say well would you need this you need my thing and this i don't need anything you have to give me well i know that sounds rude but the truth anyhow i don't need anything a man has to give me my bow ass is taking care of me i don't need to go into some other field i don't need to find some other redeemer i'll find my boss he'll take good care of me he makes sure the reapers lifted that left a little extra for me so much what goes on in churches today they're spoiled through philosophy they're to see it's like i was talking about today you look at you you look at charismatic churches these big churches and they're well we're going to have revival one day and their own words testify against them they're dead think about that think about that we need revival that means you're dead one day there's going to be a great awakening so you're asleep their own words testify against them they lack they don't have but you and i that's not our testimony we've been enlightened by the seven thunders those are revelations of awakening the bride we're not an ignorant we're not enormous we are aware we're not like the children of the night they're overtaken by the night we're the children of the light this thing has not overtaken us unawares hallelujah like i say time and time again people get caught up looking at the wrong thing hey man they're looking at the wrong thing we look at adoption we look at the message we're looking at the wrong metrics we're looking at the wrong measurements we look at man's ideas well this is how a christian ought to look this is what they should do and this is the kind of ministry and don't even line up with the word he tells this story several times in the message and i don't know it's like i go to churches and they're not familiar with it sometimes i'm like man you think i come up with a new doctrine but brotherhood tells a story about a man he was a car salesman i don't know if anybody knows this hopefully you do but this man was a car salesman and his wife should become a christian and he said you know i didn't go to church i didn't do all these things but but i didn't mind my wife doing i support her doing it and he said he was in the office one day and sold a car and he went back to get the key to make sure they had the key and he walked in and he pulled out a tract they said where will you spend eternity and so he just looked at him well i'm just going to toss it or whatever but he looked at it again and he read it again and he started to wonder said i'm a 40 year old man i've he said i've got to settle this yes sir hey man listen we've got to settle things in our life because we try to run from trials we try to run from circumstances we try to run from the calling of god same thing adam did we try to run we tried to put it off and listen you'll tire out before your trials do you get weary before your problems do you've got to settle things this man said i've got to settle this so he starts going to meetings he goes to billy graham's they said if you if you accept the lord jesus christ is your savior you say this sinner's prayer you do all these things he said that'll settle it he said i did all that it didn't settle it right he said i went to the methodist i went to the nazarene and they told me if you shout that'll settle it he said that didn't settle it right amen he said it went down i think was i think it was all robert said it's pentecostal meaning i went down there and said if you speak in tongues and you just that'll settle it he said i spoke in tongues he said i still didn't settle it finally they said one day that he would not voice a healing said go over to brother branham's house he'll help you settle in he'll be able to tell you if you did something in your life somewhere or there's something off he'll be able to help you out with it so he goes to brother brown and he tells him this and he begins to tell brother brown about this man see if there's any hope for his condition is there any hope for me is there a way for me to get out of my condition because i don't want you to notice this man's condition was in his own mind because brother brandon begins to speak to this man and he says listen billy graham told you the truth but not all the truth he said the methods they told you the truth but not all the truth or obviously told the truth but not all the truth he said all those things are attributes of christ is it to receive christ is to receive the person the lord jesus then these other things then these other things will take place he said well you think i've ever done it or do you think i ever could do it i said you've already done it brother [Applause] so you were going on a road hating religion no religion and you looked at a little sign and something said to you two years ago you've saw you've hunted said what happened i said what does conversion mean turned around you were going one time without anything hating god hating religion going on ignoring it all at once right there at your desk yes sir well i thought i'd get a few more amens on that right where you were sitting right there at your desk you turned back up the road hunting god seeking god what happened you was converted he threw his arms around me started weeping said brother brown i've had it all this time he said that's right that's exactly right he said you know i went to all of them this is profound now and they told me i crossed the separate listen these men didn't give him any hope at all you didn't cross the separating line said you was a prophet you could tell me what was wrong watch what brother bram says he says you don't need a prophet the word settled that praise god i think today some of us just need to realize the word is settled whatever you're wrestling with whatever you're dealing with well brother brandon was here if so-and-so was here listen the word settled it for you and sell it even if you didn't realize it like this man yes sir many times oh hallelujah just like them crossing the jordan we going we're looking for something ignorant that we possess it already come on brother you think of all the rich and powerful influential men in the world today and they're staying at five-star hotels and they've got jumbo jets and they've got money and they've got all this stuff and they've got problems and they don't know how to deal with it they're like that rich young ruler right down there you get a dollar general for uh for a dollar dollar general for the dollar tree right there's a bible right there's what they need right there they stay in hotels and the word of god's land right there how many times in our own life we're waiting for an answer right it's like i said i said this years ago i said people they're waiting on a phone call from god and here he doesn't send him a letter god's already told you that you've got what you need he's already made promises to you amen many people like this man they're going around trying to settle the issue what you need is already here it's already done you've got to recognize god settled that for you [Music] they're waiting for that what's that man waiting for he's went for a sensation or something well praise the lord well i don't know why i make apologies for this i'm not going to i guess you know you you look at i try to think how to say it you look at people you know i was talking to a sister years ago and we were praying for her for a certain condition and she began to tell me well a certain minister told me years ago that when you pray you'll feel this certain thing and this certain thing will happen and i'm thinking that that man told you wrong you might feel that you might not feel a thing but his word is true regardless with his stripes you're already here [Music] i look in my own life and maybe this is my experience but when god's done some of the most profound or powerful things that god's ever done my life i wasn't emotional about it all right i actually i stood there like i was watching god do something now i got pretty happy about it afterwards don't get me wrong i was like man that was cool man that's awesome but listen the emotion wasn't a vindication to me neither was my own intellectual idea when god comes and god does something it's completely contrary to my own thinking yet it's exactly the word of god whether the sensation or no sensation it don't matter when god brings it god brings it to pass this man was waiting for something but what he needed was that bride of jesus christ quit waiting for god to do something for you when he cried out on the cross it's finished it wasn't safe 2000 years or 10 years ago or 20 years ago you were saved that day at calvary the price was already paid whatever you have need of today god has given it into your hands see most people they live in condition brother graham calls it spiritual amnesia we forget these things that's why we need to be reminded hopefully not just on sunday or just wednesday we need to be reminded every day amen what brings spiritual amnesia when you get halt between two opinions well i know god said this but spiritual amnesia the christian doesn't have to qualify what god said the christian takes him at his word because he's never lied and he's never failed amen don't let the enemy take from you don't let a preacher or whatever don't let anybody take from you god has already given you something i mean it's what you already possess and the enemy wants to rock listen he can't rob you unless you have it in the first place that's right listen nobody here can come and rob a million dollars for me after service i ain't got it but your enemies comes a thief to steal to kill and destroy because he realizes who's got the goods there's some possessors here today they possess eternal life they're holding it in their bosom they are possessors of it right now and the devil would love nothing more than to come and take it from you but you know what he's got no rights on my property [Music] that's right i got a big old sign up not in my actual yard spiritually speaking i got this big old sign up on my yard trespassers will be shot on side don't let the enemy step one foot on your ground it's time to serve him notice you don't belong here get out of my house i didn't ask you here i didn't invite you here i'm sure not going to make you comfortable here god give me what i need the same one that begun a good work in you he's faithful to finish it hey man listen it's him that works in you to will and to do his good pleasure not even your own idea amen praise the lord well hallelujah i thank god for all his gifts and all his blessings the only character is through a victory that means you got a fight on your hands you're never gonna get it without a fight hey man you're just gonna have to fight like i said inch by inch hey man and i don't want to re and i think i i touched on this a little bit last time i was preaching about the masterpiece but i want you to realize he said i'll give it to you little by little amen sometimes god gives you your promise just a little bit at a time don't get discouraged with that slow progress is not no progress slow progress is not the same as no progress god did that for a reason with them that's the same thing that isaiah said he'll give you knowledge he'll give you revelation little by little moses told the people i'll give you the land little by little why so that it won't be overrun see god's not interested in just giving you the land he wants you to live there we get so caught up trying to get somewhere but god's not worried about getting you there he wants you to live there these promises this purpose of god this possession it's more than just a place we're going to visit we're not just coming in for a vacation i mean i don't come to church to go on vacation for my problems some people treat church like it's a treat religion like it's a drug it's just a way of escape from my problems it's a way to get away from this for a few hours listen i have to ordain to live in this place i want them to live this gospel not just preach it god doesn't want to just give us a visitation he wants us to be a habitation [Applause] and if you're making any progress at all it might be an inch a day but god gives you that inch and you don't ever have to give it back see that's the difference between just giving you a piece of dirt on the ground and saying this is your eternal inheritance whatever you take possession of you never have to give it back [Music] once you possess that it's yours for eternity amen the devil will say well yeah you you had this joy yesterday you had peace but listen this is a different day but the promise is still the same god is still the same i don't have to forfeit one centimeter to him amen praise the lord god doesn't want us to have a here today gone to mark kind of experience amen god wants to work something deep and transformative in our life amen more than just a bunch of blessings we're called to live and man i don't i like i said i want i want this to live in me amen it's been ordained to live through flesh and human vessels amen it's there's some vessel somewhere it's got to do that amen praise the lord listen i i like getting excited i like praising god i like jumping but don't jump any higher than you can live amen i'm not interested so much how high you can jump how high can we live this thing how much can we surrender to this thing are we really taking god in his word are we making excuses yeah well maybe someday i'll be the kind of christian brother bam talks about that oh look at them disciples brother branson of old how they just moved by the holy ghost amen i don't want that to stay in the history book i don't want that to stay on tape from decades ago let it live lord today in this building in this house let it live through me lord it's a time for war it's a time to draw your sword and quit making compromises with the devil it's a time to cut through to every promise for the british had a strong arm of faith it'll cut now take that sword and cut through to every promise of god you see where i start start with what's in front of you got an enemy here and then cut this one down and we'll cut the next one down hey man each step hey man listen if you can kill an enemy with every step then you can take a thousand steps and kill a thousand enemies it becomes like breathing you just cut him down oh here comes the enemy again well that was a mistake on his part hey man listen one should chase a thousand and two should chase ten thousand amen [Music] i don't want to just preach a little better or look a little better i want to live a little higher if i only live this much higher than yesterday praise god i'm on my way up the countdown's finished we're taking liftoff we're moving up this bride is not going down don't let the world ever tell you that listen this message is more hated and persecuted today than it was a year ago or two years ago or 20 years ago or 30 years ago and don't ever get in your mind that somehow you're just gonna be accepted by people one day it's never gonna happen but you're accepted by god and that's what matters amen the scripture in the scripture in mark chapter 11. jesus says he says have faith in god actually if you look at the scripture in the greek it says have the faith of god have god's faith amen he doesn't give you his faith see that's what i'm saying we get this well i just don't have the faith for this well if you've got god's faith you do yes sir well praise the lord listen jesus own disciples came to him one day said lord increase our faith he's like no if you've got faith the size of a mustard seed you can speak to a tree you can speak to my it's not that you need amen don't let the devil lie to you listen if you don't have the faith to overcome today it's not going to come later through some other message there's not some other testament or some other word of the lord that has to come you've got it and the enemy will he'll try to bully say well you don't have faith for that well maybe i don't but god does and god's in me and god believes the promise god in you is more than enough to meet the challenge of this hour [Applause] if you've got god on the inside of you you're more than a match for the devil you're more than a match for the world you're more than a match for the eyes the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and the lust of the flesh he's more than a match god does not hallelujah god is not contending with the enemy today he has already defeated him he has already overcome the world let's quit acting like we've got someone just don't want me to make it we're only one what are you talking about you say this mountain right not if he says it or your pastor or the deacon or brother out if you say be thou removed and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you've spoken will come to pass you can have it brother brown's talking about this when he's out in the woods one day he talks about this scripture he says well i thought why does that scripture keep coming to me when i can't preach on it i've been there you know i i've had a thought coming before i'm like i mean i can't preach this it was it was years later the lord's like remember that thing amen there's a season to it sometimes amen see we're trying to discern the season of things not the circumstances around them because when you begin to discern the season around a thing that's when you begin to have an understanding of the harmony of god's purpose he said how can i i could he said i could not go go before a congregation and try to explain that scripture they said well i sat there a little bit i thought well there's only one thing to do if i'm ever called to preach on that subject here's the way i'll do it see he had his own idea well i'm going to do this he said well jesus told the disciples and gave them that authority that was about a year and six months before the atonement was made so if it wasn't in the atonement was on the other side of the atonement so if anybody ever asked me that question i'll just tell them it was on the other side of the atonement it's the only thing i know because jesus was still living the atonement was not made and he was not wounded for our transgressions nor by his stripes were healed yet so he just gave them that power on the other side of the atonement he said but then all of a sudden something spoke to me and said what about the prophets well i begin to see it then see it's different when you see it it began to unfold to me what do you think had taken place in the meeting when you're standing listen he'd done this before and he didn't even recognize it how many times in our own lives as christians does god do something in our life like that man and we don't even recognize each other oh that was god all this time and we thought it was just us we thought it was just a whim or we thought it was just something and here was god doing something and you can look back and read this even when i didn't realize it god was doing something with my life in my life he how many god has spoken things in your life and you don't you sit there i don't even know why i said that and yet it was god doing it yes sir brother yes sir very good that's it's a it's an amazing thing when you can recognize god has done things in your life you're like oh i didn't realize it was god maybe the other person didn't realize it was god at the time oh praise the lord amen he says this he says do you think you're the one who knows those people do you think that it's you that can predict and say to those people that you're going to do a certain certain thing and a certain certain thing has to happen a certain certain thing will happen to you do you think that that's you saying it he says oh my it means so much it never left me i love it when god really brings something together in life it'll never leave you when you really have a revelation of god as jesus christ is your savior personally the baptism the holy ghost that never leaves you you might this this body might be eaten up by skin worms you might go through sickness you might even lose your mind amen god forbid but no matter what happens that'll never leave you amen i thought surely not lord it's you well then who do you think it's talking you think it's you talking he says no do you think it was the prophets talking had you had not you just got through preaching on the subject that the prophets were so anointed with the holy spirit that it wasn't them that done the speaking it was the holy spirit in them crying out then whatever you say if you're anointed i really feel to qualify that here for just a second if you're anointed wouldn't it be you saying it it would be the holy spirit saying it i think that's a very important qualification and i minister i think on the idea of inspiration here a while back at this church even and that's why i feel that way because you don't exercise this authority through your flesh it's not exercised by by by your emotions it's not exercised by your own intellectual understanding and many people in this message we can talk about authority we can talk about the the how god ordains certain things but it's one thing to just say well god's given us authority what kind of authority amen listen a man is omnipotent if he's submitted to god he's not omnipotent like it's a knife he just swings it around like you know what i'm going to see the dead race day well i want to be you know it don't work that way when god comes and gives an inspiration it might even bypass your own understanding but yet it's god that's done it amen and when that inspiration comes listen jesus himself said i can do nothing except the father shows me first now if it's like that with our lord jesus why would it be any different with you and i now how god reveals that to you might be different than how he reveals it to me yep the way god revisit to you might be different than the way he revealed to you before sometimes god will deal with you in a different way than he's done before to see if you're able to if you're willing to submit to the plan of god because many times we are caught up in the form or or how something is done and it's got to be done this way glasses i can i can do more than you can think i can do exceeding abundantly above that amen right so it's not something that's emoti and i've see you've probably seen these people they get intellectually or emotionally motivated and we start making these declarations there's no power in that when god gives the inspiration amen when you can discern us the voice of god and speak the will of god that's what brings it to pass these prophets the bible says they speaking old time not by their own will it wasn't the will of men they were moved by the holy ghost this bride she's moved by the holy ghost she's got thus saith lord and she knows what he wants done with him that means she also knows what he doesn't want done with it that's right brother says well i thought well that's right if the person through the atonement sanctified by the blood of jesus christ can live into such a sphere with god so close he can be wrapped so completely in god by the blood of jesus it wouldn't be him talking amen it would be the holy spirit speaking those things he said and no more than i had said that the anointing of the holy spirit struck me like i never had it before in all my life god knows that i raised up to my feet yes sir and watch this i raised it to my feet i got scared what yeah i mean the holy ghost can do that yeah he can do that too yeah it's not always oh praise god i got the victory listen john felt down like a dead man daniel felt down like a dead man you don't know what it's going to do to you but it'll do something amen something said to me now this is the beginning of your new ministry now ask what you will and it shall be given to you you say why do you bring this up i believe his new ministry is our ministry because it's just a continuation of the son of man in the bride body so what he was doing there is what he's doing now he's giving inspiration he's speaking he's moving in the hearts of the believer to bring to pass amen if you say god's gonna take your mouth not just mine he's gonna take your mouth and make declarations and and he's going to say things things that might even bypass your own understanding and he's going to bring them to pass today i believe that's today because i believe god's always speaking maybe we don't always listen real well but god's always speaking [Music] if you can catch the voice of god today god is looking to do something with your tongue amen because death and life are in your tongue that's right listen brother and so when you become a christian you got a checkbook yes sir that checkbook jesus made a deposit for that at calvary and every redemptive promise everything that atonement is in that checkbook and jesus christ signed it at the bottom amen an adopted son of god after mount transfiguration he signed that checkbook and that checks is good it's good for any redemptive promise but brother ram said when a man when a son comes into his own adoption his name on the checkbook it's as good as daddy's we all believe that jesus christ's name on that book is as good as his father it's the same name but when you recognize your name you can say you can speak with authority as an adopted son of god knowing the will of your father and it will come to pass everything that adam lost brother has been restored you believe that everything what did he lose he lost a book of redemption where did it go into the hands of the original owner where did it go from there revelation 10 tells you where it went from there it went into the believers it went to the mighty angel to the seventh angel and then he gave it to somebody yes sir oh hallelujah does anybody know he gave it to he give it to somebody somebody's going to receive it somebody's going to eat the book somebody's going to speak the word somebody's got to prophesy again this is the day for there is no other day for it to come to pass this is the hour we're the sons of god we'll speak the word and it will be manifested [Music] [Applause] i'm not trying to convince you intellectually but once you realize it's been declared i'm not trying to convince you to get excited and say and try to you know make your house bigger or whatever or get a promotion work because you feel like it because many times those things are opposite the will of god what i'm saying is can you recognize the time that we're in recognize these signs of these things they've appeared to increase to encourage to stimulate your faith let me say that way you've got the faith you need but these things are here to stimulate your faith that you'll put it into action listen joshua one day he'd come there to the fight for the giving us of beth haran and he began to speak a word and that man was delegated that authority by god almighty amen he was given a commission and you and i we've been given a commission it's not just been given to us we've inherited it through through our father and that man spake and the very son stood still the the moon held its place in the valley amen all right i like how brother graham says it he didn't go on a 40-day fast he didn't get down and pray about it he didn't have to go make a bunch of sacrifices he was in the line of duty amen how many how many fighters we got in the line of duty today listen you've showed up here today because brother brown said this is your post of duty you're in the line of duty today and you've got a need the inspiration come on him and brother bram said he didn't fumble around his mind he didn't try to think it through it come upon him it seized upon this man and he spoke something unthinkable but guess what it come to pass remember there's a paradox to see something that seemed to be impossible yet it's true the sun stood still says the bible i says i don't know what you people think that means the world is run now or however but the sun stood still perhaps joshua never had tried to figure out how i was going to do it how god was going to do it the only thing he said was son stand still he said it perhaps not knowing what he was saying because it was god that gave it to him amen and he worked he says he god god worked same thing in mark 11. if you say this about same scripture amen so brother is tying it in together it's the same thing today so it's not just for joshua listen god didn't do that for joshua just for joshua so joshua could feel good about himself but there was a people there that he would manifest it to to bring them into their position amen this one brother man is hot and squirrels and god says you've got needed squirrels i don't know that brother brand was starving amen what was the need the need was for the manifestation of the third pull for you and i to realize that god still does the same thing today this is the great need the need of the hour is the bride of jesus christ to overcome because the world's groaning and travailing for it right he says you can't stand there and fumble in your mind so you've got to be inspired to say it you know what it's like i say this if this message don't inspire you i don't know what will hey man if we're feeding on this word you feed on this hey man don't just nibble on it hey man make this your diet all right man i tell you what my my younger daughter jana she's uh she's become my personal trainer i'm like well i guess i need it then she's got this this saying i hope she don't mind this she's got this sanctions the more you eat the more you weep i'm like thanks sweetheart she said you can't have any wheat you can't have any sugar you can't have this and you can't have that i'm thinking but why is that because it's no good for you hey man you've got to eat the right you can't just not eat the wrong things you've got to eat the right thing and many times we abstain from all the wrong things but we've got to feed on the right thing this is your spiritual meet and do season that's going to give you strength to overcome the trial of this hour is this message amen we ought to esteem this word more than our necessary food amen this word will bring an inspiration we can have a confidence knowing what was delivered to us amen listen if we don't have confidence in this we might as well stay on the other side of jordan amen because once you get confidence in this message once you realize you're following joshua it doesn't matter how many giants are in the land it doesn't matter how wild the cities are it doesn't matter how many philistines are over there god has already given the land into your hand amen there was five kings that come up to fight joshua that day and then kings come out and they were fixed you know what they they they were in for rude awakening they thought they were going to go set them israelites straight and put them in their place but they found out that day that their destiny was not their own to command amen they went out there to make war on the people of god and guess what they found themselves hiding in a cave yes sir right and then they were hiding a cave by the end of the day because it's one thing when you defeat an enemy it's another thing when you humiliate an enemy well i thought i'd get a few more amens on that one listen jesus christ has not only defeated satan he has humiliated him this message has come to expose satan he's a liar he's a bluff he has no power he doesn't even have the keys to his own house the bible says when he defeated the powers of darkness jesus spoiled them he made a show of them openly he marched him down the street naked exposed as a defeated enemy listen god is not looking just to show you that satan's defeated he's looking to humiliate satan through you he's going to manifest his manifold wisdom through you that the lowest the basis the weakest things of the earth he's still more than a match for the enemy these five kings they hid in the cave and and joshua he puts a rock over it so they can't go nowhere and he goes and he wins the battle and he comes back and says bring him out here i want you to bring him out here and joshua does something i think it's a real good idea joshua says i'm gonna go up here i'm gonna go for this king i'm gonna put my neck my foot on his neck take that sugar diabetes take that blindness take that mind battles take that depression god has put me over you i am humiliated not just the foot soldier but the very kings the very powers the very commanders i've humiliated them and then joshua invites his commanders to come here he says i want you to do the same thing jesus christ has not only defeated every enemy for us he's invited us i want you to come and put your foot on that that filthy defiled philistine listen if god could overcome it 30 years ago 60 years ago the invitation today is that the god of peace will put satan under your feet amen how are we going to call him out today amen listen you've been given an authority to call him out don't leave him in the cave how saint wants to hide their lives he'll try to find little places in our lives he'll try to hide there and say well you can't overcome this and you can't let so-and-so know about this and you can't deal with this problem but if i were you i would drag him out in the light today because the light has exposed him he is defeated pull him out of the cage you make your confession i might have dealt with this for years i might have suffered with this problem i might have had this mind battle i might have dealt with this addiction but today i'm pulling you out of the i refuse to let you stay in there another day god has given me an authority to put my foot on your defeated neck you pull them out today you take your voice listen you don't have to come up here remember you stand your feet you take your voice right now your voice you stand your feet you take your voice right now don't let the newspaper don't let yahoo don't let facebook don't let anybody tell you he's not defeated today you drag him out it doesn't matter what you've been through it doesn't matter where you're at drag him out today and stick him out in the sunlight and put your foot on his neck and you declare to him you declare to him that he no longer has a place in my possession you've got no place in my life you and i we can't dwell on the same the land's not big enough for the two of us the land cannot bear us both one of us has got to go [Applause] one of us is not walking away from this you serve notice to the devil don't just say well he was under brother man's foot while he was under paul's foot he's under your feet this is a time of war this afternoon amen we have declared war on the enemy this is the greatest battle that's ever been fought amen you know jesus told pilate he said my kingdom is not of this world because if it was then my servants would fight we get this idea well i'm a christian i just i can't do anything listen you're not called to fight your brother you're not called to fight your sister you're not called to fight whoever and you're natural man amen we've got weapons they're spiritual weapons the weapons of our warfare they're not carnal but they are mighty they're mighty amen you've got more power amen than you can even conceive in your mind he said my servants they will fight for this kingdom amen this is not the time to be complacent this is the time to draw your sword this is the time to settle with the enemy once and for all he's not getting back up i'm not giving a place in my life again i'm not dealing with this after today the enemies you see today you will see them no more you've got to settle it now his servants will stand up and fight for this kingdom [Music] now don't be afraid why is everybody what are you afraid of amen nothing to be afraid of you're the one to be afraid of if the enemy sees you amen listen he don't he doesn't fear your humanity he doesn't fear your intelligence he doesn't for your position at work he doesn't fear the church you go to he fears the one that you represent listen the devil's tremble hallelujah somebody yeah we get all shook up listen we uh we don't we don't believe elvis here amen we're not all shook up hey man he's the one that shook up his kingdom's fallen apart he's losing his grip on this bride because god will not suffer this bride to be manhandled and while the world's getting pulled in more and more we're lifting off we're rising up we are not the same as we were last week we are not the same as we were a year ago we're not going down we're rising up we're standing over the bodies of the fallen enemies that have tried to beset us in our life we will not suffer satan one more inch in my land i'll not suffer him another day [Applause] [Music] hallelujah heavenly father lord lord me your people right now lord he was on pray may they lift up their voice may they begin to speak to the circumstances in their life that have tried to discourage them and tell them it can't be for them that there's no way they'll ever overcome may they begin to speak to the situations that have beset them the different sins that have tried to beset them may they lay aside every weight may they begin to take their voice by inspiration with authority and claim every promise that belongs to them lord may they not suffer the enemy to set foot in their land may they not compromise one more inch of this possession this is a time of war we'll have plenty of time for peace in the millennium we'll have plenty of time to settle down and have a good time later now the battle is raging right now is not the time to sit down and sip tea right now i don't have the time to sit down and take it easy this is the time when the battle is the hottest this is the time to do as the prophet himself was told to press the battle the harder laodicea pushes the harder darkness pushes the harder the enemy tries to push against us the harder the spirit of crash than us is going to push back you promised you'd raise up a standard when the enemy would come in lord i believe there's a standard here today the message of the hour has come to give us prevailing power oh hallelujah there's a people here today they are the head and not the tail there's a people here today they have already passed from death unto life we've got some fighters in the building today i believe they're not looking to fist a cuff with their brother they're not looking for an earthly revolution to fix the world but the revolution of a human heart to turn from the powers of darkness towards the marvelous light of our lord jesus christ lord that's the revolution today that's the power that overthrows darkness today in our lives our confidence is in this great commander the captain of the hosts of the army of the lord there's no jericho there's no giant there's no kings can stand before us oh lord god i pray there for every need that's here today your prophet said faith settles it lord we're not looking at circumstances today for our circumstances can deceive us we're not looking at emotions and feelings today for they can lie to us many times our senses have lied to us our feelings have lied to us our own our own human intellect has deceived us at times but lord i can testify you have never once lied to me you've never once failed me you've never once let me down lord you've never once delivered me into the hand of mine enemy you've never once cast me off lord when am i in my bed in hell you were there lord then the thousands shall rise up against me i will not fear i will be confident [Music] oh heavenly father i look at this group of believers here today precious brothers and sisters in christ what a what a wonderful testimony i can stand as paul and testify of what you've done with this group of believers their faith with charity lord i pray now lord when the battles at this hottest may they not fool now may they not give up may they redouble their efforts may they double down on the enemy today and serve them in eviction notice we will not forfeit this message we will not give up this eternal life [Music] we refuse to compromise with the enemy there's no reconciliation with him there's no middle ground we will utterly defeat him through the power of our lords and savior jesus christ lord it's in your name we ask these things i pray to bless this group for every need here today every knee that was lifted up every confession that was made by faith
