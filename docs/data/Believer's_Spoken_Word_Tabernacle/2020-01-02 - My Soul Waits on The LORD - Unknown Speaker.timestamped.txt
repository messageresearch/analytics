[28:21] let's just say father the Lord as we
[28:27] just come before you this evening
[28:30] or Jesus we're just so thankful
[28:34] or to be able to gather together Lord
[28:37] Lord as we approach this new year
[28:43] Lord with forgetting those things that
[28:46] are behind us and reaching forth to the
[28:51] promised Lord that lays before us Lord
[28:56] annoying at any moment at any day Lord
[29:02] God will be caught away
[29:07] or Jesus we ask tonight the Lord that
[29:12] you would just come just take your word
[29:17] Lord help me to get out of the way and
[29:20] ask you to strengthen my body Lord also
[29:24] each and every one of your children
[29:26] there's many that are sick among us they
[29:30] need a touch from me so I ask that God
[29:33] that you'll strengthen us you touch his
[29:36] father for Lord we will hold that
[29:38] promise in our hearts
[29:40] you're the Lord heal all our sins we
[29:45] thank you for your mercy now father we
[29:47] ask it all Lord in the name of the Lord
[29:50] Jesus Christ
[29:54] would you stand with me tonight you want
[29:59] to go right into the word and they have
[30:02] to bring me some hot tea up here with
[30:03] honey that's what I've got in my office
[30:05] so that I may have to actually have to
[30:07] do that so if you see a cup come up here
[30:09] it's not coffee I actually haven't had
[30:11] coffee in a few days
[30:12] believe it or not
[30:19] I just need the help of the Lord here
[30:21] tonight seems like each time after I get
[30:23] done with a winter youth retreat on boys
[30:26] kind of struggling with that we just we
[30:30] just want to look to the Lord tonight
[30:31] and I want to read Psalm 62 certainly
[30:38] thank you for your prayers Lord just
[30:41] just moved wonderfully in the services
[30:44] we had there I had a couple of the
[30:46] mornings brother Andrew took the first
[30:48] two nights and then I had the first two
[30:50] mornings just teaching laying things in
[30:53] with the young people and then for the
[30:58] very coffee took the last morning their
[31:01] teaching and brother Paul really really
[31:05] preached a real tremendous service their
[31:08] own vessels of Honor and spoke about the
[31:11] pressures of this age that are up on
[31:14] young people and really got into
[31:16] something very personal and I think it
[31:22] was just I tell you what I just told by
[31:25] the pause that has you a preaching I
[31:26] said I just it's almost like you could
[31:28] hear change just fall off off of lives
[31:31] of things that even where the enemy
[31:34] would tried to hold condemnation over
[31:35] people's lively just was falling I've
[31:38] just seen just powerful and then we what
[31:42] helped us to come around the last
[31:44] knighting and just Minister there and
[31:47] they in the closing service and so I I
[31:50] just appreciate your prayers I if I
[31:54] expend too much energy right now talking
[31:56] about it I may not get through the
[31:57] message here tonight but to know that
[32:00] your prayers I don't always get a chance
[32:02] to share with you
[32:03] the reports in and I'm not one to always
[32:06] talk about the Lord did this and the
[32:08] Lord to do that if God puts on my heart
[32:10] to talk about a healing or something
[32:12] like that I'll do it but I just there's
[32:16] just so many things that the Lord does
[32:18] in a meeting like that you see so many
[32:20] needs being met those needs and the
[32:23] spiritual and those in the physical as
[32:26] well I just I think God for being so
[32:28] merciful and so mindful he's just such a
[32:32] person of God and you know what to see
[32:36] it that you look at that with the young
[32:37] people you know brother Brian had such a
[32:39] burden to teach the young people to
[32:42] actually train not just preach to him
[32:45] but brother Brown would actually in his
[32:46] early days but grandma she says it's in
[32:48] the Hebrew series he would actually take
[32:50] the young men one one Sunday and teach
[32:53] them about pressures that was upon them
[32:55] then he would take the young sisters the
[32:58] next Sunday afternoon and he would teach
[33:01] them and train them on certain things so
[33:03] we need that I just I think the young
[33:06] people are really really blessed within
[33:08] that to have that teaching of the
[33:10] wording and the ministry so we want to
[33:14] go here in the scriptures and I want to
[33:16] read this set of scriptures here in
[33:19] verse one Psalm 62 it says to the chief
[33:22] musician
[33:24] well I'll skip that name psalm of David
[33:27] truly my soul wait if upon God and once
[33:30] you snow 'test these words truly my soul
[33:33] waiteth upon God from him and cometh my
[33:36] salvation he only is my rock and my
[33:40] salvation he is my defense i shall not
[33:44] be greatly moved now if he makes a
[33:47] statement like this i shall not be
[33:49] greatly moved it shows that there is
[33:51] going to come pressures that would try
[33:55] to move him
[33:56] from what his soul is waiting on you
[34:00] know like the saying is true a faith
[34:03] that cannot be tested cannot be trusted
[34:09] how long will you imagine mischief
[34:12] against a man he shall be slain all of
[34:15] you as a bowing wall shall you be in as
[34:17] a tottering fence
[34:18] they only consult to cast him down from
[34:21] his Excellency they delight in lies they
[34:24] bless with their mouths but they first
[34:27] inwardly save my soul wait thou only
[34:32] upon God
[34:34] notice that my soul wait thou only upon
[34:40] God for my expectation is from him
[34:46] and wonderful to have an expectation
[34:48] where did you receive that expectation
[34:51] from from him so when God gives a word
[34:55] and that word is revealed to our hearts
[34:59] he releases to us the strength even an
[35:02] expectation to wait on that word to be
[35:06] fulfilled my soul wait thou only upon
[35:10] God for my expectation is from him he
[35:13] only is my rock and my salvation he is
[35:17] my defense i shall not be moved and god
[35:21] is my salvation and my glory the rock of
[35:24] my strength and my refuge is in god amen
[35:30] may God bless you as you're being seated
[35:33] I just want to take just a few moments
[35:39] probably I won't preach tonight I just
[35:42] don't have their I don't have the
[35:44] strength but I just can exhort it to
[35:47] teach on some things here or just to
[35:49] give a little exportation on the word my
[35:53] soul waits on the Lord is what I'd like
[35:57] to talk speak to you about this morning
[35:59] you know when you look at it David along
[36:02] with all the Old Testament Saints the
[36:04] the elect of God remember there was
[36:06] always an election even in the Old
[36:10] Testament when the Bible says there in
[36:13] the book of Matthew the 24th chapter you
[36:17] may have to give me a little bit more
[36:18] volume because I'm not gonna pry raise
[36:19] my not for me but for them can you all
[36:22] hear okay or you need you need a little
[36:25] higher thank you I figured that
[36:31] probably in some other time people wish
[36:33] they could turn me down what will get
[36:35] back to there you pray for me tonight
[36:37] would you do that you pray for me
[36:39] tonight but in the Bible it says in
[36:42] excuse me in Matthew 24 that many of the
[36:47] saints which slept in the earth arose
[36:49] not and by the bran would draw our
[36:52] attention that he said see said it
[36:53] didn't say all the Old Testament Saints
[36:55] many of them those who were died in
[37:01] faith they were believing they were
[37:04] holding to that promise they were
[37:07] offering the lamb by divine revelation
[37:10] and so we see that there's always been
[37:15] an election the elect saints of God in
[37:18] the Old Testament you'll see where David
[37:21] will break over in the spirit of
[37:23] prophecy and David and many times will
[37:26] move in even in the Psalms and he'll
[37:28] move from something that is present to
[37:30] even move to the future restoration of
[37:33] the 144,000 and David Banda the Spirit
[37:38] of God will move to that because
[37:40] remember not one of God's words can fail
[37:45] sometimes it you know things look a
[37:48] little shaky but rest assured what God
[37:52] has spoken
[37:52] he will surely bring it to pass and we
[37:57] can rest in him so when we see this they
[38:01] were all looking forward to the coming
[38:03] the election was looking forward to the
[38:05] coming of the Lord there was an
[38:09] awareness within their heart they were
[38:11] looking for that and they were waiting
[38:14] on the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[38:17] they were waiting on that that's why
[38:19] when you read many times in the Old
[38:21] Testament Saints and they were not
[38:23] swerved aside from the purpose of which
[38:27] they had been called to you read in the
[38:30] Bible where it talks about in Hebrews 11
[38:32] and then you come to the end of that
[38:34] chapter it speaks of how many were sawn
[38:37] asunder many of them endured great
[38:40] afflictions they were stoned to death
[38:43] they did not have it easy they a matter
[38:46] of fact brother branham would refer back
[38:48] to them and refer back to the New
[38:51] Testament church that was starting out
[38:53] and brother Branham would use the term
[38:55] over and over and says where are the
[38:57] rugged Christians where are the rugged
[39:02] Christians and he would tie that into
[39:03] the place that that ruggedness of
[39:06] Christianity it deals with having that
[39:09] faith rooted and grounded in our hearts
[39:12] and there must be a trying of that faith
[39:15] to be rugged it means that there's not
[39:19] going there's not always going to be
[39:21] situations that make it easy there's
[39:24] gonna be situations which you know how
[39:26] speaking to veterans here tonight as
[39:28] well
[39:29] situations that I'll try you and shake
[39:32] you to your very core but it's in those
[39:35] situations that God proves to you not
[39:38] him to you and me what he's placed
[39:41] within us when we get to looking at it
[39:45] that way we say lord thank you and we
[39:49] get to looking at that way you know
[39:50] where the Wayman makes the whole
[39:52] bitterness of the trial
[39:54] just just go aside because we see God is
[39:56] letting us know what he's placed within
[39:58] us Jesus would make this statement in
[40:02] Luke 21 19 he would say in your patience
[40:07] possess ye your souls notice not my
[40:13] patience but your patience he has
[40:17] patience and we must also have patience
[40:20] our patience must match his patience
[40:24] amen and it takes his patience to
[40:27] release to us what we need for our
[40:29] patients but in your patience possess
[40:32] you take take a hold of your souls here
[40:39] is John in Revelations 1:9 I John who
[40:41] also am your brother and companion in
[40:46] tribulation
[40:48] and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus
[40:53] Christ was in the isle that is called
[40:55] Patmos for the word of God for the
[40:57] testimony of Jesus Christ as he said
[41:02] before what John would receive here what
[41:04] a glorious revelation of the kingdom of
[41:07] God coming into power John would witness
[41:10] the coming of the Lord in the unfolding
[41:13] of the Holy Spirit in every age he would
[41:17] witness the coming of the Lord where in
[41:20] the second coming for the claim of the
[41:23] Gentile church that bride that he's
[41:25] redeemed he would witness the visitation
[41:28] there to the Jews in the 144,000 he
[41:32] would see them standing with victory he
[41:35] would see us standing with victory on
[41:38] the sea of glass clear with a complete
[41:40] reflection of the Holy Ghost in our life
[41:42] as an overcomer he would see the
[41:45] complete he would see clear through the
[41:47] Millennium and through the future home
[41:48] but this revelation did not come without
[41:53] a price it was not something that was
[41:58] what we would see favorable conditions
[42:00] you would think such a revelation like
[42:03] this that maybe he should be in on a
[42:05] velvet bed you know a very nice
[42:07] comfortable place with people waiting on
[42:09] you but you see God God so places it
[42:13] like this that it's not just about John
[42:15] this was for John's perfection but this
[42:18] is also for our admonition to show us
[42:20] within this time that to a true believer
[42:23] though we feel the discomfort of
[42:26] circumstances around us the light John
[42:28] and like Daniel we can stand by God's
[42:31] grace as an overcomer no matter where
[42:33] we're at were an overcomer no matter
[42:36] what situation we're in we're an
[42:38] overcomer
[42:38] why because greater is He that is in you
[42:42] than he that's in the world that's why
[42:44] we're an overcomer so here in the
[42:47] patience of Jesus Christ not to think of
[42:49] this remember on when they would come
[42:52] when John would say
[42:53] repent for the kingdom of God is at hand
[42:56] and you would see where the kingdom of
[42:58] heaven is at hand and it would seem at
[43:02] hand that it should come right there
[43:04] but at hand would simply mean to prepare
[43:07] yourselves for it is coming and you see
[43:11] if God were to give it away has to say
[43:15] I'm gonna come at this day and this hour
[43:17] and this moment it would not produce a
[43:20] patience in our lives or awaiting it
[43:23] would produce a laxness we're in that we
[43:26] would be then become hurried in our
[43:29] lives to somehow but you see within it
[43:32] all let me just say like this as
[43:33] believers it's something that within our
[43:36] hearts that our desire is looking for
[43:40] his coming staying on our toes every day
[43:43] and waiting for his coming looking for
[43:46] the fulfillment of this promise I I know
[43:48] there's been many that's been around
[43:50] been around us even before us they've
[43:54] had this figured out draw this out on
[43:56] the chart this is gonna happen this way
[43:58] it's gonna take place this way all of
[44:00] that is a lack of patience patience says
[44:05] God has spoken he will bring it to pass
[44:10] because when something is figured out
[44:13] then it no longer requires faith you're
[44:16] walking by your reasoning but when it is
[44:18] by faith it's not something that you
[44:21] have all figured out and waiting for
[44:23] stages to happen but you're looking to
[44:25] the Lord and knowing that if there is a
[44:27] progression for fulfillment God is there
[44:30] to guide and direct you until it all
[44:33] comes to pass that's like brother
[44:36] Branham it's a huge little little
[44:39] sentence but it has a big statement we
[44:41] could preach months on it the rapture is
[44:43] a revelation and yet to understand the
[44:46] rapture is a continual unfolding that
[44:49] rapture of the revelation is why no
[44:51] matter how long you've been serving the
[44:53] Lord that's why every message has been
[44:54] preached that's why every exhortation
[44:57] has come why the rapture is a revelation
[45:00] it's God unfolding to you and
[45:03] encouraging you and I
[45:05] it's continuing to quicken us quicken us
[45:07] quicken us why that's his work until
[45:11] finally the final moment of that comes
[45:13] in these bodies are changed
[45:17] that's the patience of Jesus Christ he's
[45:20] not worried
[45:22] is his patience we're in the kingdom
[45:25] were in the patience of Jesus Christ we
[45:27] also have as John would say tribulation
[45:30] I want to draw your attention also to
[45:34] another scripture in Revelations 3 verse
[45:38] 10 it says because thou hast kept the
[45:44] word of my patience so once again here
[45:49] is the patience of God thou has kept not
[45:53] I've kept it thou has kept it see God
[45:57] deposits a word in our heart it's up for
[46:01] us it's for us to keep it water it make
[46:07] sure weeds do not encroach on it that's
[46:10] it that's a full-time job isn't it
[46:12] have you ever noticed around your house
[46:14] I never cease to amaze me that the
[46:18] plants that I have around my house
[46:20] whether it's my hydrangea whether it's
[46:22] my roses whether it's my hostas whatever
[46:25] it is it's amazing why do the weeds grow
[46:29] near that plant or close to it that have
[46:32] the same leaf formation as that plant
[46:37] first of all I didn't plant those weeds
[46:39] and who put that there
[46:41] I mean seriously you know what I mean
[46:43] you have to get down on your you have to
[46:44] get down on your knees because sometimes
[46:46] you I don't want to pull up the high
[46:48] drain I mean we've you know worked so
[46:50] hard to get these snow balls to come on
[46:53] this thing you know you're on your hands
[46:55] and knees many times that's where we
[46:58] have to be in making sure weeds if weeds
[47:01] were there and weeds weeds were coming
[47:04] but when you see that just it's our duty
[47:06] to take care of this garden of our life
[47:09] because our life is a garden a bride
[47:12] the term garden in the Hebrew is
[47:15] figurative of a bride we are his garden
[47:19] where he comes to find rest a man in
[47:23] that room the Holy Spirit comes to find
[47:26] rest in our life he can find no place to
[47:30] sit down like the Dove but he finds
[47:32] place amen in our hearts I'm grateful
[47:35] for that aren't you because thou hast
[47:38] kept the word of my patience I also will
[47:41] keep thee from the hour of temptation
[47:45] and that wonderful in that hour of
[47:49] temptation but the RAM talks about is
[47:50] where he said the pressure comes to say
[47:56] you don't need to stand against this
[47:58] system you can serve God in this system
[48:01] as well as you can apart from it but see
[48:04] holding fast to that word even when you
[48:07] don't understand everything but you know
[48:09] what's important is you know who has
[48:12] spoken to you and when you know who has
[48:14] spoken to you it holds you in the hour
[48:17] of temptation for we truly are tempted
[48:20] we are tried we are tested God does not
[48:23] remove the temptation but he gives us
[48:26] the strength to endure it all of that
[48:29] which shall come upon all the world to
[48:32] try them that dwell upon the earth now
[48:35] brother Branham picks this up and he
[48:36] says what does he mean by the word of
[48:40] his patients he says Hebrews 6:13
[48:43] through 15 for when God made promise to
[48:45] Abraham because he could swear by no
[48:47] greater he swear by himself saying
[48:50] surely blessing I will bless thee and
[48:52] multiplying I will multiply me and so
[48:56] after he had patiently endured he
[49:00] obtained the promise and notice what it
[49:03] said after he had patiently endured he
[49:08] obtained the promise
[49:12] where I really could preach on that
[49:16] this is Abraham's life Abraham has given
[49:20] this promise when he's down in the earth
[49:24] of cow B's remember Abraham brother
[49:31] branham and faith is our victory to take
[49:35] us into a place to say Abraham knew that
[49:40] the Lord God had spoke to Noah he came
[49:45] to a place in his life he said Abraham
[49:47] one day prayed and said lord will you
[49:53] speak to me like you spoke to Noah in
[49:58] the powerful to have living examples so
[50:02] not just a word but a living example to
[50:04] see there was a word that come and it
[50:05] was not Noah that fulfilled it it was
[50:07] God to fulfill it through Noah and he
[50:11] said I so God comes speaks to Abraham
[50:15] and I think of this I don't know perhaps
[50:17] Abraham just got finished with making an
[50:19] idol he was a God maker he was an idol
[50:24] he was an idol worshiper he made gods
[50:31] yeah
[50:32] so then after he obtained the promise he
[50:36] patiently endured he he doesn't fully
[50:40] obey at first then his father dies he
[50:44] finally comes to a place coming into the
[50:45] land
[50:46] he's doing his lot of rounding it comes
[50:50] to a place he forsakes in the land and
[50:53] the pressure runs out of the land and
[50:56] here he comes back into the land he
[50:58] almost loses his wife all these things
[51:00] you know as it goes on and on but here's
[51:02] what I'm saying
[51:02] after he patiently I'm sure you know
[51:05] Abraham had a patiently endure even
[51:06] through all his mistakes
[51:08] Oh his mistakes because the word had
[51:15] already been spoken they you and I we
[51:21] don't have to have his life that it took
[51:24] a lot of grace it also took his brother
[51:29] Bramblett tell us and a message look he
[51:32] said where Abraham had to focus out all
[51:36] the misunderstandings on the promise
[51:40] what was one of the misunderstandings
[51:41] Ishmael he had a constant reminder
[51:46] before him of his own self-will
[51:52] see there were things that all around
[51:55] Abraham that the enemy could have poked
[51:57] at him to try to cause him to step aside
[52:02] but he received strength and patience
[52:07] from the Lord he continually received
[52:12] from God strength within his life we we
[52:16] don't read it in the scripture but we
[52:18] know Abraham we read points where
[52:21] Abraham prayed but you know it was not
[52:23] just in those portions of scripture
[52:25] Abraham prayed and he would call out to
[52:31] God like we call out to God like we pour
[52:34] out our hearts before God after he
[52:38] received the promise he patiently
[52:41] endured I wonder how many of we could
[52:45] have been watching he bring me to say
[52:47] scratch this gal never make it
[52:54] but to remember what God was calling was
[52:58] the word he already sold in Abraham all
[53:02] it takes is that word to come into the
[53:06] presence of God and the Word of God
[53:09] coming it brings transformation because
[53:12] this coming to pass of Isaac in his life
[53:15] was to say like this was the coming of
[53:19] the Lord God bringing his word to pass
[53:22] in his life
[53:24] you see when a word is given that's
[53:26] God's promise and when that word is
[53:28] fulfilled you do not reckon that word as
[53:30] somebody else but you say when the word
[53:32] is fulfilled you say that is the Lord is
[53:36] that right we are looking for his
[53:38] corporal coming but until that moment
[53:40] every other word that comes to pass is
[53:43] God coming in his word it's his coming
[53:47] to us personally glory be to God
[53:54] the brand goes on to say he says the
[53:56] spirit here is speaking about the Word
[54:00] of God which is given to us that's what
[54:01] this is is speaking here the word of my
[54:04] patient if the spirit is speaking about
[54:06] the Word of God which is given to us to
[54:08] wait for the fulfillment of that word
[54:12] required patience even as it did in the
[54:16] case of Abraham he endured as seeing him
[54:20] who is invisible how many of you have
[54:24] prayed or are you you are praying about
[54:26] something and you're looking for
[54:32] and and and you you have in the past
[54:35] there's things that you've prayed for
[54:36] and you've waited on you've looked to
[54:39] the Lord the testing and the trying
[54:42] comes in the time of waiting I would
[54:47] asked is there anybody that undoubtedly
[54:49] when you pray you'd like to see it
[54:52] happen I can put both of my hands over
[55:00] yeah I mean you take for example or you
[55:04] know sometimes we can have we can have a
[55:07] meeting and you can see miracles being
[55:11] done remember there's gifts of healing
[55:12] gifts of miracles whether that would
[55:15] separate the two as Paul did in the
[55:19] scripture
[55:20] times after you see miracles that'll
[55:22] take place no matter what the meeting
[55:24] that's a meeting here whether it's a
[55:26] meeting you know in other places our
[55:29] faith is never to expect for a miracle
[55:34] when we pray but our faith is to expect
[55:37] according to God's Word
[55:40] sometimes sometimes after you'll see
[55:42] things happen you know you you can begin
[55:45] to pray and because of how what you've
[55:47] seen happening
[55:48] you can pray almost with the thought
[55:51] that it it's gonna happen you know
[55:55] sometimes we get into that atmosphere
[55:56] and the atmosphere is not bad you
[55:59] understand the atmosphere is not bad
[56:02] it's just like pardon me I'll just go
[56:05] out here on maybe on a limb but you know
[56:07] when I've had brothers in the past and
[56:10] years gone by when they I wanted to
[56:12] challenge me on the church age book and
[56:14] they thought they had points on that and
[56:16] I'm not a I'm not an arguing but you're
[56:18] not going to that book right there
[56:19] you're not gonna take that book from me
[56:22] there's been a lot of scarecrows put up
[56:24] around that and shame on the people
[56:26] who's done it but it's just one of those
[56:28] things they sometimes they can only say
[56:30] what they've been taught and taught and
[56:31] Taunton but here's the point when they
[56:33] made a statement brother branham's made
[56:34] said I predict I said what's hard with
[56:36] that I mean you said it's a private
[56:39] student of the word I said what's hard
[56:41] was that he's under the inspiration God
[56:44] has not showed him that I said but how
[56:46] many times and I asked the brother I
[56:48] said how many times have you been in
[56:50] service and you thought a certain thing
[56:54] was going to happen and it didn't happen
[56:55] I said once your prediction or your
[56:59] thought wrong I said see you thought
[57:02] under that atmosphere I said but the
[57:04] thing of it is I said is to realize we
[57:06] can stand right on God's Word I mean
[57:11] when we in bringing that to the point of
[57:13] we can come into an atmosphere and we
[57:15] should come into that atmosphere but the
[57:17] atmosphere don't let it take us into an
[57:20] atmosphere of that that well Lord I mean
[57:23] I'm expecting a miracle we don't have a
[57:25] promise of a miracle but we have a
[57:28] promise on the Lord that he left all
[57:29] that diseases if it comes by miracle
[57:33] caused by a miracle that comes by divine
[57:34] healing it comes by divine healing
[57:36] however it comes it's gonna be God
[57:37] bringing and when it comes I'll say
[57:39] that's the coming of the Lord it's God
[57:42] coming in fulfillment of his word in my
[57:43] body
[57:46] is that okay I mean I want to get I want
[57:48] to get in the atmosphere I want to get
[57:50] into that when it's coming forth I might
[57:53] say hi you know I wake up the next
[57:54] morning or this or that and things get
[57:56] worse but you know if things come as
[57:57] believers were taught to realize we come
[58:01] right into the word and say well Lord
[58:03] forgive me for I had a little thought
[58:05] about this but I leave it in your hands
[58:07] because you're worried cannot fail he
[58:15] was patient with rum said he was patient
[58:19] the next paragraph there and then the
[58:22] word finally was fulfilled
[58:23] notice he was patient and then the word
[58:26] finally was fulfilled this is the way
[58:30] God teaches his people patience why if
[58:34] he fulfilled his word in physical
[58:38] manifestations the very instant you pray
[58:41] kinda like instant pudding you would
[58:46] never learn patience but would become
[58:49] even more impatient with life think
[58:56] about that impatient with life so when
[59:01] we take a promise of God and we pray
[59:03] over it God he teaches us patience when
[59:08] we've prayed remember James said we are
[59:11] not to pray with wavering faith
[59:15] we are to pray and ask God with faith
[59:19] believing brother bana would put it like
[59:24] this in the prayer letter remedy all
[59:26] doubts in your mind let it all be set
[59:32] aside is how do I do that
[59:33] to know first of all that God made the
[59:37] promise and if there was an ever nother
[59:39] mortal on the face of the earth he made
[59:42] that promise for you so there's not
[59:47] listen it's not a question is it the
[59:50] will of God
[59:51] no God's Word is his will so it's not a
[59:57] question is it God's will to heal me
[1:00:00] that's not a question it is his will to
[1:00:03] heal me it is his will so then now we
[1:00:08] begin to look and see it differently
[1:00:10] then we wait on God to fulfill it
[1:00:18] the Bible says by faith Abraham and 11
[1:00:21] Hebrews 11:17 by faith Abraham when he
[1:00:24] was tried offered up Isaac and he that
[1:00:29] had received the promises the Word of
[1:00:30] God offered up his only begotten son
[1:00:34] there it is
[1:00:36] Abraham was tried after he received the
[1:00:40] word of promise he said most think that
[1:00:44] as soon as we pray in Jesus name over
[1:00:46] the good promises of God that there
[1:00:48] could be no trial but here it says that
[1:00:52] Abraham was tried after he received the
[1:00:55] promise and in all points
[1:00:59] Abraham was continually tried all the
[1:01:04] way till it come to Genesis 22 offer up
[1:01:08] the only begotten Son in what took place
[1:01:12] on Genesis 22 God already knew about it
[1:01:16] you understand God already knew about
[1:01:18] this this was Abraham's faith being
[1:01:23] expressed in God's Word he offered up
[1:01:30] Isaac and God let him God let it be
[1:01:34] known when he come down
[1:01:36] Abraham thou has obeyed me in all things
[1:01:40] thou hast not withheld even thy only Son
[1:01:44] I wish I could preach on that for a
[1:01:48] little bit that right there is a mystery
[1:01:51] of the rapture right there in Genesis 22
[1:01:52] in that life of Abraham his brother Bram
[1:01:57] says we like Abraham walk to Mount
[1:02:00] Moriah he said for what God has done in
[1:02:03] our hearts by the quickening power and
[1:02:05] changed our nature we walk to that
[1:02:07] promise and God will surely fulfill that
[1:02:11] promise he brother BAM picks up again
[1:02:16] here in Psalms 105 he picks up about
[1:02:20] Joseph look at this word this scripture
[1:02:23] we've read this but to think of it in
[1:02:25] this until the time that his word came
[1:02:30] the word of the Lord
[1:02:34] try do you realize that from the time
[1:02:39] that Joseph had the dream in Genesis 37
[1:02:43] he dreamed a dream his brothers got
[1:02:46] envious of him everything that took
[1:02:49] place it would it be 15 years until he
[1:02:53] would set on the throne
[1:02:57] he would be rejected
[1:03:01] not by foreigners or strangers but his
[1:03:03] own brother he would be thrown in a pit
[1:03:10] they would sell him there into Egypt all
[1:03:15] of this we would see this it's going on
[1:03:19] he's out of place no God's getting him
[1:03:22] in place you see sometimes tests and
[1:03:26] trials in our life we would think as
[1:03:28] though it's taking us out of place our
[1:03:30] flesh and our spirit gets vexed it gets
[1:03:34] out of place but God is bringing us into
[1:03:39] place this is why you get a chance at
[1:03:46] some time read in Genesis 39 maybe I'm
[1:03:50] one of your devotions or something
[1:03:52] you're going through a test you're going
[1:03:54] through a trial it just was so dear to
[1:03:56] my heart
[1:03:58] Joseph when he's here he's in you know
[1:04:02] the prison then he he comes up where he
[1:04:06] comes to Potiphar's house you know then
[1:04:08] as he comes to the prison so forth every
[1:04:11] one of those times these are the phrase
[1:04:13] you'll see in Genesis 39 as you read
[1:04:15] through it the Lord was with him it says
[1:04:18] it multiple times in there the Lord was
[1:04:22] with him in the prison
[1:04:27] in the prisons the Lord was with you you
[1:04:30] see God has said I will never leave you
[1:04:33] nor forsake you I will be with you even
[1:04:37] unto the end of the age
[1:04:42] this I will say David spoke at Paul
[1:04:44] picks it up by inspiration this I will
[1:04:46] say the Lord is my helper I will not
[1:04:50] fear what man can do unto me I will
[1:04:53] trust in the Lord
[1:04:56] what am what a time that had to go to
[1:04:59] take place but you see what it was the
[1:05:01] word it tried Joseph he didn't
[1:05:06] understand what was going on in his life
[1:05:09] but character was being molded many
[1:05:15] times we pray and we have prayed and
[1:05:18] this goes from where were a young person
[1:05:23] middle-aged person or an older person no
[1:05:26] matter what the promise is there's times
[1:05:30] that we pray and we're looking for the
[1:05:37] fulfillment sometimes the waiting can
[1:05:40] also scriptural term that can be used
[1:05:43] and it will say delay but God doesn't
[1:05:48] delay you say so brother Samuel what
[1:05:53] what is it from the time that we pray
[1:05:55] until the time that God answers what
[1:05:57] takes place it's not a nothing time God
[1:06:02] is Moldy character throughout this time
[1:06:07] it's like as a young person prays and
[1:06:10] says oh I've been praying for a mating
[1:06:13] I'd been praying but really could say
[1:06:17] this is what I've prayed for that's the
[1:06:20] will of God that belongs to me so what
[1:06:22] should I do Lord that my life be made
[1:06:24] ready let me be made ready see all of
[1:06:28] these promises it all comes together as
[1:06:30] scriptural principles when his first
[1:06:32] coming remember his first coming they
[1:06:35] missed him because they had it all
[1:06:37] figured out
[1:06:38] and because he did not come the way that
[1:06:41] they thought he should come they
[1:06:42] rejected him
[1:06:43] are you as he didn't come the way they
[1:06:46] thought they rejected him instead of at
[1:06:48] that time they should have let their
[1:06:50] character be molded by that word cuz God
[1:06:54] listened what God does he molds our
[1:06:56] character to fit that word when it comes
[1:07:00] to past cuz that word has within it the
[1:07:03] virtue and the strength what's needed to
[1:07:06] more our character because after all the
[1:07:09] word is not coming to passed out here
[1:07:11] the word is coming to pass in us it's
[1:07:15] God bringing his word to pass so
[1:07:17] sometimes wonder what's going on why
[1:07:19] hasn't this happened I've been praying
[1:07:21] about this and this that covers a hole
[1:07:23] that covers a whole thing and you know
[1:07:25] what we are all oh I don't care how how
[1:07:29] long you serve the Lord we're all tested
[1:07:31] upon that sometimes I know when I think
[1:07:34] that man when I even had been in pain
[1:07:37] sometimes in my back and last winter
[1:07:40] youth retreat I had to you know my wife
[1:07:43] had to help put my socks on me and
[1:07:45] things you know because my back my
[1:07:48] goodness and you're praying you think I
[1:07:50] can't even matter what it felt like to
[1:07:51] feel normal
[1:07:52] it only been a few days and sometimes as
[1:07:55] it as it lingers and goes on you know
[1:08:00] all the thoughts there's all kinds of
[1:08:01] thoughts ago three of mine will I ever
[1:08:03] get back to normal again
[1:08:05] well ever hey that don't mean you're not
[1:08:07] a believer the word of the Lord is being
[1:08:10] tested
[1:08:12] yeah it's a testing but see your
[1:08:15] patience in this is his promise he made
[1:08:18] to me
[1:08:21] and he cannot fail my soul waiteth only
[1:08:28] on God notice not on my thinking about
[1:08:32] this no I'm waiting on God
[1:08:44] brother brems goes on to say don't you
[1:08:48] just appreciate the message of the hour
[1:08:50] my he said God give us exceeding great
[1:08:54] and precious promises he has for promise
[1:08:56] to fulfill them he will he will but from
[1:09:00] the time we pray until the time we get
[1:09:04] the answer
[1:09:05] oh boy from the time we pray until how
[1:09:10] long son till until Peter we thank you
[1:09:15] you think we've been here long enough no
[1:09:16] no he said until you've endued with
[1:09:19] power from on high until how long son
[1:09:22] until said Lord yeah that's not Lord
[1:09:27] forgive me don't let that impatience
[1:09:30] creep in cuz we're living in an age
[1:09:32] we're writing a reading about this MP
[1:09:34] you know we're living in an age an age
[1:09:36] of impatience I mean a couple years ago
[1:09:41] we're sending in the Amherst McDonald's
[1:09:43] and please don't put me out of the
[1:09:44] message for unit McDonald's but had to
[1:09:48] have my organic little cheeseburger and
[1:09:52] we're sitting there you know and and you
[1:09:56] know a and this guy walks in and night
[1:09:58] you know there's so much insanity and
[1:10:02] dance it's insanity everywhere this guy
[1:10:05] walks in and he just starts mouthing off
[1:10:09] and everything in the walk he said I put
[1:10:12] my order in and he said it has been five
[1:10:15] minutes I thought this guy's taking fast
[1:10:22] food a little too literal
[1:10:25] he was and you know then he just really
[1:10:28] starts spouting off and so I went to get
[1:10:31] up and you know at the same time you're
[1:10:32] like well do I get up or not but I don't
[1:10:34] like I don't want my family hearing all
[1:10:36] that nonsense there was two other men
[1:10:39] you know that kind of corralled it
[1:10:41] things but it just what I'm saying is
[1:10:43] that we're living in an age of
[1:10:45] impatience it's all around I mean people
[1:10:48] are patients when they are a patient
[1:10:50] when you drive oh it's all impatience
[1:10:56] I told brother oil in the Philippines I
[1:10:58] said with all the traffic and you all
[1:11:00] don't have traffic lanes that's it but
[1:11:01] what I've noticed about all of you all
[1:11:03] your more courteous your more courteous
[1:11:06] we've got traffic lights I said him
[1:11:09] there's not courtesy it people are upset
[1:11:12] but it seriously they don't traffic
[1:11:14] likes you who AM you kind of know how
[1:11:16] this is you know it's the horn the horn
[1:11:17] says look out I'm coming you know I'm
[1:11:20] baby I'm coming in but I noticed that I
[1:11:22] said what to me is what is that I said
[1:11:25] what character I said because they'll
[1:11:27] yield and it just go ahead and go I said
[1:11:29] what courtesy I couldn't do that here I
[1:11:31] mean it's true but from the time we
[1:11:35] brain until the time we get the answer
[1:11:38] we must learn to receive patience look
[1:11:44] at that we must learn to receive
[1:11:48] patients in our source I may say Lord I
[1:11:53] want to receive patients
[1:11:55] for only inpatients do we possess life
[1:12:02] brother Ram goes on in the latter latter
[1:12:05] quote if the last part in there he says
[1:12:07] they talk about those Christians and
[1:12:10] that Philadelphian age he said the last
[1:12:12] line of that says they were so patient
[1:12:14] and quiet and today we are all but
[1:12:18] overcome in over-over impatience what a
[1:12:22] word over not just impatience over in
[1:12:25] patience I mean you know look at it
[1:12:30] today I mean I graduated high school I
[1:12:32] should be the next CEO of Apple tomorrow
[1:12:35] over impatience but you see that's a
[1:12:38] spirit of this age and listen that
[1:12:43] spirit of this age is a spirit that
[1:12:45] comes even to attack the gospel all of
[1:12:52] this like brother Ram talks about in the
[1:12:53] message countdown he talks about people
[1:12:55] hurrying going here going there he said
[1:12:57] people is there is such a rush such a
[1:13:01] rush such a pressure don't have time to
[1:13:03] get here don't have time to get here and
[1:13:05] this and that and all of that bits
[1:13:07] pressures that adds up its pressures
[1:13:10] pressures that come upon the people and
[1:13:13] we don't there's no way to do away with
[1:13:17] the pressure but we do have a place to
[1:13:20] go to where we can let off the pressure
[1:13:29] is everybody okay
[1:13:33] Hebrews 6:12 I'm just going to go
[1:13:35] through some scriptures here
[1:13:36] Hebrews 6:12 that ye be not slothful
[1:13:42] this lawful means really just just
[1:13:45] stationary it's become kind of relaxed
[1:13:49] about it that you be not slothful but
[1:13:52] followers of them who through patience
[1:13:56] and faith inherit the promises Hebrews
[1:14:01] 10 36 for ye have need of patience that
[1:14:04] after you have done the will of God you
[1:14:07] might receive the promise for yet a
[1:14:09] little while and he shall come he that
[1:14:12] shall come will come and will not tarry
[1:14:17] Paul would write in Hebrews 12 and he
[1:14:20] wouldn't had Mohnish us to lay aside
[1:14:22] every weight and every sin that does
[1:14:25] beset us you notice Paul gives the
[1:14:29] authority of the word as it comes to the
[1:14:32] believer just
[1:14:38] see that's the authority of the word
[1:14:40] when the word comes isn't when the word
[1:14:44] is coming in a service you realize what
[1:14:46] that is we're not standing in the outer
[1:14:49] court we're not standing in the middle
[1:14:51] court but like Esther we are standing in
[1:14:53] the Kings Court and the scepter is
[1:14:55] extended to us when the word is coming
[1:14:58] you take that word and you stand upon
[1:15:00] that word amen and with the authority of
[1:15:05] that word listen you have the authority
[1:15:06] and with all heaven backing you laying
[1:15:09] aside lay it aside and let us run with
[1:15:14] patience the race that is set before us
[1:15:17] this is not a sprint it might be a good
[1:15:22] sprinter sometimes you see a lot of good
[1:15:25] sprinters people can sprint you know for
[1:15:27] a few years it's not a sprint this is a
[1:15:30] race with patience
[1:15:37] I don't know if you've ever kind of
[1:15:39] noticed it or not sometimes those
[1:15:42] pictures witness will pop up and and you
[1:15:46] you look at a lot of those guys that win
[1:15:48] the marathons those Boston Marathon's
[1:15:51] and other things you look at those guys
[1:15:53] they look like beam pose hi ingress it
[1:15:58] have fun they look as skinny as Paul how
[1:16:04] many summer so skinny they don't look
[1:16:07] like sprinters you know what sprinters
[1:16:10] look like those guys are built in there
[1:16:13] all stocky and built but you see it
[1:16:17] isn't about how much built out here it's
[1:16:21] about how much are you for the endurance
[1:16:24] because this is not just short quick
[1:16:27] little Sprint's it's a race of endurance
[1:16:33] the things you know is you've got to run
[1:16:37] through and you seem to get weary you
[1:16:40] you have to keep running this is why
[1:16:43] Paul would say in Colossians 1 11 that
[1:16:46] shoe his prayer was that you would be
[1:16:47] strengthened with all might according to
[1:16:50] his glorious power unto all patience and
[1:16:54] long-suffering with joyfulness in Luke
[1:16:58] 8:15
[1:16:59] remember the types of ground that the
[1:17:01] seed comes in the Bible says but the
[1:17:05] good ground are they which in an honest
[1:17:08] and good heart having heard the word
[1:17:11] keep it and bring forth fruit with
[1:17:17] patience how did they bring forth food
[1:17:21] with patience
[1:17:23] it isn't something as just turning its
[1:17:26] with patience this is why James 5:7
[1:17:29] would say be patient therefore brethren
[1:17:32] unto the coming of the Lord behold the
[1:17:36] husbandman waiteth for the precious
[1:17:37] fruit of the earth and hath long
[1:17:39] patience for it until he received the
[1:17:43] early and latter rain be ye also patient
[1:17:49] establish your hearts for the coming of
[1:17:52] the Lord
[1:17:52] draw with night as I said before it's
[1:17:57] character molding that takes place
[1:18:00] that's what's been happening with and
[1:18:02] that's what will happen with all of our
[1:18:05] lives once God has placed his life
[1:18:10] within our hearts
[1:18:12] from that moment on here we are looking
[1:18:16] for the coming of the Lord that's that's
[1:18:18] what we're waiting on we're not waiting
[1:18:21] on the next best job open for this to
[1:18:25] happen
[1:18:25] that's all those things can be fine but
[1:18:29] our sights are not set on that our
[1:18:33] expectation is the coming of the Lord
[1:18:37] that's what the Church of the Living God
[1:18:39] has waited on down through the ages Paul
[1:18:43] would write it as though that it was
[1:18:45] going to happen in his time did you see
[1:18:48] what it is
[1:18:48] it's how that that word when that word
[1:18:51] it comes to pass we are a part of that
[1:18:54] promise that's why
[1:18:58] you make the decisions that you make
[1:19:02] you've got choices that's why you make
[1:19:06] the choices you make why because of the
[1:19:09] coming of the Lord
[1:19:10] that's why brother Brennan would say and
[1:19:12] how can overcome he says that he is
[1:19:15] coming for those who are living for his
[1:19:20] coming
[1:19:22] living for it so there's a character to
[1:19:26] be molded through all the tests through
[1:19:27] all the trials through everything that
[1:19:29] comes our way there's a character and
[1:19:31] this is why brother Brown would ask the
[1:19:32] question he said we must have a
[1:19:34] character that is fit to stand before
[1:19:36] God what will be the choice he said will
[1:19:39] it be a character like his own glorious
[1:19:42] character that was molded through the
[1:19:45] fiery affliction of suffering he said or
[1:19:49] will it be this soft characterless lady
[1:19:52] of seon age we see that this was this
[1:19:57] was a quote that the Prophet made in the
[1:20:00] churches but we see this now we see and
[1:20:03] listen you can look at government you
[1:20:05] find people characterless that are
[1:20:08] completely that that's out there you
[1:20:11] find these these you find out but here's
[1:20:14] the choice that we have will we allow
[1:20:17] God to shape our character in the midst
[1:20:20] of this time I want God to save mine
[1:20:23] and in the shaping of it Lord help me
[1:20:25] just to be patient when I don't know
[1:20:28] what's going on but just to trust you
[1:20:30] you know he knows what he's doing you
[1:20:34] see this is where the scripture it says
[1:20:40] in James 1:2 my brother encountered all
[1:20:42] joy when you fall into divers
[1:20:45] temptations
[1:20:48] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:20:52] faith worketh patience but let patience
[1:20:56] have her perfect work that you may be
[1:21:03] entire and they may be perfect and
[1:21:05] entire wanting nothing I didn't notice
[1:21:07] that I I've noticed that over the years
[1:21:11] but let you let patience have her
[1:21:14] perfect work not his/her/its submission
[1:21:23] he's working
[1:21:24] he's working
[1:21:27] I don't know what all it but Lord you're
[1:21:29] working I don't know how it's all winded
[1:21:30] but I know you're working and this is
[1:21:32] why remember and um pardon me I need
[1:21:38] another coffee on
[1:21:42] this is why that that don't mean I'm
[1:21:45] gonna go another look at the time like
[1:21:46] what I just went but it's not a button I
[1:21:51] can tell you buttons don't taste like
[1:21:53] this just a few more moments
[1:22:01] this is why when we look at the seven
[1:22:04] virtues in the Statue of a perfect man
[1:22:07] these are all virtues that are sealed
[1:22:11] within the heart of the believer in
[1:22:16] other words it is the quality that is
[1:22:19] already in the seed that the life being
[1:22:23] present within you it will bring forth
[1:22:28] in the hour of trial those virtues
[1:22:34] manifest himself under trial they're not
[1:22:39] just you know you're not just out there
[1:22:40] exerting well here's patience here is
[1:22:42] this temperance here no no these are all
[1:22:44] under trial its alms one the man planted
[1:22:50] by the rivers of living water they all
[1:22:53] come out patience where does patience
[1:22:55] come out when you're being tried this is
[1:22:59] where patients come up where does
[1:23:01] temperance come out self-control where
[1:23:03] does that come up you're being tried
[1:23:05] sometimes when we have not exercised
[1:23:07] self-control then we have to repent oh
[1:23:11] we've got impatient but you see within
[1:23:13] at all what's happening there is there
[1:23:15] is an outworking
[1:23:17] and an abounding of that life working
[1:23:19] through us for the brem said if you've
[1:23:23] got faith it will work patience if
[1:23:26] you've got faith it will work patience
[1:23:30] you have to have patience toward God he
[1:23:32] said he said we pray for something he
[1:23:35] says you know and God says anything
[1:23:37] genuine faces God's gonna bring it to
[1:23:40] pass not well I prayed last night for my
[1:23:44] healing and look at me I'm so I'm sick
[1:23:48] on the dog right now you know oh my what
[1:23:53] patients is that but patience is looking
[1:23:58] at the word of the Lord and who made the
[1:24:01] promise patience is looking at him
[1:24:08] Abraham I mean he spoke of that already
[1:24:11] to know with Abraham and here I want to
[1:24:15] just I want to leave this this last
[1:24:17] little part with you out of the fat
[1:24:19] tyrant age notice what God says and I
[1:24:22] think I gave you this quote the fat iron
[1:24:25] age God says I know your faith now he
[1:24:29] does not say here as he did to the
[1:24:31] church in Pergamos you hold my faith
[1:24:35] you realize God is separating your faith
[1:24:37] from his faith he is not talking about
[1:24:43] his faith now but he is commending them
[1:24:47] for their faithfulness you know
[1:24:50] faithfulness is something you it's shown
[1:24:54] you showing like what the Bible says
[1:24:57] forsake not to assemble yourselves
[1:24:58] together
[1:24:58] God does not pick us up and do it for us
[1:25:01] faithfulness displays itself and being
[1:25:05] in the house of God when the doors are
[1:25:06] not just because to be regarded as
[1:25:08] faithful but as be faithfulness is to
[1:25:11] the Lord for what the Lord
[1:25:13] will do it's faithfulness to the Lord
[1:25:17] see God works with faithfulness the
[1:25:19] Bible says in Revelation is 19 has he
[1:25:23] comes upon the white horse with as you
[1:25:26] know after he's already made himself
[1:25:28] known to the hundred forty-four thousand
[1:25:30] he slips back up here we are gathered up
[1:25:32] from the wedding supper and we're coming
[1:25:34] back down with him and revelations 19 -
[1:25:36] the Battle of Armageddon the Bible
[1:25:38] speaks that they who rode with him were
[1:25:42] chosen and faithful faithful God rewards
[1:25:50] faithfulness
[1:25:54] faithfulness is not easy there's times
[1:25:57] when you don't feel but faithfulness is
[1:26:01] to the Lord
[1:26:06] he's not talking about his faith now but
[1:26:08] he's commending their faith them for
[1:26:10] their faithfulness and as he or does he
[1:26:13] also mentions their patience known as
[1:26:15] their patience
[1:26:16] now faithfulness and patience go
[1:26:19] together in fact patience is the outcome
[1:26:23] of faithfulness and a quotes James 1:3
[1:26:27] the trying of your faith worketh
[1:26:28] patience look at this statement there is
[1:26:31] absolutely no other way in which to gain
[1:26:36] patience it has to come by the trial of
[1:26:41] our faith there's no other way it's got
[1:26:47] to come by the trial of our faith
[1:26:48] you see this is why I can look around
[1:26:51] even the assembly here or you know you
[1:26:54] know with others you know just we just
[1:26:58] had a meeting here Tuesday night their
[1:27:02] brother Royce and I seen brother Shawn
[1:27:05] Martin and his daddy was there brother
[1:27:06] Martin and I just got a chance to talk
[1:27:09] with both of them but I got a chance to
[1:27:11] talk with brother Martin I had met him I
[1:27:13] was down at the meeting years ago
[1:27:15] brother Martin and I look at him and I
[1:27:20] think also none of him but also of
[1:27:22] others that I can look across this
[1:27:23] assembly that to know there's been a lot
[1:27:28] of trying of your face there was many I
[1:27:33] could point out you served the Lord
[1:27:35] longer than I have and to know there's
[1:27:38] been a lot of trying of faith and a lot
[1:27:40] of patience that has been accumulated
[1:27:43] over that time you know what happens
[1:27:45] with every trial in every test as we're
[1:27:49] waiting on the Lord even it's sometimes
[1:27:51] when we you just almost feel like you're
[1:27:53] coming apart hey the Bible said the
[1:27:57] patience of Joe you know how the tests
[1:28:00] and trial even with Joel the Bible said
[1:28:03] his breath was even strange to his wife
[1:28:05] I mean it there was a lot of things that
[1:28:09] took place with their underneath that
[1:28:10] trial but yet
[1:28:11] Jobe brother Graham would say it and I
[1:28:13] have her but now I see job stood
[1:28:16] flat-footed on the promise he said even
[1:28:21] then he didn't win didn't know what was
[1:28:22] gone he stood and here's the thing the
[1:28:27] patience that you have in the trial
[1:28:32] you're in now is because of the patience
[1:28:35] that's been accumulated in previous
[1:28:37] trials those are experiences that's why
[1:28:41] the Bible says patience then experience
[1:28:44] comes hope see because now in the trial
[1:28:48] that you're in or the testing you're in
[1:28:50] or while you're waiting once you've
[1:28:52] prayed there is a hope and expectation
[1:28:55] of patience because of experience it all
[1:29:01] works together and it's yours personally
[1:29:06] you love the Lord
[1:29:10] how highly God regards this outworking
[1:29:13] of our patients and I by the Browncoats
[1:29:16] at Scripture in James 1 for this last
[1:29:19] pair of graph theory says God's will for
[1:29:21] us is perfection and that perfection is
[1:29:24] patience waiting on God and waiting for
[1:29:29] God how many times we see in the
[1:29:31] scripture where people have done things
[1:29:33] for God Eve tried to do it for God Sarah
[1:29:37] tried to do it for God is that right and
[1:29:41] things were they tried to do it for God
[1:29:43] and missing but to wait here's the thing
[1:29:45] if we're waiting on God then we can rest
[1:29:48] assured if we're waiting on the Lord and
[1:29:50] just looking to him you will not miss
[1:29:55] when he brings his word to pass this is
[1:30:02] the process of character development
[1:30:06] look in Psalms 37 7 rest in the Lord and
[1:30:11] wait patiently for him fret not thyself
[1:30:16] because of him who prosperous in his way
[1:30:21] because of the man who bringeth wicked
[1:30:23] devices to pass cease from anger and
[1:30:26] forsake wrath fret not thyself and any
[1:30:29] wise to do evil for evildoers shall be
[1:30:32] cut off but those that wait on the Lord
[1:30:35] they shall inherit the earth even in the
[1:30:40] trial you're going on and it's going on
[1:30:42] remember to inherit the earth me who
[1:30:44] speaks of what the inheritance of peace
[1:30:47] so even in the midst of that trial this
[1:30:51] is why sometimes as we're looking at it
[1:30:57] and when we do we do this naturally out
[1:31:00] of our humanity at this boss or this one
[1:31:03] or that but to realize God has placed
[1:31:06] that there why his character development
[1:31:10] it's character development God molding
[1:31:13] God's shaping God refinery so this is
[1:31:17] what I'm saying as I've said to some in
[1:31:19] the past I'm not saying that a person if
[1:31:21] they feel that of the Lord to pray for
[1:31:24] for another job but I would say this
[1:31:28] right here when the Bible says fret not
[1:31:30] thyself because of him here's what it's
[1:31:33] saying
[1:31:33] don't miss the moment of character
[1:31:38] development for God to prepare you
[1:31:41] instead of focusing on on the negative
[1:31:44] and everything that's coming around but
[1:31:45] give yourself to God say Lord I don't
[1:31:48] understand and you know I'm fixed in my
[1:31:50] spirit or my mind or my body Lord help
[1:31:54] me Lord help me to stand faithful in the
[1:31:58] midst of this time help me to be patient
[1:32:01] in the midst of this time this is why
[1:32:04] brother Branham could say you know even
[1:32:09] in the midst of it of how our patience
[1:32:12] is to be looking even with one another
[1:32:16] and just a few more scriptures here I'm
[1:32:19] from closing
[1:32:20] I had fainted David said I had fainted
[1:32:22] unless I had believed to see the
[1:32:25] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[1:32:28] living oh that's a truth in it
[1:32:31] I had fainted unless I had believed to
[1:32:34] see the goodness of the Lord in the
[1:32:36] the living verse 14 wait on the Lord be
[1:32:40] of good courage and he shall strengthen
[1:32:44] thine heart wait I say on the Lord
[1:32:46] notices wait on the Lord be of good
[1:32:49] courage and he shall strengthen your
[1:32:50] heart the first part be a good courage
[1:32:52] is stand on that word this is what God
[1:32:55] has said and I will stand right here and
[1:32:57] by standing on that here's the promise
[1:33:00] and he shall strengthen your heart so as
[1:33:05] the next day come you have you have
[1:33:07] strength to stand with courage and even
[1:33:10] there looks like greater opposition and
[1:33:12] maybe greater symptoms display
[1:33:15] themselves that you have a good courage
[1:33:17] to stand on the word you stand your
[1:33:19] stand on the word he strengthens our
[1:33:22] heart the joy of the Lord is our
[1:33:26] strength it comes through the word of
[1:33:28] the Lord this is why when here we are in
[1:33:32] Romans go to Romans 15:4 here we are in
[1:33:36] the midst of tests in trying time this
[1:33:40] is why we need one another this is why
[1:33:42] we even we come to where as we come to
[1:33:44] the house of God this is just one or one
[1:33:46] of the one of the reasons that we might
[1:33:49] receive encouragement and strength keep
[1:33:53] pressing on
[1:33:57] not to where we become lats or you know
[1:34:01] disheartened with things but we're
[1:34:03] encouraged to take hold of the promise
[1:34:06] this is why in Romans 15:4 for
[1:34:09] whatsoever things were written aforetime
[1:34:10] were written for our learning that we
[1:34:12] through patience and comfort of the
[1:34:14] Scriptures might have hope now the god
[1:34:20] of patience and consolation grant you to
[1:34:23] be like-minded one toward another
[1:34:25] according to Christ Jesus
[1:34:27] that you may be may with one mind and
[1:34:31] one mouth glorify God even the father of
[1:34:33] our Lord Jesus Christ think of this the
[1:34:35] god of patience and consolation grant
[1:34:38] you to be like-minded one toward another
[1:34:43] the rapture is for the body of Jesus
[1:34:49] Christ we have heard the shout the
[1:34:54] Living bread of life the quickening
[1:34:57] power has come to get the people of God
[1:35:04] into a place in Christ like our Goshen
[1:35:08] in order to be delivered we are waiting
[1:35:13] in Christ and expecting this and Paul
[1:35:17] would say as we are waiting the god of
[1:35:20] patience the god of patience and
[1:35:23] consolation help us to be like-minded
[1:35:25] one toward another two to be able to be
[1:35:29] patient with one another but the bram
[1:35:33] deals with that virtue of patience in
[1:35:35] the statute of Rome and he says and that
[1:35:36] patience is also to be patient with one
[1:35:40] another sometimes there's things that
[1:35:43] you're praying about in brother Branham
[1:35:44] alludes to his own self he said for 30
[1:35:47] years I've been preaching things right
[1:35:48] here in the tabernacle and I don't see
[1:35:50] certain things
[1:35:53] they're the bannermen the whole Eagle
[1:35:55] series he talked about how God showed
[1:35:56] him even a vision whether it be some
[1:35:58] fish they go right away and all of us
[1:36:03] have our challenges when it comes to
[1:36:06] patience but here's the thing God's Word
[1:36:09] cannot fail you might be the vessel that
[1:36:16] God will use so if this becomes a birdie
[1:36:20] things become a burden upon your heart
[1:36:23] like well I don't see this so I don't
[1:36:24] see this and I don't see this though why
[1:36:27] don't you say Lord what would you have
[1:36:30] me do
[1:36:37] is patience it's waiting on the word of
[1:36:41] God to come to pass and please don't
[1:36:44] misunderstand me I you know I hold my
[1:36:46] tongue a lot I'm out in different
[1:36:48] meetings and you come face-to-face with
[1:36:50] different ones and I unless the Lord has
[1:36:52] me to say something I don't ever say
[1:36:55] things to try to I when I when I and I
[1:36:58] hope you you would see this even when
[1:37:00] you fellowship with me I don't try to
[1:37:02] come and listen to and things are taught
[1:37:04] over you didn't finish this statement
[1:37:05] right or you cuz any fellowship I mean
[1:37:08] it to me is not fellowship when you it's
[1:37:09] all together with somebody's correct and
[1:37:11] this one correct and that one or you got
[1:37:13] any fellowship that to me is run a ship
[1:37:18] run away you know but so many times you
[1:37:23] you know you hear statements well I'm
[1:37:25] gonna go over this church because it
[1:37:26] seems like that they have more young
[1:37:28] people or I'm gonna go over this trick
[1:37:29] and you look around and you say you know
[1:37:32] the thing that it comes down to and if
[1:37:34] God gives you the wisdoms they say wait
[1:37:35] a minute what about your heart where's
[1:37:40] the patience of the Lord in your heart
[1:37:45] there's got to be a burden in every one
[1:37:49] of our hearts and in order for God's
[1:37:52] Word to come to pass it's going to
[1:37:55] require patience there's a patience we
[1:37:58] must have among one another we're going
[1:38:01] to hey let's face it we see we can see
[1:38:04] one another's shortcomings maybe not
[1:38:05] outright lay like maybe our spouses or
[1:38:07] the rest of our family but we can we can
[1:38:09] see we can see at times maybe ups or
[1:38:12] downs or or what-have-you but you know
[1:38:15] what within and all it written requires
[1:38:18] the grace of God with patience to be
[1:38:21] able to look beyond it I would rather I
[1:38:24] would rather be guilty of giving
[1:38:26] somebody the benefit of the doubt than
[1:38:29] to come right out against them I've done
[1:38:32] that even recently with we even reasoned
[1:38:35] with even a situation in the past few
[1:38:37] months
[1:38:39] just with you just within that right
[1:38:41] there I'd rather give somebody the
[1:38:43] benefit of the doubt maybe their
[1:38:44] thinking isn't real clear on these
[1:38:45] things I just rather give the benefit of
[1:38:47] the doubt within things or some things
[1:38:48] you you almost don't want to believe
[1:38:50] that are taking place but you want to
[1:38:52] give the benefit of the doubt be patient
[1:38:55] with one another and being listen
[1:38:59] because being patient with one another
[1:39:02] is also being patient with the Lord it
[1:39:08] all works together the person says I
[1:39:10] don't know I can't have no more patience
[1:39:12] then can you be patient for his coming
[1:39:16] see it all works together you can't
[1:39:18] separate it it all comes together and
[1:39:22] this is why say God if we could stay
[1:39:26] here tonight and I'm done I trust it's
[1:39:31] been a blessing to your heart I know
[1:39:34] I've had to go in a different gear
[1:39:36] tonight I don't mind this gear I don't
[1:39:39] sweat as much
[1:39:42] she'll feel just as anointed as ever
[1:39:48] but I would say tonight how many of us
[1:39:51] could say to the Lord Lord renew my
[1:39:57] strength
[1:39:59] renew my stream maybe you've gotten
[1:40:01] maybe it's gotten a little off on on
[1:40:03] something say Lord just renew my stream
[1:40:07] they that wait on the Lord he shall
[1:40:09] renew your strength he's faithful to do
[1:40:14] that let's pray

[1:40:49] offered out in Revelations 8 it speaks
[1:40:53] of the prayers being offered up Lord
[1:40:54] prayers where they have been praying for
[1:40:56] the coming of the Lord and they have
[1:40:59] waited they have looked forward in their
[1:41:02] generation and many have fallen asleep
[1:41:05] in their watch but they were faithful
[1:41:10] and with patience in that watch here we
