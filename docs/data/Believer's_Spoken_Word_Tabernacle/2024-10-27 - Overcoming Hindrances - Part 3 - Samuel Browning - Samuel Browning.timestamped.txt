[24:06] sir I don't know where to start I have a
[24:08] lot to fit in I'll go quickly uh we just
[24:11] want to tell Jesus we love him today yes
[24:14] sir and we want to overcome Satan
[24:18] today um I believe scripture really has
[24:22] to guide us I I'm really I should have
[24:26] testified a long time ago
[24:29] um with my father's heart attack and
[24:32] back in 2017 and I do apologize but it's
[24:35] all God's timing he gave me scripture
[24:38] had no idea what to do with it um took
[24:42] obviously seven and a half years to come
[24:45] up here uh but the I just discern the
[24:47] spirit prayed and prayed and prayed what
[24:50] does this mean Finally Revealed it and
[24:54] um I am blessed to be in front of people
[24:56] that understand Revelation and have
[24:57] taught me Revelation so thank you yes
[25:00] sir I'm looking at a bag of prayer
[25:02] cloths and that's truly your prayers
[25:04] have saved my life so thank you um it
[25:09] knew nothing about the message in
[25:11] 2017
[25:13] um but you know sometimes God has a
[25:18] scary way of teaching and you know when
[25:20] you get a call at your dad's having a
[25:23] cardiac event you you get scared so I
[25:26] went to the cardiac unit in fairv
[25:28] hospital
[25:29] hospital and uh my uh my stepmother and
[25:32] I witnessed the massive heart attack
[25:34] right there just as soon as I walked
[25:35] into the door um and he was in a coma
[25:39] for about 3 weeks it was terrible worst
[25:41] traumatic thing I've ever been through
[25:44] um and you know during that coma is when
[25:48] uh my wife and uh my
[25:51] mother-in-law and sister mercy and
[25:53] sister Olga introduced me to a prayer
[25:55] cloth and said it came from bwt I said
[25:58] what's that they told me all about it
[26:02] but they didn't push it on me they
[26:04] didn't over describe it they were
[26:07] patient they their faith was just
[26:09] steadfast and but they were silent too
[26:11] they were just were very patient I do
[26:13] remember that and thank you very much I
[26:15] thank my family uh for that love and for
[26:18] the church your love as well please can
[26:21] you clap for yourself and for Jesus
[26:24] please thank you
[26:29] it must have been a Thursday service
[26:31] that you guys uh they got from the
[26:33] church Friday Night We snuck in there
[26:36] because there was quite a spiritual
[26:37] battle going on uh when you have half a
[26:40] family that believes in Christ the other
[26:42] half that doesn't and there's a coma and
[26:45] there's a person's life on the line it
[26:46] gets very tense and dramatic so we had
[26:48] to sneak it in there uh we all four or
[26:51] five of us prayed around his his body
[26:53] he's in a coma
[26:55] still and then that Saturday morning I
[26:57] went by
[26:59] myself and literally put my feet on or
[27:01] put my hands on his feet and his eyes
[27:03] came right right
[27:05] open it took it took only eight hours
[27:08] for him to come come awake with the
[27:10] prayer cloth on
[27:12] him so thank you very much I still a lot
[27:16] of confusion I still had scripture there
[27:19] in the following months um and you know
[27:22] that scripture was uh Genesis 26 and
[27:25] it's about Isaac digging up his father
[27:28] father's Wells and how Satan through the
[27:30] Philistines had stopped them up with the
[27:33] Earth and um he just kept telling me dig
[27:36] dig dig dig out the soil prise the Lord
[27:40] and um yes sir really didn't know what
[27:42] that meant other than have
[27:44] faith um what was hard is when he
[27:46] survived got out of the hospital still
[27:49] tension with the families he wasn't
[27:51] going to be in my life the way he used
[27:52] to be um he went back to smoking went
[27:56] back to drinking went back to his ways
[27:59] and that's why it took me so long to
[28:01] testify um and you know those things can
[28:03] follow you you think you're defeated you
[28:05] think you're defeated but you're not um
[28:08] but I truly thought I was I truly
[28:10] thought it was why did this happen it
[28:11] was just it
[28:12] just so a few months ago I made the
[28:15] decision to reconcile with him and meet
[28:16] up with him um and I just had to speak
[28:20] the name of Jesus to
[28:21] him and just see what he his reaction so
[28:24] I'm like if we're already at a bad point
[28:27] so he can't get worse so I met up with
[28:30] him I I just hugged him said I love you
[28:34] and I said um do you know that Jesus
[28:37] Christ saved you when you were in a coma
[28:39] and he said yes I
[28:42] do um and I said what how do you know
[28:46] you're in a coma and he said he had a
[28:48] vision or a Dream It's the only thing
[28:50] you can remember wow and it was me and
[28:52] my brother he said you guys had these
[28:55] huge fancy cameras
[28:58] and you were on a train and you were
[29:00] traveling the world on this train it was
[29:01] a strangest dream because a train can't
[29:03] go over water but it was happening and
[29:06] you guys were sh shooting a film and the
[29:09] title of the film was
[29:11] 33 and he said I did some research on 33
[29:14] and it's a very Angelic
[29:17] number and it brought me to Jesus Christ
[29:19] and that he was 33 years old when he was
[29:23] crucified not sure the hidden meanings
[29:25] of the dream but the point is it got him
[29:27] to know that Jesus saved him and I thank
[29:31] Jesus Christ for that I thank his word I
[29:33] thank Genesis
[29:34] 26 um and I'd also like to declare this
[29:38] testimon is for both my parents uh I'd
[29:40] like to declare my mom is cancer free as
[29:43] of a couple months
[29:48] ago and um I searched for scripture
[29:51] there couldn't find out anybody God
[29:53] brought me back to Genesis 26 again and
[29:56] digging it up digging it up she had she
[29:58] had so many unresolved emotions with her
[30:01] her parents that passed away and her
[30:04] husband my stepfather who passed away uh
[30:07] and her brother and her firstborn son
[30:09] who who's still with us but is not a
[30:12] Believer uh I believe he is but we're
[30:14] just digging and digging and having
[30:16] faith and praying for him uh his name is
[30:18] Dean so please pray for him please pray
[30:20] for my dad his name is Joseph
[30:22] Savage um and I'm just not going to give
[30:25] up so
[30:28] one thing at a time and I thank you guys
[30:31] so much please just pray pray pray keep
[30:35] praying um that so good and thank you
[30:38] for the testimony isn't just mine it's
[30:41] yours too because of the prayer cloth
[30:43] and I found that in scripture as well uh
[30:45] Revelation
[30:47] 12:11 speaks of overcoming Satan and it
[30:50] says and they overcame him by the blood
[30:52] of the lamb and by the word of your
[30:56] testimony and uh their testimony that
[30:58] means our testimony so it's not just for
[31:01] me and my family it's for all of us uh
[31:04] in the prayers and Drake wants to sing
[31:07] and just praise the Lord so thank you
[31:08] very much all

[54:21] amen I'm going to I want I don't want to
[54:23] read I do but I don't want to read all
[54:25] the vers here this morning we've um went
[54:30] into
[54:31] this and if we could let's read here
[54:35] verses verse
[54:37] one Paul said I therefore the prisoner
[54:41] of the Lord beseech you that you walk
[54:45] worthy of the vocation that's the
[54:49] feast where with ye are called that
[54:52] Feast that we've been called to how many
[54:55] knows we've not just been
[54:57] called um to the Pentecostal Feast but
[55:00] we've been called To The Feast of
[55:03] Tabernacles and that's that's where God
[55:06] has brought us to now and I don't want
[55:07] to dwell so much in that because it's
[55:09] his presence dwelling in temporary
[55:13] booths it's God dwelling we're living in
[55:16] that hour where Christ and his people
[55:18] are one would you go to verse two
[55:21] Brianna
[55:22] please with all
[55:24] lonliness and meek
[55:27] with longsuffering forbearing one
[55:30] another in love go ahead and go to the
[55:33] next verse please endeavoring to keep
[55:36] the unity of the spirit in the bond of
[55:41] peace and then if you would just skip
[55:44] down with me
[55:46] to uh verse
[55:50] 22 Paul says that ye put off concerning
[55:55] the form former
[55:57] conversation the old man which is
[56:00] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[56:04] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[56:07] mind and that you put on the new man
[56:10] which after God is created in
[56:14] righteousness and true Holiness it's so
[56:16] it's not it's not us creating ourselves
[56:20] we are his creation that's right we are
[56:23] his workmanship it's God bringing forth
[56:26] for himself in our
[56:29] lives so it's it's all of speaking of
[56:32] the rest amen may God bless you and
[56:35] bless his word as you're being
[56:39] seated and I want to just read one more
[56:43] scripture
[56:44] here where Paul would say in verse 27
[56:49] neither give place to the
[56:53] devil and then in verse 30 he would say
[56:56] and grieve
[56:57] not the holy spirit of God whereby you
[57:01] are sealed unto the day of
[57:06] redemption and I would like to if the
[57:08] Lord would help us we've been um looking
[57:11] here for a few services and some things
[57:14] that the Lord just really uh begin to
[57:17] inspire to my heart here just a few
[57:19] weeks ago and looking
[57:21] at sometimes things that can become
[57:25] hindrances and it's not things that are
[57:27] all
[57:28] together obvious but it's things that
[57:31] can become so subtle and that's always
[57:34] Satan's is always his disguise and his
[57:36] way is to try to in any way come under
[57:41] cover remember brother BR would tell us
[57:43] when he's preaching the first seal he
[57:45] said that Satan is able to outsmart
[57:48] anyone he said but there's one that he
[57:51] cannot outdo and that's the holy spirit
[57:55] so this is where we want to rely upon
[57:58] God so completely is Lord I I want your
[58:02] leadership I want I want your
[58:03] discernment within it because Satan is
[58:06] very subtle in in our Humanity our human
[58:10] our humanness can never pick him up or
[58:12] detect him it takes the spirit of God
[58:15] within us because it's a spiritual
[58:17] battle and Satan's desire when we look
[58:19] at this with hindrances Bri if you want
[58:21] to go ahead and switch that please when
[58:23] you look at this with hindrances
[58:26] it's just like it's just very simply
[58:28] it's things that would hinder us or
[58:30] prevent and remember you and I God has
[58:33] called us to be the branches of the vine
[58:38] the bran the vine itself cannot bear
[58:40] fruit without the branches but the
[58:42] branch cannot bear any fruit without the
[58:45] life of the vine flowing through it and
[58:48] there's many things that like brother
[58:50] brand would tell us in the message uh of
[58:53] where that Satan would like to he use
[58:55] the terms clog up the channels of Our
[58:58] Lives to hinder and to prevent things
[59:01] it's just like if you have something in
[59:03] your body and something is not operating
[59:06] correctly like sometimes with the heart
[59:08] and maybe there's a buildup of you know
[59:11] cholesterol whatever more and I don't
[59:12] mean to damper anybody's day but um you
[59:15] know sometimes when those things aren't
[59:17] working right when the flow of the blood
[59:19] is not right that can be a serious thing
[59:21] it can cut off the flow of the oxygen to
[59:24] certain places and certain limbs of the
[59:26] body so there's always a way that God
[59:29] God has made for you and I that we are
[59:31] washed with the washing of Water by the
[59:34] word the the it is the it is the
[59:36] ministering of the word of God the
[59:38] transforming power that has the ability
[59:41] and to take care of the sin question and
[59:44] it also has within it the strength to
[59:47] cleanse you and I continually keeping us
[59:50] in a place that God himself might be
[59:53] able to make himself known through our
[59:56] lives and if you can we can just see it
[59:58] in that way this is what God has called
[1:00:00] us to be as channels now I had no idea
[1:00:04] uh what brother uh Drake was going to
[1:00:06] refer to and I think I heard this within
[1:00:08] here but this was something was striking
[1:00:10] my heart yesterday and um and when I
[1:00:13] looked at this in the
[1:00:15] scriptures and this scripture just kept
[1:00:17] moving in my heart and there's a
[1:00:19] statement brother brandham was saying
[1:00:21] kept striking me as I was going back
[1:00:22] through the message humble thyself
[1:00:24] yesterday and that is where remember
[1:00:27] when they came to this place um that
[1:00:30] Elisha Jehoshaphat was there with with
[1:00:33] ahab's uh son I believe it was and when
[1:00:36] he come to this place they had went off
[1:00:38] without taking provision for water and
[1:00:41] they came to a dry place and they were
[1:00:44] now they needed they needed an answer
[1:00:46] and God himself provided an answer
[1:00:49] through a channel but I want you to
[1:00:51] notice before they ever could could get
[1:00:54] an answer and the digging ever come that
[1:00:56] way God had to first get his ordained
[1:01:00] channel for that inspiration would flow
[1:01:02] through which was Elisha he had to get
[1:01:05] him in the right mood is that right
[1:01:08] Elisha would said you know he looked
[1:01:10] over there you know and he said look if
[1:01:11] it was not for Jehoshaphat I would't
[1:01:13] even look at
[1:01:15] you and it wasn't he was saying that to
[1:01:17] be you know in one way indifferent I'm
[1:01:19] not trying to lift Elisha up but you
[1:01:21] know to recognize that here when you
[1:01:23] have something that's rejected rejected
[1:01:25] rejected rejected but it's because of
[1:01:28] jehoshaphat's presence that brought
[1:01:30] Elisha there on the scene where
[1:01:33] Jehoshaphat was willing to Humble
[1:01:35] himself and say look there is no way out
[1:01:38] of this situation we need the help of
[1:01:41] God and here an ordained Channel by the
[1:01:44] name of Elisha he he's he he knew
[1:01:47] exactly what was needed for his own life
[1:01:49] bring me a Minstrel and as the minstrel
[1:01:52] would begin to play that song it changed
[1:01:55] changed the atmosphere and as it began I
[1:01:59] I don't know what song he played but I
[1:02:01] can you know pretty much tell you like
[1:02:03] brother Bram says he probably wasn't
[1:02:05] playing or singing Nearer My God to thee
[1:02:08] maybe he was saying I'm taking it back
[1:02:10] you know I'm going to take back my
[1:02:12] attitude I'm going to take back the
[1:02:13] right way I I don't know what he was I
[1:02:15] don't know but you know brother Bram
[1:02:17] would you know he would always say that
[1:02:19] in regards to Paul Raider when they came
[1:02:20] in and they were singing certain songs
[1:02:22] and Paul Raider said wait a minute who's
[1:02:24] dying here me or you so there's just
[1:02:27] certain songs that call for certain
[1:02:30] occasions and so God knows that I mean
[1:02:33] that you know taking it back what the
[1:02:34] enemy called for me I don't think that
[1:02:35] would probably be appropriate for a
[1:02:37] funeral but I don't know I mean it may
[1:02:40] happen so I don't want to make a
[1:02:41] tradition out of it but you understand
[1:02:43] what I'm saying and and I think to me
[1:02:46] when you can see a humility that Elisha
[1:02:48] realized I'm not in the right frame of
[1:02:50] mind I'm not in the right condition I I
[1:02:53] I need a minstral to play a song and let
[1:02:55] me just say say it to you and I like
[1:02:56] this you and I were in no condition to
[1:02:59] be able to receive from God in this hour
[1:03:03] but God himself descended down it was
[1:03:06] not anything of the Earth or any Earthly
[1:03:08] musician but God himself who set forth
[1:03:12] every promise in his word he came
[1:03:15] forward and took the book and loosed the
[1:03:19] seals thereof and there is a new song
[1:03:22] that has broke out and the word itself
[1:03:25] has changed the atmosphere to where
[1:03:28] we're not looking at our inabilities or
[1:03:30] at least that's God's desire and the
[1:03:33] effect of dwelling in the atmosphere of
[1:03:35] the word it takes us beyond the human
[1:03:38] Veil to where that we're not relying
[1:03:42] upon man because that's even where uh
[1:03:45] the ladyo seean age which we're still in
[1:03:47] that age but that's exactly even where
[1:03:50] Pentecost got off is relying upon the
[1:03:53] human Veil God sent them super
[1:03:55] Supernatural gifts is that right and
[1:03:58] brother BR says that you have taken the
[1:04:00] supernatural gifts and made a tradition
[1:04:03] out of genuine articles it it had to
[1:04:05] always happen it had to always be this
[1:04:07] way and so when it wasn't when it when
[1:04:10] God God every way that God works brother
[1:04:12] B says you'll never pull something out
[1:04:14] of God God is Sovereign amen it's always
[1:04:18] Sovereign and so we always want to be in
[1:04:20] that place as we been looking at this
[1:04:22] for some weeks of just being in a place
[1:04:24] to where we're a channel that
[1:04:26] inspiration can drop into because we're
[1:04:29] made we we are the listen if there's
[1:04:32] anybody upon the face of the Earth and
[1:04:34] I'm not elevating us I'm just saying I'm
[1:04:36] elevating God's forn knowledge that if
[1:04:39] there is ever a people that is to be
[1:04:42] inspired that inspiration can only come
[1:04:45] and move within the seed of God that can
[1:04:48] actually be inspired by God the same
[1:04:52] inspiration that struck the prophets and
[1:04:54] they would write beyond their own
[1:04:56] understanding now the same inspiration
[1:04:58] comes upon the word to make the word
[1:05:00] live and that inspiration operating
[1:05:02] through you and I it makes it makes the
[1:05:06] word or interprets it according to how
[1:05:09] God thought it and he spoke it so there
[1:05:11] is no glory of our own amen God has set
[1:05:16] this atmosphere and that's where Satan
[1:05:18] he wants to try to always to poke that
[1:05:21] atmosphere always trying to get us out
[1:05:23] of that atmosphere and try to you know
[1:05:26] bring us down within things but remember
[1:05:29] it's the word that creates the
[1:05:31] atmosphere it's not mind over matter
[1:05:33] it's not positive thinking because the
[1:05:35] only thing that's positive is the word
[1:05:38] of God that's what's that's where we get
[1:05:40] into the real things that are positive
[1:05:43] and so now here comes a need of a
[1:05:46] situation we need water and water is a
[1:05:49] type of the spirit of God we need this
[1:05:52] water and the inspiration comes upon
[1:05:54] Elisha and he says get your shovels out
[1:05:57] thus saith the Lord make this Valley
[1:05:59] full of ditches I don't know about you
[1:06:02] but sometimes you know you can get tired
[1:06:04] of digging certain things you know
[1:06:05] brother Willie you know what I'm talking
[1:06:07] about you can get tired of digging but
[1:06:09] can you imagine they might have got a
[1:06:10] little tired when they were digging but
[1:06:12] you know what you want water we want
[1:06:14] more water we just don't want a trickle
[1:06:16] of water we just don't want a trickle of
[1:06:18] water God has promised us in this hour
[1:06:21] not a trickle of
[1:06:23] water even as it shows in the Book of
[1:06:26] Ezekiel we're not even called to ankle
[1:06:28] deep water we're not even called to
[1:06:31] waste deep water but we are called to
[1:06:34] water that you can swim in Hallelujah
[1:06:37] and what that speaks of in the Book of
[1:06:40] Ezekiel we are called to a complete full
[1:06:43] Birth by the word of God that has been
[1:06:46] delivered through Malachi 4 we have
[1:06:49] received a word from God that brings
[1:06:52] complete and total Deliverance through a
[1:06:55] complete relying upon almighty
[1:06:59] God I thank God for his grace Amen to
[1:07:03] lead us on out into those places and and
[1:07:06] give us Grace and so here notice he said
[1:07:08] for thus sayith the Lord You shall not
[1:07:10] see wind you neither shall you see rain
[1:07:13] yet that Valley shall be filled with
[1:07:16] water that ye may drink both ye and your
[1:07:19] cattle and your Beast it's going to have
[1:07:21] to be a lot of water because they've
[1:07:23] also got to take care of the cattle and
[1:07:25] the Beast
[1:07:26] East Now watch how brother BR says this
[1:07:29] and humble thyself he says just keep
[1:07:31] praying keep digging yeah don't stop
[1:07:34] just like Elijah told him dig ditches
[1:07:37] out there when you get down and you hit
[1:07:39] an old Tin Can how many ever been
[1:07:41] digging and hitting
[1:07:43] things rocks and everything else yeah
[1:07:46] when you hit an old tin can say I'm too
[1:07:49] tired I mean sometimes I've dug and I've
[1:07:51] hit
[1:07:53] Roots I mean you almost feel like where
[1:07:55] do I where do I go on or do I just look
[1:07:58] the planet somewhere
[1:07:59] else when you hit an old 10 can say I'm
[1:08:02] too tired throw it out of the way and
[1:08:06] keep
[1:08:07] digging just keep digging cause we've
[1:08:11] got to dig we just got to dig that's all
[1:08:14] because if you expect to miss the
[1:08:16] tribulation you better start digging now
[1:08:19] for myself I'm preaching to myself there
[1:08:22] I'm going to start digging deeper than I
[1:08:25] ever
[1:08:26] Doug how many want to dig a Little
[1:08:29] Deeper amen I I certainly want to dig a
[1:08:32] little deeper and how that the spirit of
[1:08:34] God would so move through our lives that
[1:08:36] to comb out the things that maybe you
[1:08:39] know it's something that goes much
[1:08:40] deeper than maybe the trench where we're
[1:08:42] at right now but the ditch the deeper
[1:08:44] that we can dig it out the brother R
[1:08:46] says the more you can dig out the more
[1:08:49] of the water of the spirit that flow
[1:08:52] from Emmanuel's veins can flow out to
[1:08:54] you because it's a supernatural working
[1:08:58] they didn't have to supply the water God
[1:09:01] supplied the water it was a supernatural
[1:09:05] happening all they had to do was get the
[1:09:07] dirt out of the way and let me tell you
[1:09:09] the biggest pile of dirt is this right
[1:09:11] here and you right there that that's the
[1:09:14] dirt we got to get out of the way the
[1:09:15] Earth this Humanity that that that so
[1:09:18] much of the carnality God help me to dig
[1:09:21] it out of the way that the spirit of God
[1:09:24] can flow right down
[1:09:25] as a
[1:09:27] channel that's right so we want to look
[1:09:29] at one of these hindrances here this
[1:09:31] morning we want to deal with this
[1:09:33] subtleness of
[1:09:35] pride pride you know as we can speak of
[1:09:38] it is you know brother BR would classify
[1:09:40] it and he would talk about those tiny he
[1:09:43] says it like this tiny horrible Little
[1:09:46] Devils called
[1:09:47] pride and he would speak of them in in
[1:09:50] that way and you know in different
[1:09:52] things of how pride is one of the worst
[1:09:53] things that the devil could ever put on
[1:09:56] you and remember that Pride itself when
[1:09:59] we consider it I want you to cons I want
[1:10:02] you to look at it and think of it in
[1:10:04] this way when you look down through the
[1:10:06] scriptures and looking with things Pride
[1:10:08] itself is really a condition of what's
[1:10:11] going on in the
[1:10:14] heart it's things that that the thoughts
[1:10:17] that are there now listen e every one of
[1:10:20] us we have to battle because let me
[1:10:22] remind you this first birth is a product
[1:10:26] of Pride against the word of
[1:10:29] God when Eve herself took some was
[1:10:33] talked into taking some better way and
[1:10:36] talked into it by the fact of that you
[1:10:40] shall be as God's God had already given
[1:10:43] his word which was to bring the
[1:10:46] atmosphere of Faith but when she begin
[1:10:49] to listen to Satan's wisdom wisdom begin
[1:10:53] to just kind of hinder the Faith as she
[1:10:57] listened to it let me tell you Satan
[1:10:59] isn't going to hold back from Earthly
[1:11:01] wisdom or from his wisdom attacking the
[1:11:03] word of God the prophet said every time
[1:11:06] that God reveals something to you he
[1:11:09] said Satan will always come and try to
[1:11:11] show you all the defects within it and
[1:11:14] he says just as faith has an atmosphere
[1:11:18] wisdom has an atmosphere as well wisdom
[1:11:21] if we begin to listen to wisdom and
[1:11:23] looking at how can this be how's that
[1:11:25] going to happen it can bring about doubt
[1:11:27] and Gloom and we can get down is that
[1:11:29] right and wisdom itself it can also come
[1:11:32] and a and an atmosphere can actually uh
[1:11:35] cause us to raise up and do something or
[1:11:37] act out on something that is actually
[1:11:40] ahead of God's timing and his
[1:11:43] program Satan is always at work and it's
[1:11:47] so subtle how Pride will come in there I
[1:11:50] mean think here they were great meetings
[1:11:53] in heaven and here the the subtleness
[1:11:56] that came in in in in heaven where
[1:12:00] Lucifer got lifted up in his heart he
[1:12:04] was sitting right in the presence of God
[1:12:07] do you realize he was God's right-hand
[1:12:09] man Ezekiel called him the cherubim that
[1:12:13] coverthe was also he was so close to God
[1:12:18] like a a rightand man of Fellowship but
[1:12:21] it just goes to show that no matter how
[1:12:23] close that a person can be that Pride
[1:12:27] itself is always there to try to work
[1:12:30] right in I I tell you friends we've seen
[1:12:33] it throughout the ranks and times like
[1:12:35] that that it can take many times even a
[1:12:38] supporting Ministry that Pride can get
[1:12:41] in there and pride would begin to move
[1:12:43] and it'll break things apart and though
[1:12:45] it might look like well I'm not apart
[1:12:47] from the word but if our spirit is not
[1:12:51] with the spirit of the word it doesn't
[1:12:53] matter how right we are here with the
[1:12:56] letter it's the spirit that gives
[1:13:01] life Hallelujah the spirit doesn't
[1:13:04] travel by our knowledge the spirit
[1:13:07] Travels by the conviction of the
[1:13:09] Revelation in our heart and there's a
[1:13:11] confidence in this word and when that
[1:13:14] confidence is there and it's flowing in
[1:13:16] our life it's not us taking the message
[1:13:19] it's the spirit taking the message to
[1:13:22] the people of God
[1:13:25] that's right I don't care if a man can
[1:13:27] preach his way out of a paper bag he
[1:13:29] doesn't have to be a good preacher to be
[1:13:31] used of
[1:13:33] God come on
[1:13:35] Friends it has to be a vessel that
[1:13:38] surrendered that that get out of the way
[1:13:40] and bring Jesus Christ on the scene he's
[1:13:44] the one that's to be lifted up in this
[1:13:46] hour if God if it took some great
[1:13:48] preacher and and don't misunderstand me
[1:13:50] to me brother brandom is a masterful
[1:13:52] preacher and I I don't say that because
[1:13:54] of eloquence I I I I just I read when I
[1:13:57] read the prayers when I I'm listening in
[1:13:59] my heart I what it is is that here is a
[1:14:02] life that's so humble
[1:14:06] right God showed you and I he took an
[1:14:09] example he didn't even have a seventh
[1:14:11] grade education and God showed you and I
[1:14:14] it doesn't take intellects because God
[1:14:17] doesn't need
[1:14:19] intellects it's just a surrendered
[1:14:21] vessel that knows they're nothing
[1:14:27] and that's where Lucifer he he got
[1:14:29] lifted up and himself and pride come in
[1:14:32] and you know every time you read through
[1:14:34] the scriptures from Isaiah 14 which I
[1:14:37] referred to then you can go into e
[1:14:40] Ezekiel and you find that there it was
[1:14:42] the prince of Tyrus that same Spirit got
[1:14:45] upon him and he be got lifted up in his
[1:14:48] heart he began to you know look at
[1:14:51] everything and remember the prophet of
[1:14:53] God Ezekiel I identified that spirit
[1:14:56] that was working in the kings of Tyrus
[1:14:58] and he identified it not as a present
[1:15:01] happening but he identified it clear
[1:15:03] back when the when the volcanics of this
[1:15:06] Earth were belching
[1:15:08] forth and he talked about the beauty
[1:15:10] that was within Lucifer and he said oh
[1:15:14] you were beautiful until the day that
[1:15:16] iniquity was found in thine heart he had
[1:15:19] it you know you say well how could it be
[1:15:21] beautiful because he was created by God
[1:15:25] right when God create are you hearing me
[1:15:27] now when God creates by his word it's a
[1:15:30] beauty that has some substance to it
[1:15:33] Satan wants to try to smear these
[1:15:35] different things as though that this is
[1:15:37] beauty we don't want to be Satan's model
[1:15:40] we do not want to be he his his one that
[1:15:43] parades his his stles around and what he
[1:15:46] we don't want to be that we want to take
[1:15:48] up on the beauty which is of a real
[1:15:52] character Lord hallelujah
[1:15:55] Hallelujah now the Bible says the fear
[1:15:59] which is the reverence the worship of
[1:16:02] the Lord is to hate
[1:16:05] evil pride and arrogancy and the evil
[1:16:09] way and the forward mouth do I
[1:16:13] hate I want to read you this prayer
[1:16:17] I it's just turn me around
[1:16:22] that just stay with me I'm trying to
[1:16:24] make sure my eyes can see
[1:16:27] it brother brand said kind heavenly
[1:16:30] father I I just want you to listen to
[1:16:31] this we approach thee in the name of thy
[1:16:34] beloved Child Jesus to thank thee for
[1:16:37] the blessings that thou Hast given to us
[1:16:39] we unworthy people and thou has redeemed
[1:16:43] us all together by Grace by election of
[1:16:46] God thou has called us into this blessed
[1:16:48] hope that we have tonight in Christ
[1:16:50] Jesus and we thank thee for it and now
[1:16:53] as we're gathered here tonight in this
[1:16:55] lovely big city we pray that you'll come
[1:16:58] down into our midst there's no building
[1:17:00] on earth worthy for you to step into
[1:17:04] there's no people worthy for you to
[1:17:06] speak to but thou has not considered
[1:17:09] that Hallelujah aren't you glad for that
[1:17:12] amen hallelujah notice he says you've
[1:17:15] come uh to the poorest to the low to the
[1:17:19] ignorant to the outcast and we thank
[1:17:22] thee for we're so glad that you're a God
[1:17:25] like that what could we do if you were
[1:17:28] hoty and indifferent right but thou are
[1:17:32] not that kind of a father you're sweet
[1:17:34] and loving forgiving and that just makes
[1:17:37] us love you that much more amen now
[1:17:40] father now father you don't beat us as
[1:17:43] the cruelty of a serpent but thou loves
[1:17:46] us as the love of a father Can Only Love
[1:17:48] forgive us Lord we are all guilty of sin
[1:17:51] and indifference towards thee and let
[1:17:54] the blood blood thy blood atone for us
[1:17:56] tonight and he goes on to say in the
[1:17:58] next few words Lord circumcise the lips
[1:18:02] and may Jesus Christ be exalted not only
[1:18:05] our lips and our hearts but may he be
[1:18:07] exalted before this audience tonight
[1:18:10] amen just say it like this how God
[1:18:13] chooses brother Brandman says it like
[1:18:15] this to meet in the Realms of men he
[1:18:17] said sometimes God would
[1:18:19] meet in great company of men sometimes
[1:18:23] God would meet there's a scripture were
[1:18:26] 500 that were there not all of them went
[1:18:28] on into the upper room but 500 500 of
[1:18:31] them there was a meeting that was there
[1:18:33] but then we know that after that brother
[1:18:36] Brown would say and yet here's times
[1:18:38] where God will meet with just one he met
[1:18:42] with the woman at the
[1:18:43] well I I mean to tell you the truth God
[1:18:46] you know God when you get to looking at
[1:18:48] it right here this morning and I think
[1:18:50] it'd be something we can just apply to
[1:18:51] our hearts we we we can be sitting here
[1:18:54] with a number of people but I believe
[1:18:56] that God comes to have a meeting with
[1:18:58] every one of us in a personal way I
[1:19:01] believe God comes to speak to us in a
[1:19:03] very personal way and and we're not
[1:19:05] worthy of it I'm not worthy of it it
[1:19:07] don't matter it doesn't matter what
[1:19:08] where you and I are at there's nothing
[1:19:10] that we have done that is worthy of his
[1:19:13] presence to come among us but there's
[1:19:15] one thing that that will always invite
[1:19:17] him is a heart that is humble before him
[1:19:21] and say Lord come and speak to me Lord
[1:19:24] Lord come and move upon my life Lord I
[1:19:26] need you you may be things you're
[1:19:28] praying about the decisions in your life
[1:19:30] and here you are you didn't leave them
[1:19:32] out in your car and you truly you didn't
[1:19:35] do that sometimes we can get them so on
[1:19:37] our minds that they can actually they
[1:19:39] can actually cause our minds to go here
[1:19:41] depending on how weighty the decisions
[1:19:43] can be but you know if you can just lay
[1:19:45] them before God I believe God I I know
[1:19:48] he will I've experienced it where he'll
[1:19:50] come and give you an answer it may not
[1:19:53] exactly be the answer that we're looking
[1:19:55] for it may not even be the answer all
[1:19:59] the way every step of the way but God
[1:20:01] knows how to bring us to where as it
[1:20:04] were the dials of our life become so
[1:20:07] tuned into a place the prophet would say
[1:20:10] it like this he said oh that we can
[1:20:12] become tuned down to his presence and to
[1:20:16] recognize that the angels of God are
[1:20:18] here as a matter of fact to recognize
[1:20:20] the theophanies of God and here we are
[1:20:23] he said if we can become tuned down I'm
[1:20:25] not tuned up tuned down in humility to
[1:20:29] his presence so Lord take the dials of
[1:20:32] my life Lord and let them be tuned right
[1:20:35] Lord to where it'll be timed into the
[1:20:37] frequency of the Supernatural and the
[1:20:40] inspiration of God can flow if there's
[1:20:43] any static of Pride Lord Lord let the
[1:20:46] static of Pride be put aside Lord show
[1:20:49] me Lord let the dials Lord I don't want
[1:20:51] my hands but I want your hands upon the
[1:20:54] dials of my life Lord I want a clear
[1:20:59] picture Hallelujah God knows exactly how
[1:21:02] to meet in our life and just to remind
[1:21:04] us it's all because of his love you know
[1:21:07] when when listen friends if we can just
[1:21:09] always keep this before us and and
[1:21:12] thinking about God's mercy and his
[1:21:14] goodness I I don't care how far that God
[1:21:17] has brought you don't ever forget that
[1:21:19] it's him that's done
[1:21:21] it this is one this is one of the Great
[1:21:24] this is one of the greatest uh if I
[1:21:26] could say it like this dynamite against
[1:21:29] pride is remembering that without him
[1:21:32] we're
[1:21:33] nothing Hallelujah but like brother Bram
[1:21:35] said he said oh the think like that
[1:21:37] quote I read he comes to the outcast he
[1:21:39] comes to the lowly he comes to to those
[1:21:42] who don't deserve it and we never one
[1:21:44] deserved it brother B said I think of
[1:21:46] little Rosella Griffith setting up there
[1:21:48] he said in the balcony an alcoholic he
[1:21:51] said nobody wanted anything to do with
[1:21:53] her he said but God cared so much he
[1:21:57] went right there to her heart and
[1:21:59] discerned that
[1:22:00] heart he let her heart out of the
[1:22:03] condition she was in she was buried in
[1:22:06] shame it looked like there was no way
[1:22:08] out but God was not hoty and indifferent
[1:22:11] he went right to her need he led her in
[1:22:16] Deliverance she became a testimony of
[1:22:19] God's delivering
[1:22:22] Grace I'll tell you what I think of that
[1:22:25] my heart just oh I tell you I begin to
[1:22:28] reflect on that last night and I said
[1:22:30] God if it wasn't for your mercy Lord
[1:22:33] where would I be
[1:22:35] Lord if it wasn't for your mercy Lord
[1:22:39] the direction I was headed but Mercy
[1:22:43] stepped
[1:22:45] in I didn't turn my heart he turned my
[1:22:53] heart I'm not here because of what I did
[1:22:57] it's here because his grace overr my
[1:23:01] will my will even looked at it through a
[1:23:04] natural way and say I can't do it but
[1:23:07] his
[1:23:10] will it overrun and said I'm your
[1:23:13] wayall I'm your
[1:23:19] way so always remember it's because of
[1:23:22] his love
[1:23:25] this is why God would tell him there in
[1:23:27] Deuteronomy thou are a holy people unto
[1:23:30] the Lord thy God God don't have no
[1:23:32] problems reminding his people who they
[1:23:35] are you're a set aside people unto the
[1:23:38] Lord not to your own thoughts not to
[1:23:40] your own thinking you have been
[1:23:42] purchased by me I redeemed you amen the
[1:23:46] Lord thy God ha chosen thee to be a
[1:23:49] special people unto himself above all
[1:23:51] people that are upon the face of the
[1:23:53] Earth the Lord did not set his love upon
[1:23:56] you nor choose you because you were more
[1:23:59] in number than any other people you were
[1:24:01] the fewest of all people but because the
[1:24:04] Lord loved you and because he would keep
[1:24:07] the oath which he had sworn unto his
[1:24:10] fathers ha the Lord brought you out with
[1:24:12] a mighty hand and redeemed you out of
[1:24:15] the house of bondman from the hand of
[1:24:17] pharaoh king of
[1:24:19] Egypt God kept his
[1:24:22] promise his love that's been bestowed
[1:24:25] upon us is him coming in this age and
[1:24:29] not only revealing his word but
[1:24:31] vindicating it with his presence and
[1:24:34] touching our life that's the love of
[1:24:36] almighty
[1:24:38] God and he's shown his love to you and I
[1:24:41] let me tell you when he descended in
[1:24:44] Revelations 10 the mighty Angel he had a
[1:24:47] rainbow round about his
[1:24:50] head his whole coming is his mind was on
[1:24:53] his com
[1:24:55] his Covenant is his word his word is his
[1:24:59] thoughts his thoughts is his heart he
[1:25:02] has never departed from
[1:25:05] it Mission has never been
[1:25:12] aborted no matter how bad it ever looked
[1:25:16] God's never had a button he don't have a
[1:25:18] button that says abort Mission he
[1:25:20] doesn't have that and I'm talking about
[1:25:22] not only on his plan but you're part of
[1:25:25] his
[1:25:27] plan you might have looked for a button
[1:25:30] many times but there is no button in
[1:25:33] God's word of abort
[1:25:35] Mission but it's God bringing us into a
[1:25:38] place to realize I have begun this good
[1:25:41] work in you and I will perform it until
[1:25:46] the day of Jesus
[1:25:48] [Applause]
[1:25:50] Christ right up to the nanc before the
[1:25:53] rapture I'll be
[1:25:59] working I'm glad about that aren't you
[1:26:02] I'm glad that God didn't send a message
[1:26:04] and say you know what I'll just sit by
[1:26:05] the clock and wait for the time to get
[1:26:06] there it's Friday you know we can just
[1:26:08] chill out drink sweet tea there's only
[1:26:10] three more hours left we'll just we'll
[1:26:12] just wait but God said no I've sent a
[1:26:14] word because the word itself if the word
[1:26:17] don't take flesh then the word itself
[1:26:19] has not actually produced what the word
[1:26:22] has announced that he's come to do
[1:26:24] because the word God delivered his
[1:26:26] message and now the same spirit of God
[1:26:28] coming back around and is taking that
[1:26:31] message and that message is being sown
[1:26:34] into the hearts and lives of the people
[1:26:36] and it's the same spirit of God that
[1:26:38] comes right behind that word and
[1:26:40] vindicates it where the Dynamics come
[1:26:43] upon the mechanics to make that word
[1:26:45] live amen sometimes we want Dynamics
[1:26:48] just like this but you know it all has
[1:26:49] to start with the mechanics if you don't
[1:26:51] have no mechanics what are the Dynamics
[1:26:53] going to produce
[1:26:55] right I mean it can produce excitement
[1:26:57] but we're not that's not the goal God's
[1:26:59] not coming to Rapture excitement he's
[1:27:01] come to Rapture the word because when it
[1:27:04] is an excitement brought by the word
[1:27:06] it's a joy that rises on the inside to
[1:27:08] know that I'm not here because of me I
[1:27:11] have not done this because of me but the
[1:27:13] grace of God has slipped down from that
[1:27:16] realm and it's dropped into my
[1:27:19] heart and of a way that I cannot see out
[1:27:22] God himself has an in my eyes to see and
[1:27:26] I see Victory I see Victory I see myself
[1:27:30] as a conqueror in Christ
[1:27:32] [Applause]
[1:27:35] Jesus thank you Lord this is why Paul
[1:27:38] you know Paul warned he he wasn't just
[1:27:42] warning the early uh church but he was
[1:27:46] warning all the way down through that
[1:27:48] don't get in your your mind that well
[1:27:50] you know God blinded Israel and look at
[1:27:53] us andul said don't don't boast no don't
[1:27:56] boast he said they they they they were
[1:27:58] blinded for our sakes that's
[1:28:02] right see God had a hidden
[1:28:05] Mystery God had a bride for
[1:28:08] Joseph God had a mystery that he was
[1:28:11] going to take a people for his name sake
[1:28:14] he hadn't forgot about
[1:28:16] Israel Hallelujah why we've been in this
[1:28:18] Feast he hadn't forgot about
[1:28:21] Israel amen it's ready at that moment to
[1:28:24] turn we are it is
[1:28:28] ripe for the Rapture and the anointing
[1:28:31] of the Holy Spirit that's upon the bride
[1:28:34] to fall upon those two
[1:28:36] witnesses that will stand there with the
[1:28:39] characteristic of Moses and Elijah's
[1:28:42] Ministry and call the people back to the
[1:28:45] true
[1:28:47] atonement so Paul said don't boast don't
[1:28:49] boast don't
[1:28:51] boast he said it in these words you said
[1:28:53] be not High
[1:28:55] minded but fear be reverence the grace
[1:28:58] of God has come by our way and without
[1:29:00] him we're nothing amen this is why the
[1:29:03] why the prophet said not him that
[1:29:05] runneth or him that willth but God shows
[1:29:08] Mercy it's God does it you can't brag on
[1:29:10] it at all there's not a thing that you
[1:29:13] did God by Grace saved you not you
[1:29:15] yourself if you got something to brag
[1:29:18] about but but you haven't got nothing to
[1:29:20] brag all Praises goes to him it's
[1:29:25] him this is why we are his
[1:29:30] achievement see it's not it's not us
[1:29:33] it's not us trying to achieve something
[1:29:34] say you know Satan would like for us to
[1:29:37] look at that well I have to become this
[1:29:39] or I have to do this and and what he's
[1:29:41] trying to do is draw us out in our own
[1:29:44] human efforts that's right now listen
[1:29:48] human efforts and yielding are not the
[1:29:51] same thing right yielding is where you
[1:29:54] release your strength to
[1:29:58] him you let him take your hand and guide
[1:30:01] it into the sleeve here and then guide
[1:30:03] it into the sleeve there is that right
[1:30:06] right now I want you to think within
[1:30:09] this we we're not we're not our own
[1:30:11] achievement we're not the achievement of
[1:30:13] some church we are the achievement of
[1:30:16] Jesus
[1:30:17] Christ let me tell you the message that
[1:30:20] God has delivered to you in this hour
[1:30:22] was the achievement of whereare that God
[1:30:25] was not able this is the prophet's word
[1:30:27] in the message token thew in the Earthly
[1:30:29] Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ where
[1:30:31] the Prophet said he was not able to
[1:30:34] break through there meaning that and
[1:30:36] they everywhere he was going they were
[1:30:38] disbelieving and even in his hometown
[1:30:40] running him out didn't want nothing to
[1:30:42] do with him and then the religious
[1:30:44] called him be elub and everything else
[1:30:46] remember the Bible said many mighty
[1:30:48] works could he not
[1:30:50] do I want you to think about it the all
[1:30:54] that the Living God that that created
[1:30:57] the very world the Earth that they were
[1:31:00] standing on and it shows that because of
[1:31:02] their
[1:31:03] unbelief he could not do many mighty
[1:31:06] Works he could have did it but if he
[1:31:08] would have went ahead and did it that
[1:31:09] would have been
[1:31:11] Pride are you with me it would have been
[1:31:14] showing what he could do he was tested
[1:31:17] we know that the Temptations is that
[1:31:18] right but the prophet tells us in the
[1:31:20] message token he said but notice he said
[1:31:23] he's finally been able to break
[1:31:27] through and he said think about the
[1:31:29] countless Miracles that he's done he
[1:31:31] said notice I didn't say I did
[1:31:34] them he did
[1:31:36] them brother Randon would say in false
[1:31:39] anointed ones at the end time he would
[1:31:41] say it is not what I knew it's what I
[1:31:45] surrendered myself to I'm not the one
[1:31:48] who performs these Miracles I just
[1:31:51] happen to be present
[1:31:54] when he does
[1:31:57] it and God moved through that vessel
[1:32:00] that friends listen that was not just a
[1:32:03] quote for you and I to to to just look
[1:32:05] at that was a statement that God was
[1:32:08] making to the Bride of Jesus Christ he's
[1:32:11] letting you and I know all you have to
[1:32:13] do is be standing present standing
[1:32:16] present where standing on the side of
[1:32:19] the Lord and when you stand on the side
[1:32:22] of the Lord then the Supernatural will
[1:32:25] follow the
[1:32:27] word Miracles follow when the word goes
[1:32:30] first amen right the wine never came
[1:32:35] before the water was in the vessels the
[1:32:38] water in the vessels led to the wine
[1:32:41] amen the woman of zarapa first went and
[1:32:44] made ready for cakes then the miracle
[1:32:46] followed right is that right that's why
[1:32:50] when the scripture said repent and be
[1:32:52] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:32:54] the remission of your sins and then the
[1:32:56] miracle will
[1:33:01] come we his
[1:33:03] achievement this is why when Paul would
[1:33:06] write now you notice when Paul would
[1:33:08] write this by the spirit of God if none
[1:33:11] of these
[1:33:12] things had anything to do among a body
[1:33:17] of Believers among a church then he
[1:33:19] never would have wrote it he would have
[1:33:20] just they just put separate books in the
[1:33:22] Bible but it's showing how that spirits
[1:33:25] will try to work to bring hindrances
[1:33:28] sure and Satan is so subtle brother BR
[1:33:32] says I say through or no Paul said I say
[1:33:34] through the grace given unto me to every
[1:33:36] man that is among you not to think of
[1:33:39] himself more highly than he ought to
[1:33:43] think that's true is that
[1:33:46] right now that don't mean that you
[1:33:48] walking around and running yourself in
[1:33:50] the ground cuz that's not humility
[1:33:51] either that's right
[1:33:55] are you hearing me a lot of times what
[1:33:57] that is that's
[1:33:59] excuses but humility is recognizing the
[1:34:03] God who is speaking and that it's him
[1:34:06] that comes to fulfill his word through
[1:34:08] our lives and US surrendering through
[1:34:10] him that's God's
[1:34:13] program it's not the instrumentality of
[1:34:16] man God has not entrusted it to his
[1:34:19] church do this perform this but he has
[1:34:22] entrusted his word to himself and he is
[1:34:26] the word this is why that they were
[1:34:29] required to go wait for the Holy Ghost
[1:34:32] to be endued with power from on high not
[1:34:35] just to live a good life one or two or
[1:34:38] three days out of the week but to be ued
[1:34:40] with quickening power that will make
[1:34:43] that word live and make it come to life
[1:34:45] and will produce the same life that was
[1:34:48] within the Corporal body of Jesus Christ
[1:34:52] amen and so it's God working through his
[1:34:58] Machinery hallelujah it's God working
[1:35:01] that's good you see when God works
[1:35:04] through his channels it's God that's
[1:35:08] shown right but when when man cuz we
[1:35:12] know man can can get under the anointing
[1:35:15] can preach and all those other things
[1:35:17] but it's always got to come back to the
[1:35:19] display of the word of
[1:35:22] God I want you to think how when brother
[1:35:25] Brown would say go on to say this let me
[1:35:27] finish reading the scripture but to
[1:35:28] think
[1:35:30] soberly how incredible to think soberly
[1:35:33] that it's it's
[1:35:35] God it's not me come on Amen to think
[1:35:39] soberly we're in a we're in an age
[1:35:41] friend where you can look you you could
[1:35:43] become drunk without going to a bar
[1:35:45] because I'm not talking about natural
[1:35:46] thing you can become intoxicated with
[1:35:48] the cares of life you can become
[1:35:50] intoxicated with politics you can become
[1:35:53] intoxic at with sports on come on
[1:35:56] whatever you're drinking is how you
[1:35:57] starting feeding or
[1:36:00] acting be careful what bottle you're
[1:36:02] hitting on you want to make sure you're
[1:36:04] hitting on the new wine that brings a
[1:36:07] stimulation a revelation that is putting
[1:36:09] you under the inspiration of the word of
[1:36:12] God in this hour that this world is not
[1:36:15] my hope I'm just passing
[1:36:19] through to think
[1:36:22] soberly and takes courageous yeah
[1:36:26] according as god notice who has done
[1:36:28] this God has dealt to every man a
[1:36:30] Measure of Faith this why brother brand
[1:36:32] would say over and over through the
[1:36:33] message and I just marvel as I just go
[1:36:36] through and comb some of these things
[1:36:37] again when brother brand was said you
[1:36:39] know he was asked countless times and
[1:36:40] brother R refer this all the way up in
[1:36:42] into 65 there where he says where people
[1:36:45] he said here they've been filled with
[1:36:46] the Holy Ghost and he said there were
[1:36:47] some of them begin to come to me and say
[1:36:48] now that we've been filled with the
[1:36:50] spirit of God shall we begin to seek for
[1:36:52] spiritual gifts it's natural I mean when
[1:36:55] listen let me just say it to you like
[1:36:56] this when God does something for your
[1:36:58] life it's it's a natural thing to want
[1:37:01] to serve
[1:37:03] him I don't know I you know you don't
[1:37:05] know what capacity that God's going to
[1:37:07] have you to serve in but the think about
[1:37:10] you say well is that scripture yes it
[1:37:12] was when Paul met him on the road to
[1:37:14] Damascus what did he say what would you
[1:37:18] have me
[1:37:20] do that's the same thing when it came to
[1:37:23] Moses it was God revealing to Moses the
[1:37:26] commission so let me just tell you the
[1:37:28] revelation of this word does not come to
[1:37:31] produce sedentary complacent
[1:37:35] people come on brother if the holy
[1:37:38] spirit that was within the living
[1:37:40] creatures would put them in motion with
[1:37:42] the word if that same spirit is in us
[1:37:45] then our steps of our life are always
[1:37:48] forward and in the work of God for what
[1:37:51] God has called us to do it will
[1:37:54] highlight Jesus
[1:38:00] Christ homies with the right attitude
[1:38:03] but B said you know and and just think
[1:38:05] about the subtleness now think about
[1:38:07] subtleness how the attitude can slip in
[1:38:10] there brother BR says like a man you
[1:38:12] know always wants to do something he
[1:38:14] said that's usually that's the people
[1:38:16] God's not going to use
[1:38:17] right he said but it's usually those and
[1:38:20] brother R will say it it's those who
[1:38:21] wanting to get away from it even when
[1:38:23] God would make knowing something to do
[1:38:24] and they'll say me no way not me I'm not
[1:38:26] the one for that Lord no that's exact
[1:38:28] that's the exact words of the prophet he
[1:38:30] said like you take one guy that'll say
[1:38:32] Lord give me the power to move mountains
[1:38:33] I tell you I'll do something for you
[1:38:35] Lord if you let me move mountains
[1:38:36] brother Bram said no he wouldn't because
[1:38:38] he can't even move himself to the right
[1:38:44] attitude see the word discerns
[1:38:47] motives and
[1:38:50] objectives the word is alive amen it is
[1:38:55] amen are you with me true the word is
[1:38:58] alive and this is why brother Bram could
[1:39:00] say the M he said many of the times he
[1:39:02] said every one of us have a Ministry now
[1:39:03] he breaks it up into the whole part of
[1:39:05] the body dealing with when we come into
[1:39:07] the land with Housewives and everything
[1:39:09] else it's God working through every one
[1:39:10] of those channels and he said many of
[1:39:12] the times God has to drive us into the
[1:39:15] correct
[1:39:16] Ministry because you see even in some of
[1:39:19] those points and some of those things we
[1:39:22] always have to be careful God knows what
[1:39:24] we're able to handle amen and and let me
[1:39:27] just tell you this right here God has
[1:39:29] not God gifts and callings are without
[1:39:34] repentance you know the Rich Young Ruler
[1:39:37] he had the gift to be an
[1:39:38] evangelist brother Brown picks that up
[1:39:41] he says where he was and he lifted up
[1:39:43] his eyes in hell and he said go tell
[1:39:47] send somebody from here not where I'm at
[1:39:50] but over there in Abraham's bosom where
[1:39:52] the promise
[1:39:53] send somebody back and tell them don't
[1:39:55] come the way I've
[1:39:57] come right brother B said that was the
[1:40:00] call of evangelist if he would have just
[1:40:02] yielded his life to the
[1:40:05] Lord amen he could have used his
[1:40:08] influence hallelu God couldn't work
[1:40:11] through that upon the lives of others
[1:40:14] but he thought too much of his own
[1:40:17] possessions is so good true there's a
[1:40:21] lot we could deal with on that there let
[1:40:23] me tell you something when it all comes
[1:40:24] down to the Rapture listen friends if
[1:40:27] you're not in tune with God right now
[1:40:29] the Rapture you're not going to know
[1:40:31] when that's taking
[1:40:32] place if you're not in tune with him
[1:40:34] right now if there's anything that's
[1:40:36] that's distorting the Airways right now
[1:40:38] in your life you need to get that out of
[1:40:40] the way because the Rapture morning
[1:40:42] God's not going to clear out the
[1:40:43] airwaves that's what the washing of
[1:40:46] Water by the word is to do right now is
[1:40:48] to get all the channels cleared out and
[1:40:51] the token to be applied is because
[1:40:53] there's an urgency in this hour the
[1:40:56] geese start getting together this time
[1:40:57] of the year the birds start getting
[1:40:59] together they're getting ready for a
[1:41:01] great migration there's nobody has to
[1:41:04] tell them that they are born there's an
[1:41:07] instinct and the prophet says science
[1:41:10] calls it Instinct but I call it
[1:41:13] God
[1:41:16] hallelujah
[1:41:18] hallelujah it's a pulsation that moves
[1:41:21] in your heart that says clear this out
[1:41:23] lay that aside get this right get ready
[1:41:26] why oh my thank you Lord because the
[1:41:30] Rapture is upon
[1:41:32] us and I'm going to tell you friends
[1:41:35] this right here Rapture morning is not
[1:41:38] going to be something when we're going
[1:41:39] to get an alert on our phone the world
[1:41:42] will go on like they always have
[1:41:45] churches will go on have an altar cause
[1:41:48] and think they're getting
[1:41:50] saved you said the scripture on that the
[1:41:53] the Bible said whosoever is filthy let
[1:41:55] him be filthy still there'll be no
[1:41:57] salvation during the time of the
[1:42:01] tribulation let me tell you a little
[1:42:03] Glimpse as we saw I'm just going on this
[1:42:05] as he's taking me down there what
[1:42:07] happened in Western uh North Carolina
[1:42:09] and uh Eastern Tennessee down there
[1:42:12] where sister Gloria is from and in that
[1:42:14] area I'll tell you what that that how
[1:42:16] things that my goodness the mess that it
[1:42:19] it is right now that's only a little
[1:42:22] scratch yeah
[1:42:23] compared to what's going to be in the
[1:42:26] tribulation you think when Co and
[1:42:28] everything else come against us and look
[1:42:30] I'm not in here to talk politics and
[1:42:32] everything else let me just set it
[1:42:34] straight it's
[1:42:35] real Co won no fake thing it was a real
[1:42:39] [Applause]
[1:42:40] disease say am man if you want to or not
[1:42:43] that's a truth I'm not talking about
[1:42:45] what people did with it politicized and
[1:42:47] everything else but here's is what I'm
[1:42:48] trying to say those things like that are
[1:42:50] a minor thing
[1:42:53] oh yeah right but what's coming upon
[1:42:55] this earth right you might want to be
[1:42:58] careful cuz you might have a key to this
[1:43:00] church and you might be the only one
[1:43:01] sitting in here I'm not telling you that
[1:43:04] to scare you I'm saying in this hour hey
[1:43:07] it's an hour to get checking up cuz on
[1:43:09] Rapture morning brother nothing matters
[1:43:11] and you know what you need to live that
[1:43:13] kind of a life now that's what the Holy
[1:43:15] Ghost produces that's what real Joy
[1:43:17] produces it produces a life that is
[1:43:20] Carefree in the Holy Ghost and is
[1:43:23] enjoying itself in God I don't want to
[1:43:27] be bound down with everything else in
[1:43:29] the world I've been
[1:43:31] there are you hearing me I've been there
[1:43:34] I've been there where the devil wants to
[1:43:35] bind me down in my mind with the fences
[1:43:38] and everything else I don't want to live
[1:43:41] [Applause]
[1:43:50] there but Pride I'm trying to get
[1:43:53] somewhere
[1:43:55] here pride is the way to destruction yes
[1:43:58] it
[1:43:59] is all the way right to through
[1:44:02] destruction and you know what the devil
[1:44:05] has so much pride he wouldn't even get
[1:44:07] right right that is so good when the
[1:44:11] fall took place in Eden here the
[1:44:13] presence of God come down they had so
[1:44:15] much pride that they didn't come out
[1:44:17] running and say Lord forgive me I've
[1:44:20] fallen I've fallen but because God is
[1:44:24] Not hoty and
[1:44:26] indifferent he could have sat there and
[1:44:28] said now look what I told you look what
[1:44:31] you have done you have been terrible
[1:44:36] look what's no but he came down running
[1:44:39] through the garden crying
[1:44:42] out Adam where are you Adam where are
[1:44:45] you let me tell you brother and sister
[1:44:48] he came the same way down in our lives
[1:44:51] he came down in your life in my life
[1:44:53] your life might be a Garden of Eden now
[1:44:55] but it wasn't a Garden of Eden our lives
[1:44:57] were rubbish Heats but when he came in
[1:45:01] he's the sign of
[1:45:03] prosperity when he comes in our life
[1:45:06] he's the one that as it says in the time
[1:45:09] of the Millennium will cause the cactus
[1:45:11] in the desert to Blossom as a rose he's
[1:45:14] the one coming into our life where the
[1:45:17] channels have been open and the rivers
[1:45:19] of God are flowing it is him that is
[1:45:22] produced in our lives another Garden of
[1:45:24] Eden where he is habitating in our life
[1:45:28] as husband and wife together in a
[1:45:30] blessed Union
[1:45:32] am he's proving his victory right in the
[1:45:35] midst of Satan's
[1:45:39] Eden pride is the way to destruction yes
[1:45:45] it
[1:45:48] is the Bible said a hotty Spirit goes
[1:45:52] before a fall
[1:45:54] right that's a spirit listen friends
[1:45:56] that's a spirit that's upon this age
[1:46:00] Revelations 3 because thou sayest my I'm
[1:46:05] rich increase with Goods I don't got to
[1:46:09] need of
[1:46:11] nothing you know I I I don't need that I
[1:46:13] I I know I love God but I'm asking you
[1:46:16] do you love God enough to where you'll
[1:46:17] stand loyal to his word amen amen God's
[1:46:22] Des does want charter
[1:46:24] members God doesn't want your name on a
[1:46:27] book he he already put your name on the
[1:46:30] book before the foundation of the world
[1:46:32] Amen and that's the book that matters
[1:46:35] and if your name has been put there it
[1:46:37] is the character that matches the word
[1:46:41] when it's revealed in this hour it's
[1:46:43] like a magnet coming to a magnet it's
[1:46:46] magnetized to his presence
[1:46:50] amen but that's the spirit I I don't
[1:46:53] need of nothing I I don't I don't have
[1:46:54] to cater to that I don't have to bow
[1:46:55] down to that let me tell you something
[1:46:57] friends you know the prophet of God
[1:46:59] takes us over there and he says it like
[1:47:01] this in the Sixth Seal he speaks of how
[1:47:03] that in the Book of Revelations remember
[1:47:05] the Bible said they will seek for a
[1:47:06] place to
[1:47:08] hide because you know why they have
[1:47:10] rejected the hiding place that's been
[1:47:12] provided which is Christ Jesus the
[1:47:16] word and the Bible said they will call
[1:47:18] for the rocks and mountains to fall upon
[1:47:19] them the prophet said it like this in
[1:47:21] the message the second seal he said what
[1:47:23] it is they've sat in meetings just like
[1:47:25] this and they've turned down the
[1:47:27] presence of God dealing with their
[1:47:31] lives I say oh God let us be
[1:47:34] sensitive clear out every bit of Pride I
[1:47:37] I would rather listen friends it it
[1:47:39] doesn't it pride is not worth hanging on
[1:47:41] to Pride is not worth missing the
[1:47:44] Rapture for oh God give us Grace to let
[1:47:47] it be dug out of our
[1:47:50] Lives Amen Let me just try trying to
[1:47:53] narrow this down cuz there's no way that
[1:47:54] I'm going to get finished
[1:48:05] here I want you to think of
[1:48:08] this in the message humble
[1:48:11] thyself if you haven't listened that
[1:48:13] message in a while I don't know how many
[1:48:15] times I've listened that message over
[1:48:16] the
[1:48:16] years was like 32 minutes or something
[1:48:19] like that it's very very short message
[1:48:21] but that message message right there to
[1:48:23] me is such a it's such a key to the
[1:48:26] operation of the word of God in our
[1:48:29] lives you take that perfect strength
[1:48:31] perfect weakness so many of those things
[1:48:33] like that but let's just let's just try
[1:48:34] to hone in on this part of it here
[1:48:36] brother Bram says I've always found out
[1:48:38] that the man that humbles himself is the
[1:48:41] man that God exalts when you take a
[1:48:44] person with his chest out and knows
[1:48:46] everything and you can't tell him
[1:48:49] nothing and he is arrogant brother BR
[1:48:53] said that's a person that never gets
[1:48:56] anywhere so it's kind of like being on a
[1:48:58] treadmill you say you're going to go for
[1:49:00] a
[1:49:01] run you know I've got a treadmill in my
[1:49:03] basement I I now I used it I used it
[1:49:05] Faithfully for many years you can
[1:49:07] probably tell right now I can see you
[1:49:09] ain't using it
[1:49:12] now but I this is just me this ain't UNS
[1:49:15] spiritual so don't oh man I I just don't
[1:49:18] like staring at basement
[1:49:20] walls I try to listen to a mess message
[1:49:23] and things like that but I just don't
[1:49:24] like staring at basement walls gray
[1:49:26] walls and that's just me it ain't
[1:49:27] nothing spiritual it's just me I I I
[1:49:29] like getting out and walking like I mean
[1:49:31] if I even I got a bundle up and put hats
[1:49:33] on my head and and mittens on my hands I
[1:49:35] I I I like getting out into light but to
[1:49:38] think about
[1:49:39] it when when arrogancy is in our life
[1:49:42] it's like running on a
[1:49:44] treadmill you could have said man I ran
[1:49:46] miles
[1:49:48] today and didn't go
[1:49:51] nowhere right that's what arrogant now
[1:49:54] watch what it does it produces even a
[1:49:56] false sense of
[1:49:58] achievement that's a subtleness of Pride
[1:50:01] like I'm really getting somewhere and
[1:50:03] I'm really get and sometimes we can we
[1:50:05] can look at that maybe it can be even
[1:50:08] through what we are able to understand
[1:50:12] how our knowledge of the word will pick
[1:50:15] up and because listen friends let's just
[1:50:17] be honest we here we are by the grace of
[1:50:20] God not because of what we've merited
[1:50:22] but the message that God has delivered
[1:50:24] to you and I and God in his grace not
[1:50:27] only delivered it but opened our eyes to
[1:50:30] what we see is Jesus
[1:50:33] Christ I I mean God has delivered a
[1:50:36] perfect interpretation his mind his
[1:50:39] thoughts have been declared you think
[1:50:42] that it's not going to need the Divine
[1:50:44] accompaniment of his grace to help us
[1:50:47] remain humble come on oh brother Samuel
[1:50:49] I I've got all the strength I need to
[1:50:51] stay humble I it's it's wonderful we
[1:50:53] want to Humble ourselves by the love of
[1:50:56] God but God knows our abilities and he
[1:50:59] knows how to keep us
[1:51:02] humble he's more determined to fulfill
[1:51:06] his word through you and I he's more
[1:51:08] determined than our determination to
[1:51:11] remain
[1:51:12] humble I thank God for
[1:51:15] that yeah man man man man man why don't
[1:51:19] we just go for lunch and come back
[1:51:27] you get in
[1:51:30] trouble but I don't want to get I just
[1:51:33] this just so many things just Bubble Up
[1:51:34] in your heart for things you know to
[1:51:36] help us and to minister to us and that's
[1:51:38] how I that's how I look at it
[1:51:41] friends to me I look at it like brother
[1:51:43] Aaron if you was over at the house and
[1:51:44] you were getting ready to leave us wait
[1:51:46] wait wait wait we didn't even get the
[1:51:47] Apple pile the apple crisp sit down man
[1:51:50] hey you you can leaving out the best
[1:51:52] part
[1:51:55] we better get all food W Happ
[1:51:57] me but I want you to notice this this
[1:52:00] subtleness just how how quickly that
[1:52:02] that came in
[1:52:04] there where
[1:52:06] Nebuchadnezzar was a
[1:52:08] man that he was he was an
[1:52:10] instrument being used by God he was an
[1:52:14] instrument that God used to bring
[1:52:16] judgment right but Nebuchadnezzar the
[1:52:21] reason you we that Babylon was the the a
[1:52:24] Mighty Kingdom as it was was because God
[1:52:29] had permitted it to rise up to chasen
[1:52:34] Israel that's why the prophet of God
[1:52:36] said he said all of this talk about
[1:52:40] communism he said that is not the focus
[1:52:44] no he said it is Roman Catholicism right
[1:52:49] if I had to read all the quotes that he
[1:52:50] said that he called preachers out for
[1:52:52] preaching
[1:52:54] it right he said what that is it's a
[1:52:58] tool that God is
[1:53:01] using right he would go on to tell us he
[1:53:03] said by the way voice of God in this
[1:53:06] last days that message he said by the
[1:53:08] way he said Russia he said really less
[1:53:10] than 1% is communism right but it's that
[1:53:13] percent that is the ruling percent right
[1:53:16] but he's what did he say watch that
[1:53:19] purple curtain which is what Rome right
[1:53:23] Catholicism is that right now remember
[1:53:25] she had many
[1:53:27] daughters now what are her daughters you
[1:53:30] had them where they took out and you
[1:53:31] know Luther they Luther inspiration
[1:53:33] struck Luther's heart nailed those 95
[1:53:37] pieces there to the door under the
[1:53:39] inspiration of God under the man
[1:53:40] anointing and Luther he he he stood out
[1:53:43] on the word that was revealed in that
[1:53:46] hour the just shall live by faith that
[1:53:49] Revelation was power over the devil in
[1:53:52] that hour
[1:53:53] it was power over that black horse rider
[1:53:56] is that right and now it was not Luther
[1:53:59] that started the Lutheran organization
[1:54:02] that was fallen
[1:54:04] angels that got in there after that word
[1:54:07] and they denominated you know what
[1:54:09] denominate is it's where you put a wall
[1:54:12] around
[1:54:13] things but God's word is meant to go
[1:54:18] forward you don't just stop it's like
[1:54:20] out here in this field out here in this
[1:54:22] field they just harvested the beans over
[1:54:24] there those beans when they started out
[1:54:26] were little sprigs like this that came
[1:54:28] out right you don't get a combine out
[1:54:31] there when them sprigs are up like that
[1:54:34] they're not ready but the life that was
[1:54:37] within that be that went in the ground
[1:54:39] that life will come back to itself
[1:54:44] again Luther was only the beginning
[1:54:46] stage amen right then Here Comes Wesley
[1:54:51] anointed by the the spirit of God and it
[1:54:53] begins to proclaim the sanctifying power
[1:54:57] of the blood of Jesus
[1:54:59] Christ there were Lutheran than those
[1:55:01] that take upon that name no you know
[1:55:03] what they weren't called Lutheran before
[1:55:05] they were called
[1:55:07] Christians right is that right now I
[1:55:09] know some man of lame labeled them that
[1:55:11] because they were following Luther's
[1:55:13] message but what they were following is
[1:55:15] they were following Christ that had
[1:55:17] revealed himself through Luther cuz Paul
[1:55:20] said follow me as I follow Christ that's
[1:55:24] why you got to be careful who you're
[1:55:25] following no who they're
[1:55:30] following are you hearing me friends
[1:55:32] somebody leads you right in a ditch can
[1:55:34] lead you right into the tribulation can
[1:55:37] lead you right into hell but you want to
[1:55:39] be sure you're following
[1:55:42] Christ and he is the word Wesley arose
[1:55:45] by that inspiration he took out and then
[1:55:48] preached a sanctification message then
[1:55:50] as that word went on
[1:55:52] then here came a word that that was
[1:55:55] dropped in the hour of the restoration
[1:55:58] of the gifts it wasn't perfect but the
[1:56:00] restoration of the gift is a
[1:56:01] supernatural back among the people of
[1:56:04] God again the rumor became stronger that
[1:56:07] he's alive the rumor had started through
[1:56:10] Luther a rumor he's alive then he gotten
[1:56:13] stronger through Wesley and then here
[1:56:15] came the rumor even stronger through the
[1:56:17] supernatural making itself known there
[1:56:21] at the at the Ze Street with the gifts
[1:56:23] amen but God didn't stop
[1:56:27] there hallu because that's still not
[1:56:29] back to the original seed no no are you
[1:56:32] hearing me now but the Original Seed is
[1:56:35] to reproduce Christ himself again in the
[1:56:40] lives of his people are there gifts
[1:56:42] absolutely it's a part of it you can't
[1:56:45] cut away what he was back there it's him
[1:56:48] becoming brighter and brighter and
[1:56:50] brighter and more clear under that
[1:56:52] perfect day he's still the same
[1:56:54] yesterday today and forever we are
[1:56:56] justified by faith we are Sanctified by
[1:56:59] the blood we are baptized with the Holy
[1:57:01] Ghost and we are positioned as Sons and
[1:57:05] Daughters of God in Jesus
[1:57:12] Christ a
[1:57:14] word to bring us from Glory unto glory
[1:57:19] amen think about think think about I
[1:57:22] want you to think about this think about
[1:57:24] where we're at right
[1:57:25] now I think about where even just a few
[1:57:30] years ago the understanding and the
[1:57:32] things that I see now I didn't see it in
[1:57:35] that depth right a few years ago and I'm
[1:57:38] not just talking about a depth of
[1:57:41] Doctrine and how things are coming
[1:57:42] together I'm talking about me I'm seeing
[1:57:45] me more clearly that's what I'm talking
[1:57:47] about and as I'm seeing me more clearly
[1:57:49] how are you seeing you more clearly
[1:57:50] because I'm looking at him he he's
[1:57:52] becoming in plain view and you know and
[1:57:55] you know the view that he's becoming is
[1:57:57] not an external view but it's Christ
[1:57:59] himself unveiling himself in you in me
[1:58:02] he's un faking he's taking the veil off
[1:58:06] Hallelujah and it's you eyes that are
[1:58:09] beginning to see things that as he deals
[1:58:12] with our hearts in love well sure Lord
[1:58:16] I'll lay that aside prise God sure Lord
[1:58:20] I'll lay that aside remember he's not
[1:58:22] hotty and indifferent when he comes he
[1:58:24] doesn't come as the like like a cruel
[1:58:26] father and no it's his
[1:58:28] love because he wants surrender right
[1:58:32] because it's not just see legalism is
[1:58:34] where it's taking and you do this and
[1:58:35] you do that it's not surrender legalism
[1:58:37] is not surrender you can have all the
[1:58:39] p's and q's out outside right here and
[1:58:41] still not have the surrender that God's
[1:58:43] looking for but the love of God comes to
[1:58:45] bring surrender in our
[1:58:50] hearts that's good
[1:58:52] well I said I was going to stop here and
[1:58:57] then it's your
[1:59:02] fault but here was
[1:59:05] Nebuchadnezzar when the Bible says that
[1:59:07] in his
[1:59:08] heart his heart got lifted up yes it did
[1:59:12] yes it did that's
[1:59:14] right and his mind hardened in Pride now
[1:59:16] you would say you
[1:59:18] know how could that have how could that
[1:59:21] have happened
[1:59:22] true because he he got to looking at all
[1:59:26] the
[1:59:26] achievements he got to looking at
[1:59:29] everything can I bring it down to you
[1:59:31] and I look at all the understanding that
[1:59:33] God's given us look at the message that
[1:59:36] God has given us look how that this word
[1:59:38] has come and overthrow spirits that have
[1:59:42] had lives bound look look how it's done
[1:59:44] in such a boy I tell see the subtleness
[1:59:47] of pride is such a fine line between
[1:59:51] self- Glory glorification and glorifying
[1:59:55] God it's such a fine line within that
[1:59:58] and I say
[2:00:00] Lord help me to always
[2:00:04] remember help me to always remember that
[2:00:07] it's you
[2:00:08] lord it's
[2:00:10] you don't you stand in amazement of how
[2:00:12] that he works through your
[2:00:15] life that's so
[2:00:17] good I stand In Awe I I I'm just I'm
[2:00:20] just saying this you've heard me say it
[2:00:21] many times but many times what I stand
[2:00:23] in awe of and I Rejoice is not that the
[2:00:26] outcome or the situation or anything has
[2:00:28] been you know resolved or I've got I see
[2:00:30] the final answer but it's just where he
[2:00:32] would drop in my heart to know Samuel
[2:00:34] I've got this there you go there you go
[2:00:37] and that right there get it it gives
[2:00:39] such such peace and such joy in my heart
[2:00:41] to know he's got that that itself brings
[2:00:44] a worship and you say how's this going
[2:00:46] to happen like Abraham I don't know
[2:00:48] what's going to happen on the mountain
[2:00:51] when we get up there Glory but I know
[2:00:53] this we're going to go
[2:00:56] worship God's asked something very great
[2:00:59] of you Abraham but I'm going to go
[2:01:02] worship Him Glory and you know what was
[2:01:05] the most greatest worship that Abraham
[2:01:08] did was not altogether of the altar
[2:01:11] being being built and the and the wood
[2:01:13] being laid in order that
[2:01:15] itself was only showing what was already
[2:01:20] in his heart yes all right and God
[2:01:23] allowed his heart to be displayed praise
[2:01:29] God you have been in God's heart all
[2:01:33] along but he didn't keep you in his
[2:01:36] heart cuz he believes his own word faith
[2:01:39] without works is dead but God has
[2:01:42] revealed himself as part and portions of
[2:01:46] himself and let me tell you something
[2:01:48] it's his heart that is coming and is
[2:01:50] going to lift Us in rap
[2:01:52] [Applause]
[2:01:53] hallah hallelujah it's God coming back
[2:01:56] for
[2:01:59] himself so God is accountable to his own
[2:02:03] word Faith Works expresses
[2:02:08] faith God working out in your life my
[2:02:11] life through all your failures through
[2:02:14] all my failures and God himself working
[2:02:17] throughout our life is the expression of
[2:02:19] his faith that he has in his own
[2:02:22] word the prophet said it's not you
[2:02:25] believing it's God in you believing his
[2:02:29] own word through
[2:02:31] you thank you
[2:02:35] Lord I feel like boy the dirt's flying
[2:02:37] now now
[2:02:39] man start flying when you start looking
[2:02:41] at that man make room more I want more
[2:02:44] of the grace of God I want more than man
[2:02:48] life feel like singing that song I don't
[2:02:51] think I could sing it I want to dig a
[2:02:52] little deeper in God's love I want to
[2:02:54] dig a Little Deeper it's an old one but
[2:02:56] it's a good one
[2:03:01] BR but Nebuchadnezzar he got he got
[2:03:06] hottie he got
[2:03:08] hottie and
[2:03:10] God turned him out like an ox to eat
[2:03:15] grass yeah his fingernails grew out and
[2:03:17] long
[2:03:19] he like an eagle yeah
[2:03:23] you could look at that and say what are
[2:03:24] you doing you're not supposed to be
[2:03:26] feeding on that kind of stuff what are
[2:03:29] you
[2:03:29] doing why why are you letting yourself
[2:03:32] go like
[2:03:34] that but God permitted it because he
[2:03:38] hardened that's right his heart was
[2:03:41] lifted in Pride the Bible said his heart
[2:03:44] was lifted up and his mind was hardened
[2:03:48] in Pride that's that's that's beautiful
[2:03:52] friends there's a time to be
[2:03:55] stubborn some of you are thinking now
[2:03:57] you're talking my game
[2:03:59] now but there's a time not to be
[2:04:01] stubborn when P when Peter says be
[2:04:04] steadfast in the faith that means be
[2:04:07] stubborn in the faith so there is such a
[2:04:10] thing as a good
[2:04:12] stubbornness but there's also such a
[2:04:14] thing as a bad
[2:04:15] stubbornness we want that stubbornness
[2:04:18] that'll stand in the faith of God's word
[2:04:21] and say I don't know how but I know what
[2:04:25] God has said he will perform it amen he
[2:04:30] don't need me to help him he just needs
[2:04:32] me to yield to
[2:04:35] him just say it like this don't don't
[2:04:39] let any Pride linger around our
[2:04:41] lives Pride leads to destruction leads
[2:04:44] to many things but oh the grace of God
[2:04:46] has called us to live and to walk higher
[2:04:50] say God tune every dial of my life if
[2:04:54] it's not you know we we always want to
[2:04:56] be right right in tune that's why we
[2:04:57] come and we're hearing the word of God
[2:05:00] because the word comes to bring checkups
[2:05:03] it comes to make sure that everything's
[2:05:05] lined up right I I think you know in my
[2:05:09] you know you have it on your electronic
[2:05:11] devices and things like that I guess but
[2:05:13] I get all these things that notify that
[2:05:15] hey you need to update this right here

[2:05:32] stay updated those things can affect
[2:05:35] me one of these things and then I wonder
[2:05:39] why is this going haywire why isin't

[2:05:42] this but you know what not only do them

[2:10:24] discern the enemy that would want to
[2:10:28] come and make the army of the Living God
[2:10:32] formal powerless
[2:10:35] lukewarm may we not only discern it Lord
[2:10:38] but withstand it now

[2:10:45] God Amen we are called to take the word
[2:10:49] amen and to apply it to our own Liv
[2:10:51] lives and to stand shoulder toosh

[2:11:01] hearts

[2:11:44] Lord I I want you to be on display Lord
[2:11:48] wherever I go wherever we go we we do
[2:11:51] not want it to be known that Samuel
[2:11:53] Browning passed this way or Lord they
[2:11:55] can put their name in that but we we
[2:11:56] want it to be known that first and
[2:11:58] foremost this was a Christian that
[2:12:00] passed this
[2:12:01] way here's one who loved
[2:12:05] God above
[2:12:08] everything even willing to come to me
[2:12:11] when maybe he said something or she said
[2:12:14] something out of line and I didn't hear
[2:12:16] them say it but in their heart it wasn't
[2:12:18] said in the right spirit and they would
[2:12:20] turn and say forgive me I I didn't say
[2:12:22] that in the right way there is a
[2:12:25] Christian Lord
[2:12:28] God this is an age of such
[2:12:31] imagery an age where pictures and
[2:12:34] everything else would be set before
[2:12:37] us Lord God I can't think of anything
[2:12:40] greater when you would send Lord God
[2:12:42] this great message in this hour how we
[2:12:45] thank you Lord for every book for every
[2:12:47] tape Lord but dear God you're not coming
[2:12:50] back to to Rapture books and
[2:12:53] tapes it's where Lord God that that word
[2:12:56] has become flesh in our lives where the
[2:12:59] very character of Jesus Christ has been
[2:13:02] reproduced in our
[2:13:04] lives that is what your Prophet called
[2:13:07] the welcoming spirit that would welcome
[2:13:10] you back to this earth Lord God to take
[2:13:14] us home not our spirit but your spirit
[2:13:18] Lord help me help us Lord God as our
[2:13:21] hands Lord have been lifted up Lord you
[2:13:23] know the needs behind every hand Lord
[2:13:26] hearts and lives Lord that father might
[2:13:28] be in need Lord of full surrender might
[2:13:31] be in need of the Holy Ghost but lord
[2:13:33] they're not ashamed Lord God in your
[2:13:35] presence Lord just say father I need you
[2:13:39] I'm not going to let Pride hold me back

[2:13:54] behind hands Lord the desire Lord I want
[2:13:58] to dig deeper Lord I want to dig deeper

[2:14:05] laid aside Lord as they would put their
[2:14:07] own name in it to dig out more of
[2:14:10] ourselves Lord laying it aside Lord that
[2:14:13] the spirit of God might flow Lord such
[2:14:17] in a greater way through our
[2:14:19] lives help us Lord
[2:14:21] [Music]
[2:14:24] sometimes Lord the very trials and tests

[2:14:34] Lord that we complain when it first hits

[2:14:41] Lord God I'm
[2:14:43] thankful that father Your Grace is
[2:14:46] present to override in our lives but
[2:14:49] sometimes lord it's through those very
[2:14:52] things that you
[2:14:54] work to help us to
[2:14:58] remember it's not your strength
[2:15:01] Samuel it's my strength
