========================================

of the holy spirit this is not an old an old life patched over right now it's it's god creating it's god creating in you god creating in me now look how how paul would go on to write this in romans 12 verse 1 and he says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god how many thankful for god's mercy i don't want god's law i want his mercy that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service what god requires of us as aaron and as the priests they were to take of the uh the sacrifice and to bring them into a place to present them on behalf of the worshiper god is speaking to you and i and letting you and i know the only thing that you and i can do what is our reasonable service is that we would present our bodies don't don't hold anything back but present of our lives and you know what that never stops that never stops and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye might prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god you find paul goes on to say in in ephesians 4 23 and be renewed in the spirit of your mind paul would there are many places in the scripture that would speak of this renewal uh a renewal is is not like changing the carpet in here changing the color of the walls changing all that that's a renovation but it's still the same old building and there's times where we have to do that that that also is part of renewal but this renewal that we're talking about is not just where the outside is changed to where things start appearing right on the outside but it moves to such a place to the renewal brings about a full change a full birth a full transformation and it continues to work in our life to perform and bring forth the word because then the then where the ground that we stand on for every promise of god whether it's healing whatever the need might be in our life then our ground that we stand on is is that revelation of jesus christ in our heart that new birth the love of god then that's where we stand and for every prayer this is our token we offer with our prayer this is the ground that we stand on as sons and daughters of god amen i mean when you go to ask your dad i don't care how old you are or your mom or you know other things like that and you go to ask them for money hey can i have a little bit of money hey can i do this or how are you how are you approaching them you approach them as a son or daughter right how what's your approach your approach is based on who you know you are and who they are and that's what the baptism of the holy ghost even the working of the holy spirit to draw you to a place to recognize this is for me the holy ghost is for me for other other promises in the word this belongs to me you're not approaching as a beggar or as a slave you're not approaching as someone oh i don't know i may not deserve this no the holy spirit comes to make it so real that it's not what you deserve it's what belongs to you it comes to inspire faith in his word so this is why within the scripture we will find you're familiar probably you've heard it or as a bible reader you may have read it but it speaks of even how in isaiah how even the condition of a really strong young person uh could be and so resolute and so forth in their mind and so strong but yet the youth will faint it's not able it's not by natural strength that we're able to live this life oh if i was just younger if i if i it's not it's not about our natural strength this is why the scripture said that our youth is to be renewed as an eagle and that renewal as as isaiah would write that in isaiah 40 he's speaking about the transformation but there's a key phrase in there they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength and shall mount up with the wings as an eagle an eagle remember as an ego you do not become an ego but you are already there is that identity within you that's what's causing you to identify with the word it's what is dealing with your life it's not you guiding you but god the winds the current of the holy spirit by the word is letting you know there are higher heights for you to climb to there is grace given for you what do i have to do as an eagle you spread your wings you give just a little jump you got to put a little bit of effort you give a jump but you're jumping into the current the wind that is moving and you allow that wind to pack you away that wind i'm talking about is the wind of the holy ghost they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength you know brother branham once again and i know i've used this example here in a few services but i want to just be very specific i've referred to it but just feeling pressed of the lord when we look at this i think of how brother branham places it in the message power of transformation and he deals with this earth and the condition it was in darkness and brother brown would say it like this he would say it was a treme terrific mass of something lost like it couldn't find its way and how that god took the great chaos of darkness and transformed it into a garden of eden by his word god did it by his word and that's how we're transformed is by his word let there be light and is it the earth itself now when she doesn't catch this very simple but the earth it obeyed the voice of god that's all god requires for you and i is to believe and when i say all that that requires there because belief unleashes the power of god to obey it invites god to perform his word he asked those when many that came before him with sickness he said do you believe that i'm able to do this and remember even the man who had the son who cast himself into the fire you know and when he came jesus you know asked him and the man said i believe help down my unbelief i believe tonight i would even be that honest and sincere if you can say that and say god i believe help my unbelief because this is what god requires god does not perform it's not god coming and bringing his word to pass any other way it's not some great amount of hoops you got to jump through it's not this listen this is for everyday life are you with me this is everyday life this is this is how we take promises once we're in the promised land we take them by faith in the word amen it's by faith in the word we believe is that right so it became brother brown would say it like this and speaks of how it became a garden of eden because it obeyed the word of god it done the perfect will of god amen see the word was made known the word was spoken what did the word do what did the earth do the earth yielded to the spirit that was brooding over it that's all it had to do he had to just say yes lord hallelujah yes lord amen brother bram said the holy spirit broods over you it says my daughter i'm calling you to eternal life you say what do you say yes holy spirit praise the lord you're responding back it's a personal connection he's pruning over you you are a part of the earth and he's brooding over that part of the earth and what is he doing he's drawing you and i into redemption by himself so it notice jesus would pick this up uh and and he would speak even when he would talking to the disciples and i just referred to this when he spoke to the 12 apostles and he speaks of how that those who would follow him in the regeneration when the son of man shall set on the throne of glory you shall also sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel and it begins to go on that there's not one who has left or forsaken houses lands family and so forth but it will receive in this lifetime and in the life to come he is speaking in the terms followed in the regeneration remember before god became man there was no way possible that man could come into that relationship of a union where the holy spirit would come and dwell by a seal within that life is that right the spirit of god would come upon david and it would move it would come upon the prophets he would move you see there there had to come a time when there would be one who would stand in the gap between a sinful man and a holy god and there was no man could do that but god himself created the tabernacle the body of his dwelling that he alone would condemn and take upon flesh that he might be able to join us back into our inheritance and so when god became flesh he paid the price for you it's like if you've got a hospital bill and you're walking around and you're saying oh i got this bill oh i can't do this oh i got this bill hey don't you want to buy a new living room suit no i got a bill hey don't you wanna no i got a bill hey don't you want no i got a bill but you recognize when somebody comes and lets you know that the debt that was against you has already been paid when that begins to ring in your heart you now are made freedom freedom is coming to your life you are no longer held in debt to that sin and that's exactly what god did on calvary he paid the debt he paid your sin debt he paid pass present and future he went completely went to the lowest parts of hell deposited sin on the very one who was the instigator of it and he arose on that easter morning and then from there he went and seated on her you know what it means to sit down it means it is finished he has performed the work he comes to you and he lets you know i've already done all that is required he shows you he takes you back away and let you know it's for you personally what's this this is the work of our boys it's the work of our kinsmen it's the work of our lovely lord jesus that's what the gospel is to be about it's not it's not a man talking about an event i hope you understand it's not a man a preacher it's not a man talking about an event but it's god coming and taking the vessel of that man and speaking personally to your heart that's the real gospel so it's gone as he broods over that life as we said god he god re is the renewing of the holy spirit through through repentance through water baptism through sanctification a new heart a new spirit it's the holy spirit at work he's bringing us to a place to cooperate with the vision he already saw see before we were not in any cooperation you could hear the word well not today oh yes yeah oh no that's too hard all right it was there was nothing going it was no interest yet there was something that you could witness and say but i know i know it's truth i know there's something truth but you weren't willing to commit yourself how long suffering he is if it had been up to you and me we'd have done drawn it off the 1st 2nd 5th 50th he's only obligated one time is that right but you see god is working it's god breaking down that first nature the darkness that's there and as you yield to that in obedience and just simply as the words coming forth you say yes lord be it unto me and allow the word to move as brother branham would say it like this entire transformation when he's praying at the beginning of that service he said oh god let the word of god come now and move through us lord while the word is going forward thank you lord i tell you if we can come with that kind of expectation locked in like that i could take much time here but i believe as believers that that ought to be something and i'm talking to those on the internet and to those all across that come here we are not coming together as just a protractive meeting we're coming here because we mean business i want to be changed i want to be transformed amen i i want to grow amen i want to give myself to him i don't want to just it's not just come and say okay yeah you know it's a time or it's a duty or no no it's greater than that listen let me tell you something it's recognizing this is the words of life it's a bread of life that's going forth we value that as children of god and notice paul goes into this here in second thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 and 14 he says but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth notice god hath chosen you but his choosing did not allow you to skip or to move from one place just to another but remember it has to be a process he has chosen you chosen to what to be born again his choosing his life is allotted it's given that we might be quickened he has chosen us he has drawn us to that place to to salvation to sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he has the one working on us you can say well you know i repented but before you could repent it took a a part of the renewing of the holy spirit to even move your heart and your life to that place and then even our minds being even set in order for holiness it takes a work out the holy spirit it takes a continual work of his working in our life amen oh i'm trying not to get ahead on messages i'm gonna just say it like this look what paul said notice it through sanctification of the spirit the spirit brings the sanctifying work and belief of the truth whereunto he called you look at this statement where unto called you by our gospel paul's letting them know god has used the gospel which is his revelation that he has given to us now that revelation is sounding out remember god didn't give that that wasn't for paul alone that revelation was to be sounded out like a trumpet and what was it to do that truth that trumpet that revelation as it's blown is to sound and take a hold of the hearts and lives that have been chosen too salvation and what is it it's god calling you to himself you see this is where we come under that inspiration of the holy spirit inspiration inspiration we know that god that as a as as as the word of god as it clearly says all word every word is inspired but god takes his word and as the inspiration of the holy spirit is coming out in that word it is god who is inspiring us unto all holiness let me just say it like this it is the brooding of the holy spirit of what in the beginning remember there is an objective that is in mind and the brooding of the holy spirit you see what takes place on the first day well look yeah in order here god is preparing through the brooding of the holy spirit remember the word is at work it is coming to bring forth and there is a brooding going over the earth brother adam would many times he would dramatize it in this way it's the holy spirit he said like the dove that is cooing and you you know sometimes you hear doves every morning they're cooing and you know you hear that cool what is it it's making love to the earth the holy spirit is drawing the earth in obedience not out of a law but out of a love affair it's yielding his presence his atmosphere his person it's creating a yielding hallelujah david was as guilty as a fox and a hen house he sat there in what he had did with bathsheba it took the wisdom of god brooding in that moment when david was sitting there and you know god had nathanael to speak the way he did and talk about you know uh you know i don't want to go into the whole story for sake of time but at any rate here it took the brooding of the holy spirit in wisdom in order to break that hardness in order to break that condition because that condition listen to me now david had not lost his covenant but he had fallen out of fellowship but god's desire i want you to catch this this was not david this was god seeking after david it was not adam in the beginning crying out god god where are you it was god come down adam adam where are thou and it's the same way in our life if there's something that's out alive it's not us it's god the holy spirit that is calling dan look at david's setting in the condition he was in but the holy spirit brooding upon his life he brought him to a place of openness unbelief will try to close you off you know try to close them a person off in condemnation other things like that but if you allow the holy spirit brother he knows how to open you up don't worry if he ain't got you yet he'll get you if you're out of sync with god he'll get you because remember he said i will in no wise cast out amen so if you say oh man i'm brother samuel you know god just told me i ain't welcome right now you need to stomp your foot and say you lying devil because jesus said that they will come to me and i will in no wise cast out but and god does not cast you out it is unbelief that rises to where you allow it to rise and then there's a distance between you and god to where faith becomes obscure but god comes to do what energize our faith but sometimes before our faith can never be energized there's repentance that has to be made amen amen his brooding never stopped he did not stop with when the heavens and earth were separated it did not stop when botany life began to come up it did not stop when wells it did not shout when other animal life came up it didn't stop but there on that sixth day here when one came up in the image of the one who was doing the brooding who achieved that god god's achievement god achieved that you and i could look and say what's going on oh my first day huh lord you're still moving yeah second day you're still moving yeah thursday night lord you're still moving sunday comes around look you're still moving yeah monday comes around look you're still moving one that is in his image mother and father brought forth this under a law of god and it bears their image but only god can bring forth a son and daughter of god that bears his image and he broods over their life he cools to their life making love to their life hallelujah jesus second corinthians 3 verse 1 do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we and some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you know paul's referring to before they would ever receive an evangelist a teacher or whomever into this particular church it was not a man showing up and saying i believe the message and i'm a preacher no no no no i think we probably need to get back to this this is this is this is apostolic the man had to have letters of commendation remember paul would write letters regarding men and say these men these men are on why it's a church it's a safeguard the body there ought to be a life that's commendable are you with me not just somebody who's a good man but a person who is stable amen we can preach on that but you understand there have to be letters of commendation but paul is saying what letters of commendation do we need to you not speaking this ignorantly he's having them to look at what god has done in their life look at this in verse two ye are our epistle written in our hearts then can i just let me just teach a little bit paul was not making paul lights you with me paul was not making uh images of paul no paul the image that was being given notice ye are our epistle you are our epistle that which god has revealed and placed in our heart where god puts the word and known and read of all men for as much look at verse three ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ now wait a minute paul just said our epistle now in verse 3 says the epistle of christ ministered by us what he's saying is we are one with this revelation what god has revealed that indeed that jesus christ is the same it's god come down from glory now that same god who went to calvary who was buried he rose again and now he is seated and has sent back the holy ghost what does the holy ghost come to do the holy ghost comes to point to a finished work the holy ghost coming in a meeting it reveals christ is seated in power hallelujah and this and this is where they were in acts 19 let me finish reading the scripture you are ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart see this is where god said i'll put my spirit into you how does god how does god put his spirit into you and me by his word by his word think of it remember back what was saying moments ago you may have started your journey and someone could have said all you have to do is believe on the son of god believe that he has died for your sins he paid it all he covered it he died and he rose again for your justification your sins are forgiven you raise up and say i accept that i accept that that's god dealing with your life you had to have a start somewhere it's just like in this church you might have come in for a long time but all of a sudden the holy spirit starts dealing with your life there's got to be a start somewhere is that right and to see a person you can only you can only uh walk in what light is revealed to you you can't walk in any more light than what's revealed to you this is why what's important is not and this is for everybody it's not important do not be anxious stay yielded this is in every one of our life because the gospel brings us to real rest it brings us to trust in him you see even as god deals with the life and we repent of our sins what's it doing that is also building faith in our life to trust him in sanctification it sets our mind in order he's giving us strength to do what even when we it may be not feeling it but we look at that and say this is not pleasing to god god has made this known to me by his word so in the name of jesus christ i lay it down for your glory lord god not us trying to do it but god take it out of my life see it's us making ourselves available allowing god to work but you can only walk in what light is presented to you because the light that's presented is the requirements or the expectation or the path that's laid before you but when more light is come then the path becomes open you know the bible says that the path shines brighter and brighter unto that perfect day god moving in your life is like the morning breaking are you with me who is this that cometh as fair as the morning it's like the morning breaking in your life and as you walk on with god what happens more light right i know i'm talking to the brothers even you know i like watching the sun rise and you know sometimes mamas that don't like watching sunrise but they're up with the child with the babies and and they have to watch the sunrise anyhow but you but you know how you know one of the first times i ever drove all night a few times and my it's all it's it's a you know i'm talking about it's a different thing man when that light's coming up it does get real dark before the day breaks you know what darkness looks like it seems like it's a greater impossibility but don't give up that's when god shows up light continues to break forth you cannot compare the morning to the noonday sun what is different same sun different position it's good bringing us in position of the sun you know what i'm talking about you know you know you get up in the morning right now and i look and say 45 degrees man i'm gonna need a a big old sweatshirt this morning maybe a jacket and a sock hat over time i might even need some gloves on there on my my little fingertips when i go outside yeah just maria i know you need them 70 degrees you're wearing them but you understand look what it is right now you know what i'm talking about the bill it's so cold of a morning but by the time it gets to noonday you get out there in the sun you're like oh man this is this is too much i got to take this off and it it's why it's this it's the same sun that you saw in the morning it's rose in a greater intensity and it starts bringing or causing you to change why are you changing you're responding to the position of the sun that you are under and that's what the son of god the son the holy ghost the word as it's moving in your life there is a transformation that's taking place in your life you can look at your life and say it's not the same as it was in the morning he's become greater he's become sweeter there's things he deals with me on now i can just say i just can't take this no more let that go maybe i responded like that you know many years in the past but under the light of the sun it's baking out greenness in my life but we caught them leap there remember saying in acts 19 here were some real believers in the upper coast of ephesus they had a man a preacher ah his name slips my mind right now who was that that man was up there preaching in acts 19. apollos i needed your helper but apollos the bible said he was preaching that jesus was the christ but you see when paul got there to them paul began to notice and he asked him he says have you received the holy ghost since ye believed see they believed they had already believed but now what's he doing he's taking where they're not aware they weren't aware that the sacrifice jesus who is the christ had already been offered up and not only offered up but had rose again seated in power and has sent back the holy ghost they didn't know that so how could they ask for something they didn't know was available light came to let them know this is what's available you say you could have been sitting in a church and a church could have you could have taught well if you just believe you're born again but there's something in you even though you can say praise god i'm i'm born again but yet you know something's not right yes it's a calling there's a calling amen that calling is not just something in earth that call is from the other side but there's got to be a voice on earth that that call and that call is not just your name that call is the call of the world upon your life like geese that are flying around you start seeing the geese right now they're starting to swarm the birds starting to swarm i'm gonna see them on the grass and stuff i mean you know look here you say my goodness i ain't seen this many birds all summer and it's like they're covering the grass what are they doing they're swarming they're preparing for migration you say that's instinct i say it's god but that call was to them in acts 19 and paul remember paul said he asked them here's a diagnosis he said how were you baptized they said we were baptized unto repentance john's baptism the repentance of their sins because see the sacrifice hadn't been offered yet for them to unknow that it hadn't had already been offered they didn't know that more light what's coming they were a part of that light you understand they were a part of their life brother joshua we were a part of that light it was not me and you that found the light the light found us it was not you and me oh i was searching for god i was seeking for god the reason there was a hunger is because god put that hunger inside of you you couldn't be satisfied this could be satisfied they're fine they go to church hey okay but there's something different there's a hunger within your life i want to see him i want to see him i want to go up to his door i want to knock on his door i want to talk to him who put that inside of you he did sunday school didn't do it setting on mama's lap didn't do it thank god for all those things but he put it in there inspiration came to them there in acts 19 and they were baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of their sins and paul laid his hands upon them and they received the holy ghost how could they receive the holy ghost without the word being are you with me you see the holy ghost it doesn't travel outside of the word it comes through the word this is what brings a true birth this is why coming back to our thought washing of regeneration renewing of the holy ghost this is why jesus said you must be born of the water born of the word right the washing of water by the word a word that comes to purify a word that comes to cleanse a word that comes to challenge our life because it's not just challenging what's god doing he's breaking the darkness from around our life that a real son or daughter can come forth like a palm lily that's down beneath the mock and the scum and the gum of all of that water but beneath that water there is upon lily though you can't see it it's there but the light the sun it draws that pan lily you can look day one i don't see no pond lily day two on and on what's happening it's drawing it from the bottom and eventually that pond lily it gets to the top of that water and it shoots forth the glory that was within it the light has brought it to glory [Applause] what did the light shining released the glory that was inside of that pond hallelujah must be born of the water and of the spirit amen thank you so why the real evidence of the holy ghost is being in the word for our day genuine faith in the word being all the way in that word where our life is lining with that word where we're seeing him so something has been explained to us we see him right people can look for nail scars hands you don't see that but we see him as he reveals himself he makes himself known who is doing that it's him it is given to us this is why paul would say in the scripture paul would say the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life amen see it's not christian government and i would speak from the new i speak to others i speak to those that even has sat here for a long i speak to all of us it's not the idea of christianity is not to convert people by the government of christianity hey muslim nations if you don't believe like they believe right and every on and on and on you talk to somebody about being a christian yeah what are they doing suppressing people by fear controlling people by governments well let me just say this to you outside of the spirit word the spirit revealed truth it becomes nothing more than christian government a person can do everything out here now i want you to understand me they can do have everything seemingly in order out here the pharisees did you couldn't lay a finger on their life out here but the finger of god came down and touched this down here the finger of god came down to the inside and said graveyards and it was a sin for them to touch the dead are you with me they could not be near a dead person if you're are you with me if you're near a dead person you cannot come into the camp and jesus was letting them know you're full of dead men's bones their pride their indifference yet so religious who are you to tell me ah that was all together born in sin who are you too right that's a bad devil who is a bad devil but christian government's not the idea does that mean that we don't coming with the word and giving direction and and no we give direction by the word right we direct our households is that right we direct our children we don't make them christians that's god's job but while they're in our house they're going to live like christians will you preach what means you want amen that's a whole separate part but christian government is not the idea intellects will never do it as i said we believe in the mind being set in order for holiness we believe in that don't we but remember it's a love affair sanctification your mind being set in order for holiness is where you begin to think on certain things you begin to dwell on on certain things as far as saying ah this in it speaking to bother you never bothered you before things begin to stand out to you but it stands out to you to measure that you recognize what is not pleasing to god hey let me bring it on up to all of us here paul said let every man know how to possess his vessel unto sanctification and honor is that right all of us like that song that we sing here lord keep me sanctified is that right this is why this is why times you come from your job and you wonder why am i feeling the way i am you need a bath and i'm not talking about because you physically stink you might but you need a good washing in the holy ghost lord wash my attitude set my attitude right lord what is it it's sanctifying that's what washing of the word does it cleanses us sanctifying by the word it doesn't condem illusions it lifts up let me read this quote here there's many but the bible said here in israel in the church part two now there's many that pretend to be in there there's many that's warring themselves and trying to live right and trying to press in i don't know about them but if they're in there it's just as easy to live a christian life as it is to live any life what makes a difference where you're at where you're at because it says it's just as easy to live a christian life as it is to live any life because you're in christ and nothing else but just so full of the holy spirit lead you and guide you and direct you why sure you'll make mistakes and fall but you can't stay down how can you keep his life down once you've been born of the holy ghost how can you keep that life down that raised that body up and has raised you up what part of you will fall not that part this but this on the inside what would it do how does it raise it back up it doesn't raise it back up and say oh that wasn't me i don't know why i did that i don't know no no the love of the love of god on the inside says father forgive me forgive me lord i didn't mean to do that lord jesus that's what it does the love of god doesn't make excuses why sure you'll make mistakes and fall but you can't stay down look at this it's simple simple because no more than could you make a stalk of corn or a sycamore tree you can't do it jesus said by their fruits you shall know them you have everlasting life amen how many say praise be to god praise the lord praise be to god amen hallelujah you see i'm just just your stuff this is the leading of the lord that moves us and brings us from a place through his working and where it brings us to a place to where he's the one completely seated in our life see to the natural mind this in itself it's a mystery the person think how in the world can somebody have that much joy it just depends on where you're at now look when god first deals with your life you repent you might have all sorts of baggage when it needs to be cleaned out but you know what there's a joy that i know my sins are forgiven what do i do keep walking i said keep walking you see there's a joy so what do i do you you take god at his word your mind is set in order for holiness you know that there are things that god i need this out of my life but don't become focused on the things keep your eyes on jesus and what do i do believe him by faith lay it down i lay it

never get anywhere with god even those are on the internet or anybody here you never get anywhere with god without you taking him at his word i don't feel it it's not about your feelings remember when he called you he's not looking at you he's looking at the sacrifice and the sacrifice every single sin everything was met in jesus christ and when he rose on that easter morning he triumphed over every principality there was not a devil could hold him down and he walked around upon this earth god showed the disciples let me show you god took that and said let me show you my power here was a dead lifeless body brother braham said cold laying there pale in the grave but here on that easter morning according to the word came that resurrection power and brother it didn't matter how cold or how pale that that body was it didn't matter what had it sealed in there is nothing could keep the spirit of god from raising up jesus christ there's not enough faults there's not enough failures
