[11:11] by sin.

[11:17] despair.
[11:19] He started over
[11:23] again.

[11:33] the clay away.

[12:04] of honor.
[12:07] I am today.
[12:12] And it's all because Jesus
[12:18] didn't throw
[12:20] the clay away.
[12:24] Oh, and he
[12:27] the potter.
[12:30] [Music]
[12:31] I am the clay.
[12:36] Yes. molded
[12:38] in his image.
[12:41] It's how he wants me
[12:44] to stay.
[12:46] Oh, but when I stumble
[12:50] and I fall
[12:53] and my vessel
[12:56] breaks,
[12:58] oh, he just picks up all the pieces.
[13:04] He doesn't throw
[13:07] the clay away.
[13:11] Thank God over
[13:14] and over
[13:17] he molds me
[13:20] and makes me hallelujah. Oh, into
[13:26] his likeness.
[13:28] Always he fashions
[13:31] all the clay. Hallelujah. And a vessel
[13:37] of honor. Hallelujah, Lord Jesus. Yes,
[13:40] Lord. Whoa. Hallelujah. I am today.
[13:45] And it's all
[13:48] because
[13:50] Jesus
[13:52] didn't throw
[13:54] the clay away. Sing it again. Over and
[13:57] over. Yes. over
[14:01] and over.
[14:04] He molds me
[14:07] and makes me.
[14:10] Oh yes, Lord. I want to be in his
[14:12] likeness. Your likeness, Lord. He
[14:16] fashions.
[14:18] Oh my clay and a vessel
[14:25] of honor.
[14:27] Oh, I am
[14:31] today
[14:33] and it's all because Jesus
[14:39] didn't throw
[14:41] the clay. I want you to testify tonight.
[14:44] Let the devil hear you. A vessel, a
[14:46] vessel,
[14:47] oh of honor.
[14:51] Lord, I am
[14:54] today.
[14:57] And it's all
[14:59] because my Jesus,
[15:03] he never throws
[15:06] the clay
[15:08] away.
[15:13] Hallelujah.
[15:16] Oh,
[15:18] when I think of
[15:23] When I think of all my faults and my
[15:27] failures,
[15:29] [Music]
[15:31] when I consider all the times I've let
[15:35] God down,
[15:40] I am humbled by the grace he has
[15:44] extended.
[15:45] [Music]
[15:48] I'm amazed at the mercy I have found.
[15:55] Oh, I could never
[16:01] love on my own.
[16:04] Oh, yet every time I come before his
[16:09] throne,
[16:12] I stand redeemed.
[16:16] By the blood of the lamb,
[16:20] I stand redeemed
[16:23] before the great I am.
[16:28] And when he looks at me,
[16:31] he sees
[16:34] the hands that bought my liberty.
[16:39] I stay
[16:42] redeemed.
[16:44] Oh yes, Lord. Even at my best, I am
[16:50] unworthy.
[16:52] [Music]
[16:55] I have nothing precious I can give.
[17:02] Oh, a broken life is all I have to
[17:07] offer.
[17:11] And yet it is a priceless gift to him.
[17:16] [Music]
[17:19] Oh, the bitter mark of sin
[17:23] will never fade away.
[17:26] But still I can come before him
[17:31] unashamed.
[17:33] For I stand redeemed. Hallelujah.
[17:38] I the blood of the lamb.
[17:42] Yes, I stand redeemed
[17:46] before
[17:48] great I am.
[17:50] When he looks at me, he sees male
[17:56] scarred hand. Praise the Lord that
[17:58] bought my liberty. Hallelujah. Oh,
[18:02] hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. Say
[18:05] one more time. I stand. Oh, I stand
[18:08] redeemed
[18:11] by the blood of the lamb.
[18:15] Yes, I said redeemed.
[18:19] Oh, the great I am. See when he looks
[18:25] hallelujah at me sees nails scarred
[18:29] hand. All that bought my liberty.
[18:35] I stay
[18:37] and redeem.
[18:40] When he looks at me,
[18:43] he sees the nails scarred hands
[18:48] that bought my liberty.
[18:53] I stay
[18:55] redeemed.
[18:58] [Music]
[18:59] Christ alone
[19:02] will I glory
[19:05] though I could pride myself in battles
[19:10] won
[19:12] [Music]
[19:13] for I've been blessed beyond measure
[19:19] and by his strength alone I overcome.
[19:25] [Music]
[19:27] Oh, I could stop and count successes
[19:33] like diamonds in my head. Oh,
[19:36] hallelujah. That's right. Oh, but those
[19:40] trophies could not equal
[19:44] to the grace. Hallelujah.
[19:47] by which I stand
[19:51] is in Christ the Lord.
[19:56] I place my trust.
[20:00] Find my glory
[20:03] in the power of the cross. Yes. Lord in
[20:09] every victory.

[20:15] of me that my source of strength
[20:22] and my source of hope
[20:25] is Christ alone.

[20:34] In Christ alone
[20:37] will I glory. Oh, right here. Oh, for
[20:40] only by his grace I am redeemed.
[20:47] And only his tender mercies
[20:52] could reach beyond my weakness
[20:56] to my
[20:59] Oh, help me Jesus. And now
[21:03] I seek no greater honor
[21:07] than just to know
[21:10] him more.
[21:13] And I'll count my gains but losses. If
[21:17] it'll bring glory if it'll bring glory
[21:21] to my Lord.
[21:25] In Christ the Lord.

[30:58] control.
[31:01] And the more that I
[31:05] can humble
[31:07] myself,
[31:10] the more he lifts me up.

[31:35] me, Jesus. Lord, I stand in awe. Your
[31:41] amazing

[32:09] my mouth. Let's all stand together.

[33:14] your amazing ways.
[33:16] Yes, Lord, I'll worship you as long as I
[33:23] am breathing.
[33:25] Yes, God, you are faithful and true.
[33:30] Nobody loves me like you. Oh
[33:36] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[33:41] loves me like you.
[33:46] [Music]

[34:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:12] Amen. You say that's true.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Nobody loves me like you, Lord.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to be in the house of the
[34:21] Lord, isn't it?
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Caroline, welcome back. That must
[34:25] mean school. School starting.
[34:28] Amen. Amen.
[34:31] So, we're just so thankful to be in his
[34:34] presence. And Amen. Brian, Sister Bar,
[34:38] welcome back. Different ones. Forgot to
[34:39] welcome brother Aaron back there.
[34:41] Everybody, we've had waves of sickness.
[34:44] And um but God is faithful.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; He's been so good to us. And uh
[34:51] so we are just so thankful for the mercy
[34:54] of the Lord. I I'd like to get right
[34:55] into the word here tonight. And so thank
[34:57] you musicians. Thank you, brother Brian.
[35:01] Amen. Just a little something here on
[35:03] our hearts that we just like to share
[35:06] with you and just trust it'll just be a
[35:09] an encouragement to your hearts. And uh
[35:13] Amen. I believe that's what we come for
[35:15] is that the word would always be an
[35:17] encouragement to us. And may God just
[35:20] direct us and direct the word to our
[35:22] hearts and amen to us according to the
[35:25] needs that we have in him.
[35:28] Amen. So, I want to just uh
[35:33] read here from this portion of scripture
[35:34] and I'm just going to really preach from
[35:37] those three words tonight
[35:39] and just using that for just a a basis
[35:42] of where we'll draw from. I just also
[35:45] want to ask that you would um uh keep my
[35:48] wife and I and I think Zachary is going
[35:50] with us too. We have meetings that's
[35:52] scheduled there in uh um Louisville,
[35:55] just south of Louisville, Kentucky, uh
[35:57] with brother Diego and just a real good
[36:00] brother. And so we have some meetings
[36:03] that are scheduled. There have been
[36:04] scheduled for this weekend. So um we
[36:07] just ask certainly for your prayers.
[36:09] Brother Isaac Hatfield, he'll be here um
[36:12] on Sunday. And uh so we just want to
[36:15] remember that in prayer. And I know the
[36:17] Lord is here with us. Amen. to minister
[36:19] to our needs. And so I certainly just uh
[36:22] just covet your prayers as well. And uh
[36:26] I really mean that, friends. I don't
[36:27] just say that to say that. I really mean
[36:30] that with all my heart. I I have that to
[36:32] me. I you know, I find that to be of
[36:34] great comfort. Like brother Bram says, I
[36:36] can always count on those back home that
[36:37] are praying because it's not just me,
[36:40] but your prayers are are being prayed
[36:43] and and lifted up before God. And God's
[36:45] the one that's directing the word, Amen.
[36:48] to his to his people. And we just want
[36:50] to put our little part together wherever
[36:52] our part is. Amen. We want to put it
[36:54] together for the kingdom of God. And
[36:56] like the prophet said, making that final
[36:58] push. Amen. Because we believe one of
[37:00] just one of these moments, that last
[37:03] one's going to come in.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; God, bring it to where it needs to be.
[37:06] And that's that's it. We go home. So,
[37:08] we're laboring for that. Amen. So, let's
[37:12] read here in the scriptures 1
[37:13] Corinthians 13:8.
[37:16] Charity never faileth. But whether there
[37:19] be prophecies, they will fail. Whether
[37:22] they be tongues, they shall cease.
[37:25] Whether there be knowledge, it shall
[37:27] vanish away. For we know in part, and we
[37:31] prophesy in part. But when that which is
[37:34] perfect is come, then that which is in
[37:36] part shall be done away.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; And when I was a child, I spake as a
[37:42] child. I understood as a child. I
[37:45] thought as a child, but when I became a
[37:48] man, I put away childish things. Aren't
[37:51] you grateful for the tutorship of the
[37:53] Holy Spirit?
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Dealing with our lives, working with our
[37:58] lives, teaching us. Amen. Molding us and
[38:02] shaping. Amen. I'm thankful for that.
[38:05] Amen. Because you know what? He's never
[38:07] taken anything from me that uh that
[38:11] wasn't his word. But he's always just
[38:14] made his word more sure, more real, and
[38:18] he just grounds us in him. Amen. It's
[38:21] just a settling in him. For now we see
[38:23] through a glass darkly, but then face to
[38:26] face. Now I know in part, but then shall
[38:30] I know even as also I am known. And now
[38:35] abide of faith, hope, charity, these
[38:38] three. But the greatest of these is
[38:41] charity. And I'd like to speak on the
[38:44] unfailing
[38:46] love of God. The unfailing love of God.
[38:50] Let's just bow our hearts in a word of
[38:51] prayer.
[38:53] Heavenly Father, Lord, we are so
[38:57] thankful Lord for your grace once again.
[39:00] Lord and dear God as Lord we just to
[39:05] speak and to talk about the love of God
[39:08] where would we ever begin and where does
[39:11] it ever end Lord I'm thankful that love
[39:15] just as we can see it is has no
[39:18] beginning has no ending Lord for love
[39:22] like your prophet said and the
[39:24] scriptures declare love is eternal
[39:28] &gt;&gt; as John would Right. God is love. And
[39:32] Lord, to see that great attribute of
[39:35] love that has been expressed, Lord, you
[39:39] just didn't leave it, Lord, wrapped in
[39:41] words. You just didn't, Lord, leave it,
[39:45] oh God, there, Father, upon the page and
[39:49] what would be expressed and rehearsed,
[39:51] but you manifested your love to us,
[39:55] Lord. You have Lord shown and expressed
[39:59] it. The writers have Lord taken from
[40:02] this Lord of that expression God that
[40:06] even as they walked with you here Lord
[40:09] when you were here in your earthly body
[40:12] that earthly temple that had been
[40:15] purposed and Lord just so prepared Lord
[40:20] to you might come and understand us and
[40:23] you might come and redeem us that you
[40:25] might come and fully dwell in us oh God.
[40:29] Lord, men have tried down through the
[40:32] ages to try to comprehend, tried to even
[40:36] express the love of God. But Lord, it
[40:39] does not lay within our finite power to
[40:43] Lord comprehend. Lord, I'm so glad about
[40:46] that, Lord. I'm so thankful that the
[40:49] love of God, it surpasses, Lord, the the
[40:52] very knowledge, Lord, of man. And it oh
[40:56] God it just Lord passes Lord beyond all
[41:00] reasoning beyond all imagination. And
[41:03] Lord, it's just a reality that Lord
[41:05] anchors within our soul, Lord. That
[41:08] Father, to know that God, you loved us
[41:13] first, Lord. And Father, all that you
[41:16] have done, every every single example
[41:20] through the scripture, Lord, you have
[41:22] given an example of your love and your
[41:25] care and your desire, oh God, to fully
[41:29] bring us back home safely. Lord, as the
[41:32] scripture said, Lord, even in this time,
[41:36] Lord, for then, Lord, we shall see face
[41:39] to face, Lord, to be known, even as we
[41:42] are known. And Lord, we realize that as
[41:45] we're walking in this world, Lord, it's
[41:47] a, as your prophet described it in words
[41:50] that, oh God, it's a a dark and a gloomy
[41:53] world, but faith lightens up the way,
[41:56] Lord, that we can see one step at a
[41:59] time, Lord. Oh God, how we're thankful
[42:02] for the grace of God that shines upon
[42:05] our path, Lord, that we might, Lord, be
[42:08] able to put one foot in front of the
[42:10] other, Lord, and to know that God, one
[42:12] of these days, Lord, we shall rest
[42:15] safely in heaven shore, Lord. Oh, we're
[42:19] longing, Lord God, for we believe that
[42:21] any moment, Lord Jesus, is truly, Lord,
[42:24] the climaxing, oh God, of that coming
[42:27] that is set hold to our hearts, Lord.
[42:30] And we're so thankful, God. So thankful
[42:33] for your mercy. Now, we just ask that
[42:35] you would come, Lord, be the speaker
[42:38] here tonight, Lord. Lord, I pray what,
[42:41] Lord, I could not get away from, Lord,
[42:43] upon my heart, Lord, and you've directed
[42:46] me here, Lord, in just a few moments in
[42:48] the latter part of this evening, Lord.
[42:51] Oh, God, to take me from where we were,
[42:54] Lord, looking at going. You know our
[42:56] needs, Lord. And I pray that God, may
[42:59] the word just reach to every one of our
[43:02] hearts, Lord. And when we would leave
[43:04] from this place, may we be settled,
[43:07] satisfied, and overwhelmed with your
[43:09] love, Lord. Grant it, Lord, I pray in
[43:12] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you as
[43:16] you're being seated.
[43:21] I want to just look here in that word
[43:24] and the word unfailing itself as we look
[43:29] in the scripture that charity never
[43:32] faileth. It's it it's unable. It's not
[43:35] able to fail. And certainly we
[43:37] understand that this charity that's
[43:40] being spoken of that this is more than
[43:42] just
[43:44] human love because human love our our
[43:47] human love at times it can fail because
[43:50] human love itself down here on this
[43:53] level it's everything if if the
[43:56] conditions are just right then you know
[43:59] it it it will it will show itself but
[44:02] that's why we must have the love of God
[44:06] because there's going to be many times
[44:08] and we already see this within our
[44:11] journey as Christians that where
[44:13] conditions themselves are not favorable
[44:16] conditions but if the love of God is
[44:19] there that the love of God does not look
[44:22] at conditions but it's an unconditional
[44:25] love and it's actually that which will
[44:27] come in and move us and pulsate through
[44:30] our lives. It will actually, as the
[44:32] prophet said, it will come and it will
[44:34] override our file love. You see, God
[44:37] when the when the Holy Spirit, the agape
[44:39] love is come in, he sets down right in
[44:42] the middle of our lives and he's to be
[44:44] the very influence in in in our lives
[44:48] and to influence every part of our life
[44:50] to direct us. And that's that's what he
[44:53] wants to do to just influence us. And
[44:55] that's and that's what we want the love
[44:57] of God. And we we need the love of God
[45:00] to influence us because with walking
[45:03] still in these uh bodies of time, we as
[45:07] I said, we can be very limited uh to
[45:10] that of conditions. And that's why that
[45:12] even as we uh stand here tonight, we're
[45:15] gathered here tonight. I'm sure that
[45:17] there could have been many other reasons
[45:20] or there could have been other things
[45:22] that maybe you could have done, but you
[45:24] laid those aside. No matter how pressing
[45:27] it might have been, you laid it aside to
[45:30] be in the house of God. And the prophet,
[45:32] he says it like this in the church and
[45:34] its condition. He says when you do
[45:36] things like that, you lay things aside
[45:39] to be in the house of God. He said
[45:41] that's a sacrifice. And he said with
[45:43] that sacrifice, he said you watch God
[45:46] will come and bless that sacrifice.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; There's times we sacrifice to lay aside
[45:52] that and even in how we might feel. And
[45:54] and I'm not talking about, you know,
[45:56] coming to the house of God if you're not
[45:58] feeling well and you're sick, but I
[46:00] think you understand what I mean that
[46:01] sometimes it would just you, you know,
[46:04] even in our spirit, you get weary or you
[46:06] can get down and you don't you don't
[46:09] necessarily feel like worshiping maybe
[46:11] in the way that you would uh normally
[46:14] worship when it just seems like it's
[46:16] just a time where, you know, nothing has
[46:19] to be done or or even encouraged. you're
[46:21] just I mean you may even have to pull
[46:23] over on the side of the road. You're
[46:25] just you're you're in worship. But then
[46:27] there's those other times that where you
[46:30] don't feel like it, but there's
[46:32] something that moves you beyond just a
[46:34] conditional love. That's the love of
[46:37] God. And where it moves into your heart
[46:39] to say, "Lord, I love you."
[46:42] &gt;&gt; It may not look the same as it would
[46:44] maybe in other times, but your but the
[46:46] love because it's not your love. It's
[46:49] his love. It's be it's it's not my love.
[46:53] It's his love. It's it's it's his love
[46:55] that's come and it's caught a hold in in
[46:59] that part of himself that he deposited
[47:02] in your life and through that it
[47:04] reflects his love right back to him. So
[47:07] we're not loving him with our love.
[47:11] We're loving him with his love.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it's his love that that
[47:16] pushes that moves our love even into
[47:20] action. And I think about it as it's
[47:22] read I believe it's in the per Pamian
[47:24] church age where brother Brandham says
[47:26] notice God commended them for their
[47:28] faith their love. And he says I want you
[47:31] to notice he's not talking about his
[47:32] faith at that time. He's talking about
[47:35] theirs. But how could we you or me or
[47:38] even that in the per Pamian age ever
[47:41] have faith that is commendable? love
[47:43] that is commendable or even to be called
[47:46] the faithful. How could that be made
[47:49] possible without the faithful God?
[47:52] &gt;&gt; It's impossible without God. And that's
[47:55] why I think we can take such a
[47:57] consolation in the scriptures. If God be
[48:00] for us,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; who can be against us? Because it's the
[48:04] faithful God. He he never gave up when
[48:06] when when situations look so bleak. I
[48:10] think how the prophet says it in the
[48:11] masterpiece. I love how he says he says
[48:13] when the fall had taken place and
[48:16] situations had the report had come back
[48:19] he said did God just leave the
[48:21] masterpiece fallen face down he said no
[48:26] he came down and he began to by his word
[48:29] declare I will make a way back and he be
[48:33] to work he's a faithful through all all
[48:36] the obstacles through through every
[48:38] situation that even when they could say
[48:41] well Look, look at the end of Noah. But
[48:44] God wasn't God knew all of that. But it
[48:46] wasn't about the end of Noah. God
[48:49] achieved through Noah what God desired
[48:52] to achieve.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; And Noah was declared righteous.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? It's the same way
[48:59] when it came that it came through
[49:01] Abraham. It came then through Isaac. It
[49:04] came through Jacob. It came through
[49:05] Joseph. The righteousness of God
[49:08] prevailed through their and over their
[49:12] humanity to what God desired to achieve.
[49:16] He achieved it.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; So when we look at this unfailing of the
[49:22] love of God, the word unfailing means
[49:25] without error or fault, reliable,
[49:30] constant. I want to just say this, you
[49:33] know, at the crossing from time to
[49:36] eternity because these these scriptures
[49:39] that I read, pardon me, I I want to just
[49:41] refer back to this this opening
[49:43] scripture that we read, Paul when he's
[49:46] saying charity never faileth. And he
[49:48] speaks of how prophecies they shall
[49:50] fail. In other words, he's not look he's
[49:53] not looking down upon prophecy. He's not
[49:55] looking down upon tongues. That's not
[49:57] the whole that's not the context. What
[49:59] Paul is saying is these are a part of
[50:02] the journey. God knew that you and I
[50:06] would would have needs in our life. God
[50:09] knew at times like the prophet said that
[50:11] there would be things that would not be
[50:13] wrote in here. Questions we would have
[50:16] in life, maybe even decisions that were
[50:18] to make with. And the prophet said God
[50:20] provided gifts that he has placed within
[50:23] the body to help you and I even in those
[50:26] kind of times. God knew we would need
[50:29] all of this during the journey of time.
[50:32] But after after that that passage of
[50:36] time is over and then we have crossed
[50:38] that dividing line of time and eternity
[50:42] and we stand there on the other side.
[50:44] I'll never preach another sermon.
[50:48] There'll never be another another gift
[50:50] that's been used. But all of that has
[50:52] been endowments that God has given for
[50:56] you and I in this journey.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; And I want to say what Paul is saying is
[51:01] that every one of those things are are
[51:04] are a part of the journey that God has
[51:07] given. Well, you know, brother Samuel,
[51:09] the the enemy's taken them like this.
[51:11] Enemy's taken like that. That's true.
[51:12] But I'm not focused on what the enemy
[51:14] has done. If we're standing on the word
[51:16] of God, it's the love. Listen, it was
[51:19] not man who gave the gifts. It is God
[51:22] who gave the gifts. They're love gifts.
[51:24] The prophet called them. He said they
[51:26] were gifts of engagement that God gave.
[51:29] And God gave those. And he says as the
[51:31] bride of Christ, we declare that we are
[51:34] his bride because we receive that
[51:38] engagement ring which is that of God's
[51:41] the gifts coming into the body. And we
[51:44] receive that. There's not one gift that
[51:46] that the bride of Jesus Christ. I'm
[51:48] talking about the true bride. We're not.
[51:50] You don't go beyond. Well, we're beyond
[51:52] the gifts. No, we all the way through
[51:56] &gt;&gt; until these mortal bodies are changed.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; God said it in the church
[52:04] and no one can take it out.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Love never fails. It will direct. It's
[52:11] the oversight. So you know this journey
[52:14] of time but love love love itself I want
[52:17] you to think of this because love itself
[52:20] when this journey of time is over
[52:23] love itself that we've received in our
[52:27] hearts that has drawn us and brought us
[52:29] to where we are has been with us through
[52:33] every test through every trial. That's
[52:36] true.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Has ministered to us at every moment
[52:39] that we've been down.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; We've been discouraged.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Has anointed others to reach out to us.
[52:47] All of that at when we cross from this
[52:50] time veil of time into eternity. We
[52:53] cross
[52:55] right into the very atmosphere
[52:58] of the love of God that's in our soul.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; The prophet said perfect love. That's he
[53:03] said there's no there's no other way he
[53:06] said it like this in the sixth seal than
[53:08] to describe it other than you've just
[53:10] arrived. And I want to say this to you,
[53:13] you and I. God is working on our life
[53:16] and he's bringing us to a place that is
[53:19] certain. And he's doing that by his
[53:22] word. He's building us up. He's molding
[53:24] us. He's there's a maturing that's going
[53:27] on in our life. And you know when we
[53:29] stand there on that day, it will be
[53:30] declared, "You have arrived." He's
[53:33] working here in time. He's molding us.
[53:35] He's shaping us through all the
[53:37] hardships, the tests, the trials,
[53:39] through everything that comes our way.
[53:41] God is working all of this out because
[53:43] at the end of the day, it's character
[53:46] that is taken in rapture. And that
[53:48] character is gold. No wonder David said
[53:51] that that precious in the sight of the
[53:54] Lord is the death of his saints. It
[53:57] doesn't seem in our mind because we miss
[54:00] our loved ones. We miss those that's
[54:02] gone on.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; But you see, when we when God when we
[54:06] look at it from God's eyes, it doesn't
[54:09] take away our sorrow. And there's truly
[54:11] a comfort when we know where one h has
[54:14] gone and entered in. It's a comfort, but
[54:16] it doesn't take away the sorrow. Paul
[54:18] said, "We sorrow not as others." He
[54:20] didn't say, "We didn't sorrow." But God
[54:22] when that scripture said precious in the
[54:24] sight of the Lord is the death of his
[54:26] saints. That very scripture means it's
[54:28] that which is harvesting out of the
[54:30] earth a precious mineral. And God
[54:34] himself has allowed the gold of his own
[54:37] life of deity and his life coming in and
[54:40] molding you and I and shaping you and I.
[54:42] And then when it comes to the end,
[54:44] whether you and I go by the way of the
[54:46] grave or in the rapture, it will be the
[54:49] very harvesting
[54:51] &gt;&gt; of character.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; And the only thing, and I'll just say it
[54:55] like this, the only thing even we can
[54:58] say now is what we will say then, Lord,
[55:01] &gt;&gt; it's because of you.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; I love that song. Because of who you
[55:05] are.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; I give you glory.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Because of him.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Because of him.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:12] Oh my, look at this. When brother
[55:15] Brandham, he would say it like this on
[55:16] the unfailing
[55:18] of of of the love of God. And he says,
[55:21] "Though though I speak with tongue of
[55:23] men and angels and have not love, it
[55:25] profit me nothing. Though I give all my
[55:27] goods to feed the poor, it profit me
[55:29] nothing. Though I have power to move
[55:31] mountains and so forth, it profit me
[55:33] nothing. Where there is prophecies,
[55:35] it'll fail. And where there's tongues,
[55:37] it'll cease. Where there's knowledge,
[55:38] it'll vanish away. But when perfect love
[55:42] has come into the human heart, all
[55:44] demons in hell will never be able to
[55:49] upset it. I want you to be I want you to
[55:52] lock in on this right here. He didn't
[55:54] say, remember when Jesus said, "Upon
[55:56] this rock, I will build my church." And
[55:59] that rock is the revelation of Jesus
[56:02] Christ to you personally.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; That's that he did it for you. you were
[56:08] included in him and that his grace is
[56:10] sufficient and what he started in your
[56:12] life, he will see it all the way
[56:15] through.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. Let me tell you, it's
[56:19] not the let me say it like this. It's
[56:20] not the revelation of put your name
[56:22] there. That's not what the new birth is
[56:25] there. It's the revelation of Jesus
[56:27] Christ to you personally. It's not about
[56:30] It's not about you. It's about what he
[56:32] has done for you and you are included in
[56:35] him. You are identified in his sacrifice
[56:37] in his suffering and by the Holy Spirit
[56:40] drawing upon your life you have made a
[56:42] choice under the influence of the Holy
[56:45] Spirit to say I want to be identified
[56:47] with Jesus Christ. What caused that to
[56:50] rise in your heart? It is the revelation
[56:52] of Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit the
[56:55] love of God reaching out to your heart
[56:58] that would cause you to rise and say I
[57:00] want to be identified with him. Why?
[57:03] because you were identified with him
[57:07] before the foundation of the world.
[57:09] Where were you at Job?
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation of Jesus Christ. It's
[57:19] God unfolding himself.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; What an anchor. It didn't say, Lotus,
[57:24] all demons in hell will never be able to
[57:26] upset it. It didn't say at times you may
[57:29] not be upset.
[57:31] It didn't say at times that you may not
[57:33] be frustrated.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; It didn't say at times that you may not
[57:36] be weary.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; It didn't say that. What what cannot be
[57:41] upset? The love of God.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; That's why it's important the love of
[57:45] God in your heart because because the
[57:47] love of God in your heart, the Bible
[57:49] said perfect love casteth out fear.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Man, the perfect love of God. And
[57:55] sometimes you might get out of tune. I
[57:57] can get out of tune. Come on. We We've
[57:59] all been there. been get out of tune.
[58:01] But the Holy Spirit comes right back in
[58:03] and he knows his instruments. He knows
[58:05] his symphony. He knows the strings, the
[58:08] predestinated strings of our lives. And
[58:10] he can come right back in and begin to
[58:13] bring it in synchronization with his
[58:15] word. And what does it do? It brings it
[58:17] right back to the melody that I'm the
[58:20] Lord that health all thine diseases. I'm
[58:22] the Lord that forgiveth all thine
[58:23] iniquities. I'm the Lord that has
[58:25] watched over all your life. It brings it
[58:28] right back in sync with his word. And
[58:30] that's his word that you're standing on.
[58:32] His word cannot fail because he can't
[58:36] fail.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; No matter. So you might as well just
[58:43] just tell the devil to get out of here
[58:45] on my shoulder trying to accuse me for
[58:48] when I've got frustrated or I got down
[58:51] or you know. But you see what's
[58:53] happened. And the love of God draws you
[58:55] back to the sacrifice where you can say,
[58:58] "Lord, you are my propituation. Forgive
[59:00] me for entertaining that thought.
[59:02] Forgive me for getting down. Forgive me
[59:04] for getting frustrated. Forgive me,
[59:06] Lord, for doubt entering in." What is
[59:09] that? It's the love of God that draws
[59:11] you back.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; No wonder Paul could write, "I am
[59:19] crucified with Christ." Right.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but
[59:24] Christ liveth in me, and the life which
[59:28] I now live in the flesh, I live by the
[59:32] faith of the Son of God, who loved me
[59:36] and gave himself for me. Paul, how how
[59:38] are you getting up every day?
[59:41] &gt;&gt; By this?
[59:42] &gt;&gt; How are you dying daily by this? Here's
[59:45] the Paul could say, "This is the secret
[59:48] &gt;&gt; of my life." Hallelujah.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; He goes on, I do not frustrate. I'm not
[59:53] I'm not trying to debate with the grace
[59:55] of God. I'm not I'm not in any argument
[59:58] with God's grace. For if righteousness
[1:00:00] come by the law, then Christ is dead in
[1:00:04] vain. He died in vain. But he did not
[1:00:06] die in vain.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; It's what is it doing? It's resting in
[1:00:10] that finished work of Calvary.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:14] Not my feelings, but I'm resting in what
[1:00:17] he that begun this good work in me
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; shall perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:00:24] Christ. Where is it? I've got a
[1:00:26] destination.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; I've got a destiny. That destiny is
[1:00:30] perfect love. That destiny is the
[1:00:32] rapture. That destiny is the other side.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just tell you,
[1:00:38] wherever you're at right now, it might
[1:00:40] be a tester, might be a trial, wherever
[1:00:42] it's at, do not tell anybody that that
[1:00:46] is your current address because your
[1:00:48] mail is not to be a forwarded to the
[1:00:51] trial that you're going through or the
[1:00:53] tribulation that you're in. That's not
[1:00:55] your destiny.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Your destiny, Zion, is the rapture.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; You're passing through the valley of
[1:01:04] Baka. But Baka is not your new address.
[1:01:07] Hallelujah.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Your address is in Christ and it's never
[1:01:12] changed. No matter the conditions, no
[1:01:14] matter the feelings, no matter the
[1:01:16] circumstance, the address remains the
[1:01:19] same in Christ.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul could write. You talk. I
[1:01:30] want you to watch this. Paul could say
[1:01:32] this word yet once more signifies the
[1:01:35] removing of those things that are shaken
[1:01:37] as things that are made that those
[1:01:39] things which cannot be shaken may
[1:01:41] remain. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[1:01:45] which cannot be moved.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us have grace whereby we may
[1:01:52] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[1:01:54] godly fear. This kingdom is his word
[1:01:57] made power. And I love the the very
[1:02:00] phrase cannot be moved means it cannot
[1:02:02] be shaken. It's unmoved. It's not liable
[1:02:06] to overthrow and disorder. It's firm and
[1:02:10] stable. Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; You see this is why that God's desire
[1:02:15] that the word, the love of God that it
[1:02:18] comes in to the human heart. It comes
[1:02:22] into our lives in the depth of our soul
[1:02:25] and it raises up a son and daughter of
[1:02:27] God because there the love of God, it
[1:02:30] abides. It remains. It's constant. It
[1:02:34] doesn't matter what can come around in
[1:02:36] your spirit realm. It doesn't matter
[1:02:38] what can come around in your flesh. That
[1:02:41] word cannot be overthrown.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; It's not liable to overthrow. Oh well,
[1:02:51] you know, well, Polycarp went to the
[1:02:53] state, but it wasn't overthrown. Who was
[1:02:55] not overthrown? The word was not
[1:02:58] overthrown.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Many that stood there, teenagers all all
[1:03:04] the way through, I think perpeta,
[1:03:07] different ones that wrote in the Fox's
[1:03:09] book of martyrs. young people that stood
[1:03:11] there, men and women down through the
[1:03:14] ages. Let me just say this. I'm talking
[1:03:16] about you who stand day in and day out.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; You and I will run to them in that day
[1:03:22] and say, "Oh my Polycarp, I can't wait
[1:03:25] to meet Polycar. I can't wait to meet
[1:03:26] them all." But to stand there and say,
[1:03:28] "Oh my, thank you, brother. Thank you
[1:03:30] for the encouragement that you gave me
[1:03:32] down in this age." And it just it it it
[1:03:35] blows your mind to think that the
[1:03:37] prophet said that they will come to you
[1:03:40] and want to know how did you make it
[1:03:42] through because this is the most
[1:03:44] deceptive age.
[1:03:47] But if it's the most deceptive age, then
[1:03:50] God himself was responsible for given
[1:03:53] such clarity, such certainty that would
[1:03:57] bring such stability of something that
[1:03:59] would anchor you and I and hold us
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; through all sorts of deception, through
[1:04:05] every trial, through every tribulation.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And I want to say, he's been faithful.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; He's been faithful. God promised he
[1:04:14] would send this message and he did. The
[1:04:16] angel of the Lord accompanies this
[1:04:18] message. Hallelujah. God is faithful.
[1:04:22] God has come to make this word live in
[1:04:25] our lives. I want to say God is
[1:04:27] faithful.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:30] God is faithful. When we didn't know
[1:04:32] many different times, how is this going
[1:04:34] to come out? How is this situation going
[1:04:36] to come out? But God's word is faithful
[1:04:40] because God is faithful. Yes.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just read a few
[1:04:48] scriptures. Matthew 5:18. Till heaven
[1:04:52] and earth pass, one jot or one tit, even
[1:04:56] even an accent mark shall in no wise
[1:04:59] pass from the law,
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; till all be fulfilled.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; You think God isn't concerned about
[1:05:06] every
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; little part of our life?
[1:05:10] He's not just looking at big parts. You
[1:05:12] and I sometimes we look at just big
[1:05:14] parts. Sometimes when things we're
[1:05:17] overwhelmed by something that's a big
[1:05:18] part to us and then other things in our
[1:05:21] life that maybe we don't feel so
[1:05:22] overwhelmed and maybe we're not as
[1:05:24] fervent as we are in other times. But
[1:05:26] God, even through the midst of that, God
[1:05:28] himself will not allow one jot or one
[1:05:32] title
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; to fail.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; You know how it is for you and I
[1:05:36] sometimes you're doing a job painting or
[1:05:38] whatever more. Y'all know what I'm
[1:05:39] talking about. We've got some parts even
[1:05:41] in this building where it's just like
[1:05:44] we've got enough. We've done we've done
[1:05:45] enough. Just that's all right. That
[1:05:46] piece ain't there. It's all right. It's
[1:05:47] okay. I mean, it's I'm done, man. I
[1:05:50] mean, it's enough, right? It's like
[1:05:52] sometimes people putting in carpet, you
[1:05:54] know, maybe they're doing on themselves
[1:05:55] and finally they get back there and
[1:05:57] they're like, "Nope, not in that. I
[1:05:59] don't feel like stretching no more in
[1:06:00] that corner. Let's just let's just put
[1:06:01] the subwoofer over that part right
[1:06:03] there." Not God. Not God. God don't do
[1:06:08] that with his word. He don't do that
[1:06:10] with our lives. He don't get to a spot
[1:06:12] and say, "Look, I I've been trying to
[1:06:13] stretch. I've been trying to minister to
[1:06:16] this in your life. I've been trying."
[1:06:17] No. God will continue to work. You know
[1:06:19] why? He cannot give up because he cannot
[1:06:23] fail.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even when you and I can look
[1:06:28] at and say, "Lord, I I don't see how
[1:06:29] this could be. I've tried this or I've
[1:06:30] tried that." But you know what? God
[1:06:32] himself, he's bringing us to a place,
[1:06:34] you know, the whole thing is is for you
[1:06:36] and I to rest and allow him to do what
[1:06:38] only he can do and what he will do.
[1:06:40] Because remember, he doesn't want our
[1:06:42] signature mixed up with him. He wants
[1:06:45] his signature to be over everything in
[1:06:47] our lives,
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; you know, cuz like some people have like
[1:06:52] woodworking and other things like that
[1:06:54] and they want to know, well, who made it
[1:06:56] and who who made this and who made that?
[1:06:58] What furniture place made this? Let me
[1:07:00] tell you something. And God himself has
[1:07:02] his signature all over our lives.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Matthew 24:35, "Heaven and earth shall
[1:07:08] pass away, but my words shall not pass
[1:07:13] away."
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "It's easier for
[1:07:16] heaven and earth to pass than one tit of
[1:07:20] the law to fail."
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but when I was,
[1:07:25] you know, when I was teaching school and
[1:07:27] things, I think about that tit right
[1:07:28] now. I think about how many times I'd
[1:07:31] have different ones come to me and man I
[1:07:32] I was just I think I think I I think
[1:07:35] phonics for me I think I was taught to
[1:07:37] just memorize. I don't know that for
[1:07:39] sure but I kind of think that way
[1:07:40] because I have to kind of the way I have
[1:07:42] to kind of go through words and things
[1:07:43] like that and I can butcher them. But
[1:07:45] you know so I'd have kids names and I I
[1:07:47] would look at their names and I would
[1:07:49] think well you know uh you know trying
[1:07:51] to pronounce their names and you know
[1:07:52] some would have that little hyphenation
[1:07:54] that little accent mark. Hey, they
[1:07:56] wanted me to know that accent mark meant
[1:07:59] to do something,
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; right? So they wanted me to know that.
[1:08:04] So I would many times I would have to
[1:08:06] write it out and I would just write out
[1:08:07] above their name how how it sounded to
[1:08:10] me. So when I would see the name I I
[1:08:12] would read it in that way. I'm saying it
[1:08:14] this way that God just does not and he
[1:08:17] will not bypass one little part of his
[1:08:20] word. He's not one that just gives up.
[1:08:23] He's not one that throws in the towel.
[1:08:25] He's there for the long haul to bring us
[1:08:28] home safely.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; This is why brother Brown would say it
[1:08:33] like this. Just listen. He said, "If God
[1:08:34] has said anything, it's the most solid
[1:08:36] foundation we can rest on." Faith can
[1:08:39] rest on no other. Faith cannot find its
[1:08:41] resting place upon the shifting sands of
[1:08:43] people's ideas. But it takes its
[1:08:45] everlasting stand upon the immovable
[1:08:48] rock of God's eternal word. We can rest
[1:08:50] on it if God said so. That should settle
[1:08:53] it. Oh my. He says, but there's nothing,
[1:08:57] he says, that can be any more up to-date
[1:08:59] than what God has said. He said, you
[1:09:01] know, I feel like, he said, I feel like,
[1:09:02] you know, that brother there in the
[1:09:04] south where they said, Moses, why do you
[1:09:06] pack that Bible? Now, remember, brother
[1:09:07] Ramry tells a story and Moses Moes
[1:09:10] couldn't read the Bible, but he packed
[1:09:12] the Bible. And he said, why do you pack
[1:09:14] it? You can't even read a word on it.
[1:09:15] Why do you carry that Bible under your
[1:09:17] arm? And the expression from the old man
[1:09:20] was, "I carry it, boss, because I
[1:09:22] believe it. And I believe it so much
[1:09:24] that I believe it from kiver to kiver,
[1:09:27] and the kiver also, for on the kiver,
[1:09:29] it's written, holy bible. I'd rather be
[1:09:31] standing on this Bible in the hour of my
[1:09:34] death than to be standing in heaven."
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "That's quite a statement,
[1:09:40] Mo, for you to make." He said, "The
[1:09:42] reason I say it, boss, is because it's
[1:09:44] more sure to stand than heaven is. For
[1:09:46] the Bible said, "Heavens and earth will
[1:09:48] pass away, but my word shall never
[1:09:50] fail." Oh, brother Ram said, "I think we
[1:09:52] all feel like that." Let God's word, way
[1:09:55] he wrote it. No private interpretation,
[1:09:57] just speak for itself when no one's
[1:10:00] polluted it. Read it, believe it. It may
[1:10:02] seem strange, some of its quotations,
[1:10:04] but sometimes works in mysterious ways,
[1:10:07] his wonders to perform. We must believe
[1:10:10] it. Let me just tell you what to do.
[1:10:12] Quit filtering the word and receive it.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't filter it. Even listen, I
[1:10:18] know it has to come in our mind. But
[1:10:20] don't try to filter it out as far as
[1:10:22] does it make sense? Does this apply to
[1:10:25] you? Just say, Lord, this part that of
[1:10:28] the word, you are the word. I'm a part
[1:10:30] of the word, and I am going to accept
[1:10:33] what you have already said about me. I'm
[1:10:36] not going to filter it out. I'm not
[1:10:38] going to filter it through my own
[1:10:40] failures. I'm not going to filter it
[1:10:43] through my own humanity. I'm not going
[1:10:45] to filter it because I want it pure. So,
[1:10:48] I'm going to accept the pure word of God
[1:10:51] and let the pure word of God produce
[1:10:54] pure faith,
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; pure love, pure change, pure
[1:10:58] righteousness,
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; it's stronger. It's stronger than the
[1:11:03] world.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh my," think of this. The
[1:11:07] Bible said, "For all flesh is as grass,
[1:11:10] and all the glory of man is the flower
[1:11:12] of grass. The grass witherth, and the
[1:11:14] flower thereof fadeth away, but the word
[1:11:17] of the Lord endureth
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; forever.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And this is the word by which the gospel
[1:11:25] is preached unto you. Look at the
[1:11:27] scripture here. Isaiah 55. For as the
[1:11:30] rain cometh down, and the snow from
[1:11:31] heaven, and returneth not hither, but
[1:11:33] waterth the earth, and maketh it, and
[1:11:36] bring it bring forth and bud, that it
[1:11:38] may give seed to the sewer, and bread to
[1:11:41] the eater, so shall my word be that
[1:11:43] goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall
[1:11:46] not
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; return unto me void,
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:11:53] please, and it shall prosper in the
[1:11:55] thing where unento I sent it. You know
[1:11:58] what I'm thankful for when he sent his
[1:12:00] word. Listen, it wasn't me or you per se
[1:12:03] that actually received it. It's that
[1:12:06] part of God on the inside that is
[1:12:08] actually who you and I really are. It's
[1:12:10] the part that actually the word came and
[1:12:13] it's that it be to draw upon that part
[1:12:15] in our life and it's captured right
[1:12:17] there. And you know even as the word is
[1:12:20] working in our life. Oh like Abraham the
[1:12:22] prophet tells us that Abraham had
[1:12:24] misunderstandings of the promise. You
[1:12:26] remember the different things in
[1:12:28] Abraham's life. But did Abraham's
[1:12:30] misunderstandings or did he allow his
[1:12:32] misunderstandings to keep him back from
[1:12:35] the promise of God? Not at all. Why?
[1:12:37] There was the purpose of God that was
[1:12:40] working in his life and could not be
[1:12:42] defeated. It'd be like you and I. Here
[1:12:44] we are. We're trying to draw something
[1:12:46] or maybe you're trying to do something,
[1:12:48] lay bricks on top of one another. And
[1:12:49] you have a brickmason out there who's
[1:12:52] who's very wellkilled within it. And
[1:12:54] here he knows how to put that mortar on.
[1:12:56] And I watched those guys out there one
[1:12:57] day at the brick layer inside of there
[1:12:59] out there in South Amherst. And man,
[1:13:01] them guys are just moving with their
[1:13:03] hands and putting that stuff down there
[1:13:04] just like that. And you know what? If
[1:13:06] you or I were doing it and picking it
[1:13:08] up, you know, the boys tried to do it.
[1:13:09] This was years ago trying to do it and
[1:13:11] look at all those things. And you know
[1:13:12] those guys say, "Uh-uh." And no, put put
[1:13:15] it like this. And so they kept working
[1:13:16] with them and trying to, you know, help
[1:13:18] them to do it. I'm glad that God when
[1:13:20] God looks in you and I and goes, "Uh-uh.
[1:13:22] It ain't uh-uh that you're not a son.
[1:13:23] Uh-uh that you're not a daughter. It's
[1:13:25] uh-uh that that's not how my word is to
[1:13:27] come forth in that of your life. Here,
[1:13:29] let me show you again. He's faithful.
[1:13:31] He's a hands-on teacher.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has given. He made a way.
[1:13:37] He provided so you and I would not be
[1:13:40] left to our own demise or our own
[1:13:42] wonderings. He said, "If I go away, I
[1:13:45] will I will give you another comforter."
[1:13:48] And that another comforter is himself in
[1:13:51] the form of the Holy Ghost, the
[1:13:54] fulfillment of his word that you and I
[1:13:56] can rest in.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory. It'll not return unto me
[1:14:02] void. So, let me just read you a few of
[1:14:04] these. I'd rather be statements. The
[1:14:07] prophet saying, "I'd rather have favor
[1:14:08] with God and be called a holy roller
[1:14:10] fanatic, whatever they want to call me,
[1:14:12] and have favor with God to know that
[1:14:14] he's standing here this afternoon than
[1:14:16] all the wealth Chicago's got or all the
[1:14:18] glory the world has got." Listen this
[1:14:20] one. I'd rather be standing right here
[1:14:22] now holding this picture with the pillar
[1:14:25] fire telling you what that is and know
[1:14:28] that he's standing right here within 5t
[1:14:30] of where I'm standing right now. I'd
[1:14:32] rather have this feeling and consolation
[1:14:33] that I have right now than to be the
[1:14:35] king over all the earth for a million
[1:14:37] years.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; He said, I'd rather another place. He
[1:14:40] said, I'd rather be standing right here
[1:14:42] with the love of God in my heart, trying
[1:14:43] to tell others about it than anything I
[1:14:45] know in the world. I have a peace that
[1:14:48] nothing else could put there
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; like Jesus Christ has.
[1:14:54] Romans 5 verse one.
[1:14:58] Therefore, being justified by faith,
[1:15:01] we have peace
[1:15:04] with God
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the Lord Jesus will
[1:15:12] never come and trouble his peace that
[1:15:16] he's given to you.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; His peace is his word. His peace is who
[1:15:21] he is. It's an attribute of who he is.
[1:15:24] But it's always Satan's business
[1:15:27] to want to try to get us in turmoil,
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; wondering, pressures, situations that
[1:15:34] can come. But I want you to remember
[1:15:36] this is a peace
[1:15:38] that Jesus said the world never gave
[1:15:41] you.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz he said, "My peace." You see what
[1:15:45] he's saying? I leave with you. what what
[1:15:47] I have what has held me what has been
[1:15:50] present
[1:15:52] through my journey
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave it with you how could
[1:15:57] he leave his peace it was his life
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; that would be deposited
[1:16:03] that through the midst of all the
[1:16:06] situations of life there is a peace that
[1:16:09] Paul would write of by experience and
[1:16:11] say it's a peace that passes
[1:16:14] all understanding
[1:16:16] It's a peace that doesn't even make
[1:16:19] sense. It's a peace that dwells right in
[1:16:23] the midst of your life. And let me just
[1:16:25] tell you this, don't even try to make
[1:16:28] sense of it.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Just rest in it.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Because you cannot, nor can I with our
[1:16:33] finite mind explain it or ever pin it
[1:16:37] down. Cuz if you could do that, you
[1:16:39] could pin God down.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; You could explain God. But God is not
[1:16:43] explainable. He's not even meant to be
[1:16:46] explainable. He's meant to be believed.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; The greatest compliment the prophet said
[1:16:51] that we could ever do, the greatest, how
[1:16:53] how many say, "Lord, I want to give you
[1:16:54] the greatest compliment." The prophet
[1:16:56] said, "The greatest thing we could ever
[1:16:57] do," he said, "is to believe what he
[1:17:00] said."
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; That's the greatest thing that we can
[1:17:02] do. You know, when you take the word
[1:17:04] into your life, every one of us here at
[1:17:06] different times, you've been sick in
[1:17:07] your body. Maybe you had to go take an
[1:17:09] antibiotic. And that antibiotic would
[1:17:11] have so much of a poison within it and
[1:17:13] so much also of within the antidote that
[1:17:16] it would actually go to work. A certain
[1:17:17] part would actually go to start working
[1:17:19] and killing those other germs. And then
[1:17:21] the other part would actually go to
[1:17:23] start mending some of the tissue and
[1:17:24] things and whatever that's broke down. I
[1:17:26] want you to think about this that the
[1:17:28] word of God is so powerful when you take
[1:17:31] God's word into your life and you just
[1:17:34] receive it. You don't you don't take an
[1:17:35] antibiotic. Now, I know some people read
[1:17:37] on the on the on the prescription bottle
[1:17:39] and they'll read uh may cause drowsiness
[1:17:41] and they're they're thinking they need
[1:17:42] to take a nap and you say, "Wait a
[1:17:44] minute. You ain't even taken it yet." I
[1:17:45] mean, they're already got, you know, the
[1:17:47] couch lined up. But you notice when you
[1:17:49] go to you you just you take that
[1:17:51] medicine, whether you get it from Myers,
[1:17:52] Walgreens, wherever you know, you're
[1:17:54] waiting on it and they finally say,
[1:17:55] "Hey, we got your medicine ready for
[1:17:57] pickup." You go get it and you say,
[1:17:58] "Okay, take with food or take with a
[1:18:00] glass of milk or take with this." You go
[1:18:01] get it and you begin to take it down.
[1:18:03] You do not worry about where that
[1:18:05] medicine is going to go. You You've got
[1:18:07] confidence that the doctor has been able
[1:18:09] to determine, oh, you have an upper
[1:18:11] respiratory. No, Zpack's not going to
[1:18:13] work here, but this is what's going to
[1:18:15] work. Oh, you got a sulfa allergy. Okay,
[1:18:17] this is what's going to take place.
[1:18:18] You've got a confidence in the doctor in
[1:18:20] whom you've told your symptoms that he
[1:18:23] has wrote the prescription. And by the
[1:18:24] way, he's practicing medicine. But our
[1:18:28] God is not practicing. Our God is
[1:18:32] faithful. He every word that he has
[1:18:35] prescribed, he's never changed the
[1:18:37] prescription. If you'll just take that
[1:18:40] word in and look at what the word, the
[1:18:42] writing upon the bottle said it would
[1:18:45] do, it will fulfill it in your life.
[1:18:48] Just take it as he said take it and say,
[1:18:51] "I believe it, Lord. I accept that,
[1:18:53] Lord." And watch the medicine go to work
[1:18:57] in your life.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Why? cuz it cannot return back to him
[1:19:02] void.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory be to God.
[1:19:07] Hallelujah. I don't think I read verse
[1:19:08] two yet. By whom also we have access.
[1:19:13] Thank you, Lord. By faith into this
[1:19:17] grace wherein we stand and rejoice in
[1:19:22] hope of the glory of the Lord. And not
[1:19:25] only so, but we glory in tribulations
[1:19:29] also,
[1:19:31] knowing that tribulation workketh
[1:19:33] patience, and patience experience, and
[1:19:37] experience hope, and hope maketh not
[1:19:41] ashamed. My expectation
[1:19:45] when someone gives a testimony, I
[1:19:47] believe that the Lord has healed me.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:51] Maybe they maybe the way that they have
[1:19:53] to go through something, maybe it's a
[1:19:54] surgery, it's still God's healing.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; If they even if they here, they can
[1:20:00] testify it's in their hearts that you
[1:20:02] know what, God has healed me. The Lord's
[1:20:04] my healer. And they're standing up on
[1:20:05] that. Maybe they go by the way of the
[1:20:07] grave. But listen, their expectation is
[1:20:10] not ashamed. If they can if they would
[1:20:13] be clear at the very last moments of
[1:20:15] their life, there was be no recanting.
[1:20:18] there would be no remorse. It would be
[1:20:21] that same testimony because whether
[1:20:23] healing is in this side or healing on
[1:20:26] the next side, the grace of God that has
[1:20:29] been provided for you and I to move from
[1:20:31] this realm into that realm, God's grace
[1:20:34] is sufficient. And the love of God that
[1:20:37] came and brought us and drew us unto
[1:20:39] him, he said like David, the yay, though
[1:20:42] I walk through the valley of the shadow
[1:20:44] of death, I will fear no evil. And the
[1:20:47] prophet said, "The only way there could
[1:20:48] be a shadow is because there's a light
[1:20:51] that has come into that valley." Our
[1:20:53] lives were filled with darkness. But
[1:20:55] God, rich in mercy, stepped down in our
[1:20:59] valley, and he is leading us out of that
[1:21:01] valley. The same way he leads a soul
[1:21:04] across to the other side.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; He's faithful.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Hope maketh not ashamed because the love
[1:21:10] of God is shed abroad in our hearts. It
[1:21:14] just it's ever expanding.
[1:21:17] It's ever expanding. You say, "Brother
[1:21:18] Samuel, how does the love of God expand
[1:21:20] in our hearts?" Right here. Through
[1:21:22] tribulations.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Through tribulations, the love of God,
[1:21:27] it expands,
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; It becomes greater.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; It becomes more sure.
[1:21:35] Look, there's things right now that you
[1:21:36] have that God has brought you through
[1:21:38] even in the past month,
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; the past year that you knew would have
[1:21:43] never even thought about,
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; But God has brought you through. I want
[1:21:49] to ask you, what brought you through?
[1:21:51] What brought you through? What brought
[1:21:52] me through when we would feel like
[1:21:54] throwing up our hands? What is it
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; that would bring us through? What is it
[1:21:58] that would direct us and turn us back
[1:22:00] around? I'll tell you what it is. It's a
[1:22:02] love of God.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a love of God. You can't get
[1:22:06] away from the love of God.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; The love of God is shed abroad in your
[1:22:11] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[1:22:13] unto us. Here it is. Second
[1:22:15] Thessalonians chapter 3. We have
[1:22:17] confidence in the Lord touching you that
[1:22:19] ye both do and will do the things which
[1:22:22] which we command you. And the Lord,
[1:22:25] sorry, direct your hearts into the love
[1:22:29] of God and into the patient waiting for
[1:22:33] Christ.
[1:22:35] I love that.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Who's going to direct my heart? When
[1:22:39] when my heart, like David said, is
[1:22:40] overwhelmed, what did he say? Lead me to
[1:22:43] the rock
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; that is higher than high.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, direct my heart.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Direct my heart, Lord. I want to just
[1:22:51] say that even tonight. Lord, direct my
[1:22:53] heart. Lord,
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; direct my heart into what? Into the love
[1:22:57] of God, bring moving deeper there into
[1:23:00] the love of God. when situations arise.
[1:23:02] I I don't know about you, but as I look
[1:23:04] at this scripture and ponder on it, all
[1:23:06] I can think of is is is a ship or
[1:23:09] something that would be so tattered and
[1:23:11] oh, in the midst of the storm. But to
[1:23:13] know that there's a place, a safety, a
[1:23:16] safe harbor, there's a refuge, there's a
[1:23:18] place that God in his grace can direct
[1:23:21] us into. I like how the songwriter says
[1:23:24] it. He said, "Sometimes the times he
[1:23:27] calms the storm and other times he just
[1:23:30] calms me."
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; The Lord direct your hearts into the
[1:23:36] love of God and into the patient waiting
[1:23:38] for Christ.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; It might be a doctor's report. It might
[1:23:42] be a job. It might be a situation. And
[1:23:45] the God in his grace will direct your
[1:23:47] heart right into the love of God and the
[1:23:51] patient waiting. Lord, as David said,
[1:23:54] and I'm a testament, I've never seen the
[1:23:56] righteous, forsaken.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Never seen one of his children, the
[1:24:00] righteous, ever begging for bread.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; I've never seen that. You say, "Brother
[1:24:04] Sam, why why would you quote that?" Cuz
[1:24:06] those are my promises. Those are your
[1:24:08] promises. This is God's word. Listen,
[1:24:11] God knew that you and I would have need
[1:24:13] of this even in the time that we're
[1:24:15] living. And God has made this word so
[1:24:17] real and so sure to where you and I,
[1:24:19] we're not just New Testament Christians.
[1:24:22] We are Biblebelieving Christians all the
[1:24:25] way from the Old to the New. Cuz we
[1:24:27] realize that Jesus of the New is Jehovah
[1:24:31] of the Old. And to know that he's the
[1:24:33] same almighty God that condescended,
[1:24:35] came down, became one of us, and is now
[1:24:38] dwelling in us and leading us and
[1:24:40] guiding us.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for that?
[1:24:44] Oh God, I wonder how many times even as
[1:24:47] a family we could even get around your
[1:24:49] children, different ones, somebody going
[1:24:51] through something, just just take them
[1:24:53] by the hand and say, "Let's let's just
[1:24:55] let's just go to God. Let's just go to
[1:24:57] the Lord in prayer." Why? He's our
[1:24:59] strong and mighty tower. He's our place
[1:25:03] of refuge. He's a place that I can let
[1:25:06] off the pressure. He's a poised one that
[1:25:09] is right there. He's not a long distance
[1:25:11] call. He said, "I'd be right there with
[1:25:13] you." He said, "Ask the Father anything
[1:25:15] in my name and I will do it." He's right
[1:25:18] there. He said, "I'll be with you even
[1:25:20] in you to the end of the age. Though I
[1:25:22] may not feel it, he's faithful to his
[1:25:25] word. And his word is greater than my
[1:25:28] feelings
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; or the circumstance I might find myself
[1:25:31] in."
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:35] Oh my. as Abraham's seed. Think of it in
[1:25:39] Hebrews 6:13. For when God made promise
[1:25:43] to Abraham, because he could swear by no
[1:25:45] greater, he swear by himself, saying,
[1:25:48] "Surely blessing I will bless thee, and
[1:25:51] multiplying I will multiply thee." And
[1:25:53] so, after he had patiently endured, he
[1:25:57] obtained the promise.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Abraham had to press beyond his own
[1:26:02] thoughts. Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; God gave him strength to press through
[1:26:06] all the unbelief. God gave him strength
[1:26:10] to where he could look in the mirror and
[1:26:12] his his back was more crooked the next
[1:26:14] day than it was the day before. But God
[1:26:17] gave him grace to look beyond what he
[1:26:19] was seeing in the mirror and to take
[1:26:21] what God had already said about him.
[1:26:23] Come on, Abraham seed. You need to look
[1:26:25] beyond just what you in your thoughts
[1:26:27] and oh this is how I am. You don't
[1:26:30] understand. No, God understands. And God
[1:26:32] don't waste words, friends. What God has
[1:26:35] said concerning you, that's what he
[1:26:37] means. He is the amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said that, oh, what a
[1:26:44] blessing it is for those who will bless
[1:26:47] themselves in the God of truth. To bless
[1:26:50] yourself in the God of the amen. How do
[1:26:53] I bless myself in the God of the amen?
[1:26:55] By accepting what he said with an amen.
[1:26:59] So be it. Regardless of my feelings,
[1:27:02] regardless of my thought, I'm blessing
[1:27:04] myself in the God of the Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:10] Glory be to God in the highest. For men
[1:27:13] verilely swear by the greater, and an
[1:27:14] oath for confirmation is to them an end
[1:27:17] of all strife, wherein God willingly,
[1:27:20] more abundantly to show unto the heirs.
[1:27:22] Aren't you glad for that? The heirs of
[1:27:24] the promise the immutability of his
[1:27:26] counsel confirmed it by an oath. No. So
[1:27:28] he already gave his word, but now he
[1:27:31] steps to make an oath regarding his
[1:27:33] word. He's making it double sure.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Double sure.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the day of the
[1:27:41] double portion.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the day where Job
[1:27:46] had restored devil unto him. Yeah.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. We're We're living in that day
[1:27:53] of the devil where God that has spoke
[1:27:56] his word fulfilling that word.
[1:28:00] Don't you love him?
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; I just want to say thank you Lord.
[1:28:05] Thank you, Lord,
[1:28:07] that by two immunable things in which it
[1:28:09] was impossible for God to lie, we might
[1:28:12] have a strong consolation, a great
[1:28:14] comfort, who have fled for refuge to lay
[1:28:17] hold upon the hope set before us. Which
[1:28:20] hope, which expectation we have as an
[1:28:23] anchor of the soul, both sure and
[1:28:27] steadfast, and which enterth into that
[1:28:31] within the veil. Brother Samuel, I I
[1:28:33] don't see it all yet, but you've already
[1:28:36] there's an anchor that's already entered
[1:28:38] into the veil. You are already connected
[1:28:41] in the veil.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The coming of the Holy
[1:28:46] Spirit is the abstract to the title D.
[1:28:48] What does the Holy Spirit do to you? It
[1:28:50] brings you back into heavenly places,
[1:28:54] your rightful position in Jesus Christ.
[1:28:58] And it's like that little person had
[1:29:00] that that that remember that kite
[1:29:01] brother Ram talks about cloudy day.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; How many ever had them cloudy days?
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cloudy days. Here she was. She
[1:29:08] just had that little that little cow.
[1:29:09] Little kite here. A man came by there
[1:29:11] and looked at it. So what what you got
[1:29:14] on the other end of that stream? She
[1:29:15] said a kite. He don't see it. She said
[1:29:20] that's what I got. Well, I don't see it.
[1:29:23] Oh. She said it's up there. She said,
[1:29:25] "Because every once in a while, I feel a
[1:29:27] little tug."
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you feel that tug,
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; brother? That tug that came around and
[1:29:35] begin to tug on your life. It didn't
[1:29:37] leave you a Catholic. It didn't leave
[1:29:38] you a Baptist. It didn't leave you a
[1:29:40] Pentecostal. It didn't just leave you
[1:29:42] around a message in a church. It's
[1:29:44] pulling you. What is it? It is that
[1:29:47] perfection that is calling you back to
[1:29:50] perfection. It's God, his word that he's
[1:29:54] making known that he's bringing you back
[1:29:56] to himself.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; And through that,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; he's bringing you back to yourself.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; He's breaking amnesia around your life
[1:30:07] and my life.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Even in situations, maybe maybe there's
[1:30:11] a spiral that comes up in your life. But
[1:30:14] God's grace is sufficient.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; To break the amnesia.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; He did it. He did it before and he
[1:30:20] brought you to where you are now. He's
[1:30:22] the same God that no matter the
[1:30:24] situation that can bring you right back
[1:30:27] to who he's revealed you really are.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whether the forerunner is
[1:30:33] for us entered sure and steadfast within
[1:30:36] the veil, even Jesus made an high priest
[1:30:38] after the order of Melzdc. I want to
[1:30:41] just say it like this. The Bible tells
[1:30:42] us in Hebrews chapter 1 that he in verse
[1:30:46] three if you don't mind let me just go
[1:30:48] to there. It said who being the
[1:30:50] brightness of his glory and the express
[1:30:52] image of his person and upholding all
[1:30:56] things by the word of his power. And
[1:31:00] when he had by himself purged our sins,
[1:31:03] he sat down on the right hand of the
[1:31:05] majesty on high. It's finished. Yes.
[1:31:08] Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, no matter what
[1:31:11] situation came, even down through the
[1:31:13] Old Testament, even when the fall came
[1:31:16] in the garden, it could not stop the
[1:31:19] word.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, every situation
[1:31:23] where the enemy has wanted to ensnare
[1:31:25] God's children and put a trap and say,
[1:31:28] "I got them here. I got them here." God
[1:31:31] himself has moved down within those
[1:31:34] times to reveal another one of his great
[1:31:39] compound redemptive names. He has made
[1:31:43] himself known that I'm your peace. That
[1:31:46] I'm your banner. I'm your shepherd. I'm
[1:31:48] your healer. I'm your righteousness. He
[1:31:51] has moved down time and time again. So
[1:31:53] God does not run when adversity comes to
[1:31:57] your life.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Boy, if I could run right now, I
[1:32:00] would. He don't run when adversity comes
[1:32:04] to your life. As a matter of fact, he
[1:32:07] will hold the angels back and say, "I'm
[1:32:10] going down myself."
[1:32:12] He came down in the fiery furnace.
[1:32:15] Wormwood wanted to flood it out. He
[1:32:17] said, "No,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; I've got an appointment in the midst of
[1:32:21] this trial, in the midst of this time.
[1:32:23] I've got an appointment in the midst of
[1:32:26] Lady Oia with my bride
[1:32:31] where there's all sorts of things
[1:32:32] wanting to bind her hands and tie her up
[1:32:35] and lay her down. But I've got an
[1:32:37] appointment to walk in the midst of the
[1:32:40] fire.
[1:32:41] [Applause]
[1:32:43] They didn't know about the appointment,
[1:32:45] but I knew about the appointment
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; and allowed them to declare their
[1:32:50] faithfulness in the midst and stand
[1:32:52] there and say, "I don't know what's
[1:32:54] going to take place, but I know one
[1:32:56] thing. We're not bowing, and our God
[1:32:59] will deliver us out of your hand."
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; However he chooses, but he's still the
[1:33:04] deliverer.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:10] Incredible how those who threw them in
[1:33:12] burned up. And yet God allowed the king
[1:33:15] to be able to look in and say, "Wait a
[1:33:17] minute. How many did you throw in? We
[1:33:19] only threw in three, but I see four down
[1:33:21] there. And that one is like unto the son
[1:33:24] of man." The son of God walking in the
[1:33:27] midst of the flame of fire. See, God
[1:33:29] allowed the testimony of that king to
[1:33:32] witness who was in the midst of that
[1:33:34] situation.
[1:33:37] You think your testimony and your life
[1:33:39] that's being lived on a daily basis when
[1:33:42] at times you maybe don't feel so
[1:33:43] spiritual. You don't feel so up in the
[1:33:46] air. But let me tell you something.
[1:33:48] There is in the middle of this watch, in
[1:33:51] the middle of the timing of your life is
[1:33:53] a mainspring that keeps time. And it's
[1:33:56] your life that's ticking out that's
[1:33:58] causing others to look and say there's
[1:34:00] something on the inside that's greater
[1:34:03] than them. It's something that's keeping
[1:34:06] time and rhythm with the word. Jesus
[1:34:09] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:34:11] forever.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; No wonder David would say, "Uphold me,
[1:34:17] Lord,
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; unto thy word that I may live. Hold me
[1:34:22] according to thy word." Sorry. "Uphold
[1:34:24] me according to thy word that I may
[1:34:25] live. And let me not be ashamed of my
[1:34:28] hope. Hold thou me up and I shall be
[1:34:32] saved.
[1:34:33] I will have respect unto thy statutes
[1:34:37] continually.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, get ready. Hebrews 10
[1:34:46] verse 12. I want you to I want you to
[1:34:49] watch this. I'm going to have him play
[1:34:51] just about nine minutes of a tape. I I I
[1:34:54] could have read it, but it better. I
[1:34:56] just want Brother Ram to say it. I want
[1:34:57] you He's gonna put it up here, but I
[1:34:59] want you to follow along with it.
[1:35:01] Just let me read this and then I'm going
[1:35:02] to have brother Brian play. Just nine
[1:35:03] minutes. But this man after he had
[1:35:07] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; sat down on the right hand of God from
[1:35:15] henceforth
[1:35:16] expecting till his enemies
[1:35:20] be made his foottool.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram's going to come on here. Go
[1:35:25] ahead and get it up, Brother Brian. He's
[1:35:27] going to come right on here within this
[1:35:28] and say he's waiting for you at the end.
[1:35:32] He sent the Holy Ghost to bring you all
[1:35:35] the way through this journey. Everybody
[1:35:37] see that? Okay, we tried to make it as
[1:35:39] big as we could. I'll get my head out of
[1:35:41] the way.
[1:35:46] Would it help if I turn this off these
[1:35:48] lights? Would that help y'all? You say,
[1:35:51] "I don't know." Does that help?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Really realize what you're doing. May
[1:35:58] God be merciful to me. The blood of
[1:36:00] Jesus is on your hands. Don't you go out
[1:36:03] and start living the same life that you
[1:36:05] did. That blood will condemn you at the
[1:36:07] end of the judgment.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; You better have the life that's in that
[1:36:11] blood to return to your life's blood.
[1:36:13] Return to your heart and make you live a
[1:36:15] different Christ, a different person.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; The worshipper once purged. Watch here.
[1:36:22] But this man after he had offered one
[1:36:27] sacrifice for sin
[1:36:30] for how long?
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Ever.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; That shameless eternity. Forever sat
[1:36:38] down at the right hand of God at the end
[1:36:41] of the road.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Where's he at? At the end of the road.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; You remember Sunday before last?
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the Sunday I preached and
[1:36:51] illustrated the little ark of Moses that
[1:36:55] was going down to the bull rushes and
[1:36:57] everything. You remember how the you old
[1:37:00] people got the crying and shouting when
[1:37:02] I was preaching to the children had all
[1:37:04] them little black and blue eyes sitting
[1:37:05] up here on the front row. Tell them if
[1:37:08] you lose your life you'll find it. If
[1:37:11] you keep your life you'll lose it. You
[1:37:13] remember that church?
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember when I was in
[1:37:17] illustration gave the illustration of
[1:37:20] that morning when Jehawk and when Amra
[1:37:24] Aaron and Miam all down before daylight
[1:37:28] with their hands up in the air saying
[1:37:29] God you gave us the baby. Now we're
[1:37:32] giving it back to you. You give it to
[1:37:35] us. It wasn't ours. It was yours. You
[1:37:38] give it to us and now we give it back to
[1:37:41] you.
[1:37:43] We keep it. The witches of hell will
[1:37:45] kill it. Them old long hooked old women
[1:37:48] come out there, take her little head and
[1:37:49] bust it against the wall, we'll lose it
[1:37:51] if we keep it. But if we give it back to
[1:37:54] the one who gave it to us,
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; we'll keep it.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing in your little
[1:38:00] bark this morning, brother, sister.
[1:38:02] You've got a cargo in there, the
[1:38:04] precious cargo of the world.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; It's called your soul.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, keep it. Live the way you want
[1:38:11] to. You'll lose it as certain as I'm
[1:38:13] standing here.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And if you give it back to God and
[1:38:16] surrender your will, you'll keep it.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; You'll find it. Jesus said so.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Remember, and when they pushed this the
[1:38:23] treasure of their heart, when they
[1:38:25] pushed it out into the river, oh
[1:38:27] crocodiles coming up, I could see God, I
[1:38:31] said, raised from his throne.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a lot of trials goes
[1:38:38] on down here.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] But there's somebody looking at him all
[1:38:41] the time.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; They love not their life unto death.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; One poor Abraham with his only beloved
[1:38:48] little child, little chihahaki pet just
[1:38:50] nursed it to her bosom and then had to
[1:38:52] put in the ark and push it out into the
[1:38:54] bull rushes where the alligators were
[1:38:56] packed. All little babies there when she
[1:39:00] was standing there in the tears running
[1:39:01] laying down her cheeks. God said, "Come
[1:39:03] here, Gabriel. Come here.
[1:39:06] Want to show you something.
[1:39:09] I got somebody that really believes me.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; God, let me be that type of person that
[1:39:16] can say God said so. It's right
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; and be so dead to anything else. Comes a
[1:39:23] pound and brass or tingling.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Come here, Dave. All you angels come out
[1:39:28] here.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something. See that
[1:39:31] man down there, his hands up,
[1:39:34] pushed his own baby out.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; I gave it to him. has given it back.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; I see that he keeps it.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Gabriel
[1:39:45] called 10,000 angels on marching orders.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; I want them out here. Gabriel sounded a
[1:39:52] little trumpet across the quarters of
[1:39:54] eternity. 10,000 armed angels walked
[1:39:58] down say yourself up and down the river.
[1:40:03] See, there's no alligator. Nothing else
[1:40:04] going to touch one of that.
[1:40:07] It was give back to me.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Gabriel said, "Lord,
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; glory,
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; chief captain, where are you going to
[1:40:13] be?" I'm going to be at the end of the
[1:40:14] line.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to receive down there. That's
[1:40:19] the same thing he does today. When a man
[1:40:22] puts his trust in the Lord, Jesus,
[1:40:24] confesses his sins, the Holy Ghost takes
[1:40:27] a hold of that man and Christ stands at
[1:40:29] the receiving end.
[1:40:32] So through many world pools and
[1:40:34] alligators and scary spooks and
[1:40:36] everything else we come through through
[1:40:38] many dangers
[1:40:41] I have already come.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; It's grace that's brought me safe thus
[1:40:45] far. It's grace that'll take me all.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Who's at the receiving end? Listen.
[1:40:53] forever sat down at the right hand of
[1:40:55] God from henceforth up down at the end
[1:40:58] of the road expecting
[1:41:01] till his enemies be made his foottool.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Here it is. Here's the last turn on the
[1:41:09] bolt.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Here's the last spot with the torch.
[1:41:14] Here's the last drive of the nail.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; This is the one who clinches eternity to
[1:41:20] eternity. And in there, the sword of
[1:41:24] God's deliverance went through the heart
[1:41:26] and hanging up his delegation
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; to the Holy Spirit. Here it is. Hebrews
[1:41:34] 10:14. Listen.
[1:41:36] Not my word, but God's word who spoke it
[1:41:39] before the foundation of the world. It
[1:41:41] has to be so.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; For by one offering,
[1:41:47] he has ped.
[1:41:51] Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Perfected forever them that are
[1:41:55] sanctified.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Look at it. Look at it.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Perfected. How long?
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Till the next time you get on a
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; with your neighbor. Till the next time
[1:42:07] you see somebody, some man or woman are
[1:42:10] lustful. Until the next time you see a
[1:42:13] chance to tell a big lie. until the next
[1:42:15] time you see where you can net someone
[1:42:18] and hurt them and drive them away from
[1:42:19] church. So sometime you can criticize
[1:42:22] somebody.
[1:42:24] He has sanctified
[1:42:26] forever
[1:42:28] forever for the Holy Ghost. You might
[1:42:31] say something sometimes wrong. That's
[1:42:32] right. You might do something sometimes
[1:42:34] wrong. That's right. But as soon as you
[1:42:36] do it, watch the next verse.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; What the Holy Ghost?
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:45] Oh my I just can't preach anymore.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Look, the Holy Ghost is a witness to us.
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a witness.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. to us after that he has
[1:43:03] said before this is the covenant what I
[1:43:08] will make with them in those days sayith
[1:43:10] the Lord I'll put my law in their heart
[1:43:14] and in their minds will I write them and
[1:43:17] their sins and their iniquity will I
[1:43:19] remember no more praise God
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; oh God
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; every man that has this hope purifies
[1:43:28] himself God is puremen Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Our heavenly father,
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; we thank thee this morning for the
[1:43:36] purging of the Holy Ghost, for the grace
[1:43:40] of the living God.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; We were sinners, unrighteous, ungodly,
[1:43:46] unlovable.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Without God, without hope, alienated in
[1:43:52] the world.
[1:43:53] And Christ come and tuck our place by
[1:43:56] fornowledge. God saw us in this
[1:43:58] condition knowing that we were hungering
[1:44:01] and thirsting. No wonder Jesus said they
[1:44:03] shall be filled
[1:44:07] not become members. Not they shall join
[1:44:11] but they shall be filled.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Hungering and thirsting for our
[1:44:17] righteousness. In other words, hungering
[1:44:19] and thirsting
[1:44:21] knowing that we can do nothing in
[1:44:22] ourselves no matter what we do. The
[1:44:25] devil could make us impersonate every
[1:44:27] gift.
[1:44:29] Could make us go out and lay hands on
[1:44:31] the sick and they had recovered. Could
[1:44:34] make us speak with tongues. Could make
[1:44:35] us interpret tongues. To make us have
[1:44:38] wisdom, knowledge. But that doesn't take
[1:44:40] it. Lord, you said many will come in
[1:44:43] that day and say, "Lord, Lord, have not
[1:44:44] I done these things in your name?" He
[1:44:46] said, "Depart from me, you workers of
[1:44:48] iniquity. I never even knew you,
[1:44:52] oh God. Then let our hopes be built on
[1:44:56] nothing less than Jesus blood with
[1:44:59] righteousness.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; For all around our soul gives way and
[1:45:03] he's all our hope and stay. For on
[1:45:05] Christ the solid rock I stand. All other
[1:45:08] grounds is sinking sand.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; To know him is life.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Yes Jesus.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Not to know the orders. Amen.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; To know him the person.
[1:45:19] I pray father for every sinner in the
[1:45:21] building today that you'll save them
[1:45:25] just now and may they without any
[1:45:28] emotion without any contradictions
[1:45:32] from the devil but may they with a true
[1:45:36] unadulterated faith believe what they've
[1:45:40] heard preached and accept
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit who brought it
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; grant it Lord
[1:45:48] or in his name we asked him.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; And with our heads bowed,
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; I wonder if there's someone here this
[1:45:54] morning now. I want your level, honest,
[1:45:58] truthful.
[1:46:01] No matter what you've done,
[1:46:06] no matter how many starts you've made or
[1:46:08] how long you've gone to church,
[1:46:12] are you sincere from the depths of your
[1:46:14] heart of this that knows that the things
[1:46:17] of the world has passed from you
[1:46:21] to know that day after day and year
[1:46:23] after year,
[1:46:26] it continues on. your anchor holes. May
[1:46:29] somebody honor foreshadowed at the end
[1:46:31] of the road where this great kink will
[1:46:33] be drawn out. There's somebody there
[1:46:34] tugging at your heart knowing that
[1:46:36] someday you'll be lifted up.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; If that's not gone from your heart
[1:46:41] today, friend, it
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; fellow citizens,
[1:46:45] pilgrim.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love him?
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:57] so much in it. I don't worry, I'll send
[1:46:58] you all the audio clip of it, but
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; one part of it that just all of it stood
[1:47:04] out. But he's he's waiting at the end.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; But he's right here with us the whole
[1:47:10] way
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; to bring us all the way home.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I love how brother Brandon
[1:47:16] when he says that he says
[1:47:19] when the Holy Ghost he said takes a hold
[1:47:22] of that man and Christ stands at the end
[1:47:26] at the receiving end. He'll go through
[1:47:28] many whirlpools.
[1:47:32] Everybody been through a whirlpool.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Not talking about a washer either.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; A whirlpool.
[1:47:38] And in a whirlpool you're just you're
[1:47:39] spinning trying to get your bearings
[1:47:41] right? Notice this is what the prophet
[1:47:43] said. He'll go through many whirlpools
[1:47:45] like Moses in that little ark,
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; alligators and scary spooks and
[1:47:51] everything else that we've come through.
[1:47:55] Even things as brother Brandon went
[1:47:57] through within all that. How long are we
[1:47:59] perfected until the next time we make a
[1:48:03] boo boo? Until the next time. He went
[1:48:05] through a whole whole litany on that
[1:48:06] quote. I'm not going to read back over
[1:48:08] that. He went through a whole thing. How
[1:48:09] how long? We're perfected
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; forever.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Right. When he when he did the work of
[1:48:15] redemption,
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; he's not standing up. He sat down.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, he's at the
[1:48:24] receiving end. He has confidence in his
[1:48:28] word.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; And if you can receive it, it's him in
[1:48:33] you believing his own word.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. the
[1:48:41] unfailing love of God.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; I believe tonight, I believe the Holy
[1:48:49] Spirit has pointed that out. Musicians
[1:48:51] come. I believe tonight that if we can
[1:48:53] take that like brother Brand was
[1:48:54] bringing that out just to accept it,
[1:48:56] Lord, in the way that the word was
[1:48:58] brought and preached tonight,
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; he said, "Lord, I accept it." He said,
[1:49:02] "The Holy Spirit move right into that
[1:49:04] right there." I believe right here
[1:49:06] tonight, the Holy Spirit, I know he's
[1:49:07] here.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; I know God's here. Just just accept it.
[1:49:11] Accept it. Don't reason with it. Just
[1:49:13] take it in.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; It's mine.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that?
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Let's just go to him
[1:49:21] in a word of prayer. If you'd like to
[1:49:22] stand, God bless you tonight.
[1:49:26] Amen.
[1:49:29] I know we have many, no doubt, many
[1:49:30] different needs. We
[1:49:34] spiritual needs. We got physical needs,
[1:49:36] emotional.
[1:49:39] Whatever your need is tonight, I want
[1:49:42] you to know that God cares. He cares
[1:49:44] about your need because he cares about
[1:49:47] you. He loves you. He cares about you.
[1:49:52] Safest place you can stand is on his
[1:49:55] word.
[1:50:02] Lord Jesus,
[1:50:06] thank you, Father,
[1:50:10] for your grace to us once again this
[1:50:12] evening.
[1:50:15] Thank you, Father, for
[1:50:18] just taking us through, Lord,
[1:50:22] these places, Lord,
[1:50:25] in your word,
[1:50:28] Lord. How how rich and how precious.
[1:50:33] What a comfort Lord.
[1:50:35] What a strength. What a refreshing
[1:50:39] and what an objective Lord.
[1:50:43] What a consolation that it is that
[1:50:46] Lord that each one if there's one that
[1:50:50] doesn't have have that Lord God love of
[1:50:54] God there in the depths of their heart
[1:50:56] but yet they know that it's your love
[1:50:58] that has been dealing with their lives
[1:51:01] the whole time
[1:51:03] working with them. You've been patient,
[1:51:07] but father is just even in this moment
[1:51:10] is just to Lord lay lay aside the
[1:51:14] filtering
[1:51:16] of their own thinking and just take the
[1:51:19] word the pure word
[1:51:21] just to take it in and say amen Lord so
[1:51:26] be it in my life
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Lord maybe it's a a need Lord for
[1:51:32] deliverance maybe it's a need Lord for a
[1:51:35] besetting sin, a weight. Maybe it's a
[1:51:38] need, Lord, for healing.
[1:51:41] But right here tonight,
[1:51:44] Lord God, we want to accept
[1:51:47] your word and say, "Amen."
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord Jesus, to lay aside every
[1:51:56] thought,
[1:51:58] Lord God, every
[1:52:01] every thought, Lord, that we could have
[1:52:03] regarding ourselves. But you're not
[1:52:05] you're not speaking to us, Lord, based
[1:52:07] on
[1:52:09] of where we are here just upon earthly
[1:52:11] things. When you spoke to Job, you never
[1:52:14] mentioned one thing about the earth
[1:52:19] where he was standing.
[1:52:21] You never mentioned one thing about what
[1:52:25] was going on, but rather you took him
[1:52:28] back. Where
[1:52:31] were you
[1:52:33] when I laid the foundations of the world
[1:52:37] before that? When the sons of God
[1:52:40] shouted for joy, where were you, Job?
[1:52:43] Lord,
[1:52:46] maybe Lord, one of your children's in a
[1:52:47] whirlpool right now.
[1:52:50] Maybe there's a current
[1:52:53] maybe wanting to pull them like a rip
[1:52:54] current that we've been reading about
[1:52:56] seeing all this going on on our lake out
[1:52:58] here. Just had three people this past
[1:53:02] weekend. Lord, two young men there at
[1:53:03] Huntington Beach. The gentleman over
[1:53:06] there at Edgewater Pier fell off. Rip
[1:53:09] currents. They're giving announcements
[1:53:11] over. We see them come across our phone.
[1:53:13] Beach hazards.
[1:53:16] Lord God, a current that would pull
[1:53:18] somebody under. Lord, I pray right here
[1:53:22] tonight, Father.
[1:53:24] Lord God,
[1:53:26] I see, Lord, where they'll actually give
[1:53:28] like videos and demonstrations
[1:53:31] and they tell them, "Don't try to fight
[1:53:33] that current. Just go to one side."
[1:53:37] Lord, right here tonight,
[1:53:40] we want to side with the word.
[1:53:42] And Lord God, if there's any current
[1:53:44] Lord that Father underneath, if it's
[1:53:46] torment, Lord God, if there's any
[1:53:49] unsettling Lord, underneath, Lord, that
[1:53:51] would be trying to pull or hinder, Lord,
[1:53:54] oh God, any voice, Lord, of the accuser,
[1:53:56] Lord, oh Father, I pray tonight, may the
[1:53:59] great peace of Almighty God, may the God
[1:54:03] of peace, may you step forward, Lord.
[1:54:06] May you lead your children, Lord, lead
[1:54:08] them out, Father. I pray God of any rip
[1:54:11] current Lord of unbelief Lord, any rip
[1:54:14] current of doubt, Lord, any whirlpool,
[1:54:16] Lord God, where, Father, they're trying
[1:54:18] to find their bearings, Lord, and it
[1:54:20] just seems like it's spinning around and
[1:54:22] around. Maybe they're not in in a
[1:54:24] whirlpool, but maybe, Lord God, it's an
[1:54:27] alligator that Lord has approached this
[1:54:30] ark that they are sealed within with
[1:54:33] that pitch. And Lord God, like the enemy
[1:54:35] wanting to try to tantalize at that
[1:54:38] seal, wanting to try to tease at it and
[1:54:40] poke at it. Oh God, I pray right here
[1:54:42] tonight, Father, like your prophet said
[1:54:45] that the angels of God were right there
[1:54:47] over that ark and every time one of
[1:54:49] those alligators or crocodiles would
[1:54:51] come up around it, he said in another
[1:54:53] place, one of the angels would push its
[1:54:56] push its head back underwater with its
[1:54:59] foot because you've got angels all the
[1:55:01] way up and down this river of life. Lord
[1:55:05] God, they are stationed just like the
[1:55:07] prophet walking from that balcony, Lord,
[1:55:10] in that Houston coliseum when he spoke
[1:55:12] about there being over 500 ushers. And
[1:55:15] they later interviewed Sister Mey, she
[1:55:18] said there wasn't even close to that
[1:55:20] whatsoever of that many ushers. But what
[1:55:23] it was is the prophet was seeing in
[1:55:26] another realm. It was the angels of God
[1:55:29] that had lined the aisle as he walked
[1:55:31] from the balcony up there, Lord, to that
[1:55:34] place. Oh God, if Father, you were so
[1:55:37] mindful of your word, Lord, to prove it,
[1:55:40] Lord, and you wanted to have your
[1:55:42] picture taken with us, Lord, then how
[1:55:44] much more, dear God, have you not allow
[1:55:47] aligned the angels, Lord, right along,
[1:55:50] Father, the way all the way back home.
[1:55:52] As a matter of fact, on this ladder
[1:55:55] called Jacob's ladder, the fulfillment
[1:55:57] of the word, our Messiah, there are
[1:56:00] angels ascending and descending upon
[1:56:04] this ladder as we're on our way back
[1:56:07] home.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; It's not just one angels,
[1:56:11] not just five.
[1:56:13] It's innumerable.
[1:56:16] Innumerable.
[1:56:18] We're on our way home.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:22] Lord, I pray right here tonight.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; May you grant the request in every life,
[1:56:29] hearts that Lord would say, I want the
[1:56:31] love of God in my heart in the very
[1:56:34] depths of my life to root out everything
[1:56:36] that's unlike God. I want that
[1:56:38] solidness, shity, and that settleness,
[1:56:41] that rest in my life. Lord, that's what
[1:56:44] I want.
[1:56:46] Maybe you would be one to say, Lord, I
[1:56:49] want that. Lord God, make it so clear.
[1:56:52] Make it so real to me, Lord. Would you
[1:56:55] just Lord God, just make that real,
[1:56:57] Lord, that in my heart, in my life, that
[1:57:00] settleness, Lord.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Oh God, grant it right here tonight,
[1:57:05] Lord, I pray, Lord, those that are sick
[1:57:08] in their body, Lord. Maybe they've got a
[1:57:11] condition. Maybe they've received a
[1:57:13] report. Maybe something that's come.
[1:57:15] Lord God, Father, that Lord would be
[1:57:18] like a whirlpool and they don't know how
[1:57:20] to get out of it.
[1:57:22] But Father,
[1:57:25] you're at the end to receive us. And the
[1:57:28] Holy Spirit is right here with us.
[1:57:32] You
[1:57:33] are seeing us through every test, every
[1:57:39] trial. Your word
[1:57:42] will not return to you void.
[1:57:45] It cannot be defeated.
[1:57:48] You can be defeated.
[1:57:50] Grant it, Lord, I pray.
[1:57:53] Lord God, may you push every head of
[1:57:55] every alligator,
[1:57:57] every opposing spirit, Lord God. Father,
[1:58:00] that which would want to steal and try
[1:58:02] to consume the joy of my brother, my
[1:58:05] sister, that Lord God, that would want
[1:58:08] to try to take away from what you've
[1:58:11] done. Lord God, maybe Lord, it's a
[1:58:13] mistake like the prophet as he gave us
[1:58:15] right there in that message, Lord God.
[1:58:19] something, Lord, that it's been said or
[1:58:21] done. But yet, we can see
[1:58:24] the faithfulness,
[1:58:26] the strength
