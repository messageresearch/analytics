[36:24] there and the Easter seal brother Brent
[36:26] says that the Spirit is what gives us

[36:38] tonight to know of all the things that
[36:40] surrounded us all the political
[36:42] disturbances religious disturbances

[36:46] disturbance
[36:47] we'd be miserable too not to know we've
[36:49] got to go through those things but we've
[36:51] heard of prophets they spread your wings
[36:53] you can fly above a banner we may be in
[36:56] the world but we're not of the world
[36:57] amen we may be surrounded by these
[36:59] things but by the grace of God we're
[37:01] flying tonight are you find in the
[37:03] heights Amen god bless if we could
[37:05] despite our hearts together for a word

[37:45] to afflict and try to oppress throughout
[37:47] the day but Lord there is something only
[37:49] inside of our hearts that no matter our
[37:51] Lord how much oppression would come no
[37:54] matter how much opposition would come we
[37:56] realize we're anointed for this time and
[37:59] we realize that there's no taskmaster
[38:01] there's no spirit of Laodicea they will
[38:03] defeat this bride and Lord as we come
[38:05] here tonight father we do not come to be
[38:07] seen her to be heard but Lord we come to

[38:40] the honor and all the glory for Lord we

[38:43] faith believing that you're the same
[38:46] yesterday today and forever and there is
[38:47] nothing that can withstand the kingdom
[38:49] of God we ask these things in the
[38:51] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[38:53] Jesus Christ we pray and all the

[38:59] evening are you happy to be a Christian
[39:00] are you happy to be saved hey man just
[39:04] give him a hand clap of praise Amen he
[39:06] deserves our praise man he is worthy to
[39:11] be praised if you have your Bible as
[39:13] this evening we'll invite you to the
[39:15] Scriptures the book of Nehemiah the
[39:17] eighth chapter the book of Nehemiah the
[39:19] eighth chapter and while you're turning
[39:20] there we I want to greet you this
[39:22] evening in the name of the Lord we
[39:23] certainly counted an honor and the
[39:26] privilege to be here with you tonight
[39:28] and service and to be able to see
[39:30] everyone out in the house of God we say
[39:32] God bless you and sure appreciate for
[39:34] the same he'll appreciate his friendship
[39:35] and invitation to combine I speak to you
[39:38] this evening and I tell you as time goes
[39:40] on we're learning to value the house of
[39:42] God a whole lot
[39:43] man I think maybe just a few short
[39:45] months ago vacations and everything was
[39:47] always well Church will be there when we
[39:50] get back but we saw a quick drastic
[39:52] change in that I think I think every
[39:54] service that we have is another
[39:56] opportunity a man and I think we ought
[39:58] to take advantage of it a man the book
[40:00] of Nehemiah the eighth chapter we want
[40:03] to look here in the first verse the
[40:05] Bible here says and all the people
[40:09] gathered themselves together is one man
[40:10] into the street that was before the
[40:12] water gate and they spake unto Ezra the
[40:15] scribe to bring the book of the law of
[40:17] Moses which the Lord had commanded
[40:19] Israel and what I like about this is it
[40:22] wasn't them begging Ezra to bring the or
[40:25] Ezra begging them to bring the book but
[40:27] it was them begging Ezra to bring the
[40:29] book and Ezra the priest brought the law
[40:31] before the congregation both of men
[40:33] women all that could hear with that
[40:35] could hear with understanding up on the
[40:37] first day of the seventh month and he
[40:40] read their end before the street that
[40:42] was before the water gate from the
[40:44] morning until midday before the men and
[40:46] the women and those that could
[40:48] understand and the years of all the
[40:50] people were attentive unto the book of
[40:52] the law and Ezra the scribe stood upon a
[40:55] pulpit of wood which they had made for
[40:57] the purpose and beside him stood now I'm
[41:00] not going to attempt those names but if
[41:02] you come to the fifth verse the Bible
[41:04] says and Ezra opened the book in the
[41:07] sight of all the people for the was
[41:09] above all the people and when he opened
[41:11] that all the people stood up so the
[41:13] opening of the book produced a reaction
[41:15] and Ezra bless the Lord the Great God
[41:18] and all the people answered a man a man
[41:21] was lifting up their hands and they
[41:24] bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord
[41:26] with their faces to the ground
[41:27] if you skip down here to the bottom of
[41:30] verse seven all the Levites caused the
[41:33] people to understand the law and the
[41:35] people stood in their places now they
[41:37] read in the book the law of God that
[41:40] distinctly and gave the sense and caused
[41:43] them to understand
[41:45] the reading we asked Lord this evening
[41:48] to add the blessing to the reading of
[41:50] his word as you may have your seats for
[41:52] just a few moments we think the Lord for
[41:54] the reading of the word of God amen it's
[41:56] the Word of God that is true the Word of
[41:58] God is inspired it's infallible amen and
[42:01] I believe that's where we draw our
[42:02] strength from in this hour we're living
[42:04] in a man from those scriptures tonight
[42:06] for just a few moments I'd like to speak
[42:08] to you here and if I will tell this
[42:10] tonight I'd like to speak to you on the
[42:12] strength of the true church the strength
[42:14] of the true church and I believe with
[42:16] all of my heart that we are the true
[42:18] Church of the Living God I believe that
[42:20] we're the chosen elected for ordained
[42:23] for knowledge of God in this hour that
[42:26] we're living in and I believe that we
[42:28] can all agree tonight and it's not going
[42:30] to be nothing deep or nothing maybe to
[42:32] give you a deeper revelation but just
[42:34] something not to strengthen you and
[42:36] encourage you I believe that we need
[42:37] more strength from God a man I believe
[42:40] if there's anything we would desire
[42:41] tonight is more strength from God
[42:43] brother Branham is actually going to
[42:44] pray in two prayers here I just like to
[42:47] read him - you want us from the 3rd
[42:48] Exodus he says Heavenly Father we are
[42:50] grateful for this another time to be
[42:52] assembled together this side of eternity
[42:54] and we are looking this morning for
[42:57] renewal of strength to come from thee to
[42:59] give us courage for the journey that
[43:01] lays ahead we've gathered as the Hebrew
[43:03] children did only early mornings to get
[43:05] manna that had been provided for them
[43:08] over the night to sustain them through
[43:10] the coming days we gather for the
[43:12] spiritual manna this morning to give a
[43:14] strength for the journey so programs
[43:17] identifying amen that we are going
[43:19] somewhere we're not staying where we're
[43:20] at we're not going back to where we come
[43:22] from but we're going somewhere then
[43:24] where where are we going we're going
[43:25] forward we're going into the rats rayman
[43:28] another place why christ speaker says we
[43:30] think me now and the only way that we
[43:32] would know to correctly fellowship with
[43:34] thee is around my word and thy word is
[43:37] the truth so we gather here a meant for
[43:39] spiritual strength we need it Lord he
[43:42] said we must have strength to endure the
[43:44] crosses that we bear we pray that you'll
[43:47] send the great holy spirit today and
[43:48] will strengthen us all how many could
[43:50] just say Lord strengthen me tonight MN
[43:52] amen it's not just that your brother's
[43:55] carrying a cross or that your sisters
[43:57] in a crawl so that the pastor's carrying
[43:59] across amen but every one of us tonight
[44:01] have been called and we have been
[44:02] summons they meant to bear a cross in
[44:04] this hour amen and I believe that it is
[44:07] an important thing in this hour
[44:08] amen to to stress the Word of God to
[44:11] stress amen while we're here to stress
[44:14] why we're believing amen I don't think
[44:16] it's something that should be taken
[44:17] lightly I don't think it's something
[44:18] that we should take casually Amen but we
[44:21] are here according to the purpose of
[44:23] God's Word we are here for a purpose
[44:25] we're not just here they've been taking
[44:27] up space we're not just here hearing
[44:29] sermons and just here singing songs amen
[44:32] but we are here with a purpose and God
[44:34] Heyman is determined that that purpose
[44:36] will be fulfilled in his church can you
[44:39] say ma'am we noticed there in the book
[44:41] of Nehemiah the eighth chapter how that
[44:43] this is the return of the Exiles amen of
[44:46] Nehemiah stay now that's amazing when
[44:48] you read that and study that they were
[44:50] actually returning and they were facing
[44:52] amen the rebuilding of their society and
[44:54] their nation now everything has been
[44:56] torn down it has been changed it is
[44:58] drastically different than it was the
[45:00] last time they saw it and as they return
[45:02] they're seeing that there something's
[45:04] got to be done something's got to be
[45:05] built amen amen but they've got to
[45:07] remember that they were not rebuilding
[45:09] through human ambition amen but they
[45:11] were rebuilding through God's words so
[45:13] so it's amazing how that they come back
[45:16] and they see all this work ahead of them
[45:18] and the Bible doesn't say they come back
[45:20] crying they don't come back weep and
[45:22] they don't come back sad but when they
[45:24] see the work in front of him but Bible
[45:26] said they begin to rejoice and they
[45:28] begin to worship God amen because they
[45:31] were not laying the foundation stone
[45:32] amen but they were laying the headstone
[45:35] oh thank god tonight church amen that
[45:37] those young people Haman could return
[45:39] and look amen and see everything has
[45:42] been torn down and it's got to be built
[45:43] again amen and if fate tonight Church
[45:46] that we have not come amen and all this
[45:48] work is laying in front of us and it's a
[45:50] heavy burden but it is actually a
[45:51] rejoice and amen because we are not
[45:54] working at the foundation Amen but we've
[45:56] come to the top of this thing
[45:58] amen we have come to the final hours we
[46:00] have come to the final moments I don't
[46:02] know where you're at tonight but can I
[46:03] just tell you you can be one step away
[46:05] from a body change amen amen you could
[46:08] be tonight up on the threshold
[46:10] hey men of that city that tongues all
[46:12] coming down from God out of heaven this
[46:14] is not the hour to hang your head this
[46:16] is not the hour to put your hearts on
[46:18] the willows this is not the hour to quit
[46:20] worship and this is not the hour to quit
[46:22] rejoicing if there ever ought to be a
[46:24] time that we ought to be praising God
[46:26] it's right now it's hurts amen because
[46:29] the headstone is calm amen the headstone
[46:32] has come to the church and then they
[46:34] were not sad you would think humans
[46:35] would see all this work in front of them
[46:37] and begin to get sad but they were not
[46:39] sad
[46:40] amen they were happy Amen I think it's
[46:42] amazing how the Ezra Amen would come
[46:44] back number themselves as Sosa's here
[46:46] Amen that Ezra was a man who was
[46:49] consumed with the word if you look at
[46:52] the meaning of Ezra's name it actually
[46:54] means hell now he was the priest he was
[46:56] described Amen who led the reforms of
[46:59] the return ex house in Jerusalem he was
[47:01] a co-worker a men with Nehemiah and a
[47:04] priest with cerebral hey men Zerubbabel
[47:07] sounds familiar Don it Ezra 7:10 says
[47:09] for Ezra had prepared his heart's amen
[47:12] to seek the law of the Lord and to do
[47:14] and to teach Israel in statutes and
[47:17] judgments now amen I'm the Scalia
[47:18] foundation here but it's amazing how
[47:20] Amen the Bible says that answer Arendt
[47:23] the word Amen from the morning until the
[47:25] noon time Amen now if you go study that
[47:27] you'll find that from the morning to the
[47:29] noon time with six hours Amen it's not a
[47:32] coincidence Amen that Ezra is going to
[47:35] read the word for six hours Amen now
[47:37] let's bring it to another point Amen
[47:39] when Jesus resurrected and he walked
[47:41] with those two on the road to Emmaus
[47:43] maghreb said what did he do he preached
[47:45] that six hours Hermon Amen beginning at
[47:47] Genesis all the way to where he was all
[47:50] right now let's not leave it there but
[47:51] let's bring it to 1962
[47:53] it's not a coincidence that the spoken
[47:55] word is the original seed is another
[47:58] six-hour sermon
[47:59] Amen begin
[48:00] Genesis to Revelation they've been
[48:03] showing you that the word has not come
[48:05] to defeat the church the word has not
[48:07] come to bind the church the word has not
[48:09] come to confuse the church but the word
[48:12] is calm Amen to set the church at
[48:14] rapture condition thank God tonight
[48:17] church that we had got strength to make
[48:20] a rapture Ezra was consumed with the
[48:23] word so so so his answer was consumed
[48:26] the word so what the church become a men
[48:29] consumed with the word Ezra amen was
[48:31] teaching them now Ezra new amen where
[48:33] the street was it was in the word so in
[48:37] Ezra brought the word laid it up on the
[48:39] pulpit read it before the people Amen
[48:41] there must be a response to the word
[48:44] Nehemiah chapter and the sixth verse
[48:46] says Ezra blessed the Lord the Great God
[48:48] and all the people answered a man a man
[48:52] with lifting up their hands and they bow
[48:54] their heads and worship the Lord with
[48:56] her faces to the ground see the people
[48:59] were not a men in Hazra Amen but they
[49:01] were a many or acknowledging the great
[49:04] God that Ezra was reading about Amen see
[49:07] what they were doing they were not
[49:08] acknowledging that his room was in their
[49:10] mess and then they were not
[49:12] acknowledging that Nehemiah was in there
[49:13] miss they was acknowledging that the
[49:15] great God Amen that part about Amen is
[49:19] that God is going to take him through
[49:20] and I think tonight Church it's a good
[49:22] night to get familiar with the word
[49:24] again called a man it's a good night
[49:27] amen to just remind the devil I'm not
[49:30] just here taking up space
[49:31] I believe what I'm hearing I agree with
[49:34] what I'm hear the word that I'm hearing
[49:36] is release enough power
[49:38] hold me inside of my heart I can't
[49:41] preach for preaching amen it's something
[49:43] about it friends when you hear the word
[49:45] no matter how tired you are no matter
[49:47] what you're going through no matter what
[49:49] your faith said no matter what spirits
[49:51] is attacking the church no matter what's
[49:53] going on in the world when you hear the
[49:56] word it releases
[49:57] man in your heart you know why this hats
[50:00] because it's drawing you beyond
[50:02] reappeared and taking you where God is
[50:04] horn ain't you to go
[50:06] we are not discouraged tonight there's a
[50:09] lot of work ahead of us but we're not
[50:11] tired come on church what by then do we
[50:14] ought to be tired because here we are
[50:15] all these years later and God hasn't
[50:17] returned and we ought to just get tired
[50:19] and then we've been serving Lord for 30
[50:22] 40 50 years we ought to be tired not a
[50:24] real son or daughter of God they are
[50:26] more stronger tonight than they were
[50:28] when they first believed they are more
[50:30] excited about the message tonight than
[50:33] they were when they heard their purse
[50:34] paid you know why because it's a
[50:36] headstone ain't been coming up on the
[50:39] church amen when they heard his to read
[50:41] the word answered it had to beg him to
[50:43] say man yes what it has to beg him to
[50:45] clap their hands as we didn't have to
[50:47] beg him to smile amen it was nature to
[50:50] him amen they were happy about it amen
[50:52] and I'll say tonight that the devil is
[50:54] pull equipment over on the church and
[50:56] he's got us away from Santa a man ain't
[50:58] meant to we just sit there and nod and
[51:00] we give a thumbs up every now and again
[51:02] amen but there is a power in nowhere day
[51:05] man hey amen there is something happens
[51:08] it could be a cold service and nobody's
[51:10] saying nothing but somebody break
[51:12] through and see a man and watch the fire
[51:15] God come down upon the church and
[51:17] consumer young man and consumer younger
[51:20] what is it friends it's the word
[51:23] returning to the church we are not in
[51:27] Paris to the word a man well then I'd
[51:29] say Amen but the devil told me he was
[51:31] going to get after me let me give you a
[51:33] good little word of advice okay he's
[51:35] going to get after you whether you say
[51:36] Amen or not he's going to get after your
[51:40] family whether you agree with her during
[51:42] Hajj amen so I learned a long time ago
[51:44] let's steal him a run for his money
[51:46] go ahead and say amen amen can I preach
[51:49] to you tonight if we're gonna get ready
[51:51] we might as well come and enjoy
[51:53] ourselves and then why we got to sit
[51:55] here something amen that we can't
[51:57] identify ourselves with amen this
[51:59] message is not a message of a million
[52:01] miles away it is
[52:02] present its message that what you are
[52:04] hearing you don't have to wait for the
[52:06] next meeting to have it you don't have
[52:08] to wait till the next Sunday but when
[52:10] you hear the word you can say Amen and
[52:13] identify yourself with it if you need
[52:17] healing all you gotta do is say amen
[52:19] amen if you need deliverance when you
[52:22] hear the preacher say time it's still a
[52:24] deliver all you gotta do is say hey man
[52:26] if you need the Holy Ghost when you hear
[52:29] the preacher say car it's still giving
[52:31] the whole it goes only thing you gotta
[52:33] do is say man amen identify yourself
[52:37] with the word what does the word Amen
[52:39] mean it means barely it means truly it
[52:43] means so--but it means let it be so
[52:48] so it is so shall it be amen
[52:52] so it is ain't it so shall it be oh when
[52:55] I hear the word I say it was I say it is
[52:58] and I say it shall be
[53:00] oh brother and ER that word ain't man
[53:02] it's just the word that a bunch of holy
[53:04] rollers around the message carried over
[53:05] from Pentecost know that word a man is a
[53:08] title of Jesus Christ revelation 3:14
[53:11] says he is the a man he is the a man he
[53:19] is the Soviet he is not going no further
[53:22] o friends do you see why the devil hates
[53:25] it when you say man because your Amen
[53:27] draws a line in the sand
[53:29] Amen you're a man ain't men draw some
[53:31] mark and since devil it's over tonight
[53:35] when the devil says you can't have joy
[53:37] and the preacher says there's joy
[53:39] unspeakable and full of glory and you
[53:41] say Amen that draws a line and says
[53:44] Satan I'm leaving here with my joy
[53:46] you're not stopping me any further the
[53:49] part of God says in the impersonation of
[53:51] Christianity paragraph 189 he says
[53:54] material is not tested by its quantity
[53:56] but how big it is how bigger the church
[53:58] I mean here see it's not tested by its
[54:01] quantity but by its quality can he say
[54:03] man
[54:04] I love this metal is tested by its
[54:08] strength amen and the church it's not
[54:11] tested on how big a church or how many
[54:14] members it's tested by its strength by
[54:17] the Bible how can it say Amen to every
[54:21] promise that God has given come on
[54:25] church the test Amen of the strength of
[54:27] the true church is to be able to say a
[54:30] man amen to every word
[54:32] seat but today we have changed the signs
[54:35] of a thriving church amen to how many
[54:37] members of God's or how fancy require
[54:40] you got or how educated of a preacher
[54:42] you've got Amen but that's not what the
[54:44] Prophet said he sent the sign of the
[54:46] truck of a strong church a mint is when
[54:48] they can say a man Amen to every promise
[54:52] of God's word brother sister you know
[54:54] why the devil hates some of you tonight
[54:55] is because he's puts you through hell
[54:57] and back amen but you still come to
[55:00] church and when you hear the word you
[55:02] say a man when you hear the spirit speak
[55:05] this hey man when you feel the Holy
[55:07] Ghost you release yourself to don't you
[55:10] see what it is it's a sign of a strong
[55:12] church and then there could be five
[55:16] people here tonight amen and there would
[55:18] be enough to take every devil out of
[55:20] here amen there could be two people here
[55:22] tonight and if those two people agree
[55:24] upon the word there's enough Street they
[55:27] meant to defeat ever sickness amen
[55:29] defeat every disease it's not how many
[55:32] members you've got amen it's not how
[55:34] many degrees or how how educated the
[55:36] church is it's the ability to be able to
[55:38] agree with the word 2nd Corinthians 1:20
[55:41] says Amen for all the promises of God
[55:44] are in him and they are a a and in him a
[55:49] man unto the glory of God by us Amen
[55:52] then you want to know what a pedigree
[55:54] Christian is the Prophet says I like a
[55:56] genuine pedigree Christian he knows
[56:00] where he come from Amen from the
[56:02] original baptism of the Holy Ghost on
[56:04] the day of Pentecost glory to God he is
[56:07] pedigreed and sealed by the kingdom of
[56:09] God say is Jesus Christ the same
[56:12] yesterday today and forever
[56:14] and that old mule a mental holler well
[56:17] in some ways he is but a pedigree will
[56:20] say hey man amen it ain't a preacher
[56:24] calling you a mule
[56:25] it's your response to the word
[56:27] identifying whether you're a mule or a
[56:29] pedigree Christian amen a genuine
[56:31] experience of God will punctuate every
[56:34] promise with an amen faith always admits
[56:39] the word is right amen if your faith
[56:41] punctuate every word of God's word with
[56:44] an amen there is something wrong with
[56:46] your experience the Bible said he is the
[56:48] same yesterday
[56:49] amen today in forever and if it don't
[56:52] say amen to that
[56:53] then there is something wrong jesus said
[56:55] the works that I do shall you do also if
[56:58] it don't say amen to that then there is
[57:00] something wrong
[57:01] if it don't punctuate every word of
[57:03] God's promise with an amen then there is
[57:05] something wrong
[57:06] amen but how many can say tonight what
[57:08] we want is an amen church amen what we
[57:12] want is an Amen preacher what we want is
[57:14] an Amen congregation what do you want to
[57:16] be young people
[57:17] another young generation of argued with
[57:20] this message we're simply saying a man
[57:23] why we find today that there are two
[57:26] churches in the last day can you say man
[57:28] and then there is a true church and
[57:31] there is a false church you find Amen
[57:33] that Genesis is the seat chapter
[57:36] Amen so everything that you see in the
[57:38] world today it actually began in spirit
[57:41] form in Genesis see it was birthed from
[57:45] those two trees amen now the tree of
[57:47] life and the tree of knowledge of good
[57:49] and evil was symbolic remem sense of
[57:51] persons he meant now the tree of life
[57:53] aim it was symbolic of Jesus Christ and
[57:56] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[57:58] was symbolic of Lucifer aim it but you
[58:01] find that the true church is elected not
[58:04] to be deceived by the false church
[58:06] Matthew 24:24 for there shall arise
[58:09] false Christ's and false prophets and
[58:11] shall sow great signs and wonders in so
[58:13] much that if it were possible they shall
[58:16] deceive the very elect the church takes
[58:19] button out of this first key that we
[58:21] have received of the Lord there comes
[58:23] another
[58:24] and slightly less wonderful truth I said
[58:26] that the true church would always try to
[58:29] be like it was in the book of Acts
[58:32] that's exactly right
[58:34] but we have discovered that the word
[58:36] also teaches an invasion of error until
[58:40] there is a complete blackout of truth in
[58:42] the last day when the Lord is about to
[58:44] appear the question now arises in our
[58:47] mind does God forsake his hold and let
[58:50] them fall into a state of complete
[58:52] deception on or no accountant on no
[58:57] accounts for the scripture says very
[58:59] clearly in Mathew 24:24 the elect
[59:02] somebody shout elect cannot be deceived
[59:06] what then the answer is clear before us
[59:09] there is a true church and a false
[59:13] church there is a true vine and a false
[59:16] man but of course that false church
[59:18] false-9 body will always try to assert
[59:21] amen the position of the true church and
[59:23] contend that she and not the elect are
[59:26] the real and authentic but false will
[59:28] try to kill the truth that is how it was
[59:30] in the book of Acts that is how it is
[59:32] set forth in the seven ages that is how
[59:35] it is declared in the various epistles
[59:36] that is how it is being that is how it
[59:39] is now that is how it will be it cannot
[59:41] change but I want you to remember that
[59:43] the book of Acts was not defeated they
[59:46] meant the sons and daughters of God and
[59:48] Acts was not defeated
[59:49] Amen so if they were not defeated then
[59:51] and they will not be defeated now that
[59:53] if this pain tears for another twenty
[59:56] years
[59:56] amen they won't be defeated in twenty
[59:58] years I'm trying to preach a meant they
[1:00:03] won't be defeated listen there is
[1:00:04] something about this church it is the
[1:00:07] undefeatable Church it is the church
[1:00:10] that cannot be defeated it is an
[1:00:12] invincible army it is too strong to be
[1:00:15] defeated it is too strong to be stopped
[1:00:17] what has given us that Street they
[1:00:19] agreed with the Word of God from the
[1:00:22] hour that we're living in see what we
[1:00:24] must remember is is that Jesus was upon
[1:00:27] the earth Judas was upon the earth Amen
[1:00:29] we must remember that the Spirit of
[1:00:31] Christ amen return
[1:00:33] upon the true church and the problem of
[1:00:35] God is going to show us that as the
[1:00:37] Spirit of Christ returned upon the true
[1:00:40] church the spirit of Judas returned upon
[1:00:42] the false church see Judas would have a
[1:00:46] form of godliness but would deny the
[1:00:48] power thereof in 2nd Timothy 3:5 the
[1:00:52] Bible says having a mint a form of
[1:00:54] godliness amen but denying the power
[1:00:57] thereof and the property picks us up I
[1:01:00] believe it is at the only ones and he
[1:01:01] says see don't run to it but turn away
[1:01:04] from it see when they begin to deny the
[1:01:06] power he meant now not deny the power of
[1:01:09] God amen kind of preach they meant not
[1:01:12] deny the power of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:01:14] but when they begin to deny the power of
[1:01:17] the vindicated word for the hour which
[1:01:19] you're living you turn away from it amen
[1:01:22] because that is a false lying spirit
[1:01:24] that is a false church spirit and you're
[1:01:28] looking at one young man that's not
[1:01:29] afraid to stand and say that is a spirit
[1:01:32] from the pits of hell any spirit that
[1:01:35] tries to set this message down is a
[1:01:37] damning out of hell but I want to tell
[1:01:39] the devil there is a pride upon the
[1:01:41] earth for not who you are not cetera
[1:01:44] you will not back her up you are not
[1:01:46] quite there down she has got the
[1:01:48] strength of God to withstand that spirit
[1:01:51] of deception in the age were living you
[1:01:56] may deceive them but you ain't gonna
[1:01:58] deceive us amen because we agree with
[1:02:00] the word and the very sign of deception
[1:02:03] is when you can't agree with the world
[1:02:07] but then who you better just be careful
[1:02:09] no Amen cuz that's the spirit that
[1:02:11] destroys homes it's a spirit that
[1:02:13] destroys marriages it is a spirit that
[1:02:15] destroys churches it is a spirit that
[1:02:17] destroys ministries it is a spirit and
[1:02:20] there is a bride here to contend and
[1:02:23] withstand that spirit see the Prophet
[1:02:27] said what he done Judas done was he
[1:02:29] leaned amen to his own understanding
[1:02:31] instead of the understanding that was
[1:02:34] the vindicated Word of God and he did it
[1:02:37] to Jesus just what the scripture said he
[1:02:40] would do and today the church world has
[1:02:43] turned Christ
[1:02:44] that in the last stage just exactly like
[1:02:49] the book of Revelation said they would
[1:02:50] have it is the spirit of Judas again in
[1:02:53] the form of church they meant having a
[1:02:57] form of godliness but denying the power
[1:02:59] of the word see that's right now oh my
[1:03:02] what did it result in death just like it
[1:03:05] did the heed it done and all others who
[1:03:07] tries to provoke the Word of God and
[1:03:09] lean to their own understanding even now
[1:03:11] they sell not for thirty pieces of
[1:03:13] silver but maybe become old some great
[1:03:16] officers some seminary experience wasn't
[1:03:18] even worth thirty pieces of silver but
[1:03:20] they sell it anyhow he said see they
[1:03:22] sale their understanding of God hey I
[1:03:27] hear me church what didn't II am I say
[1:03:29] in the book of Nehemiah what is one word
[1:03:31] that is attached with the opening of the
[1:03:33] book is understanding when the book
[1:03:37] comes open there comes that
[1:03:38] understanding when the book comes open
[1:03:41] there comes an understanding see and
[1:03:43] when there is an understanding then
[1:03:45] there is a year of Thummim and then then
[1:03:47] there is a sign Amen that what is being
[1:03:49] said can either come back to the year
[1:03:52] and the Thummim and be proven right or
[1:03:54] false and I say tonight friends Amen the
[1:03:57] same spirits that rested upon Paul has
[1:04:00] returned in this generation that if
[1:04:02] you're not going to say what the seventh
[1:04:04] angel is said there is some sons and
[1:04:07] daughters that's going to stand up and
[1:04:09] say you're not preaching from an open
[1:04:11] book you're not preaching from an
[1:04:15] understanding you're preaching from a
[1:04:17] seminary you're preaching from an
[1:04:19] education but there is some people here
[1:04:21] tonight
[1:04:22] let's not more than a feeling we got
[1:04:24] more than a sensation we got more than
[1:04:26] an education we've got an understanding
[1:04:29] that God would be here that the church
[1:04:32] would be here I'm not crazy I'm a
[1:04:36] message believer and this message has
[1:04:39] fallen understanding the church
[1:04:43] go ahead
[1:04:44] praise the Lord you might as well we've
[1:04:47] got an understanding you wanna shout
[1:04:51] about something you got an understanding
[1:04:53] about something you got the opening but
[1:04:58] seven seals the third book has been
[1:05:01] clearly identified we're not a confused
[1:05:06] church we're a strong Church brother
[1:05:10] what give us the street brother behind
[1:05:12] the message gave it to us you take the
[1:05:17] message out of the pulpit and it'll
[1:05:18] become another Hollywood evangelism you
[1:05:21] take the message out of your office and
[1:05:23] it'll become a lot but if you lift this
[1:05:25] message up power no we always stay in
[1:05:35] this message I'm not ashamed of it it's
[1:05:41] the understanding of God okay go ahead
[1:05:44] Judas if you want to sell out your
[1:05:46] understanding of God go ahead but there
[1:05:48] is some seed here that cannot be
[1:05:50] deceived if they didn't have something
[1:05:55] to give you 30 years ago don't think
[1:05:57] they got something now let the
[1:06:02] Pentecostal church 30 years ago to
[1:06:04] follow the message and I tell you what I
[1:06:05] think now it's about time to go back
[1:06:07] because the message has gotten stale and
[1:06:09] and all they do is read clothes and all
[1:06:11] they do is holler about a seventh angel
[1:06:13] amen but let me tell you if they were
[1:06:15] dying thirty years ago then let me rest
[1:06:17] you sure tonight there are more dead
[1:06:19] tonight than they were thirty years ago
[1:06:22] amen but I'm preaching from a message
[1:06:24] that is not more higher in it tonight
[1:06:27] it's got more reality in it tonight but
[1:06:32] then I want to quote for that okay the
[1:06:34] problem of God said he becomes more real
[1:06:36] he becomes a realist he's going to be at
[1:06:39] the end
[1:06:40] of an age at the end of an age is when
[1:06:47] he becomes more real don't misunderstand
[1:06:49] me please but he's more real here in
[1:06:52] this building tonight than he was in 65
[1:06:54] he's more real here tonight than he was
[1:06:57] in treatment
[1:06:58] amen because the Prophet is gone but the
[1:07:01] message is still in power in
[1:07:05] demonstration it's real tonight there
[1:07:10] are some people here that is lifting up
[1:07:12] holy hands and saying a man because the
[1:07:15] understanding has come the understanding
[1:07:24] has come when you read about Cain you
[1:07:25] got an understanding now when you read
[1:07:29] about Moses hand or Jesus saying it
[1:07:31] wasn't so from the beginning you've got
[1:07:33] an understanding now when you hear the
[1:07:35] cleanness Sheba you got an understanding
[1:07:38] now when you hear about the woman at the
[1:07:40] well you've got an understanding now
[1:07:44] when you hear about blind Bartimaeus
[1:07:46] you've got an understanding now what
[1:07:49] give it to your church the message of
[1:07:52] the hour the message of the hour has
[1:07:56] revealed that we the bride is the true
[1:08:00] church the true church is the Church of
[1:08:03] the Living God then what does that
[1:08:05] qualify us for
[1:08:07] Amen brother Samuel it qualifies us for
[1:08:09] the contest we are not a met in a
[1:08:13] contest Amen but we are into the contest
[1:08:16] bro we wrestle no look at this short
[1:08:19] rest on the feast in 6:12 for we wrestle
[1:08:21] not against flesh and blood but against
[1:08:25] principalities against powers against
[1:08:28] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:08:30] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:08:34] places see what the word wrestle means
[1:08:36] it means a contest between two in which
[1:08:40] each endeavors to throw the other and
[1:08:42] which is decided when the victor is able
[1:08:45] to hold his opponent down with his hand
[1:08:48] up
[1:08:49] his neck oh and the term is transferred
[1:08:55] to the Christian struggle with the power
[1:08:59] of evil
[1:09:00] see I meant the word wrestle amen
[1:09:02] becomes the word wrestle but victory
[1:09:04] comes when the opponent is able to put
[1:09:07] his hand can I bring it a little bit
[1:09:09] closer home or put his foot upon the
[1:09:12] neck of the enemy do you know what the
[1:09:16] contest is it is a test of strength see
[1:09:20] the Indian used to put a fire and they
[1:09:22] would put so many men on this into the
[1:09:24] rope and so many on this in in a
[1:09:26] tug-of-war the contest of strength would
[1:09:28] pull the losing party across the fire
[1:09:31] and now we know there's many things that
[1:09:33] we could face this upon for a few
[1:09:34] minutes amen but the greatest contest
[1:09:36] there is that's between the church and
[1:09:39] Satan amen if you could give me a bit
[1:09:41] more on these monitors I'd appreciate it
[1:09:42] it's it's the contest between the church
[1:09:45] and st. now that scares people because
[1:09:48] notice he didn't say it's the contest
[1:09:50] between God and Satan it's now the
[1:09:53] contest between the church and Satan
[1:09:57] notice here that great strength of Satan
[1:10:00] and we want to speak of the great
[1:10:02] strength of God in his church all right
[1:10:06] now catch this that's why you've been
[1:10:08] through what you've been through but you
[1:10:10] still got to victory is because it's not
[1:10:12] you fighting it's not your streak it's
[1:10:16] the strength of God that has come on the
[1:10:18] inside of you no wonder the devil hates
[1:10:23] you because when he finds you
[1:10:25] it's like spotting God he thought you
[1:10:30] it's like God himself you know why
[1:10:33] because God has changed his mask in this
[1:10:36] generation and
[1:10:38] himself in young men in young women in
[1:10:41] preachers in deacon see the devil scared
[1:10:46] of you to not church brother ender I
[1:10:51] don't know if I can keep fight well you
[1:10:53] ain't fight in the first place God's
[1:10:56] just using your body to fight through
[1:10:59] the contest has been going on for many
[1:11:03] years the contest actually started in
[1:11:05] heaven and Satan was kicked out into the
[1:11:10] earth and then it became an enemy to
[1:11:12] God's people but the Prophet said so
[1:11:14] amen the word is God and the word
[1:11:16] becomes our streets God in the church
[1:11:19] becomes its strength to pull Satan into
[1:11:23] his own tire that he has made you know
[1:11:28] why the devil's embarrassed is because
[1:11:30] he said they had a contest because they
[1:11:33] were trying to prove who is stronger
[1:11:35] then they would say okay if I'm stronger
[1:11:38] then you're coming in the fire but if
[1:11:40] you're stronger then I'm coming in the
[1:11:42] fire Amen but the devil hates you you
[1:11:44] know I hate you because she was born in
[1:11:46] sin we were safer in iniquity we come in
[1:11:49] the world speaking lies and God wrote
[1:11:51] about us in the book of Revelation and
[1:11:54] said we saw overcome him they meant so
[1:11:57] God has already written victory about
[1:12:00] you in his word
[1:12:01] oh brother Andrew then we just need the
[1:12:05] by but we just need Christ alright let
[1:12:07] me preach to you for a second put your
[1:12:09] seatbelt on Amen but just having the
[1:12:11] Bible or the word in letter form it's
[1:12:13] not straight come on church don't get
[1:12:17] cloud on me now Amen the false church
[1:12:19] read this same Bible this weekend the
[1:12:22] false church carries the same Bible they
[1:12:24] met the false church preaches from the
[1:12:26] same Bible Amen it's not just carrying
[1:12:28] the Bible or the word being letter form
[1:12:30] but the streets of the church or the
[1:12:33] street that the believer is when you can
[1:12:35] say Amen
[1:12:36] or agree with all the words from Genesis
[1:12:39] to Revelation second Corinthians three
[1:12:43] five not that we are sufficient of
[1:12:45] ourselves to think anything is of
[1:12:47] ourselves
[1:12:48] but Paul says our sufficiency as of God
[1:12:52] who also have made us able ministers of
[1:12:57] the New Testament not of the letter but
[1:12:59] of the spirit for the letter killeth but
[1:13:04] the spirit giveth life the Spirit give a
[1:13:08] streak the Spirit quickens the word
[1:13:11] remember census in Hebrews chapter five
[1:13:14] and six but Paul being well trained knew
[1:13:16] the Scriptures by the word but you see
[1:13:20] the scriptures no matter how well you
[1:13:23] know them if the Spirit doesn't quick
[1:13:26] them then the letter killeth the spirit
[1:13:29] giveth life C it must be quickened or
[1:13:32] made it alive by the spirits if the
[1:13:35] spirit doesn't live in the word oh I got
[1:13:39] time to get into it but I will preach on
[1:13:41] in a few days when the spirit alive it's
[1:13:43] the word then you ain't got no right to
[1:13:45] sleep in church oh I got caught there
[1:13:53] when the spirit live in the word then
[1:13:56] you no longer have a right to judge
[1:13:58] somebody for shouting see because the
[1:14:01] word has become more than a book to them
[1:14:04] the Prophet said if the spirit doesn't
[1:14:07] live in the word and make it a reality
[1:14:10] than the letter is just intellectual
[1:14:12] then do you know why you're shouting
[1:14:14] tonight is because they're scholars
[1:14:17] there's philosophers there's steel
[1:14:19] oceans that have been trying for years
[1:14:21] to understand what's your understanding
[1:14:23] but they can't understand it
[1:14:26] but there is a spirits in the house of
[1:14:29] God to quicken the word rather somebody
[1:14:33] shout we need spiritual strength we need
[1:14:36] spiritual strength amen amen the bible
[1:14:39] says in psalm 28:7 the lord is my
[1:14:41] strength and my shield my heart trusted
[1:14:45] in him and I am helped therefore my
[1:14:47] heart greatly rejoices and with my song
[1:14:49] will I praise him the prophet said if a
[1:14:52] man will shut himself off from God's
[1:14:54] spiritual sunshine then there's
[1:14:55] something wrong with this spiritual
[1:14:57] condition for when a man refuses to walk
[1:15:00] in the leading of God of a good God like
[1:15:03] our God who is our comfort and our
[1:15:05] streets and deliver his sunshine and
[1:15:07] spiritual growth it's spiritual strength
[1:15:10] to live in here sunshine the shining of
[1:15:13] his glory well it's the greatest
[1:15:16] privilege we have to live under the
[1:15:18] sunlight of God's glory to look at the
[1:15:21] good healthy Christians amen I don't get
[1:15:26] mad but you're pretty healthy tonight oh
[1:15:29] brother I don't feel like I'm healthy no
[1:15:31] I talk about the natural man because my
[1:15:34] Bible says the outward man perish a
[1:15:36] neighbor day but the inward man is
[1:15:38] renewed day by day
[1:15:40] [Applause]
[1:15:42] amen you know what you come in here and
[1:15:45] sometimes you don't even feel like
[1:15:46] you're saved you don't even feel like
[1:15:48] you got the whole ego you feel like the
[1:15:50] devil has done everything you can to
[1:15:52] destroy your testimony but when you
[1:15:54] begin to hear that word something begins
[1:15:56] to turn a mint something begins to
[1:15:59] pulsate what is it it's a sign of a
[1:16:02] healthy Christian the Prophet said
[1:16:07] helpless this morning Lord as we read
[1:16:09] the word may the Holy Spirit reveal it
[1:16:12] to us somebody shot revealed that the
[1:16:14] church might be fully established in the
[1:16:17] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:16:19] Saints to hold them and may as you give
[1:16:22] the dish and some two years ago to store
[1:16:24] up the food fine healthy-looking
[1:16:26] vegetables then I saw an addition being
[1:16:28] stored here in this tabernacle may we
[1:16:31] today receive a whole barrel full of
[1:16:33] that or a tape
[1:16:34] Amen that it might reveal Jesus Christ
[1:16:37] to us in this hour that we might live
[1:16:41] amen to give a sustaining strength so
[1:16:47] the strength of God that's not just
[1:16:50] strengthening you to move it strengthens
[1:16:54] you to stand are you following me the
[1:16:59] streets of God does not just strengthen
[1:17:01] you to get to the house of God and then
[1:17:04] hear the word and then get out of church
[1:17:05] and say well I don't know how in the
[1:17:08] world I'm gonna live that no the
[1:17:09] strength of God gives you sustaining
[1:17:12] streets to sustain you in the word that
[1:17:16] you hear see but the problem it is is we
[1:17:19] got to get in the spirit some time or
[1:17:21] another I'm just gonna take the brakes
[1:17:23] off here and preach for the last a
[1:17:25] little bit but sometime rather we just
[1:17:26] got to get in the spirit
[1:17:28] what will endure you don't realize that
[1:17:30] we we can't get in the spirit because
[1:17:32] we're practicing social distancing well
[1:17:34] and then I've come to realize brother
[1:17:36] Samuel that a long time before social
[1:17:38] distancing become popular people was
[1:17:39] already practicing it we had spiritual
[1:17:44] social institution Amen we had people
[1:17:46] that when somebody went to the altar and
[1:17:47] they got to cry a little bit in a snot
[1:17:49] little big hole stay away from me come
[1:17:53] on they met her somebody around them get
[1:17:55] to shouting let's say what will hold
[1:17:57] your peace over there and then see what
[1:17:58] it is is that devil don't want you to
[1:18:01] get in the spirit because if he get in
[1:18:03] the spirit
[1:18:04] listen the person shouting has got just
[1:18:07] as much a right to be critical as you do
[1:18:10] but then they decide that critical
[1:18:13] spirit and got in the Holy Spirit and it
[1:18:16] released something in there see what did
[1:18:20] John say he said I was in the spirit on
[1:18:22] the Lord's Day amen I was in the spirit
[1:18:25] isn't that just beautiful the whole of
[1:18:27] the Christian life it has to be the
[1:18:29] Spirit of God with us - or all of our
[1:18:32] efforts are in vain see Paul said I will
[1:18:35] pray in the spirit he said I will sing
[1:18:38] in the spirit he said I will live in the
[1:18:40] spirit if
[1:18:41] is anything good that will come to me it
[1:18:44] has to be revealed by the spirits
[1:18:46] confirmed by the word and made manifest
[1:18:49] by the results it bears see now you read
[1:18:52] acts 2:38 and they never get in his
[1:18:54] spirit or it would happen to them
[1:18:56] exactly as the word says pray to God for
[1:19:03] a revelation by his Spirit that is the
[1:19:07] first step is get in the spirit see all
[1:19:12] we need to get in the spirit then the
[1:19:15] things will be done don't go through the
[1:19:17] acts first get in the spirit and then go
[1:19:21] through the acts and watch what God will
[1:19:24] do now if you read there and second
[1:19:26] Kings 3 verse 16 it amazes me how and
[1:19:29] then that the Bible actually says there
[1:19:31] thus saith the Lord make this valley
[1:19:34] full of ditches now what happened was
[1:19:36] they was in a drought and what they had
[1:19:40] to do was they had to dig out the
[1:19:42] ditches for the water to come now you
[1:19:45] got to realize something here they meant
[1:19:47] they were all in a drought there wasn't
[1:19:51] a one of them that wasn't in a drought
[1:19:53] and the Bible says to dig out the
[1:19:57] ditches now the problem God says now
[1:19:59] what do they do they didn't know it
[1:20:01] today he said men walk around amen
[1:20:04] ignorant sit this way amen they're down
[1:20:07] here in this valley and it's hot it's
[1:20:09] dry they're down there trying to get
[1:20:12] water trying to move trying to get
[1:20:15] strength
[1:20:16] aim it and there's nothing happened the
[1:20:18] nail marry and then God sends a prophet
[1:20:20] by the name of Elijah oh brother I want
[1:20:25] to preach on that sometime but the
[1:20:26] Prophet shows up and a prophet comes
[1:20:30] walking down there and they're all in a
[1:20:33] drought and Elijah walks down there and
[1:20:35] says hey but now let me just say this it
[1:20:37] was so dry they couldn't even hardly
[1:20:39] talk brother it was so dry they can t
[1:20:43] barley say Amen
[1:20:48] but I should come down there and said
[1:20:51] hey look it's hot now down here and they
[1:21:03] said yeah sure is
[1:21:07] I said what's wrong they said we ain't
[1:21:09] got no water Alaska said okay I have
[1:21:13] come with the answer
[1:21:15] what isn't of I said he said pick up
[1:21:18] that shovel and dig some ditches here
[1:21:31] big big you're not are you not
[1:21:36] dry like us I'm going somewhere stay
[1:21:41] with me today but ever since men walk in
[1:21:45] early they don't know that's a true seat
[1:21:46] they don't dig down deep enough to get
[1:21:51] in the spirit of Revelation they don't
[1:21:55] pray enough they don't call upon God
[1:21:57] enough they just slightly take it oh
[1:21:59] well I believe there's a god sure the
[1:22:01] devil believes the same thing the devil
[1:22:05] believes the same thing and the Prophet
[1:22:07] says he trembles see what are they
[1:22:09] guilty of crucifying him sure but him
[1:22:13] says I indict this generation finding
[1:22:15] them guilty by the same word that found
[1:22:18] them guilty at the beginning see what
[1:22:20] they did
[1:22:21] when Elijah comes and says dig out these
[1:22:23] ditches in other words you were saying
[1:22:25] if you want some water you got to do
[1:22:27] something
[1:22:28] you got to get to work they said okay I
[1:22:30] said how much water are we gonna get he
[1:22:33] said just make the valley full of
[1:22:34] ditches Elijah you've lost your mind
[1:22:42] Elijah had lost his mind
[1:22:44] Elijah had been in the unseen Elijah had
[1:22:50] been up there where God takes his
[1:22:52] profits to where the Prophet God sent a
[1:22:55] prophet goes above the people and sees
[1:22:58] the Feynman's coming up on the church he

[1:23:06] this stuff coming notice here and Elijah
[1:23:08] says now go down there and make the
[1:23:10] valley full of ditches you said with

[1:23:21] they could see was the dryness around
[1:23:23] them all they could see was all the
[1:23:25] trouble around them but I should have
[1:23:28] been in the unseen
[1:23:30] and they couldn't see it yet amen but
[1:23:34] what they had to do was they had to
[1:23:36] catch the vision of Elijah and believe
[1:23:39] Elijah's message if you make this church
[1:23:42] full of ditches if you make this church
[1:23:47] full of ditches then there's some water

[1:25:48] her they joined the church and put their
[1:25:50] name upon a role and become a better

[1:26:02] cleared his voice so well let me carry
[1:26:05] on and he died a pull across that we

[1:26:13] and send our sister you have to climb
[1:26:15] down or you have to follow us out of
[1:26:18] here she said well I guess I better go
[1:26:19] ahead and follow you because I'm not

[1:26:24] that's the way we feel about an old-time
[1:26:26] Holy Ghost meet you don't have to be all
[1:26:29] the time down in the dumps but when you

[1:26:49] believer how many real believers have we
[1:26:50] got here if you are a real believer it

[1:27:02] drought the word is intellectual - but
[1:27:05] unto you that has been quickened by the
[1:27:07] spirit it is more than just a book it is
[1:27:10] more than just a page it is more than
[1:27:13] just a picture
[1:27:14] it is a whale springing up in the heart
[1:27:16] of the church I don't know about you but
[1:27:19] I say spring up o well we need some
[1:27:22] water

[1:27:56] gonna dry it's more than religion to us
[1:28:04] the message has made the Bible a living
[1:28:08] reality now I have a tendency to preach
[1:28:14] some time so I'm just gonna preacher for
[1:28:16] a second if this message remains any
[1:28:18] simple form to you it's gonna do you no
[1:28:20] good if all it is it's charts and
[1:28:27] pictures
[1:28:31] I'm on this preach for a second I may
[1:28:34] get in trouble but I want the preaching
[1:28:36] I was in the Church of the day and all
[1:28:38] it was was chart - well I say the other
[1:28:42] day here's a while back but it was just
[1:28:45] charge this chart that chart this chart
[1:28:48] that chart this and that picture this
[1:28:50] chart and you talk to people they said
[1:28:52] well you know what we sure get into a
[1:28:54] short learning this message at the same
[1:28:58] time you got young people struggling
[1:29:00] with pornography at the same time you
[1:29:03] got you hear me see it's it's one thing
[1:29:05] to be in charge for me it's one thing to
[1:29:08] be in semaphore but the symbols are not
[1:29:10] going to change nothing it's got to
[1:29:13] become a reality it's got to become
[1:29:16] something real to you if all this
[1:29:19] message is to you is a book on the shelf
[1:29:21] and a tape in the player and a picture
[1:29:24] on the wall just a few more setting to
[1:29:26] the Sun and you're gonna be as dry as
[1:29:28] the rest of them in that valley oh but
[1:29:30] if this message becomes your absolute if
[1:29:33] this message becomes the reason you live
[1:29:35] the reason you breathe the reason you
[1:29:37] see the reason you get up and if this
[1:29:40] message becomes your all and all
[1:29:42] little brother let me pay in the skies
[1:29:44] and limit and then ain't no devil can
[1:29:46] cap you off
[1:29:47] ain't no spirit can shut you up call
[1:29:50] come on church this message is not just
[1:29:52] building churches it's not just making
[1:29:55] preachers this message is taking us out
[1:29:57] of this world
[1:29:59] leave here one of these morning sir this
[1:30:04] is more than just a book this is more
[1:30:06] than just attack this is the
[1:30:08] understanding have you ever noticed how
[1:30:14] Satan hates two books of the Bible more
[1:30:19] than all the others now the devil get
[1:30:23] quite here but that's okay I won't cut
[1:30:26] his head off
[1:30:28] through the liberal theologians through
[1:30:33] persuade no scientist is always
[1:30:34] attacking the book of Revelation and
[1:30:37] Genesis in both of these books we find
[1:30:44] Satan's origin his awful ways and his
[1:30:48] destruction that is why he attacks them
[1:30:52] he hates to be exposed and in those
[1:30:56] books he is exposed for exactly what he
[1:30:59] is jesus said about Satan he has no part
[1:31:03] of me and I have no part of him the
[1:31:06] devil would like to prove that different
[1:31:09] but he cannot do so then what does the
[1:31:14] devil do he does all he can to destroy
[1:31:17] confidence in the word come on church
[1:31:21] amen people that's walk away from this
[1:31:23] message they're not trying to destroy
[1:31:25] your confidence in the book Oh get back
[1:31:28] to my abou Bible okay we've been there
[1:31:30] they try to destroy your confidence in
[1:31:32] the interpretation of the book because a
[1:31:35] church that is a closed book has got a
[1:31:39] closed wound and she cannot bring forth
[1:31:41] nothing
[1:31:43] Church it's a hotter church but if there
[1:31:46] is a seed in there
[1:31:47] then the seed comes to the body and if
[1:31:50] there is a quickening spirit in there
[1:31:51] then it won't just quicken the preacher
[1:31:53] it will quicken whoever it comes in
[1:31:55] contact with it's got a seed but when
[1:32:03] the church disbelief Satan and believes
[1:32:08] the spirits revelation of the word
[1:32:13] maybe if we sit this way believes the
[1:32:17] message of our the gates of Hell cannot
[1:32:21] prevail against her without the baptism
[1:32:27] of the Holy Ghost you can never have
[1:32:30] your eyes open to a true spiritual
[1:32:32] revelation of the world why can't people
[1:32:35] see that I said there it is I happen to
[1:32:37] think I don't care how clear it is how
[1:32:40] much the scripture teaches it you'll
[1:32:42] never be able to see it until God shows
[1:32:44] himself to you and the whole Bible has
[1:32:48] built the whole Church of the Living God
[1:32:50] is built upon a spiritual revelation of
[1:32:52] the word then I want you to notice here
[1:32:55] and I'm gonna quit here because I'm
[1:32:57] running out of time but I want you to
[1:32:59] notice every man that ever has the
[1:33:02] spiritual revealed truth of the will of
[1:33:04] God makes preparation for the fulfilling
[1:33:11] I had preached out already ever every
[1:33:17] man that has a spiritual revelation is
[1:33:20] faking preparation for the fulfilling
[1:33:23] now let me say this
[1:33:25] do not talk about obtaining the literal
[1:33:28] until you can obtain the spiritual are
[1:33:31] you ready aim it now people say oh I'm
[1:33:34] going to that future home they read
[1:33:36] revelation to anyone that I'm going to
[1:33:37] that see that John saw coming down from
[1:33:39] God
[1:33:39] I'm going there brother Samuel ain't
[1:33:41] nothing gonna stop me I'm gonna I'm
[1:33:43] gonna walk the streets of gold I want to
[1:33:45] sit I'm going there and then they hear a
[1:33:47] prophet breach the future home and say
[1:33:49] well I disagree with that disagree if
[1:33:51] you can't obtain the spiritual you won't
[1:33:54] obtain the literal but the reason for
[1:33:56] time but the reason why we are so
[1:34:00] confident we're gonna tame the literal
[1:34:02] it's because we're shouting tonight
[1:34:04] about the spiritual amen when a prophet
[1:34:07] said we're gonna sit by the river we
[1:34:10] said hey man when a prophet said are you
[1:34:13] hearing me what a prophet said we're
[1:34:14] gonna walk the streets of gold and
[1:34:16] describe the future home we said amen we
[1:34:19] heard the spiritual and becuase we are
[1:34:22] possessors of the spiritual we are
[1:34:25] making preparation to take the literal
[1:34:28] altar time closing
[1:34:31] my prophet said to theophany is in this
[1:34:35] building tonight when you heard that and
[1:34:37] you said a man that wasn't preparation
[1:34:40] that you're gonna possess the mineral I
[1:34:44] don't know about you Church but I think
[1:34:46] we ought to just let some amens go on
[1:34:48] this building for a few minutes you
[1:34:53] anybody wanna fill up your tank with
[1:34:55] some toy anybody wanna feel you take up
[1:34:58] with some strength then what did the
[1:34:59] Prophet say if you can say amen to the
[1:35:02] spiritual revelation of the word of God
[1:35:05] that will give you strength
[1:35:07] you know what we are some people tonight
[1:35:10] then when we hear a prophet saying we
[1:35:12] can say man let me ask you a question
[1:35:14] what did you say when you heard him say
[1:35:17] that a lot appeared on the Ohio River
[1:35:20] what did you say when you heard him say
[1:35:23] a boy spoke and said his John the
[1:35:25] Baptist was sent to
[1:35:27] first come into the price your ministry
[1:35:29] or for up to second what did you say
[1:35:31] when you heard him say that an angel of
[1:35:34] Peter and said you'll take a sign of
[1:35:36] your hand and be able to discern the
[1:35:38] very diseases what did you say when you
[1:35:41] heard him say that time will come in the
[1:35:43] second Corps that you'll tell them there
[1:35:45] is secret to the heart what did you say
[1:35:47] when you heard him saying that the third
[1:35:50] pill is the opening of the word what did
[1:35:52] you say when you heard him say seven
[1:35:55] angels make me up on the mountain and
[1:35:57] commissioned me to go back and preach
[1:35:59] the seven seals what did you say when he
[1:36:03] said my ministry is different from the
[1:36:05] evangelists in the pastor my ministry is
[1:36:08] to declare him he is here what did you
[1:36:11] say when you heard him say that every
[1:36:14] devil in hell could not stop that boy
[1:36:17] from rising off the ground and fitment
[1:36:19] what did you say when you heard him say
[1:36:22] the boy said go by the way of Carter's
[1:36:25] what did you say when you heard him say
[1:36:28] you are the sinless payment spotless
[1:36:30] just in fact ride but Jesus Christ as
[1:36:33] though you never done it what did you
[1:36:36] say what did you say to say a man
[1:36:41] I believe in explain it but I believe
[1:36:46] with one of these morons between 6:00
[1:36:49] and 9:00 it's gonna change me what you
[1:36:52] spend your feet tonight when you can
[1:36:55] save man to the spiritual you are a
[1:36:58] candidate to obtain the literal I say
[1:37:05] man that's all I can say I remember I
[1:37:12] remember I remember as a young 16 year
[1:37:15] old preacher barely out on the field
[1:37:17] going to a preacher's office then
[1:37:19] they're studying and the preacher sent
[1:37:21] me
[1:37:21] you know v8 motor the seat of God in you
[1:37:23] we looked at me and said he said you
[1:37:26] know you're not going to see the God in
[1:37:27] here
[1:37:28] I said brother what do you mean he said
[1:37:30] now don't come here preaching that stuff
[1:37:31] he said we were not going to seat in you
[1:37:34] you received a seat in the altar he said
[1:37:36] what do you believe I said well I
[1:37:38] believe a prophet of God sent in several
[1:37:40] places like one white Christ speak the
[1:37:43] seed was put in yet from before the
[1:37:44] foundation of the world I said another
[1:37:46] one is a thinking man's filter the seed
[1:37:49] was in you always a third one is future
[1:37:51] home you wasn't saved on any certain
[1:37:55] certain day you always was saved
[1:37:57] a fourth metropolis pack him up over
[1:37:59] there all right now fourth one was the
[1:38:01] spoken word is the original seed you are
[1:38:04] a predestinated seed just like Christ
[1:38:06] was he said when you heard that did you
[1:38:09] try to explain it or what did you say I
[1:38:11] said brother I couldn't explain it I was
[1:38:14] too busy shouting hey man
[1:38:16] I was too busy screaming in bed because
[1:38:19] I was hearing something that was giving
[1:38:21] me strength we can't deny this message
[1:38:25] now Church it's our strength it's why
[1:38:28] we're here tonight come on musicians if
[1:38:32] you don't come out never quit
[1:38:34] what do we doing here tonight we're
[1:38:36] making preparations we receive the
[1:38:40] spiritual revelation we're going to
[1:38:43] obtain the literal a man a man what'd
[1:38:54] you just say a man I'm an overcomer I'm
[1:38:58] more than a conqueror I'm going in the
[1:39:01] rapture my body's gonna be changed
[1:39:04] I've been justified I've been sanctified
[1:39:09] I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:39:11] I'm sealed into the day of my Redemption
[1:39:15] what are you doing you're agreeing with
[1:39:17] what the word says about you round up
[1:39:27] suddenly come to you and lift you square
[1:39:29] the eyes and said you ain't nothing and
[1:39:32] you'll never amount to nothing you'll
[1:39:33] never be nothing and then they kept it
[1:39:35] off by saying you're ugly you know what
[1:39:40] ain't gonna have no effect on you until
[1:39:45] you agree with what they said then you
[1:39:48] begin to think upon it then it begins to
[1:39:49] affect you and before long ago think
[1:39:51] well I guess I'll never be nothing I
[1:39:53] guess I'll always be defeated I guess
[1:39:54] I'll never make a rapture I guess I
[1:39:58] see but the reason why you don't pay in
[1:40:00] the digit is because that's not what you
[1:40:02] see in yourself then do you see why
[1:40:06] we're not here agreeing with the devil
[1:40:08] tonight it's because what he says we
[1:40:10] just simply don't see it in the mirror
[1:40:12] of God's Word about who we are we see in
[1:40:15] the mirror that we shall abide in him
[1:40:18] and his word and I said we shall have
[1:40:19] all things and we identify ourselves
[1:40:21] with that and say anything related I
[1:40:28] don't know it's just a few more settings
[1:40:29] of a sudden I guess he'll run out a
[1:40:31] streak than have to quit there don't
[1:40:33] talk like that go listen to a tape and
[1:40:38] just sit there the whole time saying
[1:40:40] amen you go listen to the news that sit
[1:40:49] there crap go listen to a tape chat see
[1:40:58] the devil he that was very determined
[1:41:01] Reza said no the devil he is the most
[1:41:06] faithful church member you've got is you
[1:41:13] know why he's the most faithful church
[1:41:14] member Richard can stand behind a pulpit
[1:41:18] they call him a liar tell him he came
[1:41:23] from Haley's going back to him he's a
[1:41:25] liar from the beginning the preacher
[1:41:28] can't stand the pulpit until the church
[1:41:30] stand up and stomp on take your
[1:41:33] spiritual fish to give you a my god you
[1:41:37] can read out of the book of Genesis and
[1:41:38] expose he got started turn over to
[1:41:41] Revelation and expose how he ends tell
[1:41:45] the people to ignore him shiny don't
[1:41:47] listen to him don't pay no attention to
[1:41:49] services dismissed you get up walk out
[1:41:52] he'll be back seven morning you know
[1:41:56] what that tells me that Neville is so
[1:41:58] determined he can't be discouraged you
[1:42:04] can read about his end in the book of
[1:42:06] Revelation of being phone a bottomless
[1:42:08] pit and a Lillian put a polymeric chain
[1:42:10] of circumstance and it doesn't
[1:42:12] discourage him enough to quit well let
[1:42:18] me just go into the book of Revelation
[1:42:19] don't just tell him it also tells yours
[1:42:24] so the same book that tells him his in
[1:42:27] doesn't discourage him enough to quit
[1:42:29] I'll do the same book that tells us our
[1:42:31] end and doesn't discourage us enough to
[1:42:34] quit here as a matter of fact it

[1:44:16] the symptoms of Sarah's body he didn't
[1:44:19] look at this condition of his own he
[1:44:20] also said he never even looked at the
[1:44:23] promise brother what should he be
[1:44:25] looking at the promise remember said no
[1:44:27] he was looking at the one that made the
[1:44:30] promise because ultimately the one that
[1:44:33] makes the promise is who except to to
[1:44:35] fulfill the promise then tonight Church

[1:44:39] look away to Jesus the one that made the
[1:44:41] promise look at him he's the one that's

[1:45:28] I believe the spirit of Goddess you're
[1:45:30] denying
[1:45:32] maybe there's something up on your heart
[1:45:35] you've been praying about
[1:45:37] you've been desiring from the Lord God
[1:45:40] how's it gonna happen
[1:45:42] how is this gonna come to pass can I
[1:45:46] encourage you tonight
[1:45:48] can I courage you tonight start making a
[1:45:52] preparation for the fulfilled
[1:45:56] it amazing how Abraham Abraham never
[1:46:04] never considered those things but a
[1:46:09] prophet of God said in that new
[1:46:12] commentary divine commentary baberaham's
[1:46:15] live for me it says he staggered not at
[1:46:18] the promise of God where did his
[1:46:23] strength cut from his strength come from
[1:46:28] the same place your strength is coming
[1:46:29] from by agree with the word
[1:46:35] it's a powerful study sometime if you
[1:46:37] ever see it now that the Bible talks
[1:46:40] about Abraham saying Amen and how the
[1:46:43] name perhaps Amen was actually an
[1:46:44] exclamation mark it what's in the
[1:46:47] question it was in the comment was in
[1:46:49] the period it was an exclamation mark I
[1:46:52] believe it could you raise your hand and
[1:46:55] I didn't say Lord here's my exclamation
[1:46:57] mark I believe it I believe it I'm done
[1:47:01] worrying about how it's going to happen
[1:47:03] I'm done trying to figure all the ins
[1:47:05] and outs of it I'm gonna start making
[1:47:07] preparation for the fulfilling I'm gonna
[1:47:10] get the fatted calf ready I'm gonna get
[1:47:12] the best robe ready that child is coming
[1:47:14] home that healing is coming that victory
[1:47:17] is coming the devil's told me what's
[1:47:18] going to happen but tonight it's moved
[1:47:21] from just read that in the word to
[1:47:22] spiritually revealed of my heart that's
[1:47:24] going to happen and nothing is going to
[1:47:25] stop it Heavenly Father Lord all across
[1:47:28] this building tonight there God is your
[1:47:31] believing sons and daughters Lord mother
[1:47:34] pool has been upon the word tonight
[1:47:36] father I believe there's an atmosphere
[1:47:38] in this building tonight that all things
[1:47:40] are possible
[1:47:41] now lord I know the devil right now is
[1:47:43] nervous he's trembling his knees are
[1:47:45] knocking because he hates atmospheres
[1:47:47] like this he hates atmospheres if the
[1:47:50] Spirit of God becomes so real that the
[1:47:52] word upon the page becomes flesh hallelu
[1:47:55] he hates services when the spirit begins
[1:47:57] to move in the heart and the person
[1:47:59] quits question what brother Matt said it
[1:48:01] just starts saying a man he hates those
[1:48:06] moments where the preacher hits himself
[1:48:09] out of the way it begins to walk down
[1:48:13] channels and avenues and he doesn't even
[1:48:15] know why he's gone in and the believer
[1:48:17] begins to say only speaking the mean
[1:48:19] that's speaking to me and the devil says
[1:48:21] no it's not he heard about that the for
[1:48:23] church or somebody told him at the
[1:48:24] spirit of god is saying no there's no
[1:48:26] way you could have known it it's for me
[1:48:28] and a man comes out of a turn what is it
[1:48:30] Lord it's a victory hallelujah it's a
[1:48:34] word transitioning from letter to spirit
[1:48:36] line coming from simple to reality oh
[1:48:39] god I pray to that Lord if there would
[1:48:41] be one here tonight it's some shape form
[1:48:44] or fashion would be struggling with the
[1:48:46] spiritual revelation of this word called
[1:48:48] the message of the hour
[1:48:49] I pray tonight they're gone Lord that
[1:48:52] your spear would cut down and would move
[1:48:53] that away from Lord as I wrote your
[1:48:56] prophets say just the other day he said
[1:48:58] let the Holy Ghost come in and search
[1:49:00] your conscience in your conscience will
[1:49:02] argue it forward
[1:49:04] be the dishonor of all doubts will
[1:49:07] dissolve all doubts in your heart but
[1:49:10] we're living in a day in time where
[1:49:11] there's more doubts than there's ever
[1:49:13] been before
[1:49:14] nor those voices becoming voices about
[1:49:16] becoming voices of confusion becoming
[1:49:19] voices of chaos becoming voices of the

[1:53:03] just a few days ago in a meeting over at
[1:53:07] Virginia while I was preaching there was
[1:53:10] a sister sitting in the back of the
[1:53:12] church she has a Spanish speaking sister
[1:53:15] had to have a ear thing for
[1:53:17] interpretation she had lost her hearing
[1:53:21] I believe it was in her right ear she
[1:53:23] could only hear out of her left ear
[1:53:25] mom's preaching I was talking about how
[1:53:28] God can move right when the words going
[1:53:30] forth it don't have to be you laying
[1:53:31] your hands on a bird or anoint him with
[1:53:34] all just while the word is going forth
[1:53:35] you can receive what you have neither
[1:53:37] and something begin to quicken in her
[1:53:40] heart she said I was saying amen amen
[1:53:43] amen
[1:53:46] with everything within me but I couldn't
[1:53:47] hear out that right ear she said so I
[1:53:50] really said I come to the conclusion
[1:53:52] God's gonna heal me right here she said
[1:53:55] I pulled the left thing out of my ear
[1:53:57] the left interpretation and left it only
[1:53:59] in the ear I couldn't hear him she said
[1:54:01] I took my finger and put this here and
[1:54:03] she said without even thinking she said
[1:54:06] all of a sudden I just said a man she
[1:54:10] said I knew at that time the interpreter
[1:54:11] ought to be saying something and she
[1:54:13] said as I said Amen that ear come open
[1:54:15] and she said I left for the left ear
[1:54:17] thing out and the rock went in the rest
[1:54:19] of the service and said hey man I never
[1:54:23] laid my hands on a brother
[1:54:25] I never known a recall but she agreed
[1:54:27] with the words she was hearing she just
[1:54:31] simply said hey man what about it
