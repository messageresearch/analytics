========================================

here is not for us to presume things the program of god is not guessing it's not saying well i feel led and then what you feel led is contrary to the word you might have felt led but it wasn't the holy ghost leader right right you see it comes it comes into a place that god's desire is that we would walk not without understanding but that we would walk with understanding let me just be very clear understanding doesn't mean that you've got everything together that you're a man i've got it all put together let me just go ahead and tell you brother branham would stand there and preach christ the mystery he said i'm sure we don't see it as we ought to see it he said i don't see it as i'd ought to see it you say well then how do i see it more clearly walk in the line you've got to keep walking in the light amen amen so the kingdom of god i know these are very simple but just something i'm building to here the kingdom of god is not natural it's spiritual amen it's not of this world the world itself the deformity and the conformity of all this all the parts that remember that came forth between satan and eve when he sold doubt and unbelief against the word of god and she opened her mind to that and received it and look what it produced it produced a cane who could stand right in the face of god and god offering mercy but he would spit it right back in god's face but then they're coming able see after now the fall has come here come abel and you see with abel here look at the humility god reveals to him bring a lamb to offer up a lamb i wonder was able was it something that the whole time that he was raising this lamb or the birth came and he knew all along or was it something that it was moving in his heart because the bible says in the process of time those boys came to worship it was something that was a longing that abel didn't put in his heart he could look around no doubt and see what cain was doing cain was cultivating all the fruits and man he had everything just right oh it was nice fruits he could quote that chapter knew the chapter after it could quote that verse he knew the books of the bible forward and back and you're not able no doubt looking at it and saying my my mind i can't even do anything like that oh i wonder what it is that god requires who put that in able to long for that it was god that put that in able amen and there's only one that can answer that call there could be a lot of men and a lot of people that can come by the way but there's only one that can give that answer to what's calling for that deep parliamentary thing and that's the god who put it in you thank you hallelujah god put it there and god revealed to abel when abel walked there it wasn't that he walked there with a complete understanding and everything all put together but this is what he had understanding is god has revealed this it was blood that took us out there was so much that god had revealed god had revealed this is the acceptable way he got there and he offered it up and here came down a witness that he was righteous you see it's something that moves within abel as it moves within a heart that a heart can't be settled but just church you can't just be settled with religion right let me just be very clear with you you can treat this message like it's religion but it'll never be any good that's right this message is not religion this message is the revealing of the person of jesus christ this is why jesus would say except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god he can't he can't even understand it now think of how it takes god coming down by the new birth to open our spiritual eyes yes you pass right through us it could pass right through and one person can look there could be people who would sit here or sitting here would look and say pretty good service man it doesn't have an effect right but then sitting within the same service in the presence of god there's another life that's affected right it's things that it isn't all together they can explain but their life has been affected they recognize there's something beyond words that's being spoken here but god is speaking to my heart here you are in a congregation of i don't know how many are here but yet god himself comes in such a manner to where it's like it's only you and him that's in this building you know why because that's his desire for your life that it's only you and him amen hallelujah that's why he comes that personal he comes that person will let you know that he loves you you think of how as we look at this and paul would express this even in first corinthians two and paul would talk about here was a man that was so that was gifted in so many languages this man was gifted and we're talking about a man now he's already he's already received a new birth he's already his eyes are open right but look what the mind of christ in him did before he even steps up to minister he says i was with you in weakness trembling in he fear it be known i'm not coming to you with enticing words of man's wisdom but it was to come the preaching was to come and it came by power and demonstration that the faith of the people might stand in the living god that's god's desire that's why god comes that's why he speaks so personal it's more than just words you can hear words and it just remains right there but when here it is it's zoned it's concluded that this is christ who's talking to me this is the same one who walked the shores of galilee and he's uncovering your life he's revealing the thoughts in your life a man can't do that that takes almighty god and when he's uncovering you he's not trying to shame you what he's doing he's exposing the devil and that's the time to forsake and run to him amen this is why paul would say we speak wisdom he's talking wisdom wisdom that comes from god james says that wisdom is pure yes it's full of mercy he says we speak wisdom among them that are perfect this is wrote to the corinthian church what perfection is he talking about he's talking about those who have crossed and passed the line the point of no return they have come from the carnal into the spiritual mind they have been born of the spirit of god they have come into the perfection of christ and it is christ's own perfection that is working in their life they are perfect even as our father which is in heaven is perfect so this this wisdom if it is that which is spoken among those that are perfect or those that have come into that of the new birth now notice how paul he would go on to write about this uh because among uh the jews pharisees and so forth here they had everything laid out they had all the scriptures and prophecies these people were not ignorant if i could say it like this they weren't ignorant of the bible even though when the bible then it was scrolls and you understand that they weren't ignorant of that remember when they stood and talked with jesus these men could quote things and they would question him what do you say about this now think of it here is a carnal mind it's looking at the word but here is the spiritual mind of god that there is on display and a carnal mind was looking at the word look what the carnal mind did it had them in bondage it pounded everybody else but the spiritual mind concerning the word came down and it was bringing liberty and freedom because why they needed to be loosed from a carnal mind amen and this is why paul would say they didn't know their day of visitation right and that's why they crucified him you see let me just look at look at god's mercy for a moment here you didn't seek this message out this message would go right over your head it would go right past you or as brother branham put in modern events pass right through you and it's gone but what was it what was it you would have missed if the spirit hadn't come upon you let me tell you john john a prophet of god and god had told him this is what's going to happen you're going to be baptizing down there at the river jordan but john would have missed jesus if it hadn't been for the holy ghost you see he was dependent on the same holy ghost that had filled it from his mother's womb he was depending on him to let him know the junction of the word and where it was at what was he doing he wasn't looking at his carnal mind he was looking to god hallelujah the carnal mind what is the carnal mind brother brandon brings a carnal mind and they would come up to john hey john you know this guy down here you know your dad said he's a real good guy real fine guy you know he he can he can he knows the law and he knows all this you know how brother grandma will dramatize it this guy you know he's a real good guy he's a real that's carnal mind right right hey that carnal mind it went up there in the upper room and there was some guy they got up there under the carnal mind this is when the carnal mind was still dominating them and they wanted to pick somebody to take judas's place carmen man does not pick for god god pits man recognizes god's choice well we can preach a lot on that courtship their marriage on and on and on pastors so forth we can preach on that it's not man picking it's god we want to be alert to the mind of god god's will so the spirit comes upon us so we don't miss seeing it right the same spirit that told simeon you're not going to die until you seen the lord's christ is the same holy spirit that came that day when mary was standing there with with jesus in her arms that same spirit said hallelujah follow me send me a new enough just to follow him and he led him right to the promise it had made known to him now notice in verse nine of first corinthians 2 it's written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yeah the deep things of god for what man look at this not the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him man can only know man things but when god has come into that life then you're no longer just you know here upon this earth you become a twofold being right you hear upon this earth but you're in contact now into that realm where you as a son and daughter of god in relationship with god and the mind of christ is operating through your life and every time do you get in trouble is when you don't let the mind of christ go to operate that's right well i need to give a piece of my mind that's not the mind of christ that's free even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually deserving but he that is spiritual judgeth all things notice spiritual talking about spirit fear discerns what is it that deserves it's that inner man on the inside it's not that you've got the holy ghost and now you're relying on your carnal mind no remember it's not you leading god it's god leading you the spiritual mind is the son and daughter of god that has the right of way in our life it's that which leads you to make choices and decisions that are contrary to the natural mind decisions that others could say why are you doing that that doesn't make sense but the spiritual mind catches the will of god the carnal mind says you've been a member of this church for how long your your grandparents we all were raised this particular way that's the carnal mind but the spiritual mind is what looks beyond god beginning to move and open and understanding he's drawing on that part that he's so on the inside amen he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ amen it's god directing his body from within amen amen god is directing his body he's directing your life from within it's god that draws a life from within into repentance it's god that draws a life from within do you recognize what's taking place as the spirit of god is dealing with a life it's not necessarily that coming to you it's him leading you out of you it's god leading you out it's god coming out in your life that's what he does so this this the mind of christ operating in our life it's that of the spirit of truth it's god moving remember the scriptures the promise is when the spirit of truth is come he will lead and guide us into all things he'll bring things to our remembrance he will lead and guide us the promise was that he will glorify he'll glorify jesus christ it'll lift him up as the victorious one the mighty conqueror he takes what does the holy ghost do he takes of the word and reveals it to you and i it's not how eloquent a man can speak or wow my this man can put this together back this up so it's become so clear a man can't do that that takes god it is a sovereign work between god and his people god will take a gift like paul would tell timothy steady to show that self-approve but it was not timothy to coming to rely upon his studies he studied but when he stood right there he was like paul trembling wow he knows it gotta be god come it's got to be god take the word it's got to be god speak to the people hallelujah the holy ghost takes the word in our lives and reveals that word it's him opening that word in our life you see there's a lot of things that we could look at evidences but the sure evidence of the holy ghost is when the spirit of truth has come he will lead and guide you into all truth the love of the world is gone there's no condemnation because why in your own self you know where you're standing the love of the world is gone you're not just standing at somebody in their spirit or their natural mind say well i love god i love god no it's from your soul you know the love of god has moved inside there and this word that you're reading it's not just words on paper [Music] it's life to you amen amen it's things that nuggets and you might say i don't see the complete picture but you've got to have pieces of the puzzle in order for the picture to come don't get in a hurry don't get anxious what do i do be patient patient is this is what god has done in my life this this is what he's committed to he'll lead and guide me into all truth amen this is what jesus said a little while and the world won't see me matter of fact he said you won't see me but he says you'll see me again speaking of the resurrection they didn't understand that but then as he expresses it i go away right you'll see me remember they asked him how are we going to see you how are we going to see you how are we going to know you now think of it when everything took place i want you to catch this they they the disciples right there with him had not caught john's ministry is that right right they caught it in a sense that they knew there was something about john's ministry they had been listen they had been baptized under repentance but as far as that position and all of that coming and tying together of that of elijah they didn't see it at that moment but when jesus sat down he never said hey john is that elijah he never even had to say that he just began to speak the word the word of promise for that day and the bible says then they understood that he spoke to them concerning john the baptist see that's the same the same way that god comes to make himself known to our lives let me just just take a few scriptures here we're talking of that spiritual mind right in the very center of the bible we're speaking of that's that spiritual mind i i renew how it's just a it must be a transformation a change that god himself alone brings now think of this in the very center of the bible the the very center of it is psalms 103 bless the lord on my soul and all that's within me bless his holy name bless the lord on my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thy iniquities healeth all thy diseases redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles in isaiah 40 verse 31 the bible says they that wait upon the lord that's what they had to do in the upper room they had to wait on the lord but waiting according to his promise amen they that wait on the lord so a promise is made known god makes that promise known to that life and that life god is drawing that life he's drawing that heart now notice they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint amen so he satisfied our mouth with good things it's good things it comes into our life it gets down here this is where it has to be lived but he's satisfying us with that truth that reality he's feeding us how how does how does he feed us this is him him imparting his word to you and i am amen so that our youth is renewed as an eagle right amen god likens his prophets to eagles god likens his children to eagles because an eagle you know i know i've probably said this here before we we have them around more and more so in ohio than we than we've ever uh had them and i can look up you know at times you can be driving you can see a set of wings my looks to be like a big bird but every time i watch it and i see can it stay steady if it can't stay steady i turn my eyes from it because i know it's not an eagle because an eagle even in the midst of strong winds and strong currents it's not shaky that's a vulture the vulture you know them ugly turkey vultures them things are they they're all shaking and all over the place right even though i watched the heart get blown around but what you'll find about an eagle is when those currents begin to come in an eagle knows how to take and to move within that current amount it's built for those currents when those currents come the eagle just keeps on climbing and climbing and climbing it was built to travel in those winds i mean just say very clearly you were built to travel in this wind you are ordained for the swim what wind are you talking about the same russian mighty wind that came on the day of pentecost the same wind that came and feel that body that stood up that was dry bones and skin and sinew and all that came upon it that same wind that filled it what is that wind it is the prophecy of the word coming to pass the spirit of god moving and giving life amen this is eagle time amen amen brother branham over and over praise the lord throughout the message they'll say the spiritual mind will catch this he talks about even what was taking place you know even when john f kennedy got elected right is that right he talked about things that was going on then he talked about pressures that was coming on even in the national level that was going on at that time he talked about all those things let me just tell you that wasn't the mind of william brown a spiritual mind sees the chaos but notice that's that is prophesied in the scripture we're living in a time of trouble men's hearts are feeling failing for fear we're living in evil days paul spoke of those to timothy that was not for that day that's for this day if god has spoken that that's clear in this day there is also a promise that god has made no for his children to escape that judgment to abstain the pressures of this world as it was in the days of noah so shall be in the coming of the son of man not just a part of god but the very fullness amen right there's a body on earth the fullness of christ in his people as he walks in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of lot what was the days of loss that's why you look at this movement that's going on right now it's nothing but sodomites they don't have the interest of the black people at all it's solomites why that's what's inspired on this earth in this time but let me tell you there's a real holy ghost that'll bring unity between the black and the white between the latino and the white it's the holy world that's taking us [Applause] it and will not be caught up in foolish things [Music] spiritual mind catches it to recognize what's behind us spiritual mind catches it that's right to wear on the front a couple years ago the man of the year on the homosexual magazine the man of the year pope francis spiritual mind catches those things denominational and others can say my how terrible this is how terrible that is but listen the carnal mind will look at john 17 and say well we're all to be one let's all get together it don't matter what you are let's all get together that's balaamism the spiritual minds that you see these are not just scriptures and stories in the old testament the spiritual mind catches that and says balaamism is not of god it's wanting to unite that of god and that of the world and god said i will not accept that all right [Applause] all of these things are taking place but that ain't my focus no the world's getting caught up let them get caught up we've been caught up right amen amen the spiritual mind catches them to me there's never been a better time to live and yet if you just look at the world it's terrible but you see what is it that that is so good about right now it's god himself that has come down among us he's revealing himself in his word that is the same yesterday today and forever i know who i am you know who you are the spiritual man tested and said it's time to leave the spiritual that's why brother branham would say it like this this book men have had we got to get the right greek translation we got to get this translation that ain't what was needed we needed the holy ghost to come and take his word and reveal it to our hearts amen amen it will take brother brown would say like this he said he will take a people with prophetic insight you realize what that means that you ordained to be spiritual paul said let him that is spiritual or a prophet acknowledge the things i write unto you are the commandments of the law it's something that raises within you what is that prophetic you were always an ego right amen but there had to come a quickening it took the spirit of god revealing that word to begin to lift that up we see all of this around us nations are breaking yes that's right israel's awakening the signs that the prophets foretold gentile days are numbered the day of redemption is near men's hearts are failing for fear be filled with the spirit you're lamp trimmed and clean you see this this eagle hallelujah you trace that eagle on down on down through the lineage that eagle here his grandmother's grandpa on and on and on was eagles everybody you find the believers down through the scriptures they were eagles enoch was an eagle elijah was an eagle elisha was an eagle ruth was an eagle rehab was an eagle we're talking about eagles they were able to see yes amen they are able to see afar off they walk as pilgrims and strangers among the people in that hour they were thought crazy they were cut but fools right right ruth why are you going that direction yeah you don't have no promise over there something was drawing here amen you're right something was drawing her let me just move on from there it was drawing her into that place you see as an eagle now an eagle brother brown will tell that story over and over of that little eagle that's in the barnyard that eagle remember when mama came over him that gripped his heart but what mama told him she told him you got to make a jump right right in other words you got to make a start somewhere brother ramble pick this up within this time of the message he'll talk about in a prisoner he said if you got to start with your dress you start there you've got to have a start all right there's there's there's ground you've got to start and build and let god build within your life he said you got to make a jump he said now when that first jump was made he said oh my you know he didn't look pretty right i mean when that eagle made that first jump but you see he had never been there right he had never done that before right but when he obeyed that voice then when he says jump i never jumped before but when he opened it he jumped it didn't look pretty but he was off the ground amen and that's what faith that's what brother ben said we all started that way it took faith in the word to get us off the ground amen but the objective was not just the fence post the objective amen hallelujah because [Music] it's because you were built to fly up here amen there was a call that came over the world the rest of the carnal mind the rest that could be there saying why there's nothing to it and they keep on going back to it but you can't do that right let me preach now i just feel to follow this you can't go back to that now there's things when god taps and he deals with your life you might be flopping around but you know i can't go back you know why there's a reality that's taking hold of your life but that reality he wants to bring you fully into himself that's why you can't be comfortable it doesn't matter where you would go there is only one place of rest and that's in christ christ is that place of rest amen this is what that's the word brother brown i'm here when courage and hearts he says if you if you've not fully fed on this word to give yourself strength to fly above all the denominations and things of the world will you do it at this time you see paul would go on another place and i'm gonna i'm just gonna close here paul would go on in another place here in the scriptures and he would speak of inner life of how we put off that old man put on that new man that is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him neither greek nor jew circumcision or uncircumcision barbarians cynthia bond nor free but christ is all and in all right the scriptures we opened with in romans 8 that which is of the flesh minds the things of the flesh what's of the spirit minds the things of the spirit the flesh cannot receive the things of god all right it takes that inside man it's the inner man that god's talking to amen don't try to straighten this guy out what do i do die let go all right let go hallelujah let go means lay it night down at his feet did the hound just say god i'm giving everything that i am to you the flesh that mind cannot receive the things of god but it takes the spirit of god coming on the spiritual mind it isn't that you understand everything but you've come in contact with the world around that you know it's real you know you've been brought into that realm the word is not just letters to you any longer it's not just letters it's light to your life when you're listening to the message you hear god speaking to you you're reading in the scriptures god's speaking to you you're in prayer god's speaking to you and isn't that you that they're always hearing an audible voice but the word will speak to you amen right there's things you begin to see in the world it begins to set you in motion amen what is it it's god revealing his word in you it's a spiritual mind the scripture said we no longer walk after the flesh but we walk after the spirit right right it speaks of where the desire the first place in our life is to him the flesh could say but the spirit says this paul think of it but here is over here is that woman following him around these men being the men of god to show us the way under righteousness at any moment paul could have turned around and said all right get out of here satan right at any time he could have done that but you see what the mind of christ did the spiritual mind waited on orders from god amen amen and finally after god let them run their advertisements then finally the spirit of god let paul and paul turn around and said that spirit come out of here all right right see everything was in its season and in its time this is why for the round over and over and say a gift it's not like a knife you take and cut your way into something he said but a gift is what is unit and god uses it this is why the real gift is that soul that comes from god and what is that soul it's a life it's not you doing it but it's christ you yielding and christ is doing it through you the real gift is where you're able to get yourself out of the way and you know what's a paradox is even when you're getting in the way there's a greater reality raises up on the inside just calm down boy something moves up from the inside a spiritual mind a spiritual mind when the carnal mind could say why in the world this airplane down got to get into this place right now memphis stranded in memphis goodness what are we going to do you know what i'm talking about god allowed the instruments on that airplane the prophet was traveling on those instruments started going hey why brother ram couldn't see that good thing i wouldn't want to see that either i already told the young people i ain't getting on a pilotless airplane i get on there getting right back off i'd rather ride a paper airplane than a pilot was formed but here god grounds that plane [Music] why there was a need not in the whole city of memphis one person and she had read in the word there was a need in her home her son was wayward he was dying but what she wanted for his healing she wanted his soul to be right with god [Applause] and she looked in the word it wasn't a battle story to her she read in the word she said lord as that of my woman now where is your elijah spiritual mind amen spiritual mind you see it's a spiritual mind that leads you in the word to find your answer sometimes you're looking for answers you say well that ain't wrote in the scripture but you watch how god can find me god can direct you it might come out here in a service it might come while you're listening to a message or in the scripture and then god might drop something you might be driving down the road and all of a sudden the spirit of god as you're meditating it comes in upon your life and then you got a peace you don't know how it's all going to work out but you know it's settled it's finished what is that spiritual mind amen thank you lord one of one of them i'm so glad that i can say one of them morning person amen praise the lord how did you know i was a person because i've been standing here waiting on you that's somebody who takes a hold of a promise and says i don't care if the weather conditions do was on her back god made something known to her and she said i'm gonna wait here until it comes to pass spiritual mind amen brother batman ask her oh you know tells her his name have you ever heard of me said no see it wasn't because she heard of him or knew about him she only knew she had prayed she identified herself in the word now she said lord i'm identified there you are also in the word where is your elijah to me and she recognizes they go into that house you know what brother brandon said when she got down to pray brother brown says my goodness he said when she prayed i know she had talked to him before hallelujah and the presence of god came right there into that home and where that boy was out there he was drowning in sin he was drowning in despair but a spiritual man was able to look away look beyond the circumstances and call jesus on the scene and down movement he said it's getting light in here oh it's getting light mama mama it's getting light what was it light was coming to him [Applause] the spiritual mind this is why as we walk in the spirit we're walking after the spirit we're not walking after the flesh that word walk it deals with i'm closing it deals with me oversight the regulating the directing of our life brother branham brings it so simple he says in this manner he says the doctor can say you're going to die you don't have a chance to live he said that's what the doctor will say he said but then the holy ghost comes right and he gives a vision and he says thus saith the lord you're going to be well right then we say what the spirit has said amen we no longer walk by the flesh we're walking by the spirit because the brandon brings it down very simple again he says in that same place he says my flesh says oh i'm too tired oh you had such a long week how about just streaming where you can prop your feet up in your lazy boy who preached brother sam you know god and god knows and god understands the flesh says you're too tired but the spirit says get ready and when we get there i'm gonna need to borrow your hands because i'm gonna need to clap a little bit sure sure is the world i'm gonna need to raise him in the air change the world i'm gonna need to borrow that now [Applause] one of these days the flesh is gonna take gonna think that spiritual mind on the inside because this spiritual mind is going to lead it right into a body change the spiritual mind that catches the will of god god's desire is to fulfill his word through our life it isn't about i think god has said that so clearly through this service it's not about you understanding everything right as ministers we don't understand everything the things that we're ministering it's what god has revealed it's not what you understand by your natural mind it's what god has revealed and god doesn't reveal everything all at once he reveals little by little by the way but the first part even in starting is letting go like that little eagle and let god take you into those realms where you belong let him take you there there's nothing to say it's so clear there's nothing that he hasn't already taken care of for your departure he's already made a way it doesn't matter what would be a hold on a person's life he has already freed you if you can only let your faith accept what he has already done as soon as you let your faith just say be it unto me let me just tell you satan he gets antsy in these times because god has come in the word and he's taken the cover off of him he lets it be exposed that he's already a defeated being amen and satan has already been stripped of his authority and right now even as a son and daughter of god you've got a right to accept the liberty that god has already purchased for you you can put it just in this plain simple way i denounced that of the world i surrender fully to god lord fill me with your life and
